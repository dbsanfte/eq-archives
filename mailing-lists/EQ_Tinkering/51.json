The observer staff quest is given out at the observatory North of the Windmills, where as the other lens quest is given by the observitory by Akanon. And just for the record the Obeserver staff is NOT the best staff in the game for mage classes.. The Staff of Writhing is much better+ACE- It casts random chaotic feedbacks... and its has some nice +- stats too. Cant remember them all exacly. Ill look next time i log on.
