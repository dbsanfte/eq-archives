Your <br/>\nexperiences seem to be similar to others I have seen.  However, I would like <br/>\nyou and other gnome tinkerers in your situation to take into consideration <br/>\nus other gnomes who are trying to tinker.  As you stated in your post you <br/>\nstarted off selling Aqualungs at 500pp and this barely covered costs. I <br/>\nmyself am at this stage and am trying to sell my aqualungs.  However, I have <br/>\ncome accross a problem.  As there are 2 or 3 tinkerers who have got to the <br/>\nrebreather stage on my server they have are selling their aqualungs at 400pp <br/>\nand I find that to sell any of my aqualungs I also have to sell them at <br/>\n400pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realise this keeps the number of tinkerers and so competition on the <br/>\nservers down,  however, we are fellow gnomes and not many of us are even <br/>\ntrying tinkering. Have a thought for us who have already put thousands of <br/>\nplat into the skill only to be penalised as we don&#39;t have as much <br/>\nmoney/don&#39;t play as much as some others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis post is not aimed at Flintnilf but at Tinkerers in general.  I am <br/>\nactually on Cazic Thule and have more of a problem as even when I get to <br/>\nrebreather stage they are being sold for 2500pp and one of the higher level <br/>\ntinkerers told me off for trying to sell Spyglasses for 80pp and trying to <br/>\ngive tinkerers a bad name but this is the only way I can make any money out <br/>\nof the skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying lets rip ppl off. I&#39;m saying we have put alot of money and <br/>\ntime into our skill.  Lets at least get some of that money back.<br/>\n<br/>\nTzia<br/>\nSkill level 110<br/>\nTrying to break even<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
