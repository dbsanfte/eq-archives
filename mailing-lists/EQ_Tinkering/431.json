I should<br/>\nknow, I made one :P<br/>\n<br/>\nFACT: The collapsible fishing pole is a player made item.

Probably in the same book as<br/>\nthe firewater and collapsible pole :P<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, its in there but we haven&#39;t found it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome newly found info: The spyglass sells to merchants for exactly 16pp.<br/>\nBy comparison, I get 8gp/1.6pp flameless lantern, 9.6pp/15pp cams,<br/>\n12pp/18.4pp for stalking probes and lockpicks.  This is with a Bristlebane<br/>\nRogue with a 60cha and indifferent /con.  In that case the pole could cost<br/>\n4-8pp to make (ballpark figure).  Keep in mind that the sell back price<br/>\nISN&#39;T always directly related to component costs.

I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; really doubt that Verant made it difficult, considering it is a component<br/>\n&gt;&gt; for another item.  So, this should limit the parts to those costing 1 pp or<br/>\n&gt;&gt; less, with the total cost not exceeding 5 pp.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Thought #4:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Whoever assumed that the spyglasses were being sold for 50% over cost is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; assuming way too much.  If you are the only producer of an item, you can<br/>\n&gt;&gt; demand a much higher profit return on that item.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Thought #5:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; There is no such thing as a &quot;secret&quot; on Everquest.  There are too many<br/>\n&gt;&gt; people playing the game, making any new discovery part of the common<br/>\n&gt;&gt; knowledge base within a few weeks.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Thought #6:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Seeing &quot;broken&quot; quests, items, and spells in the past, I wouldn&#39;t put it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; past Verant that the collapsible fishing pole recipe isn&#39;t really in the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; game.  I am merely speculating, but I find it rather hard to believe that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; after months of uptime, not one gnome has found the recipe to such a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>trivial<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt; item as the collapsible fishing pole.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Thought #7:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; This is perhaps the most overriding aspect of this whole ridiculous thread<br/>\n&gt;&gt; about the collapsible fishing pole recipe.  There are literally hundreds of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; items that could be used as a component, and it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; make any sense whatsoever.  Trying to guess it blindly is just like playing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the lottery.  You might get lucky, but we don&#39;t have the hundreds of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; thousands of players needed to insure that SOMEONE gets lucky.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Phenglei of Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
