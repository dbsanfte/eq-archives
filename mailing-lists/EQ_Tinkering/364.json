If someone is making the poles and the eye <br/>\n&gt;glasses, I would have thought we would have heard about more people having <br/>\n&gt;them. We have not heard a peep from anyone since. Perhaps as Luke said, <br/>\n&gt;the pole was given as part of a GM quest, and was not actually tinkered.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think it says something about the sad state of tinkering when our &#39;holy <br/>\n&gt;grail&#39; is a damn fishing pole =|<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cheers,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;FizzWizz of tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist now has T-SHIRTS!<br/>\n&gt;For details and to order, go to:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html\">http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
