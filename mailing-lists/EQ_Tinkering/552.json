I hope you reconsider and do indeed leave us. If I have to beg I will,<br/>\nplease, please, please leave the list. Because there is no way I would ever want<br/>\nanyone to share anything with someone as selfish and egotistical as yourself.<br/>\nWe know you don&#39;t want to help us, and guess what.  We don&#39;t want to help you.<br/>\nSo please remove yourself from this list.  You are not wanted here.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua Bednarz wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Joshua Bednarz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thewhitemage@...\">thewhitemage@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I apologize, I didn&#39;t mean to come off sounding so pompous, and arrogant. I<br/>\n&gt; really was being pathetically immature, I guess it was just becuase I had<br/>\n&gt; just gotten a clue, that really helps the discovery or the pole. You see it<br/>\n&gt; would clear up alot, but I don&#39;t wish to tell because, I swore to the one<br/>\n&gt; who told me the clue that I wouldn&#39;t tell anyone what it was that he said,<br/>\n&gt; and I don&#39;t want to dishonor him, or myself. They hold this secret pretty<br/>\n&gt; close to thier hearts, and take it pretty seriously. I didn&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; decieve this person. I can, when I want to, use words with the most<br/>\n&gt; excellent of skill, like when I got a clue from the guy that part of this<br/>\n&gt; unknown organization, and I can also be a jerk and come off sounding like an<br/>\n&gt; 8 year old troll, as you have learned, well I&#39;m sorry, and I hope you can<br/>\n&gt; understand why I feel that I must keep my knowledge a secret for now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--Eron<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aeron@...\">aeron@...</a><br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom a real accident report:<br/>\n&quot;To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front, I struck the pedestrian.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
