Having followed your adventures and attempts at<br/>\ndiscovering the lost knowledge of tinkering has kept me going...and now I am<br/>\nready to start working as well.<br/>\nA few questions though....<br/>\nI already know what to make as I progress, but I&#39;m curious...how do you sell<br/>\nthe items you make (ie fireworks, cams, etc?)  I really doubt anyone would<br/>\nbuy a flameless lantern, and I don&#39;t blame them, but what about other items?<br/>\nI have successfully made some cams and can&#39;t seem to sell them.  Nor<br/>\nfireworks, which I have heard are a hit...which makes me feel useless since<br/>\nI can&#39;t get rid of them.<br/>\nAny advice would be appreciated, and since I don&#39;t know of any other gnomes<br/>\ntinkering on my world this was the only place I knew to ask.  Of course, if<br/>\nthere is another one out there that&#39;d be great...<br/>\n<br/>\nPhizn Frugin<br/>\nMithMarr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
