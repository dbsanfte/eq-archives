Example: you are in a mall and you happen to<br/>\n&gt; see, say, a golden chain. you dont need a golden chain but are intrigued by<br/>\n&gt; it so you check it out. $200! you say. &quot;HELL NO.&quot; you think. &quot;too much.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; i.e. customer walks away and sale is not made.  ok. same scenario..you are<br/>\n&gt; in a mall and you happen to see, say, a golden chain. you dont need a golden<br/>\n&gt; chain but are intrigued by it so you check it out. $80. &quot;wow. thas a good<br/>\n&gt; price!&quot; ok. FIRST OFF, the customer, who didnt even need a golden chain in<br/>\n&gt; the first place is ALREADY considering the purchase. this would not be the<br/>\n&gt; case if the price were, oh, say $200.  the customer would have disregarded<br/>\n&gt; the purchase right away because high prices are a turn -off.  yur already<br/>\n&gt; halfway to a sale! congrats! so, say you offer something else that makes the<br/>\n&gt; sale almost unresistable ( time for you to get creative..i wont divulge my<br/>\n&gt; own methods). now the customer is almost ready to buy the item...he/she is<br/>\n&gt; already considering the money they have in his/her pocket and, basically<br/>\n&gt; talking themselves into buying said merchandise (ppl do this all the time,<br/>\n&gt; they tell themselves it is a GREAT deal and they prolly wont find it ever<br/>\n&gt; again..etc..etc) now for people skills. if yur good, the sale is complete,<br/>\n&gt; and you walk away with money in your pocket, as well as a satisfied<br/>\n&gt; customer. does this sound logical? ok, now take the prices i used, divide by<br/>\n&gt; 2, and multiply by 10. Voila! Cest-Magifique! (my price vs these (fill in<br/>\n&gt; derogatory name here) suggested retail price)<br/>\n&gt; btw... i HIGHLY encourage ppl on Veeshan (Askur&#39;s server), Zinken&#39;s server,<br/>\n&gt; and Gagaliya&#39;s server and show these &quot;buisness experts&quot; just how you can<br/>\n&gt; very easily:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1.)create a loyal customer base<br/>\n&gt; 2.)make many ppl VERY happy/satisfied<br/>\n&gt; 3.)make plenty of cash to tinker on<br/>\n&gt; 4.)how to flatline your opponent&#39;s (in this case one of the 3 said arses)<br/>\n&gt; Tinkering income.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; take care honest gnomes out there.<br/>\n&gt; -Ranth Rathan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
