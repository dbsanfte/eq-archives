I was <br/>\nthinking it was a cleric or paladin quest, and had something to do with <br/>\nfaction with the Underfoot people. I could be wrong, its something to think <br/>\nabout.<br/>\n<br/>\nNicodemious the Neverlost<br/>\n&quot;What WOULD I like my tombstone to say?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;OK first of all I think that tattred gnomish cloak can be MADE from err<br/>\n&gt;tailoring skill, and I saw a few posts that you can aquire the scteches<br/>\n&gt;somewhere in Kelethin ( Wood Elf City, ahh those sexy women of theirs :))<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;second this would be a very prized item to have , for dragon raids I would<br/>\n&gt;suspec it would be somthing like 20 sv cold 20 sv fire. and the high lvl<br/>\n&gt;people would be glad to buy it! So it is also away to make contacts for<br/>\n&gt;dragon / and even plane raids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;anyways . as a necro I can not buy in klethin so I can;t find out where the<br/>\n&gt;sketches are. but if somoene can go ahead and try it:)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
