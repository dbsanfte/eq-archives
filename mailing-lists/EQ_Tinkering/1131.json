I have heard that it is some kind of water breathing item.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a new component at the windmills in Steamfont, a &#39;hinge&#39; or something I forget what it was called.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course the recipe is a mystery at the moment, (Lets all say it together... &quot;Verant Bastards!&quot; ) I talked to all the  npc&#39;s in steamfont and no new quests, the water breathing thing is NOT mentioned in any of the tinkering books that we have a present.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, just as we figure out the fishing pole mystery, we have a new one in trying to find out the recipe of the &#39;scuba gear&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\nDidn&#39;t have too much time to do much searching tonight, but keep your ears open for rumors about another book with more recipes or the recipe for the &#39;scuba gear&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;FizzWizz&quot; of tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
