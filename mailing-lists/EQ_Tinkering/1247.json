Verant is trying desperately to take money out<br/>\nof the system.  Almost all of the new quests involve a method of depleting your<br/>\nbank account.  Trade skills have always been a money pit.   Decreasing the<br/>\ncharges from 50 to 1 upon trade would accomplish nothing but making the item<br/>\nunsellable, and causing distrust between the players who are driving the<br/>\n&quot;player driven economy&quot;, this fact alone seems to be in direct conflict with<br/>\nVerant&#39;s vision.  Its a bug.  I suggest we all /bug it, and if you can<br/>\nfabricate an aqua lung, I suggest you do so and /petition a GM so he can see<br/>\nfirst hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMalkin Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
