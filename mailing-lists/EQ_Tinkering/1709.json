He says he was sent to the<br/>\nKaranas to Kill some undead Brownies, and return their remains to Akannon.<br/>\nHe gives you a 4 slot Box which is No Drop i belive.  Last i heard this<br/>\nquest was broken because the Tiny skelitens you recive when you kill the<br/>\nundead brownies are NO DROP, so getting 4 of them and filling the box is<br/>\nnot possible.  He also says he is in a hurry and gives you a deadline for<br/>\nreturning the full box to him.  I dont think anyone is killing him when he<br/>\nspawns , just that he is rare and only spawns a certain times and then goes<br/>\naway again.   hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nRexus Maximus,   Veeshan.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:20 AM 12/29/99 +1300, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbuckingham@...\">jbuckingham@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Watchman Drexlin - this is a new quest, where one of the guys the<br/>\n&gt;Gemchoppers hall who previously never said anything now directs you to find<br/>\n&gt;Watchman Drexlin near Qeynos. According to Allakhazam&#39;s site, he spawns<br/>\n&gt;near/on the stone bridge between north and south karana, on the north<br/>\n&gt;Karana side and gives you a quest to kill Tiny Skeletons. I&#39;ve never been<br/>\n&gt;able to find him, probably due ot the sheer number of powergaming weenies<br/>\n&gt;that are KoS to gemchoppers from killing gnome guards, so he probably<br/>\n&gt;doesnt last too long once he pops. Has anyone managed to complete this<br/>\n&gt;quest yet? Is he always there unless someone kills him, or does he only<br/>\n&gt;spawn at certain times of the day... I&#39;m hoping the later, cos it really<br/>\n&gt;bugs me when people kill quest creatures - I still remember when I was<br/>\n&gt;young and I could only do the report quests after a server reboot, becasue<br/>\n&gt;the guard killers would often kill Joogl Doobraugh as well, and he has a<br/>\n&gt;really long spawn time..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
