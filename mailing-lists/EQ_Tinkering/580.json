The only<br/>\n&gt; way to make pie-tins is through smithing or pottery.  Being a master potter is<br/>\n&gt; a huge advantage for you, as you can make the pie tin and make the compass.<br/>\n&gt; That is what I will be doing tonight.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When someone says &quot;it&#39;s on the vendor next to the blue building in freeport&quot;<br/>\n&gt; they are mistaken.  Because you can buy the tin sketch (1pp and change) from<br/>\n&gt; the vendor to make the tin, but then most will just sell it back to the vendor<br/>\n&gt; since they are not in demand.  Thus why you see it occasionally off a vendor,<br/>\n&gt; someone actually made that tin and sold it back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your best bet is to become a master potter.

I understand that the main topic right now is finding combos for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the fishing pole, but I wanted to get off topic real quick.  So, my goal is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to make compasses for my guild and I was wondering is there any place to buy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pie tins?  I&#39;ve mastered pottery just to make them, but it would be soooo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; handy just to be able to buy them.
