Jogl was part of a consortium that attempted<br/>\nto build a bridge from Qeynos to Odus. I can also<br/>\nassume Prexus would be none to pleased about someones<br/>\nattempt to build a bridge through his oceanic domain<br/>\nand has asked his followers the Deepwater Knights to<br/>\nput an end to this bridge building venture. Not to<br/>\nmention Euridites in general would be upset about<br/>\nsomeone who sought to create a faster means of travel<br/>\nto their secluded city. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust because you don&#39;t understand the history of the<br/>\nquest doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s &quot;stupid&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbuckingham@...\">jbuckingham@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is a problem there though - Jogl is a target<br/>\n&gt; for a Paladin quest, the<br/>\n&gt; Deepwater Harpoon/Deep-Six Cutlass..
