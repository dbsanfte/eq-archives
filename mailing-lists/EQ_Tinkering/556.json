We got people who make arrogant comments and then the people <br/>\nwho are even dumber are the people who fill up ur mailbox with complaints <br/>\nabout one single email and turn it into a big event or something.  I wanted <br/>\nto share knowledge about tinkering and be taught knowledge but this list <br/>\nkeeps going in circles.  If you are sending something that you would not want <br/>\nin ur mailbox then ur just messed up.  Think about it as if someone was <br/>\nsending YOU an email that said &quot;screw that&quot; and that&#39;s it.  It would piss you <br/>\noff.  And it has pissed me off.  So I am leaving this list until the people <br/>\non it can learn to respect the power over other peoples mailboxes that they <br/>\nhave.<br/>\n<br/>\nHoly paladin of the 20th season.<br/>\n<br/>\nRojer Wilco</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
