But if Salvador was including<br/>\nthem in his spyglasses cheaply, then he had to making them (or being given<br/>\nthem by some unknown source).  I believe that the fishing pole is a real<br/>\ntinkerable item for this reason and that Salavador (if he can be trusted)<br/>\ntold us the cork isn&#39;t in the formula (thus, he knows it).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought. Could the collapsable fishing pole, just be a pole that is<br/>\ncollapsable?  I&#39;m not sure if I see a reel on it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpring, 15th level gnome on Veeshan (one more level to go! yay!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
