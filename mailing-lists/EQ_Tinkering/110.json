I know there is a skull that you can obtain<br/>\nfor a quest that has two open slots in it, where you<br/>\ncan place them in the skull and hit combine.  Now, I<br/>\nassume the quest is for the ruby eyes and I forget<br/>\nwhat and who it is for.  However, wouldn&#39;t it be nice<br/>\nif you could place the two staff parts into the slots<br/>\nand combine to make a staff of discord?  That&#39;s just a<br/>\nhigh hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould the staff of discord be &quot;tinkered&quot; or &quot;smithed&quot;?<br/>\n  Most weapons are smithed, and tinkering is competely<br/>\nun-finished and bugged.  So it is hard to say.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kryogen<br/>\n<br/>\n--- mstokes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mstokes@...\">mstokes@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: mstokes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mstokes@...\">mstokes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First the King of Akanon is a Gnomish Enchanter.

Hmmm must be at<br/>\n&gt; home.  Well I can&#39;t remember<br/>\n&gt; damage/delay but the effect is &quot;casts chaotic<br/>\n&gt; feedback&quot;.   This is NOT the staff<br/>\n&gt; of the Priest of Discord.
