So yes it WAS possible <br/>\nto max out tinkering at relative low cost since you dont need to buy what is <br/>\nneeded. And 400pp was too low (unless you can sell everything you make at <br/>\ngood price), more like a few thousand plats. Since then the aqualung parts <br/>\nwas removed from the sharks i believe, so i doubt it will be possible to get <br/>\nto 200 at this low cost nowdays. <br/>\n<br/>\nGagaliya Ba&#39;La&#39;Boom at Bristlebane<br/>\nGnome wizard of the 50th circle<br/>\nRetired master tinker<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. why the hell would ANYONE want to bother with tinkering it is a waste of <br/>\n15k+ cash with no rewards, hopefully they will fix it up sometime like with <br/>\njewelry and alchemy...should wait till then...my opinion anyway</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
