The Glowing Stien was NOT part of the game until less than<br/>\n&gt; 1 week before the spoiler went up.  It was the reward for the Brewers Compendium<br/>\n&gt; Quest.  The quest, until recently, was broken.  It returned Pungala&#39;s head (Ogre<br/>\n&gt; Head), not the compendium.  Many bartender&#39;s have tried this quest, and it was a<br/>\n&gt; bartender who first completed it.   On a side note,  GM&#39;s informed several players<br/>\n&gt; that the quest indeed worked, before the patch.  They then came back and said it<br/>\n&gt; will be fixed in an up coming patch (Another Lie)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No the quest always worked, the problem was that no one had used all the proper spells<br/>\non the Ogre to raise the faction high enough.  That is why an enchanter was required<br/>\nto do the quest, which was the part that the general population of norrath didn&#39;t<br/>\nfigure out until a week before the last patch.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Eron<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aeron@...\">aeron@...</a><br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom The Simpsons:<br/>\n<br/>\nBart:  Is there a Doggie Hell??<br/>\nHomer:  Well....
