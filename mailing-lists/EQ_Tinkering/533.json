I know this book exists and to prove it I&#39;ll give you the one formula I was able to get out of the person who has it. animated bait -- 1 cork, 1 spricket. the only purpose I can find for this is practice for non gnomes since the two things cost much more than bait and it&#39;s trivial for a gnome. personally I think the book is in Solusek&#39;s eye, the tinkering merchant has to be there for some reason. I just hope we don&#39;t have to kill a gnome for it.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    Fixer gnomish enchanter</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
