He raised his skill up by harvesting<br/>\nthe coral mesh from sharks (lvl 20ish) in the OOT.  He<br/>\nnever shared the information with anyone.  Now the<br/>\nmobs stopped dropping the items, and he&#39;s got a lock<br/>\non our market.  He also knows the location of diamond<br/>\ndust, but refuses to tell anyone where it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nPretty cool guy, eh?  He once told me that he&#39;d tell<br/>\nme where diamond dust was if I got him twinked to<br/>\nlevel 39.  Nope, not worth it to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you all want to complain about tinkering to<br/>\nsomeone, let Mauldoon, from Solusek Ro, know how you<br/>\nfeel.  Be forewarned that his ego is about the size of<br/>\nLong Island.  He gets a /rude everytime I see him.<br/>\n<br/>\nGazamel Prime<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n50th Gnome Warrior<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
