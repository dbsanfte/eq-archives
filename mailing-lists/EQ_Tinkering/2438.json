In a patch about a month ago Verant<br/>\nclaimed that they were changing this so that even the not so bright would<br/>\nbe able to succeed and gain skill relatively easier than before.<br/>\nWith reguards to tinkering I worked my skill up in the normal fashion<br/>\n(using the old rules for stats) with Flameless lanterns till 68, Standard<br/>\nBow Camms till 75, and then Stalking Probes till they trivialed (I forge<br/>\nthe number).  At that point the Thermal Cloak, Powdered Gloves and<br/>\nCatipults had not been able to be fashioned.  Aqualungs saw my skill up to<br/>\n111 where I stoped tinkering for a while due to cost.<br/>\nEventually Powdered Gloves to 122 and then Catipults to 135? put me in<br/>\nrange that I could make Rebreathers about 35 - 40% of the time.  Thankfully<br/>\nthe Warrior Epic Quest helped sales.  At first I had to charge 2.5k for<br/>\neach rebreather but have since pulled my prices down to 2k each.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the patch came into play that changed the way the stats affected<br/>\ntradeskills I noticed that I seemed to gain alot of skill, in my next<br/>\ntinkering session.  Prior to the patch I had gotten my skill to 139, and on<br/>\nthat first after patch session I attempted a dozen Rebreathers and saw my<br/>\nskill climb to 145 (between raises from aqualungs and rebreathers).<br/>\n<br/>\nStr: 107, Sta: 98, Agi: 111, Dex: 99, Wis: 82, Int: 204, Cha: 54<br/>\nThe Low Cha is because I have some other stat items that lower my Cha, I<br/>\nwould remove the negative Cha items when buying.  Before every tinkering<br/>\nsession I would ALWAYS get a CHA buff from a Shaman or Enchanter, and if<br/>\nEnchanter I would get an INT/WIS buff as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if my stats are aranged great or what just though I would<br/>\nshare some anctitdotal(sp?) evidence with my brother and sister Gnomes.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t go way out of the way to tinker.  I usually keep 2 - 4 Rebreathers on<br/>\nme, and I generally don&#39;t advertise except by word of mouth from my<br/>\nclients.  Since there will never be a shortage of warriors wanting to work<br/>\non their epic I just plan to tinker as needed and when Rebreathers<br/>\neventually trivial, great I will give some armor a shot.  I would expect<br/>\nRebreathers to trivial some where around 170 - 180.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack<br/>\nGnome Wizard (55) and Tinker (149)<br/>\nBrotherhood of the Crimson Knights ( www.bck.org )<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot; Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
