Must collect rare <br/>\ndrops from various low-level creatures (wasps, spiders, snakes).  Make very <br/>\ndifficult to apply poison to blade.  Only blade in primary slot can be <br/>\npoisoned.  Randomize when it will proc (if it does).  If the rogue is <br/>\nmoving when procing, it is interrupted.  Make it highly resistable by the <br/>\nmob.  Ungodly epensive.<br/>\nStep 1b: No One Complains About Being Useless - Warriors do not bitch about <br/>\nbeing outdamaged cause no one will ever see a poison actually work anyway...<br/>\nStep 2: Make Incremental Improvements- Make it so poison will proc on first <br/>\nstab and fix interruption bug.<br/>\nStep 3: Walk away for months to see if bitching continues - (In progress)<br/>\n<br/>\nCase Study: Aqua Lung<br/>\nStep 1a: Royally sucks - Must be high level (40+) in order to build skill <br/>\nup to a point to attempt to create aqua lung. Must be god awful expensive <br/>\nto attempt (250pp+).<br/>\nStep 1b: No One Complains About Being Useless - Make it a charge item (like <br/>\nstalking probes) so that druids, shaman, etc., don&#39;t complain about losing <br/>\nenduring breath.<br/>\nStep 2: Make Incremental Improvements: Unknown at this time, but might <br/>\nrequire some rare drop consumable (such as a decaying sharks left gill - <br/>\nright gills won&#39;t work).<br/>\nStep 3: Walk away (might skip step 2 and go directly here)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same can be done for pretty much everything they&#39;ve introduced. I don&#39;t <br/>\nlike it, but I live with it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
