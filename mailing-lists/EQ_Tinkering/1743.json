It mentioned somethin bout a clockwork <br/>\ndragon, now the dragon, I don&#39;t believe, not by a longhshot. But it also <br/>\nmentioned one of those lamp, star light post things, and when ya click it, it <br/>\nmakes a door opening sound and turns 90 degrees. I thought that it was worth <br/>\n2 seconds investigation, so I found the one that wasn&#39;t soinning next to the <br/>\nlake. I clicked it, and sure enough, it turned bout 90 degrees, and I heard <br/>\nthe door creak. I have no idea what this is about, knowing my luck, this <br/>\nlittle topic has popped up on the list before, but I&#39;m a recent addition to <br/>\nit. If it has, GOOD! someone please fill me in and quench my curiosity. If it <br/>\nhasn&#39;t, anyone have any ideas what it is, cause who knows, what if it has <br/>\nvalid importance, this is a long shot, but it may have somethin to with <br/>\ndiamond dust. I know I know, there&#39;s a bunch of you thinking I&#39;m prime full <br/>\nof it, but about the little door creak and star lamp thing, I&#39;m not, I invite <br/>\nyou to see it yourself. Anyways, I jus thought I&#39;d toss that one out there. <br/>\nIf it&#39;s been brought up before, forgive me for my insolence.<br/>\n<br/>\nYigoron,<br/>\n30 Magician,<br/>\nBristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
