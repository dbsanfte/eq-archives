I remember your rotten letter before you supposedly quit, I read<br/>\nyour apology and promise to provide information in the future, and I&#39;ve read<br/>\nyou flaming other people for being down on you and I never said a thing about<br/>\nany of it until now...because now you are making these absolute and unequivocal<br/>\nstatments about how there is no 3rd book etc. and I&#39;m simply not going to<br/>\nbelieve it just because you say it.  Nor am I going to believe it because you<br/>\nsay that some GM says it, and the reason for that is because we have already<br/>\ngotten conflicting statements from GMs!  One says tinkering is fine, another<br/>\nsays it is broken, someone else says there is a 3rd book and yet another source<br/>\nsays there isn&#39;t.   I still say nothing that comes from a Guide or even a staff<br/>\nGM means anything...good or bad.<br/>\nIf you took what I wrote as a flame maybe YOU should re-read what I wrote<br/>\ninstead of automatically going into defenseive mode.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua Bednarz wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Joshua Bednarz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thewhitemage@...\">thewhitemage@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GM&#39;s are told stuff. Guides are volunteers, but GMs are people that work<br/>\n&gt; actually in the Verant building, they know whats going on. They work at the<br/>\n&gt; building, answering petitions and get payed for it. It is part of thier job<br/>\n&gt; responsibilities to know what is going on, so that they do NOT give false<br/>\n&gt; information. Now...if you didn&#39;t read the message I sent here about that<br/>\n&gt; earlier, then you don&#39;t even have a right to be flaming me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;How do you know Josh? Are you one of Verant&#39;s game designers, planners,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;programmers, or developers?  Are you related to any of them and they have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;told<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you this is a fact?  Or are you as ignorant as the rest of us and just<br/>\n&gt; &gt;going by<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what someone told you?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;There are enough rumors and disinformation about the 3rd book, collapsible<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fishing pole, and fireworks going around that I wonder if anyone on any<br/>\n&gt; &gt;server<br/>\n&gt; &gt;really has solid information.  Until I recieve some word by an Everquest<br/>\n&gt; &gt;programmer or developer I&#39;m keeping my mind open.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Don&#39;t count any information you have been told by the guides or GM&#39;s as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;factual.  None of them created this game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
