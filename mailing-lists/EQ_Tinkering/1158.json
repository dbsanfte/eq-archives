I believe that the quest is from Manik in<br/>\n&gt; the Gemchopper area, but I could be wrong.  Usually he&#39;s guarded by a lot of<br/>\n&gt; fairies (a LOT of NASTY fairies), but somebody probably lured him to the<br/>\n&gt; zone.  You&#39;re supposed to kill him (to prevent fairies from getting gnome<br/>\n&gt; technology) and bring back proof of killing him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The observatory has always been there.  It&#39;s part of the lens quest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: D. F.

I was<br/>\n&gt; leaving Steamfont and he was sitting right by the zone border in Lesser Fay.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   He conned blue to me at 18, and since he didn&#39;t respond to my hails, I<br/>\n&gt; promptly killed him.  I was afraid that he would drop my faction with people<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; in Ak&#39;anon, but it dropped with fairies instead. All he had for loot was a<br/>\n&gt; rusty short sword. I have never heard of him nor seen him before today, has<br/>\n&gt; anyone else?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, has there always been a gnome observitory in Lesser Fay?
