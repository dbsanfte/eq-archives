I still <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what to think.  It appears as if some tinkered items, at <br/>\nleast, have had minimum levels added before you can use them!<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t thoroughly tested it yet but I&#39;ve had 2 reports back from <br/>\ntwinked newbies stating that they could not use the effect from the <br/>\ntelescopic eyepatches.  They received some message essentially stating <br/>\nthat they needed to be higher level to use the item.  I don&#39;t remember <br/>\nthe exact wording but I think it was the normal one you get for proc <br/>\nitems when you are under level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure we all know how much these tinkered items overpower characters <br/>\nand what a threat giving them to newbies is.  Sure, right!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat next, are they going to make you need to be level 20 before you <br/>\ncan ignite the fireworks because you can use them to pull at close <br/>\nrange?  I see the fireworks being able to pull as more of a threat to <br/>\nclass balance than the use of glimpse gained from spyglasses and <br/>\ntelescopic eyepatches.  *sigh*  It seriously puts a crimp in selling <br/>\nthem now since most people buying anything on older servers are <br/>\nalternate characters, frequently twinked, and able to get get better <br/>\ngear from their main characters easily enough already.  Its just <br/>\neasier to buy them from a readily available source rather than have to <br/>\ntransfer yet more gear back and forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf other items now have a minimum level to use their effects (maybe <br/>\naqualungs do now too?) it would be nice to start a list of what items <br/>\nhave level minimums and what that level min. is so we can warn <br/>\nprospective buyers before wasting our time and theirs.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
