I suddenly want to be a tinkerer<br/>\nagain!  It sounds as if there were two underwater breathers (aqua lung and<br/>\nrebreather)... or was it two parts to facilitate underwater breathing?  (all<br/>\nthis assumes that the info is correct)  If there are two parts one might<br/>\ncontrol the number of charges you have left?  Or they both let you breath<br/>\nunderwater but one might be unlimited and the other limited?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first I thought that if the item was not unlimited then it would be<br/>\nvirtually useless because everyone would just get a fishbone earring, but if<br/>\nthe fishbone earring was REAL hard to get (or maybe made limited, hehe) then<br/>\nmaybe people would want the scuba gear instead... and we could have repeat<br/>\nbusiness selling the scuba refills. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought I had was on the fishing pole.  Does anyone remember that<br/>\ndevice someone made that would fish for them when they were away from their<br/>\ncomputer?  What was that thing called?  Anyway he had it setup so that he<br/>\ncould make all kinds of money fishing while he went down to the pub and had<br/>\na beer.  It just kept clicking on the keys and the mouse button.  Verant<br/>\nmade the pole break so that you couldn&#39;t do that anymore.  So it is unlikely<br/>\nthat the collapsible fishing pole will ever be unbreakable.  Besides since<br/>\nany race can make it, if it was truly profitable then we would have<br/>\nbarbarian fishing pole muscling in on our turf.  But perhaps a collapsible<br/>\nfishing pole/animated bait combo would raise your skill level or you<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t lose your bait as often... something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAkel, gnome wizard<br/>\nBertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
