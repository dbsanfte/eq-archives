Goblin Captain- high 20s- drops some of it<br/>\n&gt;(Boots and Gloves), some of it comes from Gnome Clockworks- Clockwork EXG <br/>\n&gt;(drops<br/>\n&gt;shield and Breastplate- if you can&#39;t see the shield she has BP).  This EXG is<br/>\n&gt;wanders around and is totally immune to spells of all types, plus he hits hard<br/>\n&gt;for a level 30 or so MOB.  I&#39;ve seen a level 50 cleric solo it (yes cleric<br/>\n&gt;fighting with melee only then healing himself), but it was a tough <br/>\n&gt;fight.  Easy<br/>\n&gt;with a couple of real tanks.  There are rumors of other pieces out there, but<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve never seen equipped or looted any myself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Best piece for a cleric/shaman/druid comes from the EXG- the Charred Guardian<br/>\n&gt;Shield is 10ac +9 wis </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
