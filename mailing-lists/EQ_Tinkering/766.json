In<br/>\n there was a huge gnome, the size of a woodelf, which<br/>\n I�ve never seen or heard about before. His name was<br/>\n some typical gnome name, with a four letter first<br/>\n name, and Fiddlebiddle or something as his surname.<br/>\n When I hailed him he said something like: &quot;Don�t you<br/>\n find the girls in Kelethin sweet as their wine?&quot; I<br/>\n tried to ask him different things, but he didn�t<br/>\n react. I also tried to give him elven wine, but he<br/>\n only said &quot;thank you&quot;. I can�t remember what he<br/>\n conned, but I wouldn�t have killed him anyway,<br/>\n probably bad faction. <br/>\n Does anyone have any experience or information about<br/>\n this guy? Could he be tinkering related? This happened<br/>\n after the last patch.<br/>\n <br/>\n Also, concerning the gnome spelunker in Unrest: You<br/>\n say he KOS everyone, but has any necro tried to go<br/>\n near him? If there are any high level necro�s on this<br/>\n list, would they be interested in trying to get in<br/>\n touch with him?<br/>\n <br/>\n Also, about gathering tinkering info: Wouldn�t it be a<br/>\n good idea to gather all info we found about all the<br/>\n NPC gnomes in Norrath on a web-page? What all gnome<br/>\n merchants sold, what quests they are related too and<br/>\n so on? What factions do you get if you kill them, who<br/>\n do they KOS and not? <br/>\n Anyone interested in doing this?<br/>\n <br/>\n Piip Ignatz<br/>\n rogue of the 24th grade<br/>\n Innoruuk server &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a level 27 necro and I tried to go in there and I hailed him from <br/>\nunder the water.   He didn&#39;t attack me and he was indifferent but with in <br/>\nseconds about 2 monks a barb and a drybone all jumped me and chased me out of <br/>\nthe river.   He is surronded by nasty things.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
