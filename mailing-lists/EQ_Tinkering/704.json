Cams give a<br/>\ndecent profit but don&#39;t expect them to give back all or even part of the<br/>\nplat you put into the skill.  The spyglass is actually a fairly &#39;good&#39;<br/>\nitem, but for a NON-MAGIC class.  An unlimted charges magic item is just<br/>\nfun to have, even if the efect isn&#39;t that great.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with tinkering is that if you want to merchant your items to<br/>\nPCs, there is a very, very limited market for every item.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line tinkering is more of an &#39;adds flavor&#39; skill than anything else.<br/>\n Myself and a few others on this list I know took up this skill because we<br/>\nsimply got sick of monster killing, had a chunk of plat sitting in the bank<br/>\nand said &#39;hey, since nobody else has tried this skill let&#39;s see if we can<br/>\nfigure it out.&#39;  Well, as we&#39;ve found out, the skill isn&#39;t worth it<br/>\nprofit-wise, and that as you said Verant doesn&#39;t care or even know anything<br/>\nabout the skill for that matter.  In any case, its still fun to work on now<br/>\nand again and search for the missing item/books, but yep it does get old<br/>\nafter awhile, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Luke<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 08:41 AM 10/4/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Zach Heaven &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zheaven@...\">zheaven@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well so I am level 31, I bumped my INT down to 151 and my WIS up to 105 to<br/>\n&gt;attempt tinkering.
