Just look at the pics on<br/>\nthe tinkering site.  The rebreather is the one that has a perpetual enduring<br/>\nbreath effect.  Breath of the dead is a self only necro spell.  Obviously<br/>\nthere so that you don&#39;t use the charges to cast the effect on somebody else.<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what the difference is in duration (having never played a necro<br/>\npast 7th) but it&#39;s quite possible it&#39;s longer than enduring breath.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Chris Rider &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:baladoreq@...\">baladoreq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso about buying 50 enduring breath potions,<br/>\nsupposedly the charges in the aqualung last much<br/>\nlonger then enduring breath</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
