I ran this by them twice saying <br/>\n that a couple of the guides had said that some parts of it were broken and <br/>\n they told me that it was working fine.  Just thought I would share that info <br/>\n with you guys. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n     I think that what is happening here is that the initial aspects of <br/>\ntinkering are working. As we know we CAN make some items. Therefore some <br/>\nguides say that yes, it is working. On the other hand, It is broken as far as <br/>\nthe more advanced items .. broken meaning that there IS NO recipe. Some <br/>\nguides seem to know this. As much work that has been put into this I&#39;m quite <br/>\ncertain that if it were working correctly it would be common knowledge by now.<br/>\n     I think we need to really start pushing this issue with the GM&#39;s in a <br/>\nFRIENDLY manner, hoping they will put it in their reports to Verant. Also the <br/>\n&quot;Feedback&quot; option must be used to its fullest potential. Everytime I sign on <br/>\nfrom now till I see a recipe I will send feedback regarding this potentially <br/>\nwonderfull skill. Its easy for them to put this issue on the back burner, but <br/>\nif they see feedback (Constructive feedback) everyday from many many gnomes <br/>\nit will have to be moved up their ladder of priorities. Until then nothing we <br/>\ndo will work.<br/>\n<br/>\nGazu</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
