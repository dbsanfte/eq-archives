I have seen and read and watch everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy conclusions on Level CAP for tinkering skill is as follow:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has the same exact scheme and Spell Caster Research...<br/>\n<br/>\nit start at 16 (the same)..you can only get 1 level of skill up at 16th.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn research, I could not TRAIN anymore point until I hit 20th.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeem to the same with all the tinkering story.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you hit 20th, you could train 5 points...and every level 5 more <br/>\npoints...(or was it every 4 levels)..<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, from what I read, what happened seem to conform with my theory.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is you guys feedback?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the info.
