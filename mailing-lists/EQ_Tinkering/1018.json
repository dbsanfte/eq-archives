If I ever met you in real life, I would<br/>\ncharge<br/>\n&gt; you full speed and attack you out right, I wouldn&#39;t care if you were a<br/>\nhuge,<br/>\n&gt; 700 ton sumo, or a muscle bound Goldberg-wannabe, or if you were a weak<br/>\n&gt; frail, dying old granny, or whatever. I would make a swift attampt to kick<br/>\n&gt; you with (I&#39;d be wearing me wonderful cleats of course)  all my evil<br/>\nhatred<br/>\n&gt; and rage I have sucesessfully built up my entire life. I&#39;d attempt to kick<br/>\n&gt; you in the face, which, if succsessful would probably send you to the<br/>\nground<br/>\n&gt; in pain, then I wouldn&#39;t stop. I&#39;d beat you around, crush your ribs, kick<br/>\n&gt; you where it hurts till there wasn&#39;t even enough for the docters to scrap,<br/>\n&gt; making it so wouldn&#39;t ever be able to have any more bastard offspring to<br/>\n&gt; polute the world, then I&#39;d crush your face a little more, mutilating it<br/>\n&gt; beyond reccognition, and do a little bit more for good measure. Why?<br/>\n&gt; Because, you are a bastard. I&#39;d be one too if I did that, but frankly I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t care, because I hate you, bastard. Yes yes, hate. Hate is used so<br/>\n&gt; much, but it is so often not used correctly, true hate is like true love,<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; is an extremely powerful thing, but it is also extremely rare, for it is<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; exact opposite of ture love. I truely hate you. Now you look up at what I<br/>\n&gt; said I would do to you, and you ask yourself, what could cause someone to<br/>\n&gt; want to do that? Well, it was your horrible, totally unnesassary words<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; you said so horribly about me. Now, really think to yourself, do you feel<br/>\n&gt; GOOD that you said something so bad,so HORRIBLE that you made a person<br/>\n&gt; TRUELY HATE you?<br/>\n&gt; I hope you don&#39;t think this is funny because it is not at all. I hope you<br/>\n&gt; are sorry for doing that, you must be a truely horrid person if you could<br/>\nso<br/>\n&gt; quickly make someone hate you like you have to me. And if you think it is<br/>\n&gt; funny, or don&#39;t care, then you are a truely sick person too. People like<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; are so terribly sick, and don&#39;t deserve the very oxygen they breath. I<br/>\nwish<br/>\n&gt; to never hear from you again. If I never even think about you even in my<br/>\n&gt; subconcious again, it will be WAY to soon. Just get out of my life, and<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t even bother replying to this message becasue I&#39;m quittingthis letter<br/>\n&gt; right now so I don&#39;t have to hear from you again. I hope you are happy<br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; this horrible sick, disgusting thing you have done, I hope you&#39;re real<br/>\n&gt; happy...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
