Firstly, he had to go and get the<br/>\n&gt; molds from The Feerrott, cuz the Freeport shop only has medium molds.<br/>\n&gt; Apparently there is no forge down there.  Secondly, it&#39;s nearly impossible<br/>\n&gt; for me (skill 110 ish) to make about four of the banded armour pieces.<br/>\n&gt; Thirdly, failures cost between 4pp and 6pp.  After three trips to the<br/>\n&gt; Feerrott for the troll, and literally hours of real time, I had made his<br/>\n&gt; banded at a loss to me of 100pp.  Oh, and I gained 2 points of skill.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ah well, I&#39;ll stick to jewellery and Steins I think.  I made the 100pp back<br/>\n&gt; in 1/2 hour from jewellery, and then sold a Stein for 300pp :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ian aka Poggin the Mostly-Deflated-but-now-Partially-Reinflated Gnome. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
