Trade skill items are not <br/>\nusually found in stores, save the compass, but that is only in a few remote <br/>\nstores. I just think that maybe we are mising somethings, maybe a quest? You <br/>\nknow, some quests are not given, or even talked about unless you have high <br/>\nfaction, so maybe if your faction with King Ak&#39;Anon is warmly, he talks to <br/>\nyou and gives you a quest. Might be the same with others, you have to raise <br/>\nfaction high enough, and one of them might give you a quest.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
