You tinker a <br/>\npet-in-a-box which wighs, lets say 25. when you want a pet you right click <br/>\nthe boc. the box&#39;s weight drops to .5, and in about 30 seconds of cast time a <br/>\npet apears. to make the pet refold and go back in it&#39;s box, you right click <br/>\nthe box again, and afyer another 30 seconds of cast time the pet folds up and <br/>\ngoes in it&#39;s box. to make sure ppl dont take advantage of ee bags you make <br/>\nthe box count as a container. if you zoe w/out folding ur pet your pet will <br/>\ndisapear. Also weight and cast times of the pet and box will very from it&#39;s <br/>\ncost, power, and level. IE a level 16 tinkered pet would have a 15 second <br/>\ncast, and weigh 10, but is the same as a 16 mage earth pet. however a lv 30 <br/>\ntinkered pet would have acast time of 120, and weigh 40.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
