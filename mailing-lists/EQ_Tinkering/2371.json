I tend to give good loot <br/>\nitems to friends.  I&#39;m sure I could have gotten a mint for the Sword of the <br/>\nMorning I looted (was offered such), but a guildmate is a high level <br/>\npaladin and really wanted the sword.  So I gave it to him.  Now I&#39;m out <br/>\n50,000pp, but it doesn&#39;t bother me.  Given that its 220pp per attempt on <br/>\naqualungs and no one wants them, I&#39;ve pretty much stopped trying to raise <br/>\nmy tinkering skill pass the catapult trivial point.  Just don&#39;t have that <br/>\nkind of cash lying around.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:56 AM 11/28/2000 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;In a message dated 11/27/00 5:31:52 PM US Mountain Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcs0001@...\">jcs0001@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yeah, but at what levels does this start happening? i mean cmon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Somewhere around 45 money became a nonissue.

I<br/>\n&gt;still stay at 5k or so avg but if I would sell items rather than give them<br/>\n&gt;away to friends I would alwyas have lots more :) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
