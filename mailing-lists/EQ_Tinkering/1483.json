The person who looted it never mentioned it not being the exe axe and<br/>\nthis is the first time I have ever heard of a critter not having a graphic for a<br/>\nweapon it has, it was also my second time in lower guk.  As for the pet thing it<br/>\nmay have been a fluke I don&#39;t know as I don&#39;t play anything that uses pets so I<br/>\ncan&#39;t tell you, but I did clearly see from the executioner &quot;guarding with my<br/>\nlife oh splendid one&quot; Mersinaz even laughed because we didn&#39;t know what he was<br/>\ndoing at first.  AND WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO INSULT ME AT LEAST GET THE NAME<br/>\nSPELLED RIGHT!!!!   As for the pets I am pretty sure the guy who has the<br/>\ninformation attained it though illegal methods because he seems very greasy and<br/>\nprobably won&#39;t ever tell me but I am gonna try and when I get it the person who<br/>\ndoubted me doesn&#39;t have to use it<br/>\n<br/>\nEfrieum<br/>\n35 warrior<br/>\nby the way congratulations Piip on 34</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
