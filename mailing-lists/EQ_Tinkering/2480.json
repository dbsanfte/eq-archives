Yes, I know what<br/>\ncatapults are for.  Unfortunately they don&#39;t do anything, they&#39;re just one<br/>\nmore item in a list of items that only exist as a &quot;less expensive&quot; way of<br/>\ntraining up the skill. :(  Still, I&#39;ll tke having useless skill-up items<br/>\nover going back to that long stretch between<br/>\ngem-cutters-aqualungs-rebreathers.  <br/>\n<br/>\n   One would almost think gemcutters were skill-up items as well but they<br/>\nhave that one hard to get item meaning they aren&#39;t really that at all.<br/>\nVerant people have alternatively waffled on statements as to whether or not<br/>\nthe gemcutter has an actual, functioning use but no one seems able to find.<br/>\nI think the &quot;actual use&quot; they ascribe to it is as an item meant to drive<br/>\ntinkers nuts trying to figure out what it &quot;does&quot; when it doesn&#39;t &quot;do&quot;<br/>\nanything. :P<br/>\n<br/>\n   Its good to see the list getting a bit active again, even if there isn&#39;t<br/>\nreally much going on to be active about.  Maybe with more support rolling in<br/>\nwe can get more nice tinkered items in or, at the least, make some of the<br/>\nold useless ones useful again if we put our voices behind the desire.<br/>\n<br/>\nShade and sweet water,<br/>\nMuddletupper</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
