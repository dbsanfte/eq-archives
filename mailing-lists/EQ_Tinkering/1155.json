If these are in<br/>\nfact new tinkering components and now required to make the scuba gear it&#39;ll<br/>\nbe quite a project.  With a cost like that its safe to say it probably is<br/>\nthe same as a Fishbone earring, as well as an excellent money sink hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nYou lacked the skills to fashion the items together.  lol<br/>\n<br/>\n-Luke<br/>\nTinkering site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqportal.com/tinkering\">http://www.eqportal.com/tinkering</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:14 AM 10/29/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Paul McClung &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:p.e.mcclung@...\">p.e.mcclung@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If the hinge is part of the formula, its going to be expensive to just<br/>\n&gt;randomly try things to see if they work.
