I was <br/>\nleaving Steamfont and he was sitting right by the zone border in Lesser Fay. <br/>\n  He conned blue to me at 18, and since he didn&#39;t respond to my hails, I <br/>\npromptly killed him.  I was afraid that he would drop my faction with people <br/>\nin Ak&#39;anon, but it dropped with fairies instead. All he had for loot was a <br/>\nrusty short sword. I have never heard of him nor seen him before today, has <br/>\nanyone else?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, has there always been a gnome observitory in Lesser Fay? I don&#39;t ever <br/>\nremember seeing it there.<br/>\n<br/>\nXisten</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
