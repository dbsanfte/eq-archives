Verant needs to throw money at things like<br/>\nprocess control and testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Im talking Clockwork Pets Here.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Clockwork pets were supposedly in beta, but were removed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To make things more balanced, Tinkering could be made a Race-Specific <br/>\n&gt; Specialty-Class. This would work by keeping Tinkering a Gnome trait <br/>\n&gt; available to ALL GNOMES, but those Gnomes that choose to become a <br/>\n&gt; MASTER-TINKERER would have to coose to do so as a CLASS just like a <br/>\n&gt; Magic-User has to choose what type of caster he wants to be, a Gnome <br/>\n&gt; would have to choose between being a normal class of Gnome, or a <br/>\n&gt; MASTER-TINKERER.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re saying here.  Tinkering is a SKILL, not a<br/>\nCLASS.  Are you saying that all gnomes would have to change classes to a new<br/>\n&quot;Tinkerer&quot; class?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &#39;unbalancing&#39; part came in because the ability to have a clockwork pet<br/>\ngives pets to the classes that don&#39;t already get pets.  Even if you limit it<br/>\nto gnome-only, you are faced with gnome rogues, warriors, and clerics<br/>\ngetting pets.  Pets are useful.  Even my dirt-stupid enchanter pet is quite<br/>\na large edge.<br/>\n<br/>\nPasketti, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
