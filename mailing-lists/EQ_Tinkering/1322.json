I would never ever selll a aqua lung for 400 pp, thats just insane and plain stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\n900-1000 pp for it is fair i think  and   with a note with it that if they come back for an uppgrade to Rebreather for say 1000 more + componet cost. That would be around 1600 pp i think, is that right ?<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont sell the fishing pole and those outher low skill items outher if anyone order it, i get to many failures even  on trivial items to be worth making them and selling them at a large scale. Take Bow cam�s for example, i gor an order of 8 cam�s it took 12 tries to make 8, thats 4 failures and i sold them for 25 pp each, it�s almost nno profit at all so     in the futare i�m going to charge 30 pp for them i think if i even sell them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAskur of Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Monica Bradlee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mbradlee@...\">mbradlee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, November 13, 1999 1:32 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Aqualung Sales<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Monica Bradlee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mbradlee@...\">mbradlee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fairy guards were blue to me at 30, the princess was white to me.  On<br/>\n&gt; Aqualungs you guys are selling them ALL WRONG!!!!!  I have 15 orders at 1kpp<br/>\n&gt; each for a 50 charge item, yes 1,000pp per lung.  you need to make it seem<br/>\n&gt; as though this is the most difficult thing in the world to make never sell<br/>\n&gt; them directly either only take orders for them.  I have so many level 50<br/>\n&gt; druids who want them because they hate having to carry enough fish scales<br/>\n&gt; for their party.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Efrieum<br/>\n&gt; level 32 warrior<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
