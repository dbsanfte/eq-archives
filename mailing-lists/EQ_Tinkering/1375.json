Out of 10 attempts,<br/>\ni succeeded on 4 of em.  I then attempted to make 4 Rebreathers... Failure on all four...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother 4000pp gone and not ONE point of skill advancement.  Int is 182, wis is 100, lvl 50 character.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of you have any tips for me, let me know, im very close to just giving the damn skill up, ive got over<br/>\n13K pp invested into it and im quite frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\nSurastik Shrieker<br/>\nLvl 50 Gnome Necromancer<br/>\nCazic Thule Server<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
