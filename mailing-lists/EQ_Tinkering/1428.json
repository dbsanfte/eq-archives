So I went on to aqualungs.  10 attempts produced 2 aqualungs.<br/>\nNo skill raises.  I had a Intel of 167, Wis of 137 and bought the items with<br/>\n131 charisma (best price possible for my faction).  At this point I am<br/>\ndoubting Wisdom has much to do with successful creations.  Am I haven&#39;t bad<br/>\nluck here?  Or is a 80% failure rate common?  I can&#39;t even imagine trying a<br/>\nrebreather at this rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering if we need to find a item that has better success rate than<br/>\naqualungs to get skill higher.  But seems to be none to help with this.  Is<br/>\nanyone out there over 110 skill yet?  If so, give us some insight on costs<br/>\nand failure ratings.  At this rate, I need to sell aqualungs for thousands<br/>\nof PP rather than hundreds.<br/>\n<br/>\nZebbi D&#39;Arcanus<br/>\n(45th Wizard of E&#39;Ci)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webmaster@...\">webmaster@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webmaster@...\">webmaster@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 17, 1999 3:26 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Tinkering] A tale of woe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webmaster@...\">webmaster@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough this is my first post to this list, ive been reading em everyday<br/>\nfor the last few weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too am an aspiring tinkerer (skill 106) and I have successfully made Lungs<br/>\nand Rebreathers alike.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell tonight, after a week of work, I took my 4000pp and went to make some<br/>\nlungs.
