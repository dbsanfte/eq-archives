I totally agree that it <br/>\nwould make the game faction useless in many aspects. About the druid spell <br/>\nshare wolfform it only makes you non KoS to undead, as in Unrest or <br/>\nMistmoore. And if you stay in Mistmoore to long, you will still get your <br/>\nfaction down so much that you are KoS even in wolfform (dunno about Unrest, <br/>\nnever liked that place much :P), while if enchanter illusions would make you <br/>\nnon KoS in just about any zone in game, ending with shared illusion:skeleton <br/>\n(non KoS in Hate). Illusion Werewolf might also be a lil too much as it has <br/>\na &quot;SoW&quot; effect to it that also works indoors. One would say that its not <br/>\nfair to other classes that enc can do all this but well, enc can do just <br/>\nabout nothing solo, so if they are indifferent or fast it dont do them much <br/>\ngood in a dungeon anyhow as their teammates are not. And even if i am wrong <br/>\nabout them not beeing able to solo (after lvl 30 or so) the enc class is a <br/>\nGROUP class like no other (well maybe clerics :P) and they just plain <br/>\nshouldnt be soloing anyhow :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd someone PLEASE find diamond dust soon, i need to get my skill up bu <br/>\nsomething cheaper than aqualungs :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Sandortien, 50th season wiz of Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
