I do understand how people would <br/>\nwant to keep their trade secrets to themselves, there is a lot of money to <br/>\nbe made from the spyglasses, I know I want one.<br/>\n<br/>\nNevertheless, I am looking into setting up an &quot;open-source&quot; (most <br/>\nappropriate term) web site that will contain all available tinkering <br/>\ninformation.  I need to find an ISP that supports Frontpage extensions (I&#39;m <br/>\nnot a web guru so I need to use something that is simple to use and has a <br/>\nlot of built in features).  I will keep this list posted on the status of <br/>\nthe site.  I will use this mailing list also as the sites mailing list so I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to pay someone $20 a month for that feature.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it doesn&#39;t matter much, because as soon as someone leaks the plans <br/>\nfor the fishing pole, it will be spread around very quickly and Gnomad will <br/>\npost it to his site since the cats already out of the bag.  However, I hope <br/>\n&quot;our&quot; site somehow will become an instrument to get people to open up (my <br/>\nhopes aren&#39;t high though).  Gnomad mentioned his site reached 10,000 <br/>\nhits.  That means a lot of people were visiting the site, therefore, I know <br/>\na lot of people are disappointed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to Gnomad, please do not take this as an insult or anything.  I respect <br/>\nyour decision to keep the information secret.  That is your choice, not <br/>\nmine.  More power to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 08:16 AM 08/10/1999 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Jake Denley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaked@...\">jaked@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was asked by someone to make me a fishing pole yesterday.
