So until they get a patch,<br/>\nforget about the fishing pole.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMalbus <br/>\n30 Wizard (wow, 30 sucks)<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:39 PM 10/2/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Nick Bock&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nickbock@...\">nickbock@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Heya guys,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Like i said quite a while ago, the gnome named Salvadori on Xegony is the<br/>\n&gt;one that has learned the secret of how to make the collapsable fishing pole,<br/>\n&gt;but is not willing to share the recipe.  He&#39;s only one who can make them<br/>\n&gt;that I know of.  Just a reminder of that info for those of you that weren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;on the board, or who don&#39;t remember.  Also, yes, he is not on very often<br/>\n&gt;anymore.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Xalastile<br/>\n&gt;lvl 22 magician (retired)<br/>\n&gt;xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I went ahead and talked to a gm and a bunch of higher level gnomes.  From<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the high levels gnomes I got the impression that tinkering was a complete<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and total waste of time.  In fact one told me he didn&#39;t do it because the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; skill sucked and it wasn&#39;t worth it.  I did get a name from a high level<br/>\n&gt;&gt; gnome who said he knew someone who used to tinker a lot.  He said the guys<br/>\n&gt;&gt; name was salvadori or something like that and that he rarely came on.  He<br/>\n&gt;&gt; does however come on every once in a while.  The other thing that I found<br/>\n&gt;&gt; out, from the gm&#39;s, was that the skill is not broken.  I asked every gm<br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; has been on for the past two nights and they all keep telling me it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt;&gt; broken.  Well that&#39;s my search so far.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Marcoux<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
