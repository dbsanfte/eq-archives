I&#39;m new to the list, just signed up today.  Anyway this is a question for any mathematic wizards out there.  We have a total of 8 slots in the toolbox and a total of 12 items to use.  Does anyone know how many combinations that we can come up with?  Remember that this includes just having 1 item in the box or 2 or 3 etc. etc.  Well me personally I would just like to know for curiousity sake.  And don&#39;t worry you now have another helping hand in the search for the collapsable fishing pole recipie. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mike<br/>\n&gt; P.S. If we do find it imagine how much it can sell for. :) $$$$$$$$<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Xillitil of Povar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xillitil@...\">xillitil@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Tinkering of course<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; uhh...if i remember my math right,8 slots and 13 items(including empty)<br/>\n&gt; should be 13! - 5!...ummm...51,891,840 combinations...or is that<br/>\n&gt; permutations...and thats assuming we don&#39;t use anything less obvious like<br/>\n&gt; skins or something...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; guess we won&#39;t be doing an exhaustive search anytime soon....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Xillitil/Povar </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
