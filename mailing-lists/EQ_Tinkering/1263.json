This is how it should work. If it does not then it is broken.<br/>\nHe told me that hes going to talk this over  with the DV team and if i didnt hear anything from him then i should smack him around a little. He he he not realy . Iï¿½m going to hount him until he does not want to be a GM any more or they fix this. 1700 pp have i spent since reaching a skill of 80 and still no improvment. Today Caphys raised my skill to 81 to see if it was stuck in anyway but it didnt help 11 items, 4 failures and 200+ pp later i hadnt gained a point. He then summond tinkering stuff and started making items, starting at a skill of 0 gaining 2 points. At a skill of 50 gaining points. At a skill of 80 (where i am) where he got 1 point after 3 spyglasses.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo either my char is bugged or tinkering is bugged.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell this is for now and what i know. Tell me if you dont want to hear more about this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAskur Gnomish Wizard of Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Conrad Lesnewski &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:clesnew@...\">clesnew@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, November 06, 1999 2:46 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Arghhhhhhh<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Conrad Lesnewski &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:clesnew@...\">clesnew@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The GM is mistaken.  Whether it&#39;s a bug or not, the Tinkering skill<br/>\n&gt; follows the same rules as Caster research.  The level is capped at<br/>\n&gt; (level -15) * 5.  The reason you didn&#39;t gain a single point is because<br/>\n&gt; at Level 31, 80 skill is your max.  Wait until Level 32 and try again.<br/>\n&gt; You should go up 5 pts and stop at 85.  Forget the /petition and /bugs<br/>\n&gt; about Aqualung charges, THIS is the problem we should be complaining<br/>\n&gt; about.  Tinkering should have the cap removed and made like every other<br/>\n&gt; trade skill.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Calbasil Psyrex of Ak&#39;Anon (Bertoxx)<br/>\n&gt; House of Silmindo<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Zinken wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Well i started the day with an skill of 80 and a lv of 31, i put<br/>\n&gt; &gt; down over 1100 pp in making stalking probes and spyglasses and my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reward was NOT 1 single point gained :-((((  This cant be right.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was told by GM Caphys on Veeshan that Tinkering is like any outher<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trade skill and i should be able to gain past 80 skill regardless of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my level after i get the skill at lv 16.
