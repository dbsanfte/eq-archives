If you go to the <br/>\ncazic-thule corner (www.cazic-thule.com) and look under raffle news you will <br/>\nsee some of the items up for raffle on Nov 2nd. Scroll down a bit and you <br/>\nwill see gnomish fireworks (4) a spyglass, a collapsible fishing pole, and <br/>\nsome other tinkered things. Obviously someone on my server knows how to <br/>\ntinker these items. I do not suggest you give up trying to hunt him out. <br/>\nBecause I doubt he would tell you. What this means that if these were not <br/>\ngiven by GM&#39;s then tinkering is not broken and eventually we will be able to <br/>\ntinker these things as soon as we find a logical recipe. Good luck.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
