I do enjoy the fact that someone was willing to share the secrets of that tinkering book with us. Now, on to your question about the quote you have posted:","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-948495912\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;From: &quot;Big Dave&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xceller@...\">xceller@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;MWA HA HA HA!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;There is no third book! You guys are wasting your time on trying to find<br/>\n&gt;it&quot; - who said this recently?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Boy, talk about famous last words.  God I love it when things like this<br/>\n&gt;happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do enjoy the fact that someone was willing to share the secrets of that <br/>\ntinkering book with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, on to your question about the quote you have posted:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe person known as Joshua Bednarz said the quote, multiple times if I <br/>\nremember correctly.  This is also the guy that claims his little brother <br/>\nposted as him, claimed to have gained supersecret important information <br/>\nabout tinkering, claimed to have communicated with important tinering <br/>\npeople, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust this person no more.  Everything he has said up to this point can be <br/>\nconsidered falsehoods.  I know not why he wasted the time of everyone on <br/>\nthis list, flooded their mailboxes with trash, or claimed to have any real <br/>\ninformation whatsoever.  If it indeed was a joke, his laugh upon us has <br/>\nseriously backfired.  To you, Joshua Bednarz, if that really is your real <br/>\nname, I salute you for a job well screwed.  I would hire you to work for the <br/>\nother guy.  I would ask you for a handshake, then say &quot;too slow&quot; and jerk my <br/>\nhand away.  I say &quot;neener neener&quot; to you and your descendants for 3 <br/>\ngenerations of twins.  I wiggle my bum at thee.  School children pass by and <br/>\nsnicker at you.  You would fail as court jester.  No one would come to your <br/>\nhanging.  When you go shopping, people hand you clues.  When the waiter <br/>\ngives you the check he says &quot;oh, its you, nevermind&quot;.  Girl scouts wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nwash your car at Hardees.  The gas station attendant won&#39;t give you the <br/>\nbathroom key, even if you pay him.  Dogs hump your leg at every bar and <br/>\ndance club.  Ugly women won&#39;t even date you.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou, sir, have been flamed.  Burn for TTL= -1.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now, for useful tinkering info.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 4 pieces from the gnomes in Solusek that might be logically useful <br/>\nfor tinkering: Small Power Source, Large Power Source, Functional Force <br/>\nModule, Broken Force Module.  The following combinations have failed to <br/>\nproduce anything:<br/>\n<br/>\nFunctional Force Module + Large Power Source<br/>\nBroken Force Module + Small Power Source<br/>\nBroken Force Module + Broken Force Module<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may ask why I tried such strange combinations but not a logical flow.  <br/>\nWell, the items don&#39;t load evenly.  I have a lot of broken pieces, one or <br/>\ntwo small power sources, and I used up the only functional force module and <br/>\nlarge power source I had.  So, if these really are tinkerable, it will prove <br/>\na pain to gather materials to use them.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhenglei Kai, of Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
