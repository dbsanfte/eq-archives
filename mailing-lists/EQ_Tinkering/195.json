The Evil<br/>\nEye is part of the Observer Staff Quest and originates at an Observitory.  The<br/>\nTelescope Lens Quest orignates in the Wizards? Guild and it requires you to get four<br/>\nlenses.  None of them are on Borxx.  Two are given to you by the observitories.  One<br/>\nis obtained by killing a 14ish (and nasty) DE in Freeport, and the last is on this<br/>\nmissing gnome.  Please also note that this quest will not be given to wizards above<br/>\nlevel 12.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Believe it , verant has this sick and twisted thing about making quests<br/>\n&gt; ungettable at higher levels, and impossible for low levels to actually<br/>\n&gt; solve, for instance this quest. one of the lens you need tog et from<br/>\n&gt; Borxx, a level *30*+ Evil Eye. With verants normal sense of rewards well<br/>\n&gt; get 20 exp pts, a faction adjustment and a tarnished dagger as reward,<br/>\n&gt; note this is a step up from the usual rusty dagger they give us.<br/>\n&gt;  another example (again gnome) get tergons spellbook, OK this spawns on<br/>\n&gt; a level 18 or so mob... your reward for solving the quest? a level 4<br/>\n&gt; mage spell. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
