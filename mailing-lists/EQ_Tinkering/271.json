Just on point? If you did tell us how so that we can try <br/>\nthat too. If no one on the list has risen even a point, then we REALLY need <br/>\nto petition about tinkering. We need to tell them to start working on it and <br/>\nget it at least as finished as brewing or another skill like that. I think <br/>\nwe are just going on a wild goose chaase here. We are probably looking for <br/>\nsomething that doesn&#39;t even exist yet. Anyways, tinkering needs to be <br/>\nchanged so that skill points can be gotten easier anyway. We need to get <br/>\nthis through to Verant. We should no longer just stand by, hoping Verant <br/>\nwill come through, and spending tons of money trying to get skill points. We <br/>\nmust act!<br/>\n<br/>\nSniffledoo Copperheart 15th rank warrior of The Scarlet Blade --<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
