( if he is a lvl 25<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ench he could not get very far into paw.)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - Maybe, it would make sense of a rare spawn farrie or somthing like that.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - Maybe that flying horse drops it ( i never killed it but I seen it once<br/>\n&gt;&gt; at lvl 35)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - Grizzelnot (??) I would guess a lvl 25 enchancer can kill him , I did at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; lvl 25, he is sometimes low lvl, and he does go thru paw, his pathing.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - maybe an aviak ?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Also a clue if he (/ooc What is Diamond dust?) in SK, he probobly got it in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; SK. so I dont think it may have been any zones that are close to SK.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ( At least now we know where to look )<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Also , to get more info out of that guy even if we dont play on F-Ro maybe<br/>\n&gt;&gt; we should creat a mule char and bug the sht out of that guy.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; just make a char then go /anon so he does not see your lvl. and start<br/>\n&gt;&gt; bugging him.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; also maybe he will reveal the location for some good cash ?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; he is lvl 25, those guys can be bought out easly.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Get great offers on top-notch products that match your interests!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Sign up for eLerts at:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    GRAB THE GATOR!
