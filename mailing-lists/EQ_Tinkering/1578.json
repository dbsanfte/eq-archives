Perhaps these are the rods needed for the thermal<br/>\n&gt; cloak...  I just received a patchwork cloak after completing the Red V<br/>\n&gt; quest - I&#39;ll try to do the Duster and scrap metal quests a few more times<br/>\n&gt; to get these Rods and try a few combinations.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I also have a Gnome Glow Rod.  I got it for turning in scrap metal.  As far<br/>\nas I can tell, it&#39;s just a light source.  I have had comments from people<br/>\nasking me what the heck I was carrying, so they don&#39;t seem to be that<br/>\ncommon.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoe D</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
