He&#39;s not a <br/>\ngnome. I mean why would we have a King that isn&#39;t a gnome? Or if he is the <br/>\nKing why doesn&#39;t he have anything on? He&#39;s naked (no visible items). Also <br/>\nwhen I went to the top of the King Akanon Palace I found something that looks <br/>\nlike an arrow. It points to the merchant that sells fishing stuff that is to <br/>\nthe left of the big waterfall near entrance.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
