Which of course, with the failure rate to make these items, will<br/>\n&gt; make me loose money.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As to tinkered pets, i dont think they can be made. I heard rumors on<br/>\n&gt; diamond dust beeing found in Kaladim, but I checked every merchant i could<br/>\n&gt; find, no luck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, i would like to know if anyone was albe to find the coral mesh from<br/>\n&gt; sharks in oot still. I mean, this guy that didnt want to share his info<br/>\n&gt; would of course say they dont drop anymore to keep em for himself if he<br/>\n&gt; accidentaly dropped that info..  I&#39;ll check it out myself too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Sandortien Stormwielder, 50th wiz of Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
