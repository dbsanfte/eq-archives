I believe that the quest is from Manik in<br/>\nthe Gemchopper area, but I could be wrong.  Usually he&#39;s guarded by a lot of<br/>\nfairies (a LOT of NASTY fairies), but somebody probably lured him to the<br/>\nzone.  You&#39;re supposed to kill him (to prevent fairies from getting gnome<br/>\ntechnology) and bring back proof of killing him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe observatory has always been there.  It&#39;s part of the lens quest.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: D. F.

I was afraid that he would drop my faction with people<br/>\n<br/>\nin Ak&#39;anon, but it dropped with fairies instead. All he had for loot was a <br/>\nrusty short sword. I have never heard of him nor seen him before today, has <br/>\nanyone else?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, has there always been a gnome observitory in Lesser Fay?
