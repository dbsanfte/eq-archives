","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1115491203\">a few simple questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Is there a third tinkering book on the normal servers?<br/>\n2) Are there recipes available that are not in the 2 books by the windmill?<br/>\n3) Are you planning on enhancing this skill in the near future?  The Distant<br/>\nfuture?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for taking the time to answer these questions for us.  We are a group<br/>\nof dedicated tinkerers who have been chasing our tails for several months now,<br/>\nand we are all getting pretty frustrated.  Several of us have had numerous<br/>\nconversations with different GM&#39;s.  Some have said the skill was broken, others<br/>\nhave said that it works perfectly.  If you could shed some light on this<br/>\nsubject we would all greatly appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank You Again<br/>\n<br/>\nM. Stokes<br/>\nAKA<br/>\nMalkin Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
