Never found out what it was triggering. It was <br/>\nmentioned a few months ago on this list when we were still looking desperately for the 3rd <br/>\nbook/fishing pole recipe. I don&#39;t remember anyone coming up with an answer about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nArkham, gnome necromancer (Bertoxxulous)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ** Original Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] an Idea<br/>\n&gt; ** Original Sender: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Yigman008@...\">Yigman008@...</a><br/>\n&gt; ** Original Date: Thu, 6 Jan 2000 22:26:36 EST<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ** Original Message follows... <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was readin a post, I discounted it as major B.S. but checked it out <br/>\n&gt; regardless since I was in Ak&#39;anon. It mentioned somethin bout a clockwork <br/>\n&gt; dragon, now the dragon, I don&#39;t believe, not by a longhshot. But it also <br/>\n&gt; mentioned one of those lamp, star light post things, and when ya click it, it <br/>\n&gt; makes a door opening sound and turns 90 degrees. I thought that it was worth <br/>\n&gt; 2 seconds investigation, so I found the one that wasn&#39;t soinning next to the <br/>\n&gt; lake. I clicked it, and sure enough, it turned bout 90 degrees, and I heard <br/>\n&gt; the door creak. I have no idea what this is about, knowing my luck, this <br/>\n&gt; little topic has popped up on the list before, but I&#39;m a recent addition to <br/>\n&gt; it. If it has, GOOD! someone please fill me in and quench my curiosity. If it <br/>\n&gt; hasn&#39;t, anyone have any ideas what it is, cause who knows, what if it has <br/>\n&gt; valid importance, this is a long shot, but it may have somethin to with <br/>\n&gt; diamond dust. I know I know, there&#39;s a bunch of you thinking I&#39;m prime full <br/>\n&gt; of it, but about the little door creak and star lamp thing, I&#39;m not, I invite <br/>\n&gt; you to see it yourself. Anyways, I jus thought I&#39;d toss that one out there. <br/>\n&gt; If it&#39;s been brought up before, forgive me for my insolence.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yigoron,<br/>\n&gt; 30 Magician,<br/>\n&gt; Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Get great offers on top-notch products that match your interests!<br/>\n&gt; Sign up for eLerts at:<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;** --------- End Original Message ----------- **<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
