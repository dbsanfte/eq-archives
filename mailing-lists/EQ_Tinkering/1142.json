I was looking<br/>\nthrough it a while back and there was a spell called aqua lung. My guess is<br/>\nthat this is what we are looking for. We might want to start asking &quot;what<br/>\nabout the aqua lung&quot; to all the gnome npc&#39;s. I am at work, so I can not<br/>\nverify that it was called aqua lung, but I am 95% sure thats what it was<br/>\ncalled. Can someone that knows how to use a hex editor verify this for me?<br/>\nOtherwise I have to wait until I get home from work.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
