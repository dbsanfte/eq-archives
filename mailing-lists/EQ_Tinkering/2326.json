I have one guild possibly ordering 18, and<br/>\nquoted them a price of 33k.(&lt;2k each).  The problem with selling them to<br/>\nthe public, is that fishbones sell for around 3k on E&#39;ci, and most people<br/>\ndo not want to give up whatever their headslot item is.  The weight is a<br/>\nHUGE concern for casters.  I will be glad when we can finally make <br/>\nsomething that is useful to the general public.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had thought the powergloves would be a good seller, but again, it is<br/>\nnot, being gnome only shot that down in a heartbeat.  Is anyone else<br/>\nconfused as to why they didn&#39;t make them like the rest of the armors<br/>\nseem to be.....small race.  Monks would love gnomish power gloves,<br/>\nas would most clerics, rogues, and some of the warriors I know.  I had<br/>\none guy offer me 500pp for a pair before he found out that they were<br/>\ngnome only.  =(<br/>\n<br/>\nGhirardelli<br/>\nMaster Tinkerer<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
