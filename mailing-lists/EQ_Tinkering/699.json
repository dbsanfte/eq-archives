You said this was a<br/>\nlong time ago, maybe he has changed his POV and will tell us now. Maybe if<br/>\nhe knows that we NEED this secret, he will tell us... he is on your friends<br/>\nlist, tell him ill pay him! 1000pp if he tells me! my god, i need to know<br/>\nNOW!! ahhhh..well, 1000pp if the formula works.. but you said you thought he<br/>\nwas telling the truth, ill give 1000pp before it works (if he sounds<br/>\ntrustworthy) maybe 1000pp is too steep.. thats all i have kinda.. maybe a<br/>\nfew 100 is a better deal.. Lindel is the correct spelling? ill start on<br/>\nveeshan today and find that monk. you said he didn&#39;t come on very much. this<br/>\nmight mean he has a other character (most likely a gnome) that he plays more<br/>\noften. lets try to find its name. For now, I think Lindel the monk is my<br/>\nbest bet so im gonna pester him till he tells me.. or maybe not.. ill be<br/>\nnice and start to cry.. Ill tell anyone if I find anything more out. if not,<br/>\ni wont post repeated info. Off to veeshan I go</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
