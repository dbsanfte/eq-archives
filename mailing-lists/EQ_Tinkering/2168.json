Gullerback is a gorilla<br/>\nthat can range from 46th to 52st level.  At 51 and 52 he can summon and he<br/>\ndoes hit quite hard.  Decent group of 50s can take him expecially if<br/>\nreverse kiting is used.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Mantles that are droped are kinda wuss gear for the level of Gullerback<br/>\nbut maybe they can be used in the making of the thermal cloak.  Just<br/>\nsomething to try.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Elder of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
