Obtain 4<br/>\nspare telescope lenses and return to guild master.  Reward in beta was a<br/>\nlevel 24 spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuest #2 Observer staff quest.  Originates in steamfont.  Kill 30ish level<br/>\nEye, return cornea (lens) and get a staff of the observer in return.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Pie tins are available in the blue building next to the bank in Free Port<br/>\n(If I remember correctly)<br/>\n* You can tinker below level 16 successfully.  (Verified last night) Woohoo<br/>\n<br/>\n* Toolbox is fixed.  Mine is sitting in the bank unbagged as we speak.<br/>\n* Still haven&#39;t found any leads on the other tinkering books, and I&#39;ve been<br/>\nthrough most of Freeport now.<br/>\n* They put a whole lot of new quest/skill related stuff in yesterday.  It<br/>\nmay be worthwhile to revisit the vendors in Akanon, Steamfont, and Lesser<br/>\nFaydark Observitory.<br/>\n<br/>\nFound out something interesting on stratististics.  One of the quests from<br/>\nGem Choppers hall (Warriors Guild) rewards people with Tattered armor.<br/>\nI&#39;ve only talked to 1 person who has done this quest and he recieved<br/>\nTattered cloth arm bands as his reward.  Maybe this is the place to obtain<br/>\nthe cloak.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nMalkin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
