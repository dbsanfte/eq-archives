Anyway this is a question for any mathematic wizards out there.  We have a total of 8 slots in the toolbox and a total of 12 items to use.  Does anyone know how many combinations that we can come up with?  Remember that this includes just having 1 item in the box or 2 or 3 etc. etc.  Well me personally I would just like to know for curiousity sake.  And don&#39;t worry you now have another helping hand in the search for the collapsable fishing pole recipie. :)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMike\r<br/>\nP.S. If we do find it imagine how much it can sell for. :) $$$$$$$$</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
