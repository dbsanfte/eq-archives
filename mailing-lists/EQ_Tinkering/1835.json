I belive you have to go to Halas<br/>\nand buy the dufrenite then take it to Rathe and have it crushed, after that<br/>\nhead home and try to get the components for the gemchopper together and<br/>\nmake it. As for the tattered gnomish cloak, well you have me. I belive that<br/>\nit may possibly be a tattered small cloak you have to use, and without a belt<br/>\nbecause it is not in caps like all the other components in gimblestans book. <br/>\nHowever this is just a suggestion and i am not certain that it will work. As<br/>\nto where to find the tattered small cloak, well um... i don&#39;t know. Ask around<br/>\nI am told it exists somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrundup PuddlejumperTinkerholic - 99 skill in Tinkering and brother to pooden</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
