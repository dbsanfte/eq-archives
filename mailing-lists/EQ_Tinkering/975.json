There are some runes on the surface of it that look like some of<br/>\n&gt;the runes that I&#39;ve seen in Tolkien&#39;s books.  I know Tolkien did a<br/>\n&gt;comprehensive language system using runes and such, but I&#39;m not enough of a<br/>\n&gt;fantasy geek to actually know any of the specifics.  Given that the clock <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;supposedly gnome built, it might have a tidbit of information on it.  The<br/>\n&gt;fact that it&#39;s in plain sight would make it a prime target for a designer<br/>\n&gt;with a sense of humor too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Someone on one of the eq stratics boards figured out what it said..<br/>\n<br/>\nsomething like<br/>\n<br/>\nQeynos<br/>\nGnomes of Akanon<br/>\n<br/>\nover and over and over and over and over.. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nCatbik Tinkerton</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
