This is for all those dumb, strong people (i.e. barbarians) <br/>\nout there that say they should be able to learn smithing as easily as <br/>\nsomeone who is smart but weak.  I didn&#39;t think stats affected success <br/>\nrate, but if anyone has any good experimental data that shows <br/>\notherwise, I&#39;d like to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have found is that when I boost INT up, I have a much better <br/>\nchance in increasing skill.  Duh!  I have tried dex to a small degree <br/>\nand didn&#39;t really notice any difference, but I didn&#39;t raise it as <br/>\nhigh as I had raised INT so there might still be some hope.  However, <br/>\nI don&#39;t think that the learning bonuses are cumulative, but rather <br/>\naffected by your highest stat.  So for most gnomes, it will be <br/>\neasiest to raise INT with regard to practicing tinkering.  I had been <br/>\nraising my int to about 115, but with some borrowed items I raised it <br/>\nfairly easily to around 145.  I didn&#39;t take down any stats, but it <br/>\ndid make a noticeable difference.  Keeping track of numbers makes it <br/>\nseem too much like work. :P  But now that I&#39;m into the grownup <br/>\ntinkering things I have to be a little more thrifty with my plat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my long term goals are to make watchman armor for myself.  <br/>\nNot that I would use it in battle, but it looks like it could freak <br/>\nout some folks.  They already freak out at a gnome warrior.  Wait til <br/>\nthey see me running around with those bug eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nNorbert Gearsmith<br/>\nlevel 39 and 8/10ths Gnome Warrior<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com\">EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com</a>, Jason Willoughby &lt;jwilloug@g...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On Tue, 9 Jan 2001 josh@m... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; High Int and Cha are indeed good for the purposes with which you <br/>\n </span></blockquote>associated<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; them, but the only factor that determines your sucess rate is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>your skill<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; level.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yak has insinuated that there are secondary stats that boost <br/>\n </span></blockquote>success rate,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but the only one known is str for smithing.
