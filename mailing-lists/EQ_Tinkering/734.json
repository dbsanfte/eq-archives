Sounds like <br/>\nan extensive search of akanon has yielded nothing fruitful. I myself have <br/>\nswam the depths in the past without finding anything.<br/>\nAs far as the inner circle goes, there is more then 1 guild that has this <br/>\ntype of set up. So i am assuming its a guild tagged or no, i would guess <br/>\ntagged.<br/>\nIts kind of a shame that if people have this information they wont share, its <br/>\nnot like we dont deserve to have special abilities we are gnomes!!<br/>\nDiwzz Singez<br/>\nTribunal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
