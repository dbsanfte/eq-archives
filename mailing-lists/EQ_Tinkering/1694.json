I am trying to sell them for 3250 on tunare.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers FizzWizz<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. To the guy that asked where all the component are for the lungs and rebreathers, check in the back of the necro guild in akanon, you should find a vendor in there somewhere...heh-heh...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
