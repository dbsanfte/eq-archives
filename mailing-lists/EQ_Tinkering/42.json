AKA can&#39;t put in <br/>\nbank, drop, trade, etc?  Also does anyone have a listing of what tinkering <br/>\ncomponents there are?  Are the Gizmos and sprockets used?  I travel a lot <br/>\nas a monk and I have never seen ANY other books.  I DO know there are 5 <br/>\nvolumes to the Alchemy books so maybe there are 5 to the tinkers.  Though <br/>\nthe alchemy ones are all in the same place.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to set up a site on my page for tinkering so am gathering any info <br/>\non it I can.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;-- Enigma --&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.door.net/enigma\">http://members.door.net/enigma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tcorenee [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:corenee@...\">corenee@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tMonday, June 07, 1999 2:26 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_tinkering@onelist.com\">eq_tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[EQ_Tinkering] rumors<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: corenee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:corenee@...\">corenee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nfirst i would like to say ya&#39;ll are doin a great thing here. Here&#39;s what<br/>\ni have heard, there are three other books(besides the two at mills)<br/>\nwhere or when you get em is beyond me. I too have made the firewater,<br/>\nand the lantern, and say one person auctioning off the cams for the<br/>\nbows, so i know those have been made also. As has already been posted i<br/>\ntoo heard that the infravision goggles instructions came from a quest.<br/>\nWhich one i don&#39;t know. Also i know as a fact that you can tinker<br/>\nsuccessfully at level 1, but cannot gain any skill level til level 16.<br/>\nSo all of you that are waiting to try it, go for it...it will work, i<br/>\ndecided to try it at level 11 with my gnome, and made fire water on<br/>\nfirst try. Also i believe that you can make the thermal cloak from just<br/>\nabout any cloak...doesn&#39;t have to be tattered... I am wanting to try<br/>\nsimilar things with lanterns ans stuff..(i.e. use small lantern and<br/>\nsuch). If anyone has tried it with other items please let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Jaqui(math marr)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nCongratulations to &quot;INDIE-GRRL,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nVisit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
