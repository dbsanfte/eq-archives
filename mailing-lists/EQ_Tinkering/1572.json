You<br/>\nmay continue to put practice points into it each and every level until you<br/>\nhit the cap for that level.  Once you hit the cap, at the next level you<br/>\nwill be able to raise the skill EXACTLY 5 more points whether you do it<br/>\nthrough actually using the skill or spending practice points.  The fact is<br/>\nthat every mage has known that research is level capped since it was<br/>\nimplemented.  It was only fairly recently (two or three months) that it was<br/>\nshown that Tinkering follows the same cap formula as Research (which btw is<br/>\n(level - 15) * 5 for levels 20 or greater.  For levels 16 through 18 you<br/>\ncan add one point, 19 adds 2 points ).  <br/>\n<br/>\nGZ may be very forthcoming, but on this point he is also very wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalbasil Psyrex of Ak&#39;Anon (Bertoxx)<br/>\nHouse of Silmindo<br/>\nLevel 33 Enchanter<br/>\nSkill 90 Researcher AND Tinkerer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:08 PM 12/14/99 -0800, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Malcolm O&#39;Callaghan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:malcolmo@...\">malcolmo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Diablokilr@...\">Diablokilr@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Believe me I have been on the one list for a LONG time the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; cap is  LEVEL  X 5 <br/>\n&gt;&gt; -13<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; If you dont beleive me tell GZ to chek the live servers himself<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was speaking to the assertion that research is capped - we all know that<br/>\n&gt;tinkering has been capped since release and is soon to be fixed. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
