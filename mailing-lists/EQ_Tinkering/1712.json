I was typing in a hurry.  They are no<br/>\nlonger lore, however...after hunting them tonight, it still apears to be<br/>\nbroken.   We gatered 3 boxes full of the &quot;very tiny crumpled skeleton&quot;, (Which<br/>\nwhen identify is cast on them are found to be &quot;undead brownie&quot;) but were not<br/>\nable to get them to combine in the box.  They spawn in North K near the gypsy<br/>\ncamp and wander around.  You may need to start the quest with Drexlin to make<br/>\nthem pop.  Found him upstairs in the bridge tower.  Also tryied giving him the<br/>\nskeletons in the box uncombined. Didn&#39;t work.  I say keep trying it and see if<br/>\nit gets fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12:37 AM 1/3/00 -0800, you wrote: <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Gazamel Prime Can you tell us where and when he spawns?
