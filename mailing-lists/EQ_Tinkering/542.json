Heck gnomes<br/>\nthemselves are<br/>\nvery rare.  I see very few as compared to elves or humans.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith such a small population, it IS possible for the secret to be held.  <br/>\nEven more so when all the other things you get from tinkering are useful<br/>\nto practically no one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; other &quot;amazing&quot; tinker inventions, I have yet to find a reasonable use for<br/>\n&gt; it that can&#39;t be duplicated by store-bought items or mob drops.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; flameless lantern = crappy lightstone<br/>\n&gt; compass = store-bought compass and trivial to everyone<br/>\n&gt; firewater = component for random junk and trivial to everyone<br/>\n&gt; mechanized lockpicks = how many locks have you seen?<br/>\n&gt; thermal cloak = who&#39;s gonna wear it?<br/>\n&gt; animated bait = who fishes as a profession?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.  All this is all the more reason to believe the secret may be known<br/>\nbut<br/>\njust hidden.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; cams = useful!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Really?  I keep on asking for fletchers if they want it and never got a <br/>\nreply.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; spyglass = useful?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Apparently wizards have a spell that does the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; collapsible fishing pole = the reason for this list<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Useful??  Who the hell fishes anymore.  I can get free food from<br/>\nclerics, mages,<br/>\nrangers, druids...  Its use is only as a component, much like firewater.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have missed some stuff, and obviously tinkered things exist out there that<br/>\n&gt; we haven&#39;t seen yet (like the recently-introduced bait).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I made a trip through akanon asking everyone about tinkering and fishing<br/>\npoles<br/>\nand looking at every merchant.  Couldn&#39;t find anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would be very upset if that &quot;third book&quot; resided in an area that made it<br/>\n&gt; difficult, if not impossible, for tinkers below level 35 to attain.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As an aside, I heard from a post either here or on a WWW site that one<br/>\nof the<br/>\nfiles contains the text aqua-lung.
