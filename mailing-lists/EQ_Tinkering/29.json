Tonight I hope to talk to every NPC in Ak&#39;anon for the<br/>\n&gt; remainder of the books especially the ones that contain firewater and<br/>\n&gt; collapsible fishing poles.

I&#39;ll tell you this much, I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t find<br/>\nit in the two books. But was emailing the guy (can&#39;t remember his name,<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\nin my email) who works on Trade skills. He kept suggesting that it&#39;s in the<br/>\n<br/>\nbooks. He of course didn&#39;t mention which books. I talked to the NPC&#39;s<br/>\nis Ak&#39;Anon, all of them I could find. Nada and more zip. I do know how<br/>\nto make Firewater, but it came from my emails not the game. It is possible<br/>\nthat there is an NPC I missed, I&#39;ve been through more then twice. I was<br/>\nhoping<br/>\nit was a quest, but haven&#39;t found it yet. May try Gnome&#39;s in Steamfont? Or<br/>\nif you&#39;re brave the ones in Mino Cave. Or in Lesser Fay.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Zikkin<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I can post the items that make up Firewater or just email me.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
