I was a little pissed that they<br/>\ntotally suck so I petitioned a GM. He went ahead and summoned the items to<br/>\nmake fireworks and made some. The reply I got from him after he tried them<br/>\nout was &quot;That totally sucked! I shall see to it that the game developers get<br/>\na nice little letter concearning gnomish fireworks&quot;. So I hope this helps. I<br/>\nthink that all of you should petition in game about the firewors sucking.<br/>\nMaybe they will feel sorry for us little old gnomes and decide to make the<br/>\nfireworks look better. The more petitions they get, the better the chances<br/>\nof that happening.

I guess if you have 20 or 30 people and they all go PFFT at<br/>\n&gt; the same time that might be kind of nice, but I&#39;d be embarassed to show up<br/>\n&gt; at a wedding, promise everyone a gnomish fireworks display, and all I get<br/>\n&gt; is a PFFT.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I got my pole, and after 3 attempts I got a spyglass, so I&#39;m a happy<br/>\n&gt; gnome now, I&#39;ll tinker myself some bait and go fishing at the pool in<br/>\n&gt; qeynos.
