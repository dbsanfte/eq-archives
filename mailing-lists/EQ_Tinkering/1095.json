I had a minute to try getting him to talk after some high<br/>\nlevels killed the clockwork.  I tried the standard hails, clicked on him to<br/>\nsee if he sold anything and even mentioned tinkering, but I didn&#39;t try<br/>\nGimblestan, because after a minute he just disappears.  I didn&#39;t get him to<br/>\nopen his mouth one bit.  I asked the high levels why they didn&#39;t attack the<br/>\nDriver and they said he was too tough for them, even tougher than the Guards<br/>\nand that he didn&#39;t have any loot that they heard of.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKilkin Copplepot - 28th Gemchopper - Fen Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\ttrond ivar hansen [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zafigomchic@...\">zafigomchic@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tMonday, October 25, 1999 8:10 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[EQ_Tinkering] Driver Bryggin<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: trond ivar hansen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zafigomchic@...\">zafigomchic@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWell, I don?t know if this has anything at all to do<br/>\n\t\twith tinkering, but I?ll post it here in case any of<br/>\n\t\tyou have the resources and contacts to check it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tYou see, the other day as I was on my way in Steamfont<br/>\n\t\tto try out the new tinkering recipies, I met the Cargo<br/>\n\t\tclockwork on it?s way to the windmills. (It was that<br/>\n\t\tbig one that usually stands beside the entrance to<br/>\n\t\tAk?Anon).<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAs I came closer I saw an ogre player beating on it,<br/>\n\t\tand I waited till he finished, to hear from him what<br/>\n\t\tloot he?d get. He killed it, and to my big surprise a<br/>\n\t\tgnome appeared from under the corpse. His name was<br/>\n\t\tdriver Bryggin, and it seems he is driving the Cargo<br/>\n\t\tclockwork.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tBefore I could hail him the ogre started killing him<br/>\n\t\ttoo. The gnome beat hard so the ogre had to flee, but<br/>\n\t\tthe gnome died anyway. I guess the ogre had cast a DoT<br/>\n\t\tspell on it or something. With the ogre away I looted<br/>\n\t\tthe corpses, but they had nothing valuable. The<br/>\n\t\tclockwork had scrap metal and the gnome had a rusty<br/>\n\t\tdagger.<br/>\n\t\tSo my question is, has any of you ever tried to hail<br/>\n\t\tDriver Bryggin? Could he have a quest, or even be a<br/>\n\t\tmerchant? Anyone interested in checking? I surely<br/>\n\t\tdon?t want to get messed up factins in Ak?Anon by<br/>\n\t\tkilling the clockwork myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tPiip Ignatz<br/>\n\t\tGnome rogue of the 30th grade<br/>\n\t\tInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t    GRAB THE GATOR!
