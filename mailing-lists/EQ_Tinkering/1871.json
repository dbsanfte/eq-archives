This is as it should<br/>\nbe, gnomes ARE the most curious race of Norrath.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow, a fact is also that we are among the fewest in<br/>\nnumbers of all races, and not all of us do even bother<br/>\nto tinker. <br/>\nWhat I have been pondering about is a way to spread<br/>\nthe word about what we are searching for. This way we<br/>\nmay find our treasures and get to our conclusions<br/>\nearlier.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat if Fulcrum or some other spokesperson among us<br/>\nposted it on EQvault, Stratics, Allakhazam, Everlore,<br/>\nEQlizer and so on, that we are searching for tattered<br/>\ngnomish cloaks and diamond dust. We may even put out a<br/>\nreward for it.<br/>\nPlease tell me what you think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Perhaps we should wait till a few days after the<br/>\npatch, in case Mr.Knotwood suddenly supports diamond<br/>\ndust).<br/>\n<br/>\nCaptain Piip Ignatz<br/>\nPirates of Dark Tide<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
