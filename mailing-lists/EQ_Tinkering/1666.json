PLEASE don&#39;t take this as a restart of the WHAT IS THE SKILL CAP <br/>\n&gt; argument. But rather a suggestion. I&#39;m a level 20 Gnome Mage and have been <br/>\n&gt; actively tinkering for months now.. even before I hit level 16. I was <br/>\n&gt; eagerly awaiting the day that I hit 16 and could raise my &quot;tinkering skill&quot; <br/>\n&gt; with training. Heck I even saved up 25 points for that sole purpose. Well, <br/>\n&gt; I hit level 16 and CAN&#39;T train in the skill. Sooo... I have spent the last <br/>\n&gt; 4 levels trying to get SOME kind of skill improvement. And so far to date I <br/>\n&gt; have only gotten my Tinkering to raise from 50 to 53. I have spent and <br/>\n&gt; BURNED atleast 500 to 600 Platinum Pieces trying to get my skill to <br/>\n&gt; improve. I tried everything from Flameless Lanterns to Spyglasses. If I got <br/>\n&gt; a success, I tried to sell it for some kind of profit and put that same <br/>\n&gt; money right back into tinkering.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, to make a long story short. I have burned WAY too much money and am <br/>\n&gt; TIRED of this nonsense. Shamans have Alchemy (which granted can be more <br/>\n&gt; expensive even than tinkering), and there was a recent addition for shamans <br/>\n&gt; to be able to put training points into Alchemy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; WHAT ABOUT TINKERING?!?!?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I say we start a write in campaign of e-mail,  or a petition.. or SOMETHING <br/>\n&gt; to let Verant know that we Gnomes are tired of wasting needless amounts of <br/>\n&gt; cash to raise a skill that we can not train in... plus making things worse <br/>\n&gt; it being the MOST expensive trade skill in EQ. Something needs to be done <br/>\n&gt; about this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tuni Gearspinner<br/>\n&gt; 20th Season Mage Gnome<br/>\n&gt; Karana Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
