He <br/>\n&#39;claims&#39; to be a level 50 character with a skill of 102 in tinkering.  He <br/>\nhas attempted 100 aqualungs, succeeding on 75 to 80 of them with a wisdom <br/>\nof 80.  Also, he claims to have an intelligence of 200 and has not seen his <br/>\nskill increase yet.  I, on the other hand, am a level 16 with a wisdom of <br/>\n153 and an intelligence of 156.  I succeed, on average, 12 of 19 attempts <br/>\nand have gained skill up to 106.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this sound like the guy is pulling my leg?  Wisdom of 80 and <br/>\nsucceeding 75% versus wisdom of 153 and succeeding 60%?  And not raising <br/>\nskill on 100 attempts with INT of 200 versus raising skill 4 points with <br/>\nINT of 156.  What you think?<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I raised skill last night making lungs, so the skill cap isn&#39;t present <br/>\nfor myself at level 16.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso.  I sell for 500pp in order to stay afloat.  Its a hard sell, but I <br/>\nhave my methods ;)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
