You say<br/>\nrobots were taken out? I don&#39;t know where you heard this rumor.. there NEVER<br/>\never were robots.. not even the notion. I remember a post back in beta<br/>\nasking about this.. and all the gm had to say was that it would unbalance<br/>\nthe game uncontrolably.. and it would. Imagine a wizard with a robot pet...<br/>\nor something like that. Anyway just wanted to clear that up..<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:igbot@...\">igbot@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 04, 1999 10:27 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Tinkering] My remaining big questions...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:igbot@...\">igbot@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. Whats the lodestone for at our new merchant?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. Has anyone done any research into the unstable firewater mentioned in<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt;    journal? The one that sent a firework screaming into the storage<br/>\nfacility?<br/>\n&gt;    I tried several combinations of multiple Gnomish Spirits and water, but<br/>\nno<br/>\n&gt;    progress.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3. Any idea where this &quot;storage cavern&quot; mentioned is?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4. I tried combining a stalking probes and a firewater from the other<br/>\nreference<br/>\n&gt;    in the first (2nd?) journal. Where Gimble was afraid the probe could<br/>\n&gt;    explode (funny, I&#39;m HOPING the dam probes will explode!  :)  Anyone<br/>\nelse<br/>\n&gt;    try stuff along this line?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 5. Anyone do tinkering when EQ was beta? Any formulas for robots and such?<br/>\n&gt;    I know they were taken out, but maybe such recipes would give clues.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 6. Anyone find any use for the small power sources and function force<br/>\nmodules<br/>\n&gt;    found in Solusek?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
