I dropped about 60 plat and got nothing in<br/>\nreturn.  Anyway, I gave up on tinkering for a long time, but recently have<br/>\ngotten back into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 47 and with a 184 int, I have gotten increases from making the<br/>\nlanterns about every 5 attempts.  It may be my imagination, but even a<br/>\nlittle extra int seems to help, so if you can get an int buff before going<br/>\nto work, do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKazaan of Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Aaron Bolch [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaronbolch@...\">aaronbolch@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 22, 1999 1:16 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_tinkering@onelist.com\">eq_tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] bah<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Aaron Bolch&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaronbolch@...\">aaronbolch@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have come to the conclusion that learning tinkering is one <br/>\n&gt; of the lamest<br/>\n&gt; things Verant has implemented.  Last night, I reached level 27 with my<br/>\n&gt; wizard and sat down to make flameless lanterns.  I started <br/>\n&gt; out at skill 50.<br/>\n&gt; About 120 lanterns later, I get to 51.  About 40-50 lanterns <br/>\n&gt; later, I get to<br/>\n&gt; 60.  Then I called it quits and started again this morning.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; SEVEN hours later my skill has not budged.  I made approximately 360<br/>\n&gt; attempts at lanterns (costing around 600pp after selling them <br/>\n&gt; back) and<br/>\n&gt; gaining nothing but a sore disposition.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, here is the conclusion that I came up with:  I have only <br/>\n&gt; been able to<br/>\n&gt; train my skill up to 10 past what it started, which is the same as the<br/>\n&gt; number of levels I have achieved since being able to gain <br/>\n&gt; tinkering skill in<br/>\n&gt; the first place.  Yeah, 16 is when it says in the guild you <br/>\n&gt; get the skill,<br/>\n&gt; but you really can&#39;t increase it til 17.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I need to hear from everyone is what level they are and <br/>\n&gt; what their<br/>\n&gt; tinkering level is at.. I really don&#39;t want to have to level <br/>\n&gt; repeatedly just<br/>\n&gt; to get decent at tinker.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Phenglei Kai -- Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Share your special moments with family and friends- send <br/>\n&gt; PHOTO Greetings<br/>\n&gt; at Zing.com!
