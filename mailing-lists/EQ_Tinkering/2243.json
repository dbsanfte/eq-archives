What could he want with me? Was he angry about that spider trap I<br/>\nhad been experimenting with? No, that couldn&#39;t be it. The damage has been<br/>\ncleaned up, and my assistant&#39;s wounds are healing nicely. Was it the<br/>\nexploding fishing bait I was testing in the lake? Maybe. The waves it<br/>\ngenerated did inundate parts of the city, but only temporarily, and they did<br/>\nwash away a bit of grime. Perhaps I should use a smaller amount of<br/>\nFirewater...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I was escorted into the throne room, I spied a Human! I was about to grab<br/>\nthe nearest guard and have the intruder booted from the room, when he spoke.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Pasketti! I have summoned you here because I believe you may be able to<br/>\nhelp.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat? Our king is a Human? Ah, yes! He must be an Enchanter like myself, and<br/>\ncloaking himself in Human guise for amusement. That must be it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;How may I help, Sire?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It seems that many throughout the land are having problems editing their<br/>\nINI files to correctly set text colors.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Sire? I don&#39;t understand. It&#39;s simplicity itself. Set User_15_Red to 0,<br/>\nUser_15_Green to 0, and User_15_Blue to 128 to make your skill messages come<br/>\nout in a pleasing dark blue color.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yes, yes, to us it is. But to those that haven&#39;t been blessed with keen<br/>\nGnomish minds adept at tinkering, it can be confusing. Therefore I task you,<br/>\nPasketti! Create a way to allow everyone to configure their text colors!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yes, Sire! I&#39;ll get right on it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI returned to my workshop posthaste, and have crafted this program. It&#39;s so<br/>\nsimple even an Ogre can use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cws.org/~pasketti\">http://www.cws.org/~pasketti</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSource code is available.<br/>\n<br/>\nPasketti of Pover</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
