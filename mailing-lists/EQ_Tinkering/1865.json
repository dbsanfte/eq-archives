The question here was more along the lines of &quot;How are you doing, adn do you need any help&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMY metting with Mauldoon was any thing but. I once sent an appolige to Mauldoon for the wrong &quot;misinformed on my part&quot; done to him by other Gnomes trying to get him to tell them where the items to tinkering where. This was done in a chance to strick up a conversation and posible friendship. The responce i recived from Mauldoon was nada. My one metting with him, was when he apporched me, acted like we were old friends and asked for a Clarity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point in my short life (pun intended) my respect is in Gazamel.<br/>\n<br/>\nTinkerten Iktomi<br/>\n37th circle Enchanter<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
