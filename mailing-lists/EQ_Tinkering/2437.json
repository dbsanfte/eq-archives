This is probably just<br/>\ndue to the fact that I make less because of the absurd<br/>\namount of money each try costs.  Is the going rate on<br/>\nAqualungs still 500pp btw?  I&#39;m having a hard time<br/>\nselling these.  Silly people always wait till we can<br/>\nmake redbreathers but I don&#39;t think they realize we<br/>\nneed plat from our sales to get that high hehe<br/>\n--- Norbert Gearsmith &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:noes@...\">noes@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think Str for smithing is supposed to help in<br/>\n&gt; learning, not <br/>\n&gt; success.  This is for all those dumb, strong people<br/>\n&gt; (i.e. barbarians) <br/>\n&gt; out there that say they should be able to learn<br/>\n&gt; smithing as easily as <br/>\n&gt; someone who is smart but weak.  I didn&#39;t think stats<br/>\n&gt; affected success <br/>\n&gt; rate, but if anyone has any good experimental data<br/>\n&gt; that shows <br/>\n&gt; otherwise, I&#39;d like to know.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I have found is that when I boost INT up, I<br/>\n&gt; have a much better <br/>\n&gt; chance in increasing skill.  Duh!  I have tried dex<br/>\n&gt; to a small degree <br/>\n&gt; and didn&#39;t really notice any difference, but I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t raise it as <br/>\n&gt; high as I had raised INT so there might still be<br/>\n&gt; some hope.  However, <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think that the learning bonuses are<br/>\n&gt; cumulative, but rather <br/>\n&gt; affected by your highest stat.  So for most gnomes,<br/>\n&gt; it will be <br/>\n&gt; easiest to raise INT with regard to practicing<br/>\n&gt; tinkering.  I had been <br/>\n&gt; raising my int to about 115, but with some borrowed<br/>\n&gt; items I raised it <br/>\n&gt; fairly easily to around 145.  I didn&#39;t take down any<br/>\n&gt; stats, but it <br/>\n&gt; did make a noticeable difference.  Keeping track of<br/>\n&gt; numbers makes it <br/>\n&gt; seem too much like work. :P  But now that I&#39;m into<br/>\n&gt; the grownup <br/>\n&gt; tinkering things I have to be a little more thrifty<br/>\n&gt; with my plat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, my long term goals are to make watchman<br/>\n&gt; armor for myself.  <br/>\n&gt; Not that I would use it in battle, but it looks like<br/>\n&gt; it could freak <br/>\n&gt; out some folks.  They already freak out at a gnome<br/>\n&gt; warrior.  Wait til <br/>\n&gt; they see me running around with those bug eyes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Norbert Gearsmith<br/>\n&gt; level 39 and 8/10ths Gnome Warrior<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com\">EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com</a>, Jason Willoughby<br/>\n&gt; &lt;jwilloug@g...&gt; <br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Tue, 9 Jan 2001 josh@m... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; High Int and Cha are indeed good for the<br/>\n&gt; purposes with which you <br/>\n&gt; associated<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them, but the only factor that determines your<br/>\n&gt; sucess rate is <br/>\n&gt; your skill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yak has insinuated that there are secondary stats<br/>\n&gt; that boost <br/>\n&gt; success rate,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but the only one known is str for smithing.
