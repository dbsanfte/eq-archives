However","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1654081716\">First of all, I personally think that makeing a collapseable fishing pole is<br/>\nimpossible since no books with instructions to make one has been found.<br/>\nHowever that hasn&#39;t stopped me with throwing away a few plat now and then to<br/>\ntry it.  :)  A lot of people have been trying to make one without useing a<br/>\nnormal fishing pole as one of the components, which I think is wrong.  I<br/>\nthink its going to be like making a flameless lantern where a normal lantern<br/>\nis needed.  Instead of trying to find some type of string, I think it&#39;s<br/>\ngoing to involve takeing the fishing line out of the normal pole and putting<br/>\nit on the metal rod/shaft&#39;s just like you take out the light in a lantern<br/>\nand replaceing it with firewater in a flameless lantern.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a few questions about the components.  What the heck is the<br/>\ndifference shape-wise between a rod and a shaft??  Originally I thought<br/>\nmaybe a shaft was hollow and a rod solid, so that one could slide inside the<br/>\nother and hence, collapse.  But then I went to look both words up in the<br/>\ndictionary and they both seem to be the exact same thing.  And what the heck<br/>\nis a spriket?  I can&#39;t even find that word in a dictionary.  :)  Also, what<br/>\nis raw bamboo used for in the game?  Seems like every single merchant sells<br/>\nthem, but I&#39;ve never seen any mention of using them for anything??  And<br/>\nanother possible component might be something I got off a clockwork cleaner<br/>\nin kaladim as part of a quest where I had to exterminate a rare spawning<br/>\ncleaner in the mines of kaladim.  When I finally killed it, it had scrap<br/>\nmetal and something called a byzantine pestle that looks like a rod/shaft.<br/>\nIn the quest I had to return the scrap metal, but not the pestle and I have<br/>\nno idea what to do with the pestle?<br/>\n<br/>\nUbershadow - lvl 14 frustrated Tinkering Rogue Gnome - Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\ngr0k - Stranger in a Strange Land - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juju.org\">http://www.juju.org</a><br/>\n&quot;Linux... find out what you&#39;ve been missing while<br/>\nyou&#39;ve been rebooting Windows NT&quot; - Infoworld</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
