The zone is HUGE, so I didnt finish before I had to quit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe area that I searched (and found nothing but a shark guarding a lock box) is the area south of the &#39;sisters of erollisis&#39; isle and &#39;seafury cyclops&#39; isle all the way to the south zone border. I did not search north of these isles or west of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you drew a box with these coordinates you would get the area that I have searched:<br/>\n<br/>\n2000, -6000   <br/>\n2000, -10000<br/>\n-5000,-6000<br/>\n-5000, -1000<br/>\n<br/>\nMake a box out of these and that is the area that I have searched so far in OOT.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would highly reccomend a fish bone ear ring as you are spending a LOT of time underwater.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also searched all the water in east freeport from the docks and found nothing...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;FizzWizz of tunare&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
