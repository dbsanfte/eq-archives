The lense quest appears to be working again.  You can ask both of the observers who before told us to come back or we weren&#39;t experienced.  I now have the three lenses.  Also, if you go to Trudon (sp) he will tell you his brother (Bidl) is in Kelethin at nights in a tavern, and wandering around during the day.  I haven&#39;t found Bidl yet, but am hangin out in Kelethin looking for him!  Let me know if you find him, and where.  I also suspect that Trudon could have been wrong, and meant Kaladim, since that is where Bidl was on the test server.  Let me know what you guys find, I&#39;ll be looking tonite.<br/>\n<br/>\nXalastile<br/>\nLvl 22 Magician<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
