When I say money I mean having enough to have all your<br/>\nspells in your book with change left over. :)  Now a days to get loads of<br/>\ncash (10k+) you either need to sell items for cash or farm mobs for it.<br/>\nUndeniably one of the best ways is to be a pet caster at 49+ and hit the<br/>\nhill giants.  A friend of mine made over 20k+ in one week between her and<br/>\nher partner doing just that.<br/>\nAs for levels one of the places you can try would be sol A.  The items from<br/>\nthere don&#39;t trade that great but you get lots of FineSteel drops with a<br/>\nvendor in the zone.  Enchanter pets aren&#39;t quite as good at the job as are<br/>\nMage and Necro pets but at your level, and more than likely even better at<br/>\n44+ you should do ok in Sol A.<br/>\nHill Giants are generally though of as better, but at your level you should<br/>\nprobably enlist the help of a partner or two.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
