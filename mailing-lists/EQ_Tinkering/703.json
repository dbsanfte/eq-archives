Anyway, some things","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-985001254\">With a level 16 requirement on tinkering it could mean that it takes at<br/>\nleast that level to travel wherever or complete whatever quest.  Anyway,<br/>\nsome things you might want to look out for when looking:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The butcher knife quest.  The knife is now lore/no drop so its very<br/>\nlikely that someone somewhere wants it.  Anyone that has the identify spell<br/>\nand that they can get one themselves and cast on it?  I don&#39;t have the<br/>\nspell much less a spellbook lol and since its no trade I&#39;m at a dead end...<br/>\n On a related note go to the magic hall in Ak&#39;anon and ask Tergon &#39;Who is<br/>\nMeldrath?&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Non-rusted Blackbox.  Very rarely when killing clockworks in Steamfont<br/>\nyou get a &#39;Blackbox&#39; (Non-rusted) and the warrior guild leader won&#39;t take<br/>\nit.  Again, maybe with the identify spell it might say who it belongs to.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Gnome in Erudin.  Go to the jail cells by the bank and there&#39;s a gnome<br/>\nin there doing time for something about smuggling Erud&#39;s tonic into Qeynos.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) The Great Span.  This quest probably has nothing to do with tinkering<br/>\nbut sounds interesting and it looks like nobody has ever completed it.  In<br/>\none of the houses in S. Qeynos there&#39;s an NPC named Hansl Bigroon or<br/>\nsomething like that.  On the floor in his house (across from the tax<br/>\ncollector) is a note that is supposed to be delivered to Antonius Bayle&#39;s<br/>\nmessanger.  Basically he&#39;s working with 3 other engineers (listed on the<br/>\nnote, one of them is Jogl) to create a giant bridge to Odus.  Nobody has<br/>\nfound out who gets the note, but each of the engineers drops a decapitated<br/>\nhead as loot when killed.  You take quite a bit of faction hits for<br/>\ncollecting them, I&#39;d imagine there must be a fairly good reward for this<br/>\nquest...<br/>\n<br/>\n-Luke</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
