Hey, what the heck, things are starting to work, so perhaps some things<br/>\nhave changed (actually I really wanted to create that spyglass). Anyhow, this is what I found out.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  You cannot train any additional points to tinkering.  I&#39;m level 31 and have never trained in tinkering before.  When I<br/>\ntried this morning, I got the message about going out in the field and trying it.  So, I had to start out at 50.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  The Collapsable Fishing Pole is trivial at 53.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  Flameless Lanterns are trivial at 54 (I know, Gnomad list them trivial at 60 something, but not anymore).<br/>\n<br/>\n4)  To raise my skill anymore, it costs 15pp per try (the cams).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know of a cheaper way to raise skill?  At 15pp per try, I spent about 300pp to raise two points.  Talk about an<br/>\nexpensive habit.  For those kind of rates, I could become a jeweler and at least they have a market.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, last question.  Does the spyglass have charges?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll come to us eventually,<br/>\n  Gnish, Mage of Death.<br/>\n  Bristlebane.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
