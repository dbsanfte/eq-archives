We must <br/>\ntry harder to discory the methods used to make these items. I myself would <br/>\nexcept: A I&#39;m not level 16. B I&#39;m almost always broke now, anyway. But when <br/>\nI get more money I&#39;ll start working on it.<br/>\nNow we know that there are more items.

The good news is the Telescope Lens <br/>\n&gt;and Collapsable Fishing Pole CAN be made.  And, you DO have to use a <br/>\n&gt;collapsable fishing pole to make the telescope.  Both of these items are <br/>\n&gt;makeable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now for the bad news.  The only person I know that can make them WILL NOT <br/>\n&gt;share the recipe!  Can you believe that?  He is a gnome on Xegony by the <br/>\n&gt;name of Salvadori, so if you can pry the recipe from him, good luck.  I <br/>\n&gt;tried.  Well, also, he said that Tinkering skill improvement had been <br/>\n&gt;fixed, and he was up in the 60&#39;s on skill.  So keep tinkering.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Xalastile<br/>\n&gt;Level 22 Magician<br/>\n&gt;Xegony </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
