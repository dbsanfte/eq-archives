But","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1866182026\">It is very very tedious. You have to make a whole bunch of Flameless Lanterns which will get you up to 68, then Cams or Spyglasses will get you to 70. But don&#39;t even bother trying to raise skill in tinkering if you are not level 26 or above because you will not raise a single point. There is a level cap on tinkering, I hope it&#39;s a bug but nonetheless, there is a cap. The formula for the cap is 5x(your level-15). This means that if you are not level 26 or above you can&#39;t get any skill raise. I wish you luck friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrillian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Lee <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, October 31, 1999 10:56 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Skill<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Can you tell me how you got to 70?

I have spent so much money on tinkering now and my skill is 70, but even after I got to 70 skill I have made 30 spyglasses and 24 cams, no skill gain. Is there some kind of level cap?<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Brillian Novaspire<br/>\n    29 Wiz<br/>\n    Solusek Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
