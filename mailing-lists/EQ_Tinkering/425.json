I was told by a GM that tinkering is one of the hardest skills to <br/>\ntrain, so perhaps I am either unlucky, or the skill is nearly impossible to <br/>\ntrain up now.<br/>\n<br/>\nFact #1:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou cannot train tinkering using skill points.  I have tried it.  It is just <br/>\nlike other trade skills, in that you can only use training points to get it <br/>\nso far before you must actually use the skill to learn it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThought #2:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the collapsible fishing pole was in a shop, it would have been found long <br/>\nago.  Of course, if it was only added in recently, then it may have yet to <br/>\nbe found.  In any case, it still doesn&#39;t solve the problem of not having the <br/>\nrecipe to make them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThought #3:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe collapsible fishing pole recipe should be fairly cheap to make.  I <br/>\nreally doubt that Verant made it difficult, considering it is a component <br/>\nfor another item.  So, this should limit the parts to those costing 1 pp or <br/>\nless, with the total cost not exceeding 5 pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThought #4:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoever assumed that the spyglasses were being sold for 50% over cost is <br/>\nassuming way too much.  If you are the only producer of an item, you can <br/>\ndemand a much higher profit return on that item.<br/>\n<br/>\nThought #5:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no such thing as a &quot;secret&quot; on Everquest.  There are too many <br/>\npeople playing the game, making any new discovery part of the common <br/>\nknowledge base within a few weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThought #6:<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing &quot;broken&quot; quests, items, and spells in the past, I wouldn&#39;t put it <br/>\npast Verant that the collapsible fishing pole recipe isn&#39;t really in the <br/>\ngame.  I am merely speculating, but I find it rather hard to believe that <br/>\nafter months of uptime, not one gnome has found the recipe to such a trivial <br/>\nitem as the collapsible fishing pole.<br/>\n<br/>\nThought #7:<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is perhaps the most overriding aspect of this whole ridiculous thread <br/>\nabout the collapsible fishing pole recipe.  There are literally hundreds of <br/>\nitems that could be used as a component, and it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to <br/>\nmake any sense whatsoever.  Trying to guess it blindly is just like playing <br/>\nthe lottery.  You might get lucky, but we don&#39;t have the hundreds of <br/>\nthousands of players needed to insure that SOMEONE gets lucky.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhenglei of Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
