Only blade in primary slot can be <br/>\n&gt;poisoned.  Randomize when it will proc (if it does).  If the rogue is <br/>\n&gt;moving when procing, it is interrupted.

Its still 2-3 hrs<br/>\nof killing green for 5ish bottles (during which we have to ignore the<br/>\nyoungins complaing that we are killing everything in sight  and that<br/>\ntheres noting to kill now), still costs 2+p per use, still heavily<br/>\nresisted, and still has (start to finish (block of clay to successfull<br/>\npoisoning)) 5 chances to fail and wipe out all the work done on it<br/>\nbefore.  But it does proc the first attack, so thats sumthin.<br/>\n<br/>\nNinen on Veeshan<br/>\n35th rogue, prowd owner of a purchasted spyglass.
