Possibly<br/>\neven have a version that uses an expensive item (like<br/>\na 1pp stone or power supply) that gives temporary<br/>\nspeed of cheetah (2000pp)<br/>\n<br/>\n2 - cams, twine, and metals for flethchers to make<br/>\nbows needs to be fixed/improved.<br/>\n<br/>\n3 - the ability to combine armor  items to produce a<br/>\nmore powerful armor (like taking a tattered cloak and<br/>\nturning it into a thermal cloak -- possible AC boost<br/>\nand alternate effects)<br/>\n<br/>\n4 - the ability to make boxes that store items more<br/>\nefficiently, as well as reduce weight (very expensive<br/>\nagain, 100pp-2000pp)<br/>\n<br/>\n5 - a lightsource you don&#39;t have to hold<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are just some realistic ideas that could easily<br/>\nbe implemented in the game and NOT unbalance the game<br/>\n(dupe items already exist).  Right now tinkering has<br/>\nNO REAL useful items.  Those that are in the game can<br/>\neasily be supplimented in some other way.  Example:<br/>\ncompasses can be bought, casters can use their sight<br/>\nspells, fishing poles are easy to come by and<br/>\ninsignificant anyway, and you have to hold a lantern)<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s toss some ideas around, and try to get a<br/>\npetition pulled up.  I really think Verant needs to<br/>\nimplement trade skills in a MUCH better way, all of<br/>\nthem are severly lacking (Smithing needs to make<br/>\nplatemail and magical platemail, tailoring needs to be<br/>\nmade magical as well, brewing, bakery, and pottery<br/>\nneed practical applications)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kryogen Katspaw<br/>\nGnome Wizard, Level 22<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  the best place to EXPLORE topics, SHARE ideas, and <br/>\nCONNECT to people with the same interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
