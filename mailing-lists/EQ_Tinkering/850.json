They are usually around level 18, <br/>\nand scowl, ready to attack at everyone, but, for some reason, they will <br/>\nstill not attack you, unless you hang around one for too long. They all look <br/>\nlike hammerheads, but, for some reason, there is no other kind of fish or <br/>\nanimal in the water. The ocean bottem is rather borng in most places. It <br/>\nusually looks just like a totally flat plane, so it will usually be easy to <br/>\nspot an abnormality.<br/>\nThe icean floor is not really as deep as you might think though. You can <br/>\neasily go to the bottom and search it for a little bit with a high enough <br/>\nswimming skill, but I also highly reccommend a fish bone earring.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;What kind of beasties are down there?  Been said there&#39;s sharks, what level<br/>\n&gt;are they?  I think that box is used for a quest in Freeport.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
