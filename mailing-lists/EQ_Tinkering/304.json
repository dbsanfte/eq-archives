Thanks for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-375612489\">I for one am relieved to see that the recipe for spyglass is<br/>\nnot broken.  I am also really happy to get more information on the fishing<br/>\npole.  Thanks for telling us that you were given the fishing pole and had<br/>\nnot made it.  I, for one, am reluctant to start experimenting on an<br/>\nexpensive trade for fear that the correct recipe is broken &lt; for those that<br/>\nbake remember the dough recipe? &gt;  It&#39;s rather interesting to see that most<br/>\nof the trade skills are in a deadlock over certain components for high end<br/>\nskills:<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAlchemy- Doesn&#39;t seem to be widely implemented yet<br/>\n\t\tPoison - still too new in my opinion<br/>\n\t\tTailoring - lack of resources: i.e. hq pelts<br/>\n\t\tBlacksmithing - always lack the skill for folded sheets of<br/>\nmetal and lack of weapon/plate molds<br/>\n\t\tBaking - smoker available for purchase but not use<br/>\n\t\tBrewing - no one can find many of the components &lt;morning<br/>\ndew for one&gt; and no one knows how to make vodka<br/>\n\t\tJewelry - extreme shortage of high end components<br/>\n\t\tFletching - have been told that our cams can be used, but<br/>\nnot verified<br/>\n\t\tPottery - many of the recipes are invalid (mixing bowl for<br/>\none) <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAnd then comes ours - Tinkering - an extreme lack of<br/>\ninformation.  Having dabbled in all the trade skill this one seems the most<br/>\nfrustrating.  In all of the other skill, one buys the book, reads it and<br/>\nvoila..on the road to success, until one gets high enough where the<br/>\nmysteries of the game come in.  Which I can respect.  But from step one,<br/>\nthings like firewater are left out.  &lt;yes I do know how to make it by the<br/>\nway&gt;  I can&#39;t seem to get anyone to talk about it, npc&#39;s that is. &lt;but that<br/>\ncould be due to my faction - I&#39;m a necro&gt;  So here is my idea.  If Lukas<br/>\nwould be willing &lt;since his web page has 10,000 hits&gt; There can&#39;t be that<br/>\nmany combinations to make the pole.  Have Lukas make up a spreadsheet of<br/>\nevery combination and people email him request 5 things to try and he give<br/>\nit to him.  Trial and error, we will succeed.  Then, say, oh for a week keep<br/>\nthe recipe to ourselves before posting.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSo, what shall we sell this pole for anyway?  Double the<br/>\ncost of components?  Just my 2 cents.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
