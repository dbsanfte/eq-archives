A necro who <br/>\nis low on hp and there is nothing but high level NPC&#39;s around. He makes an <br/>\neye of zomm and life taps it.  Hes healed with no fear of having to fight <br/>\nbecause its dead after 1 tap.  So this item is more of a necro lifesaver then <br/>\nanything else.  So with that said im sure any high level necro out there <br/>\nwould pay a measly 40pp to save his own hide.<br/>\n<br/>\nStalkin Powers<br/>\nLevel 50 Gnome Wizard<br/>\nKnights of Eternal Good<br/>\nThe Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
