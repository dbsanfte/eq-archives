No one makes any money on any of the skills and yet<br/>\n&gt;people still do them for several reasons. In fact my character right now<br/>\n&gt;is working on baking, tailoring, blacksmithing, and jewlcraft.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;losing lots of money but I&#39;m having a great time. When I reach 16, you<br/>\n&gt;better believe I&#39;m going to work my tinkering. Just because I can.  So<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t try and tell me that tinkering isn&#39;t &quot;worth it.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Orevin Gnomish Enchanter and Slayer of Mummies, Karanra server<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Jewelcraft is a worthwhile skill, only because you can make very nice items <br/>\nonce you reach a skill of 200.  Tailoring is worthwhile because you can make <br/>\n10slot backpacks.  Blacksmithing and pottery are a waste of time because <br/>\nthey make nothing useful.  Sure, that first suit of banded will make you <br/>\nhappy, but once you develop a character etc, the skill quickly goes to <br/>\nwaste.  Pottery makes absolutely nothing useful. This has nothing to do with <br/>\nmoney, but what you can do with the skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for tinkering, the only thing even mildly useful is cams.  A tinker can <br/>\nproduce these much cheaper than you can buy them.  Unfortunately, bows <br/>\nreally aren&#39;t that important in the game, aside from a way to pull mobs from <br/>\nlong distance.  So, unless someone discovers a globally useful item to be <br/>\ntinkered, don&#39;t expect it to reward you in any way, except for the personal <br/>\nsatisfaction that you have a good tinker skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhenglei -- Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
