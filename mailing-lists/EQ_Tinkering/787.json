Think about the story behind things. If I have learned anything from<br/>\nplaying EverQuest for all of these months, I have learned that Verant and<br/>\nthe programmers love a good story. They love to flesh things out, why else<br/>\nwould so many of these quests be long and drawn out. Think of the story<br/>\nbehind the cave ad the necro there, he is supposed to be banished there by<br/>\nthe gods in a huge epic tale, not because of some measly tinkering book. As<br/>\nwell with the spelunker fer one thing he is NOT beneath the waves. I dont<br/>\nknow what the story behind him is but come on if it were that easy do you<br/>\nnot think someone has tried that by now? NO our answer does lie in the<br/>\nrealms of the submerged, no probably not kedge keep as it is not itemized.<br/>\nHas anyone ever heard someone say anything about the battle they ad against<br/>\nsea serpents? Probably not. Why? because no one as explored the depths. No<br/>\none has spent an entire month drudging the ocean floors. Maybe one or two<br/>\npeople were masicistic enough or maybe just bored enough to one day decide<br/>\nto go hunt the oceans for things maybe they fell off a boat and accidentally<br/>\ncaught a glimpse of something that changed everything. Maybe its in lake<br/>\nrathe, mayvbe its in the ocean of tears, maybe its in erud&#39;s crossing, I<br/>\ndont know but if anywere these are the three likely places. <br/>\nI have heard multiple rumors of a secret cave on erollisi island wher you<br/>\npush a button and hear some grinding. I have yet to find this button but it<br/>\nhas been said enough to me to get some of my attention. Im planning an<br/>\nexpedidtion on the bertoxxulous server for this next weekend to go to the<br/>\nocean of tears and to comb the ocean floor if i have to but if its there to<br/>\nfind i will find it. Subsequest trips will be to erud&#39;s crossing and lake<br/>\nrathe but for now my hopes and my ideas are drawing me to the ocean of<br/>\ntears. Start your own expeditions. With enough people looking for it it will<br/>\nbe found and the secrets of tinkering will belong to us all!<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ralph Scott [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rscott@...\">rscott@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 06, 1999 3:50 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] More clues from Lindell, third book<br/>\nconfirmed, and more...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ralph Scott &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rscott@...\">rscott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Ott wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Michael Ott &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mott@...\">mott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; the necro is not the way to go neiter is the spelunker...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And you know this how??<br/>\n<br/>\n---ralph</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
