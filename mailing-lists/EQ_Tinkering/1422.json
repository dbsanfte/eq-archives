The cap only hurts people, it<br/>\nwill not crush the market.  No one cares about tinkering because there isn&#39;t<br/>\nmany useful things to make.  In your example you said a master jeweler still<br/>\nneeds enchanted bars more than likely the guild is going to provide those for<br/>\nyou, hence it doesn&#39;t matter.  The major reason I have heard from people why<br/>\nthey will NOT take up tinkering is because, &quot;it sucks there is noting to make<br/>\nand it takes several hundred plat per skill point&quot;  I have heard that from so<br/>\nmany people BOTH of the level 50 Gnomes on my server said that, Silvera and<br/>\nGrumblethorpe.  The cap should be removed because tinkering is just like any<br/>\nother trade skill with the exception only gnomes can advance in it, and I say<br/>\nadvance in it because any race can tinker.  I have tinkered with every race<br/>\nexcept trolls and ogres because I kept getting killed by the guards, my dark<br/>\nelf was a necro so he had invis and I had good faction with the merchant.<br/>\n<br/>\nEfrieum<br/>\nWarrior 34<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t believe you should be level 50 to play the game</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
