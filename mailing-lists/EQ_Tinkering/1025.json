I went to Ecomm and tried to sell off these great new things. I <br/>\nfigured I&#39;d charge 60pp for the spyglass and 20 for the pole at first just <br/>\nto see what would happen. I did get sell two spyglasses, 1 for 53pp and 1 <br/>\nfor 60pp. The first guy told me how much the thing sucks then sold it to <br/>\nsomeone else for 55pp. Go figure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it wil be hard to sell these things for such a bloated price. I <br/>\nthink 40pp may be right and *maybe* 10pp for the pole, but no one wants that <br/>\n(by the way.. did anyone see if it breaks?). But we could get away with 60pp <br/>\nor more at the bazaar in Ecomm on Bertoxx anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting story ..... =)<br/>\n<br/>\nI myself think that the spyglasses are definatley worth 60pp just for the <br/>\nroleplaying aspects ; ) I was trying to sell some cams and I had my first <br/>\nspyglass on me and this big barbarian female started talking to me. So I <br/>\nused the telescope to see her better (she was pretty tall)<br/>\nand next thing I know she took off her shirt for me! Then I gave her 20 <br/>\ngnomish spirits and badabing bada boom she propositioned me for sex! LOL <br/>\nPerhaps I should use this as an advertisement for selling my spyglasses... <br/>\nsex sells after all =)<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it was my new sexy red robe that got her goin&#39;? hmm...<br/>\n<br/>\nCatbik Tinkerton<br/>\nGood luck with tinkering all</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
