All the clockwork stuff looks old and rusty.  We&#39;re<br/>\nsurrounded by malfunctioning runaway clockworks.  There&#39;s guys standing<br/>\naround called &quot;mechanics&quot; but they don&#39;t do anything but stand there and<br/>\nlook at it as it decays and breaks down.  There&#39;s a guy in the scrap yard<br/>\nthat just keeps taking load after load of scrap metal, but nothing ever gets<br/>\ndone with it.  Our underground lake is so polluted by the rust and decay<br/>\nthat it&#39;s turned green.  It&#39;s quite sad really.  Maybe thats why we can&#39;t<br/>\nmake anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\ngr0k - Stranger in a Strange Land - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juju.org\">http://www.juju.org</a><br/>\n&quot;Linux... find out what you&#39;ve been missing while<br/>\nyou&#39;ve been rebooting Windows NT&quot; - Infoworld</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
