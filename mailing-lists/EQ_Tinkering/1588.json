Heh - anyone try giving him his pack back?  Just an<br/>\nidea).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve had one of those packs for a few weeks now.  Got it for the Duster<br/>\n&gt; quest.  It&#39;s a nice item, but it&#39;s NOT a weight-reducing pack.  It&#39;s just<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; 10-slot backpack, lore, nodrop.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; These junk items that you talk about - I&#39;ve never seen them before.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Gnomish Glow Rods?  Perhaps these are the rods needed for the thermal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cloak...  I just received a patchwork cloak after completing the Red V<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quest - I&#39;ll try to do the Duster and scrap metal quests a few more<br/>\ntimes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to get these Rods and try a few combinations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also have a Gnome Glow Rod.  I got it for turning in scrap metal.  As<br/>\nfar<br/>\n&gt; as I can tell, it&#39;s just a light source.  I have had comments from people<br/>\n&gt; asking me what the heck I was carrying, so they don&#39;t seem to be that<br/>\n&gt; common.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joe D<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
