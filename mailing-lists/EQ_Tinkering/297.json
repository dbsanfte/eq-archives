I wasn&#39;t on at the time of the event, but I<br/>\nlearned about it later when I logged on and got a tell about it and that<br/>\none of the items found in the loot was a collapsible fishing pole.  I was<br/>\ngiven the pole, and from it I was able to make the spyglass (re-read my<br/>\noriginal message to the list...)  Yes, that spyglass formula on the site is<br/>\ncorrect :P  I put up a fairly quick update to the site with the screenshots<br/>\nand such.  On the main page news - &#39;Another update soon&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know the formula for the fishing pole, in case you haven&#39;t guessed<br/>\nit yet.  Should I have mentioned this sooner?  A bad oversight in getting<br/>\nsome info up on two items, which for a tough-to-find-anything skill like<br/>\ntinkering, is great news.  Still, I was rather disappointed at some of the<br/>\ncomments I received...  Anyone remember the old saying for when people<br/>\nASSUME? :P<br/>\n<br/>\nThe items exist in the game.  We don&#39;t know the formula for the fishing<br/>\npole, however.  In that case, why not start a project to find it.  I&#39;ll<br/>\nstart (which I was intending to do aka the update...) creating a list of<br/>\nall the combinations that people try on the site.  Through that we should<br/>\nbe able to find it, right?  I see no reason why not.  For those hesitant<br/>\nabout spending the cash, think of it as an investment 8)<br/>\n<br/>\nAwaiting feedback...<br/>\n<br/>\n-Luke<br/>\nTinkering Guide website:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqportal.com/tinkering\">http://www.eqportal.com/tinkering</a><br/>\nLast updated: 8-8-99</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
