I DO know what I&#39;m talking about.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Borxx lens has nothing to do with the telescope quest.<br/>\n&gt; The telescope lens has nothing to do with the staff quest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They are completely different. Just because there is a lens involved DOES<br/>\n&gt; not mean that they are related. One is a lens made of biological material<br/>\n&gt; that is gotten off of an evil eye named Borxx, if I&#39;m not mistaken.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The others are 4 telescope lenses made of glass, probably made by the<br/>\n&gt; gnomes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A piece of glass for a telescope lens couldn&#39;t be substituted with a lens<br/>\n&gt; from a living things eye, just as the lens of an eye could not be<br/>\n&gt; substituted with a glass lens (and no contacts only assist is correcting<br/>\n&gt; your vision problems which are caused by the actual eye lens). That is all<br/>\n&gt; there is two it -- end of story. The two quests are completely seperate and<br/>\n&gt; have absolutely nothing to do with each other. So if you want to talk about<br/>\n&gt; how to get the Staff of the Observers, then maybe you should subscribe to a<br/>\n&gt; mailing list that is interested in it. This is a tinkering list, so unless<br/>\n&gt; you have some kind of evidence that The Staff is involed in a tinkering<br/>\n&gt; quest, then lets drop it, ok?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sniffledoo Copperheart. 14th rank warrior of The Gemchopper Hall --<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
