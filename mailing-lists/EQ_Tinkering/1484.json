The person who looted it never mentioned it not being the exe<br/>\naxe and<br/>\n&gt; this is the first time I have ever heard of a critter not having a graphic<br/>\nfor a<br/>\n&gt; weapon it has, it was also my second time in lower guk.  As for the pet<br/>\nthing it<br/>\n&gt; may have been a fluke I don&#39;t know as I don&#39;t play anything that uses pets<br/>\nso I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t tell you, but I did clearly see from the executioner &quot;guarding with<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; life oh splendid one&quot; Mersinaz even laughed because we didn&#39;t know what he<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; doing at first.  AND WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO INSULT ME AT LEAST GET THE NAME<br/>\n&gt; SPELLED RIGHT!!!!   As for the pets I am pretty sure the guy who has the<br/>\n&gt; information attained it though illegal methods because he seems very<br/>\ngreasy and<br/>\n&gt; probably won&#39;t ever tell me but I am gonna try and when I get it the<br/>\nperson who<br/>\n&gt; doubted me doesn&#39;t have to use it<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Efrieum<br/>\n&gt; 35 warrior<br/>\n&gt; by the way congratulations Piip on 34<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
