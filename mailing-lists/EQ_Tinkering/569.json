I did not notice any difference in the fishing with these baits.  They seem to work just like regular bait.  The same old rusty daggers, sandals, fresh fish  and scales were caught.   A good friend had caught a bronze dagger with regular bait so I was hoping that I might catch another but no luck.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note,  The animated bait was trivial for me to make.  I dont think I have EVER seen an increase in my skill.  The only thing I have made where I dont get the trivial message it the flameless lantern.
