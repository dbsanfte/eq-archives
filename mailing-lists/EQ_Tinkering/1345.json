First off...whoever stated to &quot;not<br/>\ncare what others sell them for,&quot; well, that is a GREAT idea, so why dont we<br/>\nall just follow it?  This whole argument started because some smart-ass<br/>\nattacked my post of how i sold Lungs.  Therefore i felt i had to defend<br/>\nmyself.  Admit it or not, greed has and will play a BIG part of your sales i<br/>\npresume...if you are such good buisnessmen/women that you all say you are<br/>\nthen you will not have any trouble selling these.  Good for you. i really<br/>\ndont care.  This board is meant for tinkering, so lets keep it at that.  No,<br/>\ni am not ashamed for posting my last post, as everything i stated is true.<br/>\nAs for the buisness side of things, you may be making more money than i am,<br/>\nbut i still have a net profit, and my skill has gone up a lot, and MOST<br/>\nimportantly, i have a VERY loyal customer base. So before you jump on the<br/>\nbandwagon to attack a perfect stranger, why dont you take a look at<br/>\nyourselves first.  last night i sold 8 lungs, think you an do better? net<br/>\nprofit: 1400plat ( after replenishing my stock).<br/>\nthis is my style of buisness, it is working rather splendidly for me, so why<br/>\ndo you care?<br/>\n-Ranth</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
