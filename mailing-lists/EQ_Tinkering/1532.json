My gnome is 27th and<br/>\naccording to the skill cap that we had figured out [(lvl-15)*5], my max<br/>\nskill should be 60.  However on the weekend I was able to raise it to 65<br/>\nwith no problems at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, I had a very good success rate.  I was able to raise my<br/>\nskill 15 points after making 37 flameless lanterns and only failed 5 times<br/>\n- I had worse results with blacksmithing!  My Int was 163 and my wis was<br/>\n91  (thanks to a kind enchanter who cast Insight and Brilliance on me -<br/>\nhighly recommend getting these buffs before attempting to raise skill). <br/>\nHas anyone else had similar results?  I&#39;m wondering if Verrant made the<br/>\nskill a little easier after receiving so many complaints.<br/>\n<br/>\nQdP<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Quasinom de Plume is my quasi nom-de-plume&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Wopr &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:inewton@...\">inewton@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On the skill cap issue, I know it used to exist if only for the number<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; people that would complain about no increases on this list.
