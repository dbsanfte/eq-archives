If I ever met you in real life, I would charge <br/>\n&gt;you full speed and attack you out right, I wouldn&#39;t care if you were a huge, <br/>\n&gt;700 ton sumo, or a muscle bound Goldberg-wannabe, or if you were a weak <br/>\n&gt;frail, dying old granny, or whatever. I would make a swift attampt to kick <br/>\n&gt;you with (I&#39;d be wearing me wonderful cleats of course)  all my evil hatred <br/>\n&gt;and rage I have sucesessfully built up my entire life. I&#39;d attempt to kick <br/>\n&gt;you in the face, which, if succsessful would probably send you to the ground <br/>\n&gt;in pain, then I wouldn&#39;t stop. I&#39;d beat you around, crush your ribs, kick <br/>\n&gt;you where it hurts till there wasn&#39;t even enough for the docters to scrap, <br/>\n&gt;making it so wouldn&#39;t ever be able to have any more bastard offspring to <br/>\n&gt;polute the world, then I&#39;d crush your face a little more, mutilating it <br/>\n&gt;beyond reccognition, and do a little bit more for good measure. Why? <br/>\n&gt;Because, you are a bastard. I&#39;d be one too if I did that, but frankly I <br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t care, because I hate you, bastard. Yes yes, hate. Hate is used so <br/>\n&gt;much, but it is so often not used correctly, true hate is like true love, it <br/>\n&gt;is an extremely powerful thing, but it is also extremely rare, for it is the <br/>\n&gt;exact opposite of ture love. I truely hate you. Now you look up at what I <br/>\n&gt;said I would do to you, and you ask yourself, what could cause someone to <br/>\n&gt;want to do that? Well, it was your horrible, totally unnesassary words that <br/>\n&gt;you said so horribly about me. Now, really think to yourself, do you feel <br/>\n&gt;GOOD that you said something so bad,so HORRIBLE that you made a person <br/>\n&gt;TRUELY HATE you?<br/>\n&gt;I hope you don&#39;t think this is funny because it is not at all. I hope you <br/>\n&gt;are sorry for doing that, you must be a truely horrid person if you could so <br/>\n&gt;quickly make someone hate you like you have to me. And if you think it is <br/>\n&gt;funny, or don&#39;t care, then you are a truely sick person too. People like you <br/>\n&gt;are so terribly sick, and don&#39;t deserve the very oxygen they breath. I wish <br/>\n&gt;to never hear from you again. If I never even think about you even in my <br/>\n&gt;subconcious again, it will be WAY to soon. Just get out of my life, and <br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t even bother replying to this message becasue I&#39;m quittingthis letter <br/>\n&gt;right now so I don&#39;t have to hear from you again. I hope you are happy about <br/>\n&gt;this horrible sick, disgusting thing you have done, I hope you&#39;re real <br/>\n&gt;happy...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;___________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n </span></blockquote>____<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;___________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n </span></blockquote>____<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
