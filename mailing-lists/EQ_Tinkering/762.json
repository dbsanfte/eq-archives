In<br/>\nthere was a huge gnome, the size of a woodelf, which<br/>\nI�ve never seen or heard about before. His name was<br/>\nsome typical gnome name, with a four letter first<br/>\nname, and Fiddlebiddle or something as his surname.<br/>\nWhen I hailed him he said something like: &quot;Don�t you<br/>\nfind the girls in Kelethin sweet as their wine?&quot; I<br/>\ntried to ask him different things, but he didn�t<br/>\nreact. I also tried to give him elven wine, but he<br/>\nonly said &quot;thank you&quot;. I can�t remember what he<br/>\nconned, but I wouldn�t have killed him anyway,<br/>\nprobably bad faction. <br/>\nDoes anyone have any experience or information about<br/>\nthis guy? Could he be tinkering related? This happened<br/>\nafter the last patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, concerning the gnome spelunker in Unrest: You<br/>\nsay he KOS everyone, but has any necro tried to go<br/>\nnear him? If there are any high level necro�s on this<br/>\nlist, would they be interested in trying to get in<br/>\ntouch with him?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, about gathering tinkering info: Wouldn�t it be a<br/>\ngood idea to gather all info we found about all the<br/>\nNPC gnomes in Norrath on a web-page? What all gnome<br/>\nmerchants sold, what quests they are related too and<br/>\nso on? What factions do you get if you kill them, who<br/>\ndo they KOS and not? <br/>\nAnyone interested in doing this?<br/>\n<br/>\nPiip Ignatz<br/>\nrogue of the 24th grade<br/>\nInnoruuk server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
