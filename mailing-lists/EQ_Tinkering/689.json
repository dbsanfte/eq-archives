First, I will tell you exactly HOW I came upon the <br/>\n information as well as some other things, then I will tell you what my <br/>\n search yeilded.<br/>\n <br/>\n First, it was long ago, on this very list that one person said something <br/>\n about a monk. He said the the monk named Lindel on the Veeshan server seemed <br/>\n to know more thta he let&#39;s on. No one payed much mind to the statement, but <br/>\n I figured &quot;Heck, I play on the Veeshan, so I can check it out, see if he <br/>\n does know anything&quot;. I added him to my friends list and checked if he was on <br/>\n all the time. He didn&#39;t come on for a long time, but then he did. I very <br/>\n politely asked if he knew anything about the collapsible fishing pole, and a <br/>\n lagre conversation ensuded. I led on that I had spent much time searching <br/>\n for the pole, and it&#39;s secret. (I know it was a lie, but I didn&#39;t want to <br/>\n just demand the information) I told him that I would tell no one, and begged <br/>\n it from him. He told me that he couldn&#39;t tell me, and I asked him why. He <br/>\n said that only he and other &quot;members of the mark&quot; knew about it. He said <br/>\n they were a small group of friends that knew the secret. I asked him if I <br/>\n could join the mark, but he said that they approach YOU about joining, not <br/>\n the other way around. I think the the mark, as he called it, it probably a <br/>\n &quot;secret&quot; group of people, not bound by any guild name. They might be even an <br/>\n inter-server group. I begged and pushed him more, telling him that I had <br/>\n searched forever, and deserved at least a hint. I told him that I had <br/>\n searched the world over many times. Then he said something to the effect of: <br/>\n &quot;You have searched the world over, but have you searched it below?&quot; He then <br/>\n went to further say: &quot;Search beneath the waves.&quot;<br/>\n This I though, could be the break we needed, now we don&#39;t have to search <br/>\n totaly aimlessly. I doubt that he was lying, too, the way we went about the <br/>\n conversation, I belive he was giving true hints.<br/>\n <br/>\n Now, I will tell what I came up with. The first part of the clue he said to <br/>\n search underground, basically. Ak&#39;Anon is underground, so that was the first <br/>\n place to come to mind, because it also had a lake, which would justify the <br/>\n &quot;Search beneath the waves&quot; part, which could also mean the oceans, or other <br/>\n bodies of water, but for now, I wanted to stick with Ak&#39;Anon. I figured that <br/>\n there could be some sort of secret entrance, a fake wall leading into a <br/>\n hidden cave or something. I finally got back to Ak&#39;Anon tonight and search <br/>\n around a bit. Altough my search was not thuroughly extensive, I did find <br/>\n something VERY VERY interesting (altough it wasn&#39;t in the water). I found, <br/>\n on the ground, an item called An old silver coin. It looked like a normal <br/>\n silver coin, but it was an actual item. The strangest thing, though was that <br/>\n it was a MAGIC ITEM, a LORE ITEM, AND...NO DROP! But wait! Items that are no <br/>\n drop can&#39;t be on the ground, but that was where I found it. SO! It must be a <br/>\n quest item, an item that spawned, not something dropped by another player. I <br/>\n think that it may be related to something we are looking for. For now, <br/>\n though, we should all have our very own old silver coins. I found it in the <br/>\n room with the ater wheel, on the other side of the bridge on the high cliff <br/>\n above the scrap yard with the Syford Montop guy. It was next to one ofthose <br/>\n rotating little star thingies. One without a stand. Hope you can all find <br/>\n one, so that we can have more and see about what they might be used for.<br/>\n <br/>\n Also, I think we should all try to brainstorm about what Lindels clues might <br/>\n have meant. Well now that you have it, my information, feel free to make <br/>\n comments and add ideas. For now, I must part. Good luck, friends.<br/>\n <br/>\n Sniffledoo Copperheart of Veeshan. &gt;&gt;<br/>\nI too Found a silver coin with the same stats but it was in the fountian of <br/>\nthe magic guild in Erudin.....Cloverleaf &lt;Fennin Ro Server&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
