He have only dropped a pirate earring each time I<br/>\nhave killed him. You arent losing any faction with<br/>\nAkAnon either, actually killing these pirates gives<br/>\nsome nice factions with &quot;good&quot; people around Norrath.<br/>\nGornit, the giant at their side, will not trouble you<br/>\neither, as long as you keep a watchful eye on him<br/>\nwhile you pull (it may pay off to keep an eye on<br/>\ncyclopes too). He regularilly wanders from the waters<br/>\nedge, to the pirate camp, and back, but can easily be<br/>\ntimed. I was doing this with a lvl 20ish group, to get<br/>\nthe Bracer of Errolisi, that drops from the pirate<br/>\ncaptain. Anyway, my point is I doubt it drops from<br/>\nhim, but it even if I think so, it could still be a<br/>\nrare drop, I havent killed him that many times.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaptain Piip Ignatz<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Lofts/4125/pirates.html\">http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Lofts/4125/pirates.html</a><br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
