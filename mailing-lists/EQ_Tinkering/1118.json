Flare had the same problem after thier 2nd major <br/>\npatch.. took em 6 weeks to fix. but it&#39;s working now.. so i think it can be patched rather easily <br/>\nif they know the cause.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Are there more books out there?? new recipies to find, etc... so far I see perhaps 2 items of any USE<br/>\nin this trade.. Cams, and possibly the lockpicks.  The rest are for FUN and not really needed in the<br/>\ngame yet.. (possibly the Stalking probes could be usefull if the duration was not 5 seconds :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMeraxes Glibilskym, Fennin Ro<br/>\nGnomish Magician and Tinkerer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
