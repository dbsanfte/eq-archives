BUT, the person who<br/>\nremarked about the guard killers is VERY right. Jogl stands right next to<br/>\nthe watchman at the Windmills when he&#39;s outside.. and WILL aggro on guard<br/>\nkillers ... so he usually ends up getting popped if that happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe REALLY bad news? Jogl Doobraugh is on a RARE RARE spawn timer. 9 times<br/>\nout of 10 when I was first trying to do the Bootstrutter&#39;s Pack quest.. he<br/>\nwas dead and wouldn&#39;t repop. He doesn&#39;t pop in and out, he stays popped in..<br/>\nand moves around from outside Windmill 1 to inside Windmill 3. If you can&#39;t<br/>\nfind him anywhere, he&#39;s been killed and will most likely NOT repop until the<br/>\nnext Server Reboot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnytime I am trying to finish quests in / around AkAnon I always wait till<br/>\nright after a server reboot. Makes it easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuni Gearspinner<br/>\n[33rd Circle Gnome Mage - Karana Server]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
