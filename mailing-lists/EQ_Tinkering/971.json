I want to find the last<br/>\nbook, I don&#39;t know if the info released was from the same person who told<br/>\nme the recipes, but, the only clue that I got from this person was that<br/>\nthe book was in Steamfront Mountains and NOT in Ak&#39;anon . <br/>\n<br/>\nThats all I have got to go on, and he/she will not give me any more info.<br/>\nI am thinking it may be a timed spawn somewhere.  The person who found the<br/>\nbook said it was by some freak accident and that he/she happened apon the<br/>\n&quot;LOCATION&quot; by accident. He/she also said you need to be patient.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun with this, maybe we can find it out.  I don&#39;t understand if the<br/>\nrecipe is out why wouldn&#39;t this person want to release the info.  I dunno</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
