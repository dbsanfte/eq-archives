Shall we be agreed on what to charge for this?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been trying to get the gnomes on Bertoxx to have a set price and not <br/>\nhave any undercutters. I myself was thinking 7pp for a pole.. but if you can <br/>\nsell em for 20pp, I&#39;m game. As for a spyglass I was thinking 40pp was a nice <br/>\nset price, but again.. if people buy em for 75pp that sounds good too =) But <br/>\nI&#39;m positive we can sell a lot more if we charge double the cost of the <br/>\nparts as opposed to 5x. I&#39;d like to see what you guys have to say about this <br/>\nsubject.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be great if we can work together and all sell for the same price so <br/>\nit&#39;s not like other trade skills where someone sells something for the cost <br/>\n+ 1pp or something then when you try to sell your wares for the cost x 5 you <br/>\ndon&#39;t have some newbie yelling out &quot;D00d I just bought my fishing pole for <br/>\n5pp man this guy is rippin you all off.&quot; Yeah that was a run-on sentence.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I think it would be great if we could keep the tinkering market <br/>\ncontrolled. I know we have a gnome guild on Bertoxx so it will be easy to <br/>\nkeep the items at a set price for awhile, and if you see anyone else <br/>\nstarting tinkering then tell em the deal too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I worded all that right. yeah.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what are your commments about what the fixed price for each item should <br/>\nbe? I&#39;ll start with this little table (thanks to Gnomad for the table from <br/>\nhis website =):<br/>\n<br/>\nITEM               ROUGH COST TO MAKE  MY SUGGESTED FIXED PRICE<br/>\nAnimated Bait              4cp         5cp No one buys this anyway<br/>\nCompass                    4pp         5pp Evil races may want this<br/>\n(note that compasses cost more to make since the pottery patch)<br/>\nFlameless Lantern          2pp         2pp No one buys this anyway<br/>\nMechanized Lockpicks       18pp        40pp Still hard to sell<br/>\nBow Cam                    15pp        30pp Sounds right<br/>\nStalking Probes            18pp        25pp? no clue<br/>\nSpyglass                   20pp        40pp 2x cost sounds right to me<br/>\nCollapsible Fishing Pole   5pp         7pp Sounds ok<br/>\nGnomish Fireworks          5g          Wait till this is fixed before we <br/>\neven think of selling these =(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso let&#39;s find a way to raise our faction with the merchants too so we pay <br/>\na lot less for those expensive components =) Also note that Merchant Faction <br/>\nonly affects the, umm.. &quot;real&quot; gnome merchants, not the clockwork <br/>\nmerchants...
