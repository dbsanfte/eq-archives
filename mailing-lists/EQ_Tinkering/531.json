I<br/>\nknow this book exists and to prove it I&#39;ll give you the one formula I was<br/>\nable to get out of the person who has it. animated bait -- 1 cork, 1<br/>\nspricket. the only purpose I can find for this is practice for non gnomes<br/>\nsince the two things cost much more than bait and it&#39;s trivial for a gnome.<br/>\npersonally I think the book is in Solusek&#39;s eye, the tinkering merchant has<br/>\nto be there for some reason. I just hope we don&#39;t have to kill a gnome for<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nFixer gnomish enchanter </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
