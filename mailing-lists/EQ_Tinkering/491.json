I <br/>\nam just not sure which pieces to start trying out, I was thinking maybe some <br/>\nmetal twine to connect the lenses. Has this been discussed, anyone brought <br/>\nany ideas into it?  And also for those of you who haven&#39;t heard, I&#39;ve had 2 <br/>\npeople mail me on existance of the lenses.. They are called the &quot;Lens of <br/>\nGlowing Amber&quot; Which makes me pretty much think that they are definately the <br/>\nfirst component.  And they are dropped by a froglock summoner in upper guk.  <br/>\nPersonally I am not high enough to go find these myself yet..So have not <br/>\npersonally seen one but have seen various posts enough to know that they do <br/>\nexist..except people don&#39;t know what to do with them. And I am sure this is <br/>\na rare drop because you just don&#39;t see those over the auction channels <br/>\neveryday..;)<br/>\n<br/>\nShokakon<br/>\nGnome Necromancer of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
