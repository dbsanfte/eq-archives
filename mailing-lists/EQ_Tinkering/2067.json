I suspect there may <br/>\nbe &#39;hell&#39; levels you have to work through.  I recently started to tinker <br/>\nwith my character.  I made flameless lanterns all the way to 68, then <br/>\nswitched to cams.  I did 8 at a time with the cams.  The first batch, I was <br/>\n6 for 8.  The next batch, I was 8 for 8.  I was at skill 74 after that (75 <br/>\nis trivial).  I then went 1 for 6 getting that last point.  I&#39;ve begun <br/>\nmaking stalking probes since they are cheaper to make than the <br/>\nspyglasses.  I don&#39;t have firm stats on it, but I did 50% for about 10, <br/>\nthen went on a 1 for 6 streak, then back to 50% again for the next 4.  I <br/>\nsuspect there may be some sticking points you have to work through (for <br/>\nexample, skill level of 73 might bring more successes than 74).   I know it <br/>\nseems odd, but its either that, or I had a run of bad luck.  BTW, nothing <br/>\nchanged during any of the attempts, 109 wisdom, 140 intelligence.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtiny of Bristlebane<br/>\n16th Enchanter<br/>\n~80 tinkering ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:12 PM 3/14/00 -0800, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Jeff Price &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeffreyjprice@...\">jeffreyjprice@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Out of my first 2 attempts I manufactured 2.<br/>\n&gt;Out of my next 8 attemps I manufactured NONE!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And here I thought I was just a stupid warrior!
