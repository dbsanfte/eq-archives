The good news is the Telescope Lens and Collapsable Fishing Pole CAN be made.  And, you DO have to use a collapsable fishing pole to make the telescope.

He is a gnome on Xegony by the name of Salvadori, so if you can pry the recipe from him, good luck.  I tried.  Well, also, he said that Tinkering skill improvement had been fixed, and he was up in the 60&#39;s on skill.  So keep tinkering.<br/>\n<br/>\nXalastile<br/>\nLevel 22 Magician<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
