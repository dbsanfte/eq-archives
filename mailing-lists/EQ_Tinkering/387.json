Next after those the<br/>\nleast likely candidates are the gnomish bolts, the metal twine, the bamboo<br/>\npole, and the cork. Although there could be an argument made that a &#39;cork&#39;<br/>\ncould be used.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, that leaves us the following 7 components to work with<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fishing Pole<br/>\n&gt; metal rod<br/>\n&gt; grease<br/>\n&gt; metal shaft<br/>\n&gt; gears<br/>\n&gt; sprockets<br/>\n&gt; Cloth Cord (from a tailor I assume, I have never used this in a<br/>\ncombination)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This significantly narrows the field, and I would highly recommend that we<br/>\nexhaust all combinations of these items before moving on to others.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mostly likely the recipe has from 3 to 5 components. Some have made an<br/>\nargument that since the original tinker tool box had only 4 spaces, that the<br/>\nrecipe has 3 or 4 components. This may be true but hey, Verant screwed up on<br/>\nthe compass, why not the pole? =|<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We should exhaust all combinations of 4 and 5 components before moving on<br/>\nto recipes with 6 or more components.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is highly likely that the recipe contains more than 1 metal shaft or<br/>\nmetal rod, perhaps as many as 3. While combinations using 2 and 3<br/>\nrods/shafts WITH the fishing pole have almost been exhausted (check the<br/>\n&#39;pole database&#39;), I have noticed we still have quite a few combinations left<br/>\nto try that EXCLUDE a regular fishing pole, but INCLUDE 2/3 rods or shafts.<br/>\nThere are very few of the &#39;double shaft&#39; and &#39;triple shaft&#39; combinations<br/>\nthat exclude the fishing pole yet to be tried.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Having exhausted all of these, then the most likely possibilities are that<br/>\nthere is some component somewhere that we are missing, perhaps there is a<br/>\ntinkered item like a &#39;reel&#39; that we need to make first before combining it<br/>\nto make the fishing pole, or Verant has once again screwed the tinkers of<br/>\nthe world... =|<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While I tend to lean toward the latter, the possibility of having to<br/>\n&#39;pre-tinker&#39; a reel for the rod sounds intriguing...  blah...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anywho, thats my 500 plat on the matter or so (I have spent a hell of a<br/>\nlot more than 2 cents).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FizzWizz of tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!
