Anyways, the<br/>\ninteresting part is that when I killed the minotaur I lost faction with the<br/>\nking, gemchoppers, eldritch collective etc...  The reason I think this is<br/>\ninteresting is because the book mentions campturing a minotaur for the zoo,<br/>\nand its also interesting that whoever made the zoo went through the trouble<br/>\nof giving this minotaur good faction with the gnomes.  The tiger and bear<br/>\nhad no faction hit at all, but the minotaur does.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried talking to the minotaur and giving him various things but it didn&#39;t<br/>\nhelp any, I also tried talking to the keeper underneath the minotaur and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t make any progress there either.  But they are definately linked somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nRotgut</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
