Also see if you can get one of the +15 charisma &#39;crude steins&#39;<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; the bouncer in feerot. Having a charisma of 86 instead of 60 makes a ton<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; difference cash wise while you are doing all this tinkering.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also realize that you can NOT gain more than 1 point in tinkering<br/>\n&gt; until<br/>\n&gt; you get to *21*. You are stuck at 51 until then and I forget what your<br/>\n&gt; max<br/>\n&gt; is per level.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Note, your milage may vary, but the first thing one should try to<br/>\n&gt; tinker<br/>\n&gt; to gain skill is the flameless lanterns. I would usually do about 20 at<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; time and it would cost somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 30 plat to<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; (after selling the lanterns back) depending on your success rate and<br/>\n&gt; charisma. Sometimes I would gain nothing, sometimes 4 or 5 points, its<br/>\n&gt; very<br/>\n&gt; random. On average I would say I gained about a point per 20 lanterns<br/>\n&gt; which<br/>\n&gt; means I approximately spent about 20 to 30 plat per point up to 68 where<br/>\n&gt; lanterns get trivial.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; YES, you CAN make some cash selling the cams to bowers. While nothing<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; write home about you can make some fairly decent pocket change. I<br/>\n&gt; started<br/>\n&gt; making cams at 68 (when lanterns became trivial) and my success rate was<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; too bad. I could sell the cams for 25 plat to bowers, where they would<br/>\n&gt; usually spend about 40 plat. They are usually VERY happy to find a<br/>\n&gt; tinker<br/>\n&gt; that can make cams...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Gaining skill gets a bit more expensive here since each attempt cost<br/>\n&gt; maybe<br/>\n&gt; 12 to 15 plat. But as with the lanterns I figure I would gain about a<br/>\n&gt; point<br/>\n&gt; every 20 cams or so, which means you really need to find a place to sell<br/>\n&gt; your cams to support your tinkering habit. I was able to get my skill up<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; 75 making cams.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And thats where my story ends, without the fishing pole/telescope to<br/>\n&gt; practice on tinkering has no future for me short of making a bit of<br/>\n&gt; pocket<br/>\n&gt; change on cams. Damn those verant bastards, I still get an unexeptable<br/>\n&gt; rate<br/>\n&gt; of failure on cams even though they are trivial. =|<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hope this helps, if there does exist a kind soul willing to share the<br/>\n&gt; fishing pole recipe I would be eternally grateful.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; FizzWizz of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 35 Wizard<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
