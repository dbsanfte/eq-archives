Please forgive my verbosity for I am a quiet","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-917893812\">Fellow Tinkers,<br/>\n<br/>\nI come before you with open arms and open log books<br/>\nto report the history of my tinkering.  Please<br/>\nforgive my verbosity for I am a quiet tinkering<br/>\ngnome wizard that spends much time muttering to<br/>\nhimself. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nI made each of the following in order until it went<br/>\ntrivial.  Flameless Lanterns, Standard Bow Cams,<br/>\nSpyglasses, and finally Stalking Probes.  This of<br/>\ncourse got me to 102 skill.  At no point did I<br/>\nattempt an item until every lesser item was<br/>\ntrivial.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, I have always sold Spyglasses for<br/>\n80pp and have sold well over 100 of them but lost<br/>\ncount.  I&#39;ve sold 18 in a night before.  I have<br/>\nfirmly established 80pp as the going rate on Povar<br/>\nthrough endless auctioning in all manner of zones,<br/>\nbe it newbie, mid-level, or LGuk/SolB.  Spyglasses<br/>\nare a great way to help finance Aqualung attempts.<br/>\n<br/>\n/auction Selling tinkered Spyglass with unlimited<br/>\ncharges of Telescope (like binoculars).  Great for<br/>\npullers!  80pp.  Use it to spot that rare wandering<br/>\nspawn!<br/>\n<br/>\n/auction Selling tinkered Spyglass with unlimited<br/>\ncharges of Telescope (like binoculars).  Great for<br/>\npullers!  80pp.  Use it to spot naked newbies!<br/>\n<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the below Aqualungs, I painfully, over many<br/>\nweeks, sold all of the first 30 I produced.  I<br/>\ncharged 500pp for each and barely covered costs.<br/>\n<br/>\n/auction Selling a tinkered Aqualung with 50<br/>\ncharges of waterbreathing (half hour RL each) for<br/>\n500pp (merchant pays 190pp, so 310pp net). To<br/>\ncompare, 50 EB potions costs 600pp and do not<br/>\nstack!  Declare your independence from EB casters!<br/>\nSupport the trades!<br/>\n<br/>\n/auction Selling a tinkered Aqualung with 50<br/>\ncharges of waterbreathing (half hour RL each) for<br/>\n500pp (merchant pays 190pp, so 310pp net).

It&#39;s winter, help the fish keep their<br/>\nscales!<br/>\n<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen tinkering Aqualungs, I got a wis suit from<br/>\na plat level enchanter friend.  I would get these<br/>\nbuffs from a 44+ enchanter (/who all enc 44 50):<br/>\nwis/int/str/cha.  Since I am a wizard, I could<br/>\ngo to them while being bound at the tinkering<br/>\nmerchant or the Ak&#39;Anon bank as the mood struck.<br/>\nI would replace int gear with wis gear until my<br/>\nint (with buff) was 199 and my wis was 132.  I<br/>\nnever bought or sold with a cha less than 100.  By<br/>\nthe way, cha over 100 is the same as cha 100.<br/>\nAlso, pay a plat and get a SoW...speeds things up.<br/>\n<br/>\nTries Successes Failures Skill Increases<br/>\n----- --------- -------- ---------------<br/>\n   6       4        2           0<br/>\n  10       4        6           3<br/>\n  20      10       10           3<br/>\n  30      12       18           6<br/>\n  38      29        9           7<br/>\n  24      16        8           4<br/>\n  16      11        5           6<br/>\n  52      46        6           6<br/>\n  40      31        9          10<br/>\n  10       7        3           1*<br/>\n----- --------- -------- ---------------<br/>\n 246     170       76          46<br/>\n 100%   69.10%   30.89%      18.70%<br/>\n<br/>\n* Was trivial on the 3rd try of this batch.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the first 30 successes were sold, I sold<br/>\nmy Runed Cowl for fort knox to a level 50 wizard<br/>\nand converted all the items into cash.  Along<br/>\nwith what I already had, this got me a nestegg<br/>\nof 17kpp.  I did the last 180 tries of Aqualungs<br/>\nby selling the successes back to the merchant.<br/>\nThis cost me 12.5kpp to reach the trivial point.<br/>\nIf anyone on Povar has a spare Runed Cowl, I<br/>\nwould be very thankful. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that my cost-with-failures per Aqualung is<br/>\nnow 270pp, Rebreathers are 966pp per try.  I will<br/>\nnow charge the public 400pp per Aqualung.  The<br/>\nRebreather will cost the public 3000pp or trade<br/>\nequivalent.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven just those prices, 7.5 Aqualungs can be<br/>\nbought for the price on one Rebreather.  That&#39;s<br/>\n187.5 RL hours under water.  And that doesn&#39;t<br/>\ncount the fact that the Aqualung, once used, can<br/>\nbe sold to a merchant for some plats to help buy<br/>\neven more Aqualungs for the same net cost as the<br/>\nRebreather.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no question in my mind that the Aqualung<br/>\nis a much more economical solution and the<br/>\nRebreather is just nice for those people with too<br/>\nmuch money.  To put the final nail in the coffin,<br/>\nAqualungs can be activated from the inventory<br/>\nbut Rebreathers must be worn in the head slot.<br/>\nFor the average caster with a Runed Cowl or tank<br/>\nwith a massive helm, this is a real pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I thought I&#39;d share my broader trade<br/>\nskill experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrade     Skill<br/>\n-----     -----<br/>\nBaking     142<br/>\nBrewing    143<br/>\nPottery    146<br/>\nSmithing   138<br/>\nTinkering  148<br/>\n-----     -----<br/>\nTotal      717<br/>\ni.e. I&#39;d be level 50 by now otherwise  lol<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally have some Brownie Parts, so Birthday<br/>\nCakes are next.
