My skill is currently 118, in my<br/>\nlast 16 lung attempts, I&#39;ve succeeded only 4 times.  These attempts<br/>\nwere done over a period of a month or so.  I only recently decided to<br/>\ntry tinkering again, thinking that my prior experience was just a<br/>\nbad-luck streak.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2nd to last batch of lungs cost me 800p per lung.  My most recent<br/>\nbatch cost me 1000p per lung.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else noticed or experienced this?<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps a change was made to weigh wisdom more heavily in the formula?<br/>\n<br/>\nI blew 1750p last night, and walked away with ONE lung.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m about ready to write off tinkering as a skill only practiced by<br/>\nthe insane.  I&#39;d love to make lungs and provide them to my party<br/>\nmembers for kedge hunting - but at these prices, it&#39;s just insanity.<br/>\n<br/>\nVlorre<br/>\n47 Wiz,  E&#39;ci<br/>\nMaster Tinker (118 skill)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
