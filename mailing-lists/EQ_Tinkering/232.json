I make them for about <br/>\n3pp, better now with my +17 charisma gear I have, and sell them for 5pp <br/>\neach.  This is the auction line I have found works the best:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Selling TINKERED compass, 5pp, great if you have poor sense heading, 100% <br/>\nsuccess rate, don&#39;t be fooled by cheap knock-off imports, buy direct from <br/>\nthe artisan, support the trades!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the last bit &quot;support the trades&quot; helps a bit since I have sold 2 <br/>\nto people with good sense heading but buy trade items just to provide support.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have sold only 10 so far, so I guess I&#39;ve made 20pp, not much, but better <br/>\nthan losing money.  Just sucks that you don&#39;t get experience from them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:42 PM 07/23/1999 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Kendera the Enchantress&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kendera_@...\">kendera_@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yikes! It costs approx. 2pp to make a flameless lantern, and THIS is the <br/>\n&gt;item used to increase skill??<br/>\n&gt;How many lanterns does it take to increase 1 point?  This sounds extremely <br/>\n&gt;expensive to me.<br/>\n&gt;I eventually want to make Mechanized Lockpicks, but it sounds like this is <br/>\n&gt;gonna be way too costly.  Any profit in tinkering at all?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for any help,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kreena Nimbletoes<br/>\n&gt;14th lvl Fighter ;)<br/>\n&gt;Prexus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Making flameless lanterns is the way to go to gain skill, a warning though<br/>\n&gt;&gt;one of the patches sort of messed with tinkering where you will rarely gain<br/>\n&gt;&gt;skill points now.  I don&#39;t know if this has been changed.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;The only place to buy tinkering components is in Steamfont.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;-Luke </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
