Greed has nothing to do with <br/>\n&gt;&gt; running a business. The point of trading skill is for max profit. 100pp for <br/>\n&gt;&gt; spyglass is the going rate, I sold many and none of them are idiots. As for <br/>\n&gt;&gt; the Aqua Lung I sold about 9 so far at 650pp each, although 1000pp is a bit <br/>\n&gt;&gt; at the higher end if anyone can sell them then more power to him/her. And it <br/>\n&gt;&gt; is not fooling the masses, do you have any idea how much it cost to raise the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; skill to master? and even then the success rate is only 50% at best. Next <br/>\n&gt;&gt; time try to know what you are talking about before opening that little hole <br/>\n&gt;&gt; of yours. Lastly I am proud to be a gnome, and it&#39;s people like you who is <br/>\n&gt;&gt; ruining us gnomes. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The point of the trading skills is NOT max profit, but to make another<br/>\npart of the game enjoyable for others.  Just like the point of the<br/>\ngame in general is NOT to reach lvl 50 fastest.  Its only the inborn<br/>\ngreed that causes 80+% of the players to play that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile there is a reasonable price for the items, that allows for<br/>\ncontinuance of working on the skills, some ppl are gona charge less,<br/>\nand some more...  If your a greedy SOB, then anyone selling for less<br/>\nthan you are is hurting your profit, as they steal bussiness and give<br/>\nyou a bad rep (?desearved?).  If you undercut all the time, you hurt<br/>\nyourself long term as you slowly go broke.   You hurt the others that<br/>\njust want to continue to practice the skill in the short term as they<br/>\ncant sell. its all a balance...  if matterals cost X and you fail 50%<br/>\nof the time on average, then logical selling price is 2X, most tack on<br/>\na profit so that they dont feel its wasted time, when they coulda been<br/>\nsitten on their butts waiting for mob X with cool/sellable/tradable<br/>\nitem Y to pop....  The question is: if somebody walks up to you and<br/>\nsays &quot;heres all the parts, please combine those for me. if you fail,<br/>\nno worrys.&quot; would you do it?  Or would you charge them for the 30sec<br/>\nit takes to hit combine.  You didn&#39;t spend any cash on the item, and<br/>\nif its not a triv item, then your gaining skill (possibly) for free...<br/>\n<br/>\ngrr, this develeped into a rant about the economy. grrr. sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just hate to see this go the way of jewelry. where they all sat<br/>\ndown, and desided what they would sell at, and to ostrisize anyone<br/>\nthat didn&#39;t follow the norm. most of the prices where 2-3x _profit_ at<br/>\nthat point...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
