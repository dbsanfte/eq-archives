Thus I was not directly calling anybody any names, merely drawing<br/>\nan analogy to some of the behavior that is currently going on.  In fact, I<br/>\ndeliberately avoided using any names just so that nobody could accuse me of<br/>\nattacking any specific person.  However, it seems that the post failed in<br/>\nit&#39;s intended purpose, which was TO GET YOU ALL TO STOP SPAMMING ME WITH<br/>\nYOUR PERSONAL VENDETTAS.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest, I stopped looking at names after the first flurry of insults<br/>\nand just deleted any mail with &quot;Skill cap&quot; in it.  I have no idea, nor do I<br/>\nreally care, who started what and who&#39;s right or wrong at this point.  I&#39;d<br/>\nbe happy if we just started acting like adults again.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Linus Gustafsson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:linusgson@...\">linusgson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, calling someone a mentally deficient child is not an insult??<br/>\n<br/>\nAt my age, beeing called a child is a bit insulting :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Sandortien again :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
