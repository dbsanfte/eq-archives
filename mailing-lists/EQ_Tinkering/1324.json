Maybe it will be of use to someone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have been a member of this list for some time now, just waiting, reading,<br/>\n&gt;and hoping for the day that tinkering would become useful.  Well I decided<br/>\n&gt;when these aqualungs and rebreathers came out to give it a shot.  Here is<br/>\n&gt;my story<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Day 1: Invested 750plat into tinkering and got to 75 skill<br/>\n&gt;Day 2: Invested another 750plat and got to 85 skill.<br/>\n&gt;Day 3: Invested 1400plat and got my skill to 102.<br/>\n&gt;Day 3: Invested 1000plat in aqualungs, 4 attempts, 2 successes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Day 4: Invested (about) 1750plat in aqualungs.  7 attempts and 5 successes.<br/>\n Gained 2 points of skill for a total of 104.  Maybe its time to do some Ak<br/>\nAkanon quests to improve my vendor faction.  That could help to bring my<br/>\nprices down a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was able to make so many attmpts because I had a level 45 enchanter buff<br/>\nthe heck out of my Charisma, Intiligence, and Wisdom.  I had 191 Int, 100<br/>\nwis, and 105 cha during all 7 of these attempts.  Normally I don&#39;t have<br/>\nsuch good buffs in place.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;As updated information for the website<br/>\n&gt;The spyglass trivilas at 101.  it wasn&#39;t trivial at 100 (I checked)<br/>\n&gt;The Stalking Probes Trivial out at 102.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Unless the Gemcutter comes through somehow (assuming someone finds out<br/>\n&gt;where diamond dust can be found, only aqualungs can raise my skill any<br/>\n </span></blockquote>further.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I haven&#39;t sold any yet, but I am hopeing to get between 600 and 750 plat<br/>\n&gt;for them.  I don&#39;t see much of a market for them as Shamen, Druids, and<br/>\n&gt;Enchanters all can cast the Enduring Breath spell.<br/>\n&gt;Just as a note of the 3900plat I have spent, a good chunk of it came from<br/>\n&gt;members of my guild.  Even at level 42 I just don&#39;t have this kind of money<br/>\n&gt;kicking around.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;With the help of friendly enchanters and a Crude Stine I try to get the<br/>\n&gt;best prices.  Current Relavent stats are<br/>\n&gt;Wisdom: 88<br/>\n&gt;Intiligence: 187<br/>\n&gt;Charisma: 75 (87-110) (buffed)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If I had truely known it was going to be this expensive, I may not have<br/>\n&gt;started the task, but once I took the first donation from my guildmates I<br/>\n&gt;had no choice but to continue.  So if anyone wants aqualungs on Fennin Ro,<br/>\n&gt;just look me up.  I am shooting for 750pp each to the public, but if you<br/>\n&gt;tell me you read it here I will go as low as 600.  With a 50% succes rate I<br/>\n&gt;just can&#39;t go any lower and still hope to break try to break even.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am still on the search for Diamond Dust information.  However, untill<br/>\nthen I will be attempting to sell aqualungs to anyone I can find that will<br/>\nbuy them.  Unfortunately whenever I make an auction I get about a half<br/>\ndozen interested persons asking about rebreathers.  Which I haven&#39;t<br/>\nattempted yet but seriously doubt that I can make.  Most of the people that<br/>\nget interested in the aqualung, are turned off when they hear that its the<br/>\ncharged version.  That or the fact that it WON&#39;T fit in a back pack.  But,<br/>\nIt will fit in a large tailoring kit.  I happen to be fortunate enough to<br/>\nhave a box of abu-kar, and it fits in there with its weight totally<br/>\neliminated.  I haven&#39;t checked an evil eye bag, or any of the other weight<br/>\nreduction containers except my archeologist pack.  It won&#39;t fit in the<br/>\narcheologist pack.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I have sold 1 aqualung and I have 2 others that are interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
