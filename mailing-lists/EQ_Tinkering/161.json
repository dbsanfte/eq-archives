Really, where did they find these programmers?<br/>\n<br/>\nOnto the items:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Flameless lanterns:  Ok, yet I haven&#39;t sold any.<br/>\n2)  Compasses:  Make components cheaper to buy, namely the static <br/>\norb.  However, I have sold 8 so far for 5pp each, about 16pp profit (over a <br/>\ntwo week period).  So I won&#39;t be too upset if they leave it alone.<br/>\n3)  Stalking Probes:  Make them explode for LOTS (few hundred points or so, <br/>\nAE) of damage when hit by attackers.  Then it&#39;ll be more than a VERY <br/>\nexpensive Eye of Zomm clone.  This would make it useful and desirable to <br/>\nhandle big mobs.  And make them last a bit longer than 30 seconds, and make <br/>\nthem reusable if not destroyed.<br/>\n4)  Cams:  Besides getting them to work (really, if its hard to do then <br/>\nthey&#39;ve botched the whole EQ system design from the start, anyone ever hear <br/>\nof Object Oriented Programming?), make them premium cams providing better <br/>\nrange than any other cams available.<br/>\n5)  Thermal Cloak:  Why must one use a TATTERED cloak!  This is ridiculous <br/>\nand another sign of poor programming.  Make it so that a small cloth cape <br/>\nworks too, geez.  OR!  make a cloak pattern for tailors!  Wow!  What a <br/>\nnovel idea!<br/>\n6)  Mechanical Lockpicks:  Haven&#39;t made any, but will as I am a <br/>\nrogue.  Hope at least that they work.<br/>\n7)  The remaining items:  I have no idea how to make them because I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave the books (and I am not sure they exist) so I have no ideas on their <br/>\nimprovement.<br/>\n<br/>\nUggg!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
