What is this? Anyone?<br/>\n    In The Oasis of Marr I saw the gypsies were selling &quot;A ball of clay&quot;. Is<br/>\nthis for pottery? (It could be that my memory betrays me, and that those<br/>\n    clayballs were sold in &quot;The Emporium&quot; in FP, not sure).<br/>\n    Anyway, if you have the answer, or facts on any of these subjects, please<br/>\nreply here.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Piip, gnome rogue and master potterer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
