A few people do actually collect items in <br/>\nEverquest. I&#39;ve been in Everfrost lately trying to raise my faction so I can <br/>\nget a quest to get a Langseax or two, and actually have a decent 1 hand <br/>\nslashing weapon, well any way, I sold a Seax, which is a nice little low <br/>\nlevel peircing weapon to someone who couldn&#39;t even use it (because it was <br/>\nrogue and warrior only) for 5pp just because the person likes collecting <br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I never said the fishing pole was a rare drop.  The spyglass is most <br/>\n&gt;definitely<br/>\n&gt;a rare drop.  Things are only worth as much as they are useful.  People <br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;collect things in everquest.  They buy things to use.  I don&#39;t know how <br/>\n&gt;good<br/>\n&gt;the spyglass is, but if it isn&#39;t that good then it would not be worth that<br/>\n&gt;much.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Philip Terry wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Philip Terry&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pjt006@...\">pjt006@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hey again,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If the fishing pole were a very rare item in the game (1 out of 400 <br/>\n&gt;drops),<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then that would make it worth more money.  But if Salvador was including<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them in his spyglasses cheaply, then he had to making them (or being <br/>\n&gt;given<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them by some unknown source).  I believe that the fishing pole is a real<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tinkerable item for this reason and that Salavador (if he can be <br/>\n&gt;trusted)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; told us the cork isn&#39;t in the formula (thus, he knows it).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--Eron<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aeron@...\">aeron@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
