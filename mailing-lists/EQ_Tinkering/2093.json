That rumour ran on this list for a long LONG time, but it was <br/>\nstarted by someone who had never seen it. He had only been told by someone <br/>\nthat claimed 200 skill a long time ago. That 200 skill person was pretty <br/>\nflamed on this list for lying and holding back information although he <br/>\nhimself was never here and me for one, and I&#39;ve been tinkering since I <br/>\nstarted my char over a year ago although my skill is still pretty low, have <br/>\nnever heard of it from anywhere but that obscure source on this list quite a <br/>\nlong time ago..<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as someone mentioned earlier, NO chars were moved over from beta, we all <br/>\nhad to start fresh (Sadly, I had a p3 account, hehe)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Sandortien, newbie lvl 50 wizard of Xegony<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
