Oh, and btw, on raising <br/>\nyour skill to 53 Tuni...I earned about two_hundred_plat in greater faydark <br/>\nselling fireworks for 2pp each. Then I found some guy who bought 80 for half <br/>\nprice and shot all of them off in front of the kelethin bank (lol don&#39;t ask <br/>\nme he did it). Talk about good advertisement! I then sold some for 1 and 2pp. <br/>\nI didn&#39;t auction until afterwards when the zone was less populated. I did it <br/>\nby people&#39;s equipment...LOL, oracle robe 2 plat, SMR 5 plat, patchwork 8gp, <br/>\netc. Then after that I went and sold some more and eventually twinked a <br/>\nhalfling warrior in full bronze and then traded a PBB for a shield of the <br/>\nslain unicorn...oops...I&#39;m getting off subject. Anyway in the end I went and <br/>\nbought enough for a lot of flameless lanterns (and I mean a lot!) then made <br/>\nand sold them at a gnome vendor (with good faction) for a plat each. I didn&#39;t <br/>\nget through all my lanterns, unfortunately, but I did get to about 58 skill <br/>\nin an hour. The other items are nice, but a bit pricey to raise skill--some <br/>\nsuper high level tried to get me to make a telescope. He supplied the <br/>\nwholesale money and I failed 8 times before I made it. I can understand why <br/>\nyou spent so much raising it!<br/>\n-Yiltu, gnomage, 20th level of Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
