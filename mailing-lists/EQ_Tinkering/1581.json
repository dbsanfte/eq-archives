Go to Manik and say &quot;I am a new warrior.&quot;  He will then give you a<br/>\nshiny card to give to the clockworks with a C in there name one at a time.<br/>\n One is located near the throne room, one is on the island in the lake<br/>\nnear the cleric/thieves guild, one is by the tunnel leading into the area<br/>\nwith water wheel and one is by the entrance to the Mines of Malfunction<br/>\n(this one will alternate with an &quot;A&quot; clockwork).  Give all four of the<br/>\nblackboxes you receive to Manik for faction/minor item.  He will then give<br/>\nyou a blackbox that you have to give to Jogl - the gnome by the windmills<br/>\nwith the pet clockwork Charlotte.  Jogl will give you one of two &quot;writen<br/>\norders&quot; that you give to the merchant in the warrior guild.  The merchant<br/>\nwill either give you to Red V quest or the Duster quest.  If he gives you<br/>\nthe Duster quest, then the Duster X will spawn by the broken wheelbarrow<br/>\nnear the second tinker merchant in the room with the cleric guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nQdP<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Daniel Stock &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:argovian@...\">argovian@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now I feel stupid roaming 4 hours waiting for Duster X to spawn. *sighs*<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; How do I get this Duster Report to make him spawn? I already got Duster<br/>\n&gt; V.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thx<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Countt<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can confrim this as I completed the duster quest last night and got<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; Bootstrutters Pack (Isn&#39;t the Gnome who gives you the Jboots quest named<br/>\n&gt; Bootstrutter?  Heh - anyone try giving him his pack back?  Just an<br/>\n&gt; idea).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; These junk items that you talk about - I&#39;ve never seen them before.<br/>\n&gt; Gnomish Glow Rods?  Perhaps these are the rods needed for the thermal<br/>\n&gt; cloak...  I just received a patchwork cloak after completing the Red V<br/>\n&gt; quest - I&#39;ll try to do the Duster and scrap metal quests a few more<br/>\n&gt; times<br/>\n&gt; to get these Rods and try a few combinations.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; QdP<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Quasinom de Plume is my quasi nom-de-plume&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Duster V is still a rare spawn around the enterence.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Duster X now only spawns once you turn in the report, he spawns down<br/>\n&gt; by<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; tinkering merchant, and doesnt wander anymore, he just stands in<br/>\n&gt; place.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I did this quest once (and am waiting for Duster V to do it again)<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; got the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Bootstrutters Pack, 10slot backpack with 10% weight reduction..<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; A lot of the junk that you used to get for this quest (back when<br/>\n&gt; Dustre<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; X was a<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; wandering rare spawn) can now also be gotten by turning in scrap<br/>\n&gt; metal<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; from<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; rogues to Sanfryd Feathertop (who used to be called Sanfryd<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; somethingelse).<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Amongst the normal lanterns/shield junk you can also get gnomish glow<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; rods, and<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; chunks of metal ore that look like balls instead of bricks...<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Getting the duster report seems to be less common than it used to be<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; well - I<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; get the Red V report a lot more now, previously it was the other way<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; around..<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Thousands of Stores.
