That is the best news I&#39;ve heard in awhile on this mailing list, but I <br/>\n&gt;think that Verant has been forggeting something.<br/>\n&gt;They are about to patch the test server for the third! time in a row.<br/>\n&gt;Alas they have not even patched the real game with the &quot;warrior patch&quot;<br/>\n&gt;as it&#39;s called, which is the patch with the warrior improvements that they <br/>\n&gt;patched onto the test server when they implemented the RW server codes into <br/>\n&gt;the Test server. It just seems fishy that they only care about patching the <br/>\n&gt;test server now, doesn&#39;t it to you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sniffledoo Copperheart. 14th rank warrior of the Gemchopper Hall -- Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
