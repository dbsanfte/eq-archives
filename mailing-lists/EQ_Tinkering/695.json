There is nothing in that deep<br/>\nhole, it just dead-ends.  I haven&#39;t tried bumping around to see if the walls<br/>\nare secret however.  To get my skill maxed I have swam ALL around the Ak&#39;anon<br/>\nunderground sea, specifically looking for tunnels or any hidden routes.  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t find anything special.  I am however in Ak&#39;anon as we speak and will<br/>\nlook around when I get home, if the wife permits. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kryogen Katspaw<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Chuck Krauth &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chuck.krauth@...\">chuck.krauth@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The coins are for something else, but the water clue at least makes me think<br/>\n&gt; of something.

Later, once my swimming was at a reasonable level, I did make<br/>\n&gt; it down and tried swimming into the walls in all directions.  I was really<br/>\n&gt; looking for a passage or something like that.  If anything was lying on the<br/>\n&gt; ground and didn&#39;t stand out, I could easily have missed it.
