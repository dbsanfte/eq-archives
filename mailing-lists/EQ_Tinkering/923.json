I am just <br/>\ngoing from what little I now.<br/>\n<br/>\n    While I was riding on the boat to fp i decided to bring some reading <br/>\nalong. (EX: tinkering books). While reading it over I was thinking if any of <br/>\nthese things could be hints on how to make some other stuff or find the <br/>\nmissing book. Well here are some suggestions to check into. Talk to King <br/>\nAkannon about it. In the book it mentions at the begging he is writing it for <br/>\nhim or something along those lines. His wife might be in the game (not sure). <br/>\nHe mentions her in the books as compassvess or something close to that. He <br/>\nnamed the compass after her. Maybe she has something about it. Talk to the <br/>\nzookeeper cause he was the one that practically sent them to the mino caves <br/>\nto get a minotaur for the zoo. Try killing the minotaur in the zoo. He might <br/>\nsomehow have the book. Thats all I could think of about this. If anyone else <br/>\nhas some ideas send them in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I was thinking of some gnomish firework recipes. Maybe we have to add a <br/>\nstalking probe and a flask of water and maybe some other item to make the <br/>\nfireworks. It mentions in one of the books that he was worried about the <br/>\nscouts exploding when the were doing something and he mentions a something <br/>\nabout a flask of water with it. Maybe add a metal rod or that cheaper rod <br/>\nthing for the stalking probe to shoot out of when it comes in contact with <br/>\nthe water. shoots in the air and explodes. I dunno don&#39;t take these litteraly <br/>\nand rely on them alot. There just some guesses i thought of.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
