They&#39;re a fairly hard item to push.  Fireworks<br/>\nI personally give away to gain a client base... people generally remember<br/>\nthem and will ask you what other toys you have, and this is where I show<br/>\nthem the stalking probe.  Since you&#39;re a gnome you start out such that many<br/>\nitems are already trivial (fishpole, fireworks, ect), and stalking probes<br/>\ncan recompense &lt;some&gt; of your money, but dont expect to sell many.  They&#39;re<br/>\ntoys for rich people, which in essence is what all tinkered items are.  Its<br/>\ntoo bad that we cant get any items that everyone WANTS to have, like<br/>\nvirtually every other trade (platinum ruby vail, vodka, trushot longbow,<br/>\nhandmade backpack, ect).... the rebreather hardly qualifies. A good fellow<br/>\ngnome named Yugi I often see selling telescopes for 100 plat per pop... he<br/>\ntells me this is working fine for him, and anyone that says &#39;thats too much&#39;<br/>\nhe tells them simply that it is a toy for those who can afford it, and those<br/>\nthat cannot can do without.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I&quot;m to generous with my tinkered items... I find them so<br/>\nwonderful I have to give them to all my friends!<br/>\n<br/>\nCogg - Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: James Adams &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jwa@...\">jwa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 01, 2000 5:13 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Tinkering] Starting out<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;James Adams&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jwa@...\">jwa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First off I want to say how great it is that there ARE other gnomes out<br/>\n&gt; there who take such an avid interest in one of the few things that set us<br/>\n&gt; apart in Gnorrath.  Having followed your adventures and attempts at<br/>\n&gt; discovering the lost knowledge of tinkering has kept me going...and now I<br/>\nam<br/>\n&gt; ready to start working as well.<br/>\n&gt; A few questions though....<br/>\n&gt; I already know what to make as I progress, but I&#39;m curious...how do you<br/>\nsell<br/>\n&gt; the items you make (ie fireworks, cams, etc?)  I really doubt anyone would<br/>\n&gt; buy a flameless lantern, and I don&#39;t blame them, but what about other<br/>\nitems?<br/>\n&gt; I have successfully made some cams and can&#39;t seem to sell them.  Nor<br/>\n&gt; fireworks, which I have heard are a hit...which makes me feel useless<br/>\nsince<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t get rid of them.<br/>\n&gt; Any advice would be appreciated, and since I don&#39;t know of any other<br/>\ngnomes<br/>\n&gt; tinkering on my world this was the only place I knew to ask.  Of course,<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; there is another one out there that&#39;d be great...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Phizn Frugin<br/>\n&gt; MithMarr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FREE ADVICE FROM REAL PEOPLE!
