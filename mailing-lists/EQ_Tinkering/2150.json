This may give us<br/>\na clue to the gemcutter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I know, the only way to use items is to either put them in a<br/>\ncontainer and hit combine, to equip them, or to right-click on the item<br/>\nwhile it&#39;s in a main inventory slot (like a drink or potion).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing that works by right-clicking one item over another is rogue<br/>\npoisoning, but I don&#39;t think you can really use the word &#39;works&#39; in<br/>\nconnection with that.  But this does tell us that that particular game<br/>\nmechanic exists.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave I missed anything?<br/>\n<br/>\nPutting it in a container may work, but we don&#39;t know which container to<br/>\nuse, much less the items to use with it, and since diamond dust isn&#39;t<br/>\nexactly easy to get, people are understandably reluctant to experiment along<br/>\nthis line.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan the gemcutter be equipped?  Since it doesn&#39;t have class and race<br/>\ndesignations on it, I don&#39;t think so, but this would be easy to test.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also try right-clicking on it in a main inventory slot while not<br/>\nholding anything.  Simple, non-destructive, easy to test.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat leaves right-clicking stuff on it, or right clicking it on stuff.  <br/>\nWe just have to find out what kind of stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I had one to play with myself...<br/>\n<br/>\nPasketti, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
