Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has tried the tinkering<br/>\nskill since the patch to see if the skill cap (I think it was (Level - 15) x<br/>\n5) has been fixed yet.  I had been hoping that they would fix it in this<br/>\npatch after someone reported that a GM said they should be fixing it soon,<br/>\nmaybe even in the next patch.  If anyone knows if you can Tinker outside the<br/>\nlevel cap now please say so =)<br/>\n<br/>\nLogalog,<br/>\nVeeshan Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
