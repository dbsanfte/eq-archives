It is <br/>\nquite possible that the spyglass is a rare drop item, or loads on some <br/>\nunknown mob.  I have not seen a shred of proof that anyone has ever tinkered <br/>\na collapsible fishing pole.  Try to get this Salvador guy or whatever his <br/>\nname is to sell you a fishing pole.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, this is irrelevent too, because the fishing pole could be <br/>\nloading on some unknown mob as well, or be part of a quest, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kind of numbers are we talking about with this guy selling spyglasses?  <br/>\nDoes he actually sell them?  I doubt he tells anyone how many he has, and it <br/>\nis possible he only has one that he keeps trying to sell.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
