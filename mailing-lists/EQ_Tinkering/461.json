I was told by a GM that tinkering is one of the hardest<br/>\nskills to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; train, so perhaps I am either unlucky, or the skill is nearly impossible<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; train up now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Assumption&gt; tinkering is broken. It doesn&#39;t matter what a GM tells you.<br/>\nThey<br/>\n&gt; lie all the time.  I have even asked them on things I have known to be<br/>\ntrue just<br/>\n&gt; to see if they would lie.  If any of you are Necromacers you know about<br/>\nthe DoT<br/>\n&gt; bug, where the corpse vanishes when the monster dies, and no one gets EXP.<br/>\nWell<br/>\n&gt; I was assured numerous time by Bargash (A real GM on Karana and not even a<br/>\n&gt; guide) that this was supposed to be part of the game.  Of course, a few<br/>\npatches<br/>\n&gt; latter Verant put in a &quot;fix&quot; for this &quot;part of the game&quot; which has helped<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; the problem still exists.  This is my only instance of an actual GM lying<br/>\nto me,<br/>\n&gt; but there are many other instances where guides will give answers to<br/>\nquestions<br/>\n&gt; they know nothing about.  So I would just disreguard the answer.  Because<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; tinker could go up, then someone on this list would have had his/her skill<br/>\ngo up<br/>\n&gt; by now.  So if you have had your tinkering skill go up, please say<br/>\nsomething so<br/>\n&gt; we know it is possible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thought #2:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If the collapsible fishing pole was in a shop, it would have been found<br/>\nlong<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ago.  Of course, if it was only added in recently, then it may have yet<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be found.  In any case, it still doesn&#39;t solve the problem of not having<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; recipe to make them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Assumption&gt; Really only gnomes would be looking for this item. If it was<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; grobb or oggok (don&#39;t ask me why, but they put some necromacers spells<br/>\nthere)<br/>\n&gt; then it is very unlikely that we would have found it.  If it was in neriak<br/>\nthen<br/>\n&gt; really only Necromacers could have found it.  This would mean that our<br/>\n&gt; enchanters would have to check these cities.  There are also vendors all<br/>\nover.<br/>\n&gt; A gnome, on this list, would have to hit one of these vendors and then<br/>\nscroll<br/>\n&gt; down enough to see the pole if it was there.  It definitely could be out<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thought #3:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The collapsible fishing pole recipe should be fairly cheap to make.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really doubt that Verant made it difficult, considering it is a<br/>\ncomponent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for another item.  So, this should limit the parts to those costing 1 pp<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; less, with the total cost not exceeding 5 pp.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;assumption&gt; Tinkering is broken, and the pole cannot be made at this<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n&gt; This is probably due to some poor coding or oversite (such as the DoT bug,<br/>\nwhich<br/>\n&gt; effects every class with DoT or the Barbarian Shield).  Verant has put out<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; good game, but made some large errors in coding that apparently cannot be<br/>\nfixed<br/>\n&gt; until large areas of code can be patched (my guess would be this would not<br/>\noccur<br/>\n&gt; until the expansion).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thought #4:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Whoever assumed that the spyglasses were being sold for 50% over cost is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; assuming way too much.  If you are the only producer of an item, you can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; demand a much higher profit return on that item.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Fact&gt; Spyglass are found as a rare drop off of some monsters.  They are a<br/>\nvery<br/>\n&gt; rare drop (like the box of abu-kar for which I kill about 300-400 monsters<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; the appropriate type before one drops).  I have seen them for auction, and<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; have seen people auctioning for them.  Every single person has given me<br/>\nthe same<br/>\n&gt; response to my inquiries, that they are looted.  If the person who was<br/>\nselling<br/>\n&gt; it led you to believe he tinkered the item, he was most likely lying, and<br/>\nhoping<br/>\n&gt; to get more to sell and keep the price up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thought #5:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There is no such thing as a &quot;secret&quot; on Everquest.  There are too many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people playing the game, making any new discovery part of the common<br/>\n&gt; &gt; knowledge base within a few weeks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Fact&gt; This is pretty true for the most part, but the glowing stein was a<br/>\npart<br/>\n&gt; of the game from beta on, and it wasn&#39;t until 2 or 3 weeks ago that this<br/>\nbecame<br/>\n&gt; common knowledge.  Verant also reports that less than 50% of the total<br/>\ndifferent<br/>\n&gt; items in the game have been found.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thought #6:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Seeing &quot;broken&quot; quests, items, and spells in the past, I wouldn&#39;t put it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; past Verant that the collapsible fishing pole recipe isn&#39;t really in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; game.  I am merely speculating, but I find it rather hard to believe<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; after months of uptime, not one gnome has found the recipe to such a<br/>\ntrivial<br/>\n&gt; &gt; item as the collapsible fishing pole.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;assumption&gt; I totally agree as stated above.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --Eron (Vaevictis, Karana)<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aeron@...\">aeron@...</a><br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; from The Simpsons:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Moe: Why can&#39;t I find Amanda Hugginkiss?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
