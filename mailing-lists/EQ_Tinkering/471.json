You usually find out this information from other NPC.  But it is<br/>\n&gt; quite common.  So it is possible there may be some question you have to ask<br/>\n&gt; Jogl like &quot;what is a collapsable fishing pole?&quot; or some such thing and they he<br/>\n&gt; will ask you to bring him a few items (like the jum jum quest) and then he will<br/>\n&gt; give you the pole.  If someone is truely making the poles, then I think this is<br/>\n&gt; how it is being done.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm, or maybe it is like the trueshot bow quest and it is possible to<br/>\nmkae the actual item...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for faction mattering.  I know of very few quests that need a faction better<br/>\n&gt; then dubious (which NPC will usually not talk to you if you are dubious, so<br/>\n&gt; this suprised me.  But since I am dubious with almost all of Norrath,<br/>\n&gt; indifferent to some, and my pet considers me kindly (I didn&#39;t know other NPC<br/>\n&gt; could do so also).  It is pretty unlikely that your faction has to be that<br/>\n&gt; high.  Especially for a quest that involves multiple classes.  For the vast<br/>\n&gt; majority the quests that involve faction being high are quests designed for a<br/>\n&gt; single class to complete.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tony Buser wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Tony Buser&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gr0k@...\">gr0k@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jogle doesn&#39;t say anything different to me.
