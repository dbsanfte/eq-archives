Just about everyone is looking for a lead on one or more of the new<br/>\nFA Type quests.  While looking around the Safehouse (rogue message board) I<br/>\nfound a post where someone found some interesting information.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe NPC who mentions the following information can be found on the top<br/>\nfloor of the Vasty Deep Inn in Erudin.<br/>\n----------<br/>\n-Stofo Olan says &#39;Good day, I have discovered something truly wonderful! If<br/>\nI only had the materials required so I can copy my notes and send them to<br/>\nmy teacher. <br/>\n-You say, &#39;who is your teacher?&#39;<br/>\n-Stofo Olan says &#39;My teacher is Jeb Lumsed. He was last seen in the regions<br/>\nof the newly discovered lands. If you wish to find him that is where you<br/>\nmust seek him out. <br/>\n-Jaxel says, &#39;what materials?&#39;<br/>\n-Stofo Olan says &#39;The materials I need are a mechanical pen, ink of the<br/>\ndark, and white paper. Bring me those and I will give you a copy of this<br/>\ninformation. <br/>\n-Jaxel says, &#39;where mechanical pen?&#39;<br/>\n-Stofo Olan says &#39;The answer you seek is in your question. If you are<br/>\nunable to figure it out, then perhaps you are not ready to travel along<br/>\nthis path. <br/>\n-Jaxel says, &#39;what is ink of the dark?&#39;<br/>\n-Stofo Olan says &#39;Dark illusions, thievery, and the plague of the living<br/>\nwill guide you. These are the only hints I can provide. Safe travels and<br/>\nmay you be protected from all maladies. <br/>\n-Jaxel says, &#39;what is white paper?&#39;<br/>\n-Stofo Olan says &#39;It may seem like ordinary paper at first. However, this<br/>\npaper was enchanted by a friend of mine. This paper was given to a lass in<br/>\nthe Karanas to help with her writings. The paper will guide her hands and<br/>\ndraw forth the thoughts in her mind. I no longer have any and I have not<br/>\nhad contact with my friend in some time. Search them out. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this excerpt from the log file that I cut and pasted here you will<br/>\nnotice the mention of a mechanical pen.  Its totally unconfirmed but this<br/>\nis a possible lead in to a new tinkering item that may become creatable<br/>\nsoon or is now creatable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn another post, one most assuredly designed for the warrior quest an NPC<br/>\nwas found in OOT, on the Aviak Island, that requires the following item to<br/>\ncomplet his portion of the quest.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Denken Strongpick says &#39;I would be willing to part with this very fine<br/>\nblade for; a keg of Vox tail ale, a block of permafrost to keep it cool and<br/>\ntwo new rebreathers to get this operation back underway.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile this may not be the use for rebreathers that we all wanted, it does<br/>\nmake them a bit more needed than the FB earing, atleast for something.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Elder of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
