There are enough folks on my server that are 40+ that consider 60 plat chump change. My rule of thumb is I charge twice the component cost (or however much I can get for them...heh)<br/>\n<br/>\nI got my first point since Cams became trivial at 75... I&#39;m at 76 now. Its haaaard gaining points tho. I have made 10 spyglasses without a point gain, but if I can make a bit of profit at it, I can support the habit without going broke.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make a profit, ya gotta have some stuff that gets your charisma up.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;FizzWizz of Tunare&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
