(monks and/or us frail gnomes will hate that)<br/>\n<br/>\nIts components cost around 225pp. Since its trivial for basically no one,<br/>\nyou have to count on a 3x multiplier for a sale price to survive. That 675pp<br/>\nselling price (typically failure rates of non-trivials I&#39;ve seen to run about <br/>\n2.5x cost). In other words, you succeed once every 2.5 times (total estimate,<br/>\njust what I&#39;ve seen).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has 50 charges - thats 13.5 plat per use, if you can sell it for 2x the<br/>\ncost then its 9 plat per use.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it have to be worn? (doubt it just asking).<br/>\n<br/>\nMagicians might be able to summon a stone that provides 2 charges of<br/>\nEnduring breath.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverytime I auction tinkered items, I get tons of tells asking about these<br/>\nthings. What can I say? <br/>\n<br/>\nRebreathers make me shudder. Whats the going price on the fishbone earring?<br/>\nThe estimate on rebreather is what? 750pp for components alone? That makes<br/>\na minimum selling price of 1500pp? and thats IF they&#39;re every trivial? (they<br/>\nchanged jewelry so platinum is never trivial.. I wouldnt be surprised to see<br/>\nthat here).<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I dont mean to be a downer. I&#39;m really into Tinkering but I was sorta<br/>\ndevoting (lots) of time and (lots) of money into raising my skill mostly to<br/>\nmake these things. I&#39;m a bit discouraged.  Please all you tinkering masters!<br/>\nWhat do YOU think?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
