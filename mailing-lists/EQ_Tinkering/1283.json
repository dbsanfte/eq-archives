What happens when you fail the<br/>\nRebreather?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt a 10% Failure rate on the Rebreather add 11% to the above prices for the<br/>\nRebreather<br/>\nAt a 20% Failure rate on the Rebreather add 25% to the above prices for the<br/>\nRebreather<br/>\nAt a 30% Failure rate on the Rebreather add 43% to the above prices for the<br/>\nRebreather<br/>\nAt a 40% Failure rate on the Rebreather add 67% to the above prices for the<br/>\nRebreather<br/>\nAt a 50% Failure rate on the Rebreather add 100% to the above prices for the<br/>\nRebreather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo taking an extreme example, at a 50% failure rate on the Aqualung and a<br/>\n50% failure rate on the Rebreather, we are talking a cost of 2202pp per<br/>\nRebreather (that is Cost to make it, not what it would actually sell for).<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething to think about<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if my prices above on the parts are wrong, please tell me where you are<br/>\ngetting them, since that is the price I get with a 110 charisma at the<br/>\nWindmills.<br/>\n<br/>\nVapn Maistre, Master Tinkerer (well almost, stuck at 100 and out of cash)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
