Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has tried the<br/>\n&gt; tinkering<br/>\n&gt; skill since the patch to see if the skill cap (I think it was (Level -<br/>\n&gt; 15) x<br/>\n&gt; 5) has been fixed yet.  I had been hoping that they would fix it in this<br/>\n&gt; patch after someone reported that a GM said they should be fixing it<br/>\n&gt; soon,<br/>\n&gt; maybe even in the next patch.
