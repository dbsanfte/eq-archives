I dont think he was making it up casue he<br/>\n&gt; confronted me about tinkering and asked if i new how to make one.  Also ive<br/>\n&gt; been to a few web sittes that kinda talk about it.  Its mentioned that there<br/>\n&gt; is a third componet to combine to make this staff.  To bad they wouldnt say,<br/>\n&gt; also the priest discord has that black robe.   When i first started i thought<br/>\n&gt; it was just for show but the higher i get in levels i starting to see other<br/>\n&gt; people wear this robe.  You can get that robe in a dungeon.   I also tried to<br/>\n&gt; combine the skull and rune totum staff and it tells me that they dont<br/>\n&gt; combine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to &quot;PAFind,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; How is ONElist changing YOUR life?
