If you believe the clue at all I d say it is a waste of time to look in any bodies","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1013898562\">Yep, I think ocean when I think waves, and I think waves when I think ocean.<br/>\nIf you believe the clue at all I&#39;d say it is a waste of time to look in any<br/>\nbodies of water other OOT, Erud&#39;s crossing, and possibly Dagnor&#39;s and Lake<br/>\nRathe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as OOT, there is the hill giant Gronnit &lt;sp&gt; that stands in the water<br/>\nnear Pirate Isle, viewable from the boat. If you watch him a while he&#39;ll<br/>\nwalk up on shore and stand around very briefly before walking back. I always<br/>\nthought it&#39;d be neat if he were standing on something there in the water and<br/>\nyou could sneak over and steal it when he was away. Check it out if you are<br/>\nnear the island, and check again at another time because the item may not<br/>\nalways be spawned. Interesting idea at least &lt;grin&gt;. FYI there is an evil<br/>\nGnome Pirate there that is part of an Ak&#39;Anon enchanter quest, so the whole<br/>\nthing is not *totally* un-related to Gnomes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, FYI, there is indeed a high level, aggro NPC in the underwater cave in<br/>\nEverfrost (north side under the west river fork). The cave is very, very<br/>\ndark, and also quite large. There is a glowing room with the rod for the Ice<br/>\nComet quest in a little shack surrounded by ice bones. From there take a<br/>\nleft I think and hug the right wall and you&#39;ll see him, a guy named<br/>\nMc&lt;something&gt; standing next to a little goblin diver. I think he was a<br/>\nbarbarian or human, but did not get close at all. In any case he conned red<br/>\nat L29 and was aggro to my usually-lovable agnostic barbarian warrior. I<br/>\nhave heard rumor that he is L35. I have never heard of him being killed, so<br/>\ncannot say what he drops; not many people even seem to know he exists. I<br/>\ndoubt that he is related to tinkering, but would be a fun fight so go kill<br/>\nhim anyway &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lenn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
