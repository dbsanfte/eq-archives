The boots cost <br/>\ntoo much to make for an additional +5 sv cold.  They also take way too long <br/>\nto make since you have to make the fine steel boots.  At least the watchman <br/>\narmor is so difficult that you fail 99% of the time and get the fine steel <br/>\narmor back and can try again.  You succeed to much on the footwarming boots <br/>\nand have to spend hours making them again.
