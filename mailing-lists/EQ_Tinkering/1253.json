The level is capped at<br/>\n(level -15) * 5.  The reason you didn&#39;t gain a single point is because<br/>\nat Level 31, 80 skill is your max.  Wait until Level 32 and try again.<br/>\nYou should go up 5 pts and stop at 85.  Forget the /petition and /bugs<br/>\nabout Aqualung charges, THIS is the problem we should be complaining<br/>\nabout.  Tinkering should have the cap removed and made like every other<br/>\ntrade skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalbasil Psyrex of Ak&#39;Anon (Bertoxx)<br/>\nHouse of Silmindo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZinken wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;    Well i started the day with an skill of 80 and a lv of 31, i put<br/>\n&gt; down over 1100 pp in making stalking probes and spyglasses and my<br/>\n&gt; reward was NOT 1 single point gained :-((((  This cant be right.  I<br/>\n&gt; was told by GM Caphys on Veeshan that Tinkering is like any outher<br/>\n&gt; trade skill and i should be able to gain past 80 skill regardless of<br/>\n&gt; my level after i get the skill at lv 16.
