If a patch has something that you MUST<br/>\nhave in order to play, then they need to implement it when the servers are down.<br/>\nThis means server downtime or waiting until the scheduled downtime. Just giving<br/>\nit from a programmer&#39;s viewpoint :) I really have no idea why they haven&#39;t<br/>\npatched it all in yet, but this could be why...<br/>\n-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Trade Council GM<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua Bednarz wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Joshua Bednarz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thewhitemage@...\">thewhitemage@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That could be the case, but it&#39;s not becuase they are not making changes to<br/>\n&gt; the previous changes that they made becuade they didn&#39;t work. They are just<br/>\n&gt; adding new patches with new changes completely different from the last<br/>\n&gt; patch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;They arn&#39;t patching the test server because they &quot;care&quot; more about the test<br/>\n&gt; &gt;server... as the name &quot;Test&quot; implies, it is a sever used for testing knew<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and updated source code... Most everything that is altered and/or added<br/>\n&gt; &gt;passes through the test server first... So is understandable that there<br/>\n&gt; &gt;will be multiple patches on the test server. Once they get it right, they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dont need to patch more then once with the regular servers...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Wes Lobdell,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Quote: &quot;The certain proof that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;universe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is that no one has bothered to make contact with us.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com by starting a new list at ONElist.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Weekly drawing is held each Friday.
