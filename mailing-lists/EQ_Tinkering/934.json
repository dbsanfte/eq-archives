Are you one of Verant&#39;s game designers, planners,<br/>\nprogrammers, or developers?  Are you related to any of them and they have told<br/>\nyou this is a fact?  Or are you as ignorant as the rest of us and just going by<br/>\nwhat someone told you?<br/>\nThere are enough rumors and disinformation about the 3rd book, collapsible<br/>\nfishing pole, and fireworks going around that I wonder if anyone on any server<br/>\nreally has solid information.  Until I recieve some word by an Everquest<br/>\nprogrammer or developer I&#39;m keeping my mind open.<br/>\nDon&#39;t count any information you have been told by the guides or GM&#39;s as<br/>\nfactual.  None of them created this game.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua Bednarz wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Joshua Bednarz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thewhitemage@...\">thewhitemage@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What will it take to get it through to you guys? There is NO damn third<br/>\n&gt; book, ANY formulas for items that have been figured out how to be made, if<br/>\n&gt; any at all were figured out by trial and error. There is absolutely NO BOOK!<br/>\n&gt; NONE not -ANYWHERE- in the game! When there IS something will be said about<br/>\n&gt; it in the patch. Until then , just work on raising your tinkering skill,<br/>\n&gt; thats all I can say, doing anything else about tinkering, like trying to<br/>\n&gt; find a non-existant book, or trying to figure out a formula with next to<br/>\n&gt; nothing odds is just a TOTAL 100% waste of time!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
