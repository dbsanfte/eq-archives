I assume that if I could<br/>\nget 4 lenses I could join the Eldritch Collective like it sounds like<br/>\nwhen I got the quest at level 1. I don&#39;t know what the reward actually<br/>\nis. I was hoping for something neat since it is so hard to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am level 18, so yes, over 16. I&#39;ve blown 12pp in making flameless lanterns<br/>\nno one will buy and not a single skill increase. I just got 50 more plat<br/>\nfrom adventuring around Antonica. I&#39;ll probably save some for level 20<br/>\nspells and put the rest into more tinkering hoping it will go up<br/>\nsooner or later. Are flameless lanterns the best thing to make to<br/>\nget your skill up?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen something is too easy to make your skill go up, it normally says<br/>\nthat the item is trivial. Firewater does this for me, but not<br/>\nlanterns. I haven&#39;t made a compass yet because I need a smith to<br/>\nmake skewers and I need to find pie tins.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well. Eventually I will tinker! *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t- Chad</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
