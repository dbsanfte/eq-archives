But I have had a bit of success with gaining skill, and I thought other folks might like to know how it went with me. My skill is at 75 presently.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first recommendation is find you an enchanter and buy you a couple of bracers and a necklass that raises charisma (not that expensive for a 20th level). Also see if you can get one of the +15 charisma &#39;crude steins&#39; from the bouncer in feerot. Having a charisma of 86 instead of 60 makes a ton of difference cash wise while you are doing all this tinkering. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso realize that you can NOT gain more than 1 point in tinkering until you get to *21*. You are stuck at 51 until then and I forget what your max is per level.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote, your milage may vary, but the first thing one should try to tinker to gain skill is the flameless lanterns. I would usually do about 20 at a time and it would cost somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 30 plat to do (after selling the lanterns back) depending on your success rate and charisma. Sometimes I would gain nothing, sometimes 4 or 5 points, its very random. On average I would say I gained about a point per 20 lanterns which means I approximately spent about 20 to 30 plat per point up to 68 where lanterns get trivial.<br/>\n<br/>\nYES, you CAN make some cash selling the cams to bowers. While nothing to write home about you can make some fairly decent pocket change. I started making cams at 68 (when lanterns became trivial) and my success rate was not too bad. I could sell the cams for 25 plat to bowers, where they would usually spend about 40 plat. They are usually VERY happy to find a tinker that can make cams...<br/>\n<br/>\nGaining skill gets a bit more expensive here since each attempt cost maybe 12 to 15 plat. But as with the lanterns I figure I would gain about a point every 20 cams or so, which means you really need to find a place to sell your cams to support your tinkering habit. I was able to get my skill up to 75 making cams.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thats where my story ends, without the fishing pole/telescope to practice on tinkering has no future for me short of making a bit of pocket change on cams. Damn those verant bastards, I still get an unexeptable rate of failure on cams even though they are trivial. =|<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps, if there does exist a kind soul willing to share the fishing pole recipe I would be eternally grateful.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nFizzWizz of Tunare<br/>\n35 Wizard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
