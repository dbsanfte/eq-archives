Worthless in general,<br/>\nexcept for faction adjustments... I think it helps with the Eldritch<br/>\nCollective.  I got killed in a few seconds trying to take out Gearheart so<br/>\nI don&#39;t recommend it.  A friend of mine managed to kill him as Gearheart<br/>\nwas apparently wandering near the zone (someone attacked and managed to run<br/>\naway from the farie onslaught).  The quest is supposed to be for a<br/>\nlow-level character... Yeah, right.  Level 29 wizard dead in about 20<br/>\nseconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still hopeful that they will make some type of Tinkering quest given<br/>\nout by the Eldritch Collective when you get your faction high enough.. The<br/>\nCollective are &#39;The Tinkerers&#39; aren&#39;t they?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Lesser faydark.  Good luck, I believe they&#39;re over level 30 and they&#39;re all<br/>\n&gt;grouped together.  If memory serves they cast nasty spells too.  While<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;re there you can do the gearheart quest and tell us what it rewards.<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve never heard of anybody completing that quest. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
