The next major item I&#39;d like to make for myself is the<br/>\nFootwarming boots.  Apparently the trivial for footwarming is around the 168<br/>\nmark.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt what skill level will I have like a 25% chance of even accomplishing this<br/>\nitem?  Obviously I&#39;ll continue making Powered Gloves until the trivial mark<br/>\nat 122, and then trying aqualungs.  Aqualungs&#39;s trivial is 148, which takes<br/>\nme close to the ~168 trivial of Footwarming boots.  However, I&#39;d like to try<br/>\nthe boots earlier on if there&#39;s a chance for success.  However, I don&#39;t know<br/>\nthe formula for a chance of success being &quot;x&quot; number of skill points away<br/>\nfrom the trivial point of the item you&#39;re trying to tinker.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoooooo....  I&#39;m at 102 now.  What skill level can I being trying to make<br/>\nFootwarming boots with somewhere around a 25% chance of success?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have any idea?
