Worked\r<br/>\nevery time. Then I tried the only item that I could afford and tada, the first(in the game I think) Flameless Lantern (gave it away) then two\r<br/>\nfailures. But all in all I made 3. They seem to be\r<br/>\nat least as bright as Lightstone, possibly brighter, but being a Gnome, what do I need it for? :) But it&#39;s been done. Tinkering works. \r<br/>\nGoing to put in my order for Pie Tins and start\r<br/>\nmaking Compasses. And as soon as I find a tattered\r<br/>\ncloak, it&#39;s Thermal Cloak time. Man I need more money.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-Zikkin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
