Will it happen? no, but still it would be <br/>\nawesome.  Imagine at the character creation screen, you select a gnome, and <br/>\nthe option for a tinkerer as the class is selectable.  You pick that class, <br/>\nthen a name and religion.  You start out with a tinkerer&#39;s toolbox, 5 <br/>\nbreads, 5 waters, and a note to go see Tobon Starpyre (if you are a good <br/>\nreligion) or Meldrath the Mad (if you are an evil religion).  At level one, <br/>\nyou get small clockwork rat plans.  This gets &#39;learned&#39; (memorized) into <br/>\nyour notebook (spellbook).  You get the components of the rat (firewater, <br/>\nSprocket #6, Gizmo #4, 2 gears, bottle, and metal twine) and hit the <br/>\nclockwork pet create button (spell button).  If you fail (fizzle) you loose <br/>\nsome of the components, if not, you just created your level 1 pet.  Now, <br/>\nlevel 30 comes and you get the plans for a tinkered boom stick (metal <br/>\nshaft, 3 gears, and a Sprocket #5) that uses ammo (level 30) created from <br/>\n(firework, metal ball, and metal shaft).  Maybe level 35 could be a double <br/>\nbarreled boom stick.  Some devices would be class restrictive (like boom <br/>\nstick where only tinkerer could use) others not (like rebreather where all <br/>\ncould use)  This could be fun.  Will it happen.  No, not a chance.  Darn it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtinky Eveready<br/>\n50 Gnomish Rogue<br/>\nMarginal and Bankrupt Tinkerer (110)<br/>\nBristlebane Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
