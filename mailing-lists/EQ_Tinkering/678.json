I try to help, but you decline it. If what<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; want is for me to truly leave with my information, then that is what I<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; do. I will leave the choice up to you. I&#39;m trying to apologize by helping,<br/>\n&gt; but you seem to want to be stubborn, and keep insulting me, saying all I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; out here to do is brag, when in fact I&#39;m trying to do the opposite. What I<br/>\n&gt; have to do could easily be done by a level 1 shaman barbarian. I just want<br/>\n&gt; to check it out for myself first and return with a report, if you all hate<br/>\n&gt; me so much that you wouldn&#39;t even take direct information from me because<br/>\n&gt; you think I want to just brag about it, then I wil quietly leave you all<br/>\n&gt; with out another letter. But like I said, it&#39;s yur choice, you can accept<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; or decline it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The fact that your not willing to reveal what it is you have to do, so<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt;others on the list, some of whom are in the high level 40s can do this<br/>\nonly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;suggests that your simply back to troll some more.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So why don&#39;t you just kindly leave?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Oh wait, you want to troll a bunch of messages so then you can come back<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a couple days and say something like, &quot;Well, I found the important thing,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;but since you all were unkind to me I won&#39;t reveal it, but this time its<br/>\n&gt; &gt;your alls faults, not mine.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Gimme a break and just leave...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Rotgut<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
