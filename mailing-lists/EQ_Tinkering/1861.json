Mauldoon, on the other hand, has lied many times in the past about many things. I do not give him one single bit of credit because I know all too well many of the lies he has told, proven to be lies by investigation or impossibilities. I don&#39;t understand the mind of such a person who will seem to say anything at all to get what he wants, make people like him, or make people think he always has the upper hand. I have a few stories of such incidences but I don&#39;t think I need to tell them. Sorry this has nothing to do with tinkering but I&#39;m just sorta pissed that anyone even listens to Mauldoon. If you knew him under his lies you would agree. Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrillian Novaspire</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
