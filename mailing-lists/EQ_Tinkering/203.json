I haven&#39;t tried it yet on an oak or a <br/>\ndarkwood cause I am relatively poor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:30 PM 07/22/1999 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Catbik Tinkerton&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:catbik@...\">catbik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think you guys gotta realize that tinkering is just plain bugged and you <br/>\n&gt;have to wait till they fix it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Catbik<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
