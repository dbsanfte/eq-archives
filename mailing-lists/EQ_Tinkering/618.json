I have run<br/>\nall over it, and hailed almost every gnome I have found there.  The one<br/>\nvendor does have the bag of the tinkerers and I&#39;m wondering if we can tinker<br/>\nit somehow.  He also carries broken force modules, broken frost modules,<br/>\nfunctional frost modules, and a power module.  THIS intrigues me!  Could it<br/>\nbe that the force and power module might be needed to make the bag, or maybe<br/>\nthe collapsible fishing pole is powered?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
