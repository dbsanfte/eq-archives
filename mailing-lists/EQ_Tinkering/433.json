I have killed hundreds upon <br/>\n&gt;hundreds<br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Minotaurs, I have killed Meldrath many times, and I have also killed the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; minotaur guards. Yet my faction with King Akanon isn&#39;t warm.  It maybe<br/>\n&gt;because I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; am a necro and there is a certain cap to faction, I really don&#39;t know. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
