So far I&#39;m 4/8, so each aqualung is costing me about 500.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is that no one wants to buy them from me.  How much are people <br/>\nselling these for on other servers, and where? Even in Dagnor&#39;s I can&#39;t seem<br/>\nto get anyone to buy.  I think I&#39;m the only active tinker on the server, but <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t help if no one wants to buy my wares (.  Should I just be selling <br/>\nback to the vendor?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m I out of luck til I can make rebreathers?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all<br/>\n<br/>\nLlabak Tharr of COR<br/>\n26 Mage and Master Tinker<br/>\nTarrew Marr server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
