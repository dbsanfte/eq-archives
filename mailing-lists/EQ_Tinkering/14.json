That&#39;s like\r<br/>\nskewers for smiths. He also said it&#39;s in the\r<br/>\ngame. Ok, is it me or have I seen NOTHING \r<br/>\nthat tells me how to make Firewater? \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBut I can&#39;t test what I think it might be, so\r<br/>\nI&#39;m posting my idea out there and maybe someone\r<br/>\ncan try it and post the results, I&#39;m going to \r<br/>\na wedding, so I can&#39;t try it myself(yet).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy idea is combine a Flask of Water (Real not\r<br/>\nsummoned) with Firebeetle Eye. The eye seems to\r<br/>\nbe used in a lot of things, it&#39;s a light source\r<br/>\nand it&#39;s another spell, so try those two in \r<br/>\nthe tool box, maybe (hope of hopes) my 2am\r<br/>\nrevelation is right. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-Zikkin\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\np.s. Anyone make anything at all?\r<br/>\nI&#39;m going to try compasses (I found someone\r<br/>\nthat specializes in Pie Tins, who would have\r<br/>\nthought) and they are all that expensive, I&#39;m\r<br/>\npaying him 6gp/tin. Think I&#39;ll buy 10-20, and \r<br/>\nstart making compasses.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
