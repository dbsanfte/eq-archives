If so, Tinkering becomes more like<br/>\nfishing, begging, and research (in that it has a level cap) than like the other<br/>\n&quot;Trade&quot; skills - Tailoring, baking, pottery, etc.  This makes no sense and<br/>\n(again, if true) may be a bug.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAaron Bolch wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Aaron Bolch&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaronbolch@...\">aaronbolch@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Sean Dorsey&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sdorsey@...\">sdorsey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I made 8 Cams in a row with out anything.. not counting the two lockpicks<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and about 40 - 50 lanterns.

At level<br/>\n&gt; 27 I was only able to raise tinkering to 60.  The skill does not take dozens<br/>\n&gt; and dozens of attempts to raise.  If it doesn&#39;t go up after 20, it isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; going up til you level.  So far, it seems that you can only learn one point<br/>\n&gt; per level til 28, then 5 points per level after that.  I am level 30 now,<br/>\n&gt; and I will try to get past 75 to see if one can gain more than 5 points per<br/>\n&gt; level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Phenglei -- Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
