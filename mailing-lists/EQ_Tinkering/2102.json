Haven&#39;t seen a post in quite a while.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I&#39;d pass on a quote from Gordon.  I can see his point, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t quite agree with it.  Tho I&#39;m no where near the tinkering level to<br/>\nmake them, I can invision a situation like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nA poor Gnome who&#39;s spent months and several thousand plat, worked hard and <br/>\nspent an insane amount of time and effort to master tinkering walks into<br/>\nthe zone outside Kedge and shouts &quot;Rebreather for sale 2k pp&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAny mage walks in the zone outside Kedge and shouts &quot;a bunch of<br/>\nbreathing stones for sale 20pp&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many tells do you think the gnome will get?  :(<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: This latest patch just made the mages 1-charge water breathing stones<br/>\nnon-lore. I already had a heck of a time selling my aqualungs/rebreathers.<br/>\nNow any 50 lev can walk into unrest and offer 20pp for a backpack full of<br/>\nstones to any 20th level mage.<br/>\n<br/>\nA: This really shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Sure, they might be non-lore, but<br/>\nthey are summoned so they will disappear on log out or on a lost <br/>\nconnection. Something that does unlimited enduring breath is superior to<br/>\nthe stones. -Gordon<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\ngr0k - Stranger in a Strange Land - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juju.org\">http://www.juju.org</a><br/>\nUbershadow Leprechaun - Level 35 Gnome Rogue - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tunares.juju.org\">http://tunares.juju.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
