Watch out for <br/>\nher and other gnomes. Actually, I don&#39;t think you have to kill anyone like <br/>\nthat to get information, but if you want to, go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Someone mentioned that a gm said there was tinkering info in the windmills.<br/>\n&gt;Well I search it throughly.  I thought maybe there was something to the <br/>\n&gt;fact<br/>\n&gt;that you can stop the wheels inside from spinning by clicking on them.  <br/>\n&gt;Also<br/>\n&gt;I discovered you can stop the windmill&#39;s blades from spinning by getting<br/>\n&gt;under them and clicking on them.  When you click on the wheels inside they<br/>\n&gt;stop for a while then start spinning again, but when you click on the <br/>\n&gt;blades<br/>\n&gt;and make them stop, they stay stopped.  And the blades and the wheels spin<br/>\n&gt;independently.  I haven&#39;t been able to figure out the purpose for making<br/>\n&gt;them stop.  I also got someone cast levitate on me and I was able to <br/>\n&gt;explore<br/>\n&gt;the outsides of the windmill towers.  I even managed to get to the top of<br/>\n&gt;the windmills by climbing around on the blades.  I didn&#39;t find anything.<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d really like to know what the purpose is of being able to control the<br/>\n&gt;windmills like that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Only thing I can think of is either the gm meant the tinkering books at the<br/>\n&gt;merchant or there&#39;s something to do with the npcs there.  I&#39;m level 22 and<br/>\n&gt;Jogle cons blue to me.  And he does walk out into the field alone from time<br/>\n&gt;to time.  I&#39;d hate to do it, but it might be possible to kill him when he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;out there.  Anyone know what he drops if anything?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;---<br/>\n&gt;gr0k - Stranger in a Strange Land - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juju.org\">http://www.juju.org</a><br/>\n&gt;&quot;Linux... find out what you&#39;ve been missing while<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;ve been rebooting Windows NT&quot; - Infoworld<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
