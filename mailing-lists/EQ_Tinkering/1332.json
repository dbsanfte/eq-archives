Greed has nothing to do with <br/>\nrunning a business. The point of trading skill is for max profit. 100pp for <br/>\nspyglass is the going rate, I sold many and none of them are idiots. As for <br/>\nthe Aqua Lung I sold about 9 so far at 650pp each, although 1000pp is a bit <br/>\nat the higher end if anyone can sell them then more power to him/her. And it <br/>\nis not fooling the masses, do you have any idea how much it cost to raise the <br/>\nskill to master? and even then the success rate is only 50% at best. Next <br/>\ntime try to know what you are talking about before opening that little hole <br/>\nof yours. Lastly I am proud to be a gnome, and it&#39;s people like you who is <br/>\nruining us gnomes. <br/>\n<br/>\nGagaliya Ba&#39;La&#39;Boom<br/>\nMaster Tinker<br/>\nLev 40 wiz<br/>\nThe Claw of Nagafan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;thank ye kindly for insulting my intelligence.  paying 1k for a <br/>\nLung....congratulations on fooling the masses.  personnaly i think it is <br/>\ntaking advantage of ppl.  the return i get far outweighs my expenses, and i <br/>\nam selling them faster than i can make em.  as for all gnomes who sell <br/>\nscopes for 100 plat...HAHAHA. wow, you must find the stupidest ppl in the <br/>\nworld to pull that scam off.  personally, i am kind of disgusted that so <br/>\nmany ppl here are so greedy. i have never before been disgusted to be a <br/>\ngnome...but there is a first time for everything i guess.<br/>\n-&quot;Honest&quot; Ranth Rathan, Affordable Tinkerer Extraoridnaire&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
