Has anyone done any research into the unstable firewater mentioned in the<br/>\n   journal? The one that sent a firework screaming into the storage facility?<br/>\n   I tried several combinations of multiple Gnomish Spirits and water, but no<br/>\n   progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Any idea where this &quot;storage cavern&quot; mentioned is?<br/>\n<br/>\n4. I tried combining a stalking probes and a firewater from the other reference<br/>\n   in the first (2nd?) journal. Where Gimble was afraid the probe could<br/>\n   explode (funny, I&#39;m HOPING the dam probes will explode!  :)  Anyone else<br/>\n   try stuff along this line?<br/>\n<br/>\n5.

Anyone find any use for the small power sources and function force modules<br/>\n   found in Solusek?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
