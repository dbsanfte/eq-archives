I don&#39;t think so.  Plus I&#39;m at work and its nice to do something different for a change (aside from cruising the chat boards looking for that recipe. *grin*).  You are also correct in that some combinations just won&#39;t work - ie 8 fishing poles, 1 fishing pole, etc, etc, etc...  But, we&#39;re going the methodical route.  The list I&#39;m currently creating lists EVERY possible combination with the 13 items we know of or guess will be used.  Now, I do recall someone saying that the CFPole could be made when the tool box was only<br/>\n4 slots.  Does anyone know if this is true for sure?  If so, that makes life TONS easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Guys, you aren&#39;t really being realistic here. You say that there is a<br/>\n&gt; certain amout of items that we can use to make it, what are you saying?<br/>\n&gt; Thats it&#39;s 13? Let&#39;s just say we decided that only 4 slots are used to make<br/>\n&gt; it, even then, you can&#39;t make any acurate calculation of the amount of<br/>\n&gt; combinations there are, I mean, I dout we will be using grease, sprockets,<br/>\n&gt; gnomish bolts, and gears to be making the fishing pole. We probably have to<br/>\n&gt; have some kind of rod or shaft too, and with your calulations, you are<br/>\n&gt; inluding various of those useless combinations, that we can probably guess<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t make the pole. You are just going to have to face the fact that we<br/>\n&gt; just have to keep trying, or find some alternate way of learning the recipe,<br/>\n&gt; so no amount of calculations are going to help us much unless you aply them<br/>\n&gt; in a practical way, so you should stop wasting your time. That is all I have<br/>\n&gt; to say for now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sniffledoo Copperheart.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fizz, I think you might be onto something here.  It seems I might need to head home (Ak&#39;Anon) to try some stuff out.  Although I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll get far on 100pp.  Hmm, flowing black robe or the recipe for a CFPole?  ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sragan@...\">sragan@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Wanted: Someone to try this series of fishing pole attempts...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello folks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m outta cash, and this is an expensive &#39;series&#39; that I hate to assign to one of the brave souls that has been blowing cash coming and going trying to figure out the right recipe for the collapsable fishing pole.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Its the &quot;2 metal Rods and a gear&quot; Theory.
