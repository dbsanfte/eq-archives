However , that distresses me about the way <br/>\nEnchanters are capeable of illusions long before the druids can and there art <br/>\ninvolves illusions so much, but not have a system of sharing any of the <br/>\nillusions like the druid. A few friends and I came with a few Ideas to be <br/>\ninvolved with either Everquest as it is now or when you up the level limit. <br/>\nThe main purpose of this letter is to express on how illusions can be <br/>\nbenificial to not only the player but the staff at EQ. Here is a few possiple <br/>\nexamples to introduce to you the ways to incoperate this:  (1) Limit it to <br/>\nhigh level enchanters spells only....24th and up...... (2) could make it a <br/>\ngroup only function like the share wolf form with druid............(3) As a <br/>\nsafeguard so no one is turned into a illusion without permission....make it <br/>\nlike the ressurect spell posting ,so before you turn into another form so <br/>\npeople can choose yes or no....  /   As for the benifiet of the staff if you <br/>\ninclude the casting of all race illusions you will possibly cut down the <br/>\nnagging of players needlessly asking for your guides to get them out of zones <br/>\nthey should have not been in the first place...and would add some more spice <br/>\nto the game.Asit is ya guys looked like you ran out of ideas for illusions <br/>\nonce you  hit the levels of 34th(only 1) , 44th (only 1), and ,49th <br/>\n(none)......Before that you had at least 2 per level starting at level <br/>\n4....if enchanters cant at least share a few illusions by level 9th we are <br/>\nreally should be ashamed since the druid can share wolf form at level 39th <br/>\nand enchanters with the art of illusion in our back pocket <br/>\ncant......Sincerely Cloverleaf &lt;Fennin Ro Server&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
