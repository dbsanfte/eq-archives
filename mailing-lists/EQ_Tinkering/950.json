He<br/>\nalso loves hiding stuff.  I suspect that if any city does have a secret<br/>\narea, then it&#39;s Ak&#39;Anon.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kyx2000@...\">kyx2000@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kyx2000@...\">kyx2000@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, October 17, 1999 5:35 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Ideas...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kyx2000@...\">kyx2000@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlright, here is a quick report, so you don&#39;t have to do what i did over <br/>\nagain, reguarding the star gadget thing. I had a partner stand by the star <br/>\nand keep it turned, here is what it doesn&#39;t do: Open the chest near the fish<br/>\n<br/>\ngoods selling clockwork. Open up anything in the deep deep pool of water in <br/>\nthe very back of Ak&#39;anon by the junk yard man. Open up anything in the zoo <br/>\nor the rest of that building, open up anything in the two smaller towers <br/>\noutside of the castle. I havn&#39;t searched the castle itself, or the mines, or<br/>\n<br/>\nnear the gate, or anywhere else i havn&#39;t mentioned. The door sound you hear <br/>\nwhen you turn the crystal is just the crystal itself turning, if it does in <br/>\nfact open something up, its not near by, i have also eliminated that, and <br/>\nalso, we checked the sound out, and the farther you are away from the <br/>\ncrystal the feinter the sound becomes, so its not the door yourself you are <br/>\nhearing. It might just not open anything at all, wouldn&#39;t be suprised, but <br/>\nthat would also be a waste of a hidden little level, anyway, i doubt i will <br/>\ndo a whole lot more searching, as its pretty boring, but i did a lot <br/>\nalready, try and work from there if you can, i would like to see if this <br/>\nthing does anything.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
