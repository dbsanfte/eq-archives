I&#39;m new to the list, just signed up today.  <br/>\n&gt;Anyway this is a question for any mathematic wizards out there.  We have a <br/>\n&gt;total of 8 slots in the toolbox and a total of 12 items to use.  Does <br/>\n&gt;anyone know how many combinations that we can come up with?  Remember that <br/>\n&gt;this includes just having 1 item in the box or 2 or 3 etc. etc.  Well me <br/>\n&gt;personally I would just like to know for curiousity sake.  And don&#39;t worry <br/>\n&gt;you now have another helping hand in the search for the collapsable fishing <br/>\n&gt;pole recipie. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mike<br/>\n&gt;P.S. If we do find it imagine how much it can sell for. :) $$$$$$$$<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
