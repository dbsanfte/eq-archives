We were trying to establish an Ak&#39;Anonian<br/>\ngovernment as part of Fennin Ro&#39;s Roleplaying Collective (a group of<br/>\nindividuals and guilds working to enhance RP).  Fulcrum did TONS of work on<br/>\nthe foundations for Ak&#39;Anon and led the work on an exhaustive indepth series<br/>\nof documents and recommendations.  We even had an historic &quot;Congress&quot; with a<br/>\nhandful of other gnomes to talk about the Ak&#39;Anon government.  This was in<br/>\nApril/May/June.  Probably bad timing since summer was starting and ppl get<br/>\nbusy with RL.  Anyway, he said later he would be busy, but would try to keep<br/>\nup with both the Tinkering and Ak&#39;Anon gov&#39;t web sites.  He must be busier<br/>\nthan we thought since I haven&#39;t seen him for months. <br/>\nFulcrum, we need ya!
