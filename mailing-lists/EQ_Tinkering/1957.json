(I blew all my money on my lvl 24 spells)  I&#39;m not really making<br/>\nmoney on the skill yet though.  I am hoping that changes with spyglasses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had wonderful success selling one cam for 20pp or two for 35pp.  What<br/>\nis everyone else&#39;s price point on these?  At 40pp for two cams, there aren&#39;t<br/>\nas many people that want to buy.<br/>\n<br/>\nFireworks have been a big hit.  I even have people I&#39;ve never met asking me<br/>\nto make them.  I&#39;ve sold them for 1pp for the 4 pieces you get with each<br/>\nattempt.  I even made 12 fireworks (48 pieces) for someone once for 25pp!<br/>\nIt&#39;s kind of a pain to get the bat wings (there is a vendor in ECommons) but<br/>\nthey seem to sell well.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my usual speil... (if you are on Bertoxxulous you can&#39;t steal this<br/>\n:-P )<br/>\n<br/>\n/auction Attention Fletchers: Tinkered Bow Cams.  Half the price of the<br/>\nvendors!  Make a two cam bow for the cost of a one cam bow!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWopr, gnome wizard<br/>\nBertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
