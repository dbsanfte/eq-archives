I&#39;m a lvl 22 gnome rogue, and<br/>\nthats the only clockwork spider in town that cons green to me.  Plus that<br/>\nglowing white design on the floor is unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen in<br/>\nak&#39;anon.  I played a dark elf once, and this design is very much like the<br/>\nglowing neon designs in neriak.  I was considering trying to kill that<br/>\nclockwork, but there&#39;s a blood red clockwork guard in the room opposite and<br/>\nwas afraid it might join in.  (not to mention all the other guards in the<br/>\npalace)  :)  I also tried hailing the clockwork and clicking all over<br/>\neverything in that room and didn&#39;t find anything.  One thing I didn&#39;t try<br/>\nwas getting someone to click on the rotateing star while I was in that room<br/>\nto see if something happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\ngr0k - Stranger in a Strange Land - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juju.org\">http://www.juju.org</a><br/>\n&quot;Linux... find out what you&#39;ve been missing while<br/>\nyou&#39;ve been rebooting Windows NT&quot; - Infoworld<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Ralph Scott &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rscott@...\">rscott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Andy Smith &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AndyS@...\">AndyS@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m actually interested to the allusion (from the text) that mixing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different amounts of water can cause a different (not necessarily good)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is also the allusion to a storage cavern in akanon.
