At 30% failure rating cost to make the Aqualung is<br/>\n285pp or roughly 300pp.  So for selling them at 1000pp, you make about 700pp<br/>\nprofit per aqualung, and after 5 I would be at the break even point.<br/>\nEverything after that is profit or money that will be reinvested in the<br/>\nfuture to get the skill necessary to tackle the Rebreathers.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Askur also said that he would be giving them a discount equal to 50% of<br/>\nthe cost of the Aqualung to his return customers.  That&#39;s 500pp per return<br/>\ncustomer, which lowers his profit to 200pp per Aqualung, and now he would<br/>\nhave to sell 18 of these to break even on his original investment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you are willing to sell them so low, you might want to start keeping<br/>\nbetter track of your failure rates on these items, and not belittle the<br/>\nbusiness practices of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I think he&#39;s doing it right, he insures return customers and is<br/>\ngiving them a good deal to boot.  I did the very same thing on bows.. I<br/>\nwould charge roughly 2 to 2.5 times my cost on the bow, and offer them a<br/>\ndiscount for turning in their old bows for an upgrade, and I have a huge<br/>\nnumber of customers returning to me, and they are constantly referring<br/>\npeople to me for their bows.  I get /tells from people I have never heard of<br/>\nall the time, saying &quot;So-an-so told me to get my bow from you, can you make<br/>\nblah blah blah&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my opinion, and it&#39;s worth what you are paying for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nVapn Maistre, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rathan Silvermyst [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqlegion@...\">eqlegion@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, November 14, 1999 1:31 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Digest Number 146<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Rathan Silvermyst&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqlegion@...\">eqlegion@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nthank ye kindly for insulting my intelligence.  paying 1k for a<br/>\nLung....congratulations on fooling the masses.  personnaly i think it is<br/>\ntaking advantage of ppl.  the return i get far outweighs my expenses, and i<br/>\nam selling them faster than i can make em.  as for all gnomes who sell<br/>\nscopes for 100 plat...HAHAHA. wow, you must find the stupidest ppl in the<br/>\nworld to pull that scam off.  personally, i am kind of disgusted that so<br/>\nmany ppl here are so greedy. i have never before been disgusted to be a<br/>\ngnome...but there is a first time for everything i guess.<br/>\n-&quot;Honest&quot; Ranth Rathan, Affordable Tinkerer Extraoridnaire<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I dont know what the hell you outhers do but i think you need an marketing<br/>\n&gt;department.

Take Bow cam�s for example,<br/>\n&gt;i gor an order of 8 cam�s it took 12 tries to make 8, thats 4 failures and<br/>\n&gt;i sold them for 25 pp each, it�s almost nno profit at all so     in the<br/>\n&gt;futare i�m going to charge 30 pp for them i think if i even sell them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Askur of Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
