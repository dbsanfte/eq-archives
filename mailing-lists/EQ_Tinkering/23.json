Books are cheap, 2gp or<br/>\nsomething<br/>\nToolbox? can&#39;t remember 2-5pp or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nInfravision goggles? Well, I don&#39;t know that any of us have found the book to<br/>\nmake those yet.

I&#39;ve just<br/>\n+AD4APg- reached level 9 myself, and finished buying all the 3rd circle spells that I<br/>\n+AD4APg- need.  Tinkering is now my next goal.  I have a few questions though. At what<br/>\n+AD4APg- level will your tinkering skills improve.  I haven&#39;t been back to my homeland<br/>\n+AD4APg- in a while and I was wondering how much the toolkit and the first book cost.<br/>\n+AD4APg-<br/>\n+AD4APg- Malkin<br/>\n+AD4APg- Gnomish Wizard and soon to be seller of infravision goggles.<br/>\n+AD4APg-<br/>\n+AD4APg- David Nelson wrote:<br/>\n+AD4APg-<br/>\n+AD4APg-  From: David Nelson DNelson+AEA-Cometind.com<br/>\n+AD4APg- <br/>\n+AD4APg-  Same here.. made the Flameless Lantern last night myself.

Worked<br/>\n+AD4APg-  every time. Then I tried the only item that I could afford and tada, the<br/>\n+AD4APg-  first(in the game I think) Flameless Lantern (gave it away) then two<br/>\n+AD4APg-  failures. But all in all I made 3. They seem to be<br/>\n+AD4APg-  at least as bright as Lightstone, possibly brighter, but being a Gnome, what<br/>\n+AD4APg-  do I need it for? :) But it&#39;s been done. Tinkering works.<br/>\n+AD4APg-  Going to put in my order for Pie Tins and start<br/>\n+AD4APg-  making Compasses. And as soon as I find a tattered<br/>\n+AD4APg-  cloak, it&#39;s Thermal Cloak time.
