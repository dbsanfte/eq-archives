I think we&#39;re right with<br/>\n&gt; the metal shaft and rod combos but we&#39;re missing something.  Here&#39;s a few<br/>\n&gt; of my thoughts thus far:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Fletching strings or dwarven wire as a component seems unlikely.<br/>\n&gt; Although some items need things MADE by other trade skills (compass), I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t think of anything that requires you buy components from a different<br/>\n&gt; trade skill.  Dwarven wire is for the Trueshot Bow quest (?) and takes a<br/>\n&gt; while to obtain - lots of travelling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Spiderling silk sounds like a good possibility.  Watch out though, there<br/>\n&gt; is SPIDER silk, and SPIDERLING silk.  The latter seems more likely as<br/>\n&gt; spiderlings are right in Steamfont and it would be very similar to how the<br/>\n&gt; lockpicks need a rat ear.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Spriket?  Assuming that the two books are all that exists of tinkering<br/>\n&gt; now, a spriket is the only item not used for any project.  What is a<br/>\n&gt; spriket though?  Not in the dictionary...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Raw bamboo doesn&#39;t seem like a likely component.  It is a bard<br/>\n&gt; instrument, also the pic of the collapsible pole shows it constructed of<br/>\n&gt; metal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - A bottle as a possible component.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Luke<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; For details, including our weekly drawing, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
