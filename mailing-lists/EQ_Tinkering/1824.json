If a gnome enchanter was to<br/>\nillusion him/herself as a human, he/she would be full size.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne question I have to you enchanter folks - does the illusion ever run<br/>\noff?  If so - then wouldn&#39;t the King periodically have to recast the<br/>\nillusion?  <br/>\n<br/>\nHehe perhaps if someone killed him, he would drop a item that would have<br/>\n&quot;shrinked illusion&quot; as an effect.  I for one am not about to attempt it<br/>\nhowever.  I like having a &quot;kindly&quot; faction to my own king. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nQdP<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Quasinom de Plume is my quasi nom-de-plume&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Gazamel Prime &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gazamel@...\">gazamel@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yay, I was hoping someone else figured this out<br/>\n&gt; besides me.
