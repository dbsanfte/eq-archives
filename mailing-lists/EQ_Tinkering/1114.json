At least I had a blast.  Thanks to Rotgut for<br/>\nputting it togeather and also to the other brother and sister gnomes of Sol<br/>\nRo for bringing the kegs!  It was a nice way to celebrate the knowledge of<br/>\nthe 3rd Tinkering Book.  We had cliff jumping, a drunken race, a party at<br/>\nKing Akanon&#39;s in which he actually killed himself for some reason, a<br/>\nlevitate party and many brawls.  Some of us turned in our books to the POD.<br/>\nI think I saw 3 GMs there, 2 of which were fellow gnomes.  A great time of<br/>\ngeneral Gnomeing about.  And I kicked a couple butts, including Ubershadows!<br/>\n=)   But I died many horrible deaths, too.  I look forward to the next<br/>\nGnomestock!<br/>\n<br/>\nKilkin Cobblepot - 28th Gemchopper - Fen Ro<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tTony Buser [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gr0k@...\">gr0k@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tWednesday, October 27, 1999 9:30 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[EQ_Tinkering] Gnomestock<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Tony Buser&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gr0k@...\">gr0k@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWell I had fun.  heh but I didn&#39;t see any fireworks display!<br/>\n:(  Well maybe<br/>\n\t\tthere was a display, but I blinked and missed it.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAt the next one we should all get levitate and go to the top<br/>\nof the<br/>\n\t\twindmills!  :)  I did that once before, it was pretty fun.<br/>\nWould be quite a<br/>\n\t\tsight to see 40 gnomes all crowded on the roofs of the<br/>\nwindmills.  heh  you<br/>\n\t\tcan see pictures of me on the roofs at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juju.org/photos/everquest/\">http://www.juju.org/photos/everquest/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAlso next time we should try and get the news sites like<br/>\nstratics to post a<br/>\n\t\tmessage on the news page about it so we can get even more<br/>\npeople to come.<br/>\n\t\tThough I&#39;ve never seen that many people in the akanon zone<br/>\nat one time.  heh<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t- the ORIGINAL Ubershadow Leprechaun - Gnome Rogue -<br/>\nErollisi Marr (ignore<br/>\n\t\tthat guy that stole my name on Solusek Ro grr)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t---<br/>\n\t\tgr0k - Stranger in a Strange Land - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juju.org\">http://www.juju.org</a><br/>\n\t\t&quot;Linux... find out what you&#39;ve been missing while<br/>\n\t\tyou&#39;ve been rebooting Windows NT&quot; - Infoworld<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAccurate impartial advice on everything from laptops to<br/>\ntable saws.<br/>\n\t\t&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/Productopia2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/Productopia2</a> &quot;&gt;Click<br/>\nHere&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
