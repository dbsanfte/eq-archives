They did it when the servers were down with that Cerfnet and<br/>\n&gt; UUnet trouble.  Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has tried the tinkering<br/>\n&gt; skill since the patch to see if the skill cap (I think it was (Level - 15) x<br/>\n&gt; 5) has been fixed yet.  I had been hoping that they would fix it in this<br/>\n&gt; patch after someone reported that a GM said they should be fixing it soon,<br/>\n&gt; maybe even in the next patch.  If anyone knows if you can Tinker outside the<br/>\n&gt; level cap now please say so =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Logalog,<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
