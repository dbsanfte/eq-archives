I have a rogue character and was able to pick a lock in Freeport <br/>\nusing mechanized lockpicks with a skill level of 125.  I know 120 was not <br/>\nsufficient since I received a cannot pick lock message at that level.  When <br/>\nI reached skill of 125, the door opened.  I assumed that the mechanized <br/>\nlockpicks helped, but when I recently tried regular lockpicks, the door <br/>\nopened also.  So basically, there is no difference between the two.  What a <br/>\nbunch of crap.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtinky Eveready<br/>\n40 Gnomish Rogue, Bristlebane Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
