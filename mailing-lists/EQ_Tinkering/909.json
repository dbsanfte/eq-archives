I haven&#39;t tried the gearheart quest (which i believe is the <br/>\nlessery fey fairy camp one you talked about).  I heard that Bugglegup does <br/>\nspawn now, but I haven&#39;t seen him so it still might be a <br/>\nrumor.  Supposedly, he is one of the bandits that attack the cargo <br/>\nclockwork, but I&#39;ve also never seen the cargo clockwork get attacked.  I <br/>\ndid the observer lens quest but do not remember getting Eldritch Collective <br/>\nadjustment, but I could easily be wrong about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know if you will continue to get faction adjustments for <br/>\ncompleting a quest if you have already completed it before.  I know that it <br/>\nsays your faction has been increased, but they could just increase it by <br/>\n0.  Has anyone successfully raised faction by redoing quests?  If so, the <br/>\nclockwork access card would be a very easy faction adjuster.  Just get a <br/>\ncard from Manik, give to the closest clock and get faction adjustment, just <br/>\nrepeat it over and over... don&#39;t even give cards to the other three clocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:26 AM 10/14/1999 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Andy Smith &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AndyS@...\">AndyS@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Not sure about Kizdean, but the eldritch collective seems to have a limited<br/>\n&gt;set of quests to improve their faction.  I have not done the observer staff<br/>\n&gt;quest, but I suspect that one will give eldritch faction.  There is also a<br/>\n&gt;quest (also never done) to kill the clockwork in the middle of the lesser<br/>\n&gt;fay fairy camp that I believe gives both gemchopper and eldritch faction.<br/>\n&gt;The Bugglegup and the lens quests were still broken last time I checked<br/>\n&gt;(about 3 months ago) so I have no idea if it is possible to use those to<br/>\n&gt;improve faction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does anybody have a list of all gnome NPCs in the world?
