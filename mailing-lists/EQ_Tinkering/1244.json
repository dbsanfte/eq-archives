And I&#39;m not trivial in making it. There is no WAY I could make <br/>\nany profit selling it at 300pp.  In fact, that means you have a success rate<br/>\nof 75% JUST to break even!<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes my tinkering suck? Are you guys making 3 successes out of 4 tries on very <br/>\nnon-trivial stuff? Or even better assuming your profitable?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found I need to charge 2.5x on non-trivial to make any profit. Thats <br/>\n560pp, not 300pp. Sorry, I&#39;m still not too impressed with Aqualungs -<br/>\nespecially at that price.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
