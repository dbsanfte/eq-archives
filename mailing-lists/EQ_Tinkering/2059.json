I would like to <br/>\nsuggest that we fix prices on Cazic Thule for items.  The only other gnome <br/>\ntinkerer I have seen on Cazic is Gnomos and he&#39;s obviously bored with too <br/>\nmuch money as the amount he sells things for I could never compete with.  I <br/>\nwould like get back a little of the money i&#39;ve put into this skill ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMay I suggest<br/>\n70pp for spyglasses<br/>\n650pp for Auqalungs<br/>\n2000pp for rebreathers (not sure on this as I am not at this lvl)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you see gnomos (well he&#39;ll actually approach you telling you you&#39;re <br/>\nselling them for too much and giving tinkerers a bad name.  Tell him that <br/>\nthis was the price agreed by the tinkerers of Cazic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone does disagree with these prices please reply with your ideas :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTzia<br/>\nTinkerer Of Cazic<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
