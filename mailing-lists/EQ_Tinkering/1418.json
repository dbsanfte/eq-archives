I actually like the cap. It means that a gnome that is a master tinkerer <br/>\nhas WORKED for it.. it&#39;s not some level 16 that was powerleveled by his <br/>\nguild and given tons of cash to go wild with. Every copper I&#39;ve put into <br/>\ntinkering has come the hard way, and I&#39;d be a little ticked if a level 16 <br/>\ncould undercut my prices because the cap is removed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like that the cap was unadvertised, and it cost so many people so <br/>\nmuch money to discover it. But it only helps those of us who have achieved <br/>\nlevel and money the hard way.<br/>\n<br/>\nRogue greed, maybe, but my opinion :)<br/>\n<br/>\nYilmatin Kylari<br/>\n37th level gnomish rogue<br/>\nFollower of the Vicious Lemming<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Monica Bradlee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mbradlee@...\">mbradlee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] Tinkering Cap<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sat, 27 Nov 1999 03:53:44 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am planning a revolt of sorts on The Innoruuk server after the patch on <br/>\n&gt;Dec 1st if they do not remove the tinkering cap.  I have gotten about 6 <br/>\n&gt;guilds so far to help me with this, we are all going to petition that the <br/>\n&gt;cap should be removed at the same time with anyone who doesn&#39;t have a clue <br/>\n&gt;having the Guide/Gm refer to me.
