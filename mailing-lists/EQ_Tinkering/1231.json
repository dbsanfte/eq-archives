In fact, my 18 level gnome wizard has a total of 16pp to her name.  With that in mind, what kind of advise can you give me?  Is tinkering worth spending my hard earned pp on that I have been saving for my 20 level spells?  With the new patch, I have high hopes of finally making some pp.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Also, I have going to ask a dumb question.  What is a gem chopper?<br/>\n<br/>\n      Thanks </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
