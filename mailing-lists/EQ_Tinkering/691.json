There&#39;s a really deep section of water at the bottom of<br/>\nAkanon by the mines.  I tried swimming to the bottom as a newbie, but didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave the air.  Later, once my swimming was at a reasonable level, I did make<br/>\nit down and tried swimming into the walls in all directions.  I was really<br/>\nlooking for a passage or something like that.  If anything was lying on the<br/>\nground and didn&#39;t stand out, I could easily have missed it.  Anyway, it&#39;s a<br/>\nbit strange for the &#39;abyss&#39; to be there without a purpose.  Well lets hope<br/>\nit isn&#39;t just a newbie deathtrap.<br/>\n<br/>\nKazaan on Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
