From<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the high levels gnomes I got the impression that tinkering was a complete<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and total waste of time.  In fact one told me he didn&#39;t do it because the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill sucked and it wasn&#39;t worth it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Since when were ANY of the trade skills &quot;worth it?&quot; I don&#39;t think what<br/>\n&gt; drives people to learn skills have anything to do with making money (at<br/>\n&gt; least not since they nerfed pottery) it&#39;s some other sense of expanding<br/>\n&gt; their character. No one makes any money on any of the skills and yet<br/>\n&gt; people still do them for several reasons. In fact my character right now<br/>\n&gt; is working on baking, tailoring, blacksmithing, and jewlcraft.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; losing lots of money but I&#39;m having a great time. When I reach 16, you<br/>\n&gt; better believe I&#39;m going to work my tinkering. Just because I can.  So<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t try and tell me that tinkering isn&#39;t &quot;worth it.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Orevin Gnomish Enchanter and Slayer of Mummies, Karanra server<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--Eron<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aeron@...\">aeron@...</a><br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom The Simpsons:<br/>\n<br/>\nHomer:  Animals are crapping in our houses, and we&#39;re picking it up.
