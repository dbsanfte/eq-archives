Just make the pet have charges, thus decay, when all charges are<br/>\ngone, so is your pet. On a different line, you would have to pick up your<br/>\npet before zoning (dangerous if running from a train) or you would loose it<br/>\nas it would 32k.  If the pet is destroyed in battle, then you loose the pet<br/>\npermanently, including all parts.  Obviously, going LD would be bad, but<br/>\nhey, that makes this even more interesting to Verant as a money sink right.<br/>\nJust my 2 cp worth<br/>\n<br/>\nCalador<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.
