If you talk to him<br/>\nhe<br/>\nwill talk about making a bridge to Odus.  He needs a list of engineers<br/>\ndelivered to Antonius<br/>\nBayles&#39; messenger.  He refused to give me the list to someone who conned<br/>\nindifferent, so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know if a friendlier face will get it.  I have been told that if you<br/>\nkeep asking him about<br/>\nthe engineers (the text is not bracketed) he will drop the note, which lists<br/>\nthe names of the<br/>\nthree engineers.  The human engineer is located in the arcane science building<br/>\nin Freeport,<br/>\nbut I don&#39;t know what you need to do to get him to respond (giving him the<br/>\nnote doesn&#39;t work).<br/>\nBut if you talk to Rucio Divella in the office of the people he says that<br/>\nHansl Bigroon is the<br/>\noffice manager.  If asked who are the other engineers he says he saw them<br/>\nonce, one human,<br/>\none dwarf and one gnome.  The gnome he said was followed around by some sort<br/>\nof automation<br/>\n(perhaps the one in Steamfont?).  I am not sure where to go from there, but it<br/>\nsounds<br/>\nintriguing.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
