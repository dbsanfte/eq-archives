This is also the guy that claims his little brother <br/>\n posted as him, claimed to have gained supersecret important information <br/>\n about tinkering, claimed to have communicated with important tinering <br/>\n people, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\n Trust this person no more.  Everything he has said up to this point can be <br/>\n considered falsehoods.  I know not why he wasted the time of everyone on <br/>\n this list, flooded their mailboxes with trash, or claimed to have any real <br/>\n information whatsoever.  If it indeed was a joke, his laugh upon us has <br/>\n seriously backfired.  To you, Joshua Bednarz, if that really is your real <br/>\n name, I salute you for a job well screwed.  I would hire you to work for the <br/>\n other guy.  I would ask you for a handshake, then say &quot;too slow&quot; and jerk my <br/>\n hand away.  I say &quot;neener neener&quot; to you and your descendants for 3 <br/>\n generations of twins.  I wiggle my bum at thee.  School children pass by and <br/>\n snicker at you.  You would fail as court jester.  No one would come to your <br/>\n hanging.  When you go shopping, people hand you clues.  When the waiter <br/>\n gives you the check he says &quot;oh, its you, nevermind&quot;.  Girl scouts wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n wash your car at Hardees.  The gas station attendant won&#39;t give you the <br/>\n bathroom key, even if you pay him.  Dogs hump your leg at every bar and <br/>\n dance club.  Ugly women won&#39;t even date you.<br/>\n <br/>\n You, sir, have been flamed.  Burn for TTL= -1.<br/>\n <br/>\n And now, for useful tinkering info.<br/>\n <br/>\n There are 4 pieces from the gnomes in Solusek that might be logically useful <br/>\n for tinkering: Small Power Source, Large Power Source, Functional Force <br/>\n Module, Broken Force Module.  The following combinations have failed to <br/>\n produce anything:<br/>\n <br/>\n Functional Force Module + Large Power Source<br/>\n Broken Force Module + Small Power Source<br/>\n Broken Force Module + Broken Force Module<br/>\n <br/>\n You may ask why I tried such strange combinations but not a logical flow.  <br/>\n Well, the items don&#39;t load evenly.  I have a lot of broken pieces, one or <br/>\n two small power sources, and I used up the only functional force module and <br/>\n large power source I had.  So, if these really are tinkerable, it will prove <br/>\n a pain to gather materials to use them.<br/>\n <br/>\n Phenglei Kai, of Erollisi Marr &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh man I just have to say this is some funny shit!!!!!!!!!!
