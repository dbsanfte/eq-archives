I have made like 70 lanterns, 20 compasses, some lockpicks, but<br/>\nhave never seen my skill increase like other trade skills.  I fact I spent<br/>\nan hour yesterday just making lanterns.  I attempted to make 36 of them<br/>\n(made like 32), but never say any comments about my skill increasing.  Are<br/>\nwe wasting our time on practice?<br/>\n<br/>\n(Could someone send me a quick Email not as to if they got this message or<br/>\nnot?
