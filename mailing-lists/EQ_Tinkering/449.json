Or perhaps<br/>\nfrom the standpoint of cannibalizing the reel and string from a pole.<br/>\n<br/>\nShafts - I think so, just from the statement that the pole was comfused<br/>\nwith a spyglass, which operates on a telescoping mechanism.<br/>\n<br/>\nRods - Well, the pole is very light and flimsy, thats why you have to add<br/>\nan extra rod to support the weight of a bottle, lens and twine in order to<br/>\nmake a spyglass.  So I don&#39;t think a rod is in the recipie<br/>\n<br/>\nGears - If a fishing pole is in the recipe because the reel is being<br/>\ncannibalized I don&#39;t see any logical reason to have gears<br/>\n<br/>\nSprocket - Same as gear<br/>\n<br/>\nString - possibly...  depends on weather or not the fishing line is<br/>\ncabbibalized from the other fishing poles in the recipe.  At any rate I<br/>\ndoubt it is the metal twine, more likely its a clothe twine or cord or<br/>\nsilken thread of some sort.<br/>\n<br/>\nCork - could be a possibility<br/>\n<br/>\nSpricket - what the hell is a spriket?<br/>\n<br/>\nBolts - Its possible that if the reel is cannibalized from an existing<br/>\npole, that a bolt will be needed to mount it to a shaft<br/>\n<br/>\nGrease - Also possible to lubricate the shafts so that they collapse easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaw bamboo - another possibility<br/>\n<br/>\nPrice for pole:  I bet it doesn&#39;t cost much more than 5 plat to make, and<br/>\nis an easy item like the lantern and compass.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the decision that needs to be made is this:<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the collapsable fishing pole a modification of a regular pole<br/>\n<br/>\nor<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the collapsable fishing pole something created entirely from tinker<br/>\ncomponents<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I think this question needs to be answered is that if it is a<br/>\nmodification, then we need to look at parts that would follow that line of<br/>\nreasoning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRotgut</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
