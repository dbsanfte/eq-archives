However , that distresses me about the way<br/>\n&gt; Enchanters are capeable of illusions long before the druids can and there art<br/>\n&gt; involves illusions so much, but not have a system of sharing any of the<br/>\n&gt; illusions like the druid. A few friends and I came with a few Ideas to be<br/>\n&gt; involved with either Everquest as it is now or when you up the level limit.<br/>\n&gt; The main purpose of this letter is to express on how illusions can be<br/>\n&gt; benificial to not only the player but the staff at EQ. Here is a few possiple<br/>\n&gt; examples to introduce to you the ways to incoperate this:  (1) Limit it to<br/>\n&gt; high level enchanters spells only....24th and up...... (2) could make it a<br/>\n&gt; group only function like the share wolf form with druid............(3) As a<br/>\n&gt; safeguard so no one is turned into a illusion without permission....make it<br/>\n&gt; like the ressurect spell posting ,so before you turn into another form so<br/>\n&gt; people can choose yes or no....  /   As for the benifiet of the staff if you<br/>\n&gt; include the casting of all race illusions you will possibly cut down the<br/>\n&gt; nagging of players needlessly asking for your guides to get them out of zones<br/>\n&gt; they should have not been in the first place...and would add some more spice<br/>\n&gt; to the game.Asit is ya guys looked like you ran out of ideas for illusions<br/>\n&gt; once you  hit the levels of 34th(only 1) , 44th (only 1), and ,49th<br/>\n&gt; (none)......Before that you had at least 2 per level starting at level<br/>\n&gt; 4....if enchanters cant at least share a few illusions by level 9th we are<br/>\n&gt; really should be ashamed since the druid can share wolf form at level 39th<br/>\n&gt; and enchanters with the art of illusion in our back pocket<br/>\n&gt; cant......Sincerely Cloverleaf &lt;Fennin Ro Server&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
