I DO know what I&#39;m talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Borxx lens has nothing to do with the telescope quest.<br/>\nThe telescope lens has nothing to do with the staff quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are completely different. Just because there is a lens involved DOES <br/>\nnot mean that they are related. One is a lens made of biological material <br/>\nthat is gotten off of an evil eye named Borxx, if I&#39;m not mistaken.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe others are 4 telescope lenses made of glass, probably made by the <br/>\ngnomes.<br/>\n<br/>\nA piece of glass for a telescope lens couldn&#39;t be substituted with a lens <br/>\nfrom a living things eye, just as the lens of an eye could not be <br/>\nsubstituted with a glass lens (and no contacts only assist is correcting <br/>\nyour vision problems which are caused by the actual eye lens). That is all <br/>\nthere is two it -- end of story. The two quests are completely seperate and <br/>\nhave absolutely nothing to do with each other. So if you want to talk about <br/>\nhow to get the Staff of the Observers, then maybe you should subscribe to a <br/>\nmailing list that is interested in it. This is a tinkering list, so unless <br/>\nyou have some kind of evidence that The Staff is involed in a tinkering <br/>\nquest, then lets drop it, ok?<br/>\n<br/>\nSniffledoo Copperheart. 14th rank warrior of The Gemchopper Hall --<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
