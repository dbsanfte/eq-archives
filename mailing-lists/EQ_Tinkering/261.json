The lense quest appears to be working <br/>\n&gt;again.  You can ask both of the observers who before told us to come back <br/>\n&gt;or we weren&#39;t experienced.  I now have the three lenses.  Also, if you go <br/>\n&gt;to Trudon (sp) he will tell you his brother (Bidl) is in Kelethin at <br/>\n&gt;nights in a tavern, and wandering around during the day.  I haven&#39;t found <br/>\n&gt;Bidl yet, but am hangin out in Kelethin looking for him!  Let me know if <br/>\n&gt;you find him, and where.  I also suspect that Trudon could have been <br/>\n&gt;wrong, and meant Kaladim, since that is where Bidl was on the test <br/>\n&gt;server.
