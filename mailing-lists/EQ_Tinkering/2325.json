Kedge was still popular<br/>\nand Fishbone still went from 5k as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday on Veeshan,  before the quests but after expansion I was thankful<br/>\nwhen I got 1500-1800 this summer.  Since the quest was announced I have<br/>\ngone back to asking for 2k and selling them to guilds that want more then 3<br/>\nfor 1800. Then again my tinkering is at 172, so I my failures are pretty<br/>\nrare so those prices still make cash.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike you I would be interested in hearing what people are selling them for.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers - Gesler/Grizer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;i know many of you accross all the servers that have high tinkering skills<br/>\n&gt;have probably been propositioned to make rebreathers.  especially now that<br/>\n&gt;they are part of the warrior FA quest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m just curious what a reasonable rate might be?<br/>\n&gt;i know it kinda depends on the server, but i have had people tell me to<br/>\n&gt;charge anywhere from 2k - 10k for EACH rebreather.  While i don&#39;t mind a<br/>\n&gt;profit, i really would hate to be raping my customers, and at the same time<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t want to undercut everyone else.  i tinker because its fun, not as a<br/>\n&gt;way to make cash.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-----<br/>\nGreg Jones, WD5IVD                 Austin, Texas<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wd5ivd@...\">wd5ivd@...</a>      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tapr.org/~wd5ivd\">http://www.tapr.org/~wd5ivd</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
