From <br/>\nthe high levels gnomes I got the impression that tinkering was a complete <br/>\nand total waste of time.  In fact one told me he didn&#39;t do it because the <br/>\nskill sucked and it wasn&#39;t worth it.  I did get a name from a high level <br/>\ngnome who said he knew someone who used to tinker a lot.  He said the guys <br/>\nname was salvadori or something like that and that he rarely came on.  He <br/>\ndoes however come on every once in a while.  The other thing that I found <br/>\nout, from the gm&#39;s, was that the skill is not broken.  I asked every gm that <br/>\nhas been on for the past two nights and they all keep telling me it&#39;s not <br/>\nbroken.  Well that&#39;s my search so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcoux</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
