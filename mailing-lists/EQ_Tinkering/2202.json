Which all in all would be the strongest class with even a crappy little \n  pet. A wizards biggest problem is keeping the mob occupied while he/she cast a \n  spell. Think about it even if the pet had 200 HP it would take a giant 2 hits \n  to kill it giving the casting times on wizard spells. He could get his root \n  off and then proceed to whip up the giant I am not saying he would still win, \n  but a class that is strong like wizards that do not use pets and would really \n  damn strong if they did, would be something Verant would not ever \n  do.</font></span></div>\n  <div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-652027441250531213-23062000\"><font\n face=\"Rockwell\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-652027441250531213-23062000\"><font\n face=\"Rockwell\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-652027441250531213-23062000\"><font\n face=\"Rockwell\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
