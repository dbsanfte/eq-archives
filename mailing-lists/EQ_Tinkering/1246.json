After a few GMs noted at how many crafted gauntlets were popping up at <br/>\nmerchants, they changed crafted to lore (except bracers of course.) I <br/>\nrealize this isn&#39;t a trade skill item but many  items that were once <br/>\nsellable or tradeable are now not. Tis sad, but it defeats the idea of TRADE <br/>\nskills.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind of Tinkering&#39;s track record... has anything up to this point <br/>\nbeen vitally useful to sell? nope.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna change now <br/>\neither.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerrant has started a tradition now of making things useful to their <br/>\noriginal owner be it by making the item no-drop, or changing the charges on <br/>\nan item when traded. As noted in previous mesaages, this is already in place <br/>\nwith items such as the Staff of Observers.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerrant is not likely aiming to replace the long lines for a fishbone <br/>\nearring with a tinkered item.  It seems they are coming up with a variety of <br/>\nways for different classes to make the journey into Kedge. They merely added <br/>\na way for us tinkerers to journey there ourselves with the help of our on <br/>\ntrade skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been to Kedge Keep twice merely on enduring breath,<br/>\nTalkum Talmaich</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
