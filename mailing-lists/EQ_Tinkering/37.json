(Small<br/>\ncloak was<br/>\nwhat I used) But I could have just been wrong. Because I used a Belt as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\nAnd a cloth rope, because I&#39;m a mage and can&#39;t were a belt. So, I&#39;ve got no<br/>\nclue.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Zikkin<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. the Eldritch Collective is the keepers of Tinkering info I think.<br/>\nBut what that means? Good question. I think that you have to complete<br/>\nquests for the Collective, the Spare Lens quest would be one to try,<br/>\nbut at level 19 I can&#39;t even get the quest. Anyone of a lower level want<br/>\nto try this one? No one has finished it as far as I know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ncorenee wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: corenee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:corenee@...\">corenee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; first i would like to say ya&#39;ll are doin a great thing here. Here&#39;s what<br/>\n&gt; i have heard, there are three other books(besides the two at mills)<br/>\n&gt; where or when you get em is beyond me. I too have made the firewater,<br/>\n&gt; and the lantern, and say one person auctioning off the cams for the<br/>\n&gt; bows, so i know those have been made also. As has already been posted i<br/>\n&gt; too heard that the infravision goggles instructions came from a quest.<br/>\n&gt; Which one i don&#39;t know. Also i know as a fact that you can tinker<br/>\n&gt; successfully at level 1, but cannot gain any skill level til level 16.<br/>\n&gt; So all of you that are waiting to try it, go for it...it will work, i<br/>\n&gt; decided to try it at level 11 with my gnome, and made fire water on<br/>\n&gt; first try. Also i believe that you can make the thermal cloak from just<br/>\n&gt; about any cloak...doesn&#39;t have to be tattered... I am wanting to try<br/>\n&gt; similar things with lanterns ans stuff..(i.e. use small lantern and<br/>\n&gt; such). If anyone has tried it with other items please let me know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Jaqui(math marr)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to &quot;INDIE-GRRL,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
