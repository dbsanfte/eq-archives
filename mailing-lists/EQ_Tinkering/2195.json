You tinker a <br>pet-in-a-box which wighs, lets say 25. when you \n  want a pet you right click <br>the boc. the box&#39;s weight drops to .5, and in \n  about 30 seconds of cast time a <br>pet apears. to make the pet refold and go \n  back in it&#39;s box, you right click <br>the box again, and afyer another 30 \n  seconds of cast time the pet folds up and <br>goes in it&#39;s box. to make sure \n  ppl dont take advantage of ee bags you make <br>the box count as a container. \n  if you zoe w/out folding ur pet your pet will <br>disapear. Also weight and \n  cast times of the pet and box will very from it&#39;s <br>cost, power, and level. \n  IE a level 16 tinkered pet would have a 15 second <br>cast, and weigh 10, but \n  is the same as a 16 mage earth pet. however a lv 30 <br>tinkered pet would \n  have acast time of 120, and weigh 40.<br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
