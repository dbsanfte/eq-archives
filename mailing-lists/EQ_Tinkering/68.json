I&#39;m getting similar increases to when I was trying to get<br/>\nblacksmithing up.  Getting that first point sure was a surprise though,<br/>\nafter having experimented trying to make everything recently it never went<br/>\nup.  I&#39;m level 27 BTW so it had nothing to do with not having the<br/>\nappropriate level.  Making the lanterns is a bit expensive, however, about<br/>\n1pp5gp a pop... you get 8gp or so selling back to vendors.  Will need to do<br/>\nsome more Sand Giant hunting with my guild to fund this skill :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Luke<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ tinkering site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home1.gte.net/jlukas/eq/tinker.htm\">http://home1.gte.net/jlukas/eq/tinker.htm</a><br/>\nUpdated: 6-8-99<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAre you?
