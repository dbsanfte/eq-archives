He used a cam I<br/>\ntinkered for him and successfully made a very nice bow.  I will try to get<br/>\nstats and a screen shot and send it into the web page.<br/>\n<br/>\nRexus <br/>\nGnome Wizard &lt;Veeshan&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:35 AM 8/11/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Stauss, Aaron&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Aaron.Stauss@...\">Aaron.Stauss@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\t\tI for one am relieved to see that the recipe for spyglass is<br/>\n&gt;not broken.  I am also really happy to get more information on the fishing<br/>\n&gt;pole.  Thanks for telling us that you were given the fishing pole and had<br/>\n&gt;not made it.  I, for one, am reluctant to start experimenting on an<br/>\n&gt;expensive trade for fear that the correct recipe is broken &lt; for those that<br/>\n&gt;bake remember the dough recipe? &gt;  It&#39;s rather interesting to see that most<br/>\n&gt;of the trade skills are in a deadlock over certain components for high end<br/>\n&gt;skills:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\t\tAlchemy- Doesn&#39;t seem to be widely implemented yet<br/>\n&gt;\t\tPoison - still too new in my opinion<br/>\n&gt;\t\tTailoring - lack of resources: i.e. hq pelts<br/>\n&gt;\t\tBlacksmithing - always lack the skill for folded sheets of<br/>\n&gt;metal and lack of weapon/plate molds<br/>\n&gt;\t\tBaking - smoker available for purchase but not use<br/>\n&gt;\t\tBrewing - no one can find many of the components &lt;morning<br/>\n&gt;dew for one&gt; and no one knows how to make vodka<br/>\n&gt;\t\tJewelry - extreme shortage of high end components<br/>\n&gt;\t\tFletching - have been told that our cams can be used, but<br/>\n&gt;not verified<br/>\n&gt;\t\tPottery - many of the recipes are invalid (mixing bowl for<br/>\n&gt;one) <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\t\tAnd then comes ours - Tinkering - an extreme lack of<br/>\n&gt;information.  Having dabbled in all the trade skill this one seems the most<br/>\n&gt;frustrating.  In all of the other skill, one buys the book, reads it and<br/>\n&gt;voila..on the road to success, until one gets high enough where the<br/>\n&gt;mysteries of the game come in.  Which I can respect.  But from step one,<br/>\n&gt;things like firewater are left out.  &lt;yes I do know how to make it by the<br/>\n&gt;way&gt;  I can&#39;t seem to get anyone to talk about it, npc&#39;s that is. &lt;but that<br/>\n&gt;could be due to my faction - I&#39;m a necro&gt;  So here is my idea.  If Lukas<br/>\n&gt;would be willing &lt;since his web page has 10,000 hits&gt; There can&#39;t be that<br/>\n&gt;many combinations to make the pole.  Have Lukas make up a spreadsheet of<br/>\n&gt;every combination and people email him request 5 things to try and he give<br/>\n&gt;it to him.  Trial and error, we will succeed.  Then, say, oh for a week keep<br/>\n&gt;the recipe to ourselves before posting.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\t\tSo, what shall we sell this pole for anyway?  Double the<br/>\n&gt;cost of components?  Just my 2 cents.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations to Molly Jones<br/>\n&gt;This week&#39;s FRIENDS & FAMILY WINNER!<br/>\n&gt;To enter, go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
