It is the<br/>\n&quot;replacement&quot; for the Box of Abukar. 100% weight<br/>\nreduction, ALL items fit in it. It is quite possible<br/>\nthat some insane individual sold it back to the<br/>\nmerchant in Ak&#39;Anon because he needed the cash. Next<br/>\ntime I&#39;m back home I&#39;ll do a quick circuit of the<br/>\nvendors and see if it has been added. Could you give a<br/>\nhint to which section of the city the Merchant was in?<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally the quest pack you are talking about is<br/>\nthe Bootstrutter Framed Pack - It has 10 slots, 20-25%<br/>\nweight reduction, NO DROP/LORE and a weight of 2.5<br/>\nstones. I just picked one up doing the Duster V/X<br/>\nquest, although I have heard it given as a reward for<br/>\nthe Red V quest as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Russ Wilcox &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rwilcox@...\">rwilcox@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I found this bag available from a merchant in<br/>\n&gt; Ak&#39;Anon for 5868plat.

Anybody know what this is<br/>\n&gt; about?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have seen the bag two different times however it<br/>\n&gt; is not there when I just<br/>\n&gt; checked 5 minutes ago.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately my notes do not specify *which*<br/>\n&gt; merchant in Ak&#39;Anon but I<br/>\n&gt; believe it was in the main square of the city (both<br/>\n&gt; times).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There was a quest given by warrior&#39;s guild where you<br/>\n&gt; get a 10-slot bag that<br/>\n&gt; reduces weight of carried items; having not<br/>\n&gt; completed this quest I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know if this is the same bag but in any case I<br/>\n&gt; thought that quest gave a NO<br/>\n&gt; DROP.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
