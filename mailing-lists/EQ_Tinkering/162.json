Lets start getting<br/>\n&gt;experience again.  Really, where did they find these programmers?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Onto the items:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1)  Flameless lanterns:  Ok, yet I haven&#39;t sold any.<br/>\n&gt;2)  Compasses:  Make components cheaper to buy, namely the static<br/>\n&gt;orb.  However, I have sold 8 so far for 5pp each, about 16pp profit (over a<br/>\n&gt;two week period).  So I won&#39;t be too upset if they leave it alone.<br/>\n&gt;3)  Stalking Probes:  Make them explode for LOTS (few hundred points or so,<br/>\n&gt;AE) of damage when hit by attackers.  Then it&#39;ll be more than a VERY<br/>\n&gt;expensive Eye of Zomm clone.  This would make it useful and desirable to<br/>\n&gt;handle big mobs.  And make them last a bit longer than 30 seconds, and make<br/>\n&gt;them reusable if not destroyed.<br/>\n&gt;4)  Cams:  Besides getting them to work (really, if its hard to do then<br/>\n&gt;they&#39;ve botched the whole EQ system design from the start, anyone ever hear<br/>\n&gt;of Object Oriented Programming?), make them premium cams providing better<br/>\n&gt;range than any other cams available.<br/>\n&gt;5)  Thermal Cloak:  Why must one use a TATTERED cloak!  This is ridiculous<br/>\n&gt;and another sign of poor programming.  Make it so that a small cloth cape<br/>\n&gt;works too, geez.  OR!  make a cloak pattern for tailors!  Wow!  What a<br/>\n&gt;novel idea!<br/>\n&gt;6)  Mechanical Lockpicks:  Haven&#39;t made any, but will as I am a<br/>\n&gt;rogue.  Hope at least that they work.<br/>\n&gt;7)  The remaining items:  I have no idea how to make them because I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;have the books (and I am not sure they exist) so I have no ideas on their<br/>\n&gt;improvement.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Uggg!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This are great ideas and all, but they do no use here, do a /feedback with <br/>\nall this info<br/>\n<br/>\n-Catbik</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
