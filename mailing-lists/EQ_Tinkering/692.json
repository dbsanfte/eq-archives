I try to help, but you decline it. If what you <br/>\n&gt;want is for me to truly leave with my information, then that is what I will <br/>\n&gt;do. I will leave the choice up to you. I&#39;m trying to apologize by helping, <br/>\n&gt;but you seem to want to be stubborn, and keep insulting me, saying all I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt;out here to do is brag, when in fact I&#39;m trying to do the opposite. What I <br/>\n&gt;have to do could easily be done by a level 1 shaman barbarian. I just want <br/>\n&gt;to check it out for myself first and return with a report, if you all hate <br/>\n&gt;me so much that you wouldn&#39;t even take direct information from me because <br/>\n&gt;you think I want to just brag about it, then I wil quietly leave you all <br/>\n&gt;with out another letter. But like I said, it&#39;s yur choice, you can accept it <br/>\n&gt;or decline it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;The fact that your not willing to reveal what it is you have to do, so that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;others on the list, some of whom are in the high level 40s can do this only<br/>\n&gt;&gt;suggests that your simply back to troll some more.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;So why don&#39;t you just kindly leave?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Oh wait, you want to troll a bunch of messages so then you can come back in<br/>\n&gt;&gt;a couple days and say something like, &quot;Well, I found the important thing,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;but since you all were unkind to me I won&#39;t reveal it, but this time its<br/>\n&gt;&gt;your alls faults, not mine.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Gimme a break and just leave...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Rotgut </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
