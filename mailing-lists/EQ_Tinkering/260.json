The problem is tailors can&#39;t make them as patterns<br/>\ndon&#39;t exist.  Patchwork pieces, including the cloak, are sometimes given as<br/>\na reward for completeing low level quests.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest example I can think of is the Crushbone Belt quest, where you turn in<br/>\nCrushbone Belts to one of the NPCs in the Dwarven warrior&#39;s guild.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nturned in about 30 belts and have not gotten a cloak, but I&#39;ve only turned<br/>\nthem in one at a time.  Perhaps giving him more than one at a time results<br/>\nin a better item... the items I&#39;ve gotten so far are only sleeves, cap,<br/>\nboots, gloves, shoulderpads.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also the Aviak chick talon quest, in the Dwarf paladin guild.<br/>\nNever tried this one, but it should give out patchwork rewards.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Kelethin (warriors?) guild there is a NPC who asks you to bring him a<br/>\nruined wolf pelt, bone chips, spiderling eye and a bat fur.  He gives out<br/>\npatchwork as well, but more commonly cheap gems and rusty weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne quest I would NOT do however, is the pixie dust one in Kelethin.  I<br/>\nactually got a cloak from this one but it is MED size :(  Won&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe small size cloaks do exist, its just a very rare item.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Luke<br/>\nTinkering guide website:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqportal.com/Tinkering\">http://www.eqportal.com/Tinkering</a><br/>\nLast updated: 6-22-99</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
