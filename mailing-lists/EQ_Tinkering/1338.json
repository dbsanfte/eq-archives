You missing <br/>\nthe point, maybe next time you will actually read my note before babbling off <br/>\nor just dont quote it if you dont understand it. My note was simply directed <br/>\nto the guy who flames everyone for selling at a price he does not agree, no <br/>\none cares for your price calculation or &quot;logical selling price&quot; which is not <br/>\npossible if you are actually a tinker. I do not want to argue on this <br/>\npointless issue, some loser who did not want to spend the time nor money to <br/>\ninvest in tinkering started, to flame everyone who did.  Sell at what you <br/>\nwill, no one really cares except the buyer. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;While there is a reasonable price for the items, that allows for<br/>\ncontinuance of working on the skills, some ppl are gona charge less,<br/>\nand some more...  If your a greedy SOB, then anyone selling for less<br/>\nthan you are is hurting your profit, as they steal bussiness and give<br/>\nyou a bad rep (?desearved?).  If you undercut all the time, you hurt<br/>\nyourself long term as you slowly go broke.   You hurt the others that<br/>\njust want to continue to practice the skill in the short term as they<br/>\ncant sell. its all a balance...  if matterals cost X and you fail 50%<br/>\nof the time on average, then logical selling price is 2X, most tack on<br/>\na profit so that they dont feel its wasted time, when they coulda been<br/>\nsitten on their butts waiting for mob X with cool/sellable/tradable<br/>\nitem Y to pop....  The question is: if somebody walks up to you and<br/>\nsays &quot;heres all the parts, please combine those for me. if you fail,<br/>\nno worrys.&quot; would you do it?  Or would you charge them for the 30sec<br/>\nit takes to hit combine.  You didn&#39;t spend any cash on the item, and<br/>\nif its not a triv item, then your gaining skill (possibly) for free.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
