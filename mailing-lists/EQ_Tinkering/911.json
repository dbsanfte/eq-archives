I know that it<br/>\n&gt; says your faction has been increased, but they could just increase it by<br/>\n&gt; 0.  Has anyone successfully raised faction by redoing quests?  If so, the<br/>\n&gt; clockwork access card would be a very easy faction adjuster.  Just get a<br/>\n&gt; card from Manik, give to the closest clock and get faction adjustment, just<br/>\n&gt; repeat it over and over... don&#39;t even give cards to the other three clocks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have never ran into a quest that doesn&#39;t continously raise (or lower) your<br/>\nfaction.
