The only<br/>\nway to make pie-tins is through smithing or pottery.  Being a master potter is<br/>\na huge advantage for you, as you can make the pie tin and make the compass. <br/>\nThat is what I will be doing tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone says &quot;it&#39;s on the vendor next to the blue building in freeport&quot;<br/>\nthey are mistaken.  Because you can buy the tin sketch (1pp and change) from<br/>\nthe vendor to make the tin, but then most will just sell it back to the vendor<br/>\nsince they are not in demand.  Thus why you see it occasionally off a vendor,<br/>\nsomeone actually made that tin and sold it back.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour best bet is to become a master potter.  Preferrable an Enchanter with<br/>\nBenevolence and Illusions so you can get bare base price on everything from<br/>\njewelry to clay.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of clay, I know muddites drop ore in Gorge, does anything drop clay?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kryogen Katspaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Dave Duncan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:deduncan19@...\">deduncan19@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Dave Duncan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:deduncan19@...\">deduncan19@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been a subscriber to the list for quite a while, but must have missed <br/>\n&gt; this part.  I understand that the main topic right now is finding combos for <br/>\n&gt; the fishing pole, but I wanted to get off topic real quick.  So, my goal is <br/>\n&gt; to make compasses for my guild and I was wondering is there any place to buy <br/>\n&gt; pie tins?  I&#39;ve mastered pottery just to make them, but it would be soooo <br/>\n&gt; handy just to be able to buy them.  Anyone know?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Litre Hosen<br/>\n&gt; 22nd hump gnomish necromancer, Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
