I worded my second post wrong, as it was not intended to <br/>\nattacked anyone not a part of the &quot;hmm...lets attack Ranth&#39;s buisness <br/>\ntechinques&quot; group.  This subject has now boiled down to, well, worthless <br/>\ncrap...for example:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hmmm BTW what age are you ? if you could read then you would have noticed <br/>\nthat<br/>\nzinken aint a player ITï¿½S MY E-MAIL  DUMBASS!!!!!!!!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nthis is completely irrelivant to anything that is supposed to be discussed <br/>\nhere, and i apologize for zinken/askur.(i incited him to write this).<br/>\n<br/>\nFocasa and Vapn, i was not trying to be self-righteous, and i see now that i <br/>\nin fact came off that way.  i am in no way better than anyone else.  <br/>\nOk...well...enough of this. Check this out..i laughed my ass off:<br/>\n<br/>\nI got this off of everquest.com from somoene who got it elsewhere...i <br/>\nfigured i should post it here ;)<br/>\nVerant Headquarters, the near future:<br/>\nBrad McQuaid sits at his desk, sipping a coke and reading the<br/>\nalt.games.everquest newsgroup. Suddenly cola shoots from his mouth and<br/>\nnose as something he reads makes him sputter and choke. He sits still for<br/>\nseveral seconds in stunned silence and springs into action<br/>\n<br/>\nHe leaps from his chair and runs to his bookshelf, and pulls gently on a <br/>\nbook<br/>\ntitled: &quot;Customer Service Fundamentals&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book is fake, of course, as such a text would never be present on a<br/>\nbookshelf of a Verant employee. The book slides out one inch, and stops with <br/>\na<br/>\n&quot;click&quot;. The gentle hum of machinery is heard and a section of the wall <br/>\nslides<br/>\nopen, revealing a table. The table is bare marble except for what appears to <br/>\nbe<br/>\na rectangular block of obsidian, set on the table at a 45 degree angle.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrad takes a deep breath, and steps forward. He places his right hand upon <br/>\nthe<br/>\nobsidian block. It is warm to the touch. Suddenly, the stone flares hot for <br/>\nan<br/>\ninstant and a soft disembodied voice proclaims &quot;Aradune Identified. Welcome<br/>\nMr. McQuaid.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBrad hesitates, fearing and dreading what he is about to do. His hand leaves <br/>\nthe<br/>\nobsidian identification panel and he clenches his fist and stares down at <br/>\nhis<br/>\nreflection in the smooth marble. A single tear drips down and slightly <br/>\ndistorts<br/>\nthe image. &quot;No, I must!&quot; he shouts &quot;Its for the good of overall gameplay! <br/>\nIts for<br/>\nthe good of overall gameplay!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith new resolve, his hand slaps roughly against the obsidian panel. Again, <br/>\na<br/>\nhot flash, and the same voice announces &quot;Aradune Identified. Welcome Mr.<br/>\nMcQuaid&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Computer. This is Aradune. Activate the Nerf Protocols&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA white aura speads around Brad, and the door shuts with a loud slam.<br/>\n<br/>\nImmediately around San Diego, pagers begin to beep. Scores of engineers<br/>\nbecome pale, and the one common thought among them is &quot;Oh no, for the love<br/>\nof God no. Not again. Not now!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey soon arrive at Verant headquarters and file slowly into a meeting room.<br/>\nThe eerie red alert light of the Nerf Protocols makes the water cooler seem <br/>\nto<br/>\nbe filled with blood, and despite their thirst, nobody is drinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nA man dressed in what appears to be green metal enters the room. The<br/>\nengineers&#39; last hopes that this is a drill fade. The man sits in a chair and <br/>\nthe<br/>\nroom waits in silence for several minutes. Finally, one brave programmer<br/>\nspeaks up timidly,<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Umm, Brad, why a----&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;WHO IS BRAD????&quot; the man booms, rising from his seat in anger.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No!! No!!! I mean Aradune!! Aradune!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;THIS IS A ROLE PLAYING GAME, FOOL!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am sorry, Aradune! I meant no disrespect! We just wish to know why once<br/>\nagain, the Nerf Protocols have been activated?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Why don&#39;t you ask Thomas?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe entire room turns twiftly to focus in on Thomas, a young level designer <br/>\nfor<br/>\nEverquest. The blood drains out of his face and a look of pure horror <br/>\nspreads<br/>\nacross his features. The engineers on either side of him slowly begin moving<br/>\ntheir chairs away.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;W--w--what did I do?&quot; begged Thomas, &quot;I&#39;ve been working on the Hole, and I<br/>\nhelped out on that new patch program, I haven&#39;t started too much other stuff<br/>\nsince I finished up the plane of hate, and-&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile Aradune says nothing, the flair of his eyes says more than words ever<br/>\ncould.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;NO!! NO!! You approved of the Hateplane! Don&#39;t you remember? We took items<br/>\nfrom the POF? We actually managed to charge a 200pp toll to get in there!&quot;<br/>\nThomas was openly weeping now, the tears flowing unchecked down his face, &quot;I<br/>\nremember how you laughed when I told you we were just going to kill everyone<br/>\nin a zone and call it a &#39;GM Event&#39; &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAradune waits for the sobbing to fade then speaks, dangerously quietly<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Do you know how the Plane of Hate was described on usenet?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;H-h-h-how?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;POSSIBLE&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe room gasps in terror, and they know Thomas&#39; fate is sealed.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;How can we keep our L50 customers, &quot; says Aradune, trembling with anger, <br/>\n&quot;if<br/>\nthe opening of a new zone doesn&#39;t immediately make them loose three or four<br/>\nlevels???&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;M SORRY!!!!&quot; Thomas screams<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I know, I know, &quot; Aradune sooths, leading Thomas out of the room. The other<br/>\nengineers look at each other, hoping that this time will be different. <br/>\nSuddenly<br/>\nthe sobbing turns into a shriek, and is abruptly cut off.<br/>\n<br/>\nAradune re-enters the room, along, washing his hands on a towel. Several<br/>\nengineers begin crying, quietly.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Say It!&quot; Aradune demands, and the engineers repeat the prayer they&#39;ve come<br/>\nto learn too well.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Thomas was nerfed for the good of everquest. For the long term enjoyment<br/>\nof the players, and the viability of the company, it had to be done. There <br/>\nnever<br/>\nwas a Thomas.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe engineers knew by tomorrow that Thomas&#39; cube would be empty, and all<br/>\nrecords of his employment would be gone. Spontaneously, they began shouting<br/>\nover each other trying to impress their leader. &quot;Lay Hands can Fizzle now!&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Lifetaps are resistible!&quot; &quot;Yeah, well, i&#39;m in charge of ROGUES!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAradune quiets them all with a sharp wave of his hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I have already repaired the problem. The new wizard teleport point is <br/>\ndirectly<br/>\nbetween the legs of Innoruuk. We&#39;ll keep it that way for a few days until <br/>\npeople<br/>\ntire of losing their corpses, then we&#39;ll try to fix the mistakes made by the <br/>\nOne<br/>\nwho is No More.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe engineers left the room slowly. Each of them felt as if they had aged 10<br/>\nyears in the few hours they had been in the room. They each swore to<br/>\nthemselves that they would never repeat the mistake that Thomas had, for <br/>\nthey<br/>\nfeared the wraith of Aradune.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhats everyone else think?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
