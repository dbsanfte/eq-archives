Simply right-clicking the poison applies it to the weapon in the <br/>\nprimary melee slot.  Right clicking a weapon in the secondary slot on top <br/>\nof the poison still poisons the primary weapon slot.  Basically, Verant <br/>\nthrew in the step of right clicking the weapon to make people think they <br/>\nwrote more code than they actually did :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;The only thing that works by right-clicking one item over another is rogue<br/>\n&gt;poisoning, but I don&#39;t think you can really use the word &#39;works&#39; in<br/>\n&gt;connection with that.
