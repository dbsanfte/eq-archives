Others&#39; <br/>\nresults may vary, but no one has reported such yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nHit level 16.  Yay you get to tinker and learn right?  No.  You won&#39;t learn <br/>\na thing.  The skill is at 50 and won&#39;t move.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 17:  Okay, you get to have real tinkering enjoyment.  You get to gain <br/>\none whole point.  So, skill is now at 51.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next level I tried anything was 27.  I was able to train my tinkering up <br/>\nto 60, then it stopped.  I may be off a level here, but the pattern of <br/>\n1pt/level seems to have held up to here.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 28:  This is where it got frustrating for me.  I plunked about 500pp <br/>\nmaking nothing but flamesless lanterns.  My skill went up 5 points rather <br/>\nquickly (within 20-30 lanterns), then stopped for the other 400 or so <br/>\nlanterns.  Is there a pattern here?  Maybe.  I haven&#39;t tried since I ran out <br/>\nof money once after hitting 74 in the skill.  But, at other points where I <br/>\nlevelled, I would learn 5 points pretty quick, then spend a few hours not <br/>\nlearning anything.  I don&#39;t know if you are limited to 5 pts/level after 27.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you really need to be in your mid to upper 20&#39;s before trying to <br/>\nlearn the skill in any real manner, at least in my short experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhenglei Kai of Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
