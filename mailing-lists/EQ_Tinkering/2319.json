My<br/>\n&gt; guildmate Eltanin was asking my advice on his enchanter quest.  After<br/>\n&gt; looking at the quest text (you: Where is the mechancial pen.  NPC: the<br/>\n&gt; answer is in your question), I came up with the an idea that the location<br/>\n&gt; was hidden as an anagram within the word Mechanical Pen.  It looked<br/>\n&gt; promising as Paineel was the only zone with all it&#39;s letters in Mechanical<br/>\n&gt; Pen.  With the remaining letters, I came up with Mc&#39;Chanl or Mc&#39;Nulch,<br/>\n&gt; thinking a barbarian had the pen.  However, this was just a theory and not<br/>\n&gt; a fact!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My theory was proved wrong as the actual quest is finished by giving a SMR<br/>\n&gt; &lt;gasp&gt; to the chanter NPC in the Mines of Malfucntion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So if anyone tells you that the mechanical pen is in Paineel, please<br/>\n&gt; correct them!  Thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, I highly doubt that this item is tinkerable since it&#39;s part of the<br/>\n&gt; FA type quests for chanters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; QdP - who is completely amazed how a theory turned into an assumed fact<br/>\n&gt; overnight hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Quasinom de Plume is my quasi nom-de-plume&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Everque@...\">Everque@...</a> wrote: &gt; Mechanical Pen<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyone heard of a recipe for such a device?
