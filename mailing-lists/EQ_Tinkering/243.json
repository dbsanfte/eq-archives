I DO know what I&#39;m talking about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Borxx lens has nothing to do with the telescope quest.<br/>\n&gt;The telescope lens has nothing to do with the staff quest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;They are completely different. Just because there is a lens involved DOES <br/>\n&gt;not mean that they are related. One is a lens made of biological material <br/>\n&gt;that is gotten off of an evil eye named Borxx, if I&#39;m not mistaken.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The others are 4 telescope lenses made of glass, probably made by the <br/>\n&gt;gnomes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A piece of glass for a telescope lens couldn&#39;t be substituted with a lens <br/>\n&gt;from a living things eye, just as the lens of an eye could not be <br/>\n&gt;substituted with a glass lens (and no contacts only assist is correcting <br/>\n&gt;your vision problems which are caused by the actual eye lens). That is all <br/>\n&gt;there is two it -- end of story. The two quests are completely seperate and <br/>\n&gt;have absolutely nothing to do with each other. So if you want to talk about <br/>\n&gt;how to get the Staff of the Observers, then maybe you should subscribe to a <br/>\n&gt;mailing list that is interested in it. This is a tinkering list, so unless <br/>\n&gt;you have some kind of evidence that The Staff is involed in a tinkering <br/>\n&gt;quest, then lets drop it, ok?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sniffledoo Copperheart. 14th rank warrior of The Gemchopper Hall --<br/>\n&gt;Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Are you?
