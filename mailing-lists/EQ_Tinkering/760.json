He doesn&#39;t seem to want to tell me out-right, but <br/>\nhe was willing to tell me a little more, sort of. First of all, he confirmed <br/>\nthat the thing I was looking for truly WAS a third tinkering book. He also <br/>\nsaid that to get it involed going under water. He also said that it was <br/>\nsomewhere you wouldn&#39;t expact it to be. He also said that is was NOT in <br/>\nAk&#39;Anon, that looking there was a waste of time. He also confirmed that it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t is Kedge&#39;s Keep. He said that the person to first find it stummbled <br/>\nupon it by luck, so if we are actually looking for it we should be able to <br/>\nfind it. Lindell also told me if I find the book, I can join The Mark. Well, <br/>\nsorry, I don&#39;t want to join those people, they are with holding info from <br/>\neveryone else like that, so if I find it, I&#39;m gonigto let everyone know <br/>\nabout it, not join they&#39;re group. They want to keep it secret, but I have <br/>\nabsolutely NO affiliation to them, and don&#39;t want to keep it secrect, so why <br/>\nwould I want to join them? First of all, they won&#39;t let me join because I&#39;m <br/>\nnot worthy to them, plus if they had their way, I, or no one else would find <br/>\nthat book ever, and they would probably do anything in their power to stop <br/>\nme from getting it, and they sort of have, but then, if I found it, since <br/>\nthey still want to keep it secret, they want me to join them, even after <br/>\nwhat they&#39;ve acted like?! No way! I don&#39;t think so!<br/>\n<br/>\nHahaha! Let&#39;s show them! Let&#39;s all re-double our efforts to find the book!!! <br/>\nCome on, guys! Let&#39;s go get it! Good luck to you all!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
