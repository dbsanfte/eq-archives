Specimens ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-501315808\">THE MINERAL DUFRENITE<br/>\n<br/>\nChemistry: Fe5(PO4)3(OH)5 - 2H2O, Hydrated Iron Phosphate Hydroxide. <br/>\nClass: Phosphates <br/>\nUses: Only as mineral specimens. <br/>\nSpecimens <br/>\nDufrenite is a classic phosphate mineral. It is known from classic<br/>\nlocalities in Devon, England and elsewhere. Often associated with other rare<br/>\nminerals, dufrenite specimens can easily be a collectors favorite. Although<br/>\nnot particularly colorful unless fresh, dufrenite&#39;s muted yellowish-brown<br/>\ncolor is none-the-less unique and distinctive. In fact, it produces a nice<br/>\nbackdrop to the more colorful minerals that may be attached to the rounded<br/>\nbotryoidal landscape. <br/>\n<br/>\nPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS:<br/>\nColor is yellowish-green or olive when fresh but turns brown when oxidized. <br/>\nLuster is varied from vitreous or silky to dull or earthy. <br/>\nTransparency: Specimens are translucent to transparent. <br/>\nCrystal System is monoclinic; 2/m <br/>\nCrystal Habits include botryoidal and globular masses or tabular crystals.<br/>\nAlso found in radiating clusters and crusts. <br/>\nCleavage is perfect in two directions. <br/>\nFracture is uneven. <br/>\nHardness is 3.5 - 4.5 <br/>\nSpecific Gravity is approximately 3.1 - 3.3 (slightly above average). <br/>\nStreak is yellow-green. <br/>\nAssociated Minerals include hureaulite, laubmannite, kidwellite, quartz,<br/>\nlimonite and rockbridgeite. <br/>\nNotable Occurrences include Cornwall, England; Westphalia, Germany; Anglar,<br/>\nFrance and Cherokee County, Alabama, USA. <br/>\nBest Field Indicators are crystal habit, color, associations and streak. <br/>\n<br/>\n=========================================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven this information - that Dufrenite has nothing whatsoever to do with<br/>\nDiamond, it would make perfect Verant-sense to have Dufrenite dust be used<br/>\nin a recipe that calls for diamond dust...<br/>\n<br/>\nLOL!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-hax<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Ken Jordan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kjordan@...\">kjordan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pretty sure it&#39;s Dufrenite.... that&#39;s the stuff used for the <br/>\n&gt; Totemic armor<br/>\n&gt; quests for Shamans in Lake Rathe.  Well it&#39;s cheaper than <br/>\n&gt; tring to crush a<br/>\n&gt; diamond I guess ;&gt;  Anyone got the skill to try it ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Darkadvent - Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt; From: Alex Shimanovsky &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:10815@...\">10815@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well I got really frastarated I tell ya looken for that <br/>\n&gt; Diamond Dust and<br/>\n&gt; Tattred Gnomish Cloak.<br/>\n&gt; so I petitioned, and the GM told me it was a Verant GM too, <br/>\n&gt; he told me that<br/>\n&gt; I should try Crushed Dauphire (not sure about spelling) <br/>\n&gt; instead of Diamond<br/>\n&gt; Dust. Also about tattred Gnomish Cloak, he said it DOES exist <br/>\n&gt; in the game<br/>\n&gt; but wont tell me if it is human made or not .<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
