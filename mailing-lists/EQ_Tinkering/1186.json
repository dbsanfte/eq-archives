On the Test server<br/>\nin Ak&#39;anon there is a new merchant by the big cascading waterfall next to a<br/>\nmechanic (the water area between the cleric/rouge house and the tunnel to<br/>\nthe water wheel area).  He is selling the XI book (aka Colapsable Fishing<br/>\nPole Book) and the XXXIII book (aka the aqualung and rebreather book)  He<br/>\nalso has a few other tinker components on him.  I have both books now.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have time to get the new book and post it on the web,  But I am sure<br/>\nwith this info, Gnomad will have it on his page shortly.  CURRENTLY, THE NEW<br/>\nTINKERING ITEMS CAN ONLY BE MADE ON THE TEST SERVER.  So, stop wasting your<br/>\ncash/time on finding items.  All the items needed for the tinkering items<br/>\nare in the windmills and the new merchant.  Also, some strange items like a<br/>\nmedium sized plate helmut and a &quot;live Fish&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Tinkering guys =)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Keeg<br/>\n-Keeganex Gemchopper<br/>\nThe Erudin Arcanium<br/>\nCazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
