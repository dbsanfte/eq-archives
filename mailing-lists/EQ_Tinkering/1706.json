According to Allakhazam&#39;s site, he spawns<br/>\nnear/on the stone bridge between north and south karana, on the north<br/>\nKarana side and gives you a quest to kill Tiny Skeletons. I&#39;ve never been<br/>\nable to find him, probably due ot the sheer number of powergaming weenies<br/>\nthat are KoS to gemchoppers from killing gnome guards, so he probably<br/>\ndoesnt last too long once he pops. Has anyone managed to complete this<br/>\nquest yet? Is he always there unless someone kills him, or does he only<br/>\nspawn at certain times of the day... I&#39;m hoping the later, cos it really<br/>\nbugs me when people kill quest creatures - I still remember when I was<br/>\nyoung and I could only do the report quests after a server reboot, becasue<br/>\nthe guard killers would often kill Joogl Doobraugh as well, and he has a<br/>\nreally long spawn time..</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
