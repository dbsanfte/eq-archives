I already got Duster V.<br/>\n<br/>\nThx<br/>\n<br/>\nCountt<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI can confrim this as I completed the duster quest last night and got the<br/>\nBootstrutters Pack (Isn&#39;t the Gnome who gives you the Jboots quest named<br/>\nBootstrutter?  Heh - anyone try giving him his pack back?  Just an idea).<br/>\n<br/>\nThese junk items that you talk about - I&#39;ve never seen them before.<br/>\nGnomish Glow Rods?  Perhaps these are the rods needed for the thermal<br/>\ncloak...  I just received a patchwork cloak after completing the Red V<br/>\nquest - I&#39;ll try to do the Duster and scrap metal quests a few more times<br/>\nto get these Rods and try a few combinations.<br/>\n<br/>\nQdP<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Quasinom de Plume is my quasi nom-de-plume&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Duster V is still a rare spawn around the enterence.<br/>\n &gt; Duster X now only spawns once you turn in the report, he spawns down by<br/>\n &gt; the<br/>\n &gt; tinkering merchant, and doesnt wander anymore, he just stands in place.<br/>\n &gt; I did this quest once (and am waiting for Duster V to do it again) and<br/>\n &gt; got the<br/>\n &gt; Bootstrutters Pack, 10slot backpack with 10% weight reduction..<br/>\n &gt; A lot of the junk that you used to get for this quest (back when Dustre<br/>\n &gt; X was a<br/>\n &gt; wandering rare spawn) can now also be gotten by turning in scrap metal<br/>\n &gt; from<br/>\n &gt; rogues to Sanfryd Feathertop (who used to be called Sanfryd<br/>\n &gt; somethingelse).<br/>\n &gt; Amongst the normal lanterns/shield junk you can also get gnomish glow<br/>\n &gt; rods, and<br/>\n &gt; chunks of metal ore that look like balls instead of bricks...<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Getting the duster report seems to be less common than it used to be as<br/>\n &gt; well - I<br/>\n &gt; get the Red V report a lot more now, previously it was the other way<br/>\n &gt; around..<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
