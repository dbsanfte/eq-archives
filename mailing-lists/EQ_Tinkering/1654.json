However the reason why the guy is lvl 100 (not to mention all<br/>\nhis other stats are huge) is that his emulator allowed him to edit his<br/>\ncharacter and give him any item (In the same way a GM can summon any item<br/>\nin the game).  Now I&#39;m willing to believe that gun exists as a graphic in<br/>\nthe game - but that we would never be able to tinker it and that it would<br/>\nbe used more-so for a special GM event.  Perhaps one lucky player in the<br/>\nfuture will have this item but I can not imagine it will be widely<br/>\navailable.  I could be wrong though - heh wouldn&#39;t be the first time. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nQdP<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Axehandler@...\">Axehandler@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As posted by another user here, they pointed to the website...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://n.ethz.ch/student/brunoh/download/poorguy.jpg\">http://n.ethz.ch/student/brunoh/download/poorguy.jpg</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and used the gun in the picture as a refrence, since looking at the pic<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; site, you 1st notice the guy is lvl 100... umm YEA..
