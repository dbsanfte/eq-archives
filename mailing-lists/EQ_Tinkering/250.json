That is the best news I&#39;ve heard in awhile on this mailing list, but I <br/>\nthink that Verant has been forggeting something.<br/>\nThey are about to patch the test server for the third! time in a row.<br/>\nAlas they have not even patched the real game with the &quot;warrior patch&quot;<br/>\nas it&#39;s called, which is the patch with the warrior improvements that they <br/>\npatched onto the test server when they implemented the RW server codes into <br/>\nthe Test server. It just seems fishy that they only care about patching the <br/>\ntest server now, doesn&#39;t it to you?<br/>\n<br/>\nSniffledoo Copperheart. 14th rank warrior of the Gemchopper Hall -- Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
