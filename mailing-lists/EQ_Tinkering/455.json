You usually find out this information from other NPC.  But it is<br/>\nquite common.  So it is possible there may be some question you have to ask<br/>\nJogl like &quot;what is a collapsable fishing pole?&quot; or some such thing and they he<br/>\nwill ask you to bring him a few items (like the jum jum quest) and then he will<br/>\ngive you the pole.  If someone is truely making the poles, then I think this is<br/>\nhow it is being done.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for faction mattering.  I know of very few quests that need a faction better<br/>\nthen dubious (which NPC will usually not talk to you if you are dubious, so<br/>\nthis suprised me.  But since I am dubious with almost all of Norrath,<br/>\nindifferent to some, and my pet considers me kindly (I didn&#39;t know other NPC<br/>\ncould do so also).  It is pretty unlikely that your faction has to be that<br/>\nhigh.  Especially for a quest that involves multiple classes.  For the vast<br/>\nmajority the quests that involve faction being high are quests designed for a<br/>\nsingle class to complete.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTony Buser wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Tony Buser&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gr0k@...\">gr0k@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jogle doesn&#39;t say anything different to me.
