I was pretty excited.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut... I&#39;m amazed at this thing. It sorta sucks.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. you have to wear it. So all those melee&#39;rs with fancy helms have<br/>\n to wear this stupid 1 AC rebreather instead. (They&#39;ll love that)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. It weighs 10. I know this has been lamented before, but there goes<br/>\n  the monk market.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Fishbone earring gives +3 dex.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, still the fishbone earrings are much more desirable (hate to say it).<br/>\nPersonally, I want an aqualung more than this, at least it sits in my<br/>\ninventory slot.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
