You must bring 4 pieces of stacked scrap metal to<br/>\nSynford, (sp?) the NPC gnome who resides opposite the entrance to the<br/>\nmines of malfunction.  You can get the scrap metal from the two different<br/>\nvarieties of clockworks that are located near the mills (north and east<br/>\nfrom mills to be exact).  Red V also drops scrap metal occasionally but he<br/>\nis a much rarer spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few notes on this quest:<br/>\n<br/>\nI recommend obtaining a dimensional pocket or spirit pouch as each piece<br/>\nof scrap metal weighs 7.5 - very heavy indeed considering you need at<br/>\nleast 4 of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scrap metal is NOT no-drop so you can buy it from any player hunting<br/>\nthe clockworks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen hunting the clockworks, it&#39;s a good idea to pick up the rusty black<br/>\nboxes as well.  You can turn in two at a time to Manik for chump change,<br/>\nminute exp and faction.  Although you might not think that&#39;s a big deal,<br/>\nbut one of the faction increases is with merchants of ak&#39;anon - same with<br/>\nscrap metal quest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs of this moment I&#39;ve completed the quest about 20 times and still<br/>\nhaven&#39;t received the trash compactor nor the gnomish glow rod (another<br/>\npossible reward according to Alakhazam&#39;s).  Question to those who have the<br/>\nrod - are the rods lore?  If not, could they be the rods that need to be<br/>\nsewn in the tattered cloak to make the thermal cloak?  Just an idea... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only odd reward I&#39;ve received so far (mostly get rusty weapons) is an<br/>\nitem that looks like hematite but apparently is some kind of ore - I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever seen ore that looks like this and I have no idea what it&#39;s for<br/>\n(however I&#39;m not a blacksmith and perhaps it is just a common piece).<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nQdP  <br/>\nMith Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Quasinom de Plume is my quasi nom-de-plume&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Rala AmaranthineFuhrer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rala_eq@...\">rala_eq@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; where is the compactor at?
