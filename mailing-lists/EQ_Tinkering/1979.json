Smiths post, it could be that you have to use a finished<br/>\npiece of jewelry, then maybe it could be jewelry, grease, cutter, (possibly<br/>\na pattern).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always wandered why the jewelry bag had four slots, and this seems<br/>\nlike the best reason I have seen yet.  Also, it&#39;s been a long time, but I<br/>\ncan almost swear that I once saw a scroll or parchment being sold by a<br/>\nmerchant that was titled bear pattern.  Maybe I&#39;m imagining it, or maybe it<br/>\nwas for something else, who knows. I would like to see a good listing of<br/>\ntried attempts.
