Gnomad himself made a spyglass, and he used a collapsible <br/>\nfishing pole that was given to him from a GM quest in steamfont. He knows <br/>\nthe formula and it&#39;s posted on his webpage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Reading this, a thought occured to me. I wouldn&#39;t put it past Verant to <br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt;made a way to make spyglasses without collapsible fishing poles. Then, they <br/>\n&gt;will<br/>\n&gt;change that &quot;bug&quot; once collapsible fishing poles can be made by players. If <br/>\n&gt;this<br/>\n&gt;is true, the person selling spyglasses really can&#39;t tell us how to make<br/>\n&gt;collapsible fishing poles because he doesn&#39;t know. He&#39;s just making<br/>\n&gt;spyglasses... he could be lying about making collapsible fishing poles to <br/>\n&gt;throw<br/>\n&gt;us off. I&#39;m not saying somebody would do that, but he IS trying to keep a<br/>\n&gt;monopoly on the market, and I can&#39;t say I blame him with the money he&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;making.<br/>\n&gt;All I&#39;m really trying to say is we&#39;re probably assuming too much. The <br/>\n&gt;brewers<br/>\n&gt;went through something similar with bog juice awhile back. Nobody knew it <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;EVERYBODY was trying to figure out the recipe. Once the recipe was found<br/>\n&gt;(actually, it got posted by a GM), it was nothing like anybody had been <br/>\n&gt;trying.<br/>\n&gt;People were using yeast, malt, hops, and barley in a drink that requires <br/>\n&gt;nothing<br/>\n&gt;more than snake scales and water. Collapsible fishing poles, if they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt;possible<br/>\n&gt;to begin with, could be made with a rod, a pine needle, and a gear for all <br/>\n&gt;we<br/>\n&gt;know. Hell, for all we know, a rod, a pine needle, and a gear makes the<br/>\n&gt;spyglass!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n&gt;  Trade Council GM </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
