There is gnome located underneath the water<br/>\nin everfrost.  It was once rumored that this was a necromancer city, but<br/>\nto the best of my knowledge this is false.  There are some skeletons<br/>\naround him, but I really don&#39;t know what he says or what he drops if you<br/>\nkill him.<br/>\n<br/>\nBig Dave wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  On the third book:I know a gnome on my server (Fennin Ro) named<br/>\n&gt; Renten I think, that was utterly obsessed with finding the third<br/>\n&gt; book.  He said he found clues that led him to Permafrost where he had<br/>\n&gt; been searching for the past several days (and he was level 8 at the<br/>\n&gt; time).  I&#39;m convinced he is on to something, nobody in their right<br/>\n&gt; mind would risk that kind of venture without good reason.  However, I<br/>\n&gt; have not heard anything from him in several weeks, he may have given<br/>\n&gt; up or lost his level many times, I don&#39;t know.  But I&#39;m going back<br/>\n&gt; there to do some more exporing myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--Eron<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aeron@...\">aeron@...</a><br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom The Simpsons:<br/>\n<br/>\nMulder:  There&#39;s been another unsubstantiated UFO sighting in the<br/>\nheartland of America.
