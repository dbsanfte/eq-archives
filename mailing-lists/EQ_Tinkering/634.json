A<br/>\n&gt;nice balance of attribute increases for both WIS and INT will help you out<br/>\n&gt;quite a bit.

Also see if you can get one of the +15 charisma &#39;crude steins&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the bouncer in feerot. Having a charisma of 86 instead of 60 makes a ton<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; difference cash wise while you are doing all this tinkering.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also realize that you can NOT gain more than 1 point in tinkering<br/>\n&gt; &gt; until<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you get to *21*. You are stuck at 51 until then and I forget what your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; max<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is per level.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Note, your milage may vary, but the first thing one should try to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tinker<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to gain skill is the flameless lanterns. I would usually do about 20 at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time and it would cost somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 30 plat to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (after selling the lanterns back) depending on your success rate and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; charisma. Sometimes I would gain nothing, sometimes 4 or 5 points, its<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; random. On average I would say I gained about a point per 20 lanterns<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; means I approximately spent about 20 to 30 plat per point up to 68 where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lanterns get trivial.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; YES, you CAN make some cash selling the cams to bowers. While nothing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; write home about you can make some fairly decent pocket change. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; started<br/>\n&gt; &gt; making cams at 68 (when lanterns became trivial) and my success rate was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; too bad. I could sell the cams for 25 plat to bowers, where they would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; usually spend about 40 plat. They are usually VERY happy to find a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tinker<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that can make cams...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gaining skill gets a bit more expensive here since each attempt cost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; maybe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 12 to 15 plat. But as with the lanterns I figure I would gain about a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; point<br/>\n&gt; &gt; every 20 cams or so, which means you really need to find a place to sell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your cams to support your tinkering habit. I was able to get my skill up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 75 making cams.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And thats where my story ends, without the fishing pole/telescope to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; practice on tinkering has no future for me short of making a bit of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pocket<br/>\n&gt; &gt; change on cams. Damn those verant bastards, I still get an unexeptable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of failure on cams even though they are trivial. =|<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope this helps, if there does exist a kind soul willing to share the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fishing pole recipe I would be eternally grateful.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; FizzWizz of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 35 Wizard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;__________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Bid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 6<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 14 Sep 1999 19:49:23 EDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Clanof1@...\">Clanof1@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Animated Fishing Bait<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I HAVE BEEN AWAY A WHILE, WHAT INGREDIENTS FOR ANIMATED BAIT?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 7<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 15 Sep 1999 01:37:20 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lukas@...\">lukas@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Tattered Cloaks!!?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any vendor that sells large seweing kits now sells the &#39;rare&#39; patterns.<br/>\n&gt;One of the huts right outside Ak&#39;anon has one of these merchants.

I&#39;m pretty sure I got<br/>\n&gt;my first point on making cams, too bad back then those were the non-working<br/>\n&gt;cams, a lot of platinum was flushed trying to make a bow with them.  A<br/>\n&gt;level 50 warrior on my server made some attempts at the stalking probes<br/>\n&gt;with 50 skill, not a lot of successes but did get a skill increase after<br/>\n&gt;just a couple.  Might be a possible solution for the &#39;hundreds of plat on<br/>\n&gt;lanterns & no skill&#39;...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My tinkering skill raise story is pretty much the same as Fizzwiz&#39;. About a<br/>\n&gt;20pp per point average for me on the lanterns as well.  As he said,<br/>\n&gt;sometimes 2 or 3 points per round, sometimes none at all.  Then I made cams<br/>\n&gt;from about 65 to the trivial at 75.  Never got a skill increase off the<br/>\n&gt;mechanized lockpicks but they turned trivial around 67-68.

They are usually VERY happy to find a tinker<br/>\n&gt;that can make cams...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Gaining skill gets a bit more expensive here since each attempt cost <br/>\n&gt;maybe<br/>\n&gt;12 to 15 plat. But as with the lanterns I figure I would gain about a point<br/>\n&gt;every 20 cams or so, which means you really need to find a place to sell<br/>\n&gt;your cams to support your tinkering habit. I was able to get my skill up to<br/>\n&gt;75 making cams.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 9<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 15 Sep 1999 06:40:18 EDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Clanof1@...\">Clanof1@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: My experience getting Tinkering to 75 ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;um, you cant make the spyglass anyways, how would yo know if its trivial?<br/>\n&gt;dont you need that fishing pole.  if not id like the magic formula<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 10<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 15 Sep 1999 03:57:13 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;    From: trond ivar hansen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zafigomchic@...\">zafigomchic@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: The gnome spelunker IN UNREST<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Down in the caves is the necroguild.
