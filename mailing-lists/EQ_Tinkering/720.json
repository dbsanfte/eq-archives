As a matter of fact I got a bunch of people from my guild and<br/>\nwe all got enduring breath and we scoured every inch of that water and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t come up with anything!  :(  Though we all mastered swimming.  (I&#39;m at<br/>\n116 now) It was kinda fun actually.  Beats sitting and waiting for the the<br/>\nnext spawn to hack and slash.  I just hope it&#39;s not down in that kedge keep<br/>\nplace.  But why on earth would they put information to find such basic<br/>\ntinering knowledge on how to make a fishing pole in such a dangerous place<br/>\nlike that.  I mean the book of wu (contains tailoring info for the hard to<br/>\nmake cured silk and stuff) can be found on a lvl 20 orc in lesser feydark.<br/>\nThat thing is simple to get.  Does anyone else know of any other trade books<br/>\nthat are gotten off a monster or some other way other then buying off a<br/>\nmerchant?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I did find was a swimming guide!  heh never saw that before.<br/>\nThere was a Guide V swimming around down there around the king&#39;s palace.<br/>\nHailed her, but just gave the standard guide response.<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t find any coin.

If you swim down far enough you hit... NOTHING!  I<br/>\neven<br/>\n&gt; scraped the walls to see if I could find a secret room, nothing.  Anywho.<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; scanned all of Ak&#39;anon today underwater (145 swimming currently).  Didn&#39;t<br/>\nsee<br/>\n&gt; anything cool to note.  Scanned for about an hour or so.
