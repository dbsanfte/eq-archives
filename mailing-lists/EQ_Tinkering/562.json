We got people who make arrogant comments and then the <br/>\n&gt;people<br/>\n&gt;who are even dumber are the people who fill up ur mailbox with complaints<br/>\n&gt;about one single email and turn it into a big event or something.  I wanted<br/>\n&gt;to share knowledge about tinkering and be taught knowledge but this list<br/>\n&gt;keeps going in circles.  If you are sending something that you would not <br/>\n&gt;want<br/>\n&gt;in ur mailbox then ur just messed up.  Think about it as if someone was<br/>\n&gt;sending YOU an email that said &quot;screw that&quot; and that&#39;s it.  It would piss <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;off.  And it has pissed me off.  So I am leaving this list until the people<br/>\n&gt;on it can learn to respect the power over other peoples mailboxes that they<br/>\n&gt;have.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Holy paladin of the 20th season.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rojer Wilco<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hahahah.
