It&#39;s a pity that they are trivial, but made em anyway.<br/>\nMade a set of the fireworks and was kinda disappointed in their graphic.<br/>\nI&#39;m sure that they&#39;ll patch em now that we know how to make them.  Anywho, I<br/>\nteleported back to South Karana&#39;s and began to auction my wares.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nalways charged 5X whatever something sells back to the vendors.  I tried<br/>\nselling my pole back to a vendor &lt;who was apprehensive to me&gt; and he would<br/>\ngive me 4 plat for it.  So I charged 20plat.   Think it costs roughly 5-6<br/>\nplat to make depending on your faction.  And take in consideration of<br/>\nfailures and 20pp seems fair to me, especially considering the travel<br/>\ninvolved.  Shall we be agreed on what to charge for this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAlso, one character came up to me and demanded the recipe.<br/>\nBah on him.  Another came up begging.  So I played the guessing game with<br/>\nhim till he got it right. :-)  I will willingly share, but some people are<br/>\nawfully demanding.   Just so nice to finally be able to make something.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
