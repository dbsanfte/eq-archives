I&#39;ve gotten a few regular<br/>\ncustomers, and at least once a week I get an order for<br/>\nsome.  Sometimes it&#39;s 4, sometimes it&#39;s 8, but it&#39;s<br/>\nconsistent.  I sell them for 20 each, and it costs me<br/>\nabout 12 to make them.  You may call this &quot;gouging&quot;<br/>\nbut I&#39;m still saving them 13 plat per cam (lowest I&#39;ve<br/>\never seen cams in stores was 33 plat).<br/>\n<br/>\nAqualungs...  they just piss me off.  I made 10 in 24<br/>\nattempts last night, and spent 5k plat.  Raised up 5<br/>\npoints with an INT of 168.  That&#39;s just sad, 1000 plat<br/>\nper skill point raise and under 50% success rate,<br/>\nthose numbers are worse than platinum jewel crafting. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll 10 of them were bugged (if you trade them, they<br/>\ndrop to 1 charge).  So I have to get the GM to come<br/>\nfix them everytime I sell them.  I think she&#39;ll be<br/>\nbugging the crap out of the development team since she<br/>\nknows how much I tinker a lot and she&#39;ll get tired of<br/>\nhearing from me =)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck my fellow gnomes, and I hope we&#39;re all<br/>\npraying for diamond dust for Christmas!<br/>\n<br/>\nGazamel Prime<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\nMaster Tinker<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
