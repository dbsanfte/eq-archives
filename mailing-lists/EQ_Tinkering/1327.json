Besides I would<br/>\n&gt; think that any high<br/>\n&gt; level people that wanted to camp cauldronbubble or<br/>\n&gt; the king in Kedge would<br/>\n&gt; really be interested in these for a few reasons.<br/>\n&gt; 1. No need for someone to break out of combat to<br/>\n&gt; start recasting enduring<br/>\n&gt; breath on the entire party.  Ive been to kedge a few<br/>\n&gt; times now, its a pain<br/>\n&gt; unless you have multiple persons that can cast EB.<br/>\n&gt; 2.  Remember most of your EB casters also have to<br/>\n&gt; memorize the stamina<br/>\n&gt; spells.  an Aqualung just freed up one of your spell<br/>\n&gt; slots.  Humm should I<br/>\n&gt; memorize the evac or the enduring breath? :)<br/>\n&gt; 3.  Ok so 50 fishscales don&#39;t really take up that<br/>\n&gt; much weight, and its only<br/>\n&gt; 3 stacks of stuff.  But thats 2 extra stacks that<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t going to be<br/>\n&gt; holding loot.  And its also 1,750 mana saved, not<br/>\n&gt; including fizzels, which<br/>\n&gt; are not possible with the aqualung.<br/>\n&gt; 4. Mermaids and seahorses can cast dispell magic. <br/>\n&gt; Sure that just means the<br/>\n&gt; Druid, Shamen, or Enchanter needs to recast EB on<br/>\n&gt; someone in a hurry.  Or<br/>\n&gt; they could just click off a charge from the aqualung<br/>\n&gt; and keep on trucking.<br/>\n&gt; Not many fighters are going to have their mind<br/>\n&gt; firmly on the battle at hand<br/>\n&gt; if they start running on the air left in their<br/>\n&gt; lungs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thats all I could come up with off the top of my<br/>\n&gt; head.  As was mentioned in<br/>\n&gt; another post, its all how you sell them.  I am<br/>\n&gt; getting better at it, and I<br/>\n&gt; do offer any persons that purchass an aqualung from<br/>\n&gt; me, 50% of their money<br/>\n&gt; back if they trade in their aqualung for a<br/>\n&gt; rebreather once I am able to<br/>\n&gt; make them.  No matter how many charges are<br/>\n&gt; remaining.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Heh on a side note, if I had been selling<br/>\n&gt; rebreathers, I was offered a<br/>\n&gt; Yeksha for one till they learned it was the charged<br/>\n&gt; version. :)  I added<br/>\n&gt; that name to my friends list for when I am crafting<br/>\n&gt; rebreathers. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lomack, BCK-MoR<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;sorry my friend but for 700 plat anyone can<br/>\n&gt; purchase 50 enduring breath<br/>\n&gt; potions<br/>\n&gt; &gt;i dont really see why anyone would pay that UNLESS<br/>\n&gt; as stated earlier we<br/>\n&gt; provide<br/>\n&gt; &gt;an upgrade to rebreather for a viable cost. i agree<br/>\n&gt; with an earlier post <br/>\n&gt; &gt;wherein<br/>\n&gt; &gt;we gig anyone who wont purchase the aqualung but<br/>\n&gt; wants a rebreather and cut <br/>\n&gt; &gt;some<br/>\n&gt; &gt;slack to those who purchase both. this isnt really<br/>\n&gt; a prob for me as im only <br/>\n&gt; &gt;in it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to equip my guild and have full backing from them.<br/>\n&gt; just an opinion and glad <br/>\n&gt; &gt;to hear<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the level cap is going to get fixed. you wouldnt<br/>\n&gt; believe the amount of cash <br/>\n&gt; &gt;i wasted<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of the guild treasury trying to raise my skill.<br/>\n&gt; well see you all in game.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Derkal Pentolite, Eme&#39;ef Aitch Wizard, The Rathe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
