That idiotic pathetic excuse for a human<br/>\nbeing Lindell really was on the tinkering list all along. The freak said (at <br/>\nleast he said) that he was leading me along all along. He&#39;s probably just <br/>\nsome pathetic kid starved for attention. He knows nothing, I bet, he must <br/>\njust be a sad abused person in need of mental help dearly. There was no Mark <br/>\nI bet, like I said, that little whelp that doesn&#39;t even deserve the breath <br/>\nthat he breaths is just a big evil liar. Sorry guys.<br/>\nIt seems we can almost trust no one on the list now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;If there was a third book, it would seem logical that it would have<br/>\n&gt;recipies for things in it other than a collapsable fishing pole.  So why<br/>\n&gt;aren&#39;t we seeing more tinkered items besides this pole come out of that<br/>\n&gt;book?  Unless all the other formulas in it are broken.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I suspect this is a wild goose chase, and someone, somewhere is having a<br/>\n&gt;good laugh at our expense.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rotgut </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
