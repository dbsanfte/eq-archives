Plus the high-level magi&#39;s will<br/>\nsoon be able to summon water stones that have 2 charges.  An aqualung<br/>\nshould have ten charges at least.  That way, an adventurer who paid the<br/>\nhigh price would be able to spend a reasonable amount of time in Kedge<br/>\nKeep and probably make enough to get his investmet back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really hope that the one charge was a fluke or else we will never be<br/>\nable to sell them. &lt;sigh&gt;  Heh - however it will be a long time before I<br/>\nget to the level where I could even try Tinkering them.  This level cap<br/>\nseems a little harsh if you ask me.  If we can&#39;t gain past 50 in tinkering<br/>\nuntil lvl 25-26, why would they state that we can start increasing our<br/>\ntinkering skill at 16th?  In ten levels we can gain one point?  What a web<br/>\nof deception Verrant likes to weave.  Verrant:&quot;Yeah sure we&#39;ll give you an<br/>\naqualung &lt;snicker&gt;.... Good luck trying to sell it. BaHahahaha.&quot;  Well,<br/>\nhopefully the Rebreather is much better although somehow I doubt it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe our saving grace will be in the Gem Cutter?  Verrant: &quot;Hehe - can&#39;t<br/>\nwait to see their faces when they find out we gave them another recycled<br/>\nability at a price no one would ever pay. Bahahahaha.  We&#39;ll have to<br/>\ncreate a few new animated emotes /distraught, /broke and nothing to show<br/>\nfor it, /disappointed, /embarassed, /tinkered (new expression combining<br/>\nall the above emotes) Bahahaha.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHeh - I know I&#39;m sounding a little negative and tinkering does have a few<br/>\nneat elements to it but I feal like tinkering is evolving more like a<br/>\nnovelty skill (like cooking and pottery) then an actual trade skill (like<br/>\njewelcraft and smithing).<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I could roleplay a &quot;sloppy&quot; tinkerer who pays more attention to<br/>\nhis booze then details but I&#39;d rather not...<br/>\n<br/>\nQdP<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo levels away from the &quot;real&quot; tinkering level.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Quasinom de Plume is my quasi nom-de-plume&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:daniel.larsson@...\">daniel.larsson@...</a>-ohmeda.com wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You still consume oxygen, so you need to refill those oxygen tubes now<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; then...<br/>\n&gt; It would make sense if you somehow could recharge these things though...<br/>\n&gt; few ppl<br/>\n&gt; would buy aqua lungs for any reasonably profit bringing price if they<br/>\n&gt; last only<br/>\n&gt; 1 charge.
