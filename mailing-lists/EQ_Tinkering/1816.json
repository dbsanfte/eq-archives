It mentioned somethin bout a clockwork<br/>\n&gt;dragon, now the dragon, I don&#39;t believe, not by a longhshot. But it also<br/>\n&gt;mentioned one of those lamp, star light post things, and when ya click it, <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;makes a door opening sound and turns 90 degrees. I thought that it was <br/>\n&gt;worth<br/>\n&gt;2 seconds investigation, so I found the one that wasn&#39;t soinning next to <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;lake. I clicked it, and sure enough, it turned bout 90 degrees, and I heard<br/>\n&gt;the door creak. I have no idea what this is about, knowing my luck, this<br/>\n&gt;little topic has popped up on the list before, but I&#39;m a recent addition to<br/>\n&gt;it. If it has, GOOD! someone please fill me in and quench my curiosity. If <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;hasn&#39;t, anyone have any ideas what it is, cause who knows, what if it has<br/>\n&gt;valid importance, this is a long shot, but it may have somethin to with<br/>\n&gt;diamond dust. I know I know, there&#39;s a bunch of you thinking I&#39;m prime full<br/>\n&gt;of it, but about the little door creak and star lamp thing, I&#39;m not, I <br/>\n&gt;invite<br/>\n&gt;you to see it yourself. Anyways, I jus thought I&#39;d toss that one out there.<br/>\n&gt;If it&#39;s been brought up before, forgive me for my insolence.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yigoron,<br/>\n&gt;30 Magician,<br/>\n&gt;Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
