I spent about<br/>\n60pp after selling back everything I made and raised my skill from 50 to 58.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the skill cap is indeed (lvl * 5) - 13 (thanks Diabloklr) I have quite a<br/>\nway to go before my lvl 18 gnome wiz hits 77.  Time to make some moola!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I did learn last night.  Tinkering rocks!  I love it.  I have<br/>\nnever had so much fun with a trade skill.  There are all kinds of things to<br/>\nmake.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, last night people asked to buy a spyglass, cams, and a compass from me<br/>\nwhen they heard I was trying to tinker.  So there is a market for some of<br/>\nthis stuff even though the market may be small.<br/>\n<br/>\nWopr &lt;Valiant Souls&gt;<br/>\ngnome wizard<br/>\nBertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
