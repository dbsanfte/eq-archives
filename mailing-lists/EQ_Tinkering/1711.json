He<br/>\n&gt; says he was sent to the<br/>\n&gt; Karanas to Kill some undead Brownies, and return<br/>\n&gt; their remains to Akannon.<br/>\n&gt; He gives you a 4 slot Box which is No Drop i belive.<br/>\n&gt;  Last i heard this<br/>\n&gt; quest was broken because the Tiny skelitens you<br/>\n&gt; recive when you kill the<br/>\n&gt; undead brownies are NO DROP, so getting 4 of them<br/>\n&gt; and filling the box is<br/>\n&gt; not possible.  He also says he is in a hurry and<br/>\n&gt; gives you a deadline for<br/>\n&gt; returning the full box to him.  I dont think anyone<br/>\n&gt; is killing him when he<br/>\n&gt; spawns , just that he is rare and only spawns a<br/>\n&gt; certain times and then goes<br/>\n&gt; away again.   hope this helps.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rexus Maximus,   Veeshan.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 10:20 AM 12/29/99 +1300, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbuckingham@...\">jbuckingham@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Watchman Drexlin - this is a new quest, where one<br/>\n&gt; of the guys the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Gemchoppers hall who previously never said anything<br/>\n&gt; now directs you to find<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Watchman Drexlin near Qeynos. According to<br/>\n&gt; Allakhazam&#39;s site, he spawns<br/>\n&gt; &gt;near/on the stone bridge between north and south<br/>\n&gt; karana, on the north<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Karana side and gives you a quest to kill Tiny<br/>\n&gt; Skeletons. I&#39;ve never been<br/>\n&gt; &gt;able to find him, probably due ot the sheer number<br/>\n&gt; of powergaming weenies<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that are KoS to gemchoppers from killing gnome<br/>\n&gt; guards, so he probably<br/>\n&gt; &gt;doesnt last too long once he pops. Has anyone<br/>\n&gt; managed to complete this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;quest yet? Is he always there unless someone kills<br/>\n&gt; him, or does he only<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spawn at certain times of the day... I&#39;m hoping the<br/>\n&gt; later, cos it really<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bugs me when people kill quest creatures - I still<br/>\n&gt; remember when I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;young and I could only do the report quests after a<br/>\n&gt; server reboot, becasue<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the guard killers would often kill Joogl Doobraugh<br/>\n&gt; as well, and he has a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;really long spawn time..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
