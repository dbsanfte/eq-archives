The entire reason guard killers don&#39;t loot the plat is because <br/>\nthey don&#39;t need it...while that&#39;s ok for them. But &quot;newbies&quot; shouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nable to gain plat so easily. At level 5, it takes about 30 minutes to earn a <br/>\nplat, but with guard killing it takes 5 seconds to earn 4 plat. . .<br/>\nJust my opinion.<br/>\nCorey</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
