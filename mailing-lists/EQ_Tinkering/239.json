It has NOTHING to do with the telescope lens quest, hence the difference- Evil eye lens VS. Telescope lens... And a note on someone elses post: the telescope quest does NOT give the observer staff when completed.. that is without a doubt factual information+ACE- The only quest that is rewarded with the observer staff is the Borxx quest given by the female enchanter way out behind the windmills in one of the houses. And yet another side note: on my server the observer staff is and has been bugged for some time... it is supposed to have 50 charges of Sentinal, which it does when first recieved but after you log and come back on, it is reduced to one charge. I was told not to use the charge and that it will be fixed, but that was over a month ago. :)<br/>\nWes Lobdell,<br/>\nQuote: +ACI-The certain proof that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe <br/>\nis that no one has bothered to make contact with us.+ACI-<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Nosferatu nosferatu+AEA-mn.mediaone.net<br/>\nTo: EQ+AF8-Tinkering+AEA-onelist.com EQ+AF8-Tinkering+AEA-onelist.com<br/>\nDate: Friday, July 23, 1999 1:08 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: +AFs-EQ+AF8-Tinkering+AF0- Lets find Bidl Frugin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Nosferatu nosferatu+AEA-mn.mediaone.net<br/>\n<br/>\nhmm, pretty sure Borxx&#39;s lens is one of them, you re supposed to get one<br/>\n+AD4AIg-free+ACI- (the one in LF I believe) than one is one the gnome taken<br/>\nprisoner by Minotaurs, and one was stolen by a dark elf, and the only<br/>\nother lens I have heard about is the Borxx lens (at least this is what<br/>\nthey respond when asked about spare lens&#39;s)<br/>\n Maybe I missed one, if so please tell me which one.<br/>\n/Nosferatu<br/>\n<br/>\nmstokes wrote:<br/>\n+AD4APg- <br/>\n+AD4APg- From: mstokes mstokes+AEA-tddny.fujitsu.com<br/>\n+AD4APg- <br/>\n+AD4APg- While I agree that Verant is sick +ACY- twisted, you are confusing two quests.  The Evil<br/>\n+AD4APg- Eye is part of the Observer Staff Quest and originates at an Observitory.  The<br/>\n+AD4APg- Telescope Lens Quest orignates in the Wizards? Guild and it requires you to get four<br/>\n+AD4APg- lenses.  None of them are on Borxx.  Two are given to you by the observitories.  One<br/>\n+AD4APg- is obtained by killing a 14ish (and nasty) DE in Freeport, and the last is on this<br/>\n+AD4APg- missing gnome.  Please also note that this quest will not be given to wizards above<br/>\n+AD4APg- level 12.<br/>\n+AD4APg- <br/>\n+AD4APg-  Believe it , verant has this sick and twisted thing about making quests<br/>\n+AD4APg-  ungettable at higher levels, and impossible for low levels to actually<br/>\n+AD4APg-  solve, for instance this quest. one of the lens you need tog et from<br/>\n+AD4APg-  Borxx, a level +ACo-30+ACo- Evil Eye.
