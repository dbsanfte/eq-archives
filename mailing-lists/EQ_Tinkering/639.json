Last night, I reached level 27 with my<br/>\nwizard and sat down to make flameless lanterns.  I started out at skill 50.<br/>\nAbout 120 lanterns later, I get to 51.  About 40-50 lanterns later, I get to<br/>\n60.  Then I called it quits and started again this morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSEVEN hours later my skill has not budged.  I made approximately 360<br/>\nattempts at lanterns (costing around 600pp after selling them back) and<br/>\ngaining nothing but a sore disposition.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, here is the conclusion that I came up with:  I have only been able to<br/>\ntrain my skill up to 10 past what it started, which is the same as the<br/>\nnumber of levels I have achieved since being able to gain tinkering skill in<br/>\nthe first place.  Yeah, 16 is when it says in the guild you get the skill,<br/>\nbut you really can&#39;t increase it til 17.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I need to hear from everyone is what level they are and what their<br/>\ntinkering level is at.. I really don&#39;t want to have to level repeatedly just<br/>\nto get decent at tinker.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhenglei Kai -- Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
