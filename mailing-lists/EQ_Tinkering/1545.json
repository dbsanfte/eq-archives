Duster V is a fairly common<br/>\nspawn and travels from the front gate to the throne room.  Duster X (and<br/>\ndo not mistake this with Cleaner X - you will take a faction hit if you<br/>\nkill this one) is a much rarer spawn (heh I&#39;ve seen it once only) and<br/>\nspawns back near the mines of malfuntion by the water wheel, although it<br/>\napparently will travel to the little islands in the lake.  Usually a<br/>\nclockwork scrubber will spawn in it&#39;s place and will stay there for<br/>\nseveral hours.  You could try killing the scrubber to get it to spawn but<br/>\nyou will take faction hits for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you return the two scrap metal pieces, you will receive the<br/>\nBullsmasher, which is a decent teen-lvl weapon.  I can&#39;t remeber the stats<br/>\noff-hand but the weapon is for small races only and adds +2 to 3 stats if<br/>\nI&#39;m not mistaken.<br/>\n<br/>\nQdP<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Gazamel Prime &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gazamel@...\">gazamel@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ok, this may be another wild goose chase, but I poked<br/>\n&gt; around some in Ak&#39;Anon, and I talked to everyone I<br/>\n&gt; could find about diamond dust. Only one NPC responded<br/>\n&gt; to my queries, and it seemed kind of related. He told<br/>\n&gt; me that I needed to kill &quot;clockwork dusters&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; return their remains to him since they&#39;re obsolete.<br/>\n&gt; This NPC is just across the water near the Mines of<br/>\n&gt; Malfunction. I looked all over for these dusters, but<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t find any, all I found were scrubbers,<br/>\n&gt; cleaners, and sweepers. If you happen to come across<br/>\n&gt; any, let me know how it turns out!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Keep up the good work, and someone PLEASE find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; diamond dust :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sandortien, 50th gnome wizard of Xegony<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Thousands of Stores.
