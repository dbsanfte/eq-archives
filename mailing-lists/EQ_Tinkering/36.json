You mean I can tinker WITHOUT having to<br/>\nbe level 16??!?!??!<br/>\n<br/>\n--- corenee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:corenee@...\">corenee@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: corenee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:corenee@...\">corenee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; first i would like to say ya&#39;ll are doin a great<br/>\n&gt; thing here. Here&#39;s what<br/>\n&gt; i have heard, there are three other books(besides<br/>\n&gt; the two at mills)<br/>\n&gt; where or when you get em is beyond me. I too have<br/>\n&gt; made the firewater,<br/>\n&gt; and the lantern, and say one person auctioning off<br/>\n&gt; the cams for the<br/>\n&gt; bows, so i know those have been made also. As has<br/>\n&gt; already been posted i<br/>\n&gt; too heard that the infravision goggles instructions<br/>\n&gt; came from a quest.<br/>\n&gt; Which one i don&#39;t know. Also i know as a fact that<br/>\n&gt; you can tinker<br/>\n&gt; successfully at level 1, but cannot gain any skill<br/>\n&gt; level til level 16.<br/>\n&gt; So all of you that are waiting to try it, go for<br/>\n&gt; it...it will work, i<br/>\n&gt; decided to try it at level 11 with my gnome, and<br/>\n&gt; made fire water on<br/>\n&gt; first try. Also i believe that you can make the<br/>\n&gt; thermal cloak from just<br/>\n&gt; about any cloak...doesn&#39;t have to be tattered... I<br/>\n&gt; am wanting to try<br/>\n&gt; similar things with lanterns ans stuff..(i.e. use<br/>\n&gt; small lantern and<br/>\n&gt; such). If anyone has tried it with other items<br/>\n&gt; please let me know.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Jaqui(math marr)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Congratulations to &quot;INDIE-GRRL,&quot; our latest ONElist<br/>\n&gt; of the Week.  <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is<br/>\n&gt; changing YOUR life!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
