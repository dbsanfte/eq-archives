Returning the head resulted in a thank you, and<br/>\nsome minor coin.  Also created a mule Ogre, with a friend, turned in like 20 guild notes,<br/>\ngave the mule the head (It was NOT no drop like the compendium).   Same reward.  I also<br/>\nrecieved an E-Mail from the person in charge of quests (I can look up his address if you<br/>\nwant it)  He told us (EQ-Brewers) to try the quest after the next patch, &quot;but I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow if the results will be what you expect&quot;  We did, we recieved the compendium then the<br/>\nStien.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Minor Correction here.  The Glowing Stien was NOT part of the game until less than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1 week before the spoiler went up.  It was the reward for the Brewers Compendium<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Quest.  The quest, until recently, was broken.  It returned Pungala&#39;s head (Ogre<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Head), not the compendium.  Many bartender&#39;s have tried this quest, and it was a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bartender who first completed it.   On a side note,  GM&#39;s informed several players<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that the quest indeed worked, before the patch.  They then came back and said it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will be fixed in an up coming patch (Another Lie)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No the quest always worked, the problem was that no one had used all the proper spells<br/>\n&gt; on the Ogre to raise the faction high enough.  That is why an enchanter was required<br/>\n&gt; to do the quest, which was the part that the general population of norrath didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; figure out until a week before the last patch. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
