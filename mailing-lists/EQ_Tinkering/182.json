I did not have the money to buy one, so I do not know if they were<br/>\n&gt;sold by a player, or always offered by the merchant. If they were sold by a<br/>\n&gt;player, then they probably come from the orcs near there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 2<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Mon, 12 Jul 1999 15:19:42 -0400<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: MadGrizzle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MadGrizzle@...\">MadGrizzle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Thermal Cloak<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Which quest gives out the tattered cloak as a reward?  I heard the newbie<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gnome warrior Red V  provides them sometimes (unfortunately I got rawhide<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shoulderpads when I did it).  Then I heard of a felwithe quest.
