At level <br/>\n27 I was only able to raise tinkering to 60.  The skill does not take dozens <br/>\nand dozens of attempts to raise.  If it doesn&#39;t go up after 20, it isn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing up til you level.  So far, it seems that you can only learn one point <br/>\nper level til 28, then 5 points per level after that.  I am level 30 now, <br/>\nand I will try to get past 75 to see if one can gain more than 5 points per <br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhenglei -- Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
