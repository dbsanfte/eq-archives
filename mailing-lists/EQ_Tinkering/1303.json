Well I decided ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-78747151\">Hi all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been a member of this list for some time now, just waiting, reading,<br/>\nand hoping for the day that tinkering would become useful.  Well I decided<br/>\nwhen these aqualungs and rebreathers came out to give it a shot.  Here is<br/>\nmy story<br/>\n<br/>\nDay 1: Invested 750plat into tinkering and got to 75 skill<br/>\nDay 2: Invested another 750plat and got to 85 skill.<br/>\nDay 3: Invested 1400plat and got my skill to 102.<br/>\nDay 3: Invested 1000plat in aqualungs, 4 attempts, 2 successes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs updated information for the website<br/>\nThe spyglass trivilas at 101.  it wasn&#39;t trivial at 100 (I checked)<br/>\nThe Stalking Probes Trivial out at 102.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless the Gemcutter comes through somehow (assuming someone finds out<br/>\nwhere diamond dust can be found, only aqualungs can raise my skill any further.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t sold any yet, but I am hopeing to get between 600 and 750 plat<br/>\nfor them.  I don&#39;t see much of a market for them as Shamen, Druids, and<br/>\nEnchanters all can cast the Enduring Breath spell.<br/>\nJust as a note of the 3900plat I have spent, a good chunk of it came from<br/>\nmembers of my guild.  Even at level 42 I just don&#39;t have this kind of money<br/>\nkicking around.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the help of friendly enchanters and a Crude Stine I try to get the<br/>\nbest prices.  Current Relavent stats are<br/>\nWisdom: 88<br/>\nIntiligence: 187<br/>\nCharisma: 75 (87-110) (buffed)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had truely known it was going to be this expensive, I may not have<br/>\nstarted the task, but once I took the first donation from my guildmates I<br/>\nhad no choice but to continue.  So if anyone wants aqualungs on Fennin Ro,<br/>\njust look me up.  I am shooting for 750pp each to the public, but if you<br/>\ntell me you read it here I will go as low as 600.  With a 50% succes rate I<br/>\njust can&#39;t go any lower and still hope to break try to break even.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
