I make them for about<br/>\n&gt;3pp, better now with my +17 charisma gear I have, and sell them for 5pp<br/>\n&gt;each.  This is the auction line I have found works the best:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Selling TINKERED compass, 5pp, great if you have poor sense heading, 100%<br/>\n&gt;success rate, don&#39;t be fooled by cheap knock-off imports, buy direct from<br/>\n&gt;the artisan, support the trades!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think the last bit &quot;support the trades&quot; helps a bit since I have sold 2<br/>\n&gt;to people with good sense heading but buy trade items just to provide <br/>\n&gt;support.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have sold only 10 so far, so I guess I&#39;ve made 20pp, not much, but better<br/>\n&gt;than losing money.  Just sucks that you don&#39;t get experience from them. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
