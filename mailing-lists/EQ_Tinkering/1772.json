( if he is a lvl 25<br/>\nench he could not get very far into paw.)<br/>\n- Maybe, it would make sense of a rare spawn farrie or somthing like that.<br/>\n- Maybe that flying horse drops it ( i never killed it but I seen it once<br/>\nat lvl 35)<br/>\n- Grizzelnot (??) I would guess a lvl 25 enchancer can kill him , I did at<br/>\nlvl 25, he is sometimes low lvl, and he does go thru paw, his pathing.<br/>\n- maybe an aviak ?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso a clue if he (/ooc What is Diamond dust?) in SK, he probobly got it in<br/>\nSK. so I dont think it may have been any zones that are close to SK. <br/>\n( At least now we know where to look )<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso , to get more info out of that guy even if we dont play on F-Ro maybe<br/>\nwe should creat a mule char and bug the sht out of that guy.<br/>\n<br/>\njust make a char then go /anon so he does not see your lvl. and start<br/>\nbugging him.<br/>\n<br/>\nalso maybe he will reveal the location for some good cash ?<br/>\n<br/>\nhe is lvl 25, those guys can be bought out easly.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
