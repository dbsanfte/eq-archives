Make it a Mechanical Pet<br/>\nthat serves that function of &quot;Cargo Lifting&quot; or whatnot. So Mobs won&#39;t<br/>\nattack the pet, it won&#39;t defend / fight for you. AND when you have this<br/>\nCargo Pet active, you get DOUBLE your normal weight allowance for inventory<br/>\n/ carrying stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat way it can&#39;t be used as a combat advantage since it won&#39;t  fight/ be<br/>\nfought. AND since it&#39;s using a pet slot for any normal pet classes, they<br/>\nwould be sacrificing a regular pet just to have this one and lug around<br/>\nextra stuff. I think it balances nicely.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would STILL disappear when you zone/LD... which would put you WAY over<br/>\nweight limit next time you got back in.. unlesss you had another you could<br/>\n&quot;deploy&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell? What do you folks think? Seems to me it&#39;s:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.) Balanced<br/>\n2.) Usefull<br/>\n3.) It would look DAMN cool having a mechanical Ogre following you around =)<br/>\n<br/>\nTuni Gearspinner/Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
