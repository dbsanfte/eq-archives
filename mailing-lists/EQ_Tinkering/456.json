The Glowing Stien was NOT part of the game until less than<br/>\n1 week before the spoiler went up.  It was the reward for the Brewers Compendium<br/>\nQuest.  The quest, until recently, was broken.  It returned Pungala&#39;s head (Ogre<br/>\nHead), not the compendium.  Many bartender&#39;s have tried this quest, and it was a<br/>\nbartender who first completed it.   On a side note,  GM&#39;s informed several players<br/>\nthat the quest indeed worked, before the patch.  They then came back and said it<br/>\nwill be fixed in an up coming patch (Another Lie)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thought #5:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There is no such thing as a &quot;secret&quot; on Everquest.  There are too many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people playing the game, making any new discovery part of the common<br/>\n&gt; &gt; knowledge base within a few weeks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Fact&gt; This is pretty true for the most part, but the glowing stein was a part<br/>\n&gt; of the game from beta on, and it wasn&#39;t until 2 or 3 weeks ago that this became<br/>\n&gt; common knowledge.  Verant also reports that less than 50% of the total different<br/>\n&gt; items in the game have been found.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
