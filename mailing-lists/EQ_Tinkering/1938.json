Tried picking up the chopper and right clicking over a perl and nothing happened. Tried manipulating it several other ways with no results.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of you guys have any other &#39;non-destructive&#39; ideas for the gems chopper let me know and I&#39;ll try them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I made the chopper, I gave GM &#39;NYXX&#39; of Tunare a buzz and out right asked him if the gem chopper is a functional item at the moment or should I wait for another patch. He told me, &quot;I dont think that it is functional right now&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow admittedly a GM&#39;s word is not neccesarily law, but this is proof enough for me to wait for a future patch before we start destroying more gemcutters.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;How many gems can ya chop if gemchopper dont chop gems?&quot;   bah...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nFizzWizz<br/>\nJaded Master Tinker of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
