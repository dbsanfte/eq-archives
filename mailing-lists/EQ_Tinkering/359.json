You say that there is a <br/>\ncertain amout of items that we can use to make it, what are you saying? <br/>\nThats it&#39;s 13? Let&#39;s just say we decided that only 4 slots are used to make <br/>\nit, even then, you can&#39;t make any acurate calculation of the amount of <br/>\ncombinations there are, I mean, I dout we will be using grease, sprockets, <br/>\ngnomish bolts, and gears to be making the fishing pole. We probably have to <br/>\nhave some kind of rod or shaft too, and with your calulations, you are <br/>\ninluding various of those useless combinations, that we can probably guess <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t make the pole. You are just going to have to face the fact that we <br/>\njust have to keep trying, or find some alternate way of learning the recipe, <br/>\nso no amount of calculations are going to help us much unless you aply them <br/>\nin a practical way, so you should stop wasting your time.

I&#39;m new to the list, just signed up <br/>\n&gt;&gt;today.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Anyway this is a question for any mathematic wizards out there.  We have<br/>\n&gt;&gt;a total of 8 slots in the toolbox and a total of 12 items to use.  Does<br/>\n&gt;&gt;anyone know how many combinations that we can come up with?  Remember that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;this includes just having 1 item in the box or 2 or 3 etc. etc.  Well me<br/>\n&gt;&gt;personally I would just like to know for curiousity sake.  And don&#39;t worry<br/>\n&gt;&gt;you now have another helping hand in the search for the collapsable <br/>\n&gt;&gt;fishing<br/>\n&gt;&gt;pole recipie. :)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Mike<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; P.S.
