I thought they just shot random colors.  And yes it was a terrible<br/>\nlet down.  hehe that guy that posted earlier about having a tinkerer&#39;s<br/>\nmeeting and fireing his one and only firework would have been a pretty<br/>\npathetic finale.  :)  I made a bunch and was handing them out to people for<br/>\nfree outside ak&#39;anon.  And everyone that took one, fired it and then asked<br/>\nme &quot;How do you use it?  I right clicked on it and didn&#39;t see anything&quot;.<br/>\nEvery single person said that.  hehe I told them don&#39;t blink or you&#39;ll miss<br/>\nit.  lol<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthought I did make a couple collapsable fishing poles! (3 metal rods, 1<br/>\ngnomish bolts)  And I even made a spyglass after 3 attempts.  All in all,<br/>\nI&#39;m a happy gnome for the first time in a while.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\ngr0k - Stranger in a Strange Land - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juju.org\">http://www.juju.org</a><br/>\n&quot;Linux... find out what you&#39;ve been missing while<br/>\nyou&#39;ve been rebooting Windows NT&quot; - Infoworld<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: David &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mymail@...\">mymail@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just made a bunch of sets of gnomish fireworks...The recipe is<br/>\n&gt; Firewater (1)<br/>\n&gt; Bat Wing (1)<br/>\n&gt; Metal Shaft (1).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  This costs around a gold to make and produces 4 separate fireworks.<br/>\n&gt; They differ in that each one has a different effect (Fireworks1,<br/>\n&gt; Fireworks2, Fireworks3, Fireworks4).   Unfortunately the effect of each<br/>\n&gt; one is horrible!  They might be broken, but as of right now they do<br/>\n&gt; nothing but send a TINY colored flame straight out from your body and<br/>\n&gt; lasts about a tenth of a second at best.  The difference between the 4<br/>\n&gt; types seems to be color of the flame. That is IF you even catch a<br/>\n&gt; glimpse of the flame (if you blink you will miss it).  About the only<br/>\n&gt; good thing I can say about them is that Im glad they cost me next to<br/>\n&gt; nothing to make, since for now they seem to be a complete waste.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hope this was an isolated experience and that other people have more<br/>\n&gt; luck than I do with them. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
