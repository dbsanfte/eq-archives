I did find a<br/>\n&gt;place where you can swim behind the wall out in front of the mines where <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;Necro guild is, but I drowned and had to call a gm to get my corpse out.<br/>\n&gt;Maybe I&#39;ll see if I can find someone to cast endureing breath so I can<br/>\n&gt;search in there more fully.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
