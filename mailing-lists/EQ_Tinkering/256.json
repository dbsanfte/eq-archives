Anyhow, on to the good stuff.  I have put over 200p into Tinkering (i&#39;m a lvl 22 magician), creating flameless lanterns.  That&#39;s INCLUDING the $$ i get back from selling them.  I have yet to raise a skill level..=(  This makes me wonder if I will get through 1000p and still not raise it a point.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the quest for the lenses.  I have tried it myself, and have had little success.  First of all I ask the gnome right outside akanon, and he tells me i&#39;m too experienced.  The one in Fay says that I have to come back in two weeks.  I am not high enough to kill either of them and take the lens.  I got the third lens from the DE in freeport, I killed her (she was blue dangerous).  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I would not stop there, so I went back to steamfont, and tried to discover WHO the gnomes would actually give the lens to.  Well, I tried lvl 4 magician, lvl 7 wizard, lvl 8 wizard, lvl 11 magician.  They all were told to come back two weeks later.  Then i tried a lvl 13 Wizard, who was told he was too experienced!  Argh!  If any of you have gotten the lens from them, what class/lvl where you?  Unfortunately I cannot kill either of the gnomes, neither do I want to, as it would ruin my standing with my own race.  Any advice?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn one last note, hoping that since Bidl Frufrun was being fixed during last test server, that he will be repaired for this patch.  Not sure if he&#39;ll be in Steamfont as he is supposed to be, or if he&#39;ll be in The Fayder&#39;s as the Guide mentioned earlier.  I may just go runnin Steamfont/Fay&#39;s offering a reward for anyone who can find Bidl....heh.  Anyhow, hope this all helps, and would like some help myself!<br/>\n<br/>\nXalastile<br/>\nLvl 22 Magician<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
