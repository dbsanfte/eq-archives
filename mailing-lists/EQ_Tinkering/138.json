It costs a bit over 3pp to make (I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t failed yet..knock on wood).  I&#39;m currently selling for 5 pp, most <br/>\npeople who want one have no problem paying the 5 pp.  I have found some <br/>\npeople who will only pay 4pp, to whom I tell to come back to me when you <br/>\nget a bit more frustrated hitting sense heading.  However, I do manage to <br/>\nsell one, maybe two a day.  I here that you can buy compasses from gypsies <br/>\nin North Karana but I haven&#39;t made the trip to check it out (last time I <br/>\nwas there i got mauled by a grif).  I also heard you could get them in <br/>\nKithicor forest but I went through all the shops and didn&#39;t find any.  I&#39;ll <br/>\ngo to the gypsies and check them out then head to lavastorm to see if they <br/>\nhave them also.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
