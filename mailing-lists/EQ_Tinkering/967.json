This is<br/>\nevident by the many items that where removed, statements from Lead GM&#39;s of<br/>\ncertain servers, and statements from several gnomes that during BETA<br/>\nactually saw the items and the books. at least Verant saw fit that they<br/>\nunbalanced the game, so they removed them. Second, many of the tinkerable<br/>\nitems where severly bugged, and do to the release schedule (which was<br/>\nhurried out the door in May) caused the work on these items to be diverted<br/>\non others.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the items where magicly charged items. In other words, the item was<br/>\nheld and then when clicked used a charge and casted the spell that was<br/>\nrelevant to the item.  For example; Gnomish Goggles are NOT permanent<br/>\ngoggles that you wear and can see at night, They are the level 16? Heat<br/>\nSight spell that has 5 charges. When right clicked the user uses a charge<br/>\nand has Heat sight for its standard duration.  Sorry to spoil it, but this<br/>\nis how ALL or most of the items worked.<br/>\nScouts; which are tinkerable now, are the level 8 Eye of Zomm spell with 5<br/>\ncharges, right clicking uses a charge and gives the user the Eye of Zomm<br/>\nview for its standard duration.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow some info from BETA: According to Eboo (or was it Dworkin?) whom ever it<br/>\nwas that worked with me and I&#39;m so sorry I forgot your name, but thanks for<br/>\nrepling to my cries, hehehe) a guild spent over 500 platinum on trying out<br/>\nthe different tinkerable items that where in the books. I can attest to<br/>\nthis, because I myself (a Wood Elf ranger that needed a compass but had no<br/>\nidea only gnomes could make them). Bought one of the books, and it had the<br/>\ninfo on collapsible fishing poles.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to these books, the following items could be made:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Firewater*+<br/>\nMechanical-<br/>\n-Compasses?*<br/>\n-Flameless Lanterns*+<br/>\n-Collapsible fishing poles<br/>\n-Mechanized Lockpicks*+<br/>\n-Cams*+<br/>\n-Thermal Cloaks?*<br/>\n-Gnomish Clockwork I (pet rat)<br/>\n-Gnomish Clockwork IV (pet spider)<br/>\n-Gnomish Clockwork XI (pet gnome male)<br/>\n<br/>\nMagicly &quot;charged&quot; items<br/>\n-Scouts (level 8 Eye of Zomm)*+<br/>\n-Spyglasses (level 8 Glimpse )?*<br/>\n-Gnomish Fireworks (level 8 Fingers of Fire)<br/>\n-Gnomish Goggles (level 16 Heat Sight)<br/>\n-Scuba Gear (Level ? Underwater Breathing)<br/>\n-Jet Pack (level 24 Levitate)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Steel Lined Silk armor?*<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ones marked with the (*) asterisks are remnants of the tinkering trade.<br/>\nThe ones with the (?) question mark are those that where also left, but are<br/>\nquestionable. Since many of the other components may have been removed,<br/>\nthese items have been destroyed and cannot be made. Those with a (+) plus<br/>\nsign are those I successfully made and sold throughout Greater Faydark and<br/>\nFreeport. The charged items can be used by any race/class. This supports the<br/>\ntheory that Verant removed them becuase of game inbalance.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
