There are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;probably<br/>\n&gt; &gt;no more than a couple of dozen serious tinkerers.  Heck gnomes<br/>\n&gt; &gt;themselves are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;very rare.

In the course of these events, they will eventually<br/>\n&gt; find something to do with tinkering.  No one specifically looks for new<br/>\n&gt; quests in hopes of getting a specific result.

It<br/>\njust may <br/>\nbe yet another book in some smithy shop that no one ever bothers to<br/>\ncheck out<br/>\nbecause we&#39;ve seen those same books many times.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; something new in hopes of profitting from it in some way.  These people<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t say &quot;let&#39;s find tinkering stuff today&quot;.  They say &quot;let&#39;s find<br/>\n&gt; something new tody&quot;.  So, I do not agree with your statement that only a<br/>\n&gt; tiny fraction of the world actively searches for things.  People stumble<br/>\n&gt; upon stuff, its just unfortunate that none of it has been about tinkering.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spyglass = useful?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Apparently wizards have a spell that does the same thing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wizards have a whole line of such spells, but others don&#39;t, so I believe<br/>\n&gt; that the spyglass is, at least, marginally useful.  The reasons are:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1.  No merchant or mob drop supplies similar items.<br/>\n&gt; 2.  Most people can&#39;t perform similar feats using their class     abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Spyglasses are apparently drops in solusek.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;As an aside, I heard from a post either here or on a WWW site that one<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;files contains the text aqua-lung.  Could this be another tinkering<br/>\n&gt; &gt;item?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;It certainly sounds so.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It could be anything, or something not implemented, etc.  There really isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; any reason to believe it is one thing or another.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Probably not implemented i agree.  But it doesn&#39;t sound like anything<br/>\nother<br/>\nthan a potential item to be tinkered.<br/>\n<br/>\n---ralph</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
