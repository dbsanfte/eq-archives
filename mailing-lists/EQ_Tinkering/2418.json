I lost one piece of<br/>\narmor out of the 26 failures.  The armor, I am getting fairly cheap, as I<br/>\ncan make it myself, although, I am actually buying it from a friend who is<br/>\nselling it to me at basically cost of materials with a small kickback for<br/>\nhis time.  (He has less failures than I do, being well over 200 smithing<br/>\nnow.)  To be completely honest with you, I am going back to rebreathers to<br/>\nraise the skill.  I did not gain a single skill point in the 26 failures,<br/>\nand average about one skill point per 6-8 rebreather attempts.  I figure<br/>\nthat at around 175, I will most likely start having a small amount of<br/>\nsuccess with the smaller armor pieces.  Although, I am going to attempt to<br/>\nmake a number of footwarming boots, and see how the success rates are.  Will<br/>\npost as I continue trying.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only components that I know of that do not stack are the velium lens&#39;<br/>\nfor the helms, and I am assuming that the vanishing devices required for the<br/>\nchestplate will not, but I believe that the components to make it do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had spent approx. 10 hours total to gather the components that I had,<br/>\nwhich included 10 sifaye dust, 12 globs of tar, 16 holgresh wings, 6<br/>\nholgresh fur, and 3 blocks of living granite.

Consumables are<br/>\n&gt; around 100pp.  The question is whether you will raise your skill from<br/>\n&gt; attempting armor.  Because the trivial point for the armor is higher than<br/>\n&gt; rebreathers, and you fail considerably on them, you will raise your skill<br/>\n&gt; at a slower rate than if you attempted the rebreathers.  Therefore, IF it<br/>\n&gt; takes 100 attempts to raise one point from making armor versus 10 attempts<br/>\n&gt; from making rebreathers (I&#39;ve averaged one point per 10 attempts in<br/>\n&gt; general), then it would be a wash besides the collection of the wings.  I<br/>\n&gt; would be surprised its this bad, so I guess maybe 20 attempts at armor<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; raise a point.  Therefore, each point would cost 2000pp plus 20 holgresh<br/>\n&gt; wings.  Versus 10000pp involved with rebreathers.  And who knows, you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; bound to get lucky once and actually make a piece of armor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My plan is to camp the holgresh and collect a load of wings and fur and<br/>\ntry<br/>\n&gt; to raise my skill that way.  Its currently 143, so I will finish out with<br/>\n&gt; aqualungs at first.  At least they sell back at 30pp below cost.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also another factor is time.  Think about how much money you have to carry<br/>\n&gt; with you from the bank if you want to attempt 10 rebreathers.  Thats<br/>\n&gt; 10kpp.  You can&#39;t move with that much money, you will have to attempt 3 or<br/>\n&gt; 4 rebreathers at a time max, then go back to the bank for more money.<br/>\nWith<br/>\n&gt; the armor, most all items are stackable, the heavy non stackable items<br/>\n&gt; being the armor... which you get back when you fail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 07:02 PM 12/20/2000 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This seems really sad.  The only thing to raise tinkering that high<br/>\n&gt; &gt;currently is rebreathers, correct?  Which means a ton of money.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;On the other hand, does any of the dropped items you need stack?  If<br/>\n&gt; &gt;so, it might be possible to carry over a nice supply of them to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Steamfont and keep making attempts at the Watchman armor.  If the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;plate is returned, then it might be cheaper than Rebreathers.  Can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;anyone confirm this?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Thanks, my tinkering is up to 128, so I know I have some work to do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and any help would be appreciated.  Now, I just have to find the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;funds.  hmm...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Norbert Gearsmith<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Gem Chopper on E&#39;Ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
