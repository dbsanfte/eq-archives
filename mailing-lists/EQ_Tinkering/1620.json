But Verant has recently either removed the skill<br/>\ncap or changed it. How do I know this? Because I have been level 30 for<br/>\nabout a month and a half now, and I have been tinkering a whole lot in that<br/>\ntime. I was stuck for the longest time at 75 skill. I don&#39;t just think I was<br/>\nstuck, I know I was because I made over 150 spyglasses after I was already<br/>\nat 75 skill and I didn&#39;t get a single skill point increase. I was selling<br/>\nthe spyglasses for between 70pp and 100pp and I sold over 150 of them,<br/>\nmaking me become one of the richest level 30 players I know. I didn&#39;t care<br/>\nmuch about the skill cap or being able to make aqualungs or even leveling, I<br/>\nwas raking in the dough and that was all that I cared about. Well last week<br/>\nwhile I was making more spyglasses to sell my skill level suddenly increased<br/>\nto 76 and I was completely astonished! I then proceeded to spend a few<br/>\nthousand platinum on spyglasses and stalking probes and a few painstaking<br/>\nhours later I was a master tinkerer. My skill is now 103 and I have<br/>\nattempted 6 aqualungs. I have made 3 out of those 6 attempts.<br/>\n  In my experience, I believe it is possible that tinkering MAY now be<br/>\ncapped at Level * 5 - 13 (maybe not), but it used to be capped at (level -<br/>\n15) * 5. I do know though that it is no longer capped at (level - 15) * 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrillian<br/>\n30 Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
