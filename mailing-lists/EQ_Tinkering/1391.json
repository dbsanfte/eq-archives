By this I mean, let&#39;s post and update Luke&#39;s eqportal site with the most up-to-date information we have.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, from the few aqualungs I have made, I can safely say that they are not trivial at 102.  Why don&#39;t we put that on the website?  &quot;&gt; 102&quot; or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know others have made many more aqualungs and attempted rebreathers...have you gained skill?  Are aqualungs still trivial at 103?  104?  How about rebreathers?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note, perhaps a list of ways NOT to get diamond dust would be useful?  As we eliminate rumors, add them to the list.  Not Oasis mummies, not LFay faerie guards.  We could list untested theories too.  Has anyone been brave enough to have the Rathe Mountains NPC crush a diamond yet?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the recipes for aqualungs, rebreathers, and gemcutters got dropped from the eqportal site when the level cap list was added.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I /bug&#39;d to have the aqualung fit in backpacks.  It is unreasonably difficult to use with it only fitting in large sewing kits and toolboxes (not to mention risking combine).  Perhaps we should have a minor campaign to /bug verant on this issue?<br/>\n<br/>\nFlintnilf Ironori<br/>\nGnome Wizard of the 37th circle of Solusek Ro<br/>\nLord of the Royal Casters, The Stone Cutters<br/>\nMaster Baker, Brewer, Potter, Smith, and Tinker<br/>\nPovar Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
