(not a new member)<br/>\n* I have never tinkered because it&#39;s broken, but keep hoping it&#39;ll be fixed.<br/>\n* I do not own a black helicopter.<br/>\n* I do not work for Verant.<br/>\n* I do not (knowingly) know anyone who does.<br/>\n* I do not need flamed (I&#39;m a wizard and can nuke myself thank you very<br/>\nmuch).<br/>\n<br/>\n===== Original Message from Me to CTC ======<br/>\n<br/>\nHail,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a question regarding the following Tinkering Equipment Item:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqcorner.com/equipment/items/gnomishfirework.htm\">http://www.eqcorner.com/equipment/items/gnomishfirework.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that the source of the image is anonymous.  I would like to<br/>\nclarify one thing if you know the answer or can ask the person who<br/>\ncontributed the image.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did they acquire the gnomish fireworks item:<br/>\n1) They created it in a toolbox via tinkering<br/>\n2) They were rewarded the item by a GM run dynamic quest<br/>\n3) They looted it off of a mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assure you that this image is going to cause a lot of stress among the<br/>\ntinkers.  Knowing whether it came from (1), (2), or (3) will reduce that<br/>\nstress greatly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is still residual stress from a collabsible fishing pole which was<br/>\nacquired<br/>\nthrough (2).  It launched a still ongoing crusade to find the recipe.  At<br/>\nfirst,<br/>\nmuch paranoid accusation surrounded the image.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess is that the gnomish fireworks also came from (2).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they came from (1), then I would ask whether the recipe was discovered<br/>\nby accident or from an in-game recipe.  I am not asking for the recipe<br/>\n(and not refusing it).  I simply want to know where the legions of tinkerers<br/>\nshould be looking to discover the answer on their own.   I.E. a hint.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny and all information I receive will be forwarded to the tinkering<br/>\none_list<br/>\nand to Lucas, admin of the tinkering website.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for any relief you can give the Tinkers of Norrath,<br/>\nFlintnilf Ironori<br/>\nGnomish Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n===== Original Message from Me to CTC ======<br/>\n<br/>\nNext time I see him I will ask him ... however the reason he asked to remain<br/>\nanon is because (he told me this, don&#39;t know how true or untrue it is): he<br/>\ndid in fact make both the fireworks and the fishing pole ... somehow knows<br/>\nthe secret to making them both.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll see if I can at least get him to tell me &quot;how&quot; he got the recipe .. but<br/>\nI know for a fact that he won&#39;t tell me how to make them :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kat :)<br/>\n<br/>\n===== Message from CTC to Me ======<br/>\n<br/>\nOkie ... I asked him last night in the game and he said that you can find<br/>\nthe recipes for both the fishing pole and fireworks within the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps ya :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kat<br/>\n<br/>\n===== Second Message from CTC to Me ======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kat,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you very much.  Well, it ends the theory that it was found through<br/>\n&gt; trial and error and it ends the theory that the recipe was leaked by a GM<br/>\n&gt; or some such.  It does help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m fowarding our email thread to the one_list now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Flintnilf<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>===== Third Message from CTC to Me ======<br/>\n<br/>\nNP .. just wish I could have gained more information for you.  He&#39;s very<br/>\nprotective of the recipes it seems ... I guess with somewhat good reason :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kat ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n===== End of Messages ======</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
