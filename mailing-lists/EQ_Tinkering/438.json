I hope someone dispels this thought, because <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;would make my year to please others with free fireworks shows.  Of course, <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;doubt the are implemented because the game engine wouldn&#39;t be able to <br/>\n&gt;handle<br/>\n&gt;that kind of complex graphics, without seriously taxing the client <br/>\n&gt;computer.<br/>\n&gt;  My 128meg RAM, 32meg video RAM computer still bogs down with lots of<br/>\n&gt;entities in view (players, mobs, corpses, etc), and fireworks would be an<br/>\n&gt;enormous amount of entities to deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Next time you load the game up to play.. and the splash screen comes up with <br/>\nthe EQ chick on it... Notice all those pics are probably from some early <br/>\nbeta or even alpha... Sky in Everfrost and Greater fay? The gnoll with the <br/>\nbow? Anyway... Look at the pic in the top middle.. I have a feeling this is <br/>\nwhat the gnomish fireworks were and what they look like. The fireworks <br/>\nprobably got taken out of the game just like the sky in Everfrost and <br/>\nGreater Fay did (go figure). So.. they would be just as CPU crunching as any <br/>\nspell that someone casts.<br/>\nJust some more silly meaningless info...<br/>\n<br/>\n-Catbik Tinkerton</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
