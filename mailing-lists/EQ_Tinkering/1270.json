I think verant is still riding their same old no class useless<br/>\nfanatic rage... thats why you see gate potions cost about 1000pp, just<br/>\nbecause all the whining wizards and druids (im a druid btw, and they whine<br/>\nALOT, and have nothing to whine about!) think that they will become useless<br/>\nin groups... So I think this is part of it, they dont want to make<br/>\ndruids/enchanters/necros/sks feel less important by making it easy to<br/>\nobtain, so then people will think hmmm why dont I just get a druid or ranger<br/>\nto cast enduring breath instead of wasting 1000pp on a rebreather. Its a big<br/>\ndamn game for verant (literally) so they gotta make it as &quot;hard&quot; as possible<br/>\n=(. Not to mention that they doomed their own player economy by their making<br/>\ntrade skills damn near worthless, and weve seen evidence of that,<br/>\njewelcrafters have to sell their items at insane prices because they fail<br/>\neven at 200 skill, so nobody buys them. 600pp for a BP ring... hmm maybe I<br/>\ncan just keep my dervish rings and get a shaman in the party (I know its a<br/>\nludicrous thought but apparently this is what brad mcquaid thinks). lemme<br/>\nknow what you guys think on this whole trade skill business.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoisoner/potter/smith/baker/tinker of veeshan.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
