Unfortunately the effect of each<br/>\none is horrible!  They might be broken, but as of right now they do<br/>\nnothing but send a TINY colored flame straight out from your body and<br/>\nlasts about a tenth of a second at best.  The difference between the 4<br/>\ntypes seems to be color of the flame. That is IF you even catch a<br/>\nglimpse of the flame (if you blink you will miss it).  About the only<br/>\ngood thing I can say about them is that Im glad they cost me next to<br/>\nnothing to make, since for now they seem to be a complete waste.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this was an isolated experience and that other people have more<br/>\nluck than I do with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFolimun Moonblaze - 24 Gnome Wizard - Brell Serilis</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
