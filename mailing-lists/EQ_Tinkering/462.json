The Glowing Stien was NOT part of the game until <br/>\n&gt;less than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1 week before the spoiler went up.  It was the reward for the Brewers <br/>\n&gt;Compendium<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Quest.  The quest, until recently, was broken.  It returned Pungala&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;head (Ogre<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Head), not the compendium.  Many bartender&#39;s have tried this quest, and <br/>\n&gt;it was a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bartender who first completed it.   On a side note,  GM&#39;s informed <br/>\n&gt;several players<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that the quest indeed worked, before the patch.  They then came back and <br/>\n&gt;said it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will be fixed in an up coming patch (Another Lie)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;No the quest always worked, the problem was that no one had used all the <br/>\n&gt;proper spells<br/>\n&gt;on the Ogre to raise the faction high enough.  That is why an enchanter was <br/>\n&gt;required<br/>\n&gt;to do the quest, which was the part that the general population of norrath <br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;figure out until a week before the last patch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--Eron<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aeron@...\">aeron@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
