She claimed to have a primary<br/>\ncharacter that<br/>\nwas a level 48 Gnome WIzard, who had an almost 200 Tinkering skill.<br/>\nAND she<br/>\nstated that it only cost her 400PP to get it up to 200 ! ! ! HOW in<br/>\nTHE HELL<br/>\nis this ACCOMPLISHED?! Am I the only person who thinks this number is<br/>\njust<br/>\nimpossible? 400pp barely covers the cost of 2 Aqualungs, much less<br/>\nCams and<br/>\nSpyglasses etc etc to get the skill 100... much less OVER 100 ! Has<br/>\nanyone<br/>\nelse run across a person making such FRIVILOUS claims?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually spoke with someone on the TM server who said something<br/>\nmuch along the same lines...that that they had gotten a first<br/>\ncharacter up to a very high skill at not a lot of expense.  THis was<br/>\na few months ago, and I wonder if the prices of the components have<br/>\nsimply risen a lot recently (or the trivial points changed).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWere the components for tinkering much lower priced (or even<br/>\navailable) last fall?  If so, then maybe these people could have<br/>\ngotten their skill up so cheaply.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI posted a message about this a few months ago, and didn&#39;t get any<br/>\nresponses, so figured that person was pulling my leg.<br/>\n<br/>\nLlabak Tharr of COR<br/>\nMaster Tinker (115)<br/>\nMaster Beggar<br/>\nMaster Brewer<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
