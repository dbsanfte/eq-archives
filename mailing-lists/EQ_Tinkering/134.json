Try buying them from him, at some<br/>\npoint they will dissappear.  NO NPC carries Pie Tins as part of their<br/>\nstock.

They sell<br/>\n&gt; for around 9gp each.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In GFaydark take the Orc Lift in Kethkin(sp?) up.<br/>\n&gt; Across one bridge or up one ramp (can&#39;t remember, need<br/>\n&gt; to go look again) there is an Inn.  The vendor in the<br/>\n&gt; Inn sells pie tins if you scroll down just a bit.  My<br/>\n&gt; wife (Mariposa) found this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In Freeport North, if you turn out of the bank and<br/>\n&gt; take an immediate left there is an un-named building<br/>\n&gt; with two women in it.  The woman on the right sells<br/>\n&gt; pie tins.  For about the same price.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Kryogen, Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist has 180,000 e-mail communities from which to choose!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
