No tinkering info though - you end up with a free<br/>\nElemental Grimoire (great quest for Magician&#39;s - will save you 11pp+). <br/>\nHowever, the wording is incorrect in the quest and might be a little<br/>\nconfusing to some.  Tergon asks you to bring back Toko Binlittle&#39;s<br/>\nspellbook (the renegade mage-turned-pirate).  Toko drops a Tier&#39;dal head<br/>\n(casting Identify on it reveals &quot;a cowardly dark elf head&quot;).  Perhaps the<br/>\nhead is hollowed out and he stores is scrolls in it &lt;g&gt;.  Anyways, take<br/>\nthat head back to Tergon and he will give you the Grimoire + the usual<br/>\nexp/faction bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note, I finished this quest without talking to the gnome in<br/>\nCrushbone - perhaps he might have more info on this tinkered &quot;shotgun&quot;.  I<br/>\nalso completed this quest quite some time ago and it may have been<br/>\nchanged.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuasinom de Plume<br/>\n{Mith Marr Server}<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Tony Buser &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gr0k@...\">gr0k@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Zach Heaven &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zheaven@...\">zheaven@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 05, 1999 11:45 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] Optional locations<br/>\n&gt; &gt; First I want someone to tell me what the gnome in the back of<br/>\n&gt; crushbone in<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pit is for?  I was there when I was in my teens, but have not returned<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what he did.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The gnome in crushbone is actually part of the Tergon&#39;s Spellbook quest<br/>\n&gt; which has recently been fixed since Bugglepup the gnome now spawns in<br/>\n&gt; steamfont.  When you talk to Tergon in ak&#39;anon he says to retrieve a<br/>\n&gt; metal<br/>\n&gt; pellet that he shot Bugglepup with and lost.  Well once you return it to<br/>\n&gt; him<br/>\n&gt; he tells you to search out his brother in Freeport and give him a letter<br/>\n&gt; that tells him to give you the spellbook.  So you goto freeport and<br/>\n&gt; learn<br/>\n&gt; that he was captured by the orcs.  So you take the letter to him in<br/>\n&gt; crushbone and he tells you the oracle in the castle took the book.  Kill<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; oracle, return the book and tergon sends you to oot to kill a renegade<br/>\n&gt; gnome<br/>\n&gt; thats taken up with the pirates of gunthark.  Thats as far as I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; gotten<br/>\n&gt; with the quest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was really hopeing it would yield tinkering info because Tergon says<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; shot bugglepup with one of his contraptions.  (a tinker made shotgun of<br/>\n&gt; some<br/>\n&gt; sort??)  :)  Anyone ever finish all of Tergon&#39;s quests to the end?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; gr0k - Stranger in a Strange Land - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juju.org\">http://www.juju.org</a><br/>\n&gt; &quot;Linux... find out what you&#39;ve been missing while<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ve been rebooting Windows NT&quot; - Infoworld<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
