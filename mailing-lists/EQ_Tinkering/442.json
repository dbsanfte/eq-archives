However, their spell level is set to 0 and are not currently<br/>\nimplemtented.  I imagine this is the reason we can&#39;t make them.  I assume<br/>\nthat this is due to game balance, but it could also be that they haven&#39;t<br/>\nfinished woriking out the final details with the spell.  (Wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nsurprise me with Verant&#39;s track record).  Is there anyone on this list who<br/>\nplayed in the Beta who witnessed the Fireworks spell?  Is it just simply a<br/>\ndazzling effects of lights (possibly even stunning a mob)?  Is it an AOE<br/>\ndmg spell?
