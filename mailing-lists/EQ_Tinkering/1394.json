I advertise them for 750 plat.  I tell them<br/>\nthat when they run out of charges, I will buy them<br/>\nback for 200 plat.  That&#39;s 550 plat total.  Ok, you<br/>\nget 50 charges from each, so that&#39;s 11 plat per<br/>\ncharge.  With my charisma at shaman vendors, my<br/>\nminnimum purchase price for Fish Gill Extract is near<br/>\n13 plat.  So I tell them why buy the potions that<br/>\ndon&#39;t stack when you can buy the lung instead.  50<br/>\ncharges, use it just like jboots, and only takes up<br/>\none inv slot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that&#39;s my theory.  Jewelers charge 3x to 4x<br/>\ncost for their products, I&#39;m not even charging 2x for<br/>\nmine.  Success rate is exactly 50% for me at skill<br/>\n102. <br/>\n<br/>\nGazamel Prime <br/>\nMaster Tinker - Solusek Ro<br/>\nDealers of Death<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alt_marky2@...\">alt_marky2@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just gain the master in tinkering couple days ago<br/>\n&gt; and have since<br/>\n&gt; made 10 aqualungs ... to skill of 105 now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just have 2 questions...<br/>\n&gt; 1)what prices are people selling these usually?<br/>\n&gt; (since people all <br/>\n&gt; aruond me have told me that they would rather buy<br/>\n&gt; rebreather at a <br/>\n&gt; later time instead of spending &quot;any&quot; pp on these..)<br/>\n&gt; I mean, I can<br/>\n&gt; maybe support myself and train up my skills .. but<br/>\n&gt; this is getting<br/>\n&gt; me down. <br/>\n&gt;         (600pp..including 500pp credit for a<br/>\n&gt; rebreather later..it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;                   like a loan yet no one&#39;s buying<br/>\n&gt; it...)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2)At what skill level should I start attempting on<br/>\n&gt; making rebreathers?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maruk<br/>\n&gt; Tinker Master of Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
