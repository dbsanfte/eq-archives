How do we all know that someone on<br/>\n&gt; this <br/>\n&gt; very list might have given us a so called &quot;broken recipe&quot; and it was<br/>\n&gt; actually <br/>\n&gt; the right one but they wanted to throw people off and have people not<br/>\n&gt; try it? <br/>\n&gt;  Cause think about it if someone turns in a recipe that so called<br/>\n&gt; &quot;doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; work&quot; then NO ONE will even try that recipe again because they know it <br/>\n&gt; &quot;doesn&#39;t work&quot; thus they are one of the few people who can actually make<br/>\n&gt; it.  <br/>\n&gt; So those are just my thoughts.  And as 4 the four slot thing I think<br/>\n&gt; that <br/>\n&gt; might be real.  I think this recipe probably is 4 slots.  But then again<br/>\n&gt; how <br/>\n&gt; do you all know that I haven&#39;t made one my self and just lying?  Dont<br/>\n&gt; trust <br/>\n&gt; any one cept guildmates that&#39;s what I have learned over the years.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Roj<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;              Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt; Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
