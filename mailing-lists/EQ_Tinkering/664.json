In fact one told me he didn&#39;t do it because the<br/>\n&gt; skill sucked and it wasn&#39;t worth it.  I did get a name from a high level<br/>\n&gt; gnome who said he knew someone who used to tinker a lot.  He said the guys<br/>\n&gt; name was salvadori or something like that and that he rarely came on.  He<br/>\n&gt; does however come on every once in a while.  The other thing that I found<br/>\n&gt; out, from the gm&#39;s, was that the skill is not broken.
