This would crush our market. If you<br/>\nhad a 50th hi-elf enchanter, there&#39;s no way you&#39;d feel like starting a new<br/>\ngnome mage and take him to 40th JUST to tinker (it may have a factor in<br/>\ntheir<br/>\nchoice if they&#39;re choosing a new character anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m 35th level, been tinkering since 29th. This is my first character and<br/>\nI dont have lots of cash (mostly thanks to tinkering). If the cap is removed<br/>\nI&#39;m confident the market will crash worse than it already is.<br/>\n<br/>\nJewelry works this way too.. any first level character can get 200 skill BUT<br/>\nits a continual hassle to get enchanted gold/plat if yer not a high lev<br/>\nenchanter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am certainly bias, because my meager savings only lets me advance in<br/>\nspurts.<br/>\nIf 50 master tinkerers show up on my server I&#39;m probably screwed. All my<br/>\nprevious time and cash (ALL that cash!) will be wasted. If they<br/>\nwere all 16th level, I must admit I&#39;d probably be a bit annoyed.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
