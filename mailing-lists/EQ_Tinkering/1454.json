Say you big MEch<br/>\nspider that is like a 20 slot back pack that can hold alot of Items. Have it<br/>\nhave no attack ability and just carry stuff and if you die it stands buy<br/>\nyour body also make it zone with you it wouldn&#39;t take much. Or how about the<br/>\nability to make a portable House a little building big enough for you that<br/>\nyou can rest in that is just a fare thing but the pet idea would be neat or<br/>\nmaybe have differnet pets one that gaurds you like a gnome gaurd or one to<br/>\nride so you wont lose stamina many ideas but yes it would make gnomes a<br/>\nlittle stronger but there are ways to make it even just have to work it out<br/>\nsay if you had the back pack animal you it takes time to go through it or if<br/>\nit dies you loose your stuff. If it is a gaurd it can only go about 10 feet<br/>\nfrom you and gaurd from being rushed een better make it so you can give<br/>\nthese pets to other people there fore it will make tinkering profitable but<br/>\nthis is just my 2cp thanks for listening.<br/>\n<br/>\nFanrick Magician/Tinkerer Tarew Marr.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
