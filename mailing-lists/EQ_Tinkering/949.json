In my travels, I have never seen anyone request the aid of a <br/>\ncaster who could use glimpse or whatever.  Fireworks would be great from a <br/>\nroleplaying perspective, but the market for it will be erratic at best, and <br/>\nthey may not be very cheap to make.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this isn&#39;t to discourage anyone from pursuing tinkering in any way.  <br/>\nI would think it neat to show off fireworks sometime or use the spyglass for <br/>\nmy solo explorations.  But I don&#39;t expect a profit from it.  Obviously, <br/>\nneither do these other people who seem to know the formula, because we have <br/>\nno reports of large amounts of people owning either a spyglass or fireworks.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhenglei</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
