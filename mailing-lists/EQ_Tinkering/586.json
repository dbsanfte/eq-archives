Unfortunately, there was only <br/>\none named gnome that I saw there, he was the one selling the bag of <br/>\ntinkerers, broken frost modules, small power modules, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nI could get no response from my hails... I asked about fishing poles, <br/>\njournals, Gimblestan, the works... nada.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also got lost and died there... fully decked out in my gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went back to retrieve my corpse (which all i had was the loc of) and died <br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then went back again and AMAZINGLY both my corpses were sitting at the <br/>\nentrance... Praise Brell Serelis!  I thought I had lost my stuff... I <br/>\nshuddered at the thought of losing my bloodclaw stiletto, shaped oaken <br/>\nrecurve bow, grotesque mask, and golden black pearl necklace.  I just love <br/>\nbugs (makes up for all the bugs that got me killed).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:00 AM 09/10/1999 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Eron Linver &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aeron@...\">aeron@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You only need a group of 2 really.

Have a tank with you, and a healer is always nice.<br/>\n&gt;With those 3 in a party you should be fine, but even a full party is cool<br/>\n&gt;there.  you can pull MoBs according to your party.  You get plenty of FS as<br/>\n&gt;loot, and good exp. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
