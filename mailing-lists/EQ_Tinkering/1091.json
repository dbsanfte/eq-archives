(It was that<br/>\nbig one that usually stands beside the entrance to<br/>\nAk�Anon).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I came closer I saw an ogre player beating on it,<br/>\nand I waited till he finished, to hear from him what<br/>\nloot he�d get. He killed it, and to my big surprise a<br/>\ngnome appeared from under the corpse. His name was<br/>\ndriver Bryggin, and it seems he is driving the Cargo<br/>\nclockwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I could hail him the ogre started killing him<br/>\ntoo. The gnome beat hard so the ogre had to flee, but<br/>\nthe gnome died anyway. I guess the ogre had cast a DoT<br/>\nspell on it or something. With the ogre away I looted<br/>\nthe corpses, but they had nothing valuable. The<br/>\nclockwork had scrap metal and the gnome had a rusty<br/>\ndagger.<br/>\nSo my question is, has any of you ever tried to hail<br/>\nDriver Bryggin? Could he have a quest, or even be a<br/>\nmerchant? Anyone interested in checking? I surely<br/>\ndon�t want to get messed up factins in Ak�Anon by<br/>\nkilling the clockwork myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nPiip Ignatz<br/>\nGnome rogue of the 30th grade<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
