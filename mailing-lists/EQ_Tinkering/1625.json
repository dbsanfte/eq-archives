For some reason, that&#39;s impossible to fathom, tinkering seems to<br/>\nbe on the same level cap as Caster Research - namely, 5 * (Level - 15).<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this is a bug or deliberate but we should petition<br/>\nVerant and ask that the cap be removed so that Tinkering is on a par<br/>\nwith the other trade skills (Tailor, blacksmith, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nCalbasil Psyrex of Ak&#39;Anon (Bertoxx)<br/>\nHouse of Silmindo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian Nelson wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     I am a 29 gnome Wiz, I cannot seem to get my tinkering skill above<br/>\n&gt; 70, does anyone know why?

Because in the 6 months I&#39;ve been on the<br/>\nlist, that was the FIRST mention of a specific level cap and formula.  (If<br/>\nyou can find an earlier one, please post it.).  It is also the formula that<br/>\nGnomad put up on his site AFTER I posted it here.  As to how I came up with<br/>\nthe formula, that was simple.  I ran into it exactly the same way Mr.<br/>\nNelson did (as he explains quite eloquently in a recent post), by actually<br/>\ndoing the work.  I just figured it out sooner than he did, because I had<br/>\nalready run into the same cap using Caster Research and noticed the<br/>\nparallels  in the level limits.  I&#39;d just LOVE to see the underlying math<br/>\nbehind your formula, please, please feel free to share it with us. - or at<br/>\nleast show us the post that you&#39;re quoting (i.e. date and author ) when you<br/>\nsay you remember the formula from your long experiences here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Nelson now claims that the cap has been removed or altered (I&#39;m betting<br/>\nremoved) and I believe him.  Why?  Because he&#39;s actually doing the work,<br/>\nnot simply claiming he&#39;s been here for a while and remembers seeing someone<br/>\nelse post about it.  I haven&#39;t been tinkering since the last patch (on the<br/>\nwrong continent) so I have not yet experienced the removal of the cap.  You<br/>\ncan bet I&#39;ll be running my little Gnome feet back to Ak&#39;Anon forthwith.<br/>\nYou should do the same - after you get your feet out of  your mouth :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCalbasil Psyrex of Ak&#39;Anon (Bertoxx)<br/>\nHouse of Silmindo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:36 AM 12/16/99 EST, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Diablokilr@...\">Diablokilr@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How long have you been on this list ?......
