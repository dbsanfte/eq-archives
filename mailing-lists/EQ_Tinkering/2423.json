They may be <br/>\nthe missing link.  If they are higher than aqualungs (148) and more <br/>\neconomical than rebreathers, then they could help boost skill for all <br/>\nof us tinkerers that are on a budget.  Can someone post what they <br/>\nhave found on the boot&#39;s trivial level?  Also, can someone past 148 <br/>\nmake some boots to see if they increase skill about the same or <br/>\nbetter than rebreathers?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will help me a bunch in trying to put together a training plan.  <br/>\nMight also help someone increase their skill to the point where they <br/>\ncan make at least one piece of Watchman armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just want to know if Watchman armor is going to be worthwhile or <br/>\nnot.  I hope they give it decent AC and we don&#39;t have the <br/>\nmysteriously disappearing AC like we do for rebreathers.  But we <br/>\nwon&#39;t know until someone makes it.  Sigh...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the info in advance.<br/>\nNorbert<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com\">EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com</a>, Madgrizzle &lt;MadGrizzle@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Was afraid of that.. 26 attempts and no increases.
