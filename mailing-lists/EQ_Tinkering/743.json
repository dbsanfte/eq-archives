I try to help, but you decline it. If what<br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;  want is for me to truly leave with my information, then that is what I <br/>\n&gt;will<br/>\n&gt;  do. I will leave the choice up to you. I&#39;m trying to apologize by <br/>\n&gt;helping,<br/>\n&gt;  but you seem to want to be stubborn, and keep insulting me, saying all <br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;  out here to do is brag, when in fact I&#39;m trying to do the opposite. What <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;  have to do could easily be done by a level 1 shaman barbarian. I just <br/>\n&gt;want<br/>\n&gt;  to check it out for myself first and return with a report, if you all <br/>\n&gt;hate<br/>\n&gt;  me so much that you wouldn&#39;t even take direct information from me because<br/>\n&gt;  you think I want to just brag about it, then I wil quietly leave you all<br/>\n&gt;  with out another letter. But like I said, it&#39;s yur choice, you can accept <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;  or decline it. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On your part I don&#39;t think its right your judging the whole message board <br/>\n&gt;by<br/>\n&gt;the posts of 2 people.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
