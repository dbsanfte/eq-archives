The<br/>\nmerchants at the caster&#39;s library use the Eldritch faction and the merchant<br/>\nin the warriors guild uses the Gemchoppers faction.  Not sure about the<br/>\nnecro guild, cleric guild and the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can raise the merchant faction by turning in rusted blackboxes to Manik<br/>\nand  turning in scrap metal and micro servos to the scrapyard gnome.  After<br/>\nhanding in those items in very large quantities (I was bored, heh) I<br/>\nfinally saw my faction go from indifferent to amiable.  There are probably<br/>\nsome quests at the library that also raise the merchant faction and<br/>\nprobably faster but they won&#39;t give quests out with an apprehensive /con.<br/>\n:(  However, from what I see faction doesn&#39;t seem to have as much of an<br/>\nimpact as CHA does.<br/>\n<br/>\nFizzwiz pointed out a while back that if you plan to do some serious<br/>\ntinkering you&#39;ll want to pick up some +CHA items like a Crude Stein.  Also<br/>\nEnchanters have a nice +30 CHA buff that they can cast on you.  There&#39;ll be<br/>\na several plat difference on the more expensive components and that quickly<br/>\nadds up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Luke<br/>\nTinkering trade site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqportal.com/tinkering\">http://www.eqportal.com/tinkering</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:12 PM 10/19/99 UYT, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Catbik Tinkerton&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:catbik@...\">catbik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also let&#39;s find a way to raise our faction with the merchants too so we pay <br/>\n&gt;a lot less for those expensive components =) Also note that Merchant Faction <br/>\n&gt;only affects the, umm.. &quot;real&quot; gnome merchants, not the clockwork <br/>\n&gt;merchants...
