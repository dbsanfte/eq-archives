I dropped about 60 plat and got nothing in<br/>\n&gt;return.  Anyway, I gave up on tinkering for a long time, but recently have<br/>\n&gt;gotten back into it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At level 47 and with a 184 int, I have gotten increases from making the<br/>\n&gt;lanterns about every 5 attempts.  It may be my imagination, but even a<br/>\n&gt;little extra int seems to help, so if you can get an int buff before going<br/>\n&gt;to work, do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You didn&#39;t mention what level your tinkering is at..
