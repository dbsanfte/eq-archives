[Karana]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;J.Tully&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jtully@...\">jtully@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Had an interesting conversation about a week or two ago with a female bard<br/>\n&gt; on the Karana server by the name of Cleff. She was level 8 or so, and<br/>\n&gt; claimed to have a level 48 Gnome Wizard with an almost 200 TInkering Skill.<br/>\n&gt; This person in particular started publicly (in AUCTION and OOC) berating me<br/>\n&gt; for trying to sell Spyglasses for 80pp, or Mechanical Lockpicks for 50pp.<br/>\n&gt; She stated that another level 50 Gnome Tinkerer on the Karana server was<br/>\n&gt; selling those items for half that price and I was giving tinkerers a BAD<br/>\n&gt; NAME. After I started giving the person tells asking why she was trying to<br/>\n&gt; ruin me financially (which is what she was doing), she gave me a tell back<br/>\n&gt; saying my prices where ridiculous even for a person trying to recover costs.<br/>\n&gt; I was &quot;price gouging&quot; and &quot;trying to rip people off&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here comes the interesting bit. She claimed to have a primary character that<br/>\n&gt; was a level 48 Gnome WIzard, who had an almost 200 Tinkering skill. AND she<br/>\n&gt; stated that it only cost her 400PP to get it up to 200 ! ! ! HOW in THE HELL<br/>\n&gt; is this ACCOMPLISHED?! Am I the only person who thinks this number is just<br/>\n&gt; impossible? 400pp barely covers the cost of 2 Aqualungs, much less Cams and<br/>\n&gt; Spyglasses etc etc to get the skill 100... much less OVER 100 ! Has anyone<br/>\n&gt; else run across a person making such FRIVILOUS claims?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She stated that she was best friends with two of the prominent highlevel<br/>\n&gt; tinkerers on the Server (Knok, and Thinktink), and that THIS mailing list<br/>\n&gt; was &quot;total bullshit&quot; (and I quote). The mailing list was full of newbie<br/>\n&gt; geeks who only wanted recipes for tinkering items and wheren&#39;t smart enough<br/>\n&gt; to look it up on the web.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please anyone else on Karana who reads this, respond. Let me know if you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; met this person also.
