Basically I asked if it was<br/>\nin the game and if he could give me any hint.  I was told that it was in<br/>\nthe game and that I should look toward the Rathe Mountains to some NPCs<br/>\nthat Crush gems.  I do believe he specifically was refering to the Ogres.<br/>\nIf I can get my hands on a Diamond that is where I will be trying.<br/>\nUnfortunately Diamonds are only droped by Very high level mobs.  Like Plane<br/>\nof Fear, Hate kinda places and even then not in abundance.  Ive herd that<br/>\nvendors will pay 200pp if you try to sell them a diamond.  So expect to pay<br/>\nthrough the nose for one if you find someone selling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for aqualungs, on the next patch the 20th level magician spell summon<br/>\nwaterstone will most likely be in place.  5 charges of enduring breath.<br/>\nThat kinda puts a kink in aqualung sales.  Only saving grace is that its a<br/>\nno rent stone.  But rumor has it that it won&#39;t be lore, so if you find a<br/>\nmagician before you head under the waves, you can pick up a pack full.<br/>\nOther sad note is that if you should sell an aqualung to a merchant for the<br/>\n190 plat they will give you.  The merchant charges 500 plat to buy it back.<br/>\n So unfortunately being that most of our failure rates are around 50% is<br/>\nthe cost that we need to sell them for to break even.<br/>\nPlease if your going to make aqualungs and sell them back to vendors.<br/>\nDon&#39;t leave any charged on them.  It only helps to ruin the aqualung<br/>\nmarket, whats left of it anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
