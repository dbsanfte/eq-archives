The GM I <br/>\npetitioned said it had recently come to their attention and was being <br/>\naddressed... whatever that means.<br/>\nUntil it&#39;s fixed Tinkering is pretty useless. I&#39;d love to make some of the <br/>\nharder items but don&#39;t really have 1000&#39;s of plat to throw around.{}<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for posting this bit. I hope the GM that told this to Focasa is right <br/>\nand they are &quot;addressing&quot; it. I still want as many of you to do a /petition <br/>\nor a /feedback so they REALLY take a look at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n{} yes im having the same problem but i know the skill is inproving cause <br/>\nwhen i go see my trainer it has the money symblols so it must be going up.   <br/>\n  I petion it to a gm and all he told me was that it should be improving and <br/>\nhe didnt believe me that the skill is not imporving.  He thought i was <br/>\nmaking trivial items.   I havent tried since casue im tring to save money to <br/>\nput into the skill {}<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tinkering skill starts at skill 50, plus you CAN&#39;T train it because it <br/>\nis a trade skill, and you can&#39;t train trade skills, you have to do em <br/>\nyourself.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
