Nobody is even willing to pay <br/>\n600 for these Lungs...i get tells all the time about it. sure, there are <br/>\nthose lvl 50 ppl out tehre who WILL pay more $ for em...but they are the <br/>\nminority.  HOW do you expect to raise your skill in tinkering if you cannot <br/>\nsell your products to make more cash to tinker more to...yada yada <br/>\nyada....endless cycle of cash flow. i sold 2 more lungs last night, and <br/>\nbrought my skill pt up one more time(YAY!).  i have sold 17 total Lungs and <br/>\nhave 5 ppl waiting for me to find the time to craft theirs.  last night i <br/>\ndid something that i would like to share with all of you...<br/>\ni heard a KK raid was about to occur so, what did i do? i went to KK.<br/>\nthat little trip added 2 more ppl to the list, and about 10 others said the <br/>\nusual &quot;when ya get to rebreathers i&#39;ll buy one.&quot; money in the bag. i did <br/>\nadjust my price tag after some careful consideration...but not greatly...and <br/>\ni adjusted my &quot;throw in deals&quot; to compensate.  buisness is booming...and if <br/>\nthis keeps up, you should see me screaming &quot;LUNGS ARE TRIVIAL&quot; in a <br/>\nrelatively short amount of time :)<br/>\neven with an int of 195 it takes me maybe 1500 plat to raise one skill. <br/>\nanyone having any better luck than this?<br/>\n-Ranth(who is dumbfounded by how much money has been recycled through his <br/>\nhands with this trade)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt;Not if that bracelet cost you $75-80 to make.. Your analogy bears no <br/>\n&gt;&gt;resemblance<br/>\n&gt;to the market, high level people arenn&#39;t going to balk at paying 1000pp, <br/>\n&gt;which<br/>\n&gt;is exactly what these &quot;idiots&quot; as you call them have been saying, people <br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt;buying them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ruthless price undercutting leads to stagnation of the market - look at<br/>\n&gt;blacksmithing, the first people to start selling banded armor make quite a <br/>\n&gt;good<br/>\n&gt;profit, but eventually so many people get onto the market that you get <br/>\n&gt;abused by<br/>\n&gt;your customers if you ask anything apart from slightly above cost price, as<br/>\n&gt;though they&#39;re doing you a favor by buying your product, instead of the <br/>\n&gt;other<br/>\n&gt;way around  - people like this I just tell &quot;Go buy chainmail from a vendor<br/>\n&gt;then&quot;.  People complain about the Jewelley market&#39;s &quot;price fixing&quot;, but I<br/>\n&gt;believe that it&#39;s helped the market more than hurt it, becasue it makes it<br/>\n&gt;worthwhile for other people to invest in getting their jewellery skills up <br/>\n&gt;-<br/>\n&gt;rather than spending hundreds of plat to get your skill up, and find that <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;can only make items for your guild/friends becasue ruthless competition has <br/>\n&gt;made<br/>\n&gt;it near unprofitable to sell to anyone else. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
