The only problem is I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; see how they could possible implement such a thing.  All items that have<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; special ability are based on magic and there&#39;s no magic equivalent to<br/>\n&gt; this.  I could see how this could work as a combine/tradeskill based<br/>\n&gt; item<br/>\n&gt; if you could put money in an inventory slot and press combine, but I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think you can put money in an inventory slot can you?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
