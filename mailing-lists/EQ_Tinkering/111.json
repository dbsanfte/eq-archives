The staff from the priest<br/>\ncan not be made by any quest or skill it is just an item from loot further<br/>\nmore it is not even a 2h weapon it is a 1h weapon I think it has 23 to 28<br/>\ndly and has 10dmg a friend of mine killed the priest and had one for a<br/>\nwhile... I have Heard a bit about other staff quests. There is one in the<br/>\nquenos hills for a jaggedpine crook (a druid and ranger only weapon) for<br/>\nthis quest you must be below lvl 8 and have a top and bottom of a broken<br/>\nstaff.. If my memory servers it does about 5dmg and has 23 dly plus gives<br/>\nlike 5hp and mana. In the Karanas I have talked to people who have found<br/>\nother staff segment pieces for what this quest is for I am not sure ( I have<br/>\nbeen told there is 13 staff segments in all and the top looks like a skull<br/>\nbut I can not confirm this for sure) I hope this helps those out there.. As<br/>\nfor the King he looks like a small male human so that he can not be mistaken<br/>\nas just another gnome a gm has told me that in the long run they were<br/>\nthinking of adding a quest that he gives out but as for now he just acts<br/>\nlike another clockwork gnome.<br/>\n<br/>\nKlade<br/>\n14 lvl Magician (Povar)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
