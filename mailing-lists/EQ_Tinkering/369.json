The group making spyglasses on the Xegony server is <br/>\nnot actually making them.  I hypothesis, based upon Luke&#39;s ownership of a <br/>\nfishing pole, that the collapsible fishing pole may be a drop from <br/>\nMeldrath.  Has anyone killed and looted him?  His guards are around Level <br/>\n35 or so, but Meldrath is around 26.  Perhaps a method to kill him would be <br/>\nto get a druid or shaman with SOW to cast at the guards, pull them away out <br/>\nof the cave and let a warrior and wizard finish Meldrath off.  Perhaps its <br/>\na common drop, maybe a rare drop.  Just another theory.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
