Couldn&#39;t have said it better myself. I too am going to <br/>\nmake an expedition there, and, as soon as I can get to level 20 (because of <br/>\nthe sharks and other powerful things) I&#39;m going to borrow a fishbone earring <br/>\nfrom a guild member and search the ocean floor. The earring gives unlimited <br/>\nbreath, so I won&#39;t need to come up for air.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;A little bird told me.<br/>\n&gt;If anyone would think about it...from every lie to every truth I have ever<br/>\n&gt;heard, the one thing that is constant is that we should &quot;search beneath the<br/>\n&gt;waves&quot;. Think about the story behind things. If I have learned anything <br/>\n&gt;from<br/>\n&gt;playing EverQuest for all of these months, I have learned that Verant and<br/>\n&gt;the programmers love a good story. They love to flesh things out, why else<br/>\n&gt;would so many of these quests be long and drawn out. Think of the story<br/>\n&gt;behind the cave ad the necro there, he is supposed to be banished there by<br/>\n&gt;the gods in a huge epic tale, not because of some measly tinkering book. As<br/>\n&gt;well with the spelunker fer one thing he is NOT beneath the waves. I dont<br/>\n&gt;know what the story behind him is but come on if it were that easy do you<br/>\n&gt;not think someone has tried that by now? NO our answer does lie in the<br/>\n&gt;realms of the submerged, no probably not kedge keep as it is not itemized.<br/>\n&gt;Has anyone ever heard someone say anything about the battle they ad against<br/>\n&gt;sea serpents? Probably not. Why? because no one as explored the depths. No<br/>\n&gt;one has spent an entire month drudging the ocean floors. Maybe one or two<br/>\n&gt;people were masicistic enough or maybe just bored enough to one day decide<br/>\n&gt;to go hunt the oceans for things maybe they fell off a boat and <br/>\n&gt;accidentally<br/>\n&gt;caught a glimpse of something that changed everything. Maybe its in lake<br/>\n&gt;rathe, mayvbe its in the ocean of tears, maybe its in erud&#39;s crossing, I<br/>\n&gt;dont know but if anywere these are the three likely places.<br/>\n&gt;I have heard multiple rumors of a secret cave on erollisi island wher you<br/>\n&gt;push a button and hear some grinding. I have yet to find this button but it<br/>\n&gt;has been said enough to me to get some of my attention. Im planning an<br/>\n&gt;expedidtion on the bertoxxulous server for this next weekend to go to the<br/>\n&gt;ocean of tears and to comb the ocean floor if i have to but if its there to<br/>\n&gt;find i will find it. Subsequest trips will be to erud&#39;s crossing and lake<br/>\n&gt;rathe but for now my hopes and my ideas are drawing me to the ocean of<br/>\n&gt;tears. Start your own expeditions. With enough people looking for it it <br/>\n&gt;will<br/>\n&gt;be found and the secrets of tinkering will belong to us all!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Ralph Scott [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rscott@...\">rscott@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, October 06, 1999 3:50 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] More clues from Lindell, third book<br/>\n&gt;confirmed, and more...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Ralph Scott &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rscott@...\">rscott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Michael Ott wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Michael Ott &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mott@...\">mott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the necro is not the way to go neiter is the spelunker...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And you know this how??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;---ralph<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
