I have been selling<br/>\nAqualungs for 400 plat, and rebreathers for 3k plat. <br/>\nMy success rates vary on lungs, but are consistent<br/>\nwith rebreathers.  I have about 150 int and 135 wisdom<br/>\nwhen I tinker, not too shabby for a warrior =)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere really aren&#39;t more than a handful of tinkers on<br/>\nour server (2, maybe 3 who can make lungs), yet there<br/>\nis still no market.  It&#39;s really hard to sell either<br/>\nof them since people can&#39;t really rationalize spending<br/>\nthat much money, even though it will save their life. <br/>\nI tire of hearing the snide shouts when I auction my<br/>\nwares, things like &quot;That&#39;s a waste of plat!&quot; and &quot;What<br/>\na rip off!&quot;, and quite a few more colorful ones, which<br/>\nI won&#39;t go into detail here about.  The state of our<br/>\ntrade skill is sad, we are so limited in what we make<br/>\nthat it&#39;s almost pointless to pursue it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who sells rebreathers for 2500 is insane, I<br/>\nagree there.  My success rate is 33% exactly, so the<br/>\n3k plat I sell them for only covers my expenses, with<br/>\nzero profit.  Ask a jeweller to sell their wares with<br/>\nthe same profit and they&#39;ll laugh you out of Kelethin.<br/>\n Lungs are equivalent in cost to a plat sapphire<br/>\nnecklace, yet are sold for 400 compared to 1000.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am 100% on tinkering gemcutters - 3 for 3.  If you<br/>\ncan make those, do so, it&#39;s been hinted that they will<br/>\nbe EXTREMELY valuable in the expansion, and given the<br/>\ndifficulty of getting diamond dust, it makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to you all, and pray for a re-vamp of the<br/>\ntrade soon.  Maybe we&#39;ll get to make more interesting<br/>\nthings. <br/>\n<br/>\nGazamel Prime<br/>\n50 Gnome Warrior, Master Tinker<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Linus Gustafsson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:linusgson@...\">linusgson@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Selling Rebreathers for 2500p is mad. Sure you get<br/>\n&gt; em sold, and it is a way <br/>\n&gt; of keeping &quot;afloat&quot; as those who have plat to spare<br/>\n&gt; want to sell em off as <br/>\n&gt; fast as they can to tinker more. I am at the stage<br/>\n&gt; where I can do <br/>\n&gt; rebreathers, but I fail a LOT still. Some ppl on my<br/>\n&gt; server has been selling <br/>\n&gt; off rebreathers from 7-10kpp which is defenitly too<br/>\n&gt; much IMO. I was <br/>\n&gt; auctioning them for 3.5k which I thought was too low<br/>\n&gt; but I thought was the <br/>\n&gt; goin price, now ppl tell me to sell them for no less<br/>\n&gt; than 5kp, so that is <br/>\n&gt; what I will charge for them, might go down to 4 or<br/>\n&gt; 4.5 if they buy more than <br/>\n&gt; one, or return me an aqualung as a part deal.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With a 50% failure rate, a rebreather would cost<br/>\n&gt; 1900p to make, at least for <br/>\n&gt; me, if you succeed on both lungs, sell em for 2500<br/>\n&gt; and you make a measly <br/>\n&gt; 600p profit. I have skill of 118 now, and it cost me<br/>\n&gt; nearly 28k to get there <br/>\n&gt; (i know, i have been doin something wrong somewhere<br/>\n&gt; probably, eheh) and with <br/>\n&gt; a 600p profit on each rebreather I&#39;ll never get that<br/>\n&gt; money back. I think 5kp <br/>\n&gt; for a rebreather is a decent price...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Sandortien<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Get Your Private, Free Email at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
