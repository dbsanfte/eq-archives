It used to be the<br/>\nnecromancer guild as well but it was getting rediculously crowded so they<br/>\nmoved the necros down to the mines of malfunction.  As you go up the ramp to<br/>\nthe guild, stop at the top and look at it.  There is actually a sign that<br/>\nsays &quot;Library Mechamagica&quot; above the door.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe secret wall is the only corner that does not have a (visible) area for a<br/>\nspecific guild.  Since there are obvious areas for mages, wizards, and<br/>\nenchanters, just walk through the one remaining wall that isn&#39;t taken up.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly that secret isn&#39;t nearly so perplexing as the location of the rogue<br/>\nguild.  I had to start a newbie wood elf ranger to track the guildmaster<br/>\nbefore I could find it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tony Buser [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gr0k@...\">gr0k@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 19, 1999 4:00 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] I hate figuring out these riddles can<br/>\nsomeone please spel...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Tony Buser&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gr0k@...\">gr0k@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a wall you can walk through in the Library??
