I haven&#39;t raised my tinkering<br/>\n&gt; skill very high yet, but with my primary character, I have my fletching<br/>\n&gt; skill to 135 currently.  During that time, I noticed that the level or two<br/>\n&gt; right before the trivial point of what I was working on would take a<br/>\n&gt; disproportionately high number of attempts to gain, and my success rate<br/>\n&gt; would be extremely low.  Often just after trivializing something I would<br/>\nsee<br/>\n&gt; fairly good success rates and skill increase on the next level of product.<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps this was a fluke with my observations, but maybe it explains some<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; the success ratios and maddeningly expensive skill point gains.  Another<br/>\n&gt; thing I have noticed, which may be just my luck, is I seem to have a<br/>\nbetter<br/>\n&gt; success ratio and skill gain if my wisdom is higher than my int,<br/>\nregardless<br/>\n&gt; of how high they are.  Higher int does seem to help skill gain to a good<br/>\n&gt; degree, but it really seemed that if I got my int higher than my wis, the<br/>\n&gt; skill gain would slow a bit, and my success ratio would go way down.  Just<br/>\n&gt; some of my observations, take em with a grain of salt.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jeremy Wells<br/>\n&gt;     -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;     From: Madgrizzle [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MadGrizzle@...\">MadGrizzle@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;     Sent: Tuesday, March 14, 2000 4:56 PM<br/>\n&gt;     To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;     Subject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Success / Failure ratios<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     From: Madgrizzle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MadGrizzle@...\">MadGrizzle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I think it has to do with the skill level you are at.  I suspect there<br/>\n&gt; may<br/>\n&gt;     be &#39;hell&#39; levels you have to work through.  I recently started to<br/>\ntinker<br/>\n&gt;     with my character.  I made flameless lanterns all the way to 68, then<br/>\n&gt;     switched to cams.  I did 8 at a time with the cams.  The first batch,<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt;     6 for 8.  The next batch, I was 8 for 8.  I was at skill 74 after that<br/>\n&gt; (75<br/>\n&gt;     is trivial).  I then went 1 for 6 getting that last point.  I&#39;ve begun<br/>\n&gt;     making stalking probes since they are cheaper to make than the<br/>\n&gt;     spyglasses.  I don&#39;t have firm stats on it, but I did 50% for about<br/>\n10,<br/>\n&gt;     then went on a 1 for 6 streak, then back to 50% again for the next 4.<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt;     suspect there may be some sticking points you have to work through<br/>\n(for<br/>\n&gt;     example, skill level of 73 might bring more successes than 74).   I<br/>\nknow<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt;     seems odd, but its either that, or I had a run of bad luck.
