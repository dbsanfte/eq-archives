The person said that they were a required component which he found out through a quest or something.. however tinkering was not yet fully implimented so i was unable to do this. I should have followed up on it more though.... :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&quot;They are called the &quot;Lens of <br/>\n&gt;Glowing Amber&quot; Which makes me pretty much think that they are definately the <br/>\n&gt;first component.  And they are dropped by a froglock summoner in upper guk.  <br/>\n&gt;Personally I am not high enough to go find these myself yet..So have not <br/>\n&gt;personally seen one but have seen various posts enough to know that they do <br/>\n&gt;exist..except people don&#39;t know what to do with them. And I am sure this is <br/>\n&gt;a rare drop because you just don&#39;t see those over the auction channels <br/>\n&gt;everyday..;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shokakon<br/>\n&gt;Gnome Necromancer of Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;             Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt;Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;        <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
