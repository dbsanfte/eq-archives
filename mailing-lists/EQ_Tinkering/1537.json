People speak so freely about<br/>\n&gt;what they know is right or wrong without even really finding out a <br/>\n&gt;deffinent<br/>\n&gt;asnwer for themselves. As for the person that is angry about this thread,<br/>\n&gt;man lighten up. As for right now everyone knows that Tinkering like <br/>\n&gt;Reaserch<br/>\n&gt;is a trade skill. That means that when you learn it you can continue to<br/>\n&gt;learn with out me capped out on a level. I have read many threads where<br/>\n&gt;people believe this or that. Then when someone says something and everyone<br/>\n&gt;finds out it was true they are like I knew that. Ok As far as it has been<br/>\n&gt;said my BM is that on all trade skills includeing research and the other<br/>\n&gt;hard to raise skills there is no cap per level. So I believe that it is<br/>\n&gt;possible to go above actually I have a gnome with 77 and I am 18 that is 2<br/>\n&gt;points above max. I got the money to raise this from my guild but none the<br/>\n&gt;less. FRom my experiance and what has been said it seems the either one the<br/>\n&gt;cap is different or the cap is gone. I do not doubt anything people have<br/>\n&gt;said but it seems that, there may be alot of truth in some things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Correct me if I am wrong, but are you saying that spell research does not <br/>\nhave a cap?  You are mistaken if you think so.  To be as objective as <br/>\npossible, I will detail the circumstances that convince me that spell <br/>\nresearch is capped per level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI play on Erollisi Marr, and general consensus is that each server has its <br/>\nown tweaked code, for whatever reason.  On this server, I have played a <br/>\nwizard up to level 44, and spent training points/cash on most of my spell <br/>\nresearch skill learns.  I would say maybe 15% of my gains in spell research <br/>\nhave come strictly from combining runes.  Now, everytime I level, I go to a <br/>\nguildmaster and train this skill.  It goes up 5 times, and then the <br/>\nguildmaster refuses to train me anymore, until I level again.  As a test, <br/>\nonce I did nothing but rune practice for 5 points, then went to the <br/>\nguildmaster.  He could not train me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is possible that some servers have skill caps, and others do not.  Just <br/>\ncompare zone closings on different servers.  If they are supposedly the same <br/>\ncode base, why do some servers go down for software maintenance and others <br/>\ndo not?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also possible that the guildmaster is level capped, but practice is <br/>\nnot.  This is difficult for me to verify because, at level 44 with max <br/>\nresearch, I first have to level to 45, then collect a ton of level 44 runes <br/>\nto combine.  I have had a problem acquiring those runes, so it would take <br/>\nweeks to verify a level cap or not in that fashion.  But, in that amount of <br/>\ntime, I will have levelled, so the process is a waste for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I am trying to say is that it may very well be possible that <br/>\nsome servers have a level-cap on tinkering, and others do not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that Erollisi Marr had a tinkering cap 2 months ago for sure.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
