I think we&#39;re right with<br/>\n&gt;the metal shaft and rod combos but we&#39;re missing something.  Here&#39;s a few<br/>\n&gt;of my thoughts thus far:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Fletching strings or dwarven wire as a component seems unlikely.<br/>\n&gt;Although some items need things MADE by other trade skills (compass), I<br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t think of anything that requires you buy components from a different<br/>\n&gt;trade skill.  Dwarven wire is for the Trueshot Bow quest (?) and takes a<br/>\n&gt;while to obtain - lots of travelling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Spiderling silk sounds like a good possibility.  Watch out though, there<br/>\n&gt;is SPIDER silk, and SPIDERLING silk.  The latter seems more likely as<br/>\n&gt;spiderlings are right in Steamfont and it would be very similar to how the<br/>\n&gt;lockpicks need a rat ear.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Spriket?  Assuming that the two books are all that exists of tinkering<br/>\n&gt;now, a spriket is the only item not used for any project.  What is a<br/>\n&gt;spriket though?  Not in the dictionary...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Raw bamboo doesn&#39;t seem like a likely component.  It is a bard<br/>\n&gt;instrument, also the pic of the collapsible pole shows it constructed of<br/>\n&gt;metal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- A bottle as a possible component.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Luke<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If fishing poles are a part of the formula, it seems like you would use the<br/>\nstring from the pole.  And yeah, what the hell is a spriket?<br/>\n<br/>\nRotgut</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
