They did it when the servers were<br/>\n&gt; down with that Cerfnet and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; UUnet trouble.  Anyway, I was wondering if anyone<br/>\n&gt; has tried the tinkering<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill since the patch to see if the skill cap (I<br/>\n&gt; think it was (Level - 15) x<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 5) has been fixed yet.  I had been hoping that<br/>\n&gt; they would fix it in this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; patch after someone reported that a GM said they<br/>\n&gt; should be fixing it soon,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; maybe even in the next patch.  If anyone knows if<br/>\n&gt; you can Tinker outside the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level cap now please say so =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Logalog,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Veeshan Server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
