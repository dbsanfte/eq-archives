Why do so many immature people keep sending these &quot;I know you and<br/>\nyou know so screw you&quot; messages.  I thought most of us got past that by the time<br/>\nwe were in kindergarten.  It seems that may people on this list did not have the<br/>\nbox marked &quot;Plays well with others&quot;  Because they are arrogant and selfish.<br/>\nEvery day brings another message like this drivel.  This guy knows nothing at<br/>\nall, and is simply an immature jerk.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua Bednarz wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Joshua Bednarz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thewhitemage@...\">thewhitemage@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do know something. I took all my knowledge, everything I know, used all<br/>\n&gt; the common sense I have, and was able to talk my way into a clue from a<br/>\n&gt; person that knows all about the fishing poles. At first I thought whoever<br/>\n&gt; knew about it was selfish, that they had no right to keep this, but then<br/>\n&gt; when I found out that this group of people worked hard for what they had<br/>\n&gt; found, and are very secrective about it, don&#39;t deserve their secret to be<br/>\n&gt; given away. I mean, THEY are the ones that found the secret, and yes it is a<br/>\n&gt; secret, so why is it that they should just go off and tell everyone? This<br/>\n&gt; game is all about exploration and finding things, and having fun. Thats what<br/>\n&gt; they did, and they found something, so why shouldn&#39;t you have to do the same<br/>\n&gt; thing that they did? Why should you just sit back and happily profit from<br/>\n&gt; all thier work? This group, whom is a very secretive group, whom I shall not<br/>\n&gt; name, worked hard to get what they know, and so I&#39;m not going to go giving<br/>\n&gt; away the clue I was told, especially after the rude, immature, derogatory<br/>\n&gt; comments that were made about me. I will tell you this though. Waste not a<br/>\n&gt; plat more on trying combinations. You are not only wasting your money, but<br/>\n&gt; you are wasting your time. Search the world, high and low, search the world<br/>\n&gt; above and below...<br/>\n&gt; This is all I will say. It&#39;s been nice being part of this list. I though you<br/>\n&gt; were a bunch of decent people. Your coments have changed my mind. I will no<br/>\n&gt; longer be a part of this list as you wish. It&#39;s been fun guys, and thanks<br/>\n&gt; for all the fish.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sniffledoo Copperheart 18th Common Squire of The Scarlet Blade<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--Eron<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aeron@...\">aeron@...</a><br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom a real accident report:<br/>\n&quot;To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front, I struck the pedestrian.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
