The dwarf babbled<br/>\nsome dribbel about dragonscale cloaks and armour, but the gnome had a much<br/>\nmore interesting story to tell.  He told me he was in the jewelling<br/>\nbusiness, and that he had mastered a unique gem cutting technique.  He asked<br/>\nme if I needed a stone [cut] or if I needed some jewelry [repaired].  After<br/>\ninquiring about how he was cutting these gems, he told me that he could do<br/>\nit yes, but only to rare or exceptional stones, and asked me what kind of<br/>\nstone I had.  I lied, I told him I had every stone I had ever heard of, from<br/>\nmalachite to black sky diamonds, but he did not seem interested in and of<br/>\nthese.  I asked him all about his repair services, and he told me that for a<br/>\nsmall fee he would repair a piece of jewelry, but that this was more of a<br/>\nhobby of his and would not comment further on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis gnome went by the name of Darfumple Zirubbel, his location in the Rathe<br/>\nMountains is about 5000, 900 (both positive).  Perhaps you can garner more<br/>\ninformation from him, and learn his gemcutting techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\nCogg - Rallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
