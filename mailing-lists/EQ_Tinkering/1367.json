With a component cost around 225 that<br/>\nmeans your cost would be around 450. I would have prefered to sell them at 600, <br/>\nbut people balked too much (a lot depends on the maturity of your server and <br/>\nhow many high levels you have). So, I wound up selling them for about 550, which<br/>\nhas become a popular item for folks headed to Kedge Keep, and nets me 100 plat.<br/>\nHowever, I have no problem with someone trying to get upward of 800 to 900 plat<br/>\non them given the chance and the &#39;right&#39; customer...heh-heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a skill below 100, I would not recomend trying them yet. Mainly because you <br/>\ncan get your skill up to 102 with the probes, and you will have to charge around<br/>\n700 plat or so for your lungs to break even with a failure rate in the 65% range.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nFizzWizz of tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
