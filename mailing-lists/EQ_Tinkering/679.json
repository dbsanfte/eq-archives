You&#39;ve had<br/>\nplenty of time since you sent your first message, but instead of verifying<br/>\nyour information that is SO important to our group here, you&#39;re just sitting<br/>\nthere watching our replies to your original message. Either check it out or<br/>\ntell us so we can.

I&#39;m trying to apologize by helping,<br/>\n&gt; but you seem to want to be stubborn, and keep insulting me, saying all I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; out here to do is brag, when in fact I&#39;m trying to do the opposite. What I<br/>\n&gt; have to do could easily be done by a level 1 shaman barbarian. I just want<br/>\n&gt; to check it out for myself first and return with a report, if you all hate<br/>\n&gt; me so much that you wouldn&#39;t even take direct information from me because<br/>\n&gt; you think I want to just brag about it, then I wil quietly leave you all<br/>\n&gt; with out another letter. But like I said, it&#39;s yur choice, you can accept<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; or decline it.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
