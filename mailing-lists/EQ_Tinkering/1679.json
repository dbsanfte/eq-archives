This is a screenshot taken from some people who <br/>\nmade an EQ emulator. Browse thru the directories, there&#39;s a lot more pics in <br/>\nthere. The reason the items don&#39;t change his stats to green is because they <br/>\nare merely items taken from one of the files in the EQ directory, they <br/>\nhavn&#39;t been programmed to give any stat boosts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an addition, I&#39;ve also downloaded that viewer that lets you view the EQ <br/>\nfiles, for instance you can listen to all the sounds and look at the <br/>\ngraphics. The gun is indeed in the graphics file (can&#39;t think of the name of <br/>\nthe file right now). This is one reason I&#39;ve been so bent on wrestling more <br/>\ninfo from Tergon, the gnome who says he shot the iron pellet into Bugglegup <br/>\n(spellcheck).<br/>\n<br/>\nhehhehehe =)<br/>\n<br/>\nCatbik Tinkerton<br/>\nChampions of Brell<br/>\nBertoxx<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://n.ethz.ch/student/brunoh/download/poorguy.jpg\">http://n.ethz.ch/student/brunoh/download/poorguy.jpg</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;and used the gun in the picture as a refrence, since looking at the pic and<br/>\n&gt;site, you 1st notice the guy is lvl 100... umm YEA..
