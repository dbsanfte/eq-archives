There are some runes on the surface of it that look like some of<br/>\nthe runes that I&#39;ve seen in Tolkien&#39;s books.  I know Tolkien did a<br/>\ncomprehensive language system using runes and such, but I&#39;m not enough of a<br/>\nfantasy geek to actually know any of the specifics.  Given that the clock is<br/>\nsupposedly gnome built, it might have a tidbit of information on it.  The<br/>\nfact that it&#39;s in plain sight would make it a prime target for a designer<br/>\nwith a sense of humor too.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
