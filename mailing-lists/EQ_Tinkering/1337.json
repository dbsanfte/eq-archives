All I see","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-735772984\">I have a quick question about fireworks.   I have been able to tinker<br/>\nthem at level 21 with no problem.  However, they are a pathetic <br/>\night to behold. All I see when I use them is a little flash of <br/>\ncolored light move away from me for about a quarter of a second.  <br/>\nI read a post though a while back of someone describing a very neat <br/>\nfirework effect.  Can anyone please confirm this?  Also, I talked to <br/>\na couple GMs on Erollisi Marr and the information I gathered is <br/>\nthat gnomish fireworks are not even listed as being broken and that<br/>\nthere is therefore no ETA on fixing them.  This really bothers me <br/>\nbecause they could be a very interesting item in terms of role-<br/>\nplaying.  Would anyone out there be interested in them enough to <br/>\nstart a petition?  I know there are more worth-while things to <br/>\npetition about, but this is one thing that could actually be <br/>\nfixed quite easily if Verant knew that there were enough people <br/>\nout there that wanted these to work right.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, at one point at Gnomad&#39;s web site it says that your tinkering<br/>\nskill cannot increase until level 16.  But then he has a chart and <br/>\nequation posted that show your skill cannot break 50 until level <br/>\n26.  I have also read in other places that the skill for <br/>\ntinkering is (5 * lvl) or (5 * lvl) - 5, which would mean that at <br/>\n22 my skill could be 60 or 55, breaking 50 at 16 or 16, <br/>\nrespectively.  Can a number of people please confirm one of these<br/>\nequations?  I&#39;ve already spent quite a bit of plat on non-trivial <br/>\nitems and I don&#39;t believe my skill has increased.  BTW the newer <br/>\nequation at Gnomad&#39;s site is (5  * (lvl - 15)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help is much appreciated<br/>\n<br/>\nLithuin Lightbringer<br/>\nLevel 22 wizard<br/>\nSylvan Guard<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
