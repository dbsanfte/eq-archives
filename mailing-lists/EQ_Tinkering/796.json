Well I went there the other day<br/>\nand spent about an hour clicking and stopping the wheels.  Tried to get them<br/>\nall to stop at once.  Nothing happened.  I tried clicking on all the little<br/>\ndodads in the windmills (the barrels and that odd out of place set of<br/>\ndrawers) Nothing happened.  Tried spewing off every possible term (meldrath,<br/>\ngimblestein, etc) to the npcs in there.  Nothing happened.  I got so<br/>\nfrustrated that I created a newbie gnome named Tinkering and attacked the<br/>\ntinkering merchant. hehe so now on Erollisi Marr there&#39;s &quot;Tinkering&#39;s<br/>\nCorpse&quot; laying at the feet of the tinkering merchant.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\ngr0k - Stranger in a Strange Land - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juju.org\">http://www.juju.org</a><br/>\n&quot;Linux... find out what you&#39;ve been missing while<br/>\nyou&#39;ve been rebooting Windows NT&quot; - Infoworld<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Zinken &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zinken@...\">zinken@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 07, 1999 1:50 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Tinkering] Talked to Viik<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello Friends<br/>\n<br/>\nI got booted from my server Veeshan 10 min ago so i joind the chat to try<br/>\nand talk to an GM or something and i talked to one called Viik, and asked<br/>\nwhy is the tinkering screwed and itï¿½s so damn hard to raise the skill and he<br/>\ntold me that is becouse the tinkering skill are so cool. Well me response<br/>\nwas how is it cool we cant make anything not even an collapsable fishing<br/>\npole who shouldnt be that hard to make or find the recipe for. He then told<br/>\nme that  the recipe for the collapsable fishing pole are in the windmills<br/>\nand that he hade done ALL the items last night on the test server. So i<br/>\nasked if it was on the test server only, and he said no on ALL the servers.<br/>\nI then asked what about gnomish fireworks can that be made to ? and he said<br/>\nyes it can be done. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
