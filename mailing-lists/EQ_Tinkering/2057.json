BUT, the person who<br/>\n&gt; remarked about the guard killers is VERY right. Jogl stands right next to<br/>\n&gt; the watchman at the Windmills when he&#39;s outside.. and WILL aggro on guard<br/>\n&gt; killers ... so he usually ends up getting popped if that happens.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The REALLY bad news? Jogl Doobraugh is on a RARE RARE spawn timer. 9 times<br/>\n&gt; out of 10 when I was first trying to do the Bootstrutter&#39;s Pack quest.. he<br/>\n&gt; was dead and wouldn&#39;t repop. He doesn&#39;t pop in and out, he stays popped in..<br/>\n&gt; and moves around from outside Windmill 1 to inside Windmill 3. If you can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; find him anywhere, he&#39;s been killed and will most likely NOT repop until the<br/>\n&gt; next Server Reboot.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anytime I am trying to finish quests in / around AkAnon I always wait till<br/>\n&gt; right after a server reboot.
