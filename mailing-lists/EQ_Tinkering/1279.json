Thats once again, way to heavy, unless you carry it<br/>\naround in a weight reducing bag.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the very least, they could uncap our tinker skills from our level so we<br/>\ncan train up to be able to make these things.  And they could revamp the<br/>\ntrivial level for items to give us a few cheaper items to raise skill on.<br/>\nFor example, collapsable poles could trivial out at 65, then lanterns at<br/>\n85, then cams, then spyglasses etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nRotgut</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
