I&#39;ve just<br/>\n&gt; reached level 9 myself, and finished buying all the 3rd circle spells that I<br/>\n&gt; need.  Tinkering is now my next goal.  I have a few questions though. At what<br/>\n&gt; level will your tinkering skills improve.  I haven&#39;t been back to my homeland<br/>\n&gt; in a while and I was wondering how much the toolkit and the first book cost.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Malkin<br/>\n&gt; Gnomish Wizard and soon to be seller of infravision goggles.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David Nelson wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: David Nelson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DNelson@...\">DNelson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Same here.. made the Flameless Lantern last night myself.  Glad to finally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; see something happen with tinkering!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Emerical<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rjones@...\">rjones@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ok, so after the solution for Firewater was given<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to me, I tried Tinkering the stuff, simple. Worked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; every time. Then I tried the only item that I could afford and tada, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; first(in the game I think) Flameless Lantern (gave it away) then two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; failures. But all in all I made 3. They seem to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at least as bright as Lightstone, possibly brighter, but being a Gnome, what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do I need it for? :) But it&#39;s been done. Tinkering works.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Going to put in my order for Pie Tins and start<br/>\n&gt; &gt; making Compasses. And as soon as I find a tattered<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cloak, it&#39;s Thermal Cloak time. Man I need more money.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Zikkin<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; See homepage for details. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
