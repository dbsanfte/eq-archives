He still says it&#39;s in there\r<br/>\nbut did tell me what Firewater is made from.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo, spoiler gap and then I&#39;ll tell you\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCombine Flask Of Water + Gnomish Spirits (where \r<br/>\nyou get this?
