My suspicion is that further information <br/>\nregarding tinkering may be quest related.  Seeing as the Library of <br/>\nMechanica houses the Eldritch Collective, a group of tinkerers, it may be <br/>\nnecessary to complete their quest for the telescope lens to recieve a new <br/>\nquest for tinkering information, and maybe inductance into the Eldritch <br/>\nCollective.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe telescope lens quest requires one to gather four spare telescope lenses <br/>\nfrom the observatories in Steamfont and Lesser Fay.  Two of them tell you <br/>\nto come back in two weeks, one tells you it has been stolen by a dark elf <br/>\nwho may be in Freeport, and one tells you his brother, Bidl Frugin, has it, <br/>\nbut was captured and enslaved by the minos.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the dark elf is in Freeport and readily easy to find near the docks, <br/>\nI&#39;ll post the name once I remember it.  Second, I can&#39;t seem to get the <br/>\n&#39;two-weekers&#39; to say any more so I&#39;ve skipped them for now.  Third, Bidl <br/>\nFrugin is not in the Mino Caves in Steamfont, I went throughout the cave <br/>\nand could not find him, saw two other slaves though, but they would not <br/>\nspeak to me.  Hummph.  I think it might be possible that he is at a <br/>\ndifferent Mino camp, but can&#39;t be sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest that we try to find the locations of all mino camps and search <br/>\nthem.  Its relatively safe to do so when invisible (as I&#39;ve searched the <br/>\nSteamfont Mino mine with no problem from Meldrath and his guards).  If you <br/>\nknow the location of other mino camps, please post them as replies and I <br/>\nwill go check them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nMadix Grizzlestrike<br/>\nBristlebane Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
