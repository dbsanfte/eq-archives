I was there when I was in my teens, but have not returned to<br/>\nsee<br/>\n&gt; what he did.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gnome in crushbone is actually part of the Tergon&#39;s Spellbook quest<br/>\nwhich has recently been fixed since Bugglepup the gnome now spawns in<br/>\nsteamfont.  When you talk to Tergon in ak&#39;anon he says to retrieve a metal<br/>\npellet that he shot Bugglepup with and lost.  Well once you return it to him<br/>\nhe tells you to search out his brother in Freeport and give him a letter<br/>\nthat tells him to give you the spellbook.  So you goto freeport and learn<br/>\nthat he was captured by the orcs.  So you take the letter to him in<br/>\ncrushbone and he tells you the oracle in the castle took the book.  Kill the<br/>\noracle, return the book and tergon sends you to oot to kill a renegade gnome<br/>\nthats taken up with the pirates of gunthark.  Thats as far as I&#39;ve gotten<br/>\nwith the quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was really hopeing it would yield tinkering info because Tergon says he<br/>\nshot bugglepup with one of his contraptions.  (a tinker made shotgun of some<br/>\nsort??)  :)  Anyone ever finish all of Tergon&#39;s quests to the end?<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\ngr0k - Stranger in a Strange Land - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juju.org\">http://www.juju.org</a><br/>\n&quot;Linux... find out what you&#39;ve been missing while<br/>\nyou&#39;ve been rebooting Windows NT&quot; - Infoworld </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
