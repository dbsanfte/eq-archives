I think it may be it but I also disagre with the formuala . I<br/>\ncan think of no other formuala in the game that uses this, and the math does<br/>\nseem consistant but we will see. But I agree with Diabloklr on one thing it<br/>\nis at least not (level-15) *5. Hey guys this is a thread on Tinkering lets<br/>\nfigure out what this is and see what we can come up with this.
