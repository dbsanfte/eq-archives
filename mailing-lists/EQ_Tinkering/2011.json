I&#39;ve never heard of anyone suggesting that one.<br/>\nThat would be truely usefull and I can&#39;t see how it could imbalance the<br/>\ngame if it were to be made a charged item.  The only problem is I don&#39;t<br/>\nsee how they could possible implement such a thing.  All items that have a<br/>\nspecial ability are based on magic and there&#39;s no magic equivalent to<br/>\nthis.  I could see how this could work as a combine/tradeskill based item<br/>\nif you could put money in an inventory slot and press combine, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink you can put money in an inventory slot can you?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a rogue I&#39;d love to have this, I can&#39;t even count how many times I&#39;ve<br/>\neither dropped or deleted 100s of copper because I was overloaded.<br/>\n(pickpocketing tends to steal large amounts of copper)  Even if it<br/>\nreturned a fraction of the total value of the coins, it would help.  Like<br/>\nput 250 copper in there and get 2 gold back.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\ngr0k - Stranger in a Strange Land - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juju.org\">http://www.juju.org</a><br/>\nUbershadow Leprechaun - Level 28 Gnome Rogue<br/>\nUberkniggit - Level 5 Troll Shadowknight</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
