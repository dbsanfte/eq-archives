The dusters roam<br/>\naround Ak&#39;Anon and are often extremely difficult to find (very easy to kill<br/>\nthough).  Search the archives for &quot;duster&quot;, I&#39;m pretty sure somebody posted<br/>\ntheir approximate spawn points a while back.

Only one NPC responded<br/>\nto my queries, and it seemed kind of related. He told<br/>\nme that I needed to kill &quot;clockwork dusters&quot; and<br/>\nreturn their remains to him since they&#39;re obsolete.<br/>\nThis NPC is just across the water near the Mines of<br/>\nMalfunction. I looked all over for these dusters, but<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t find any, all I found were scrubbers,<br/>\ncleaners, and sweepers. If you happen to come across<br/>\nany, let me know how it turns out!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
