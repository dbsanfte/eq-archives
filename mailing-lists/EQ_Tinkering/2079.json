She was level 8 or so, and<br/>\nclaimed to have a level 48 Gnome Wizard with an almost 200 TInkering Skill.<br/>\nThis person in particular started publicly (in AUCTION and OOC) berating me<br/>\nfor trying to sell Spyglasses for 80pp, or Mechanical Lockpicks for 50pp.<br/>\nShe stated that another level 50 Gnome Tinkerer on the Karana server was<br/>\nselling those items for half that price and I was giving tinkerers a BAD<br/>\nNAME. After I started giving the person tells asking why she was trying to<br/>\nruin me financially (which is what she was doing), she gave me a tell back<br/>\nsaying my prices where ridiculous even for a person trying to recover costs.<br/>\nI was &quot;price gouging&quot; and &quot;trying to rip people off&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere comes the interesting bit. She claimed to have a primary character that<br/>\nwas a level 48 Gnome WIzard, who had an almost 200 Tinkering skill. AND she<br/>\nstated that it only cost her 400PP to get it up to 200 ! ! ! HOW in THE HELL<br/>\nis this ACCOMPLISHED?! Am I the only person who thinks this number is just<br/>\nimpossible? 400pp barely covers the cost of 2 Aqualungs, much less Cams and<br/>\nSpyglasses etc etc to get the skill 100... much less OVER 100 ! Has anyone<br/>\nelse run across a person making such FRIVILOUS claims?<br/>\n<br/>\nShe stated that she was best friends with two of the prominent highlevel<br/>\ntinkerers on the Server (Knok, and Thinktink), and that THIS mailing list<br/>\nwas &quot;total bullshit&quot; (and I quote). The mailing list was full of newbie<br/>\ngeeks who only wanted recipes for tinkering items and wheren&#39;t smart enough<br/>\nto look it up on the web.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease anyone else on Karana who reads this, respond. Let me know if you&#39;ve<br/>\nmet this person also. She/He is give us a REAL bad name.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Tuni Gearspinner<br/>\n38th Circle Gnome Mage (Karana)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
