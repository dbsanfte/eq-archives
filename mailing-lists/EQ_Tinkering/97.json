I dont think he was making it up casue he <br/>\nconfronted me about tinkering and asked if i new how to make one.  Also ive <br/>\nbeen to a few web sittes that kinda talk about it.  Its mentioned that there <br/>\nis a third componet to combine to make this staff.  To bad they wouldnt say, <br/>\nalso the priest discord has that black robe.   When i first started i thought <br/>\nit was just for show but the higher i get in levels i starting to see other <br/>\npeople wear this robe.  You can get that robe in a dungeon.   I also tried to <br/>\ncombine the skull and rune totum staff and it tells me that they dont <br/>\ncombine.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
