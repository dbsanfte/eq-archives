The Evil<br/>\n&gt; Eye is part of the Observer Staff Quest and originates at an Observitory.  The<br/>\n&gt; Telescope Lens Quest orignates in the Wizards? Guild and it requires you to get four<br/>\n&gt; lenses.  None of them are on Borxx.  Two are given to you by the observitories.  One<br/>\n&gt; is obtained by killing a 14ish (and nasty) DE in Freeport, and the last is on this<br/>\n&gt; missing gnome.  Please also note that this quest will not be given to wizards above<br/>\n&gt; level 12.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Believe it , verant has this sick and twisted thing about making quests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ungettable at higher levels, and impossible for low levels to actually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; solve, for instance this quest. one of the lens you need tog et from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Borxx, a level *30*+ Evil Eye. With verants normal sense of rewards well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get 20 exp pts, a faction adjustment and a tarnished dagger as reward,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; note this is a step up from the usual rusty dagger they give us.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  another example (again gnome) get tergons spellbook, OK this spawns on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a level 18 or so mob... your reward for solving the quest? a level 4<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mage spell.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.
