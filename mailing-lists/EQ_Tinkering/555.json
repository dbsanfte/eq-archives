I think they might know something about<br/>\ntinkering because there is one merchant there that sells a tinkerer&#39;s bag, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know what the bag does because I just don&#39;t have the 5600 platinum he<br/>\nwants for it. I can&#39;t find anything to say to get him to talk to me. I know<br/>\nthere&#39;s another gnome with a name in the room just across from the merchant<br/>\nbut unfortunately she isn&#39;t always there and I would have to destroy a<br/>\nclockwork to get her to spawn which I am personaly opposed to and when she<br/>\ndoes show up she doesn&#39;t live long because she carries a much sought after<br/>\ncloak so I haven&#39;t gotten a chance to talk to her. I got the info about the<br/>\nbait second hand so I don&#39;t know the name of the person who found the book<br/>\nto get a screenshot or even give him credit. I was told he is going to post<br/>\nthe recipes so whoever you are if you&#39;re reading this please hurry!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Ioshua &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ioshua@...\">ioshua@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you much for the hint you were given.  I&#39;ll try that as soon as<br/>\n&gt; I log in.  Why exactly do you think it&#39;s in Solusek&#39;s Eye?  What a<br/>\n&gt; horrid place to hide something like that.  Tho, on second thought it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not a bad idea.  Keep the good stuff for the brave.  As I understand<br/>\n&gt; it there is a way to tailor snakeskin gear.  I met someone who&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; friend made some.  Of course, that and the bait could be either lucky<br/>\n&gt; finds or false alltogether.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
