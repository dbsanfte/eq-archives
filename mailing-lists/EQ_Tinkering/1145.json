I decided to<br/>\ngive my hand at tinkering because I wanted to find a skill that<br/>\nwould serve some purpose to other (higher level) players.  <br/>\nI didn&#39;t want to do jewelry, because it seemed pretty overdone.<br/>\nNothing else seemed interesting, and although I read many<br/>\nposts about how useless tinkering is, I thought I would<br/>\ngive it a go anyway in hopes that it would at least provide<br/>\nsome depth of character and entertainment to me and my<br/>\nfriends.  Perhaps it will be more valuable since the<br/>\nscuba diving and Kedge Keep patch?<br/>\n<br/>\nFew questions - <br/>\n<br/>\n- Can people actually sell the stuff that they have made?<br/>\n I&#39;ve put together a couple fishing poles, but ended up <br/>\njust giving them away since no one would buy them (even at<br/>\ncost...)<br/>\n<br/>\n- With 195 int, how much money does it take to get up to<br/>\n  a reasonable tinkering skill (like 60,75,100...?)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Does anyone know if these things will become stackable?<br/>\n  I have to carry around like 8 backpacks just to practice<br/>\n  tinkering with!<br/>\n<br/>\n- Do you see any hope of this being a player valuable skill<br/>\n  besides just being a scuba gear maker?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway.. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have more questions later.  I too will be<br/>\nsearching for the scuba gear information and will post if I get it<br/>\nor any clues.<br/>\n<br/>\nShahk Sinnoyade - Seeker Of Lore<br/>\n33 Gnome Wiz from Bertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I made some fireworks for my friends going away party.  Although<br/>\n     it didn&#39;t oooo and aaahhh them, they did get a good laugh out of it<br/>\n     and had a good time...
