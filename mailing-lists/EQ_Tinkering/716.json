He and his skel monk<br/>\nfriend attacked me on site... He shouted something about hating wizards and then<br/>\nthey promptly dispatched me... I gathered a group and went and killed him... His<br/>\ndrop, gnome meat.  Yep, the group said he also dropped a nice bag sometimes.  I&#39;m<br/>\ngonna keep at him, maybe get something good... but at 27 I could enstill him and<br/>\nhit him with 3 frost shocks and he went down.. The skel monk friend is tougher...<br/>\nresisted my enstill and resisted much of my frost shocks, but we got him finally.<br/>\n<br/>\nI get experience from him, so I may just camp him if I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I got no faction hit for killing him.  I think he has something against<br/>\ngnomes.  He didnt attack our puller until he was attacked (high elf, I think)...<br/>\nwhen I went in, the both jumped me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadix/Atinky<br/>\nBristlebane server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
