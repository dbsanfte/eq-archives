Are you one of Verant&#39;s game designers, planners,<br/>\n&gt; programmers, or developers?  Are you related to any of them and they have<br/>\ntold<br/>\n&gt; you this is a fact?  Or are you as ignorant as the rest of us and just<br/>\ngoing by<br/>\n&gt; what someone told you?<br/>\n&gt; There are enough rumors and disinformation about the 3rd book, collapsible<br/>\n&gt; fishing pole, and fireworks going around that I wonder if anyone on any<br/>\nserver<br/>\n&gt; really has solid information.  Until I recieve some word by an Everquest<br/>\n&gt; programmer or developer I&#39;m keeping my mind open.<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t count any information you have been told by the guides or GM&#39;s as<br/>\n&gt; factual.  None of them created this game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joshua Bednarz wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Joshua Bednarz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thewhitemage@...\">thewhitemage@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What will it take to get it through to you guys? There is NO damn third<br/>\n&gt; &gt; book, ANY formulas for items that have been figured out how to be made,<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; &gt; any at all were figured out by trial and error. There is absolutely NO<br/>\nBOOK!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; NONE not -ANYWHERE- in the game! When there IS something will be said<br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it in the patch. Until then , just work on raising your tinkering skill,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thats all I can say, doing anything else about tinkering, like trying to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; find a non-existant book, or trying to figure out a formula with next to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nothing odds is just a TOTAL 100% waste of time!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
