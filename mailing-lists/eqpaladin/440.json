You were <br/>\n&gt; really missed ! I hope you will be done with your computer problems :)<br/>\n&gt; Those <br/>\n&gt; last weeks have been rather lonely expect for the occasional game with <br/>\n&gt; Merjol when we were on together...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now to try and answer Vilar&#39;s questions...<br/>\n&gt; Hail and welcome Vilar, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had a chance to meet you yet :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (at least not under  this name)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;can you tell me are there cap for the combat skills of us<br/>\n&gt; &gt;paladin?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aye like for every class and every (non trade) skills. Our cap for combat <br/>\n&gt; skills is I think 5*lev+5.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;If not, than is it true that we could fight as good as those<br/>\n&gt; &gt;warriors? If there are skill cap for our combat skills, well, the combat<br/>\n&gt; &gt;advantage of us would be to obtain a holy sword, am I right?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In pure melee fight, you won&#39;t be as good as a pure warrior. They will<br/>\n&gt; deal <br/>\n&gt; more damages and tank more easily (with their kick, double attack, double <br/>\n&gt; weapon, bash and all the other attacks they have). But they don&#39;t have any<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; spell, and those spells are of a huge help when you&#39;re resting between <br/>\n&gt; fights. (and even during fights at a higher level).<br/>\n&gt; As far as the holy sword is concerned, well I&#39;m lev 22 and still have to<br/>\n&gt; see <br/>\n&gt; one :) the weakest one is I think on a lev 30 monster, and I can&#39;t wait to<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; get it...<br/>\n&gt; Anyway one thing you have to realize is that in a fight, and at higher <br/>\n&gt; levels, you won&#39;t really be here to do the damage - same for the warriors.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fight with some wizards who will in two spells take half of this monster&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; hps while you can hardly do a scratch... But teach them that if they run <br/>\n&gt; away when the monster turns on them, then you can&#39;t take the monster back<br/>\n&gt; on <br/>\n&gt; you ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have a vision, sword is what we hold on our hand, but we are not fight<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with the one we are swinging, we fight with the sword in our heart and<br/>\n&gt; THAT<br/>\n&gt; &gt;should be our holy sword................<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Amen on this, sister.<br/>\n&gt; The point is to enjoy this game. Period. Personnally I do as a paladin. <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s no point in thinking this class can do this better than me, and<br/>\n&gt; this <br/>\n&gt; other can do that better. Don&#39;t worry about that, it&#39;s pretty well<br/>\n&gt; balanced.<br/>\n&gt; And don&#39;t worry too much about the holy swords. You can perform your good <br/>\n&gt; duties througout Norath, fighting undeads and evil, even without one, and <br/>\n&gt; still be good at it :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; May Brell guide your steps in the holy way of the paladinhood.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Daramar (still no-name) - dwarf paladin, fidel servant of the Duke of<br/>\n&gt; Below.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
