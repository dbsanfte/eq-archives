Zoning<br/>\ninto Unrest, you follow the tunnel (it&#39;s a sewer like<br/>\ntunnel, cool brickwork) and it opens out into a<br/>\ngrassed area with a front path that runs between a<br/>\npair of fountains/pools, then hedgemazes, then to the<br/>\nfront porch/door of the house.  If you cut left or<br/>\nright, you can go between the hedge mazes and the wall<br/>\nto reach either side of the yard.  Heading right<br/>\nyou&#39;ll find the gazebo; left you find the porch<br/>\nentrance to the house, and both meet in the back at<br/>\nthe (oddly enough) back door.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the yard surrounding the house is the &#39;yard trash&#39;,<br/>\nDeath Beetles, Jack-o-Lanterns, the occasional ghoul,<br/>\nGreater Skeletons and Tormented Undead; all in the<br/>\n10-13 -ish- range.  Death Beetles will train onto you<br/>\nif you&#39;re fighting undead, as will the other undead<br/>\nnear your fight if not otherwise occupied.  A full low<br/>\nlevel group (your level) can do pretty well cleaning<br/>\nup the yard trash if you play smart.  You&#39;ll also be<br/>\nthe love of the zone, as the higher levels get really<br/>\ntired of pulling higher level stuff (20+ Lvl mobs<br/>\noftentimes) from the house and getting bogged down<br/>\nwith a handful of yard trash.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt about 15-18 -ish-, in a full group, you can start<br/>\npulling from the first floor.  19-23 -ish-, in a full<br/>\ngroup, you can pull from the 1st or 2nd floors (but<br/>\nmake better loot and xp from the 2nd)<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t fought the 3rd floor or basement yet, but I<br/>\nunderstand about 24-28 -ish--, in a full group, can<br/>\nfight the third floor stuff; and that 29-35 -ish-, in<br/>\na full group, can fight in the basement.  Beware the<br/>\nHag, uber nasty undead necromatic caster (with charm<br/>\nand some really mean direct damage spells).<br/>\n<br/>\nDrybone Skeletons and above (Skeletal Monks, I think,<br/>\nand Barbed Bone Skeletons) drop small bronze.  A lot<br/>\nof things in the zone drop small rawhide and small<br/>\nringmail; and Carrion Ghouls and some other things<br/>\ndrop runes/words/pages, as well as Fine Steel weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnrest isn&#39;t a terribly hard zone to find a group in;<br/>\nthough sometimes you may have to be patient for a<br/>\nwhile.  DON&#39;T solo here, even 20th Levels can have<br/>\nproblems trying to solo yard trash because more keeps<br/>\njumping in the fights.  Fight at least in a pair, but<br/>\noften you&#39;ll be in full groups, which is the only way<br/>\nto fight Unrest.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can walk into the zone in full leather and be in<br/>\nfull metal (ring and/or bronze) after a few days;<br/>\nlonger for full bronze.  Most of the Unrest loot sells<br/>\npretty well in Butcherblock and Greater Faydark; how<br/>\nelse do you think low levels (sub 11 or so) get their<br/>\nhands on rawhide and ringmail, and fine steel weapons?<br/>\n Also, if you&#39;re a sub level looking for rawhide, ring<br/>\nor fine steel, take cash and head to Unrest; a lot of<br/>\nplayers will be happy to unload the encumberance for<br/>\ncase right there.  You can get some good deals.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best part of Unrest is no annoying doors and keys<br/>\nto deal with.  Befallen is seriously handicapped as a<br/>\nfun zone because of the key thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
