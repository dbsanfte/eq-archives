I found that Faydwer was lacking in<br/>\nexp and money at my level, but now that I have a magical weapon, I may try<br/>\nDagnor&#39;s Cauldron when I get back home. I hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nEglath, level 15 High Elf Paladin<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;By G&#39;Quon, I cannot remember the last time I was in a fight like that! No<br/>\nmoral ambiguity.

My primary hunting grounds right now are the Aqua-Goblins<br/>\n&gt; (big group only) and Unrest. The problem I am facing is even though I have<br/>\n&gt; all the spells for 15th lvl and I have a majority of metal armor (some is<br/>\n&gt; still leather) I can&#39;t seem to make any real money. I have noticed a great<br/>\n&gt; need for a combine weapon but at my present rate it will take literally<br/>\n&gt; forever. I tend to hunt in groups of 3 or 4 and generally for around 5 hours<br/>\n&gt; a day. I guess what I would like to know is, Am I doing something wrong? or<br/>\n&gt; is everyone broke at this lvl? Is there a better spot to hunt?
