One time he stays<br/>\nfor a while, at least 5 minutes, the other time he is there for only about<br/>\n30 seconds.  I used to spend a lot of time there, and found that going in<br/>\naround midnight and waiting was the best plan.  However, seeing as they have<br/>\nchanged almost everything else in this quest (spawn rates and such) this all<br/>\ncould have changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the bartender not selling to you, I have not has this problem, but<br/>\nwill check around to see if someone has found a way to get him on your good<br/>\nside.<br/>\n<br/>\nAvron wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Avron &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:avron@...\">avron@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am in the part of the quest where I am supposed to meet Tykar Renlin<br/>\n&gt; in the Seafarers Roost inn, but I have searched it thouroughly and he<br/>\n&gt; was not there, does he only come at a certain time or do I need to do<br/>\n&gt; something to make him come?<br/>\n&gt; Also my faction with the innkeepers is so that I cannot trade with them,<br/>\n&gt; I am KOS by freeport militia aswell, and this has REALLY made the quest<br/>\n&gt; hard to do, I don&#39;t even want to think about how I am supposed to get<br/>\n&gt; into the dungeon and meet Zimel hehe.
