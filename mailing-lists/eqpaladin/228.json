I was lead to believe that we get bash at level 12.<br/>\n&gt;Well, my half-elf paladin, Abrell, who has felt stuck at level 8 forever<br/>\n&gt;went to visit his trainer out of curiosity and being bored. He saw that he<br/>\n&gt;could now train in bash. I spent 1 point in it and went to BB to try it <br/>\n&gt;out.<br/>\n&gt;Well, it works. My question is when did they change the level requirements<br/>\n&gt;for bash?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Want to learn more about your list users?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Now you can with our new User Survey Tool - see homepage for details<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
