There are few facts<br/>\nor actual stats that &#39;prove&#39; one is &#39;better&#39; than the<br/>\nother.  Here are the facts that are known and<br/>\nunbiased.<br/>\n<br/>\nTypically, 1H weapons have a lower delay than 2H<br/>\nweapons.  This is significant because you&#39;ll swing<br/>\nmore often with a lower delay weapon (this is why<br/>\nwatching Monks fight can be rather stunning, because<br/>\nfists have a very low delay in the combat system).  If<br/>\nyou&#39;re fighting something that you will miss often<br/>\nagainst, you may want to swing more often (more<br/>\nswings), because it gives you more opportunities to<br/>\nconnect even amid the misses.  In other words: if you<br/>\nget 25 swings in a fight, and miss with half; you only<br/>\nhit 12-13 times.  If, however, you get 40 swings in a<br/>\nfight, you hit 20 times.  Sometimes, especially<br/>\nagainst casters, this is vastly preferable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen comparing weapons, use the DD ratio (Damage to<br/>\nDelay) to determine how they stack up against one<br/>\nanother.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the low end, the weapons are rougly equal.  When<br/>\nyou start comparing various mid and high end weapons<br/>\nof various sources and magicks, the ratios start to<br/>\ndiverge from one another.  For example, the famed<br/>\nWarrior only Executioner Axe (2h-s) is 25/50 .500; a<br/>\n*phenomonal* efficiency.  Ghoulbane (1h-s), Paladins<br/>\nonly, is 15-34 .411.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all hard fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe murky part, subjective part, is the rest of it. <br/>\nSome people just flat out like the &#39;sexy&#39; factor of<br/>\nseeing a *big* number in the damage line when they see<br/>\none of their swings connect.  Others are simply<br/>\nlooking for a weapon that will deal out significant<br/>\ndamage over a series of swings.  The former look<br/>\nalmost exclusively at 2h, the latter at mostly 1h.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, when using 2h, you give up a shield.  Not<br/>\nonly are you giving up the AC, but you also give up an<br/>\nenchantment slot (like with the Darkwood&#39;s +9 STR, for<br/>\nexample), and as a Paladin, you give up your only<br/>\nspecial attack (Bash).  Warriors are better equipped<br/>\nto go with 2h because they retain Kick and (if large)<br/>\nSlam.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, you have a lot to weigh.  An *excellent* low level<br/>\nweapon, and a perfectly servicable mid level weapon is<br/>\none with a .200 - .300 ratio.  For example:<br/>\n<br/>\nFS (or Combine) Longsword = 6/28 .214<br/>\nMinotaur Axe = 8/37 .216 (note Mino axe is 1/3rd<br/>\nslower)<br/>\nDwarven 1h Axe = 6/26 .231 (faster than FS LS)<br/>\nBarbed Leather Whip = 7/28 .250 (very fast, good<br/>\ndamage)<br/>\nDemon Claw = 5/19 .263 (incredibly fast)<br/>\n<br/>\n*typically* (but not exclusively), Bash weapons (1h or<br/>\n2H) tend to have lower efficiency ratios than<br/>\nequilivant leveled weapons on the Slashing side. <br/>\nExamples:<br/>\n<br/>\nStaff = 5/28 .179<br/>\nWarhammer = 6/32 .188<br/>\nScreaming Mace = 8/35 .229<br/>\nDwarven Warhammer = 8/33 .242<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, with blunt, you&#39;ll usually work harder in the<br/>\nfight.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, even as a dwarf, you&#39;re best served by<br/>\nstarting the level-capping of relevant weapons skills<br/>\nnow, as you go up.  Even if you don&#39;t &#39;finish&#39; capping<br/>\nbefore you level again, keep working the skills you<br/>\nchoose to work up.  If you get behind by a few levels<br/>\nin 2hs or 1hb or whatever while you&#39;re leveling up,<br/>\ndon&#39;t let it concern you overly; just keep switching<br/>\nback to your primary after each level and capping that<br/>\nout first, then going back to wherever you left off<br/>\nthe secondaries.  By the time you hit the double<br/>\ndigits (10+), your skills will catch up.  And it&#39;s far<br/>\neasier to maintain for 5 points per level than it is<br/>\nto train up 30 or 50 or whatever points after you find<br/>\na really great weapon that you want to start using.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
