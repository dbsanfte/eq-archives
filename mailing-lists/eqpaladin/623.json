Currently my dwarf has 117 dex and when one<br/>\nhanded he uses the PGT/DW Shield combo.

If I switch to a shiny brass halberd then I<br/>\n&gt;am<br/>\n&gt;&gt; walking away from 1-handed slashing skill which will need to be made up<br/>\n&gt;&gt; after I do get ghoulbane.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Are there any other weapon/shield combos I am overlooking that actually<br/>\n&gt;&gt; worked for some of you more accomplished Paladins?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Again, thanks everybody for the input.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Kaladin, 17th level Paladin (who is not well known for hiding in safe<br/>\n&gt;&gt; corners of Norrath)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Nicholas20@...\">Nicholas20@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Nicholas20@...\">Nicholas20@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; True the druid can &quot;sneak&quot; the paladin down and the paladin can &quot;hide&quot;<br/>\n&gt;in the &quot;safe&quot; corner while his friends do the work and then hand him a<br/>\n&gt;weapon he did nothing to earn, but any paladin worth a grain of salt who<br/>\n&gt;uses these techniques I don&#39;t feel they deserve one.
