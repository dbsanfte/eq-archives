I am currently a lvl 12 (1<br/>\nbubble to 13th) High <br/>\nElf Paladin currently operating on the Cazic Thule server on the continent<br/>\nof Faydwer and <br/>\nI made a horrible mistake. I rushed into joining a guild not knowing what<br/>\ntype of people <br/>\nthe guild was and more wanting brotherhood then anything else. To my horror<br/>\nI realized I <br/>\nhad joined a gang of petty kill stealing, cheat exploiting, bug exploiting<br/>\nthugs. My problem <br/>\nis that the guild officers refuse to allow me to leave the guild and was<br/>\nhoping someone <br/>\ncould tell me a way that I can quit the guild without being removed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all and may Tunare bless you all and may your blades find there<br/>\nmark <br/>\nSol</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
