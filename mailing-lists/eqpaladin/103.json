Nothing really powerfull, I&#39;m only 10th lvl right<br/>\n&gt;now, I just need something that will do damage to iceboned skeletons and<br/>\n&gt;ghouls. Also, I seem to be making money very slowly. The only trade skills<br/>\n&gt;I have are cooking and a little blacksmithing. Is there a good zone to<br/>\n&gt;make money in? The most money I have ever had at one time is 8 pp! Is this<br/>\n&gt;normal or am I going about things all wrong?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Gypsy camps usually have a vendor selling Combine weapons, which are<br/>\nmagical, lighter than their steel counterparts, and faster.  However, they<br/>\nusually cost in the range of 30-90 pp, depending on what you&#39;re looking<br/>\nfor.  Personally, I saved up 43 pp for a Combine Scimitar and I like it<br/>\nmuch better than my mino axe, plus it can hit all the nasties like wisps,<br/>\nghouls, and iceboned skeletons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as what zone to make money in, I don&#39;t really have any suggestions<br/>\nfor you.  Going after any MOB with a weapon nets you that weapon, which is<br/>\nusually good for at least a couple of gold.  Are you spending your money on<br/>\narmor and such as you go along?  I usually save up for things that I want,<br/>\nlike the Combine weapon, rather than spend money as I get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLorimi<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
