The NPC says that you <br/>\ncan only take the test of truth once and tarantulas should be EASY for you <br/>\nfirst.  Has anyone completed this successfully?  If so, what level should I be <br/>\nto do it?  Is it useful to bring a spell caster to help out with it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I heard is that this quest really ticks off the freeport <br/>\nmilitia to the point where you become Kill on Sight.  Every paladin operating <br/>\nnear freeport should know that there are fake walls out past the gate that can <br/>\nbe used to get into the catacombs and sewers and thus get to the bank and guild <br/>\nwithout too much trouble.  The one for north freeport is on the north side wall <br/>\noutside the gate in west commons.  it is the wall that runs east west.<br/>\n<br/>\nDan Kassiday<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kassiday@...\">kassiday@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clark.net/pub/kassiday\">http://www.clark.net/pub/kassiday</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
