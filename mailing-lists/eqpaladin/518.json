North Karana has lots of borer and Scythe Beetles and Griffawns to take on, (still havent managed to do a Griffawn myself without lay hands yet).  In East Karana there are lots of blue baddies, from Griff&#39;s to gorge hounds to Chasam crawlers. I hope this helps you out.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFattyBear 18th \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  Where is a good place for a 18th lvl paladin to go solo blues? I have travelled\r<br/>\n  some and cant find a place that is either WAY to crowded or that you MUST have a\r<br/>\n  group to survive the trains. I am on the MM server and am currently in Freeport.\r<br/>\n  ANy and all help is appreciated as I am starting to get bored and want to keep\r<br/>\n  playing. Thanks all.\r<br/>\n  Frett</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
