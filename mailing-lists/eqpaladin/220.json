Not really sure, but perhaps a bunch of 15s could take em.  When <br/>\nmy friends (cleric, ranger, monk) went there they killed him 5 times, he <br/>\ncarried a sword each time and it was rusty each time.  What I figure is that <br/>\neither the killer MUST be a paladin or that the group responsible for the <br/>\nkill must have a paladin inside it.  I have yet to goto Guk, and frankly I <br/>\ndon&#39;t look forward to having to dodge the troll bashers, so I am unable to <br/>\nprove or disprove my two theories. <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-Adaron</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
