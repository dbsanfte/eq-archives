When you have a new ability, you must spend at least one practice<br/>\npoint to learn it. And your guildmaster says &quot;You have learnt the basics<br/>\nof...&quot;. It seems that you then have a base that equals to your level. THEN<br/>\nit can increase by itself. But it sometimes depends of the ability.

So it may seem that you can&#39;t use a spell or that it is not<br/>\nworking well, but you need to practice it with the Guildmaster at least once<br/>\nto kind of &quot;kick start&quot; the spell.  This is the way it has worked for me.<br/>\nIf anyone has any more information on practicing and spells, let me know.  I<br/>\nam just about to go to level 11 and will be curious as to where to utilize<br/>\nmy practices.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrod<br/>\n10th Level Paladin (almost 11)<br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
