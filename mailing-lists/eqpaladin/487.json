Don&#39;t go <br/>\nto Befallen or Unrest without one.  The ice boned and dry boned skeletons <br/>\ncan only be hit by magic and are nasty enough to be a tough fight even with <br/>\na magic weapon.  I wouldn&#39;t want to go against one of those guys without <br/>\nanything but my hardest hitting weapon.  I think I started seeing a lot of <br/>\nthem around level 16 or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I never even bought the weapon summoning spells because I had my <br/>\ncombine by then, could never keep my 1-H blunt trained up, and would do more <br/>\ndamage with my magic sword anyway.  I have not missed those spells.  I <br/>\nalways have backup weapons in the bank for when I die and lately (level 20) <br/>\noften have a magic backup weapon tucked away.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Gary Long &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:glong@...\">glong@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqpaladin] magic only creatures - my solution and question<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 11 Jun 1999 09:31:22 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Gary Long &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:glong@...\">glong@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I use a minotaur axe/targ shield combo 99% of the time, but should I need <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;attack or defend against a creature only hit by magic weapons then I haul <br/>\n&gt;out<br/>\n&gt;my trusty staff or dagger (fang?) summoned by a friendly magician and <br/>\n&gt;commence<br/>\n&gt;wacking the baddie.  It would be nice to have the combine longsword or some<br/>\n&gt;other decent magical weapon, but I&#39;m still about 50 platinum short, what <br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;having to buy armor, arrows, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The staff is nice - dmg 8, delay 40? - and my skill is going steadily up in <br/>\n&gt;2H<br/>\n&gt;blunt.  The summoned dagger is decent as well (dmg 4, delay 21?) but <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t do<br/>\n&gt;nearly enough damage when hunting wisps or scarecrows. I&#39;m also working on<br/>\n&gt;pushing 1H blunt up for when I can summon the mace in four levels.  If I<br/>\n&gt;*really* want to, I could go punish bandits with a wizard friend in the <br/>\n&gt;karanas<br/>\n&gt;and have that combine longsword in a week.  The thing is, I don&#39;t usually <br/>\n&gt;hunt<br/>\n&gt;for creatures hit by magic only because there&#39;s so many critters running <br/>\n&gt;round<br/>\n&gt;that don&#39;t have that limitation!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So here&#39;s a question for you higher-level paladins (16th and over) - at <br/>\n&gt;what<br/>\n&gt;level does it become necessary to have a magic weapon, and can the <br/>\n&gt;situations<br/>\n&gt;that require a magic weapon be handled by our summoned mace?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kaladin, the curious 11th level Paladin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;          Gary Long, Vice President, Valley Internet Services<br/>\n&gt;          ...Web Commerce is what we do, all day every day...<br/>\n&gt;Ph:(916)498-1920 Fax:(916)498-1932  1611 S St #202 Sacramento,CA 95814<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.valley-internet.com\">http://www.valley-internet.com</a> -  For all your business hosting needs.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.securetrans.com\">http://www.securetrans.com</a> -  Accept credit cards online in real-time!<br/>\n&gt;______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;With more than 20 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;....ONElist is home to the liveliest discussions on the Internet!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
