I don&#39;t use a shield so I have been using a<br/>\nrusty 2hander I found when I was lvl 4. It has served me well and now my<br/>\n2H slash is much higher than my 1H.

I once saw a screenshot of Aradune wearing full <br/>\n&gt; green plate and the 2 handed Fiery Avenger. Is that an only paladin <br/>\n&gt; weapon, because I heard that when they tested it in the Beta, many <br/>\n&gt; classes could use it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Elthain of Felwithe<br/>\n&gt; Paladin of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
