You were <br/>\nreally missed ! I hope you will be done with your computer problems :) Those <br/>\nlast weeks have been rather lonely expect for the occasional game with <br/>\nMerjol when we were on together...<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to try and answer Vilar&#39;s questions...<br/>\nHail and welcome Vilar, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had a chance to meet you yet :) <br/>\n(at least not under  this name)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;can you tell me are there cap for the combat skills of us<br/>\n&gt;paladin?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Aye like for every class and every (non trade) skills. Our cap for combat <br/>\nskills is I think 5*lev+5.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If not, than is it true that we could fight as good as those<br/>\n&gt;warriors? If there are skill cap for our combat skills, well, the combat<br/>\n&gt;advantage of us would be to obtain a holy sword, am I right?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In pure melee fight, you won&#39;t be as good as a pure warrior. They will deal <br/>\nmore damages and tank more easily (with their kick, double attack, double <br/>\nweapon, bash and all the other attacks they have). But they don&#39;t have any <br/>\nspell, and those spells are of a huge help when you&#39;re resting between <br/>\nfights. (and even during fights at a higher level).<br/>\nAs far as the holy sword is concerned, well I&#39;m lev 22 and still have to see <br/>\none :) the weakest one is I think on a lev 30 monster, and I can&#39;t wait to <br/>\nget it...<br/>\nAnyway one thing you have to realize is that in a fight, and at higher <br/>\nlevels, you won&#39;t really be here to do the damage - same for the warriors. <br/>\nFight with some wizards who will in two spells take half of this monster&#39;s <br/>\nhps while you can hardly do a scratch... But teach them that if they run <br/>\naway when the monster turns on them, then you can&#39;t take the monster back on <br/>\nyou ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have a vision, sword is what we hold on our hand, but we are not fight<br/>\n&gt;with the one we are swinging, we fight with the sword in our heart and THAT<br/>\n&gt;should be our holy sword................<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Amen on this, sister.<br/>\nThe point is to enjoy this game. Period. Personnally I do as a paladin. <br/>\nThere&#39;s no point in thinking this class can do this better than me, and this <br/>\nother can do that better. Don&#39;t worry about that, it&#39;s pretty well balanced.<br/>\nAnd don&#39;t worry too much about the holy swords. You can perform your good <br/>\nduties througout Norath, fighting undeads and evil, even without one, and <br/>\nstill be good at it :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMay Brell guide your steps in the holy way of the paladinhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaramar (still no-name) - dwarf paladin, fidel servant of the Duke of Below.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
