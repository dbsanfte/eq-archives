If you so agree<br/>\n </span></blockquote>he<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;tells you to bring him an orc oracle scroll. These scrolls are only found<br/>\n </span></blockquote>on<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;oracles that spawn in and near the orc castle in crushbone (I have never<br/>\n&gt;witnessed nor heard of one spawning in the village).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Problems:<br/>\n&gt;1) These oracles in crushbone are incredibly difficult to kill and should<br/>\n&gt;only be attempted at lvl 10 plus<br/>\n&gt;2) Most often you will have to engage the oracle as well as several<br/>\n&gt;legionnaires and many of the other castle inhabitants (Royal Guards,<br/>\n&gt;Prophet, Emissary, Emperor Crush and don&#39;t forget Dvinn)...All of which are<br/>\n&gt;incredibly difficult to defeat and I have only seen players defeat Dvinn<br/>\n&gt;once and heard of another time but never solo.<br/>\n&gt;3) The reward from this quest was roughly 12 silver and some exp (not a<br/>\n&gt;noticeable gain at lvl 11)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Notes:<br/>\n&gt;After returning the scroll and completing the quest he did say that it was<br/>\n&gt;too bad I wasn&#39;t a defender. Not sure what was meant by that. All in all I<br/>\n&gt;would suggest that if you get a scroll while out adventuring you made 12<br/>\n&gt;silver and a little exp but I would not go out of your way to complete this<br/>\n&gt;quest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Silvermyst<br/>\n&gt;High Elf Paladin 11th Order<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;P.S.
