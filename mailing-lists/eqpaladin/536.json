This is ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-971624791\">Check out EQ&#39;Lizer.   They have posted a new item:  Short Sword of Yakesha.<br/>\nExtremely nice sword, probably as powerful as some of the Holy Swords.   This is<br/>\nnot a quest item.  It is just on a rare spawn at an unknown location.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal feelings about the Holy Swords is that Verant should send us a free<br/>\ncoupon for Vasaline<br/>\nfor even attempting to acquire a Holy Sword.  No other weapons that are<br/>\navailable to other classes are<br/>\nas difficult to get.  They should make a new lower level Holy Sword for us just<br/>\nto keep us equal to the<br/>\nother classes.  For example, Soulfire, I would assume this is a &quot;lower&quot; level<br/>\nholy sword.  I could not start<br/>\nthe quest at level 18.  What a joke!  The SK that has the Hilt is level 40+ in<br/>\nMistmoore and they won&#39;t let<br/>\nme start the quest at level 18?   Go figure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am starting to believe that Brad McQuaid and Verant are just playing with us<br/>\nPaladins.  Pretending that<br/>\nwe are one of the best classes and have the ability at obtaining the most<br/>\npowerful weapons in the game<br/>\n -- SO FAR THEY DON&#39;T EXIST.  Every damn Holy Sword known is on a mob or<br/>\ncreature level 30+.   For<br/>\ninstance Ghoulbane:  You have to kill a Holy Knight to get a Holy Sword.   Isn&#39;t<br/>\n killing a Paladin the<br/>\nopposite of being a Paladin (aka ShadowKnight)?  Then there is another Holy<br/>\nSword (don&#39;t know the<br/>\nname) is on a 40+ SK in the underground of Freeport.  BTW, it has 2 high level<br/>\nmobs protecting it also.<br/>\nThe stats on that sword are not too impressive either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just want to thank Brad McQuaid and the Verant staff for putting these<br/>\nludicrous ideas in our heads for<br/>\nobtaining class specific weapons that either do not exist or are too difficult<br/>\nto obtain it makes it almost not<br/>\nworth it.  And, by the time we can acquire them, they are of little improvement<br/>\nto us because of the level we<br/>\nmust be at to obtain them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinal thoughts:  Maybe to help us Paladins, Verant should not give us a 25% EXP<br/>\npenalty, rather give us<br/>\na 25% bonus for being stupid enough in believing the Holy Swords are special.<br/>\nThe only thing so<br/>\nspecial about them is that we can&#39;t attain them.  When do Paladins become<br/>\nequals-- in the planes?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 cp for ranting and raving purposes only.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
