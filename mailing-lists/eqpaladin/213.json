This list is kinda on the quiet side and i was hoping to help incite<br/>\n&gt; some life into it.  If something interesting happened to you on day while<br/>\n&gt; playing or you ran across something cool or you just have a<br/>\nquestion...share<br/>\n&gt; it with all here. I myself like hearing about someone&#39;s interesting<br/>\n&gt; experience as I might learn something from it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, i forgot to tell why I chose a paladin. To me, a paladin is like a<br/>\n&gt; knight in shining armor.... swooping in to save the day and all that. They<br/>\n&gt; are like a super-hero. Me, i like sharing and helping others and most<br/>\nexpect<br/>\n&gt; a paladin to do just that . I want to be that knight coming to save the<br/>\n&gt; day.. fight against insurmountable odds so your friends can live to fight<br/>\n&gt; another day. I chose Half-Elf because high elves and Erudites are too<br/>\n&gt; conceited, Dwarves are too short(no offense intended) and I play a human<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; RL.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                                                     Abrell of Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Wanting to get back in touch with old friends?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Reunite through a ONElist community.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
