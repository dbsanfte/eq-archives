My primary hunting grounds right now are the Aqua-Goblins<br/>\n&gt;(big group only) and Unrest. The problem I am facing is even though I have<br/>\n&gt;all the spells for 15th lvl and I have a majority of metal armor (some is<br/>\n&gt;still leather) I can&#39;t seem to make any real money. I have noticed a great<br/>\n&gt;need for a combine weapon but at my present rate it will take literally<br/>\n&gt;forever. I tend to hunt in groups of 3 or 4 and generally for around 5<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hours<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;a day.
