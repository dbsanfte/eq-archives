But!  The peril you encounter along the<br/>\n&gt; way!  The friends you make and the enemies you earn!  Much more exciting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And yes, after a long hiatus from my Paladin, I made the newbie<br/>\n&gt; (no offense)<br/>\n&gt; mistake of hitting LOH when the monster was still targeted.  My solution<br/>\n&gt; (works for me, at least) is that I moved the hotbutton from the first bank<br/>\n&gt; of buttons with my combat buttons to the second one, so that when<br/>\n&gt; I think to<br/>\n&gt; change button banks I also think to change targets.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; May Tunare bless and keep you (and Erollisi Marr, although now in Final we<br/>\n&gt; high elves aren&#39;t permitted to worship her as Paladins... *grumble*)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What was YOUR favorite part?!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Tell other Star Wars fans at ONElist!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
