However, I have been spending a lot of time at levels 10 and 11<br/>\nin the Everfrost Peaks, soloing the snow leopards, orc troopers, and giant wooly<br/>\nspiders, and grouping for orc mountaineers and mammoth calves.  Ice bone<br/>\nskeletons do wander the area, sometimes in groups of 2 or 3, and it can be<br/>\nfrustrating to know that I am dead meat unless somebody saves you by casting<br/>\nspirit of the Wolf, or by taking on the ice bone (which cons white to me).  The<br/>\nlast time this happened, i tried casting Spook the Dead at it, but it just<br/>\nresisted the spell and kept on beating me to death, 14hp at a time. That was a<br/>\nlong, painful, ugly death. Needless to say, this was before I started carrying<br/>\nthe magician-summoned staff.  I have gone up a level as well since then, so<br/>\nhopefully my spooky spell will work at least once, and until it does I can at<br/>\nleast be beating it back a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, 2Hblunt is 26, 1Hblunt is 44, 1Hslash is 64, bash is 64.  I can<br/>\nsolo blue-con giant spiders with the 2H staff and have 2 bubbles of health left,<br/>\nso I really hope that, should I absolutely need it, I can use LoH combined with<br/>\n2H staff and the occasional heal spell to survive a single ice bone skeleton<br/>\nonslaught.  I don&#39;t want to test this theory, but it does give me some hope!<br/>\n<br/>\nDrive back the legions of undead for me until I am strong enough to join you!<br/>\n<br/>\nYour magic deficient Dwarven Paladin friend,<br/>\nKaladin<br/>\n<br/>\nKen Cosner wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Ken Cosner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kencosner@...\">kencosner@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A lot of the higher level undead can only be hit by magic weapons.  Don&#39;t go<br/>\n&gt; to Befallen or Unrest without one.  The ice boned and dry boned skeletons<br/>\n&gt; can only be hit by magic and are nasty enough to be a tough fight even with<br/>\n&gt; a magic weapon.  I wouldn&#39;t want to go against one of those guys without<br/>\n&gt; anything but my hardest hitting weapon.  I think I started seeing a lot of<br/>\n&gt; them around level 16 or so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By the way, I never even bought the weapon summoning spells because I had my<br/>\n&gt; combine by then, could never keep my 1-H blunt trained up, and would do more<br/>\n&gt; damage with my magic sword anyway.  I have not missed those spells.  I<br/>\n&gt; always have backup weapons in the bank for when I die and lately (level 20)<br/>\n&gt; often have a magic backup weapon tucked away.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Gary Long &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:glong@...\">glong@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [eqpaladin] magic only creatures - my solution and question<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 11 Jun 1999 09:31:22 -0700<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Gary Long &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:glong@...\">glong@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I use a minotaur axe/targ shield combo 99% of the time, but should I need<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;attack or defend against a creature only hit by magic weapons then I haul<br/>\n&gt; &gt;out<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my trusty staff or dagger (fang?) summoned by a friendly magician and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;commence<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wacking the baddie.  It would be nice to have the combine longsword or some<br/>\n&gt; &gt;other decent magical weapon, but I&#39;m still about 50 platinum short, what<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;having to buy armor, arrows, etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The staff is nice - dmg 8, delay 40? - and my skill is going steadily up in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2H<br/>\n&gt; &gt;blunt.  The summoned dagger is decent as well (dmg 4, delay 21?) but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;doesn&#39;t do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;nearly enough damage when hunting wisps or scarecrows. I&#39;m also working on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;pushing 1H blunt up for when I can summon the mace in four levels.  If I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;*really* want to, I could go punish bandits with a wizard friend in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;karanas<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and have that combine longsword in a week.  The thing is, I don&#39;t usually<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hunt<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for creatures hit by magic only because there&#39;s so many critters running<br/>\n&gt; &gt;round<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that don&#39;t have that limitation!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So here&#39;s a question for you higher-level paladins (16th and over) - at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what<br/>\n&gt; &gt;level does it become necessary to have a magic weapon, and can the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;situations<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that require a magic weapon be handled by our summoned mace?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Kaladin, the curious 11th level Paladin<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;          Gary Long, Vice President, Valley Internet Services<br/>\n&gt; &gt;          ...Web Commerce is what we do, all day every day...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Ph:(916)498-1920 Fax:(916)498-1932  1611 S St #202 Sacramento,CA 95814<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.valley-internet.com\">http://www.valley-internet.com</a> -  For all your business hosting needs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.securetrans.com\">http://www.securetrans.com</a> -  Accept credit cards online in real-time!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;With more than 20 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;....ONElist is home to the liveliest discussions on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
