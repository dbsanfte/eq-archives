I have travelled the honourable road for many days.  Ye sound true of blade and spirit so I shall pass to ye what I know. Ye","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1045399507\">Hail Elven Brother and Well Met!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have travelled the honourable road for many days.  Ye sound true of blade and spirit so I shall pass to ye what I know.<br/>\n<br/>\nYe should ensure that ye collect the pelts of the wolf and call for a tailor to cover thine person with patches lest ye fall to the filthy marauding orcs near Kelethin.  &#39;Tis fair for one to buy a collection of armour patterns from Beyond Faydark in our home town of Fair Felwithe and to ask the populace.  Make sure ye tip well and not get disappointed if the fair tailor fails and ye buys another pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow armoured, and sporting a rusty weapon from a skeleton or pawn no doubt, travel to Kelethin.  On the third lift ye shall find many people resting at the guards for just beyond along the road ye shall find orcs in great numbers, hatching some evil plan.  Do not venture far at this point, and return to the guards to assist you.  Party well with mages and clerics.  Ye do not have your own healing yet, &#39;cept the life saving lay hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs ye rises ye shall find the orc camp too easy.  At 8, ye will need to party at the nearby entrance to Crushbone to take the stronger centurions in groups of 2 (left side) or 3 (right sight).  A friendly cleric who can lull will do well - at 8 or 9 these entrance centurions are still formidable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 9, if ye be strong of spirit, ye should seek out centurions inside Crushbone.  Beware of powerful legionnaires, and stay close to the zone boundary.  Watch out for the words &quot;train&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you progress, and your pockets line with platinum, ye should take (in order):<br/>\n* centurion<br/>\n* slavers<br/>\n* trainer (in a group) - this guy has the shiny AC10 shield so many sport, as do I<br/>\n* legionnaires<br/>\n* emissary (around the castle, and inside)<br/>\n* warlord (around the castle, and inside) - carries bracers of battle<br/>\n<br/>\nFear D&#39;Vinn, fear Crush, fear The Prophet... until ye be strong (L16+, unless grouped).  I hast taken all of these in my youth at 16 or below, in a group.  Note that mages be of little use until 15+ on these.<br/>\n<br/>\nYe may find the chessboard in Butcherblock a useful change during this time, but ye should be wary of the powerful undead king.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf ye hast a cleric for a friend, at 15 ye should venture to the Estate of Unrest beyond the deadly Dagnors Cauldron at take apart undead with your new ward spell.  &#39;Tis powerful magic - it does 41hp of damage each hit at L15, and you hit often and quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo cross Dagnors Cauldron, best be made invisible by enchanter or druid.  If ye hast a fair druid as an ally ye can also see the marvels of levitation!  &#39;Tis powerful magic to float above them youngsters who stare in awe.  Reason thou art best to be unseen is dreaded aqua goblin lords, bosuns and shaman - they hit hard, and even if ye can match them they flee quickly to the water and disappear, leaving you with naught to show from taking a terrible risk.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnrest you shall see for many a day.  Beware the monks, beware the hags... take tormented dead and greater skeletons until ye amass a surname, or powerful friends.  Ye may gain great use of your Hammer of Wrath in Unrest against ghouls until ye gain other weaponry (but probably much later in levels), so do not spare using a rusty mace from time to time to be better at bashing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFare thee well, brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nLlorfindal<br/>\nHigh Elf Paladin of Tunare<br/>\nTunare Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Syrel Feyn [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:syrel@...\">syrel@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, 19 April 1999 4:41 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqpaladin] Greetings from a Paladin in Training<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Syrel Feyn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:syrel@...\">syrel@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings Brothers and Sisters!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Syrel Feyn and I am hailing to you from the gem of Faydwer,<br/>\nFelwithe.
