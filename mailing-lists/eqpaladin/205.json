The <br/>\nonly one I know of is the shiney shield that can be obtained off a trainer <br/>\norc in CB.  Are there any others around?  Can you actually buy one from a <br/>\nvender?  Our bash is a great addition to our attacks, but unless your shield <br/>\nis magic, you will be unable to hit invulnerable creatures such as ghouls <br/>\nand iceboned skeletons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nBronze (Povar)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
