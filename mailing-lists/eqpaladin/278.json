I have heard that you retrieve this off a fierce red dragon.  Presumably this dragon is located in Solusek.<br/>\n<br/>\nA third holy sword is Soulfire.  This requires you to defeat Pietro Zarn in Freeport, as part of the Zimel&#39;s blades quest.  Again, another L50 pipe dream.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow... I have heard that there is another holy sword - the fourth in the collection.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any information on this fourth sword?<br/>\n<br/>\nI can speculate that it&#39;s in the depths of Unrest - the underground level is fierce indeed, at least to mine eyes - or Mistmoore.  Each would surely prove worthy locations for a paladin to claim the ultimate prize.<br/>\n<br/>\nLlorfindal<br/>\nHigh Elf Paladin of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
