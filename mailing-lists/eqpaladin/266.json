I&#39;m only L22, and I already have more tentacle whips than I need;<br/>\n* when I was L15, I didn&#39;t have a magical weapon, and didn&#39;t have much of a need for one either.  At L15 though, with Hammer of Wrath, you do get a magical weapon and I used that to fight undead in Unrest from 15 - 20.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, I think they have the game balance pretty good - by the time that you have the capability to fight ghouls, you&#39;ve probably got enough money for a magic weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the holy swords being unique, I agree that they should be rare BUT I&#39;d prefer the MOB that it is on to be the rare spawn, with the sword a more regular carry on that MOB - I don&#39;t want to &quot;camp&quot; at the spot where the MOB spawns for two months killing it 3000 times and still find I missed out.<br/>\n<br/>\nLlorfindal<br/>\nHigh Elf Paladin of Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Chris Ferriera [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cferriera@...\">cferriera@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 12 May 1999 5:30 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqpaladin] ghoulbane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Chris Ferriera &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cferriera@...\">cferriera@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish there were lower level magical swords that were a little easier to<br/>\nobtain. Like in Dungeons and Dragons. The +1 Longsword was pretty common,<br/>\nbut it could hit for magical damage. The closest thing to that is a Combine<br/>\nSword, which is still more expesive than most of us can afford. (armor,  and<br/>\nspells, they aren&#39;t free). Ok, so maybe a magicla Item isn&#39;t actually<br/>\nneeded, but how do I beat Ghoul? Im a paladin, its one of my most hated<br/>\nenemies, yet I can&#39;t touch it. Fun. There needs to be balance, it is<br/>\nsomething definatly lacking in the Everquest Universe.<br/>\n<br/>\n    -Dyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dustin_Hicks@...\">Dustin_Hicks@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dustin_Hicks@...\">Dustin_Hicks@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tTuesday, May 11, 1999 3:16 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqpaladin] ghoulbane<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dustin_Hicks@...\">Dustin_Hicks@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A post I saw: <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have the honor of personally knowing most of the group that retrieved<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; first Ghoulsbane. <br/>\n&gt; From rumors, you know that it is in Upper Guk, but now it is confirmed.<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t know the MOB that has it, but I do know from the size and level of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; group that it is powerful. <br/>\n&gt; The group that attained it ranged from Levels 35 to 27. They may have had<br/>\n&gt; more than 1 group as well. <br/>\n&gt; Stats on the awesome Paladin only sword:<br/>\n&gt; 1H Slash 15DMG 34SPD, and casts Dismiss Undead. <br/>\n&gt; Imagine being able to double attack for a potential full 30DMG (about 70<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; 80HP with the level bonuses), and at a speed that is at least 10 to 13<br/>\n&gt; points faster than the Shiny Halberd, and Black Iron Sword. <br/>\n&gt; Also, they can now use a magic shield. The black shield that gives +9 STR<br/>\n&gt; comes to mind. <br/>\n&gt; Anyways, a final congrats, and no names are mentioned because of the flood<br/>\n&gt; and onslaught of tells and questions. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kaane <br/>\n&gt; Tarrew Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Got an opinion?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Make it count!
