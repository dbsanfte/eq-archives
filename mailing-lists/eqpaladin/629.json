In any case I went to unrest afterward to try it, the effect went off most times for 162 dmg, quite nice I must say. I considered using a MM sheild for more dex, but I needed str more so used cracked darkwood, it&#39;s a dream weapon well worth the wait and the effort.<br/>\nShakel Ana&#39;key<br/>\nTarrew Marr<br/>\nPaladin of the 35th rank</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
