If it&#39;s two-handed, then I&#39;d say a bone-bladed claymore or the shiny<br/>\nbrass halberd, but I don&#39;t have an answer for the 1-hander - anyone?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) How much should I except to pay to jump up to the weapon suggested in<br/>\n&gt; question 2?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m on a shoestring budget myself, and given that the mino axe was 5pp, the<br/>\nshield was 10pp, and the FS 2-hander was 15pp, I&#39;d expect to spend about 30pp,<br/>\nbut again I don&#39;t know what&#39;s out there for 30pp. If I did, I&#39;d have bought one<br/>\nalready :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4) Taking into account that I am currently level 16(bubble from 17th) and I<br/>\n&gt; currently have:<br/>\n&gt;         2 Onyx Earrings<br/>\n&gt;         Spiked Leather Collar<br/>\n&gt;         Leather Mask<br/>\n&gt;         Small Ringmail Helm<br/>\n&gt;         2 Silver Amber Rings (+2 str)<br/>\n&gt;         Banded Arms<br/>\n&gt;         Leather Gloves<br/>\n&gt;         2 Banded Bracers<br/>\n&gt;         Leather Shoulderpads<br/>\n&gt;         Bronze Breastplate<br/>\n&gt;         Bronze Cloak<br/>\n&gt;         Bronze Leggings<br/>\n&gt;         Leather Belt<br/>\n&gt;         Banded Boots<br/>\n&gt;         Shiny Brass Shield<br/>\n&gt; Am I at where most paladins (untwinked) at this level?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, I just hit lvl 16 a couple days ago, here&#39;s my equipment list:<br/>\n    No earrings<br/>\n    banded collar<br/>\n    leather mask<br/>\n    small banded helm<br/>\n    2 dervish cutthroat rings (+1ac, +2dex)<br/>\n    banded arms<br/>\n    leather gloves<br/>\n    2 banded bracers<br/>\n    leather shoulderpads<br/>\n    banded tunic<br/>\n    banded cloak<br/>\n    patchwork leggings<br/>\n    banded belt<br/>\n    patchwork boots<br/>\n    Shiny Brass Shield<br/>\nAt a glance, I&#39;d say we were quite evenly matched indeed. I want to replace my<br/>\npatchwork and leather with bronze, but I&#39;m taking my own sweet time about it<br/>\nand doing it one piece at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5) What types of armor should I be looking for?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m starting to look for armor that gives equal or better protection than<br/>\nbanded, and gives some sort of strength or stength/wisdom bonus. If it&#39;s just<br/>\nnot available, then I&#39;m replacing the patchwork and leather with bronze.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 6) How much does a BS mantle sell for ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have no idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 7) Anyone on Cazic Thule they would like to sell?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I play on Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well that is alot for this time.
