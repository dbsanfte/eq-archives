Sometimes you may want to attack a mob that you<br/>\ncan kill with one shot, just to get it off your back..but other times you<br/>\nwant everyone to attack the hardest hitting mob.  What I do is hail the mob<br/>\nthat I am currently attacking.  I train my party members to watch for the<br/>\nhail and attack that same mob.  Hail is better than a group tell because you<br/>\nonly have to target the mob and hit the &#39;h&#39; key.  In heavy combat you may<br/>\nwant to hit &#39;h&#39; 4 or 5 times so that you can be sure they see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaunting...<br/>\nAs a tank, you must taunt the mobs off the other players, you may have to<br/>\nswitch your mob, taunt him, then switch back to the original mob.  Don&#39;t<br/>\nhail for this type of movement, since you want your party members to stay on<br/>\nthe big target.  Use /assist playername for your clerics.  Make sure you<br/>\ntell the clerics to target the mob that is attacking them, otherwise /assist<br/>\nis about as usefull as a solo bard.  I hot key it...right click on any<br/>\nsocial ability and change the script.  I usually do a group tell saying who<br/>\nI am assisting (mostly so the cleric doesn&#39;t freak out) and then /assist the<br/>\npoor guy (hard code the players name, change it when you get in a new<br/>\nparty).  Your goal as tank should be to have EVERY mob hitting you, don&#39;t<br/>\nworry, you were created to take it, and your cleric was created to help.<br/>\nGet your taunt skill up when you solo, and get a good weapon.  Mobs tend to<br/>\nturn to the guys that are wacking them the hardest, it&#39;s easier to taunt if<br/>\nyour doing some damage yourself.  Mobs don&#39;t taunt off a player who is low<br/>\non hps (seems like about 2 bubbles).  So tell them &#39;Back off&#39;, BEFORE 2<br/>\nbubbles. Dont try to bash until everything is hitting you, I usually use a<br/>\n2hander anyway, but thats up to you of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nMana...<br/>\nFor pete&#39;s sake have your mana users in your group give you constant updates<br/>\non their mana, now I myself cannot stand being a pansy caster, but that is<br/>\ntheir thing.  If you go charging into battle without their mana being<br/>\nsufficient, it&#39;s a damn shame.  Paladins are warriors, our magic is not<br/>\ncombat magic, and you really shouldn&#39;t rely on healing yourself in combat<br/>\nuntil level 15.  After that, the number of hit points that a paladin can<br/>\ngenerate are heads and tails above a same level warrior, thats why we tank,<br/>\nget it?  I use yaulp when everything is taunted on me, I notice I dont hit<br/>\nharder but I connect more.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnow your classes...<br/>\nGeez, don&#39;t play anything but a paladin, but you have got to know the other<br/>\nclasses abilitites.  I sometimes group tell... &#39;Cleric smite necro&#39; or &#39;Bard<br/>\nstr song&#39;.  Don&#39;t worry about formulating sentences, but be clear and<br/>\nconcise.<br/>\n<br/>\nLay on Hands...<br/>\nI use lay on hands on myself as a last resort.  The most gratifying thing<br/>\nabout lay on hands (loh)is using it on another party member, especially<br/>\nthose hard hitting wizards...Now you might think that the loh is your<br/>\nability and should be used to save your neck.  I just dont think that,<br/>\nbesides if a wizard has mana, but no hit points he will do a hell of a lot<br/>\nmore good alive than a tank who is afraid to die.  Listen young paladins,<br/>\ntanks are meant to die, thats what we do.  Every time I die in a group as<br/>\nsoon as I respawn I do a group tell, saying &#39;Tanks are meant to die, thats<br/>\nwhat we do!&#39;  If I die but my group members live, I celebrate.  If my group<br/>\nmembers die and I survive, I hang my head.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope these tips help you.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaane<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
