Nothing really powerfull, I&#39;m only 10th lvl right<br/>\nnow, I just need something that will do damage to iceboned skeletons and<br/>\nghouls. Also, I seem to be making money very slowly. The only trade skills<br/>\nI have are cooking and a little blacksmithing. Is there a good zone to<br/>\nmake money in? The most money I have ever had at one time is 8 pp! Is this<br/>\nnormal or am I going about things all wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your assistance my friends,<br/>\nSir Reppik, Paladin of the 10th order<br/>\nFreeport,  Bertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
