So it may seem that you can&#39;t use a spell or that it is not<br/>\n&gt; working well, but you need to practice it with the Guildmaster at least<br/>\n&gt; once<br/>\n&gt; to kind of &quot;kick start&quot; the spell.  This is the way it has worked for me.<br/>\n&gt; If anyone has any more information on practicing and spells, let me know.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; am just about to go to level 11 and will be curious as to where to utilize<br/>\n&gt; my practices.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Grod<br/>\n&gt; 10th Level Paladin (almost 11)<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuk Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Tyler [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsabos@...\">jsabos@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, April 28, 1999 9:35 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqpaladin] Re: New character and Wisdom<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Tyler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsabos@...\">jsabos@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I currently have a lvl 13 human paladin with 85 wisdom and have never had<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; problem at all with casting my spells (except the ocassional fail) =).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Stuart Christian wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Stuart Christian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stuartc@...\">stuartc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I made a Paladin again last night, I had one that made it to level 5<br/>\n&gt; then<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; deleted him because I couldn&#39;t make any exp, and I realized once I hit<br/>\n&gt; level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4 that I might not put enough points into Wisdom to be able to cast all<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spells when I first get them.  I had this same problem with my SK where<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t able to cast 2 of my spells until level 11.  This was one of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reasons why I quit playing him, the other because I like to explore and<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very difficult when you&#39;re a huge Troll.  So, I was wondering if 90<br/>\n&gt; Wisdom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is enough to be able to cast all the spells when I get them.  I&#39;m really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; afraid of playing this character up to level 50 and still not be able to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cast Revive(49) or something to that effect.  My race is a Dwarf if that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; effects it.
