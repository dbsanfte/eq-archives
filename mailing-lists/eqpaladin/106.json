I had this same problem with my SK where I<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t able to cast 2 of my spells until level 11.  This was one of the<br/>\n&gt; reasons why I quit playing him, the other because I like to explore and it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; very difficult when you&#39;re a huge Troll.  So, I was wondering if 90 Wisdom<br/>\n&gt; is enough to be able to cast all the spells when I get them.  I&#39;m really<br/>\n&gt; afraid of playing this character up to level 50 and still not be able to<br/>\n&gt; cast Revive(49) or something to that effect.  My race is a Dwarf if that<br/>\n&gt; effects it.
