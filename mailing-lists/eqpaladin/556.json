I&#39;m assuming everyone thinks stamina is irrelevant.<br/>\nI have a high level high elf paladin that can&#39;t hit the side of a barn in broad daylight from a foot away.  Probable cause - poor high elven dexterity.<br/>\nI started a dwarven paladin recently with STR 100, STA 95, AGI 75, DEX 105. I hit everything with ease.  I&#39;m concerned my AGI is too low - am I just going to get pummelled by everything in sight? Do people think 75 is too low, or should I set it to 80?  Are there good high level paladins out there with 75 AGI or less?<br/>\nI put my DEX up to ungodly levels so that I get the weapon effect (e.g. dismiss undead) more often and also hit more often - I was getting really sick of those &quot;but miss&quot; messages.<br/>\nWhat do people think? Having seen a difference in combat ability below L30 and above L30, I&#39;d be interested to hear from high level paladins about their attributes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThorwin, Dwarven Paladin<br/>\nLlorfindal, High Elf Paladin<br/>\n<br/>\nDwarven Paladin\t100 95 60 90 88 62 60 20<br/>\nErudite Paladin\t\t70 75 70 70 88 105 80 20<br/>\nHalf Elf Paladin\t\t80 75 90 85 65 75 85 20<br/>\nHigh Elf Paladin\t65 70 85 70 100 90 90 20<br/>\nHuman Paladin\t\t85 80 75 75 80 75 85 20</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
