By the way, I should introduce<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself as well. I&#39;m Reppik on Bertoxxulous. I too am serving Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and can usually be found in and around Freeport. I&#39;m only Lvl 7 at the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; moment however.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As to the quest, I didn&#39;t even know that the quest took you out of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Freeport. I had to give up because I couldn&#39;t find anyone that would even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tell me about Xyrin.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Mon, 19 Apr 1999, Ragnarok wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to introduce myself.  My character rather. The name is<br/>\n&gt; Tiresias,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and right now he&#39;s a level 14 Paladin on the Povar server.  You know...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Povar... You never heard of Povar?! =)  He serves Erollisi Marr 24/7.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; usually hangs around Freeport area... the commonlands, Desert of Ro, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Befallen, smiting evil and whatnot.

Is that a beginner&#39;s quest<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what?  Because I got as far as the isle in the Ocean of Tears talking to<br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Holy Woman O&#39; Fun and I hear a scream come out of nowhere yearning<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; help, but I can&#39;t find where it&#39;s coming from!  The nearest islands have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; goblins I&#39;m not sure I want to mess with... anybody do this one yet?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Tiresias<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Servant of Erollsi<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this mailing list, or to change your subscription<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to digest, go to the ONElist web site, at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; select the Member Center link from the menu bar on the left.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this mailing list, or to change your subscription<br/>\n&gt; to digest, go to the ONElist web site, at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> and<br/>\n&gt; select the Member Center link from the menu bar on the left.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
