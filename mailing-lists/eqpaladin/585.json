BBC has a good ratio<br/>\nfor the level, but the -8 AGI is a *huge* hit to take<br/>\nfor it.  BBCs are pretty cheap on Tarew Marr these<br/>\ndays because people are really not into that AGI hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe BIBS, on the other hand, is rapidly becoming the<br/>\nnext PGT level farmed item.  For a while you could go<br/>\ninto Runnyeye and find less than ten people in the<br/>\nentire zone at peak times.  These days the numbers are<br/>\nup and there are a lot of killstealer casters farming<br/>\nthe Dazed Goblin Knight.  And when they get the BIBS<br/>\nthey&#39;re charging opening bids of 600pp - 700pp.  At<br/>\nthe trade bazaar a couple of BIBS went up and were<br/>\ngoing for close to 1000pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sword&#39;s nice, but not that nice.
