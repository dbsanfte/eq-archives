I have a couple of questions concerning the<br/>\nstrength bonus to attack and the double attack.  I am about to go to 18th<br/>\nlevel as a Paladin on Innoruuk and have a shiny brass halberd as well.  The<br/>\nmost I hit for with it so far is 29 damage.  I know I get double attack at<br/>\n19th but I have seen guys hitting with the halberd for about 34 damage and I<br/>\nassume it is from the strength bonus.  At what level does the strength bonus<br/>\nkick in for attack?  I have 95 native strength.  What is the formula for<br/>\nfiguring your max damage with the halberd?  Thanks for all your information<br/>\nand look forward to hearing from you.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrod<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Michael Lewis [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mllewis@...\">mllewis@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 27, 1999 8:53 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqpaladin] A few things<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Michael Lewis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mllewis@...\">mllewis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to answer some questions I&#39;ve seen arise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the service of Lord Brell<br/>\nAnguss, Paladin of the 3rd Rank</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
