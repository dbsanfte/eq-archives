The first quest I got was the &quot;go to kelethin and talk to the drunk&quot;<br/>\nquest but I stoped because I have head that this is a broken quest and no on<br/>\nwho has finished it has gotten anything from it, is it broken, is it worth<br/>\ndoing.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The quest I have now is to Travel to the innothule swamp and kill the<br/>\nJojongua. I have not been able to find any info on this beast or any paladin<br/>\nwho has done this quest.. The guild master describes the Jojongua as a beast<br/>\nof unbridled fury (or something like that) so it kinda scares me I am level<br/>\n8 and don&#39;t want to track 1/2 accross the world to get my but kicked, does<br/>\nanyone know what level is a good level for this quest and anymore info you<br/>\ncan give me on it would be great.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Ogre head... I killed Corflunk in BB and got the Ogre head it&#39;s a quest<br/>\nitem but is it for a Paladin quest? should I hold onto it or sell it to<br/>\nsomeone who can use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
