Your equipment timeline is right<br/>\nin line with what I had planned.  At 10th level I had to decide whether to<br/>\nbeef up my armor to banded from patchwork & leather, or if I should save all<br/>\nthe loot for a level and get a combine longsword.  Our general consensus in<br/>\nthis mailing list seemed to indicate that, since I already have a decent<br/>\nweapon _for my level_ that I should get better armor now, then upgrade my<br/>\nweapon later.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis latest thread helps me immensely in determining _how_ much later.  If I<br/>\nunderstand correctly, I should keep adding banded at 11th and 12th level<br/>\nwhile making do with my mino axe, then once I have a full set of banded,<br/>\nanytime between 12th and 16th should be when I need to change my primary<br/>\nweapon to an upgraded magical one.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I have been working at bringing up my 1h blunt - raised it from<br/>\n32 to 42 last night, plan on topping it off this weekend.  My 2H blunt is<br/>\naround 8 or 9, so I&#39;m just letting it sit until I get 1h blunt to my level<br/>\ncap.  As for the summoned dagger/fang, it uses piercing which I have *never*<br/>\nseen go up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking forward to other Paladin&#39;s experiences as well - the greatest<br/>\nwisdom in the world comes from learning from another&#39;s experiences...<br/>\n<br/>\nKaladin, student driver Paladin (11th and learning fast!)<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Rogers wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: David Rogers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:derogers334@...\">derogers334@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I got my shiny brass shield at 16th, and my combine<br/>\n&gt; longsword at 18th (I&#39;m 19th in Unrest now); for two<br/>\n&gt; main reasons.  One, I have determined the mino axe<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t really the weapon it&#39;s cracked up to be.  Two, I<br/>\n&gt; was tired of having to run from ghouls that were blue<br/>\n&gt; to me simply because I couldn&#39;t hurt them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n         Gary Long, Vice President, Valley Internet Services<br/>\n         ...Web Commerce is what we do, all day every day...<br/>\nPh:(916)498-1920 Fax:(916)498-1932  1611 S St #202 Sacramento,CA 95814<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.valley-internet.com\">http://www.valley-internet.com</a> -  For all your business hosting needs.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.securetrans.com\">http://www.securetrans.com</a> -  Accept credit cards online in real-time!<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
