Hatur huh? I have NEVER seen him and I spent almost 10 levels in oasis, I never even heard of him except in some rumor loooooong ago..<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it was to replace rubicite, but rubicite sounds alot easier to get than this.. BULLSHIT VERANT!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well maybe we can give the molds to an NPC to do the work, that would be better, but I sure as hell hope we dont have to go off chasing some special metal TOO, why did they make paladin armor so much harder to get? It better be damn good compared to the other classes armor!<br/>\n<br/>\n(Btw I have spent 200h+ in upper guk the past month camping ghoulbane, I have had some SERIOUS bad luck I guess because I don&#39;t have one yet)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Avron -<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Nicholas20@...\">Nicholas20@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 15, 1999 2:24 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqpaladin] Rubicite replacement armor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Nicholas20@...\">Nicholas20@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; there isnt a lvl requirement to get to temple I dont believe..all you need to do is get to lavastorm mts..the entrance to temple is directly across from Sol A/B entrances. its neat to go through..dont hail the efreet what ever you do..Paladin quests start in rathe mts at a paladin camp..(looks like a carnival gathering) at loc 3000, neg 900 If I remember right..Basically a NPC from the different paladin guilds felwithe/qeynos/two in freeport/deepwater etc..will talk to you..you need to go ask each of the respective guilds &quot;Am I honored member?&quot; if you faction is good enough they will tell you and you can proceed..the items required are somewhat hard to get..one is kajji plans from Hatur in Oasis..I have only seen that named SG once in all my playing..then when you get the items you just get a mold..plus there is talk that you need a special metal to craft the armor and only this master smith in the temple knows recipe but wont say if you faction with 415 (I think it is) isnt h!<br/>\n&gt; !<br/>\n&gt; igh enough..so it sounding like you will need to smith these items yourself since molds are no drop..there is talk you are to give to master smith but being as no one has done this on my server (or at least to my knowledge)<br/>\n&gt; it is unknown yet..all in all a very hard quest..but it keep us paladins humble =)<br/>\n&gt; Shakel Ana&#39;key<br/>\n&gt; Paladin of the 37th Rank<br/>\n&gt; Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
