My last expierence in Innouthule was<br/>\ninteresting, I took to arms with a lvl 14  Dark Elf Shadow Knight ( I was 14<br/>\nat the time) and was in a duel to the death with her, I almost died, but I<br/>\nsucceeded and won the match. That is a hard area with all the troll bashers<br/>\naround, so I would reccommend having a large group to kill the occasionial<br/>\ntroll that come about if you are 15+, Other than that, i dont know much<br/>\nabout the area, I tried to go get Ghoulsbane (Holy Sword) while there, got<br/>\nlost in guk and then made my way out, all i know about Ghoulsbane is that it<br/>\nis in lower guk on a high lvl Undead frogglok. May Tunare be with you<br/>\n<br/>\nLaurana Highwind</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
