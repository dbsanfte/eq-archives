So far I get one <br/>\nATK for every STR I have (once in a while it is 2 ATK per).  It really all <br/>\ndepends on the weapon skill, strength giving it a magnifying effect.  I, as a <br/>\ndwarf, poured my points into my starting agility of 70 and now have 90 of it, <br/>\nsame as my dex.  The only downside of a dwarf is the horrible int of 60 and <br/>\nthe even worse charisma of 55!  I once got stunk by a skunk and had it down <br/>\nto 15! Heheh<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut the skill-maxing is really not a problem for me.  I heard that <br/>\ndwarves get a higher XP penalty than high elves but I&#39;m not sure. If true, <br/>\nthat gives you plenty of time to max everything =)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs for weapons, I use one handed slashing.  I know that a two hander <br/>\nis better for dmg but I figure the lower delay time (26 thanks to the dwarven <br/>\naxe) and bash dmg gets me almost equal to a 2H.  Only reason I don&#39;t like 2H <br/>\nis because you are trying to do a lot of dmg at once, and if you miss once <br/>\nyou miss for it all.  With a bunch of small attacks you may miss half the <br/>\ntime but you&#39;ll still hit your opponent.  Again the higher dmg for the 2H <br/>\nsolves this.  The only time I would use a 2H is against a monster with a fire <br/>\nshield of some sort.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI have also started to train up my 1H blunt so that I&#39;ll be able to <br/>\nuse the rank 2 summoned weapon.  Anyone have any tips for raising this stupid <br/>\nskill?  I&#39;m too low to actually fight anything blue+.  Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWell, I love playing a dwarf because if I am grumpy in real life I <br/>\ncan be grumpy in the game under the pretense of role-playing! And it sure is <br/>\nfun to group with those high elf women and tell them they would be very <br/>\npretty if they had beards =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
