I recently spoke with a prisoner of the Freeport Milita, appatently <br/>\n&gt;he has been beaten or drugged senseless, but When I mentioned the name of <br/>\n&gt;the infamous Zimel to him, he looked deep into my eyes with understanding ( <br/>\n&gt;A prisoner gazes deep into your eyes (kinda eerie) When I mentioned the <br/>\n&gt;Sword of his Creation, this prisoner said something gutteral, his words <br/>\n&gt;were &quot;nnnn... Girkle.... Grunk.... Shoo Bog n&#39; Goo&quot;. He did not respond to <br/>\n&gt;anything else, only the name Zimel and the sword Soulfire. Maybe we are all <br/>\n&gt;going the wrong way in the search for Zimel, maybe the one underground is A <br/>\n&gt;fake.... and Maybe if you kill the Prison guards....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also in my Travels for the Test of truth, I gave a tunic to Altunic, and he <br/>\n&gt;said that I was too weak for him to talk to me.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Laurana Highwind<br/>\n&gt;Paladin of the 21st Rank<br/>\n&gt;List mediator<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
