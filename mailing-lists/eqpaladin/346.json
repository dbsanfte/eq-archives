There are 2 NPC Ogres who run about the path<br/>\nin Butcherblok at times, and they are dangerous at your level; avoid them or<br/>\njust run back thru the zone where you came if you see them coming.  There<br/>\nare also usually large snakes, skunks, and large spiders you can fight at<br/>\n5th level to gain experience near to where you zoned in, just run along<br/>\nahead a bit and hunt them out.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
