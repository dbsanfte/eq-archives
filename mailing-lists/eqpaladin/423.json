At<br/>\n10th level, sinking 1 training point into archery, then using 20 arrows with a<br/>\ncheap hunting bow I have yet to see my skill increase.  I purchased a tiny<br/>\ndagger from a friendly enchanter, but found that I can&#39;t equip it.  My next<br/>\nthought is to either purchase a lot of arrows (100) and use the bow as much as<br/>\npossible or to &quot;jump start&quot; the archery skill by putting 5 more training points<br/>\ninto it.  Any feedback or opinions?<br/>\n<br/>\nKaladin, the &#39;range 50&#39; Paladin<br/>\n--<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n         Gary Long, Vice President, Valley Internet Services<br/>\n         ...Web Commerce is what we do, all day every day...<br/>\nPh:(916)498-1920 Fax:(916)498-1932  1611 S St #202 Sacramento,CA 95814<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.valley-internet.com\">http://www.valley-internet.com</a> -  For all your business hosting needs.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.securetrans.com\">http://www.securetrans.com</a> -  Accept credit cards online in real-time!<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
