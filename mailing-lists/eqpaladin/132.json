We killed a large number<br/>\nof the evil beasts and were rewarded with a great number of Deathfist Belts.<br/>\nHowever, another side effect is that whenever I personally finished off an<br/>\norc, my standing would get better with the Knights of Truth and the common<br/>\npeoples and such.  How can you tell what your standing with the guild is?  I<br/>\nwent back to the Hall of Truth and considered everybody and talked to a<br/>\nnumber of the npc&#39;s at the Hall of Truth.  I also checked the prices they<br/>\noffered me for my goods and the prices of the items they had.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>\ndetect any changes.
