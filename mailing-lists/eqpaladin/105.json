I had this same problem with my SK where I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t able to cast 2 of my spells until level 11.  This was one of the<br/>\nreasons why I quit playing him, the other because I like to explore and it&#39;s<br/>\nvery difficult when you&#39;re a huge Troll.  So, I was wondering if 90 Wisdom<br/>\nis enough to be able to cast all the spells when I get them.  I&#39;m really<br/>\nafraid of playing this character up to level 50 and still not be able to<br/>\ncast Revive(49) or something to that effect.  My race is a Dwarf if that<br/>\neffects it.
