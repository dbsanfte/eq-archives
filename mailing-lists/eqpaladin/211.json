I never could.  I suck<br/>\nat it.  I can&#39;t be mean, and I hate when people are.  However, it is these<br/>\ntypes of people which make good people seem all the better. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose to be a Paladin because I wanted to help people.  I wanted people to<br/>\nhave a hero... I loved the idea of LOH, and because I have such a skill,<br/>\nI&#39;ve acutally saved many lives.  Even though most of the time people tend to<br/>\ntake it as something to pay me back on, as long as they are alive, I&#39;m cool.<br/>\n=)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not a saint however. =)  I do it partially to get positive feedback from<br/>\nothers.  If they don&#39;t say thank you or anything, I&#39;ll actually get bummed.<br/>\nHowever, it still makes me feel good that I helped someone out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I wanted to be on the front lines.  I like a character that can duke<br/>\nit out in battle long enough for another to escape.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to make sure I got the Holy Swords, because I hear they&#39;re the<br/>\nneat-o-est in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose a half-elf to give it a challenge.  Most people are humans when<br/>\nmaking Paladin&#39;s (from what I&#39;ve seen) and being half-Filipino/half-white in<br/>\nreal life, I thought I could play such a race in the game as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose the goddess Erollisi cuz of my love of romance.  However, I am<br/>\nfinding that even I don&#39;t think such stuff happens often in the game.  For<br/>\nsome reason, as much as I roleplay, I don&#39;t want to hit on a guy playing a<br/>\ngirl. =)  So my goddess only played the part of Tiresias loving all, even<br/>\ndark elves, rather than focusing on any relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s my half-cent thrown in. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nTiresias<br/>\nServant of Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Brian Williams &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gungho77@...\">gungho77@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, May 09, 1999 11:00 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqpaladin] Why did you choose to play a paladin?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Brian Williams&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gungho77@...\">gungho77@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hail all!!!!!
