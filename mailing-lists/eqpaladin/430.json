Blind is a very useful spell, but not in the<br/>\nway it should be.  If you blind a creature you are fighting, and then run it<br/>\nwill follow as if the spell did nothing.  That part should be fixed.  If you<br/>\nblind a creature that is NOT fighting you, and it doesn&#39;t resist, it will often<br/>\nrun right by you, and eventually come back when it is unblinded to fight you.<br/>\nRemember, the flash of light spell doesn&#39;t last very long.   I have had this<br/>\nhappen to me many times.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the blind spell becomes REALLY useful is when you use it as a taunt.  All<br/>\nspells in the game have an Anger (or Hate) rating.  This is how monsters rate a<br/>\nspell vrs direct damage, and why they will often attack a caster who has never<br/>\ndone any actual damage to them.  Blind spells are very near the top of the Anger<br/>\nrating.  If you are ever fighting in a group and the monster decides to attack<br/>\nyour wizard (because the wizard just hit him for three 100pt fireballs) and your<br/>\ntaunt is doing nothing, Flash of Light the monster.  He will VERY QUICKLY turn<br/>\nto attack you.  But be warned, it may be very difficult to get the monster<br/>\ntaunted off of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso be careful using Flash of Light as a pull spell.  It will often pull the<br/>\nentire camp onto you, and no one will be able to change the little critters&#39;<br/>\nminds.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Ferriera wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Chris Ferriera &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cferriera@...\">cferriera@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      I have a question regarding the flash of light spell that supposedly<br/>\n&gt; blinds an opponent. For some reason when I cast it, and it misses, nothing<br/>\n&gt; happens, but if I cast and it DOES blind them I get hit by that &quot;blind&quot;<br/>\n&gt; creature for some absurdly high amount of damage. Im level 15 and have been<br/>\n&gt; blinded in the past by Muddites and it is not fun. I feel that when I blind<br/>\n&gt; a creautre in combat (not to pull it) it does not really work that well at<br/>\n&gt; all. When I pull with it, it seems to work as monsters will run off in odd<br/>\n&gt; directions all confused. Does this happen to others as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      -Dyce<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PS- I find casting blind also works better than useless taunt skill when you<br/>\n&gt; want a creature to attack you and leave your teammate alone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Deadline is June 19.
