I read the list in digest version so I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t respond to specific emails.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1.  Do not overly worry about having enough mana to cast spells.  I have<br/>\n&gt; reached the 19th Order in the Service of Brell and have yet to find a<br/>\n&gt; spell I cannot cast due to lack of total mana.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2.  It is best to always seed any new skills.  Check your spell book to<br/>\n&gt; see what skill the new spells you gain are and drop a point accordingly<br/>\n&gt; into each one.  Just as a tip, buy the lowest mana spell in each class,<br/>\n&gt; just for the purpose of skilling.  I used sense undead to raise my<br/>\n&gt; Divination skill, once I started it maxxed in about 3 days of casting.<br/>\n&gt; I cast while hanging out just about anywhere.  The hardest for us I<br/>\n&gt; think will be conjuration, to the extent I haven&#39;t even bought the<br/>\n&gt; Hammer spell because I don&#39;t see a use.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3.  Magic weapons are important.  I am using a Combine 2-Handed at the<br/>\n&gt; moment.  The cost was very high at 112 plat, but quite worth it in the<br/>\n&gt; long run.  I am fortunate to have several friends with whom I pool coin<br/>\n&gt; to purchase items.  But ye need to try and save at least 60 plat and buy<br/>\n&gt; a Combine Longsword to use for coining.  The reasoning behind this is<br/>\n&gt; the combines are faster and hit harder, thereby allowing you to slay<br/>\n&gt; those evil bastages in a more timely fashion.  Willows are great coin,<br/>\n&gt; the lightstones sell for 8 gold (i&#39;m a dwarf, charisma ain&#39;t me strong<br/>\n&gt; point) and the greaters sell for almost 4 plat.  That is to merchants.<br/>\n&gt; There are always players out there in need and you can make roughly<br/>\n&gt; fifty percent profit over merchant costs sometimes.  On a note about<br/>\n&gt; Ghoulsbane, the crew I&#39;m with will be attempting to get a few of those<br/>\n&gt; this weekend.  One thing I know for sure, don&#39;t try it if your under<br/>\n&gt; 20th level.  The rumor is the FroggerKing is close to level 30.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4. I remember seeing a message regarding a back entrance to North<br/>\n&gt; Freeport.   I am curious if anyone has better details of this.  I plan<br/>\n&gt; on rampaging those evil guards this weekend (very holy-type evil grin).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In the service of Brell,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anguss of Cazic_Thule<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Tired of empty chat rooms and out of date bulletin boards?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; ONElist: Making the Internet Intimate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dan Kassiday<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kassiday@...\">kassiday@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clark.net/pub/kassiday\">http://www.clark.net/pub/kassiday</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nAre you hogging all the fun?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nFriends tell friends about ONElist!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
