For some reason when I cast it, and it misses, nothing<br/>\nhappens, but if I cast and it DOES blind them I get hit by that &quot;blind&quot;<br/>\ncreature for some absurdly high amount of damage. Im level 15 and have been<br/>\nblinded in the past by Muddites and it is not fun. I feel that when I blind<br/>\na creautre in combat (not to pull it) it does not really work that well at<br/>\nall. When I pull with it, it seems to work as monsters will run off in odd<br/>\ndirections all confused. Does this happen to others as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n     -Dyce<br/>\n<br/>\nPS- I find casting blind also works better than useless taunt skill when you<br/>\nwant a creature to attack you and leave your teammate alone.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
