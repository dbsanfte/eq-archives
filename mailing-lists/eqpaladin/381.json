Turn inland till lake<br/>\non your left, gypsies on your right.  Bad things - mainly Sand Giants<br/>\n<br/>\nN Karana - Head inland from river at the point with the &quot;spires&quot; and the<br/>\nbridge.  Follow the road.  Bad things - Griffins and Hill Giants<br/>\n<br/>\nI know of two others not sure if they sell combine stuff or not:<br/>\nLavastorm - don&#39;t know their exact location or directions.<br/>\n<br/>\nRathe Mountains - from Lake Rathe entrance, follow left wall a long<br/>\nways.  From Ferrott entrance follow right wall a little ways.  Skip the<br/>\nfirst right which leads back to a bad flying griffin looking thing with<br/>\na long egyptian sounding name.  Ankhe....somethin.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I asked this before but has anyone noticed that the language of<br/>\nthe Giants is &quot;combine&quot;?  Does anyone know the connection (if any)<br/>\nbetween Giants, gypsies, and combine weapons?<br/>\n<br/>\nShawn<br/>\nFlarfian, level 12 Dark Elf Necromancer<br/>\nFlarfianb, level 4 Human Paladin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Michael Lewis [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mllewis@...\">mllewis@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 27, 1999 6:53 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n3. The gypsies that sell combines (great investment) are located in the<br/>\nOasis of Marr.  You have to zone south into the Oasis from Nro, walk<br/>\nalong the coast til you pass a small dock and see a largish pillar just<br/>\noff the coast.  When you see the pillar turn to the west and run down<br/>\nthe valley.  At the end of the valley there will be a large lake to your<br/>\nleft and the gypsy camp to your right.  The seller to the northwest has<br/>\nthe combines.  A few words of warning.  Sand Giants proliferate the area<br/>\nso watch yer butts and take a friend with a high charisma to make the<br/>\nactual purchase.  I beleive with a 95 the cost for the longsword is<br/>\n53-55 plat and a 2handed (my preference) is right around 112 plat.  You<br/>\ncan also get them in North Karana but that&#39;s a long run from Fawdyer and<br/>\nthe prices are the same.  In case your wondering where anyways, just<br/>\nhead north from the &quot;white&quot; bridge along the road, once again beware of<br/>\nGriffins and Hill Giants.  I&#39;ve since moved on and am using a Shiny<br/>\nBrass halberd (can hit for a max of 74 points a round with double attack<br/>\nat my current level) but the combines are great for early teens.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
