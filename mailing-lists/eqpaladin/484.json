Its name was Yymp the Infernal. We battled, and I successfull slew the beast. When looting I was suprised when I found a (I imagine) a very valueable piece of armor, a Minoutar Ribcage 16ac 5str 5 stm -9 cha. Nice stats i thought. I being a high elf cannot use this piece of equipment, human euridite and half elf only, bleah but I am going to keep it for a new character i think. So all of you who can use it, i would reccommend watching out for it, I imagine it is a very rare find.<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Dame Laurana Highwind<br/>\nPaladin of the 21st rank<br/>\nAllied Explorers Of Norrath<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\nList Moderator</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
