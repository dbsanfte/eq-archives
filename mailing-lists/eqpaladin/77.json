I have seen a screenshot of Davidon<br/>\n(Level 50 pally in beta) in a group taking him, presumably to get Soulfire,<br/>\nbut I wouldn&#39;t recommend you try for a while.  I made a throw away character<br/>\njust to see how hard he hit, and, well, Zarn&#39;s damaged maxed at 147 dmg per<br/>\nhit, plus double attack and any spells he decides to toss out.  For<br/>\nreference, ice giants, who are supposed to be about level 40, max out at 110<br/>\ndmg.  This has led many people to scratch thier heads as the Zimel&#39;s Blades<br/>\nquest can only be started below level 9, and finished at level 40+. =)<br/>\n    The thing is, while you cant get the Big Prize until late in the game, I<br/>\nhave a sneaking suspicion that there may be part you can do at the lower<br/>\nlevel.  In beta, the quest worked somewhat differently.  You eventually<br/>\nwound up giving Groflah the flier in the Seafarer&#39;s and he translated a code<br/>\nmaking the flyer read &#39;Help captive&#39;, and he said that Zimel was surely<br/>\nalive and being held captive in the city.  While Kalatrina doesnt appear<br/>\nwilling to give you the flier back after getting it from Alayle in retail,<br/>\nif you catch Groflah in the Seafarer&#39;s and pump him for information about<br/>\nZimel, he&#39;ll tell you the story of how Zimel stole Soulfire from Zarn, and<br/>\nhow he fears that Zimel is being held captive somewhere in the city.  Now,<br/>\nin beta, I must&#39;ve seached from one end of the city to the other, in all the<br/>\nbuildings, through all the sewers, everywhere.  I even tried the &#39;a<br/>\nprisoner&#39;, who was in the jail beneath the Arena despite the unlikelyhood of<br/>\nthe Steel Warriors assisting the Dismal Rage in any way.  No go.  However,<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard, but havnt gotten around to checking, that the sewers have been<br/>\nsomewhat filled out, and that there are actual mobs down there. (In p3 and<br/>\nearly p4 at the least, the sewers were completely empty.  You had the<br/>\nguildmaster for the Dismal Rage, but absolutly nothing else)  I keep meaning<br/>\nto go down there and search for Zimel, but I havnt had a chance yet.  Hope I<br/>\nwas of some help, or at least interest,<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nJude Morrigan<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Khossidar of the Underfoot<br/>\n&gt;Fenin Ro<br/>\n&gt;Dan Kassiday<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clark.net/pub/kassiday\">http://www.clark.net/pub/kassiday</a><br/>\n&gt;reply to - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kassiday@...\">kassiday@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
