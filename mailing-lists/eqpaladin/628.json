I hope to get one of my very own someday, at this<br/>\npoint that day seems very far away indeed. My 18th level clerical friend and<br/>\nI tried time and again to storm the depths of Befallen, but the residents of<br/>\nthat hole managed to defeat us time and again. Instead of taking a few steps<br/>\ntowards the higher levels, those deaths cost me a few steps back. A quick<br/>\nscan of your message reveals what may be a flaw in my strategy - we need a<br/>\nfew more in our party to make Befallen ours. What do most Paladin&#39;s Befallen<br/>\nromps consist of in party members?<br/>\n<br/>\nI generally try to play paired up with another player, that way we can take<br/>\non things that /con up to equal to me. Unfortunately that causes trouble<br/>\nwhen more than one creature attacks, even if those creatures are conning<br/>\nblue. In one battle down there my clerical friend (lvl 18) and I (lvl 17)<br/>\ntook out (all blue) 2 greater skeletons, 2 necromancer acolytes, both pets,<br/>\n1 ghoul, 1 wisp, and 1 lesser mummy, at the end of which we were both below<br/>\n30% health and no mana. Quite the battle royale, and we were both amazed we<br/>\nhad survived!<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, congratulations on your new Ghoulbane sword!<br/>\nKaladin, who weilds a mighty hammer of wrath for now :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Alexander G.&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Alexander G.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smerte@...\">smerte@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am happye to anounce that I aquired me a Ghoulbane yesterday on the<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro server.
