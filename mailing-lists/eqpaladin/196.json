My question to you all is, what are<br/>\nyou<br/>\npaying for armor?  All the blacksmiths in my area have formed some kind<br/>\nof<br/>\nprice guild and all charge basically the same price for banded armor.  I<br/>\nrealize this is supposed to be free enterprise and let the people set<br/>\nthe<br/>\nprices but we are getting price fixing on my server.  I had a friend on<br/>\nanother server tell me not to pay more than 25 plat for a Banded Tunic,<br/>\nbut<br/>\nthe cheapest any of the blacksmiths (I have checked with 3 different<br/>\nsmiths<br/>\nat different times of the day) will sell the tunic for on the Innoruuk<br/>\nserver is 35 plat.  What do all of you pay?  I have tried to negotiate<br/>\nwith<br/>\neach blacksmith, offering my pledge of allegiance to him, but to no<br/>\navail. I<br/>\nhave just been a part of forming a guild so I am thinking about having<br/>\nmy<br/>\nguild only deal with one smith if we can find one who will give us a<br/>\nbreak.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are your experiences in this area?  Are any of you on the Innoruuk<br/>\nserver?  I am going to try and go to some different areas like<br/>\nButcherblock<br/>\nand such to see if I can find any less expensive blacksmiths.  Now,<br/>\nbefore<br/>\nsome blacksmiths email me and tell me how hard it is to get up your<br/>\nlevel in<br/>\nsmithing, and how much it costs, I know.  I understand.  I just don&#39;t<br/>\nlike<br/>\nprice fixing. I would rather negotiate and barter with each guy<br/>\nindependently, rather than get a set price with no negotiation.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease give me your feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrod<br/>\nPaladin of the 14th Level (soon to be 15th)<br/>\nInnoruuk Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nJoin today!<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nDid you know that<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nMore than 3.5 million people are using ONElist?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
