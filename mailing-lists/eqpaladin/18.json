After <br/>\nsuccessfully delivering a message to the High Priestess of Marr I received <br/>\nMarr&#39;s Essence.  This item is a silver flask which does not appear to be <br/>\nmagical and in fact seems to have no function that I can determine.  I got the <br/>\nquest for the message so long ago that I can not remember if I am supposed to <br/>\ndeliver this bottle to the instructor in the Hall of Truth (paladin&#39;s guild in <br/>\nFreeport) or if there is something else that is supposed to happen with it.  <br/>\nUnlike most quest items it appears that this has some monetary value and could <br/>\nbe sold for about 4 gold.  If anyone knows what it does or what its for please <br/>\nlet me know.  This is one of the quests that seems to have been fixed by recent <br/>\npatches.  It took me out into the west commons way before I should have been <br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond there was another messanger quest in freeport.  Upon completing the task <br/>\nthe instructor informed me that I should go and speak with Rashinda in the <br/>\nPeoples Office of freeport to learn where Zimel&#39;s Blades is or what happened to <br/>\nit.  Once I had that information I was to report back.  I can not get any kind <br/>\nof response from Rashinda and I do not know whether it is because I am not <br/>\nphrasing my question correctly, or if the quest is brolen.  There were rumors <br/>\nthat this quest leads to a holy blade.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any can be of assistance in these matters I look forward to your advice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHumbly yours,<br/>\n<br/>\nKhossidar of Fenin Ro, Paladin of the Underfoot<br/>\n<br/>\nDan Kassiday<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kassiday@...\">kassiday@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clark.net/pub/kassiday\">http://www.clark.net/pub/kassiday</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
