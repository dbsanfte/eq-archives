Right now the &quot;in&quot;  thing to have is the Cracked Something<br/>\nSomething Shield off one of the named gnolls in High Pass Hold.  Of course,<br/>\nthat&#39;s where I&#39;ve been the past few days, so I can&#39;t be too sure.  It sells<br/>\nfor about 150pp. The other gnoll has the Polished Granite Tommahawk, which I<br/>\nthink blows chunks (I just got one), but I&#39;ve seen it go for 600pp.  The<br/>\nother is the Shiny Brass Halberd, which is what I&#39;m using now until I get<br/>\nthe BBC.  Most people get them to sell now though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone is on the Povar server, feel free to give me a tell.  I just got<br/>\nlevel 20, so hopefully I can get my last name soon.  Right now I&#39;m in<br/>\nBefallen cleaning house and taking revenge for what the place did to be in<br/>\nthe earlier levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the Povar server?  Never heard of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeh.<br/>\n<br/>\nTiresias Haniel<br/>\nI am the Seventh.

I<br/>\nhave seen one being sold for as high as 100 platinum (ouch).  The area that<br/>\nspawns the creature that occasionally has the shield, is always camped, no<br/>\nmatter the time of day I try.  A magic shield, as you all know, is a nice<br/>\nbenefit to have with the bashing ability, to be able to hit creatures that<br/>\nneed magic to cause damage against them.  Let me get to the question before<br/>\nI get to far off here.<br/>\n&gt; Are there other magic shields that we as Paladins can use?<br/>\n&gt; If so, would you mind sharing the information.  It does not have to be<br/>\nvery specific, just a hint or twelve &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also to comment on something else I read in one of the mails...<br/>\n&gt; I would have to agree with the attitude of most people when a &quot;Holy<br/>\nKnight&quot; comes to the rescue (more often to our folly as the &quot;rescuees&quot; run<br/>\nand the &quot;rescuer&quot; gets stuck with the fiends) and either lays hands or heals<br/>\nto the end of mana, as being less than satisfying.  I however, feel like I<br/>\nhelped someone, albeit most likely someone who will watch me die in the<br/>\nfuture and not lift a finger to help.  I think my chances are a bit better<br/>\nfor someone to help me if I help others and not watch another die while not<br/>\neven trying to help.  Also from a role-playing aspect, I do believe the<br/>\nright thing is being done, never would a Paladin turn his head to such<br/>\npersons in distress.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
