Would I be able to<br/>\nsurvive taking a team of 1-17th lvl paladin, 1-20th lvl wizard, and 1-19th lvl<br/>\ncleric into runnyeye to try and find these purple crystals, then find the<br/>\nknight, then kill the knight? I usually don&#39;t hang out in Runnyeye, I do run<br/>\nthru there when I make a journey from Freeport to Qeynos.  Any directions from<br/>\nthe entryway would be MUCH appreciated :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, thanks for all the feedback folks!<br/>\nKaladin, the brave adventurous 17th level Paladin<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul Duquette wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Paul Duquette&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PDuquette@...\">PDuquette@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My BIBS has served me extremely well since 20th lvl.

If I switch to a shiny brass halberd then I<br/>\n&gt; am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; walking away from 1-handed slashing skill which will need to be made up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; after I do get ghoulbane.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Are there any other weapon/shield combos I am overlooking that actually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worked for some of you more accomplished Paladins?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Again, thanks everybody for the input.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kaladin, 17th level Paladin (who is not well known for hiding in safe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; corners of Norrath)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Nicholas20@...\">Nicholas20@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Nicholas20@...\">Nicholas20@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; True the druid can &quot;sneak&quot; the paladin down and the paladin can &quot;hide&quot;<br/>\n&gt; in the &quot;safe&quot; corner while his friends do the work and then hand him a<br/>\n&gt; weapon he did nothing to earn, but any paladin worth a grain of salt who<br/>\n&gt; uses these techniques I don&#39;t feel they deserve one. First of all there is a<br/>\n&gt; sort of honor arranging the group, leading it in, and having an active party<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; work together with you contributing. Who needs it at lvl 17 anyways? You<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t do max dmg till 20 and the effect won&#39;t work as well. There are many<br/>\n&gt; other fine weapons out there till then.  Second of all in my experience<br/>\n&gt; camping this thing, it can go bad very quick..people say you can stay in one<br/>\n&gt; room safely and keep a couple spawns controlled, but if you really want to<br/>\n&gt; live keep the whole area clean. Trust me it goes much better this way. Some<br/>\n&gt; people get lucky and get the sword right away..that has never been my<br/>\n&gt; experience as it is still not something I have obtained and i have tried<br/>\n&gt; many times. It&#39;s a long camp but it will be well worth it if you earn it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shakel Ana&#39;key<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tarrew Marr<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Paladin of the 35th rank (still has yet to get that blasted sword)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;          Gary Long, Vice President, Valley Internet Services<br/>\n&gt; &gt;          ...Web Commerce is what we do, all day every day...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ph:(916)498-1920 Fax:(916)498-1932  1611 S St #202 Sacramento,CA 95814<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.valley-internet.com\">http://www.valley-internet.com</a> -  For all your business hosting needs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.securetrans.com\">http://www.securetrans.com</a> -  Accept credit cards online in real-time!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n         Gary Long, Vice President, Valley Internet Services<br/>\n         ...Web Commerce is what we do, all day every day...<br/>\nPh:(916)498-1920 Fax:(916)498-1932  1611 S St #202 Sacramento,CA 95814<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.valley-internet.com\">http://www.valley-internet.com</a> -  For all your business hosting needs.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.securetrans.com\">http://www.securetrans.com</a> -  Accept credit cards online in real-time!<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
