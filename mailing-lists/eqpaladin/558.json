Further, increases to Stamina show very<br/>\nminor effect compared to the same increase applied to<br/>\nany of the other three Physical attributes.  +10 STA<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help you nearly as much as +10 STR, AGI or DEX<br/>\ndoes.  STA should be an afterthought when considering<br/>\nenhancements; and certainly don&#39;t put points into it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I started a dwarven paladin recently with STR 100,<br/>\n&gt; STA 95, AGI 75, DEX 105.

Do people<br/>\n&gt; think 75 is too low, or should I set it to 80?  Are<br/>\n&gt; there good high level paladins out there with 75 AGI<br/>\n&gt; or less?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have an 80 Agility with my Dwarven Paladin, and when<br/>\nconsidering armor vs AGI for overall effectiveness in<br/>\nprotecting the character, armor is more important. <br/>\nPut on full plate (bronze or steel) and you&#39;ll be much<br/>\nless concerned with what your AGI score is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I put my DEX up to ungodly levels so that I get the<br/>\n&gt; weapon effect (e.g. dismiss undead) more often and<br/>\n&gt; also hit more often - I was getting really sick of<br/>\n&gt; those &quot;but miss&quot; messages.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not a bad plan at all; I&#39;m currently seeking a pair of<br/>\nGold-Onyx rings (+5 DEX each) for this very reason. <br/>\nMy Current DEX is 100, and I&#39;d like to see it at<br/>\n110-120 after enhancements (but before spell buffs);<br/>\nso it&#39;s my secondary stat priority (STR is first).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What do people think? Having seen a difference in<br/>\n&gt; combat ability below L30 and above L30, I&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt; interested to hear from high level paladins about<br/>\n&gt; their attributes.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Dwarven Paladin---100--95--70--90--88--62--60<br/>\n&gt; Erudite Paladin----70--75--70--70--88-105--80<br/>\n&gt; Half Elf Paladin---80--75--90--85--65--75--85<br/>\n&gt; High Elf Paladin---65--70--85--70-100--90--90<br/>\n&gt; Human Paladin------85--80--75--75--80--75--85<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Level 25 Dwarven Paladin:<br/>\nStarting = 110--95--80--90--88--60--55<br/>\nCurrent == 126--95--84-100--88--60--55<br/>\n<br/>\nI highly recommend STR and STR enhancements as the<br/>\nnumber one priority.  Armor is heavy, good armor is<br/>\nheavier.  Even for Dwarves, who start with an<br/>\nexcellent STR; more is better.  STR adds to the attack<br/>\nscore, increases the damage bonus once you get over<br/>\n20, and also enables you to loot much more.  For the<br/>\nother Paladin races, who start with much lower STR<br/>\nscores; STR enhancements are a vital necessity.  My<br/>\nsetup is +16 STR (and working on more), which would<br/>\nchange a STR rollup in the following Paladins like<br/>\nthis:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Erudite Paladin---106--75--70--70--88-105--80<br/>\n&gt; Half Elf Paladin--116--75--90--85--65--75--85<br/>\n&gt; High Elf Paladin--101--70--85--70-100--90--90<br/>\n&gt; Human Paladin-----121--80--75--75--80--75--85<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>With +16 STR Enhancements, their STR scores start to<br/>\nshape up very nicely.<br/>\n<br/>\nDEX is important for a number of reasons.  It affects<br/>\nyour attack connect ratio; higher equals fewer misses.<br/>\n It also affects secondary weapon effects; higher<br/>\nequals it going off more often.  Finally, with a<br/>\nhigher DEX you see Parries and Ripostes happen more<br/>\noften.<br/>\n<br/>\nAGI directly affects your defense, and also increases<br/>\nthe chance of getting a Dodge off.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
