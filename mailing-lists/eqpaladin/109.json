What I was wondering is if I will have enough mana to be<br/>\nable to cast all the spells at level 9 when I get them.  My SK didn&#39;t have<br/>\nenough mana to be able to cast 2 of his spells and I would hate to get to<br/>\nlevel 9 and have the samething happen with this guy.  But as Tyler said,<br/>\nhe&#39;s a level 13 Human Paladin with 85 Wisdom and he has enough mana. So I<br/>\nthink my Dwarf Paladin with 90 Wisdom should be ok.  I have just heard<br/>\nreports that some Paladins didn&#39;t have enough mana to cast cure poison when<br/>\nthey first got it and I wanted to make sure that my guy would be able to.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kalamar(E&#39;ci)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Guillaume Voizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gvoizard@...\">gvoizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, April 28, 1999 11:27 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqpaladin] Re: New character and Wisdom<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Guillaume Voizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gvoizard@...\">gvoizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;These is what I noticed.<br/>\n&gt;If you have an ability (not only on spells) from level 1, it can increase<br/>\n </span></blockquote>by<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;itself.
