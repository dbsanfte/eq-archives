However, I have noticed that the paladin<br/>\nclass is very often mentioned along with the bone bladed.  I am not aware of<br/>\nit being a paladin only sword, and the various web sites do not mention it<br/>\nas such.  Can someone who has actually wielded the sword give clarity to the<br/>\nissue?<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, I see a lot of paladins wielding 1h swords and a shield.  Seriously<br/>\nconsider the benefits of 2handed weapons.  I was fortunate enough to get the<br/>\n2H Dwarven Axe (14 damage, 43 delay).  And at level 12, I do 29 points of<br/>\ndamage a round.  Delay is a factor, but consider it very closely.  Exactly<br/>\nhow much faster is a weapon of 32 delay compared to 43 delay.  What do those<br/>\n11 points mean in terms of combat?  Paladins have very good defense with no<br/>\narmor restrictions, and healing (which can actually be done in combat if<br/>\ntimed right).  Consider that Verant has balanced paladins with paladin only<br/>\noffensive items, I have not heard of a paladin only armor yet.  I think that<br/>\npaladins are natural tanks, because of the number of hit points that we can<br/>\ngenerate, but great offense compliments great defense.  Consider upping your<br/>\noffense with a good 2 hander.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaane<br/>\nTarrew-Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
