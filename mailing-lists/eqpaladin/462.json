There *is* no best race for<br/>\nanything; it&#39;s always a matter of perspective and<br/>\nstyle.  How do you view it, and how do you want to<br/>\nplay it?  There are only strengths and weaknesses,<br/>\nfrom which you can select what best suits your desires<br/>\nfor the character.  Keeping that in mind, here are<br/>\nthumbnail breakdowns of the five Paladin-eligible<br/>\nraces.<br/>\n<br/>\nDwarves have the best starting physical stats, and<br/>\n(arguably) the most balanced starting stats in terms<br/>\nof Paladin attribute requirements and not having low<br/>\nnumbers in said requirements.  100-95-70-90-88-60-55. <br/>\nAs a dwarven paladin, you have no physical<br/>\ndeficiencies that will handicap you, and your WIS is<br/>\nmore than sufficient for your magical uses.  The<br/>\ndrawback of a dwarven paladin is the low INT and CHA. <br/>\nThese can be worked around.<br/>\n<br/>\nErudites are tied for the best mentals; the highest<br/>\nINT and the second highest WIS, and don&#39;t have<br/>\ncrippled physicals like High Elf paladins do. <br/>\n70-75-70-70-88-107-80.  However, erudite paladins do<br/>\nhave the second lowest physicals, and thus can have<br/>\nproblems in that area.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalf Elven paladins have the lowest starting WIS among<br/>\nthe paladin races, and typically are the least able<br/>\ncasters.  The physicals aren&#39;t bad, but focus more on<br/>\nAGI and DEX than on STR or STA.  The Mentals are<br/>\nstrictly average, except for the low WIS. <br/>\n80-75-90-85-65-75-75.<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh Elven paladins have the lowest starting<br/>\nphysicals, but tie for the highest mentals. <br/>\n65-70-85-70-100-92-90.  High elf paladins are<br/>\nenternally having encumberance problems, and will<br/>\nsuffer somewhat in combat until they get a high skill<br/>\nlevel, and also collect enchantments that boost their<br/>\nmeager physicals.  But they have the best starting<br/>\nWIS, and the second best INT; and that focuses them<br/>\nmore on the casting side.<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman paladins are, as one might anticipate, the<br/>\nmiddle of the road.  They&#39;re solid, can can be built<br/>\ntowards one thing or another; and aren&#39;t poor at<br/>\nanything in particular, while also not being excellent<br/>\nat anything either.  85-80-75-75-80-75-85.  Depending<br/>\non where the points are placed, a Human paladin can be<br/>\nmany things.<br/>\n<br/>\nFigure out what best suits your intentions for the<br/>\ncharacter, and select accordingly.  High Elves have<br/>\nthe most STR problems, Dwarves the most skill and<br/>\nprice problems, Half Elves the most magic problems. <br/>\nHumans have no major problems, but no major<br/>\nadvantages; and Erudites pay a surprisingly low price<br/>\nfor their advantage of superior mentals with only<br/>\nslightly below average physicals.  The humans (high<br/>\nmen and men) don&#39;t have Infravision, which many gamers<br/>\nconsider a requirement.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
