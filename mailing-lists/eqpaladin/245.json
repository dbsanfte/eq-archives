But, is it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI play on the Tunare server, one of the younger servers - people on Tunare are already nicely into the 30s (Ah, those superlevelling druids).  Heck, I&#39;m only L22 but keep chipping away at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsequently, if the rumours are true, it strikes me that Ghoulbane should have been liberated by now on an older server, say Fennin Ro.<br/>\n<br/>\nSurely therefore, one of our fellow paladins can shed light onto the age old question: &quot;When can we take the Froglock Lord?&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s hope the mist is lifted...<br/>\n<br/>\nLlorfindal<br/>\nHigh Elf Paladin of Tunare<br/>\nLooking to trade in his shiny brass halberd</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
