My primary hunting grounds right now are the Aqua-Goblins<br/>\n(big group only) and Unrest. The problem I am facing is even though I have<br/>\nall the spells for 15th lvl and I have a majority of metal armor (some is<br/>\nstill leather) I can&#39;t seem to make any real money. I have noticed a great<br/>\nneed for a combine weapon but at my present rate it will take literally<br/>\nforever. I tend to hunt in groups of 3 or 4 and generally for around 5 hours<br/>\na day. I guess what I would like to know is, Am I doing something wrong? or<br/>\nis everyone broke at this lvl? Is there a better spot to hunt? Your<br/>\nassistance is most appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nSilvermyst</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
