It is a lot easier to get factions back up with a<br/>\nhigh charisma.  My wisdom is only 65, but I have not had a hard time with<br/>\nany of my spells.  My dodge skill works really well because of my base<br/>\nskills that I recieved as a Half-Elf.  The important thing is just to go<br/>\nout and have fun.  I just read a review in PC Accelerator magazine for<br/>\nEverquest and they are so addicted that they have renamed the game in their<br/>\noffice to Eversmack.  I just love the response that I get when I heal<br/>\nsomeone when they are shouting for a cleric to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nTanaman - &lt;Aradani&gt;<br/>\nVeeshan Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
