I heard someone say that it is good<br/>\n&gt; because you can summon one after to die to get your body back. How will it<br/>\n&gt; help you if you have no armor though, you&#39;re running around naked with a<br/>\n&gt; hammer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m looking at 2h slashing but was wondering if anyone could tell<br/>\n&gt; me another<br/>\n&gt; use for 1h blunt that might change my mind.
