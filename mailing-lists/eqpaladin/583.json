In the first bubble of lvl 26 I went for the Bone bladed claymore, for 300 pp I am not sure if I paid too much or not. Not have ever used my 2h slash I ended up dumping 33 practices into it and just now as I approach the half way mark of 27 is it maxing out, (the numbers are great, double attack for 37 each J). As far as armor, the higher up in lvl I have been forsaking armor class for + agility, +strength, + dex, what I have given up in A/C is made up more than double with dodges, and parries.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIts all personal preference, I like the agility and mobility, but still keep an A/C of 532\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFattyBear\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHello All\r<br/>\n  I have several equipment based questions to ask.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  1) I have both a mino axe and a FS longsword which should I be using?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  2) Considering the above weapons what is the next step up in weapons?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  3) How much should I except to pay to jump up to the weapon suggested in\r<br/>\n  question 2?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  4) Taking into account that I am currently level 16(bubble from 17th) and I\r<br/>\n  currently have:\r<br/>\n          2 Onyx Earrings\r<br/>\n          Spiked Leather Collar\r<br/>\n          Leather Mask\r<br/>\n          Small Ringmail Helm\r<br/>\n          2 Silver Amber Rings (+2 str)\r<br/>\n          Banded Arms\r<br/>\n          Leather Gloves\r<br/>\n          2 Banded Bracers\r<br/>\n          Leather Shoulderpads\r<br/>\n          Bronze Breastplate\r<br/>\n          Bronze Cloak\r<br/>\n          Bronze Leggings\r<br/>\n          Leather Belt\r<br/>\n          Banded Boots\r<br/>\n          Shiny Brass Shield\r<br/>\n  Am I at where most paladins (untwinked) at this level?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  5) What types of armor should I be looking for?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  6) How much does a BS mantle sell for ?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  7) Anyone on Cazic Thule they would like to sell?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  Well that is alot for this time.
