They&#39;re virtually identical in efficiency,<br/>\nbut the FS is 1/3rd faster.  Use the FS because you&#39;ll<br/>\nget more swings (skill raises faster, misses hurt<br/>\nless, more caster interrupts).  Of course, if you just<br/>\nlike to see *big* numbers (shrug), go with the mino<br/>\naxe.  But it&#39;s *slow*.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) Considering the above weapons what is the next<br/>\n&gt; step up in weapons?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Those are at nearly the top of the 1-15 level 1hS<br/>\nweapon scale (very top is Dwarven 1h Axe).  The next<br/>\nsteps up are Barbed Leather Whip and Polished Granite<br/>\nTomahawk.  BLW goes for about 150pp, PGT about 250pp.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4) Taking into account that I am currently level<br/>\n&gt; 16(bubble from 17th) and I<br/>\n&gt; currently have:<br/>\n&gt; \t2 Onyx Earrings<br/>\n&gt; \tSpiked Leather Collar<br/>\n&gt; \tLeather Mask<br/>\n&gt; \tSmall Ringmail Helm<br/>\n&gt; \t2 Silver Amber Rings (+2 str)<br/>\n&gt; \tBanded Arms<br/>\n&gt; \tLeather Gloves<br/>\n&gt; \t2 Banded Bracers<br/>\n&gt; \tLeather Shoulderpads<br/>\n&gt; \tBronze Breastplate<br/>\n&gt; \tBronze Cloak<br/>\n&gt; \tBronze Leggings<br/>\n&gt; \tLeather Belt<br/>\n&gt; \tBanded Boots<br/>\n&gt; \tShiny Brass Shield<br/>\n&gt; Am I at where most paladins (untwinked) at this<br/>\n&gt; level?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re ahead of the curve compared to most preceding<br/>\n16th level characters.  Get into full bronze<br/>\neverywhere you&#39;re not carrying magic armor (like neck<br/>\nfor Spiked Collar and shoulders for Rusty Spiked pads<br/>\nor BS Mantle).  I&#39;d recommend magic bracers; Bracer of<br/>\nBattle and Bracer of Erollsi are good suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5) What types of armor should I be looking for?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Full bronze plus magic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 6) How much does a BS mantle sell for ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>40pp - 60pp.  If you want the low end go to Unrest and<br/>\nauction.  DO NOT expect to get it that low anywhere on<br/>\nAntonica, and certainly not anywhere beyond Ferrott or<br/>\nHighhold.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
