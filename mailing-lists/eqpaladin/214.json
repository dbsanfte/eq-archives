Helping all in <br/>\nneed even if means forsaking yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is why I play the paladin even if it means a long hard road ahead, (exp <br/>\nwise) We are the class that looks out for all even if it means losing some <br/>\nexp or loot.  We chose this course full well knowing the requirements for it. <br/>\n Paladins may be a hard class to play but I for one am glad to stick with it <br/>\n(believe me I have tried all other classes). In the long run our fortitude <br/>\nwill pay off,<br/>\n<br/>\nShakel Almeth<br/>\nTarrew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
