My primary hunting grounds right now are the<br/>\n&gt; Aqua-Goblins<br/>\n&gt; (big group only) and Unrest. The problem I am facing is even though I have<br/>\n&gt; all the spells for 15th lvl and I have a majority of metal armor (some is<br/>\n&gt; still leather) I can&#39;t seem to make any real money. I have noticed a great<br/>\n&gt; need for a combine weapon but at my present rate it will take literally<br/>\n&gt; forever. I tend to hunt in groups of 3 or 4 and generally for around 5<br/>\n&gt; hours<br/>\n&gt; a day. I guess what I would like to know is, Am I doing something wrong?<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; is everyone broke at this lvl? Is there a better spot to hunt? Your<br/>\n&gt; assistance is most appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Silvermyst<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Deadline is June 19.
