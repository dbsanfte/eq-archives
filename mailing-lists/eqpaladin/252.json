What red shield and where in Felwithe did you buy it? Thanks<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aye, the shop directly in front of the bank entrance in Felwithe, which<br/>\n&gt; sells weapons, chain and plate armor, and shields.  They have both<br/>\n&gt; &quot;medium&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and &quot;small&quot; shields of that red wooden variety.  They have a wooden cross<br/>\n&gt; section and 4 red plates basically.  It sounds odd but basically it is a<br/>\n&gt; more colorful skin so to speak for the targ shield look.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Amoroth<br/>\n&gt; Karana server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Make your voice heard!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sign up for the ONElist Weekly Survey.
