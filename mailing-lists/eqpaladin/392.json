Can <br/>\n*anybody tell<br/>\n*me where you get the Minotaur Axes I keep hearing about?  With <br/>\n*my limited<br/>\n*funds, it seems like I&#39;ll be stuck with a rusty scimitar or <br/>\n*sword for life!<br/>\n* Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe easier minotaurs are in the minotaur caves in the Steamfont zone, which<br/>\nis on the other continent, Faydwer.  But, they aren&#39;t &quot;easy&quot; by any means at<br/>\n6th level; I wouldn&#39;t try them solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere used to be lesser minotaurs in Beholder, a.k.a. the Gorge of Grobb,<br/>\nover by Runnyeye and Misty Thicket, by Rivervale, but now I hear there are<br/>\nonly those very tough minotaurs :(<br/>\n<br/>\nEasiest route is to buy one, around 5 platinum, from another player.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
