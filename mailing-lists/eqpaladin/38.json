If you&#39;ve done<br/>\nit, you&#39;ll know what I&#39;m talking about.  It involves Altunic, a shirt, a<br/>\nvenom sack, and a few other items.  At the end of all this, Merko tells you<br/>\nto face a foe in the sewers.  It&#39;s a Militia guard.  If you defeat him,<br/>\nMerko says he&#39;ll &quot;make you a knight&quot;, or something similar to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is:  has anyone killed the guard and returned the token to<br/>\nMerko?  The guard says that he is actually a she (and the daughter or<br/>\ncousin of Merko)...I personally didn&#39;t kill her, and she ran away.  Now I<br/>\ncan&#39;t repeat the quest (Merko says it&#39;s something meant for lower knights<br/>\nwhen I ask about it).  Just curious what happens in the end...(I mean, do<br/>\nyou actually get something, or just exp?  I&#39;ve never read anything anywhere<br/>\nabout this quest).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAscuro, of The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
