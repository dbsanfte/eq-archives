In Steamfont<br/>\nthere are diseased rats that LOVE to attack you when your in combat with<br/>\nsomething else, this rat Disease lasts for about 30 mins (REAL TIME) and<br/>\nduring that time you will be realy hurting for HP&#39;s as I understand it you<br/>\nwon&#39;t regen HP during combat while diseased, and your max HP is choped, so<br/>\neven when you heal your still in bad shape... The Rats are passive until<br/>\nyour fighting something else then they will join in.  Another thing to worry<br/>\nabout is the Mino Hero who will just come out every once and a while to kill<br/>\nanyone in sight :) he will KOS and I have watched him take out the Gnome<br/>\nguards so at level 6, RUN if you hear of him being out in your area, or if<br/>\nyou see him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just ran through Beholder Maze last night on my way to quenos, I am a<br/>\nlevel 11 High Elf Paladin, there were many Cavern Mino&#39;s walking around <br/>\nthey coned QUITE RED to me... so you would best avoid them unless your in a<br/>\nMajor group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
