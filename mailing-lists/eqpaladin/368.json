I am just looking for opinions on why you think Verant would put<br/>\n&gt;Ghoulsbane on a paladin NPC. As far as I know, the Froglok King is a good<br/>\n&gt;paladin and in order for us to obtain the Ghoulsbane, we have to kill him.<br/>\n&gt;In a role-playing sense, that is making a RPer make a tough decision.
