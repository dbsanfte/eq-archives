However I realized that meding all the time is a real pain so I figured I&#39;d get some melee in and mix it up. Personally I was going to start out with 1 hand slash then save some practice points and when I&#39;m ready to go two hand I was planning on pumping them into two hand and then maxing that out for awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically I was wondering if anybody knows of any Paladin websites. Also one question on the Test of Truth quest or whatever it is called to become fully a Paladin Knight. Can I do this at any Paladin guild or do I have to start in a certain area? I only want to know where to start as this will be the first real quest I actually do.<br/>\n<br/>\nKananek Dwarven Paladin of E&#39;ci<br/>\nNaeeldar Dark Elf Necromancer of E&#39;ci<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: djames &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:djames@...\">djames@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Thursday, September 09, 1999 9:13 PM<br/>\n    Subject: Re: [eqpaladin] Solusek Ro wedding<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Greetings, I also have a char of this type.<br/>\n     <br/>\n    When EQ first started I found that chars of this type were more common, but as the game and its population matured people seemed to migrate to other mostly non-hybrid classes.<br/>\n     <br/>\n    I personally chose this class largely for role-play type reasons, and the fact that the class suited me to a larger extent that the others...<br/>\n     <br/>\n    I will say though, that it is a tough combination to play as we have a double penalty on gaining experience, 1 for being a hybrid class, and 2 for being a dwarf(low int)...  This also affects skill progression especially in the craft type skills (smithing etc...)  though I found it less of a problem with melee and spell casting as it took long enough to level that I had no trouble maxing out my melee skills...<br/>\n     <br/>\n    I found it difficult to keep pace with some of my friends whom played elves largely and often a non hybrid class... <br/>\n    However it is a race/class combination I intend to stay with so good luck on your choice<br/>\n     <br/>\n    One bit of advice I will recommend however is to max out as many melee skills as you can as you level, i.e. 1+2 hand blunt, 1+2 hand swords etc....  You will not likely have trouble maxing them all out as you level, but it can be an inconvenience to try and raise then later in life...<br/>\n     <br/>\n    <br/>\n        -----Original Message-----<br/>\n        From: Naeeldar &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n        To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n        Date: Thursday, September 09, 1999 4:39 PM<br/>\n        Subject: Re: [eqpaladin] Solusek Ro wedding<br/>\n        <br/>\n        <br/>\n        Hey I just started a Dwarven Paladin and I was wondering if there was anything I should know about.
