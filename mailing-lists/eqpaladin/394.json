You could take Orc Cent.s in Crushbone, but I&#39;d steer clear of<br/>\nMinotaurs for a few levels yet. I just meant you should go and buy an axe<br/>\nfrom a player. I was trying to give background on where they came from.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 28 May 1999, Chris wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Chris &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drtns@...\">drtns@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Fri, 28 May 1999, King, Darrin wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;King, Darrin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dking@...\">dking@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; *Hello,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *I&#39;m a sixth level Paladin running solo around Freeport.  Can <br/>\n&gt; &gt; *anybody tell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *me where you get the Minotaur Axes I keep hearing about?  With <br/>\n&gt; &gt; *my limited<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *funds, it seems like I&#39;ll be stuck with a rusty scimitar or <br/>\n&gt; &gt; *sword for life!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; * Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The easier minotaurs are in the minotaur caves in the Steamfont zone, which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is on the other continent, Faydwer.  But, they aren&#39;t &quot;easy&quot; by any means at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 6th level; I wouldn&#39;t try them solo.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; There used to be lesser minotaurs in Beholder, a.k.a. the Gorge of Grobb,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; over by Runnyeye and Misty Thicket, by Rivervale, but now I hear there are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only those very tough minotaurs :(<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Most Mino Axes run about 4pp in the Kelethin/Steamfont area, as stated above<br/>\n&gt; they are from the Mino Caves in Steamfont, if you want to get one the cheap<br/>\n&gt; way i.e. go kill a Mino yourself I must stress the need for a group, as well<br/>\n&gt; a Cleric would be important mainly for their cure disease.  In Steamfont<br/>\n&gt; there are diseased rats that LOVE to attack you when your in combat with<br/>\n&gt; something else, this rat Disease lasts for about 30 mins (REAL TIME) and<br/>\n&gt; during that time you will be realy hurting for HP&#39;s as I understand it you<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t regen HP during combat while diseased, and your max HP is choped, so<br/>\n&gt; even when you heal your still in bad shape... The Rats are passive until<br/>\n&gt; your fighting something else then they will join in.  Another thing to worry<br/>\n&gt; about is the Mino Hero who will just come out every once and a while to kill<br/>\n&gt; anyone in sight :) he will KOS and I have watched him take out the Gnome<br/>\n&gt; guards so at level 6, RUN if you hear of him being out in your area, or if<br/>\n&gt; you see him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just ran through Beholder Maze last night on my way to quenos, I am a<br/>\n&gt; level 11 High Elf Paladin, there were many Cavern Mino&#39;s walking around <br/>\n&gt; they coned QUITE RED to me... so you would best avoid them unless your in a<br/>\n&gt; Major group.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
