I heard someone say that it is good<br/>\nbecause you can summon one after to die to get your body back. How will it<br/>\nhelp you if you have no armor though, you&#39;re running around naked with a<br/>\nhammer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking at 2h slashing but was wondering if anyone could tell me another<br/>\nuse for 1h blunt that might change my mind. Thanks for your time.<br/>\n<br/>\nGurtof, Dwarven knight of the 6th order.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
