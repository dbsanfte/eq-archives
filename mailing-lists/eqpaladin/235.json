I ran<br/>\nacross<br/>\na quest where by I would deliver a message to one of our fellow brothers<br/>\nhiding undercover in the Freeport Militia. Unfortunately, he was killed<br/>\nbut<br/>\nnot before giving me a note with information about Zimel&#39;s Blades, which<br/>\nI<br/>\npresume is a merchant shop of some type.  I returned with this info to<br/>\nthe<br/>\nlady paladin, and she sent me to the Office of the People to speak with<br/>\nRashinda, but I seem to have hit a roadblock as I cannot get Rashinda to<br/>\nreply to me.  Does anyone know is this quest is working, and if so how I<br/>\nmight can continue it, or is the outcome not worth the trouble?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGot an opinion?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nMake it count!
