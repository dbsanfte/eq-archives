I keep getting bashed by sandgiants in oasis and<br/>\n&gt; want to find a safe, not very crowded spot to gain leves at. Also What<br/>\n&gt; are the stats on the Ghoulsbane Dmg/del ratio etc. Also what about<br/>\n&gt; other holy swords. Also had anyone heard of when the two other<br/>\n&gt; continents are coming up? and what changes will that make to the<br/>\n&gt; gameing system, will there be more spells, access to lvls higher than<br/>\n&gt; lvl 50 etc.Thank youLaurana HighwindPaladin of Tunare, 17th rankThe<br/>\n&gt; RatheList Moderator<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hail fellow knights,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll try to answer you questions as best as I can.  For the Ghoulsbane<br/>\nstats, I&#39;ve heard that its 1 handed, 15 dmg, 35 or 38 delay, and casts<br/>\ndismiss undead for 140-150 pts of damage.  As for a good area to fight,<br/>\ntry East Karana.  There&#39;s a hill where gnoll reavers, war wolves, and<br/>\nlions spawn during the day, and undead reavers and spirit stalkers at<br/>\nnight.  Be warned though.......bring a group with you.  There have been<br/>\ntimes when my full party had 3 or 4 creatures on each person.  Plus, the<br/>\nguards at the farms will not kill spirit stalkers.  The hill is<br/>\nespecially dangerous at night, but the exp is great.  Good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nValandil Lightstrider<br/>\nPaladin of the Lightbringer, 23rd rank<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
