The weight of that is 83.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat gives me a whopping 2 stones of carrying capacity.  That will last about 1 minute in Cazic Thule.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real test of strength is its impact on max damage at higher levels - is it worth it?  Is AGI or DEX better?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy healing spells are useful if no cleric is on - I can get a small party together and we can cling on by our bootstraps for after battle healing, but the high mana doesn&#39;t help much since it&#39;s all post-battle and the high intelligence is overkill for skill gain - I max everything out by a third of the way into my first bubble each level.  And that&#39;s with skills in the 140s.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, as you say, the role playing potential is great.<br/>\n<br/>\nLlorfindal<br/>\nHigh Elf Paladin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RangerDest@...\">RangerDest@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RangerDest@...\">RangerDest@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, 25 May 1999 8:24 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqpaladin] High Elf Paladins?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RangerDest@...\">RangerDest@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\tCould someone tell me the statistical benefit to being a high elf <br/>\npaladin?
