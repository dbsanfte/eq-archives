I&#39;m thinking that Ghoulbane would make a better primary weapon,<br/>\nsince all that&#39;s required is to head into Froglock central and wipe out<br/>\na fellow Froggie Paladin. I have a 35th level Magician and 35th level<br/>\nDruid who could help in this quest, as well as a 20th level Wizard and a<br/>\n19th level Cleric. Would my party of 5 stand a chance?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKaladin, 17th level Paladin of Tunare<br/>\n--<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n         Gary Long, Vice President, Valley Internet Services<br/>\n         ...Web Commerce is what we do, all day every day...<br/>\nPh:(916)498-1920 Fax:(916)498-1932  1611 S St #202 Sacramento,CA 95814<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.valley-internet.com\">http://www.valley-internet.com</a> -  For all your business hosting needs.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.securetrans.com\">http://www.securetrans.com</a> -  Accept credit cards online in real-time!<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
