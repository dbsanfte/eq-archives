Runnyeye Dungeon<br/>\nranges in levels from 5-35. So this event will be a benefit for all<br/>\ninvolved. There is no date set as of yet. This will be one of the first of<br/>\nmany events to come on the Veeshan server. Here is a list of what we will<br/>\nneed in order to get this underway, and I will happy to organize it and<br/>\naccept any help in doing so...<br/>\n<br/>\n   -1- Players, its obvious, we need people interested in Clearing out all<br/>\nthe Goblins and other dark monsters that lurk in Runnyeye.<br/>\n   -2- An experienced guide who knowsALL of Runnyeye. I have not gone deep,<br/>\nbut i know there are some out there who have.<br/>\n   -3- Binders to bind players to Rivervale for the event. <br/>\n   -4- Maybe a dontaion booth to collect tarnished and bronze weapons as<br/>\nwell as leather armor to hook up players who are in need.<br/>\n   -5- Buffers, to boost up the weaker characters.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Right now thats all I can see that is needed right now. If you are<br/>\ninterested, email me and I will get a NEWS section put up on EQ VAULT. I<br/>\nhave had a few responses so far and it looks like this could work. This will<br/>\nbe the first of many events on Veeshan and I hope all the players can help<br/>\nme make this happen. This will happen on a weekend, I work during the week<br/>\nas does most of the world, and a weekend afternoon is best, probably 12 Noon<br/>\nEST on a SAT or SUN. But, this is open to change.<br/>\n<br/>\n               -Dycedarg<br/>\n    Knight of the Cleansing Flame</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
