Self, I say, why not go and take out Narls so you can do that<br/>\nquest?  Well, with about 287hp (God, I love bravery), a 1h slash skill of<br/>\n33, full leather armor, and about five lesser heals thrown onto me by some<br/>\nnice wandering cleric, I managed to hit Narls five time before I died.  Once<br/>\nfor 10, once for 8, and three times for 1.  Now, Narls is green to me, and<br/>\nI&#39;m afraid if I go too much further levelwise, I wont be able to get this<br/>\nquest.
