Or is the quest<br/>\nonly open for paladins from freeport and below level 9? If that is the<br/>\ncase they should implement more quests that are open to paladins of other<br/>\nraces and higher levels that can give the same result, adding a Sir to<br/>\nyour name.. It would REALLY stink to find out I missed out on this, since<br/>\nat lower levels I was not very interrested in questing at all, I did some<br/>\nquests in my guild but they were very crappy and had puny rewards, like<br/>\nthe Dvinn heart quest, kill a level 25+ npc, get his head and for that you<br/>\nget a few silver.. :/ A quest like the test of truth with a REAL reward<br/>\nwould really improve my view on quests in EQ..<br/>\n<br/>\n- Avron -</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
