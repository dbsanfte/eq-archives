My order of preferred targets is:<br/>\n1. whichever opponent does the most damage<br/>\n2. any spell-casting opponents<br/>\n3. any poisonous or diseased opponents<br/>\n4. anything else<br/>\n<br/>\nThis method has worked pretty good overall so far.  My next refinement is to<br/>\nwork on who gets targetted after the initial assault.  I understand there is a<br/>\ncommand to assist a party member, so I imagine using assist to have all<br/>\ntank-types flogging the appropriate beastie.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaladin, Dwarven Paladin<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n         Gary Long, Vice President, Valley Internet Services<br/>\n         ...Web Commerce is what we do, all day every day...<br/>\nPh:(916)498-1920 Fax:(916)498-1932  1611 S St #202 Sacramento,CA 95814<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.valley-internet.com\">http://www.valley-internet.com</a> -  For all your business hosting needs.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.securetrans.com\">http://www.securetrans.com</a> -  Accept credit cards online in real-time!<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
