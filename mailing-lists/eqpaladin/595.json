Hehe someone on Solusek got it about 3 months ago ;) It&#39;s a bitch to get it though, the two handed mithril sword comes with less effort, and soulfire is CRAP compared to that..<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to guk tonight to try and get ghoulbane, already tried camping it for 7 hours.. I had better luck in lower guk where I got box of abu kar and bag of sewn evil eye in 30 minutes.. And I am only level 28 hehe, but I joined up with a level 45 shaman.. It was a fun ride.. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am gonna take a bath.. bye..<br/>\n<br/>\n- Avron Akizuki(former Elselynn, now married;)<br/>\n- Knight of Truth - Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Thang Tran &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tdt7@...\">tdt7@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 13, 1999 7:49 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqpaladin] [Holy Swords]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Thang Tran&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tdt7@...\">tdt7@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi all<br/>\n&gt; It seems that this mailing list haas gone dead in the pass few weeks or so. <br/>\n&gt; So any news about any other holy swords out there? Soulfire was recently <br/>\n&gt; found on the Cazic Thule server so if u haven&#39;t heard of the stats, u must <br/>\n&gt; be hiding in a cave. I hope Vek Talon reposts the current list of Holy <br/>\n&gt; Swords. I might venture to guk and get GB this weekend so wish me luck and <br/>\n&gt; if adaron is reading this give me a tell on saturday if ur not busy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Elthain Elfstone<br/>\n&gt; Still on that bloody hell lvl 30<br/>\n&gt; Paladin of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist now has T-SHIRTS! <br/>\n&gt; For details and to order, go to: <br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
