They kept <br/>\nspeaking to me and right after I killed one another ran up and yelled, &quot;You <br/>\nkilled my brother! Take this!&quot;<br/>\nAnother said during the fight, &quot;Hhahah! You fight like a halfling!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lizardmen were doing an organized attack which led me to believe they <br/>\nwere being controlled by an intelligent person and not the dumb AI. Plus they <br/>\nkept saying the weirdest stuff at just the right moment (being attacked by a <br/>\nbarbarian, a lizard said &quot;Ooo... big barbarian man can&#39;t kill little lizard!&quot;)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
