They may have had<br/>\nmore than 1 group as well. <br/>\nStats on the awesome Paladin only sword:<br/>\n1H Slash 15DMG 34SPD, and casts Dismiss Undead. <br/>\nImagine being able to double attack for a potential full 30DMG (about 70 to<br/>\n80HP with the level bonuses), and at a speed that is at least 10 to 13<br/>\npoints faster than the Shiny Halberd, and Black Iron Sword. <br/>\nAlso, they can now use a magic shield. The black shield that gives +9 STR<br/>\ncomes to mind. <br/>\nAnyways, a final congrats, and no names are mentioned because of the flood<br/>\nand onslaught of tells and questions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKaane <br/>\nTarrew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
