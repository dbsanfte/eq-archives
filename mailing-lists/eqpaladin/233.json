We are<br/>\nboth on the Bertoxx server and we are pleased to announce that the wedding<br/>\nwas a resounding success! We even had a GM help some spectators get to the<br/>\nisland in the Ocean of Tears, then he stayed for the Ceremony! There will<br/>\nbe screenshots posted on our guild&#39;s web site at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.att.net/~fendain\">http://home.att.net/~fendain</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNow to answer the question:<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI chose a Paladin for many of the same reasons as the rest of you.<br/>\nOn reason is my fascination with the Knight of the Round Table and I<br/>\nfigured that an excellent representation would be a Paladin. I&#39;m<br/>\nhalf-elven and enjoy the advantage of gettin along with Humans and elves.<br/>\nI too play the hero and have sacraficed myself for companions numerous<br/>\ntimes. (maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m still only lvl 12) But I enjoy helping those<br/>\nin need and my gallant nature helps me make friends very easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n(By the way, On the Bertoxx server, you can buy a banded Tunic for 16pp!<br/>\nSomeone I met and helped out has been giving me even better prices than<br/>\nthat too!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also enjoy being able to dish out damamge and laugh when Orc Legions<br/>\nattack me (but I do warn everyone and fight delaying actions when out<br/>\nnumbered 3 to 1 or more, OUCH!) The magic is a nice touch, and I find it<br/>\namusing to see someone watching you get hit over and over, then heal right<br/>\nback up again with LOH. They often times shake there head in wonder, then<br/>\ncompliment me on my prowess. It gives me a warm feeling inside. What can I<br/>\nsay, I enjoy being the envy of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway that&#39;s my dime<br/>\n<br/>\nGeneral Reppik, Clan Battlehammer<br/>\nPaladin of the 12th order Of Erollisi Marr<br/>\nBertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
