I&#39;m Reppik on Bertoxxulous. I too am serving Erollisi Marr<br/>\nand can usually be found in and around Freeport. I&#39;m only Lvl 7 at the<br/>\nmoment however. <br/>\nAs to the quest, I didn&#39;t even know that the quest took you out of<br/>\nFreeport. I had to give up because I couldn&#39;t find anyone that would even<br/>\ntell me about Xyrin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 19 Apr 1999, Ragnarok wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to introduce myself.

You never heard of Povar?! =)  He serves Erollisi Marr 24/7.  I<br/>\n&gt; usually hangs around Freeport area... the commonlands, Desert of Ro, and<br/>\n&gt; Befallen, smiting evil and whatnot.  In any case...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was wondering if anyone did the quest to look for the last Guard Xyrin in<br/>\n&gt; the quest that starts in the Temple of Marr.  Is that a beginner&#39;s quest or<br/>\n&gt; what?  Because I got as far as the isle in the Ocean of Tears talking to all<br/>\n&gt; the Holy Woman O&#39; Fun and I hear a scream come out of nowhere yearning for<br/>\n&gt; help, but I can&#39;t find where it&#39;s coming from!
