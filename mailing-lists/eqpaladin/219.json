Plus the bash stun give <br/>\nme time to run away if that is needed.  Many people compare kick to bash, and <br/>\nI must say that I take the side of bash.  The actual damage done is less than <br/>\nkick.  Bash starts out at ~4 and goes up by 1 point every 15 or 20 points, <br/>\nthat&#39;s my experience anyway, while Kick does 9 max at first and starts to go <br/>\nup once you hit 75 skill.  What people forget is that the occasional stun (25 <br/>\n- 33% of the time?) lets you hit it with your weapon and not get hit back.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know if the stun leaves him open to your attacks, meaning that his AC <br/>\ngoes down, but I&#39;ve found that if the monster is stunned I am usually able to <br/>\nhit him. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tI know I sound like a powergamer, and that&#39;s because I am.  I love to <br/>\nlearn all the inner nuances of a game and use them to my advantage.  Don&#39;t <br/>\nworry I always do bug reports on anything illegal that I find.  What I&#39;m <br/>\ntalking about is the things that you SHOULD know, for instance; what route <br/>\nand NPC takes when it tries to run, which monster carries the best loot and <br/>\ngives you the best XP. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tKnowledge is power.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-Adaron</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
