Like going into a city where evryone spoke High Elf,<br/>\nand no one really spoke common. Those who knew High Elf would be at an<br/>\nadvantage. Im wondering, If I learned troll as a NON-troll race, then got<br/>\nsome good faction not to be KOS and approached an NPC and spoke Troll, maybe<br/>\nI could get a good quest, or at least not be turned away. Or maybe if I was<br/>\na Shadow Knight and learned Gnoll, then spoke with one. Who knows the<br/>\npossiblities. Im sure if Verant thought about it there could really be some<br/>\ngood thing to com e out of it.<br/>\n\tAlso, on the topics of improvement, I would like to see monsters and<br/>\ncreatures actually bad together army style and lay seige to a city. Like<br/>\nseeing a Great Shadow Knight and some Buddys lead an army of Gnolls againt<br/>\nthe city of Quynos. Admittedly alot of newbies would die, but some people<br/>\nwho were of the same class and such may be spared and could actually attack<br/>\na guard and survive. There would be lag due to the high numbers of<br/>\ncharacters on the screen, but who wouldnt like to see that? Or even if a<br/>\nHill Giant could get to quynos and rampage the city, that would be an<br/>\nawesome sight. Its better than spawning little craps about while people<br/>\ncamp. Verant has to mix it up a bit and through a little chaos in the mix.<br/>\nWaiting for Spawn only can yeild a limited amount of enjoyment.<br/>\n\tI would also like to Organize something on Veeshan Server. I sw the<br/>\nclearing of Kerra Isle on Soulsek Ro went amazing (in fact some creative<br/>\nplayers used their cash to arm the Kerrans before the raid, cool) . I think<br/>\nIf I can find enough people on Veeshan that would be interested, we could<br/>\norganize an event like this. Maybe a clearing of Runnyeye? PAW? The Aquaduct<br/>\nof Quynos? This wouldn&#39;t be for EXP or items (though people will get that<br/>\nanyway), but for a fun experience with alot of players. I feel something<br/>\nlike this could only up the interest people have in the game.<br/>\n  <br/>\n -Dyce<br/>\n<br/>\n  -PS- This is only my Opinion...<br/>\n   -email me off the list if you are interested in an Event on Veeshan, dont<br/>\nwant to Spam anyone =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tThang Tran [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tdt7@...\">tdt7@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tWednesday, May 05, 1999 10:03 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqpaladin] languages<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Thang Tran&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tdt7@...\">tdt7@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi<br/>\n&gt; What is the point of wasting time and a practice point on lauguages?
