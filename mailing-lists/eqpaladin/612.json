I&#39;m thinking that Ghoulbane would make a better primary weapon,<br/>\n&gt;since all that&#39;s required is to head into Froglock central and wipe out<br/>\n&gt;a fellow Froggie Paladin. I have a 35th level Magician and 35th level<br/>\n&gt;Druid who could help in this quest, as well as a 20th level Wizard and a<br/>\n&gt;19th level Cleric. Would my party of 5 stand a chance?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;Kaladin, 17th level Paladin of Tunare<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Gary Long, Vice President, Valley Internet Services<br/>\n&gt;         ...Web Commerce is what we do, all day every day...<br/>\n&gt;Ph:(916)498-1920 Fax:(916)498-1932  1611 S St #202 Sacramento,CA 95814<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.valley-internet.com\">http://www.valley-internet.com</a> -  For all your business hosting needs.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.securetrans.com\">http://www.securetrans.com</a> -  Accept credit cards online in real-time!<br/>\n&gt;______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
