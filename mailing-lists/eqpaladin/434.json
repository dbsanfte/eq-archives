If not, than is it true that we could fight as good as those<br/>\nwarriors? If there are skill cap for our combat skills, well, the combat<br/>\nadvantage of us would be to obtain a holy sword, am I right?<br/>\n<br/>\nHope my question is not stupid, I found most of us paladins are hunger for<br/>\nthe sword, and every paladin guide on the net said that the long turn<br/>\nadvantage of paladin in fight is we can get a holy sword (the most powerful<br/>\nweapon in game) someday.   Well, so far as the creation of Vilar, and I<br/>\nfound myself doing very good in combat and also I am eager to reach level9<br/>\nto cast spells. However, I just wondering, is it that important to obtain a<br/>\nholy sword?  If every of us get one, well.......   I myself prefer to be a<br/>\nwarrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a vision, sword is what we hold on our hand, but we are not fight<br/>\nwith the one we are swinging, we fight with the sword in our heart and THAT<br/>\nshould be our holy sword................<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVilar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
