I have seen one being sold for as high as 100 platinum (ouch).  The area that spawns the creature that occasionally has the shield, is always camped, no matter the time of day I try.  A magic shield, as you all know, is a nice benefit to have with the bashing ability, to be able to hit creatures that need magic to cause damage against them.  Let me get to the question before I get to far off here.<br/>\nAre there other magic shields that we as Paladins can use?<br/>\nIf so, would you mind sharing the information.  It does not have to be very specific, just a hint or twelve &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso to comment on something else I read in one of the mails... <br/>\nI would have to agree with the attitude of most people when a &quot;Holy Knight&quot; comes to the rescue (more often to our folly as the &quot;rescuees&quot; run and the &quot;rescuer&quot; gets stuck with the fiends) and either lays hands or heals to the end of mana, as being less than satisfying.  I however, feel like I helped someone, albeit most likely someone who will watch me die in the future and not lift a finger to help.  I think my chances are a bit better for someone to help me if I help others and not watch another die while not even trying to help.  Also from a role-playing aspect, I do believe the right thing is being done, never would a Paladin turn his head to such persons in distress.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
