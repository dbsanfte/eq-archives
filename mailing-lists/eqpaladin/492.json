That aside, I practiced it by finding<br/>\nany undead I could kill (first decaying skeletons in<br/>\nthe newbie area, then zombies, mummies, and even a<br/>\nghoul); Warding to start the fight, then killing it. <br/>\nThen I targeted the corpse and sat next to it Warding<br/>\nand meditating as needed, until the corpse would<br/>\nfinally go away.<br/>\n<br/>\nI brought Ward up to 52 in two hours of this, and<br/>\nreduced the fizzles considerably.  I went to Unrest<br/>\nshortly after and now often use Ward to finish fights<br/>\nwhen the mob starts running.  My skill&#39;s currently at<br/>\n69 (dude!), and should continue to increase.  I<br/>\nsuppose I could level cap it to 95 in less than an<br/>\nhour if I repeated the same procedure, but I haven&#39;t<br/>\nbothered yet; it&#39;s moving up faster than I&#39;m leveling.<br/>\n Fizzle rate is less than 3 in 10 (most I&#39;ve ever had<br/>\nis 2 fizzles before getting it off).<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
