If you so agree he<br/>\ntells you to bring him an orc oracle scroll. These scrolls are only found on<br/>\noracles that spawn in and near the orc castle in crushbone (I have never<br/>\nwitnessed nor heard of one spawning in the village). <br/>\n<br/>\nProblems:<br/>\n1) These oracles in crushbone are incredibly difficult to kill and should<br/>\nonly be attempted at lvl 10 plus<br/>\n2) Most often you will have to engage the oracle as well as several<br/>\nlegionnaires and many of the other castle inhabitants (Royal Guards,<br/>\nProphet, Emissary, Emperor Crush and don&#39;t forget Dvinn)...All of which are<br/>\nincredibly difficult to defeat and I have only seen players defeat Dvinn<br/>\nonce and heard of another time but never solo.<br/>\n3) The reward from this quest was roughly 12 silver and some exp (not a<br/>\nnoticeable gain at lvl 11)<br/>\n<br/>\nNotes:<br/>\nAfter returning the scroll and completing the quest he did say that it was<br/>\ntoo bad I wasn&#39;t a defender. Not sure what was meant by that. All in all I<br/>\nwould suggest that if you get a scroll while out adventuring you made 12<br/>\nsilver and a little exp but I would not go out of your way to complete this<br/>\nquest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSilvermyst<br/>\nHigh Elf Paladin 11th Order<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I have a character in Halas that I would like to relocate to freeport<br/>\nand would appreciate any directions you could provide.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
