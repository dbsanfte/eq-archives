Probably <br/>\nwill have a fighter type along also like a monk.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first attacked him I was able to get him to below half hits several <br/>\ntimes. then he would run and I would get out of range..  eventually he killed <br/>\nme.

Self, I say, why not go and take out Narls so you can do that<br/>\n&gt; quest?  Well, with about 287hp (God, I love bravery), a 1h slash skill of<br/>\n&gt; 33, full leather armor, and about five lesser heals thrown onto me by some<br/>\n&gt; nice wandering cleric, I managed to hit Narls five time before I died.  Once<br/>\n&gt; for 10, once for 8, and three times for 1.  Now, Narls is green to me, and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m afraid if I go too much further levelwise, I wont be able to get this<br/>\n&gt; quest.
