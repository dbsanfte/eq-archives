That would be my race if I started again.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my take on these questions (from a L32 High Elf Paladin on the Tunare server):<br/>\n<br/>\n* 1 and 5 - Forget about the meagre hp difference related to stamina; don&#39;t put any points here as a dwarf.  Bottom line is that you will have a lot of hps either way.  You will get absolutely pelted by high level mobs (getting whacked by a sand giant for 80 80 a round, for example) and, since you will require a lot of healing and be dependent on clerics (druids, shaman etc) for this, it doesn&#39;t matter if you have 100 extra hps by level 50 or not;<br/>\n* 2 - In my opinion, the key stats are dexterity and agility.  Your strength at 100 is certainly high enough.  Your dex needs to be high to hit yellow and red con mobs at high levels.  Your agi needs to be high to avoid being hit - just remember that you are going to need to be healed a hell of a lot anyway.  I&#39;d suggest dumping points into dex and agi, looking to balance them.<br/>\n* 3 - Humans level faster, but big deal in the long run.  Paladins level slow as a general rule anyway.<br/>\n* 4 - Charisma effects prices but buy L20 you won&#39;t care one ioata about the prices you sell things for to npcs - most of the important stuff is player to player trading.  You can make a couple of hundred pp a day selling rare items to players, and often ignore loot which you think that you&#39;d enjoy selling to vendors.  It&#39;s often better to just destroy items than trudge all the way back to town just for a few pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, just on the impact of int on raising your skills - do not be concerned at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nLlorfindal<br/>\nHigh Elf Paladin of Tunare.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Dragon [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dracon@...\">dracon@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 9 June 1999 8:08 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqpaladin] Starting a paladin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Dragon &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dracon@...\">dracon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n I have decided that i will play either a human or dwarf paladin and will<br/>\nlike to ask some questions. Any help is greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Will human gets alot less HP per level at 80 STA than dwarf which has 95<br/>\nSTA?<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  I will like to know how do i distribute the points to make the dwarf<br/>\npaladin better in melee( more STR, STA,  AGI or DEX , which stat is better?)<br/>\n<br/>\n3) does human paladin level alot faster than dwarf paladin?<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Do dwarf paladins get very lousy prices when buying or selling at 55<br/>\ncharisma compared to a human 85 (how significant is the difference), will<br/>\ncharisma affect the prices when u deal with your own guild ?<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Anyone has any formula in calculating Hitpoint gained per level? Is the<br/>\ndifference significant for a 80 STA and 95 STA?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Rogers wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: David Rogers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:derogers334@...\">derogers334@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- Dragon &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dracon@...\">dracon@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Will Dwarf&#39;s 60 INT makes increment in skill point<br/>\n&gt; &gt; REAL slow??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t had any unplayable problems.
