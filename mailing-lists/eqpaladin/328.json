I currently have a Shiny Brass<br/>\nShield which is AC 10 and gives you +10 to magic resistance and puts off<br/>\nlight like a Lightstone.  Additionally, it is magic, so you can bash wisps<br/>\nand ice boned skeleton&#39;s with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn another post, I saw a message about another shield which I hope to obtain<br/>\nsomeday.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe premier shield is the Darkwood Shield obtainable from a named Gnoll in<br/>\nHighpass Hold, towards the Karana end.  The area is continuously camped so<br/>\nbring a wizard friend, preferably of an obscene level.  Between the rare<br/>\nspawn and the campers, do not be surprised if it takes you all day<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shield offers +9 to STR and AC12.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s usefulness peaks at around L30 for a paladin when one obtains<br/>\nGhoulbane.  You are far better off using 2HS at lower levels and capitalise<br/>\non double attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Gary Long [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:glong@...\">glong@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 25, 1999 11:20 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqpaladin] Keeping the Paladin alive<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Gary Long &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:glong@...\">glong@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMxyzptlk wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Are there other magic shields that we as Paladins can use? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
