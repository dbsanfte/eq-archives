I am currently a lvl 12 (1<br/>\n&gt;bubble to 13th) High<br/>\n&gt;Elf Paladin currently operating on the Cazic Thule server on the continent<br/>\n&gt;of Faydwer and<br/>\n&gt;I made a horrible mistake. I rushed into joining a guild not knowing what<br/>\n&gt;type of people<br/>\n&gt;the guild was and more wanting brotherhood then anything else. To my horror<br/>\n&gt;I realized I<br/>\n&gt;had joined a gang of petty kill stealing, cheat exploiting, bug exploiting<br/>\n&gt;thugs. My problem<br/>\n&gt;is that the guild officers refuse to allow me to leave the guild and was<br/>\n&gt;hoping someone<br/>\n&gt;could tell me a way that I can quit the guild without being removed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thank you all and may Tunare bless you all and may your blades find there<br/>\n&gt;mark<br/>\n&gt;Sol<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
