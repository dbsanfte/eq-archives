The next<br/>\n&gt; steps up are Barbed Leather Whip and Polished Granite<br/>\n&gt; Tomahawk.  BLW goes for about 150pp, PGT about 250pp.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are also good magical 2h weapons like bone bladed claymore (17/45,<br/>\ncosts around 250pp, but i heard you can get it in Befallen for as low as<br/>\n150pp) or blackened iron bastard sword (20/47, costs around 500pp, maybe<br/>\nless in Runnyeye). But till 20 lvl your damage is limited to ~35, as<br/>\nsoon as you will raise to 20 you will start make 40+ damage with BBC or<br/>\neven more with BIB.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; 5) What types of armor should I be looking for?<br/>\n&gt; Full bronze plus magic.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is better to buy bronze armor in zones where monsters drop it. Just<br/>\nmake sure these monsters drop bronze of your size (for example, in<br/>\nUnrest monsters drop small sized bronze). But for your level, it is<br/>\nbetter to loot bronze, not buy it :) With good group you can easely kill<br/>\ndry bones, and get bronze and exp simultaneously. You can even solo them<br/>\nat ~20 level.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nDmitry M.
