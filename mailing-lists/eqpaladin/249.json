I mean the one that sells purses and<br/>\nbelt pouches, not the backpack at a guild vendor or the large bag at the<br/>\ndocks.  Anyone know if the bag/box merchant exists in FP?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I know that in Felwithe there are red wooden shields which are very<br/>\nstriking and different looking than the normal round or targ ones.  Has<br/>\nanyone seen these for sale in Freeport either?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
