I thought about <br/>\nplaying a ranger at first, but then decided on the paladin.  Why?  Because <br/>\nthe paladin has better buffs, better heals, and is better at physical combat. <br/>\n As for the physical combat, the paladin has holy swords (I&#39;m gonna try and <br/>\nget Ghoulbane soon, pray for me) and is able to wear plate.  Some might say <br/>\nthat rangers are able to dodge more and I agree with them, but if you put <br/>\nmore points into Agility when you make your character, you can have as much <br/>\nif not more AC than a ranger.  Remember that the armor they can wear is <br/>\nlimited to chain (well banded too) while a paladin can wear plate.  Also at <br/>\n15th we get lesser heal while they have to wait till 22nd to get it.  We are <br/>\nalso the only hybrids able to cast Greater Heal for 400 HP. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I want to know is why so many paladins are High Elves, the dwarves stats <br/>\nare much better.  Just put 10 in agility and 10 in intelligence and you&#39;ll <br/>\nhave one great warrior. <br/>\n<br/>\ngotta admit that the charisma sucks though, but you can always have your <br/>\nenchanter friend buy stuff for you =)<br/>\n<br/>\n   -Adaron, 17th level Paladin.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
