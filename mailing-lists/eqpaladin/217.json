Then, use the best sword that you have, irrespective of 1h or 2h.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use a 2hs shiny brass halberd with pretty impressive stats and I hit for 34 34 often when my double attack clicks in.  Compare that to 1hs combine long and bash... which does around 15 15 and 8 - All of those attacks... and it adds up to just 1 of my double hits.  Also, bash is slowish to reset... meaning that you don&#39;t get to use it as quickly as your weapon.... making the comparison worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, when I get Ghoulbane, I&#39;ll go back to 1hs - especially when fighting undead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, after getting the Great Zweihander or Soulfire, I&#39;ll be back to 2hs.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust depends on what is the best weapon that you have.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think bash is pretty ordinary.  Some people argue that it gives you time to get a heal off on yourself - once you hit L22 or higher... you&#39;re much better off rooting your opponent, backing back, getting in half a dozen heals, then rejoining the fray.  Also, I don&#39;t bother using ward in combat with undead anymore either... unless to initiate an attack or kill a runner... so I don&#39;t need it to time my ward casting (and, if I do use ward, I normally dodge and parry myself out of trouble anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nLlorfindal<br/>\nPaladin of Tunare.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Clanretri@...\">Clanretri@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Clanretri@...\">Clanretri@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, 7 May 1999 10:42 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqpaladin] bone baded claymore<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Clanretri@...\">Clanretri@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFor paladin, you will definitly want to go with 1h slashing,  the <br/>\ndelay/damage ratio is quite balanced for 1h and 2h with 2h having a bit <br/>\nadvantage when used with double attack, yet you cant use a shield and more <br/>\nimportantly you cant use bash, one of the most important skill for paladin <br/>\nsecond to lay hand. And of course there are the holy swords, the ones we know <br/>\nare 1h.  So choose well and follow your heart. heh<br/>\n<br/>\nBoba<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWho offers the richest group communications tools on the Internet?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAnswer:  ONElist.
