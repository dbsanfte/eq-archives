It&#39;s a long trip but<br/>\nit is doable.  I&#39;ve tried it twice now, once I fell off a wall for 361<br/>\nhp of damage and the other I died alone in Runnyeye (I was the only<br/>\nperson in the entire zone heh).  You may not be interested in Halas to<br/>\nQeynos hills but the rest of the journey may be helpful to those from<br/>\nQeynos desiring to head east.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow are instructions as told to me by Moro (met on Rathe) and verified<br/>\nup to the unfortunate RunnyEye incident.  First before you leave put<br/>\nyour stuff in the bank and GET A LIGHT SOURCE.  You can make it to<br/>\nQeynos and kill fire beetles to get their eyes if you prefer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve added this to my EQ page also on which you may find other<br/>\ninteresting items:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soldbuysam.com/shawn&#39;s_place/eq/everquest.asp\">http://www.soldbuysam.com/shawn&#39;s_place/eq/everquest.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nShawn<br/>\n<br/>\nEverfrost:<br/>\nHeading down from Halas exit stay pretty much to the right the entire<br/>\nway.  There are some little dead ends but the route is pretty straight<br/>\nforward.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll eventually end up at a cavern entrance.  It is guraded by a<br/>\nscrawny gnoll I believe which is always dead whenever I&#39;ve gone through<br/>\n(thanks to other people).  The tunnel winds a ways down.  It&#39;s dark and<br/>\nyou may not have a light source yet.  There are torches on the walls<br/>\nproviding light spaced just far enough apart that you will be in the<br/>\ndark for a few steps till you turn a corner.  The way I did it was to<br/>\nturn around and face the torch I could see and back up till I backed<br/>\naround the corner then I turned to the new torch.  Do this a few times<br/>\nand you&#39;ll zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlackburrow:<br/>\nThis is pretty funny.  The zone exit to Qeynos hills is about 20 seconds<br/>\naway.  When you enter you&#39;ll be in a small tunnel.  Follow it out.<br/>\nThere are gnolls all over in this area (you&#39;re in their home).  Probly<br/>\nthere will be lots of people too.  When you exit from the tunnel you&#39;ll<br/>\nsee a pit in front of you with a waterfall spilling into it.  Go to the<br/>\nleft around the pit.  A hard left will lead you to a door.  Don&#39;t go in<br/>\nthere, that goes down to bad gnoll land.  The next tunnel beyond that<br/>\naround the pit will zone you.<br/>\n<br/>\nQeynos Hills:<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t have a light source, get one here somewhere as it&#39;ll be the<br/>\nlast chance (other than to bum something from another player).  You&#39;ll<br/>\nexit into a broad open area.  Take a left and follow a valley staying on<br/>\nthe left side up a ways on the wall.  Watch for rabid wolves and<br/>\ngrizzleys.  After a couple of minutes you&#39;ll come to a path.  Right<br/>\nleads to Qeynos, left leads to the plains.  Go left and follow into a<br/>\ncanyon.  You&#39;ll zone a little ways in, no danger in there unless someone<br/>\nbrought it with them I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nWest Plains:<br/>\nOh man, this place is huge.  Upon entering follow the path till you<br/>\nleave the canyon.  Turn right.  Go straight and a little more right (you<br/>\nwant South) till you hit a river/sea.  This runs along the south side of<br/>\nthis entire zone.  If you get lost I guess make sure you try to head<br/>\nsouth.  I wouldn&#39;t wander out there though...  Once you hit the river<br/>\ntake a left and follow it a long long long long long long ways.  Like<br/>\nrunning for almost 10 minutes long.  No danger really along the water<br/>\nthat I saw.<br/>\n<br/>\nEast Plains:<br/>\nStill running along the river with it on your right.  Keep an eye out<br/>\nahead as there is a raider group that sits by the water waiting for<br/>\npeople like you running along the water.  Other than them no problem<br/>\njust don&#39;t go explore up the river bank.  Except for going around them<br/>\n(watch for lionness and griffawn) don&#39;t go away from the water.  You&#39;ll<br/>\npass a bridge, you don&#39;t want this one.  When you come to the next<br/>\nbridge (suspension like) with chains turn right and cross bridge.<br/>\n<br/>\nNorth Plains:<br/>\nTake a left off of the bridge.  The river is now on your left.  A ways<br/>\nahead you&#39;ll see probably a cyclops out in the water to your left (named<br/>\nBoron or something).  On your right are lions probably and some ruins up<br/>\non the right.  You need to get far enough away from the water but also<br/>\nstay away from the lions.  Go through this area till a little bit<br/>\nfarther you&#39;ll hit the zone boundary but can&#39;t go through there.  Take a<br/>\nright and hug the boundary which is now on your left and you left the<br/>\nriver behind you.  There is some kind of camp on the right and there<br/>\nwere gorge wolves wandering around down below.  Stay up and you should<br/>\nbe ok.  After a short run (couple of minutes) you&#39;ll drop down to the<br/>\nvalley floor with a canyon to your left.  Go left keeping an eye for<br/>\nstuff running from your right probably. You&#39;ll zone soon down that<br/>\ncanyon so if something is chasing you you&#39;ll probably be OK.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeholder Maze:<br/>\nI would wait till day and wait till some people clear out the goblins<br/>\nand minotaurs you&#39;ll see when you zone in.  The trick to getting through<br/>\nhere is listen for stuff coming and always keep to the right wall.  Hug<br/>\nthe wall around to the right and you&#39;ll come to the zone exit soon.  If<br/>\nstuff is chasing you, when you see the tunnel entrance you&#39;re almost<br/>\nsafe, just a few steps in is the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nRunnyEye:<br/>\nDO NOT ATTEMPT WITHOUT LIGHT.  This is where I made my mistake and as<br/>\nfar as I&#39;ve gone so far.  The trick to getting through here I was told<br/>\nis to stay left.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very far because there was one<br/>\nother person who zoned in with me and before I could say something they<br/>\nran off.  Then when they didn&#39;t answer my hails I did a /who and found I<br/>\nwas alone.  So, either that person died or zoned.<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty Thicket:<br/>\nNo Info Yet</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
