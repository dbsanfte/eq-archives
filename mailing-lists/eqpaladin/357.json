Plus it occasionally casts Lifetap.  I bought one from someone for 20pp. I have heard comments from many people, some say it is a good price, others disagree.  Personally I find it to be a cool looking but not very effective weapon, especially compared with the mino axe or dwarven 1H axe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverius, Lv11 High Elf Paladin, The Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Thanks for the info, maybe what I want does not exist - a magical one-handed<br/>\n </span></blockquote>slashing weapon for around 10-25 platinum?
