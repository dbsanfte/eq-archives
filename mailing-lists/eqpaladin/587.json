Around level 10-15 I did a few quests for the knights of truth in north freeport, the test of truth and some parts of the soulfire quest, this made the militia hate me, infact they scowls at me ready to attack..<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, about a month ago I god engaged with someone and we agreed to marry in freeport, and since I am KOS with militia I decided to fix this faction asap, so I went to highpass.. Now after a month in highpass/keep, turning in over 350 scalps and goblin ears, I went back to freeport.. They still scowl at me! How can this be? I even BOUGHT scalps and ears!! I bet my trousers that I could have more easily become friends with darkelves than militia.. Quite frankly this sucks alot, because now I can&#39;t get married in freeport as planned.. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any tips or tricks to fix freeport militia faction? Anyways, screw my reputation, tomorrow I will begin killing knights of truth to fix it because I AM getting married..<br/>\n<br/>\n- Avron -</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
