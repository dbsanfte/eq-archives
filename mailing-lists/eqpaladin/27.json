I have been working on<br/>\na quest and need some help.  I&#39;ll list what I know below my questions<br/>\n(below a spoiler warning):<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to know when Grolaf Steadirt leaves his shop and heads to the inn<br/>\nfor a drink so that I can talk to him.  The time of day and which inn<br/>\nwould be very helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for what I know: (might be considered a spoiler though not complete)<br/>\nx<br/>\nx<br/>\nx<br/>\nx<br/>\nx<br/>\nx<br/>\nx<br/>\nx<br/>\nx<br/>\nx<br/>\nx<br/>\nI received the quest from the female paladin on the upstairs balcony of<br/>\nthe freeport paladin&#39;s guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe asked me to take a note to an informant they have in the Freeport<br/>\nmilitia. I should say &quot;Truth is Good&quot; to the guards and the correct one<br/>\nwould respond to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found him in west freeport behind the milita house.  sorry, don&#39;t have<br/>\nmy notes here so can&#39;t remember his name.  He asks for a note you were<br/>\ngiven, you give it to him, and after he gives you something to take<br/>\nback.  A note with coded info and a title at the top Zimel&#39;s Blades<br/>\n<br/>\nafter reporting back you are sent to the hall of records to talk to<br/>\nRashinda.  She was a total pain in the butt to get her to respond to my<br/>\nquestion.  Again, I don&#39;t have my notes but it was something like &quot;can<br/>\nyou tell me if zimel&#39;s blades existed&quot;.  Once she responds a strange<br/>\nthing happens.  A male NPC enters the room and says &quot;excuse me, wrong<br/>\nroom&quot; so he is triggered by talking to Rashinda.  Not sure what he means<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter you get her to respond you ask &quot;Who is Ariska Zimel ?&quot; I think I<br/>\nspelled his name right...  She will tell you about him and mention<br/>\nGroflah Steadirt (in Groflah&#39;s Armor place).  It is up to you to make<br/>\nthe associated to talk to Groflah.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you find him (upstairs) and ask him about Zimel he responds that he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know any Zimel and that he can&#39;t talk there.  It is here that<br/>\nI&#39;m stuck.  I&#39;ve heard he leaves and goes to get a drink but I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow when or where.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help<br/>\nShawn<br/>\nFlarfianb, level 4 paladin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
