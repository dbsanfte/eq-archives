I just obtained 15th<br/>\n&gt; level and the Hammer of Wrath spell.  Now when i summon this thing and<br/>\n&gt; then have it in my possesion I can right click it and it says that it is a<br/>\n&gt; MAGIC ITEM, but I went to Befallen last night and when I tried to hit an<br/>\n&gt; Ice Boned Skeleton with it, it said that the skele was invulnerable!  I<br/>\n&gt; thought that I would be able to hit creatures that were only susceptible<br/>\n&gt; to magic attack with this hammer, you know, things like Willow Wisps and<br/>\n&gt; the such?  Does anyone know what the deal is with this?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
