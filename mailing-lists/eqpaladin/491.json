I<br/>\ndid that, picked the undead that was<br/>\nalone, killed it and practice on his corpse, when<br/>\nit disapeared I killed another and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope it helps you.<br/>\n<br/>\nZelgadus Brightblade<br/>\n21st level Paladin of Mithaniel Marr<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
