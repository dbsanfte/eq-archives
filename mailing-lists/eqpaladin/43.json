LOL!)  and I&#39;m currently playing in the Qeynos<br/>\narea.  It turns out there ARE trainers for us in Qeynos - it took me a while<br/>\nto find them - they are thru the passageway to the right of the arena<br/>\nentrance.  Also, if you see I&#39;m on in the game (/who kaladin all) I&#39;d be<br/>\nglad to tailor up some patchwork for my fellow paladins! This will save you<br/>\nfrom having to put those valuable practice points into a skill that gets (in<br/>\nmy limited experience) used very rarely once you have a set of armor.  I<br/>\nalready spent &#39;em, already got my own armor, and don&#39;t mind helping you to<br/>\nsave your valuable training points.  Patchwork helps you take less damage in<br/>\ncombat!<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease bring your own pelts & patterns, otherwise I&#39;ll help you hunt down<br/>\nthe pelts & patterns (6sp, 6cp per pattern from the NPC merchant).  This<br/>\nhelps me meet fellow paladins, maybe provides a little adventure from Lion,<br/>\nWolf, and Bear hunting, and helps keep yer hide intact with no practice<br/>\npoints and very little silver spent.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep the faith & Bring Pride on Our Guild, Brothers & Sisters!<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n         Gary Long, Vice President, Valley Internet Services<br/>\n         ...Web Commerce is what we do, all day every day...<br/>\nPh:(916)498-1920 Fax:(916)498-1932  1611 S St #202 Sacramento,CA 95814<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.valley-internet.com\">http://www.valley-internet.com</a> -  For all your business hosting needs.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.securetrans.com\">http://www.securetrans.com</a> -  Accept credit cards online in real-time!<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
