If you<br/>\ncan put up with your agility being knocked down, it is lighter than the<br/>\nshiny brass halberd which for some of us is of more importance.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote, that the Obsidian Flamberge is usable by Paladins.  This would make a<br/>\ngood low to high 20&#39;s two handed sword.  As to letting one skill drop in<br/>\nfavor of the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI carry both serrated bone blade 1h slash with characteristics similar to<br/>\nthe combine long sword, and shield.  Plus a bone bladed claymore.  You<br/>\ncannot beat the damage the 2 handed sword does, especially if you can find a<br/>\ncaster that can quicken you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one handed slash and shield is a great alternative if fighting casters.<br/>\nYou need the speed and hits to interrupt their spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck brothers<br/>\nSyrel Feyn<br/>\nPaladin of the 22nd season<br/>\nServant of Tunare.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
