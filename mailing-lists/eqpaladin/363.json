This is gonna be great!  Do you realize you can knock<br/>\n&gt; off <br/>\n&gt; about 90 HP before the monster even gets to you thanks to archery?  Well,<br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; talked to my ranger friend and I got a few tips for you paladins out there<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (including me) who are going to start using bows for combat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Find Pine Needles or a Tiny Dagger.  Both use archery skill but they<br/>\n&gt; are a <br/>\n&gt; melee weapon.  Hang out in a place where there are blue mobs that other <br/>\n&gt; people fight, such as trainer hill or somesuch area, and (after getting<br/>\n&gt; their <br/>\n&gt; permission) attack the monster with the pine needle/tiny dagger.  They<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; mind because you can only do one dmg with it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2) Spend points on fletching and try to use it as much as possible, making<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; regular arrows with no skill in fletching is still a 50% (?) chance of <br/>\n&gt; success. Also making your own arrows costs 4 cp while buying them is<br/>\n&gt; ~7-10. <br/>\n&gt; Oh and if you hunt in blackburrow the gnolls occasionally drop arrows and <br/>\n&gt; worn hunting bows.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3) Speaking of dropped bows, don&#39;t use them! Even the worst of the player <br/>\n&gt; made bows are better than the mightiest NPC bow (except for magical, but I<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; mean regulars). From what he told me, most sell for 6-12 plat. I think he<br/>\n&gt; was <br/>\n&gt; referring to the easiest ones to make.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4) Once you get high enough (22 for us, 9 for rangers) to root your<br/>\n&gt; opponent, <br/>\n&gt; you will know the true power of archery. You can easily bring him down to <br/>\n&gt; half health with only a few arrows. This will also make up for our lack of<br/>\n&gt; DD <br/>\n&gt; spells vs. living creatures, both as a lure and finisher and even combat <br/>\n&gt; support. Though melee is our forte&#39; having some  ranged skill will be <br/>\n&gt; undoubtedly helpful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 5) When buying a playermade bow, look for the best dmg. If you have a<br/>\n&gt; choice <br/>\n&gt; between a 9 dmg 40 delay and an 11 dmg 50 delay (theoretically speaking. I<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know the actual stats) you should choose the higher damage one<br/>\n&gt; because <br/>\n&gt; when you have no root spell and they jump on you, you want to hit them for<br/>\n&gt; as <br/>\n&gt; much as possible in the time allotted.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 6) Read this guide, it is one of the best I have ever found: <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.gamestats.com/Skills/Archery.htm\">http://everquest.gamestats.com/Skills/Archery.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And for fletching:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.gamestats.com/Skills/Fletching.htm\">http://everquest.gamestats.com/Skills/Fletching.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tIt is a shame that I can&#39;t find the URL for the Crossroads of <br/>\n&gt; Norrath, they had an amazing guide about fletching.  Showed you the costs <br/>\n&gt; required and compared the dmg caused by a bow to a great staff.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tOh, and a little trick that my friend taught me.  If you consider <br/>\n&gt; this an exploit or something, tough.  It is not.  Put all of your<br/>\n&gt; containers <br/>\n&gt; in the bank except for your fletching kit.  Take your food and put one<br/>\n&gt; food <br/>\n&gt; in each of your slots on your main inventory, so you&#39;ll have the kit and 7<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; food/water on your inventory.  Now goto the fletching guy and buy one<br/>\n&gt; supply <br/>\n&gt; of each needed for the arrow, click combine and Vwala (or however you say<br/>\n&gt; it) <br/>\n&gt; you have an arrow without having to click 500 times.  Put the arrow on<br/>\n&gt; your <br/>\n&gt; ammo slot and do it again.  See?  That wasn&#39;t an exploit!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tGoodluck everyone, I really do suggest you try archery as one of<br/>\n&gt; your <br/>\n&gt; combat skills.  It will pay off in the end, I assure you. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t-Adaron<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
