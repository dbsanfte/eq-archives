Finally, Verant claims we will get the best magical<br/>\nweapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the role-playing advantages:<br/>\nPaladins are trusted me more people. You get to play the hero, saving people<br/>\nand dying for a good cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I don&#39;t like it that it takes me longer to gain a level.

This is a question posed to everyone who has subscribed to<br/>\n&gt; this list. Why did you choose to play a paladin? No matter your reasons,<br/>\n&gt; share them with us. Hopefully everyone here is mature enough not to flame<br/>\n&gt; people for their reasons and what not. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
