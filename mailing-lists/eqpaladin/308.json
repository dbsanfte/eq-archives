I have one<br/>\n&gt; now after watching the message rooms closely and continuosly watching<br/>\n&gt; auctions in the game.  I happened on someone who sold it to me for 20 plat,<br/>\n&gt; good deal.  I have seen people asking as much 30-40 plat.  It is nice having<br/>\n&gt; this shield.  It puts off light like a lightstone and adds to magic<br/>\n&gt; resistance as well as having 10 ac and being a magic item you can bash magic<br/>\n&gt; creatures with.  They are pretty rare from what I can find out.  Right now I<br/>\n&gt; am trying to obtain a 2h shiny brass halberd.  I have seen people selling<br/>\n&gt; them but haven&#39;t been able to hook up with anyone and purchase one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Grod<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Mxyzptlk [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hlf10@...\">hlf10@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 24, 1999 5:02 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqpaladin] Keeping the Paladin alive<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Mxyzptlk &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hlf10@...\">hlf10@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To answer a few questions first:<br/>\n&gt; I play on the Rathe server as a humble Dwarf Paladin named &quot;Dauldon<br/>\n&gt; Blackstone&quot;<br/>\n&gt; I was wondering about the list myself, glad to see it is still here.<br/>\n&gt; I have not seen any remnants of the Elven empire in the deserts of Ro.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A question:<br/>\n&gt; I am not certain how the other servers operate, however on Rathe, it seems<br/>\n&gt; that a shiny brass shield is now one of the more rare items in the game.  I<br/>\n&gt; have seen one being sold for as high as 100 platinum (ouch).  The area that<br/>\n&gt; spawns the creature that occasionally has the shield, is always camped, no<br/>\n&gt; matter the time of day I try.  A magic shield, as you all know, is a nice<br/>\n&gt; benefit to have with the bashing ability, to be able to hit creatures that<br/>\n&gt; need magic to cause damage against them.  Let me get to the question before<br/>\n&gt; I get to far off here.<br/>\n&gt; Are there other magic shields that we as Paladins can use?<br/>\n&gt; If so, would you mind sharing the information.  It does not have to be very<br/>\n&gt; specific, just a hint or twelve &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also to comment on something else I read in one of the mails... <br/>\n&gt; I would have to agree with the attitude of most people when a &quot;Holy Knight&quot;<br/>\n&gt; comes to the rescue (more often to our folly as the &quot;rescuees&quot; run and the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;rescuer&quot; gets stuck with the fiends) and either lays hands or heals to the<br/>\n&gt; end of mana, as being less than satisfying.  I however, feel like I helped<br/>\n&gt; someone, albeit most likely someone who will watch me die in the future and<br/>\n&gt; not lift a finger to help.  I think my chances are a bit better for someone<br/>\n&gt; to help me if I help others and not watch another die while not even trying<br/>\n&gt; to help.  Also from a role-playing aspect, I do believe the right thing is<br/>\n&gt; being done, never would a Paladin turn his head to such persons in distress.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
