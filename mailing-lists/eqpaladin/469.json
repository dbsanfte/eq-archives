Any help is greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Will human gets alot less HP per level at 80 STA than dwarf which has 95<br/>\nSTA?<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  I will like to know how do i distribute the points to make the dwarf<br/>\npaladin better in melee( more STR, STA,  AGI or DEX , which stat is better?)<br/>\n<br/>\n3) does human paladin level alot faster than dwarf paladin?<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Do dwarf paladins get very lousy prices when buying or selling at 55<br/>\ncharisma compared to a human 85 (how significant is the difference), will<br/>\ncharisma affect the prices when u deal with your own guild ?<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Anyone has any formula in calculating Hitpoint gained per level? Is the<br/>\ndifference significant for a 80 STA and 95 STA?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Rogers wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: David Rogers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:derogers334@...\">derogers334@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- Dragon &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dracon@...\">dracon@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Will Dwarf&#39;s 60 INT makes increment in skill point<br/>\n&gt; &gt; REAL slow??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t had any unplayable problems.
