I also really hate it when I use LOH on the MOB I&#39;m <br/>\n*trying to<br/>\n*kill....  It never seems to appreciate it.<br/>\n*<br/>\n<br/>\n/smile Aye, I remember the early days of a Paladin&#39;s road. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, unless I have a high level druid or wizard friend do a group<br/>\ntransport, I am running the land.  But!  The peril you encounter along the<br/>\nway!  The friends you make and the enemies you earn!  Much more exciting. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, after a long hiatus from my Paladin, I made the newbie (no offense)<br/>\nmistake of hitting LOH when the monster was still targeted.  My solution<br/>\n(works for me, at least) is that I moved the hotbutton from the first bank<br/>\nof buttons with my combat buttons to the second one, so that when I think to<br/>\nchange button banks I also think to change targets.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMay Tunare bless and keep you (and Erollisi Marr, although now in Final we<br/>\nhigh elves aren&#39;t permitted to worship her as Paladins... *grumble*)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
