This also affects skill progression especially in the craft type skills (smithing etc...)  though I found it less of a problem with melee and spell casting as it took long enough to level that I had no trouble maxing out my melee skills...<br/>\n<br/>\nI found it difficult to keep pace with some of my friends whom played elves largely and often a non hybrid class...<br/>\nHowever it is a race/class combination I intend to stay with so good luck on your choice<br/>\n<br/>\nOne bit of advice I will recommend however is to max out as many melee skills as you can as you level, i.e. 1+2 hand blunt, 1+2 hand swords etc....  You will not likely have trouble maxing them all out as you level, but it can be an inconvenience to try and raise then later in life...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Naeeldar &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Thursday, September 09, 1999 4:39 PM<br/>\n    Subject: Re: [eqpaladin] Solusek Ro wedding<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Hey I just started a Dwarven Paladin and I was wondering if there was anything I should know about.
