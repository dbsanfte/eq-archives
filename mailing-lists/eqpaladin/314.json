By","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1103640422\">I have found that the best way to improve your 1H blunt is to get a party<br/>\ntogether of at least 2 tanks (yourself being one) and a couple of magic<br/>\nusers. By going to the mino caves (Steamfont) and drawing out trains, I have<br/>\ngotten my skill up to 72. it took forever to get those first 20, but after<br/>\nthat it went pretty fast. it usually helps if the other tank is a higher<br/>\nlevel than you and pretty good at taunting. be sure to always carry your<br/>\nbetter weapon with you, though, as emergencies can arise pretty fast with a<br/>\ntrain of 3 blue conning minos.<br/>\n<br/>\nEglath (one of those High Elf chicks..) *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;By G&#39;Quon, I cannot remember the last time I was in a fight like that! No<br/>\nmoral ambiguity. No ancient and overpowering Enemy. They were, as you say,<br/>\nthe Bad Guys, and we were the Good Guys....and they made a very satisfying<br/>\n*thump* when they hit the ground!&quot;<br/>\n--G&#39;Kar, A Late Delivery from Avalon<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 24 May 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RangerDest@...\">RangerDest@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RangerDest@...\">RangerDest@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tYeah.  I agree with your conclusions of Strength.  So far I get one <br/>\n&gt; ATK for every STR I have (once in a while it is 2 ATK per).  It really all <br/>\n&gt; depends on the weapon skill, strength giving it a magnifying effect.  I, as a <br/>\n&gt; dwarf, poured my points into my starting agility of 70 and now have 90 of it, <br/>\n&gt; same as my dex.  The only downside of a dwarf is the horrible int of 60 and <br/>\n&gt; the even worse charisma of 55!  I once got stunk by a skunk and had it down <br/>\n&gt; to 15! Heheh<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tBut the skill-maxing is really not a problem for me.  I heard that <br/>\n&gt; dwarves get a higher XP penalty than high elves but I&#39;m not sure. If true, <br/>\n&gt; that gives you plenty of time to max everything =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tAs for weapons, I use one handed slashing.  I know that a two hander <br/>\n&gt; is better for dmg but I figure the lower delay time (26 thanks to the dwarven <br/>\n&gt; axe) and bash dmg gets me almost equal to a 2H.  Only reason I don&#39;t like 2H <br/>\n&gt; is because you are trying to do a lot of dmg at once, and if you miss once <br/>\n&gt; you miss for it all.  With a bunch of small attacks you may miss half the <br/>\n&gt; time but you&#39;ll still hit your opponent.  Again the higher dmg for the 2H <br/>\n&gt; solves this.  The only time I would use a 2H is against a monster with a fire <br/>\n&gt; shield of some sort.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tI have also started to train up my 1H blunt so that I&#39;ll be able to <br/>\n&gt; use the rank 2 summoned weapon.  Anyone have any tips for raising this stupid <br/>\n&gt; skill?  I&#39;m too low to actually fight anything blue+.  Thanks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tWell, I love playing a dwarf because if I am grumpy in real life I <br/>\n&gt; can be grumpy in the game under the pretense of role-playing! And it sure is <br/>\n&gt; fun to group with those high elf women and tell them they would be very <br/>\n&gt; pretty if they had beards =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
