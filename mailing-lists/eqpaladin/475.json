I never<br/>\nescape a battle unscathed, so I&#39;m not sure the agility is helping or not - I<br/>\ntook that one on faith. The 75 int. helps a lot in learning new skills quickly<br/>\n- as an example, when I am grouped with someone and doing &quot;language lessons&quot;<br/>\nwhere we speak to each other in our native language to teach the other party<br/>\nmember that language ( I was learning Halfling, the Halfling was learning<br/>\nDwarven), I saw the &quot;your language skills have improved&quot; message every 2<br/>\nscreens of scrolling text.  Another example is &quot;you have gotten better at bash&quot;<br/>\nwhich I get every 8th bash or so until I am topped out for my level.  The<br/>\nleftover points in Wisdom offer the direct benefit of more mana, but as I<br/>\nadvance in levels I have noticed that the amount of mana I have becomes less of<br/>\nan issue as my spells become more potent and my mana increases naturally.  And<br/>\nfinally Dexterity - I miss so often swinging that 1h minotaur axe I wonder if I<br/>\npicked up a cursed one!  It seems like I miss about 4-6 out of 10 swings on<br/>\naverage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 100 strength we get is more than adequate for us Paladins, so I left that<br/>\nalone.  The 55 charisma was so pathetic I didn&#39;t think that sinking all my 20<br/>\npoints into it would be worthwhile, and so far I&#39;ve been happy enough with the<br/>\nprices I get at the Human NPC vendors - this took some work in building up my<br/>\nfaction with those merchants, but I wanted to kill the faction-raising gnolls<br/>\nof BlackBurrow anyways! I also picked up a medal of merit that raises my CHA to<br/>\n60, and there are other charisma-raising items in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, I&#39;ve had a great time wandering the plains of the karanas, visiting<br/>\nthose friendly folks in Rivervale, chopping ankles in BlackBurrow.  Sometimes I<br/>\nwonder if I made the &quot;best&quot; ability point distribution, but to be honest I&#39;m<br/>\nusually having so much fun that I don&#39;t care!  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s even possible<br/>\nto hamstring yourself with a poor point distribution, so just do your best and<br/>\nget to adventuring!<br/>\n<br/>\nYour brother in arms,<br/>\nKaladin, 11th level Paladin (and possibly the ugliest dwarf in existence...?)<br/>\n<br/>\nTim West wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Tim West&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:twest@...\">twest@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; High charisma comes in handy after you get to that KOS (Kill On Sight)<br/>\n&gt; status with the militia.  It is a lot easier to get factions back up with a<br/>\n&gt; high charisma.  My wisdom is only 65, but I have not had a hard time with<br/>\n&gt; any of my spells.  My dodge skill works really well because of my base<br/>\n&gt; skills that I recieved as a Half-Elf.  The important thing is just to go<br/>\n&gt; out and have fun.  I just read a review in PC Accelerator magazine for<br/>\n&gt; Everquest and they are so addicted that they have renamed the game in their<br/>\n&gt; office to Eversmack.  I just love the response that I get when I heal<br/>\n&gt; someone when they are shouting for a cleric to help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tanaman - &lt;Aradani&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n         Gary Long, Vice President, Valley Internet Services<br/>\n         ...Web Commerce is what we do, all day every day...<br/>\nPh:(916)498-1920 Fax:(916)498-1932  1611 S St #202 Sacramento,CA 95814<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.valley-internet.com\">http://www.valley-internet.com</a> -  For all your business hosting needs.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.securetrans.com\">http://www.securetrans.com</a> -  Accept credit cards online in real-time!<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
