I guess it seemed logical to me to balance my evil character<br/>\nwith a good one.  Just to let everyone know I do nice things with my<br/>\nnecromancer sometimes too.  Last night I was in the Qeynos catacombs<br/>\ninvisible and came across a naked guy lost in the catacombs.  I assumed<br/>\nhe had died and asked if this was so.  He just didn&#39;t have any stuff yet<br/>\nso I gave him some cloth armor and 5gp to get him started.  Random acts<br/>\nof kindness have helped me at various times.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I have always liked the idea of playing a holy knight and<br/>\npaladins get some great combat skills/strengths.  Something to remember<br/>\nthough is the game is balanced pretty well, so try out some other<br/>\ncombinations.  I have:<br/>\n<br/>\na level 12 barbarian warrior - tank 360hps<br/>\na level 10 dark elf necromancer - fun for soloing<br/>\na level 6 high elf enchanter - created for jewelcraft<br/>\na level 5 dwarven cleric - fun to help people and dwarves are tough<br/>\nfighters too<br/>\na level 5 wood elf ranger - tracking is really really neat<br/>\nand of course my level 4 human paladin - the good guy fighter, fun to<br/>\nhelp with lay hands<br/>\n<br/>\nhave fun!<br/>\nshawn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kevin Runde [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:krunde@...\">krunde@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, May 09, 1999 12:01 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqpaladin] Why did you choose to play a paladin?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Kevin Runde &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:krunde@...\">krunde@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy? Why not?<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst there are the game advantages to Paladins:<br/>\nPaladins are great fighters. Paladins get healing spells. Awesome<br/>\nspecial<br/>\nability (Lay Hands). Finally, Verant claims we will get the best magical<br/>\nweapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the role-playing advantages:<br/>\nPaladins are trusted me more people. You get to play the hero, saving<br/>\npeople<br/>\nand dying for a good cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I don&#39;t like it that it takes me longer to gain a level.<br/>\nBUT<br/>\nsince people like and trust me as a paladin I find it easier to group<br/>\nand<br/>\nthus I have actually gained levels faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nHort, Dwarven Paladin, Bertoxxulous Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hail all!!!!!
