But it<br/>\nseems from some recent discussions (mostly about ghoulsbane) that there is<br/>\nonly ONE of each holy sword per server. Is that right?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it would cut down on the camping for them, like with dervish rings<br/>\nand other now common magical items, as well as encourage many a young<br/>\npaladin to an untimely death!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is the case, I really dont think it is a good idea. The whole idea<br/>\nof a Paladin (for me) is to fight with holy arms against evil. I suppose it<br/>\nwould be okay if there is some generic Holy weapon that ALL paladins can<br/>\nget, with just some Unique ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really would encourage me to restart my Paladin on the very next server<br/>\nthat opens if this is the case!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
