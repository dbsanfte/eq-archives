The inforamtion below should help a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not know for sure if other Paladin Guilds have similar quests, but I for<br/>\none think they should.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those Paladins who are above level 8 and want to start the Test of Truth<br/>\nyou can ask a lower level Paladin to get you the starting note, or (and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t really support this) I am told you can jump in on the quest by giving<br/>\nAltunic Jartin a Medium Cloth Tunic.  Altunic is located in East Commonlands,<br/>\nand he is the one you normally give the note to.  Doing this will skip a few<br/>\nsteps, and get you the first token, but I don&#39;t consider it very Honorable.<br/>\nHowever, if this is your only option because you found out about the quest<br/>\nlate, and can&#39;t find a lower level Paladin in Freeport to help, than I still<br/>\nbelieve it is every Paladin&#39;s right to TRY the Test of Truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust make sure when you give Altunic the note, or if you just give him the<br/>\nTunic that he is in his house.  It makes the quest much easier (you don&#39;t run<br/>\nthe risk of someone else killing the squire first).  Altunic returns to his<br/>\nhouse near the zone to West Freeport about every 15 minutes, and stays there<br/>\nfor around 5 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n     -Sir Vawhn, Knight of Truth, Silver<br/>\n             Cazic-Thule server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
