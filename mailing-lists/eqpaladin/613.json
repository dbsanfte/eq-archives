The druid casts superior camo on the lower levels, they<br/>\nget to the room, keep the under-21 crown in safe &#39;corner&#39;.  I don&#39;t think<br/>\nthe wizard would be very useful, but the cleric can heal.  The nukers take<br/>\ncare of business letting the pet tank (since it will be over 10 levels<br/>\ntougher than the paladin).  The paladin can try and bash, but in reality<br/>\nhe&#39;ll just sit in a corner until his nuker-friends hand him his Ghoulbane.<br/>\nFrom what I read on these lists, that&#39;s very paladin-like.  [Along with: OK,<br/>\nI&#39;ll try killing off a fellow paladin to see if I can get better faction<br/>\nwith the corrupt militia, my paladins love me so much it should be ok].<br/>\n<br/>\nAlloca<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is kind of awkward but I think you would have problems with low level<br/>\nmobs jumping you and the other people below low levels. I guess it&#39;s<br/>\npossiblestill it&#39;s not very feasible and a level 17 with a Ghoulsbane is a<br/>\nbit early. I&#39;d wait at least 8 more levels before you attempt this because<br/>\nyour current group is going to have some problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nKananek<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Gary Long &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:glong@...\">glong@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, September 22, 1999 12:20 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqpaladin] taking the ghoulbane plunge<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Gary Long &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:glong@...\">glong@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Here&#39;s a question for those who have retrieved the Ghoulbane holy sword:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My Paladin is 17th level, and one of the recent posts suggested that I<br/>\n&gt;should be using a Shiny Brass Halberd as my primary weapon at this<br/>\n&gt;point. I&#39;m thinking that Ghoulbane would make a better primary weapon,<br/>\n&gt;since all that&#39;s required is to head into Froglock central and wipe out<br/>\n&gt;a fellow Froggie Paladin. I have a 35th level Magician and 35th level<br/>\n&gt;Druid who could help in this quest, as well as a 20th level Wizard and a<br/>\n&gt;19th level Cleric. Would my party of 5 stand a chance?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;Kaladin, 17th level Paladin of Tunare </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
