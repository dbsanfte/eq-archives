And I&#39;ll tell you, it&#39;s a lot of<br/>\nfun to fight with every shot going off while around me<br/>\ndual wielding warriors and rangers, and other<br/>\npaladins, are hitting with their offhands, or kicking<br/>\nor bashing, for INVULNERABLE results.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more level and I get Double Attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the summone 1hb, if it&#39;s all you have, sure. <br/>\nIf you have kept 1hb capped (I haven&#39;t, it&#39;s around 25<br/>\nor so).
