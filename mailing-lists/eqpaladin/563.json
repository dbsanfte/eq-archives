If he hasn&#39;t spawned by about 8:00 I find something<br/>\n&gt; else to do until the next morning.  I&#39;ve gotten four blankets from him of<br/>\n&gt; which 3 were before the solution was posted for the world to see.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Avron &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:avron@...\">avron@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [eqpaladin] Zimel&#39;s Blades<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 16 Jul 1999 16:25:00 +0200<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Avron &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:avron@...\">avron@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am in the part of the quest where I am supposed to meet Tykar Renlin<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in the Seafarers Roost inn, but I have searched it thouroughly and he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was not there, does he only come at a certain time or do I need to do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;something to make him come?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Also my faction with the innkeepers is so that I cannot trade with them,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am KOS by freeport militia aswell, and this has REALLY made the quest<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hard to do, I don&#39;t even want to think about how I am supposed to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt;into the dungeon and meet Zimel hehe.
