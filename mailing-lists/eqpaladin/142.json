According to what I heard they barely made it out <br/>\nalive, they had to escape via group teleport.  Let us know how your attempt <br/>\ngoes, I&#39;m very curious.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as secret entrances in Freeport goes, I do know they exist, they lead <br/>\nto a sewer system.  I would just hug the outside wall until you stumble into <br/>\nit.  A lot of evil players use these to reach the docks, and I do know part <br/>\nof them go by the Cleric&#39;s and Paladin&#39;s guild.  BTW there is also a secret <br/>\nentrance to the city in Qeynos too.  The one I found was to the left of the <br/>\ngates, before you enter the city.  Be carefull though, lower levels may be <br/>\nattacked by creatures fairly often.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;On a note about<br/>\n&gt;Ghoulsbane, the crew I&#39;m with will be attempting to get a few of those<br/>\n&gt;this weekend.  One thing I know for sure, don&#39;t try it if your under<br/>\n&gt;20th level.  The rumor is the FroggerKing is close to level 30.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;4. I remember seeing a message regarding a back entrance to North<br/>\n&gt;Freeport.   I am curious if anyone has better details of this.  I plan<br/>\n&gt;on rampaging those evil guards this weekend (very holy-type evil grin).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In the service of Brell,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anguss of Cazic_Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Tired of empty chat rooms and out of date bulletin boards?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;ONElist: Making the Internet Intimate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
