I have all of these that I am able to cast at<br/>\nthis time.  However, are there spells that we can pick up from other<br/>\ntowns/shops etc. that we can cast also?  Or are we limited to what we can<br/>\npurchase from the Guild?  I went over to the necromancer&#39;s guild and looked<br/>\nthrough all of the spells that they were selling and most of them said that<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t use the spell.  Just curious about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrod<br/>\n11th Level Paladin<br/>\nInnoruuk Server<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nTired of empty chat rooms and out of date bulletin boards?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a> <br/>\nONElist: Making the Internet Intimate</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
