The name is Tiresias,<br/>\nand right now he&#39;s a level 14 Paladin on the Povar server.  You know...<br/>\nPovar... You never heard of Povar?! =)  He serves Erollisi Marr 24/7.  I<br/>\nusually hangs around Freeport area... the commonlands, Desert of Ro, and<br/>\nBefallen, smiting evil and whatnot.  In any case...<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if anyone did the quest to look for the last Guard Xyrin in<br/>\nthe quest that starts in the Temple of Marr.  Is that a beginner&#39;s quest or<br/>\nwhat?  Because I got as far as the isle in the Ocean of Tears talking to all<br/>\nthe Holy Woman O&#39; Fun and I hear a scream come out of nowhere yearning for<br/>\nhelp, but I can&#39;t find where it&#39;s coming from!  The nearest islands have<br/>\ngoblins I&#39;m not sure I want to mess with... anybody do this one yet?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Tiresias<br/>\nServant of Erollsi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
