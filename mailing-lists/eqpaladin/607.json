I should have switched to 2H slashing long before<br/>\nthen), shiny brass halberd (until 25th), blackened iron bastard sword<br/>\n(current)<br/>\n<br/>\nArmor:  All I can say is get banded as soon as you can and make due with<br/>\nleather/patchwork until then.  Since you are human, bronze plate will be<br/>\nrelatively expensive, but the weight shouldn&#39;t be too much of a problem.<br/>\nThe barbed arm plates and barbed leggings found in Befallen are quite nice.<br/>\nAs is the thick leather apron in Unrest.<br/>\n<br/>\nHunting Grounds:  Greater Faydark, near Felwithe (until 6th), Orc Camps near<br/>\nKelethin (until 10th or so), Crushbone (until 14th), Befallen and W/E<br/>\nCommonlands (until 16th), Unrest (17th through 27th, with breaks to go<br/>\ntraveling to various places in Antonica to explore)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps somewhat.
