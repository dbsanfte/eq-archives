I had been shooting blue items with my Bow<br/>\n&gt; all day long and had not been able to raise the skill.  So I had decided<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; put more practices into it even though it is expensive.  And the trainer<br/>\n&gt; said I had reached my skill limit or some such wording and could not offer<br/>\n&gt; me any further training in that skill.  My skill level is only Good, which<br/>\n&gt; is about what? 75 or so?  Is this my limit for all time?  Or does this go<br/>\n&gt; up<br/>\n&gt; in the future?  This is frustrating, cause I still miss quite a bit.  Any<br/>\n&gt; feedback would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Grod<br/>\n&gt; Newly 24th Level Paladin<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
