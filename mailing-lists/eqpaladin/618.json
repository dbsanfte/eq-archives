The blackened iron<br/>\nbastard sword is an outstanding weapon.  I could easily see myself using it<br/>\nfor a great many levels to come.  Prior to that (from 21st to 25th level) I<br/>\nused the shiny brass halberd because the -8 agility caused by the bone<br/>\nbladed claymore really did seem to make a big difference to my staying power<br/>\nin a fight.  I did become fatigued much more quickly when wielding the<br/>\nhalberd, but I would rather be tired and alive than clumsy and dead ; )<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace favor your sword,<br/>\n<br/>\nJarad Argentedge<br/>\n27th level Paladin of Tunare<br/>\nBlue Rose Order<br/>\nPovar<br/>\n<br/>\n*********************************************************************<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tFrom: &quot;Paul Duquette&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PDuquette@...\">PDuquette@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMy BIBS has served me extremely well since 20th lvl.
