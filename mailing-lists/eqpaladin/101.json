You should always check your NPCs<br/>\nto see what they sell.  Make sure you check their whole inventory as milk<br/>\noften doesn&#39;t show up at the top of the list.  Muffins tend to go for 6 cp<br/>\nand milk tends to go for 5/6 cp.  Your best bet is usually a baker or a<br/>\ngeneral merchant.  For example, in Freeport, I buy muffins from Rashinda in<br/>\nthe Land Holder&#39;s Office and milk in the Merchant&#39;s Square from the guy in<br/>\nthe big blue building.  My wife tells me that both of these items are also<br/>\nreadily available in Kelethin and Felwithe, if you happen to be on Fadwyar.<br/>\n I&#39;ve also seen several people selling muffins in High Hold, as well as<br/>\nother places.  As water flasks typically sell for 1 sp, 1 cp and rations<br/>\nfor multiple silver, you can see how buying milk and muffins can easily<br/>\nsave you money in the long run.<br/>\n<br/>\nLorimi<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
