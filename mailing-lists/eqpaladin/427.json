I just put 14<br/>\npractices into it and have been practicing it for a couple of days.  I have<br/>\nit to like 35th level....hehe.  Very slow going.  There are some good web<br/>\npages on archery that I will put at the bottom of this email.  You are<br/>\ncorrect, at this time we cannot utilize the tiny dagger or the pine needle<br/>\nto practice the skill.  However, it has been rumored we may get this ability<br/>\nin a future patch, but this is only a rumor.  I am going to keep at it and<br/>\ndevelop it along with my other skills because I find that all of them come<br/>\nin handy at one time or another.  It is just going to take quite a few<br/>\narrows.  I heard that a high level magician can summon arrows as well if you<br/>\nhave any magician friends who will do that for you.  Best of luck training<br/>\nyour new skill!

I purchased a tiny<br/>\ndagger from a friendly enchanter, but found that I can&#39;t equip it.  My next<br/>\nthought is to either purchase a lot of arrows (100) and use the bow as much<br/>\nas<br/>\npossible or to &quot;jump start&quot; the archery skill by putting 5 more training<br/>\npoints<br/>\ninto it.  Any feedback or opinions?<br/>\n<br/>\nKaladin, the &#39;range 50&#39; Paladin<br/>\n--<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n         Gary Long, Vice President, Valley Internet Services<br/>\n         ...Web Commerce is what we do, all day every day...<br/>\nPh:(916)498-1920 Fax:(916)498-1932  1611 S St #202 Sacramento,CA 95814<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.valley-internet.com\">http://www.valley-internet.com</a> -  For all your business hosting needs.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.securetrans.com\">http://www.securetrans.com</a> -  Accept credit cards online in real-time!<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nHow has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nShare your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
