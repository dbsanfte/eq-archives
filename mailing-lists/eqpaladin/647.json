I hunted the netmasters for a long time and<br/>\nwhen I had the 2 nets I tryed to turn them in to David in the paladin camp.<br/>\nI first wanted to do it in wolf form because of the faction but I was<br/>\ndubviosly to them that way. Since i am a HIE i am indif to them and so I<br/>\ntryed it that way. Needless to say that it didnt work and I lost them both<br/>\n(grrr).<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks like I have to raise my faction with them. Anyone knows a way to do<br/>\nso? I know of the pearl of odus quest, but the problem with it is that my<br/>\nfaction is too low to start the quest and so it doesnt work (I trzed it to<br/>\nbe sure).<br/>\n<br/>\nI also tryed to kill the NPC swimmers (circle of unseen hand) there as<br/>\nsuggested elsewhere, but they dont raise faction with the knights.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if somebody can tell me a way to raise a HIE faction with them, i would<br/>\nbe very thankfull.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinrod<br/>\nSolusek Ro Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
