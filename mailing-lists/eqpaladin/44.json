I&#39;m a half-elf based out of Freeport, so its not too hard for me to<br/>\ncome over to Kaladim.  However, if I&#39;m there, I would like to be able to<br/>\ntrain if I have to.  I was over there when I was level 8 or so, and the<br/>\ndwarf I talked to told me he would have nothing to do with me.  If<br/>\nthere&#39;s another guilmaster that I missed, please let me know. If anyone<br/>\never wants to go out adventuring, I play on the Karana server and can be<br/>\ncurrently found in Riverval. Farewell<br/>\n<br/>\nValandil</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
