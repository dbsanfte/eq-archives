Plus, you could loose your corpse easily, and not be<br/>\nable to have it back before it disappears. I remember it happened to me at<br/>\nlvl 3 and I lost my guild tunic. I can imagine if I had a dwarven battle axe<br/>\nat that time. Well, I was a real newby at that time, and I went to Lesser<br/>\nFaydark.
