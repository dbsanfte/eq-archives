Unfortunately, every time I log into this group, there <br/>\nisn&#39;t much going on, other than people trying to get you to go to an <br/>\nEQ commercial site...  No real discussion going on either :(   For <br/>\nanyone that&#39;s interested, I&#39;ve put up a site for EQ, my MAIN (47 <br/>\nPaladin), and Paladins...  It&#39;s called, &quot;The Paladin&#39;s Club&quot;, and <br/>\nit&#39;s not for the shy of heart (some background pics are a bit racey, <br/>\nbut they&#39;re all from famous artists lol)  All Pallies are invited, <br/>\nthere&#39;s a message board there, that does NOT require membership, <br/>\nwhich we can use to discuss stuff.  also compiling all the quest info <br/>\nfor pallies there.  Don&#39;t have much reaady yet on the quests, but I <br/>\nDO have the Ghoulbane part up :)  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.members.cox.net/karmana\">http://www.members.cox.net/karmana</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAeileron SilverLeaf, Holy Warrior of Tunare<br/>\nPovar- Steeldragons</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
