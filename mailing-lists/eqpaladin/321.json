I just obtained 15th<br/>\nlevel and the Hammer of Wrath spell.  Now when i summon this thing and then<br/>\nhave it in my possesion I can right click it and it says that it is a MAGIC<br/>\nITEM, but I went to Befallen last night and when I tried to hit an Ice Boned<br/>\nSkeleton with it, it said that the skele was invulnerable!  I thought that I<br/>\nwould be able to hit creatures that were only susceptible to magic attack<br/>\nwith this hammer, you know, things like Willow Wisps and the such?  Does<br/>\nanyone know what the deal is with this?<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nJoin a new list today!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
