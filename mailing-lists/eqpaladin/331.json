It&#39;s really IMHO the safest place in CB because of the amount of<br/>\npeople camping there trying to get the shield.  Their is (from what I hear)<br/>\na 1 in 7 chance of getting the shield. it&#39;s almost worth buying it with the<br/>\namount of time you need to spend getting it... I was lucky I only had to<br/>\nspend about 30min on that hill, there was a good group of people on the hill<br/>\nthat night and there was a &quot;looting rotation&quot; in effect i.e. no kill<br/>\nstealers, my turn came up I killed the trainer and got a rusty battle ax,<br/>\nrawhide tunic, and the shield which I use rather then selling, I was the<br/>\nfirst person there all night who got a shield :) <br/>\n<br/>\n--</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
