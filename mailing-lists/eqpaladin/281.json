It is an icon with a <br/>\npicture of a knight on it. When I inspect it it says KNIGHT and that all classes can have it and it weights 2.0. It doesn&#39;t <br/>\nsay that it is a lore item and it doesn&#39;t fit in any of my body inventory slots. Anyone have any idea as to what it is? I do <br/>\nnot remember anyone giving it to me. I have just finished taking out Byle Bundin but I don&#39;t remember having received <br/>\nthe knight when I completed this quest. I got a whole 8 silvers, oh boy. Thanks for any help.<br/>\n\u000e<br/>\n--Bruceson, 12 lvl Dwarven Paladin, Tunare server<br/>\n<br/>\nDan Kassiday<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kassiday@...\">kassiday@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clark.net/pub/kassiday\">http://www.clark.net/pub/kassiday</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
