For <br/>\ninstance, you start the soulfire quest and over the course of your life (ie. <br/>\ntill level 50) you find other bits and pieces until you finally are powerfull <br/>\nenough to get Soulfire sword. <br/>\n<br/>\nI personally think that this whole Guk discussion is a mot point. He has a <br/>\nreally powerful sword. You don&#39;t. You want the sword? Kill him and get it. <br/>\n<br/>\nOR:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can do a huge quest (See: Soulfire) waste hours of your life learning the <br/>\nFroglok tongue, hundreds of platinum on expenses, and even more time figuring <br/>\nout and doing the Quest and then FINALLY getting the sword.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless you RP 24/7, just kill the damn NPC and get the sword!
