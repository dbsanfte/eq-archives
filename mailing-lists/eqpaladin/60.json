I once saw a screenshot of Aradune wearing full <br/>\n*green plate and the 2 handed Fiery Avenger. Is that an only paladin <br/>\n*weapon, because I heard that when they tested it in the Beta, many <br/>\n*classes could use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAye, up til that final battle of Mithaniel Marr and Innoruuk at the end of<br/>\nPhase4, I had always heard that the Fiery Avenger was a Paladin-only weapon,<br/>\nand that Aradune had one even as a Ranger simply because he is Aradune.<br/>\nAfter Mithaniel fell, several screenshots substantiate that the Fiery<br/>\nAvenger could be used by any class.  What is unclear to me and to most<br/>\neveryone I know is whether or not that Fiery Avenger being able to be used<br/>\nby anyone was a special one just for that battle? Or if that was the rule<br/>\nfor all swords of that type.   <br/>\n<br/>\n-- Amoroth</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
