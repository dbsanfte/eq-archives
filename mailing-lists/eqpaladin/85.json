I&#39;ve yet to find<br/>\na truly comprehensive Quest listing...any suggestions? Various topics here,<br/>\nso if you find any you want to discuss... go for it. :)  (You might want to<br/>\nonly quote parts you wish to respond to - proper netiquette and all)<br/>\n<br/>\nHotkeys:<br/>\nThey appear to be underused by some players. I have three &quot;major&quot; ones, a<br/>\nHelp U?, a Help!, and a Danger!. Respectively, I offer aid, ask for<br/>\nassistance, and alert people of trouble (like a nearby Griff or Giant -<br/>\nthey plague my homeland). You can create these buttons at your leisure, and<br/>\nphrase them in your best roleplayese. People that run into killstealers<br/>\noften can program a suitably snarky phrase... Such hotkeys help immensely,<br/>\nsince you can pop out applicable phrases at a moment&#39;s notice. You can help<br/>\nout others - and maybe even save your own life... (If you don&#39;t, well, some<br/>\npeople like the /loc as a button for corpse location...). Other options - a<br/>\nBattlecry and an Insult to use while Taunting - just for the fun of it. And<br/>\nthat&#39;s why we&#39;re all playing EQ, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: Freeport search for holy sword<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried a lot of variations on asking Rashinda for information - no luck<br/>\nso far. Anyone have a tried-and-true phrase for learning more?<br/>\n<br/>\nOther quests in Freeport:<br/>\nI&#39;ve gotten two from the Marr Clerics (Piranha and the Potion, and the<br/>\nduplicate Helm quest - but with a spellcasting as a bonus!), Paladin quests<br/>\nfor the Reef Shark skins, Militia helm, and the Message - but not the Token<br/>\nquest (by the time I got the phrasing right, I was apparently too<br/>\nadvanced). In addition, I have the Deathfist quest from the Steel Warriors,<br/>\nand will try to get the one from the finger-wigglers for those cantrips as<br/>\nwell (if I ever remember to!)<br/>\n<br/>\nQuests in RiverVale:<br/>\nGoblin/Warbead from the Sheriff, Piranha from the Merchie, the Scarecrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote in travelling Kithicor Forest:<br/>\nI&#39;ve never run into anything scary by staying on the path...stay to the<br/>\nright coming from the West Commons, left coming from the hobbithole. (Is<br/>\nthere a quest for the Shalrok Orcs?) <br/>\n<br/>\nNote on Runnyeye Citadel:<br/>\nStick to the right side from Misty Thicket, left coming from the Maze/Gorge.<br/>\n<br/>\nTravelling East and West Commons:<br/>\nStay on the South Mountain range, high up, if you don&#39;t want to interact<br/>\nwith the critters. For those of you not from the area, the dungeon entrance<br/>\nto Befallen (stuffed with evil Undead types that offend my Paladin senses)<br/>\nis in West Commons...and there&#39;s a nasty Dark Elf NPC named Kizdean Gix who<br/>\nhangs out by the eastern Inn (east side, usually) that attacks our kind on<br/>\nsight... East Commons has a tunnel passage to the North Ro desert on the<br/>\nsouth mountainside; the north range has an entrance to the Nektulos Forest<br/>\n(you might not want to attract the attention of the Guards there if you<br/>\naren&#39;t looking for a fight).<br/>\n<br/>\nSquire Narls:<br/>\nI can&#39;t say he poses too much of a threat above L10; I&#39;ve seen weaker<br/>\nfellows than me lop him. Typically the adventurers in EC cheer when you<br/>\nkill him, since he spams the whole zone while shouting for Altunic. Which<br/>\nquest is he part of?<br/>\n <br/>\nCombat Skills:<br/>\nI&#39;ve gone 1H Slashing and Shield, because this way I can use the secondary<br/>\ncombat skill (Bashing). Two handed weapons precludes use of that skill, and<br/>\nsince Paladins aren&#39;t loaded up with Kick (as a secondary attack)or Dual<br/>\nWield (a separate weapon in other hand), I think this is a good way to go.<br/>\nComments? (Once I get the Hammer of Wrath, I suspect I&#39;ll play with that<br/>\n(1H Blunt) for use in emergency situations). Although we do get Parry and<br/>\nRisposte, the only real decsion is one or two handed, slashing or blunt,<br/>\nand I hate to see the shield Bash be unused. (However, as far as unused<br/>\nskills go, Bind Wounds is essentially useless for Paladins - why pay all<br/>\nthat money for bandages when you can med and heal instead? Mages should<br/>\nbind wounds, since they get the &quot;free&quot; summoned bandages!). Shields do give<br/>\nan extra armor boot, too...<br/>\n<br/>\nFast Weapons versus Slow Weapons:<br/>\nMinotaur Axe, or Combine Scimitar? Over the same period of time, these<br/>\ncause very close to the same maximum damage... but Mino Axes are easier to<br/>\ncome by (haven&#39;t gotten ahold of Dwarven Axe yet). The CScimitar is<br/>\nmagickal (especially useful against those Invulnerable undead types) and<br/>\nhits more often (highly useful against spellcasters; with it and Bash it<br/>\nmakes it easier to disrupt potentially painful spells). Mino Axes have more<br/>\nimpressive single strikes; only useful if an opponent&#39;s armor can<br/>\ncompletely absorb lesser blows (as I&#39;ve heard people say). However, I&#39;ve<br/>\nyet to see any such thing... Combine Long Sword does a tiny bit more damage<br/>\nthan Combine Scimitar in the long run (1%), but the extra speed also helps<br/>\nin situations such as when an enemy disengages (just to come back and swipe<br/>\nat you when your back is turned).<br/>\n<br/>\nTrade Skills:<br/>\nAnyone played much with these? I Tailored at low level to make up my own<br/>\nset of Patchwork armor, but I&#39;m beyond that now (replacing Leather with<br/>\nbetter at the moment). Wouldn&#39;t dream of Begging. Can&#39;t see going into<br/>\nlearning to create Studded, etc Leather when Pals can wear metal stuff.<br/>\nJewelry isn&#39;t too worthwhile unless you have an Enchanter buddy, I&#39;m happy<br/>\neating muffins (6 cp) and milk (5 cp) (mmmMMMmm...muffins....armmfumfumf)<br/>\nso I don&#39;t feel I need Baking (unless they have a poofy hat and apron with<br/>\na stupid saying on it for roleplaying purposes), and I can&#39;t picture myself<br/>\nas a Paladin playing in the mud for Pottery (&quot;You broke my teacup, evil<br/>\none! Now you must die!&quot;). Fletching is useless to a profession that spurns<br/>\nthe bow, drunken Paladins (or those selling the stuff to locals) might give<br/>\nus all a bad name, so we&#39;re left with Smithing. Useful, but is that our<br/>\nonly &quot;logical&quot; choice? I have skill points saved up, but I&#39;m not convinced<br/>\nwhere to spend them yet. I Fish when able to in the lakes and oceans. Am I<br/>\nlimited to Piscatorial Pursuits as a noble Paladin? (Although I rather do<br/>\nenjoy fishing, relaxing between bouts of zombie-bashing).<br/>\n<br/>\nContainers:<br/>\nBackpacks hold more, but Large Bags weigh considerably less and hold quite<br/>\na bit as well. This is useful if you have a tendency to become encumbered<br/>\nby all those rusty weapons out there...you can have the same carrying<br/>\ncapacity with 4 LBags as with 3 Backpacks, but you&#39;re not carrying as much<br/>\nstarting weight... I also keep containers in the bank to stash whatever I<br/>\nfeel has some value, but not as deadweight while adventuring.<br/>\n<br/>\nZoning:<br/>\nVery useful for saving your life, but there are disadvantages to this<br/>\ntechnique: zone areas are usually crowded with other players doing the same<br/>\nthing. There could be a lot of competition for kills, or even killstealing<br/>\n- very annoying. In addition, people in over their heads often lead a<br/>\n&quot;Train&quot; of nasties to the zone; especially painful if the train is<br/>\nunannounced and you&#39;re already fighting or injured. In confined spaces,<br/>\nthis often spells trouble (try walking through the Ro tunnel and being<br/>\nconfronted with a ghoul train, or entering Befallen and getting stunned by<br/>\nGynok Moltor, a most unpleasant surprise).<br/>\n<br/>\nRandom acts of kindness:<br/>\nI can&#39;t help but heal an injured adventurer, epecially when I&#39;m at full<br/>\nmana and health while travelling from point to point. Naturally, a troll<br/>\nattacking an Innkeeper doesn&#39;t warrant my aid, but I like helping out the<br/>\nless advanced - especially since they&#39;re likely to be the ones I&#39;ll be<br/>\nselling my obsolete equipment to in the future. No, but really, I just do<br/>\nit for altruistic reasons... it&#39;s good karma.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvantages and disadvantages:<br/>\nWe can&#39;t create our own food and drink, or forage for it, when out on the<br/>\nroad a while. Not too many combat skills when you consider we usually end<br/>\nup tanking and filling the warrior role, especially at lower levels. No<br/>\nearth-shattering spells, pets to do our bidding, tracking, archery,<br/>\nteleportation or extraordinary movement abilities. However, we make decent<br/>\nbetween-battle healers, with respectable buffs at L 15, and can cure posion<br/>\nand those annoying diseases. Lay Hands is a great last-moment &quot;save&quot; for<br/>\nourselves or our party members. Armor options are virtually limitless, and<br/>\nsome day I expect to have one of those legendary Holy Swords.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest advantage, of course, is that Paladins lend themselves really<br/>\nwell to roleplaying - if you develop a reputation for being a trustworthy,<br/>\ncompetent Paladin who works for the good of a party, you won&#39;t ever have a<br/>\nproblem getting a group together or finding a friend to adventure with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there&#39;s always some evil out there, waiting to be vanquished...<br/>\n<br/>\nFare well!<br/>\n<br/>\nLorimi (don&#39;t worry, I doubt I&#39;ll have the time to write a post this long<br/>\nin the future...), Half-Elven Paladin of Mithaniel Marr, Cazic-Thule<br/>\nserver, Freeport</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
