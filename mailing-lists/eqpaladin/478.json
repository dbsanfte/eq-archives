It would be nice to have the combine longsword or some<br/>\nother decent magical weapon, but I&#39;m still about 50 platinum short, what with<br/>\nhaving to buy armor, arrows, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe staff is nice - dmg 8, delay 40? - and my skill is going steadily up in 2H<br/>\nblunt.  The summoned dagger is decent as well (dmg 4, delay 21?) but doesn&#39;t do<br/>\nnearly enough damage when hunting wisps or scarecrows. I&#39;m also working on<br/>\npushing 1H blunt up for when I can summon the mace in four levels.  If I<br/>\n*really* want to, I could go punish bandits with a wizard friend in the karanas<br/>\nand have that combine longsword in a week.  The thing is, I don&#39;t usually hunt<br/>\nfor creatures hit by magic only because there&#39;s so many critters running round<br/>\nthat don&#39;t have that limitation!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here&#39;s a question for you higher-level paladins (16th and over) - at what<br/>\nlevel does it become necessary to have a magic weapon, and can the situations<br/>\nthat require a magic weapon be handled by our summoned mace?<br/>\n<br/>\nKaladin, the curious 11th level Paladin<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n         Gary Long, Vice President, Valley Internet Services<br/>\n         ...Web Commerce is what we do, all day every day...<br/>\nPh:(916)498-1920 Fax:(916)498-1932  1611 S St #202 Sacramento,CA 95814<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.valley-internet.com\">http://www.valley-internet.com</a> -  For all your business hosting needs.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.securetrans.com\">http://www.securetrans.com</a> -  Accept credit cards online in real-time!<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
