Around 20th level I purchased a pair of gold carnelian rings (+5<br/>\nagility) for 65pp and firmly believe that they have saved my life on many<br/>\noccasions.  This is especially true when being run over by a train in Unrest<br/>\nwhere that one extra miss/dodge/parry can mean the difference between life<br/>\nand a gruesome death.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also look into the possibility of upgrading your two-handed weapon.<br/>\nAlthough the 1H vs. 2H debate rages to this very day, I personally believe<br/>\nthat 2H is the way to go after 20th until/if you get Ghoulbane.  A shiny<br/>\nbrass halberd and bone bladed claymore are both well within your price range<br/>\n(~100pp on Povar).  I personally preferred the halberd because that -8<br/>\nagility hit with the claymore is brutal, but I know many of our brethren<br/>\nthat have been happy with both.  In the mid-20&#39;s it&#39;s then time to start<br/>\nlooking for a blackened iron bastard sword.  I have one and it&#39;s my pride<br/>\nand joy...<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace favor your sword,<br/>\n<br/>\nJarad Argentedge<br/>\n27th level Paladin of Tunare<br/>\nBlue Rose Order<br/>\nPovar<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\tBlizzard [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blizzard15@...\">blizzard15@...</a>]<br/>\n\tSent:\tFriday, September 24, 1999 1:27 PM<br/>\n\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_holyswords@onelist.com\">eq_holyswords@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\tSubject:\t[eqpaladin] Equipment ?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHello all, i have a question regarding equipment for a paldin.
