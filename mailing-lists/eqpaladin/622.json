As far as a good shield 1 hand slash combo, I liked the barbed leather whip with the chitin sheild (very light but no light source)worked well for me, all be it the shiny brass sheild is nice for a lightsource. I have my eyes on a 2handed Mithril sword, the haste is a nice feature.<br/>\n<br/>\nFattyBear 31st lvl<br/>\nBertoxx</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
