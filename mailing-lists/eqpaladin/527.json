","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2123277651\">About Soulfire, the quest continues.  I am working with a few groups to acquire<br/>\nthis hilt on the Cazic-Thule server.  We are still looking for Bog Juice...<br/>\nSounds disgusting to me.  I would buy Zimel a whole barrel of Elven Wine if it<br/>\nwould help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout Ghoulsbane, I still think it is a quest sword but the quest is so broken<br/>\nno one even knows where it starts.  I don&#39;t like the idea of killing another<br/>\nPaladin to get Ghoulsbane, but what else can we do?  I do not have a Holy Sword<br/>\nof any kind, but a day will come when I will have to make the decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still trying to collect information on Brilliant Sword of Faith.  It looks<br/>\nlike that quest is still broken.  What gets me is the fact that it WORKED at<br/>\none point, and then they broke it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;CybrWzrd&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CybrWzrd@...\">CybrWzrd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This newsgroup has been kind of slow lately, and I am wondering what<br/>\n&gt; everyones thoughts on geting ghoulsbane are, because you do have to kill a<br/>\n&gt; fellow paladin to get it. Also has anyone here found any other piecec of<br/>\n&gt; soulfire other than the hilt that is on the shadowknight in Mistmoore?
