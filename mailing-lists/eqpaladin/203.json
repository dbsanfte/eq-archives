A thing to think <br/>\nabout also is well-balanced weapons, I was checking them out at the shady <br/>\nswashbuckler in east commons last night and some pretty nice stats, the <br/>\ndwarven 2h axe well-balanced is 16dmg 43 delay and magical, that&#39;s only one <br/>\npoint dmg less then the bbc. Of course they do run around 200 plat or so but <br/>\nhey it is worth it. I have been trying to obtain info on Ghoulsbane from a <br/>\nlvl 30 paladin who was at guk yesterday trying to get it, he may have it by <br/>\nnow who knows will ask him.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW does anyone know stats on Shiny Brass Halberd?<br/>\n<br/>\nSha&#39;kel paladin of 13th order still..(if only I didnt die so frequently &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n(Tarrew Marr)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
