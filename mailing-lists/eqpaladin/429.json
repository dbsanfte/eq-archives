I then discovered the only places to<br/>\nget fletching supplies/arrows were at the two ranger<br/>\nguilds (Surefall Glade and Kelethin - any other arrow<br/>\nand/or fletching sources exist, speak up please!).  So<br/>\nI travelled back to my homeland (Feydwer) after<br/>\nstopping at my guild and putting 1 point each into<br/>\nArchery and Fletching before logging off Thursday.<br/>\n<br/>\nFriday evening, I went to Kelethin and bought a quiver<br/>\n(mistake, don&#39;t bother; backpack has twice the slots,<br/>\ndidn&#39;t notice any difference between the two; if there<br/>\nis one, someone fill me in), a fletching kit and<br/>\ncomponents for class 1 arrows, and started fletching. <br/>\nI worked up through the components until, 3 hours<br/>\nlater, I had taken Fletching to 56.  I was then able<br/>\nto make, on my first try, a Hickory/Hemp bow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used that bow for the next hour or two, then bought<br/>\nan Elm/Hemp from someone auctioning bows (paid 5pp, a<br/>\nfair price considering what I know about the materials<br/>\ncosts) and kept using it.  I didn&#39;t bother making<br/>\narrows after that; saving 4cp per arrow is *not* worth<br/>\nthe 6-9 minutes it takes to do 20 arrow attempts, IMO.<br/>\n I just bought the 1sp each arrows for sale at the<br/>\nfletchers&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent the time in Crushbone&#39;s Throneroom, firing<br/>\narrows at everyone else&#39;s blue+ (to me) mobs; no one<br/>\nminded because A) I&#39;m helping them kill their target<br/>\nB) There&#39;s *no* way an archer will killsteal from a<br/>\nwarrior or wizard fully engaged and C) I also<br/>\nhealed/buffed them while I was hanging around.  I had<br/>\nto run from Dvinn on occasion, but Friday night and<br/>\nSaturday I took Archery to 65.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then proceeded to fill up 80% of my bank slots, and<br/>\n3 backpacks on myself, with 1sp arrows and returned to<br/>\nthe Ro Desert.  Since then, working archery as a pull<br/>\nand chase killer, I&#39;ve brought it to 73.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Tiny Daggers people talk about won&#39;t equip for<br/>\nPaladins right now; dunno if it&#39;s supposed to be that<br/>\nway or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nFletching is a *cheap* skill to bring up; I spent<br/>\nabout 1 1/2 pp on the kit and then another 3-4pp to go<br/>\nfrom 1 to 56, so it&#39;s very cheap.  The Hickory/Hemp<br/>\nbow I made only cost about 4gp to try (first try<br/>\nsucceeded).  The Elm bows cost 2-4pp per try, but the<br/>\nnext level up (Ash) cost 20-30pp per try (all<br/>\ndepending on string type and tools used; cams are<br/>\n*expensive*, 45pp each to my low CHA dwarven paladin).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis info comes from experience and some fletching<br/>\nsites on the web.<br/>\n<br/>\nBows determine the base damage/delay/range (where<br/>\nxx/yy for weapons is damage/delay, xx/yy/zz for bows<br/>\nis damage/delay/range).  Range is more relevant than<br/>\nit might first appear because 100 range is shorter<br/>\nthan it sounds; you have to be closer than you think<br/>\nto be in range.<br/>\n<br/>\nArrows modify the base damage and range of the bow,<br/>\nadding damage and adding or subtracting range.  There<br/>\nare arrow and/or bow combinations that result in 0 or<br/>\n25 ranges, and are presumably very limited in their<br/>\nuse (perhaps in a dungeon fight, or for a dedicated<br/>\nclose range archer who won&#39;t be using melee in his<br/>\ngroup).<br/>\n<br/>\nArrow components:<br/>\n---Shafts modify damage.  Wood = +1, Bone = +2,<br/>\nCeramic = +3, Steel = +4(or +5?).<br/>\n---Points modify damage.  Field = 0, Hooked = +1,<br/>\nBladed = +2.<br/>\n---Fletches vary in their mods.  Round = no change,<br/>\nParabolic = +50 range, Shield = +1 damage, -50 range.<br/>\n---Nocks modify range.  Large = +0, Medium = +25,<br/>\nSmall = +50.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrings affect the damage/delay of the bow.  Hemp is<br/>\nthe base (bow stock plus hemp = base bow stats for<br/>\nthat bow stock).  Linen modifies base -1/-4/-.  Silk<br/>\nmodifies base -2/-8/-.  Whittling knife modifies base<br/>\n-1/-4/-, planing tool -2/-8/-.  Cams add +2(?) damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlways consider the efficiency rating of the weapon<br/>\n(damage divided by delay) and consider the range you<br/>\nwant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cheapest, longest range arrow is<br/>\nField/Wooden/Small/Parabolic 1.7sp component cost,<br/>\n1/150 (dmg/rng).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cheapest arrow possible is<br/>\nField/Wooden/Large/Round 0.4sp cost, 1/50.  Changing<br/>\nto a Medium nock makes it 0.5sp cost, 1/75.  Changing<br/>\nto a Parabolic fletch makes it 0.9sp cost, 1/100.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe highest damage arrow possible is<br/>\nBladed/Steel/Small/Shield at 1.556pp cost, 7/50.  If<br/>\nyou want some range, make it<br/>\nBladed/Steel/Small/Parabolic for 1.527pp cost, 6/150.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo some research; but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be using<br/>\narrows that cost much more than 3-4sp each until I get<br/>\ninto areas of the game that pay 15-20pp per hour of<br/>\nhunting.  I am considering starting to use the 1.7sp<br/>\n1/150 arrows though (I&#39;d have to hand fletch them, or<br/>\npay someone to do it though; which is the drawback,<br/>\nbut would give a 50% increase over the 1/100s I&#39;m<br/>\nbuying premade from Kelethin for 1sp each).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso note, be sure to check component prices in game<br/>\nbefore making massive purchases; I don&#39;t have them<br/>\nmemorized and the site I pulled the data from could<br/>\nhave things outdated/wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd BTW, I *love* my bow now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
