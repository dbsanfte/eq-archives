<div id="ygrps-yiv-167691115">Hello All<br/>
	I just purchased the ward undead spell and proceeded back to unrest<br/>
to test it out and to my dismay I wasn&#39;t barely able to cast it. *sigh* So I<br/>
went to the guilmaster and trained 10 points into and headed back out to try<br/>
it again and I was only casting once every 10 times or so. Is there another<br/>
spell we have to work this or do we just have to keep working it this way ?<br/>
