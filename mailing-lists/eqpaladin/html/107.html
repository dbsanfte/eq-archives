<div id="ygrps-yiv-949599510">One thing that I have noticed, (correct me if I am wrong), is that if I<br/>
haven&#39;t practiced at least one time with my Guildmaster on a type of spell<br/>
(abjuration for instance) my experience does not increase in that spell type<br/>
until I do.  So it may seem that you can&#39;t use a spell or that it is not<br/>
working well, but you need to practice it with the Guildmaster at least once<br/>
to kind of &quot;kick start&quot; the spell.  This is the way it has worked for me.<br/>
If anyone has any more information on practicing and spells, let me know.  I<br/>
am just about to go to level 11 and will be curious as to where to utilize<br/>
my practices.<br/>

I currently have a lvl 13 human paladin with 85 wisdom and have never had a<br/>
problem at all with casting my spells (except the ocassional fail) =).<br/>
