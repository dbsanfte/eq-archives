<br/>
Aye, when you come out of Felwithe, the high elf city, make a left on the<br/>
path and take it past the first turn off (that leads to the Lesser Faydark),<br/>
keep going, thru the big white spires (those are actually points to which<br/>
higher level wizards gate), stick to the left when the path forks, and that<br/>
should lead to a rocky tunnel-like entrance to the Butcherblok mountains.<br/>
Go thru that and you will zone into Butcherblok, which is the land outside<br/>
the Dwarven city of Kaladim.  There are 2 NPC Ogres who run about the path<br/>
in Butcherblok at times, and they are dangerous at your level; avoid them or<br/>
just run back thru the zone where you came if you see them coming.  There<br/>
are also usually large snakes, skunks, and large spiders you can fight at<br/>
5th level to gain experience near to where you zoned in, just run along<br/>
ahead a bit and hunt them out.</div>
