<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965590072">Hail all!!!!! This is a question posed to everyone who has subscribed to<br/>
this list. Why did you choose to play a paladin? No matter your reasons,<br/>
share them with us. Hopefully everyone here is mature enough not to flame<br/>
people for their reasons and what not.<br/>
