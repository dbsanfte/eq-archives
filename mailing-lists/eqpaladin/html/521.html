<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690895428">Last night I hit level 24 and was able to stop in Qeynos and go to see the<br/>
one Paladin trainer out there.  I had been shooting blue items with my Bow<br/>
all day long and had not been able to raise the skill.  So I had decided to<br/>
put more practices into it even though it is expensive.  And the trainer<br/>
said I had reached my skill limit or some such wording and could not offer<br/>
me any further training in that skill.  My skill level is only Good, which<br/>
is about what? 75 or so?  Is this my limit for all time?  Or does this go up<br/>
in the future?  This is frustrating, cause I still miss quite a bit.  Any<br/>
feedback would be appreciated.<br/>
