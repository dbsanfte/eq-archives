<div id="ygrps-yiv-319394823">I&#39;m interested in people&#39;s views on the mix of STR, AGI and DEX.  I&#39;m assuming everyone thinks stamina is irrelevant.<br/>
I have a high level high elf paladin that can&#39;t hit the side of a barn in broad daylight from a foot away.  Probable cause - poor high elven dexterity.<br/>
I started a dwarven paladin recently with STR 100, STA 95, AGI 75, DEX 105. I hit everything with ease.  I&#39;m concerned my AGI is too low - am I just going to get pummelled by everything in sight? Do people think 75 is too low, or should I set it to 80?  Are there good high level paladins out there with 75 AGI or less?<br/>
I put my DEX up to ungodly levels so that I get the weapon effect (e.g. dismiss undead) more often and also hit more often - I was getting really sick of those &quot;but miss&quot; messages.<br/>
What do people think? Having seen a difference in combat ability below L30 and above L30, I&#39;d be interested to hear from high level paladins about their attributes.<br/>
