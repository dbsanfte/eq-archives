<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871372240">So it looks like there are 2 gypsy camps mentioned below:<br/>
Oasis - along coast till you hit dock and pillar. Turn inland till lake<br/>
on your left, gypsies on your right.  Bad things - mainly Sand Giants<br/>
<br/>
N Karana - Head inland from river at the point with the &quot;spires&quot; and the<br/>
bridge.  Follow the road.  Bad things - Griffins and Hill Giants<br/>
<br/>
I know of two others not sure if they sell combine stuff or not:<br/>
Lavastorm - don&#39;t know their exact location or directions.<br/>
<br/>
Rathe Mountains - from Lake Rathe entrance, follow left wall a long<br/>
ways.  From Ferrott entrance follow right wall a little ways.  Skip the<br/>
first right which leads back to a bad flying griffin looking thing with<br/>
a long egyptian sounding name.  Ankhe....somethin.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I asked this before but has anyone noticed that the language of<br/>
the Giants is &quot;combine&quot;?  Does anyone know the connection (if any)<br/>
between Giants, gypsies, and combine weapons?<br/>

3. The gypsies that sell combines (great investment) are located in the<br/>
Oasis of Marr.  You have to zone south into the Oasis from Nro, walk<br/>
along the coast til you pass a small dock and see a largish pillar just<br/>
off the coast.  When you see the pillar turn to the west and run down<br/>
the valley.  At the end of the valley there will be a large lake to your<br/>
left and the gypsy camp to your right.  The seller to the northwest has<br/>
the combines.  A few words of warning.  Sand Giants proliferate the area<br/>
so watch yer butts and take a friend with a high charisma to make the<br/>
actual purchase.  I beleive with a 95 the cost for the longsword is<br/>
53-55 plat and a 2handed (my preference) is right around 112 plat.  You<br/>
can also get them in North Karana but that&#39;s a long run from Fawdyer and<br/>
the prices are the same.  In case your wondering where anyways, just<br/>
head north from the &quot;white&quot; bridge along the road, once again beware of<br/>
Griffins and Hill Giants.  I&#39;ve since moved on and am using a Shiny<br/>
Brass halberd (can hit for a max of 74 points a round with double attack<br/>
at my current level) but the combines are great for early teens.<br/>
