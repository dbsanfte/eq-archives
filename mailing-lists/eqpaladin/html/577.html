<div id="ygrps-yiv-710755288"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Greater Faydark is considered as city zone, so you cam bind in any place<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Greater Faydark is a city zone, because it is the zone of Kelethin.<br/>
You can be bound in HighPass too because it is a city (merchants...), and<br/>
may be in High Keep, I would not be surprised.<br/>
And I confirm about the Arena too.<br/>
