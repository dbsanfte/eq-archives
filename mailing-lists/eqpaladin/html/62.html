*I have Heard of a sword called Ghoulsbane I know it is a paladin only<br/>
*sword and im also prett sure that it is a one handed weapon.<br/>

Aye, Ghoulbane moved in Final from a 2H to a 1H sword.  I don&#39;t know about<br/>
Truthbringer, another paladin only sword; I remember seeing a Guide with it<br/>
in Phase 3, and it was a 2H sword then.  I really hope it&#39;s 2H now too!  I<br/>
am maxed on my 2H slashing skill, but I have neglected my 1H slash for far<br/>
too long.<br/>
