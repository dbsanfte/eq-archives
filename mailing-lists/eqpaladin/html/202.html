<b>Subject:</b> bash at level 8? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-785692071">Hail fellow paladins. I was lead to believe that we get bash at level 12.<br/>
Well, my half-elf paladin, Abrell, who has felt stuck at level 8 forever<br/>
went to visit his trainer out of curiosity and being bored. He saw that he<br/>
could now train in bash. I spent 1 point in it and went to BB to try it out.<br/>
Well, it works. My question is when did they change the level requirements<br/>
for bash?</div>
