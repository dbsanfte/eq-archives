<div id="ygrps-yiv-395466202">I&#39;d love it if this was true, but I doubt that your team is killing the right Froglock.  The Froglock Lord is one tough kermit - I&#39;m not planning on going there to try until I hit L30.<br/>

	Well, I found out that the actual monster that carries Ghoulbane is <br/>
only 18-20.  Not really sure, but perhaps a bunch of 15s could take em.  When <br/>
my friends (cleric, ranger, monk) went there they killed him 5 times, he <br/>
carried a sword each time and it was rusty each time.  What I figure is that <br/>
either the killer MUST be a paladin or that the group responsible for the <br/>
kill must have a paladin inside it.  I have yet to goto Guk, and frankly I <br/>
don&#39;t look forward to having to dodge the troll bashers, so I am unable to <br/>
prove or disprove my two theories. <br/>
