I am not sure how many want to read this but this is a spoiler so stop<br/>
reading if you want to figure it out on your own.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This quest is given by Lord Jekle (I am at work and don&#39;t remember the name<br/>
exactly) and he asks if you wish to assist the defenders. If you so agree he<br/>
tells you to bring him an orc oracle scroll. These scrolls are only found on<br/>
oracles that spawn in and near the orc castle in crushbone (I have never<br/>
witnessed nor heard of one spawning in the village). <br/>
<br/>
Problems:<br/>
1) These oracles in crushbone are incredibly difficult to kill and should<br/>
only be attempted at lvl 10 plus<br/>
2) Most often you will have to engage the oracle as well as several<br/>
legionnaires and many of the other castle inhabitants (Royal Guards,<br/>
Prophet, Emissary, Emperor Crush and don&#39;t forget Dvinn)...All of which are<br/>
incredibly difficult to defeat and I have only seen players defeat Dvinn<br/>
once and heard of another time but never solo.<br/>
3) The reward from this quest was roughly 12 silver and some exp (not a<br/>
noticeable gain at lvl 11)<br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
After returning the scroll and completing the quest he did say that it was<br/>
too bad I wasn&#39;t a defender. Not sure what was meant by that. All in all I<br/>
would suggest that if you get a scroll while out adventuring you made 12<br/>
silver and a little exp but I would not go out of your way to complete this<br/>
quest.<br/>

P.S. I have a character in Halas that I would like to relocate to freeport<br/>
and would appreciate any directions you could provide.</div>
