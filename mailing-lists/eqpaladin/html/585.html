&gt; There are also good magical 2h weapons like bone<br/>
&gt; bladed claymore (17/45, costs around 250pp, but i<br/>
&gt; heard you can get it in Befallen for as low as<br/>
&gt; 150pp) or blackened iron bastard sword (20/47, costs<br/>
&gt; around 500pp, maybe less in Runnyeye).<br/>

for the level, but the -8 AGI is a *huge* hit to take<br/>
for it.  BBCs are pretty cheap on Tarew Marr these<br/>
days because people are really not into that AGI hit.<br/>
<br/>
The BIBS, on the other hand, is rapidly becoming the<br/>
next PGT level farmed item.  For a while you could go<br/>
into Runnyeye and find less than ten people in the<br/>
entire zone at peak times.  These days the numbers are<br/>
up and there are a lot of killstealer casters farming<br/>
the Dazed Goblin Knight.  And when they get the BIBS<br/>
they&#39;re charging opening bids of 600pp - 700pp.  At<br/>
the trade bazaar a couple of BIBS went up and were<br/>
going for close to 1000pp.<br/>

The sword&#39;s nice, but not that nice.  Grrrrrrr.<br/>
