<div id="ygrps-yiv-943680345">Until i went with the BIBS i used a BBC for a short stint, I would hold out for the BIBS in my opinion, the -8 agility hit sucks. As far as a good shield 1 hand slash combo, I liked the barbed leather whip with the chitin sheild (very light but no light source)worked well for me, all be it the shiny brass sheild is nice for a lightsource. I have my eyes on a 2handed Mithril sword, the haste is a nice feature.<br/>
