The only one I can think of is the Tentacle Whip.  It has a damage rating of 4 and a speed of about 28.  Plus it occasionally casts Lifetap.  I bought one from someone for 20pp. I have heard comments from many people, some say it is a good price, others disagree.  Personally I find it to be a cool looking but not very effective weapon, especially compared with the mino axe or dwarven 1H axe.<br/>

Magician, and even though I appreciate the summoned fang he gives me, the puny<br/>
1-6hp dmg I do with it and the fact that it&#39;s a piercing weapon makes me feel<br/>
somewhat useless when we are hunting wisps.<br/>
