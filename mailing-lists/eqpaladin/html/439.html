<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132092298">First I want to say out loud &quot;HAIL and welcome back Val !!!&quot;. You were <br/>
really missed ! I hope you will be done with your computer problems :) Those <br/>
last weeks have been rather lonely expect for the occasional game with <br/>
Merjol when we were on together...<br/>
<br/>
Now to try and answer Vilar&#39;s questions...<br/>
Hail and welcome Vilar, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had a chance to meet you yet :) <br/>
(at least not under  this name)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;can you tell me are there cap for the combat skills of us<br/>
&gt;paladin?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aye like for every class and every (non trade) skills. Our cap for combat <br/>
skills is I think 5*lev+5.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If not, than is it true that we could fight as good as those<br/>
&gt;warriors? If there are skill cap for our combat skills, well, the combat<br/>
&gt;advantage of us would be to obtain a holy sword, am I right?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In pure melee fight, you won&#39;t be as good as a pure warrior. They will deal <br/>
more damages and tank more easily (with their kick, double attack, double <br/>
weapon, bash and all the other attacks they have). But they don&#39;t have any <br/>
spell, and those spells are of a huge help when you&#39;re resting between <br/>
fights. (and even during fights at a higher level).<br/>
As far as the holy sword is concerned, well I&#39;m lev 22 and still have to see <br/>
one :) the weakest one is I think on a lev 30 monster, and I can&#39;t wait to <br/>
get it...<br/>
Anyway one thing you have to realize is that in a fight, and at higher <br/>
levels, you won&#39;t really be here to do the damage - same for the warriors. <br/>
Fight with some wizards who will in two spells take half of this monster&#39;s <br/>
hps while you can hardly do a scratch... But teach them that if they run <br/>
away when the monster turns on them, then you can&#39;t take the monster back on <br/>
you ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have a vision, sword is what we hold on our hand, but we are not fight<br/>
&gt;with the one we are swinging, we fight with the sword in our heart and THAT<br/>
&gt;should be our holy sword................<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Amen on this, sister.<br/>
The point is to enjoy this game. Period. Personnally I do as a paladin. <br/>
There&#39;s no point in thinking this class can do this better than me, and this <br/>
other can do that better. Don&#39;t worry about that, it&#39;s pretty well balanced.<br/>
And don&#39;t worry too much about the holy swords. You can perform your good <br/>
duties througout Norath, fighting undeads and evil, even without one, and <br/>
still be good at it :)<br/>
<br/>
May Brell guide your steps in the holy way of the paladinhood.<br/>
