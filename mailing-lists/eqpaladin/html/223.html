<div id="ygrps-yiv-244862957">Here is a subject we haven&#39;t touch on and one I have been wondering about.<br/>
I am level 15 and have pretty much got a full set of banded armor.  However,<br/>
I don&#39;t have any earrings, and the rings I wear are just Dervish Cutthroat<br/>
rings which add to your dexterity.  What kind of jewelry is everyone wearing<br/>
and what magic effects do they have?  In addition, can you buy this jewelry<br/>
at the shops or do you have to kill certain characters to get it?<br/>
