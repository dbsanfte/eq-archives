&gt; on the Xegony server, it seems Greater Faydark is the only place where<br/>
&gt; people auction shiny brass shields. a friend of mine came all the way from<br/>
&gt; Qeynos when he heard they had them there. he paid 25 pp for his, but I<br/>
&gt; believe 20 is more common. that is third on my list of things to buy, a<br/>
&gt; combine sword being first. 50 pp takes awhile to save though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The reaon that they are more common in Greater Fay is because to my<br/>
knowledge the only creature that carries the shield is the Orc Trainer<br/>
in Crushbone if you enter CB and hang a right you should find the trainer<br/>
hill.  It&#39;s really IMHO the safest place in CB because of the amount of<br/>
people camping there trying to get the shield.  Their is (from what I hear)<br/>
a 1 in 7 chance of getting the shield. it&#39;s almost worth buying it with the<br/>
amount of time you need to spend getting it... I was lucky I only had to<br/>
spend about 30min on that hill, there was a good group of people on the hill<br/>
that night and there was a &quot;looting rotation&quot; in effect i.e. no kill<br/>
stealers, my turn came up I killed the trainer and got a rusty battle ax,<br/>
rawhide tunic, and the shield which I use rather then selling, I was the<br/>
first person there all night who got a shield :) <br/>
