<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470414835">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering whether or not the dwarf paladin guildmasters will train<br/>
me.  I&#39;m a half-elf based out of Freeport, so its not too hard for me to<br/>
come over to Kaladim.  However, if I&#39;m there, I would like to be able to<br/>
train if I have to.  I was over there when I was level 8 or so, and the<br/>
dwarf I talked to told me he would have nothing to do with me.  If<br/>
there&#39;s another guilmaster that I missed, please let me know. If anyone<br/>
ever wants to go out adventuring, I play on the Karana server and can be<br/>
currently found in Riverval. Farewell<br/>
<br/>
