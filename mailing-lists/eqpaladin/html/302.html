<div id="ygrps-yiv-188690781">To answer a few questions first:<br/>
I play on the Rathe server as a humble Dwarf Paladin named &quot;Dauldon Blackstone&quot;<br/>
I was wondering about the list myself, glad to see it is still here.<br/>
I have not seen any remnants of the Elven empire in the deserts of Ro.<br/>
<br/>
A question:<br/>
I am not certain how the other servers operate, however on Rathe, it seems that a shiny brass shield is now one of the more rare items in the game.  I have seen one being sold for as high as 100 platinum (ouch).  The area that spawns the creature that occasionally has the shield, is always camped, no matter the time of day I try.  A magic shield, as you all know, is a nice benefit to have with the bashing ability, to be able to hit creatures that need magic to cause damage against them.  Let me get to the question before I get to far off here.<br/>
Are there other magic shields that we as Paladins can use?<br/>
If so, would you mind sharing the information.  It does not have to be very specific, just a hint or twelve &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Also to comment on something else I read in one of the mails... <br/>
I would have to agree with the attitude of most people when a &quot;Holy Knight&quot; comes to the rescue (more often to our folly as the &quot;rescuees&quot; run and the &quot;rescuer&quot; gets stuck with the fiends) and either lays hands or heals to the end of mana, as being less than satisfying.  I however, feel like I helped someone, albeit most likely someone who will watch me die in the future and not lift a finger to help.  I think my chances are a bit better for someone to help me if I help others and not watch another die while not even trying to help.  Also from a role-playing aspect, I do believe the right thing is being done, never would a Paladin turn his head to such persons in distress.</div>
