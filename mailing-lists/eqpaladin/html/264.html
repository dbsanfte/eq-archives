<div id="ygrps-yiv-722774729">I think they should be unique, or at least only one chance to get the<br/>
sword every two months or so....otherwise everyone would have one<br/>
eventually....or maybe even...one sword per month...if the group<br/>
attempting to get the sword fails..it disappears for the rest of that<br/>
month.  That will at least make getting this or that holy sword something<br/>
for great value and fame.  Let that paladin&#39;s name ring loud and clear<br/>
from the forests of Nektulos to the swamps of Innothule.</div>
