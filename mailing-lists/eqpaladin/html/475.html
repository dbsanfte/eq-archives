<b>Subject:</b> Re: Starting a Dwarven Paladin (longish) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-544847124">Here&#39;s a peek into my thinking and reflections on my choice of ability points<br/>
distribution:<br/>
<br/>
When I started my Dwarven Paladin, I put extra points into agility,<br/>
intelligence, and a few leftover points into wisdom and dexterity.  I never<br/>
escape a battle unscathed, so I&#39;m not sure the agility is helping or not - I<br/>
took that one on faith. The 75 int. helps a lot in learning new skills quickly<br/>
- as an example, when I am grouped with someone and doing &quot;language lessons&quot;<br/>
where we speak to each other in our native language to teach the other party<br/>
member that language ( I was learning Halfling, the Halfling was learning<br/>
Dwarven), I saw the &quot;your language skills have improved&quot; message every 2<br/>
screens of scrolling text.  Another example is &quot;you have gotten better at bash&quot;<br/>
which I get every 8th bash or so until I am topped out for my level.  The<br/>
leftover points in Wisdom offer the direct benefit of more mana, but as I<br/>
advance in levels I have noticed that the amount of mana I have becomes less of<br/>
an issue as my spells become more potent and my mana increases naturally.  And<br/>
finally Dexterity - I miss so often swinging that 1h minotaur axe I wonder if I<br/>
picked up a cursed one!  It seems like I miss about 4-6 out of 10 swings on<br/>
average.<br/>
<br/>
The 100 strength we get is more than adequate for us Paladins, so I left that<br/>
alone.  The 55 charisma was so pathetic I didn&#39;t think that sinking all my 20<br/>
points into it would be worthwhile, and so far I&#39;ve been happy enough with the<br/>
prices I get at the Human NPC vendors - this took some work in building up my<br/>
faction with those merchants, but I wanted to kill the faction-raising gnolls<br/>
of BlackBurrow anyways! I also picked up a medal of merit that raises my CHA to<br/>
60, and there are other charisma-raising items in the game.<br/>
<br/>
So far, I&#39;ve had a great time wandering the plains of the karanas, visiting<br/>
those friendly folks in Rivervale, chopping ankles in BlackBurrow.  Sometimes I<br/>
wonder if I made the &quot;best&quot; ability point distribution, but to be honest I&#39;m<br/>
usually having so much fun that I don&#39;t care!  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s even possible<br/>
to hamstring yourself with a poor point distribution, so just do your best and<br/>
get to adventuring!<br/>

&gt; High charisma comes in handy after you get to that KOS (Kill On Sight)<br/>
&gt; status with the militia.  It is a lot easier to get factions back up with a<br/>
&gt; high charisma.  My wisdom is only 65, but I have not had a hard time with<br/>
&gt; any of my spells.  My dodge skill works really well because of my base<br/>
&gt; skills that I recieved as a Half-Elf.  The important thing is just to go<br/>
&gt; out and have fun.  I just read a review in PC Accelerator magazine for<br/>
&gt; Everquest and they are so addicted that they have renamed the game in their<br/>
&gt; office to Eversmack.  I just love the response that I get when I heal<br/>
&gt; someone when they are shouting for a cleric to help.<br/>
