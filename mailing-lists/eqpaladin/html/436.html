<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451197898">Hello All<br/>
	I am a 15th lvl High elf Paladin on Cazic-Thule, and I am located in<br/>
the Faydwer area. My primary hunting grounds right now are the Aqua-Goblins<br/>
(big group only) and Unrest. The problem I am facing is even though I have<br/>
all the spells for 15th lvl and I have a majority of metal armor (some is<br/>
still leather) I can&#39;t seem to make any real money. I have noticed a great<br/>
need for a combine weapon but at my present rate it will take literally<br/>
forever. I tend to hunt in groups of 3 or 4 and generally for around 5 hours<br/>
a day. I guess what I would like to know is, Am I doing something wrong? or<br/>
is everyone broke at this lvl? Is there a better spot to hunt? Your<br/>
assistance is most appreciated.<br/>
