<b>Subject:</b> Re: Why did you choose to play a paladin? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-423289067">Well, mostly you all sum it up I made a paladin for all the same reasons:<br/>
To be the holy knight on the field protecting the weak and defending all.  <br/>
Removing the undead curse from the land while remaining pure.  Helping all in <br/>
need even if means forsaking yourself.<br/>
<br/>
That is why I play the paladin even if it means a long hard road ahead, (exp <br/>
wise) We are the class that looks out for all even if it means losing some <br/>
exp or loot.  We chose this course full well knowing the requirements for it. <br/>
 Paladins may be a hard class to play but I for one am glad to stick with it <br/>
(believe me I have tried all other classes). In the long run our fortitude <br/>
will pay off,<br/>
