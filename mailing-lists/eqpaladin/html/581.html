<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205241618"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1) I have both a mino axe and a FS longsword which should I be using?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a mino axe, FS 2-handed sword, conjured hammer of wrath - I usually<br/>
carry all three, along with my shiny brass shield, using the mino axe/shiny<br/>
brass shield for day-to-day work, hammer/shield combo for magic-only creatures,<br/>
and whippin&#39; out the 2-hander whenever I get the itch to see big numbers roll<br/>
across the screen!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2) Considering the above weapons what is the next step up in weapons?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was considering a combine longsword until I got my hammer of wrath, now I&#39;m<br/>
not real clear on what the next logical upgrade is for the 1-handed/shield<br/>
combo. If it&#39;s two-handed, then I&#39;d say a bone-bladed claymore or the shiny<br/>
brass halberd, but I don&#39;t have an answer for the 1-hander - anyone?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3) How much should I except to pay to jump up to the weapon suggested in<br/>
&gt; question 2?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m on a shoestring budget myself, and given that the mino axe was 5pp, the<br/>
shield was 10pp, and the FS 2-hander was 15pp, I&#39;d expect to spend about 30pp,<br/>
but again I don&#39;t know what&#39;s out there for 30pp. If I did, I&#39;d have bought one<br/>
already :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4) Taking into account that I am currently level 16(bubble from 17th) and I<br/>
&gt; currently have:<br/>
&gt;         2 Onyx Earrings<br/>
&gt;         Spiked Leather Collar<br/>
&gt;         Leather Mask<br/>
&gt;         Small Ringmail Helm<br/>
&gt;         2 Silver Amber Rings (+2 str)<br/>
&gt;         Banded Arms<br/>
&gt;         Leather Gloves<br/>
&gt;         2 Banded Bracers<br/>
&gt;         Leather Shoulderpads<br/>
&gt;         Bronze Breastplate<br/>
&gt;         Bronze Cloak<br/>
&gt;         Bronze Leggings<br/>
&gt;         Leather Belt<br/>
&gt;         Banded Boots<br/>
&gt;         Shiny Brass Shield<br/>
&gt; Am I at where most paladins (untwinked) at this level?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, I just hit lvl 16 a couple days ago, here&#39;s my equipment list:<br/>
    No earrings<br/>
    banded collar<br/>
    leather mask<br/>
    small banded helm<br/>
    2 dervish cutthroat rings (+1ac, +2dex)<br/>
    banded arms<br/>
    leather gloves<br/>
    2 banded bracers<br/>
    leather shoulderpads<br/>
    banded tunic<br/>
    banded cloak<br/>
    patchwork leggings<br/>
    banded belt<br/>
    patchwork boots<br/>
    Shiny Brass Shield<br/>
At a glance, I&#39;d say we were quite evenly matched indeed. I want to replace my<br/>
patchwork and leather with bronze, but I&#39;m taking my own sweet time about it<br/>
and doing it one piece at a time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5) What types of armor should I be looking for?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m starting to look for armor that gives equal or better protection than<br/>
banded, and gives some sort of strength or stength/wisdom bonus. If it&#39;s just<br/>
not available, then I&#39;m replacing the patchwork and leather with bronze.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 6) How much does a BS mantle sell for ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have no idea.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 7) Anyone on Cazic Thule they would like to sell?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I play on Tunare<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well that is alot for this time. Thanks for your advice in advance.<br/>

on task, and I&#39;d fight beside you any day.<br/>
