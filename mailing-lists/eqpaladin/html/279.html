<div id="ygrps-yiv-402746363">The other day I was looking through my inventory when I came across something that baffles me. It is an icon with a picture of a knight on it. When I inspect it it says KNIGHT and that all classes can have it and it weights 2.0. It doesn&#39;t say that it is a lore item and it doesn&#39;t fit in any of my body inventory slots. Anyone have any idea as to what it is? I do not remember anyone giving it to me. I have just finished taking out Byle Bundin but I don&#39;t remember having received the knight when I completed this quest. I got a whole 8 silvers, oh boy. Thanks for any help.<br/>
