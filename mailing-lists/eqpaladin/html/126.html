<div id="ygrps-yiv-171361136">I believe Paw is off of Southern Karanas.  So that would be Queynos to <br/>
Queynos Hills, QH to Western Karanas, straight east to Northern Karanas, <br/>
then over the marble bridge on the south zone line.  Then you will be in <br/>
Southern Karanas, I think Paw is on the south end of it, but if you follow <br/>
the zone wall you can&#39;t help but find it.<br/>
