&gt; Hail,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a level 4 human paladin based in Freeport.  I have been working on<br/>
&gt; a quest and need some help.  I&#39;ll list what I know below my questions<br/>
&gt; (below a spoiler warning):<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I need to know when Grolaf Steadirt leaves his shop and heads to the inn<br/>
&gt; for a drink so that I can talk to him.  The time of day and which inn<br/>
&gt; would be very helpful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now for what I know: (might be considered a spoiler though not complete)<br/>
&gt; x<br/>
&gt; x<br/>
&gt; x<br/>

&gt; I received the quest from the female paladin on the upstairs balcony of<br/>
&gt; the freeport paladin&#39;s guild.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She asked me to take a note to an informant they have in the Freeport<br/>
&gt; militia. I should say &quot;Truth is Good&quot; to the guards and the correct one<br/>
&gt; would respond to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I found him in west freeport behind the milita house.  sorry, don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; my notes here so can&#39;t remember his name.  He asks for a note you were<br/>
&gt; given, you give it to him, and after he gives you something to take<br/>
&gt; back.  A note with coded info and a title at the top Zimel&#39;s Blades<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; after reporting back you are sent to the hall of records to talk to<br/>
&gt; Rashinda.  She was a total pain in the butt to get her to respond to my<br/>
&gt; question.  Again, I don&#39;t have my notes but it was something like &quot;can<br/>
&gt; you tell me if zimel&#39;s blades existed&quot;.  Once she responds a strange<br/>
&gt; thing happens.  A male NPC enters the room and says &quot;excuse me, wrong<br/>
&gt; room&quot; so he is triggered by talking to Rashinda.  Not sure what he means<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After you get her to respond you ask &quot;Who is Ariska Zimel ?&quot; I think I<br/>
&gt; spelled his name right...  She will tell you about him and mention<br/>
&gt; Groflah Steadirt (in Groflah&#39;s Armor place).  It is up to you to make<br/>
&gt; the associated to talk to Groflah.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you find him (upstairs) and ask him about Zimel he responds that he<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t know any Zimel and that he can&#39;t talk there.  It is here that<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m stuck.  I&#39;ve heard he leaves and goes to get a drink but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know when or where.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for any help<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Friend Shawn, I would advise traveling to the Freeport docks at night.<br/>
There is a bar there that Groflah likes to frequent, and he may be found<br/>
there.  May Tunare guide your steps.</div>
