<div id="ygrps-yiv-432419010">Dear Fellow Paladins:<br/>
<br/>
I am presently on the Innoruuk server and spend most of my time near<br/>
Freeport and the surrounding zones.  My question to you all is, what are you<br/>
paying for armor?  All the blacksmiths in my area have formed some kind of<br/>
price guild and all charge basically the same price for banded armor.  I<br/>
realize this is supposed to be free enterprise and let the people set the<br/>
prices but we are getting price fixing on my server.  I had a friend on<br/>
another server tell me not to pay more than 25 plat for a Banded Tunic, but<br/>
the cheapest any of the blacksmiths (I have checked with 3 different smiths<br/>
at different times of the day) will sell the tunic for on the Innoruuk<br/>
server is 35 plat.  What do all of you pay?  I have tried to negotiate with<br/>
each blacksmith, offering my pledge of allegiance to him, but to no avail. I<br/>
have just been a part of forming a guild so I am thinking about having my<br/>
guild only deal with one smith if we can find one who will give us a break.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are your experiences in this area?  Are any of you on the Innoruuk<br/>
server?  I am going to try and go to some different areas like Butcherblock<br/>
and such to see if I can find any less expensive blacksmiths.  Now, before<br/>
some blacksmiths email me and tell me how hard it is to get up your level in<br/>
smithing, and how much it costs, I know.  I understand.  I just don&#39;t like<br/>
price fixing. I would rather negotiate and barter with each guy<br/>
independently, rather than get a set price with no negotiation.<br/>
<br/>
Please give me your feedback.<br/>
<br/>
