&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a question concerning the Hammer of Wrath.  I just obtained 15th<br/>
&gt; level and the Hammer of Wrath spell.  Now when i summon this thing and<br/>
&gt; then have it in my possesion I can right click it and it says that it is a<br/>
&gt; MAGIC ITEM, but I went to Befallen last night and when I tried to hit an<br/>
&gt; Ice Boned Skeleton with it, it said that the skele was invulnerable!  I<br/>
&gt; thought that I would be able to hit creatures that were only susceptible<br/>
&gt; to magic attack with this hammer, you know, things like Willow Wisps and<br/>
&gt; the such?  Does anyone know what the deal is with this?<br/>
