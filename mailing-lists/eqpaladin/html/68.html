<div id="ygrps-yiv-507027716">make sure you used a forge and not something else, heh....<br/>
sharpening stone and weapon are the only 2 things you need though....<br/>
it would be wise to throw 15 training poiints into it also, but you are<br/>
looking at about 150 plat to get your skill high enough to make money, so dont<br/>
start unless you know you can get that.<br/>

&gt; If I want to start blacksmithing, I was told to start on Rusty daggers. Do<br/>
&gt; I just combineone with a sharpening stone in a forge? I tried it one and<br/>
&gt; it told me my skill was not good enough, but when I tried it 2, 3, 4, 5,<br/>
&gt; and 6th times it said that &quot;those materials in those quanitites (1 dagger,<br/>
&gt; one stone) was not enough to produce anything. Did  I miss a step?<br/>
