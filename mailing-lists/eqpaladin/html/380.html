<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955730408">You&#39;ll find this is not a strength bonus but instead your skill with the<br/>
desired weapon...<br/>
<br/>
If a player uses a weapon that is &quot;above&quot; his skill you wont hit for the<br/>
maximum damage.... For instance at level 9 with a FS 2handed I did 18<br/>
damage, as soon as I got to level 10 Damage jumped to the 25 max for the<br/>
weapon. So from this I think your level is too low for such a high magic<br/>
weapon.... I bet when you hit level 20 you will get the full damage from the<br/>
weapon....<br/>

	Thanks Michael for the info.  I have a couple of questions<br/>
concerning the<br/>
	strength bonus to attack and the double attack.  I am about to go to<br/>
18th<br/>
	level as a Paladin on Innoruuk and have a shiny brass halberd as<br/>
well.  The<br/>
	most I hit for with it so far is 29 damage.  I know I get double<br/>
attack at<br/>
	19th but I have seen guys hitting with the halberd for about 34<br/>
damage and I<br/>
	assume it is from the strength bonus.  At what level does the<br/>
strength bonus<br/>
	kick in for attack?  I have 95 native strength.  What is the formula<br/>
for<br/>
	figuring your max damage with the halberd?  Thanks for all your<br/>
information<br/>
	and look forward to hearing from you.<br/>
<br/>
