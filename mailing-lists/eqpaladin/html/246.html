sword on each server? If this is true then I am doomed. How can i ever hope to get one this really really is not good.<br/>

&gt; Ghoulbane - item #1 of the (achievable) wish list of any young paladin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Rumour has it that the Froglock Lord in Upper Guk, the one who supposedly drops Ghoulbane, is level 35.  But, is it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I play on the Tunare server, one of the younger servers - people on Tunare are already nicely into the 30s (Ah, those superlevelling druids).  Heck, I&#39;m only L22 but keep chipping away at it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Consequently, if the rumours are true, it strikes me that Ghoulbane should have been liberated by now on an older server, say Fennin Ro.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Surely therefore, one of our fellow paladins can shed light onto the age old question: &quot;When can we take the Froglock Lord?&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let&#39;s hope the mist is lifted...<br/>
