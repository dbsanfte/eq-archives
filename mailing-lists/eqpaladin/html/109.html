<div id="ygrps-yiv-350489566">I understand that when hitting level 9 I will have to put a point towards<br/>
the magic skills.  What I was wondering is if I will have enough mana to be<br/>
able to cast all the spells at level 9 when I get them.  My SK didn&#39;t have<br/>
enough mana to be able to cast 2 of his spells and I would hate to get to<br/>
level 9 and have the samething happen with this guy.  But as Tyler said,<br/>
he&#39;s a level 13 Human Paladin with 85 Wisdom and he has enough mana. So I<br/>
think my Dwarf Paladin with 90 Wisdom should be ok.  I have just heard<br/>
reports that some Paladins didn&#39;t have enough mana to cast cure poison when<br/>
they first got it and I wanted to make sure that my guy would be able to.<br/>

&gt;These is what I noticed.<br/>
&gt;If you have an ability (not only on spells) from level 1, it can increase<br/>

&gt;point to learn it. And your guildmaster says &quot;You have learnt the basics<br/>
&gt;of...&quot;. It seems that you then have a base that equals to your level. THEN<br/>
&gt;it can increase by itself. But it sometimes depends of the ability. For<br/>
&gt;example, some people think that Safe Fall for the monk never increases<br/>
&gt;except with practive points.<br/>

&gt;One thing that I have noticed, (correct me if I am wrong), is that if I<br/>
&gt;haven&#39;t practiced at least one time with my Guildmaster on a type of spell<br/>
&gt;(abjuration for instance) my experience does not increase in that spell<br/>

&gt;working well, but you need to practice it with the Guildmaster at least<br/>
 </span></blockquote>once<br/>

&gt;If anyone has any more information on practicing and spells, let me know.<br/>
