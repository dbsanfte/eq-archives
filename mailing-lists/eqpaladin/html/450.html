<div id="ygrps-yiv-651363559">Anyone using a combine 2 handed sword yet ?  What are the stats for them<br/>
and what can you expect to hit for with it.  I am outgrowing my fine steel<br/>
2 handed sword and would like to make sure that it is worth getting a<br/>
combine.  My fine steel hits for 25Hp max.</div>
