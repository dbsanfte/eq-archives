<b>Subject:</b> High Elf Paladin Quests <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-560634709">I am a high elf paladin and am wondering about some quests in my area.<br/>
<br/>
1. The first quest I got was the &quot;go to kelethin and talk to the drunk&quot;<br/>
quest but I stoped because I have head that this is a broken quest and no on<br/>
who has finished it has gotten anything from it, is it broken, is it worth<br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
2. The quest I have now is to Travel to the innothule swamp and kill the<br/>
Jojongua. I have not been able to find any info on this beast or any paladin<br/>
who has done this quest.. The guild master describes the Jojongua as a beast<br/>
of unbridled fury (or something like that) so it kinda scares me I am level<br/>
8 and don&#39;t want to track 1/2 accross the world to get my but kicked, does<br/>
anyone know what level is a good level for this quest and anymore info you<br/>
can give me on it would be great.<br/>
<br/>
3. Ogre head... I killed Corflunk in BB and got the Ogre head it&#39;s a quest<br/>
item but is it for a Paladin quest? should I hold onto it or sell it to<br/>
someone who can use it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
<br/>
