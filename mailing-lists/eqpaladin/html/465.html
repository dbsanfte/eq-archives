<b>Subject:</b> 2h Slashing vs. 1h Blunt <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705434489">I have recently gotten to the point where I can cap my 1H slashing but being<br/>
a dwarf, I don&#39;t think I can keep both 2h slashing and 1h blunt up.<br/>
<br/>
Is summoning a hammer really useful other than just using it as a magical<br/>
weapon before you can afford combine? I heard someone say that it is good<br/>
because you can summon one after to die to get your body back. How will it<br/>
help you if you have no armor though, you&#39;re running around naked with a<br/>
hammer.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking at 2h slashing but was wondering if anyone could tell me another<br/>
use for 1h blunt that might change my mind. Thanks for your time.<br/>
