<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409774194">The quest where you give the token of bravery and the token of generosity to <br/>
the fellow behind the hall of truth has made me pause.  The NPC says that you <br/>
can only take the test of truth once and tarantulas should be EASY for you <br/>
first.  Has anyone completed this successfully?  If so, what level should I be <br/>
to do it?  Is it useful to bring a spell caster to help out with it?<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I heard is that this quest really ticks off the freeport <br/>
militia to the point where you become Kill on Sight.  Every paladin operating <br/>
near freeport should know that there are fake walls out past the gate that can <br/>
be used to get into the catacombs and sewers and thus get to the bank and guild <br/>
without too much trouble.  The one for north freeport is on the north side wall <br/>
outside the gate in west commons.  it is the wall that runs east west.<br/>
