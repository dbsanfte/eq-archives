<b>Subject:</b> Re: What level do you need to be able to take Squire Narls? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-578046874">I plan to bring a few friends.  A couple of spell casters at least one will <br/>
root Squire Narls.   then they will burn him while I beat on him.  Probably <br/>
will have a fighter type along also like a monk.<br/>
<br/>
When I first attacked him I was able to get him to below half hits several <br/>
times. then he would run and I would get out of range..  eventually he killed <br/>
me.  Not the desirable out come.<br/>

&gt; Well, I just got back from a nice trip to the Butcherblocks, and the kind<br/>
&gt; cleric who rebound me to Freeport threw in a bravery and a spirit armor just<br/>
&gt; for grins.  Self, I say, why not go and take out Narls so you can do that<br/>
&gt; quest?  Well, with about 287hp (God, I love bravery), a 1h slash skill of<br/>
&gt; 33, full leather armor, and about five lesser heals thrown onto me by some<br/>
&gt; nice wandering cleric, I managed to hit Narls five time before I died.  Once<br/>
&gt; for 10, once for 8, and three times for 1.  Now, Narls is green to me, and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m afraid if I go too much further levelwise, I wont be able to get this<br/>
&gt; quest.  Thoughts?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>
