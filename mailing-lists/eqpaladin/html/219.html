<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740702175">I use a Dwarven Axe right now (6 dmg 26 delay), so I am able to hit <br/>
them almost twice in the time that they are stunned.  Plus the bash stun give <br/>
me time to run away if that is needed.  Many people compare kick to bash, and <br/>
I must say that I take the side of bash.  The actual damage done is less than <br/>
kick.  Bash starts out at ~4 and goes up by 1 point every 15 or 20 points, <br/>
that&#39;s my experience anyway, while Kick does 9 max at first and starts to go <br/>
up once you hit 75 skill.  What people forget is that the occasional stun (25 <br/>
- 33% of the time?) lets you hit it with your weapon and not get hit back.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know if the stun leaves him open to your attacks, meaning that his AC <br/>
goes down, but I&#39;ve found that if the monster is stunned I am usually able to <br/>
hit him. <br/>
<br/>
	I know I sound like a powergamer, and that&#39;s because I am.  I love to <br/>
learn all the inner nuances of a game and use them to my advantage.  Don&#39;t <br/>
worry I always do bug reports on anything illegal that I find.  What I&#39;m <br/>
talking about is the things that you SHOULD know, for instance; what route <br/>
and NPC takes when it tries to run, which monster carries the best loot and <br/>
gives you the best XP. <br/>
