You must practice it a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I got it at level 15, but since I didn&#39;t have the<br/>
time to spent practicing it on lower<br/>
level undead I waited(I did not want to risk my<br/>
life or the life of my friends with<br/>
15 fizzles).<br/>
<br/>
At level 19 I had a few hours of free times, so I<br/>
went to West Karana, near the North Karana<br/>
zone on the river border there is a undead spawn<br/>
spot and I practice my skill for nearly 2 hours,<br/>
it went up from 30 to 100.<br/>
<br/>
A trick you may want to use for practice, once you<br/>
killed a undead, you can still cast<br/>
Ward Undead on his corpse until it disapears. I<br/>
did that, picked the undead that was<br/>
alone, killed it and practice on his corpse, when<br/>
it disapeared I killed another and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps you.<br/>
