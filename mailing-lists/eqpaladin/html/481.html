<div id="ygrps-yiv-172289730">Speaking of Unrest...what levels of characters should adventure in Unrest?<br/>
<br/>
I have never been there, but love attacking the Undead.  I am level 20 and<br/>
have both the Shiny Brass Halberd and the Polished Granite Tomahawk as well<br/>
as the Darkwood shield and love bashing ghouls, magic spawn and undead.  Is<br/>
Unrest worth it?<br/>

Newly armed with my enchanted arsenal, I took my<br/>
wizard and myself to Unrest and have since comenced to<br/>
group with others to beat back the hordes of undead<br/>
that spawn from the depths of the evil that is the<br/>
Estate of Unrest.  And I&#39;ll tell you, it&#39;s a lot of<br/>
fun to fight with every shot going off while around me<br/>
dual wielding warriors and rangers, and other<br/>
paladins, are hitting with their offhands, or kicking<br/>
or bashing, for INVULNERABLE results.</div>
