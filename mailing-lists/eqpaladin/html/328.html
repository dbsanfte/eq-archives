<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266220352">In response to the magic shield question.  I currently have a Shiny Brass<br/>
Shield which is AC 10 and gives you +10 to magic resistance and puts off<br/>
light like a Lightstone.  Additionally, it is magic, so you can bash wisps<br/>
and ice boned skeleton&#39;s with it.<br/>
<br/>
In another post, I saw a message about another shield which I hope to obtain<br/>
someday.<br/>
<br/>
The premier shield is the Darkwood Shield obtainable from a named Gnoll in<br/>
Highpass Hold, towards the Karana end.  The area is continuously camped so<br/>
bring a wizard friend, preferably of an obscene level.  Between the rare<br/>
spawn and the campers, do not be surprised if it takes you all day<br/>
<br/>
The shield offers +9 to STR and AC12.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s usefulness peaks at around L30 for a paladin when one obtains<br/>
Ghoulbane.  You are far better off using 2HS at lower levels and capitalise<br/>
on double attack.<br/>
