<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-501900954">*Hello,<br/>
*I&#39;m a sixth level Paladin running solo around Freeport.  Can <br/>
*anybody tell<br/>
*me where you get the Minotaur Axes I keep hearing about?  With <br/>
*my limited<br/>
*funds, it seems like I&#39;ll be stuck with a rusty scimitar or <br/>
*sword for life!<br/>
* Thanks!<br/>

The easier minotaurs are in the minotaur caves in the Steamfont zone, which<br/>
is on the other continent, Faydwer.  But, they aren&#39;t &quot;easy&quot; by any means at<br/>
6th level; I wouldn&#39;t try them solo.<br/>
<br/>
There used to be lesser minotaurs in Beholder, a.k.a. the Gorge of Grobb,<br/>
over by Runnyeye and Misty Thicket, by Rivervale, but now I hear there are<br/>
only those very tough minotaurs :(<br/>
<br/>
Easiest route is to buy one, around 5 platinum, from another player.</div>
