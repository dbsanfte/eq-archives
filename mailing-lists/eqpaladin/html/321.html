<div id="ygrps-yiv-940027946">You can hit the ice boned skeleton with the hammer, I have done it.  You<br/>
either didn&#39;t have the hammer in your melee hand, or you were bashing with a<br/>
standard shield and it will say that the skeleton is invulnerable when you<br/>
are bashing.  But otherwise, you should be able to hit the skeleton with the<br/>
hammer, although I would recommend haveing a party with you if that is your<br/>
only magic weapon.<br/>

I have a question concerning the Hammer of Wrath.  I just obtained 15th<br/>
level and the Hammer of Wrath spell.  Now when i summon this thing and then<br/>
have it in my possesion I can right click it and it says that it is a MAGIC<br/>
ITEM, but I went to Befallen last night and when I tried to hit an Ice Boned<br/>
Skeleton with it, it said that the skele was invulnerable!  I thought that I<br/>
would be able to hit creatures that were only susceptible to magic attack<br/>
with this hammer, you know, things like Willow Wisps and the such?  Does<br/>
anyone know what the deal is with this?<br/>
