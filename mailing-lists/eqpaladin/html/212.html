<b>Subject:</b> Re: Why did you choose to play a paladin? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337779256">Well, my question has incited some postings and that is what i had hoped<br/>
for. This list is kinda on the quiet side and i was hoping to help incite<br/>
some life into it.  If something interesting happened to you on day while<br/>
playing or you ran across something cool or you just have a question...share<br/>
it with all here. I myself like hearing about someone&#39;s interesting<br/>
experience as I might learn something from it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, i forgot to tell why I chose a paladin. To me, a paladin is like a<br/>
knight in shining armor.... swooping in to save the day and all that. They<br/>
are like a super-hero. Me, i like sharing and helping others and most expect<br/>
a paladin to do just that . I want to be that knight coming to save the<br/>
day.. fight against insurmountable odds so your friends can live to fight<br/>
another day. I chose Half-Elf because high elves and Erudites are too<br/>
conceited, Dwarves are too short(no offense intended) and I play a human in<br/>
RL.<br/>
