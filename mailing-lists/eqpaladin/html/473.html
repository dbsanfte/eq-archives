<div id="ygrps-yiv-15406657">In my mind there are only two Paladins worth playing. The Dwarven because they are great statistic wise and human because they are ok statistic wise plus they level faster. The main problem with Dwarven Paladins is that they are one of the slowest leveling Race/Class combos in the game.</div>
