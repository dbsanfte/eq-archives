<div id="ygrps-yiv-367882574">Be very careful with this kind of mail. They are called spams.<br/>
They are made to saturate networks. And they could block servers in a<br/>
company. If everybody send a mail to 10 people, after n tries, you have 10^n<br/>
mails travelling on the network.<br/>
No people working seriously on computers would ever send such a message,<br/>
even Microsoft   :o)<br/>
You will know next time. That&#39;s the way you learn.   :o)<br/>
