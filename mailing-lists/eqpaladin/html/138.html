The back entrance to north freeport can be found very easily, if you are <br/>
standing at the gate entering the town/west freeport, looking INTO the town. <br/>
Follow the wall to your left. When the wall hits the corner you can walk <br/>
through a wall in that area that leads to the sewers, I walked through them <br/>
once and got lucky that i chose all the right paths, there are many to <br/>
choose from. You end up coming out at the fishing hut near the paladin <br/>
guild. There is also another sewer near the palaidin guild that leads to <br/>
east freeport. I guess this is so you can avoid guards all together. They <br/>
are really cool to walk through, I&#39;m just shocked no thoughts of putting <br/>
monsters in there have happened yet.<br/>

&gt;Hail,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just some comments to the list.  I read the list in digest version so I<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t respond to specific emails.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1.  Do not overly worry about having enough mana to cast spells.  I have<br/>
&gt;reached the 19th Order in the Service of Brell and have yet to find a<br/>
&gt;spell I cannot cast due to lack of total mana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2.  It is best to always seed any new skills.  Check your spell book to<br/>
&gt;see what skill the new spells you gain are and drop a point accordingly<br/>
&gt;into each one.  Just as a tip, buy the lowest mana spell in each class,<br/>
&gt;just for the purpose of skilling.  I used sense undead to raise my<br/>
&gt;Divination skill, once I started it maxxed in about 3 days of casting.<br/>
&gt;I cast while hanging out just about anywhere.  The hardest for us I<br/>
&gt;think will be conjuration, to the extent I haven&#39;t even bought the<br/>
&gt;Hammer spell because I don&#39;t see a use.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3.  Magic weapons are important.  I am using a Combine 2-Handed at the<br/>
&gt;moment.  The cost was very high at 112 plat, but quite worth it in the<br/>
&gt;long run.  I am fortunate to have several friends with whom I pool coin<br/>
&gt;to purchase items.  But ye need to try and save at least 60 plat and buy<br/>
&gt;a Combine Longsword to use for coining.  The reasoning behind this is<br/>
&gt;the combines are faster and hit harder, thereby allowing you to slay<br/>
&gt;those evil bastages in a more timely fashion.  Willows are great coin,<br/>
&gt;the lightstones sell for 8 gold (i&#39;m a dwarf, charisma ain&#39;t me strong<br/>
&gt;point) and the greaters sell for almost 4 plat.  That is to merchants.<br/>
&gt;There are always players out there in need and you can make roughly<br/>
&gt;fifty percent profit over merchant costs sometimes.  On a note about<br/>
&gt;Ghoulsbane, the crew I&#39;m with will be attempting to get a few of those<br/>
&gt;this weekend.  One thing I know for sure, don&#39;t try it if your under<br/>
&gt;20th level.  The rumor is the FroggerKing is close to level 30.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4. I remember seeing a message regarding a back entrance to North<br/>
&gt;Freeport.   I am curious if anyone has better details of this.  I plan<br/>
&gt;on rampaging those evil guards this weekend (very holy-type evil grin).<br/>
