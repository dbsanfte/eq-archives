<b>Subject:</b> [Quests] The Testimony of Truth.  It may have more value than we think! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059708481">For the many Knights out there who have completed the Test of Truth in<br/>
Freeport, you know that the reward for this quest is your Testimony of<br/>
Truth.  For most of us, we just stuck this piece of paper in the bank<br/>
and that was it.  Sure, we now know we are Knights, a title I wish we<br/>
could wear more obviously.  But since the GMs have still not granted our<br/>
requests to add the Sir to our names, we have to do what we can with it.<br/>
<br/>
But does the Testimony of Truth have any other uses other than a status<br/>
symbol?  Some people have speculated that it can be given to someone to<br/>
obtain a special item.  Maybe there is some quest out there that ends in<br/>
&quot;Give me proof that you are a Knight of this land&quot;, but personally I<br/>
don&#39;t want to just give it to anyone.<br/>
Now comes the good news, I hope.<br/>
A friend of mine on the Veeshan server had completed the Test of Truth a<br/>
month ago, or so.  He had put the Testimony in a backpack in the bank,<br/>
like most of us, and there it sat.  One day he was fighting in Grater<br/>
Faydark and Crushbone and went to sell his stuff in the High Elf city.<br/>
He went a merchant and started selling the many weapons and pieces of<br/>
armor he has found, and to his surprise he received considerably more<br/>
money than he had been getting.  Being from Freeport, the High Elves<br/>
usually didn&#39;t like him too much and the prices were very poor, so he<br/>
was rather confused by the sudden price change.  But he figured maybe he<br/>
had a fine steel weapon he hadn&#39;t noticed and sold it to the shop<br/>
owner.  Kicking himself for possibly selling such a nice weapon he went<br/>
back to fight again.  Once again he returned and this time he watched<br/>
was he was selling very closely to avoid the same mistake twice.  Once<br/>
again, to his surprise he was getting considerable more money than he<br/>
had in the past.<br/>
Next he went to the Paladin guild.  He sold a few items that he was very<br/>
familiar with, and WOW, he was making at lest TWICE as much as he had,<br/>
even more than he made in his own guild hall in Freeport.  So he decided<br/>
to con the shopkeeper.  She coned Warmly?  That couldn&#39;t be right.  High<br/>
Elves don&#39;t like any other races that much.  They normally coned<br/>
apprehensively, indifferently at best.  What had he killed to gain<br/>
faction that quickly?  Had he taken out some quest related NPC in<br/>
Crushbone that he hadn&#39;t noticed?<br/>
He walked around the town a little coning everyone.  It didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
have effected everyone, but most of the shopkeepers saw him as amiably,<br/>
and most of them were giving him rather good prices.<br/>
<br/>
Well, after a few more hours of fighting, and some of the quickest money<br/>
making he had experienced, he went to the bank to drop off some of the<br/>
money and a few rusty weapons to be sharpened.  While moving stuff back<br/>
and forth (I really wish they would fit is so you can put items directly<br/>
into a bag in your bank slots) he noticed he had accidentally swapped a<br/>
backpack with one in the bank.  He had been caring his Testimony, a long<br/>
with a few other lore items he had collected, on him the whole time.  At<br/>
that time he didn&#39;t connect this with the better prices.  He was just<br/>
happy he hadn&#39;t died.  He really didn&#39;t want to loose that note in case<br/>
later in the game it becomes useful.<br/>
<br/>
So shortly he  headed back to Freeport to continue work on the Soulfire<br/>
quest.  And after a few days of fighting and getting the old prices he<br/>
started to put the two events together.  While I have not heard back<br/>
from him on this since (I only know him through e-mail) I believe he is<br/>
testing his theory.  He thinks the Testimony of Truth raises your<br/>
effective Charisma and faction standing with many races and classes.<br/>
<br/>
What I am asking is simple.  Carry your note around with you for a few<br/>
days.  If we could get as many people to try this and see what happens<br/>
we could confirm this rumor.  If this is true, it might make many of our<br/>
lives easier.  If it is not true, and he just happen to trigger some<br/>
even that gave him major faction bonuses with the High Elves, than we<br/>
are no worse off then before.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you find.  Maybe this little, previously considered<br/>
rather worthless, note can help us after all.<br/>
