<br/>
I am Njelm, a Paladin from the dwarven city of Kaladim. I have felt the need for a magic one handed weapon and think that the combine longsword would be nice. <br/>
I have heard that these can be bought from gypsies ?? Where do they live ?<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
