<br/>
Sha&#39;kel Al&#39;methe (Terrew Marr) here and just wanted to greet all the fellow <br/>
paladins out there. I do have one question for you high elf paladins out <br/>
there, have you completed Tynkale&#39;s first quest? Has anyone completed a <br/>
quest? I am curious to as what it offers. I know a lot of magic users quests <br/>
result special spells.<br/>
Well that is all for now, may your swords strike true.<br/>
