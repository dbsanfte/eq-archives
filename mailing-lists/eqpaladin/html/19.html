<b>Subject:</b> Guard Xyrin and the Quest of Something or Another <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590816700">I&#39;d like to introduce myself.  My character rather. The name is Tiresias,<br/>
and right now he&#39;s a level 14 Paladin on the Povar server.  You know...<br/>
Povar... You never heard of Povar?! =)  He serves Erollisi Marr 24/7.  I<br/>
usually hangs around Freeport area... the commonlands, Desert of Ro, and<br/>
Befallen, smiting evil and whatnot.  In any case...<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone did the quest to look for the last Guard Xyrin in<br/>
the quest that starts in the Temple of Marr.  Is that a beginner&#39;s quest or<br/>
what?  Because I got as far as the isle in the Ocean of Tears talking to all<br/>
the Holy Woman O&#39; Fun and I hear a scream come out of nowhere yearning for<br/>
help, but I can&#39;t find where it&#39;s coming from!  The nearest islands have<br/>
goblins I&#39;m not sure I want to mess with... anybody do this one yet?<br/>
<br/>
