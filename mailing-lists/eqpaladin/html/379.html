<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887017527">Thanks Michael for the info.  I have a couple of questions concerning the<br/>
strength bonus to attack and the double attack.  I am about to go to 18th<br/>
level as a Paladin on Innoruuk and have a shiny brass halberd as well.  The<br/>
most I hit for with it so far is 29 damage.  I know I get double attack at<br/>
19th but I have seen guys hitting with the halberd for about 34 damage and I<br/>
assume it is from the strength bonus.  At what level does the strength bonus<br/>
kick in for attack?  I have 95 native strength.  What is the formula for<br/>
figuring your max damage with the halberd?  Thanks for all your information<br/>
and look forward to hearing from you.<br/>
