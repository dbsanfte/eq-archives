<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134752214">I am a high elf paladin level 14 on Solusek server and I am wondering, is<br/>
it possible for me to do this quest to become a knight? Or is the quest<br/>
only open for paladins from freeport and below level 9? If that is the<br/>
case they should implement more quests that are open to paladins of other<br/>
races and higher levels that can give the same result, adding a Sir to<br/>
your name.. It would REALLY stink to find out I missed out on this, since<br/>
at lower levels I was not very interrested in questing at all, I did some<br/>
quests in my guild but they were very crappy and had puny rewards, like<br/>
the Dvinn heart quest, kill a level 25+ npc, get his head and for that you<br/>
get a few silver.. :/ A quest like the test of truth with a REAL reward<br/>
would really improve my view on quests in EQ..<br/>
