<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-263277465">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone know where I could get a nice magic shield.  The <br/>
only one I know of is the shiney shield that can be obtained off a trainer <br/>
orc in CB.  Are there any others around?  Can you actually buy one from a <br/>
vender?  Our bash is a great addition to our attacks, but unless your shield <br/>
is magic, you will be unable to hit invulnerable creatures such as ghouls <br/>
and iceboned skeletons.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
