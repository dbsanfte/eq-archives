<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210743802"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I was just wondering if anyone knew of a place I might find a magical<br/>
&gt;weapon of some sort. Nothing really powerfull, I&#39;m only 10th lvl right<br/>
&gt;now, I just need something that will do damage to iceboned skeletons and<br/>
&gt;ghouls. Also, I seem to be making money very slowly. The only trade skills<br/>
&gt;I have are cooking and a little blacksmithing. Is there a good zone to<br/>
&gt;make money in? The most money I have ever had at one time is 8 pp! Is this<br/>
&gt;normal or am I going about things all wrong?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Gypsy camps usually have a vendor selling Combine weapons, which are<br/>
magical, lighter than their steel counterparts, and faster.  However, they<br/>
usually cost in the range of 30-90 pp, depending on what you&#39;re looking<br/>
for.  Personally, I saved up 43 pp for a Combine Scimitar and I like it<br/>
much better than my mino axe, plus it can hit all the nasties like wisps,<br/>
ghouls, and iceboned skeletons.<br/>
<br/>
As far as what zone to make money in, I don&#39;t really have any suggestions<br/>
for you.  Going after any MOB with a weapon nets you that weapon, which is<br/>
usually good for at least a couple of gold.  Are you spending your money on<br/>
armor and such as you go along?  I usually save up for things that I want,<br/>
like the Combine weapon, rather than spend money as I get it.<br/>
