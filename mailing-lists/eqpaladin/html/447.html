<div id="ygrps-yiv-854661840">I was close approaching level 14 when I made a trip over to Antonica. with a<br/>
heavily map-obsessed wizard in tote, we went all the way over to Qeynos. by<br/>
myself, hunting gnolls in Blackburrow for an hour or three, I made 10 pp.<br/>
after a few trips there and to the Bandit camps nearby, I got the 55 pp to<br/>
buy my combine long sword (and hunting in the catacombs got me up to level<br/>
15 when I was with my wizard friend). the trip is a pain and I highly<br/>
recommend camo if you are going the Beholder route. also, if you go through<br/>
HighHold, do *not* investigate the inn. an evil dark elf necro killed me<br/>
*twice* in there and finally my wizard friend had to be consented (he was<br/>
bound there, while I was at Rivervale). I found that Faydwer was lacking in<br/>
exp and money at my level, but now that I have a magical weapon, I may try<br/>
Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron when I get back home. I hope this helps.<br/>

&quot;By G&#39;Quon, I cannot remember the last time I was in a fight like that! No<br/>
moral ambiguity. No ancient and overpowering Enemy. They were, as you say,<br/>
the Bad Guys, and we were the Good Guys....and they made a very satisfying<br/>
*thump* when they hit the ground!&quot;<br/>

&gt; Hello All<br/>
&gt; 	I am a 15th lvl High elf Paladin on Cazic-Thule, and I am located in<br/>
&gt; the Faydwer area. My primary hunting grounds right now are the Aqua-Goblins<br/>
&gt; (big group only) and Unrest. The problem I am facing is even though I have<br/>
&gt; all the spells for 15th lvl and I have a majority of metal armor (some is<br/>
&gt; still leather) I can&#39;t seem to make any real money. I have noticed a great<br/>
&gt; need for a combine weapon but at my present rate it will take literally<br/>
&gt; forever. I tend to hunt in groups of 3 or 4 and generally for around 5 hours<br/>
&gt; a day. I guess what I would like to know is, Am I doing something wrong? or<br/>
&gt; is everyone broke at this lvl? Is there a better spot to hunt? Your<br/>
&gt; assistance is most appreciated.<br/>
