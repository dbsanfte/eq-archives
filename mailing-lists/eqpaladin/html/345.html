 </span></blockquote>If you can do it, it&#39;s ok. You will have a very good dmg/delay ratio.<br/>
IMHO, your character is a very young, and you don&#39;t really need it. In a few<br/>
levels, you could have a mino axe (dmg 8, delay 37 (not sure), heavy !!!)<br/>
until the first 10s. Plus, you could loose your corpse easily, and not be<br/>
able to have it back before it disappears. I remember it happened to me at<br/>
lvl 3 and I lost my guild tunic. I can imagine if I had a dwarven battle axe<br/>
at that time. Well, I was a real newby at that time, and I went to Lesser<br/>
Faydark. I ran to the browny camp while running from a centurion  :o)<br/>
