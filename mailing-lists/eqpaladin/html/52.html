&gt;*I seem to have found myself in a similar situation.  I&#39;m a fifth lvl<br/>
&gt;*Paladin out of Felwithe, and for my first quest I was told to find an<br/>
&gt;*Elf by the name of Tandan Nybright in Kelethin.  I have searched all<br/>
&gt;*over Kelethin and talked to many Wood Elves that call it home... yet no<br/>
&gt;*one seems to have heard of him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He is &quot;the drunkard,&quot; the High Elf NPC who wanders around inside and right<br/>
&gt;outside Kelethin.  I&#39;ve not been able to rouse him from his drunken stupor<br/>
&gt;enough to recognize his name, and our Guildmaster Tynkale asked.<br/>
