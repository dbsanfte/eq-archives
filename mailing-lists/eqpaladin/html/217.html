<div id="ygrps-yiv-297233330">Personally, I think that you want to keep both 1hs and 2hs maxed.  Then, use the best sword that you have, irrespective of 1h or 2h.<br/>
<br/>
I use a 2hs shiny brass halberd with pretty impressive stats and I hit for 34 34 often when my double attack clicks in.  Compare that to 1hs combine long and bash... which does around 15 15 and 8 - All of those attacks... and it adds up to just 1 of my double hits.  Also, bash is slowish to reset... meaning that you don&#39;t get to use it as quickly as your weapon.... making the comparison worse.<br/>
<br/>
However, when I get Ghoulbane, I&#39;ll go back to 1hs - especially when fighting undead.<br/>
<br/>
Then, after getting the Great Zweihander or Soulfire, I&#39;ll be back to 2hs.<br/>
<br/>
Just depends on what is the best weapon that you have.<br/>
<br/>
I think bash is pretty ordinary.  Some people argue that it gives you time to get a heal off on yourself - once you hit L22 or higher... you&#39;re much better off rooting your opponent, backing back, getting in half a dozen heals, then rejoining the fray.  Also, I don&#39;t bother using ward in combat with undead anymore either... unless to initiate an attack or kill a runner... so I don&#39;t need it to time my ward casting (and, if I do use ward, I normally dodge and parry myself out of trouble anyway).<br/>

For paladin, you will definitly want to go with 1h slashing,  the <br/>
delay/damage ratio is quite balanced for 1h and 2h with 2h having a bit <br/>
advantage when used with double attack, yet you cant use a shield and more <br/>
importantly you cant use bash, one of the most important skill for paladin <br/>
second to lay hand. And of course there are the holy swords, the ones we know <br/>
are 1h.  So choose well and follow your heart. heh<br/>
