<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017090799">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
     I have a question regarding the flash of light spell that supposedly<br/>
blinds an opponent. For some reason when I cast it, and it misses, nothing<br/>
happens, but if I cast and it DOES blind them I get hit by that &quot;blind&quot;<br/>
creature for some absurdly high amount of damage. Im level 15 and have been<br/>
blinded in the past by Muddites and it is not fun. I feel that when I blind<br/>
a creautre in combat (not to pull it) it does not really work that well at<br/>
all. When I pull with it, it seems to work as monsters will run off in odd<br/>
directions all confused. Does this happen to others as well.<br/>
<br/>

PS- I find casting blind also works better than useless taunt skill when you<br/>
want a creature to attack you and leave your teammate alone.</div>
