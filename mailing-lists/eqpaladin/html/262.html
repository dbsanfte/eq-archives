<b>Subject:</b> Holy Swords only ONE per server? Is this right? <br/>
<br/><br/>

I am a bit new to this list, so this might have come up before.  But it<br/>
seems from some recent discussions (mostly about ghoulsbane) that there is<br/>
only ONE of each holy sword per server. Is that right?<br/>
<br/>
I guess it would cut down on the camping for them, like with dervish rings<br/>
and other now common magical items, as well as encourage many a young<br/>
paladin to an untimely death!<br/>
<br/>
If this is the case, I really dont think it is a good idea. The whole idea<br/>
of a Paladin (for me) is to fight with holy arms against evil. I suppose it<br/>
would be okay if there is some generic Holy weapon that ALL paladins can<br/>
get, with just some Unique ones.<br/>
<br/>
It really would encourage me to restart my Paladin on the very next server<br/>
that opens if this is the case!</div>
