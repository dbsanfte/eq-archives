<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949292080">This happens to me quite often.  Blind is a very useful spell, but not in the<br/>
way it should be.  If you blind a creature you are fighting, and then run it<br/>
will follow as if the spell did nothing.  That part should be fixed.  If you<br/>
blind a creature that is NOT fighting you, and it doesn&#39;t resist, it will often<br/>
run right by you, and eventually come back when it is unblinded to fight you.<br/>
Remember, the flash of light spell doesn&#39;t last very long.   I have had this<br/>
happen to me many times.<br/>
<br/>
When the blind spell becomes REALLY useful is when you use it as a taunt.  All<br/>
spells in the game have an Anger (or Hate) rating.  This is how monsters rate a<br/>
spell vrs direct damage, and why they will often attack a caster who has never<br/>
done any actual damage to them.  Blind spells are very near the top of the Anger<br/>
rating.  If you are ever fighting in a group and the monster decides to attack<br/>
your wizard (because the wizard just hit him for three 100pt fireballs) and your<br/>
taunt is doing nothing, Flash of Light the monster.  He will VERY QUICKLY turn<br/>
to attack you.  But be warned, it may be very difficult to get the monster<br/>
taunted off of you.<br/>
<br/>
Also be careful using Flash of Light as a pull spell.  It will often pull the<br/>
entire camp onto you, and no one will be able to change the little critters&#39;<br/>
minds.<br/>

&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      I have a question regarding the flash of light spell that supposedly<br/>
&gt; blinds an opponent. For some reason when I cast it, and it misses, nothing<br/>
&gt; happens, but if I cast and it DOES blind them I get hit by that &quot;blind&quot;<br/>
&gt; creature for some absurdly high amount of damage. Im level 15 and have been<br/>
&gt; blinded in the past by Muddites and it is not fun. I feel that when I blind<br/>
&gt; a creautre in combat (not to pull it) it does not really work that well at<br/>
&gt; all. When I pull with it, it seems to work as monsters will run off in odd<br/>
&gt; directions all confused. Does this happen to others as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      -Dyce<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS- I find casting blind also works better than useless taunt skill when you<br/>
&gt; want a creature to attack you and leave your teammate alone.<br/>
