<b>Subject:</b> Re: magic only creatures - my solution and question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-4776501">A lot of the higher level undead can only be hit by magic weapons.  Don&#39;t go <br/>
to Befallen or Unrest without one.  The ice boned and dry boned skeletons <br/>
can only be hit by magic and are nasty enough to be a tough fight even with <br/>
a magic weapon.  I wouldn&#39;t want to go against one of those guys without <br/>
anything but my hardest hitting weapon.  I think I started seeing a lot of <br/>
them around level 16 or so.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I never even bought the weapon summoning spells because I had my <br/>
combine by then, could never keep my 1-H blunt trained up, and would do more <br/>
damage with my magic sword anyway.  I have not missed those spells.  I <br/>
always have backup weapons in the bank for when I die and lately (level 20) <br/>
often have a magic backup weapon tucked away.<br/>

&gt;I use a minotaur axe/targ shield combo 99% of the time, but should I need <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;attack or defend against a creature only hit by magic weapons then I haul <br/>
&gt;out<br/>
&gt;my trusty staff or dagger (fang?) summoned by a friendly magician and <br/>
&gt;commence<br/>
&gt;wacking the baddie.  It would be nice to have the combine longsword or some<br/>
&gt;other decent magical weapon, but I&#39;m still about 50 platinum short, what <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;having to buy armor, arrows, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The staff is nice - dmg 8, delay 40? - and my skill is going steadily up in <br/>
&gt;2H<br/>
&gt;blunt.  The summoned dagger is decent as well (dmg 4, delay 21?) but <br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t do<br/>
&gt;nearly enough damage when hunting wisps or scarecrows. I&#39;m also working on<br/>
&gt;pushing 1H blunt up for when I can summon the mace in four levels.  If I<br/>
&gt;*really* want to, I could go punish bandits with a wizard friend in the <br/>
&gt;karanas<br/>
&gt;and have that combine longsword in a week.  The thing is, I don&#39;t usually <br/>
&gt;hunt<br/>
&gt;for creatures hit by magic only because there&#39;s so many critters running <br/>
&gt;round<br/>
&gt;that don&#39;t have that limitation!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So here&#39;s a question for you higher-level paladins (16th and over) - at <br/>
&gt;what<br/>
&gt;level does it become necessary to have a magic weapon, and can the <br/>
&gt;situations<br/>
&gt;that require a magic weapon be handled by our summoned mace?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Kaladin, the curious 11th level Paladin<br/>
