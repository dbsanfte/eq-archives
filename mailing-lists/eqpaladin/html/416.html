<div id="ygrps-yiv-422933185">It is nice to use on creatures running away from you, especially if you are<br/>
encumbered and you don&#39;t have your root spell yet.  It is also a nice<br/>
alternative for drawing creatures to you from groups instead of using flash<br/>
of light.  Sometimes using magic can excite an entire group of creatures,<br/>
but one arrow won&#39;t excite as many of them to attack.  It may not be<br/>
authentic, but I am trying to practice the skill.  Just wish they would have<br/>
given us the tiny dagger option to practice with.  I will be sending<br/>
feedback on that to the gm&#39;s.<br/>

Paladin, well Knights do use Archery in ancient times but in the form of <br/>
crossbow strapped to their plate vambrace. It let them to take out other <br/>
ranged enemies while charging forward on horse. However the most commonly <br/>
used range weapon for knights were throwing lances which i do not think<br/>
exist <br/>
