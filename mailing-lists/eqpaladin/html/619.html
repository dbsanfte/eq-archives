<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393110183">Another sword that has to be considered is the bone bladed claymore.  If you<br/>
can put up with your agility being knocked down, it is lighter than the<br/>
shiny brass halberd which for some of us is of more importance.<br/>
<br/>
Note, that the Obsidian Flamberge is usable by Paladins.  This would make a<br/>
good low to high 20&#39;s two handed sword.  As to letting one skill drop in<br/>
favor of the other.<br/>
<br/>
I carry both serrated bone blade 1h slash with characteristics similar to<br/>
the combine long sword, and shield.  Plus a bone bladed claymore.  You<br/>
cannot beat the damage the 2 handed sword does, especially if you can find a<br/>
caster that can quicken you.<br/>
<br/>
The one handed slash and shield is a great alternative if fighting casters.<br/>
You need the speed and hits to interrupt their spells.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck brothers<br/>
