<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291297380">I agree wholeheartedly with my stout brother Perry.  The blackened iron<br/>
bastard sword is an outstanding weapon.  I could easily see myself using it<br/>
for a great many levels to come.  Prior to that (from 21st to 25th level) I<br/>
used the shiny brass halberd because the -8 agility caused by the bone<br/>
bladed claymore really did seem to make a big difference to my staying power<br/>
in a fight.  I did become fatigued much more quickly when wielding the<br/>
halberd, but I would rather be tired and alive than clumsy and dead ; )<br/>

Peace favor your sword,<br/>
