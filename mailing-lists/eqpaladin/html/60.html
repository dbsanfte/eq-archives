<div id="ygrps-yiv-451454879">*Thanks for the info. I once saw a screenshot of Aradune wearing full <br/>
*green plate and the 2 handed Fiery Avenger. Is that an only paladin <br/>
*weapon, because I heard that when they tested it in the Beta, many <br/>
*classes could use it.<br/>
<br/>
Aye, up til that final battle of Mithaniel Marr and Innoruuk at the end of<br/>
Phase4, I had always heard that the Fiery Avenger was a Paladin-only weapon,<br/>
and that Aradune had one even as a Ranger simply because he is Aradune.<br/>
After Mithaniel fell, several screenshots substantiate that the Fiery<br/>
Avenger could be used by any class.  What is unclear to me and to most<br/>
everyone I know is whether or not that Fiery Avenger being able to be used<br/>
by anyone was a special one just for that battle? Or if that was the rule<br/>
for all swords of that type.   <br/>
