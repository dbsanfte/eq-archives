&gt;Hail<br/>
&gt;I am not sure how many want to read this but this is a spoiler so stop<br/>
&gt;reading if you want to figure it out on your own.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This quest is given by Lord Jekle (I am at work and don&#39;t remember the name<br/>
&gt;exactly) and he asks if you wish to assist the defenders. If you so agree<br/>
 </span></blockquote>he<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;tells you to bring him an orc oracle scroll. These scrolls are only found<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;oracles that spawn in and near the orc castle in crushbone (I have never<br/>
&gt;witnessed nor heard of one spawning in the village).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Problems:<br/>
&gt;1) These oracles in crushbone are incredibly difficult to kill and should<br/>
&gt;only be attempted at lvl 10 plus<br/>
&gt;2) Most often you will have to engage the oracle as well as several<br/>
&gt;legionnaires and many of the other castle inhabitants (Royal Guards,<br/>
&gt;Prophet, Emissary, Emperor Crush and don&#39;t forget Dvinn)...All of which are<br/>
&gt;incredibly difficult to defeat and I have only seen players defeat Dvinn<br/>
&gt;once and heard of another time but never solo.<br/>
&gt;3) The reward from this quest was roughly 12 silver and some exp (not a<br/>
&gt;noticeable gain at lvl 11)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Notes:<br/>
&gt;After returning the scroll and completing the quest he did say that it was<br/>
&gt;too bad I wasn&#39;t a defender. Not sure what was meant by that. All in all I<br/>
&gt;would suggest that if you get a scroll while out adventuring you made 12<br/>
&gt;silver and a little exp but I would not go out of your way to complete this<br/>
&gt;quest.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;P.S. I have a character in Halas that I would like to relocate to freeport<br/>
&gt;and would appreciate any directions you could provide.<br/>
