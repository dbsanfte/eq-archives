<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365942021">I&#39;ll try to describe this without spoiling anyone&#39;s fun.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone finished Merko&#39;s paladin quest (in Freeport).  If you&#39;ve done<br/>
it, you&#39;ll know what I&#39;m talking about.  It involves Altunic, a shirt, a<br/>
venom sack, and a few other items.  At the end of all this, Merko tells you<br/>
to face a foe in the sewers.  It&#39;s a Militia guard.  If you defeat him,<br/>
Merko says he&#39;ll &quot;make you a knight&quot;, or something similar to that.<br/>
<br/>
My question is:  has anyone killed the guard and returned the token to<br/>
Merko?  The guard says that he is actually a she (and the daughter or<br/>
cousin of Merko)...I personally didn&#39;t kill her, and she ran away.  Now I<br/>
can&#39;t repeat the quest (Merko says it&#39;s something meant for lower knights<br/>
when I ask about it).  Just curious what happens in the end...(I mean, do<br/>
you actually get something, or just exp?  I&#39;ve never read anything anywhere<br/>
about this quest).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
<br/>
