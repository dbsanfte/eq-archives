<div id="ygrps-yiv-254010334">You are right, I petitioned the other day and was told that you have to<br/>
&quot;seed&quot; skills that you don&#39;t start with. These include the Taunt skill and<br/>
the magic skills (except Channeling, that one you should already know at<br/>
9th) Dodge, Bash, and others. You only need to put 1 point in to seed a<br/>
skill. After that, it will go up as you practice. In fact, at lvl 10 I<br/>
seeded my spell skills and discovered that they went up very quickly and<br/>
now, lvl 11 my Alteration skill is just as high as my 2 Hand Slash! (my<br/>
primary weapon skill)<br/>

&gt; One thing that I have noticed, (correct me if I am wrong), is that if I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t practiced at least one time with my Guildmaster on a type of spell<br/>
&gt; (abjuration for instance) my experience does not increase in that spell type<br/>
&gt; until I do.  So it may seem that you can&#39;t use a spell or that it is not<br/>
&gt; working well, but you need to practice it with the Guildmaster at least once<br/>
&gt; to kind of &quot;kick start&quot; the spell.  This is the way it has worked for me.<br/>
&gt; If anyone has any more information on practicing and spells, let me know.  I<br/>
&gt; am just about to go to level 11 and will be curious as to where to utilize<br/>
&gt; my practices.<br/>

&gt; I currently have a lvl 13 human paladin with 85 wisdom and have never had a<br/>
&gt; problem at all with casting my spells (except the ocassional fail) =).<br/>

&gt; &gt; I made a Paladin again last night, I had one that made it to level 5 then<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; deleted him because I couldn&#39;t make any exp, and I realized once I hit<br/>
&gt; level<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4 that I might not put enough points into Wisdom to be able to cast all<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; spells when I first get them.  I had this same problem with my SK where I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t able to cast 2 of my spells until level 11.  This was one of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; reasons why I quit playing him, the other because I like to explore and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; very difficult when you&#39;re a huge Troll.  So, I was wondering if 90 Wisdom<br/>
&gt; &gt; is enough to be able to cast all the spells when I get them.  I&#39;m really<br/>
&gt; &gt; afraid of playing this character up to level 50 and still not be able to<br/>
&gt; &gt; cast Revive(49) or something to that effect.  My race is a Dwarf if that<br/>
&gt; &gt; effects it. Thanks.<br/>
