<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893028967">It is conjuration for hammer of wrath, actually there are several hammers, <br/>
first is wrath, second one is striking and third is requitial from what i <br/>
have seen clerics get striking around 20 or close maybe late teens I forget <br/>
to relate that to paladins a lot of things clerics get we get like +10 lvls <br/>
later hehe, I can only assume later hammers are better delay attack power, <br/>
maybe even be able to give to party members but that is speculation I haven&#39;t <br/>
spoken to any clerics about this.<br/>
