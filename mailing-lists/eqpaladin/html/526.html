<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-845019542">This newsgroup has been kind of slow lately, and I am wondering what<br/>
everyones thoughts on geting ghoulsbane are, because you do have to kill a<br/>
fellow paladin to get it. Also has anyone here found any other piecec of<br/>
soulfire other than the hilt that is on the shadowknight in Mistmoore? Just<br/>
a few new topics to hopefully breathe some life into this group.<br/>
