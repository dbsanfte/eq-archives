&gt; This is to any low lvl paladin on the rathe server, I will pay 10 plat for<br/>
&gt; the first note that starts this quest. Being a High Elf, did not come to<br/>
&gt; freeport until about lvl 12. Also Sir would not work, because there are lady<br/>
&gt; Paladins too :P SO it would have to be either Sir or what ever would be the<br/>
&gt; proper termonology for a female paladin knight.<br/>
