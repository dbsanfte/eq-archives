<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370359044">Greetings fellow Paladins,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Valandil, a level 19 paladin hailing from the Karana server.<br/>
I am talking about the Freeport Hall of Truth quest where you have to go<br/>
kill militia guards and return their helms.  I was wondering when a<br/>
player would be able to do this, since they all con red to me and<br/>
haven&#39;t seen anyone else try.  Farewell noble warriors.<br/>
