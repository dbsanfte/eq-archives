<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573244127">what level were you when you took him out?<br/>
and is this the end of the two token quest?<br/>
<br/>
this has to be another quest item... but for what? Maybe you can petition a gm <br/>
and trade it to have Sir added to your name?<br/>

<br/>
The other day I was looking through my inventory when I came across something that baffles me. It is an icon with a <br/>
picture of a knight on it. When I inspect it it says KNIGHT and that all classes can have it and it weights 2.0. It doesn&#39;t <br/>
say that it is a lore item and it doesn&#39;t fit in any of my body inventory slots. Anyone have any idea as to what it is? I do <br/>
not remember anyone giving it to me. I have just finished taking out Byle Bundin but I don&#39;t remember having received <br/>
the knight when I completed this quest. I got a whole 8 silvers, oh boy. Thanks for any help.<br/>
