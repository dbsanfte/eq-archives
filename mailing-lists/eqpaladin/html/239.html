<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515475707"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Yup, I&#39;ve had bashing since 6th as well. I think that the sites on the net <br/>
&gt;just weren&#39;t updated, or they didn&#39;t notice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, they changed the level you get bash last week I think.<br/>
But I had to wait for my level 12 to have the practice points to learn it.<br/>
So, nothing really changed for me.<br/>
