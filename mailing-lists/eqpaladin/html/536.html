<div id="ygrps-yiv-971624791">Check out EQ&#39;Lizer.   They have posted a new item:  Short Sword of Yakesha.<br/>
Extremely nice sword, probably as powerful as some of the Holy Swords.   This is<br/>
not a quest item.  It is just on a rare spawn at an unknown location.<br/>
<br/>
My personal feelings about the Holy Swords is that Verant should send us a free<br/>
coupon for Vasaline<br/>
for even attempting to acquire a Holy Sword.  No other weapons that are<br/>
available to other classes are<br/>
as difficult to get.  They should make a new lower level Holy Sword for us just<br/>
to keep us equal to the<br/>
other classes.  For example, Soulfire, I would assume this is a &quot;lower&quot; level<br/>
holy sword.  I could not start<br/>
the quest at level 18.  What a joke!  The SK that has the Hilt is level 40+ in<br/>
Mistmoore and they won&#39;t let<br/>
me start the quest at level 18?   Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
I am starting to believe that Brad McQuaid and Verant are just playing with us<br/>
Paladins.  Pretending that<br/>
we are one of the best classes and have the ability at obtaining the most<br/>
powerful weapons in the game<br/>
 -- SO FAR THEY DON&#39;T EXIST.  Every damn Holy Sword known is on a mob or<br/>
creature level 30+.   For<br/>
instance Ghoulbane:  You have to kill a Holy Knight to get a Holy Sword.   Isn&#39;t<br/>
 killing a Paladin the<br/>
opposite of being a Paladin (aka ShadowKnight)?  Then there is another Holy<br/>
Sword (don&#39;t know the<br/>
name) is on a 40+ SK in the underground of Freeport.  BTW, it has 2 high level<br/>
mobs protecting it also.<br/>
The stats on that sword are not too impressive either.<br/>
<br/>
I just want to thank Brad McQuaid and the Verant staff for putting these<br/>
ludicrous ideas in our heads for<br/>
obtaining class specific weapons that either do not exist or are too difficult<br/>
to obtain it makes it almost not<br/>
worth it.  And, by the time we can acquire them, they are of little improvement<br/>
to us because of the level we<br/>
must be at to obtain them.<br/>
<br/>
Final thoughts:  Maybe to help us Paladins, Verant should not give us a 25% EXP<br/>
penalty, rather give us<br/>
a 25% bonus for being stupid enough in believing the Holy Swords are special.<br/>
The only thing so<br/>
special about them is that we can&#39;t attain them.  When do Paladins become<br/>
equals-- in the planes?<br/>
<br/>

My 2 cp for ranting and raving purposes only.</div>
