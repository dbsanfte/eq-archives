<b>Subject:</b> reef sharks <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050385029">I am a level 8 paladin, and the only quest that I have attempted from the Guild instructors wanted me to kill some reef sharks and bring back the skins.  I can&#39;t find the reef sharks in the Ocean of Tears anywhere.  I have found one hammerhead shark and killed it but didn&#39;t get a skin.  Any idea where to find &quot;reef sharks&quot;???  Just a hint would be great!  Thanks for your help.<br/>
