<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931704268">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
     Im trying to organzie a slaughter of the Goboos that have been plauging<br/>
Rivervale for some years now on the Server of Veeshan. Runnyeye Dungeon<br/>
ranges in levels from 5-35. So this event will be a benefit for all<br/>
involved. There is no date set as of yet. This will be one of the first of<br/>
many events to come on the Veeshan server. Here is a list of what we will<br/>
need in order to get this underway, and I will happy to organize it and<br/>
accept any help in doing so...<br/>
<br/>
   -1- Players, its obvious, we need people interested in Clearing out all<br/>
the Goblins and other dark monsters that lurk in Runnyeye.<br/>
   -2- An experienced guide who knowsALL of Runnyeye. I have not gone deep,<br/>
but i know there are some out there who have.<br/>
   -3- Binders to bind players to Rivervale for the event. <br/>
   -4- Maybe a dontaion booth to collect tarnished and bronze weapons as<br/>
well as leather armor to hook up players who are in need.<br/>
   -5- Buffers, to boost up the weaker characters.<br/>
   <br/>
  Right now thats all I can see that is needed right now. If you are<br/>
interested, email me and I will get a NEWS section put up on EQ VAULT. I<br/>
have had a few responses so far and it looks like this could work. This will<br/>
be the first of many events on Veeshan and I hope all the players can help<br/>
me make this happen. This will happen on a weekend, I work during the week<br/>
as does most of the world, and a weekend afternoon is best, probably 12 Noon<br/>
EST on a SAT or SUN. But, this is open to change.<br/>
