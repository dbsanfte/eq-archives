&gt; *Hello,<br/>
&gt; *I&#39;m a sixth level Paladin running solo around Freeport.  Can <br/>
&gt; *anybody tell<br/>
&gt; *me where you get the Minotaur Axes I keep hearing about?  With <br/>
&gt; *my limited<br/>
&gt; *funds, it seems like I&#39;ll be stuck with a rusty scimitar or <br/>
&gt; *sword for life!<br/>
&gt; * Thanks!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The easier minotaurs are in the minotaur caves in the Steamfont zone, which<br/>
&gt; is on the other continent, Faydwer.  But, they aren&#39;t &quot;easy&quot; by any means at<br/>
&gt; 6th level; I wouldn&#39;t try them solo.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There used to be lesser minotaurs in Beholder, a.k.a. the Gorge of Grobb,<br/>
&gt; over by Runnyeye and Misty Thicket, by Rivervale, but now I hear there are<br/>
&gt; only those very tough minotaurs :(<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most Mino Axes run about 4pp in the Kelethin/Steamfont area, as stated above<br/>
they are from the Mino Caves in Steamfont, if you want to get one the cheap<br/>
way i.e. go kill a Mino yourself I must stress the need for a group, as well<br/>
a Cleric would be important mainly for their cure disease.  In Steamfont<br/>
there are diseased rats that LOVE to attack you when your in combat with<br/>
something else, this rat Disease lasts for about 30 mins (REAL TIME) and<br/>
during that time you will be realy hurting for HP&#39;s as I understand it you<br/>
won&#39;t regen HP during combat while diseased, and your max HP is choped, so<br/>
even when you heal your still in bad shape... The Rats are passive until<br/>
your fighting something else then they will join in.  Another thing to worry<br/>
about is the Mino Hero who will just come out every once and a while to kill<br/>
anyone in sight :) he will KOS and I have watched him take out the Gnome<br/>
guards so at level 6, RUN if you hear of him being out in your area, or if<br/>
you see him.<br/>
<br/>
I just ran through Beholder Maze last night on my way to quenos, I am a<br/>
level 11 High Elf Paladin, there were many Cavern Mino&#39;s walking around <br/>
they coned QUITE RED to me... so you would best avoid them unless your in a<br/>
Major group.<br/>
