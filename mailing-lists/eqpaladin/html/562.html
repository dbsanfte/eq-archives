<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360439288">He only spawns at certain times of day and not long then.  When he does <br/>
spawn you have to act fast before he leaves.   I&#39;ve had my best luck around <br/>
6-7 in the morning.  If he hasn&#39;t spawned by about 8:00 I find something <br/>
else to do until the next morning.  I&#39;ve gotten four blankets from him of <br/>
which 3 were before the solution was posted for the world to see.<br/>

&gt;I am in the part of the quest where I am supposed to meet Tykar Renlin<br/>
&gt;in the Seafarers Roost inn, but I have searched it thouroughly and he<br/>
&gt;was not there, does he only come at a certain time or do I need to do<br/>
&gt;something to make him come?<br/>
&gt;Also my faction with the innkeepers is so that I cannot trade with them,<br/>
&gt;I am KOS by freeport militia aswell, and this has REALLY made the quest<br/>
&gt;hard to do, I don&#39;t even want to think about how I am supposed to get<br/>
&gt;into the dungeon and meet Zimel hehe. But I guess this is all easy<br/>
&gt;compared to the other two pieces of the quest heh..<br/>
