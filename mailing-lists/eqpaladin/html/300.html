<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563889835">I&#39;m on the Xegony server (High Elf Paladin, level 14). I have a question<br/>
that maybe you can help me with. I have been traveling through Antonica<br/>
lately, but have not yet been to Ro. Since the Eldarr Woods used to occupy<br/>
that land before Solusek destroyed it, I am wondering if there are any<br/>
remnants of the Elvish Empire. any information would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

&quot;By G&#39;Quon, I cannot remember the last time I was in a fight like that! No<br/>
moral ambiguity. No ancient and overpowering Enemy. They were, as you say,<br/>
the Bad Guys, and we were the Good Guys....and they made a very satisfying<br/>
*thump* when they hit the ground!&quot;<br/>
