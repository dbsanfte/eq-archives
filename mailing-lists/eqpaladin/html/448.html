<div id="ygrps-yiv-853275753">While speaking with brother Estle, he speaks of a blessed oil which Priestess Jahnda(not sure of spelling at this time). I found her in the Temple of Life but do you think she was gunna give me that oil?. I asked her every which way and she still wouldn&#39;t give up the goods. I am not loking for a spoiler just trying to find out if I am barking up the wrong tree.<br/>
