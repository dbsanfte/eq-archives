<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083413735">You need to do the phirana quest  to get them to recharge it for you (at <br/>
least that&#39;s what I heard). Oh and don&#39;t worry, even after you give someone a <br/>
ring you can still get another one from budo as many times as you want.<br/>
<br/>
To do the phirana quest talk to Fiddy and he&#39;ll say he&#39;s upset, then talk to <br/>
Marshal Lanena and she&#39;ll send you to help him. Give the first pirana teeth <br/>
to her and the rest to Fiddy.</div>
