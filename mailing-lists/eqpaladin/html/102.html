<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-51937861"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I have set up hot buttons for lots of different commands, but do not know<br/>
&gt;how to set them up for saying stuff like &quot;help!&quot; and such.  How does one do<br/>
&gt;this?  Also, thanks to the tips about the muffins, should save me some<br/>
&gt;money.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Go under socials and right click on any button you don&#39;t think you&#39;ll need,<br/>
such as consider (which is more easily done by hitting C anyway).  You&#39;ll<br/>
be able to configure your macro simply by typing in the box on the center<br/>
of the screen.  Start with /say and then your messsage.  Don&#39;t forget to<br/>
rename your button, which you can do by clicking in the box at the top of<br/>
the screen with the current button name on it.  Click done when you&#39;ve put<br/>
in the text you want and renamed the button.  I suggest dragging it to a<br/>
hot button spot so that it&#39;s easy to get to after that.<br/>
