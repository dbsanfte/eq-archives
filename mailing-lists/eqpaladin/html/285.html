<div id="ygrps-yiv-556294273">A friend of mine got a playing card (I think that&#39;s what the knight is).<br/>
He found it and picked it up.  Another member of our group noticed a<br/>
guard had walked by and said &quot;oops, looks like I dropped something...&quot;.<br/>
I think the quest might be to return the card to the guy who dropped it.<br/>
In our case, we were in the Qeynos hills I believe.<br/>

return.<br/>
<br/>
What is the two token quest?<br/>
<br/>
Will a gm help you with a question about an item? I thought they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
