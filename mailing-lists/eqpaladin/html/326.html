 </span></blockquote>This is an excellent question which I&#39;d be interested in hearing about as well.  I have no other information as of yet, but will share with group when I do.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I don&#39;t think people realize (especially if it&#39;s crowded and there&#39;s lots going on) that we just saved their lives -- all they know is they were as good as dead, then they&#39;re fully healed.  Next thing you know, the crowd has scattered to the four winds and it&#39;s running hot and cold gnolls (and that LoH ain&#39;t coming back anytime soon...)<br/>
It&#39;s different in a group situation, because my group knows who just pulled their fat out of the fryer, and they will generally show their appreciation with &quot;Thanks&quot; and &quot;pats on back&quot;, and absolutely _WILL NOT_ abandon me.  It&#39;s a nice feeling to be that appreciated, and a huge part of why I&#39;m a paladin in Norrath in the first place!<br/>

&gt; I would have to agree with the attitude of most people when a &quot;Holy Knight&quot; comes to the rescue (more often to our folly as the &quot;rescuees&quot; run and the &quot;rescuer&quot; gets stuck with the fiends) and either lays hands or heals to the end of mana, as being less than satisfying.  I however, feel like I helped someone, albeit most likely someone who will watch me die in the future and not lift a finger to help.  I think my chances are a bit better for someone to help me if I help others and not watch another die while not even trying to help.  Also from a role-playing aspect, I do believe the right thing is being done, never would a Paladin turn his head to such persons in distress.<br/>
