If you have an ability (not only on spells) from level 1, it can increase by<br/>
itself. When you have a new ability, you must spend at least one practice<br/>
point to learn it. And your guildmaster says &quot;You have learnt the basics<br/>
of...&quot;. It seems that you then have a base that equals to your level. THEN<br/>
it can increase by itself. But it sometimes depends of the ability. For<br/>
example, some people think that Safe Fall for the monk never increases<br/>
except with practive points.<br/>

One thing that I have noticed, (correct me if I am wrong), is that if I<br/>
haven&#39;t practiced at least one time with my Guildmaster on a type of spell<br/>
(abjuration for instance) my experience does not increase in that spell type<br/>
until I do.  So it may seem that you can&#39;t use a spell or that it is not<br/>
working well, but you need to practice it with the Guildmaster at least once<br/>
to kind of &quot;kick start&quot; the spell.  This is the way it has worked for me.<br/>
If anyone has any more information on practicing and spells, let me know.  I<br/>
am just about to go to level 11 and will be curious as to where to utilize<br/>
my practices.<br/>
