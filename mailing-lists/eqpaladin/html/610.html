<b>Subject:</b> Re: taking the ghoulbane plunge <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026365737">Here&#39;s a question for those who have retrieved the Ghoulbane holy sword:<br/>
<br/>
My Paladin is 17th level, and one of the recent posts suggested that I<br/>
should be using a Shiny Brass Halberd as my primary weapon at this<br/>
point. I&#39;m thinking that Ghoulbane would make a better primary weapon,<br/>
since all that&#39;s required is to head into Froglock central and wipe out<br/>
a fellow Froggie Paladin. I have a 35th level Magician and 35th level<br/>
Druid who could help in this quest, as well as a 20th level Wizard and a<br/>
19th level Cleric. Would my party of 5 stand a chance?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Kaladin, 17th level Paladin of Tunare<br/>
