&gt; situations that require a magic weapon be handled by<br/>
&gt; our summoned mace?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I got my shiny brass shield at 16th, and my combine<br/>
longsword at 18th (I&#39;m 19th in Unrest now); for two<br/>
main reasons.  One, I have determined the mino axe<br/>
isn&#39;t really the weapon it&#39;s cracked up to be.  Two, I<br/>
was tired of having to run from ghouls that were blue<br/>
to me simply because I couldn&#39;t hurt them.<br/>
<br/>
Newly armed with my enchanted arsenal, I took my<br/>
wizard and myself to Unrest and have since comenced to<br/>
group with others to beat back the hordes of undead<br/>
that spawn from the depths of the evil that is the<br/>
Estate of Unrest.  And I&#39;ll tell you, it&#39;s a lot of<br/>
fun to fight with every shot going off while around me<br/>
dual wielding warriors and rangers, and other<br/>
paladins, are hitting with their offhands, or kicking<br/>
or bashing, for INVULNERABLE results.<br/>
<br/>
One more level and I get Double Attack.<br/>
<br/>
As for the summone 1hb, if it&#39;s all you have, sure. <br/>
If you have kept 1hb capped (I haven&#39;t, it&#39;s around 25<br/>
or so).  The weapon&#39;s also not a very effective one,<br/>
poor ratio as I recall.<br/>
