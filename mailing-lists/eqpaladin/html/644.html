Topic: Protest from Paladins over neglect.<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
It appears that Verant wants to trim down the number of classes in light of<br/>
the recent treatment of Paladins. The Shadowknight and Rogue classes have all<br/>
but disappeared due to similar circumstances. In a post on this forum, a<br/>
petition was circulated that detailed changes that would bring the paladin<br/>
back as a viable character after months of neglect by the programming team.<br/>
In a few short hours, the number of &quot;aye&quot; respondants to the petition reached<br/>
over 250. Then the server crashed. Now the post and its results are gone.<br/>
Soon the petition will be reposted and the process will start again.<br/>
<br/>
After the recent upgrade to the Ranger, Paladins were certain that they were<br/>
next for enhancement. We waited patiently for the patch that was supposed to<br/>
be our salvation. Instead, what we received was armor quests that were 10<br/>
times the length and 5 times more costly than any of the quest of any other<br/>
class. And for all of that the armor stinks. Class specific plate armor for<br/>
the Paladin has less AC than that of the chain worn by the ranger. Paladins<br/>
are the &quot;Holy Knight&quot; counterpart to the ranger. Yet, with the last 3<br/>
patches, the Ranger has been augmented so that he has more AC even though he<br/>
can wear no platemail. He also has higher skill caps, does nearly twice the<br/>
damage in battle, has spell equivalents to most of the Paladins spells yet<br/>
not confined to undead. Ensnare is far more effective that root. Several<br/>
other spells and buffs of the druid class aren&#39;t nerfed , level wise, as with<br/>
the paladin. The ranger can track. Whereas the paladin can point himself in<br/>
the direction of the nearest undead, unless of course if there is a pet in<br/>
the area. Now to the arguements.<br/>
<br/>
Paladins have a unique skill called Lay Hands. However, at higher levels, it<br/>
is simply an extra superior heal. In practice, it is simply a method, once<br/>
per hour and a half, to be able to solo a creature that would be of little<br/>
difficulty to any other class of the same lvl. I don&#39;t discount the benifit<br/>
of Lay Hands. I only say that, to the Paladin, it is not sufficient<br/>
justification for nerfing our class as the ignorant and uninformed think.<br/>
<br/>
Lets move to a discussion of weaponry. Ghoulsbane is indeed a prize. At lvl<br/>
30 it is obtainable...er... was... not sure if the Shin Lord spawns there<br/>
anymore. It is supposed to be made No Drop. Ive seen nothing on this yet.<br/>
In any case, the damage of the GB is unacceptable at higher levels. It<br/>
is too slow to interrupt a caster and the proc is only usefull against...<br/>
again...undead. People pass around the name soulfire as though it were a<br/>
rusty short sword laying around simply waiting to be picked up. Aside from<br/>
being , perhaps, the most lengthy and involved quest in the game, it also<br/>
requires Killing Sir Lucan and a named SK in MM. From what I am told, it<br/>
takes at least 2 groups of lvl 40ish to take down Lucan in the midst of the<br/>
militia held West Freeport. The Sword, while nice, is not the &quot;ultimate<br/>
weapon&quot; that the ignorant and uninformed think.<br/>
<br/>
There are many areas which we could discuss the imbalances. I am cognizant of<br/>
the &quot;grass is greener&quot; excuse foistered by Brad. It simply doesn&#39;t hold water.<br/>
If the game has changed with the latest patch, and people rarely have the<br/>
patience to take a paladin beyond lvl 30, where are his figures? Please post<br/>
them. Oh... I&#39;ll probably pull my lvl 31 paladin out of the closet and dust<br/>
him off occasionally. But, I think I&#39;ll focus more on my ranger from now on.<br/>
I liked the mystique of the paladin and am disappointed in the loss of the<br/>
many hours I could have spent on a character not crippled by the biases of<br/>
the games creator. I did have fun and met many good folk that I will rejoin<br/>
when I reach their level again. I simply like the competitive side of things<br/>
as well. I can powerlevel with the best, but I enjoy travelling, questing,<br/>
and adventure also. <br/>

Topic: Alexiran Bladedancer&#39;s Paladin Petition!!<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Greetings Fellow Travelers of Norrath, <br/>
Prelude: <br/>
<br/>
What I bring before you today is not a flame, nor is it a &quot;grass is greener&quot;<br/>
whine. It is righteous indignation and anger. Before going into the actual<br/>
petition I will give a bit of background information. If you wish to skip<br/>
this and go straight to the petition it is indexed by a &quot;**&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;**&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Background: <br/>
<br/>
Verant recently implemented class specific armor quests. Even when these<br/>
quests were still rumors I rejoiced at the opportunity to quest for my armor<br/>
instead of camping. What has transpired upon full implementation of this<br/>
quest is an insult to every Paladin in Norrath. The difficulty of our quests<br/>
is without peer. Yet I remained calm while others flamed since I assumed<br/>
that, in the end, our armor would be worth it. I envisioned a holy knight<br/>
clad in armor blessed by the gods outshining even a warrior. As the cold,<br/>
hard numbers roll in it is as if we are the victims of a cruel joke. <br/>
<br/>
**&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;** Petition <br/>
<br/>
I propose that the stats of the &quot;Armor of Ro&quot; are increased in proportion to<br/>
the difficulty of the quests. In addition I propose that Verant take a very<br/>
close look at the stats of the Shadowknight armor as well. As always it seems<br/>
as if our evil twins share in our troubles. <br/>
<br/>
For example: The current Greaves of Ro are AC 11 sta 6 sv cold 10 <br/>
The new Greaves of Ro AC 14 dex 8 sv cold 10 <br/>
<br/>
Rationale: I have stated that the difficulty of our quests is without peer.<br/>
I invite any citizen of Norrath to view the details at either<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/">http://everquest.gamestats.com/</a> or <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gameznet.com/eq/.">http://gameznet.com/eq/.</a> In addition I<br/>
will briefly describe them here.<br/>
<br/>
Each church in Norrath controls the mold to a piece of armor (there are 7).<br/>
A paladin must raise his/her faction with the appropriate church to get the<br/>
quest. Then he/she must hunt a rare NPC for an item that is turned in for<br/>
the mold. Then the paladin must raise faction again with the Temple of<br/>
Solusek Ro to obtain a cauldron from Lord Seafire. In this cauldron you are<br/>
to place 4 more rare items and 2 bars of enchanted platinum. If you are a<br/>
Master Blacksmith these items will combine to make a bar of &quot;Ronium&quot;. Then,<br/>
despite false information from Lord Seafire, you place the bar of Ronium and<br/>
and the mold into a forge and hit &quot;combine&quot;. Once again, if you are a Master<br/>
Blacksmith, the items will hopefully combine into the armor.<br/>
<br/>
*Note* Several of the items required for this are No-Drop so you CANNOT have<br/>
a professional Blacksmith do this for you. The Paladin MUST become a master<br/>
himself. <br/>
<br/>
Despite this difficulty the stats on our &quot;Armor of Ro&quot; are pathetic. A<br/>
ranger, who supposedly sacrifices AC for agility and duel wield HAS HIGHER AC<br/>
QUEST ARMOR THAN PALADINS. EVEN a Shaman, who is not even a tank, has higher<br/>
AC armor in the greaves than Paladins/SK&#39;s. Also, for some bizzare reason,<br/>
bards have better armor than all three of us. I&#39;d love Verant to explain the<br/>
logic of that but I digress.<br/>
<br/>
Precendent: The stats of the Warrior crafted armor were adjusted to make them<br/>
competitive with the quest armors. The Paladin armor can easily be adjusted<br/>
to also make them competitive and worth the effort.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion: Please show your support of this petition in the form of a reply<br/>
with a simple &quot;yes&quot;. I invite other classes to study the issue and ask high<br/>
level Paladins about it.<br/>
<br/>
As a Paladin I try to humbly serve other citizens. So I make this request not<br/>
for myself but for the younger paladins who should have real rewards to look<br/>
forward to.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your time.<br/>
<br/>
