<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426109864">Regarding Tynkale&#39;s Quests, you usually get a rusty haliberd from the first<br/>
(Tandan Nybright or the Drunkard quest) Supposadly if you are lucky you can<br/>
get a magic haili, but I think it is just a rumor, To complete that Quest go<br/>
to the Nybright Sisters&#39;s camp in Lesser Faydark, get a necklace from each<br/>
of the sisters, and yes it does matter which one you get it from, for you<br/>
can only get one from each. Take them back to the Drunkard and he gives you<br/>
the Hally.<br/>
<br/>
Also welcome again to the mailing list, when I logged on to check my mail<br/>
today i was shocked at all the subscriptions. If anyone has any information<br/>
on the Holy Swords, A paladin&#39;s best friend, Please share it with us all :)<br/>
