&gt; *Do you all<br/>
&gt; *just walk the land? Selling and buying from Innkeepers?<br/>
&gt; *Anyway...  I also really hate it when I use LOH on the MOB I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; *trying to<br/>
&gt; *kill....  It never seems to appreciate it.<br/>
&gt; *<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; /smile Aye, I remember the early days of a Paladin&#39;s road.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And yes, unless I have a high level druid or wizard friend do a group<br/>
&gt; transport, I am running the land.  But!  The peril you encounter along the<br/>
&gt; way!  The friends you make and the enemies you earn!  Much more exciting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And yes, after a long hiatus from my Paladin, I made the newbie<br/>
&gt; (no offense)<br/>
&gt; mistake of hitting LOH when the monster was still targeted.  My solution<br/>
&gt; (works for me, at least) is that I moved the hotbutton from the first bank<br/>
&gt; of buttons with my combat buttons to the second one, so that when<br/>
&gt; I think to<br/>
&gt; change button banks I also think to change targets.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; May Tunare bless and keep you (and Erollisi Marr, although now in Final we<br/>
&gt; high elves aren&#39;t permitted to worship her as Paladins... *grumble*)<br/>
