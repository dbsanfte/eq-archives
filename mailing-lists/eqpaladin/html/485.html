Hey did you guys on the Cazik Thule server notice that the GMs took control <br/>
of the lizardmen in the Cazik Thule dungeon for 2 hours yesterday? They kept <br/>
speaking to me and right after I killed one another ran up and yelled, &quot;You <br/>
killed my brother! Take this!&quot;<br/>
Another said during the fight, &quot;Hhahah! You fight like a halfling!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The lizardmen were doing an organized attack which led me to believe they <br/>
were being controlled by an intelligent person and not the dumb AI. Plus they <br/>
kept saying the weirdest stuff at just the right moment (being attacked by a <br/>
barbarian, a lizard said &quot;Ooo... big barbarian man can&#39;t kill little lizard!&quot;)</div>
