At 12th you&#39;ll be fighting the &#39;yard trash&#39;.  Zoning<br/>
into Unrest, you follow the tunnel (it&#39;s a sewer like<br/>
tunnel, cool brickwork) and it opens out into a<br/>
grassed area with a front path that runs between a<br/>
pair of fountains/pools, then hedgemazes, then to the<br/>
front porch/door of the house.  If you cut left or<br/>
right, you can go between the hedge mazes and the wall<br/>
to reach either side of the yard.  Heading right<br/>
you&#39;ll find the gazebo; left you find the porch<br/>
entrance to the house, and both meet in the back at<br/>
the (oddly enough) back door.<br/>
<br/>
On the yard surrounding the house is the &#39;yard trash&#39;,<br/>
Death Beetles, Jack-o-Lanterns, the occasional ghoul,<br/>
Greater Skeletons and Tormented Undead; all in the<br/>
10-13 -ish- range.  Death Beetles will train onto you<br/>
if you&#39;re fighting undead, as will the other undead<br/>
near your fight if not otherwise occupied.  A full low<br/>
level group (your level) can do pretty well cleaning<br/>
up the yard trash if you play smart.  You&#39;ll also be<br/>
the love of the zone, as the higher levels get really<br/>
tired of pulling higher level stuff (20+ Lvl mobs<br/>
oftentimes) from the house and getting bogged down<br/>
with a handful of yard trash.<br/>
<br/>
At about 15-18 -ish-, in a full group, you can start<br/>
pulling from the first floor.  19-23 -ish-, in a full<br/>
group, you can pull from the 1st or 2nd floors (but<br/>
make better loot and xp from the 2nd)<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t fought the 3rd floor or basement yet, but I<br/>
understand about 24-28 -ish--, in a full group, can<br/>
fight the third floor stuff; and that 29-35 -ish-, in<br/>
a full group, can fight in the basement.  Beware the<br/>
Hag, uber nasty undead necromatic caster (with charm<br/>
and some really mean direct damage spells).<br/>
<br/>
Drybone Skeletons and above (Skeletal Monks, I think,<br/>
and Barbed Bone Skeletons) drop small bronze.  A lot<br/>
of things in the zone drop small rawhide and small<br/>
ringmail; and Carrion Ghouls and some other things<br/>
drop runes/words/pages, as well as Fine Steel weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Unrest isn&#39;t a terribly hard zone to find a group in;<br/>
though sometimes you may have to be patient for a<br/>
while.  DON&#39;T solo here, even 20th Levels can have<br/>
problems trying to solo yard trash because more keeps<br/>
jumping in the fights.  Fight at least in a pair, but<br/>
often you&#39;ll be in full groups, which is the only way<br/>
to fight Unrest.<br/>
<br/>
You can walk into the zone in full leather and be in<br/>
full metal (ring and/or bronze) after a few days;<br/>
longer for full bronze.  Most of the Unrest loot sells<br/>
pretty well in Butcherblock and Greater Faydark; how<br/>
else do you think low levels (sub 11 or so) get their<br/>
hands on rawhide and ringmail, and fine steel weapons?<br/>
 Also, if you&#39;re a sub level looking for rawhide, ring<br/>
or fine steel, take cash and head to Unrest; a lot of<br/>
players will be happy to unload the encumberance for<br/>
case right there.  You can get some good deals.<br/>
<br/>
The best part of Unrest is no annoying doors and keys<br/>
to deal with.  Befallen is seriously handicapped as a<br/>
fun zone because of the key thing.<br/>
