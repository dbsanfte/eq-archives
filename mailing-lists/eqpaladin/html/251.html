*mine. What red shield and where in Felwithe did you buy it? Thanks<br/>
<br/>
Aye, the shop directly in front of the bank entrance in Felwithe, which<br/>
sells weapons, chain and plate armor, and shields.  They have both &quot;medium&quot;<br/>
and &quot;small&quot; shields of that red wooden variety.  They have a wooden cross<br/>
section and 4 red plates basically.  It sounds odd but basically it is a<br/>
more colorful skin so to speak for the targ shield look.  <br/>
