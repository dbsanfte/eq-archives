I hope it helps.<br/>
<br/>
Your best bet if you can&#39;t start the quest is to ask a lower level Paladin<br/>
(under 9th) to get you the first note.<br/>

A call to arms for all Paladins!<br/>
<br/>
This message is for all Paladins of the Knights of Truth in Freeport. This is<br/>
a Quest update, and a call for support as well.<br/>
<br/>
The Test of Truth, a quest given by a Paladin behind the Hall of Truth, is<br/>
billed as one of the<br/>
most important quests in the game for a Paladin of that guild. This test,<br/>
however is rarely even<br/>
started on my server (Cazic-Thule) and on many others from the people I have<br/>
talked with. The<br/>
reason is the reward for the quest is not very well defined. First let me give<br/>
you some basic<br/>
information on the quest.<br/>
<br/>
     What you join the Knights of Truth Paladin guild in Freeport you are<br/>
welcomed warmly, but you are made well aware that you are NOT a Knight yet.<br/>
You start as a squire, and upon asking the Knights you will find that there is<br/>
one, and only one way to become a true Knight. And that is to complete the<br/>
Test of Truth. I won&#39;t spoil the entire quest, but it starts by bringing a<br/>
letter to Altunic Jartin, the roaming shield salesman in East Commonlands. The<br/>
quest is in two parts. At the completion of each part you receive a Token.<br/>
When you have both tokens you return them to the Knight who gave you the quest<br/>
and this starts the actual Test of Truth. All of this information is given to<br/>
you vaguely when you first ask about the quest.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that you cannot start this quest after 8th level!<br/>
Also, the quest is NOT BROKEN (it was fixed very soon after the release of the<br/>
game) but finding Altunic Jartin can be difficult as he moves around the zone.<br/>
<br/>
     Upon completion of the Test of Truth you are welcomed as a Knight and<br/>
given a note to prove  it. This is where I need the assistance of all Paladins<br/>
in the Realm.<br/>
<br/>
     Now that I (Vawhn on Cazic-Thule) have completed the quest and have<br/>
become a Knight, I<br/>
would expect to have a title to show it. I mean, I am a Knight, what else<br/>
(other than a holy sword and a trusty steed) could a Paladin ever want. But I<br/>
did not get a title. In fact, other than the note, which I keep safely locked<br/>
away in the bank, I have no proof that I am a Knight at all.<br/>
<br/>
     I have talked to a GM about this, and suggested that a Sir be added to<br/>
the beginning of my<br/>
name, or that be added to the end of my name (I preferred the Sir, and made<br/>
that fact clear) and the GM really liked the idea. He said he would bring it<br/>
up at their next meeting, and asked me to write a feedback detailing my<br/>
opinion and justification, which I did.<br/>
<br/>
     I ask all of you to do the same, if you support my suggestion of course.<br/>
My justification was<br/>
simple (although I welcome any differing opinions, as I am sure the GMs<br/>
would). I have two<br/>
reasons for this request. First, I play a Paladin because I am playing a RPG,<br/>
and I like to play the character (as much if not more than to have the<br/>
abilities). For my character, what better way to show that I am eternally<br/>
dedicated to my code than to have my title displayed in my name for all to<br/>
see. The second reasoning is that (according to the game itself) 50% of<br/>
Everquest is the questing, and I found this quest a little, ok VERY<br/>
disappointing. If a quest existed that could make such a permanent and<br/>
profound change to a young Paladin, it would improve the questing at least in<br/>
Freeport (which for those of you who don&#39;t take the quests, there is a very<br/>
good story going on there).<br/>
<br/>
     Again, if you support this idea, please send a feedback (In Game) with<br/>
your ideas and opinions.  The seed has already been planted, and Everquest<br/>
DOES LISTEN. I know this from personal experience. They just need to hear<br/>
about it from others, and hear about it often.<br/>
<br/>
     No you just need your Trusty Steed and your Holy Sword. Good luck on the<br/>
horse.<br/>
