<div id="ygrps-yiv-403201686">Hello all, I&#39;m a little late in responding to this message, but that&#39;s<br/>
because I was busy planning my wedding to fellow Paladin Yummy. We are<br/>
both on the Bertoxx server and we are pleased to announce that the wedding<br/>
was a resounding success! We even had a GM help some spectators get to the<br/>
island in the Ocean of Tears, then he stayed for the Ceremony! There will<br/>
be screenshots posted on our guild&#39;s web site at<br/>

Now to answer the question:<br/>
<br/>
	I chose a Paladin for many of the same reasons as the rest of you.<br/>
On reason is my fascination with the Knight of the Round Table and I<br/>
figured that an excellent representation would be a Paladin. I&#39;m<br/>
half-elven and enjoy the advantage of gettin along with Humans and elves.<br/>
I too play the hero and have sacraficed myself for companions numerous<br/>
times. (maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m still only lvl 12) But I enjoy helping those<br/>
in need and my gallant nature helps me make friends very easily.<br/>
<br/>
(By the way, On the Bertoxx server, you can buy a banded Tunic for 16pp!<br/>
Someone I met and helped out has been giving me even better prices than<br/>
that too!)<br/>
<br/>
I also enjoy being able to dish out damamge and laugh when Orc Legions<br/>
attack me (but I do warn everyone and fight delaying actions when out<br/>
numbered 3 to 1 or more, OUCH!) The magic is a nice touch, and I find it<br/>
amusing to see someone watching you get hit over and over, then heal right<br/>
back up again with LOH. They often times shake there head in wonder, then<br/>
compliment me on my prowess. It gives me a warm feeling inside. What can I<br/>
say, I enjoy being the envy of others.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway that&#39;s my dime<br/>

General Reppik, Clan Battlehammer<br/>
Paladin of the 12th order Of Erollisi Marr<br/>
