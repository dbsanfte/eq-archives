To be frank, I find my low strength of 85 a real pain.<br/>
<br/>
Consider a full suit of bronze plate, a shiny brass halberd, a lightstone (no weight) and 20 food and 20 water.  The weight of that is 83.<br/>
<br/>
That gives me a whopping 2 stones of carrying capacity.  That will last about 1 minute in Cazic Thule.<br/>
<br/>
The real test of strength is its impact on max damage at higher levels - is it worth it?  Is AGI or DEX better?<br/>
<br/>
My healing spells are useful if no cleric is on - I can get a small party together and we can cling on by our bootstraps for after battle healing, but the high mana doesn&#39;t help much since it&#39;s all post-battle and the high intelligence is overkill for skill gain - I max everything out by a third of the way into my first bubble each level.  And that&#39;s with skills in the 140s.<br/>
<br/>
But, as you say, the role playing potential is great.<br/>

	Could someone tell me the statistical benefit to being a high elf <br/>
paladin?  I don&#39;t mean the role-play benefits (yes I can also think of a few) <br/>
but the low strength and stamina seem like the exact opposite of what a <br/>
paladin would want.<br/>
