<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960096498">I am from the Povar shar... er... server, and the Shiny Brass Shield isn&#39;t<br/>
that big a deal.  Right now the &quot;in&quot;  thing to have is the Cracked Something<br/>
Something Shield off one of the named gnolls in High Pass Hold.  Of course,<br/>
that&#39;s where I&#39;ve been the past few days, so I can&#39;t be too sure.  It sells<br/>
for about 150pp. The other gnoll has the Polished Granite Tommahawk, which I<br/>
think blows chunks (I just got one), but I&#39;ve seen it go for 600pp.  The<br/>
other is the Shiny Brass Halberd, which is what I&#39;m using now until I get<br/>
the BBC.  Most people get them to sell now though.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is on the Povar server, feel free to give me a tell.  I just got<br/>
level 20, so hopefully I can get my last name soon.  Right now I&#39;m in<br/>
Befallen cleaning house and taking revenge for what the place did to be in<br/>
the earlier levels.<br/>
<br/>
What is the Povar server?  Never heard of it.<br/>
<br/>
Heh.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; To answer a few questions first:<br/>
&gt; I play on the Rathe server as a humble Dwarf Paladin named &quot;Dauldon<br/>
Blackstone&quot;<br/>
&gt; I was wondering about the list myself, glad to see it is still here.<br/>
&gt; I have not seen any remnants of the Elven empire in the deserts of Ro.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A question:<br/>
&gt; I am not certain how the other servers operate, however on Rathe, it seems<br/>
that a shiny brass shield is now one of the more rare items in the game.  I<br/>
have seen one being sold for as high as 100 platinum (ouch).  The area that<br/>
spawns the creature that occasionally has the shield, is always camped, no<br/>
matter the time of day I try.  A magic shield, as you all know, is a nice<br/>
benefit to have with the bashing ability, to be able to hit creatures that<br/>
need magic to cause damage against them.  Let me get to the question before<br/>
I get to far off here.<br/>
&gt; Are there other magic shields that we as Paladins can use?<br/>
&gt; If so, would you mind sharing the information.  It does not have to be<br/>
very specific, just a hint or twelve &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also to comment on something else I read in one of the mails...<br/>
&gt; I would have to agree with the attitude of most people when a &quot;Holy<br/>
Knight&quot; comes to the rescue (more often to our folly as the &quot;rescuees&quot; run<br/>
and the &quot;rescuer&quot; gets stuck with the fiends) and either lays hands or heals<br/>
to the end of mana, as being less than satisfying.  I however, feel like I<br/>
helped someone, albeit most likely someone who will watch me die in the<br/>
future and not lift a finger to help.  I think my chances are a bit better<br/>
for someone to help me if I help others and not watch another die while not<br/>
even trying to help.  Also from a role-playing aspect, I do believe the<br/>
right thing is being done, never would a Paladin turn his head to such<br/>
persons in distress.<br/>
