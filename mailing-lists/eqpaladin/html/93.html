<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207250554">I&#39;ve recently come over to Freeport from Kaladim and am interested in obtaining some quests from the local Paladin&#39;s guild. Even though I am a 10th level paladin I keep getting told that I must prove myself or somesuch. What specific enemies do I need to vanquish in order to find worth in the eyes of the Hall of Truth? Any help will be greatly appreciated.<br/>
