<b>Subject:</b> Qeynos trainer location & armor tailored free! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588357667">I&#39;m playing a 6th level Dwarven Paladin named Kaladin (stop that snickering!<br/>
It was randomly generated! LOL!)  and I&#39;m currently playing in the Qeynos<br/>
area.  It turns out there ARE trainers for us in Qeynos - it took me a while<br/>
to find them - they are thru the passageway to the right of the arena<br/>
entrance.  Also, if you see I&#39;m on in the game (/who kaladin all) I&#39;d be<br/>
glad to tailor up some patchwork for my fellow paladins! This will save you<br/>
from having to put those valuable practice points into a skill that gets (in<br/>
my limited experience) used very rarely once you have a set of armor.  I<br/>
already spent &#39;em, already got my own armor, and don&#39;t mind helping you to<br/>
save your valuable training points.  Patchwork helps you take less damage in<br/>
combat!<br/>
<br/>
Please bring your own pelts & patterns, otherwise I&#39;ll help you hunt down<br/>
the pelts & patterns (6sp, 6cp per pattern from the NPC merchant).  This<br/>
helps me meet fellow paladins, maybe provides a little adventure from Lion,<br/>
Wolf, and Bear hunting, and helps keep yer hide intact with no practice<br/>
points and very little silver spent.<br/>
<br/>
Keep the faith & Bring Pride on Our Guild, Brothers & Sisters!<br/>
