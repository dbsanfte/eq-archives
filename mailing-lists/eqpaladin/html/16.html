<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438597230">The bonebladed claymore is in Befallen the mighty paladin told me. Oh one <br/>
thing to note all beware entering ak&#39;anon. I used to hunt there regulary and <br/>
bewaring the mino hero I had myself bound to Ak&#39;anon. The other day I was <br/>
killed and reappeared at my normal spot near entrance to my surpirse I was <br/>
swiftly killed by a clockwork merchant who proclaimed me a heathen. Turns out <br/>
my choosen diety doesnt work well with him, to make a long story short, due <br/>
to load times, he killed me three times in a row before I could even have <br/>
time to move out of zone, losing over 4 hours worth of work, needless to say <br/>
dropping back down to 11th lvl didn&#39;t sit well with me. I thought I would <br/>
pass along info being that merchant is right by zone, at least on my server <br/>
