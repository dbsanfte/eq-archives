<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252779801">I also have a troll character and know exactly what Jojongua is.  He <br/>
is the diety of the kobolds and is a very bad boy.  He looks like a <br/>
kobold, except that he is about 3 tmies as big and hits for about 4 <br/>
times as much.  I watched him take out a 17th level monk, so be <br/>
warned.<br/>
