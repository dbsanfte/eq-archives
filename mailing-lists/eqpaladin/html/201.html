<div id="ygrps-yiv-186451144">For paladin, you will definitly want to go with 1h slashing,  the <br/>
delay/damage ratio is quite balanced for 1h and 2h with 2h having a bit <br/>
advantage when used with double attack, yet you cant use a shield and more <br/>
importantly you cant use bash, one of the most important skill for paladin <br/>
second to lay hand. And of course there are the holy swords, the ones we know <br/>
are 1h.  So choose well and follow your heart. heh<br/>
