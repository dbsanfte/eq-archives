<div id="ygrps-yiv-992102920">Gwen:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for the reply.  I do not have any questions.  I mainly wanted to know if this was a good location for Paladin specific questions, but I saw very little activity.  I think I will stick around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What community do you recommend for EQ n00bs to go?  I do not think I know enough to know what to even ask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie</div>
