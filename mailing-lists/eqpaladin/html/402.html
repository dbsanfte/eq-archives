<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194851198">I&#39;m gonna have to say no (sorry) because for around the same price you could <br/>
have gotten dwarven chainmail (12 AC and resistance bonuses) or a banded <br/>
tunic (15 AC)<br/>
<br/>
The reason that tunic cost so much is because leather-only class such as <br/>
druids and monks want it so badly.  Paladins can wear all the armors, so it <br/>
was a bit of a waste.<br/>
<br/>
No worries though!  You can sell it for 40 in the qeynos area. TRUST ME =)<br/>
