<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212143482">I started it but I never finished it. By the way, I should introduce<br/>
myself as well. I&#39;m Reppik on Bertoxxulous. I too am serving Erollisi Marr<br/>
and can usually be found in and around Freeport. I&#39;m only Lvl 7 at the<br/>
moment however. <br/>
As to the quest, I didn&#39;t even know that the quest took you out of<br/>
Freeport. I had to give up because I couldn&#39;t find anyone that would even<br/>
tell me about Xyrin.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d like to introduce myself.  My character rather. The name is Tiresias,<br/>
&gt; and right now he&#39;s a level 14 Paladin on the Povar server.  You know...<br/>
&gt; Povar... You never heard of Povar?! =)  He serves Erollisi Marr 24/7.  I<br/>
&gt; usually hangs around Freeport area... the commonlands, Desert of Ro, and<br/>
&gt; Befallen, smiting evil and whatnot.  In any case...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was wondering if anyone did the quest to look for the last Guard Xyrin in<br/>
&gt; the quest that starts in the Temple of Marr.  Is that a beginner&#39;s quest or<br/>
&gt; what?  Because I got as far as the isle in the Ocean of Tears talking to all<br/>
&gt; the Holy Woman O&#39; Fun and I hear a scream come out of nowhere yearning for<br/>
&gt; help, but I can&#39;t find where it&#39;s coming from!  The nearest islands have<br/>
&gt; goblins I&#39;m not sure I want to mess with... anybody do this one yet?<br/>
