<div id="ygrps-yiv-110936985">We&#39;ll need a place to post or send submissions.  One idea is a message<br/>
board.  I have one that was free if no one else has a better one.  It&#39;s<br/>
been a while since I was in there and have to look at notes to get<br/>
back...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, something like that with a good thread structure even better or<br/>
I could make a simple form on my web site for people to submit stuff<br/>
(will go into an Access database so I could categorize what type of<br/>
suggestion/info it is) with drop downs for what the category/info is and<br/>
text fields for the info?  I use active server pages on my web site so<br/>
it would be easy to continuously show the newest info as the pages build<br/>
themselves every time someone hits it.<br/>
<br/>
lemme know on the web idea and I can do that,<br/>

This Sounds like an awesome idea. But how are we going to pool all of <br/>
the info into a FAQ? Well, if we decide to do it I&#39;ll do what I can to <br/>
help<br/>

&gt;I have an idea, we can all pool out thoughts and expierences together <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to form a Paladin FAQ to help the Newcomers and even the veterans of <br/>
our Exhalted class. It could include Quest discriptions, weaponry <br/>
reccommendations, Lvl guide to what you should be fighting, etc. This <br/>
is just a thoughtfrom a late night E-mail reading session, and The #&#39;s <br/>
of brothers and sisters in the list keeps rising, so feel free to ask <br/>
away or just share stories, or even the occasional rant about an <br/>
annoying Shadowknight or Necro :P<br/>
