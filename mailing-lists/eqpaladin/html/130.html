<div id="ygrps-yiv-342087058">So the northmost one that goes to north freeport starts where?  I want to<br/>
find a shortcut from East Freeport (when I am coming back from the desert<br/>
with stuff to put in the bank, or I need to do some blacksmithing or visit<br/>
the guild) that goes to North Freeport without having to go all the way to<br/>
West Freeport.  Is there a way?<br/>

It is probably best to learn the catacombs before ravaging the mercenary<br/>
scum <br/>
of freeport.  There are illusionary walls all along the outside of freeport.<br/>
<br/>
two in west freeport and one outisde of the south gate.  At least that I<br/>
have <br/>
found.  The north most one is near the corner and leads into north freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know what level I should be to try the test of truth?  (the one with<br/>
the <br/>
2 tokens)?<br/>

&gt; Hail,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just some comments to the list.  I read the list in digest version so I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t respond to specific emails.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.  Do not overly worry about having enough mana to cast spells.  I have<br/>
&gt; reached the 19th Order in the Service of Brell and have yet to find a<br/>
&gt; spell I cannot cast due to lack of total mana.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.  It is best to always seed any new skills.  Check your spell book to<br/>
&gt; see what skill the new spells you gain are and drop a point accordingly<br/>
&gt; into each one.  Just as a tip, buy the lowest mana spell in each class,<br/>
&gt; just for the purpose of skilling.  I used sense undead to raise my<br/>
&gt; Divination skill, once I started it maxxed in about 3 days of casting.<br/>
&gt; I cast while hanging out just about anywhere.  The hardest for us I<br/>
&gt; think will be conjuration, to the extent I haven&#39;t even bought the<br/>
&gt; Hammer spell because I don&#39;t see a use.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3.  Magic weapons are important.  I am using a Combine 2-Handed at the<br/>
&gt; moment.  The cost was very high at 112 plat, but quite worth it in the<br/>
&gt; long run.  I am fortunate to have several friends with whom I pool coin<br/>
&gt; to purchase items.  But ye need to try and save at least 60 plat and buy<br/>
&gt; a Combine Longsword to use for coining.  The reasoning behind this is<br/>
&gt; the combines are faster and hit harder, thereby allowing you to slay<br/>
&gt; those evil bastages in a more timely fashion.  Willows are great coin,<br/>
&gt; the lightstones sell for 8 gold (i&#39;m a dwarf, charisma ain&#39;t me strong<br/>
&gt; point) and the greaters sell for almost 4 plat.  That is to merchants.<br/>
&gt; There are always players out there in need and you can make roughly<br/>
&gt; fifty percent profit over merchant costs sometimes.  On a note about<br/>
&gt; Ghoulsbane, the crew I&#39;m with will be attempting to get a few of those<br/>
&gt; this weekend.  One thing I know for sure, don&#39;t try it if your under<br/>
&gt; 20th level.  The rumor is the FroggerKing is close to level 30.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4. I remember seeing a message regarding a back entrance to North<br/>
&gt; Freeport.   I am curious if anyone has better details of this.  I plan<br/>
&gt; on rampaging those evil guards this weekend (very holy-type evil grin).<br/>
