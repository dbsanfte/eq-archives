<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692900416">Last night on the dunes of North Ro my group and I vanquished a foe I had never before seen. It was called Dunedigger and it looked like a huge armadillo. After dispatching it, it yielded up an armadillo hide. Does anyone know of a use for it? Perhaps a type of armor? Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
