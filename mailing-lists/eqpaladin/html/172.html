<div id="ygrps-yiv-993230138">Has anyone completed a quest they were really pleased with?  The only<br/>
paladin quest that I tried and/or completed was the one for shark skins.  I<br/>
only rec&#39;d a few copper for my reward and a tiny hit for experience.  I was<br/>
quite disappointed.  I am currently level 14, so it would be nice if I could<br/>
still attempt any of the quests mentioned.  Thanks for your input, and I<br/>
don&#39;t mind a little humor in the group as long as it doesn&#39;t get out of<br/>
hand.<br/>
