<br/>
<br/>
I have a high level Magician and just recently started a Paladin.  I have to<br/>
say... I really like him.. but hate not being able to gate.   Do you all<br/>
just walk the land? Selling and buying from Innkeepers?  Just going back to<br/>
train?  Or is it not that big or a concern?  I cant remember the last time I<br/>
actually walked back to a city unless it was just to bind myself there...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...  I also really hate it when I use LOH on the MOB I&#39;m trying to<br/>
kill....  It never seems to appreciate it.</div>
