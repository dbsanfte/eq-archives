<b>Subject:</b> Re: Why did you choose to play a paladin? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-532030493">To start with I have always gotten into the Holy Knight thing since I was a<br/>
kid. I wanted something more than a warrior or barbarian and I saw the<br/>
usefulness of the cleric, being a paladin and having the ability to help<br/>
others in a pinch and having the ability to take alot of damage - LOH, and of<br/>
course my disgust of the undead, the paladin class naturally appealed to me.<br/>
I have just reached lvl 10 and have found that this class only gets better<br/>
with age and look forward to hitting 22, then Befallen shall be mine!!!<br/>
