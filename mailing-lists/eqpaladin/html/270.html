Sounds like you want to be completely &quot;out&quot; of this guild - just type in<br/>
&quot;/guildremove&quot; to regain your honour.  Once you leave the guild you probably<br/>
be a &quot;Lamr lozer&quot; and &quot;KOS dood&quot;, but since the little pricks can&#39;t actually<br/>
hurt you anyway, I wouldn&#39;t get too worried. If they harass you, just get in<br/>
touch with your local GM.<br/>
<br/>
You can find all the other guild commands on the everquest website.<br/>

&gt;Hail Fellow Holy Warriors<br/>
&gt;    I know that this does not really relate to &quot;paladin stuff&quot; but through<br/>
&gt;the emails we have<br/>
&gt;built a small community here and I have had many game questions answered<br/>
&gt;here so this<br/>
&gt;seemed like the best place to ask for help. I am currently a lvl 12 (1<br/>
&gt;bubble to 13th) High<br/>
&gt;Elf Paladin currently operating on the Cazic Thule server on the continent<br/>
&gt;of Faydwer and<br/>
&gt;I made a horrible mistake. I rushed into joining a guild not knowing what<br/>
&gt;type of people<br/>
&gt;the guild was and more wanting brotherhood then anything else. To my horror<br/>
&gt;I realized I<br/>
&gt;had joined a gang of petty kill stealing, cheat exploiting, bug exploiting<br/>
&gt;thugs. My problem<br/>
&gt;is that the guild officers refuse to allow me to leave the guild and was<br/>
&gt;hoping someone<br/>
&gt;could tell me a way that I can quit the guild without being removed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you all and may Tunare bless you all and may your blades find there<br/>
&gt;mark<br/>
