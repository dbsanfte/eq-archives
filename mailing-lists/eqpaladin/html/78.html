<b>Subject:</b> What level do you need to be able to take Squire Narls? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882199788">Well, I just got back from a nice trip to the Butcherblocks, and the kind<br/>
cleric who rebound me to Freeport threw in a bravery and a spirit armor just<br/>
for grins.  Self, I say, why not go and take out Narls so you can do that<br/>
quest?  Well, with about 287hp (God, I love bravery), a 1h slash skill of<br/>
33, full leather armor, and about five lesser heals thrown onto me by some<br/>
nice wandering cleric, I managed to hit Narls five time before I died.  Once<br/>
for 10, once for 8, and three times for 1.  Now, Narls is green to me, and<br/>
I&#39;m afraid if I go too much further levelwise, I wont be able to get this<br/>
quest.  Thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
