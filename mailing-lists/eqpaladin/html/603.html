<div id="ygrps-yiv-785451461">it comes from the Guk King in lower guk on the live side.  it is actually<br/>
dmg 21 del 40, a nd does have haste effect which is probably 10 to 20%<br/>
increase in attack speed (any hard numbers on this?).  while easier than<br/>
soulfire, it is still not easy to get, as the Guk King is the toughest mob<br/>
in the zone, and has 5 friends nearby to help him out.<br/>

&gt; I believe it comes from lower guk, rare drop and stuff.. <br/>
&gt; Stats are like, damage 25 delay 40, AND it has permanent <br/>
&gt; effect haste, which cuts down delay by 25%, so the delay is <br/>
&gt; really 30.. 25/30.. DROOL!<br/>
