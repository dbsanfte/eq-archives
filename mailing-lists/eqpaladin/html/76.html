<div id="ygrps-yiv-847048842">I have been sharpening swords and daggers with success and have never used a<br/>
water flask.  Is this really necessary, or were you speaking of making other<br/>
items for which you need ore and water?  You do however, need two sharpening<br/>
stones with most swords and I had to use 3 stones with an axe.  Is this what<br/>
everyone else has found?  <br/>

The mixture is 1 stone, 1 rusty weapon, and one STORE bought water flask.<br/>
You are however much better off putting 15-20 practice points into smithing<br/>
and then start making files and scallers.<br/>

&gt; If I want to start blacksmithing, I was told to start on Rusty daggers. Do<br/>
&gt; I just combineone with a sharpening stone in a forge? I tried it one and<br/>
&gt; it told me my skill was not good enough, but when I tried it 2, 3, 4, 5,<br/>
&gt; and 6th times it said that &quot;those materials in those quanitites (1 dagger,<br/>
&gt; one stone) was not enough to produce anything. Did  I miss a step? <br/>
