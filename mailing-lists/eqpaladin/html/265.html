would get the most powerful weapons....make the weapon you find unique....so<br/>
what if only 5-10 players have one...makes it special.<br/>

&gt; I think they should be unique, or at least only one chance to get the<br/>
&gt; sword every two months or so....otherwise everyone would have one<br/>
&gt; eventually....or maybe even...one sword per month...if the group<br/>
&gt; attempting to get the sword fails..it disappears for the rest of that<br/>
&gt; month.  That will at least make getting this or that holy sword something<br/>
&gt; for great value and fame.  Let that paladin&#39;s name ring loud and clear<br/>
&gt; from the forests of Nektulos to the swamps of Innothule.<br/>
