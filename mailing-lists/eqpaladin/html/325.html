<div id="ygrps-yiv-3015214">*By the way, I have two questions for the group:<br/>
*1. I&#39;m very close to 10th level - what is the next skill <br/>
*gained after 9th?<br/>
*<br/>
<br/>
Meditate is at level 12 ... I forget what level I got Dodge, though, maybe<br/>
level 10?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. I&#39;m currently using a Minotaur axe - what have you found to <br/>
*be the next<br/>
*logical weapon upgrade?<br/>
*<br/>
<br/>
Combine long sword, if you are doing the 1H slash road.  A bit over 50 plat<br/>
from gypsies. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps :)<br/>
