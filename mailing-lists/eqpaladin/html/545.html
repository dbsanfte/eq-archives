<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448081789">Hi all =)<br/>
<br/>
I just want to know if any of you can tell me where to find the scute shield ? I heard of it and the stats sounds good to me =) Maybe I can get it my own ? Or maybe I need to buy it ? Thanx =)<br/>
<br/>
The second is that I started the zimel&#39;s quest too and I hope to find out something new to post here soon =)<br/>

btw: I tried to start the test or truth too. But I had no luck ! After I got a note from a younger paladin I brought it to altunic but he told me that there are other things to do for me ( How can I get the testamony of truth now ? I heard that you need it for another quest maybe. Thanx<br/>
