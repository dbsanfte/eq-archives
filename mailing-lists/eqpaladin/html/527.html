<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123277651">About Soulfire, the quest continues.  I am working with a few groups to acquire<br/>
this hilt on the Cazic-Thule server.  We are still looking for Bog Juice...<br/>
Sounds disgusting to me.  I would buy Zimel a whole barrel of Elven Wine if it<br/>
would help.<br/>
<br/>
About Ghoulsbane, I still think it is a quest sword but the quest is so broken<br/>
no one even knows where it starts.  I don&#39;t like the idea of killing another<br/>
Paladin to get Ghoulsbane, but what else can we do?  I do not have a Holy Sword<br/>
of any kind, but a day will come when I will have to make the decision.<br/>
<br/>
I am still trying to collect information on Brilliant Sword of Faith.  It looks<br/>
like that quest is still broken.  What gets me is the fact that it WORKED at<br/>
one point, and then they broke it.<br/>

&gt; This newsgroup has been kind of slow lately, and I am wondering what<br/>
&gt; everyones thoughts on geting ghoulsbane are, because you do have to kill a<br/>
&gt; fellow paladin to get it. Also has anyone here found any other piecec of<br/>
&gt; soulfire other than the hilt that is on the shadowknight in Mistmoore? Just<br/>
&gt; a few new topics to hopefully breathe some life into this group.<br/>
