<b>Subject:</b> Magical Armor items spreadsheet <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-704222454">This is a spreadsheet that shows a lot of the magical armor items in the<br/>
game.  I got it off of one of these mailing lists.  Does anyone know where<br/>
it came from?  And does anyone have an updated version of it?  Please let me<br/>
know.<br/>
