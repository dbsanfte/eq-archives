 </span></blockquote>Hi there. Unfortunately, every time I log into this group, there <br/>
isn&#39;t much going on, other than people trying to get you to go to an <br/>
EQ commercial site...  No real discussion going on either :(   For <br/>
anyone that&#39;s interested, I&#39;ve put up a site for EQ, my MAIN (47 <br/>
Paladin), and Paladins...  It&#39;s called, &quot;The Paladin&#39;s Club&quot;, and <br/>
it&#39;s not for the shy of heart (some background pics are a bit racey, <br/>
but they&#39;re all from famous artists lol)  All Pallies are invited, <br/>
there&#39;s a message board there, that does NOT require membership, <br/>
which we can use to discuss stuff.  also compiling all the quest info <br/>
for pallies there.  Don&#39;t have much reaady yet on the quests, but I <br/>
DO have the Ghoulbane part up :)  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.members.cox.net/karmana">http://www.members.cox.net/karmana</a><br/>
