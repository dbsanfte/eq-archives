&gt; This has been an interesting and informative thread, I&#39;m glad I started<br/>
it!<br/>
&gt; Consensus seems to be that:<br/>
&gt; A) Wait until you get past level 25 before even trying to get the sword,<br/>
&gt; B) Ghoulbane is extremely hard to get even at lvl 30 and above,<br/>
&gt; C) There are more appropriate weapons that I should be using until I hit<br/>
&gt; over level 25.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Seems like for us honest 17th thru 25th level Paladins our weapon choices<br/>
&gt; are pretty clear:<br/>
&gt; 1. combine longsword or scimitar / shiny brass shield<br/>
&gt; 2. shiny brass halberd<br/>
&gt; 3. hammer of wrath / shiny brass shield<br/>
&gt; ...with the nod going to the shiny brass halberd at level 20.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I *like* the way bash interrupts spells, and would regret not being able<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; use it for 5 or more levels. If I switch to a shiny brass halberd then I<br/>
am<br/>
&gt; walking away from 1-handed slashing skill which will need to be made up<br/>
&gt; after I do get ghoulbane.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are there any other weapon/shield combos I am overlooking that actually<br/>
&gt; worked for some of you more accomplished Paladins?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again, thanks everybody for the input.<br/>

&gt; &gt; True the druid can &quot;sneak&quot; the paladin down and the paladin can &quot;hide&quot;<br/>
in the &quot;safe&quot; corner while his friends do the work and then hand him a<br/>
weapon he did nothing to earn, but any paladin worth a grain of salt who<br/>
uses these techniques I don&#39;t feel they deserve one. First of all there is a<br/>
sort of honor arranging the group, leading it in, and having an active party<br/>
&gt; &gt; work together with you contributing. Who needs it at lvl 17 anyways? You<br/>
won&#39;t do max dmg till 20 and the effect won&#39;t work as well. There are many<br/>
other fine weapons out there till then.  Second of all in my experience<br/>
camping this thing, it can go bad very quick..people say you can stay in one<br/>
room safely and keep a couple spawns controlled, but if you really want to<br/>
live keep the whole area clean. Trust me it goes much better this way. Some<br/>
people get lucky and get the sword right away..that has never been my<br/>
experience as it is still not something I have obtained and i have tried<br/>
many times. It&#39;s a long camp but it will be well worth it if you earn it.<br/>
