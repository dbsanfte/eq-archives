&gt; &gt;i was thinking about equipping my lvl 3 guy with a dwarven axe.... what<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt;this do to my character?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you can do it, it&#39;s ok. You will have a very good dmg/delay ratio.<br/>
&gt; IMHO, your character is a very young, and you don&#39;t really need it. In a few<br/>
&gt; levels, you could have a mino axe (dmg 8, delay 37 (not sure), heavy !!!)<br/>
&gt; until the first 10s. Plus, you could loose your corpse easily, and not be<br/>
&gt; able to have it back before it disappears. I remember it happened to me at<br/>
&gt; lvl 3 and I lost my guild tunic. I can imagine if I had a dwarven battle axe<br/>
&gt; at that time. Well, I was a real newby at that time, and I went to Lesser<br/>
&gt; Faydark. I ran to the browny camp while running from a centurion  :o)<br/>
