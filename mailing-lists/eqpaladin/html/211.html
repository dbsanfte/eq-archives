<div id="ygrps-yiv-315818338">Well, at least it encouraged some posting. =)<br/>
<br/>
Well, for some reason I cannot play an evil class... I never could.  I suck<br/>
at it.  I can&#39;t be mean, and I hate when people are.  However, it is these<br/>
types of people which make good people seem all the better. =)<br/>
<br/>
I chose to be a Paladin because I wanted to help people.  I wanted people to<br/>
have a hero... I loved the idea of LOH, and because I have such a skill,<br/>
I&#39;ve acutally saved many lives.  Even though most of the time people tend to<br/>
take it as something to pay me back on, as long as they are alive, I&#39;m cool.<br/>
=)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a saint however. =)  I do it partially to get positive feedback from<br/>
others.  If they don&#39;t say thank you or anything, I&#39;ll actually get bummed.<br/>
However, it still makes me feel good that I helped someone out.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I wanted to be on the front lines.  I like a character that can duke<br/>
it out in battle long enough for another to escape.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to make sure I got the Holy Swords, because I hear they&#39;re the<br/>
neat-o-est in the game.<br/>
<br/>
I chose a half-elf to give it a challenge.  Most people are humans when<br/>
making Paladin&#39;s (from what I&#39;ve seen) and being half-Filipino/half-white in<br/>
real life, I thought I could play such a race in the game as well.<br/>
<br/>
I chose the goddess Erollisi cuz of my love of romance.  However, I am<br/>
finding that even I don&#39;t think such stuff happens often in the game.  For<br/>
some reason, as much as I roleplay, I don&#39;t want to hit on a guy playing a<br/>
girl. =)  So my goddess only played the part of Tiresias loving all, even<br/>
dark elves, rather than focusing on any relationships.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s my half-cent thrown in. =)<br/>

&gt; Hail all!!!!! This is a question posed to everyone who has subscribed to<br/>
&gt; this list. Why did you choose to play a paladin? No matter your reasons,<br/>
&gt; share them with us. Hopefully everyone here is mature enough not to flame<br/>
&gt; people for their reasons and what not.<br/>
