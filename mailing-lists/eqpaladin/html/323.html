By the way, I have two questions for the group:<br/>
1. I&#39;m very close to 10th level - what is the next skill gained after 9th?<br/>
2. I&#39;m currently using a Minotaur axe - what have you found to be the next<br/>
logical weapon upgrade?<br/>
<br/>
Best to you all,<br/>
Kaladin the Paladin from Kaladim (who is *still* mad at the random name<br/>
generator, grrr..)<br/>
