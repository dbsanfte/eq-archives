<div id="ygrps-yiv-95392672">This is kind of off the wall, for it is 3 AM, but i just thought I would comment on the pure numbers of subscription e-mails i have recieved.  Just to comment on the part about Unrest in Llorfindal, Unrest isnt safe, but i can be done at lvl 13, I went there for the first time at 11,and survived on beetles in a large group. Thank you all for joining, and keep the subscriptions rolling in :) the more people on, the more minds to help each other. Also I have finally reached lvl 15, I can now ward so i am estactic :) Ok, i have rambeled enough, time for sleep.<br/>
