<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097179228">Repost, no new info since last week.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  If any of the information below is inaccurate in any way post an<br/>
update, or send it directly to me and I will repost this message.<br/>
<br/>
Brilliant Sword of Faith (Confirmed!)<br/>
Quest Item<br/>
Damage: 20<br/>
Delay: 44<br/>
Type: 2H Slashing<br/>
Effects: +50 mana<br/>
You must kill Lucan and return his testimony to the head of he Paladin<br/>
Guild in Freeport.  No one has been able to get Lucan&#39;s Testomony (which<br/>
is required to get the sword) in nearly a month now.  It is very likely<br/>
the quest IS broken.<br/>
<br/>
Pearl Bladed Claymore (May also be called Shiny Bladed Claymore)<br/>
Damage:  17<br/>
Delay:  40<br/>
Type: 2H Slashing<br/>
Weight:  10.0<br/>
Note:   Not sure if this is actually a holy sword or not, it was marked<br/>
as being a Paladin only sword, on the Everlore site<br/>
(http://www.everlore.com).  Possibly retrieved from mistmoore.  A<br/>
person, reported from beta, wielding it was doing damage in the 60&#39;s and<br/>
70&#39;s to undead.  The name could have been shiny bladed claymore.<br/>
Update!  No one has seen any evidance of this sword since Beta.  It may<br/>
have been removed or renamed and made non-class specific.<br/>
<br/>
Ghoulbane (CONFIRMED!)<br/>
Pending Lore Item<br/>
Damage: 15<br/>
Delay: 34<br/>
Type: 1H Slashing<br/>
Effect: Dismiss Undead, Acts as a light source comparable to a<br/>
lightstone.<br/>
Weight: 9.5<br/>
Located:  It is located in Upper Guk, on the Shin Lord.  Both the Shin<br/>
Lords respawn rate, and the respawn rate of the weapon are very low, so<br/>
it may take quite a bit of time to get the weapon.  Level needed to<br/>
obtain:  Full group as low as 28th.  Full group in early 30&#39;s to be<br/>
safe.  If you use the weapon at lower than 21st level you will get the<br/>
message &quot;You do not have the will to command this weapon&quot; when it tries<br/>
to activate dismiss undead.  You have to kill a Froglok Paladin to get<br/>
this sword.  Possibly a quest sword and the quest is broken.<br/>
<br/>
Fiery Avenger<br/>
Quest item<br/>
Damage: 35<br/>
Delay: 48<br/>
Type: 2H Slashing<br/>
Effects:  Inferno Shock<br/>
Note:  There is very little information on this sword, other than it was<br/>
2H, and at one point during the Beta they made it available to all<br/>
classes to test it (and show it off).  At the moment it is believed to<br/>
be 35 Damage and 45 Speed, which would make learning that 2H Slash tell<br/>
worth it.  It is also understood that his is a quest item, but for what<br/>
guild, or from what NPC I don&#39;t know.<br/>
Update!  The BIG GUY himself (Brad) was seen carying Firey Avenger<br/>
durring the slaying of the great Lady Vox (that was a sad day) on the<br/>
Veeshan server earlier this month.  He plays a Ranger.<br/>
<br/>
Soulfire  (New Info as of 06/04/99)<br/>
The stats on this sword are not known.  The quest for this sword is<br/>
known as The Zimel&#39;s Blades quest, and is started by talking to the<br/>
Female Paladin on top of the Hall of Truth in Freeport.  Any Paladin in<br/>
good standing with the Knights of Truth should be able to start this<br/>
quest.  When it is available, full documentation of this quest will be<br/>
made available. Until then, here is what we know:<br/>
<br/>
You find out, very early on the quest, that the Fallen Paladin Lucan<br/>
(the head of the militia in Freeport) is working with Pietro Zarn (the<br/>
head of the Shadow Knight guild in Freeport) to recover the sword<br/>
Soulfire, which Zarn once had in his position before a local blacksmith<br/>
named Zimel stole it.  Soon after Zimel stole the sword, which did not<br/>
rightfully belong to Zarn in the first place, Zimel disappeared.  You<br/>
are sent on this quest to find Soulfire before Lucan does.<br/>
<br/>
We have found Zimel.  He is the prisoner below the Arena.  You need<br/>
Tykar Renlin, a drunk of East Freeport, to give you a blanket to give to<br/>
Zimel who we hope will tell us the location of Soulfire.  When Tykar<br/>
Renlin appears in Seafarer&#39;s Roost, a tavern on the docks of East<br/>
Freeport, he will respond to &quot;Who is Zimel&quot; but he won&#39;t talk unless you<br/>
buy him a drink. You need ot give Tykar 4 Drom&#39;s Champagnes.  You get<br/>
Drom&#39;s Champagne from the bartender.  These are lore items, so you give<br/>
him one at a time and he then gives you a Blanket (Lore) and tells you<br/>
Zimel is help captive under the Arena!  Zimel also asks for Bog and<br/>
Goo.  This is though to be Bog Juice and Edible Goo.  Edible Goo can be<br/>
made by combining a fire beetle eye and a rat ear (or whisker, not sure<br/>
which) in an oven.  It only takes a skill of 5 or so in baking to make.<br/>
If anyone has the location of Bog juice please post it!<br/>
<br/>
NEW!  A player has found a &quot;Glowing Sword Hilt&quot;, which was identified as<br/>
the hilt of Soulfire.  If this is actually the case, Soulfire has been<br/>
broken into pieces and we will have to find all of them, probably this<br/>
hilt, the guard, the blade, and possibly the pummel.  The guard  was<br/>
found on a Troll Shadow Knight  named Xintric in Mistmoore.  The Shadow<br/>
Knight was probably around 40th-45th level.  NOTE:  This information has<br/>
not been completely confirmed. We have, however, seen a screen capture<br/>
of the hilt.<br/>
<br/>
What next?<br/>
We need to find the following Bog Juice.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you keeping up on the quest give 4 Drom&#39;s Champagnes to<br/>
Tykar in Seafarer&#39;s Roost (he appears at night).<br/>
<br/>
We need to know the following:<br/>
Do you give all three items (blanket, Bog Juice, and Edible Goo) to<br/>
Zimel (the prisoner) at the same time, or one at a time?<br/>
<br/>
We are VERY close.  If we get there three items to Zimel in the correct<br/>
order it is very likely he will tell us the location of Soulfire.  Only<br/>
then will the final battle be fought, and the great weapon be found.<br/>
Good luck, and report back if you have the answer to any of the<br/>
questions.<br/>
