Paladins are natural group leaders, most of the other classes are too busy<br/>
typing to direct combat, if you&#39;re a young paladin, try to group with a<br/>
higher level one, don&#39;t worry about not getting experience, just try to<br/>
watch how he/she leads a party.<br/>
<br/>
Hailing...<br/>
One technique that I have found really usefull is to ensure that you are<br/>
attacking the same monster.  Sometimes you may want to attack a mob that you<br/>
can kill with one shot, just to get it off your back..but other times you<br/>
want everyone to attack the hardest hitting mob.  What I do is hail the mob<br/>
that I am currently attacking.  I train my party members to watch for the<br/>
hail and attack that same mob.  Hail is better than a group tell because you<br/>
only have to target the mob and hit the &#39;h&#39; key.  In heavy combat you may<br/>
want to hit &#39;h&#39; 4 or 5 times so that you can be sure they see it.<br/>
<br/>
Taunting...<br/>
As a tank, you must taunt the mobs off the other players, you may have to<br/>
switch your mob, taunt him, then switch back to the original mob.  Don&#39;t<br/>
hail for this type of movement, since you want your party members to stay on<br/>
the big target.  Use /assist playername for your clerics.  Make sure you<br/>
tell the clerics to target the mob that is attacking them, otherwise /assist<br/>
is about as usefull as a solo bard.  I hot key it...right click on any<br/>
social ability and change the script.  I usually do a group tell saying who<br/>
I am assisting (mostly so the cleric doesn&#39;t freak out) and then /assist the<br/>
poor guy (hard code the players name, change it when you get in a new<br/>
party).  Your goal as tank should be to have EVERY mob hitting you, don&#39;t<br/>
worry, you were created to take it, and your cleric was created to help.<br/>
Get your taunt skill up when you solo, and get a good weapon.  Mobs tend to<br/>
turn to the guys that are wacking them the hardest, it&#39;s easier to taunt if<br/>
your doing some damage yourself.  Mobs don&#39;t taunt off a player who is low<br/>
on hps (seems like about 2 bubbles).  So tell them &#39;Back off&#39;, BEFORE 2<br/>
bubbles. Dont try to bash until everything is hitting you, I usually use a<br/>
2hander anyway, but thats up to you of course.<br/>
<br/>
Mana...<br/>
For pete&#39;s sake have your mana users in your group give you constant updates<br/>
on their mana, now I myself cannot stand being a pansy caster, but that is<br/>
their thing.  If you go charging into battle without their mana being<br/>
sufficient, it&#39;s a damn shame.  Paladins are warriors, our magic is not<br/>
combat magic, and you really shouldn&#39;t rely on healing yourself in combat<br/>
until level 15.  After that, the number of hit points that a paladin can<br/>
generate are heads and tails above a same level warrior, thats why we tank,<br/>
get it?  I use yaulp when everything is taunted on me, I notice I dont hit<br/>
harder but I connect more.<br/>
<br/>
Know your classes...<br/>
Geez, don&#39;t play anything but a paladin, but you have got to know the other<br/>
classes abilitites.  I sometimes group tell... &#39;Cleric smite necro&#39; or &#39;Bard<br/>
str song&#39;.  Don&#39;t worry about formulating sentences, but be clear and<br/>
concise.<br/>
<br/>
Lay on Hands...<br/>
I use lay on hands on myself as a last resort.  The most gratifying thing<br/>
about lay on hands (loh)is using it on another party member, especially<br/>
those hard hitting wizards...Now you might think that the loh is your<br/>
ability and should be used to save your neck.  I just dont think that,<br/>
besides if a wizard has mana, but no hit points he will do a hell of a lot<br/>
more good alive than a tank who is afraid to die.  Listen young paladins,<br/>
tanks are meant to die, thats what we do.  Every time I die in a group as<br/>
soon as I respawn I do a group tell, saying &#39;Tanks are meant to die, thats<br/>
what we do!&#39;  If I die but my group members live, I celebrate.  If my group<br/>
members die and I survive, I hang my head.<br/>
<br/>
Hope these tips help you.<br/>
