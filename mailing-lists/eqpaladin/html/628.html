<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-435261086">Congratulations to you! I hope to get one of my very own someday, at this<br/>
point that day seems very far away indeed. My 18th level clerical friend and<br/>
I tried time and again to storm the depths of Befallen, but the residents of<br/>
that hole managed to defeat us time and again. Instead of taking a few steps<br/>
towards the higher levels, those deaths cost me a few steps back. A quick<br/>
scan of your message reveals what may be a flaw in my strategy - we need a<br/>
few more in our party to make Befallen ours. What do most Paladin&#39;s Befallen<br/>
romps consist of in party members?<br/>
<br/>
I generally try to play paired up with another player, that way we can take<br/>
on things that /con up to equal to me. Unfortunately that causes trouble<br/>
when more than one creature attacks, even if those creatures are conning<br/>
blue. In one battle down there my clerical friend (lvl 18) and I (lvl 17)<br/>
took out (all blue) 2 greater skeletons, 2 necromancer acolytes, both pets,<br/>
1 ghoul, 1 wisp, and 1 lesser mummy, at the end of which we were both below<br/>
30% health and no mana. Quite the battle royale, and we were both amazed we<br/>
had survived!<br/>
<br/>
Again, congratulations on your new Ghoulbane sword!<br/>
Kaladin, who weilds a mighty hammer of wrath for now :)<br/>
