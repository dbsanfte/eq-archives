<b>Subject:</b> well balanced weapons <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403261962">From what I understand about BBC warriors can use it too. A thing to think <br/>
about also is well-balanced weapons, I was checking them out at the shady <br/>
swashbuckler in east commons last night and some pretty nice stats, the <br/>
dwarven 2h axe well-balanced is 16dmg 43 delay and magical, that&#39;s only one <br/>
point dmg less then the bbc. Of course they do run around 200 plat or so but <br/>
hey it is worth it. I have been trying to obtain info on Ghoulsbane from a <br/>
lvl 30 paladin who was at guk yesterday trying to get it, he may have it by <br/>
now who knows will ask him.<br/>
<br/>
BTW does anyone know stats on Shiny Brass Halberd?<br/>
<br/>
Sha&#39;kel paladin of 13th order still..(if only I didnt die so frequently &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
