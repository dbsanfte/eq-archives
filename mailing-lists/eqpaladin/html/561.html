&gt; &gt;From my experiences, Tykar comes in about twice a day.  One time he stays<br/>
&gt; for a while, at least 5 minutes, the other time he is there for only about<br/>
&gt; 30 seconds.  I used to spend a lot of time there, and found that going in<br/>
&gt; around midnight and waiting was the best plan.  However, seeing as they have<br/>
&gt; changed almost everything else in this quest (spawn rates and such) this all<br/>
&gt; could have changed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; About the bartender not selling to you, I have not has this problem, but<br/>
&gt; will check around to see if someone has found a way to get him on your good<br/>
&gt; side.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am in the part of the quest where I am supposed to meet Tykar Renlin<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the Seafarers Roost inn, but I have searched it thouroughly and he<br/>
&gt; &gt; was not there, does he only come at a certain time or do I need to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; something to make him come?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also my faction with the innkeepers is so that I cannot trade with them,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am KOS by freeport militia aswell, and this has REALLY made the quest<br/>
&gt; &gt; hard to do, I don&#39;t even want to think about how I am supposed to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; into the dungeon and meet Zimel hehe. But I guess this is all easy<br/>
&gt; &gt; compared to the other two pieces of the quest heh..<br/>
