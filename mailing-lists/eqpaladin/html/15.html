<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449979533">Hail to all my Holy Brothers and Sister,<br/>
My name is Valiance.  I am a dwarven Paladin of the 10th order.  I am<br/>
just introducing myself.  I hope to meet many of you and hopefully<br/>
adventure with you all.  I do have one place of interest for those of<br/>
you whom have not visited my homeland of Kaladim.  There is an area<br/>
called teh chessboard.  Many undead, but be forewarned tis not an easy<br/>
fight(all the fights that are worth it are that way)<br/>
<br/>
Valiance<br/>
Paladin of Underfoot<br/>
&quot;Be as the stone; strong. Your faith will protect you.&quot;<br/>
