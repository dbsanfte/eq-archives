<div id="ygrps-yiv-784152365">hi<br/>
To answer ur question I took some info from EQ&#39;lizer and this is it:<br/>
It&#39;s only slahing<br/>
<br/>
1-Handed Slashing<br/>
Fiery Avenger<br/>
The Fiery Avenger is perhaps the most powerful weapon in the game. It is <br/>
definitely the most awe-inspiring. There is something about seeing a flaming <br/>
sword in front of your eyes. It has a damage of 35 and a delay of only 45. <br/>
Perhaps more importantly it casts inferno shock randomly when it <br/>
successfully hits which will deal a whopping amount of damage.<br/>
Ghoulbane<br/>
Ghoulbane is the first of the paladins&#39; holy swords. It can be found off the <br/>
Froglock Lord in the palace area of Upper Guk. I do not have the stats on <br/>
this weapon as it has been changed since I last seen it. It is a one handed <br/>
slashing weapon with 15 dmg and 34 delay. It also casts dismiss undead <br/>
occasionally on a successful hit. It is a paladin only weapon.<br/>
Demon Claw<br/>
This one handed slashing weapon is found on the avatar in Cazic Thule. They <br/>
resemble freddy kruger&#39;s glove and have a dmg of 5 and a delay of 19.<br/>
Ebony Blade<br/>
The ebony blade is a ranger only one-handed sword. This sword has a damage <br/>
of 7, a delay of 24 and casts ensnaring roots when it hits.<br/>
Barbed Leather Whip<br/>
The barbed whip is a magical 1h-slashing weapon found on Bonecrusher at <br/>
Najena. It is a favorite among duel wielding rangers and warriors. Barbed <br/>
whips are not only magic but sport a damage factor of 7 and a delay of only <br/>
28.<br/>
Crystalline Sword<br/>
This sword is one of the better swords probably. It has a damage of 11, <br/>
delay of 38 and is one handed.<br/>
Dwarven Axe<br/>
These items can be found on the Orc Lord at Crushbone.  1 handed dwarven <br/>
axes the best non-magical 1 handed slashing weapons in the game. They <br/>
feature a damage of 6 and an attack delay of only 26. They are also much <br/>
lighter than minotaur axe, which is important when, duel wielding. 2 handed <br/>
dwarven axes can be found rarely on the Lord at crushbone. These axes have a <br/>
damage of 14 and a delay of 43. They are non-magical but are very efficient.<br/>
Polished Granite Tomahawk<br/>
Nice magic 1H Slashing weapon found in High Pass Hold. It has a damage of 6 <br/>
with only a 26 delay, as well as occasionally casting &#39;Berserker Strength&#39; <br/>
on the wielder, giving +18 Str bonus, -10 Agility penalty, and a 50 to 150 <br/>
hit point damage shield.<br/>
Tentacle Whip<br/>
Tentacle Whips has 4 dmg and 25 delay and can be found on Tentacle Terrors. <br/>
Tentacle Whips are often used by mid-teen level characters, as a second <br/>
weapon, because of its magical nature. Lifetap drains hit points from the <br/>
monster and gives them to the wielder.<br/>
Minotaur Axe<br/>
Minotaur axes can be found on the minotaurs of Steamfont and Beholder. They <br/>
are better than store bought weapons and thus are a favorite amongst level <br/>
8-15 characters. Minotaur axes pack 8 damage into 37 delay. They are <br/>
non-magical and are a bit on the heavy side.<br/>
Oaken Scimitar<br/>
The Oaken Scimitar is probably the best scimitar in the game. Great weapons <br/>
made for druids. It offers +9 to wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
2-Handed Slashing<br/>
Bone Bladed Claymore<br/>
The Bone Bladed Claymore is a magical two handed slashing weapon that is <br/>
found on the final shadowknight in Befallen. I don&#39;t have the stats on me <br/>
off hand(they changed since I last had it) but it is a very good weapon for <br/>
two-handed wielders in the 20-30 level range. The disadvantage is that it <br/>
carries with it a negative adjustment to your agility score. It grants a <br/>
damage of 17 a delay of 45 but penalizes you by -8 to your agility.<br/>
Dark Reaver<br/>
The dark reaver is a powerful Shadowknight only sword. It has a damage of 20 <br/>
and a delay of 42. It also has a strength-sapping spell, which will go off <br/>
from time to time.<br/>
Executioner&#39;s Axe<br/>
The executioner&#39;s axe is a powerful warrior only 2 handed axe. It has a <br/>
damage of 25 and a delay of 50. The most important strength of this axe <br/>
however is the haste effect that goes off from time to time. When this <br/>
effect goes off you will begin to hit extremely fast.<br/>
Giant Hzweihander<br/>
This powerful 2 handed slashing weapon can be found on Karg Icebear in <br/>
Everfrost. It has a damage of 18 and a delay of 39.<br/>
Opal Scythe<br/>
This scythe can be found on Lord Grimrot in South Karana. It is a warrior <br/>
and shadowknight only 2 handed slashing weapon. Damage is 11, delay is 45. <br/>
It has an innate disease cloud spell as well as appearing to have a strength <br/>
tapping effect when wielded by Grimrot himself (although it does not appear <br/>
on the weapons list of effects).<br/>
Shiny Brass Halberd<br/>
This halberd can be found off a rare pop orc in High Hold Pass. This magical <br/>
two-handed slashing weapon has a damage of 16 and a delay of 48.<br/>
Silvery Two Handed Axe<br/>
This 2 handed slashing weapon can be found in Permafrost. It has a damage of <br/>
17 and a delay of only 48.<br/>
<br/>
