I have found the Karanas an excellent place to solo, as a level 18 myself. North Karana has lots of borer and Scythe Beetles and Griffawns to take on, (still havent managed to do a Griffawn myself without lay hands yet).  In East Karana there are lots of blue baddies, from Griff&#39;s to gorge hounds to Chasam crawlers. I hope this helps you out.<br/>

  Where is a good place for a 18th lvl paladin to go solo blues? I have travelled<br/>
  some and cant find a place that is either WAY to crowded or that you MUST have a<br/>
  group to survive the trains. I am on the MM server and am currently in Freeport.<br/>
  ANy and all help is appreciated as I am starting to get bored and want to keep<br/>
  playing. Thanks all.<br/>
