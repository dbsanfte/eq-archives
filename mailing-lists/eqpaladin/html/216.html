<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-794179676">I chose to be a paladin because I have always sided with good, (my friends<br/>
and I are always argueing on who is better the rebels or the imperials in<br/>
Star Wars) Also the ability to LOH is nice, and the ability to turn the<br/>
undead is great (ward). The dark side just has never appelaed to me.<br/>
