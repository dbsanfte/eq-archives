&gt;The quest regarding Zimel has officially been noted as broken by the GM&#39;s <br/>
&gt;as of late, but i have found yet another clue regarding this Holy Sword <br/>
&gt;quest. I recently spoke with a prisoner of the Freeport Milita, appatently <br/>
&gt;he has been beaten or drugged senseless, but When I mentioned the name of <br/>
&gt;the infamous Zimel to him, he looked deep into my eyes with understanding ( <br/>
&gt;A prisoner gazes deep into your eyes (kinda eerie) When I mentioned the <br/>
&gt;Sword of his Creation, this prisoner said something gutteral, his words <br/>
&gt;were &quot;nnnn... Girkle.... Grunk.... Shoo Bog n&#39; Goo&quot;. He did not respond to <br/>
&gt;anything else, only the name Zimel and the sword Soulfire. Maybe we are all <br/>
&gt;going the wrong way in the search for Zimel, maybe the one underground is A <br/>
&gt;fake.... and Maybe if you kill the Prison guards....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also in my Travels for the Test of truth, I gave a tunic to Altunic, and he <br/>
&gt;said that I was too weak for him to talk to me.....<br/>
