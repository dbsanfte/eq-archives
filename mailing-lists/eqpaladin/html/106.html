&gt; I made a Paladin again last night, I had one that made it to level 5 then I<br/>
&gt; deleted him because I couldn&#39;t make any exp, and I realized once I hit level<br/>
&gt; 4 that I might not put enough points into Wisdom to be able to cast all the<br/>
&gt; spells when I first get them.  I had this same problem with my SK where I<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t able to cast 2 of my spells until level 11.  This was one of the<br/>
&gt; reasons why I quit playing him, the other because I like to explore and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; very difficult when you&#39;re a huge Troll.  So, I was wondering if 90 Wisdom<br/>
&gt; is enough to be able to cast all the spells when I get them.  I&#39;m really<br/>
&gt; afraid of playing this character up to level 50 and still not be able to<br/>
&gt; cast Revive(49) or something to that effect.  My race is a Dwarf if that<br/>
&gt; effects it. Thanks.<br/>
