<br/>
I have been around since P3 but I haven&#39;t really made many characters<br/>
originating in Freeport, as Tunare often beckoned me to be a High Elf. <br/>
<br/>
My new half-elf paladin last night could not for the life of him find a bag<br/>
or box merchant in the town anywhere.  I mean the one that sells purses and<br/>
belt pouches, not the backpack at a guild vendor or the large bag at the<br/>
docks.  Anyone know if the bag/box merchant exists in FP?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I know that in Felwithe there are red wooden shields which are very<br/>
striking and different looking than the normal round or targ ones.  Has<br/>
anyone seen these for sale in Freeport either?</div>
