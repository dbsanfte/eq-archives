<br/>
In an attempt to get a bit more conversation going, I&#39;m going to ramble on<br/>
about a few things I&#39;ve learned as a level 13 Paladin of Mithaniel Marr,<br/>
based in Freeport, Cazic-Thule server, Retail Version &lt;g&gt;. I&#39;ve yet to find<br/>
a truly comprehensive Quest listing...any suggestions? Various topics here,<br/>
so if you find any you want to discuss... go for it. :)  (You might want to<br/>
only quote parts you wish to respond to - proper netiquette and all)<br/>
<br/>
Hotkeys:<br/>
They appear to be underused by some players. I have three &quot;major&quot; ones, a<br/>
Help U?, a Help!, and a Danger!. Respectively, I offer aid, ask for<br/>
assistance, and alert people of trouble (like a nearby Griff or Giant -<br/>
they plague my homeland). You can create these buttons at your leisure, and<br/>
phrase them in your best roleplayese. People that run into killstealers<br/>
often can program a suitably snarky phrase... Such hotkeys help immensely,<br/>
since you can pop out applicable phrases at a moment&#39;s notice. You can help<br/>
out others - and maybe even save your own life... (If you don&#39;t, well, some<br/>
people like the /loc as a button for corpse location...). Other options - a<br/>
Battlecry and an Insult to use while Taunting - just for the fun of it. And<br/>
that&#39;s why we&#39;re all playing EQ, right?<br/>
<br/>
Re: Freeport search for holy sword<br/>
I&#39;ve tried a lot of variations on asking Rashinda for information - no luck<br/>
so far. Anyone have a tried-and-true phrase for learning more?<br/>
<br/>
Other quests in Freeport:<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten two from the Marr Clerics (Piranha and the Potion, and the<br/>
duplicate Helm quest - but with a spellcasting as a bonus!), Paladin quests<br/>
for the Reef Shark skins, Militia helm, and the Message - but not the Token<br/>
quest (by the time I got the phrasing right, I was apparently too<br/>
advanced). In addition, I have the Deathfist quest from the Steel Warriors,<br/>
and will try to get the one from the finger-wigglers for those cantrips as<br/>
well (if I ever remember to!)<br/>
<br/>
Quests in RiverVale:<br/>
Goblin/Warbead from the Sheriff, Piranha from the Merchie, the Scarecrow.<br/>
<br/>
Note in travelling Kithicor Forest:<br/>
I&#39;ve never run into anything scary by staying on the path...stay to the<br/>
right coming from the West Commons, left coming from the hobbithole. (Is<br/>
there a quest for the Shalrok Orcs?) <br/>
<br/>
Note on Runnyeye Citadel:<br/>
Stick to the right side from Misty Thicket, left coming from the Maze/Gorge.<br/>
<br/>
Travelling East and West Commons:<br/>
Stay on the South Mountain range, high up, if you don&#39;t want to interact<br/>
with the critters. For those of you not from the area, the dungeon entrance<br/>
to Befallen (stuffed with evil Undead types that offend my Paladin senses)<br/>
is in West Commons...and there&#39;s a nasty Dark Elf NPC named Kizdean Gix who<br/>
hangs out by the eastern Inn (east side, usually) that attacks our kind on<br/>
sight... East Commons has a tunnel passage to the North Ro desert on the<br/>
south mountainside; the north range has an entrance to the Nektulos Forest<br/>
(you might not want to attract the attention of the Guards there if you<br/>
aren&#39;t looking for a fight).<br/>
<br/>
Squire Narls:<br/>
I can&#39;t say he poses too much of a threat above L10; I&#39;ve seen weaker<br/>
fellows than me lop him. Typically the adventurers in EC cheer when you<br/>
kill him, since he spams the whole zone while shouting for Altunic. Which<br/>
quest is he part of?<br/>
 <br/>
Combat Skills:<br/>
I&#39;ve gone 1H Slashing and Shield, because this way I can use the secondary<br/>
combat skill (Bashing). Two handed weapons precludes use of that skill, and<br/>
since Paladins aren&#39;t loaded up with Kick (as a secondary attack)or Dual<br/>
Wield (a separate weapon in other hand), I think this is a good way to go.<br/>
Comments? (Once I get the Hammer of Wrath, I suspect I&#39;ll play with that<br/>
(1H Blunt) for use in emergency situations). Although we do get Parry and<br/>
Risposte, the only real decsion is one or two handed, slashing or blunt,<br/>
and I hate to see the shield Bash be unused. (However, as far as unused<br/>
skills go, Bind Wounds is essentially useless for Paladins - why pay all<br/>
that money for bandages when you can med and heal instead? Mages should<br/>
bind wounds, since they get the &quot;free&quot; summoned bandages!). Shields do give<br/>
an extra armor boot, too...<br/>
<br/>
Fast Weapons versus Slow Weapons:<br/>
Minotaur Axe, or Combine Scimitar? Over the same period of time, these<br/>
cause very close to the same maximum damage... but Mino Axes are easier to<br/>
come by (haven&#39;t gotten ahold of Dwarven Axe yet). The CScimitar is<br/>
magickal (especially useful against those Invulnerable undead types) and<br/>
hits more often (highly useful against spellcasters; with it and Bash it<br/>
makes it easier to disrupt potentially painful spells). Mino Axes have more<br/>
impressive single strikes; only useful if an opponent&#39;s armor can<br/>
completely absorb lesser blows (as I&#39;ve heard people say). However, I&#39;ve<br/>
yet to see any such thing... Combine Long Sword does a tiny bit more damage<br/>
than Combine Scimitar in the long run (1%), but the extra speed also helps<br/>
in situations such as when an enemy disengages (just to come back and swipe<br/>
at you when your back is turned).<br/>
<br/>
Trade Skills:<br/>
Anyone played much with these? I Tailored at low level to make up my own<br/>
set of Patchwork armor, but I&#39;m beyond that now (replacing Leather with<br/>
better at the moment). Wouldn&#39;t dream of Begging. Can&#39;t see going into<br/>
learning to create Studded, etc Leather when Pals can wear metal stuff.<br/>
Jewelry isn&#39;t too worthwhile unless you have an Enchanter buddy, I&#39;m happy<br/>
eating muffins (6 cp) and milk (5 cp) (mmmMMMmm...muffins....armmfumfumf)<br/>
so I don&#39;t feel I need Baking (unless they have a poofy hat and apron with<br/>
a stupid saying on it for roleplaying purposes), and I can&#39;t picture myself<br/>
as a Paladin playing in the mud for Pottery (&quot;You broke my teacup, evil<br/>
one! Now you must die!&quot;). Fletching is useless to a profession that spurns<br/>
the bow, drunken Paladins (or those selling the stuff to locals) might give<br/>
us all a bad name, so we&#39;re left with Smithing. Useful, but is that our<br/>
only &quot;logical&quot; choice? I have skill points saved up, but I&#39;m not convinced<br/>
where to spend them yet. I Fish when able to in the lakes and oceans. Am I<br/>
limited to Piscatorial Pursuits as a noble Paladin? (Although I rather do<br/>
enjoy fishing, relaxing between bouts of zombie-bashing).<br/>
<br/>
Containers:<br/>
Backpacks hold more, but Large Bags weigh considerably less and hold quite<br/>
a bit as well. This is useful if you have a tendency to become encumbered<br/>
by all those rusty weapons out there...you can have the same carrying<br/>
capacity with 4 LBags as with 3 Backpacks, but you&#39;re not carrying as much<br/>
starting weight... I also keep containers in the bank to stash whatever I<br/>
feel has some value, but not as deadweight while adventuring.<br/>
<br/>
Zoning:<br/>
Very useful for saving your life, but there are disadvantages to this<br/>
technique: zone areas are usually crowded with other players doing the same<br/>
thing. There could be a lot of competition for kills, or even killstealing<br/>
- very annoying. In addition, people in over their heads often lead a<br/>
&quot;Train&quot; of nasties to the zone; especially painful if the train is<br/>
unannounced and you&#39;re already fighting or injured. In confined spaces,<br/>
this often spells trouble (try walking through the Ro tunnel and being<br/>
confronted with a ghoul train, or entering Befallen and getting stunned by<br/>
Gynok Moltor, a most unpleasant surprise).<br/>
<br/>
Random acts of kindness:<br/>
I can&#39;t help but heal an injured adventurer, epecially when I&#39;m at full<br/>
mana and health while travelling from point to point. Naturally, a troll<br/>
attacking an Innkeeper doesn&#39;t warrant my aid, but I like helping out the<br/>
less advanced - especially since they&#39;re likely to be the ones I&#39;ll be<br/>
selling my obsolete equipment to in the future. No, but really, I just do<br/>
it for altruistic reasons... it&#39;s good karma.<br/>
<br/>
Advantages and disadvantages:<br/>
We can&#39;t create our own food and drink, or forage for it, when out on the<br/>
road a while. Not too many combat skills when you consider we usually end<br/>
up tanking and filling the warrior role, especially at lower levels. No<br/>
earth-shattering spells, pets to do our bidding, tracking, archery,<br/>
teleportation or extraordinary movement abilities. However, we make decent<br/>
between-battle healers, with respectable buffs at L 15, and can cure posion<br/>
and those annoying diseases. Lay Hands is a great last-moment &quot;save&quot; for<br/>
ourselves or our party members. Armor options are virtually limitless, and<br/>
some day I expect to have one of those legendary Holy Swords.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest advantage, of course, is that Paladins lend themselves really<br/>
well to roleplaying - if you develop a reputation for being a trustworthy,<br/>
competent Paladin who works for the good of a party, you won&#39;t ever have a<br/>
problem getting a group together or finding a friend to adventure with.<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s always some evil out there, waiting to be vanquished...<br/>
<br/>
Fare well!<br/>
