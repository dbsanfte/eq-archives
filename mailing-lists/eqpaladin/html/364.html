<b>Subject:</b> should we have to kill a fellow paladin for a sword?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-406670433">Hail!! I am just looking for opinions on why you think Verant would put<br/>
Ghoulsbane on a paladin NPC. As far as I know, the Froglok King is a good<br/>
paladin and in order for us to obtain the Ghoulsbane, we have to kill him.<br/>
In a role-playing sense, that is making a RPer make a tough decision. Stay<br/>
in role and go without a powerful sword or just kill the big frog not caring<br/>
about what a paladin stands for.<br/>
