<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839224637">Last night, another paladin, a warrior and myself were camping in the east<br/>
commonlands near one of the orc Centurion camps.  We killed a large number<br/>
of the evil beasts and were rewarded with a great number of Deathfist Belts.<br/>
However, another side effect is that whenever I personally finished off an<br/>
orc, my standing would get better with the Knights of Truth and the common<br/>
peoples and such.  How can you tell what your standing with the guild is?  I<br/>
went back to the Hall of Truth and considered everybody and talked to a<br/>
number of the npc&#39;s at the Hall of Truth.  I also checked the prices they<br/>
offered me for my goods and the prices of the items they had.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>
detect any changes.  How can you tell if your standing has gotten better?<br/>
And how many times do you have to kill orcs to bring about a change?<br/>
