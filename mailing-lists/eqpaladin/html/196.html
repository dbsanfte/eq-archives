<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792080102">You or another member of your guild could also start your own smith.  If<br/>
all of you supported your smith by buying supplies for him I think he<br/>
would advance quickly to where you need him.  Then when they are good<br/>
they can make you all armor for free to pay you back but also can sell<br/>
to players outside your guild for fair prices.<br/>
<br/>
Unless of course APEC (armor producing enriched characters) doesn&#39;t put<br/>
your new smith under their spell and concince him to sell at their<br/>
inflated prices...  hehe<br/>

Dear Fellow Paladins:<br/>
<br/>
I am presently on the Innoruuk server and spend most of my time near<br/>
Freeport and the surrounding zones.  My question to you all is, what are<br/>
you<br/>
paying for armor?  All the blacksmiths in my area have formed some kind<br/>
of<br/>
price guild and all charge basically the same price for banded armor.  I<br/>
realize this is supposed to be free enterprise and let the people set<br/>
the<br/>
prices but we are getting price fixing on my server.  I had a friend on<br/>
another server tell me not to pay more than 25 plat for a Banded Tunic,<br/>
but<br/>
the cheapest any of the blacksmiths (I have checked with 3 different<br/>
smiths<br/>
at different times of the day) will sell the tunic for on the Innoruuk<br/>
server is 35 plat.  What do all of you pay?  I have tried to negotiate<br/>
with<br/>
each blacksmith, offering my pledge of allegiance to him, but to no<br/>
avail. I<br/>
have just been a part of forming a guild so I am thinking about having<br/>
my<br/>
guild only deal with one smith if we can find one who will give us a<br/>
break.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are your experiences in this area?  Are any of you on the Innoruuk<br/>
server?  I am going to try and go to some different areas like<br/>
Butcherblock<br/>
and such to see if I can find any less expensive blacksmiths.  Now,<br/>
before<br/>
some blacksmiths email me and tell me how hard it is to get up your<br/>
level in<br/>
smithing, and how much it costs, I know.  I understand.  I just don&#39;t<br/>
like<br/>
price fixing. I would rather negotiate and barter with each guy<br/>
independently, rather than get a set price with no negotiation.<br/>
<br/>
Please give me your feedback.<br/>
<br/>
