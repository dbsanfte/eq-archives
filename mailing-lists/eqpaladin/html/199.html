<b>Subject:</b> bone baded claymore <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425111148">I have been reading a lot lately about the bone bladed claymore, and I have<br/>
actually been hunting for it.  However, I have noticed that the paladin<br/>
class is very often mentioned along with the bone bladed.  I am not aware of<br/>
it being a paladin only sword, and the various web sites do not mention it<br/>
as such.  Can someone who has actually wielded the sword give clarity to the<br/>
issue?<br/>
 <br/>
Also, I see a lot of paladins wielding 1h swords and a shield.  Seriously<br/>
consider the benefits of 2handed weapons.  I was fortunate enough to get the<br/>
2H Dwarven Axe (14 damage, 43 delay).  And at level 12, I do 29 points of<br/>
damage a round.  Delay is a factor, but consider it very closely.  Exactly<br/>
how much faster is a weapon of 32 delay compared to 43 delay.  What do those<br/>
11 points mean in terms of combat?  Paladins have very good defense with no<br/>
armor restrictions, and healing (which can actually be done in combat if<br/>
timed right).  Consider that Verant has balanced paladins with paladin only<br/>
offensive items, I have not heard of a paladin only armor yet.  I think that<br/>
paladins are natural tanks, because of the number of hit points that we can<br/>
generate, but great offense compliments great defense.  Consider upping your<br/>
offense with a good 2 hander.<br/>
