<b>Subject:</b> Current Holyswords list as of 09/14/99 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-283146921">As requested, I am posting the Current Holyswords List once again.  There<br/>
really isn&#39;t that much new.  There were rumors of two new Holy Swords that I<br/>
added.  I know there have been a few items considered &quot;Holy Weapons&quot; that were<br/>
Paladin AND Cleric.  I am sure I don&#39;t have all of these listed, so if someone<br/>
wants to add them to the list or e-mail them to me and i will do it.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  If any of the information below is inaccurate in any way post an<br/>
update, or send it directly to me and I will repost this message.<br/>
<br/>
Man-o-War (Confirmed!)<br/>
Skill:  2H Blunt<br/>
Atk Delay: 41<br/>
DMG: 19<br/>
Effect: Chaotic Feedback<br/>
WT: 9.0<br/>
Class PAL<br/>
Race: ALL<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Brilliant Sword of Faith (Confirmed!)<br/>
Quest Item<br/>
Damage: 20<br/>
Delay: 44<br/>
Type: 2H Slashing<br/>
Effects: +50 mana<br/>
Location:  You must kill Lucan and return his testimony to the head of the<br/>
Paladin Guild in Freeport.  He does not drop the testimony every time.<br/>
Note:  This sword is required to get SoulFire.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Brilliant Sword of Truth&quot; (NEW)<br/>
This was one of two rumored newly found holy swords.  It is in fact just the<br/>
BSoF, but someone got the name wrong.  So unfortunately nothing new here.<br/>
<br/>
Pearl Bladed Claymore (May also be called Shiny Bladed Claymore)<br/>
Damage:  17<br/>
Delay:  40<br/>
Type: 2H Slashing<br/>
Weight:  10.0<br/>
Note:   Not sure if this is actually a holy sword or not, it was marked<br/>
as being a Paladin only sword, on the Everlore site (http://www.everlore.com).<br/>
 Possibly retrieved from mistmoore.  A<br/>
person, reported from beta, wielding it was doing damage in the 60&#39;s and<br/>
70&#39;s to undead.  The name could have been shiny  bladed claymore. <br/>
Update!  No one has seen any evidence of this sword since Beta.  It may<br/>
have been removed or renamed and made non-class specific.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Shiny Brass Claymore&quot; (New)<br/>
Once again this name appears in the rumor mill.  When this list originally<br/>
formed we had rumors of this sword, but no proof.  It is very likely that this<br/>
sword was, or is the same as the Pearl Bladed Claymore, which is also just a<br/>
rumor now.  A while ago someone claimed seeing a weapon with a similar name in<br/>
Beta.  Most likely if it ever did exist it was changed, name an all.<br/>
<br/>
Ghoulbane (Confirmed!)<br/>
Pending Lore Item<br/>
Damage: 15<br/>
Delay: 34<br/>
Type: 1H Slashing<br/>
Effect: Dismiss Undead, Acts as a light source comparable to a<br/>
lightstone.<br/>
Weight: 9.5<br/>
Located:  It is located in Upper Guk, on the Shin Lord.<br/>
Note:  Both the Shin Lords respawn rate, and the respawn rate of the<br/>
weapon are very low, so it may take quite a bit of time to get the<br/>
weapon. Level needed to obtain:  Full group as low as 28th.  Full group<br/>
in early 30&#39;s to be safe.  If you use the weapon at lower than 20th<br/>
level you will get the message &quot;You do not have the will to command this<br/>
weapon&quot; when it tries to activate dismiss undead.  You have to kill a<br/>
Froglok Paladin to get this sword.  Possibly a quest sword and the quest<br/>
is broken.<br/>
<br/>
Fiery Avenger<br/>
Quest item<br/>
Damage: 35<br/>
Delay: 48<br/>
Type: 2H Slashing<br/>
Effects:  Inferno Shock<br/>
Note:  There is very little information on this sword, other than it was<br/>
2H, and at one point during the Beta they made it available to all<br/>
classes to test it (and show it off).  At the moment it is believed to<br/>
be 35 Damage and 45 Speed, which would make learning that 2H Slash well<br/>
worth it.  It is also understood that his is a quest item, but for what<br/>
guild, or from what NPC I don&#39;t know. <br/>
Update!  It has been said that the great Fiery Avenger is not currently<br/>
available to players, and that it is only a GM toy.  Will this change in the<br/>
update?  Who knows.  Of course, this is not official, and pretty much never<br/>
will be until we actually see the sword in a player&#39;s hand since Varrant isn&#39;t<br/>
likely to give too much info on this topic.<br/>
Also, it is very likely that this weapon will NOT be a holy sword.  If we are<br/>
lucky, it will be available to all fighter classes.<br/>
<br/>
SoulFire (Confirmed!)<br/>
Magic Item, Lore Item, No Drop<br/>
Charges:  5<br/>
Damage: 23<br/>
Delay: 45<br/>
STR:  +7, WIS:  +7<br/>
Effect:  Complete Healing<br/>
Type: 2H Slashing<br/>
Weight: 5.0<br/>
Located:  You are given SoulFire by Brother Hayle is Splitpaw after you<br/>
give him the note that he gives you back, your Testimony of Truth, the<br/>
Brilliant Sword of Faith, and SoulFires Hilt  (Glowing Sword Hilt).  A<br/>
complete walk-through of the SoulFire quest is available separately.<br/>
