 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t agree with you my friend. I have a really good example on the PvP<br/>
server (Rallos Zek). When trolls, ogres and dark elves begin a war against<br/>
Freeport, they speak Dark Speech. It can be very important to understand<br/>
them during the battle to know their plans.<br/>
But it&#39;s true that I don&#39;t have any example on other servers, except for<br/>
role play.<br/>
