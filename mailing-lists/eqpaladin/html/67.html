<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432994454">If I want to start blacksmithing, I was told to start on Rusty daggers. Do<br/>
I just combineone with a sharpening stone in a forge? I tried it one and<br/>
it told me my skill was not good enough, but when I tried it 2, 3, 4, 5,<br/>
and 6th times it said that &quot;those materials in those quanitites (1 dagger,<br/>
one stone) was not enough to produce anything. Did  I miss a step? <br/>
