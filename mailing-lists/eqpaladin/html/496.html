&gt; For the many Knights out there who have completed the Test of Truth in<br/>
&gt; Freeport, you know that the reward for this quest is your Testimony of<br/>
&gt; Truth.  For most of us, we just stuck this piece of paper in the bank<br/>
&gt; and that was it.  Sure, we now know we are Knights, a title I wish we<br/>
&gt; could wear more obviously.  But since the GMs have still not granted our<br/>
&gt; requests to add the Sir to our names, we have to do what we can with it. </span></blockquote></div>
