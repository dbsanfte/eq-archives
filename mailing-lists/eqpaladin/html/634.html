Cleric&#39;s list it&#39;s going to cost upward of 2k pp to get the cleric armor.<br/>
Give it some time before you go off ranting.<br/>

&gt;Fucking shit so paladins got screwed again huh?<br/>
&gt;No other class has to smith their armor, and my smithing skill is 0, damn<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m gonna burn down Verant if this means I will have to become a master<br/>
smith, it ain&#39;t right!! :( Crafted armor is easy to get compared to what<br/>
this sounds like.. Hatur huh? I have NEVER seen him and I spent almost 10<br/>
levels in oasis, I never even heard of him except in some rumor loooooong<br/>
ago..<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I thought it was to replace rubicite, but rubicite sounds alot easier to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>get than this.. BULLSHIT VERANT!!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh well maybe we can give the molds to an NPC to do the work, that would be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>better, but I sure as hell hope we dont have to go off chasing some special<br/>
metal TOO, why did they make paladin armor so much harder to get? It better<br/>
be damn good compared to the other classes armor!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;(Btw I have spent 200h+ in upper guk the past month camping ghoulbane, I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have had some SERIOUS bad luck I guess because I don&#39;t have one yet)<br/>

&gt;&gt; there isnt a lvl requirement to get to temple I dont believe..all you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>need to do is get to lavastorm mts..the entrance to temple is directly<br/>
across from Sol A/B entrances. its neat to go through..dont hail the efreet<br/>
what ever you do..Paladin quests start in rathe mts at a paladin<br/>
camp..(looks like a carnival gathering) at loc 3000, neg 900 If I remember<br/>
right..Basically a NPC from the different paladin guilds felwithe/qeynos/two<br/>
in freeport/deepwater etc..will talk to you..you need to go ask each of the<br/>
respective guilds &quot;Am I honored member?&quot; if you faction is good enough they<br/>
will tell you and you can proceed..the items required are somewhat hard to<br/>
get..one is kajji plans from Hatur in Oasis..I have only seen that named SG<br/>
once in all my playing..then when you get the items you just get a<br/>
mold..plus there is talk that you need a special metal to craft the armor<br/>
and only this master smith in the temple knows recipe but wont say if you<br/>
faction with 415 (I think it is) isnt h!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; !<br/>
&gt;&gt; igh enough..so it sounding like you will need to smith these items<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yourself since molds are no drop..there is talk you are to give to master<br/>
smith but being as no one has done this on my server (or at least to my<br/>
knowledge)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; it is unknown yet..all in all a very hard quest..but it keep us paladins<br/>
 </span></blockquote>humble =)<br/>
