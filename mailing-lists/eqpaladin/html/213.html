&gt; Well, my question has incited some postings and that is what i had hoped<br/>
&gt; for. This list is kinda on the quiet side and i was hoping to help incite<br/>
&gt; some life into it.  If something interesting happened to you on day while<br/>
&gt; playing or you ran across something cool or you just have a<br/>
question...share<br/>
&gt; it with all here. I myself like hearing about someone&#39;s interesting<br/>
&gt; experience as I might learn something from it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, i forgot to tell why I chose a paladin. To me, a paladin is like a<br/>
&gt; knight in shining armor.... swooping in to save the day and all that. They<br/>
&gt; are like a super-hero. Me, i like sharing and helping others and most<br/>
expect<br/>
&gt; a paladin to do just that . I want to be that knight coming to save the<br/>
&gt; day.. fight against insurmountable odds so your friends can live to fight<br/>
&gt; another day. I chose Half-Elf because high elves and Erudites are too<br/>
&gt; conceited, Dwarves are too short(no offense intended) and I play a human<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; RL.<br/>
