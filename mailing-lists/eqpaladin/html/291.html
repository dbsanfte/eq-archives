<div id="ygrps-yiv-535329547">This post comes from the cleric mailing, but it is a pretty good analysis of<br/>
tanking and hit point optimization.  Lemac makes some excellent points that<br/>
you should really consider.  I would like to add to Lemac&#39;s discussion,<br/>
however.  Use the warriors berserk ability, which kicks in at 2 bubbles of<br/>
health.  Depending on your battle, let your warrior berserk while your 2nd<br/>
tank takes the damage (you gotta have pretty brave tanks, but a tank lacking<br/>
in bravery is like putting an elevator in an outhouse, it just doesnt make a<br/>
whole lot of sense).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to see that some clerics are thinking about how to keep us alive.<br/>

&gt; rather than 1 -200hp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any thoughts on this from anyone else?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Acually that is not entirely correct... It would be at the END of the<br/>
battle, but not during the battle... You see DURING the battle, if you have<br/>
2 tanks fighting, they are both EARNING or HEALING at the rate of 1HP per<br/>
round (I think) - Multiply this times the number of tanks (2) ... But if one<br/>
is Full HP, he is not earning a thing, so you are really only getting 1 HP<br/>
per round... Now, if the MOB is concentrating on the one tank, he will be<br/>
going down and down and down because he is healing 1HP per round but<br/>
probably taking hits for 1+ each round....<br/>
<br/>
With 2 tanks trading off, when one gets down a bubble, the other starts<br/>
taking the damage... Then you have TWO HP per round (without healing) being<br/>
generated by your group.  Gives the first tank a chance to actually INCREASE<br/>
his HP instead of it going down... This saves you mana right there..<br/>
<br/>
Also at the END of battle when you have two tanks both down, lets say 2<br/>
bubbles each, you can heal them each ONE time (two total heals) up to, say<br/>
4.5 bubbles full and they can heal the rest of the way by sitting while you<br/>
are getting mana back... Again twice as fast as one tank healing himself...<br/>
Otherwise, you have one guy down FOUR bubbles and you have to heal him with<br/>
THREE Heals... and then EVERYONE still has to wait for you to get your mana<br/>
back, which is now 33% lower...<br/>
<br/>
Last night in our group we had two clerics, and by trading off on the heals<br/>
and being diligent enought to do 1-2 quick heals and med again DURING<br/>
battle, we were able to keep our tanks alive with some pretty HELLATIOUS Orc<br/>
tranes (RED ones!) in Oasis... They just kept coming and coming, and coming,<br/>
and still coming... we just kept healing, medding, healing, medding all the<br/>
while the tanks were fighting, fighting, trading, fighting... etc, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Worked out VERY well... we didn&#39;t die (although came close a few times -<br/>
thank Tunare for Zone Walls!) and only a couple of times did we zone because<br/>
BOTH clerics had run out of mana!  It was a glorious feeling let me tell<br/>
you!<br/>
<br/>
So, have the tanks trade off every few hits (so the mob doesn&#39;t pick on one<br/>
of them the whole time) AND the healers should be trading off between<br/>
healing and medding - You should NEVER be just standing there watching...<br/>
You should either be casting, fighting or medding... One of the three...<br/>
<br/>
But of course, all this is IMSO...<br/>
