<div id="ygrps-yiv-672282596">Yeah, when you get to the last (7th?) person, Sentry Warren I think will<br/>
tell you you will be looking for Guard Xyrin, and she&#39;s not on these lands.<br/>
You find out she&#39;s in the Ocean of Tears and it goes from there.<br/>
<br/>
Waiting for the boat makes this quest seem not worth it, but it depends on<br/>
what one gets out of it. =)<br/>

&gt; I started it but I never finished it. By the way, I should introduce<br/>
&gt; myself as well. I&#39;m Reppik on Bertoxxulous. I too am serving Erollisi Marr<br/>
&gt; and can usually be found in and around Freeport. I&#39;m only Lvl 7 at the<br/>
&gt; moment however.<br/>
&gt; As to the quest, I didn&#39;t even know that the quest took you out of<br/>
&gt; Freeport. I had to give up because I couldn&#39;t find anyone that would even<br/>
&gt; tell me about Xyrin.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to introduce myself.  My character rather. The name is<br/>
Tiresias,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and right now he&#39;s a level 14 Paladin on the Povar server.  You know...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Povar... You never heard of Povar?! =)  He serves Erollisi Marr 24/7.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; usually hangs around Freeport area... the commonlands, Desert of Ro, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Befallen, smiting evil and whatnot.  In any case...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was wondering if anyone did the quest to look for the last Guard Xyrin<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the quest that starts in the Temple of Marr.  Is that a beginner&#39;s quest<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; &gt; what?  Because I got as far as the isle in the Ocean of Tears talking to<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Holy Woman O&#39; Fun and I hear a scream come out of nowhere yearning<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; help, but I can&#39;t find where it&#39;s coming from!  The nearest islands have<br/>
&gt; &gt; goblins I&#39;m not sure I want to mess with... anybody do this one yet?<br/>
