<div id="ygrps-yiv-259486693">True the druid can &quot;sneak&quot; the paladin down and the paladin can &quot;hide&quot; in the &quot;safe&quot; corner while his friends do the work and then hand him a weapon he did nothing to earn, but any paladin worth a grain of salt who uses these techniques I don&#39;t feel they deserve one. First of all there is a sort of honor arranging the group, leading it in, and having an active party<br/>
work together with you contributing. Who needs it at lvl 17 anyways? You won&#39;t do max dmg till 20 and the effect won&#39;t work as well. There are many other fine weapons out there till then.  Second of all in my experience camping this thing, it can go bad very quick..people say you can stay in one room safely and keep a couple spawns controlled, but if you really want to live keep the whole area clean. Trust me it goes much better this way. Some people get lucky and get the sword right away..that has never been my experience as it is still not something I have obtained and i have tried many times. It&#39;s a long camp but it will be well worth it if you earn it.<br/>
