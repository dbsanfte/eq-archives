<div id="ygrps-yiv-341777101">One way I know of, not that this is the only way is to consider the target<br/>
of a faction.  For instance if you target someone and it says they look at<br/>
you amiably, then your standing with that particular faction is good.  If<br/>
they look at you dubiosly then well.. it&#39;s not so sure.<br/>

&gt;Last night, another paladin, a warrior and myself were camping in the east<br/>
&gt;commonlands near one of the orc Centurion camps.  We killed a large number<br/>
&gt;of the evil beasts and were rewarded with a great number of Deathfist<br/>

&gt;orc, my standing would get better with the Knights of Truth and the common<br/>
&gt;peoples and such.  How can you tell what your standing with the guild is?<br/>

&gt;number of the npc&#39;s at the Hall of Truth.  I also checked the prices they<br/>
&gt;offered me for my goods and the prices of the items they had.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;detect any changes.  How can you tell if your standing has gotten better?<br/>
&gt;And how many times do you have to kill orcs to bring about a change?<br/>
