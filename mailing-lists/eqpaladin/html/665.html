<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008253357">just wondering, are pallies kos in halls of honor?  it would make <br/>
sense that they aren&#39;t because many of the mobs there look like <br/>
pallies.  i have a 55th season paladin on terris-thule, she&#39;s working <br/>
on her hoh key now, just wondering if i should bother.</div>
