&gt;Subject: Freeport search for holy sword<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks to all who provided hints on the quest that begins with the<br/>
&gt;note to the agent in the militia.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Once I have tracked down the fellow that is supposed to have done<br/>
&gt;away with zimel, am I supposed to confront him?  or try and kill him<br/>
&gt;and take his sword?  if it is to be battle how high a level do I need<br/>
&gt;to be?  Or rather how strong is he?  so I can gather sufficient<br/>
&gt;allies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Well, Pietro Zarn, the fellow who presumably captured Zimel, is, shall<br/>
we say, a wee bit on the tough side.  I have seen a screenshot of Davidon<br/>
(Level 50 pally in beta) in a group taking him, presumably to get Soulfire,<br/>
but I wouldn&#39;t recommend you try for a while.  I made a throw away character<br/>
just to see how hard he hit, and, well, Zarn&#39;s damaged maxed at 147 dmg per<br/>
hit, plus double attack and any spells he decides to toss out.  For<br/>
reference, ice giants, who are supposed to be about level 40, max out at 110<br/>
dmg.  This has led many people to scratch thier heads as the Zimel&#39;s Blades<br/>
quest can only be started below level 9, and finished at level 40+. =)<br/>
    The thing is, while you cant get the Big Prize until late in the game, I<br/>
have a sneaking suspicion that there may be part you can do at the lower<br/>
level.  In beta, the quest worked somewhat differently.  You eventually<br/>
wound up giving Groflah the flier in the Seafarer&#39;s and he translated a code<br/>
making the flyer read &#39;Help captive&#39;, and he said that Zimel was surely<br/>
alive and being held captive in the city.  While Kalatrina doesnt appear<br/>
willing to give you the flier back after getting it from Alayle in retail,<br/>
if you catch Groflah in the Seafarer&#39;s and pump him for information about<br/>
Zimel, he&#39;ll tell you the story of how Zimel stole Soulfire from Zarn, and<br/>
how he fears that Zimel is being held captive somewhere in the city.  Now,<br/>
in beta, I must&#39;ve seached from one end of the city to the other, in all the<br/>
buildings, through all the sewers, everywhere.  I even tried the &#39;a<br/>
prisoner&#39;, who was in the jail beneath the Arena despite the unlikelyhood of<br/>
the Steel Warriors assisting the Dismal Rage in any way.  No go.  However,<br/>
I&#39;ve heard, but havnt gotten around to checking, that the sewers have been<br/>
somewhat filled out, and that there are actual mobs down there. (In p3 and<br/>
early p4 at the least, the sewers were completely empty.  You had the<br/>
guildmaster for the Dismal Rage, but absolutly nothing else)  I keep meaning<br/>
to go down there and search for Zimel, but I havnt had a chance yet.  Hope I<br/>
was of some help, or at least interest,<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
