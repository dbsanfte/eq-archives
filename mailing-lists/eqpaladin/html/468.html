 </span></blockquote>This is largely a semantic issue.  There are few facts<br/>
or actual stats that &#39;prove&#39; one is &#39;better&#39; than the<br/>
other.  Here are the facts that are known and<br/>
unbiased.<br/>
<br/>
Typically, 1H weapons have a lower delay than 2H<br/>
weapons.  This is significant because you&#39;ll swing<br/>
more often with a lower delay weapon (this is why<br/>
watching Monks fight can be rather stunning, because<br/>
fists have a very low delay in the combat system).  If<br/>
you&#39;re fighting something that you will miss often<br/>
against, you may want to swing more often (more<br/>
swings), because it gives you more opportunities to<br/>
connect even amid the misses.  In other words: if you<br/>
get 25 swings in a fight, and miss with half; you only<br/>
hit 12-13 times.  If, however, you get 40 swings in a<br/>
fight, you hit 20 times.  Sometimes, especially<br/>
against casters, this is vastly preferable.<br/>
<br/>
When comparing weapons, use the DD ratio (Damage to<br/>
Delay) to determine how they stack up against one<br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
On the low end, the weapons are rougly equal.  When<br/>
you start comparing various mid and high end weapons<br/>
of various sources and magicks, the ratios start to<br/>
diverge from one another.  For example, the famed<br/>
Warrior only Executioner Axe (2h-s) is 25/50 .500; a<br/>
*phenomonal* efficiency.  Ghoulbane (1h-s), Paladins<br/>
only, is 15-34 .411.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all hard fact.<br/>
<br/>
The murky part, subjective part, is the rest of it. <br/>
Some people just flat out like the &#39;sexy&#39; factor of<br/>
seeing a *big* number in the damage line when they see<br/>
one of their swings connect.  Others are simply<br/>
looking for a weapon that will deal out significant<br/>
damage over a series of swings.  The former look<br/>
almost exclusively at 2h, the latter at mostly 1h.<br/>
<br/>
Further, when using 2h, you give up a shield.  Not<br/>
only are you giving up the AC, but you also give up an<br/>
enchantment slot (like with the Darkwood&#39;s +9 STR, for<br/>
example), and as a Paladin, you give up your only<br/>
special attack (Bash).  Warriors are better equipped<br/>
to go with 2h because they retain Kick and (if large)<br/>
Slam.<br/>
<br/>
So, you have a lot to weigh.  An *excellent* low level<br/>
weapon, and a perfectly servicable mid level weapon is<br/>
one with a .200 - .300 ratio.  For example:<br/>
<br/>
FS (or Combine) Longsword = 6/28 .214<br/>
Minotaur Axe = 8/37 .216 (note Mino axe is 1/3rd<br/>
slower)<br/>
Dwarven 1h Axe = 6/26 .231 (faster than FS LS)<br/>
Barbed Leather Whip = 7/28 .250 (very fast, good<br/>
damage)<br/>
Demon Claw = 5/19 .263 (incredibly fast)<br/>
<br/>
*typically* (but not exclusively), Bash weapons (1h or<br/>
2H) tend to have lower efficiency ratios than<br/>
equilivant leveled weapons on the Slashing side. <br/>
Examples:<br/>
<br/>
Staff = 5/28 .179<br/>
Warhammer = 6/32 .188<br/>
Screaming Mace = 8/35 .229<br/>
Dwarven Warhammer = 8/33 .242<br/>
<br/>
So, with blunt, you&#39;ll usually work harder in the<br/>
fight.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, even as a dwarf, you&#39;re best served by<br/>
starting the level-capping of relevant weapons skills<br/>
now, as you go up.  Even if you don&#39;t &#39;finish&#39; capping<br/>
before you level again, keep working the skills you<br/>
choose to work up.  If you get behind by a few levels<br/>
in 2hs or 1hb or whatever while you&#39;re leveling up,<br/>
don&#39;t let it concern you overly; just keep switching<br/>
back to your primary after each level and capping that<br/>
out first, then going back to wherever you left off<br/>
the secondaries.  By the time you hit the double<br/>
digits (10+), your skills will catch up.  And it&#39;s far<br/>
easier to maintain for 5 points per level than it is<br/>
to train up 30 or 50 or whatever points after you find<br/>
a really great weapon that you want to start using.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
