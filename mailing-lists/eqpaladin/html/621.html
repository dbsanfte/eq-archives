<div id="ygrps-yiv-348690942">As far as the BIBS goes the knight isnt too hard he is 20ish I forget but there are a lot of dazed around 2 miners behind green crystals, 2 miners behind purple and usually 3 in the purple crystal room, thats not to mention that down the hall from purple room there are even more so if you are not careful you can get trained..it can get to be a rough area at 17 so bring a group that can handle it, you might want to fight just one or two dazed for now, see how your group handles them, and see what you are lacking, some people wait in the room..I waited on the bridge just outside and pulled spawns to it probably ethier way works, just keep spawns cleared because when they all jump you when you don&#39;t expect it that is what kills you.<br/>
Its a great weapon though, one of your best choices till GB if not that a silvery 2H or GZ is good too but those are a little harder.<br/>
Hope that helps<br/>
Keep up the good fight<br/>
