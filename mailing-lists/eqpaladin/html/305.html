&quot;By G&#39;Quon, I cannot remember the last time I was in a fight like that! No<br/>
moral ambiguity. No ancient and overpowering Enemy. They were, as you say,<br/>
the Bad Guys, and we were the Good Guys....and they made a very satisfying<br/>
*thump* when they hit the ground!&quot;<br/>

&gt; 	Could someone tell me the statistical benefit to being a high elf <br/>
&gt; paladin?  I don&#39;t mean the role-play benefits (yes I can also think of a few) <br/>
&gt; but the low strength and stamina seem like the exact opposite of what a <br/>
&gt; paladin would want.<br/>
