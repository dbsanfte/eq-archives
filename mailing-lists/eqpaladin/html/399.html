<div id="ygrps-yiv-717331999">This is to any low lvl paladin on the rathe server, I will pay 10 plat for<br/>
the first note that starts this quest. Being a High Elf, did not come to<br/>
freeport until about lvl 12. Also Sir would not work, because there are lady<br/>
Paladins too :P SO it would have to be either Sir or what ever would be the<br/>
proper termonology for a female paladin knight.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Your best bet if you can&#39;t start the quest is to ask a lower level Paladin<br/>
&gt; (under 9th) to get you the first note.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Test of Truth, a quest given by a Paladin behind the Hall of Truth, is<br/>
&gt; billed as one of the<br/>
&gt; most important quests in the game for a Paladin of that guild. This test,<br/>
&gt; however is rarely even<br/>
&gt; started on my server (Cazic-Thule) and on many others from the people I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; talked with. The<br/>
&gt; reason is the reward for the quest is not very well defined. First let me<br/>
 </span></blockquote>give<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you some basic<br/>
&gt; information on the quest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      What you join the Knights of Truth Paladin guild in Freeport you are<br/>
&gt; welcomed warmly, but you are made well aware that you are NOT a Knight<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yet.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You start as a squire, and upon asking the Knights you will find that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; one, and only one way to become a true Knight. And that is to complete the<br/>
&gt; Test of Truth. I won&#39;t spoil the entire quest, but it starts by bringing a<br/>
&gt; letter to Altunic Jartin, the roaming shield salesman in East Commonlands.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; quest is in two parts. At the completion of each part you receive a Token.<br/>
&gt; When you have both tokens you return them to the Knight who gave you the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>quest<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and this starts the actual Test of Truth. All of this information is given<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you vaguely when you first ask about the quest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please note that you cannot start this quest after 8th level!<br/>
&gt; Also, the quest is NOT BROKEN (it was fixed very soon after the release of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; game) but finding Altunic Jartin can be difficult as he moves around the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>zone.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;      Upon completion of the Test of Truth you are welcomed as a Knight and<br/>
&gt; given a note to prove  it. This is where I need the assistance of all<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Paladins<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in the Realm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Now that I (Vawhn on Cazic-Thule) have completed the quest and have<br/>
&gt; become a Knight, I<br/>
&gt; would expect to have a title to show it. I mean, I am a Knight, what else<br/>
&gt; (other than a holy sword and a trusty steed) could a Paladin ever want.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; did not get a title. In fact, other than the note, which I keep safely<br/>
 </span></blockquote>locked<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; away in the bank, I have no proof that I am a Knight at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      I have talked to a GM about this, and suggested that a Sir be added<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the beginning of my<br/>
&gt; name, or that be added to the end of my name (I preferred the Sir, and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>made<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that fact clear) and the GM really liked the idea. He said he would bring<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; up at their next meeting, and asked me to write a feedback detailing my<br/>
&gt; opinion and justification, which I did.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      I ask all of you to do the same, if you support my suggestion of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>course.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My justification was<br/>
&gt; simple (although I welcome any differing opinions, as I am sure the GMs<br/>
&gt; would). I have two<br/>
&gt; reasons for this request. First, I play a Paladin because I am playing a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>RPG,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and I like to play the character (as much if not more than to have the<br/>
&gt; abilities). For my character, what better way to show that I am eternally<br/>
&gt; dedicated to my code than to have my title displayed in my name for all to<br/>
&gt; see. The second reasoning is that (according to the game itself) 50% of<br/>
&gt; Everquest is the questing, and I found this quest a little, ok VERY<br/>
&gt; disappointing. If a quest existed that could make such a permanent and<br/>
&gt; profound change to a young Paladin, it would improve the questing at least<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Freeport (which for those of you who don&#39;t take the quests, there is a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>very<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; good story going on there).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Again, if you support this idea, please send a feedback (In Game)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your ideas and opinions.  The seed has already been planted, and Everquest<br/>
&gt; DOES LISTEN. I know this from personal experience. They just need to hear<br/>
&gt; about it from others, and hear about it often.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      No you just need your Trusty Steed and your Holy Sword. Good luck on<br/>
