<b>Subject:</b> Netmasters and faction with deepwater knights <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-121395541">Hail !<br/>
<br/>
I have the following problem. I hunted the netmasters for a long time and<br/>
when I had the 2 nets I tryed to turn them in to David in the paladin camp.<br/>
I first wanted to do it in wolf form because of the faction but I was<br/>
dubviosly to them that way. Since i am a HIE i am indif to them and so I<br/>
tryed it that way. Needless to say that it didnt work and I lost them both<br/>
(grrr).<br/>
<br/>
Looks like I have to raise my faction with them. Anyone knows a way to do<br/>
so? I know of the pearl of odus quest, but the problem with it is that my<br/>
faction is too low to start the quest and so it doesnt work (I trzed it to<br/>
be sure).<br/>
<br/>
I also tryed to kill the NPC swimmers (circle of unseen hand) there as<br/>
suggested elsewhere, but they dont raise faction with the knights.<br/>
<br/>
So if somebody can tell me a way to raise a HIE faction with them, i would<br/>
be very thankfull.<br/>
