<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267038202">Last week I submitted a dicussion about grouping for paladins.  I also<br/>
included a Cleric friend of mine who then forwarded it to his group.  I must<br/>
say, they responded a whole lot more than this list did.  In their responses<br/>
they offered some criticism, some praise, and some observations (they are<br/>
all included).  I thought I might try once more to encourage this type of<br/>
discussion with our mailing group.  I hear a lot of people say &#39;dump tank&#39;<br/>
comments.  Paladins are tanks, we do it better.  Do not be discouraged by<br/>
other classes who use warriors exclusively for tanking.  As we get better at<br/>
tanking as a class, the other classes will use us more.  First is the<br/>
original group discussion, then the comments..my friend cleric is named<br/>
Dallben, you&#39;ll see some of his comments as well.  Just because we tank,<br/>
doesnt mean we don&#39;t think.<br/>

Original post......<br/>
Leading...<br/>
Paladins are natural group leaders, most of the other classes are too busy<br/>
typing to direct combat, if you&#39;re a young paladin, try to group with a<br/>
higher level one, don&#39;t worry about not getting experience, just try to<br/>
watch how he/she leads a party.<br/>
<br/>
Hailing...<br/>
One technique that I have found really usefull is to ensure that you are<br/>
attacking the same monster. Sometimes you may want to attack a mob that you<br/>
can kill with one shot, just to get it off your back..but other times you<br/>
want everyone to attack the hardest hitting mob. What I do is hail the mob<br/>
that I am currently attacking. I train my party members to watch for the<br/>
hail and attack that same mob. Hail is better than a group tell because you<br/>
only have to target the mob and hit the &#39;h&#39; key. In heavy combat you may<br/>
want to hit &#39;h&#39; 4 or 5 times so that you can be sure they see it.<br/>
<br/>
Taunting...<br/>
As a tank, you must taunt the mobs off the other players, you may have to<br/>
switch your mob, taunt him, then switch back to the original mob. Don&#39;t<br/>
hail for this type of movement, since you want your party members to stay on<br/>
the big target. Use /assist playername for your clerics. Make sure you<br/>
tell the clerics to target the mob that is attacking them, otherwise /assist<br/>
is about as usefull as a solo bard. I hot key it...right click on any<br/>
social ability and change the script. I usually do a group tell saying who<br/>
I am assisting (mostly so the cleric doesn&#39;t freak out) and then /assist the<br/>
poor guy (hard code the players name, change it when you get in a new<br/>
party). Your goal as tank should be to have EVERY mob hitting you, don&#39;t<br/>
worry, you were created to take it, and your cleric was created to help.<br/>
Get your taunt skill up when you solo, and get a good weapon. Mobs tend to<br/>
turn to the guys that are wacking them the hardest, it&#39;s easier to taunt if<br/>
your doing some damage yourself. Mobs don&#39;t taunt off a player who is low<br/>
on hps (seems like about 2 bubbles). So tell them &#39;Back off&#39;, BEFORE 2<br/>
bubbles. Dont try to bash until everything is hitting you, I usually use a<br/>
2hander anyway, but thats up to you of course.<br/>
<br/>
Mana...<br/>
For pete&#39;s sake have your mana users in your group give you constant updates<br/>
on their mana, now I myself cannot stand being a pansy caster, but that is<br/>
their thing. If you go charging into battle without their mana being<br/>
sufficient, it&#39;s a damn shame. Paladins are warriors, our magic is not<br/>
combat magic, and you really shouldn&#39;t rely on healing yourself in combat<br/>
until level 15. After that, the number of hit points that a paladin can<br/>
generate are heads and tails above a same level warrior, thats why we tank,<br/>
get it? I use yaulp when everything is taunted on me, I notice I dont hit<br/>
harder but I connect more.<br/>
<br/>
Know your classes...<br/>
Geez, don&#39;t play anything but a paladin, but you have got to know the other<br/>
classes abilitites. I sometimes group tell... &#39;Cleric smite necro&#39; or &#39;Bard<br/>
str song&#39;. Don&#39;t worry about formulating sentences, but be clear and<br/>
concise.<br/>
<br/>
Lay on Hands...<br/>
I use lay on hands on myself as a last resort. The most gratifying thing<br/>
about lay on hands (loh)is using it on another party member, especially<br/>
those hard hitting wizards...Now you might think that the loh is your<br/>
ability and should be used to save your neck. I just dont think that,<br/>
besides if a wizard has mana, but no hit points he will do a hell of a lot<br/>
more good alive than a tank who is afraid to die. Listen young paladins,<br/>
tanks are meant to die, thats what we do. Every time I die in a group as<br/>
soon as I respawn I do a group tell, saying &#39;Tanks are meant to die, thats<br/>
what we do!&#39; If I die but my group members live, I celebrate. If my group<br/>
members die and I survive, I hang my head.<br/>
<br/>
Hope these tips help you.<br/>

Comment post from a cleric ......<br/>
<br/>
Dallben,<br/>
Your friend has some good advice, but as a person who plays a warrior tank<br/>
also, his tips are a bit skewed.<br/>
First, the job of the tank is to take the most damage, but not to die from<br/>
it. A better term would be damage coordinator. He takes damage ... gets low,<br/>
tells the others to rotate while he gets healed, etc... NOT to take any and<br/>
all damage until he dies trying to save the party. No matter how good the<br/>
rest of his party advice is (and it was all good besides that), this one<br/>
point made me shake my head. If any of you sees these actions, gently remind<br/>
your tank that his or her time would be better spent jumping off a high<br/>
cliff than having EVERY mob hitting him only. Three words for better group<br/>
combat .... SPREAD THE DAMAGE.<br/>
I once heard a role playing comment that paladins are so conceited, they<br/>
often don&#39;t even know you are there. Hate to say it but this sounds like it<br/>
fits the bill.<br/>
Just my two cents.<br/>

My response ......<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s getting quite a response on your mailing, my group hasn&#39;t said a word<br/>
about it :)<br/>
I&#39;ve been a tank for a long time, longer than most.  I was a tank for 65<br/>
days (over 1500 hours) on a mud.  I never play anything BUT a tank, I just<br/>
can&#39;t bring myself to do it.  Maybe it is conceit that yearns to be the only<br/>
one getting hit in combat, I guess I just consider it a role I serve.  There<br/>
are a couple good reason why the tanks should get EVERY monster hitting<br/>
them.  For one, we usually have the better ac and overall defense.  The<br/>
second reason deals with damage.  Contrary to the general consensus, tank<br/>
are not meant to deal damage.  Tanks will leave the main damage to the<br/>
casters and two-handers (though damage helps in taunting).  What is the<br/>
point in distributing the damage?  Does a cleric have to heal less if more<br/>
than one person is getting hit?  Maybe, but maybe not.  You might say it is<br/>
better for 5 people to be down 50 hit points, than for 1 person to be down<br/>
250 hps, right?  Well hang on a sec, because I maintain that if your tank is<br/>
down 250 hps, he took a lot more damage than 5 people who are down 50 hps<br/>
(unless you got a party of tanks).  As a cleric, would you rather heal 5<br/>
people or 1 person?  Well, you might say...but if a tank is down 250 hps,<br/>
he&#39;s down to 1/2 his health.  But I wouldnt be surpised to find a few high<br/>
level casters with 100 hps, which would bring them down to half their health<br/>
as well, and who would you rather invest hit points in? A tank or a caster?<br/>
1 hit point in a tank will certainly last the party longer than 1 hit point<br/>
in a caster, because it takes more rounds to get hit points out of a tank.<br/>
Tanks die a lot, and I don&#39;t think I am wrong to believe that we should<br/>
expect to die a lot.  I may have indicated in my party post that we should<br/>
go down fighting, but that&#39;s really a choice that the character has to make.<br/>
My character vowed to do everything to keep from dying from a wound to the<br/>
backside.  He also vowed to do everything he could to save his party.<br/>
Faderic was unjustified in suggesting I take a jump of a cliff.  Faderic<br/>
suggested spreading the damage, but who does he suggest the damage gets<br/>
spread to?  Casters certainly don&#39;t want the damage, they need uninterupted<br/>
combat.  I&#39;m not sure if Faderic understands the best way to use his<br/>
characters powers.  I am eager to learn more about tanking, but Faderic<br/>
didn&#39;t really educate me on anything, ask him for more details about it.<br/>
Thanks Kaane<br/>
<br/>
Another response from me ...<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  You might want to let your list know that my comments were intended<br/>
for tanks.  Whether you have one tank or two, it works the same, the tank(s)<br/>
should have EVERY mob hitting on them.  I have no idea why Faderic would<br/>
want to distribute damage to non tanks.  I can only assume he meant to<br/>
distribute the damage to non tanks, since my comments began with &#39;As a tank,<br/>
you ...&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Kaane<br/>
<br/>
Another response from me ...<br/>
<br/>
Some points:<br/>
<br/>
As far as spreading the damage:  The only time I want the damage spread is<br/>
to other tanks, not other spell casters.  If you are the only tank, I want<br/>
all the mobs on you.  If there are 3 tanks, I want the mobs spread out on<br/>
the 3 tanks.  The reason?  Assume I am already down 180 mana when the battle<br/>
ends.  Let&#39;s say it costs 60 mana to heal 100hp.  For mathematical sake,<br/>
let&#39;s say 300hp of damage has been dealt.  If 1 guy is down 300hp, then I am<br/>
going to burn 180 mana to heal him and more than likely I am out of mana<br/>
now.  Now I have to sit down and med while everyone else stands around and<br/>
waits.  If 6 people are down 50hp, while I am medding and getting my mana<br/>
back from the battle, they are healing themselves at 2hp per round.  We<br/>
should all be ready to fight at approx the same time and MUCH quicker than<br/>
in the previous instance.<br/>
<br/>

Another comment about my post from a cleric...<br/>
<br/>
As for tanks dying, I couldn&#39;t agree more.  You die, that is what you do.<br/>
BUT, you should die when it makes sense, not die just to die.  If you are at<br/>
2 bubbles and I am at full health, then it is STUPID for you to stay and<br/>
wait until I am running.  As a cleric, I can tank a little and get you away.<br/>
I use divine aura and I am right there with you alive.  Also, consider<br/>
Unrest. If you die, how long does it take you to get back, 10 min?  If I<br/>
die, it takes me 30 sec.  (You are bound to Kaldim, I am bound to cauldron)<br/>
If we have a party waiting for you for 10 min, then we are all wasting our<br/>
time.  You have to think in terms of the party, not just &quot;I am tank, I run<br/>
last!&quot;.  Where it is smart, you should be last, but keep in mind that others<br/>
do not mind dying for the party either.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts as I had this happen twice last night while playing and we<br/>
didn&#39;t fight a mob for TWENTY minutes waiting for everyone to get back!<br/>

Another comment about my post from a cleric...<br/>
<br/>
Dallben,<br/>
After your posts from your friend the other day I decided to try grouping<br/>
with a pally last night. It was my first time with one (altough I group with<br/>
SK&#39;s a lot). I must say the show went well. And that little bit of healing<br/>
and his LOH really kicked butt. Thanks for sharing your friends comments.</div>
