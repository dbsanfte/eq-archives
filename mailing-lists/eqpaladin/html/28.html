<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695997021">Hail,<br/>
<br/>
I seem to have found myself in a similar situation.  I&#39;m a fifth lvl<br/>
Paladin out of Felwithe, and for my first quest I was told to find an<br/>
Elf by the name of Tandan Nybright in Kelethin.  I have searched all<br/>
over Kelethin and talked to many Wood Elves that call it home... yet no<br/>
one seems to have heard of him.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in Advance<br/>
