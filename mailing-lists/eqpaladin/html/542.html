<div id="ygrps-yiv-220022107">I think they meant for the holy swords to be a continuous quest. For <br/>
instance, you start the soulfire quest and over the course of your life (ie. <br/>
till level 50) you find other bits and pieces until you finally are powerfull <br/>
enough to get Soulfire sword. <br/>
<br/>
I personally think that this whole Guk discussion is a mot point. He has a <br/>
really powerful sword. You don&#39;t. You want the sword? Kill him and get it. <br/>
<br/>
OR:<br/>
<br/>
You can do a huge quest (See: Soulfire) waste hours of your life learning the <br/>
Froglok tongue, hundreds of platinum on expenses, and even more time figuring <br/>
out and doing the Quest and then FINALLY getting the sword.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you RP 24/7, just kill the damn NPC and get the sword! You&#39;ll save <br/>
yourself hundreds of headaches.</div>
