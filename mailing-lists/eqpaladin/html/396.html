<div id="ygrps-yiv-701153172">I have heard that as long as you are in good standing with the Knights of<br/>
Truth, you can take the quest, or at least complete the quest if you are too<br/>
high level to start it.  The inforamtion below should help a little.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know for sure if other Paladin Guilds have similar quests, but I for<br/>
one think they should.<br/>
<br/>
For those Paladins who are above level 8 and want to start the Test of Truth<br/>
you can ask a lower level Paladin to get you the starting note, or (and I<br/>
don&#39;t really support this) I am told you can jump in on the quest by giving<br/>
Altunic Jartin a Medium Cloth Tunic.  Altunic is located in East Commonlands,<br/>
and he is the one you normally give the note to.  Doing this will skip a few<br/>
steps, and get you the first token, but I don&#39;t consider it very Honorable.<br/>
However, if this is your only option because you found out about the quest<br/>
late, and can&#39;t find a lower level Paladin in Freeport to help, than I still<br/>
believe it is every Paladin&#39;s right to TRY the Test of Truth.<br/>
<br/>
Just make sure when you give Altunic the note, or if you just give him the<br/>
Tunic that he is in his house.  It makes the quest much easier (you don&#39;t run<br/>
the risk of someone else killing the squire first).  Altunic returns to his<br/>
house near the zone to West Freeport about every 15 minutes, and stays there<br/>
for around 5 minutes.<br/>
