 </span></blockquote>Stamina&#39;s not irrelevant, but each Paladin race either<br/>
has a sufficient starting Stamina (Dwarves at 95,<br/>
Humans at 80), or has glaring weaknesses in other<br/>
attributes that are more important to be addressed<br/>
than Stamina (Erudites at 75, Half Elves at 75, High<br/>
Elves at 70).  Further, increases to Stamina show very<br/>
minor effect compared to the same increase applied to<br/>
any of the other three Physical attributes.  +10 STA<br/>
doesn&#39;t help you nearly as much as +10 STR, AGI or DEX<br/>
does.  STA should be an afterthought when considering<br/>
enhancements; and certainly don&#39;t put points into it.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; there good high level paladins out there with 75 AGI<br/>
&gt; or less?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have an 80 Agility with my Dwarven Paladin, and when<br/>
considering armor vs AGI for overall effectiveness in<br/>
protecting the character, armor is more important. <br/>
Put on full plate (bronze or steel) and you&#39;ll be much<br/>
less concerned with what your AGI score is.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I put my DEX up to ungodly levels so that I get the<br/>

&gt; also hit more often - I was getting really sick of<br/>
&gt; those &quot;but miss&quot; messages.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not a bad plan at all; I&#39;m currently seeking a pair of<br/>
Gold-Onyx rings (+5 DEX each) for this very reason. <br/>
My Current DEX is 100, and I&#39;d like to see it at<br/>
110-120 after enhancements (but before spell buffs);<br/>
so it&#39;s my secondary stat priority (STR is first).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What do people think? Having seen a difference in<br/>
&gt; combat ability below L30 and above L30, I&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; interested to hear from high level paladins about<br/>
&gt; their attributes.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Dwarven Paladin---100--95--70--90--88--62--60<br/>
&gt; Erudite Paladin----70--75--70--70--88-105--80<br/>
&gt; Half Elf Paladin---80--75--90--85--65--75--85<br/>
&gt; High Elf Paladin---65--70--85--70-100--90--90<br/>
&gt; Human Paladin------85--80--75--75--80--75--85<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Level 25 Dwarven Paladin:<br/>
Starting = 110--95--80--90--88--60--55<br/>
Current == 126--95--84-100--88--60--55<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend STR and STR enhancements as the<br/>
number one priority.  Armor is heavy, good armor is<br/>
heavier.  Even for Dwarves, who start with an<br/>
excellent STR; more is better.  STR adds to the attack<br/>
score, increases the damage bonus once you get over<br/>
20, and also enables you to loot much more.  For the<br/>
other Paladin races, who start with much lower STR<br/>
scores; STR enhancements are a vital necessity.  My<br/>
setup is +16 STR (and working on more), which would<br/>
change a STR rollup in the following Paladins like<br/>
this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Erudite Paladin---106--75--70--70--88-105--80<br/>
&gt; Half Elf Paladin--116--75--90--85--65--75--85<br/>
&gt; High Elf Paladin--101--70--85--70-100--90--90<br/>
&gt; Human Paladin-----121--80--75--75--80--75--85<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With +16 STR Enhancements, their STR scores start to<br/>
shape up very nicely.<br/>
<br/>
DEX is important for a number of reasons.  It affects<br/>
your attack connect ratio; higher equals fewer misses.<br/>
 It also affects secondary weapon effects; higher<br/>
equals it going off more often.  Finally, with a<br/>
higher DEX you see Parries and Ripostes happen more<br/>
often.<br/>
<br/>
AGI directly affects your defense, and also increases<br/>
the chance of getting a Dodge off.<br/>
