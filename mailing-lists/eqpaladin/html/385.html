<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130213975">Hail. I am stuck on the Knights of Thunder donation quest. My mission is to<br/>
find 6 citizens that will give donations to the Temple of Thunder. Then<br/>
along with my pk note, i combine and give to the person who gave me the<br/>
quest. Well, I have found 2 citizens and have a lead on a 3rd but i cannot<br/>
find anyone else to donate. If anyone has completed this quest, could you<br/>
please mail me some info. I have found 2 citizens in Qeynos and maybe a 3rd<br/>
real close to Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
