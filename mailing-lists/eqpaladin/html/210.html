<b>Subject:</b> Re: Why did you choose to play a paladin? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-120818737">I choose to play a paladin for power, plain and simple.  I thought about <br/>
playing a ranger at first, but then decided on the paladin.  Why?  Because <br/>
the paladin has better buffs, better heals, and is better at physical combat. <br/>
 As for the physical combat, the paladin has holy swords (I&#39;m gonna try and <br/>
get Ghoulbane soon, pray for me) and is able to wear plate.  Some might say <br/>
that rangers are able to dodge more and I agree with them, but if you put <br/>
more points into Agility when you make your character, you can have as much <br/>
if not more AC than a ranger.  Remember that the armor they can wear is <br/>
limited to chain (well banded too) while a paladin can wear plate.  Also at <br/>
15th we get lesser heal while they have to wait till 22nd to get it.  We are <br/>
also the only hybrids able to cast Greater Heal for 400 HP. <br/>
<br/>
What I want to know is why so many paladins are High Elves, the dwarves stats <br/>
are much better.  Just put 10 in agility and 10 in intelligence and you&#39;ll <br/>
have one great warrior. <br/>
<br/>
gotta admit that the charisma sucks though, but you can always have your <br/>
enchanter friend buy stuff for you =)<br/>
