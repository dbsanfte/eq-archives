<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762876200">I liked my combine long sword right up until lvl 20 where I got a barbed leather whip and a chitin shell shield for bashing, much higher numbers than the polished Tommy but no magical strength. In the first bubble of lvl 26 I went for the Bone bladed claymore, for 300 pp I am not sure if I paid too much or not. Not have ever used my 2h slash I ended up dumping 33 practices into it and just now as I approach the half way mark of 27 is it maxing out, (the numbers are great, double attack for 37 each J). As far as armor, the higher up in lvl I have been forsaking armor class for + agility, +strength, + dex, what I have given up in A/C is made up more than double with dodges, and parries.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Its all personal preference, I like the agility and mobility, but still keep an A/C of 532<br/>
