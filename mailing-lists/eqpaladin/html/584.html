<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Those are at nearly the top of the 1-15 level 1hS<br/>
&gt; weapon scale (very top is Dwarven 1h Axe).  The next<br/>
&gt; steps up are Barbed Leather Whip and Polished Granite<br/>
&gt; Tomahawk.  BLW goes for about 150pp, PGT about 250pp.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are also good magical 2h weapons like bone bladed claymore (17/45,<br/>
costs around 250pp, but i heard you can get it in Befallen for as low as<br/>
150pp) or blackened iron bastard sword (20/47, costs around 500pp, maybe<br/>
less in Runnyeye). But till 20 lvl your damage is limited to ~35, as<br/>
soon as you will raise to 20 you will start make 40+ damage with BBC or<br/>
even more with BIB.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; 5) What types of armor should I be looking for?<br/>
&gt; Full bronze plus magic.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is better to buy bronze armor in zones where monsters drop it. Just<br/>
make sure these monsters drop bronze of your size (for example, in<br/>
Unrest monsters drop small sized bronze). But for your level, it is<br/>
better to loot bronze, not buy it :) With good group you can easely kill<br/>
dry bones, and get bronze and exp simultaneously. You can even solo them<br/>
at ~20 level.<br/>
