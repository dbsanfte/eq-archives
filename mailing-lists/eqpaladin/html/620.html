<b>Subject:</b> Re: weapon choices at 17th level (was: taking the ghoulbane  plunge) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296844806">Okay, I shot over to everquest.gamestats.com - it tells me that the BIBS is on a<br/>
dazed goblin knight in runnyeye, near the purple crystals. Would I be able to<br/>
survive taking a team of 1-17th lvl paladin, 1-20th lvl wizard, and 1-19th lvl<br/>
cleric into runnyeye to try and find these purple crystals, then find the<br/>
knight, then kill the knight? I usually don&#39;t hang out in Runnyeye, I do run<br/>
thru there when I make a journey from Freeport to Qeynos.  Any directions from<br/>
the entryway would be MUCH appreciated :)<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks for all the feedback folks!<br/>

&gt; My BIBS has served me extremely well since 20th lvl. You might want to go to<br/>
&gt; runnyeye and get one fer yourself.<br/>

&gt; &gt; This has been an interesting and informative thread, I&#39;m glad I started<br/>
&gt; it!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Consensus seems to be that:<br/>
&gt; &gt; A) Wait until you get past level 25 before even trying to get the sword,<br/>
&gt; &gt; B) Ghoulbane is extremely hard to get even at lvl 30 and above,<br/>
&gt; &gt; C) There are more appropriate weapons that I should be using until I hit<br/>
&gt; &gt; over level 25.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Seems like for us honest 17th thru 25th level Paladins our weapon choices<br/>
&gt; &gt; are pretty clear:<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1. combine longsword or scimitar / shiny brass shield<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2. shiny brass halberd<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3. hammer of wrath / shiny brass shield<br/>
&gt; &gt; ...with the nod going to the shiny brass halberd at level 20.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I *like* the way bash interrupts spells, and would regret not being able<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; use it for 5 or more levels. If I switch to a shiny brass halberd then I<br/>
&gt; am<br/>
&gt; &gt; walking away from 1-handed slashing skill which will need to be made up<br/>
&gt; &gt; after I do get ghoulbane.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Are there any other weapon/shield combos I am overlooking that actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; worked for some of you more accomplished Paladins?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Again, thanks everybody for the input.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; True the druid can &quot;sneak&quot; the paladin down and the paladin can &quot;hide&quot;<br/>
&gt; in the &quot;safe&quot; corner while his friends do the work and then hand him a<br/>
&gt; weapon he did nothing to earn, but any paladin worth a grain of salt who<br/>
&gt; uses these techniques I don&#39;t feel they deserve one. First of all there is a<br/>
&gt; sort of honor arranging the group, leading it in, and having an active party<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; work together with you contributing. Who needs it at lvl 17 anyways? You<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t do max dmg till 20 and the effect won&#39;t work as well. There are many<br/>
&gt; other fine weapons out there till then.  Second of all in my experience<br/>
&gt; camping this thing, it can go bad very quick..people say you can stay in one<br/>
&gt; room safely and keep a couple spawns controlled, but if you really want to<br/>
&gt; live keep the whole area clean. Trust me it goes much better this way. Some<br/>
&gt; people get lucky and get the sword right away..that has never been my<br/>
&gt; experience as it is still not something I have obtained and i have tried<br/>
&gt; many times. It&#39;s a long camp but it will be well worth it if you earn it.<br/>
