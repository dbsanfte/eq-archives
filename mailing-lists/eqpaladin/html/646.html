<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984005401">Hello<br/>
I have taken a short leave of absence from my paladin to work another char<br/>
and I am ready to return to him. My question is I am currently 17th level<br/>
and have yet to start any of the quests like Test of Truth, Zimel&#39;s Blade,<br/>
or the Brilliant Sword of Faith and I was wondering if it was still possible<br/>
for me to do these quests or would I need to restart my paladin.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
