<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043479091">I am Aban, a level 17 Paladin.  Because I have traveled with companions <br/>
during my entire life, i never had much chance to quest by myself.  Now <br/>
that I have a couple of free days to explore this aspect of paladinhood, I <br/>
went to go talk to the Guild masters in the Hall of truth to do the quests <br/>
available, they say that im too experienced to do the quests.  How do  I <br/>
get other quests?  Will I ever be able to do the test of truth?<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance for your assistance,<br/>
<br/>
Aban</div>
