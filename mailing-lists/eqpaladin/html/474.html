<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064880101">High charisma comes in handy after you get to that KOS (Kill On Sight)<br/>
status with the militia.  It is a lot easier to get factions back up with a<br/>
high charisma.  My wisdom is only 65, but I have not had a hard time with<br/>
any of my spells.  My dodge skill works really well because of my base<br/>
skills that I recieved as a Half-Elf.  The important thing is just to go<br/>
out and have fun.  I just read a review in PC Accelerator magazine for<br/>
Everquest and they are so addicted that they have renamed the game in their<br/>
office to Eversmack.  I just love the response that I get when I heal<br/>
someone when they are shouting for a cleric to help.<br/>
