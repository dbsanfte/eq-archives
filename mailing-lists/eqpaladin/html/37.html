<b>Subject:</b> Possiable making of a Paladin FAQ, will need help though :) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012321652">I have an idea, we can all pool out thoughts and expierences together to form a Paladin FAQ to help the Newcomers and even the veterans of our Exhalted class. It could include Quest discriptions, weaponry reccommendations, Lvl guide to what you should be fighting, etc. This is just a thoughtfrom a late night E-mail reading session, and The #&#39;s of brothers and sisters in the list keeps rising, so feel free to ask away or just share stories, or even the occasional rant about an annoying Shadowknight or Necro :P<br/>
