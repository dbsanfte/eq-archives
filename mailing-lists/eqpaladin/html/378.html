<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180022559">Just to answer some questions I&#39;ve seen arise.<br/>
<br/>
To kill Mucktail, you need a nice party in the upper teens as a<br/>
minimum.  This is mainly because you also have to handle regen around<br/>
him, which range from plain warriors to some nasty shamans and<br/>
champions.<br/>
<br/>
1. To improve faction with the Freeport Militia, Don&#39;t kill anymore of<br/>
them ;) Turn in Orc scalps and Gnoll scalps to the respective captains<br/>
over the gates in Highhold Pass. This is challenging for anyone under a<br/>
high-teen level.  The orc scalps are turned in right near there regen<br/>
(kith side of pass, and the gnolls are turned in on the karanas side of<br/>
the pass)<br/>
<br/>
2.  The Sword of Ak&#39;allabakker (or whatever) is a myth.  Some big<br/>
players were having fun at your expense.<br/>
<br/>
3. The gypsies that sell combines (great investment) are located in the<br/>
Oasis of Marr.  You have to zone south into the Oasis from Nro, walk<br/>
along the coast til you pass a small dock and see a largish pillar just<br/>
off the coast.  When you see the pillar turn to the west and run down<br/>
the valley.  At the end of the valley there will be a large lake to your<br/>
left and the gypsy camp to your right.  The seller to the northwest has<br/>
the combines.  A few words of warning.  Sand Giants proliferate the area<br/>
so watch yer butts and take a friend with a high charisma to make the<br/>
actual purchase.  I beleive with a 95 the cost for the longsword is<br/>
53-55 plat and a 2handed (my preference) is right around 112 plat.  You<br/>
can also get them in North Karana but that&#39;s a long run from Fawdyer and<br/>
the prices are the same.  In case your wondering where anyways, just<br/>
head north from the &quot;white&quot; bridge along the road, once again beware of<br/>
Griffins and Hill Giants.  I&#39;ve since moved on and am using a Shiny<br/>
Brass halberd (can hit for a max of 74 points a round with double attack<br/>
at my current level) but the combines are great for early teens.<br/>
<br/>
4. Flash of light is very useful in conjunction with Taunt when trying<br/>
to pull mobs offa your healers and mages.  I use sense the dead to raise<br/>
my divination skill.  Unrest is the best place to work your Evocation,<br/>
Befallen is ok as well but that dungeon is a train derailment waiting to<br/>
happen and the regen on the blues and reds you need to Ward is almost<br/>
non-existent compared to Unrest.  Just a note, I feel loot is better at<br/>
Unrest as well, and you&#39;ll have the opportunity to purchase bronze armor<br/>
and fine steel weapons (or eventually kill things that carry them).<br/>
