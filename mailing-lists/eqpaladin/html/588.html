<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030755673">From what I know, once you&#39;ve gotten your confirmation as a knight, your faction plummets so far, there really is no hope of getting it back.  By getting the knighthood you&#39;ve basically said you are a member of the Knights of Truth and thus the hated enemy of Sir Lucan and the Militia.   Have you thought about Qeynos as an alternate sight?<br/>

    Ok, I have a big problem.. Around level 10-15 I did a few quests for the knights of truth in north freeport, the test of truth and some parts of the soulfire quest, this made the militia hate me, infact they scowls at me ready to attack..<br/>
    <br/>
    Now, about a month ago I god engaged with someone and we agreed to marry in freeport, and since I am KOS with militia I decided to fix this faction asap, so I went to highpass.. Now after a month in highpass/keep, turning in over 350 scalps and goblin ears, I went back to freeport.. They still scowl at me! How can this be? I even BOUGHT scalps and ears!! I bet my trousers that I could have more easily become friends with darkelves than militia.. Quite frankly this sucks alot, because now I can&#39;t get married in freeport as planned.. :(<br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone have any tips or tricks to fix freeport militia faction? Anyways, screw my reputation, tomorrow I will begin killing knights of truth to fix it because I AM getting married..<br/>
