<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188504419">When Squire Narl is around you will know it!  He shouts across the entire<br/>
zone that he is looking for Altunic.  The problem is I think that many<br/>
people in the zone will get there and kill him before you have a chance<br/>
because he is sooooo irritating.<br/>

Where is this guy?!  I know I am suppose to look around the 3rd inn while in<br/>
East Commons but I have not seen him yet and it has been a long time<br/>
searching.   Any clue as to how often he spawns?  What level is he?<br/>
