<br/>
I got the recipe for the bog juice you all are searching for :)<br/>
<br/>
- Bottle<br/>
- Water flask<br/>
- Snakeskin<br/>
<br/>
Combine all in a brew barrel and you get bog juice. I dont know what skill you need or if there is a exact position of the parts in the brew barrel ( A friend of mine who is very good in brewing made the bog juice for me =)<br/>
<br/>
Now I have another problem. I cannot get the blanket by myself because the innkeeper in seafarer roost dont sell to me ( He glowers at me doubious. I can get only one bottle a day from the woman and I dont know how to give tykar 4 Droms. Me and a friend tried to get the blanket in that way that he bought the drom, gave it to me and I gave it to tykar. But I am not able to do this 4 times ( Any suggestion how to get the blanket ?<br/>
