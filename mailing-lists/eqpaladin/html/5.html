<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054677495">from what i understand....jojunga is right near frogloks and i have seen<br/>
all kinds of people running around there.  Troll&#39;s, Ogre&#39;s, Dark Elves,<br/>
and even humans and other elves.  The guards around there seem not to care<br/>
alot.  Jojunga is from what i understand the leader of the kobolds and<br/>
very rough.  10th level trolls have problems with him, no matter what<br/>
class.</div>
