&gt;I have to ask since I am sick of fishcakes, Where do you get muffins?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I buy them from Rashinda, in the Landholder&#39;s office in Freeport. Saves me<br/>
a *lot* of money...<br/>
<br/>
BTW, is their *really* a reason to buy Rations, or especially Iron Rations?<br/>
They don&#39;t really seem to last longer than any other food item. I haven&#39;t<br/>
timed this, and I haven&#39;t bought many of these Rations, but they just don&#39;t<br/>
seem to be worth the money.<br/>
