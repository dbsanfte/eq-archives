My experiences are that a skill raises much faster if you put the initial<br/>
one practice on it once you reach the level requirements for it, some skills<br/>
doesnt seem to raise at all if you dont(dodge). Although if you see the<br/>
skill on the right side when you are practicing at your guildmaster it<br/>
should raise eventually but from 0 skill it will take quite a long time to<br/>
get the first increase in it.<br/>

&gt; One thing that I have noticed, (correct me if I am wrong), is that if I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t practiced at least one time with my Guildmaster on a type of spell<br/>
&gt; (abjuration for instance) my experience does not increase in that spell<br/>
&gt; type<br/>
&gt; until I do.  So it may seem that you can&#39;t use a spell or that it is not<br/>
&gt; working well, but you need to practice it with the Guildmaster at least<br/>
&gt; once<br/>
&gt; to kind of &quot;kick start&quot; the spell.  This is the way it has worked for me.<br/>
&gt; If anyone has any more information on practicing and spells, let me know.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; am just about to go to level 11 and will be curious as to where to utilize<br/>
&gt; my practices.<br/>

&gt; I currently have a lvl 13 human paladin with 85 wisdom and have never had<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; problem at all with casting my spells (except the ocassional fail) =).<br/>

&gt; &gt; I made a Paladin again last night, I had one that made it to level 5<br/>
&gt; then<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; deleted him because I couldn&#39;t make any exp, and I realized once I hit<br/>
&gt; level<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4 that I might not put enough points into Wisdom to be able to cast all<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; spells when I first get them.  I had this same problem with my SK where<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t able to cast 2 of my spells until level 11.  This was one of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; reasons why I quit playing him, the other because I like to explore and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; very difficult when you&#39;re a huge Troll.  So, I was wondering if 90<br/>
&gt; Wisdom<br/>
&gt; &gt; is enough to be able to cast all the spells when I get them.  I&#39;m really<br/>
&gt; &gt; afraid of playing this character up to level 50 and still not be able to<br/>
&gt; &gt; cast Revive(49) or something to that effect.  My race is a Dwarf if that<br/>
&gt; &gt; effects it. Thanks.<br/>
