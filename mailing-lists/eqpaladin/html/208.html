<div id="ygrps-yiv-560661330">Why? Why not?<br/>
<br/>
First there are the game advantages to Paladins:<br/>
Paladins are great fighters. Paladins get healing spells. Awesome special<br/>
ability (Lay Hands). Finally, Verant claims we will get the best magical<br/>
weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Now the role-playing advantages:<br/>
Paladins are trusted me more people. You get to play the hero, saving people<br/>
and dying for a good cause.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I don&#39;t like it that it takes me longer to gain a level. BUT<br/>
since people like and trust me as a paladin I find it easier to group and<br/>
thus I have actually gained levels faster.<br/>
