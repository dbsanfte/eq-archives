<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211209646">I presume that the skeleton had been buffed with a rune series of spells, giving him a magic damage shield.  Once the shield is worn down, your Hammer of Wrath will definitely hit it.  Spells pass straight through the shield, so your casters are unaffected.  Quite often I will just let my casters take down buffed enemies like this, or do it myself with expulse.<br/>

I have a question concerning the Hammer of Wrath.  I just obtained 15th level and the Hammer of Wrath spell.  Now when i summon this thing and then have it in my possesion I can right click it and it says that it is a MAGIC ITEM, but I went to Befallen last night and when I tried to hit an Ice Boned Skeleton with it, it said that the skele was invulnerable!  I thought that I would be able to hit creatures that were only susceptible to magic attack with this hammer, you know, things like Willow Wisps and the such?  Does anyone know what the deal is with this?<br/>
