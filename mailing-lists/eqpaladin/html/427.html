<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784705028">Well, <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, they didn&#39;t implement the archery skill until I was level 17.<br/>
I didn&#39;t train the archery skill until I was 19th level.  I just put 14<br/>
practices into it and have been practicing it for a couple of days.  I have<br/>
it to like 35th level....hehe.  Very slow going.  There are some good web<br/>
pages on archery that I will put at the bottom of this email.  You are<br/>
correct, at this time we cannot utilize the tiny dagger or the pine needle<br/>
to practice the skill.  However, it has been rumored we may get this ability<br/>
in a future patch, but this is only a rumor.  I am going to keep at it and<br/>
develop it along with my other skills because I find that all of them come<br/>
in handy at one time or another.  It is just going to take quite a few<br/>
arrows.  I heard that a high level magician can summon arrows as well if you<br/>
have any magician friends who will do that for you.  Best of luck training<br/>
your new skill!  Here are some web pages on the subject:<br/>

Hail fellow Paladins,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering how all of you were faring with archery skill advancement?<br/>
At<br/>
10th level, sinking 1 training point into archery, then using 20 arrows with<br/>
a<br/>
cheap hunting bow I have yet to see my skill increase.  I purchased a tiny<br/>
dagger from a friendly enchanter, but found that I can&#39;t equip it.  My next<br/>
thought is to either purchase a lot of arrows (100) and use the bow as much<br/>
as<br/>
possible or to &quot;jump start&quot; the archery skill by putting 5 more training<br/>
points<br/>
into it.  Any feedback or opinions?<br/>
<br/>
