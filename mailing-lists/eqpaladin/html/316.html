&gt; I am from the Povar shar... er... server, and the Shiny Brass Shield isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; that big a deal.  Right now the &quot;in&quot;  thing to have is the Cracked<br/>
&gt; Something<br/>
&gt; Something Shield off one of the named gnolls in High Pass Hold.  Of<br/>
&gt; course,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s where I&#39;ve been the past few days, so I can&#39;t be too sure.  It<br/>
&gt; sells<br/>
&gt; for about 150pp. The other gnoll has the Polished Granite Tommahawk, which<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; think blows chunks (I just got one), but I&#39;ve seen it go for 600pp.  The<br/>
&gt; other is the Shiny Brass Halberd, which is what I&#39;m using now until I get<br/>
&gt; the BBC.  Most people get them to sell now though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If anyone is on the Povar server, feel free to give me a tell.  I just got<br/>
&gt; level 20, so hopefully I can get my last name soon.  Right now I&#39;m in<br/>
&gt; Befallen cleaning house and taking revenge for what the place did to be in<br/>
&gt; the earlier levels.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What is the Povar server?  Never heard of it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Heh.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; To answer a few questions first:<br/>
&gt; &gt; I play on the Rathe server as a humble Dwarf Paladin named &quot;Dauldon<br/>
&gt; Blackstone&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was wondering about the list myself, glad to see it is still here.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have not seen any remnants of the Elven empire in the deserts of Ro.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A question:<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am not certain how the other servers operate, however on Rathe, it<br/>
&gt; seems<br/>
&gt; that a shiny brass shield is now one of the more rare items in the game.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; have seen one being sold for as high as 100 platinum (ouch).  The area<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; spawns the creature that occasionally has the shield, is always camped, no<br/>
&gt; matter the time of day I try.  A magic shield, as you all know, is a nice<br/>
&gt; benefit to have with the bashing ability, to be able to hit creatures that<br/>
&gt; need magic to cause damage against them.  Let me get to the question<br/>
&gt; before<br/>
&gt; I get to far off here.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Are there other magic shields that we as Paladins can use?<br/>
&gt; &gt; If so, would you mind sharing the information.  It does not have to be<br/>
&gt; very specific, just a hint or twelve &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also to comment on something else I read in one of the mails...<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would have to agree with the attitude of most people when a &quot;Holy<br/>
&gt; Knight&quot; comes to the rescue (more often to our folly as the &quot;rescuees&quot; run<br/>
&gt; and the &quot;rescuer&quot; gets stuck with the fiends) and either lays hands or<br/>
&gt; heals<br/>
&gt; to the end of mana, as being less than satisfying.  I however, feel like I<br/>
&gt; helped someone, albeit most likely someone who will watch me die in the<br/>
&gt; future and not lift a finger to help.  I think my chances are a bit better<br/>
&gt; for someone to help me if I help others and not watch another die while<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; even trying to help.  Also from a role-playing aspect, I do believe the<br/>
&gt; right thing is being done, never would a Paladin turn his head to such<br/>
&gt; persons in distress.<br/>
