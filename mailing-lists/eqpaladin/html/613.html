Sadly, I disagree.  The druid casts superior camo on the lower levels, they<br/>
get to the room, keep the under-21 crown in safe &#39;corner&#39;.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
the wizard would be very useful, but the cleric can heal.  The nukers take<br/>
care of business letting the pet tank (since it will be over 10 levels<br/>
tougher than the paladin).  The paladin can try and bash, but in reality<br/>
he&#39;ll just sit in a corner until his nuker-friends hand him his Ghoulbane.<br/>
From what I read on these lists, that&#39;s very paladin-like.  [Along with: OK,<br/>
I&#39;ll try killing off a fellow paladin to see if I can get better faction<br/>
with the corrupt militia, my paladins love me so much it should be ok].<br/>

This is kind of awkward but I think you would have problems with low level<br/>
mobs jumping you and the other people below low levels. I guess it&#39;s<br/>
possiblestill it&#39;s not very feasible and a level 17 with a Ghoulsbane is a<br/>
bit early. I&#39;d wait at least 8 more levels before you attempt this because<br/>
your current group is going to have some problems.<br/>

&gt;Here&#39;s a question for those who have retrieved the Ghoulbane holy sword:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My Paladin is 17th level, and one of the recent posts suggested that I<br/>
&gt;should be using a Shiny Brass Halberd as my primary weapon at this<br/>
&gt;point. I&#39;m thinking that Ghoulbane would make a better primary weapon,<br/>
&gt;since all that&#39;s required is to head into Froglock central and wipe out<br/>
&gt;a fellow Froggie Paladin. I have a 35th level Magician and 35th level<br/>
&gt;Druid who could help in this quest, as well as a 20th level Wizard and a<br/>
&gt;19th level Cleric. Would my party of 5 stand a chance?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
