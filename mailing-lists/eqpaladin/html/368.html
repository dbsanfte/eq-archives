<div id="ygrps-yiv-326326683">&quot;Strictly speaking, that would bring a Paladin to the same level as any<br/>
warrior. Now, if that froglock would offer a quest of sorts to obtain this<br/>
mighty weapon, that would make more sense to me. This way killing it would<br/>
not be the best option to recieve it. It really depends on whether Verant<br/>
intends to be strict on role playing or whether let the players decide,<br/>
though that can in actuality hurt the fantasy realm if people don&#39;t play<br/>
along.&quot;<br/>

&gt;Hail!! I am just looking for opinions on why you think Verant would put<br/>
&gt;Ghoulsbane on a paladin NPC. As far as I know, the Froglok King is a good<br/>
&gt;paladin and in order for us to obtain the Ghoulsbane, we have to kill him.<br/>
&gt;In a role-playing sense, that is making a RPer make a tough decision. Stay<br/>
&gt;in role and go without a powerful sword or just kill the big frog not<br/>
