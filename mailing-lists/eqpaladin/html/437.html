When in blackburrow you can clear an easy 15pp an hour killing Elite Gnoll<br/>
Guards... they drop magic collars which sell 2-3pp to other players or 1pp<br/>
in the NPC shop... Hell with level 15 you can even solo them.....<br/>

&gt; Hello All<br/>
&gt; 	I am a 15th lvl High elf Paladin on Cazic-Thule, and I am located in<br/>
&gt; the Faydwer area. My primary hunting grounds right now are the<br/>
&gt; Aqua-Goblins<br/>
&gt; (big group only) and Unrest. The problem I am facing is even though I have<br/>
&gt; all the spells for 15th lvl and I have a majority of metal armor (some is<br/>
&gt; still leather) I can&#39;t seem to make any real money. I have noticed a great<br/>
&gt; need for a combine weapon but at my present rate it will take literally<br/>
&gt; forever. I tend to hunt in groups of 3 or 4 and generally for around 5<br/>
&gt; hours<br/>
&gt; a day. I guess what I would like to know is, Am I doing something wrong?<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; is everyone broke at this lvl? Is there a better spot to hunt? Your<br/>
&gt; assistance is most appreciated.<br/>
