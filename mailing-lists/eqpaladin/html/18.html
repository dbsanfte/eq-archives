<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333098466">Greetings brothers and sisters,<br/>
<br/>
I have been assisting the Paladin&#39;s of Mithaniel Marr based in Freeport.  After <br/>
successfully delivering a message to the High Priestess of Marr I received <br/>
Marr&#39;s Essence.  This item is a silver flask which does not appear to be <br/>
magical and in fact seems to have no function that I can determine.  I got the <br/>
quest for the message so long ago that I can not remember if I am supposed to <br/>
deliver this bottle to the instructor in the Hall of Truth (paladin&#39;s guild in <br/>
Freeport) or if there is something else that is supposed to happen with it.  <br/>
Unlike most quest items it appears that this has some monetary value and could <br/>
be sold for about 4 gold.  If anyone knows what it does or what its for please <br/>
let me know.  This is one of the quests that seems to have been fixed by recent <br/>
patches.  It took me out into the west commons way before I should have been <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Second there was another messanger quest in freeport.  Upon completing the task <br/>
the instructor informed me that I should go and speak with Rashinda in the <br/>
Peoples Office of freeport to learn where Zimel&#39;s Blades is or what happened to <br/>
it.  Once I had that information I was to report back.  I can not get any kind <br/>
of response from Rashinda and I do not know whether it is because I am not <br/>
phrasing my question correctly, or if the quest is brolen.  There were rumors <br/>
that this quest leads to a holy blade.<br/>
<br/>
If any can be of assistance in these matters I look forward to your advice.  <br/>
<br/>
Humbly yours,<br/>
<br/>
Khossidar of Fenin Ro, Paladin of the Underfoot<br/>
