<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328476353">I may be wrong due to lack of patience, but it seemed to me that a person <br/>
learning a language from your spamming can only learn up to your current <br/>
skill level in that language.  I was able to learn elvish to excellent <br/>
level, from an elf, in one boat crossing from freeport to Butcherblock, but <br/>
when a friend and I tried to increase our feeble skills in gnomish and <br/>
Tier&#39;Dal, we were unable to learn beyond our respective skill levels after a <br/>
considerably longer period of time.<br/>
Somebody tell me if they&#39;ve experienced otherwise.<br/>
