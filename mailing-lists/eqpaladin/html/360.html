<div id="ygrps-yiv-117246098">All right!  This is gonna be great!  Do you realize you can knock off <br/>
about 90 HP before the monster even gets to you thanks to archery?  Well, I <br/>
talked to my ranger friend and I got a few tips for you paladins out there <br/>
(including me) who are going to start using bows for combat.<br/>
<br/>
1) Find Pine Needles or a Tiny Dagger.  Both use archery skill but they are a <br/>
melee weapon.  Hang out in a place where there are blue mobs that other <br/>
people fight, such as trainer hill or somesuch area, and (after getting their <br/>
permission) attack the monster with the pine needle/tiny dagger.  They won&#39;t <br/>
mind because you can only do one dmg with it.<br/>
<br/>
2) Spend points on fletching and try to use it as much as possible, making <br/>
regular arrows with no skill in fletching is still a 50% (?) chance of <br/>
success. Also making your own arrows costs 4 cp while buying them is ~7-10. <br/>
Oh and if you hunt in blackburrow the gnolls occasionally drop arrows and <br/>
worn hunting bows.<br/>
<br/>
3) Speaking of dropped bows, don&#39;t use them! Even the worst of the player <br/>
made bows are better than the mightiest NPC bow (except for magical, but I <br/>
mean regulars). From what he told me, most sell for 6-12 plat. I think he was <br/>
referring to the easiest ones to make.<br/>
<br/>
4) Once you get high enough (22 for us, 9 for rangers) to root your opponent, <br/>
you will know the true power of archery. You can easily bring him down to <br/>
half health with only a few arrows. This will also make up for our lack of DD <br/>
spells vs. living creatures, both as a lure and finisher and even combat <br/>
support. Though melee is our forte&#39; having some  ranged skill will be <br/>
undoubtedly helpful.<br/>
<br/>
5) When buying a playermade bow, look for the best dmg. If you have a choice <br/>
between a 9 dmg 40 delay and an 11 dmg 50 delay (theoretically speaking. I <br/>
don&#39;t know the actual stats) you should choose the higher damage one because <br/>
when you have no root spell and they jump on you, you want to hit them for as <br/>
much as possible in the time allotted.<br/>
<br/>
6) Read this guide, it is one of the best I have ever found: <br/>

	It is a shame that I can&#39;t find the URL for the Crossroads of <br/>
Norrath, they had an amazing guide about fletching.  Showed you the costs <br/>
required and compared the dmg caused by a bow to a great staff.<br/>
<br/>
	Oh, and a little trick that my friend taught me.  If you consider <br/>
this an exploit or something, tough.  It is not.  Put all of your containers <br/>
in the bank except for your fletching kit.  Take your food and put one food <br/>
in each of your slots on your main inventory, so you&#39;ll have the kit and 7 <br/>
food/water on your inventory.  Now goto the fletching guy and buy one supply <br/>
of each needed for the arrow, click combine and Vwala (or however you say it) <br/>
you have an arrow without having to click 500 times.  Put the arrow on your <br/>
ammo slot and do it again.  See?  That wasn&#39;t an exploit!<br/>
<br/>
	Goodluck everyone, I really do suggest you try archery as one of your <br/>
combat skills.  It will pay off in the end, I assure you. <br/>
