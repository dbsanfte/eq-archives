<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111433754">I would say kill orcs.....ocs and orcs and more orcs....and your factions<br/>
will go up....I have multiple characters....a human paladin and a dark elf<br/>
SK aswell as a few others....My Dark Elf can now enter the Freeport <br/>
through killing lots of Orc&#39;s.  I have seen all sorts of factions go<br/>
up...i can only assume one of them is Paladins....even though they will<br/>
never like him....i think Orc&#39;s around Freeport affect them and they<br/>
should help you get some quests.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve recently come over to Freeport from Kaladim and am interested in obtaining some quests from the local Paladin&#39;s guild. Even though I am a 10th level paladin I keep getting told that I must prove myself or somesuch. What specific enemies do I need to vanquish in order to find worth in the eyes of the Hall of Truth? Any help will be greatly appreciated.<br/>
