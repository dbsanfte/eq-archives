<div id="ygrps-yiv-412677043">She is very difficult to get talking.  I got her to respond but didn&#39;t<br/>
write down exactly what I said.  Something like &quot;can you tell me if<br/>
zimel&#39;s blades existed ?&quot;  Anyhow, the next thing you ask her about if<br/>
you can ever get her to respond is &quot;tell me about ariska zimel&quot; or<br/>
something like that.  I have made it father along the quest so it&#39;s not<br/>
broken at that point.<br/>

Greetings, I am a new Paladin located in the city of Freeport.  I ran<br/>
across<br/>
a quest where by I would deliver a message to one of our fellow brothers<br/>
hiding undercover in the Freeport Militia. Unfortunately, he was killed<br/>
but<br/>
not before giving me a note with information about Zimel&#39;s Blades, which<br/>
I<br/>
presume is a merchant shop of some type.  I returned with this info to<br/>
the<br/>
lady paladin, and she sent me to the Office of the People to speak with<br/>
Rashinda, but I seem to have hit a roadblock as I cannot get Rashinda to<br/>
reply to me.  Does anyone know is this quest is working, and if so how I<br/>
might can continue it, or is the outcome not worth the trouble?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
