 </span></blockquote>If you really meant that question, &quot;best for&quot;, you<br/>
won&#39;t like the answer.  There *is* no best race for<br/>
anything; it&#39;s always a matter of perspective and<br/>
style.  How do you view it, and how do you want to<br/>
play it?  There are only strengths and weaknesses,<br/>
from which you can select what best suits your desires<br/>
for the character.  Keeping that in mind, here are<br/>
thumbnail breakdowns of the five Paladin-eligible<br/>
races.<br/>
<br/>
Dwarves have the best starting physical stats, and<br/>
(arguably) the most balanced starting stats in terms<br/>
of Paladin attribute requirements and not having low<br/>
numbers in said requirements.  100-95-70-90-88-60-55. <br/>
As a dwarven paladin, you have no physical<br/>
deficiencies that will handicap you, and your WIS is<br/>
more than sufficient for your magical uses.  The<br/>
drawback of a dwarven paladin is the low INT and CHA. <br/>
These can be worked around.<br/>
<br/>
Erudites are tied for the best mentals; the highest<br/>
INT and the second highest WIS, and don&#39;t have<br/>
crippled physicals like High Elf paladins do. <br/>
70-75-70-70-88-107-80.  However, erudite paladins do<br/>
have the second lowest physicals, and thus can have<br/>
problems in that area.<br/>
<br/>
Half Elven paladins have the lowest starting WIS among<br/>
the paladin races, and typically are the least able<br/>
casters.  The physicals aren&#39;t bad, but focus more on<br/>
AGI and DEX than on STR or STA.  The Mentals are<br/>
strictly average, except for the low WIS. <br/>
80-75-90-85-65-75-75.<br/>
<br/>
High Elven paladins have the lowest starting<br/>
physicals, but tie for the highest mentals. <br/>
65-70-85-70-100-92-90.  High elf paladins are<br/>
enternally having encumberance problems, and will<br/>
suffer somewhat in combat until they get a high skill<br/>
level, and also collect enchantments that boost their<br/>
meager physicals.  But they have the best starting<br/>
WIS, and the second best INT; and that focuses them<br/>
more on the casting side.<br/>
<br/>
Human paladins are, as one might anticipate, the<br/>
middle of the road.  They&#39;re solid, can can be built<br/>
towards one thing or another; and aren&#39;t poor at<br/>
anything in particular, while also not being excellent<br/>
at anything either.  85-80-75-75-80-75-85.  Depending<br/>
on where the points are placed, a Human paladin can be<br/>
many things.<br/>
<br/>
Figure out what best suits your intentions for the<br/>
character, and select accordingly.  High Elves have<br/>
the most STR problems, Dwarves the most skill and<br/>
price problems, Half Elves the most magic problems. <br/>
Humans have no major problems, but no major<br/>
advantages; and Erudites pay a surprisingly low price<br/>
for their advantage of superior mentals with only<br/>
slightly below average physicals.  The humans (high<br/>
men and men) don&#39;t have Infravision, which many gamers<br/>
consider a requirement.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
