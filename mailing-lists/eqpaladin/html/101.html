 </span></blockquote>Yes, there&#39;s definitely a cheaper way.  You should always check your NPCs<br/>
to see what they sell.  Make sure you check their whole inventory as milk<br/>
often doesn&#39;t show up at the top of the list.  Muffins tend to go for 6 cp<br/>
and milk tends to go for 5/6 cp.  Your best bet is usually a baker or a<br/>
general merchant.  For example, in Freeport, I buy muffins from Rashinda in<br/>
the Land Holder&#39;s Office and milk in the Merchant&#39;s Square from the guy in<br/>
the big blue building.  My wife tells me that both of these items are also<br/>
readily available in Kelethin and Felwithe, if you happen to be on Fadwyar.<br/>
 I&#39;ve also seen several people selling muffins in High Hold, as well as<br/>
other places.  As water flasks typically sell for 1 sp, 1 cp and rations<br/>
for multiple silver, you can see how buying milk and muffins can easily<br/>
save you money in the long run.<br/>
