<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275403317">*Do you all<br/>
*just walk the land? Selling and buying from Innkeepers?  <br/>
*Anyway...  I also really hate it when I use LOH on the MOB I&#39;m <br/>
*trying to<br/>
*kill....  It never seems to appreciate it.<br/>

/smile Aye, I remember the early days of a Paladin&#39;s road. <br/>
<br/>
And yes, unless I have a high level druid or wizard friend do a group<br/>
transport, I am running the land.  But!  The peril you encounter along the<br/>
way!  The friends you make and the enemies you earn!  Much more exciting. <br/>
<br/>
And yes, after a long hiatus from my Paladin, I made the newbie (no offense)<br/>
mistake of hitting LOH when the monster was still targeted.  My solution<br/>
(works for me, at least) is that I moved the hotbutton from the first bank<br/>
of buttons with my combat buttons to the second one, so that when I think to<br/>
change button banks I also think to change targets.  <br/>
<br/>
May Tunare bless and keep you (and Erollisi Marr, although now in Final we<br/>
high elves aren&#39;t permitted to worship her as Paladins... *grumble*)</div>
