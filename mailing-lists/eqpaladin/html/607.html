<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999523068">You are on the list, however, most of the Paladin talk occurs on another<br/>
&quot;onelist&quot; at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EQ_Holyswords@onelist.com">EQ_Holyswords@onelist.com</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EQ_Holyswords@onelist.com">EQ_Holyswords@onelist.com</a>&gt; .<br/>
I would highly recommend signing up for that list in addition to this one.<br/>
<br/>
As for advice, I can only speak for myself (as a high elf Paladin of Tunare)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Weapon Progression: (rusty longsword (until 6th), minotaur axe/kite shield<br/>
(until 13th), combine longsword/shiny brass shield (until 20th, which was<br/>
foolish on my part.  I should have switched to 2H slashing long before<br/>
then), shiny brass halberd (until 25th), blackened iron bastard sword<br/>
(current)<br/>
<br/>
Armor:  All I can say is get banded as soon as you can and make due with<br/>
leather/patchwork until then.  Since you are human, bronze plate will be<br/>
relatively expensive, but the weight shouldn&#39;t be too much of a problem.<br/>
The barbed arm plates and barbed leggings found in Befallen are quite nice.<br/>
As is the thick leather apron in Unrest.<br/>
<br/>
Hunting Grounds:  Greater Faydark, near Felwithe (until 6th), Orc Camps near<br/>
Kelethin (until 10th or so), Crushbone (until 14th), Befallen and W/E<br/>
Commonlands (until 16th), Unrest (17th through 27th, with breaks to go<br/>
traveling to various places in Antonica to explore)<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps somewhat.  Peace favor you friend.<br/>
