<b>Subject:</b> The fourth holy sword... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276765990">I had witnessed on my first trip to a place of unrest, a person selling the Sword of AL A&#39;kabar (or something close to that spelling), it sold for 900 platinum (so he said).   Supposedly it was a holy sword, all of this is unconfirmed of course.  However I thought perhaps I had heard this and read the mail, I would pass it along to all of you.<br/>
