<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-183911923">Valuable info, David, thank you very much.  Your equipment timeline is right<br/>
in line with what I had planned.  At 10th level I had to decide whether to<br/>
beef up my armor to banded from patchwork & leather, or if I should save all<br/>
the loot for a level and get a combine longsword.  Our general consensus in<br/>
this mailing list seemed to indicate that, since I already have a decent<br/>
weapon _for my level_ that I should get better armor now, then upgrade my<br/>
weapon later.<br/>
<br/>
This latest thread helps me immensely in determining _how_ much later.  If I<br/>
understand correctly, I should keep adding banded at 11th and 12th level<br/>
while making do with my mino axe, then once I have a full set of banded,<br/>
anytime between 12th and 16th should be when I need to change my primary<br/>
weapon to an upgraded magical one.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I have been working at bringing up my 1h blunt - raised it from<br/>
32 to 42 last night, plan on topping it off this weekend.  My 2H blunt is<br/>
around 8 or 9, so I&#39;m just letting it sit until I get 1h blunt to my level<br/>
cap.  As for the summoned dagger/fang, it uses piercing which I have *never*<br/>
seen go up.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to other Paladin&#39;s experiences as well - the greatest<br/>
wisdom in the world comes from learning from another&#39;s experiences...<br/>

&gt; I got my shiny brass shield at 16th, and my combine<br/>
&gt; longsword at 18th (I&#39;m 19th in Unrest now); for two<br/>
&gt; main reasons.  One, I have determined the mino axe<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t really the weapon it&#39;s cracked up to be.  Two, I<br/>
&gt; was tired of having to run from ghouls that were blue<br/>
&gt; to me simply because I couldn&#39;t hurt them.<br/>
