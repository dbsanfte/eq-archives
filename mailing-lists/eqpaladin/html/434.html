<br/>
My name is Vilar, a level 8 high elf female paladin, I am new to the class<br/>
of paladin, can you tell me are there cap for the combat skills of us<br/>
paladin?  If not, than is it true that we could fight as good as those<br/>
warriors? If there are skill cap for our combat skills, well, the combat<br/>
advantage of us would be to obtain a holy sword, am I right?<br/>
<br/>
Hope my question is not stupid, I found most of us paladins are hunger for<br/>
the sword, and every paladin guide on the net said that the long turn<br/>
advantage of paladin in fight is we can get a holy sword (the most powerful<br/>
weapon in game) someday.   Well, so far as the creation of Vilar, and I<br/>
found myself doing very good in combat and also I am eager to reach level9<br/>
to cast spells. However, I just wondering, is it that important to obtain a<br/>
holy sword?  If every of us get one, well.......   I myself prefer to be a<br/>
warrior.<br/>
<br/>
I have a vision, sword is what we hold on our hand, but we are not fight<br/>
with the one we are swinging, we fight with the sword in our heart and THAT<br/>
should be our holy sword................<br/>
