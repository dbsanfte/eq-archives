<b>Subject:</b> The fourth holy sword... (some spoiler information on the first 3 , but well known) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-26551101">Well, thanks to one of our brothers, we&#39;ve found out the stats on Ghoulbane - the first item on the agenda for every young paladin.<br/>
<br/>
You should start thinking about putting a party together to retrieve Ghoulbane at about L30, or a little earlier if you have high level friends.<br/>
<br/>
The Fiery Avenger is, of course, the L50 pipe dream.  I have heard that you retrieve this off a fierce red dragon.  Presumably this dragon is located in Solusek.<br/>
<br/>
A third holy sword is Soulfire.  This requires you to defeat Pietro Zarn in Freeport, as part of the Zimel&#39;s blades quest.  Again, another L50 pipe dream.<br/>
<br/>
Now... I have heard that there is another holy sword - the fourth in the collection.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any information on this fourth sword?<br/>
<br/>
I can speculate that it&#39;s in the depths of Unrest - the underground level is fierce indeed, at least to mine eyes - or Mistmoore.  Each would surely prove worthy locations for a paladin to claim the ultimate prize.<br/>
