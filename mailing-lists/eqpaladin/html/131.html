with, which are clerics. Check out that guild too.<br/>

Myself and another paladin in Freeport were curious about our spells<br/>
that we<br/>
can cast.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that there are a number of &quot;canned&quot; spells that we can cast<br/>
that<br/>
are purchased at our guild.  I have all of these that I am able to cast<br/>
at<br/>
this time.  However, are there spells that we can pick up from other<br/>
towns/shops etc. that we can cast also?  Or are we limited to what we<br/>
can<br/>
purchase from the Guild?  I went over to the necromancer&#39;s guild and<br/>
looked<br/>
through all of the spells that they were selling and most of them said<br/>
that<br/>
I couldn&#39;t use the spell.  Just curious about this.<br/>
