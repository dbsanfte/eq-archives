 </span></blockquote>I had the same problem with fizzles when I hit 15th<br/>
and got my 2nd rank spells; Evocation was low and I<br/>
fizzled continously with Ward (record stands at 16 in<br/>
a row).<br/>
<br/>
I back burnered Ward for a few levels, then at 18th (I<br/>
was fighting Dervs in Ro at the time, so I could<br/>
afford to let it rest for awhile), devoted two hours<br/>
of practice to Ward.<br/>
<br/>
Waiting to 18th gave me more mana, and also spells<br/>
that you&#39;re higher level than seem to be somewhat<br/>
easier to cast.  That aside, I practiced it by finding<br/>
any undead I could kill (first decaying skeletons in<br/>
the newbie area, then zombies, mummies, and even a<br/>
ghoul); Warding to start the fight, then killing it. <br/>
Then I targeted the corpse and sat next to it Warding<br/>
and meditating as needed, until the corpse would<br/>
finally go away.<br/>
<br/>
I brought Ward up to 52 in two hours of this, and<br/>
reduced the fizzles considerably.  I went to Unrest<br/>
shortly after and now often use Ward to finish fights<br/>
when the mob starts running.  My skill&#39;s currently at<br/>
69 (dude!), and should continue to increase.  I<br/>
suppose I could level cap it to 95 in less than an<br/>
hour if I repeated the same procedure, but I haven&#39;t<br/>
bothered yet; it&#39;s moving up faster than I&#39;m leveling.<br/>
 Fizzle rate is less than 3 in 10 (most I&#39;ve ever had<br/>
is 2 fizzles before getting it off).<br/>
