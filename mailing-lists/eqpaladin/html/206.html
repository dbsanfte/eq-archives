<b>Subject:</b> Holy swords <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-4749649">This is in responce to a statment that was made here. That is, that Holy Swords are 1 handed. I petitions a Guide, (or a Gm not sure who I talked to) and he said that Holy swords come in 1h and 2h flaovers (I am not kiding he said flavors) any way. I jest wanted to tell you all that you could use 1hs or 2h slashind and still get a holy sword. I use 2h slashing but that is jest preferance. by the way I am a level 2 dwarf on Bristlebain (Hey I am no newbee this is my 6th char.) my name is purge<br/>
good day all, hunt safe, and may your weapon be strait and true. (unless you have a scimitar or something then curved and true &lt;g&gt;)</div>
