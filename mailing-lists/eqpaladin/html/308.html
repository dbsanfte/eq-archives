<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430375080">on the Xegony server, it seems Greater Faydark is the only place where<br/>
people auction shiny brass shields. a friend of mine came all the way from<br/>
Qeynos when he heard they had them there. he paid 25 pp for his, but I<br/>
believe 20 is more common. that is third on my list of things to buy, a<br/>
combine sword being first. 50 pp takes awhile to save though.<br/>

moral ambiguity. No ancient and overpowering Enemy. They were, as you say,<br/>
the Bad Guys, and we were the Good Guys....and they made a very satisfying<br/>
*thump* when they hit the ground!&quot;<br/>

&gt; As far as the Shiny Brass Shield being rare...you are correct.  I have one<br/>
&gt; now after watching the message rooms closely and continuosly watching<br/>
&gt; auctions in the game.  I happened on someone who sold it to me for 20 plat,<br/>
&gt; good deal.  I have seen people asking as much 30-40 plat.  It is nice having<br/>
&gt; this shield.  It puts off light like a lightstone and adds to magic<br/>
&gt; resistance as well as having 10 ac and being a magic item you can bash magic<br/>
&gt; creatures with.  They are pretty rare from what I can find out.  Right now I<br/>
&gt; am trying to obtain a 2h shiny brass halberd.  I have seen people selling<br/>
&gt; them but haven&#39;t been able to hook up with anyone and purchase one.<br/>

&gt; To answer a few questions first:<br/>
&gt; I play on the Rathe server as a humble Dwarf Paladin named &quot;Dauldon<br/>
&gt; Blackstone&quot;<br/>
&gt; I was wondering about the list myself, glad to see it is still here.<br/>
&gt; I have not seen any remnants of the Elven empire in the deserts of Ro.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A question:<br/>
&gt; I am not certain how the other servers operate, however on Rathe, it seems<br/>
&gt; that a shiny brass shield is now one of the more rare items in the game.  I<br/>
&gt; have seen one being sold for as high as 100 platinum (ouch).  The area that<br/>
&gt; spawns the creature that occasionally has the shield, is always camped, no<br/>
&gt; matter the time of day I try.  A magic shield, as you all know, is a nice<br/>
&gt; benefit to have with the bashing ability, to be able to hit creatures that<br/>
&gt; need magic to cause damage against them.  Let me get to the question before<br/>
&gt; I get to far off here.<br/>
&gt; Are there other magic shields that we as Paladins can use?<br/>
&gt; If so, would you mind sharing the information.  It does not have to be very<br/>
&gt; specific, just a hint or twelve &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also to comment on something else I read in one of the mails... <br/>
&gt; I would have to agree with the attitude of most people when a &quot;Holy Knight&quot;<br/>
&gt; comes to the rescue (more often to our folly as the &quot;rescuees&quot; run and the<br/>
&gt; &quot;rescuer&quot; gets stuck with the fiends) and either lays hands or heals to the<br/>
&gt; end of mana, as being less than satisfying.  I however, feel like I helped<br/>
&gt; someone, albeit most likely someone who will watch me die in the future and<br/>
&gt; not lift a finger to help.  I think my chances are a bit better for someone<br/>
&gt; to help me if I help others and not watch another die while not even trying<br/>
&gt; to help.  Also from a role-playing aspect, I do believe the right thing is<br/>
&gt; being done, never would a Paladin turn his head to such persons in distress.<br/>
