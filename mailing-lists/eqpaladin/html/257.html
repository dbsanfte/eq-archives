<div id="ygrps-yiv-796558344">A post I saw: <br/>
<br/>
I have the honor of personally knowing most of the group that retrieved the<br/>
first Ghoulsbane. <br/>
From rumors, you know that it is in Upper Guk, but now it is confirmed.<br/>
Don&#39;t know the MOB that has it, but I do know from the size and level of the<br/>
group that it is powerful. <br/>
The group that attained it ranged from Levels 35 to 27. They may have had<br/>
more than 1 group as well. <br/>
Stats on the awesome Paladin only sword:<br/>
1H Slash 15DMG 34SPD, and casts Dismiss Undead. <br/>
Imagine being able to double attack for a potential full 30DMG (about 70 to<br/>
80HP with the level bonuses), and at a speed that is at least 10 to 13<br/>
points faster than the Shiny Halberd, and Black Iron Sword. <br/>
Also, they can now use a magic shield. The black shield that gives +9 STR<br/>
comes to mind. <br/>
Anyways, a final congrats, and no names are mentioned because of the flood<br/>
and onslaught of tells and questions. <br/>
