<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031717043">Yeah.  I agree with your conclusions of Strength.  So far I get one <br/>
ATK for every STR I have (once in a while it is 2 ATK per).  It really all <br/>
depends on the weapon skill, strength giving it a magnifying effect.  I, as a <br/>
dwarf, poured my points into my starting agility of 70 and now have 90 of it, <br/>
same as my dex.  The only downside of a dwarf is the horrible int of 60 and <br/>
the even worse charisma of 55!  I once got stunk by a skunk and had it down <br/>
to 15! Heheh<br/>
<br/>
	But the skill-maxing is really not a problem for me.  I heard that <br/>
dwarves get a higher XP penalty than high elves but I&#39;m not sure. If true, <br/>
that gives you plenty of time to max everything =)<br/>
<br/>
	As for weapons, I use one handed slashing.  I know that a two hander <br/>
is better for dmg but I figure the lower delay time (26 thanks to the dwarven <br/>
axe) and bash dmg gets me almost equal to a 2H.  Only reason I don&#39;t like 2H <br/>
is because you are trying to do a lot of dmg at once, and if you miss once <br/>
you miss for it all.  With a bunch of small attacks you may miss half the <br/>
time but you&#39;ll still hit your opponent.  Again the higher dmg for the 2H <br/>
solves this.  The only time I would use a 2H is against a monster with a fire <br/>
shield of some sort.<br/>
<br/>
	I have also started to train up my 1H blunt so that I&#39;ll be able to <br/>
use the rank 2 summoned weapon.  Anyone have any tips for raising this stupid <br/>
skill?  I&#39;m too low to actually fight anything blue+.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
	Well, I love playing a dwarf because if I am grumpy in real life I <br/>
can be grumpy in the game under the pretense of role-playing! And it sure is <br/>
fun to group with those high elf women and tell them they would be very <br/>
pretty if they had beards =)</div>
