<b>Subject:</b> Re: Entrance to the sewers and other things <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-972294578">On my server (Povar) I heard rumors that a group, low 30s in level, recently <br/>
went after Ghoulsbane.  According to what I heard they barely made it out <br/>
alive, they had to escape via group teleport.  Let us know how your attempt <br/>
goes, I&#39;m very curious.<br/>
<br/>
As far as secret entrances in Freeport goes, I do know they exist, they lead <br/>
to a sewer system.  I would just hug the outside wall until you stumble into <br/>
it.  A lot of evil players use these to reach the docks, and I do know part <br/>
of them go by the Cleric&#39;s and Paladin&#39;s guild.  BTW there is also a secret <br/>
entrance to the city in Qeynos too.  The one I found was to the left of the <br/>
gates, before you enter the city.  Be carefull though, lower levels may be <br/>
attacked by creatures fairly often.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;On a note about<br/>
&gt;Ghoulsbane, the crew I&#39;m with will be attempting to get a few of those<br/>
&gt;this weekend.  One thing I know for sure, don&#39;t try it if your under<br/>
&gt;20th level.  The rumor is the FroggerKing is close to level 30.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4. I remember seeing a message regarding a back entrance to North<br/>
&gt;Freeport.   I am curious if anyone has better details of this.  I plan<br/>
&gt;on rampaging those evil guards this weekend (very holy-type evil grin).<br/>
