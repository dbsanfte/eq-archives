<div id="ygrps-yiv-393961330">Nice list I post and two seconds later I get a response, very nice. I ran <br/>
into a lvl 28 paladin the other day he was using a bone bladed claymore, <br/>
which wasn&#39;t a holy sword, but he mentioned Ghoulsbane as being the first <br/>
holy sword he thought paladins got. I do remember hearing that in beta, <br/>
anyone have any info on this?<br/>
