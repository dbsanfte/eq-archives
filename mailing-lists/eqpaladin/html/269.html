    I know that this does not really relate to &quot;paladin stuff&quot; but through<br/>
the emails we have <br/>
built a small community here and I have had many game questions answered<br/>
here so this <br/>
seemed like the best place to ask for help. I am currently a lvl 12 (1<br/>
bubble to 13th) High <br/>
Elf Paladin currently operating on the Cazic Thule server on the continent<br/>
of Faydwer and <br/>
I made a horrible mistake. I rushed into joining a guild not knowing what<br/>
type of people <br/>
the guild was and more wanting brotherhood then anything else. To my horror<br/>
I realized I <br/>
had joined a gang of petty kill stealing, cheat exploiting, bug exploiting<br/>
thugs. My problem <br/>
is that the guild officers refuse to allow me to leave the guild and was<br/>
hoping someone <br/>
could tell me a way that I can quit the guild without being removed. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you all and may Tunare bless you all and may your blades find there<br/>
mark <br/>
