<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526763833">One of the best investments I could suggest would be the purchase of some<br/>
new rings.  Around 20th level I purchased a pair of gold carnelian rings (+5<br/>
agility) for 65pp and firmly believe that they have saved my life on many<br/>
occasions.  This is especially true when being run over by a train in Unrest<br/>
where that one extra miss/dodge/parry can mean the difference between life<br/>
and a gruesome death.<br/>
<br/>
I would also look into the possibility of upgrading your two-handed weapon.<br/>
Although the 1H vs. 2H debate rages to this very day, I personally believe<br/>
that 2H is the way to go after 20th until/if you get Ghoulbane.  A shiny<br/>
brass halberd and bone bladed claymore are both well within your price range<br/>
(~100pp on Povar).  I personally preferred the halberd because that -8<br/>
agility hit with the claymore is brutal, but I know many of our brethren<br/>
that have been happy with both.  In the mid-20&#39;s it&#39;s then time to start<br/>
looking for a blackened iron bastard sword.  I have one and it&#39;s my pride<br/>
and joy...<br/>
<br/>
Peace favor your sword,<br/>
