<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352596783">We as Paladins should be thankful we are not nearly as messed up as other<br/>
classes are. Warriors max out at an attack level that is the same as our<br/>
own, and have a weapon that is supposadly the best that has no damage<br/>
improvemt over a weapon taken from a lvl 25ish mob. We know at least with<br/>
Fiery Avenger, we can do well over 200 hp of damage per hit not including<br/>
the spell, inferno shock which hits for another 150. The Ghoulsbane still<br/>
has a better ratio than the Short Sword of the Yklesh. ANd Ghoulsbane is<br/>
somewhat easy to get. The Brilliant Sword of Faith is a reward you get for<br/>
killing Sir Lucan, the fallen Paladin of the Militia fame. I is not the<br/>
greates of weapons, but it has as good of a ratio as a Giant Zweihander and<br/>
50 extra mana, and you dont have to kill an Innocent (Karg) for it. The only<br/>
Tweaks I think A paladin should get is the ability to do a Full ressurect,<br/>
not just a revive, and Healing at 22 instead of 30, because by the time we<br/>
hit 22, minor healing dosnt cut it anylonger. We are the the most powerful<br/>
Melee Class in the game due to the fact of LOH and Our healing spells, which<br/>
gives us more hp than a Monk and lets us tank for much longer than a<br/>
Warrior, we can also at later levels us the best weapons and armor. Brad<br/>
does need to make the quests eaiser, and needs to fix them immediatly, or at<br/>
least give better clues, I mean I have camped for Jojounga for the High Elf<br/>
Paladin quest now for 2 nights, And he has not spawned, which is Quite<br/>
annoying because during that time 2 bashers have found me and caused me to<br/>
lose a level. I do not agree with the Paladin exp penalty, but I believe<br/>
shadowknights should get a larger penalty because they can summon a pet and<br/>
their dd spells cannot be resisted. Just my own personal feelings on this<br/>
issue.<br/>
