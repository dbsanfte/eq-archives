<div id="ygrps-yiv-513568389">I didn&#39;t know know about Jojunga my last time in Innouthule, but being on<br/>
the continent i might head down there. My last expierence in Innouthule was<br/>
interesting, I took to arms with a lvl 14  Dark Elf Shadow Knight ( I was 14<br/>
at the time) and was in a duel to the death with her, I almost died, but I<br/>
succeeded and won the match. That is a hard area with all the troll bashers<br/>
around, so I would reccommend having a large group to kill the occasionial<br/>
troll that come about if you are 15+, Other than that, i dont know much<br/>
about the area, I tried to go get Ghoulsbane (Holy Sword) while there, got<br/>
lost in guk and then made my way out, all i know about Ghoulsbane is that it<br/>
is in lower guk on a high lvl Undead frogglok. May Tunare be with you<br/>
