<b>Subject:</b> magic only creatures - my solution and question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-457997846">I use a minotaur axe/targ shield combo 99% of the time, but should I need to<br/>
attack or defend against a creature only hit by magic weapons then I haul out<br/>
my trusty staff or dagger (fang?) summoned by a friendly magician and commence<br/>
wacking the baddie.  It would be nice to have the combine longsword or some<br/>
other decent magical weapon, but I&#39;m still about 50 platinum short, what with<br/>
having to buy armor, arrows, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The staff is nice - dmg 8, delay 40? - and my skill is going steadily up in 2H<br/>
blunt.  The summoned dagger is decent as well (dmg 4, delay 21?) but doesn&#39;t do<br/>
nearly enough damage when hunting wisps or scarecrows. I&#39;m also working on<br/>
pushing 1H blunt up for when I can summon the mace in four levels.  If I<br/>
*really* want to, I could go punish bandits with a wizard friend in the karanas<br/>
and have that combine longsword in a week.  The thing is, I don&#39;t usually hunt<br/>
for creatures hit by magic only because there&#39;s so many critters running round<br/>
that don&#39;t have that limitation!<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s a question for you higher-level paladins (16th and over) - at what<br/>
level does it become necessary to have a magic weapon, and can the situations<br/>
that require a magic weapon be handled by our summoned mace?<br/>
<br/>
Kaladin, the curious 11th level Paladin<br/>
