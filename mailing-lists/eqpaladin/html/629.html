<div id="ygrps-yiv-370679809">Congratualations on getting yours, I too have been seeking the weapon since lvl 30 and was sucessfull after all day camping into the late hours..I was a great honor<br/>
My original party was lvl 32 mage, lvl 33 ranger, myself, lvl 32 cleric, lvl 32 shaman due to how long it took several members left and were replaced by others..it was fortunate i got it when I did, for no sooner had I gotten it, several lvl 50s decided to help their friend get the sword and they wanted it now. In any case I went to unrest afterward to try it, the effect went off most times for 162 dmg, quite nice I must say. I considered using a MM sheild for more dex, but I needed str more so used cracked darkwood, it&#39;s a dream weapon well worth the wait and the effort.<br/>
