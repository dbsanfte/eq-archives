<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781969501">I am in the part of the quest where I am supposed to meet Tykar Renlin<br/>
in the Seafarers Roost inn, but I have searched it thouroughly and he<br/>
was not there, does he only come at a certain time or do I need to do<br/>
something to make him come?<br/>
Also my faction with the innkeepers is so that I cannot trade with them,<br/>
I am KOS by freeport militia aswell, and this has REALLY made the quest<br/>
hard to do, I don&#39;t even want to think about how I am supposed to get<br/>
into the dungeon and meet Zimel hehe. But I guess this is all easy<br/>
compared to the other two pieces of the quest heh..<br/>
