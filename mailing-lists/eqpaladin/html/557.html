<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-910491551">If you missed it, you should check out EQLizer to see the Man-O-War - a paladin only 2 handed blunt weapon (19 dmg, 41 delay with Chaotic Feedback effect).  It will make the dwarven hearts beat quickly, although carrying the effect Chaotic Feedback appears a bit odd.  A hoax?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know where this weapon can be found?<br/>
