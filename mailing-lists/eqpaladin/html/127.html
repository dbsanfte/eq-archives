<br/>
Just some comments to the list.  I read the list in digest version so I<br/>
can&#39;t respond to specific emails.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Do not overly worry about having enough mana to cast spells.  I have<br/>
reached the 19th Order in the Service of Brell and have yet to find a<br/>
spell I cannot cast due to lack of total mana.<br/>
<br/>
2.  It is best to always seed any new skills.  Check your spell book to<br/>
see what skill the new spells you gain are and drop a point accordingly<br/>
into each one.  Just as a tip, buy the lowest mana spell in each class,<br/>
just for the purpose of skilling.  I used sense undead to raise my<br/>
Divination skill, once I started it maxxed in about 3 days of casting.<br/>
I cast while hanging out just about anywhere.  The hardest for us I<br/>
think will be conjuration, to the extent I haven&#39;t even bought the<br/>
Hammer spell because I don&#39;t see a use.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Magic weapons are important.  I am using a Combine 2-Handed at the<br/>
moment.  The cost was very high at 112 plat, but quite worth it in the<br/>
long run.  I am fortunate to have several friends with whom I pool coin<br/>
to purchase items.  But ye need to try and save at least 60 plat and buy<br/>
a Combine Longsword to use for coining.  The reasoning behind this is<br/>
the combines are faster and hit harder, thereby allowing you to slay<br/>
those evil bastages in a more timely fashion.  Willows are great coin,<br/>
the lightstones sell for 8 gold (i&#39;m a dwarf, charisma ain&#39;t me strong<br/>
point) and the greaters sell for almost 4 plat.  That is to merchants.<br/>
There are always players out there in need and you can make roughly<br/>
fifty percent profit over merchant costs sometimes.  On a note about<br/>
Ghoulsbane, the crew I&#39;m with will be attempting to get a few of those<br/>
this weekend.  One thing I know for sure, don&#39;t try it if your under<br/>
20th level.  The rumor is the FroggerKing is close to level 30.<br/>
<br/>
4. I remember seeing a message regarding a back entrance to North<br/>
Freeport.   I am curious if anyone has better details of this.  I plan<br/>
on rampaging those evil guards this weekend (very holy-type evil grin).<br/>
