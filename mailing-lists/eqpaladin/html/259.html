<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436431856">I wish there were lower level magical swords that were a little easier to<br/>
obtain. Like in Dungeons and Dragons. The +1 Longsword was pretty common,<br/>
but it could hit for magical damage. The closest thing to that is a Combine<br/>
Sword, which is still more expesive than most of us can afford. (armor,  and<br/>
spells, they aren&#39;t free). Ok, so maybe a magicla Item isn&#39;t actually<br/>
needed, but how do I beat Ghoul? Im a paladin, its one of my most hated<br/>
enemies, yet I can&#39;t touch it. Fun. There needs to be balance, it is<br/>
something definatly lacking in the Everquest Universe.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; A post I saw: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have the honor of personally knowing most of the group that retrieved<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; first Ghoulsbane. <br/>
&gt; From rumors, you know that it is in Upper Guk, but now it is confirmed.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t know the MOB that has it, but I do know from the size and level of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; group that it is powerful. <br/>
&gt; The group that attained it ranged from Levels 35 to 27. They may have had<br/>
&gt; more than 1 group as well. <br/>
&gt; Stats on the awesome Paladin only sword:<br/>
&gt; 1H Slash 15DMG 34SPD, and casts Dismiss Undead. <br/>
&gt; Imagine being able to double attack for a potential full 30DMG (about 70<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; 80HP with the level bonuses), and at a speed that is at least 10 to 13<br/>
&gt; points faster than the Shiny Halberd, and Black Iron Sword. <br/>
&gt; Also, they can now use a magic shield. The black shield that gives +9 STR<br/>
&gt; comes to mind. <br/>
&gt; Anyways, a final congrats, and no names are mentioned because of the flood<br/>
&gt; and onslaught of tells and questions. <br/>
