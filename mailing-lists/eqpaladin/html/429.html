<br/>
(at time) 16th Dwarven Paladin on Tarew Marr<br/>
<br/>
Thursday I heard one of the undocumented features in<br/>
the patch was the addition of archery to Paladins. <br/>
When I got home Thursday, I confirmed I could buy bows<br/>
and equip them.  I then discovered the only places to<br/>
get fletching supplies/arrows were at the two ranger<br/>
guilds (Surefall Glade and Kelethin - any other arrow<br/>
and/or fletching sources exist, speak up please!).  So<br/>
I travelled back to my homeland (Feydwer) after<br/>
stopping at my guild and putting 1 point each into<br/>
Archery and Fletching before logging off Thursday.<br/>
<br/>
Friday evening, I went to Kelethin and bought a quiver<br/>
(mistake, don&#39;t bother; backpack has twice the slots,<br/>
didn&#39;t notice any difference between the two; if there<br/>
is one, someone fill me in), a fletching kit and<br/>
components for class 1 arrows, and started fletching. <br/>
I worked up through the components until, 3 hours<br/>
later, I had taken Fletching to 56.  I was then able<br/>
to make, on my first try, a Hickory/Hemp bow.<br/>
<br/>
I used that bow for the next hour or two, then bought<br/>
an Elm/Hemp from someone auctioning bows (paid 5pp, a<br/>
fair price considering what I know about the materials<br/>
costs) and kept using it.  I didn&#39;t bother making<br/>
arrows after that; saving 4cp per arrow is *not* worth<br/>
the 6-9 minutes it takes to do 20 arrow attempts, IMO.<br/>
 I just bought the 1sp each arrows for sale at the<br/>
fletchers&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I spent the time in Crushbone&#39;s Throneroom, firing<br/>
arrows at everyone else&#39;s blue+ (to me) mobs; no one<br/>
minded because A) I&#39;m helping them kill their target<br/>
B) There&#39;s *no* way an archer will killsteal from a<br/>
warrior or wizard fully engaged and C) I also<br/>
healed/buffed them while I was hanging around.  I had<br/>
to run from Dvinn on occasion, but Friday night and<br/>
Saturday I took Archery to 65.<br/>
<br/>
I then proceeded to fill up 80% of my bank slots, and<br/>
3 backpacks on myself, with 1sp arrows and returned to<br/>
the Ro Desert.  Since then, working archery as a pull<br/>
and chase killer, I&#39;ve brought it to 73.<br/>
<br/>
The Tiny Daggers people talk about won&#39;t equip for<br/>
Paladins right now; dunno if it&#39;s supposed to be that<br/>
way or not.<br/>
<br/>
Fletching is a *cheap* skill to bring up; I spent<br/>
about 1 1/2 pp on the kit and then another 3-4pp to go<br/>
from 1 to 56, so it&#39;s very cheap.  The Hickory/Hemp<br/>
bow I made only cost about 4gp to try (first try<br/>
succeeded).  The Elm bows cost 2-4pp per try, but the<br/>
next level up (Ash) cost 20-30pp per try (all<br/>
depending on string type and tools used; cams are<br/>
*expensive*, 45pp each to my low CHA dwarven paladin).<br/>
<br/>
This info comes from experience and some fletching<br/>
sites on the web.<br/>
<br/>
Bows determine the base damage/delay/range (where<br/>
xx/yy for weapons is damage/delay, xx/yy/zz for bows<br/>
is damage/delay/range).  Range is more relevant than<br/>
it might first appear because 100 range is shorter<br/>
than it sounds; you have to be closer than you think<br/>
to be in range.<br/>
<br/>
Arrows modify the base damage and range of the bow,<br/>
adding damage and adding or subtracting range.  There<br/>
are arrow and/or bow combinations that result in 0 or<br/>
25 ranges, and are presumably very limited in their<br/>
use (perhaps in a dungeon fight, or for a dedicated<br/>
close range archer who won&#39;t be using melee in his<br/>
group).<br/>
<br/>
Arrow components:<br/>
---Shafts modify damage.  Wood = +1, Bone = +2,<br/>
Ceramic = +3, Steel = +4(or +5?).<br/>
---Points modify damage.  Field = 0, Hooked = +1,<br/>
Bladed = +2.<br/>
---Fletches vary in their mods.  Round = no change,<br/>
Parabolic = +50 range, Shield = +1 damage, -50 range.<br/>
---Nocks modify range.  Large = +0, Medium = +25,<br/>
Small = +50.<br/>
<br/>
Strings affect the damage/delay of the bow.  Hemp is<br/>
the base (bow stock plus hemp = base bow stats for<br/>
that bow stock).  Linen modifies base -1/-4/-.  Silk<br/>
modifies base -2/-8/-.  Whittling knife modifies base<br/>
-1/-4/-, planing tool -2/-8/-.  Cams add +2(?) damage.<br/>
<br/>
Always consider the efficiency rating of the weapon<br/>
(damage divided by delay) and consider the range you<br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
The cheapest, longest range arrow is<br/>
Field/Wooden/Small/Parabolic 1.7sp component cost,<br/>
1/150 (dmg/rng).<br/>
<br/>
The cheapest arrow possible is<br/>
Field/Wooden/Large/Round 0.4sp cost, 1/50.  Changing<br/>
to a Medium nock makes it 0.5sp cost, 1/75.  Changing<br/>
to a Parabolic fletch makes it 0.9sp cost, 1/100.<br/>
<br/>
The highest damage arrow possible is<br/>
Bladed/Steel/Small/Shield at 1.556pp cost, 7/50.  If<br/>
you want some range, make it<br/>
Bladed/Steel/Small/Parabolic for 1.527pp cost, 6/150.<br/>
<br/>
Do some research; but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be using<br/>
arrows that cost much more than 3-4sp each until I get<br/>
into areas of the game that pay 15-20pp per hour of<br/>
hunting.  I am considering starting to use the 1.7sp<br/>
1/150 arrows though (I&#39;d have to hand fletch them, or<br/>
pay someone to do it though; which is the drawback,<br/>
but would give a 50% increase over the 1/100s I&#39;m<br/>
buying premade from Kelethin for 1sp each).<br/>
<br/>
Also note, be sure to check component prices in game<br/>
before making massive purchases; I don&#39;t have them<br/>
memorized and the site I pulled the data from could<br/>
have things outdated/wrong.<br/>
<br/>
And BTW, I *love* my bow now.<br/>
<br/>
