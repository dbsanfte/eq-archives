<b>Subject:</b> Re: group strategies - initial strike <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-419450043">Grouping:<br/>
One of the best resources on grouping in EverQuest I have found:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.stratics.com/group.shtml">http://eq.stratics.com/group.shtml</a><br/>
<br/>
I do not &#39;hail&#39; my opponents in order to have the group directed at a specific<br/>
targed, instead I use /g to communicate with my group on my intended target.<br/>
Some of my group members are higher level than I am, so it makes sense to use<br/>
the more powerful characters to triangulate towards the most powerful opponent.<br/>
If there is more than one target, and since my group tends to cluster up, it&#39;s<br/>
usually as simple as saying &#39;target the (orc/goblin/bandit/etc) on the left.&#39;<br/>
Once the group knows definitevely which opponent to target (this usually only<br/>
takes a minute) and us tank-types are focused on the same target, we charge in<br/>
and begin smacking the beastie about.  My order of preferred targets is:<br/>
1. whichever opponent does the most damage<br/>
2. any spell-casting opponents<br/>
3. any poisonous or diseased opponents<br/>
4. anything else<br/>
<br/>
This method has worked pretty good overall so far.  My next refinement is to<br/>
work on who gets targetted after the initial assault.  I understand there is a<br/>
command to assist a party member, so I imagine using assist to have all<br/>
tank-types flogging the appropriate beastie.<br/>
