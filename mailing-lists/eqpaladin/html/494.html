<b>Subject:</b> Re: ice bone skeletons resist spook spell <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306622474">I just hit 12th level yesterday, so I won&#39;t be going to Befallen or Unrest<br/>
anytime soon!  However, I have been spending a lot of time at levels 10 and 11<br/>
in the Everfrost Peaks, soloing the snow leopards, orc troopers, and giant wooly<br/>
spiders, and grouping for orc mountaineers and mammoth calves.  Ice bone<br/>
skeletons do wander the area, sometimes in groups of 2 or 3, and it can be<br/>
frustrating to know that I am dead meat unless somebody saves you by casting<br/>
spirit of the Wolf, or by taking on the ice bone (which cons white to me).  The<br/>
last time this happened, i tried casting Spook the Dead at it, but it just<br/>
resisted the spell and kept on beating me to death, 14hp at a time. That was a<br/>
long, painful, ugly death. Needless to say, this was before I started carrying<br/>
the magician-summoned staff.  I have gone up a level as well since then, so<br/>
hopefully my spooky spell will work at least once, and until it does I can at<br/>
least be beating it back a little.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, 2Hblunt is 26, 1Hblunt is 44, 1Hslash is 64, bash is 64.  I can<br/>
solo blue-con giant spiders with the 2H staff and have 2 bubbles of health left,<br/>
so I really hope that, should I absolutely need it, I can use LoH combined with<br/>
2H staff and the occasional heal spell to survive a single ice bone skeleton<br/>
onslaught.  I don&#39;t want to test this theory, but it does give me some hope!<br/>
<br/>
Drive back the legions of undead for me until I am strong enough to join you!<br/>

&gt; A lot of the higher level undead can only be hit by magic weapons.  Don&#39;t go<br/>
&gt; to Befallen or Unrest without one.  The ice boned and dry boned skeletons<br/>
&gt; can only be hit by magic and are nasty enough to be a tough fight even with<br/>
&gt; a magic weapon.  I wouldn&#39;t want to go against one of those guys without<br/>
&gt; anything but my hardest hitting weapon.  I think I started seeing a lot of<br/>
&gt; them around level 16 or so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By the way, I never even bought the weapon summoning spells because I had my<br/>
&gt; combine by then, could never keep my 1-H blunt trained up, and would do more<br/>
&gt; damage with my magic sword anyway.  I have not missed those spells.  I<br/>
&gt; always have backup weapons in the bank for when I die and lately (level 20)<br/>
&gt; often have a magic backup weapon tucked away.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I use a minotaur axe/targ shield combo 99% of the time, but should I need<br/>
&gt; &gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;attack or defend against a creature only hit by magic weapons then I haul<br/>
&gt; &gt;out<br/>
&gt; &gt;my trusty staff or dagger (fang?) summoned by a friendly magician and<br/>
&gt; &gt;commence<br/>
&gt; &gt;wacking the baddie.  It would be nice to have the combine longsword or some<br/>
&gt; &gt;other decent magical weapon, but I&#39;m still about 50 platinum short, what<br/>
&gt; &gt;with<br/>
&gt; &gt;having to buy armor, arrows, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The staff is nice - dmg 8, delay 40? - and my skill is going steadily up in<br/>
&gt; &gt;2H<br/>
&gt; &gt;blunt.  The summoned dagger is decent as well (dmg 4, delay 21?) but<br/>
&gt; &gt;doesn&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; &gt;nearly enough damage when hunting wisps or scarecrows. I&#39;m also working on<br/>
&gt; &gt;pushing 1H blunt up for when I can summon the mace in four levels.  If I<br/>
&gt; &gt;*really* want to, I could go punish bandits with a wizard friend in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;karanas<br/>
&gt; &gt;and have that combine longsword in a week.  The thing is, I don&#39;t usually<br/>
&gt; &gt;hunt<br/>
&gt; &gt;for creatures hit by magic only because there&#39;s so many critters running<br/>
&gt; &gt;round<br/>
&gt; &gt;that don&#39;t have that limitation!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So here&#39;s a question for you higher-level paladins (16th and over) - at<br/>
&gt; &gt;what<br/>
&gt; &gt;level does it become necessary to have a magic weapon, and can the<br/>
&gt; &gt;situations<br/>
&gt; &gt;that require a magic weapon be handled by our summoned mace?<br/>
