<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654432587">I started my paladin after playing a dark elf necromancer for a little<br/>
while.  I guess it seemed logical to me to balance my evil character<br/>
with a good one.  Just to let everyone know I do nice things with my<br/>
necromancer sometimes too.  Last night I was in the Qeynos catacombs<br/>
invisible and came across a naked guy lost in the catacombs.  I assumed<br/>
he had died and asked if this was so.  He just didn&#39;t have any stuff yet<br/>
so I gave him some cloth armor and 5gp to get him started.  Random acts<br/>
of kindness have helped me at various times.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I have always liked the idea of playing a holy knight and<br/>
paladins get some great combat skills/strengths.  Something to remember<br/>
though is the game is balanced pretty well, so try out some other<br/>
combinations.  I have:<br/>
<br/>
a level 12 barbarian warrior - tank 360hps<br/>
a level 10 dark elf necromancer - fun for soloing<br/>
a level 6 high elf enchanter - created for jewelcraft<br/>
a level 5 dwarven cleric - fun to help people and dwarves are tough<br/>
fighters too<br/>
a level 5 wood elf ranger - tracking is really really neat<br/>
and of course my level 4 human paladin - the good guy fighter, fun to<br/>
help with lay hands<br/>
<br/>
have fun!<br/>

Why? Why not?<br/>
<br/>
First there are the game advantages to Paladins:<br/>
Paladins are great fighters. Paladins get healing spells. Awesome<br/>
special<br/>
ability (Lay Hands). Finally, Verant claims we will get the best magical<br/>
weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Now the role-playing advantages:<br/>
Paladins are trusted me more people. You get to play the hero, saving<br/>
people<br/>
and dying for a good cause.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I don&#39;t like it that it takes me longer to gain a level.<br/>
BUT<br/>
since people like and trust me as a paladin I find it easier to group<br/>
and<br/>
thus I have actually gained levels faster.<br/>
