<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545490669">Where is a good place for a 18th lvl paladin to go solo blues? I have travelled some and cant find a place that is either WAY to crowded or that you MUST have a group to survive the trains. I am on the MM server and am currently in Freeport. ANy and all help is appreciated as I am starting to get bored and want to keep playing. Thanks all.<br/>
