<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131401650">Aye, I walk everywhere I go, sometimes it gets tedious (like when you are<br/>
bound in Freeport and die in Kaladim...ahem) but it is also a great way to<br/>
see Norrath and meet new people. <br/>
<br/>
And for some reason, MOST other people rarely thank me for saving thier<br/>
lives these days..they must not know I used to be Reppik *sigh* oh well, I<br/>
guess Nylyan will have to build his own reputation for kindheartedness and<br/>
stalwartness   =)<br/>

&gt; Its quiet here....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a high level Magician and just recently started a Paladin.  I have to<br/>
&gt; say... I really like him.. but hate not being able to gate.   Do you all<br/>
&gt; just walk the land? Selling and buying from Innkeepers?  Just going back to<br/>
&gt; train?  Or is it not that big or a concern?  I cant remember the last time I<br/>
&gt; actually walked back to a city unless it was just to bind myself there...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway...  I also really hate it when I use LOH on the MOB I&#39;m trying to<br/>
&gt; kill....  It never seems to appreciate it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
