<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944209610">Hail fellow paladins,<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering if anyone has heard the whereabouts of the Man o<br/>
War.  Its a paladin only 2h hammer, and the stats don&#39;t sound too bad.<br/>
I&#39;m in no rush to get it, since I have Ghoulbane and have just recently<br/>
obtained Soulfire (3rd person on the Karana server) after numerous<br/>
attempts on Sir Lucan (of course his testimony is the rare drop...doh).<br/>
Anyways, I&#39;m just trying to bring some life back to this board....feel<br/>
free to post any info on this holy hammer if you know anything =)<br/>
Thanks !<br/>
