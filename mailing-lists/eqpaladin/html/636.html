<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901096130">Hmm that may be, still last i heard no server has one piece of the new paladin armor, and if the cleric armor costs 2k, big deal money comes pretty easily in higher lvls and that is comparable to how much steel costs. I know it will be hard, just will take time, and we are supposed to be humble are we not? Not giving up yet.<br/>
