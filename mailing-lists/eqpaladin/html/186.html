<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510431862">If everyone did some roleplaying, and used their native languages it would<br/>
be a much cooler world. Like going into a city where evryone spoke High Elf,<br/>
and no one really spoke common. Those who knew High Elf would be at an<br/>
advantage. Im wondering, If I learned troll as a NON-troll race, then got<br/>
some good faction not to be KOS and approached an NPC and spoke Troll, maybe<br/>
I could get a good quest, or at least not be turned away. Or maybe if I was<br/>
a Shadow Knight and learned Gnoll, then spoke with one. Who knows the<br/>
possiblities. Im sure if Verant thought about it there could really be some<br/>
good thing to com e out of it.<br/>
	Also, on the topics of improvement, I would like to see monsters and<br/>
creatures actually bad together army style and lay seige to a city. Like<br/>
seeing a Great Shadow Knight and some Buddys lead an army of Gnolls againt<br/>
the city of Quynos. Admittedly alot of newbies would die, but some people<br/>
who were of the same class and such may be spared and could actually attack<br/>
a guard and survive. There would be lag due to the high numbers of<br/>
characters on the screen, but who wouldnt like to see that? Or even if a<br/>
Hill Giant could get to quynos and rampage the city, that would be an<br/>
awesome sight. Its better than spawning little craps about while people<br/>
camp. Verant has to mix it up a bit and through a little chaos in the mix.<br/>
Waiting for Spawn only can yeild a limited amount of enjoyment.<br/>
	I would also like to Organize something on Veeshan Server. I sw the<br/>
clearing of Kerra Isle on Soulsek Ro went amazing (in fact some creative<br/>
players used their cash to arm the Kerrans before the raid, cool) . I think<br/>
If I can find enough people on Veeshan that would be interested, we could<br/>
organize an event like this. Maybe a clearing of Runnyeye? PAW? The Aquaduct<br/>
of Quynos? This wouldn&#39;t be for EXP or items (though people will get that<br/>
anyway), but for a fun experience with alot of players. I feel something<br/>
like this could only up the interest people have in the game.<br/>

  -PS- This is only my Opinion...<br/>
   -email me off the list if you are interested in an Event on Veeshan, dont<br/>
want to Spam anyone =)<br/>

&gt; Hi<br/>
&gt; What is the point of wasting time and a practice point on lauguages? I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; getting way too much crap on languages that has no use.<br/>
