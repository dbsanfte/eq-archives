<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201561307">*If you don&#39;t mind, where can one purchase a Dwarven axe and <br/>
*what are it&#39;s stats?<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 types of Dwarven Axe, one is 1Handed slashing and the other is<br/>
2Handed slashing, both found in Crushbone, and can be purchased from players<br/>
who&#39;ve looted it off the beastie that carries it.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t<br/>
recall the stats offhand or who in CB carries it... <br/>
