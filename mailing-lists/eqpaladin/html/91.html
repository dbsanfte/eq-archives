<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-825223700">I was just wondering if anyone knew of a place I might find a magical<br/>
weapon of some sort. Nothing really powerfull, I&#39;m only 10th lvl right<br/>
now, I just need something that will do damage to iceboned skeletons and<br/>
ghouls. Also, I seem to be making money very slowly. The only trade skills<br/>
I have are cooking and a little blacksmithing. Is there a good zone to<br/>
make money in? The most money I have ever had at one time is 8 pp! Is this<br/>
normal or am I going about things all wrong?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your assistance my friends,<br/>
