<div id="ygrps-yiv-822098290">Hello all, im new to the class and new to the list. I have been playing a Druid for some time, and always wanted to be a paladin, but didnt want to quit. Well the soloing nerf was the last straw, and i have a lot of ?&#39;s for you all ;) First, what are any and all paladin websites? I&#39;m going to be a human, and in the long run, where is the best spot to put my points? Any other tips you can give me as a new paladin? Thanks for your time.<br/>

Unnamed soon to be Paladin</div>
