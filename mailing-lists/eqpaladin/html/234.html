<b>Subject:</b> Freeport Quest Question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929232370">Greetings, I am a new Paladin located in the city of Freeport.  I ran across<br/>
a quest where by I would deliver a message to one of our fellow brothers<br/>
hiding undercover in the Freeport Militia. Unfortunately, he was killed but<br/>
not before giving me a note with information about Zimel&#39;s Blades, which I<br/>
presume is a merchant shop of some type.  I returned with this info to the<br/>
lady paladin, and she sent me to the Office of the People to speak with<br/>
Rashinda, but I seem to have hit a roadblock as I cannot get Rashinda to<br/>
reply to me.  Does anyone know is this quest is working, and if so how I<br/>
might can continue it, or is the outcome not worth the trouble?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>
