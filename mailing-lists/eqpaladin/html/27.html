<div id="ygrps-yiv-330500928">Hail,<br/>
<br/>
I am a level 4 human paladin based in Freeport.  I have been working on<br/>
a quest and need some help.  I&#39;ll list what I know below my questions<br/>
(below a spoiler warning):<br/>
<br/>
I need to know when Grolaf Steadirt leaves his shop and heads to the inn<br/>
for a drink so that I can talk to him.  The time of day and which inn<br/>
would be very helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Now for what I know: (might be considered a spoiler though not complete)<br/>

I received the quest from the female paladin on the upstairs balcony of<br/>
the freeport paladin&#39;s guild.<br/>
<br/>
She asked me to take a note to an informant they have in the Freeport<br/>
militia. I should say &quot;Truth is Good&quot; to the guards and the correct one<br/>
would respond to me.<br/>
<br/>
I found him in west freeport behind the milita house.  sorry, don&#39;t have<br/>
my notes here so can&#39;t remember his name.  He asks for a note you were<br/>
given, you give it to him, and after he gives you something to take<br/>
back.  A note with coded info and a title at the top Zimel&#39;s Blades<br/>
<br/>
after reporting back you are sent to the hall of records to talk to<br/>
Rashinda.  She was a total pain in the butt to get her to respond to my<br/>
question.  Again, I don&#39;t have my notes but it was something like &quot;can<br/>
you tell me if zimel&#39;s blades existed&quot;.  Once she responds a strange<br/>
thing happens.  A male NPC enters the room and says &quot;excuse me, wrong<br/>
room&quot; so he is triggered by talking to Rashinda.  Not sure what he means<br/>
<br/>
After you get her to respond you ask &quot;Who is Ariska Zimel ?&quot; I think I<br/>
spelled his name right...  She will tell you about him and mention<br/>
Groflah Steadirt (in Groflah&#39;s Armor place).  It is up to you to make<br/>
the associated to talk to Groflah.<br/>
<br/>
When you find him (upstairs) and ask him about Zimel he responds that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t know any Zimel and that he can&#39;t talk there.  It is here that<br/>
I&#39;m stuck.  I&#39;ve heard he leaves and goes to get a drink but I don&#39;t<br/>
know when or where.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help<br/>
