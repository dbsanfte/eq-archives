It is <br/>\ndefinitely the most awe-inspiring. There is something about seeing a flaming <br/>\nsword in front of your eyes. It has a damage of 35 and a delay of only 45. <br/>\nPerhaps more importantly it casts inferno shock randomly when it <br/>\nsuccessfully hits which will deal a whopping amount of damage.<br/>\nGhoulbane<br/>\nGhoulbane is the first of the paladins&#39; holy swords. It can be found off the <br/>\nFroglock Lord in the palace area of Upper Guk. I do not have the stats on <br/>\nthis weapon as it has been changed since I last seen it. It is a one handed <br/>\nslashing weapon with 15 dmg and 34 delay. It also casts dismiss undead <br/>\noccasionally on a successful hit. It is a paladin only weapon.<br/>\nDemon Claw<br/>\nThis one handed slashing weapon is found on the avatar in Cazic Thule. They <br/>\nresemble freddy kruger&#39;s glove and have a dmg of 5 and a delay of 19.<br/>\nEbony Blade<br/>\nThe ebony blade is a ranger only one-handed sword. This sword has a damage <br/>\nof 7, a delay of 24 and casts ensnaring roots when it hits.<br/>\nBarbed Leather Whip<br/>\nThe barbed whip is a magical 1h-slashing weapon found on Bonecrusher at <br/>\nNajena. It is a favorite among duel wielding rangers and warriors. Barbed <br/>\nwhips are not only magic but sport a damage factor of 7 and a delay of only <br/>\n28.<br/>\nCrystalline Sword<br/>\nThis sword is one of the better swords probably. It has a damage of 11, <br/>\ndelay of 38 and is one handed.<br/>\nDwarven Axe<br/>\nThese items can be found on the Orc Lord at Crushbone.  1 handed dwarven <br/>\naxes the best non-magical 1 handed slashing weapons in the game. They <br/>\nfeature a damage of 6 and an attack delay of only 26. They are also much <br/>\nlighter than minotaur axe, which is important when, duel wielding. 2 handed <br/>\ndwarven axes can be found rarely on the Lord at crushbone. These axes have a <br/>\ndamage of 14 and a delay of 43. They are non-magical but are very efficient.<br/>\nPolished Granite Tomahawk<br/>\nNice magic 1H Slashing weapon found in High Pass Hold. It has a damage of 6 <br/>\nwith only a 26 delay, as well as occasionally casting &#39;Berserker Strength&#39; <br/>\non the wielder, giving +18 Str bonus, -10 Agility penalty, and a 50 to 150 <br/>\nhit point damage shield.<br/>\nTentacle Whip<br/>\nTentacle Whips has 4 dmg and 25 delay and can be found on Tentacle Terrors. <br/>\nTentacle Whips are often used by mid-teen level characters, as a second <br/>\nweapon, because of its magical nature. Lifetap drains hit points from the <br/>\nmonster and gives them to the wielder.<br/>\nMinotaur Axe<br/>\nMinotaur axes can be found on the minotaurs of Steamfont and Beholder. They <br/>\nare better than store bought weapons and thus are a favorite amongst level <br/>\n8-15 characters. Minotaur axes pack 8 damage into 37 delay. They are <br/>\nnon-magical and are a bit on the heavy side.<br/>\nOaken Scimitar<br/>\nThe Oaken Scimitar is probably the best scimitar in the game. Great weapons <br/>\nmade for druids. It offers +9 to wisdom.<br/>\n<br/>\n2-Handed Slashing<br/>\nBone Bladed Claymore<br/>\nThe Bone Bladed Claymore is a magical two handed slashing weapon that is <br/>\nfound on the final shadowknight in Befallen. I don&#39;t have the stats on me <br/>\noff hand(they changed since I last had it) but it is a very good weapon for <br/>\ntwo-handed wielders in the 20-30 level range. The disadvantage is that it <br/>\ncarries with it a negative adjustment to your agility score. It grants a <br/>\ndamage of 17 a delay of 45 but penalizes you by -8 to your agility.<br/>\nDark Reaver<br/>\nThe dark reaver is a powerful Shadowknight only sword. It has a damage of 20 <br/>\nand a delay of 42. It also has a strength-sapping spell, which will go off <br/>\nfrom time to time.<br/>\nExecutioner&#39;s Axe<br/>\nThe executioner&#39;s axe is a powerful warrior only 2 handed axe. It has a <br/>\ndamage of 25 and a delay of 50. The most important strength of this axe <br/>\nhowever is the haste effect that goes off from time to time. When this <br/>\neffect goes off you will begin to hit extremely fast.<br/>\nGiant Hzweihander<br/>\nThis powerful 2 handed slashing weapon can be found on Karg Icebear in <br/>\nEverfrost. It has a damage of 18 and a delay of 39.<br/>\nOpal Scythe<br/>\nThis scythe can be found on Lord Grimrot in South Karana. It is a warrior <br/>\nand shadowknight only 2 handed slashing weapon. Damage is 11, delay is 45. <br/>\nIt has an innate disease cloud spell as well as appearing to have a strength <br/>\ntapping effect when wielded by Grimrot himself (although it does not appear <br/>\non the weapons list of effects).<br/>\nShiny Brass Halberd<br/>\nThis halberd can be found off a rare pop orc in High Hold Pass. This magical <br/>\ntwo-handed slashing weapon has a damage of 16 and a delay of 48.<br/>\nSilvery Two Handed Axe<br/>\nThis 2 handed slashing weapon can be found in Permafrost. It has a damage of <br/>\n17 and a delay of only 48.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
