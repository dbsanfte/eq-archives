I have no other information as of yet, but will share with group when I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I don&#39;t think people realize (especially if it&#39;s crowded and there&#39;s lots going on) that we just saved their lives -- all they know is they were as good as dead, then they&#39;re fully healed.  Next thing you know, the crowd has scattered to the four winds and it&#39;s running hot and cold gnolls (and that LoH ain&#39;t coming back anytime soon...)<br/>\nIt&#39;s different in a group situation, because my group knows who just pulled their fat out of the fryer, and they will generally show their appreciation with &quot;Thanks&quot; and &quot;pats on back&quot;, and absolutely _WILL NOT_ abandon me.  It&#39;s a nice feeling to be that appreciated, and a huge part of why I&#39;m a paladin in Norrath in the first place!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kaladin, 9th order of Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also to comment on something else I read in one of the mails...<br/>\n&gt; I would have to agree with the attitude of most people when a &quot;Holy Knight&quot; comes to the rescue (more often to our folly as the &quot;rescuees&quot; run and the &quot;rescuer&quot; gets stuck with the fiends) and either lays hands or heals to the end of mana, as being less than satisfying.  I however, feel like I helped someone, albeit most likely someone who will watch me die in the future and not lift a finger to help.  I think my chances are a bit better for someone to help me if I help others and not watch another die while not even trying to help.  Also from a role-playing aspect, I do believe the right thing is being done, never would a Paladin turn his head to such persons in distress.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n         Gary Long, Vice President, Valley Internet Services<br/>\n         ...Web Commerce is what we do, all day every day...<br/>\nPh:(916)498-1920 Fax:(916)498-1932  1611 S St #202 Sacramento,CA 95814<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.valley-internet.com\">http://www.valley-internet.com</a> -  For all your business hosting needs.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.securetrans.com\">http://www.securetrans.com</a> -  Accept credit cards online in real-time!<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
