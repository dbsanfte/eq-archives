I have one<br/>\nnow after watching the message rooms closely and continuosly watching<br/>\nauctions in the game.  I happened on someone who sold it to me for 20 plat,<br/>\ngood deal.  I have seen people asking as much 30-40 plat.  It is nice having<br/>\nthis shield.  It puts off light like a lightstone and adds to magic<br/>\nresistance as well as having 10 ac and being a magic item you can bash magic<br/>\ncreatures with.  They are pretty rare from what I can find out.  Right now I<br/>\nam trying to obtain a 2h shiny brass halberd.  I have seen people selling<br/>\nthem but haven&#39;t been able to hook up with anyone and purchase one.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrod<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mxyzptlk [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hlf10@...\">hlf10@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 24, 1999 5:02 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqpaladin] Keeping the Paladin alive<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Mxyzptlk &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hlf10@...\">hlf10@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo answer a few questions first:<br/>\nI play on the Rathe server as a humble Dwarf Paladin named &quot;Dauldon<br/>\nBlackstone&quot;<br/>\nI was wondering about the list myself, glad to see it is still here.<br/>\nI have not seen any remnants of the Elven empire in the deserts of Ro.<br/>\n<br/>\nA question:<br/>\nI am not certain how the other servers operate, however on Rathe, it seems<br/>\nthat a shiny brass shield is now one of the more rare items in the game.  I<br/>\nhave seen one being sold for as high as 100 platinum (ouch).  The area that<br/>\nspawns the creature that occasionally has the shield, is always camped, no<br/>\nmatter the time of day I try.  A magic shield, as you all know, is a nice<br/>\nbenefit to have with the bashing ability, to be able to hit creatures that<br/>\nneed magic to cause damage against them.  Let me get to the question before<br/>\nI get to far off here.<br/>\nAre there other magic shields that we as Paladins can use?<br/>\nIf so, would you mind sharing the information.  It does not have to be very<br/>\nspecific, just a hint or twelve &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso to comment on something else I read in one of the mails... <br/>\nI would have to agree with the attitude of most people when a &quot;Holy Knight&quot;<br/>\ncomes to the rescue (more often to our folly as the &quot;rescuees&quot; run and the<br/>\n&quot;rescuer&quot; gets stuck with the fiends) and either lays hands or heals to the<br/>\nend of mana, as being less than satisfying.  I however, feel like I helped<br/>\nsomeone, albeit most likely someone who will watch me die in the future and<br/>\nnot lift a finger to help.  I think my chances are a bit better for someone<br/>\nto help me if I help others and not watch another die while not even trying<br/>\nto help.  Also from a role-playing aspect, I do believe the right thing is<br/>\nbeing done, never would a Paladin turn his head to such persons in distress.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWhere do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAt ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
