This list is kinda on the quiet side and i was hoping to help incite<br/>\nsome life into it.  If something interesting happened to you on day while<br/>\nplaying or you ran across something cool or you just have a question...share<br/>\nit with all here. I myself like hearing about someone&#39;s interesting<br/>\nexperience as I might learn something from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, i forgot to tell why I chose a paladin. To me, a paladin is like a<br/>\nknight in shining armor.... swooping in to save the day and all that. They<br/>\nare like a super-hero. Me, i like sharing and helping others and most expect<br/>\na paladin to do just that . I want to be that knight coming to save the<br/>\nday.. fight against insurmountable odds so your friends can live to fight<br/>\nanother day. I chose Half-Elf because high elves and Erudites are too<br/>\nconceited, Dwarves are too short(no offense intended) and I play a human in<br/>\nRL.<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                    Abrell of Cazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
