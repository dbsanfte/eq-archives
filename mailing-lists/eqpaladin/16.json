Oh one <br/>\nthing to note all beware entering ak&#39;anon. I used to hunt there regulary and <br/>\nbewaring the mino hero I had myself bound to Ak&#39;anon. The other day I was <br/>\nkilled and reappeared at my normal spot near entrance to my surpirse I was <br/>\nswiftly killed by a clockwork merchant who proclaimed me a heathen. Turns out <br/>\nmy choosen diety doesnt work well with him, to make a long story short, due <br/>\nto load times, he killed me three times in a row before I could even have <br/>\ntime to move out of zone, losing over 4 hours worth of work, needless to say <br/>\ndropping back down to 11th lvl didn&#39;t sit well with me. I thought I would <br/>\npass along info being that merchant is right by zone, at least on my server <br/>\n(Terrew Marr)<br/>\n<br/>\nSha&#39;kel<br/>\n(Almost 12 lvl again paladin)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
