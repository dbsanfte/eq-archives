I keep getting bashed by sandgiants in oasis and want to find a safe, not very crowded spot to gain leves at. Also What are the stats on the Ghoulsbane Dmg/del ratio etc. Also what about other holy swords. Also had anyone heard of when the two other continents are coming up? and what changes will that make to the gameing system, will there be more spells, access to lvls higher than lvl 50 etc.<br/>\nThank you<br/>\nLaurana Highwind<br/>\nPaladin of Tunare, 17th rank<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\nList Moderator</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
