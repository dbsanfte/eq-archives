I had been shooting blue items with my Bow<br/>\nall day long and had not been able to raise the skill.  So I had decided to<br/>\nput more practices into it even though it is expensive.  And the trainer<br/>\nsaid I had reached my skill limit or some such wording and could not offer<br/>\nme any further training in that skill.  My skill level is only Good, which<br/>\nis about what? 75 or so?  Is this my limit for all time?  Or does this go up<br/>\nin the future?  This is frustrating, cause I still miss quite a bit.  Any<br/>\nfeedback would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrod<br/>\nNewly 24th Level Paladin<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
