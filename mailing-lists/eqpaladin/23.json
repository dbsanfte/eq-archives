I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the best way, but I always seem to learn from my mistakes.  In any case, I have been posting to Povar only to find out I haven&#39;t. =)  I was wondering why I wasn&#39;t getting my own letters sent back to me, or why nobody would reply to my questions.  Heh anyway, here&#39;s a tip for the list:<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure your address recorded in your email is the address the list is being sent to.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr at least, the email address you gave to Onelist.  All this time I had my email addy as a different address (one I give to people I don&#39;t trust. =) ).  So if you are posting, and your questioning whether it&#39;s going through or not, it&#39;s not!  Well, that is, if you don&#39;t get your own responses back.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this has been a moment of stupidity brought to you by yours truly. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nTiresias<br/>\nServant of Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
