Over on the Xegony server the BEST prices i got for my <br/>\nstuff was 4 for bracers and mask, 8-10 for most stuff, tunic was like 12-15 <br/>\ni think.  Heck I bought a RING mail coat for 15 pp!  At any rate, that&#39;s the <br/>\ncheapest I&#39;ve seen it, but I haven&#39;t sen any prices near where yours lie.  <br/>\nPerhaps I should start smithing on the server and ruin the market, hehe!<br/>\n<br/>\nOlphilio<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
