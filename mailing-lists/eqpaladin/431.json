I recently spoke with a prisoner of the Freeport Milita, appatently he has been beaten or drugged senseless, but When I mentioned the name of the infamous Zimel to him, he looked deep into my eyes with understanding ( A prisoner gazes deep into your eyes (kinda eerie) When I mentioned the Sword of his Creation, this prisoner said something gutteral, his words were &quot;nnnn... Girkle.... Grunk.... Shoo Bog n&#39; Goo&quot;. He did not respond to anything else, only the name Zimel and the sword Soulfire. Maybe we are all going the wrong way in the search for Zimel, maybe the one underground is A fake.... and Maybe if you kill the Prison guards....<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso in my Travels for the Test of truth, I gave a tunic to Altunic, and he said that I was too weak for him to talk to me.....<br/>\n<br/>\nLaurana Highwind<br/>\nPaladin of the 21st Rank<br/>\nList mediator</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
