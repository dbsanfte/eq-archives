You&#39;ll<br/>\nbe able to configure your macro simply by typing in the box on the center<br/>\nof the screen.  Start with /say and then your messsage.  Don&#39;t forget to<br/>\nrename your button, which you can do by clicking in the box at the top of<br/>\nthe screen with the current button name on it.  Click done when you&#39;ve put<br/>\nin the text you want and renamed the button.  I suggest dragging it to a<br/>\nhot button spot so that it&#39;s easy to get to after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nLorimi<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
