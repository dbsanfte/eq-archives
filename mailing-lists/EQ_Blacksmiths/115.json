It&#39;d be near Rivervale if<br/>\nanywhere.  You can get large molds from the McMannus Village in the west<br/>\nplains of Karana, and medium from the Sayers in the cottage on the road<br/>\nbetween Qeynos and Surefall Glade.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;Jyzan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
