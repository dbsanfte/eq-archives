But now that I&#39;m much higher level (36), and I have found that magic armor is very rare and hard to come by.  Its annoying enough to see someone twink out their guild buddies or secondary characters in rare, highly sought after magical armor.  Now that the game is a few months old and money is in great abundance, can you immagine all the newbies running around in magic player made armor?  It would be sickening.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a>&gt; 7.13.99 3:45:01 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nEnchanted sheet metal.
