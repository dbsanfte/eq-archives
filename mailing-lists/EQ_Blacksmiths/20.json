Stone<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, from what I understand (I&#39;m not a blacksmith, but have been<br/>\nresearching it a bit), you can use blacksmithing skill to get a rusty<br/>\nweapon<br/>\nto tarnished, which will (I believe) decrease the delay, but leave the<br/>\ndamage alone. If your successful in trying, you get a tarnished weapon.<br/>\nIf<br/>\nyou fail, you destroy the weapon. The exact procedure, I&#39;m not sure of,<br/>\nsorry.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen a doc on blacksmithing somewhere on a board that had<br/>\nsharpening of<br/>\nweapons in it, but I can&#39;t find it at the moment.
