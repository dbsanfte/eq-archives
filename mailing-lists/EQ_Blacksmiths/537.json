Guess I won&#39;t be taking<br/>\nup blade forging, seeing as how most FS weapons on my server go for around<br/>\n5-10pp anyway. Not much profit there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Bonecrkr&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bonecrkr@...\">bonecrkr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So what do people think of the new smith items?  I have made a sample of<br/>\n&gt; each and auctioned them on E Marr.  I got 3 or 4 inquiries from other<br/>\n&gt; smiths<br/>\n&gt; on how to make them and not a single inquiry about the price, etc. from<br/>\n&gt; anyone else.  The weapons cost roughly 5pp to make, BTW.  I have heard the<br/>\n&gt; stats are not as good as fine steel weapons.  Can someone who knows the<br/>\n&gt; fine<br/>\n&gt; steel weapon stats, post them for comparison?  These are the new items:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Forged Morning Star, 1HB, 8 damage, 38 delay<br/>\n&gt; 1 water + 1 metal sheet + Hilt Mold + Spiked Ball Mold<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Forged 2-handed Sword, 2HS, 12dmg, 44 delay<br/>\n&gt; 1 water + 1 metal sheet + Hilt Mold + Pommel Mold + Heavy Steel Blade Mold<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Forged Bastard Sword, 1HS, 7 damage, 33 delay<br/>\n&gt; 1 water + 1 metal sheet + Hilt Mold + Pommel Mold + Dual Edge Blade Mold<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The molds can be found off a vendor in Butcher Block, right outside of<br/>\n&gt; Kaladmim.  Mold prices with amiable faction and high charisma:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dual Edge Blade Mold   1p 9g 1s 8c<br/>\n&gt; Heavy Steel Blade Mold 3p 8g 3s 6c<br/>\n&gt; Spiked Ball Mold       2p 5g 5s 7c<br/>\n&gt; Hilt Mold                 6g 3s 9c<br/>\n&gt; Pommel Mold               6g 3s 9c<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any ideas on what we should charge for these?  Anyone know where else the<br/>\n&gt; molds can be bought or any new items we can make?  I&#39;d particularly like<br/>\n&gt; confirmation on the Paladin in Solusek Ro that gives a quest for armor<br/>\n&gt; molds.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Haniel the ForgeMaster, E Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
