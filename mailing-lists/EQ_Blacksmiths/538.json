Although I have actually been called a crook<br/>\nfor selling stuff at these prices. There is one guy on<br/>\nTunare that make and enitire suit minus the leggs for<br/>\n70 plat. It would be nice if I could actually make a<br/>\nprofit. The going price is 1plat per ac on Tunare =(<br/>\nas we have only on the RARE occassion been able to<br/>\nsell for anything higher then that without being<br/>\nopenly laughed at.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Bonecrkr &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bonecrkr@...\">bonecrkr@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I like this idea alot.  If it became widespread, it<br/>\n&gt; would once and for all<br/>\n&gt; shut the mouths of the assholes out there trying to<br/>\n&gt; tell you what you should<br/>\n&gt; charge them for banded.  Lately, I&#39;ve been harassed<br/>\n&gt; by people saying (lying<br/>\n&gt; actually) that the going rate for banded is now 1pp<br/>\n&gt; per AC and getting real<br/>\n&gt; upset when I tell them no.  The other source of<br/>\n&gt; misinformation comes to<br/>\n&gt; these people when they buy a banded gorget for 2-3pp<br/>\n&gt; from the wannabee<br/>\n&gt; smiths that never get there skill much past 50 (you<br/>\n&gt; people on E Marr near<br/>\n&gt; Freeport know who I am talking about).  There are<br/>\n&gt; perhaps 5 of us really<br/>\n&gt; active in smithing on E Marr and I know 2 of the<br/>\n&gt; other people for sure.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll try to get in touch with them and see what they<br/>\n&gt; think.  The prices<br/>\n&gt; esposed on the site are about 1 to 2pp higher than I<br/>\n&gt; charge now (5pp per<br/>\n&gt; sheet needed to make an item, 15pp for cloaks).<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
