I mean it happens to REAL armor doesn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, as everyone knows, almost everything else has a &#39;failure rate&#39; of some<br/>\nsort in the game... Failure to MAKE armor, failure to cast spells, failure<br/>\nto hit a mob, etc.  So, why not failing armor as well?<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, it should be DAMAGED, not just &#39;deteriorating&#39; in some way... Damaged<br/>\nin battle, against, say RED mobs...  And yes, only after you have had it for<br/>\na long time...<br/>\n<br/>\nDamaged Armor could still be used, but it could be, for example, only HALF<br/>\nas effective as it used to be (with all that bailing wire holding it<br/>\ntogether, it&#39;s still THERE isn&#39;t it?  hehe...) when bought new!<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, don&#39;t make it slowly &#39;deteriorate&#39; and require maintenance because of<br/>\nit... Let it be damaged in battle!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, just my 2 coppers worth...<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\nProud member of Platinum Sphere Guild - www.platinumsphere.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
