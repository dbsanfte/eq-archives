This is no different than the idea of rusty and tarnished weapons already in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-852010938\">Ok, here is another possible idea, what do you all think:<br/>\n<br/>\nArmor/Weapon QUALITY.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is no different than the idea of rusty and tarnished weapons<br/>\nalready in use, and could extend to the well-balanced.  I&#39;m not<br/>\nadvocating true item deterioration.  The item would not go away.  It<br/>\nsimply gets &quot;used&quot; till it&#39;s not as good.  Also magical items do not<br/>\nnecessarily EVER get worn, they magically stay pristine.  Weaker magic<br/>\nitems, like those enchanted with minor bonuses would wear, but not Lore<br/>\nItems for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this is how it would work.  A Player gets an item and uses it.  From<br/>\nuse (and not from sitting in a bank box) the item takes wear and the<br/>\nquality adjustment is made to it.  If player faction can be tracked for<br/>\nevery little thing, so can this.  It can be computed after fights in the<br/>\nsame way if need be.  Worn items work less effectively.  Less<br/>\nabsorbtion/less AC, slower duration/less damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nItems which are worn are taken to a smith to repair/sharpen.  The amount<br/>\nof improvement IS DEPENDENT ON THE SKILL OF THE SMITH.  Master smiths do<br/>\na better job.  Average smiths can only repair to a certain level. This<br/>\nis both more realistic and helps make master more relevant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s NPCs.  Ok, so let NPCs sell all the same armor PCs can, at<br/>\nrealistic prices.  NPCs are not all masters.  Different smiths have<br/>\ndifferent skills.  PCs will always be able to attain a higher skill than<br/>\nany NPC in the game.  Items sold from an NPC will immediately not be of<br/>\nas good a quality as one made by a PC master.  If a player wants to buy<br/>\nfrom an NPC at a cheaper price for a cheaper item, fine.  The NPC prices<br/>\nought to be lowered a bit, granted, but then that also goes to show that<br/>\nPCs would then sell based on their skill.  Why should a master of 150<br/>\nsell his items for the same as a new smith of 80 practicing gorgets?<br/>\nThe master has worked his up and should get a better quality product.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, NPCs should buy from PCs with quality in mind.<br/>\nPerhaps an NPC gives a level or two price below the selling price of a<br/>\npristine piece.  As you get higher into master, you get more profit from<br/>\nthe selling.  Initially the only way for a PC to make profit would be<br/>\nfrom other PCs, but then as you get might higher selling to NPCs would<br/>\ngenerate a profit.  Smithing is expensive, as really all trades should<br/>\nbe (relatively speaking).  Brewing had the problem recently where you<br/>\ncould buy for nothing and sell for much more to NPCs as master, and make<br/>\nmaster in an hour with only 5pp.  They&#39;ve reduced the profit to nearly<br/>\nnothing now, and are introducing more brews for higher skill<br/>\nadvancement.  The same can apply to smithing.  Verant does not want<br/>\npeople to be able to make a living on a trade selling to NPCs.  But if a<br/>\nplayer must spend 150pp+ and spend long hours to become a master that<br/>\nmakes just a little profit, good.  It&#39;ll not be worth the time or<br/>\nmoney.  What it&#39;ll do it also stabilize the economy.  PCs wanting to buy<br/>\nweapons and armor will have to buy from the NPCs, or by from a player at<br/>\nbetter than what the NPC will take for it.  The only real &quot;deals&quot; for<br/>\nplayers needing items will come from charity.  Better smiths will get a<br/>\nbetter price from the NPC, and so their items will cost more to other<br/>\nplayers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same goes for other trades like cooking, pottery and brewing that<br/>\ntend to be only a sell to NPC market.  They will make  a profit, but not<br/>\nthat much and only more profit if they truly practice it higher.  All<br/>\nskills should take a long time and more money to master.  That will make<br/>\nthe NPC profits more acceptable for Verant, and make being a master more<br/>\nvaluable as less attain it.  Think of tailoring where a master tailor<br/>\nmaking reinforced can make better armor than a below average smith just<br/>\nstarting out.  And the reinforced will be far lighter.  It will make it<br/>\nmore worthwhile to have ALL the armor types in use.  All I see these<br/>\ndays is banded and bronze plate.  I don&#39;t even hear people selling ring<br/>\nanymore.  Let smiths make it too.  That&#39;s why I keep mentioning weapons,<br/>\nas smiths should be allowed to make them as much as any armor.  (Hmm<br/>\nweapon smithing as a new skill separate from armor smithing...?  bowyer<br/>\nand fletcher separate? tanner for hides, and tailor for sewing?  People<br/>\nget to go to a &quot;specialist&quot; for their goods, again more realistic.)<br/>\n<br/>\nItems need not disappear.  Battered armor doesn&#39;t just go away, it&#39;s all<br/>\nrusty and dented and needs some work.  A smith can add some metal bits,<br/>\nand take his hammer and pliers to it and fix things up.  At the same<br/>\ntime, truly, all this magical item dropping from creatures should be<br/>\nscaled back a little.  Regular weapons and armor dropped from mobs<br/>\nshould be of &quot;used&quot; lesser quality.  &quot;Why buy from a smith when I can<br/>\ncamp all I need from this mob?&quot;  Well because you get a better quality<br/>\nitem for your money and the smith&#39;s time.  It&#39;ll cut down on the campers<br/>\nfor one, and then make it so that having a magical item is worth<br/>\nsomething.  A quest that always returns an item will be more worthwhile<br/>\nthan going after a mob that drops only 10% of the time.  All regular<br/>\narmor would be purchased from smiths (NPC or PC) or at least repaired by<br/>\na smith when found or bought in the field.  PErhaps the thing to also do<br/>\nit make it so that lesser mobs for players in the teens and twenties<br/>\ntend to drop more &quot;charged&quot; items while the higher 30+ mobs drop more<br/>\npermanent effect items.  Give out potions and 5 use items.  When they<br/>\nare used up, they are useless or nearly so.  That&#39;ll maintain this<br/>\nmarket of regular armors and weapons nicely.  Just seem that regular<br/>\nitems, leathers, chain, normal weapons are rare to all but those under<br/>\nlevel 5.  Sad.  There are constant auctions of all these &quot;extra&quot; magical<br/>\nitems in every zone.  It&#39;s as Monty Hall as it can get.  Make it so<br/>\nSmiths can actually MAKE things, and then make it so what they make is<br/>\nUSEFUL and then we will have a better place for smiths and well everyone<br/>\nelse too.<br/>\n<br/>\nDalinor<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
