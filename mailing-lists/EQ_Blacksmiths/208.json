Have a <br/>\nlimit on the number of people that can go into it. This would be great for <br/>\npeople into trade skills. 2 friends smithing together, put all profit into <br/>\nthe account. Have it completely seperate from the original ones. And have all <br/>\nplayers consent to it, so that Verant can&#39;t do anything about stolen money. <br/>\nJust say sorry. I think this would be very cool.
