About chain and ringmail.  On any account, if you sell an item<br/>\nto a merchant by accident, and mean to buy it back, but scroll down it&#39;s<br/>\nentire inventory and find nothing, that is because it&#39;s not &quot;on the shelf&quot;,<br/>\nso to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to buy out other items on the merchant to have more items in it&#39;s<br/>\ninventory come to show.  Don&#39;t buy the items that the merchant normally<br/>\nsells....they have endless stock of them.  Only those that people sell the<br/>\nmerchant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI once accidentally sold a runed totem staff to a merchant, but it wasn&#39;t on<br/>\nthe merchants &quot;shelf&quot;.  So I bought out item after item after item until<br/>\nfinally there was my staff.  Well, the merchant wanted 61pp for it, and I<br/>\nsaid fuck that and bought another for 20pp.  Ah well.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaijar the Mage Blacksmith<br/>\n&quot;God?  I follow no god.  I AM my own god!
