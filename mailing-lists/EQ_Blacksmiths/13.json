If your successful in trying, you get a tarnished weapon. If<br/>\nyou fail, you destroy the weapon. The exact procedure, I&#39;m not sure of,<br/>\nsorry.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen a doc on blacksmithing somewhere on a board that had sharpening of<br/>\nweapons in it, but I can&#39;t find it at the moment.

Stone<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, basic question I know, but I have to ask anyway.  I have a rusted sword,<br/>\nhow do I get it to good quality again?  I would think a sharpening stone.  I<br/>\nguess the question is how do you make a sharpenting stone, or do you obtain<br/>\nit some place and then how do you apply it?  I found the guy I can purchase<br/>\nore from and can get a flask of water.  I haven&#39;t even opened up<br/>\nblacksmithing yet (will this evening).  Can any one give me a little<br/>\nguidence on the best way to open this skill up other than trial and error.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks for any help<br/>\n <br/>\nDavid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
