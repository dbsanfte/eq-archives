All you&#39;ll get is a crashing market on your head and a poisoned dagger in<br/>\nyour back.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n- I hope you&#39;re not implying that we cannot determine our own pricing on the<br/>\nitems we worked hard on to make for fear of making &quot;enemies.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Back to the point, though, your argument with me so far has been that price<br/>\nfixing won&#39;t work<br/>\nbecause people will always sell for lower and customers will refuse to buy for<br/>\nthe higher<br/>\nprice. The truth is, people are starting to sell for higher all across the<br/>\nboards, and<br/>\ncustomers are buying at a greater profit to those of us who have decided to<br/>\nprice raise.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n- Again read up on how price affects a supply and demand model.  The reason<br/>\npeople pay higher prices is not because the price is higher.  It&#39;s because the<br/>\ndemand is higher in comparison to the supply.  As more smiths  enter our<br/>\nmarkets the supply will be higher. Either way this market is going to crash. <br/>\nIt won&#39;t be due to people undercutting themselves.  It&#39;s called planned<br/>\nobsolesence.  If you don&#39;t know what that means, it&#39;s what other people have<br/>\ntalked about recently.  We are making products that once  our supply has met<br/>\nthe demand of the market we have have nothing but a bunch of worthless metal<br/>\nin our inventory,  because there is no need to replace or repair the item. <br/>\nWith that in mind who wants to play musical chairs with their inventory and<br/>\npricing?  In truth I have never sold an item more than 10% less than what the<br/>\n&quot;going price&quot; is,  but my point the whole time has been that I will not enter<br/>\ninto an agreement with people to set my prices.  I will sell my product on<br/>\nwhat I deem to be a fair price.<br/>\nLikewise if I feel prices are getting artificially high I won&#39;t increase my<br/>\nprices for them.  I don&#39;t work in a nursing home.  I graduated with a degree<br/>\nin accounting from one of the 10 best universities for accounting in the<br/>\ncountry and am now working as a stock trader.  I will sell at the prices the<br/>\nmarket demands as long as I&#39;m happy with my profits.  You can sell at yours<br/>\nand hope the market doesn&#39;t disappear on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nCerran<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
