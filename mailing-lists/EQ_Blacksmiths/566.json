Dont know if true but hope so. I highly doubt we&#39;ll ever be allowed to create anything magical though. And if we did, not without an Enchanter to enchant the stuff which&#39;d put a crimp in the works in a big way to find then bribe them. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs there in game a metal that inherently has magical properties, like say mithril?<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if they&#39;d let a cleric of a Smith or warrior type god enchant armor and weapons too. :) That&#39;d be a nice thing for the clerics to get.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannyn, Smith 71<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Michael Perry &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:perrym4@...\">perrym4@...</a>&gt; 11/05/99 10:21AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: Michael Perry &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:perrym4@...\">perrym4@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I noticed the forge too. It&#39;s not for the paladin armor though, we forge that armor with only two slots (armor mold and bar of ronium, we don&#39;t even use water to forge it.) I&#39;m guessing that they either added something to the game, or are going to in the near future. (Maybe we&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt; able to finally forge things that have magic properties, or they&#39;ll add new weapons, or plate mail.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Gram<br/>\n41st level High Elven Paladin<br/>\nBristlebane server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 4 Nov 1999 14:14:41 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: Paul Heenan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pheenan@...\">pheenan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: What happened to the forge?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, what exactly happened in the patch yesterday?
