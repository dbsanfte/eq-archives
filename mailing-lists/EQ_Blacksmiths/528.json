Unfortunately they&#39;re not quite as good as FS, so hopefully they&#39;ll be either enchantable or a stepping-stone to a high enough skill level to make plate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother item, not exactly a change but of interest to those smiths who are paladins like myself: the new Temple zone supposedly has a Paladin who will give you or give you quests for molds to make special armor. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t get on to see what other changes may have taken place to smithing, but check your vendors, check your books, and post back to the list what you find.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nAraman of E&#39;ci<br/>\n17th level Paladin<br/>\nSkill 142 Smith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
