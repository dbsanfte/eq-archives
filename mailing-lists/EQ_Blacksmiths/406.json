I&#39;d just<br/>\norder a ton of tunics and watch as they lose money. Then I&#39;d suggest they sell<br/>\nthem at the raised prices that I am and watch as they get all happy and realize<br/>\nthey could make money after all :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need an excuse to order that many tunics, just say you&#39;re supplying your<br/>\nguild.

I haven&#39;t reached the level where<br/>\n&gt; I can make banded yet, but when I get there, I want more than a few gold<br/>\n&gt; profit for my wares.  I do have a further suggestion though.  When you see<br/>\n&gt; people selling at a few gold above cost, bargain with them to get their<br/>\n&gt; prices lower, and buy out their stock.  Then, sell it yourself at the fixed<br/>\n&gt; price.  So long as the person doesn&#39;t run fight back to the forge and make<br/>\n&gt; up a new suit of 3gp profit banded, you&#39;ve got yourself more supply without<br/>\n&gt; the time and effort of making it and without and without the failure costs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My two cents, free of charge.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Worthing, World of Rodnet Cife<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Attention ONElist list owners!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out the new &quot;DEFAULT MODERATED STATUS&quot; option.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
