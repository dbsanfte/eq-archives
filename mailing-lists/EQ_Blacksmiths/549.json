Players simply don&#39;t want them.  Lol, very<br/>\nfew want FS either (been just dumping them on vendors due to extreme lack of<br/>\ninterest).  The ONLY way these would become a viable item is if they became<br/>\nable to hit magic (and I mean for the same price/difficulty of producing<br/>\nthem now).  My thoughts on this are that almost none of the new characters<br/>\nmoving from newbieland into their early teens are non-twinked.  Seeing ALOT<br/>\nof level 1 to 5 players with full bronze (my smith RARELY gets asked to<br/>\ntwink banded or even get the occassional order of a piece or 2 by legitimate<br/>\nnew players), magic weapons, and Flowing Black Robes etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;    Date: Sun, 24 Oct 1999 17:42:54 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: Darrell Runyan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:runyan@...\">runyan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Forged Weapons<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think the problem with pricing and manufacturing costs on the new<br/>\n&gt; weapons is due to the disparity between what Verant thinks the weapons<br/>\n&gt; are worth and what the players will actually pay for them.   The store<br/>\n&gt; prices on most fine steel weapons is from 30-40 pp in the shops, but you<br/>\n&gt; can buy them by the tons on Karana for 4-8 pp each from players.  That<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t cover the costs of our molds, much less taking failures into<br/>\n&gt; account.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Most people I know want magic weapons by the time they are 15th level so<br/>\n&gt; they can hunt critters you need magic weapons for.  Prior to 15th level<br/>\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t really matter much what you use for a weapon.  I think the<br/>\n&gt; weapons are a nice idea, but Verant needs to rethink the component costs<br/>\n&gt; and get them in line with reality.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Leatherwood </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
