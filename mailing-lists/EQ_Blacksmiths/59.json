For DAMN sure their posts<br/>\ncomplaining are far more inappropriate than an update notice is...<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople like this are just jealous, or have a grudge against &quot;spoiler&quot; sites,<br/>\nor were beaten at tetherball matches in grade school a lot, whatever. At any<br/>\nrate, in the final analysis, you are helping far more people than you are<br/>\nharming by p1mping your site.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the Internet,  complaints = flattery.
