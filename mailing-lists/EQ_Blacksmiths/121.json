I&#39;ve been pretty quiet on this list so far and have just<br/>\nobserved everyone else.  Not too many people have mentioned the little<br/>\ntown of Rivervale.  This town really has a lot to offer.  It is a pretty<br/>\ngood trade town if you ask me.  You can buy small molds for<br/>\nblacksmithing, it has a forge, and you can get ore off the muddites in<br/>\nbeholder.  I know the ore off of muddites is NOT something the lower<br/>\nlevel people can attain easily, but that is the only drawback i see to<br/>\nthe town.  There are very few smiths here, so I&#39;m sure a smith with<br/>\ndescent skill would make a killing selling banded to all the furry<br/>\nfooted people.  I think Rivervale has every type of trade skill<br/>\navailable in it.  Potters wheel, kiln, forge, oven, and a brew thing. <br/>\nJust a suggestion.  (Hopes to see a smith selling banded in the next few<br/>\ndays because his character would surely buy some =0)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
