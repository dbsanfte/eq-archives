Say four stacks worth, as you will fail a few times making these.  Make some scalers with the bits, then make more bits.  Once bits become trivial, make a full backpack or two of them.  This is major carpal tunnel syndrom time, but it&#39;s necessary to do.  Keep making scalers until trivial.  Move on to lanterns, they cost a little more, but you fail a lot less, and don&#39;t lose much money.  Scalers are last until your skill hits 115, then you can try pots to 125(?) then sewing kits.  Although I found that pots and sewing kits don&#39;t give you very much skill.  Once you hit 125 in skill just sell all armor.<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 7 Sep 1999 19:45:44    nicolas.miskic wrote:<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nicolas.miskic@...\">nicolas.miskic@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Greeting<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;i play a barbarian shaman lvl 15<br/>\n&gt;my int is 61 and my char 88<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;i have recently started blacksmithing and there is my 2 cent.<br/>\n&gt;first i have only put 3 point in my skill.<br/>\n&gt;I have started by sharpening weapon and surprise ! unlike its <br/>\n&gt;always say in the different guide you find about this skill : when <br/>\n&gt;you lacked the skill you don t loose both the weapon and the <br/>\n&gt;sharpening stone but only the sharpening stone.  cost of one <br/>\n&gt;sharpening stone 3 copper :) <br/>\n&gt;may be its recent patch that have change that ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also know that it will take you many time to get enought rusty <br/>\n&gt;weapon to increase your skill.
