Let s make ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1361813478\">A couple of things about price &#39;fixing&#39; and those doing or trying to do it:<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, what they are doing is just like any union does... Let&#39;s make<br/>\neveryone the same, so that everyone can make the same money... They might as<br/>\nwell be NPC&#39;s for Tunare&#39;s sake!<br/>\n<br/>\nHOWEVER, your (higher level players) type is one of the reasons they may be<br/>\ndoing it... Yes, you can easily afford to buy banded, or chain, or even<br/>\nplate mail armor... As you said, you really have no need for plat except for<br/>\nlearning things like smithing... so, no skin off your nose... You are higher<br/>\nthan level 20 and easily make more money off of better mobs...<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, you have to realize that some of these smiths are MUCH lower than<br/>\nyou... they poured their time and efforts into smithing in the beginning<br/>\ninstead of gaining experience like others did...<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some I have seen that are only level 7-10 characters that are<br/>\nmaster smiths!!  Now I myself didn&#39;t know you could do that!  But for these<br/>\nplayers the only way they can make 10-20 plat a day, like you do, is to make<br/>\na good profit on the armor they make... And, they know just like the oil<br/>\ncompanies in RL that if they stick together they can control the market...<br/>\nI have even heard that when they &#39;blackball&#39; another smith that when he<br/>\ntries to sell armor, the immediately post prices MUCH LOWER (sometimes<br/>\ntaking a loss) just so you won&#39;t be able to even sell yours!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I hope that the prices don&#39;t keep coming down and down and down<br/>\neither... because it is costing me a FORTUNE to learn smithing (I am up to<br/>\nlevel 54 now... woo hoo!) and I WILL be trying to factor that into my costs<br/>\nwhen I make a piece... I figure if it costs me 100pp to get good enough,<br/>\nthen I need to make a &#39;profit&#39; of 1-5 plat on each piece of banded in order<br/>\nto break even within the time it takes to make 30-50 different pieces of<br/>\narmor... OR, I can charge MORE and do it even faster... Hey, after all,<br/>\nEnchanters do it, so do tailors... Where does it say we should &#39;give it<br/>\naway&#39; to people... people appreciate what they work for and earn... not<br/>\nwhat&#39;s just given to them...  So yes, be cheaper in price if you feel you<br/>\nmust to sell your wares, but don&#39;t give it away at cost... because some of<br/>\nus don&#39;t have 100pp sitting in the bank...<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jason Coan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 17, 1999 3:59 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Price Fixing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand the price fixing.  Is this the Microsoft Smithing<br/>\nAlliance?  No, didn&#39;t think so.  And I&#39;m not letting some self reichous<br/>\ngroup deturmine how much or how little profit I should make per piece of<br/>\narmor.  And I&#39;ve been told by various other smiths that if I don&#39;t raise my<br/>\nprices to match theirs they are going to put me on some blacksmith black<br/>\nlist.  Which is really kinda pathetic, people are threatening to blackball<br/>\nme because I offer the same product (actually better since I make small and<br/>\nits lighter) at a lower price than they are willing to sell for.  Not to<br/>\nmention once you hit about 25th lvl, the money really isn&#39;t important, very<br/>\nfew people actually sell items these days so I havn&#39;t needed money for<br/>\nanything in a long time, other than to dump into my smithing hobby.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
