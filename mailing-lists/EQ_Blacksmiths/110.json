Is price<br/>\nof the mold a good indicator?  Is there a table of this anywhere?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Where can banded molds be purchased for each size?  I know you can<br/>\nbuy medium in Freeport, small in Kelethin and large somewhere like Grobb<br/>\nor Oggok, but there surely must be more.  Any help is appreciated,<br/>\nparticularly for large molds in a place non-evil characters can visit<br/>\nand small molds on the continent of Antonica.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
