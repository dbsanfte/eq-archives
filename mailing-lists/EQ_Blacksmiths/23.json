I have gotten my swiming up to<br/>\n34 (bad, I think), and working on one handed blunt (maxed one handed slash).<br/>\nI really want to try new things because attacking 2 skeletons with the new<br/>\none handed blunt skill is about the only fun I am having right now.

Dunno which one explains it but you should buy them anyway,<br/>\nthey just cost over 1gp.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want the answer here, you have to buy sharpening stones (not<br/>\nsold everywhere) at 3 or 4cp a piece and then put the rusty weapon<br/>\nand a sharpening stone in a forge (available somewhere in most<br/>\ncities, ask around) and then hit combine. If you&#39;re lucky you&#39;ll get<br/>\na taarnished weapon which will be a couple delay points faster! Not<br/>\nbad. You might however fail and then loose both the wepon and the<br/>\nstone (lost anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me sharpening weapons became trivial at a smithing skill of 22. I<br/>\nthink it means that my smithing skill won&#39;t increase from it, dunno<br/>\nif it means I will never be more successful. I succeed most of the<br/>\ntime anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThormael<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;D Thoma&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:milamber@...\">milamber@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Sharpening ... Stone<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;OK, basic question I know, but I have to ask anyway.  I have a<br/>\nrusted sword, how do I get it to good quality again?  I would think a<br/>\nsharpening stone.  I guess the question is how do you make a<br/>\nsharpenting stone, or do you obtain it some place and then how do you<br/>\napply it?  I found the guy I can purchase ore from and can get a<br/>\nflask of water.  I haven&#39;t even opened up blacksmithing yet (will<br/>\nthis evening).  Can any one give me a little guidence on the best way<br/>\nto open this skill up other than trial and error.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for any help<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;David<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
