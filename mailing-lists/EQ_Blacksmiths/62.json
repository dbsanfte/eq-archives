I was under the impression<br/>\nthat this mailing list was to keep people informed about EverQuest, and<br/>\nparticularly about Smithing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have decided to no longer post any messages to any boards or lists. I am<br/>\nnow doing this site solely for my friends and those people who manage to<br/>\nfind it. I am sick of people complaining about something I do for free to<br/>\nhelp them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to be kept abreast of changes, just e-mail me saying so and I<br/>\nwill send an update notice directly to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the site has a lot of potential considering that all the info comes<br/>\nfrom me, and I have no real HTML experience. (Just bought a book yesterday.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to have bothered anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharles Adams<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reedo&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:reedo@...\">reedo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I&#39;m really glad that he posted his web address.  He has some of<br/>\nthe best info on blacksmithing on the web.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Whitcraft,David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DWHITCRAFT@...\">DWHITCRAFT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Agreed! I like when smaller sites tell people they have updates. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;like it when they flood everyone, but I&#39;ve only seen 2 posts from this guy,<br/>\n&gt;and I like his site. If he gets time to work on it, it could be very very<br/>\n&gt;benificial. I&#39;ve been there a couple of times, and like the info there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve not had bad experience with people on boards, as I don&#39;t post much and<br/>\n&gt;I delete babble very quickly. *shrug* Was annoying to come into work Monday<br/>\n&gt;and have 149 new messages waiting...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Zantaer, Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Chet Watkins&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chetwatkins@...\">chetwatkins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Has everyone on this game gone postal???!!!

It does deal with EQ and that should be all that really matters. I am<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;seeing a bad trend on the message board and in game and it has a lot to do <br/>\n&gt;with things like this. PEOPLE ARE GETTING RUDE. I had better run ins with <br/>\n&gt;pkers on UO then with the people im seeing in EQ and the mailing list. <br/>\n&gt;Please, Everyone just sit back, relax, and enjoy the info we recieve.

I&#39;m not saying post anything <br/>\n&gt;and everything, but this mailing list has done very well about staying on <br/>\n&gt;subject, a couple of links to eq info sites is not going to kill anyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rant over, return to your normal blacksmithing news.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Xezol - Lvl 13 Gnome Mag on E&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit My EverQuest Page; including zone maps, trade skill guides, general<br/>\nweapons info, and more:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dubuque.net/~sirkal/EverQuest.htm\">http://www.dubuque.net/~sirkal/EverQuest.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nAttention Star Wars fans!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nONElist is the best place for your Star Wars list!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
