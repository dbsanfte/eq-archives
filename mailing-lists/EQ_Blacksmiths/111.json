This will become trivial\r<br/>\nat 41 (along with small and medium containers\r<br/>\nand maybe a few others things, I haven&#39;t checked\r<br/>\nthem all).  After that became trivial for me,\r<br/>\nI started on lanterns, my skill is now 49 and\r<br/>\nI have maybe spent 40pp total to get this far.\r<br/>\nAlso I should mention that I sharpened the rusty\r<br/>\ndaggers I got while increasing my fishing skill\r<br/>\ninstead of making metals bits until it became\r<br/>\ntrivial, which is the same skill level that metal\r<br/>\nbits and files became trivial.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe basic premise to increase your skill it to\r<br/>\nmake things a great many times.  To do this you\r<br/>\nneed to take into account the cost of making\r<br/>\nan item so you can make more things for your\r<br/>\nmoney.  What I did was take all the blacksmithing\r<br/>\nrecipes and calculated the cost to make each\r<br/>\nitem then started making the cheapest thing\r<br/>\nuntil it became trivial then move up to the\r<br/>\nnext higher priced item.  For example, to make\r<br/>\na metal bit it costs 1g 2s 5c (two bricks and\r<br/>\nwater), but only it only costs 1s 5c (the selling\r<br/>\nprice of a rusty dagger and a sharpening stone)\r<br/>\nto attempt an increase in the blacksmithing skill\r<br/>\nbefore level 21, which would you prefer? I\r<br/>\nbelieve the game is set up this way for skill\r<br/>\nprogression, based on my own experiences in\r<br/>\nfletching (83) and from talking with experts in\r<br/>\njewelry making.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUnfortunately I think a lot of people are reading\r<br/>\nEQstratics and EQvault to get their blacksmithing\r<br/>\ntrade information which just says &quot;make skewers&quot;\r<br/>\nuntil you get a really high skill level then\r<br/>\nmake banded.  All you are going to do is waste\r<br/>\nhard earned money.   Start looking at the smaller\r<br/>\nweb sites for the real information instead of\r<br/>\njust the big two with their scanty, incomplete,\r<br/>\nbeta test (and IMHO worthless) information about\r<br/>\ntrade skills.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nmike\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikejj@...\">mikejj@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
