This will be a<br/>\n&gt; long read.  You&#39;ve been warned. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will agree wholeheartedly that time is money.  If I had not spent the<br/>\ntime<br/>\n&gt; that I did smithing, I would be 10 levels higher with probably the same<br/>\nnice<br/>\n&gt; equipment I have now.  But, I like smithing, I like interacting with the<br/>\n&gt; community, and I like the nice items I am able to now buy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let&#39;s get something else out of the way as well.  Price fixing is never<br/>\n&gt; going to work.  There are 50+ master smiths per server, with a new one<br/>\n&gt; becoming a master smith every day.  Price fixing just won&#39;t happen unless<br/>\n&gt; you can get a majority of the smiths together and hope that they are all<br/>\n&gt; intelligent enough to understand that selling less at a more expensive<br/>\nprice<br/>\n&gt; is good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only feasible way of price fixing, which I practice occasionally, is<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; collude with a fellow smith in the area.  If I am selling armor in greater<br/>\n&gt; faydark and another smith starts selling, I sometimes (depending on their<br/>\n&gt; attitude) price fix with them so we don&#39;t end up screwing eachother.  In<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; end, we both make out because the consumers are forced to buy from one of<br/>\n&gt; us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To kurt: Good for you!  Too bad you can&#39;t be everywhere on every server at<br/>\n&gt; once.  So, the people that are buying from you are making out, but, that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; only one small corner of your server&#39;s market.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To Nick: I disagree, we have lots to lose.  We have a customer base and a<br/>\n&gt; reputation.  If we start jacking our prices, our reputation is going to go<br/>\n&gt; down the drain.  Believe it or not, word of mouth is a big contribution to<br/>\n&gt; sales.  If this little plan fails, it may take a while to recover that<br/>\nlost<br/>\n&gt; reputation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, I don&#39;t know why everyone is griping about not making enough money to<br/>\n&gt; recuperate their initial costs.  I recovered my inital investment in the<br/>\n&gt; first couple of days.  Perhaps the area you&#39;re selling in is not a very<br/>\n&gt; popular banded area.  I sell in greater faydark and it&#39;s excellent.  GFay<br/>\n&gt; offers many things that I love.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1.  I am in reach of two sizes of molds, small and medium, which allows me<br/>\n&gt; to sell to two groups of players increasing my customer base by 50% (Elves<br/>\n&gt; prefer small, and there are not THAT many humans, barbarians, or<br/>\n&gt; half-elves.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. I don&#39;t have to zone to use a bank, which means I don&#39;t have to carry<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; wares on me, which means unlimited access to my supplies without zoning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3. It is home to two races and adjacent to two more races.  A huge plus in<br/>\n&gt; customer base.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4. Perhaps the biggest reason of all, it is home to a HUGE level range.<br/>\n&gt; Because of Crushbone, most elves, dwarves, and gnomes migrate to the<br/>\n&gt; Crushbone area starting at level 5 and stay there throughout their early<br/>\n&gt; teens.  At level 5, they see me advertising my armor.  Over the next three<br/>\n&gt; days, they gain levels and money and continuously see me advertise my<br/>\narmor.<br/>\n&gt; When they finally gain enough money, they put two and two together and ask<br/>\n&gt; me for their banded armor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Phew, I&#39;m exhausted, gonna go sell some more banded. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Trenfen of Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy 120+ unique music channels right from your desktop!
