I forget exactly where, but I&#39;ve personally seen it, so I&#39;m sure it is there.  I didn&#39;t find a place to buy ore there, but I didn&#39;t check every shop and vendor, so I might have missed it.

I&#39;m a level 8 Ranger Wood-Elf (a LONE ranger) interested in smithing.  Are either of these zones relatively safe for me?  One more question as long as I&#39;m here, is there a forge in Kelethin?
