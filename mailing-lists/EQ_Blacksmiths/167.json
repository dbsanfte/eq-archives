Go to all the stores in your area and<br/>\ncheck the price of milk!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen do the same with gasoline!  Price fixing is everywhere!  Where I live<br/>\n(Santa Barbara), the CHEAPEST price for gasoline is $1.59 per gallon... Go<br/>\nFARTHER away from the refineries to little old Lompoc (an extra 60 miles<br/>\naway and 30 miles off the freeways) and the gas is only $1.39!!   Or, worse<br/>\nyet, head to some southern states where the gasoline is only $1.25 or so...<br/>\n<br/>\nPrice fixing is done by area and controlled by the markets themselves...<br/>\nIt&#39;s everywhere and on all sorts of products... the FTC is only interested<br/>\nwhen they can get their names in the paper...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
