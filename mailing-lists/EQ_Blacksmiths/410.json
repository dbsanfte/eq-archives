Enchanters are a very powerful class.<br/>\nWhile you do share the buffs with Shamans, your debuffs spells are the best<br/>\nin the game.  Not to mention your illusion spells allow you to walk into any<br/>\ncity and not be KOS.  Enchanters are powerful, especially in a group where<br/>\ntheir abilities will shine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still say that not all magical item creation should be dependent on the<br/>\nenchanter though.  Yes, enchanters should be used to create most magical<br/>\nitems, especially the more powerful ones.  If a tailor just wanted to create<br/>\npoison resistance armor, why couldn&#39;t he or she just fashion it out of<br/>\nsnakeskin and use the inherent properties from that?  A Fletcher could use<br/>\nspecial feathers of a creature on a arrow to increase it&#39;s distance, or a<br/>\nsmith could use a lightstone in a tunic to give it light radius.  Simple<br/>\nmagical items such as these should not require an enchanter.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarudil the Wandering Shaman of Ro<br/>\n17th Level &lt;The Shadows&gt;<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: James Pritchard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:posiedon_92@...\">posiedon_92@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 13, 1999 10:07 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Creating Magical Armor and Weapons<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: James Pritchard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:posiedon_92@...\">posiedon_92@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; An<br/>\n&gt; abiltity like this would make others see us as useful.  I have 2<br/>\n&gt; characters a DE Warrior and a DE Enchanter.  As the warrior I have no<br/>\n&gt; problem with groping (get asked all the time).  When Im an enchanter I<br/>\n&gt; rarely get asked and when I do its by people who do not know what class<br/>\n&gt; I am, and then the offer is recinded when they figure out that I am an<br/>\n&gt; Enchanter.  I have had people people ask what class I was and then just<br/>\n&gt; stop talking to me when they found out what class I actully was<br/>\n&gt; (originally thaught I was a Cleric </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
