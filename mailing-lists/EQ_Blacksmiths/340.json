Seems sort of like the<br/>\nreal world doesn&#39;t it?  I don&#39;t know about you, but where I come from there<br/>\nare always people willing to make a bit less of a profit, and just do more<br/>\nsales.  Puts me a bit in mind of Kmart, Wallmart, Circit City, etc. etc.<br/>\netc.  And not only these giants have been able to make a living by selling<br/>\nlow, there are plenty of mom and pop stores that do the same, usualy with<br/>\nthese smaller shops you get a bit less for your money, usualy in less of a<br/>\ncustomer service ability, little or no warranty, etc.  Luckily in EQ<br/>\ncustomer serveice isn&#39;t a problem... at least INSIDE the game, since things<br/>\ndon&#39;t break down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) you flood the market, so everyone has banded, so<br/>\n&gt; very soon, the server has all the banded it needs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is the one I laugh about, because you&#39;re too<br/>\n&gt; shortsighted to understand it.  When everyone has<br/>\n&gt; banded, you log on and auction you&#39;re selling it, and<br/>\n&gt; everyone shrugs because they already have what they<br/>\n&gt; want.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh I just love this, especially after I spent the last three days trying to<br/>\nfind Large Banded for my new character, and ended up paying every cent I had<br/>\non two pieces of Bronze because NO ONE, answered my auctions about looking<br/>\nto buy banded.  You know why it&#39;s such a pain to get banded nowadays?<br/>\nBecause of the people you are speaking of, the ones that make banded<br/>\nunprofitable for many smiths.  Looks to me like they are doing a great job<br/>\nof cornering the market.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n~Chaos, panic, & disorder-my work here is done.~</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
