That certainly wasn&#39;t how it<br/>\nwas meant.  If it did, that would be from a stressful day at work.  It takes<br/>\ngetting home, cleaning, studying, taking care of my son, and jumping onto EQ<br/>\nbefore I slip into my happy go lucky dwarven self,  when I start being<br/>\nnothing but friendly.  But at the same time, I hope my point is well<br/>\nreceived.  There is really no need to duplicate efforts made on several<br/>\nexcellent web sites, which I&#39;m willing to bet 95% or so of the people on<br/>\nthis list that are interested enough to care have access to.  Simply give<br/>\nthem a pointer, or in cases such as this, why shouldn&#39;t it be sufficent to<br/>\nhave the person simply log into EQ to get the information.   I get right<br/>\naround 70 or so emails a day from my various lists (1 /extremely/ high<br/>\ntraffic one (Star Wars RPG), and 1 that I&#39;ve now gone into digest mode on<br/>\nnot included) that I need to go through...and that&#39;s not counting my Real<br/>\nLife email.  So it&#39;s quite a task.  While I agree, it takes but a second to<br/>\ngo glance at an email and hit delete, multiply this X70, then multiply that<br/>\nX5 for the week, not to mention the mail that builds up over the weekend<br/>\nwhen I don&#39;t check it, and...well... it&#39;s a hell a chore..<br/>\n<br/>\nDameat<br/>\n10th Level Dwarven Cleric<br/>\nRodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
