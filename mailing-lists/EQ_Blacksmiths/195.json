Everyone in Freeport was ooc ing for banded.  In Quenos, I was the<br/>\n&gt; only one at the time trying to get it.  I did not know that Shamans and<br/>\n&gt; Necromancers had a spell that moved items.  I have never heard of anyone<br/>\n&gt; bartering for this.  A Shaman could make a lot of money by moving ore to<br/>\n&gt; people in Quenos.  I still cannot believe that ore can not be found in<br/>\n&gt; Quenos and yet they have Ironforge Estate.  What is he using to make his<br/>\n&gt; weapons ?    I understand that the closest place to get ore is from a NPC<br/>\n&gt; in front of a mine entrance near Highpass.  Can anyone verify this ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank You,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tanaman<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
