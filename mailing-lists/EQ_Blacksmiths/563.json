Most importantly, the new prices are ranged to allow flexibility in pricing. Very important to have depending on where you are smithing!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, for those interested: the banded molds in Queynos Hills are where they should be again. Apparently Verant had moved them as part of their little Halloween undead-fest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAraman, 19th level Paladin<br/>\nWarwinds of Norrath, E&#39;ci<br/>\nSkill 143 Blacksmith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
