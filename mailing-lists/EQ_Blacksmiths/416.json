And you don&#39;t have to make the item totally disappear. A better way to<br/>\ndo is to have the AC value of the item drop until it hits, let&#39;s say 1, then<br/>\nit&#39;s time to go get it repaired.

(none I&#39;d bet)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve spent about 2 months to get the armor that I am now wearing, I&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt; pissed to an extreem if I were in the middle of a fight and I see a<br/>\n&gt; message &quot;Your Charred Black Tunic has fallen appart&quot;.  That one piece of<br/>\n&gt; armor alone took me the better part of week to get.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ok, so you say I should have to get it repaired by a smith.  I am DE, and<br/>\n&gt; by choice I have lowered my faction to the point where I will never be<br/>\n&gt; able to go into Freeport or Rivervale, and due to built in factions, I can<br/>\n&gt; not go to any other elf city nor can I go into gnome, dwarf, or barbarian<br/>\n&gt; city.  Which means that I would have to search, not only for a respectable<br/>\n&gt; smith that I trusted, but also an evil one, or trek my self across the<br/>\n&gt; world to Qeynos.  Simply to get my armor &quot;repaired&quot;.  Now if that isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; bad enough.....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Often my group will go deep into a dungeon, deep to the point where either<br/>\n&gt; a caster has to group gate us to get us out, or we have to spend 30-45 min<br/>\n&gt; fighting out way out of the dungeon.  And quite often we&#39;ll all camp and<br/>\n&gt; logout in a &quot;safe&quot; spot in the dungeon, so sometimes we will be in a<br/>\n&gt; dungeon litterly for days.  Now, say I get the message &quot;your rubicite helm<br/>\n&gt; is begining to weaken, you should take it for repairs soon&quot;, that means<br/>\n&gt; that my entire group would have to leave the dungeon so that I might quest<br/>\n&gt; to get my armor repaired.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I find neither to be acceptable.  What I do find about this, is that there<br/>\n&gt; are some smiths who think they don&#39;t make enough money, so they want armor<br/>\n&gt; to wear out, so it has to either be replaced or repaired (more money for<br/>\n&gt; smiths).  What they fail to concider is the fact that you will not always<br/>\n&gt; be wearing banded armor.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Peter Wong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lkworthpete@...\">lkworthpete@...</a>&gt; 7.14.99 9:19:45 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Peter Wong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lkworthpete@...\">lkworthpete@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a> <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It would make people too mad. Having a nice piece of magic armor that took<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; forever to get disappear because it wore out. I don&#39;t like this idea, as<br/>\n&gt; it <br/>\n&gt; would just make EQ more like Diablo and Ultima Online, which I hope they <br/>\n&gt; would want to try and stay away from.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some other RPG&#39;s I&#39;ve played made it so that common wear items wore<br/>\n&gt; quicker<br/>\n&gt; than others as well as making rare quest items not wear very little or not<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; all since they are supposed to be considered priceless.  I think the idea<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; making items wear would be a great thing for the trade.  A shield and<br/>\n&gt; sword<br/>\n&gt; would wear quicker than say boots or leggings.  This gives smiths an<br/>\n&gt; oppurtunity to increase their skills with less cost if they want to work<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; repairing and improving items.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cerran<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.  <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.
