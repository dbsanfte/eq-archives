(see your comments below)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; b.  at the grocery store I&#39;m not being charged outrageous fees because<br/>\n </span></blockquote>farmer A can&#39;t produce as apples as efficiently as farmer B<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, actually you are... and they too use &#39;price fixing&#39; at the wholesale<br/>\nlevel by selling to brokers who then mark it up and sell to distributors who<br/>\nthen mark it up and sell to you.  But if famer A doesn&#39;t grow as many apples<br/>\nhe is &#39;subsidized&#39; on his pricing to match... Have you not noticed there are<br/>\n&#39;seasons&#39; for fruit?  even though you can get fruit in ALL seasons?  It is<br/>\ncalled SUPPLY AND DEMAND.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; c.  If I feel grocery store A is charging too much I go to grocery store B<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and buy the same merchandise at a lower price, so its up to grocer A to<br/>\nlower their prices to meet consumer need/want, not up to grocer B to raise<br/>\ntheir price to match the market &quot;standards&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen do you go around and call the first store SCUM?  Or do you let them do<br/>\nbusiness because some people don&#39;t just shop on price, but on service and<br/>\nother reasons?  Sounds like you are interested in LOW PRICES...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;So yes, you do have to consider costs of failures too... If a &#39;client&#39;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>came<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;up to you with all the raw materials and said &quot;Make me a tunic and I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>will<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;give you 5pp.&quot; Would you tell them Okay without mentioning that it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*might<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;not* work and they would be out the 5pp for the raw materials?  Or, if<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;failed with their materials would you then use your own until you were<br/>\n </span></blockquote>able<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;to produce one for them?  This would be a bad thing for you if it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>did... But<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;if that is your thinking, then the heck with ME learning to smith, I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;going to start ordering stuff from you all the time!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t work like that, if someone came up to me and said they had the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>materials, I would offer to buy the materials, then charge them my normal<br/>\nprice.  But that has never happened to me...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;In fact, please put me down for two tunics (I will sell one for 20pp<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;mine will only cost 10), or better yet, make it FOUR!

(let&#39;s see now, if I get them for 13pp<br/>\n </span></blockquote>each<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;x4=52 plat... I can sell 3 x20=60...

I sell tunics for 15, you should read more carefully<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I did read carefully... do the math... two tunics (at your price) would be<br/>\n30p... I would sell one for 20, then mine would only cost me 10 ---<br/>\n20+10=30p  But you wouldn&#39;t offer any discounts?  Oh, so YOUR prices ARE<br/>\nfixed then?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; b.  people like you make me sick.....you&#39;d take advantage of someone<br/>\n </span></blockquote>trying to do the community a favor (me) by buying my stuff cheap and selling<br/>\nat much higher prices for your own personal gain.  &quot;Screw thy fellow man&quot;<br/>\nmust be your motto of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nhey, hey, hey... If you feel ill, perhaps it is because you don&#39;t like to<br/>\nhear about others making money off of &#39;Your&#39; stuff... Well, that&#39;s the way<br/>\nit is done all over... Buy cheap, sell for a profit... Heck, YOU are doing<br/>\nit too!  You make money off of the &#39;skill&#39; of smithing... Is it wrong for<br/>\nsomeone else to make money off of the &#39;skill&#39; of selling?  If I can sell<br/>\nyour products for you, to others you don&#39;t know, or can&#39;t reach, then am I<br/>\nnot helping you also?  or do you want Exclusive rights to everything you<br/>\nsell?  Or do you just want to FIX the price of something that YOU make.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; c.  You would get no such discount from me, infact I&#39;d probably charge you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>40pp per tunic due to your own greed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and your not greedy at all... No discounts, Fixed price of 15p but it<br/>\ncosts you only 5p, so that is 150% profit... No, that is a FAIR markup,<br/>\nisn&#39;t it?  Sure, you don&#39;t mind paying 150% markup on your things, do you?<br/>\nBut if someone else tries to mark it up 33% above THEIR cost (20p selling vs<br/>\n15p they would pay you) then THEY are the greedy ones, eh?  Tsk, tsk...  And<br/>\nyou STILL would make 150% profit...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Of course if I order more, you should give me an even BIGGER discount<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;because, after all, I am HELPING you to learn to be a better smith,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>right?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Lemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I generally don&#39;t give discounts on bulk purchases because either someone<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is trying to take advantage of my low prices, or they are trying to twink<br/>\nout their guild buddies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that would hurt you how?  Because you don&#39;t want to sell to his buddies?<br/>\nor because you think that YOU are the only one that should sell to them?<br/>\nConvienent for you, but not necessarily for them... If you are only on 4<br/>\nhours a night, and someone else is on 4 hours in the DAY, they cannot buy<br/>\nyour products, and you cannot sell to them... But heaven forbid someone else<br/>\nwould want to use their time and effort to provide YOUR products for sale to<br/>\nothers...<br/>\n<br/>\nThink small, be small...<br/>\n<br/>\nI only hope that when I can finally make armor and sell it, that I can sell<br/>\nAS MUCH AS I CAN MAKE for a GOOD price to make ME a profit... Smithing is a<br/>\nbusiness as well as a service... I already give away my healings and buffs<br/>\nwithout charging my fellow players... Why shouldn&#39;t I try to make a profit<br/>\nfor myself smithing or reselling?<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
