REMEMBER<br/>\nthat EQ&#39;s ECONOMY IS BROKEN. Therefore the standard rules of economy DO NOT<br/>\nAPPLY.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat we are trying to do is make smithing profitable so that people are<br/>\nwilling to do it. When the game first started, EVERYONE did smithing. When<br/>\npeople started selling at 1gp above cost, 90% of those people quit. Now you<br/>\ncannot find very many smiths at all (in fact, in the last week of play I<br/>\nhave found 2 stretching from Qeynos, to Freeport, to Kelethin - on E&#39;ci).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIf we can settle on a base price (which the economy SHOULD be doing for<br/>\nus, but is NOT doing), then we can make it profitable enough to do some<br/>\nsmithing. If not...well then you will still have the majority of people not<br/>\nsmithing, and a few who DO smith and corner the market.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYou choose.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCralis Trueblade<br/>\nBrother of the E&#39;ci Trueblades<br/>\nOriginal Brothers of the Guardian Archon<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cralis@...\">cralis@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webmaster@...\">webmaster@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It is our creed that no evil shall stand, whether it be man or gnoll, in<br/>\nthe forest or the city, among friends or be an enemy.
