You understand how it works, and you give very valid scenario&#39;s<br/>\nwhere it is applicable.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, for the other person who said that a persons plan to have a steady<br/>\nprice for banded wouldn&#39;t &quot;work for shit&quot;, my good sir you are QUITE wrong.<br/>\nIf all the blacksmiths (probably never ever happen, but still) got together,<br/>\nand deemed a flat rate at which to sell their products, above what they<br/>\ncurrently are, and refuse to lower their prices save perhaps 1pp here or<br/>\nthere, people will be forced to do 1 of 3 things.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.) Wait until someone, who already has banded, buys something better and<br/>\nsells their banded for cheap, or...<br/>\n2.) Plop 150pp + and many hours of game time into learning smithing, or....<br/>\n3.) Buy for the prices us, the smith&#39;s, charge.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the people of Everquest, us, all of us that play, that determine&#39;s the<br/>\nflow of the market.  I tell you that I for one am sick of loosing so much<br/>\nmoney on blacksmithing because people always tell me that &quot;so and so sells<br/>\nfor cheaper&quot;.  Good for them.  I&#39;m not &quot;so and so&quot;.  I&#39;ve spent over 150pp<br/>\nworking on the skill, and have made MAYBE 40pp of that back.  And that&#39;s<br/>\nwith an extra 100pp or so in materials.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow sure, you can sell cheaper than anyone else.  But you gotta remember<br/>\nthis.  How much banded will you be able to sell in an hour?  And, with your<br/>\ncheap prices, how much will you make?  Not much, I&#39;m betting.  Although<br/>\nthose of us who decide to stick with a price might not sell quite as often<br/>\nas you, we will make more money, with less time spent, than you ever will.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, my 2 cent&#39;s (again).<br/>\n<br/>\nDennis Meek<br/>\naka Haijar the Mage Blacksmith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
