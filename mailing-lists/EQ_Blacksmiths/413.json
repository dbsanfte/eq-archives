I though<br/>\nthat was good since I was taking his time away from adventuring.  My friend<br/>\npaid close to the same prices for his armor.  I think 20 plat is too high,<br/>\nbut anything around the 10-15 plat is good.  Most people who need the armor<br/>\nhave the money to buy it at that price, and if not then they can piece a<br/>\nsuit together like I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarudil the Wandering Shaman of Ro<br/>\n17th Level &lt;The Shadows&gt;<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jason Coan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 14, 1999 9:50 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Banded Prices<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ore...free<br/>\n&gt; mold...few gold<br/>\n&gt; water...few silver<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; cost of materials is only a couple of plat, so for someone to sell a few<br/>\ngold above cost, the tunic would have to be no more than about 5<br/>\nplat....i&#39;ve never seen anybody selling that cheap.  10plat a tunic is still<br/>\na big profit, 20plat a tunic is a huge profit, anything above 20plat is a<br/>\nrip off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As for the fixed prices, I&#39;m all for it.
