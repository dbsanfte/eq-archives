These are what I\r<br/>\nshould have been doing instead of lanterns\r<br/>\nafter making scalers.  I noticed this at skill\r<br/>\nlevel 62 and so I tried a test batch of 10\r<br/>\nskewers and failed in all 10 attempts!! (this is\r<br/>\nthe wasted 2pp).  I think the price is wrong on\r<br/>\nthe skewer mold, I should have been able to make\r<br/>\nat least one lousy skewer at that skill level if\r<br/>\nit *was* the next thing to do.  I only say this\r<br/>\nbecause my success rate at making lanterns was\r<br/>\naround 50% at that same skill level.  So I\r<br/>\nabandoned the skewers and went back to lanterns.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis brings me to some other things you can do\r<br/>\nto reduce the cost at raising a skill.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf you are getting high up in level (I&#39;m a 15th\r<br/>\nlevel warrior) those faction adjustments are\r<br/>\nstarting to add up.  Different merchants will\r<br/>\nstart /con&#39;ing at different levels, in the\r<br/>\nFreeport area alone I can find merchants who\r<br/>\nregard me apprensively all the way to warmly.\r<br/>\nThe better the merchant likes you the more he\r<br/>\nor she will pay for your goods.  I used a greater\r<br/>\nlightstone as a measuring stick and found that\r<br/>\na merchant who regards me only indifferently\r<br/>\nwill usually pay around 3p 5g but a warmly\r<br/>\nmerchant will pay 3p 9g.  Can you guess which\r<br/>\nmerchant will get to buy my freshly made batch\r<br/>\nof lanterns?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe other tip is not to make a whole stack of\r<br/>\nmetal bits at once.  What I did at the earlier\r<br/>\nskill levels is buy the ore, water and molds\r<br/>\nthen attempt to make a metal bit.  When I\r<br/>\nwas successful then I would attempt to make\r<br/>\nthe scaler.  Your success rate at making\r<br/>\nmetal bits will increase when your smithing\r<br/>\nskill increases.  But you can&#39;t increase\r<br/>\nyour smithing skill by making metal bits because\r<br/>\nthey are trivial.  So if I make one metal bit\r<br/>\nthen attempt the scaler and happen to increase\r<br/>\nmy smithing skill the next metal bit I attempt\r<br/>\nhas a slightly higher chance of succeeding.  At\r<br/>\naround a 55 skill I was getting a 90-95% success\r<br/>\nrate at making metal bits.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo why I am increasing my blacksmithing skill?\r<br/>\nI put a challenge to my warrior to make all his\r<br/>\nown supplies and this includes banded armor.\r<br/>\nI&#39;m sure I will try to sell some banded after\r<br/>\nmy skill is high enough, but I&#39;m not in it for\r<br/>\nthe money alone.  Also some baking recipes and\r<br/>\ntailoring recipes call for metal parts and I would\r<br/>\nlike to become better at those skills (my baking\r<br/>\nis at 82 and tailor is 26 - patchwork trivial\r<br/>\nlevel).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI have two questions that maybe some other smiths\r<br/>\nout there can answer.  First, where can I get\r<br/>\na lockpick mold?  I searched all over and couldn&#39;t\r<br/>\nfind it anywhere.  And what is the correct recipe\r<br/>\nfor making a toolbox?  The ingredients in the\r<br/>\nbook are giving an invalid combination message\r<br/>\nso I figured maybe they just left out the mold\r<br/>\nrequirement but I couldn&#39;t find it (even in\r<br/>\nak&#39;anon).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nmike</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
