Personally,<br/>\nI don&#39;t keep that much in my bank account. Copies of extra keys to Befallen,<br/>\na couple of semi-rare items in process of selling or waiting for a guildmate<br/>\nto come get (like a derv ring, a couple of spiked collars, and a mino axe),<br/>\nand coinage. That&#39;s basically about it. I don&#39;t keep extra weapons or armor<br/>\nor food and drink for when I buy the farm. That&#39;s what friends are for -<br/>\nhelp me do a corpse retrieve (assuming I need help). And, if I need a weapon<br/>\nafter I die, I&#39;ll kill a couple skeletons in the newbie areas and get some<br/>\nweapons before I head back out, which I usually don&#39;t even worry about.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Zantaer, SOK<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skalpyl@...\">skalpyl@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skalpyl@...\">skalpyl@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 02, 1999 3:26 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Banks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skalpyl@...\">skalpyl@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn a role-playing sense, I think banks are already borderline, much less<br/>\njoint accounts.
