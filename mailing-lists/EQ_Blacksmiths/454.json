I sell tunics for 20pp<br/>\nfrom time to time (mostly because I am too busy to sell, not for lack of<br/>\ncustomers)  and I still have not recouped my initial investment.  My<br/>\nsmithing is only at 115, but at 20pp each for legs and tunic, if I sell the<br/>\nset (for 40pp),  is a break even price.  Legs are almost impossible to make.<br/>\nThey fail about 80% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 13<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 14 Jul 1999 13:11:21 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Banded Prices<br/>\n<br/>\nconcidering you have about a 15pp profit if selling at 20pp, 15pp profit is<br/>\na bit steep.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Chris Lin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrislin@...\">chrislin@...</a>&gt; 7.14.99 12:35:09 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Chris Lin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrislin@...\">chrislin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnything above 20 plat is a ripoff?
