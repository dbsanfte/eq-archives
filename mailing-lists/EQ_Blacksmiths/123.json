I made a separate character to purchase water and<br/>\nmolds in East Freeport.  I&#39;d just like to say that a dark elf with 134<br/>\nintelligence makes a very good and cost effective smith.  I&#39;ve spent maybe<br/>\nat the MOST 80 pp in getting to 100 skill.  I spent 15 practice points right<br/>\noff and then sharpened until trivial.  Then scalers until 41 trivial and now<br/>\nI&#39;m still making skewers even at 100 skill.  I&#39;m wondering how far skewers<br/>\nwill advance you?  And also what skill level would give you about 50%<br/>\nsuccess rate making tunic, legs, helm<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note on the E&#39;ci server there&#39;s a group of merchants selling<br/>\nbanded tunics for as low as 15 pp ... this destroys mine and every other<br/>\nsmith of the server&#39;s hard work.  They&#39;re selling sleeves for 8 pp for gods<br/>\nsake!  People level 10 were not meant to afford a full suit of banded mail<br/>\nand these smiths run a fairly large operation I&#39;m told by fellow smiths that<br/>\nthey number into the 30&#39;s and are a blacksmithing guild.  What is there that<br/>\ncan be done?  Anything?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
