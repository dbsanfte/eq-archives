While I&#39;ve been reading on the subject, I seem to<br/>\nrecall that you can make other things with blacksmithing skill, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nremember what they are. Can someone write a quick list of things other than<br/>\nbanded that you can make with blacksmithing?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Zantaer, Fennin  Ro Barbarian Warrior of the 14th Circle<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikejj@...\">mikejj@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikejj@...\">mikejj@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 11, 1999 11:51 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Increasing your skill<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikejj@...\">mikejj@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHi, I subscribe to the digest so I can&#39;t really<br/>\nrespond accordingly but I just wanted to mention<br/>\nto those aspiring master blacksmiths (myself<br/>\nincluded) that making skewers at an early skill<br/>\nlevel is a really, really, really bad idea.<br/>\nAfter bits become trivial the next thing you<br/>\nshould make it scalers.  This will become trivial<br/>\nat 41 (along with small and medium containers<br/>\nand maybe a few others things, I haven&#39;t checked<br/>\nthem all).  After that became trivial for me,<br/>\nI started on lanterns, my skill is now 49 and<br/>\nI have maybe spent 40pp total to get this far.<br/>\nAlso I should mention that I sharpened the rusty<br/>\ndaggers I got while increasing my fishing skill<br/>\ninstead of making metals bits until it became<br/>\ntrivial, which is the same skill level that metal<br/>\nbits and files became trivial.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic premise to increase your skill it to<br/>\nmake things a great many times.  To do this you<br/>\nneed to take into account the cost of making<br/>\nan item so you can make more things for your<br/>\nmoney.  What I did was take all the blacksmithing<br/>\nrecipes and calculated the cost to make each<br/>\nitem then started making the cheapest thing<br/>\nuntil it became trivial then move up to the<br/>\nnext higher priced item.  For example, to make<br/>\na metal bit it costs 1g 2s 5c (two bricks and<br/>\nwater), but only it only costs 1s 5c (the selling<br/>\nprice of a rusty dagger and a sharpening stone)<br/>\nto attempt an increase in the blacksmithing skill<br/>\nbefore level 21, which would you prefer? I<br/>\nbelieve the game is set up this way for skill<br/>\nprogression, based on my own experiences in<br/>\nfletching (83) and from talking with experts in<br/>\njewelry making.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately I think a lot of people are reading<br/>\nEQstratics and EQvault to get their blacksmithing<br/>\ntrade information which just says &quot;make skewers&quot;<br/>\nuntil you get a really high skill level then<br/>\nmake banded.  All you are going to do is waste<br/>\nhard earned money.   Start looking at the smaller<br/>\nweb sites for the real information instead of<br/>\njust the big two with their scanty, incomplete,<br/>\nbeta test (and IMHO worthless) information about<br/>\ntrade skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nmike<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikejj@...\">mikejj@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nMake your voice heard!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nSign up for the ONElist Weekly Survey.
