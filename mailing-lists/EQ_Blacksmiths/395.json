They stated that one reason they are different is because in RL<br/>\nthings wear out and in EQ they are eternal.  This is so true.  Has anyone<br/>\nthought of or actually talked to Verant about having armor wear out?  This<br/>\nwould cause buyers to go to smiths for repairs or replacements.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow if this seems like a good idea or not.  I think it does.  Let me know<br/>\nwhat you all think of this idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCampaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nDiscuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
