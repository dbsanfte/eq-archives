You think that people don&#39;t pay for your failures? You think<br/>\nthat you don&#39;t pay for failures in real life? It&#39;s called R & D, and you<br/>\ndo pay for it, because they stuff you buy is a result of it, Hell, a CD<br/>\ncosts about hmm lets be nice and say $5 to make, that&#39;s material costs,<br/>\nyou pay a whole heck of a lot more than that (or else your an evil<br/>\nlittle pirating troll) because your paying for the time it took to code<br/>\nthe software, which the programs expect to get paid for. Why? because<br/>\nthey learned, through schooling what works and what don&#39;t, or they<br/>\nlearned through trial and error on their own. Ok went to school, so no<br/>\nyou pay to learn from *other* peoples failures, not your own.<br/>\n Sigh, what next people bitching because if my faction sucks in an area<br/>\nthat I charge more, but they pay much less for items?<br/>\n/nos, He who wants to tattoo Moron on many people&#39;s foreheads so he<br/>\nknows who *not* to deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nkurt walther wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: kurt walther &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:itzkurt@...\">itzkurt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nick Emmerich wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Nick Emmerich &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seorin@...\">seorin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; One thing everybody must learn, prices can ALWAYS go down and NEVER go up. Don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; take never literally, though. We need to raise prices on banded. 7 for gorgets,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 8 for bracers, 11 for masks, 13 for helmets, 12 for sleeves, 12 for mantle, 20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for mail, 20 for cloak, 12 for belt, 19 for leggings, 11 for boots. These prices<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give us significant profit on 100% success and help even out the profits for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when we fail. If ALL of us sell at these prices and stick to them (don&#39;t let<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them drop you more than a plat), then the &#39;low priced&#39; banded sellers will be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very scarce indeed. Then you can see the &#39;wait an hour&#39; frustration on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; buyers end. If someone auctions they are willing to pay 5 plat for a banded<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bracer for over an hour, they&#39;ll be frustrated enough to give up and pay the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damn 8 plat. If we have a set price that majority follows, then we will still<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sell. While the discount smith might sell 10 gorgets at 2 and a half plat profit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; each, we&#39;ll sell at LEAST 5 gorgets in the same amount of time for 5 and a half<br/>\n&gt; &gt; plat profit each. They might be making 25 plat, but we&#39;re making 27.5 and have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; less chances for a failure :) If we group together and work as one group of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dedicated smiths, we can only win. If we become bitter enemies over who has the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lowest price, the price war will just destroy us all. We will ruin the value of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; smithing. NO MORE DISCOUNTS!!! :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Trade Council GM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sorry.. are you a moron?  Your plan won&#39;t work for shit.  You keep<br/>\n&gt; your prices at what they are..  i will sell cheaper.. everyone will keep<br/>\n&gt; coming to me.. i&#39;ll get plenty of practice and my smithing will continue<br/>\n&gt; to raise.. and I&#39;ll make all the money while you sit all alone with your<br/>\n&gt; overpriced shit.  People do NOT pay for failures.  They pay for the<br/>\n&gt; product.  As a smith, you are supposed to supply people with a product.<br/>\n&gt; You don&#39;t supply them with your failures.  Smithing is a profitable<br/>\n&gt; business.. yes.  But it&#39;s the greedy assholes like you who try to make<br/>\n&gt; other people pay for your lack of skill who ruin the trade.  Pay for<br/>\n&gt; your own mistakes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
