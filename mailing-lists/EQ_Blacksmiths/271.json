Before the \r<br/>\nrecent change to the skills I would buy a batch \r<br/>\nof raw materials from the fletching supplier and \r<br/>\ntediously make arrows, frequently getting a \r<br/>\nmessage that my skill had gone up.  I sold the \r<br/>\ncompleted arrows back to a merchant in my guild \r<br/>\nto minimize the cost of gaining skill.  (The \r<br/>\nmarket for arrows isn&#39;t so hot.)  In my most \r<br/>\nrecent training exercise I went from a skill of \r<br/>\n69 to a skill of 74.  The outlay, after buying \r<br/>\nraw materials and selling the completed arrows, \r<br/>\nwas about 2.5 pp, or about 5g/skill point.  All \r<br/>\nthis was before the patch.  Note that this cost \r<br/>\nis very different than using the skill points \r<br/>\nyou get when you gain levels, I&#39;m not talking \r<br/>\nabout that.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFletchers complained bitterly about having to \r<br/>\nmake single arrows.  Verant responded with a \r<br/>\nsolution that sells components in batches of \r<br/>\nfive and produces arrows in batches of five.  \r<br/>\nThe problem is, the skill level is based on the \r<br/>\nnumber of times the fletcher hits the &quot;combine&quot; \r<br/>\nkey.  The tediousness of making arrows has been \r<br/>\nfixed, but the price of gaining skill points has \r<br/>\nbeen multiplied by a factor of five.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy question to you smiths is, do you know how \r<br/>\nmuch it costs to increase your skill?  In the \r<br/>\nrange from 60 to 80 is it 5g/point, or \r<br/>\n2.5pp/point?  Or is it far different than that?  \r<br/>\nI appreciate your patience in reading through \r<br/>\nthis.  Thank you.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRamalama - 12.95 Level Wood-Elf Ranger on Mithanial Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
