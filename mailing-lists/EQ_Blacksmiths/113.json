While I&#39;ve been reading on the subject, I seem<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; recall that you can make other things with blacksmithing skill, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; remember what they are. Can someone write a quick list of things other<br/>\nthan<br/>\n&gt; banded that you can make with blacksmithing?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Zantaer, Fennin  Ro Barbarian Warrior of the 14th Circle<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikejj@...\">mikejj@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikejj@...\">mikejj@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 11, 1999 11:51 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Increasing your skill<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikejj@...\">mikejj@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi, I subscribe to the digest so I can&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt; respond accordingly but I just wanted to mention<br/>\n&gt; to those aspiring master blacksmiths (myself<br/>\n&gt; included) that making skewers at an early skill<br/>\n&gt; level is a really, really, really bad idea.<br/>\n&gt; After bits become trivial the next thing you<br/>\n&gt; should make it scalers.  This will become trivial<br/>\n&gt; at 41 (along with small and medium containers<br/>\n&gt; and maybe a few others things, I haven&#39;t checked<br/>\n&gt; them all).  After that became trivial for me,<br/>\n&gt; I started on lanterns, my skill is now 49 and<br/>\n&gt; I have maybe spent 40pp total to get this far.<br/>\n&gt; Also I should mention that I sharpened the rusty<br/>\n&gt; daggers I got while increasing my fishing skill<br/>\n&gt; instead of making metals bits until it became<br/>\n&gt; trivial, which is the same skill level that metal<br/>\n&gt; bits and files became trivial.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The basic premise to increase your skill it to<br/>\n&gt; make things a great many times.  To do this you<br/>\n&gt; need to take into account the cost of making<br/>\n&gt; an item so you can make more things for your<br/>\n&gt; money.  What I did was take all the blacksmithing<br/>\n&gt; recipes and calculated the cost to make each<br/>\n&gt; item then started making the cheapest thing<br/>\n&gt; until it became trivial then move up to the<br/>\n&gt; next higher priced item.  For example, to make<br/>\n&gt; a metal bit it costs 1g 2s 5c (two bricks and<br/>\n&gt; water), but only it only costs 1s 5c (the selling<br/>\n&gt; price of a rusty dagger and a sharpening stone)<br/>\n&gt; to attempt an increase in the blacksmithing skill<br/>\n&gt; before level 21, which would you prefer? I<br/>\n&gt; believe the game is set up this way for skill<br/>\n&gt; progression, based on my own experiences in<br/>\n&gt; fletching (83) and from talking with experts in<br/>\n&gt; jewelry making.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately I think a lot of people are reading<br/>\n&gt; EQstratics and EQvault to get their blacksmithing<br/>\n&gt; trade information which just says &quot;make skewers&quot;<br/>\n&gt; until you get a really high skill level then<br/>\n&gt; make banded.  All you are going to do is waste<br/>\n&gt; hard earned money.   Start looking at the smaller<br/>\n&gt; web sites for the real information instead of<br/>\n&gt; just the big two with their scanty, incomplete,<br/>\n&gt; beta test (and IMHO worthless) information about<br/>\n&gt; trade skills.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; mike<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikejj@...\">mikejj@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Make your voice heard!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sign up for the ONElist Weekly Survey.
