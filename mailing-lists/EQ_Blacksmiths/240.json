The only thing you<br/>\nneed money for is buy spells and some raw materials.  Most things that can<br/>\nbe made with trade skills (particularly blacksmithing) can be found in the<br/>\ngame world on monsters and are way better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have done smithing, and I would much rather spend my time out in the world<br/>\nof norrath fighting evil and gaining off of that, then sitting at the local<br/>\nforge trying to make an extremely boring fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 08, 1999 5:32 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Plate/Weapons<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI hear that these things are going into the game soon. Will they? If so, any<br/>\n<br/>\ntime on when? A guess... or something. All comments are welcomed. Just want <br/>\nto find out. Can&#39;t wait until this is in, be a very rich person! Plate<br/>\ntunics <br/>\nat 400 - 500pp instead of the thousands... very nice. Very rich, very<br/>\nfamous. <br/>\n:-)  Powergamers dream, and that I am. Please don&#39;t flame me on that, just <br/>\nstick to the topic. =) Thanks much.<br/>\n<br/>\nDanthin, Human Magician, Master Smith (121)<br/>\n~Veeshan~<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
