Lanterns are<br/>\nexpensive but raise your level faster.  With Skewers, you wont gain very<br/>\nfast and fail a lot, but they are cheaper to make.  You should probably test<br/>\nit both way to see which you prefer.  It is going to be different for<br/>\neveryone.  I say this because WIS, INT, and CHA all affect how many you<br/>\nmake, how fast you go up and how much it will cost.  I personaly think agree<br/>\nwith Paul&#39;s order to do things, but you should decide for yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Paul Heenan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pheenan@...\">pheenan@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 26, 1999 3:08 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Training past skill level 40<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Paul Heenan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pheenan@...\">pheenan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the list I created in my journey to Master Smith:<br/>\n<br/>\nSharpen weapons - 27<br/>\nScalars - 41<br/>\nLanterns - 70<br/>\nSkewers - 115<br/>\nPots - 122<br/>\nSewing kits - 135<br/>\nAt this point, only Banded Mantles, Leggings and Cloaks raise my skill<br/>\n<br/>\nYou musta been doing Scalars, because Skewers definately go trivial at 115.<br/>\nIf you have any other questions, let me know )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Darrell Runyan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:runyan@...\">runyan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Could someone please help me remember what I should be making to advance<br/>\n&gt; my BS<br/>\n&gt; skill past 40?
