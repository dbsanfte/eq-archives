 </span></blockquote>Yes, you have *utterly* missed the most important<br/>
component of the entire EverQuest armor system.<br/>
<br/>
Damage absorption.<br/>
<br/>
Each type of armor, from naked to cloth to patchwork<br/>
to leather/rawhide to ring to chain to banded to<br/>
plate, has a level of damage absorption.  This is in<br/>
addition and separate from the AC the armor confers. <br/>
There is a *huge* difference in damage taken between<br/>
plate (steel or bronze) and banded.  You can test this<br/>
yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Take a full suit of banded, and a full suit of plate<br/>
(bronze or steel).  Go fight a few blues and note how<br/>
much you lose in the fights.  Then switch over to<br/>
plate and fight a few more of the same types of blues<br/>
as before; you&#39;ll lose considerably less.<br/>
<br/>
This is the number one problem with Rangers; they<br/>
can&#39;t wear better than banded until they get their<br/>
hands on the uber camped (and bugged, IMO; no plate<br/>
should include magical plate too) magical plates like<br/>
Rubicite or Green Splinted, etc...  Watch what happens<br/>
in a group with, say, a Warrior, Paladin and Ranger at<br/>
level 25.  The first two are probably in full plate,<br/>
the Ranger&#39;s in full banded.  The ranger will take<br/>
*considerably* more damage than the Warrior or<br/>
Paladin; plate makes a much more efficient tank.<br/>
<br/>
This problem with Ranger armor is extenuated by<br/>
Rangers&#39; use of Dual/Double; they stay high on the<br/>
hate list and thus end up tanking a lot, even though<br/>
they&#39;re least suited for it.<br/>
<br/>
Banded is nice to about 20; above that any serious<br/>
tank needs to be in plate or they&#39;re going to have to<br/>
lean more heavily on their clerics.  And the clerics<br/>
will spend more time meditating, and run out of mana<br/>
sooner in the fight.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Bronze is heavy, but it&#39;s *worth* *it*.<br/>
