<div id="ygrps-yiv-864819690">Um, there is a list in the blacksmithing guide in game.  Mostly you can make<br/>
armor or things related to making armor or components for the above things.<br/>
Boxes and lanterns also.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve heard alot of discussion on blacksmithing, and it&#39;s all about being<br/>
&gt; able to make banded armor. While I&#39;ve been reading on the subject, I seem<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; recall that you can make other things with blacksmithing skill, but I<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; remember what they are. Can someone write a quick list of things other<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; banded that you can make with blacksmithing?<br/>

&gt; Hi, I subscribe to the digest so I can&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; respond accordingly but I just wanted to mention<br/>
&gt; to those aspiring master blacksmiths (myself<br/>
&gt; included) that making skewers at an early skill<br/>
&gt; level is a really, really, really bad idea.<br/>
&gt; After bits become trivial the next thing you<br/>
&gt; should make it scalers.  This will become trivial<br/>
&gt; at 41 (along with small and medium containers<br/>
&gt; and maybe a few others things, I haven&#39;t checked<br/>
&gt; them all).  After that became trivial for me,<br/>
&gt; I started on lanterns, my skill is now 49 and<br/>
&gt; I have maybe spent 40pp total to get this far.<br/>
&gt; Also I should mention that I sharpened the rusty<br/>
&gt; daggers I got while increasing my fishing skill<br/>
&gt; instead of making metals bits until it became<br/>
&gt; trivial, which is the same skill level that metal<br/>
&gt; bits and files became trivial.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The basic premise to increase your skill it to<br/>
&gt; make things a great many times.  To do this you<br/>
&gt; need to take into account the cost of making<br/>
&gt; an item so you can make more things for your<br/>
&gt; money.  What I did was take all the blacksmithing<br/>
&gt; recipes and calculated the cost to make each<br/>
&gt; item then started making the cheapest thing<br/>
&gt; until it became trivial then move up to the<br/>
&gt; next higher priced item.  For example, to make<br/>
&gt; a metal bit it costs 1g 2s 5c (two bricks and<br/>
&gt; water), but only it only costs 1s 5c (the selling<br/>
&gt; price of a rusty dagger and a sharpening stone)<br/>
&gt; to attempt an increase in the blacksmithing skill<br/>
&gt; before level 21, which would you prefer? I<br/>
&gt; believe the game is set up this way for skill<br/>
&gt; progression, based on my own experiences in<br/>
&gt; fletching (83) and from talking with experts in<br/>
&gt; jewelry making.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately I think a lot of people are reading<br/>
&gt; EQstratics and EQvault to get their blacksmithing<br/>
&gt; trade information which just says &quot;make skewers&quot;<br/>
&gt; until you get a really high skill level then<br/>
&gt; make banded.  All you are going to do is waste<br/>
&gt; hard earned money.   Start looking at the smaller<br/>
&gt; web sites for the real information instead of<br/>
&gt; just the big two with their scanty, incomplete,<br/>
&gt; beta test (and IMHO worthless) information about<br/>
&gt; trade skills.<br/>
