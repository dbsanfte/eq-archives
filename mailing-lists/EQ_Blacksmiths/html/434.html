<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076612706">What some people don&#39;t understand is that, it may LOOK like they are making<br/>
that big profit, but what about all the failures one went through to make<br/>
that ONE suit of armor?  And what about all the trouble he/she went to get<br/>
his/her skill high enough to make it?  Are we just supposed to eat this<br/>
investment and say &quot;I&#39;m going to sell for a few gold above cost so I can<br/>
sell the most armor.&quot;  Those who don&#39;t smith obviously don&#39;t understand<br/>
this.  If this is the way it turns out, then I too will take up another<br/>
trade and make a whole lot more money with it than working my butt off at<br/>
the forge.  I&#39;d like to be able to afford that nice platemail armor before<br/>
I hit level 30, and smithing&#39;s not going to get me there if people expect<br/>
us to sell at a loss.<br/>

&gt;&gt; concidering you have about a 15pp profit if selling at 20pp, 15pp profit<br/>

&gt;&gt; Anything above 20 plat is a ripoff?  I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a ripoff, but<br/>
 </span></blockquote>given<br/>

&gt;&gt; selling much higher than chain prices, which we never will.  20pp for a<br/>
&gt;&gt; tunic is prefectly resonable.<br/>
