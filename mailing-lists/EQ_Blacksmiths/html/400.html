<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369464162">I wasn&#39;t suggesting it was a good idea to have items eventually fall apart.<br/>
Just pointing out that the fact items wear out in RL does have a serious<br/>
effect on the economy.  Now, if they didn&#39;t have items completely wear out,<br/>
but maybe eventually go down to 75% of their max stats and stay there until<br/>
repaired by a skilled tradesman.  They would have to make it so repairs<br/>
didn&#39;t result in the original item being destroyed, however.  How&#39;d you like<br/>
to take your tunic in for repairs and have the smith destroy it.  Magic<br/>
items would be indestructible, of course.  Bah, I hate the entire idea.  I<br/>
wish they&#39;d fix fletching instead.<br/>

I was reading an email from someone that compared the EQ market to the US<br/>
market.  They stated that one reason they are different is because in RL<br/>
things wear out and in EQ they are eternal.  This is so true.  Has anyone<br/>
thought of or actually talked to Verant about having armor wear out?  This<br/>
would cause buyers to go to smiths for repairs or replacements.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know if this seems like a good idea or not.  I think it does.  Let me know<br/>
what you all think of this idea.<br/>
