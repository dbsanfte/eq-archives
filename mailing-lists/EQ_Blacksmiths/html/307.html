&gt;&gt; I just cannot fathom those that are purchasing<br/>
&gt;&gt; BRONZE armor instead of banded armor.  With banded<br/>
&gt;&gt; being sooo much lighter in weight, and (nowadays)<br/>
&gt;&gt; a heck of a lot cheaper, it seems silly to me they<br/>
&gt;&gt; want to pay so much more for the bronze when most<br/>
&gt;&gt; pieces only give 1AC better!<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Am I missing something?  Does this bronze armor have<br/>
&gt;&gt; some &#39;special&#39; powers I don&#39;t know about yet?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes, you have *utterly* missed the most important<br/>
&gt;component of the entire EverQuest armor system.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Damage absorption.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;This is the number one problem with Rangers; they<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t wear better than banded until they get their<br/>
&gt;hands on the uber camped (and bugged, IMO; no plate<br/>
&gt;should include magical plate too) magical plates like<br/>
&gt;Rubicite or Green Splinted, etc...  Watch what happens<br/>
&gt;in a group with, say, a Warrior, Paladin and Ranger at<br/>
&gt;level 25.  The first two are probably in full plate,<br/>
&gt;the Ranger&#39;s in full banded.  The ranger will take<br/>
&gt;*considerably* more damage than the Warrior or<br/>
&gt;Paladin; plate makes a much more efficient tank.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This what reinforced leather is for. AC of banded, absoprtion of plate<br/>
(maybe better, gotta spearmint), and a HELL of a lot lighter.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;This problem with Ranger armor is extenuated by<br/>
&gt;Rangers&#39; use of Dual/Double; they stay high on the<br/>
&gt;hate list and thus end up tanking a lot, even though<br/>
&gt;they&#39;re least suited for it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh...  doesn&#39;t help that my taunt is capped and that I use it as often as<br/>
kick.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Banded is nice to about 20; above that any serious<br/>
&gt;tank needs to be in plate or they&#39;re going to have to<br/>
&gt;lean more heavily on their clerics.  And the clerics<br/>
&gt;will spend more time meditating, and run out of mana<br/>
&gt;sooner in the fight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes, Bronze is heavy, but it&#39;s *worth* *it*.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Feh, buy reinforced from us tailors...  bring us the pelts and boning and<br/>
we&#39;ll probably do it free for the practice.</div>
