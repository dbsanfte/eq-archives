<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888378052">About being able to enchant sheet metal for armor....<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I love the idea.  I think it would be great to get some kick ass armor<br/>
like that!  But then....it wouldn&#39;t be fair.  Think about it.  Enchanters<br/>
already are the best at Jewelry Making.  It is (pretty much) damn foolish<br/>
for anyone BUT an enchanter to learn the skill.  Unless, of course, you also<br/>
play a high lvl enchanter who you use for your own enchanted metals.<br/>
<br/>
By giving enchanters the ability to enchant sheet metal, thereby creating<br/>
magical armor, this make&#39;s enchanters have far too much control over the<br/>
market.  Jewelry making and Blacksmithing all would depend upon enchanters?<br/>
No, I&#39;d rather not have that.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, Magical Armor should be something special.  IMHO, I believe there<br/>
should be quests for Blacksmith&#39;s, where the reward might be a mold that<br/>
comes enchanted with some random quality.  This would allow EVERYone the<br/>
opportunity to do this, and make us not be dependant upon enchanters.<br/>
<br/>
What do you all think?<br/>
