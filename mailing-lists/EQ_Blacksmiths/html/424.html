<div id="ygrps-yiv-201982529">The point is not to have all armor deteriorate, just Smith/Tailor made<br/>
armor.<br/>
<br/>
If Rubicite armor deteriorated, that&#39;d just be dumb, and increase camping<br/>
for items to an even greater degree.<br/>
<br/>
But if ONE type of armor were to decay, banded should be the one to do it.<br/>
Why?  Game balance.  Economics.  Etc.<br/>
<br/>
Just track the amount of time a piece is in game.  Not that difficult.  Make<br/>
it last a good long time.  Say 30 days.  (24 hours a day, so in actuality,<br/>
if you average 4 hours a day, the banded would last you six months of<br/>
playing EQ.)<br/>
<br/>
Have it degrade a bit, not totally . . .<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a great idea.<br/>

&gt; OK, simple question, how many of you people that are for items<br/>
deteriorating and going poof have any magic plate?  (none I&#39;d bet)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve spent about 2 months to get the armor that I am now wearing, I&#39;d be<br/>
pissed to an extreem if I were in the middle of a fight and I see a message<br/>
&quot;Your Charred Black Tunic has fallen appart&quot;.  That one piece of armor alone<br/>
took me the better part of week to get.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, so you say I should have to get it repaired by a smith.  I am DE, and<br/>
by choice I have lowered my faction to the point where I will never be able<br/>
to go into Freeport or Rivervale, and due to built in factions, I can not go<br/>
to any other elf city nor can I go into gnome, dwarf, or barbarian city.<br/>
Which means that I would have to search, not only for a respectable smith<br/>
that I trusted, but also an evil one, or trek my self across the world to<br/>
Qeynos.  Simply to get my armor &quot;repaired&quot;.  Now if that isn&#39;t bad<br/>
enough.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Often my group will go deep into a dungeon, deep to the point where either<br/>
a caster has to group gate us to get us out, or we have to spend 30-45 min<br/>
fighting out way out of the dungeon.  And quite often we&#39;ll all camp and<br/>
logout in a &quot;safe&quot; spot in the dungeon, so sometimes we will be in a dungeon<br/>
litterly for days.  Now, say I get the message &quot;your rubicite helm is<br/>
begining to weaken, you should take it for repairs soon&quot;, that means that my<br/>
entire group would have to leave the dungeon so that I might quest to get my<br/>
armor repaired.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I find neither to be acceptable.  What I do find about this, is that there<br/>
are some smiths who think they don&#39;t make enough money, so they want armor<br/>
to wear out, so it has to either be replaced or repaired (more money for<br/>
smiths).  What they fail to concider is the fact that you will not always be<br/>
wearing banded armor.<br/>

&gt; It would make people too mad. Having a nice piece of magic armor that took<br/>
&gt; forever to get disappear because it wore out. I don&#39;t like this idea, as<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; would just make EQ more like Diablo and Ultima Online, which I hope they<br/>
&gt; would want to try and stay away from.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some other RPG&#39;s I&#39;ve played made it so that common wear items wore<br/>
quicker<br/>
&gt; than others as well as making rare quest items not wear very little or not<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; all since they are supposed to be considered priceless.  I think the idea<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; making items wear would be a great thing for the trade.  A shield and<br/>
sword<br/>
&gt; would wear quicker than say boots or leggings.  This gives smiths an<br/>
&gt; oppurtunity to increase their skills with less cost if they want to work<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; repairing and improving items.<br/>
