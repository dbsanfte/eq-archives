<div id="ygrps-yiv-68868137">The method I am using so far is:<br/>
<br/>
I started out with 19 points, then made files till it was trivial (like 23 I<br/>
think), then I switched to scalars and now I have a skill of 29.  I was<br/>
under the impression that you do scalars till you max in that, then switch<br/>
to skewers.  <br/>
<br/>
That is what I know on the process.  Something I have not heard anyone talk<br/>
about ever is your faction standing and how it effects the smithing process.<br/>
Being a wood elf currently I thought the best place to go to get ore would<br/>
be Steamfont.  But all the gnomes there are apprehensive of me which means<br/>
bad prices.  The only other place I knew to go was N Freeport, so I made the<br/>
long journey and low and behold the humans regard me indifferently.  I ended<br/>
up saving a Silver per ore and 2 copper per water.  Now on  its own that<br/>
does sound like much, but thing of how much ore you have buy.  Every 100 ore<br/>
you buy you save a platinum.<br/>
<br/>
So that is my addition to the forum for now I guess.  Anyone know about what<br/>
skill one can make studs reliably and what you need to make them?<br/>
<br/>
Thanx,<br/>

it seems that from skill 25 to skill 40 scalars are a good skill gain item, <br/>
from 41 to prob mid 50&#39;s lantern casings seem to be providing better results<br/>
<br/>
than skewers according to my source...<br/>
<br/>
also rumors are floating around that a PC smith who refuses to divulge his <br/>
secret has discovered how to make Plate Armor of some kind<br/>
