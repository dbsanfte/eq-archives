&gt; &gt;2) Where can banded molds be purchased for each size?  I know you can<br/>
&gt; &gt;buy medium in Freeport, small in Kelethin and large somewhere like Grobb<br/>
&gt; &gt;or Oggok, but there surely must be more.  Any help is appreciated,<br/>
&gt; &gt;particularly for large molds in a place non-evil characters can visit<br/>
&gt; &gt;and small molds on the continent of Antonica.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have never seen small molds on Antonica.  It&#39;d be near Rivervale if<br/>
&gt; anywhere.  You can get large molds from the McMannus Village in the west<br/>
&gt; plains of Karana, and medium from the Sayers in the cottage on the road<br/>
&gt; between Qeynos and Surefall Glade.<br/>

quickly (I&#39;m a bard), which village is the McMannus village?<br/>
