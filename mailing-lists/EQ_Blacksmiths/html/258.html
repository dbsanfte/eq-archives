<div id="ygrps-yiv-699370111">You will have problems being a Blacksmith because you start in Halas.  The<br/>
pieces of ore that you need to make &quot;metal bits&quot; which are the most basic<br/>
thing that you can make, are not availiable on your side of the continient.<br/>
With an intelligence of 60, you will take longer to gain skill points, but<br/>
it is still possible.  I still find it strange that ore is not availiable<br/>
in Halas, a town and a race of people that would be perfect Blacksmiths.<br/>
