<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902890340">Thank you, I was just trying to get help.  I joined this list so that I<br/>
could get help and discuss things.  I thought that was what this was for.<br/>
<br/>
I heard that there was a quest where you are given a mold and you have to<br/>
smith a weapon.  Has anyone else heard about this and what smithing skill<br/>
should we be at before we waste the mold by not being skillfull enough ?<br/>
<br/>
Also, does the studded leather armor have any magic properties or just a<br/>
better armor class.  Could we get an Enchanter to enchant the metal studs<br/>
to do this ?<br/>
