<b>Subject:</b> Sharpening ... Stone <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099189270">OK, basic question I know, but I have to ask anyway.  I have a rusted sword, how do I get it to good quality again?  I would think a sharpening stone.  I guess the question is how do you make a sharpenting stone, or do you obtain it some place and then how do you apply it?  I found the guy I can purchase ore from and can get a flask of water.  I haven&#39;t even opened up blacksmithing yet (will this evening).  Can any one give me a little guidence on the best way to open this skill up other than trial and error.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help<br/>
<br/>
