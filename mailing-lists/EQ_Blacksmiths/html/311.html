<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417203176">One thing everybody must learn, prices can ALWAYS go down and NEVER go up. Don&#39;t<br/>
take never literally, though. We need to raise prices on banded. 7 for gorgets,<br/>
8 for bracers, 11 for masks, 13 for helmets, 12 for sleeves, 12 for mantle, 20<br/>
for mail, 20 for cloak, 12 for belt, 19 for leggings, 11 for boots. These prices<br/>
give us significant profit on 100% success and help even out the profits for<br/>
when we fail. If ALL of us sell at these prices and stick to them (don&#39;t let<br/>
them drop you more than a plat), then the &#39;low priced&#39; banded sellers will be<br/>
very scarce indeed. Then you can see the &#39;wait an hour&#39; frustration on the<br/>
buyers end. If someone auctions they are willing to pay 5 plat for a banded<br/>
bracer for over an hour, they&#39;ll be frustrated enough to give up and pay the<br/>
damn 8 plat. If we have a set price that majority follows, then we will still<br/>
sell. While the discount smith might sell 10 gorgets at 2 and a half plat profit<br/>
each, we&#39;ll sell at LEAST 5 gorgets in the same amount of time for 5 and a half<br/>
plat profit each. They might be making 25 plat, but we&#39;re making 27.5 and have<br/>
less chances for a failure :) If we group together and work as one group of<br/>
dedicated smiths, we can only win. If we become bitter enemies over who has the<br/>
lowest price, the price war will just destroy us all. We will ruin the value of<br/>
smithing. NO MORE DISCOUNTS!!! :)<br/>

&gt; I agree with the pricing problems of banded... I too have had to watch some<br/>
&gt; smiths selling banded armor at what is basically the cost of materials!<br/>
&gt; (not the actual cost which would take into account the time and cost to<br/>
&gt; learn smithing)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From time to time I too have sold some cheap, but it is usually when I have<br/>
&gt; made way too many of something and had it on me way too long... So, I need<br/>
&gt; to get rid of some of the &#39;old&#39; stock...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I think the real problem with the pricing comes not from overstock, but<br/>
&gt; mostly from impatience.  People think that they should be able to /Auction<br/>
&gt; 1-2 times and that if nobody answers them, they want to go to the next zone<br/>
&gt; (&quot;where there are more people&quot;) to try to sell there... Then, when nobody<br/>
&gt; wants to buy right away, they start discounting it to the cost!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People, you have to understand something about selling... IT TAKES TIME!!!<br/>
&gt; Just like the smithing itself does...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you have ever been in a fine clothier or jewelery store, you might have<br/>
&gt; noticed that there isn&#39;t a whole lot of customers &#39;shopping&#39; around<br/>
&gt; inside... They are there selling a quality product for a good profit... that<br/>
&gt; is the way they make their money and keep their reputation of a fine<br/>
&gt; product...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Much different then Sears or some warehouse store that is basing sales on<br/>
&gt; HUGE Volumes because they (vendors) get huge discounts on the items<br/>
&gt; (Materials cost)...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, remember folks, this isn&#39;t Kmart!!  Don&#39;t try to sell at Kmart<br/>
&gt; prices!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I often hang out at the banks or gates of a city selling my wares... and<br/>
&gt; there have been times when I sat there for 5 min or more without selling a<br/>
&gt; thing, or even getting a query as to the prices and such!  This can seem<br/>
&gt; veeeery frustrating... but look at it in a different light:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night I spent about an hour selling banded armor... and guess what?  I<br/>
&gt; made about 30 plat in profit (over costs of the materials, not actual<br/>
&gt; costs - I am about even now... hehe...)  How long would it take you to earn<br/>
&gt; 30 plat in, say, Unrest?  or NRo?  Probably at least twice as long, and only<br/>
&gt; if you got some good loot off some mob!  If you can just relax and sit back<br/>
&gt; and sell armor for a couple of hours, you can make about 30-50 plat per day<br/>
&gt; just off of that... Then you won&#39;t mind going to those places where you earn<br/>
&gt; lots of experience, but get no good loot... Because it will allready be in<br/>
&gt; the bank!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, remember... Keep those prices up there for a GOOD profit... and RELAX!!!<br/>
&gt; Take the time needed to sell...  Just because there are only 14 people in<br/>
&gt; NFP and nobody buys from you in the first 5 minutes doesn&#39;t mean that 5<br/>
&gt; minutes later the SAME 14 people will be in that zone!  They change all the<br/>
&gt; time.... just look at the names... Oh, and if you see some that are there<br/>
&gt; for a long time, they are probably selling too!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think this was directed at my comment about doing scalers, lanterns, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; skewers till trivial, and by then you&#39;ll be popping out the banded.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; comment was intended to mean at 115 you&#39;ll be popping out the banded<br/>
&gt; (which<br/>
&gt; &gt; is where skewers were trivial for me).  If it wasn&#39;t, then disregard.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As far as selling banded...I have all but stopped playing my enchanter<br/>
&gt; &gt; because I got burned out on all the requests for armor.  I logged him in<br/>
&gt; &gt; last night and within 5 minutes was hit with 4 requests from return<br/>
&gt; &gt; customers.  This was after taking 10 days off from the game.  I politely<br/>
&gt; &gt; refused all 4 requests and promptly rolled up a new enchanter so I could<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually do something besides standing behind a hot forge making armor.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sometimes making money is less important than doing some hard core<br/>
&gt; &gt; adventuring, though RP&#39;able situations seem to present themselves more<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; you play the role of a traveling salesman (or salesperson for you more<br/>
&gt; &gt; politically correct types).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you want to build your business, travel.  I have hit every remote<br/>
&gt; region<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the world and sold jewelry, armor, and other miscellaneous wares there.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I sold one high elf fellow a polar bear cloak and got a tell from him two<br/>
&gt; &gt; days later asking for a full suit of banded.  I mentioned my recent first<br/>
&gt; &gt; success in making silver-jade mana rings and added another 12pp to the<br/>
&gt; sale<br/>
&gt; &gt; on the spot.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you really want to make money on trade skills, do several of them, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; pick up critter dropped items or quest items as you travel and sell them<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the other side of the world.  I&#39;ve made a lot of friends and a ton of<br/>
&gt; money.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I laugh now when someone asks me how in the hell a 13th level enchanter<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; afford a dragoon dirk (and crookstinger), skull of Jhen&#39;tra, polar bear<br/>
&gt; &gt; cloak, mana rings, golden ear studs, and various other assorted goodies.<br/>
&gt; If<br/>
&gt; &gt; they only knew there&#39;s a few hundred plat, a full set of bronze, two sets<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; banded, a runed totem staff, and two or three sets of all my research<br/>
&gt; spell<br/>
&gt; &gt; components through 29th level sitting in my vault.  That&#39;s all after<br/>
&gt; outfitt<br/>
&gt; &gt; ing my wife and 4 buddies with full sets of banded at cost, and a few<br/>
&gt; &gt; donations made to the young here and there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; No, I hardly think the banded market is dead.  It&#39;s been damaged a bit by<br/>
&gt; &gt; low priced swindlers running through town selling gorgets for 3pp each and<br/>
&gt; &gt; bracers for 4pp each.  Nothing like telling someone that a tunic will cost<br/>
&gt; &gt; them 20pp only to get the reply &quot;there&#39;s a guy that comes through here<br/>
&gt; every<br/>
&gt; &gt; week and sells them for 12pp, so I&#39;m not paying a penny more.&quot;  That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; fine.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Within the hour I sell it for 17 to 20pp depending on how much haggling<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; victim..er..I mean..person does and whether or not I&#39;ve done business with<br/>
&gt; &gt; them before.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There&#39;s a term that fits trade skills pretty well, diversity.  If you put<br/>
&gt; &gt; all of your money in one trade skill and expect to buy everything you ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; wanted with it within a week, well, good damn luck to you.  Myself, I<br/>
&gt; funded<br/>
&gt; &gt; my jewelry making with my smithing, and my smithing was funded by selling<br/>
&gt; &gt; polar bear cloaks and similar quest items.   Now that I&#39;m pretty much set<br/>
&gt; &gt; financially for a while, I&#39;ll go back to killing stuff and making levels.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s going to be nice to buy all of my 16th level spells as soon as I hit<br/>
&gt; &gt; 16th. The best part is, I&#39;ve gotten a lot of invitations to hunt from my<br/>
&gt; &gt; customers, so I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have trouble finding a group to help me<br/>
&gt; hit<br/>
&gt; &gt; the next dozen or so levels.  :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just my 2 cents.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;scalers are trivial at 41, no way you be popping out the banded at that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;level. Oh ya, no one wants banded anymore, so it is really pointless to<br/>
&gt; try<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;and sell anything. In what I have seen on my server, most people want<br/>
&gt; &gt; bronze<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;armor. You can still sell, but a lot more diffucult to do so.<br/>
