<div id="ygrps-yiv-810351518">I saw the following site promoted on EQVault: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~sblack9/Blacksmiths.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~sblack9/Blacksmiths.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
The author makes many good points about keeping costs in line with the effort needed to attain the skill level. I remember an earlier attempt at a trade guild on E&#39;ci that also promoted &quot;price fixing&quot; but eventually failed. This site at least allows you to &quot;find&quot; smiths on your server and place orders via email, so no more hunting around the various zones trying to drum up business. <br/>
<br/>
What do you, as fellow smiths, think of the idea? If you aren&#39;t already on board, will you sign up? <br/>
<br/>
This list has been dead too long, let&#39;s stir up some discussion!<br/>
