<div id="ygrps-yiv-649851811">I&#39;ve worked my models on the assumption that there are a limited amount of smiths out there<br/>
and there won&#39;t be 4 smiths in a zone. You&#39;ve seen how many auctions there are for banded. Try<br/>
ignoring them once and seeing how long they can run on for. This isn&#39;t a matter of<br/>
competition, it&#39;s a matter of &#39;they want it if they can get a fair price&#39;. The point of price<br/>
fixing is to fix that &#39;fair price&#39; at a higher amount than it is currently. The more people<br/>
that sell higher, the more accustomed people will become to paying it, and the more &#39;fair&#39;<br/>
they feel it will be. If there&#39;s another smith in a zone when I first walk in, and I intend on<br/>
selling any banded, I politely change zones no matter what their price. I will not undersell<br/>
them out of courtesy and it&#39;d be pointless to oversell them. I don&#39;t even sell at equal prices<br/>
because I might be taking sales they would have otherwise gotten. This is just my politeness,<br/>
though, if you want to make a few enemies, go ahead and undersell every smith you see. All<br/>
you&#39;ll get is a crashing market on your head and a poisoned dagger in your back.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the point, though, your argument with me so far has been that price fixing won&#39;t work<br/>
because people will always sell for lower and customers will refuse to buy for the higher<br/>
price. The truth is, people are starting to sell for higher all across the boards, and<br/>
customers are buying at a greater profit to those of us who have decided to price raise.<br/>
Whether you realize it or not, that&#39;s a fact, and you can&#39;t dispute it. You can&#39;t tell me<br/>
green is blue any more than you can tell me people won&#39;t buy my banded because it&#39;s higher<br/>
priced. So, to conclude, pick your side. Side A spends an hour a day making banded, Side B<br/>
spends 5 hours. Both sides make the same profit.<br/>

&gt; First of all, the RL name thing isn&#39;t meant to offend you. People call me<br/>
&gt; &#39;Nick&#39; all the time,<br/>
&gt; be it in e-mail, message boards, or whatever. It&#39;s my name, I don&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; care. If you do,<br/>
&gt; however, I&#39;ll respect that and stick to Cerran. I&#39;m not out to offend you,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just trying to<br/>
&gt; prove a point<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not especially known for banded on my server, I&#39;m at an equal platform<br/>
&gt; with everyone else.<br/>
&gt; If I can sell at a price, other people can too. So, when I sell at higher<br/>
&gt; prices, that proves<br/>
&gt; to other smiths that they can as well. Instead of undermining my price and<br/>
&gt; making less money<br/>
&gt; per sale, they can go to a different zone and sell for the same price I am.<br/>
&gt; Sales are out<br/>
&gt; there, and if the market isn&#39;t oversaturated then they always will be. Why<br/>
&gt; get less money and<br/>
&gt; contribute to market oversaturation at the same time? Both are negative<br/>
&gt; things to a smith.<br/>
&gt; Charging less money, we both lose, charging the same price, we both win. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t see how<br/>
&gt; somebody can justify competition between smiths as &#39;a good business<br/>
&gt; strategy&#39;. If they charge<br/>
&gt; the same price as me, they&#39;ll make more money than if they charged less!! I<br/>
&gt; make more money<br/>
&gt; since the price raise, it shouldn&#39;t be different for anyone else. As for new<br/>
&gt; smiths who<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t mastered the trade yet, I have no idea where you&#39;re getting your<br/>
&gt; idea from. Why would<br/>
&gt; any reasonably intelligent person charge less for an item when they&#39;re in a<br/>
&gt; higher need for<br/>
&gt; money? This is what you&#39;re telling me. Since they need money, they will<br/>
&gt; charge a lower price.<br/>
&gt; Usually I put more logic into my arguments, but I can&#39;t even touch that<br/>
&gt; because it simply does<br/>
&gt; not make sense. Newer smiths would want to charge higher prices so they can<br/>
&gt; get more money so<br/>
&gt; they can spend more money on practicing their smithing! I&#39;m assuming that<br/>
&gt; every new smith on<br/>
&gt; this board is in favor of the price raise. If you&#39;re a new smith and you<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t in favor of<br/>
&gt; price raising, frankly, you have your head shoved right up your ass. You&#39;re<br/>
&gt; ruining the market<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re just getting into by selling at lower prices, and you&#39;re making less<br/>
&gt; money now and in<br/>
&gt; the long run. There is no justification for that, it&#39;s just plain idiotic.<br/>

&gt; Unfortunately Nick you&#39;ve displayed your total lack of knowledge of how price<br/>
&gt; affects a supply and demand model.  If you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s the most basic model of economics.  Anyone who doesn&#39;t, I would suggest<br/>
&gt; you go find out.  So that you understand what the logic is behind your<br/>
&gt; competition driving their prices down in order to stimulate more demand for<br/>
&gt; their armor over yours.  You might also want to read up on the concept of<br/>
&gt; liquidity and how it affects one&#39;s business.  That might also explain the idea<br/>
&gt; of selling at a discount to raise cash.  Artificially setting prices does not<br/>
&gt; work.  Any smith with half a brain will know that if there are four &quot;smiths&quot;<br/>
&gt; in the same area that seem to be selling well at &lt;x&gt; price he/she can sell<br/>
&gt; better than them at a discount.  We wouldn&#39;t be having this discussion if<br/>
&gt; there weren&#39;t people already doing this that are affecting the market.<br/>
