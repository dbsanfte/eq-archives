  Subject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Bronze armor <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Is it possible to smith bronze armor?  I don&#39;t think it is possible, but I thought I would ask just in case.  Also where in the faydwer area can I get the second smithing book.  I only have the first.  <br/>
  Thank you </span></blockquote></div>
