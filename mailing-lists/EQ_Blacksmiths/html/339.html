 </span></blockquote>You are flat wrong.  Period.  Reinforced leather does<br/>
not *even* begin to compare to even banded, much less<br/>
plate.  No way.  Not even close.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, reinforced leather is great for<br/>
non-banded classes (druids, etc..)  Problem is, there<br/>
are very few tailors with sufficient skills.<br/>
