<div id="ygrps-yiv-302653066">I think this was directed at my comment about doing scalers, lanterns, and<br/>
skewers till trivial, and by then you&#39;ll be popping out the banded.  The<br/>
comment was intended to mean at 115 you&#39;ll be popping out the banded (which<br/>
is where skewers were trivial for me).  If it wasn&#39;t, then disregard.<br/>
<br/>
As far as selling banded...I have all but stopped playing my enchanter<br/>
because I got burned out on all the requests for armor.  I logged him in<br/>
last night and within 5 minutes was hit with 4 requests from return<br/>
customers.  This was after taking 10 days off from the game.  I politely<br/>
refused all 4 requests and promptly rolled up a new enchanter so I could<br/>
actually do something besides standing behind a hot forge making armor.<br/>
Sometimes making money is less important than doing some hard core<br/>
adventuring, though RP&#39;able situations seem to present themselves more when<br/>
you play the role of a traveling salesman (or salesperson for you more<br/>
politically correct types).<br/>
<br/>
If you want to build your business, travel.  I have hit every remote region<br/>
of the world and sold jewelry, armor, and other miscellaneous wares there.<br/>
I sold one high elf fellow a polar bear cloak and got a tell from him two<br/>
days later asking for a full suit of banded.  I mentioned my recent first<br/>
success in making silver-jade mana rings and added another 12pp to the sale<br/>
on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to make money on trade skills, do several of them, and<br/>
pick up critter dropped items or quest items as you travel and sell them to<br/>
the other side of the world.  I&#39;ve made a lot of friends and a ton of money.<br/>
I laugh now when someone asks me how in the hell a 13th level enchanter can<br/>
afford a dragoon dirk (and crookstinger), skull of Jhen&#39;tra, polar bear<br/>
cloak, mana rings, golden ear studs, and various other assorted goodies.  If<br/>
they only knew there&#39;s a few hundred plat, a full set of bronze, two sets of<br/>
banded, a runed totem staff, and two or three sets of all my research spell<br/>
components through 29th level sitting in my vault.  That&#39;s all after outfitt<br/>
ing my wife and 4 buddies with full sets of banded at cost, and a few<br/>
donations made to the young here and there.<br/>
<br/>
No, I hardly think the banded market is dead.  It&#39;s been damaged a bit by<br/>
low priced swindlers running through town selling gorgets for 3pp each and<br/>
bracers for 4pp each.  Nothing like telling someone that a tunic will cost<br/>
them 20pp only to get the reply &quot;there&#39;s a guy that comes through here every<br/>
week and sells them for 12pp, so I&#39;m not paying a penny more.&quot;  That&#39;s fine.<br/>
Within the hour I sell it for 17 to 20pp depending on how much haggling the<br/>
victim..er..I mean..person does and whether or not I&#39;ve done business with<br/>
them before.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a term that fits trade skills pretty well, diversity.  If you put<br/>
all of your money in one trade skill and expect to buy everything you ever<br/>
wanted with it within a week, well, good damn luck to you.  Myself, I funded<br/>
my jewelry making with my smithing, and my smithing was funded by selling<br/>
polar bear cloaks and similar quest items.   Now that I&#39;m pretty much set<br/>
financially for a while, I&#39;ll go back to killing stuff and making levels.<br/>
It&#39;s going to be nice to buy all of my 16th level spells as soon as I hit<br/>
16th. The best part is, I&#39;ve gotten a lot of invitations to hunt from my<br/>
customers, so I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have trouble finding a group to help me hit<br/>
the next dozen or so levels.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>

&gt;scalers are trivial at 41, no way you be popping out the banded at that<br/>
&gt;level. Oh ya, no one wants banded anymore, so it is really pointless to try<br/>
&gt;and sell anything. In what I have seen on my server, most people want<br/>
