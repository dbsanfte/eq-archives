<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782834924">I was forging skewers that night alternating with another smith, and he said he&#39;d heard that it was for the upcoming plate mail. Dont know if true but hope so. I highly doubt we&#39;ll ever be allowed to create anything magical though. And if we did, not without an Enchanter to enchant the stuff which&#39;d put a crimp in the works in a big way to find then bribe them. <br/>
<br/>
Is there in game a metal that inherently has magical properties, like say mithril?<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if they&#39;d let a cleric of a Smith or warrior type god enchant armor and weapons too. :) That&#39;d be a nice thing for the clerics to get.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I noticed the forge too. It&#39;s not for the paladin armor though, we forge that armor with only two slots (armor mold and bar of ronium, we don&#39;t even use water to forge it.) I&#39;m guessing that they either added something to the game, or are going to in the near future. (Maybe we&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt; able to finally forge things that have magic properties, or they&#39;ll add new weapons, or plate mail.)<br/>

&gt; Subject: What happened to the forge?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, what exactly happened in the patch yesterday? I went to make a suit of<br/>
&gt; banded and when I clicked on the forge it now has 10 slots! Did they add<br/>
&gt; something and not tell us? What is out there that needs 10 slots to create?<br/>
&gt; Is this just part of the Paladin armor quest I have been reading about? I<br/>
&gt; looked all over several cities to see if any new molds were there and found<br/>
&gt; nothing. If anybody knows the reasoning behind this, please post.<br/>
