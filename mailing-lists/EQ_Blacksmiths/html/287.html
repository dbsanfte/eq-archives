&gt; I was online with a new smith the other day, and she didn&#39;t want to waste<br/>
&gt; her points, so she just bought a sharpening stone and started sharpening<br/>
&gt; weapons... She increased VERY fast (while we were talking she went from<br/>
&gt; level 1-15 in about 5 minutes!) and at the same time she was getting to<br/>
&gt; keep<br/>
&gt; the stones many times too...  (she had saved lots of old daggers)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She then started making bits and that was where I left her... She messaged<br/>
&gt; me about 10 min later to tell me she was already over 21 now and was<br/>
&gt; starting on files.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, you can increase very quickly now without having to put 20 points into<br/>
&gt; it... If you don&#39;t have lots of extra points to spend that is.<br/>
