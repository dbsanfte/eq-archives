Subject: Sharpening ... Stone<br/>
<br/>
OK, basic question I know, but I have to ask anyway.  I have a rusted<br/>
sword, how do I get it to good quality again?  I would think a<br/>
sharpening stone.  I guess the question is how do you make a sharpenting<br/>
stone, or do you obtain it some place and then how do you apply it?  I<br/>
found the guy I can purchase ore from and can get a flask of water.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t even opened up blacksmithing yet (will this evening).  Can any<br/>
one give me a little guidence on the best way to open this skill up<br/>
other than trial and error.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help<br/>

<br/>
Well, from what I understand (I&#39;m not a blacksmith, but have been<br/>
researching it a bit), you can use blacksmithing skill to get a rusty<br/>
weapon<br/>
to tarnished, which will (I believe) decrease the delay, but leave the<br/>
damage alone. If your successful in trying, you get a tarnished weapon.<br/>
If<br/>
you fail, you destroy the weapon. The exact procedure, I&#39;m not sure of,<br/>
sorry.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve seen a doc on blacksmithing somewhere on a board that had<br/>
sharpening of<br/>
weapons in it, but I can&#39;t find it at the moment. Anyone know where that<br/>
is?<br/>

Best way to increase skill at first is to first off, use as many<br/>
practice pts from your guild allowable ( usually around 20). then i<br/>
would start finding a real damn good source of income as this next plan<br/>
drains you. you make skewers.<br/>
first, ( after you have about 30 plat with you : ) make 40 metal bits<br/>
worth of ore. buy about 40 waters too ( summoned water will NOT work)<br/>
now, go find the vendor that sells molds of &quot;skewers&quot;. Also, you might<br/>
want to get about 4 large backpacks in your inventory. buy as many<br/>
skewer molds as possilbe. now, just spend all you&#39;ve got trying to make<br/>
skewers. they are very difficult to make so until your tivial, you might<br/>
find them damn near impossible to make. ** you gain skill failing too**<br/>
ingrediants for skewers:<br/>
1 water flask<br/>
1 skewer mold<br/>
1 metal bit ( its been awhile...i&#39;m pretty sure its only 1)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 you may find this a bit expensive but let me give you an idea what a<br/>
master smith is capable of making: Once you can make banded armor, (the<br/>
tunic) go around offereing to trade banded for someones chain tunic. (<br/>
also, NPC&#39;s dont like player made crap so dont bother with them.) if you<br/>
can trade a banded tunic for a chain tunic...you just made yourself at<br/>
least 60 plat! ( banded is lighter, and with the same AC as chain)<br/>

Okey peoples...<br/>
<br/>
before you go blowing all your hard earn plat for nothing let me at<br/>
least<br/>
give you the order in witch you need to work on things...<br/>
<br/>
Make these items till they are trivial, then move onto the next.<br/>
<br/>
Train 20 pts in Blacksmithing from guild<br/>
metal bits<br/>
scalers<br/>
lanterns<br/>
skewers<br/>
<br/>
after that you should be able to make some small banded pieces. My<br/>
roommate<br/>
has been working a few weeks and has used close to 150 plat working on<br/>
his<br/>
skill.  He made alot of mistakes on the way (as you do when you are<br/>
figuring<br/>
things out) so I imagine it would be a bit cheaper now.  Also he did not<br/>
shop around to find the best prices.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck.<br/>

Subject: Re: Sharpening ... Stone<br/>
<br/>
There are two books for blacksmithing, one is &quot;blacksmith&quot; something <br/>
(sorry, forgot) and the other is called &quot;weapons and armors&quot; (or very <br/>
close). Dunno which one explains it but you should buy them anyway, <br/>
they just cost over 1gp.<br/>
<br/>
If you want the answer here, you have to buy sharpening stones (not <br/>
sold everywhere) at 3 or 4cp a piece and then put the rusty weapon <br/>
and a sharpening stone in a forge (available somewhere in most <br/>
cities, ask around) and then hit combine. If you&#39;re lucky you&#39;ll get <br/>
a taarnished weapon which will be a couple delay points faster! Not <br/>
bad. You might however fail and then loose both the wepon and the <br/>
stone (lost anyway).<br/>
<br/>
For me sharpening weapons became trivial at a smithing skill of 22. I <br/>
think it means that my smithing skill won&#39;t increase from it, dunno <br/>
if it means I will never be more successful. I succeed most of the <br/>
time anyway.<br/>

You don&#39;t sharpen a stone. You sharpen a weapon. But, on the polish, I<br/>
have <br/>
not seen it anywhere, but, it would make sense, because there are some <br/>
weapons that say shiny brass on them. Shiny being from polish? Not sure.<br/>
