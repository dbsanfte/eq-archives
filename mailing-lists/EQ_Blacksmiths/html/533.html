I have often wondered how it came about that CRAFTED armor did NOT require<br/>
the use of a blacksmith?!?!  It&#39;s called CRAFTED though??  Who but a smith<br/>
would be crafting armor??<br/>
<br/>
As to the ability to make weapons, if we cannot make Fine Steel quality<br/>
weapons, where do they come from? Is there a mysterious NPC smith that makes<br/>
and sells all the FS items to the creatures?  How pray tell do they get them<br/>
then?<br/>
<br/>
Smithing needs DRASTIC changes and enhancements to make it more realistic<br/>
(making pots should be EASIER than making Banded armor, not harder) as well<br/>
as more profitable for the time it takes...<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve heard weapon smithing is now implemented! Unfortunately they&#39;re not<br/>
quite as good as FS, so hopefully they&#39;ll be either enchantable or a<br/>
stepping-stone to a high enough skill level to make plate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another item, not exactly a change but of interest to those smiths who are<br/>
paladins like myself: the new Temple zone supposedly has a Paladin who will<br/>
give you or give you quests for molds to make special armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t get on to see what other changes may have taken place to smithing,<br/>
but check your vendors, check your books, and post back to the list what you<br/>
find.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
