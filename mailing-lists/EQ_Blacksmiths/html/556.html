<div id="ygrps-yiv-513143712">It depends on what you goal is.  if you want to increase your skill, then<br/>
yes, wear as much INT stuff as you can while practicing.  If you want to<br/>
fail less often, then wear as much WIS stuff as you can while practicing.<br/>
When you are buying and selling, wear as much CHA stuff as you can.<br/>

Is it better to wear + int stuff while practicing? My smith is a shaman so<br/>
does<br/>
not have a high int. I am curios if I would get more improves if I put on a<br/>
whole bunch of +int stuff while practicing<br/>
