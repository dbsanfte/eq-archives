&gt;Greetings all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Having recently taken up this hobby that is more expensive than crack<br/>
&gt;and harder on your wrists than being a professional flyswatter, I have<br/>
&gt;several quesitons that hopefully some of you can answer:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) What determines how hard a particular piece of armour is?  Is price<br/>
&gt;of the mold a good indicator?  Is there a table of this anywhere?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) Where can banded molds be purchased for each size?  I know you can<br/>
&gt;buy medium in Freeport, small in Kelethin and large somewhere like Grobb<br/>
&gt;or Oggok, but there surely must be more.  Any help is appreciated,<br/>
&gt;particularly for large molds in a place non-evil characters can visit<br/>
&gt;and small molds on the continent of Antonica.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have never seen small molds on Antonica.  It&#39;d be near Rivervale if<br/>
anywhere.  You can get large molds from the McMannus Village in the west<br/>
plains of Karana, and medium from the Sayers in the cottage on the road<br/>
between Qeynos and Surefall Glade.<br/>
