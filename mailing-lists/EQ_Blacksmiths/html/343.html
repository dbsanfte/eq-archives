&gt; Heyas,<br/>
&gt;   I am a fairly new smith on Innoruuk, my skill is currently at 92. Here<br/>
is my<br/>
&gt; question. At what skill level should I expect a high enough success rate<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; making sheets that I can stop dragging sheets from Freeport , and just by<br/>
ore in<br/>
&gt; HighHold. Those little buggers in Rivervale need armor, but I cannot find<br/>
sheets<br/>
&gt; anywhere near them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                                                         Thanks Nagol<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) you&#39;re driving smiths away; it&#39;s not worth their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; time anymore.  But I know, you think this is good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because you get more business.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) you &#39;teach&#39; the buyers they don&#39;t have to pay more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; than rock-bottom prices.  But again, you think this is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; good because you get more business, because you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; happy making a few gold over cost.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Take a look at this, thne think about it for a bit.  Seems sort of like<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; real world doesn&#39;t it?  I don&#39;t know about you, but where I come from<br/>
there<br/>
&gt; &gt; are always people willing to make a bit less of a profit, and just do<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; &gt; sales.  Puts me a bit in mind of Kmart, Wallmart, Circit City, etc. etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; etc.  And not only these giants have been able to make a living by<br/>
selling<br/>
&gt; &gt; low, there are plenty of mom and pop stores that do the same, usualy<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt; these smaller shops you get a bit less for your money, usualy in less of<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; customer service ability, little or no warranty, etc.  Luckily in EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt; customer serveice isn&#39;t a problem... at least INSIDE the game, since<br/>
things<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t break down.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) you flood the market, so everyone has banded, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; very soon, the server has all the banded it needs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is the one I laugh about, because you&#39;re too<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; shortsighted to understand it.  When everyone has<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; banded, you log on and auction you&#39;re selling it, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone shrugs because they already have what they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; want.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh I just love this, especially after I spent the last three days trying<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; find Large Banded for my new character, and ended up paying every cent I<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; &gt; on two pieces of Bronze because NO ONE, answered my auctions about<br/>
looking<br/>
&gt; &gt; to buy banded.  You know why it&#39;s such a pain to get banded nowadays?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Because of the people you are speaking of, the ones that make banded<br/>
&gt; &gt; unprofitable for many smiths.  Looks to me like they are doing a great<br/>
job<br/>
&gt; &gt; of cornering the market.<br/>
