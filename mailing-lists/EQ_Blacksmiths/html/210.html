<div id="ygrps-yiv-620921238">depends on what is being twinked.....a lvl 5 in full rubicite is crazy.  Not only that, but people who twink out their other characters like this are the people who FARM items.  They camp until they get their item, which I don&#39;t have a problem with, then they continue to camp camp camp camp camp to get crap for their guild buddies and for their lower lvl characters, depriving the people who DESERVE the items the chance to get them....and thats where I have a problem with twinking.<br/>

Out of curiousity, what is your problem with twinking? How does twinking<br/>
degrade your play and or fun? How does it prevent you from doing<br/>
leveling, completing quests, goofing off? If the gear was on a level 50<br/>
PC, how is this better than a level 1 PC? <br/>
<br/>
Just curious, cause personally, I think telling people what they can and<br/>
cannot do with items they own is silly in the first place, and I&#39;ve<br/>
never noticed any lessening of my enjoyment of the game due to some<br/>
twinking. Well, I&#39;ve thought to myself &quot;Garsh, it&#39;d sure be nice if *I*<br/>
had that...&quot;<br/>

&gt; Joint bank accounts wouldn&#39;t be that great of an idea... For the reasons you<br/>
&gt; stated, it would, but it would be abused too easily to help *twink* another<br/>
&gt; character up...<br/>
