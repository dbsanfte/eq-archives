<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379043946">Metal Ore and sharpening stones can be found in the following places:<br/>
<br/>
Neriak - The place with the fish...some guy by a dart board.<br/>
Steamfont - One of the windmills close to the gnome city<br/>
Freeport - The Forge (not the one in the marketplace)<br/>
High Pass Hold - Haven&#39;t actually made it to this one alive, but everyone<br/>
tells me it&#39;s there.<br/>
I&#39;ve also been told that there are some high level hunting areas where the<br/>
critters drop the ore when they kick the bucket.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These are the only four locations I know of.  Another point of interest --<br/>
East Freeport has a shop that sells only rusty weapons.  I&#39;ve been there but<br/>
can&#39;t remember where exactly.  Instead of using all my training points I<br/>
spent only 2 points and made the next 21 levels by sharpening weapons and<br/>
then selling them.  Most of them i sold back to the shop at a loss, but I<br/>
managed to sell some two handers for 5 gold each.  It cost a lot more this<br/>
way..but since my wife is a tailor I didn&#39;t have much use for the money at<br/>
the time.<br/>

&gt;Hello All,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am brand new to the list and just about to start smithing. I currently<br/>
&gt;have 20 points invested and some platinum saved up. I was wondering what<br/>
&gt;cities have ore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
