&gt;Subject: New to the trade...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello all.  I&#39;m new to the trade of smithing and would like some info on<br/>
&gt;what to sell the pieces for.  I&#39;ve seen some radically different prices and<br/>
&gt;would like a general concensus of going rates.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I&#39;ve heard that you can now forge weapons.  What skill is needed for<br/>
&gt;them and what supplies?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you for your time,<br/>

1pp per AC is fine if you&#39;re a master or in an area with high competition, <br/>
but you&#39;ll never cover your expenses at that price when you&#39;re still <br/>
learning. I suggest you visit the Queynos/Halas areas, on my server at least <br/>
there are the fewest number of armorers and of course no easy access to <br/>
bronze armor (Faydark is NOTORIOUS for having the poorest prices for banded <br/>
of any zone because of easy access to bronze!).<br/>
