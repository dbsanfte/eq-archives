&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Everyone notice how last night all the other skills got some changes <br/>
 </span></blockquote>EXCEPT blacksmithing.  Oh well.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Any how.  I have a feeling blacksmithing is broke.  My skill is 126 or <br/>
 </span></blockquote>somewhere near there.  I can make all items with &gt; only a few failures.  (I <br/>
hate legs though, seem to fail a lot.) I have made well over 100 pieces of <br/>
armor over the past<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; couple of weeks, and have not seen a single point of skill increase.  I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>didn&#39;t have any problem getting skill up to 126<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; making all the standard stuff, then I start making armor, and I get <br/>
 </span></blockquote>nothing.  My Int is about average 86.  I&#39;m thinking<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that getting skill from making armor is broke.  Has anyone else seen this?  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Also, I know some armor items are trivial,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and I know I&#39;m not making a ton of trivial armor items.  I&#39;ve made plenty <br/>
 </span></blockquote>of legs, mails, cloaks, mantles, etc.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Any insight you folks can provide would be great.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Also, why aren&#39;t there banded gloves.  I have people asking me for these <br/>
 </span></blockquote>all the time.  Let&#39;s get those /feedback /bugs going and get some changes to <br/>
blacksmithing in the works.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My Int is about average 86.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Below average for learning trade skills well. Mine is 138 and pitifully <br/>
low, but passable with loads of coin behind it. Get more INT to see more <br/>
increases.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m thinking that getting skill from making armor is broke.  Has anyone <br/>
 </span></blockquote>else seen this?<br/>
   Nope. In the few (12) pieces I&#39;ve done in the recent week, I&#39;ve gone from <br/>
125 to 128. I haven&#39;t seen much of a market for banded any longer with the <br/>
loads of twinked characters and spare cash laying around for bronze, plate, <br/>
and rubi, so stopped practicing for skill completely. The ONLY raises I get <br/>
now are from making, or not making, armor pieces.</div>
