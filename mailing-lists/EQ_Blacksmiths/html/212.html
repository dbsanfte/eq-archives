<div id="ygrps-yiv-467176288">the camping problem is directly related to twinkers.  when someone is camping an item, they get their item and should move on....but they don&#39;t....they continue to camp to get more items to twink their guild buddies, or to twink their other characters.....mean while I can&#39;t get the item due to their twinking.....direct relationship there.<br/>
<br/>
The people who deserve the items are the ones that are willing to get them with the character that is going to use them......ie no camping rubicite with your 40th lvl wizard to give to your 5th lvl warrior<br/>
<br/>
greedy bastards all over the place, ruining the game for everyone simply so they can twink out their newbie characters or friends, blah<br/>

What&#39;s crazy about level 5 in rubicite? It&#39;s odd, even frustrating, but<br/>
so what? You haven&#39;t answered my question; merely given another example<br/>
of it. Now the camping situation is something entirely different... and<br/>
not directly related to twinking. Do you think that if they weren&#39;t<br/>
twinking they&#39;d move on? I sure don&#39;t. I&#39;m willing to bet they&#39;d just<br/>
camp then sell the things. Actually, I&#39;d prefer to see someone camping<br/>
for the sole purpose of giving &#39;em away. After all, that just means that<br/>
whoever they&#39;re giving them to will have no reason to camp there. And<br/>
how do you determine who &#39;deserves&#39; the items? I think you&#39;re speaking<br/>
on a level of personal frustration... which is completely<br/>
understandable, but difficult to defend logically. <br/>
<br/>
In any case, here&#39;s to few campers, great loot drops and wildly<br/>
efficient xp.<br/>

&gt; depends on what is being twinked.....a lvl 5 in full rubicite is crazy.  Not only that, but people who twink out their other characters like this are the people who FARM items.  They camp until they get their item, which I don&#39;t have a problem with, then they continue to camp camp camp camp camp to get crap for their guild buddies and for their lower lvl characters, depriving the people who DESERVE the items the chance to get them....and thats where I have a problem with twinking.<br/>
