<div id="ygrps-yiv-908304749">Both skewers and scalers can be found in East Freeport.  They are in a store<br/>
right around the corner from the armor shop.  I think it is called the<br/>
travelers something.  There are two doors.  One has two people inside and<br/>
the other has a woman.  The woman has all the molds you need to practice<br/>
with.  As for the second question.  There are no skill caps on trade skills.<br/>
I am level 14 and have an 86 is blacksmithing right now.  If you have the<br/>
cash you can learn as long as you want.<br/>
