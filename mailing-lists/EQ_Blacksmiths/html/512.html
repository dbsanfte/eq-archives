<b>Subject:</b> Banded Armor Purchase <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243168478">I am trying to advoid spamming list(s) because I know this isn&#39;t the place.<br/>
Plus the other list doesn&#39;t seem to have any smiths on Tarew Marr.<br/>
<br/>
Looking to buy large banded on Tarew Marr.  I want to purchase a full set<br/>
(but don&#39;t need mantle).  I currently have only 18 plat but hope to be much<br/>
higher by Sunday, and much more by the following Sunday.  I currently<br/>
running around Freeport / Itthica Swamp zones.  Also may have another banded<br/>
purchase a few weeks later for another character which would require small<br/>
banded.  I guess I need to know cost first, then I can e-mail you when I get<br/>
the plat up, and make arrangements to meet up sometime/place (prefer<br/>
Freeport or Itthica Swamp area) to make the trade.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can help me you can e-mail me directly to keep the noise down on<br/>
the list, or you can make the conversation public in hopes of a few more<br/>
sales.<br/>
<br/>

Oh, if your full suit price is 100plat and you are the only one to respond,<br/>
and willing to meet me (once I get the plat) well guess that is what it will<br/>
cost me.</div>
