<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985429696">Sounds like a good IDEA. And, I wouldn&#39;t want them to spend any time on it.<br/>
I don&#39;t like the idea, personally. Last thing I wanna go spend my hard<br/>
earned plat on is replacing my tunic. And, i&#39;s the last thing I&#39;d like to<br/>
see Verant spending time coding on. It is an idea tho...<br/>

I was reading an email from someone that compared the EQ market to the US<br/>
market.  They stated that one reason they are different is because in RL<br/>
things wear out and in EQ they are eternal.  This is so true.  Has anyone<br/>
thought of or actually talked to Verant about having armor wear out?  This<br/>
would cause buyers to go to smiths for repairs or replacements.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know if this seems like a good idea or not.  I think it does.  Let me know<br/>
what you all think of this idea.<br/>
