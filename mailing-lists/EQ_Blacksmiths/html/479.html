<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356927093">As I am a master potter as well as a master smith, I am on both trade skill<br/>
lists.  Anyhow, there is a large buzz going on in the pottery list that I<br/>
would like to share with all the other smiths out there!<br/>
<br/>
In the OoT (I do not know where yet), there is a merchant that is selling<br/>
WEAPON SKETCHES!  I believe that these sketches and proper ingredients, when<br/>
propery formed at the wheel and burned at the kiln, form weapon molds!<br/>
FINALLY!  Maybe soon we will be selling weapons alongside our banded armor!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else has any info, please share it.  Thanks all!<br/>
