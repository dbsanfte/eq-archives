&gt;Not webupdate list. I have to agree with that one dude. I just care about <br/>
&gt;blacksmithing on this list. And if the owner of the site has to stoop so low <br/>
&gt;as to send out his site to a whole ton of people just to get people to come <br/>
&gt;to their site, that is sad. Why don&#39;t you send it to EQ_Rangers, they have <br/>
&gt;100s of people on that list. Just stick to blacksmithing and this world will <br/>
&gt;be happy.<br/>
