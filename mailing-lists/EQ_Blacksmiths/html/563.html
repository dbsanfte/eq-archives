<b>Subject:</b> Smiths of Norrath posted new prices <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649312440">For those of us in the Smith&#39;s Union (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~sblack9/Blacksmiths.htm)">http://home.earthlink.net/~sblack9/Blacksmiths.htm)</a>, Sorcia Blade has posted updated prices for banded armor. Most importantly, the new prices are ranged to allow flexibility in pricing. Very important to have depending on where you are smithing!<br/>
<br/>
Also, for those interested: the banded molds in Queynos Hills are where they should be again. Apparently Verant had moved them as part of their little Halloween undead-fest.<br/>
