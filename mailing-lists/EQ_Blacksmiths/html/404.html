<b>Subject:</b> Re: Creating Magical Armor and Weapons <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432903121">In the book it says that in order for a weapon or armor to retain any<br/>
magical effect the ore must be enchated. Why shouldn&#39;t Enchaters get<br/>
the enchant ore spell?  It might make us a little more respected in the<br/>
game.  If you were able to get enchanted ore for free then you should<br/>
have to buy it from NPC merchants.  Why should you get as a looted item<br/>
from a creature you kill?  We would have to buy the spell, you should<br/>
have to buy the ore.  As for your components idea, its the same thing<br/>
with jewelry, diffrent gems have diffrent effects, but the metal MUST<br/>
be enchanted to bring the properties from their dormant state.  An<br/>
abiltity like this would make others see us as useful.  I have 2<br/>
characters a DE Warrior and a DE Enchanter.  As the warrior I have no<br/>
problem with groping (get asked all the time).  When Im an enchanter I<br/>
rarely get asked and when I do its by people who do not know what class<br/>
I am, and then the offer is recinded when they figure out that I am an<br/>
Enchanter.  I have had people people ask what class I was and then just<br/>
stop talking to me when they found out what class I actully was<br/>
(originally thaught I was a Cleric).  All of our buffing spells are<br/>
also used by other classes (Clerics, Shamans, Druids.) The only thing<br/>
that makes us unique is our ability to make things magical. All classes<br/>
should have something unique to only them. <br/>
<br/>
Warriors - superior strength<br/>
Wizards - superior magic<br/>
Magicians - ability to use the power of the elements<br/>
Necromancers - power over the undead<br/>
Druids - power over nature<br/>
Rangers - best archers<br/>
Clerics - best healers<br/>
etc <br/>
<br/>
Enchanters should be the ones to enchant any item...<br/>
but of course this is IMHO.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here is my 2 cents worth on this subject.  I say no<br/>
&gt; to enchanters being able<br/>
&gt; to enchant ore for us.  I agree that the enchanters<br/>
&gt; would become the best<br/>
&gt; class to make magical items.  Let them do what they<br/>
&gt; do best and make pretty<br/>
&gt; jewelry for us to wear.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How can we make magical weapons and armor?  I like<br/>
&gt; the idea of the mold.<br/>
&gt; Also maybe introduce special ore that can be used to<br/>
&gt; make enchanted weapons<br/>
&gt; and armor.  Of course this ore would have to be<br/>
&gt; dropped by creatures and not<br/>
&gt; bought from NPC&#39;s.  Or maybe combine different<br/>
&gt; ingredients into the ore like<br/>
&gt; snakeskin for poison resistance, lightstones to give<br/>
&gt; of light radius.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; use a combination of all the above to make unique or<br/>
&gt; lore items, like a<br/>
&gt; special mold, magical ore, snakefang, and a<br/>
&gt; lightstone to make a special<br/>
&gt; sword that causes poison and gives off a lightradius<br/>
&gt; of a lightstone.<br/>
