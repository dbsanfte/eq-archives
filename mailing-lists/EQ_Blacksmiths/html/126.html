<div id="ygrps-yiv-246996562">I&#39;m on Fennin ro, and have checked out prices (been about a week and a half)<br/>
from Qeynos to Freeport. I&#39;ve seen many of the prices you listed, but those<br/>
would be the best end prices...<br/>
<br/>
Bracers for 8-10 is accurate.<br/>
Tunic and cloak for 20 is accurate<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen legs go for less than 20pp.<br/>
Most everything else I&#39;ve bought for 12-15pp.<br/>
<br/>
And, It&#39;s been a week and a half and I don&#39;t check out prices anymore. I<br/>
bought all my stuff from the people who had it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
QUESTION: I&#39;ve heard Medium banded is lighter than Large banded. I&#39;m a<br/>
barbarian warrior, and someone told me I needed large so I bought some large<br/>
stuff (bracers, helm, mantle, boots, etc). Then I got a medium tunic and<br/>
legs. Still need to get a cloak and mask. <br/>
<br/>
Problem is, I can&#39;t carry squat now... With the basic essentials (armor, two<br/>
mino axes, and 3 backpacks plus food), I&#39;m at like 80/119 weight. Wondering<br/>
if I changed my large banded over to medium banded if it would be worth it.<br/>
And, can Barbarians wear anything large and anything medium? Someone told me<br/>
they can wear SOME medium stuff, but all large worked. Seems stupid to me,<br/>
but I&#39;m not sure anymore...<br/>

&gt; Hail and well met lads.  I made a separate character to purchase water and<br/>
&gt; molds in East Freeport.  I&#39;d just like to say that a dark elf with 134<br/>
&gt; intelligence makes a very good and cost effective smith.  I&#39;ve spent maybe<br/>
&gt; at the MOST 80 pp in getting to 100 skill.  I spent 15 practice points<br/>
right<br/>
&gt; off and then sharpened until trivial.  Then scalers until 41 trivial and<br/>
now<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m still making skewers even at 100 skill.  I&#39;m wondering how far skewers<br/>
&gt; will advance you?  And also what skill level would give you about 50%<br/>
&gt; success rate making tunic, legs, helm<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On another note on the E&#39;ci server there&#39;s a group of merchants selling<br/>
&gt; banded tunics for as low as 15 pp ... this destroys mine and every other<br/>
&gt; smith of the server&#39;s hard work.  They&#39;re selling sleeves for 8 pp for<br/>
gods<br/>
&gt; sake!  People level 10 were not meant to afford a full suit of banded mail<br/>
&gt; and these smiths run a fairly large operation I&#39;m told by fellow smiths<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; they number into the 30&#39;s and are a blacksmithing guild.  What is there<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; can be done?  Anything?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; On Bertoxxulous, we run a similar guild (we have tailors, jewelsmiths,<br/>
&gt; potters, everything).  However, we don&#39;t charge insanely low prices (they<br/>
&gt; must operate on sheer volume), and so we make a sizable profit and can<br/>
&gt; afford bronze mail or dual combines, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have you tried asking them why they price everything so low?<br/>
