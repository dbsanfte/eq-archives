<br/>
  This is going to sound like a really odd question, but I&#39;m very curious as <br/>
to what the attitudes and opinions are of other blacksmiths in the game. I <br/>
play on Innoruuk server, and just recently got my blacksmithing skill up to <br/>
104. I was contacted by a potential customer who inquired about my prices <br/>
for a banded tunic. I replied, but it took him several minutes to respond. I <br/>
assume that he was negotiating with other blacksmiths, because he messaged <br/>
me a few minutes later to tell me I had good prices and that he would buy <br/>
one. I made the transaction, but was then contacted by another blacksmith <br/>
who seemed outraged that I sold my wares for so cheap. Because he knew of <br/>
the exact price, I assume that the seller had also been speaking to him and <br/>
that the price was discussed. So apparently, this blacksmith felt that I had <br/>
undercut him out of a commission. He then told me that the prices were fixed <br/>
among master blacksmiths, at roughly one half chain. When I asked who else <br/>
was using these prices, I was told everyone but given no specific examples <br/>
of well-known blacksmiths who agreed to this price-fixing.<br/>
<br/>
   I dont necessarily disagree with setting prices. A lot of money goes into <br/>
getting skill up; much more than simply buying a full suit of banded (am I <br/>
the only smith who started wearing banded well after many other people of <br/>
similiar level?), as well as the cost of failures, which I still have quite <br/>
a few of and which eat up profit rather quickly. But I don&#39;t want to be <br/>
overcharging for these items and losing customers to people who obvioulsy <br/>
have a much better clue than I do.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
