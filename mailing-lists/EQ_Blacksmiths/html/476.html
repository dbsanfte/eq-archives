<b>Subject:</b> Cost to Master <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-374631032">I&#39;m a closet blacksmith wanna-be.  I have mastered <br/>
fletching (because I&#39;m a ranger and it seemed<br/>
like a good idea at the time) and found it to be<br/>
non-profitable.  I mastered pottery (because I&#39;m<br/>
greedy) but they&#39;ve made it so it&#39;s not profitable.<br/>
Because of my pottery history, money is not too big<br/>
of an issue, so I&#39;m looking for another trade to<br/>
master - that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.<br/>
<br/>
How much does it cost to develop smithing to the <br/>
point that it becomes profitable?  I realize I need <br/>
a definition here, but let me just ask for a feeling<br/>
of the skill level where the cash inflow is positive, <br/>
and an estimate of the cash outlay to get there.<br/>
<br/>
I am a wood-elf (and perpetually encumberred) that<br/>
is normally in Kelethin.  I know (think) Steamfont<br/>
is the closest place for ore and that&#39;s a long run - <br/>
should I relocate?  Ak-Anon is out.  Those guys really<br/>
hate me there.  How about Kaladim?  Somewhere else?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read most of the guides on the web, and some<br/>
of them seem out of date. Can you suggest any?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.  BTW can I interest you in a good<br/>
bow, or perhaps a pot . . . maybe a mixing bowl?</div>
