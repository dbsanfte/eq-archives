<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748614025"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;ve subscribed to this list to learn more about smithing not to collude with<br/>
&gt;all the other smiths in the game in an attempt to &quot;profit&quot; from customers by<br/>
&gt;setting arbitrary prices.  I myself am from the United States  where our<br/>
&gt;economy is capitalism.  We reject the ideas of collusion and oligopolies<br/>
&gt;because we believe that the one who builds the better mousetrap will win<br/>
 </span></blockquote>out. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;EQ is showing us that as we saturate it with more and more smiths the prices<br/>
&gt;will be driven down due to increased supply.  I  read an email earlier about<br/>
&gt;someone who diversified himself and mastered other skills to sell items in<br/>
&gt;addition to his armor.  I apologize that I forgot your name,  and I&#39;ve<br/>
 </span></blockquote>already<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;deleted the email,  but you are the one who will succeed because you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;accepting the price war of armor and offering more to the customer.  If you<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t learn to offer more to the customer you will be priced out of the<br/>
&gt;market.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Ok there is something your missing here: fair play.<br/>
<br/>
	Nobody is &quot;colluding&quot; or trying to monopolize any industry here. REMEMBER<br/>
that EQ&#39;s ECONOMY IS BROKEN. Therefore the standard rules of economy DO NOT<br/>
APPLY.<br/>
<br/>
	What we are trying to do is make smithing profitable so that people are<br/>
willing to do it. When the game first started, EVERYONE did smithing. When<br/>
people started selling at 1gp above cost, 90% of those people quit. Now you<br/>
cannot find very many smiths at all (in fact, in the last week of play I<br/>
have found 2 stretching from Qeynos, to Freeport, to Kelethin - on E&#39;ci).<br/>
<br/>
	If we can settle on a base price (which the economy SHOULD be doing for<br/>
us, but is NOT doing), then we can make it profitable enough to do some<br/>
smithing. If not...well then you will still have the majority of people not<br/>
smithing, and a few who DO smith and corner the market.<br/>
<br/>
	You choose.<br/>
