<div id="ygrps-yiv-651423097">Is there a place to buy ore in Steamfont (or is it Steamfront?) or Butcherblock?  I&#39;m a level 8 Ranger Wood-Elf (a LONE ranger) interested in smithing.  Are either of these zones relatively safe for me?  One more question as long as I&#39;m here, is there a forge in Kelethin?  Thanks in advance.</div>
