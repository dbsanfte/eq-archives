<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-258851244">I have noticed another change involving files.  I have a regular customer<br/>
that purchases studs from me (hopefully will be moving up to steel boning<br/>
soon) and I only need one file now.  I haven&#39;t failed a stud in a very long<br/>
time so I don&#39;t know what happens if you do, but if you succeed you get a<br/>
stud and your file back!  Ok, so it&#39;s not a biggie, but it is nice only<br/>
having to make 30 metal bits instead of 40 now for 10 studs.  I keep the<br/>
same file and reuse it.<br/>
