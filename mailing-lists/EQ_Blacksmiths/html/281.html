<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527360785">Sorry for the bad quoting, but the way you formatted the original text<br/>
messes up my mail client in replies.  :)  Nevertheless...<br/>

&gt;Hello fellow smiths.    Here is my list so far:<br/>

Windmills in Steamfont <br/>

&gt;Somewhere in Highpass Hold (details requested here) <br/>

it&#39;s on the wall opposite the way you&#39;ll be facing, but it&#39;s on the other<br/>
end of the room.  Follow the path of archways with no doors (you don&#39;t have<br/>
to click on anything.)  You&#39;ll go down a ramp, and around one corner is the<br/>
bank, and the other corner is the ore vendor.  This makes more sense when<br/>
you&#39;re there than when reading what I&#39;m typing.<br/>

road south, past the &quot;evil&quot; guard tower, there is a barbarian fishing<br/>
village thing.  A guy there sells them.<br/>
<br/>
Sheet Metal <br/>
Mold vendor in Kelethin <br/>

This is an important resource for smiths, I<br/>
