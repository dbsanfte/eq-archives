<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-218280127">it seems that from skill 25 to skill 40 scalars are a good skill gain item, <br/>
from 41 to prob mid 50&#39;s lantern casings seem to be providing better results <br/>
than skewers according to my source...<br/>
<br/>
also rumors are floating around that a PC smith who refuses to divulge his <br/>
secret has discovered how to make Plate Armor of some kind</div>
