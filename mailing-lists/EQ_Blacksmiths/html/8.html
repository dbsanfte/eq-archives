<div id="ygrps-yiv-390837278">Hi, I&#39;m new to blacksmithing (low twenties) and was thinking that it would be cool if you could post the &quot;trivial caps&quot; for the skill, ie. when trying to make something brings the message &quot;trivial for someone of your skill to faashoin...&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I only tried my skill at sharpening weapons and I have pretty good results, but it&#39;s not trivial yet (22 I guess).<br/>
