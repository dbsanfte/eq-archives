People will say that this would give people an uneasy feeling knowing<br/>
that they have to give their armor to a smith to<br/>
have it repaired.<br/>

YES! brilliant thought.  So finally that adds another element to it.<br/>
Smiths can gain a reputation for both their skill at smithing and their<br/>
trustworthiness.  You will get repeat customers because you treat them<br/>
right.  That makes it far more relevant for anyone alro roleplaying the<br/>
apprenticeship ideal, through a guild or not, where the student as part<br/>
of the master&#39;s house gains standing and gets the business too.<br/>
