<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888327717">There is one little fact that everyone is overlooking...<br/>
<br/>
There can be no monopoly because anyone who is willing to invest some time<br/>
and money can learn this skill.<br/>
<br/>
Sicne we can&#39;t control who gets pieces of ore or sketches, we really have no<br/>
power, in so far as monopolies are concerned.<br/>
<br/>
I say raise prices and anyone who doesn&#39;t want to pay can make their own.<br/>

I&#39;m american. That doesn&#39;t make me against this price war :) Laws were<br/>
established against<br/>
collusion and monopolies to prevent the abuse of the abilities they granted.<br/>
It was proven<br/>
that people who practiced either concept would abuse the ability (i.e. JD<br/>
Rockefeller and<br/>
Standard Oil). There is no law in EQ saying we can&#39;t practice these concepts<br/>
or even one<br/>
saying we can&#39;t abuse them. We could be jerks and charge just as much as<br/>
chain. If we all<br/>
agree to it, they have no choice do they?</div>
