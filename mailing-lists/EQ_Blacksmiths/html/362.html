<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680654154">I&#39;m american. That doesn&#39;t make me against this price war :) Laws were established against<br/>
collusion and monopolies to prevent the abuse of the abilities they granted. It was proven<br/>
that people who practiced either concept would abuse the ability (i.e. JD Rockefeller and<br/>
Standard Oil). There is no law in EQ saying we can&#39;t practice these concepts or even one<br/>
saying we can&#39;t abuse them. We could be jerks and charge just as much as chain. If we all<br/>
agree to it, they have no choice do they? Not if they want banded anyway. I don&#39;t want to<br/>
abuse this, though, I just want the prices to be fair to me. Somebody said on this list that<br/>
EQ has a very low bottom for their economy. People don&#39;t really pay for their losses, or<br/>
collect for their gains for that matter, in anything besides game money. If someone&#39;s<br/>
character bottoms out, they can always go hunt for 10 plat and resume their smithing. In RL,<br/>
if you hit the bottom, it isn&#39;t that easy to bounce back. That&#39;s what scares people into not<br/>
going TOO low on their prices. EQ doesn&#39;t have that, people will sell at a loss or to break<br/>
even simply because they want to be nice to people who can&#39;t afford the better armor. Lots of<br/>
the higher levels can even AFFORD to do that! With that in mind, participating in a price war<br/>
will only ruin smithing. People are almost getting it for cost right now if you include<br/>
failures. Before I inflated my prices it took me an hour to earn 15 plat. That&#39;s ridiculous,<br/>
I&#39;d rather spend that hour at a brew barrel and make the same amount. I&#39;m not lowering my<br/>
prices, people are going to pay me what I deserve for making this armor, and I suggest you all<br/>
set the same standard. Why compete with ourselves? Competition is healthy, but too much is<br/>
not. Businesses go under because of price wars. Since the &#39;low price&#39; is selling for no profit<br/>
whatsoever, there is nothing to be gained by &quot;winning&quot; the price war and putting other smiths<br/>
out of their trade. It&#39;ll only ruin the opportunity we have.<br/>
<br/>
We have 2 people now on this list who don&#39;t want to raise prices, and we have an uncounted<br/>
amount of people who DO want to raise them. Let&#39;s raise them and make this worth our while :)<br/>
<br/>
As for offering more to the customer, Peter, I&#39;m a master smith, baker, brewer, and potter.<br/>
I&#39;m average at tailoring and jewelcraft. I am in a guild with people who have mastered the<br/>
trades I have not, and I supply merchandise that players cannot make, but must find or buy.<br/>
I&#39;ve also been known to teach languages and offer my guide services (and if the distance is<br/>
short, guiding is free). In general, people I talk to on my server like me, but that doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean they will pay me money for it. They only buy my products. Only 3 times have I ever had a<br/>
compliment on my friendliness or customer service no matter how excellent it is. Just goes to<br/>
show you that Norrath isn&#39;t your idealistic United States.<br/>

&gt;         Lets take a good store: say Wal Mart.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         If someone steals something, do they raise their prices? Yes. If their<br/>
&gt; store has items that are not sold very often, do they raise the price of<br/>
&gt; more commonly sold items to compensate? Yes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Now, having said that, lets look at another phenomena.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         I go to college and learn programming. Joe, he goes to school and doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get more than his High School Diploma. Who makes more money? Who&#39;s skill is<br/>
&gt; more valuable?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Now granted I don&#39;t march out and say &quot;hey I want $50,000 up front because<br/>
&gt; that is what my schooling cost! But you would assume that over the next 3,<br/>
&gt; 5, or 10 years you&#39;d more than exceed that price (of schooling/training) in<br/>
&gt; your quality of living and/or straight income.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         The problem with EQ is that the economy&#39;s &quot;bottom&quot; is VERY LOW. In fact it<br/>
&gt; is CRITICALLY low. Most trade items cannot be sold to NPCs for even equal<br/>
&gt; to what it cost to make them (materials only). As a result, the player has<br/>
&gt; no reason to sell lower and lower, as he knows if he makes more than the<br/>
&gt; NPC gives him he&#39;s not totally losing out. Of course granted I&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt; nobody sell for less than materials, but there is no given &quot;skill&quot; cost<br/>
&gt; because the bottom is so low.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         If it wasn&#39;t for the fact that the word &quot;economy&quot; is only about how much<br/>
&gt; money is in the &quot;pool&quot; at any given time, vs. goods measured against money<br/>
&gt; in that pool (ie. the economy is non-existent), then EQ&#39;s economy would<br/>
&gt; crash horribly and irrepairably.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         I agree with the first guy. The only way to ensure a decent profitability<br/>
&gt; in any amount of time measured less than months is to try and fix the prices.<br/>

&gt; ----------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve subscribed to this list to learn more about smithing not to collude with<br/>
&gt; all the other smiths in the game in an attempt to &quot;profit&quot; from customers by<br/>
&gt; setting arbitrary prices.  I myself am from the United States  where our<br/>
&gt; economy is capitalism.  We reject the ideas of collusion and oligopolies<br/>
&gt; because we believe that the one who builds the better mousetrap will win out.<br/>
&gt; EQ is showing us that as we saturate it with more and more smiths the prices<br/>
&gt; will be driven down due to increased supply.  I  read an email earlier about<br/>
&gt; someone who diversified himself and mastered other skills to sell items in<br/>
&gt; addition to his armor.  I apologize that I forgot your name,  and I&#39;ve already<br/>
&gt; deleted the email,  but you are the one who will succeed because you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; accepting the price war of armor and offering more to the customer.  If you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t learn to offer more to the customer you will be priced out of the<br/>
&gt; market.<br/>
