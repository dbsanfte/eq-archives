<b>Subject:</b> Looking for Banded in Neriak/Freeport area - Tarew Marr server <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977411182">Well, guess the subject says it all.  I am looking to purchase banded (I<br/>
think 11 pcs for a full suit).  I guess the other question is how much?  I<br/>
will admit I don&#39;t have the money right now but thought I should find the<br/>
supplier now.  Tunic will most likely be the first thing I purchase (if I<br/>
don&#39;t do the purchase in one bulk purchase, in this case it will be a<br/>
while).  Size small (Dark Elf).<br/>
<br/>
Wasn&#39;t sure where else to post this.<br/>
