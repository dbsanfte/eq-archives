&gt; One thing everybody must learn, prices can ALWAYS go down and NEVER go up. Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; take never literally, though. We need to raise prices on banded. 7 for gorgets,<br/>
&gt; 8 for bracers, 11 for masks, 13 for helmets, 12 for sleeves, 12 for mantle, 20<br/>
&gt; for mail, 20 for cloak, 12 for belt, 19 for leggings, 11 for boots. These prices<br/>
&gt; give us significant profit on 100% success and help even out the profits for<br/>
&gt; when we fail. If ALL of us sell at these prices and stick to them (don&#39;t let<br/>
&gt; them drop you more than a plat), then the &#39;low priced&#39; banded sellers will be<br/>
&gt; very scarce indeed. Then you can see the &#39;wait an hour&#39; frustration on the<br/>
&gt; buyers end. If someone auctions they are willing to pay 5 plat for a banded<br/>
&gt; bracer for over an hour, they&#39;ll be frustrated enough to give up and pay the<br/>
&gt; damn 8 plat. If we have a set price that majority follows, then we will still<br/>
&gt; sell. While the discount smith might sell 10 gorgets at 2 and a half plat profit<br/>
&gt; each, we&#39;ll sell at LEAST 5 gorgets in the same amount of time for 5 and a half<br/>
&gt; plat profit each. They might be making 25 plat, but we&#39;re making 27.5 and have<br/>
&gt; less chances for a failure :) If we group together and work as one group of<br/>
&gt; dedicated smiths, we can only win. If we become bitter enemies over who has the<br/>
&gt; lowest price, the price war will just destroy us all. We will ruin the value of<br/>
&gt; smithing. NO MORE DISCOUNTS!!! :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry.. are you a moron?  Your plan won&#39;t work for shit.  You keep<br/>
your prices at what they are..  i will sell cheaper.. everyone will keep<br/>
coming to me.. i&#39;ll get plenty of practice and my smithing will continue<br/>
to raise.. and I&#39;ll make all the money while you sit all alone with your<br/>
overpriced shit.  People do NOT pay for failures.  They pay for the<br/>
product.  As a smith, you are supposed to supply people with a product. <br/>
You don&#39;t supply them with your failures.  Smithing is a profitable<br/>
business.. yes.  But it&#39;s the greedy assholes like you who try to make<br/>
other people pay for your lack of skill who ruin the trade.  Pay for<br/>
your own mistakes.</div>
