<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754348368">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
My first post. Here&#39;s a couple things that have worked well for me in the Qeynos area of the Bristlebain server.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I see a new smith auctioning his wares in my area, I start up a conversation and do a price check, let him know how much he can get selling in my area. Wish him luck. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing that&#39;s worked well for me, and I hate to give this trick away, but it helps so much with the price fixing, what&#39;s good for all is good for me, and all that. So here goes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve a couple buddies who I&#39;ve enlisted as resellers for me. I sell to them at a 30% discount off my regular prices. They resell at my current full price, when they sell items off, I restock them. This moves my product, these friends make money (some a whole lot of it, my girlfriend has over 300 plat in the bank at level 17, most from reselling my goods). This has the added bonus of price fixing. Say someone asks me how much for leggings, I say 20p. That&#39;s too much they say, so I tell &#39;em check around, that&#39;s the going rate. They do a couple price checks with others selling banded in that area (MY RESELLERS) and what do ya know, that IS the going rate, yes, they did I price check with me, indirectly, but they don&#39;t know that. Other smiths see you and your resellers all selling for the same amount, they&#39;ll bump their prices.<br/>
<br/>
Strength in numbers. A group of three or four all agreeing on a price (those three or four include you and your resellers), have a much easier time convincing the new smith in town that these are the going rates, than just one snotty blacksmith trying to get you to up your rates.<br/>
<br/>
This works folks, give it a try.<br/>
