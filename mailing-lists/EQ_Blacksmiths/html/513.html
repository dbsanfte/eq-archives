&gt;  Find some ore, and make some metal bits.  Say four stacks worth, as you<br/>
will fail a few times making these.  Make some scalers with the bits, then<br/>
make more bits.  Once bits become trivial, make a full backpack or two of<br/>
them.  This is major carpal tunnel syndrom time, but it&#39;s necessary to do.<br/>
Keep making scalers until trivial.  Move on to lanterns, they cost a little<br/>
more, but you fail a lot less, and don&#39;t lose much money.  Scalers are last<br/>
until your skill hits 115, then you can try pots to 125(?) then sewing kits.<br/>
Although I found that pots and sewing kits don&#39;t give you very much skill.<br/>
Once you hit 125 in skill just sell all armor.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Greeting<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;i play a barbarian shaman lvl 15<br/>
&gt; &gt;my int is 61 and my char 88<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;i have recently started blacksmithing and there is my 2 cent.<br/>
&gt; &gt;first i have only put 3 point in my skill.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I have started by sharpening weapon and surprise ! unlike its<br/>
&gt; &gt;always say in the different guide you find about this skill : when<br/>
&gt; &gt;you lacked the skill you don t loose both the weapon and the<br/>
&gt; &gt;sharpening stone but only the sharpening stone.  cost of one<br/>
&gt; &gt;sharpening stone 3 copper :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;may be its recent patch that have change that ?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I also know that it will take you many time to get enought rusty<br/>
&gt; &gt;weapon to increase your skill. Well if you check the vendor near<br/>
&gt; &gt;you , you will probably find many rusty weapon to sell.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Start with the cheapest one: rusty dagger and rusty axe (price<br/>
&gt; &gt;around 6 silver). when you sell them back to the vendor you will<br/>
&gt; &gt;loose around ... hum, five copper ? And those become trivial at 21<br/>
&gt; &gt;skill. : )<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;then use rusty mace until 24.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Then use rusty long sword until 26<br/>
&gt; &gt;then use rusty two handed sword until  ... don &#39;t find enought to<br/>
&gt; &gt;know when they become trivial. believe its 27<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sure you will loose more money as the price of the weapon<br/>
&gt; &gt;increase. up to five silver for each weapon and little more later ...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I have bring my skill to 26 like this, using very few plate.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Now here are some question.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Can anyone give me the cheapest way to increase my skill now?<br/>
&gt; &gt;Is it possible to make small brick of ore starting with small piece of<br/>
&gt; &gt;ore ?<br/>
&gt; &gt;many thanks for your help.<br/>
