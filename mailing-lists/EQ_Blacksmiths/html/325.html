<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752400959">If we&#39;re all (for the most part) in agreement for regulating prices,<br/>
let&#39;s do it! We have nothing to lose. It&#39;s either a slow and painful<br/>
death, or a quick one. I&#39;d rather get shot than suffocated, so let&#39;s go<br/>
for it.<br/>

Stick to these prices!! If you don&#39;t sell, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ve had people<br/>
who thought my old prices (cheaper than this) were too high. They&#39;ve<br/>
come back up to a month later asking, &quot;still selling banded?&quot; Rich will<br/>
buy from you, frustrated people who have been auctioning for hours will<br/>
buy from you, people who have realized the new standard prices will buy<br/>
from you! This can work, we just have to try, so let&#39;s try!!!<br/>
