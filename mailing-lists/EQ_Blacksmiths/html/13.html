<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221227172">Well, from what I understand (I&#39;m not a blacksmith, but have been<br/>
researching it a bit), you can use blacksmithing skill to get a rusty weapon<br/>
to tarnished, which will (I believe) decrease the delay, but leave the<br/>
damage alone. If your successful in trying, you get a tarnished weapon. If<br/>
you fail, you destroy the weapon. The exact procedure, I&#39;m not sure of,<br/>
sorry.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve seen a doc on blacksmithing somewhere on a board that had sharpening of<br/>
weapons in it, but I can&#39;t find it at the moment. Anyone know where that is?<br/>

Subject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Sharpening ... Stone<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK, basic question I know, but I have to ask anyway.  I have a rusted sword,<br/>
how do I get it to good quality again?  I would think a sharpening stone.  I<br/>
guess the question is how do you make a sharpenting stone, or do you obtain<br/>
it some place and then how do you apply it?  I found the guy I can purchase<br/>
ore from and can get a flask of water.  I haven&#39;t even opened up<br/>
blacksmithing yet (will this evening).  Can any one give me a little<br/>
guidence on the best way to open this skill up other than trial and error.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for any help<br/>
 <br/>
