<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-4721994">I started smithing with 10 skill points.  I have lost 115PP 9GP, 6SP, 9CP in smithing so far (or spent this much to achieve level 84, depending on how you look at it).  This is after I&#39;ve sold my finished products.  My average &quot;loss&quot; per level, from 10 to 84, was: 1PP, 5GP, 6SP, 7CP.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent countless hours standing at a forge.  I didn&#39;t put a price on that, nor the 2 books I&#39;ve purchased or the 10 skill points I wasted in the beginning to get this started.  With the market flooded with cheap banded, and now bronze becoming the armor of choice, I feel that I&#39;ve gone as far as I should in this endeavor.<br/>
<br/>
Following is the breakdown of how much I spent per item.  The numbers are almost exact, if not exact.  I was careful to write down my successes and failures.  If they&#39;re off, it&#39;s probably only by a fraction, unless I miss-typed a number into my calculator.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve listed prices as 4 digits, first is PP (may be multiple digits), then GP, SP, and CP (all single digits).<br/>
Ex: 0,0,1,3 = Cost to buy water.<br/>
<br/>
Skill level 10 through 20 making metal bits<br/>
Attempts: 62<br/>
Made: 31<br/>
Failed: 31<br/>
Cost per attempt: 0,0,7,6<br/>
Total cost: 4,7,1,2<br/>
Average cost per level (10-20): 0,4,2,8<br/>
(NOTE: Selling metal bits for a loss would lower the cost here, but metal bits are needed in bulk for the next 100 or so levels.)<br/>
<br/>
Skill level 21-40 making scalers<br/>
Bits attempted: 164<br/>
Bits made: 128<br/>
Bits failed: 36<br/>
Scalers attempted: 136<br/>
Scalers made: 72<br/>
Scalers failed: 64<br/>
Total cost: 22,8,0,0<br/>
Sell LCL Molds for: 0,1,3,6<br/>
Total after selling the LCL Molds: 13,0,0,8<br/>
Cost per level (21-40): 6,5,0,4<br/>
(NOTE: Scaler molds made &quot;Large Container Lid Mold&quot; when I was at this level.  They didn&#39;t make the files until I passed this item (it became trivial)).<br/>
<br/>
Skill Level 41-50 making skewers (didn&#39;t know about lanterns yet)<br/>
Bits attempted: 225<br/>
Bits made: 206<br/>
Bits failed: 19<br/>
Skewers attempted: 184<br/>
Skewers made: 22<br/>
Skewers failed: 162<br/>
Total Cost: 37,8,9,2<br/>
Sell skewers for: 0,1,6,0<br/>
Total after selling skewers: 34,3,7,2<br/>
Cost per level (41-50): 3,4,3,7<br/>
<br/>
** Skill level 50<br/>
Attempted to make 3 gorgets.  Cost per attempt: 1,2,8,8.  All three failed.<br/>
Total cost during level 50 taking the average and adding the gorget attempts: <br/>
(3,4,3,7 + 3,8,6,4 = 7,3,0,1)<br/>
<br/>
Skill Level 51-67 making lanterns<br/>
Bits attempted: 160<br/>
Bits made: 157<br/>
Bits failed: 3<br/>
Lanterns attempted: 232<br/>
Lanterns made: 126<br/>
Lanterns failed: 106<br/>
Total Cost: 58,5,6,0<br/>
Sell lanterns for: 0,2,0,0<br/>
Total after selling lanterns: 33,3,6,0<br/>
Cost per level (51-67): 1,9,6,2<br/>
<br/>
Skill Level 68-84 making skewers (current level)<br/>
Bits attempted: 240<br/>
Bits made: 227<br/>
Bits failed: 13<br/>
Skewers attempted: 229<br/>
Skewers made: 85<br/>
Skewers failed: 144<br/>
Total Cost: 44,1,1,7<br/>
Sell skewers for: 0,1,6,0<br/>
Total after selling skewers: 30,5,1,7<br/>
Cost per level (68-84): 1,7,9,5 <br/>
<br/>
** Skill level 68<br/>
Attempted to make 2 gorgets.  Cost per attempt: 1,2,8,8.  Both failed.<br/>
Total cost during level 68 taking the average and adding the gorget attempts: <br/>
(1,7,9,5 + 2,5,7,6 = 4,3,7,1)<br/>

Subject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Cost of gaining skill points<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:fkrueger@...">fkrueger@...</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a smithing question that might first look <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; like a fletching questions, but please bear with <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; me.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To develop my fletching skill I make arrows - bows <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; are much too expensive for a failure.  Before the <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; recent change to the skills I would buy a batch <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; of raw materials from the fletching supplier and <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; tediously make arrows, frequently getting a <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; message that my skill had gone up.  I sold the <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; completed arrows back to a merchant in my guild <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to minimize the cost of gaining skill.  (The <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; market for arrows isn&#39;t so hot.)  In my most <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; recent training exercise I went from a skill of <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 69 to a skill of 74.  The outlay, after buying <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; raw materials and selling the completed arrows, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; was about 2.5 pp, or about 5g/skill point.  All <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; this was before the patch.  Note that this cost <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; is very different than using the skill points <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; you get when you gain levels, I&#39;m not talking <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; about that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fletchers complained bitterly about having to <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; make single arrows.  Verant responded with a <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; solution that sells components in batches of <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; five and produces arrows in batches of five.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The problem is, the skill level is based on the <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; number of times the fletcher hits the &quot;combine&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; key.  The tediousness of making arrows has been <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; fixed, but the price of gaining skill points has <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; been multiplied by a factor of five.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My question to you smiths is, do you know how <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; much it costs to increase your skill?  In the <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; range from 60 to 80 is it 5g/point, or <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.5pp/point?  Or is it far different than that?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I appreciate your patience in reading through <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; this.  Thank you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
