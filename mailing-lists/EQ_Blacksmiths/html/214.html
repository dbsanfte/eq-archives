<div id="ygrps-yiv-167823009">You know... On Rallos Zek this really isn&#39;t a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I had my wizard character tweeked, he had the Skull of T, Dusty Blood<br/>
Stained gloves, runed totem staff, savant cap, and about 50 plat to help him<br/>
out.  Well I made 7th level pretty easy, and all the sudden I was game for<br/>
PKs, I had to much equipment on to bag it all when I was attacked by a 11th<br/>
level Ranger (Faldor).<br/>
<br/>
Later when I thought I had gotten good and bagging stuff a new trick was<br/>
entered... Blinding.  When blinded you can&#39;t see your inventory, so again I<br/>
lost a high level item (thank you Relon)<br/>
<br/>
So I decide to put all my high level stuff where it belongs, on the high<br/>
level character who deserves it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who tweaks on the PVP server risks being that much of a sweeter<br/>
target, you will get murdered by someone 3-4 levels higher than you<br/>
everytime.  This is pretty much until high teens, then it evens out.<br/>
<br/>
So, hate tweaking? Goto a server where you can do something about it. Rallos<br/>
Zek, the only real server!<br/>

What&#39;s crazy about level 5 in rubicite? It&#39;s odd, even frustrating, but<br/>
so what? You haven&#39;t answered my question; merely given another example<br/>
of it. Now the camping situation is something entirely different... and<br/>
not directly related to twinking. Do you think that if they weren&#39;t<br/>
twinking they&#39;d move on? I sure don&#39;t. I&#39;m willing to bet they&#39;d just<br/>
camp then sell the things. Actually, I&#39;d prefer to see someone camping<br/>
for the sole purpose of giving &#39;em away. After all, that just means that<br/>
whoever they&#39;re giving them to will have no reason to camp there. And<br/>
how do you determine who &#39;deserves&#39; the items? I think you&#39;re speaking<br/>
on a level of personal frustration... which is completely<br/>
understandable, but difficult to defend logically. <br/>
<br/>
In any case, here&#39;s to few campers, great loot drops and wildly<br/>
efficient xp.<br/>

&gt; depends on what is being twinked.....a lvl 5 in full rubicite is crazy.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not only that, but people who twink out their other characters like this are<br/>
the people who FARM items.  They camp until they get their item, which I<br/>
don&#39;t have a problem with, then they continue to camp camp camp camp camp to<br/>
get crap for their guild buddies and for their lower lvl characters,<br/>
depriving the people who DESERVE the items the chance to get them....and<br/>
thats where I have a problem with twinking.<br/>
