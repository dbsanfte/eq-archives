It would make people too mad. Having a nice piece of magic armor that took <br/>
forever to get disappear because it wore out. I don&#39;t like this idea, as it <br/>
would just make EQ more like Diablo and Ultima Online, which I hope they <br/>
would want to try and stay away from.<br/>

Some other RPG&#39;s I&#39;ve played made it so that common wear items wore quicker<br/>
than others as well as making rare quest items not wear very little or not at<br/>
all since they are supposed to be considered priceless.  I think the idea of<br/>
making items wear would be a great thing for the trade.  A shield and sword<br/>
would wear quicker than say boots or leggings.  This gives smiths an<br/>
oppurtunity to increase their skills with less cost if they want to work on<br/>
repairing and improving items.<br/>
