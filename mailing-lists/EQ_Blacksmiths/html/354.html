After 175 is scaled plate, unfortunately the folded sheets are<br/>
&quot;administratively broken&quot;, meaning Verant has decided not to<br/>
let us smith them yet, so combining a block of ore and a flask<br/>
of water will yield nothing. Since nothing else will increase your<br/>
skill (banded cloaks are the last that will increase it) 175 is<br/>
currently the highest skill you can have in smithing.<br/>
<br/>
In response to someone else&#39;s question along this thread, sheets<br/>
of metal can be produced by a smith if they do not have access<br/>
to premade sheets, I believe the correct formula (as is in the<br/>
Basic Blacksmithing book, if you dinnae have this and are a<br/>
smith, I pity you) is 2 small bricks of ore and a flask of water.<br/>

&gt; Where do you get blue ore? =)<br/>
&gt; and what do you do after 175? </span></blockquote></div>
