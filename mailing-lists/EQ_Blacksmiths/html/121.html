<b>Subject:</b> A good place for smiths <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647745080">Well..  I&#39;ve been pretty quiet on this list so far and have just<br/>
observed everyone else.  Not too many people have mentioned the little<br/>
town of Rivervale.  This town really has a lot to offer.  It is a pretty<br/>
good trade town if you ask me.  You can buy small molds for<br/>
blacksmithing, it has a forge, and you can get ore off the muddites in<br/>
beholder.  I know the ore off of muddites is NOT something the lower<br/>
level people can attain easily, but that is the only drawback i see to<br/>
the town.  There are very few smiths here, so I&#39;m sure a smith with<br/>
descent skill would make a killing selling banded to all the furry<br/>
footed people.  I think Rivervale has every type of trade skill<br/>
available in it.  Potters wheel, kiln, forge, oven, and a brew thing. <br/>
Just a suggestion.  (Hopes to see a smith selling banded in the next few<br/>
days because his character would surely buy some =0)</div>
