<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213453243">Hail and well met lads.  I made a separate character to purchase water and<br/>
molds in East Freeport.  I&#39;d just like to say that a dark elf with 134<br/>
intelligence makes a very good and cost effective smith.  I&#39;ve spent maybe<br/>
at the MOST 80 pp in getting to 100 skill.  I spent 15 practice points right<br/>
off and then sharpened until trivial.  Then scalers until 41 trivial and now<br/>
I&#39;m still making skewers even at 100 skill.  I&#39;m wondering how far skewers<br/>
will advance you?  And also what skill level would give you about 50%<br/>
success rate making tunic, legs, helm<br/>
<br/>
On another note on the E&#39;ci server there&#39;s a group of merchants selling<br/>
banded tunics for as low as 15 pp ... this destroys mine and every other<br/>
smith of the server&#39;s hard work.  They&#39;re selling sleeves for 8 pp for gods<br/>
sake!  People level 10 were not meant to afford a full suit of banded mail<br/>
and these smiths run a fairly large operation I&#39;m told by fellow smiths that<br/>
they number into the 30&#39;s and are a blacksmithing guild.  What is there that<br/>
can be done?  Anything?</div>
