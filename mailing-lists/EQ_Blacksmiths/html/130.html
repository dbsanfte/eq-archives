<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010364440">In regards to my last message about the blacksmithing guild on E&#39;ci.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure why they&#39;re charging these insanely low prices.  My motto is if<br/>
you aren&#39;t going to make a good profit.... don&#39;t make it.  There is plenty<br/>
of people wanting to buy armor and you shouldn&#39;t just powersmith suits to<br/>
get to whatever skill making banded will take you.  The thing that I&#39;m told<br/>
what they&#39;re doing is they make hordes of banded tunics ... lately.... and<br/>
then sell them for 15 pp each to anyone that will buy them.  So the most<br/>
expensive piece of armor is being sold dirt cheap.  But I&#39;m starting up a<br/>
smithing consortium on that server and so far have contacted about ten<br/>
smiths to get together and charge the same rates or near them on everything.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone could tell me how I can build weapons it&#39;d be appreciated thanks.<br/>
The weapons and armor guide I bought in Neriak seems to point out only the<br/>
banded mail smithing ingredients.<br/>
<br/>
Also if there&#39;s any advanced guides or other ones that basic blacksmithing<br/>
and the armor and weapons guide I&#39;d like to know where they are thanks =)</div>
