<div id="ygrps-yiv-601861954">But in EQ you CAN be a Master Fisher, Tailor, Blacksmith, Fletcher, Jewler<br/>
and Baker with enough time and money. The argument is that Enchanters can<br/>
Master Jeweling better than any other class, and that gives them an edge on<br/>
the market. Also, their high intelligence gives them the advantage of<br/>
learning the other trade skills quickly. This combination yields a very<br/>
deadly merchant who can clean up an entire zone. I know of one Enchanter on<br/>
Tunare who, within a matter of minutes of logging on, has about 50 tells for<br/>
his goods and services.<br/>
The only thing that we non-Enchanters can do is learn multiple trades so<br/>
that we can market ourselves better. I do agree with you that we should<br/>
befriend these Enchanters. It can only help us.<br/>

&gt; Well, as a smith, you expect people to pay you for your time and skill,<br/>
&gt; correct?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That being the case, why should you not pay an enchanter for his time and<br/>
&gt; services?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why should a master fisherman be able to make armor?  Why should a master<br/>
&gt; talor be able to cook a complicated pie?  They shouldn&#39;t.  Certainly<br/>
&gt; enchanters have an advantage when it comes to making magic items, but then<br/>
&gt; again, shouldn&#39;t an enchanter have an advantage since their whole class is<br/>
&gt; based upon enchantments?  And if you people are afraid that the day will<br/>
&gt; come that you can&#39;t make magic armor because some enchanter is doing it,<br/>
&gt; you are wrong.  You will still be able to, you might have to pay an<br/>
&gt; enchanter to enchant some items for you, but you will still be able to<br/>
&gt; make it.  And if you strongly feel that they will alow smiths to make<br/>
&gt; magic armor, perhaps you should do a little adventuring and find some<br/>
&gt; enchanters to become buddies with, perhaps he will do it for a nominal<br/>
&gt; fee, or perhaps even free.<br/>

&gt; I am not trying to take anything away from enchanters, but why should all<br/>
&gt; magical items be dependent on one single class?  The same discussion is<br/>
&gt; going on in one of the tailoring lists.  If all magical items that can be<br/>
&gt; made through all skills need an enchanter to do the enchanting, enchanters<br/>
&gt; will be overworked.  Maybe enchanters need to be used in creating certain<br/>
&gt; magical items for smiths, but by no means all.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yeah forget what the book said and all that stuff.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  reread your FaQ and the &quot;official&quot; guide to EQ, magical weapons are<br/>
&gt; &gt; supposed to require the help of a high level enchanter and a master<br/>
&gt; &gt; smith, the one things we shouldn&#39;t need is to deal with a slimy little<br/>
&gt; &gt; dwarven smith or some such ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;  as for &quot;would become the best class to make magical items.&quot; well I<br/>
&gt; &gt; should hope so, its what our class does! what next? Take away damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; bonuses for str to fighters cause it might make them the best melee<br/>
&gt; &gt; class in the game? or pickpockets from rogues cause it might make them<br/>
&gt; &gt; the best rogues in the game? heh, don&#39;t mess with us enchanters or<br/>
&gt; &gt; you&#39;ll regret it<br/>
