<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773319592">Your on a different server. Yes, if I had a enchanter, I would try jewercraft <br/>
as well. I should have done it, but I didn&#39;t. Don&#39;t feel like trying to get <br/>
master smith again. Jewelcraft seems really cool. Lots of fun. Just wish I <br/>
had made an enchanter.</div>
