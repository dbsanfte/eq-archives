<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381600043">I like this idea alot.  If it became widespread, it would once and for all<br/>
shut the mouths of the assholes out there trying to tell you what you should<br/>
charge them for banded.  Lately, I&#39;ve been harassed by people saying (lying<br/>
actually) that the going rate for banded is now 1pp per AC and getting real<br/>
upset when I tell them no.  The other source of misinformation comes to<br/>
these people when they buy a banded gorget for 2-3pp from the wannabee<br/>
smiths that never get there skill much past 50 (you people on E Marr near<br/>
Freeport know who I am talking about).  There are perhaps 5 of us really<br/>
active in smithing on E Marr and I know 2 of the other people for sure.<br/>
I&#39;ll try to get in touch with them and see what they think.  The prices<br/>
esposed on the site are about 1 to 2pp higher than I charge now (5pp per<br/>
sheet needed to make an item, 15pp for cloaks).<br/>

&gt; I saw the following site promoted on EQVault:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~sblack9/Blacksmiths.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~sblack9/Blacksmiths.htm</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The author makes many good points about keeping costs in line<br/>
&gt; with the effort needed to attain the skill level. I remember an<br/>
&gt; earlier attempt at a trade guild on E&#39;ci that also promoted<br/>
&gt; &quot;price fixing&quot; but eventually failed. This site at least allows<br/>
&gt; you to &quot;find&quot; smiths on your server and place orders via email,<br/>
&gt; so no more hunting around the various zones trying to drum up business.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What do you, as fellow smiths, think of the idea? If you aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; already on board, will you sign up?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This list has been dead too long, let&#39;s stir up some discussion!<br/>
