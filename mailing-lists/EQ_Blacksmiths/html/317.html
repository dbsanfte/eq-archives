&gt;coming to me.. i&#39;ll get plenty of practice and my smithing will continue<br/>
&gt;to raise.. and I&#39;ll make all the money while you sit all alone with your<br/>
&gt;overpriced shit.  People do NOT pay for failures.  They pay for the<br/>
&gt;product.  As a smith, you are supposed to supply people with a product. <br/>
&gt;You don&#39;t supply them with your failures.  Smithing is a profitable<br/>
&gt;business.. yes.  But it&#39;s the greedy assholes like you who try to make<br/>
&gt;other people pay for your lack of skill who ruin the trade.  Pay for<br/>
&gt;your own mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Now I find this terribly annoying. <br/>
<br/>
	Lets take a good store: say Wal Mart.<br/>
<br/>
	If someone steals something, do they raise their prices? Yes. If their<br/>
store has items that are not sold very often, do they raise the price of<br/>
more commonly sold items to compensate? Yes. <br/>
<br/>
	Now, having said that, lets look at another phenomena. <br/>
<br/>
	I go to college and learn programming. Joe, he goes to school and doesn&#39;t<br/>
get more than his High School Diploma. Who makes more money? Who&#39;s skill is<br/>
more valuable?<br/>
<br/>
	Now granted I don&#39;t march out and say &quot;hey I want $50,000 up front because<br/>
that is what my schooling cost! But you would assume that over the next 3,<br/>
5, or 10 years you&#39;d more than exceed that price (of schooling/training) in<br/>
your quality of living and/or straight income.<br/>
<br/>
	The problem with EQ is that the economy&#39;s &quot;bottom&quot; is VERY LOW. In fact it<br/>
is CRITICALLY low. Most trade items cannot be sold to NPCs for even equal<br/>
to what it cost to make them (materials only). As a result, the player has<br/>
no reason to sell lower and lower, as he knows if he makes more than the<br/>
NPC gives him he&#39;s not totally losing out. Of course granted I&#39;ve seen<br/>
nobody sell for less than materials, but there is no given &quot;skill&quot; cost<br/>
because the bottom is so low.<br/>
<br/>
	If it wasn&#39;t for the fact that the word &quot;economy&quot; is only about how much<br/>
money is in the &quot;pool&quot; at any given time, vs. goods measured against money<br/>
in that pool (ie. the economy is non-existent), then EQ&#39;s economy would<br/>
crash horribly and irrepairably.<br/>
<br/>
	I agree with the first guy. The only way to ensure a decent profitability<br/>
in any amount of time measured less than months is to try and fix the prices.<br/>
