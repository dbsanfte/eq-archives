<div id="ygrps-yiv-976057440">I am aware of the location you mentioned, but she only sells SKEWER Molds<br/>
(and others) and not SCALER molds... At least not the times I have visited<br/>
her, which has been many...  Or, do these go by some other name?<br/>
<br/>
Also, thanks to everyone for explaining that there are no holds/caps on<br/>
Skill training...<br/>
<br/>
I just hope I have the plat to get up high enough!<br/>
<br/>
I put 20 practices into smithing to start, and when making &#39;bits&#39; (which no<br/>
longer increase my skill) I am only getting about a 60% success rate!  I am<br/>
currently at level 28 now, but it has cost me 30 plat to get there... Why?<br/>
because I cannot increase by making Files either, and because I cannot find<br/>
SCALER molds (supposed to be next easiest) I am forced to practice using<br/>
skewers... Of this, I have been increasing, but only made ONE out of over<br/>
40! (the very FIRST time I tried it in fact!)<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say this is very frustrating, time and money consuming... Moreso<br/>
than I would have thought... At this rate, it could end up costing me 100&#39;s<br/>
of Plat before I can make anything to sell for a Profit (per item that is),<br/>
but makes me wonder if I shouldn&#39;t just spend the plat and buy stuff for<br/>
myself and not worry about making any for sale...<br/>
