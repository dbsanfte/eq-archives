<br/>
I am a warrior of the 16th Tier and was looking to start a trade skill.<br/>
Since I am a barbarian warrior and fit the mold of what a blacksmith<br/>
&#39;usually&#39; would look like, I have a few basic questions.  First, someone<br/>
told me that for ANY trade skill, intelligence is of utmost important.  Now<br/>
I may be strong, but I am pretty simple minded (a 60 intelligence).  Should<br/>
I even start being a blacksmith with such low smarts?  How much will being<br/>
&#39;dumb&#39; affect me when trying to increase my skill?  I thought about making<br/>
another character that would be my blacksmith, but I really don&#39;t want to do<br/>
the &#39;mule&#39; thing.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I disagree. 21 is when bits become trivial. Then make scalers until 41,<br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; is when they become trivial. Then after that make skewers until 115. That<br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; when they become trivial. I tried making banded before this, and everyone <br/>
&gt; always wanted other banded items. Everyone has gorgets and bracers, they<br/>
&gt; are <br/>
&gt; the cheapest thing out there. Once 115 make all banded. You will fail a<br/>
&gt; lot <br/>
&gt; on some things. Sometimes you will have a bad spout. Failing 10 times in a<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; row at 121 skill in Legs really sucks. once your that high, just keep<br/>
&gt; making <br/>
&gt; banded. and your skill will raise.<br/>
