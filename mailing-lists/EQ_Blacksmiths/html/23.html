<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705551928">OK, next question ... are the books a requirement to learning Blacksmithing?<br/>
or do you read them and gain exp/skill for reading them at which point they<br/>
disappear(?) or you are required to hold onto them forever. I will admit I<br/>
am only lvl 7 right now so a lot of plat is out of the question but I am<br/>
trying new and different things right now.  I have gotten my swiming up to<br/>
34 (bad, I think), and working on one handed blunt (maxed one handed slash).<br/>
I really want to try new things because attacking 2 skeletons with the new<br/>
one handed blunt skill is about the only fun I am having right now.  Plus I<br/>
found a rusted dagger I can purchase cheaply that I can pratice on without<br/>
destroying my wepon I want to sharpen.<br/>

There are two books for blacksmithing, one is &quot;blacksmith&quot; something<br/>
(sorry, forgot) and the other is called &quot;weapons and armors&quot; (or very<br/>
close). Dunno which one explains it but you should buy them anyway,<br/>
they just cost over 1gp.<br/>
<br/>
If you want the answer here, you have to buy sharpening stones (not<br/>
sold everywhere) at 3 or 4cp a piece and then put the rusty weapon<br/>
and a sharpening stone in a forge (available somewhere in most<br/>
cities, ask around) and then hit combine. If you&#39;re lucky you&#39;ll get<br/>
a taarnished weapon which will be a couple delay points faster! Not<br/>
bad. You might however fail and then loose both the wepon and the<br/>
stone (lost anyway).<br/>
<br/>
For me sharpening weapons became trivial at a smithing skill of 22. I<br/>
think it means that my smithing skill won&#39;t increase from it, dunno<br/>
if it means I will never be more successful. I succeed most of the<br/>
time anyway.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;OK, basic question I know, but I have to ask anyway.  I have a<br/>
rusted sword, how do I get it to good quality again?  I would think a<br/>
sharpening stone.  I guess the question is how do you make a<br/>
sharpenting stone, or do you obtain it some place and then how do you<br/>
apply it?  I found the guy I can purchase ore from and can get a<br/>
flask of water.  I haven&#39;t even opened up blacksmithing yet (will<br/>
this evening).  Can any one give me a little guidence on the best way<br/>
to open this skill up other than trial and error.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for any help<br/>
&gt;<br/>
