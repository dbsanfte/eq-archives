&gt; &gt; Your model is wrong.  Ore, free?  What the hell are you thinking?  First,<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s free if you kill a creature that drops it (not worth time).  Second,<br/>
&gt; &gt; ore isn&#39;t needed for making armor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, but it CAN be used for making metal sheets... but your correct, not<br/>
&gt; worth it really (those blocks of ore are 15lbs!!  Try carrying a few of<br/>
&gt; those and running through a dangerous area!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now, as for molds.  Since you used a tunic in your letter, I will use it<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; well.  A Tunic molds costs over 1pp.  It requires 3 metal sheets, all of<br/>
&gt; &gt; which also cost over 1pp.  Then the water, at a palsy 1sp or so.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I sell my tunics at 17pp.  I consider this a fair price, and many else<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; agreed with me (as I have sold many many many for this price).  How can<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; say it&#39;s a bit steep?  It is MY choice to sell for the price that I see<br/>
&gt; fit.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It is not up to you to decide how much I feel my time is worth.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Might be a &#39;fair&#39; price to the BUYER, yes... but not necessarily fair to the<br/>
&gt; rest of the smiths... You still forget about the failures and practice you<br/>
&gt; have to put in... Don&#39;t just base it all on the AMOUNT either... Take into<br/>
&gt; consideration all the TIME it took you to learn to smith... those endless<br/>
&gt; hours and hours at the hot forge making those little metal bits and<br/>
&gt; skewers... the traveling around you had to do to get all the items and head<br/>
&gt; back to the forge... the waiting in LINE at the forge (In some cases) ...<br/>
&gt; So, remember the TIME as well as your cost in platinum that it took you to<br/>
&gt; learn it!  After all, you could have made lots of money out killing mobs AND<br/>
&gt; gotten experience at the same time!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I try to sell my Tunics for 20 (when I can make them) and I WISH I could<br/>
&gt; sell them for more!  They are easily worth twice that!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; On any account, there will (for the most part) always be a flow, if not<br/>
&gt; &gt; constant, for banded.  Seeing as how new people begin the game, or old<br/>
&gt; &gt; people create new characters (that are not always twinked mind you), we<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt; have other&#39;s to sell to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh wrong again my friend... what happens when there is too much of a &#39;good&#39;<br/>
&gt; thing?  And believe me, there will be... When I first logged on in this game<br/>
&gt; (about 2 weeks after it &#39;officially&#39; started), people were selling banded<br/>
&gt; armor for TWICE the prices they are now (and more!) and I would see messages<br/>
&gt; all the time of &quot;Banded Wanted&quot;...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now look at it from the economic side of things... Now there is PLENTY of<br/>
&gt; banded armor out there from all the smiths, and prices are MUCH cheaper!<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t think that other newbies are not starting up as new smiths too!  They<br/>
&gt; are!  and it is a little bit easier for them too because of the &#39;limited&#39;<br/>
&gt; fixes Verant has done for the beginning smith...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But what happens when you have 1500 players on a server (at any one time)<br/>
&gt; and there are 1000 sets of banded armor and another 500 sets of Bronze<br/>
&gt; Plate, Rubicite and other kinds?  Oh and least we forget that those 1000<br/>
&gt; that don&#39;t have those &#39;higher&#39; forms of armor WILL be getting them also<br/>
&gt; sooner or later... What happens is that banded armor becomes as worthless as<br/>
&gt; Studded and Reinforced already is...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Look at the prices for Bronze plate already!  People selling PLATE ARMOR for<br/>
&gt; less than 20plat per piece?  That is rediculous!  but hey, they can because<br/>
&gt; it is soooo easy to get nowadays... So many smiths have to sell their stuff<br/>
&gt; cheaper too... otherwise the buyers just want to wait until they can get the<br/>
&gt; Plate... They know the prices are coming down too...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, it will end up like Studded and Reinforced armor has... Useless.... It<br/>
&gt; is only a matter of time...  Of course by then we should all be making<br/>
&gt; plate!  But that will come with the same strings attached!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Remember one thing about smithing if you remember anything at all... It<br/>
&gt; costs more than MATERIALS to make an item!  It costs you TIME too!<br/>
