<div id="ygrps-yiv-463529684">Sorry to pester everyone...<br/>
<br/>
Is there a chart somewhere of the relative difficulties of the various banded pieces?<br/>
<br/>
I know cloaks are really hard, and that gorgets and bracers are really easy (relatively<br/>
speaking), but what about in between?<br/>
<br/>
Are belts hard?  Or have I just been unlucky?<br/>
