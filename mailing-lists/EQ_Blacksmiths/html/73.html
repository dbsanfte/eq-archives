<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378375921">The orges (or what ever they are) sells the blacksmith books and some molds<br/>
too, their are 2 of them standing side by side I am not sure if they sell<br/>
anything different (didn&#39;t really care at the time), I thought I saw skewers<br/>
in their someplace, it has been a while since I was their, so forgive me if<br/>
I am wrong.  I do know they don&#39;t sell the ore, only the books and some<br/>
molds, if it is any help.<br/>

I know that ore is sold in Neriak.  Go downstairs in the Blind Fish tavern;<br/>
the two dart players sell ore and I think molds, not sure.<br/>
