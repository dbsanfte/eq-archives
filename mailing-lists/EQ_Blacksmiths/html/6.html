The merchant is  in a building on the platform just before the platform with<br/>
TrueShot bows on it (it also has a Pottery Firing oven there too).  I found<br/>
him by accident... :)<br/>
<br/>
I have moved my operations to Freeport now.  Just got bound there today.<br/>
Will continue to practice tailoring and blacksmithing here for a long time I<br/>
think.<br/>

so far i have it form a more skilled blacksmith that lantern molds have<br/>
given <br/>
him better skill gain in the 40s range than skewers.. skewers might got some<br/>
<br/>
reason be tougher (who knows for sure...) <br/>
<br/>
good info on the Freeport vs Akanon pricing... not sure how to improve <br/>
faction with gnome merchants other than doing quests...<br/>
<br/>
i was informed that studs require a file mold (found in freeport or just <br/>
outside kaladim gates) and metal bits to make a file then put metal bits and<br/>
<br/>
file together to get stud... it was mentioned that a skill of around 40 to<br/>
50 <br/>
would give good results on stud making...<br/>
<br/>
a skill of around 60 to 80 starts giving good results on making banded <br/>
armor...<br/>
<br/>
still no confirmation on if you really can make plate.. but i was wondering <br/>
just exactly what a folded metal sheet is for? &lt;evil grin&gt;<br/>
