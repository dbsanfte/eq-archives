<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488983436">I have no idea, why some people feel they need to resort to personal bashing<br/>
when they don&#39;t understand something.  Let me spell it out for you a little<br/>
bit.<br/>
<br/>
Since you are playing EQ, you have at some point purchased a copy of Windows<br/>
95 or 98.  It may have been bundled with the system you purchased, but I<br/>
guarantee you it was in the price.  I paid $85 for my OEM copy when I built<br/>
my computer, so we&#39;ll go with that price.  I paid for a &quot;product.&quot;  Do you<br/>
think it cost Microsoft $85 to manufacture the CD my product was delivered<br/>
on?  I think not.  They charge that amount because they had to pay<br/>
programmers for their &quot;TIME.&quot;  And time, dear sir, is a commodity.  It is a<br/>
precious commodity.  Do you think those programmers wrote perfect code the<br/>
first time out the gate?  Hell no.  Why do you think they released Win95<br/>
OSR2 in 1996?  And actually there were three or four releases of OSR2.<br/>
Those subsequent releases were addressing &quot;failed code&quot; or &quot;failures.&quot;  If<br/>
you honestly think that you did not pay for the research to correct those<br/>
failures, then you sir are extremely naive.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s take another quick example.  A car manufacturer discovers that their<br/>
seatbelts are defective.  They recall the vehicle and have the owners take<br/>
their vehicle to the nearest dealership to have a new seatbelt system<br/>
installed.  That costs money.  Notification to the customers, training on<br/>
the new installation procedures for the mechanics, and research from the<br/>
engineering team to develop a seatbelt that works, among many other<br/>
expenses.  Where do you think that money comes from?  Well, last I checked<br/>
it doesn&#39;t come from trees, so it must have come from the consumer.<br/>
<br/>
Any good business, any successful business, will factor failed and defective<br/>
merchandise into the price of the item they are selling in addition to any<br/>
research and development money that was spent to create the item initially.<br/>
The first 115 or so levels in blacksmithing is your research and development<br/>
time, and your product after that point should be targetted at retrieving<br/>
the sum of money you spent up to that point within a reasonable amount of<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
There are people on my server that sell sleeves for 9pp and tunics for 10pp.<br/>
Hooray for them.  I lost 1 customer who would not pay more than 9pp for the<br/>
sleeves last night.  I will not sell them for less than 14pp.  Guess what?<br/>
I still sold 3 cloaks, 2 tunics, and 2 pairs of sleeves last night for a<br/>
90pp profit.  It took me about 2 minutes to make it all, and I sold it in<br/>
between hunting.  So you have fun making your 5gp per item profit.  I will<br/>
take a few minutes here and there to recoup my costs and pay for my spells,<br/>
and still have satisfied customers.  You see, my profit pays for research<br/>
and development in my other trade skills, which is my method of<br/>
diversification.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry if you still don&#39;t understand this, perhaps you should consider a<br/>
business class or two.  You might learn how to actually make a buck.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I&#39;m sorry.. are you a moron?  Your plan won&#39;t work for shit.  You keep<br/>
&gt;your prices at what they are..  i will sell cheaper.. everyone will keep<br/>
&gt;coming to me.. i&#39;ll get plenty of practice and my smithing will continue<br/>
&gt;to raise.. and I&#39;ll make all the money while you sit all alone with your<br/>
&gt;overpriced shit.  People do NOT pay for failures.  They pay for the<br/>
&gt;product.  As a smith, you are supposed to supply people with a product.<br/>
&gt;You don&#39;t supply them with your failures.  Smithing is a profitable<br/>
&gt;business.. yes.  But it&#39;s the greedy assholes like you who try to make<br/>
&gt;other people pay for your lack of skill who ruin the trade.  Pay for<br/>
&gt;your own mistakes.<br/>
