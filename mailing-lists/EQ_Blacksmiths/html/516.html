<b>Subject:</b> Re: Is blacksmithing broke? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-113934600"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Any how.  I have a feeling blacksmithing is broke.  My skill is 126 or <br/>
&gt;somewhere near there.  I can make all items with only a few failures.  (I <br/>
&gt;hate legs though, seem to fail a lot.)<br/>
&gt;I have made well over 100 pieces of armor over the past couple of weeks, and <br/>
&gt;have not seen a single point of skill increase.  I didn&#39;t have any problem <br/>
&gt;getting skill up to 126 making all the standard stuff, then I start making <br/>
&gt;armor, and I get nothing.  My Int is about average 86.  I&#39;m thinking that <br/>
&gt;getting skill from making armor is broke.  Has anyone else seen this?  Also, <br/>
&gt;I know some armor items are trivial, and I know I&#39;m not making a ton of <br/>
&gt;trivial armor items.  I&#39;ve made plenty of legs, mails, cloaks, mantles, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I can&#39;t say if making the armor is broke for skill gains, but if you<br/>
want to get your skill up a bit higher to increase your success rate try<br/>
making some Sweing Kits.  They don&#39;t trivial till 135.<br/>
