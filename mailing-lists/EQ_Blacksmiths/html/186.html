<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948058820">Joint bank accounts wouldn&#39;t be that great of an idea... For the reasons you<br/>
stated, it would, but it would be abused too easily to help *twink* another<br/>
character up...<br/>
<br/>
I think you would start seeing even more (there already are some) lower<br/>
level characters wearing the best armor and having the best weapons that<br/>
money can buy because they are &#39;sharing&#39; those items with the &#39;other&#39;<br/>
player...<br/>
<br/>
In other words:  I have a level 18 character that has all banded armor and a<br/>
Combine Staff - I put it into the bank, log out, log back on as a NEW<br/>
character that is level 1... he puts on the armor, grabs the staff, and in<br/>
just a few hours he is up to level 10!  Not worrying much about getting<br/>
killed off because his AC is around 300 or so!<br/>
<br/>
No, no sharing of accounts...  BUT, I WOULD like to see some way for GUILDS<br/>
to have a &#39;seperate&#39; account (for officers) to make it easier to handle the<br/>
income and outlay of the guilds...<br/>

&gt; Anyone else here think that they should make joint bank accounts? Have a<br/>
&gt; limit on the number of people that can go into it. This would be great for<br/>
&gt; people into trade skills. 2 friends smithing together, put all profit into<br/>
&gt; the account. Have it completely seperate from the original ones. And have<br/>
