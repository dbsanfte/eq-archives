<b>Subject:</b> Re: Sharpening ... Stone <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-108651030">Okay, I can sharpen a stone, but is there polish to be found anywhere?<br/>
I have heard of polish from P4 and I have explored most of Faydwer<br/>
looking for polish but have not been able to find any anywhere. <br/>
Has anyone found polish and have been able to use it?<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you want the answer here, you have to buy<br/>
&gt; sharpening stones (not <br/>
&gt; sold everywhere) at 3 or 4cp a piece and then put<br/>
&gt; the rusty weapon <br/>
&gt; and a sharpening stone in a forge (available<br/>
&gt; somewhere in most <br/>
&gt; cities, ask around) and then hit combine. If you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; lucky you&#39;ll get <br/>
&gt; a taarnished weapon which will be a couple delay<br/>
&gt; points faster! Not <br/>
&gt; bad. You might however fail and then loose both the<br/>
&gt; wepon and the <br/>
&gt; stone (lost anyway).<br/>
