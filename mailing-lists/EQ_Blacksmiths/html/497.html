<div id="ygrps-yiv-849450320">This truely is a pain but there are no banded gloves to be made.  I&#39;ve sold<br/>
several people full suits of banded and then here &quot;You forgot the gloves.&quot;<br/>
Then I have to explain to them that there are no banded gloves.  It really<br/>
is a pain.  I don&#39;t know if they forgot or did it on purpose but it would<br/>
have been nice to make them.  The best you can do is get ringmail or chain<br/>
to go along with the banded.  I<br/>

&gt; Greetings all....<br/>
&gt;    One quick question. I have been doing smithing for what seems like<br/>
&gt; forever and am way above master level. However, in all my time of smithing<br/>
&gt; I have yet to see or find a mold for banded gloves though I&#39;ve had many<br/>
&gt; MANY customers request them. Does anyone know if banded gloves even exist<br/>
&gt; and if so are there molds to make them or must they be bought from<br/>
&gt; merchant...and if there are molds to make them...where the heck are they<br/>
&gt; hiding them?? lol Thanks much for any help. ;)<br/>
