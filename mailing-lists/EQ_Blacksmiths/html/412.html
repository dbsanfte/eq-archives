<div id="ygrps-yiv-493329375">OK, simple question, how many of you people that are for items deteriorating and going poof have any magic plate?  (none I&#39;d bet)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent about 2 months to get the armor that I am now wearing, I&#39;d be pissed to an extreem if I were in the middle of a fight and I see a message &quot;Your Charred Black Tunic has fallen appart&quot;.  That one piece of armor alone took me the better part of week to get.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so you say I should have to get it repaired by a smith.  I am DE, and by choice I have lowered my faction to the point where I will never be able to go into Freeport or Rivervale, and due to built in factions, I can not go to any other elf city nor can I go into gnome, dwarf, or barbarian city.  Which means that I would have to search, not only for a respectable smith that I trusted, but also an evil one, or trek my self across the world to Qeynos.  Simply to get my armor &quot;repaired&quot;.  Now if that isn&#39;t bad enough.....<br/>
<br/>
Often my group will go deep into a dungeon, deep to the point where either a caster has to group gate us to get us out, or we have to spend 30-45 min fighting out way out of the dungeon.  And quite often we&#39;ll all camp and logout in a &quot;safe&quot; spot in the dungeon, so sometimes we will be in a dungeon litterly for days.  Now, say I get the message &quot;your rubicite helm is begining to weaken, you should take it for repairs soon&quot;, that means that my entire group would have to leave the dungeon so that I might quest to get my armor repaired.<br/>
<br/>
I find neither to be acceptable.  What I do find about this, is that there are some smiths who think they don&#39;t make enough money, so they want armor to wear out, so it has to either be replaced or repaired (more money for smiths).  What they fail to concider is the fact that you will not always be wearing banded armor.<br/>

It would make people too mad. Having a nice piece of magic armor that took <br/>
forever to get disappear because it wore out. I don&#39;t like this idea, as it <br/>
would just make EQ more like Diablo and Ultima Online, which I hope they <br/>
would want to try and stay away from.<br/>

<br/>
Some other RPG&#39;s I&#39;ve played made it so that common wear items wore quicker<br/>
than others as well as making rare quest items not wear very little or not at<br/>
all since they are supposed to be considered priceless.  I think the idea of<br/>
making items wear would be a great thing for the trade.  A shield and sword<br/>
would wear quicker than say boots or leggings.  This gives smiths an<br/>
oppurtunity to increase their skills with less cost if they want to work on<br/>
repairing and improving items.<br/>
