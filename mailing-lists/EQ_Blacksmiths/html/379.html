<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471077477">As for the fixed prices, I&#39;m all for it.  I haven&#39;t reached the level where<br/>
I can make banded yet, but when I get there, I want more than a few gold<br/>
profit for my wares.  I do have a further suggestion though.  When you see<br/>
people selling at a few gold above cost, bargain with them to get their<br/>
prices lower, and buy out their stock.  Then, sell it yourself at the fixed<br/>
price.  So long as the person doesn&#39;t run fight back to the forge and make<br/>
up a new suit of 3gp profit banded, you&#39;ve got yourself more supply without<br/>
the time and effort of making it and without and without the failure costs.<br/>
<br/>
My two cents, free of charge.<br/>
