<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389347033">I hear that these things are going into the game soon. Will they? If so, any <br/>
time on when? A guess... or something. All comments are welcomed. Just want <br/>
to find out. Can&#39;t wait until this is in, be a very rich person! Plate tunics <br/>
at 400 - 500pp instead of the thousands... very nice. Very rich, very famous. <br/>
:-)  Powergamers dream, and that I am. Please don&#39;t flame me on that, just <br/>
stick to the topic. =) Thanks much.<br/>

P.S. If any of you are on Veeshan, and see someone wanting banded, have them <br/>
tell me. Thanks.</div>
