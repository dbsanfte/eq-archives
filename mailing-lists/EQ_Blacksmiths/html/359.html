<div id="ygrps-yiv-687480628">You are correct in the recipe for making sheets. Ogre and Troll smiths have no choice but to make their own sheets from the start as no one sells sheets anywhere near us nor anywhere we can go and not be KOS. It&#39;s a bit of a hassle having to buy 16 small blocks of ore at a time from Grobb, haul them back to Oggok and make eight sheets out of them, but we have no other choice. BTW, at 15 lbs each, the blocks weigh 240 lbs together. Luckily we are endowed with great strength (mine is 140) and this plus what we are already wearing merely encumbers us. I&#39;m thinking a human or elf wouldn&#39;t even be able to move, thus you have vendors who sell it pre-made. <br/>

I was sworn to secrecy on the blue ore, sorry I cannae say =)<br/>
<br/>
After 175 is scaled plate, unfortunately the folded sheets are<br/>
&quot;administratively broken&quot;, meaning Verant has decided not to<br/>
let us smith them yet, so combining a block of ore and a flask<br/>
of water will yield nothing. Since nothing else will increase your<br/>
skill (banded cloaks are the last that will increase it) 175 is<br/>
currently the highest skill you can have in smithing.<br/>
<br/>
In response to someone else&#39;s question along this thread, sheets<br/>
of metal can be produced by a smith if they do not have access<br/>
to premade sheets, I believe the correct formula (as is in the<br/>
Basic Blacksmithing book, if you dinnae have this and are a<br/>
smith, I pity you) is 2 small bricks of ore and a flask of water.<br/>

&gt; Where do you get blue ore? =)<br/>
&gt; and what do you do after 175?<br/>
