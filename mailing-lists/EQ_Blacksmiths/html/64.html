    If you won&#39;t post your updates here anymore please post them to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EQ_smiths@onelist.com">EQ_smiths@onelist.com</a>  It is another blacksmith list for EQ.  Maybe they<br/>
would actually appreciate the info on blacksmithing considering that&#39;s what<br/>
the mailing list is about.  If people piss and moan there too just post the<br/>
link to you blacksmith section.  Most people will check out the sight when<br/>
they see how well it is put together.  Keep the updates coming.<br/>
