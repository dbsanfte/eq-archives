<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305396528">There are two books for blacksmithing, one is &quot;blacksmith&quot; something <br/>
(sorry, forgot) and the other is called &quot;weapons and armors&quot; (or very <br/>
close). Dunno which one explains it but you should buy them anyway, <br/>
they just cost over 1gp.<br/>
<br/>
If you want the answer here, you have to buy sharpening stones (not <br/>
sold everywhere) at 3 or 4cp a piece and then put the rusty weapon <br/>
and a sharpening stone in a forge (available somewhere in most <br/>
cities, ask around) and then hit combine. If you&#39;re lucky you&#39;ll get <br/>
a taarnished weapon which will be a couple delay points faster! Not <br/>
bad. You might however fail and then loose both the wepon and the <br/>
stone (lost anyway).<br/>
<br/>
For me sharpening weapons became trivial at a smithing skill of 22. I <br/>
think it means that my smithing skill won&#39;t increase from it, dunno <br/>
if it means I will never be more successful. I succeed most of the <br/>
time anyway.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;OK, basic question I know, but I have to ask anyway.  I have a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>rusted sword, how do I get it to good quality again?  I would think a <br/>
sharpening stone.  I guess the question is how do you make a <br/>
sharpenting stone, or do you obtain it some place and then how do you <br/>
apply it?  I found the guy I can purchase ore from and can get a <br/>
flask of water.  I haven&#39;t even opened up blacksmithing yet (will <br/>
this evening).  Can any one give me a little guidence on the best way <br/>
to open this skill up other than trial and error.<br/>
