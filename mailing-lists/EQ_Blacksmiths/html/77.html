<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825041347">Ok, I just relocated to Freeport to begin blacksmithing.  I just want to<br/>
double check that my progress sounds normal.  I started by using 21 points<br/>
for training.  I gain about 1 experience point for every 20 scalers I make.<br/>
That seems low to me.  I&#39;ve tried some skewers but have only gained a level<br/>
once when I succeeded  Do you have to succeed to improve?  Any opinions<br/>
would be helpfull.<br/>
