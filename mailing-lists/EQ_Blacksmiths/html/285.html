<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140340429">You can go to www.eqvault.com and get the Blacksmith&#39;s Guide. But here are<br/>
my suggestions:<br/>
<br/>
Save 20 points and dump them into the skill, if not already at 20 (your<br/>
guild will tell you that you need advanced training after 20, which means<br/>
you have to start spending some money)<br/>
<br/>
From skill 21-27, sharpen weapons that cost over 1g to sell. At this point<br/>
you won&#39;t get any skill increases from daggers and maces.<br/>
<br/>
From skill 27-41, start making scalers. You will need metal bits (2 small<br/>
blocks of ore + a flask of water), scaler mold and a flask of water. These<br/>
are great because if you fail, you still get an item to sell.<br/>
<br/>
From skill 42-115, make skewers. Metal bits, skewer mold and a flask of<br/>
water. You will rarely make these, but this is the cheapest way to get your<br/>
skill up.<br/>
<br/>
I would wait until skill 60 to begin trying to make Banded Armor. At this<br/>
time, you should be able to make Gorgets and Bracers with ease. That should<br/>
compensate you for your time spent jacking up the skill.<br/>
<br/>
I took me 3 12-hour days and over 200pp (i lost count) to get my skill from<br/>
30-100. It WILL aggrevate you, but this skill can be one of the most<br/>
rewarding.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
