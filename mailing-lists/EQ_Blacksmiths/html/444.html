&gt; Your model is wrong.  Ore, free?  What the hell are you thinking?  First,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s free if you kill a creature that drops it (not worth time).  Second,<br/>
&gt; ore isn&#39;t needed for making armor.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, but it CAN be used for making metal sheets... but your correct, not<br/>
worth it really (those blocks of ore are 15lbs!!  Try carrying a few of<br/>
those and running through a dangerous area!)<br/>

&gt; I sell my tunics at 17pp.  I consider this a fair price, and many else<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Might be a &#39;fair&#39; price to the BUYER, yes... but not necessarily fair to the<br/>
rest of the smiths... You still forget about the failures and practice you<br/>
have to put in... Don&#39;t just base it all on the AMOUNT either... Take into<br/>
consideration all the TIME it took you to learn to smith... those endless<br/>
hours and hours at the hot forge making those little metal bits and<br/>
skewers... the traveling around you had to do to get all the items and head<br/>
back to the forge... the waiting in LINE at the forge (In some cases) ...<br/>
So, remember the TIME as well as your cost in platinum that it took you to<br/>
learn it!  After all, you could have made lots of money out killing mobs AND<br/>
gotten experience at the same time!<br/>
<br/>
I try to sell my Tunics for 20 (when I can make them) and I WISH I could<br/>
sell them for more!  They are easily worth twice that!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On any account, there will (for the most part) always be a flow, if not<br/>
&gt; constant, for banded.  Seeing as how new people begin the game, or old<br/>

 </span></blockquote>will<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have other&#39;s to sell to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh wrong again my friend... what happens when there is too much of a &#39;good&#39;<br/>
thing?  And believe me, there will be... When I first logged on in this game<br/>
(about 2 weeks after it &#39;officially&#39; started), people were selling banded<br/>
armor for TWICE the prices they are now (and more!) and I would see messages<br/>
all the time of &quot;Banded Wanted&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Now look at it from the economic side of things... Now there is PLENTY of<br/>
banded armor out there from all the smiths, and prices are MUCH cheaper!<br/>
Don&#39;t think that other newbies are not starting up as new smiths too!  They<br/>
are!  and it is a little bit easier for them too because of the &#39;limited&#39;<br/>
fixes Verant has done for the beginning smith...<br/>
<br/>
But what happens when you have 1500 players on a server (at any one time)<br/>
and there are 1000 sets of banded armor and another 500 sets of Bronze<br/>
Plate, Rubicite and other kinds?  Oh and least we forget that those 1000<br/>
that don&#39;t have those &#39;higher&#39; forms of armor WILL be getting them also<br/>
sooner or later... What happens is that banded armor becomes as worthless as<br/>
Studded and Reinforced already is...<br/>
<br/>
Look at the prices for Bronze plate already!  People selling PLATE ARMOR for<br/>
less than 20plat per piece?  That is rediculous!  but hey, they can because<br/>
it is soooo easy to get nowadays... So many smiths have to sell their stuff<br/>
cheaper too... otherwise the buyers just want to wait until they can get the<br/>
Plate... They know the prices are coming down too...<br/>
<br/>
So, it will end up like Studded and Reinforced armor has... Useless.... It<br/>
is only a matter of time...  Of course by then we should all be making<br/>
plate!  But that will come with the same strings attached!<br/>
<br/>
Remember one thing about smithing if you remember anything at all... It<br/>
costs more than MATERIALS to make an item!  It costs you TIME too!<br/>
