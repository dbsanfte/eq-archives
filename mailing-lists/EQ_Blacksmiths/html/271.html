<b>Subject:</b> Cost of gaining skill points <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-104901650">I have a smithing question that might first look <br/>
like a fletching questions, but please bear with <br/>
me.  <br/>
<br/>
To develop my fletching skill I make arrows - bows <br/>
are much too expensive for a failure.  Before the <br/>
recent change to the skills I would buy a batch <br/>
of raw materials from the fletching supplier and <br/>
tediously make arrows, frequently getting a <br/>
message that my skill had gone up.  I sold the <br/>
completed arrows back to a merchant in my guild <br/>
to minimize the cost of gaining skill.  (The <br/>
market for arrows isn&#39;t so hot.)  In my most <br/>
recent training exercise I went from a skill of <br/>
69 to a skill of 74.  The outlay, after buying <br/>
raw materials and selling the completed arrows, <br/>
was about 2.5 pp, or about 5g/skill point.  All <br/>
this was before the patch.  Note that this cost <br/>
is very different than using the skill points <br/>
you get when you gain levels, I&#39;m not talking <br/>
about that.<br/>
<br/>
Fletchers complained bitterly about having to <br/>
make single arrows.  Verant responded with a <br/>
solution that sells components in batches of <br/>
five and produces arrows in batches of five.  <br/>
The problem is, the skill level is based on the <br/>
number of times the fletcher hits the &quot;combine&quot; <br/>
key.  The tediousness of making arrows has been <br/>
fixed, but the price of gaining skill points has <br/>
been multiplied by a factor of five.<br/>
<br/>
My question to you smiths is, do you know how <br/>
much it costs to increase your skill?  In the <br/>
range from 60 to 80 is it 5g/point, or <br/>
2.5pp/point?  Or is it far different than that?  <br/>
I appreciate your patience in reading through <br/>
this.  Thank you.<br/>
