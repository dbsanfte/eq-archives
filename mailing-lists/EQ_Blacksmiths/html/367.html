<div id="ygrps-yiv-19455523">hmmm, very good strategy :) This could be something you could use to<br/>
jump start the price increase, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend doing it once<br/>
the prices are widespread. Then you wind up selling at a discount<br/>
anyways =P For the first little while until the prices catch, though, I<br/>
do agree that this will work wonders.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; My first post. Here&#39;s a couple things that have worked well for me in<br/>
&gt; the Qeynos area of the Bristlebain server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Whenever I see a new smith auctioning his wares in my area, I start up<br/>
&gt; a conversation and do a price check, let him know how much he can get<br/>
&gt; selling in my area. Wish him luck.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another thing that&#39;s worked well for me, and I hate to give this trick<br/>
&gt; away, but it helps so much with the price fixing, what&#39;s good for all<br/>
&gt; is good for me, and all that. So here goes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve a couple buddies who I&#39;ve enlisted as resellers for me. I sell to<br/>
&gt; them at a 30% discount off my regular prices. They resell at my<br/>
&gt; current full price, when they sell items off, I restock them. This<br/>
&gt; moves my product, these friends make money (some a whole lot of it, my<br/>
&gt; girlfriend has over 300 plat in the bank at level 17, most from<br/>
&gt; reselling my goods). This has the added bonus of price fixing. Say<br/>
&gt; someone asks me how much for leggings, I say 20p. That&#39;s too much they<br/>
&gt; say, so I tell &#39;em check around, that&#39;s the going rate. They do a<br/>
&gt; couple price checks with others selling banded in that area (MY<br/>
&gt; RESELLERS) and what do ya know, that IS the going rate, yes, they did<br/>
&gt; I price check with me, indirectly, but they don&#39;t know that. Other<br/>
&gt; smiths see you and your resellers all selling for the same amount,<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll bump their prices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Strength in numbers. A group of three or four all agreeing on a price<br/>
&gt; (those three or four include you and your resellers), have a much<br/>
&gt; easier time convincing the new smith in town that these are the going<br/>
&gt; rates, than just one snotty blacksmith trying to get you to up your<br/>
&gt; rates.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This works folks, give it a try.<br/>
