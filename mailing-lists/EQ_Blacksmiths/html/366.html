I&#39;m american. That doesn&#39;t make me against this price war :) Laws were<br/>
established against<br/>
collusion and monopolies to prevent the abuse of the abilities they granted.<br/>
It was proven<br/>
that people who practiced either concept would abuse the ability (i.e. JD<br/>
Rockefeller and<br/>
Standard Oil). There is no law in EQ saying we can&#39;t practice these concepts<br/>
or even one<br/>
saying we can&#39;t abuse them. We could be jerks and charge just as much as<br/>
chain. If we all<br/>
agree to it, they have no choice do they? Not if they want banded anyway. I<br/>
don&#39;t want to<br/>
abuse this, though, I just want the prices to be fair to me. Somebody said on<br/>
this list that<br/>
EQ has a very low bottom for their economy. People don&#39;t really pay for their<br/>
losses, or<br/>
collect for their gains for that matter, in anything besides game money. If<br/>
someone&#39;s<br/>
character bottoms out, they can always go hunt for 10 plat and resume their<br/>
smithing. In RL,<br/>
if you hit the bottom, it isn&#39;t that easy to bounce back. That&#39;s what scares<br/>
people into not<br/>
going TOO low on their prices. EQ doesn&#39;t have that, people will sell at a<br/>
loss or to break<br/>
even simply because they want to be nice to people who can&#39;t afford the better<br/>
armor. Lots of<br/>
the higher levels can even AFFORD to do that! With that in mind, participating<br/>
in a price war<br/>
will only ruin smithing. People are almost getting it for cost right now if<br/>
you include<br/>
failures. Before I inflated my prices it took me an hour to earn 15 plat.<br/>
That&#39;s ridiculous,<br/>
I&#39;d rather spend that hour at a brew barrel and make the same amount. I&#39;m not<br/>
lowering my<br/>
prices, people are going to pay me what I deserve for making this armor, and I<br/>
suggest you all<br/>
set the same standard. Why compete with ourselves? Competition is healthy, but<br/>
too much is<br/>
not. Businesses go under because of price wars. Since the &#39;low price&#39; is<br/>
selling for no profit<br/>
whatsoever, there is nothing to be gained by &quot;winning&quot; the price war and<br/>
putting other smiths<br/>
out of their trade. It&#39;ll only ruin the opportunity we have.<br/>
<br/>
We have 2 people now on this list who don&#39;t want to raise prices, and we have<br/>
an uncounted<br/>
amount of people who DO want to raise them. Let&#39;s raise them and make this<br/>
worth our while :)<br/>
<br/>
As for offering more to the customer, Peter, I&#39;m a master smith, baker,<br/>
brewer, and potter.<br/>
I&#39;m average at tailoring and jewelcraft. I am in a guild with people who have<br/>
mastered the<br/>
trades I have not, and I supply merchandise that players cannot make, but must<br/>
find or buy.<br/>
I&#39;ve also been known to teach languages and offer my guide services (and if<br/>
the distance is<br/>
short, guiding is free). In general, people I talk to on my server like me,<br/>
but that doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean they will pay me money for it. They only buy my products. Only 3 times<br/>
have I ever had a<br/>
compliment on my friendliness or customer service no matter how excellent it<br/>
is. Just goes to<br/>
show you that Norrath isn&#39;t your idealistic United States.<br/>

Nick,  <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate you feeling personal enough to call people by their irl names so<br/>
I will do the same with you.  It is quite evident that you are trying to lead<br/>
this crusade for price fixing.  I would like to inform you that though EQ is<br/>
not an idealistic economy, nothing is.  So as you attempt to fix the prices<br/>
with the smiths that join you in this endeavor there will be many more that<br/>
will not.  You see not everyone is a master smith yet and they need to have<br/>
cash flow in order to improve upon this.  As you said noone compliments you<br/>
for being a nice guy or giving them good service, so they&#39;ll just go to the<br/>
guy who is selling armor at a cheap enough cost to make more and improve their<br/>
abilities.  The simple reason being that they don&#39;t care if you made it or<br/>
someone else did as long as it works.  That&#39;s why we will compete with<br/>
ourselves because the money you make does not go in the other smiths&#39; pockets.<br/>
 As long as people continue to join the EQ community there will be people who<br/>
want to learn to smith.  So when they lower their prices to build on their<br/>
skills and move inventory, that is where people will go.  <br/>
