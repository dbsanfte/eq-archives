I appreciate you feeling personal enough to call people by their irl names <br/>
so<br/>
I will do the same with you.  It is quite evident that you are trying to <br/>
lead<br/>
this crusade for price fixing.  I would like to inform you that though EQ is<br/>
not an idealistic economy, nothing is.  So as you attempt to fix the prices<br/>
with the smiths that join you in this endeavor there will be many more that<br/>
will not.  You see not everyone is a master smith yet and they need to have<br/>
cash flow in order to improve upon this.  As you said noone compliments you<br/>
for being a nice guy or giving them good service, so they&#39;ll just go to the<br/>
guy who is selling armor at a cheap enough cost to make more and improve <br/>
their<br/>
abilities.  The simple reason being that they don&#39;t care if you made it or<br/>
someone else did as long as it works.  That&#39;s why we will compete with<br/>
ourselves because the money you make does not go in the other smiths&#39; <br/>
pockets.<br/>
As long as people continue to join the EQ community there will be people who<br/>
want to learn to smith.  So when they lower their prices to build on their<br/>
skills and move inventory, that is where people will go.<br/>

As a &quot;new&quot; smith on E&#39;ci (Araman, in Faydwer), I&#39;d like to comment on what <br/>
the &quot;increased&quot; prices mean to me. My skill is currently in the <br/>
mid-nineties, and I can pretty well count on being able to make gorgets and <br/>
bracers with a 50% or greater success rate (in fact, I have overstock on <br/>
gorgets!). Helms and masks are proving more difficult, and I am not even <br/>
attempting to make any other item until I make some more skewers :) Now, <br/>
granted the first 3 items of banded I made increased my skill 3 points, but <br/>
that hasn&#39;t happened lately, so I have to pay for my failures. For bracers <br/>
and gorgets this is no problem, as they&#39;re relatively easy and cheap to <br/>
make. However, I have about a 20% success rate for masks and helms, and they <br/>
cost me approx. 3 plat each per failure. Am I making any money on a 12pp <br/>
mask if I fail it 3 times? No. Is there a glut of bracers and gorgets? Where <br/>
I am, yes there is. I am forced to make these other, more risky items to <br/>
keep customers happy and money coming in. I sold around 7-8 banded pieces <br/>
last night, and currently have.. 35 plat. However, it&#39;s enough to get me to <br/>
Steamfront, load up with ore, and continue refining my skill by smithing <br/>
skewers. I&#39;d LIKE to someday be able to afford that full set of plate or <br/>
that Shiny Brass Halberd, but for the time being I&#39;m simply happy to have <br/>
enough money left over to stay in business and to buy ore.<br/>
<br/>
Had I been selling my items for a couple plat less per piece, I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
able to afford to make some of the better pieces for my customers. I also <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have the extra money for ore runs to Steamfront. I&#39;d be right back <br/>
where I was before - killing skeletons for rusty weapons and camping <br/>
low-level bandits in LFay for their bronze weapons. I for one am all in <br/>
favor of these &quot;MSRP&quot; figures, because I get a little extra money, the <br/>
customer knows the &quot;MSRP&quot; for the area, and the MSRP provides some &quot;wiggle <br/>
room&quot;. What&#39;s that, you ask? If a banded mask costs 10pp (going with the <br/>
&quot;lowball&quot; prices some are suggesting) and I fail a couple of times, I&#39;m not <br/>
making any money on it anyway. Along comes John Doe (No not a Druid) who <br/>
tries to get me down to 8 or 9pp for it. I CAN&#39;T DO IT and make any money, <br/>
so John gets pissed and goes to another smith. I&#39;ve lost more than one sale <br/>
- I&#39;ve lost both the mask sale AND any future sales to that *PLAYER*. If I <br/>
can price at 12pp, I can come down to 10-11 if I want and not worry about <br/>
failing 3 times, because I am still making money.<br/>
<br/>
We can make any deal we want for any piece of armor, but our initial, public <br/>
prices should be consistent - a goal we are a long way from achieving but <br/>
getting closer to every day.<br/>
