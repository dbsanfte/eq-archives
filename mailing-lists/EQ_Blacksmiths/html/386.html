<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502804244">A while back, early in my smithing career, I thought it would be cool if smiths could make magic armor with the help of an enchanter.  But now that I&#39;m much higher level (36), and I have found that magic armor is very rare and hard to come by.  Its annoying enough to see someone twink out their guild buddies or secondary characters in rare, highly sought after magical armor.  Now that the game is a few months old and money is in great abundance, can you immagine all the newbies running around in magic player made armor?  It would be sickening.<br/>

Enchanted sheet metal. That is something that I have hoped for, for a long <br/>
time. Along with being able to make plate. I would hope that if they put it <br/>
in, that all armor could have magic stats on it. Plate being able to have the <br/>
best, like plat is for jewelcraft.<br/>
