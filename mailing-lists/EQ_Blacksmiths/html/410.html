<div id="ygrps-yiv-185540118">Sorry no one will group with you.  Enchanters are a very powerful class.<br/>
While you do share the buffs with Shamans, your debuffs spells are the best<br/>
in the game.  Not to mention your illusion spells allow you to walk into any<br/>
city and not be KOS.  Enchanters are powerful, especially in a group where<br/>
their abilities will shine.<br/>
<br/>
I still say that not all magical item creation should be dependent on the<br/>
enchanter though.  Yes, enchanters should be used to create most magical<br/>
items, especially the more powerful ones.  If a tailor just wanted to create<br/>
poison resistance armor, why couldn&#39;t he or she just fashion it out of<br/>
snakeskin and use the inherent properties from that?  A Fletcher could use<br/>
special feathers of a creature on a arrow to increase it&#39;s distance, or a<br/>
smith could use a lightstone in a tunic to give it light radius.  Simple<br/>
magical items such as these should not require an enchanter.<br/>

&gt; An<br/>
&gt; abiltity like this would make others see us as useful.  I have 2<br/>
&gt; characters a DE Warrior and a DE Enchanter.  As the warrior I have no<br/>
&gt; problem with groping (get asked all the time).  When Im an enchanter I<br/>
&gt; rarely get asked and when I do its by people who do not know what class<br/>
&gt; I am, and then the offer is recinded when they figure out that I am an<br/>
&gt; Enchanter.  I have had people people ask what class I was and then just<br/>
&gt; stop talking to me when they found out what class I actully was<br/>
&gt; (originally thaught I was a Cleric </span></blockquote></div>
