<b>Subject:</b> Blacksmithing (102) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-128391964">This is the third message about how I am<br/>
increasing my blacksmithing skill, right now<br/>
it stands as 102 (Master).<br/>
<br/>
I believe in my last message I was at skill 66.<br/>
At that point I was doing lanterns which quickly<br/>
became trivial at 68 along with Studs, Sheet<br/>
Metal, Cookie Cutters and Large Containers.<br/>
<br/>
Since I successfully created a piece of Sheet<br/>
Metal I decided to attempt a banded gorget at<br/>
level 68 and was successful!!  My first piece<br/>
of banded is now fastened securely around my<br/>
neck.<br/>
<br/>
After this I decided to finally start doing<br/>
skewers since they only cost 226cp for each<br/>
attempt and next higher cost non-trivial item,<br/>
Sewing Kit, costs 576cp per attempt.  I started<br/>
getting a decent success rate and my skill level<br/>
was rising in about the same fashion as the other<br/>
items I was creating.  Also about every<br/>
10 skill points I would attempt to make the<br/>
other items to see if they had become trivial.<br/>
Unfortunately some of the items require ceramic<br/>
lining, a pottery skill, so I had to start<br/>
working on my pottery (it rose from 1 to 8 :).<br/>
The only thing that has become trivial from 68<br/>
to 102 is Steel Boning.  During this period I<br/>
spent a total of around 55pp.  This includes<br/>
around 5pp for pottery and I kept the<br/>
metal cooking items for increasing my cooking<br/>
trade skill which amounts to about 6pp in sell<br/>
back costs.  An additional 10pp was spent doing<br/>
the attempts to find the trivial levels for<br/>
the other items that resulted in failure.  So,<br/>
if I just stuck to doing skewers it would be<br/>
around 34pp.  This brings my total to around<br/>
100pp to get to this level or about 1pp per<br/>
skill point.  I should mention that the character<br/>
is a human warrior that put all his extra points<br/>
into strength and stamina.<br/>
<br/>
So to summarize:<br/>
<br/>
Legend<br/>
&lt;= means that it became trivial at this level,<br/>
   but it could be sooner<br/>
== became trivial at this skill level<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; trivial level is somewhere above this level<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sharpening Rusty Daggers == 20/21<br/>
Metal Bits == 20/21<br/>
File == 20/21<br/>
Scaler == 41<br/>
Small Container &lt;= 41<br/>
Medium Container &lt;= 41<br/>
Lantern == 68 (it creates a large lantern)<br/>
Cookie Cutter &lt;= 68 (I only did the Animal shape<br/>
   so I assuming the other shapes are the same)<br/>
Large Container &lt;= 68<br/>
Sheet Metal &lt;= 68<br/>
Studs &lt;= 68<br/>
Steel Boning &lt;= 88<br/>
Skewers &gt; 101<br/>
Muffin Tin &gt; 101<br/>
Pie Tin &gt; 101<br/>
Cake Round &gt; 101<br/>
Bread Tin &gt; 101<br/>
Smoker &gt; 101<br/>
Pot &gt; 101<br/>
Sewing Kit &gt; 101 (it creates a small sewing kit)<br/>
Folded Sheet Metal ??? (haven&#39;t attempted)<br/>
<br/>
I did do successful attempts of all non-trivial<br/>
items at a skill level of 101.  I just happened<br/>
to have an increase to 102 on the last item<br/>
I made, a Sewing Kit.<br/>
<br/>
I have successfully made all the items in the<br/>
Basic Blacksmithing book except for Lockpicks<br/>
(could not find the mold), Toolbox (the recipe<br/>
is bugged), and Folded Sheet Metal (too<br/>
expensive to try yet).<br/>
<br/>
As for banded, I did successfully make another<br/>
banded gorget on the first attempt at level 101<br/>
but it was not trivial.  I have not attempted any<br/>
other banded items yet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to put this character aside for a while<br/>
to work on others, so it might be a week before<br/>
I get back to blacksmithing.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any advanced blacksmiths out there that<br/>
could give us an idea of when the banded items<br/>
become trivial?<br/>
