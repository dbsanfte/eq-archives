<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995465212">Not part of MY game... Some people are so into *making level xx* that I<br/>
think they lose site of the rest of the game...  I have several friends and<br/>
aquaintenances (god I know I spelled that wrong!) that are higher levels<br/>
than I am because they play more... But I get more of a charge out of<br/>
helping the LOWER level people to &#39;level up&#39; than leveling up myself...<br/>
Some see this too as &#39;twinking&#39;, but I am doing it for someone else, not<br/>
myself (or any of my characters).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t do this by giving them the best armor for free (hey, it cost me<br/>
money to make/buy/find) or weapons or any other &#39;loot&#39;... I do help by<br/>
healing them when they need it (gee, I do that with the higher levels too)<br/>
and letting them pull mobs that are too low for exp for me, but are still<br/>
blue or white to them...  Sometimes, I won&#39;t even group with them, but<br/>
rather just stand by for a heal if they need it (they always do)<br/>
<br/>
But in MY game of EQ there is no &#39;twinking&#39; and I hope never really will<br/>
be...<br/>
<br/>
After all, the object is to QUEST and ADVENTURE, not just &quot;LEVEL UP&quot; on a<br/>
daily basis...<br/>
