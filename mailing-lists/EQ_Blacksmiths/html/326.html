<div id="ygrps-yiv-72711774">I&#39;ll try to respond to Scott and Dennis at the same time.  This will be a<br/>
long read.  You&#39;ve been warned. :)<br/>
<br/>
I will agree wholeheartedly that time is money.  If I had not spent the time<br/>
that I did smithing, I would be 10 levels higher with probably the same nice<br/>
equipment I have now.  But, I like smithing, I like interacting with the<br/>
community, and I like the nice items I am able to now buy.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s get something else out of the way as well.  Price fixing is never<br/>
going to work.  There are 50+ master smiths per server, with a new one<br/>
becoming a master smith every day.  Price fixing just won&#39;t happen unless<br/>
you can get a majority of the smiths together and hope that they are all<br/>
intelligent enough to understand that selling less at a more expensive price<br/>
is good.<br/>
<br/>
The only feasible way of price fixing, which I practice occasionally, is to<br/>
collude with a fellow smith in the area.  If I am selling armor in greater<br/>
faydark and another smith starts selling, I sometimes (depending on their<br/>
attitude) price fix with them so we don&#39;t end up screwing eachother.  In the<br/>
end, we both make out because the consumers are forced to buy from one of<br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
To kurt: Good for you!  Too bad you can&#39;t be everywhere on every server at<br/>
once.  So, the people that are buying from you are making out, but, that&#39;s<br/>
only one small corner of your server&#39;s market.<br/>
<br/>
To Nick: I disagree, we have lots to lose.  We have a customer base and a<br/>
reputation.  If we start jacking our prices, our reputation is going to go<br/>
down the drain.  Believe it or not, word of mouth is a big contribution to<br/>
sales.  If this little plan fails, it may take a while to recover that lost<br/>
reputation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t know why everyone is griping about not making enough money to<br/>
recuperate their initial costs.  I recovered my inital investment in the<br/>
first couple of days.  Perhaps the area you&#39;re selling in is not a very<br/>
popular banded area.  I sell in greater faydark and it&#39;s excellent.  GFay<br/>
offers many things that I love.<br/>
<br/>
1.  I am in reach of two sizes of molds, small and medium, which allows me<br/>
to sell to two groups of players increasing my customer base by 50% (Elves<br/>
prefer small, and there are not THAT many humans, barbarians, or<br/>
half-elves.)<br/>
<br/>
2. I don&#39;t have to zone to use a bank, which means I don&#39;t have to carry my<br/>
wares on me, which means unlimited access to my supplies without zoning.<br/>
<br/>
3. It is home to two races and adjacent to two more races.  A huge plus in<br/>
customer base.<br/>
<br/>
4. Perhaps the biggest reason of all, it is home to a HUGE level range.<br/>
Because of Crushbone, most elves, dwarves, and gnomes migrate to the<br/>
Crushbone area starting at level 5 and stay there throughout their early<br/>
teens.  At level 5, they see me advertising my armor.  Over the next three<br/>
days, they gain levels and money and continuously see me advertise my armor.<br/>
When they finally gain enough money, they put two and two together and ask<br/>
me for their banded armor.<br/>
<br/>
Phew, I&#39;m exhausted, gonna go sell some more banded. ;)<br/>
