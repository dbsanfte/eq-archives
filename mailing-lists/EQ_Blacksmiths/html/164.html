&gt; I just thought I would throw my oppinion into the mixx.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have to agree that I think price fixing is wrong.  I do like having a<br/>
&gt; rough idea of a standard price that the majority as a whole charges.  If<br/>
&gt; someone wants to go lower thats their right.  The problem I see is that EQ<br/>
&gt; is totally unlike the Real world in Economics.  If I bring a piece of ring<br/>
&gt; mail to an NPC vendor I get more money from them than I get for bringing<br/>
&gt; them a better quality piece of banded mail.  Thats just stupid on the AI<br/>
&gt; side of the NPCs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Suposidly in the big update wthat Verant will be releasing in 6 to 9+<br/>
&gt; months, they say that they will be doing a major revamp of trade skills to<br/>
&gt; make them so they don&#39;t suck.  I certainly hope better pricing<br/>
&gt; for items is<br/>
&gt; included in that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, untill that time comes, and it is a while away, its every players<br/>
&gt; right to sell or give items away at what ever price they want to sell them<br/>
&gt; for.  Even if they want to take a loss on the product.  Perhapse they feel<br/>
&gt; that they can gain skill faster by selling their product for below cost<br/>
&gt; (yet more than NPCs will give) as a suplement to their continued skill<br/>
&gt; training.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for the prices that were listed as being seen on the fennin ro server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Banded Tunic : 20pp<br/>
&gt; &gt;banded cloak : 20pp<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sleeves: 10pp<br/>
&gt; &gt;helm: 10-12pp<br/>
&gt; &gt;boots: 10pp<br/>
&gt; &gt;bracer: 8-10pp (seen go as low as 5pp a piece)<br/>
&gt; &gt;legs: 10-12<br/>
&gt; &gt;mask: 10pp<br/>
&gt; &gt;gorget: 8-10pp<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All I can say is look around some more.  I was online last night in<br/>
&gt; Freeport and saw someone selling for the following<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Banded Tunic : 15pp<br/>
&gt; banded cloak : 15pp<br/>
&gt; Sleeves: 5pp<br/>
&gt; helm: 5pp<br/>
&gt; boots: 4pp<br/>
&gt; bracer: 4pp<br/>
&gt; legs: 5pp<br/>
&gt; mask: 4pp<br/>
&gt; gorget: 3pp<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was stunned to say the least.  But, back to my original theme.  It is<br/>
&gt; their right to sell at below cost prices.  There isn&#39;t much anyone can do<br/>
&gt; to stop them.<br/>
