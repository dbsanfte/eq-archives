<b>Subject:</b> Increasing your skill <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195754556">Hi, I subscribe to the digest so I can&#39;t really<br/>
respond accordingly but I just wanted to mention<br/>
to those aspiring master blacksmiths (myself<br/>
included) that making skewers at an early skill<br/>
level is a really, really, really bad idea.<br/>
After bits become trivial the next thing you<br/>
should make it scalers.  This will become trivial<br/>
at 41 (along with small and medium containers<br/>
and maybe a few others things, I haven&#39;t checked<br/>
them all).  After that became trivial for me,<br/>
I started on lanterns, my skill is now 49 and<br/>
I have maybe spent 40pp total to get this far.<br/>
Also I should mention that I sharpened the rusty<br/>
daggers I got while increasing my fishing skill<br/>
instead of making metals bits until it became<br/>
trivial, which is the same skill level that metal<br/>
bits and files became trivial.<br/>
<br/>
The basic premise to increase your skill it to<br/>
make things a great many times.  To do this you<br/>
need to take into account the cost of making<br/>
an item so you can make more things for your<br/>
money.  What I did was take all the blacksmithing<br/>
recipes and calculated the cost to make each<br/>
item then started making the cheapest thing<br/>
until it became trivial then move up to the<br/>
next higher priced item.  For example, to make<br/>
a metal bit it costs 1g 2s 5c (two bricks and<br/>
water), but only it only costs 1s 5c (the selling<br/>
price of a rusty dagger and a sharpening stone)<br/>
to attempt an increase in the blacksmithing skill<br/>
before level 21, which would you prefer? I<br/>
believe the game is set up this way for skill<br/>
progression, based on my own experiences in<br/>
fletching (83) and from talking with experts in<br/>
jewelry making.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I think a lot of people are reading<br/>
EQstratics and EQvault to get their blacksmithing<br/>
trade information which just says &quot;make skewers&quot;<br/>
until you get a really high skill level then<br/>
make banded.  All you are going to do is waste<br/>
hard earned money.   Start looking at the smaller<br/>
web sites for the real information instead of<br/>
just the big two with their scanty, incomplete,<br/>
beta test (and IMHO worthless) information about<br/>
trade skills.<br/>
