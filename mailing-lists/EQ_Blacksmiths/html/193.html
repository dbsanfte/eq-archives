<div id="ygrps-yiv-510973440">I actually paid less for my banded in quenos because the demand there was<br/>
lower.  Everyone in Freeport was ooc ing for banded.  In Quenos, I was the<br/>
only one at the time trying to get it.  I did not know that Shamans and<br/>
Necromancers had a spell that moved items.  I have never heard of anyone<br/>
bartering for this.  A Shaman could make a lot of money by moving ore to<br/>
people in Quenos.  I still cannot believe that ore can not be found in<br/>
Quenos and yet they have Ironforge Estate.  What is he using to make his<br/>
weapons ?    I understand that the closest place to get ore is from a NPC<br/>
in front of a mine entrance near Highpass.  Can anyone verify this ?<br/>
<br/>
Thank You,<br/>
