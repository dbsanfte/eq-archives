<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028490285">Ok, what exactly happened in the patch yesterday? I went to make a suit of<br/>
banded and when I clicked on the forge it now has 10 slots! Did they add<br/>
something and not tell us? What is out there that needs 10 slots to create?<br/>
Is this just part of the Paladin armor quest I have been reading about? I<br/>
looked all over several cities to see if any new molds were there and found<br/>
nothing. If anybody knows the reasoning behind this, please post.<br/>
