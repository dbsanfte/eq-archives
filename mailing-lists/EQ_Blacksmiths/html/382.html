<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938323572">&lt;SNIP&gt;should hope so, its what our class does! what next? Take away damage<br/>
bonuses for str to fighters cause it might make them the best melee<br/>
class in the game? &lt;END SNIP&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What damage bonuses to Warriors from strength... Warriors have nothing<br/>
special from stength... Only thing strength affects is the ability to hit<br/>
maximum damage with your weapon (at above 20th level I hear). 150 str and 75<br/>
str still do the same raneg of damage.... HAd to throw that in the bucket of<br/>
complaints...<br/>
