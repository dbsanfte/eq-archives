&gt; Subject: What happened to the forge?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, what exactly happened in the patch yesterday? I went to make a suit of<br/>
&gt; banded and when I clicked on the forge it now has 10 slots! Did they add<br/>
&gt; something and not tell us? What is out there that needs 10 slots to create?<br/>
&gt; Is this just part of the Paladin armor quest I have been reading about? I<br/>
&gt; looked all over several cities to see if any new molds were there and found<br/>
&gt; nothing. If anybody knows the reasoning behind this, please post.<br/>
