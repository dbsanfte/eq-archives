<b>Subject:</b> Difficulty of various banded pieces <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382628076">Hello everyone... <br/>
<br/>
Is there a site somewhere that has a ranked list of which banded pieces<br/>
are the most difficult?  <br/>
<br/>
My smithing is 96, and I have been able to make all pieces except cloak,<br/>
legs and belt easily.<br/>
<br/>
The cloak and legs I had heard were very difficult, but the belt?  Is it<br/>
supposed to be hard?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Jyzan</div>
