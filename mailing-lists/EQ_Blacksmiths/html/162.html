<b>Subject:</b> Re: Price Fixing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719967239">I just thought I would throw my oppinion into the mixx.<br/>
<br/>
I have to agree that I think price fixing is wrong.  I do like having a<br/>
rough idea of a standard price that the majority as a whole charges.  If<br/>
someone wants to go lower thats their right.  The problem I see is that EQ<br/>
is totally unlike the Real world in Economics.  If I bring a piece of ring<br/>
mail to an NPC vendor I get more money from them than I get for bringing<br/>
them a better quality piece of banded mail.  Thats just stupid on the AI<br/>
side of the NPCs.<br/>
<br/>
Suposidly in the big update wthat Verant will be releasing in 6 to 9+<br/>
months, they say that they will be doing a major revamp of trade skills to<br/>
make them so they don&#39;t suck.  I certainly hope better pricing for items is<br/>
included in that.<br/>
<br/>
However, untill that time comes, and it is a while away, its every players<br/>
right to sell or give items away at what ever price they want to sell them<br/>
for.  Even if they want to take a loss on the product.  Perhapse they feel<br/>
that they can gain skill faster by selling their product for below cost<br/>
(yet more than NPCs will give) as a suplement to their continued skill<br/>
training.<br/>
<br/>
As for the prices that were listed as being seen on the fennin ro server.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Banded Tunic : 20pp <br/>
&gt;banded cloak : 20pp <br/>
&gt;Sleeves: 10pp <br/>
&gt;helm: 10-12pp <br/>
&gt;boots: 10pp <br/>
&gt;bracer: 8-10pp (seen go as low as 5pp a piece) <br/>
&gt;legs: 10-12 <br/>
&gt;mask: 10pp <br/>
&gt;gorget: 8-10pp<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All I can say is look around some more.  I was online last night in<br/>
Freeport and saw someone selling for the following<br/>
<br/>
Banded Tunic : 15pp <br/>
banded cloak : 15pp <br/>
Sleeves: 5pp <br/>
helm: 5pp <br/>
boots: 4pp <br/>
bracer: 4pp <br/>
legs: 5pp <br/>
mask: 4pp <br/>
gorget: 3pp<br/>
<br/>
I was stunned to say the least.  But, back to my original theme.  It is<br/>
their right to sell at below cost prices.  There isn&#39;t much anyone can do<br/>
to stop them.<br/>
