<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701161365">Your model is wrong.  Ore, free?  What the hell are you thinking?  First,<br/>
it&#39;s free if you kill a creature that drops it (not worth time).  Second,<br/>
ore isn&#39;t needed for making armor.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as for molds.  Since you used a tunic in your letter, I will use it as<br/>
well.  A Tunic molds costs over 1pp.  It requires 3 metal sheets, all of<br/>
which also cost over 1pp.  Then the water, at a palsy 1sp or so.<br/>
<br/>
I sell my tunics at 17pp.  I consider this a fair price, and many else have<br/>
agreed with me (as I have sold many many many for this price).  How can you<br/>
say it&#39;s a bit steep?  It is MY choice to sell for the price that I see fit.<br/>
It is not up to you to decide how much I feel my time is worth.<br/>
<br/>
On any account, there will (for the most part) always be a flow, if not<br/>
constant, for banded.  Seeing as how new people begin the game, or old<br/>
people create new characters (that are not always twinked mind you), we will<br/>
have other&#39;s to sell to.<br/>

&quot;With how little weight I can carry, you damn well better appreciate this<br/>
armor!  Hehehe&quot;</div>
