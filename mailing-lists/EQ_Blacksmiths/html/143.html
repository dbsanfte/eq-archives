<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359704384">I don&#39;t understand the price fixing.  Is this the Microsoft Smithing Alliance?  No, didn&#39;t think so.  And I&#39;m not letting some self reichous group deturmine how much or how little profit I should make per piece of armor.  And I&#39;ve been told by various other smiths that if I don&#39;t raise my prices to match theirs they are going to put me on some blacksmith black list.  Which is really kinda pathetic, people are threatening to blackball me because I offer the same product (actually better since I make small and its lighter) at a lower price than they are willing to sell for.  Not to mention once you hit about 25th lvl, the money really isn&#39;t important, very few people actually sell items these days so I havn&#39;t needed money for anything in a long time, other than to dump into my smithing hobby.</div>
