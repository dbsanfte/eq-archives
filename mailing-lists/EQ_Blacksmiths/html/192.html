<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004102825">Personally, I don&#39;t have a problem with Twinkies. I&#39;ll probably do it myself<br/>
when my warrior reaches high level. Actually, I gave my roommate (a 5th<br/>
level Shaman) 2 onyx earrings, two pieces of banded, spiked collar, two<br/>
cutthroat rings, and a snakeskin tunic just last Wednesday. People I hang<br/>
with sometimes have a problem with it. I was with a 18th level Wizard that<br/>
ran up to a 3rd level wizard (with a FBR on) and said &quot;DUEL ME!&quot;.<br/>
Heh...kinda funny. I do think it takes a bit out of the challenge of the<br/>
game, and I get on it sometimes that *I* had to work so hard to get where<br/>
I&#39;m at (noone gave me anything), but this soon goes away cuz they obviously<br/>
played ALOT more than me if they can equip a 3rd level character with a FBR<br/>
and other good eq and start anew. And, Verant said, if I remember correctly,<br/>
that THEY have a problem with it. I don&#39;t know that they said they would do<br/>
anything about it, but they said they look down on it. And no, I have no<br/>
clue where I saw that...heh.<br/>
<br/>
Just me 2 coppers.<br/>

Also put yourself in &quot;real life&quot;. If I can help a friend, I do. I don&#39;t feel<br/>
there&#39;s anything wrong with helping other people, or yourself.<br/>

&gt; Out of curiousity, what is your problem with twinking? How does twinking<br/>
&gt; degrade your play and or fun? How does it prevent you from doing<br/>
&gt; leveling, completing quests, goofing off? If the gear was on a level 50<br/>
&gt; PC, how is this better than a level 1 PC?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just curious, cause personally, I think telling people what they can and<br/>
&gt; cannot do with items they own is silly in the first place, and I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; never noticed any lessening of my enjoyment of the game due to some<br/>
&gt; twinking. Well, I&#39;ve thought to myself &quot;Garsh, it&#39;d sure be nice if *I*<br/>
&gt; had that...&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Joint bank accounts wouldn&#39;t be that great of an idea... For<br/>
&gt; the reasons you<br/>
&gt; &gt; stated, it would, but it would be abused too easily to help<br/>
&gt; *twink* another<br/>
&gt; &gt; character up...<br/>
