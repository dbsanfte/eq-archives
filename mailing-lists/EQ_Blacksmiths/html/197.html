<b>Subject:</b> About joint banks and advanced smithing guide <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231061764">Joint banks would probably make trades more desirable.  For instance a<br/>
tailor and smith sharing their account and making it MUCH easier for the<br/>
tailor to get to his metal bonings and/or studs.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why Verant won&#39;t do it =)  It&#39;ll make something easier heheh.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone found the advanced smithing guides if there are any?  I don&#39;t<br/>
mean the armor and weapons or the basic smithing ones.  But ANY others<br/>
locations would be appreciated.</div>
