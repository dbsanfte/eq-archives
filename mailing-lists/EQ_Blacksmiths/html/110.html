<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418901948">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
Having recently taken up this hobby that is more expensive than crack<br/>
and harder on your wrists than being a professional flyswatter, I have<br/>
several quesitons that hopefully some of you can answer:<br/>
<br/>
1) What determines how hard a particular piece of armour is?  Is price<br/>
of the mold a good indicator?  Is there a table of this anywhere?<br/>
<br/>
2) Where can banded molds be purchased for each size?  I know you can<br/>
buy medium in Freeport, small in Kelethin and large somewhere like Grobb<br/>
or Oggok, but there surely must be more.  Any help is appreciated,<br/>
particularly for large molds in a place non-evil characters can visit<br/>
and small molds on the continent of Antonica.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Jyzan</div>
