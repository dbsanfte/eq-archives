<div id="ygrps-yiv-320404940">The problem with fixing prices is that there are not enough smiths on this<br/>
list.  There may be 20 spread out over 20 servers.  Whoopee.   IF this<br/>
mailing list was legitimate, then fixing prices would work. (Would the EQ<br/>
government get on our case for collusion?  hehe.)<br/>
<br/>
I tend to sell my banded for fair prices.  The market in greater faydark<br/>
(Fennin Ro) is steady.  There are the occasional low-priced sellers, but<br/>
they&#39;re almost never a smith; probably some warrior who just got himself a<br/>
bronze breastplate.  I generally stay around and sell armor for an hour or<br/>
two and make around 100pp.<br/>
<br/>
Believe it or not, smithing is still lucrative, albeit not as good as when a<br/>
server first starts.  The real profit is made from items like boots, helms,<br/>
sleeves, pants, and tunics.  Boots cost about 3pp to make and I sell them<br/>
for 10pp consistently, and they&#39;re easy to make.  Pants and tunics are easy<br/>
for me as well (skill 134) I sell them for three times their cost (16pp and<br/>
18pp, respectively).  I tend to scowl at masks and belts because they cost 2<br/>
metal sheets and I can only sell them for 5pp and 7pp, respectively.<br/>
