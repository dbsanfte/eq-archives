(shrug) I enjoy this game a lot, and that means I (gasp, here&#39;s the<br/>
kicker boys) think about it.  Thoughts are more than single sentence<br/>
statements.<br/>
<br/>
But go ahead and flame, you will anyway.  We&#39;ll see who&#39;s right in<br/>
another month or two; I predict that servers with uber smiths charging<br/>
low prices will see only a few smiths left after a few weeks.  If you<br/>
want the validating evidence as to this position, read that post you<br/>
lost interest in and wandering off to watch WWF in the middle of.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really a shame, I was looking forward to playing a smith too; but<br/>
why should I bother if I&#39;ll only make a gold over costs?  I continue,<br/>
however, to hold out hope that Verdant will fix the trade skills, and<br/>
make them work as they should (platemail, weaponsmithing, cloth armor,<br/>
etc...)<br/>
