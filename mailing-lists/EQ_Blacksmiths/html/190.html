<div id="ygrps-yiv-441760979">Yeah they took care of twinking to a certain degree. Granted having Banded<br/>
Mail at 1st level would certainly help you. However at 1st level your<br/>
Offense and Defense are low, as is your weapon skill. Believe it our not, it<br/>
doesn&#39;t make a huge difference.<br/>

&gt; It would take you several days to get up to 10th level, regardless of what<br/>
&gt; armor or weapons you have.  AC on a twinked character, even if he/she is<br/>
&gt; wearing banded, is still not very high until you get to a higher<br/>
&gt; level.  You<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be able to fight red MOBs very much, because even though<br/>
&gt; you have a<br/>
&gt; FS Longsword, your 1h slashing skill might only be 30.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Joint bank accounts wouldn&#39;t be that great of an idea... For the<br/>
&gt; &gt; reasons you<br/>
&gt; &gt; stated, it would, but it would be abused too easily to help<br/>
&gt; &gt; *twink* another<br/>
&gt; &gt; character up...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think you would start seeing even more (there already are some) lower<br/>
&gt; &gt; level characters wearing the best armor and having the best weapons that<br/>
&gt; &gt; money can buy because they are &#39;sharing&#39; those items with the &#39;other&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt; player...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In other words:  I have a level 18 character that has all banded<br/>
&gt; &gt; armor and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Combine Staff - I put it into the bank, log out, log back on as a NEW<br/>
&gt; &gt; character that is level 1... he puts on the armor, grabs the<br/>
&gt; staff, and in<br/>
&gt; &gt; just a few hours he is up to level 10!  Not worrying much about getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; killed off because his AC is around 300 or so!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; No, no sharing of accounts...  BUT, I WOULD like to see some way<br/>
&gt; &gt; for GUILDS<br/>
&gt; &gt; to have a &#39;seperate&#39; account (for officers) to make it easier to<br/>
&gt; &gt; handle the<br/>
&gt; &gt; income and outlay of the guilds...<br/>
