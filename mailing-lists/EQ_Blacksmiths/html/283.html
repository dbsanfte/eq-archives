<b>Subject:</b> Unfinished Blade Mold <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331686071">I just recently turned in one of the task master earrings to the Dwarven smith in CB.  He rewarded me with an unfinished blade mold.  I am curious if this is a working item and if so were can I find information on how to use it?  I had hoped that he would tell me what I would need to use this item&#8230;but he said nothing.  I have a smithing skill of 110 and climbing so I am willing to bet that I can make something with it if it is working but I really hate to waste the time and money trying to make something when I know I will lose the mold if I try to make anything!  Please any hints or tips would be very very appreciated!!!<br/>

Thank you,<br/>
