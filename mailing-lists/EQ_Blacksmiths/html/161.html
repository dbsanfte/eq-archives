&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh, so do you think that the grocery store only charges you for the actual<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;cost of the product YOU are buying?  and not their &#39;losses&#39; from spoilage,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;theft, etc?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a.  I didn&#39;t say I sold at cost, do the math, a tunic cost way less than 15pp to make<br/>
b.  at the grocery store I&#39;m not being charged outrageous fees because farmer A can&#39;t produce as apples as efficiently as farmer B<br/>
c.  If I feel grocery store A is charging too much I go to grocery store B and buy the same merchandise at a lower price, so its up to grocer A to lower their prices to meet consumer need/want, not up to grocer B to raise their price to match the market &quot;standards&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;So yes, you do have to consider costs of failures too... If a &#39;client&#39; came<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;up to you with all the raw materials and said &quot;Make me a tunic and I will<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;give you 5pp.&quot; Would you tell them Okay without mentioning that it *might<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;not* work and they would be out the 5pp for the raw materials?  Or, if you<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;failed with their materials would you then use your own until you were able<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;to produce one for them?  This would be a bad thing for you if it did... But<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;if that is your thinking, then the heck with ME learning to smith, I am<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;going to start ordering stuff from you all the time!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t work like that, if someone came up to me and said they had the materials, I would offer to buy the materials, then charge them my normal price.  But that has never happened to me...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;In fact, please put me down for two tunics (I will sell one for 20pp and<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;mine will only cost 10), or better yet, make it FOUR!  I can get a discount<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;for multiples, right??  hehe... (let&#39;s see now, if I get them for 13pp each<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;x4=52 plat... I can sell 3 x20=60... I get mine free AND make 8 plat! All<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;without smithing!! Kewl!!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a.  I sell tunics for 15, you should read more carefully<br/>
b.  people like you make me sick.....you&#39;d take advantage of someone trying to do the community a favor (me) by buying my stuff cheap and selling at much higher prices for your own personal gain.  &quot;Screw thy fellow man&quot; must be your motto of life.<br/>
c.  You would get no such discount from me, infact I&#39;d probably charge you 40pp per tunic due to your own greed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Of course if I order more, you should give me an even BIGGER discount<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;because, after all, I am HELPING you to learn to be a better smith, right?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I generally don&#39;t give discounts on bulk purchases because either someone is trying to take advantage of my low prices, or they are trying to twink out their guild buddies.<br/>
