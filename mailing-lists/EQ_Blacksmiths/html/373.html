<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144743758">Enchanted sheet metal. That is something that I have hoped for, for a long <br/>
time. Along with being able to make plate. I would hope that if they put it <br/>
in, that all armor could have magic stats on it. Plate being able to have the <br/>
best, like plat is for jewelcraft.</div>
