<b>Subject:</b> Banded mold availability in Queynos Hills <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-461773190">I&#39;d like everyone who can to check out the small house on the road to Surefall Glade in Queynos Hills. The male vendor in the house SHOULD have a full complement of medium banded molds as well as sheet metal. Please post the results of your survey to the list. Apparently, the vendor in E&#39;ci has had his items replaced with the normal food/water/junk vending list. Tarew Marr server (sp?) supposedly still has the normal supplies on this guy, so maybe it&#39;s just E&#39;ci that&#39;s hosed? If your vendor doesn&#39;t have his molds and metal, immediately /petition a GM on your server to investigate the trouble. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
