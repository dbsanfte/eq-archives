<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226897483">I was online with a new smith the other day, and she didn&#39;t want to waste<br/>
her points, so she just bought a sharpening stone and started sharpening<br/>
weapons... She increased VERY fast (while we were talking she went from<br/>
level 1-15 in about 5 minutes!) and at the same time she was getting to keep<br/>
the stones many times too...  (she had saved lots of old daggers)<br/>
<br/>
She then started making bits and that was where I left her... She messaged<br/>
me about 10 min later to tell me she was already over 21 now and was<br/>
starting on files.<br/>
<br/>
So, you can increase very quickly now without having to put 20 points into<br/>
it... If you don&#39;t have lots of extra points to spend that is.<br/>
