<div id="ygrps-yiv-641261633">Ok as everyone else mentioned Neriak sounds like a good place to buy<br/>
supplies if your a DE, Troll, or Oger.<br/>
<br/>
If your looking to get some exp in the process and have some fun.  I know<br/>
that during the beta the Mudites in the Beholder zone sometimes gave ore as<br/>
treasure.  I was fighting them in a group of level 14+, and they were<br/>
hitting us HARD.  I&#39;d say get to about 16th to fight in Beholder and even<br/>
then watch out for the Gorge Minotaurs and evil eyes.<br/>
The Mudite&#39;s can blind and they hit pretty hard.  They have Elders that can<br/>
cast spells, and I have never seen them running around by themselves.<br/>
Always were in a group when I encountered them.<br/>
