&gt; I agree. Although I have actually been called a crook<br/>
&gt; for selling stuff at these prices. There is one guy on<br/>
&gt; Tunare that make and enitire suit minus the leggs for<br/>
&gt; 70 plat. It would be nice if I could actually make a<br/>
&gt; profit. The going price is 1plat per ac on Tunare =(<br/>
&gt; as we have only on the RARE occassion been able to<br/>
&gt; sell for anything higher then that without being<br/>
&gt; openly laughed at.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I like this idea alot.  If it became widespread, it<br/>
&gt; &gt; would once and for all<br/>
&gt; &gt; shut the mouths of the assholes out there trying to<br/>
&gt; &gt; tell you what you should<br/>
&gt; &gt; charge them for banded.  Lately, I&#39;ve been harassed<br/>
&gt; &gt; by people saying (lying<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually) that the going rate for banded is now 1pp<br/>
&gt; &gt; per AC and getting real<br/>
&gt; &gt; upset when I tell them no.  The other source of<br/>
&gt; &gt; misinformation comes to<br/>
&gt; &gt; these people when they buy a banded gorget for 2-3pp<br/>
&gt; &gt; from the wannabee<br/>
&gt; &gt; smiths that never get there skill much past 50 (you<br/>
&gt; &gt; people on E Marr near<br/>
&gt; &gt; Freeport know who I am talking about).  There are<br/>
&gt; &gt; perhaps 5 of us really<br/>
&gt; &gt; active in smithing on E Marr and I know 2 of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other people for sure.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll try to get in touch with them and see what they<br/>
&gt; &gt; think.  The prices<br/>
&gt; &gt; esposed on the site are about 1 to 2pp higher than I<br/>
&gt; &gt; charge now (5pp per<br/>
&gt; &gt; sheet needed to make an item, 15pp for cloaks).<br/>
