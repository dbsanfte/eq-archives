<div id="ygrps-yiv-592188493">Yeah forget what the book said and all that stuff.<br/>
 reread your FaQ and the &quot;official&quot; guide to EQ, magical weapons are<br/>
supposed to require the help of a high level enchanter and a master<br/>
smith, the one things we shouldn&#39;t need is to deal with a slimy little<br/>
dwarven smith or some such ;)<br/>
 as for &quot;would become the best class to make magical items.&quot; well I<br/>
should hope so, its what our class does! what next? Take away damage<br/>
bonuses for str to fighters cause it might make them the best melee<br/>
class in the game? or pickpockets from rogues cause it might make them<br/>
the best rogues in the game? heh, don&#39;t mess with us enchanters or<br/>
you&#39;ll regret it<br/>

&gt; Here is my 2 cents worth on this subject.  I say no to enchanters being able<br/>
&gt; to enchant ore for us.  I agree that the enchanters would become the best<br/>
&gt; class to make magical items.  Let them do what they do best and make pretty<br/>
&gt; jewelry for us to wear.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How can we make magical weapons and armor?  I like the idea of the mold.<br/>
&gt; Also maybe introduce special ore that can be used to make enchanted weapons<br/>
&gt; and armor.  Of course this ore would have to be dropped by creatures and not<br/>
&gt; bought from NPC&#39;s.  Or maybe combine different ingredients into the ore like<br/>
&gt; snakeskin for poison resistance, lightstones to give of light radius.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; use a combination of all the above to make unique or lore items, like a<br/>
&gt; special mold, magical ore, snakefang, and a lightstone to make a special<br/>
&gt; sword that causes poison and gives off a lightradius of a lightstone.<br/>
