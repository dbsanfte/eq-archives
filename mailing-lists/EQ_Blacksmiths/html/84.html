<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379519925">Here&#39;s some good questions and answers for every dark elf.<br/>
<br/>
Two ogre chicks in Foreign quarter have lots of molds.  File being one of<br/>
them.  Not sure about skewer or scaler though.<br/>
<br/>
Guy in 2nd level of Toadstool Inn sells armor molds not sure where weapon<br/>
molds are or .... really I&#39;ve not heard anything about making weapons so I<br/>
don&#39;t know anything about that. =)<br/>
<br/>
Ok what is better to make for skill improvement scalers or skewers?  If<br/>
there isn&#39;t one better then which is cheaper and where is it found in Neriak<br/>
if possible.<br/>
<br/>
And!  Does anyone know if intellect directly affects smithing skill gain<br/>
like it should affect most other skills.</div>
