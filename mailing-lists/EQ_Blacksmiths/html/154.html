&gt;You can get bottles in Freeport in the same<br/>
&gt;building you get the Molds but from another<br/>
&gt;NPC.  Most NPCs that sell bottles also sell<br/>
&gt;booze.  The bottles have the same icon as<br/>
&gt;red wine and are usually at the bottom of<br/>
&gt;their list of wares they normally sell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The lanterns themselves are exactly the same<br/>
&gt;as the large lanterns you can buy from NPCs.<br/>
<br/>

sells them, as well as Halas.</div>
