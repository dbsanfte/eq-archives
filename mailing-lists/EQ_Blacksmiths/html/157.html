&gt;Prices on banded should be at least as much as chain.  Smiths who sell lower<br/>
&gt;than that are doing a terrible disservice to their fellow smiths.  All<br/>
&gt;Verant needs to do to fix this problem is make merchants pay a reasonable<br/>
&gt;amount for smithed goods, then we wouldn&#39;t see stupid things like people<br/>
&gt;selling at or below cost.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hell no.  I don&#39;t agree with fixing, and I sure as hell don&#39;t agree with<br/>
anyone being told ever to sell at any price.  If they feel like taking a<br/>
loss, they can role-play it like they&#39;re helping the general good of the<br/>
populace or whatever they feel like, because it is, after all, their money<br/>
and their items.<br/>
<br/>
That aside, I agree 100% that the shops should pay more for hand-made<br/>
items.  If not that they&#39;re &quot;special&quot;. then that they&#39;re as good as the<br/>
ones you can buy in the shops, and should at least re-sell at 75% of the<br/>
price you&#39;d get for their equivalant item.</div>
