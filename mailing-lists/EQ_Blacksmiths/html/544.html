<div id="ygrps-yiv-695776383">Sadly, banded on E&#39;ci also sells for about 1pp per AC, mostly due to the efforts on &quot;Escapee&quot; I believe. What I&#39;d like to do is collect the stats on all pieces of bronze (total AC and total weight) and have that handy to give to the whiners who say &quot;But I can buy bronze for 2pp per AC, and it&#39;s better!&quot;. FACT: Banded is lighter. FACT: Banded is generally only one point of AC less per piece than bronze. I love watching these high elves loaded with full bronze trying to keep up with their guides. <br/>

Haniel: Got a loc for those mold vendors?  Also, have you checked the dwarf vendors in ButcherBlock just outside of Kelethin for molds? I always figured the woman should have some, as she&#39;s standing next to a NPC forge :)<br/>
<br/>
I checked the banded and misc. smithing vendors in Kelethin to see if they had any new molds, none detected. <br/>
