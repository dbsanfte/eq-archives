<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608181590">1) I would put in as many points as you can (Up till 21) to start.  It&#39;s<br/>
okay if you can only put in 14.<br/>
<br/>
2) Next, make Metal Bits until you have a bunch.  If you didn&#39;t put 21<br/>
points in at the beginning, you will reach 21 making Metal Bits.  Don&#39;t sell<br/>
them because you&#39;ll need them for everything except banded.<br/>
<br/>
3) Make scalers till 41.<br/>
<br/>
4) Make lanterns till 68.<br/>
<br/>
5) Make skewers till 90&#39;s.  Once you get to the 90&#39;s, you can make every<br/>
piece of banded except leggings and cloaks fairly well.  If you want to stop<br/>
for a bit and regain some cash, this is where I would do it.<br/>
<br/>
6) Keep making skewers till 115.<br/>
<br/>
7) Make pots till 122.<br/>
<br/>
8) Make sewing kits till 135.  Now, you can make every piece with ease.<br/>
<br/>
It took me about 75pp (I put in 17 points in the beginning) to get to skill<br/>
90.  It took me 2 days (About 7 hrs total playing time) to get there.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
