<div id="ygrps-yiv-850302455">I am guessing here but the closest town would probably be Freeport. Problem <br/>
is, that is a good town, and East Freeport is where you want to go. But can <br/>
not get there because of being evil. Maybe have a friend buy them, not sure <br/>
about the other Evil towns, have not seen them there either.<br/>
