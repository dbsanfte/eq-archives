<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325610137">Hmmm, I think I must apologize. I shot my mouth off too soon and now I feel <br/>
like a horses butt. There are NO sites out there, other than the one posted <br/>
that deal with trade skills in depth. Ya sure, there are trade skill guides <br/>
all over the place. But they are rarely updated and suck. That would be a <br/>
very cool thing is making a site where you have a team adding specific <br/>
detailed information for all the trade skills. Have a team for each one. That <br/>
I think could draw in a lot of traffic. Oh ya, what was that site again. Seem <br/>
to have lost it.<br/>
