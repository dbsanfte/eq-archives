&gt; &quot;...stupid things like selling below cost....&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So selling a tunic for 20pp is a BIG profit, for me that&#39;d be about 15pp<br/>
 </span></blockquote>profit.  Selling for 15pp is still a nice profit of about 10pp.  Taking any<br/>
more profit than that is pure greed.  So I&#39;ll continue to sell my tunic and<br/>
leggings for 15plat ea.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>people for your lack of skill?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, so do you think that the grocery store only charges you for the actual<br/>
cost of the product YOU are buying?  and not their &#39;losses&#39; from spoilage,<br/>
theft, etc?<br/>
<br/>
So yes, you do have to consider costs of failures too... If a &#39;client&#39; came<br/>
up to you with all the raw materials and said &quot;Make me a tunic and I will<br/>
give you 5pp.&quot; Would you tell them Okay without mentioning that it *might<br/>
not* work and they would be out the 5pp for the raw materials?  Or, if you<br/>
failed with their materials would you then use your own until you were able<br/>
to produce one for them?  This would be a bad thing for you if it did... But<br/>
if that is your thinking, then the heck with ME learning to smith, I am<br/>
going to start ordering stuff from you all the time!!<br/>
<br/>
In fact, please put me down for two tunics (I will sell one for 20pp and<br/>
mine will only cost 10), or better yet, make it FOUR!  I can get a discount<br/>
for multiples, right??  hehe... (let&#39;s see now, if I get them for 13pp each<br/>
x4=52 plat... I can sell 3 x20=60... I get mine free AND make 8 plat! All<br/>
without smithing!! Kewl!!)<br/>
<br/>
Of course if I order more, you should give me an even BIGGER discount<br/>
because, after all, I am HELPING you to learn to be a better smith, right?<br/>
