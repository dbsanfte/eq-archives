<div id="ygrps-yiv-309858494">Well, in the midst of all the flames, I wanted to make a friendly happy<br/>
sort of a post. Please, nobody argue with this, it would defeat the<br/>
entire purpose of this post. I won&#39;t even respond if this gets flamed,<br/>
and I would hope nobody else will either. Anyway, here goes:<br/>
<br/>
I just thought it&#39;d be a neat idea to have &#39;name tags&#39; on trade-made<br/>
products. Maybe not for cooking or brewing, as those items aren&#39;t meant<br/>
to last, but on generally anything else. Something in the status window<br/>
that says, &quot;made by: name&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t that just be neat? Buy a banded<br/>
tunic 6 months from now with one of your secondary characters and say,<br/>
&quot;hey! I made that!!&quot; I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s even possible for them to code<br/>
this, nor do I expect or really even want them to. I just think it&#39;s<br/>
kinda neat, that&#39;s all :) Too much coding for the effect it would<br/>
produce (or should I say lack of effect =P). Just, as I said, neat :)<br/>
