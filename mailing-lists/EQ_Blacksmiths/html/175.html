<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-959743310">Santa Barbara. Cool.. I lived in LA for a long time... but now I enjoy the<br/>
price of Gas in Nashville.  Actually the price is the same.. just the tax is<br/>
a lot lower. anyway...<br/>
<br/>
I dont mind a virtual Trade Union who trys to get prices to a &#39;more<br/>
profitable&#39; level to recoup some R&D cost, but if an independent wants to<br/>
try to come in and take the market with Low prices/High Volume... That fine<br/>
with me.. He still makes money.. I get cheap goods..<br/>
<br/>
Too bad all servers are not PvP.  The price fixers could start their own<br/>
virtual MOB!  You stay out of our market.. or... we send Bubba the Troll to<br/>
visit ya.<br/>

&gt; &gt; And BTW: the FTC doesn&#39;t seem to like price fixing much )<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That all depends on who you are...  Go to all the stores in your area and<br/>
&gt; check the price of milk!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then do the same with gasoline!  Price fixing is everywhere!  Where I live<br/>
&gt; (Santa Barbara), the CHEAPEST price for gasoline is $1.59 per gallon... Go<br/>
&gt; FARTHER away from the refineries to little old Lompoc (an extra 60 miles<br/>
&gt; away and 30 miles off the freeways) and the gas is only $1.39!!<br/>
&gt; Or, worse<br/>
&gt; yet, head to some southern states where the gasoline is only<br/>
&gt; $1.25 or so...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Price fixing is done by area and controlled by the markets themselves...<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s everywhere and on all sorts of products... the FTC is only interested<br/>
&gt; when they can get their names in the paper...<br/>
