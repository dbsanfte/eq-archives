<div id="ygrps-yiv-303423347">it&#39;s good, but simple items are expensive and complicated items are cheap. It<br/>
ends up evening out, but you&#39;ll eventually kill yourself by only selling the<br/>
cheap stuff. A helm for 10pp? The lowest I ever sold one was 12 plat, and that<br/>
was before I raised my prices :) Then, a gorget for 7pp? After I raised my<br/>
prices I sell them for 6 plat :) If a consumer gets smart, you will only be<br/>
selling your inexpensive items (bracers, helms, sleeves, belt, boots, leggings)<br/>
and the expensive items (cloaks, gorgets) won&#39;t sell at all. The rest will be<br/>
inbetween. The pricing list I&#39;ve been using (I posted it earlier, check the<br/>
archives) has worked excessively well. The closer together all of our prices<br/>
are, the more willing the consumers will be to buy for higher prices. If they<br/>
see a lot of varying prices, they&#39;ll want to shop around first (which is a<br/>
disaster if the cheap-o smith zones in while they&#39;re shopping). Let&#39;s try to get<br/>
as close to a specific price list as possible so we can avoid any possible<br/>
problems. I enjoy hearing &quot;yeah, that&#39;s a good price, I&#39;ll take it&quot; :)<br/>

&gt; Last night I began selling banded at my new prices.  They are as follows:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Gorgets 7pp<br/>
&gt; Bracers 5pp each<br/>
&gt; Masks 10pp<br/>
&gt; Helms 10pp<br/>
&gt; Sleeves 10pp<br/>
&gt; Mantles 12pp<br/>
&gt; Mail 17pp<br/>
&gt; Cloak 20pp<br/>
&gt; Belt 8pp<br/>
&gt; Boots 8pp<br/>
&gt; Leggings 15pp<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I started with 9pp on my body.  After 1 and a half hours, I had 215pp on me.<br/>
&gt; I had about 3 people decline my services.  The rest bought them.  I also<br/>
&gt; sell full sets at 130pp, and I sold 1 full set (of small armor, which was a<br/>
&gt; pain for me.  being in gfay, and having to run to BB to get the molds was a<br/>
&gt; bother).  Anyhow, I believe if we stick to these prices, which still seem to<br/>
&gt; sell well, we will do good.<br/>
