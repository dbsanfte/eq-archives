<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654913781">This is an interesting essay, however, I do not think it applies to EQ the<br/>
same as a real world market.  You see, in EQ, every single piece of banded<br/>
is the same.  Unlike in the real world, where Pepsi can claim their soda is<br/>
better than coke and offer bullshit reasons as to why.  Even though Coke may<br/>
be cheaper, some people prefer Pepsi and will pay the extra $.50.  In EQ,<br/>
everyone knows banded is banded so the ONLY thing that matters is price, not<br/>
quality.  You can&#39;t &quot;build a better mousetrap,&quot; because the traps are all<br/>
the same.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, you can train in multiple trade skills and offer say some cheap ring<br/>
if someone buys your banded, but, if the consumer is looking only for<br/>
banded, he will choose the lower price rather than the higher price with the<br/>
extra ring or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
If the armor market was more varied (say, enchanted sheet metal gives banded<br/>
different properties), then there could be quality competition as your<br/>
magical banded might be better thus sell for a higher price.  But, it<br/>
doesn&#39;t exist, so the only thing that plays a part in the EQ economy is<br/>
price.<br/>
