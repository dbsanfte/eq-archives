<div id="ygrps-yiv-545537991">capes still give me problems at skill 155. all the others I make about 90%<br/>
of the time.<br/>
<br/>
What I want to know about is this rumor of making weapons. Has anyone been<br/>
able to do so and if so please state where you found molds and/or<br/>
combinations to make some weapons.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to that is when will we be able to make plate? I heard that it<br/>
was coming with the next trade patch but when might that be?</div>
