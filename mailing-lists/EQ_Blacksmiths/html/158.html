<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-87843497">Early in beta I had talked to a real GM, not a guide, about the logic behind vendors and their pricing.  ie.  you sell a FS sword to a vendor you get 4p, you look back at the vendors inventory and they are selling for several hundred plat.  Another prime example, very late in p4, I sold my BBC to a vendor for a whopping 3pp, when I tried to buy it back, the vendor wanted almost 4000pp.  So anyways, the GM told me that the majority of items in the game were ment to be sold to players, not vendors, so vendors will only give you a fraction of what items are worth, then turn around and sell them at grosly exadurated prices.  Which seems all fine and dandy since that really promotes the supply and demand type market they are shooting for.  HOWEVER, when it comes to trade items, I really think they should make exceptions since nobody under about lvl 20 can really afford to take up a trade skill, and at which point you make better cash killing monsters than selling your wares. <br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents :)<br/>

&gt;Prices on banded should be at least as much as chain.  Smiths who sell lower<br/>
&gt;than that are doing a terrible disservice to their fellow smiths.  All<br/>
&gt;Verant needs to do to fix this problem is make merchants pay a reasonable<br/>
&gt;amount for smithed goods, then we wouldn&#39;t see stupid things like people<br/>
&gt;selling at or below cost.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hell no.  I don&#39;t agree with fixing, and I sure as hell don&#39;t agree with<br/>
anyone being told ever to sell at any price.  If they feel like taking a<br/>
loss, they can role-play it like they&#39;re helping the general good of the<br/>
populace or whatever they feel like, because it is, after all, their money<br/>
and their items.<br/>
<br/>
That aside, I agree 100% that the shops should pay more for hand-made<br/>
items.  If not that they&#39;re &quot;special&quot;. then that they&#39;re as good as the<br/>
ones you can buy in the shops, and should at least re-sell at 75% of the<br/>
price you&#39;d get for their equivalant item.<br/>
