<div id="ygrps-yiv-785162715">I payed for my mistakes the day I became a smith. Smithing is not profitable given the<br/>
current market standard. Go ahead and sell at your current prices and make 15 to 20<br/>
plat an hour. I&#39;ll be out buying the 200 and 300 plat items at the bazaar for the next<br/>
festival my guild is throwing with the profit we make (if you haven&#39;t read our guild<br/>
charter, I&#39;ll tell you now. All of the profits my &#39;greediness&#39; gets goes to holding<br/>
events on the E&#39;Ci server).<br/>
<br/>
There are two reasons to do any trade. To roleplay or to make money. I&#39;m not much of<br/>
an EQ roleplayer, if I want to do that, I&#39;ll have 10 people over and chuck dice for 7<br/>
hours. I&#39;ve done it before, it&#39;s fun... it&#39;s not EQ. I perform my trades to make money<br/>
and the last 6 times I&#39;ve decided to try smithing instead of my other skills I have<br/>
ALWAYS lost money on the market standard. In fact, no matter what my price, my<br/>
customer response is always the same. When I sold at truly ideal prices, I got the<br/>
same amount of customers and the same amount of people who wouldn&#39;t pay my price. When<br/>
I lowered the price, the customers didn&#39;t change. I didn&#39;t get any more people buying<br/>
from me, I didn&#39;t get any less. Instead, I lost money on my failures. I&#39;m supposed to<br/>
willingly lose money and watch a trade I spent quite a reserve of platinum mastering<br/>
go down the drain? Smithing was my first skill and I had to sell the armor off my back<br/>
to master it. I&#39;ve put in my dues and I expect to get something back for it. Just<br/>
because I want to get something for my efforts doesn&#39;t make me greedy. If you want to<br/>
see how greedy I am, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tradecouncil.eqrealms.com/events.html">http://tradecouncil.eqrealms.com/events.html</a> and take a<br/>
look at the events my guild is hosting. Notice... they are FREE! Go ahead and add up<br/>
the costs of all the items we&#39;re offering and see how much money I&#39;m losing. I&#39;m not<br/>
getting anything for that. I&#39;m doing it as a service to my server which has given me<br/>
the opportunity to make it where I am today.<br/>
<br/>
This is NOT a flame. You go right ahead and sell for whatever you please, but it won&#39;t<br/>
solve anything. Everything I&#39;ve been saying is entirely my opinion, you have the right<br/>
to accept it or refuse it. I don&#39;t want to see another flame aimed at me calling me a<br/>
&#39;greedy asshole&#39; because I want to make something out of an expensive trade. It took a<br/>
LOT of work to earn the plat to master smithing at level 11 (that&#39;s when I started<br/>
trade skills, and smithing was my first as I said previously). No, I did not twink my<br/>
character. Rennin is my highest level character, still at level 11, being the merchant<br/>
that I created him to be. I didn&#39;t get help from any high-level friends, either. I<br/>
started from scratch and built myself up. If you want to know how, e-mail me, not the<br/>
list, I&#39;d be happy to tell you. I&#39;m not harboring any secrets, I didn&#39;t do anything<br/>
unusual, I worked for what I got. Don&#39;t go telling me I&#39;m greedy because I want to get<br/>
something for the work I&#39;ve done.<br/>

&gt; &gt; One thing everybody must learn, prices can ALWAYS go down and NEVER go up. Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; take never literally, though. We need to raise prices on banded. 7 for gorgets,<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8 for bracers, 11 for masks, 13 for helmets, 12 for sleeves, 12 for mantle, 20<br/>
&gt; &gt; for mail, 20 for cloak, 12 for belt, 19 for leggings, 11 for boots. These prices<br/>
&gt; &gt; give us significant profit on 100% success and help even out the profits for<br/>
&gt; &gt; when we fail. If ALL of us sell at these prices and stick to them (don&#39;t let<br/>
&gt; &gt; them drop you more than a plat), then the &#39;low priced&#39; banded sellers will be<br/>
&gt; &gt; very scarce indeed. Then you can see the &#39;wait an hour&#39; frustration on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; buyers end. If someone auctions they are willing to pay 5 plat for a banded<br/>
&gt; &gt; bracer for over an hour, they&#39;ll be frustrated enough to give up and pay the<br/>
&gt; &gt; damn 8 plat. If we have a set price that majority follows, then we will still<br/>
&gt; &gt; sell. While the discount smith might sell 10 gorgets at 2 and a half plat profit<br/>
&gt; &gt; each, we&#39;ll sell at LEAST 5 gorgets in the same amount of time for 5 and a half<br/>
&gt; &gt; plat profit each. They might be making 25 plat, but we&#39;re making 27.5 and have<br/>
&gt; &gt; less chances for a failure :) If we group together and work as one group of<br/>
&gt; &gt; dedicated smiths, we can only win. If we become bitter enemies over who has the<br/>
&gt; &gt; lowest price, the price war will just destroy us all. We will ruin the value of<br/>
&gt; &gt; smithing. NO MORE DISCOUNTS!!! :)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m sorry.. are you a moron?  Your plan won&#39;t work for shit.  You keep<br/>
&gt; your prices at what they are..  i will sell cheaper.. everyone will keep<br/>
&gt; coming to me.. i&#39;ll get plenty of practice and my smithing will continue<br/>
&gt; to raise.. and I&#39;ll make all the money while you sit all alone with your<br/>
&gt; overpriced shit.  People do NOT pay for failures.  They pay for the<br/>
&gt; product.  As a smith, you are supposed to supply people with a product.<br/>
&gt; You don&#39;t supply them with your failures.  Smithing is a profitable<br/>
&gt; business.. yes.  But it&#39;s the greedy assholes like you who try to make<br/>
&gt; other people pay for your lack of skill who ruin the trade.  Pay for<br/>
&gt; your own mistakes.<br/>
