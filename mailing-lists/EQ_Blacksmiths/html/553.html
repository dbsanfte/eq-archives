<div id="ygrps-yiv-589493697">The reason people differ on Lanterns vs Skewers is price.  Lanterns are<br/>
expensive but raise your level faster.  With Skewers, you wont gain very<br/>
fast and fail a lot, but they are cheaper to make.  You should probably test<br/>
it both way to see which you prefer.  It is going to be different for<br/>
everyone.  I say this because WIS, INT, and CHA all affect how many you<br/>
make, how fast you go up and how much it will cost.  I personaly think agree<br/>
with Paul&#39;s order to do things, but you should decide for yourself.<br/>

Here&#39;s the list I created in my journey to Master Smith:<br/>
<br/>
Sharpen weapons - 27<br/>
Scalars - 41<br/>
Lanterns - 70<br/>
Skewers - 115<br/>
Pots - 122<br/>
Sewing kits - 135<br/>
At this point, only Banded Mantles, Leggings and Cloaks raise my skill<br/>
<br/>
You musta been doing Scalars, because Skewers definately go trivial at 115.<br/>
If you have any other questions, let me know )<br/>

&gt; Could someone please help me remember what I should be making to advance<br/>
&gt; my BS<br/>
&gt; skill past 40?  Is it lamps or scalers?  Skewers just became trivial.<br/>
&gt; Sure would<br/>
&gt; appreciate some advice.<br/>
