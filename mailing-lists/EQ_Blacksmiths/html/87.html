<div id="ygrps-yiv-571519048">As par what information i found in different places i started with metal bits<br/>
(about 1/2p worth advanced me a point) till skill 21 i think. (i never trained as i<br/>
am saving training points [do not ask me why i don&#39;t know]) then i started on files<br/>
and studs and made 1 point after spending over 4p decided that was not even close to<br/>
worth it and found Scaler molds and started with them  they advanced my skill at<br/>
about 1p each cause the finished molds you can sell back at a minimal profit<br/>
(actually a loss i think because of the cost of pisces of ore) i stopped doing this<br/>
at skill 41 and was happy with my results (only problem i had was the confusing<br/>
molds were visually identical  so i wasted a few in my long trek from 22 to 41) now<br/>
i am making skewers and am loosing about 2p per point.  if this is the way it goes<br/>
oh well..  if not i would like a suggestion to what i should make  my skill is 44<br/>
intelligence is 70 and charisma of 115.  i see a pattern here as skill points cost double what<br/>
they did before. but i am ok with it as i hunt wisps for cash then purchase my<br/>
stuff to make.  is anything besides skewers going to raise my skill for less?  i<br/>
dislike that i fail 90 plus percent of the time and never am able to sell the<br/>
skewers back.<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps others with there smithing and i would like feedback on if anything<br/>
will advance me faster for less<br/>
