First of all, the RL name thing isn&#39;t meant to offend you. People call me<br/>
&#39;Nick&#39; all the time,<br/>
be it in e-mail, message boards, or whatever. It&#39;s my name, I don&#39;t really<br/>
care. If you do,<br/>
however, I&#39;ll respect that and stick to Cerran. I&#39;m not out to offend you,<br/>
I&#39;m just trying to<br/>
prove a point<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not especially known for banded on my server, I&#39;m at an equal platform<br/>
with everyone else.<br/>
If I can sell at a price, other people can too. So, when I sell at higher<br/>
prices, that proves<br/>
to other smiths that they can as well. Instead of undermining my price and<br/>
making less money<br/>
per sale, they can go to a different zone and sell for the same price I am.<br/>
Sales are out<br/>
there, and if the market isn&#39;t oversaturated then they always will be. Why<br/>
get less money and<br/>
contribute to market oversaturation at the same time? Both are negative<br/>
things to a smith.<br/>
Charging less money, we both lose, charging the same price, we both win. I<br/>
don&#39;t see how<br/>
somebody can justify competition between smiths as &#39;a good business<br/>
strategy&#39;. If they charge<br/>
the same price as me, they&#39;ll make more money than if they charged less!! I<br/>
make more money<br/>
since the price raise, it shouldn&#39;t be different for anyone else. As for new<br/>
smiths who<br/>
haven&#39;t mastered the trade yet, I have no idea where you&#39;re getting your<br/>
idea from. Why would<br/>
any reasonably intelligent person charge less for an item when they&#39;re in a<br/>
higher need for<br/>
money? This is what you&#39;re telling me. Since they need money, they will<br/>
charge a lower price.<br/>
Usually I put more logic into my arguments, but I can&#39;t even touch that<br/>
because it simply does<br/>
not make sense. Newer smiths would want to charge higher prices so they can<br/>
get more money so<br/>
they can spend more money on practicing their smithing! I&#39;m assuming that<br/>
every new smith on<br/>
this board is in favor of the price raise. If you&#39;re a new smith and you<br/>
aren&#39;t in favor of<br/>
price raising, frankly, you have your head shoved right up your ass. You&#39;re<br/>
ruining the market<br/>
you&#39;re just getting into by selling at lower prices, and you&#39;re making less<br/>
money now and in<br/>
the long run. There is no justification for that, it&#39;s just plain idiotic.<br/>

Unfortunately Nick you&#39;ve displayed your total lack of knowledge of how price<br/>
affects a supply and demand model.  If you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about,<br/>
it&#39;s the most basic model of economics.  Anyone who doesn&#39;t, I would suggest<br/>
you go find out.  So that you understand what the logic is behind your<br/>
competition driving their prices down in order to stimulate more demand for<br/>
their armor over yours.  You might also want to read up on the concept of<br/>
liquidity and how it affects one&#39;s business.  That might also explain the idea<br/>
of selling at a discount to raise cash.  Artificially setting prices does not<br/>
work.  Any smith with half a brain will know that if there are four &quot;smiths&quot;<br/>
in the same area that seem to be selling well at &lt;x&gt; price he/she can sell<br/>
better than them at a discount.  We wouldn&#39;t be having this discussion if<br/>
there weren&#39;t people already doing this that are affecting the market.  <br/>
