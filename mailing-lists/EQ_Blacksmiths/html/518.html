&gt; Subject: Is blacksmithing broke?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Everyone notice how last night all the other skills got some changes<br/>
 </span></blockquote>EXCEPT blacksmithing.  Oh well.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Any how.  I have a feeling blacksmithing is broke.  My skill is 126 or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>somewhere near there.  I can make all items with only a few failures.  (I<br/>
hate legs though, seem to fail a lot.)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have made well over 100 pieces of armor over the past couple of weeks,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and have not seen a single point of skill increase.  I didn&#39;t have any<br/>
problem getting skill up to 126 making all the standard stuff, then I start<br/>
making armor, and I get nothing.  My Int is about average 86.  I&#39;m thinking<br/>
that getting skill from making armor is broke.  Has anyone else seen this?<br/>
Also, I know some armor items are trivial, and I know I&#39;m not making a ton<br/>
of trivial armor items.  I&#39;ve made plenty of legs, mails, cloaks, mantles,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten skill from making armor several times.  The thing that is hard<br/>
to notice about doing armor is it seems like you are doing a LOT of armor,<br/>
and not getting anything, but generally, now that I think about it, I&#39;d do<br/>
hundreds of skewers at a time when I was raising my skill.  Either way it<br/>
isn&#39;t just smithing that is broken this way.  It took me 750 combines to get<br/>
5 fletching points this week.  That&#39;s at 3pp per combine.  These were<br/>
arrows, BTW.  That&#39;s 3750 arrows, and supposedly the chances of getting a<br/>
skill up were doubled since they went to 5 arrows a try.  Argh, that&#39;s a lot<br/>
of clicking.<br/>

blacksmithing in the works.<br/>
