<div id="ygrps-yiv-384975362">It would make people too mad. Having a nice piece of magic armor that took <br/>
forever to get disappear because it wore out. I don&#39;t like this idea, as it <br/>
would just make EQ more like Diablo and Ultima Online, which I hope they <br/>
would want to try and stay away from.</div>
