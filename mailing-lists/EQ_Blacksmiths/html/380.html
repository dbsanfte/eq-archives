<b>Subject:</b> Creating Magical Armor and Weapons <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-48980387">Here is my 2 cents worth on this subject.  I say no to enchanters being able<br/>
to enchant ore for us.  I agree that the enchanters would become the best<br/>
class to make magical items.  Let them do what they do best and make pretty<br/>
jewelry for us to wear.<br/>
<br/>
How can we make magical weapons and armor?  I like the idea of the mold.<br/>
Also maybe introduce special ore that can be used to make enchanted weapons<br/>
and armor.  Of course this ore would have to be dropped by creatures and not<br/>
bought from NPC&#39;s.  Or maybe combine different ingredients into the ore like<br/>
snakeskin for poison resistance, lightstones to give of light radius.  Maybe<br/>
use a combination of all the above to make unique or lore items, like a<br/>
special mold, magical ore, snakefang, and a lightstone to make a special<br/>
sword that causes poison and gives off a lightradius of a lightstone.<br/>
