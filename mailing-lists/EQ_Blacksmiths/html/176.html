<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445355986">This post was much better, the tone was even, you didn&#39;t rant a whole bunch,<br/>
and it didn&#39;t make me think, Man this guys a Complete Looser, when I read<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a short attention span, hell I spent 8-10 hours a day on this<br/>
game (and that is after work). But instead of going off on how things will<br/>
be, based on the RL market and all that I just move on.<br/>
<br/>
That is the great power of this game... If one thing is unsatifying you move<br/>
on to the next. You can kill monsters alone, kill them in groups, if you<br/>
picked the right server you can kill players alone, or kill them in groups,<br/>
you can work on trade skills, explore your zone and on the ones around it,<br/>
talk to the NPC around and do some quests. And then just when you think you<br/>
have done it all--Move to a different geographical area! Then you get to<br/>
start over, cuz the mosters are different, and so are the players!  Who has<br/>
time to sit around and be a merchant? there is adventure to be had in<br/>

(shrug) I enjoy this game a lot, and that means I (gasp, here&#39;s the<br/>
kicker boys) think about it.  Thoughts are more than single sentence<br/>
statements.<br/>
<br/>
But go ahead and flame, you will anyway.  We&#39;ll see who&#39;s right in<br/>
another month or two; I predict that servers with uber smiths charging<br/>
low prices will see only a few smiths left after a few weeks.  If you<br/>
want the validating evidence as to this position, read that post you<br/>
lost interest in and wandering off to watch WWF in the middle of.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really a shame, I was looking forward to playing a smith too; but<br/>
why should I bother if I&#39;ll only make a gold over costs?  I continue,<br/>
however, to hold out hope that Verdant will fix the trade skills, and<br/>
make them work as they should (platemail, weaponsmithing, cloth armor,<br/>
etc...)<br/>
