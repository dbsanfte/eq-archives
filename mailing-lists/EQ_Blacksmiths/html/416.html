<div id="ygrps-yiv-508814094">If this were to be implemented, rare magic items would probably be excluded.<br/>
We&#39;re only talking about common non-magical items that would wear out over<br/>
time. And you don&#39;t have to make the item totally disappear. A better way to<br/>
do is to have the AC value of the item drop until it hits, let&#39;s say 1, then<br/>
it&#39;s time to go get it repaired. Again, I like the system the way it is.<br/>

&gt; OK, simple question, how many of you people that are for items<br/>
&gt; deteriorating and going poof have any magic plate?  (none I&#39;d bet)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve spent about 2 months to get the armor that I am now wearing, I&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; pissed to an extreem if I were in the middle of a fight and I see a<br/>
&gt; message &quot;Your Charred Black Tunic has fallen appart&quot;.  That one piece of<br/>
&gt; armor alone took me the better part of week to get.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, so you say I should have to get it repaired by a smith.  I am DE, and<br/>
&gt; by choice I have lowered my faction to the point where I will never be<br/>
&gt; able to go into Freeport or Rivervale, and due to built in factions, I can<br/>
&gt; not go to any other elf city nor can I go into gnome, dwarf, or barbarian<br/>
&gt; city.  Which means that I would have to search, not only for a respectable<br/>
&gt; smith that I trusted, but also an evil one, or trek my self across the<br/>
&gt; world to Qeynos.  Simply to get my armor &quot;repaired&quot;.  Now if that isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; bad enough.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Often my group will go deep into a dungeon, deep to the point where either<br/>
&gt; a caster has to group gate us to get us out, or we have to spend 30-45 min<br/>
&gt; fighting out way out of the dungeon.  And quite often we&#39;ll all camp and<br/>
&gt; logout in a &quot;safe&quot; spot in the dungeon, so sometimes we will be in a<br/>
&gt; dungeon litterly for days.  Now, say I get the message &quot;your rubicite helm<br/>
&gt; is begining to weaken, you should take it for repairs soon&quot;, that means<br/>
&gt; that my entire group would have to leave the dungeon so that I might quest<br/>
&gt; to get my armor repaired.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I find neither to be acceptable.  What I do find about this, is that there<br/>
&gt; are some smiths who think they don&#39;t make enough money, so they want armor<br/>
&gt; to wear out, so it has to either be replaced or repaired (more money for<br/>
&gt; smiths).  What they fail to concider is the fact that you will not always<br/>
&gt; be wearing banded armor.<br/>

&gt; It would make people too mad. Having a nice piece of magic armor that took<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; forever to get disappear because it wore out. I don&#39;t like this idea, as<br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; would just make EQ more like Diablo and Ultima Online, which I hope they <br/>
&gt; would want to try and stay away from.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some other RPG&#39;s I&#39;ve played made it so that common wear items wore<br/>
&gt; quicker<br/>
&gt; than others as well as making rare quest items not wear very little or not<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; all since they are supposed to be considered priceless.  I think the idea<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; making items wear would be a great thing for the trade.  A shield and<br/>
&gt; sword<br/>
&gt; would wear quicker than say boots or leggings.  This gives smiths an<br/>
&gt; oppurtunity to increase their skills with less cost if they want to work<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; repairing and improving items.<br/>
