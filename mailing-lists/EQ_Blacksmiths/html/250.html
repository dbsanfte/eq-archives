<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101454433"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I heard that there was a quest where you are given a mold and you have to<br/>
&gt; smith a weapon.  Has anyone else heard about this and what smithing skill<br/>
&gt; should we be at before we waste the mold by not being skillfull enough ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The quest does not require you to smith anything.  You just get the mold as<br/>
a prize.  It is a blade mold but does not work as smithing weapons has not<br/>
been added to EQ.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, does the studded leather armor have any magic properties or just a<br/>
&gt; better armor class.  Could we get an Enchanter to enchant the metal studs<br/>
&gt; to do this ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Studded leather is just that studded leather.  It isn&#39;t magical.  The only<br/>
thing enchanters are actually able to enchant now is metals to make jewelry<br/>
from.  Perhaps when and if that class is ever finished then they could do<br/>
such things.  Now however they can not.</div>
