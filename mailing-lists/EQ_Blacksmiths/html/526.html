<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119831782">Another nice place for this is in Kelethin.  If you have metal bits on you,<br/>
more the better.  If not, a trip to Ak&#39;Anon will get you the proper<br/>
materials.<br/>
<br/>
From Felwithe, going on the path towards Kelethin.  The first lift you come<br/>
across, go up it.  On that platform, on the other side of the central tree<br/>
trunk, there is a merchant that sells all the molds needed for Sewing Kits.<br/>
Water can also be bought on this platform.  The ramp going up, which the<br/>
vendor selling the molds faces, is where you want to go next.  Coming to the<br/>
top of this platform, the forge comes right into view.<br/>
<br/>
This is where I did all my forging, through my level of 164 (so far).  I&#39;ve<br/>
found it to be VERY convenient.  Close to all medium armor molds, and fairly<br/>
close to small armor molds (outside Kaladim).  Only thing hard to find are<br/>
large molds, but those are really only good if you have a troll/ogre selling<br/>
base.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, there ya go from my experiences.<br/>
