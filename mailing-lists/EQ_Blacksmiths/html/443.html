<div id="ygrps-yiv-133443752">I agree. I don&#39;t want them working on it either. This is just my idea if it<br/>
were to be implemented. I would rather them work on changing permanent<br/>

&gt; Well, how ever logical or nice this idea sounds, it&#39;s the LAST thing I<br/>
&gt; want<br/>
&gt; them coding on (well, perm death is the last thing I want them coding on<br/>
&gt; actually). There are SOOOOOO many other things in the game that need<br/>
&gt; either<br/>
&gt; fixing or implimented that this conversation, I think, seems like a waste<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; time. Plus, most of us don&#39;t want it anyways (me included). If I wanted<br/>
&gt; reality, I&#39;d go hunting or fishing on the weekend.<br/>

&gt; Everybody keeps missing the fact that Artifacts of Great power would<br/>
&gt; probably not deteriorate. Or anything that is magic for that matter,<br/>
&gt; because<br/>
&gt; it has a special quality unlike normal items.  But how about that Rusty<br/>
&gt; Longsword that you&#39;ve been using for the last 6 months of adventuring. It<br/>
&gt; just doesn&#39;t make sense that that item would last too long. That&#39;s why<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; rusty.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My second point is that this could allow a lower level character to gain<br/>
&gt; specific items that weren&#39;t available before. Let&#39;s say as an item<br/>
&gt; deteriorates that it&#39;s AC and price do as well. Now, after a little wear,<br/>
&gt; that nifty Banded Tunic is now AC 7, and can be sold for 8-10pp. The<br/>
&gt; purchaser now takes it to a Smith and gets the item reapired for say 3-5pp<br/>
&gt; (which takes the item back to it&#39;s AC 15 state). Or, he/she can choose to<br/>
&gt; repair it over time, to save money. So now you have a set of armor that<br/>
&gt; cost<br/>
&gt; fractionally less, but over time will yield the same protection as a full<br/>
&gt; suit of &quot;fresh&quot; armor. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, deterioration should not destroy the item completely. It should just<br/>
&gt; take it down to the lowest AC possible. Instead of losing those Banded<br/>
&gt; Bracers, just make them drop until AC is 1 or 2. Then you have to go get<br/>
&gt; them polished to restore their protective value.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my thoughts :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; ok, I&#39;m Rennin with the big mouth, I have to put my 2 cents into the<br/>
&gt; next<br/>
&gt; &gt; major discussion on this list, so here goes nothing:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; While I must say deteriorating armor would be EXCELLENT revenue for<br/>
&gt; &gt; smiths, I am 100% against it. It&#39;s one of those things you have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; experience before you can really say what you want. Go play Diablo and<br/>
&gt; see<br/>
&gt; &gt; how much you like armor deterioration then :) That&#39;s a simple annoyance,<br/>
&gt; &gt; though. The main point of this letter is that I&#39;m very very against<br/>
&gt; armor<br/>
&gt; &gt; deterioration. I will write a short anecdote below for those who wish to<br/>
&gt; &gt; read it, but if you&#39;re short on time, don&#39;t bother. It&#39;s just a relation<br/>
&gt; &gt; of one of my experiences that&#39;s a part<br/>
&gt; &gt; of my anti-deterioration attitude. If you&#39;ve got the time, read on :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I used to play Sierra&#39;s The Realm. I played that damn game from right<br/>
&gt; &gt; after beta (v 2.xx). It was a pretty good game until the release of<br/>
&gt; 3.xx.<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s when they implemented armor deterioration..... Well, to briefly<br/>
&gt; &gt; explain items in the game, you had an item that was mundane. Enchanters<br/>
&gt; &gt; could cast several different enchantments on the thing to make it<br/>
&gt; better.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Every time, though, there was a chance it would destroy the item, and<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; more enchanted it was, the higher that chance was. 6 enchantments were<br/>
&gt; &gt; unheard of, 5 were rare, and 4 were<br/>
&gt; &gt; there, but difficult. I had just replaced my 4 permed (permanents, or<br/>
&gt; &gt; enchantments) adamantium tunic with a 5 permed magical armor. I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; remember the name, but it was naturally black (another game feature was<br/>
&gt; &gt; you could dye your clothing. Adamantium came light blue, the armor I got<br/>
&gt; &gt; was rare and came black like I like it =P). This armor was pretty much<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; best you could get. I also had a sword of similar quality with 4 perms<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; it. In one fight (it was a very very long fight with the toughest<br/>
&gt; humanoid<br/>
&gt; &gt; NPC in the game at the time - I<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t remember the name, but it was human and wore adamantium. Was a<br/>
&gt; &gt; champion of light or some crap like that - I had to kill it =P), I lost<br/>
&gt; &gt; both the tunic and the sword in that fight. After he destroyed my<br/>
&gt; &gt; priceless tunic (literally, it was truly one-of-a-kind), and my<br/>
&gt; &gt; near-priceless sword, I ran from the fight. I ran, logged out, and never<br/>
&gt; &gt; logged back in. Losing items that take that much work to get in one<br/>
&gt; fight<br/>
&gt; &gt; was too much... I haven&#39;t even tried logging in since. My account has<br/>
&gt; &gt; since expired.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t want this to happen to EQ... to get that rare piece of armor and<br/>
&gt; &gt; just lose it in one shot like that... no, that&#39;s just too terrible a<br/>
&gt; thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; to introduce into a game. I don&#39;t want to see deteriorating armor at<br/>
&gt; &gt; all... it&#39;s got too much potential to really cause a lot of frustration.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, simple question, how many of you people that are for items<br/>
&gt; &gt; deteriorating and going poof have any magic plate?  (none I&#39;d bet)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve spent about 2 months to get the armor that I am now wearing, I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; pissed to an extreem if I were in the middle of a fight and I see a<br/>
&gt; &gt; message &quot;Your Charred Black Tunic has fallen appart&quot;.  That one piece of<br/>
&gt; &gt; armor alone took me the better part of week to get.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, so you say I should have to get it repaired by a smith.  I am DE,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and by choice I have lowered my faction to the point where I will never<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; able to go into Freeport or Rivervale, and due to built in factions, I<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; not go to any other elf city nor can I go into gnome, dwarf, or<br/>
&gt; barbarian<br/>
&gt; &gt; city.  Which means that I would have to search, not only for a<br/>
&gt; respectable<br/>
&gt; &gt; smith that I trusted, but also an evil one, or trek my self across the<br/>
&gt; &gt; world to Qeynos.  Simply to get my armor &quot;repaired&quot;.  Now if that isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; bad enough.....<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Often my group will go deep into a dungeon, deep to the point where<br/>
&gt; &gt; either a caster has to group gate us to get us out, or we have to spend<br/>
&gt; &gt; 30-45 min fighting out way out of the dungeon.  And quite often we&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; &gt; camp and logout in a &quot;safe&quot; spot in the dungeon, so sometimes we will be<br/>
&gt; &gt; in a dungeon litterly for days.  Now, say I get the message &quot;your<br/>
&gt; rubicite<br/>
&gt; &gt; helm is begining to weaken, you should take it for repairs soon&quot;, that<br/>
&gt; &gt; means that my entire group would have to leave the dungeon so that I<br/>
&gt; might<br/>
&gt; &gt; quest to get my armor repaired.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I find neither to be acceptable.  What I do find about this, is that<br/>
&gt; &gt; there are some smiths who think they don&#39;t make enough money, so they<br/>
&gt; want<br/>
&gt; &gt; armor to wear out, so it has to either be replaced or repaired (more<br/>
&gt; money<br/>
&gt; &gt; for smiths).  What they fail to concider is the fact that you will not<br/>
&gt; &gt; always be wearing banded armor.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; It would make people too mad. Having a nice piece of magic armor that<br/>
&gt; &gt; took<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; forever to get disappear because it wore out. I don&#39;t like this idea,<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would just make EQ more like Diablo and Ultima Online, which I hope<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would want to try and stay away from.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Some other RPG&#39;s I&#39;ve played made it so that common wear items wore<br/>
&gt; &gt; quicker<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; than others as well as making rare quest items not wear very little or<br/>
&gt; &gt; not at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all since they are supposed to be considered priceless.  I think the<br/>
&gt; &gt; idea of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; making items wear would be a great thing for the trade.  A shield and<br/>
&gt; &gt; sword<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would wear quicker than say boots or leggings.  This gives smiths an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; oppurtunity to increase their skills with less cost if they want to<br/>
&gt; work<br/>
&gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; repairing and improving items.<br/>
