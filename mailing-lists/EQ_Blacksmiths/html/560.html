<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066972945">What pieces are you trying to sell? Most people I know dont even try till Banded stage. Just sell it all back to the merchants.<br/>
<br/>
A Mastersmith friend of mine (138) stated what people are willing to pay for the new weapons wont cover the cost of making them, but that unless you get into a bidding war (Ive seen it) Banded goes on Tunare for 1 plat per AC, +1.<br/>

Hello all.  I&#39;m new to the trade of smithing and would like some info on<br/>
what to sell the pieces for.  I&#39;ve seen some radically different prices and<br/>
would like a general concensus of going rates.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve heard that you can now forge weapons.  What skill is needed for<br/>
them and what supplies?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time,<br/>
