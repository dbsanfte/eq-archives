<div id="ygrps-yiv-400179196">GOOD FOR YOU ANGARTH!!  Not wanting to do the &#39;mule&#39; or twinking thing!<br/>
<br/>
I too believe that it&#39;s silly to do that!  I mean, why take away so much<br/>
from the game (earning it all yourself or with friends)??<br/>
<br/>
I say again GOOD FOR YOU!<br/>
<br/>
As to taking up smithing, realize that it is a time consuming and COSTLY<br/>
skill to learn (as I found out like others did)... There are sooo many that<br/>
want to learn smithing for the money... I myself started smithing because I<br/>
wanted to make my OWN armor to wear instead of buying it from others...<br/>
Which is why I still don&#39;t have full banded even though I am level 18...<br/>
hehe.. But I also get to waste lots of money making banded stuff that I can<br/>
sell... hehe...<br/>

&gt; Hail Blacksmiths.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am a warrior of the 16th Tier and was looking to start a trade skill.<br/>
&gt; Since I am a barbarian warrior and fit the mold of what a blacksmith<br/>
&gt; &#39;usually&#39; would look like, I have a few basic questions.  First, someone<br/>
&gt; told me that for ANY trade skill, intelligence is of utmost important.<br/>
