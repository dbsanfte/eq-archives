<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-51658824">Please keep me informed as to updates on your excellent resource. I really<br/>
appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
And, if I may be so bold... don&#39;t let the few people who complain about OT<br/>
posts stop you from putting the word out. For DAMN sure their posts<br/>
complaining are far more inappropriate than an update notice is...<br/>
<br/>
People like this are just jealous, or have a grudge against &quot;spoiler&quot; sites,<br/>
or were beaten at tetherball matches in grade school a lot, whatever. At any<br/>
rate, in the final analysis, you are helping far more people than you are<br/>
harming by p1mping your site.<br/>
<br/>
On the Internet,  complaints = flattery. Strange but true.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the world of WebMastery! It&#39;s a hoot, ain&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>

(PS: I cc&#39;ed this to the EQ_Smiths page just to see if somebody might start<br/>
frothing at the mouth. That always brightens up a mailing list. :)</div>
