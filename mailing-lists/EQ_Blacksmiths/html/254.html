<div id="ygrps-yiv-799761897">I disagree. 21 is when bits become trivial. Then make scalers until 41, that <br/>
is when they become trivial. Then after that make skewers until 115. That is <br/>
when they become trivial. I tried making banded before this, and everyone <br/>
always wanted other banded items. Everyone has gorgets and bracers, they are <br/>
the cheapest thing out there. Once 115 make all banded. You will fail a lot <br/>
on some things. Sometimes you will have a bad spout. Failing 10 times in a <br/>
row at 121 skill in Legs really sucks. once your that high, just keep making <br/>
banded. and your skill will raise.<br/>
