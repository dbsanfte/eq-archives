&gt; Ok, I just relocated to Freeport to begin blacksmithing.  I just want to<br/>
&gt; double check that my progress sounds normal.  I started by using 21 points<br/>
&gt; for training.  I gain about 1 experience point for every 20 scalers I make.<br/>
&gt; That seems low to me.  I&#39;ve tried some skewers but have only gained a level<br/>
&gt; once when I succeeded  Do you have to succeed to improve?  Any opinions<br/>
&gt; would be helpfull.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You do not have to succeed to improve.  I assume this is for all trade<br/>
skills, but I have seen it happen to me with smithing and tailoring. <br/>
Skill improvement and success at making the item seem to be unrelated.<br/>
