<div id="ygrps-yiv-346183086"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;The only reference I have for this is a guide to blacksmithing<br/>
&gt; that &gt;says my skill needs to be 145 to make cloaks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night I succeded in making cloaks in 2 out of 3 attempts.  My skill<br/>
&gt; is 141 and this seems to be normal for me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks.  Today (if E. Marr ever comes back up), I plan to search out the<br/>
materials to make sewing kits and (hopefully) push my skill to 135 before I<br/>
attempt to make more armor.  Last night, I scoured all 3 Freeport zones<br/>
looking for needle molds (everything else was right by the forge in E.<br/>
Freeport) with no luck (piss me off).  Anyone know where is a good place to<br/>
forge sewing kits with all the materials near the forge?  Also, what is the<br/>
typical success rate for Leggings, Tunics, and Cloaks with a skill of 135 vs<br/>
122?  Hehe, I&#39;d like to actually make some money with my smithing skill<br/>
instead of breaking even on each piece I sell (I sell each piece for 5pp per<br/>
sheet needed to make).</div>
