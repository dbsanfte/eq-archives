<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320560691">Large molds also in either Grobb or Oggok, not sure where, but one of them <br/>
has them. Or maybe I think it might be in Feerrott, on an Ogre Vendor.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing I would like to know, anyone know anything about plate and <br/>
weapons? I think it might be getting close, because Fletching and Jewelcraft <br/>
have been revamped, maybe if only a little, they have been modified. I feel <br/>
smithing is next in line. At least I hope so. If anyone has any knowledge of <br/>
this, please tell me. Also, anyone know if Enchanters are going to be able to <br/>
enchant metal to make some fine magic plate?</div>
