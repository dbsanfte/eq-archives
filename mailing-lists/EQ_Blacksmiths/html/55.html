<div id="ygrps-yiv-499682654">Agreed! I like when smaller sites tell people they have updates. I don&#39;t<br/>
like it when they flood everyone, but I&#39;ve only seen 2 posts from this guy,<br/>
and I like his site. If he gets time to work on it, it could be very very<br/>
benificial. I&#39;ve been there a couple of times, and like the info there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not had bad experience with people on boards, as I don&#39;t post much and<br/>
I delete babble very quickly. *shrug* Was annoying to come into work Monday<br/>
and have 149 new messages waiting...<br/>

Has everyone on this game gone postal???!!! WHO CARES!!! If he has an update<br/>
<br/>
to his web site and he wants to post it up here for people to check out, LET<br/>
<br/>
HIM!! It does deal with EQ and that should be all that really matters. I am <br/>
seeing a bad trend on the message board and in game and it has a lot to do <br/>
with things like this. PEOPLE ARE GETTING RUDE. I had better run ins with <br/>
pkers on UO then with the people im seeing in EQ and the mailing list. <br/>
Please, Everyone just sit back, relax, and enjoy the info we recieve. I know<br/>
<br/>
as well as anyone else reading these that your probably at work, if you <br/>
werent you would be playing right now, so dont tell me you have something <br/>
better to be doing then reading these posts. I&#39;m not saying post anything <br/>
and everything, but this mailing list has done very well about staying on <br/>
subject, a couple of links to eq info sites is not going to kill anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Rant over, return to your normal blacksmithing news.<br/>

&gt;I believe you should not send your personal wab page updates to this forum<br/>
&gt;as it does apply to blacksmithing.  If you wish you can send us an update<br/>
&gt;for when you change you blacksmithing guide.  Other than that I think that <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;can say that WE don&#39;t really have an interest in what happens to the rest <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;your web site.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are other forums you could subscribe and send your web page updates<br/>
&gt;to. This is a blacksmithing one so this is not the place for you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you.<br/>

&gt;You didn&#39;t need to quote the whole thing, and the only way not to receive<br/>
&gt;those updates is to not subscribe to this mailing list altogether.  It&#39;d be<br/>
&gt;the same if you mailed this list an update of your EQ page (imagine that<br/>
&gt;you have one), everyone gets it, whether or not their interested.<br/>
