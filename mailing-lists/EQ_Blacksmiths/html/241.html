 </span></blockquote>Patrick, I am so glad to hear you say that!  One less blacksmith to compete<br/>
with!  And your right, you can find banded armor all over the place, so why<br/>
buy it?  Oh, I mean you can find RING armor that is way better... yeah,<br/>
that;s what I meant... I think...<br/>
<br/>
Well, in any case, have fun out fighting evil, and don&#39;t worry, the rest of<br/>
us will take care of all that boring smithing stuff... because after all, we<br/>
are all just greedy blacksmiths who want to have millions of plat!<br/>
