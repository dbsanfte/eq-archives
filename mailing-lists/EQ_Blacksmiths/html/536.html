<b>Subject:</b> New Smith Items <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782391675">So what do people think of the new smith items?  I have made a sample of<br/>
each and auctioned them on E Marr.  I got 3 or 4 inquiries from other smiths<br/>
on how to make them and not a single inquiry about the price, etc. from<br/>
anyone else.  The weapons cost roughly 5pp to make, BTW.  I have heard the<br/>
stats are not as good as fine steel weapons.  Can someone who knows the fine<br/>
steel weapon stats, post them for comparison?  These are the new items:<br/>
<br/>
Forged Morning Star, 1HB, 8 damage, 38 delay<br/>
1 water + 1 metal sheet + Hilt Mold + Spiked Ball Mold<br/>
<br/>
Forged 2-handed Sword, 2HS, 12dmg, 44 delay<br/>
1 water + 1 metal sheet + Hilt Mold + Pommel Mold + Heavy Steel Blade Mold<br/>
<br/>
Forged Bastard Sword, 1HS, 7 damage, 33 delay<br/>
1 water + 1 metal sheet + Hilt Mold + Pommel Mold + Dual Edge Blade Mold<br/>
<br/>
The molds can be found off a vendor in Butcher Block, right outside of<br/>
Kaladmim.  Mold prices with amiable faction and high charisma:<br/>
<br/>
Dual Edge Blade Mold   1p 9g 1s 8c<br/>
Heavy Steel Blade Mold 3p 8g 3s 6c<br/>
Spiked Ball Mold       2p 5g 5s 7c<br/>
Hilt Mold                 6g 3s 9c<br/>
Pommel Mold               6g 3s 9c<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on what we should charge for these?  Anyone know where else the<br/>
molds can be bought or any new items we can make?  I&#39;d particularly like<br/>
confirmation on the Paladin in Solusek Ro that gives a quest for armor<br/>
molds.<br/>
