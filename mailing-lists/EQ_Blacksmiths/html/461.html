<div id="ygrps-yiv-145966870">What?  You mean beta is over??  When did this happen???  Seems to me that if<br/>
you have features that don&#39;t work yet, and weekly fixes and updates, that<br/>
you are still IN beta!  Decisions are still being made as to characters,<br/>
classes, skills, spells, etc... So we really are still in a beta stage...<br/>
Actually the former stage should really have been called an Open Alpha stage<br/>
(or Beta 1 and we are now in Beta 2?  3?  4?).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one thing to fix small bugs that were UNNOTICED before release, and its<br/>
another thing to add whole NEW (unplanned for) features and call it an<br/>
upgrade... But Verant is still fixing things that do not work properly in<br/>
almost every area... Things that they KNEW did not work right when they<br/>
released it for sale to the general public... That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not<br/>
still (actually) in beta...<br/>

&gt; really, a very nice point. I agree with you for the most part. I just wish<br/>
&gt; it were practical to code :( It&#39;s not only difficult to code, but it<br/>

&gt; part of playing. Getting used to those changes. That can&#39;t happen in the<br/>
&gt; commercial release, it&#39;s VERY bad business :( I really wish it were<br/>
&gt; practical to do this, I like your idea. I just know it can never happen.<br/>
