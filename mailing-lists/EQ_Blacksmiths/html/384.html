<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676489823">I am not trying to take anything away from enchanters, but why should all<br/>
magical items be dependent on one single class?  The same discussion is<br/>
going on in one of the tailoring lists.  If all magical items that can be<br/>
made through all skills need an enchanter to do the enchanting, enchanters<br/>
will be overworked.  Maybe enchanters need to be used in creating certain<br/>
magical items for smiths, but by no means all.<br/>

&gt; Yeah forget what the book said and all that stuff.<br/>
&gt;  reread your FaQ and the &quot;official&quot; guide to EQ, magical weapons are<br/>
&gt; supposed to require the help of a high level enchanter and a master<br/>
&gt; smith, the one things we shouldn&#39;t need is to deal with a slimy little<br/>
&gt; dwarven smith or some such ;)<br/>
&gt;  as for &quot;would become the best class to make magical items.&quot; well I<br/>
&gt; should hope so, its what our class does! what next? Take away damage<br/>
&gt; bonuses for str to fighters cause it might make them the best melee<br/>
&gt; class in the game? or pickpockets from rogues cause it might make them<br/>
&gt; the best rogues in the game? heh, don&#39;t mess with us enchanters or<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll regret it<br/>
