 </span></blockquote>Price fixing, especially in a game, is ridiculous.  We are here to have fun and many of us like to help out other players. Yes, I get jealous when I see a character of equal level running around in a full suit of banded because he has a buddy who sells it to him cheap but that is just his good fortune. Price fixing is just plain ignorant. Yes, it does cost a pretty plat to rise our skill high enough to make good armor. It is your own decision to spend the money. It is also my decision to sell what I make at what price I decide.<br/>
