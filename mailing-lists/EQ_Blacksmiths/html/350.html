<div id="ygrps-yiv-55744446">Just so you all know, I read something a few e-mails ago that I would like<br/>
to address.<br/>
<br/>
Something along the lines of &quot;if sold to the NPC who will then sell it back&quot;<br/>
or somesuch.  About chain and ringmail.  On any account, if you sell an item<br/>
to a merchant by accident, and mean to buy it back, but scroll down it&#39;s<br/>
entire inventory and find nothing, that is because it&#39;s not &quot;on the shelf&quot;,<br/>
so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
You need to buy out other items on the merchant to have more items in it&#39;s<br/>
inventory come to show.  Don&#39;t buy the items that the merchant normally<br/>
sells....they have endless stock of them.  Only those that people sell the<br/>
merchant.<br/>
<br/>
I once accidentally sold a runed totem staff to a merchant, but it wasn&#39;t on<br/>
the merchants &quot;shelf&quot;.  So I bought out item after item after item until<br/>
finally there was my staff.  Well, the merchant wanted 61pp for it, and I<br/>
said fuck that and bought another for 20pp.  Ah well.<br/>
