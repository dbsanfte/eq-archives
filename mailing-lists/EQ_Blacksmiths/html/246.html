<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373429685">Patrick, not a problem... hehe... I am doing smithing to make My OWN<br/>
armor... Yes I also make some for others and sell it, but I have yet to<br/>
become *rich* at it... In fact, I only have about 25 plat in the bank now...<br/>
hehe... And I will need at least 60 plat to buy the Cleric 19th level spells<br/>
(I am 18.5 now)... I also learned fishing for the same reason... to feed<br/>
myself... Now I have spells that make food and water, so I rarely practice<br/>
it.  The same will probably happen with smithing once I get all the armor I<br/>
need...  But it is still a BUSINESS as well... a different way to make<br/>
money... I even have a dwarf friend that travels back and forth to buy molds<br/>
(small size) for me every once in a while... and HE makes a profit too!  No<br/>
biggy...<br/>
<br/>
As to carpal tunnel and other such &#39;typing & mousing&#39; related illnesses, I<br/>
don&#39;t have a problem with them... I have been working with computers and<br/>
typing since 1978 and don&#39;t have problems at all!  I do proper stretching<br/>
exercises and use proper posture, in addition, a gel filled wrist rest for<br/>
both keyboard and mouse (which I HIGHLY recommend - from FELLOWES Co.) keep<br/>
the pressure off also... So, no worries... hehe...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Money is such a small part of this game it is pathetic.  The only thing<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; need money for is buy spells and some raw materials.  Most things that<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have done smithing, and I would much rather spend my time out in the<br/>
&gt; world<br/>
&gt; &gt; of norrath fighting evil and gaining off of that, then sitting at the<br/>
&gt; local<br/>
&gt; &gt; forge trying to make an extremely boring fortune.<br/>
