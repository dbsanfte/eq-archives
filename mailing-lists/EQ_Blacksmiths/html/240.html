<div id="ygrps-yiv-505592308">Money is such a small part of this game it is pathetic.  The only thing you<br/>
need money for is buy spells and some raw materials.  Most things that can<br/>
be made with trade skills (particularly blacksmithing) can be found in the<br/>
game world on monsters and are way better.<br/>
<br/>
I have done smithing, and I would much rather spend my time out in the world<br/>
of norrath fighting evil and gaining off of that, then sitting at the local<br/>
forge trying to make an extremely boring fortune.<br/>

I hear that these things are going into the game soon. Will they? If so, any<br/>
<br/>
time on when? A guess... or something. All comments are welcomed. Just want <br/>
to find out. Can&#39;t wait until this is in, be a very rich person! Plate<br/>
tunics <br/>
at 400 - 500pp instead of the thousands... very nice. Very rich, very<br/>
famous. <br/>
:-)  Powergamers dream, and that I am. Please don&#39;t flame me on that, just <br/>
stick to the topic. =) Thanks much.<br/>

<br/>
tell me. Thanks.<br/>
