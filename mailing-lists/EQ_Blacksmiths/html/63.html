&gt; Didn&#39;t mean to sink your boat... there are several forums that your web<br/>
page<br/>
&gt; would be quite welcome in.  This just doesn&#39;t happen to be one made for<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; sort of thing. Go back to Onelist and fine the general forum and post<br/>
there,<br/>
&gt; I am sure you will get a better responce from that crowd.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d like to start off by thanking Reedo, Chet, and David for their kind<br/>
&gt; words.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately far more people seem to think I am some kind of loser for<br/>
&gt; trying tell you all that my site is out there. I was under the impression<br/>
&gt; that this mailing list was to keep people informed about EverQuest, and<br/>
&gt; particularly about Smithing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have decided to no longer post any messages to any boards or lists. I am<br/>
&gt; now doing this site solely for my friends and those people who manage to<br/>
&gt; find it. I am sick of people complaining about something I do for free to<br/>
&gt; help them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you want to be kept abreast of changes, just e-mail me saying so and I<br/>
&gt; will send an update notice directly to you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think the site has a lot of potential considering that all the info<br/>
comes<br/>
&gt; from me, and I have no real HTML experience. (Just bought a book<br/>
yesterday.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry to have bothered anyone.<br/>

&gt; Personally I&#39;m really glad that he posted his web address.  He has some of<br/>
&gt; the best info on blacksmithing on the web.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Agreed! I like when smaller sites tell people they have updates. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;like it when they flood everyone, but I&#39;ve only seen 2 posts from this<br/>
guy,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and I like his site. If he gets time to work on it, it could be very very<br/>
&gt; &gt;benificial. I&#39;ve been there a couple of times, and like the info there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve not had bad experience with people on boards, as I don&#39;t post much<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt;I delete babble very quickly. *shrug* Was annoying to come into work<br/>
Monday<br/>
&gt; &gt;and have 149 new messages waiting...<br/>

&gt; &gt;Has everyone on this game gone postal???!!! WHO CARES!!! If he has an<br/>
&gt; update<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;to his web site and he wants to post it up here for people to check out,<br/>
&gt; LET<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;HIM!! It does deal with EQ and that should be all that really matters. I<br/>
am<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;seeing a bad trend on the message board and in game and it has a lot to<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; &gt;with things like this. PEOPLE ARE GETTING RUDE. I had better run ins with<br/>
&gt; &gt;pkers on UO then with the people im seeing in EQ and the mailing list.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Please, Everyone just sit back, relax, and enjoy the info we recieve. I<br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;as well as anyone else reading these that your probably at work, if you<br/>
&gt; &gt;werent you would be playing right now, so dont tell me you have something<br/>
&gt; &gt;better to be doing then reading these posts. I&#39;m not saying post anything<br/>
&gt; &gt;and everything, but this mailing list has done very well about staying on<br/>
&gt; &gt;subject, a couple of links to eq info sites is not going to kill anyone.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Rant over, return to your normal blacksmithing news.<br/>
