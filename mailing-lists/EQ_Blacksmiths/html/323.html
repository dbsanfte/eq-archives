<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936277316">Amen Scott.  You understand how it works, and you give very valid scenario&#39;s<br/>
where it is applicable.<br/>
<br/>
Now, for the other person who said that a persons plan to have a steady<br/>
price for banded wouldn&#39;t &quot;work for shit&quot;, my good sir you are QUITE wrong.<br/>
If all the blacksmiths (probably never ever happen, but still) got together,<br/>
and deemed a flat rate at which to sell their products, above what they<br/>
currently are, and refuse to lower their prices save perhaps 1pp here or<br/>
there, people will be forced to do 1 of 3 things.<br/>
<br/>
1.) Wait until someone, who already has banded, buys something better and<br/>
sells their banded for cheap, or...<br/>
2.) Plop 150pp + and many hours of game time into learning smithing, or....<br/>
3.) Buy for the prices us, the smith&#39;s, charge.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the people of Everquest, us, all of us that play, that determine&#39;s the<br/>
flow of the market.  I tell you that I for one am sick of loosing so much<br/>
money on blacksmithing because people always tell me that &quot;so and so sells<br/>
for cheaper&quot;.  Good for them.  I&#39;m not &quot;so and so&quot;.  I&#39;ve spent over 150pp<br/>
working on the skill, and have made MAYBE 40pp of that back.  And that&#39;s<br/>
with an extra 100pp or so in materials.<br/>
<br/>
Now sure, you can sell cheaper than anyone else.  But you gotta remember<br/>
this.  How much banded will you be able to sell in an hour?  And, with your<br/>
cheap prices, how much will you make?  Not much, I&#39;m betting.  Although<br/>
those of us who decide to stick with a price might not sell quite as often<br/>
as you, we will make more money, with less time spent, than you ever will.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, my 2 cent&#39;s (again).<br/>
