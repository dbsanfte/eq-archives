If this is how it came across, I apologize.  That certainly wasn&#39;t how it<br/>
was meant.  If it did, that would be from a stressful day at work.  It takes<br/>
getting home, cleaning, studying, taking care of my son, and jumping onto EQ<br/>
before I slip into my happy go lucky dwarven self,  when I start being<br/>
nothing but friendly.  But at the same time, I hope my point is well<br/>
received.  There is really no need to duplicate efforts made on several<br/>
excellent web sites, which I&#39;m willing to bet 95% or so of the people on<br/>
this list that are interested enough to care have access to.  Simply give<br/>
them a pointer, or in cases such as this, why shouldn&#39;t it be sufficent to<br/>
have the person simply log into EQ to get the information.   I get right<br/>
around 70 or so emails a day from my various lists (1 /extremely/ high<br/>
traffic one (Star Wars RPG), and 1 that I&#39;ve now gone into digest mode on<br/>
not included) that I need to go through...and that&#39;s not counting my Real<br/>
Life email.  So it&#39;s quite a task.  While I agree, it takes but a second to<br/>
go glance at an email and hit delete, multiply this X70, then multiply that<br/>
X5 for the week, not to mention the mail that builds up over the weekend<br/>
when I don&#39;t check it, and...well... it&#39;s a hell a chore..<br/>
