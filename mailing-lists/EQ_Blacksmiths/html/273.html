<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-110793563">Until you hit 115, you are making skewers as leveling items at about 25<br/>
silver each.<br/>
After than you can go up a little bit more 121? with pots and bread<br/>
tins. for 30 silver or so.<br/>
<br/>
Now its all individual as to how many attempts raises a skill point, I<br/>
have 75 intel and i went up 1 to 2 points per 20 attempts<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a smithing question that might first look <br/>
&gt; like a fletching questions, but please bear with <br/>
&gt; me.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To develop my fletching skill I make arrows - bows <br/>
&gt; are much too expensive for a failure.  Before the <br/>
&gt; recent change to the skills I would buy a batch <br/>
&gt; of raw materials from the fletching supplier and <br/>
&gt; tediously make arrows, frequently getting a <br/>
&gt; message that my skill had gone up.  I sold the <br/>
&gt; completed arrows back to a merchant in my guild <br/>
&gt; to minimize the cost of gaining skill.  (The <br/>
&gt; market for arrows isn&#39;t so hot.)  In my most <br/>
&gt; recent training exercise I went from a skill of <br/>
&gt; 69 to a skill of 74.  The outlay, after buying <br/>
&gt; raw materials and selling the completed arrows, <br/>
&gt; was about 2.5 pp, or about 5g/skill point.  All <br/>
&gt; this was before the patch.  Note that this cost <br/>
&gt; is very different than using the skill points <br/>
&gt; you get when you gain levels, I&#39;m not talking <br/>
&gt; about that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fletchers complained bitterly about having to <br/>
&gt; make single arrows.  Verant responded with a <br/>
&gt; solution that sells components in batches of <br/>
&gt; five and produces arrows in batches of five.  <br/>
&gt; The problem is, the skill level is based on the <br/>
&gt; number of times the fletcher hits the &quot;combine&quot; <br/>
&gt; key.  The tediousness of making arrows has been <br/>
&gt; fixed, but the price of gaining skill points has <br/>
&gt; been multiplied by a factor of five.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My question to you smiths is, do you know how <br/>
&gt; much it costs to increase your skill?  In the <br/>
&gt; range from 60 to 80 is it 5g/point, or <br/>
&gt; 2.5pp/point?  Or is it far different than that?  <br/>
&gt; I appreciate your patience in reading through <br/>
&gt; this.  Thank you.<br/>
