&gt; Just want to say, when we are finally able to make plate (this isn&#39;t in<br/>
the near<br/>
&gt; future, mind you. Tailoring is probably next to be worked on after make<br/>
poison,<br/>
&gt; and then probably tinkering or alchemy from what I&#39;ve read all around), we<br/>
&gt; should only sell for 5 to 10 plat less than the magical plates are sold<br/>
for. We<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t sell for NPC plate prices (people would just buy magical plate) but<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; really don&#39;t want to shoot myself in the foot and have the same thing<br/>
happen<br/>
&gt; with plate as it did to banded. Please, no flames, I know some of you will<br/>
only<br/>
&gt; want 10 plat profit per piece, that&#39;s your right, and this is mine. This<br/>
is what<br/>
&gt; I will be doing and I would hope if you&#39;re concerned over smithing, please<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; the same. Plate will NOT be cheaper to make oneself (not only the 150 plat<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; takes to get to banded, but all the time selling banded to get to making<br/>
plate),<br/>
&gt; so we don&#39;t have to worry about that happening. Just gotta be competetive<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; magical plates. Again, please no flames, I&#39;m terribly sick of them, and I<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; not respond. Please, if you&#39;re on my side, don&#39;t respond to any flames<br/>
either.<br/>
&gt; Let the baby have his/her bottle.<br/>
