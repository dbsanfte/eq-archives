<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374734569">Out of curiousity, what is your problem with twinking? How does twinking<br/>
degrade your play and or fun? How does it prevent you from doing<br/>
leveling, completing quests, goofing off? If the gear was on a level 50<br/>
PC, how is this better than a level 1 PC? <br/>
<br/>
Just curious, cause personally, I think telling people what they can and<br/>
cannot do with items they own is silly in the first place, and I&#39;ve<br/>
never noticed any lessening of my enjoyment of the game due to some<br/>
twinking. Well, I&#39;ve thought to myself &quot;Garsh, it&#39;d sure be nice if *I*<br/>
had that...&quot;<br/>

&gt; Joint bank accounts wouldn&#39;t be that great of an idea... For the reasons you<br/>
&gt; stated, it would, but it would be abused too easily to help *twink* another<br/>
&gt; character up...<br/>
