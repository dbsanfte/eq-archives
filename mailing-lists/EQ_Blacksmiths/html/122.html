<b>Subject:</b> An update on increasing your skill <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139184958">Hi, I spent night last increasing my smithing<br/>
skill from 49 to 66 and spent an additional<br/>
21pp to bring my total so far to only 61pp (and<br/>
I actually wasted 2pp testing something out).<br/>
The thing I have been doing is making the<br/>
cheapest cost item and moving up, well it seems<br/>
in my haste to get started I miscalculated the<br/>
cost to make a skewer.  These are what I<br/>
should have been doing instead of lanterns<br/>
after making scalers.  I noticed this at skill<br/>
level 62 and so I tried a test batch of 10<br/>
skewers and failed in all 10 attempts!! (this is<br/>
the wasted 2pp).  I think the price is wrong on<br/>
the skewer mold, I should have been able to make<br/>
at least one lousy skewer at that skill level if<br/>
it *was* the next thing to do.  I only say this<br/>
because my success rate at making lanterns was<br/>
around 50% at that same skill level.  So I<br/>
abandoned the skewers and went back to lanterns.<br/>
<br/>
This brings me to some other things you can do<br/>
to reduce the cost at raising a skill.<br/>
<br/>
If you are getting high up in level (I&#39;m a 15th<br/>
level warrior) those faction adjustments are<br/>
starting to add up.  Different merchants will<br/>
start /con&#39;ing at different levels, in the<br/>
Freeport area alone I can find merchants who<br/>
regard me apprensively all the way to warmly.<br/>
The better the merchant likes you the more he<br/>
or she will pay for your goods.  I used a greater<br/>
lightstone as a measuring stick and found that<br/>
a merchant who regards me only indifferently<br/>
will usually pay around 3p 5g but a warmly<br/>
merchant will pay 3p 9g.  Can you guess which<br/>
merchant will get to buy my freshly made batch<br/>
of lanterns?<br/>
<br/>
The other tip is not to make a whole stack of<br/>
metal bits at once.  What I did at the earlier<br/>
skill levels is buy the ore, water and molds<br/>
then attempt to make a metal bit.  When I<br/>
was successful then I would attempt to make<br/>
the scaler.  Your success rate at making<br/>
metal bits will increase when your smithing<br/>
skill increases.  But you can&#39;t increase<br/>
your smithing skill by making metal bits because<br/>
they are trivial.  So if I make one metal bit<br/>
then attempt the scaler and happen to increase<br/>
my smithing skill the next metal bit I attempt<br/>
has a slightly higher chance of succeeding.  At<br/>
around a 55 skill I was getting a 90-95% success<br/>
rate at making metal bits.<br/>
<br/>
So why I am increasing my blacksmithing skill?<br/>
I put a challenge to my warrior to make all his<br/>
own supplies and this includes banded armor.<br/>
I&#39;m sure I will try to sell some banded after<br/>
my skill is high enough, but I&#39;m not in it for<br/>
the money alone.  Also some baking recipes and<br/>
tailoring recipes call for metal parts and I would<br/>
like to become better at those skills (my baking<br/>
is at 82 and tailor is 26 - patchwork trivial<br/>
level).<br/>
<br/>
I have two questions that maybe some other smiths<br/>
out there can answer.  First, where can I get<br/>
a lockpick mold?  I searched all over and couldn&#39;t<br/>
find it anywhere.  And what is the correct recipe<br/>
for making a toolbox?  The ingredients in the<br/>
book are giving an invalid combination message<br/>
so I figured maybe they just left out the mold<br/>
requirement but I couldn&#39;t find it (even in<br/>
ak&#39;anon).<br/>
