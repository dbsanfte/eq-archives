<div id="ygrps-yiv-514036939">I have not sold or heard of being sold, a single forge weapon on my server.<br/>
Tried to dump them at cost and then tried to GIVE them away for free (in the<br/>
commonlands, during prime time).  Players simply don&#39;t want them.  Lol, very<br/>
few want FS either (been just dumping them on vendors due to extreme lack of<br/>
interest).  The ONLY way these would become a viable item is if they became<br/>
able to hit magic (and I mean for the same price/difficulty of producing<br/>
them now).  My thoughts on this are that almost none of the new characters<br/>
moving from newbieland into their early teens are non-twinked.  Seeing ALOT<br/>
of level 1 to 5 players with full bronze (my smith RARELY gets asked to<br/>
twink banded or even get the occassional order of a piece or 2 by legitimate<br/>
new players), magic weapons, and Flowing Black Robes etc.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think the problem with pricing and manufacturing costs on the new<br/>
&gt; weapons is due to the disparity between what Verant thinks the weapons<br/>
&gt; are worth and what the players will actually pay for them.   The store<br/>
&gt; prices on most fine steel weapons is from 30-40 pp in the shops, but you<br/>
&gt; can buy them by the tons on Karana for 4-8 pp each from players.  That<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t cover the costs of our molds, much less taking failures into<br/>
&gt; account.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most people I know want magic weapons by the time they are 15th level so<br/>
&gt; they can hunt critters you need magic weapons for.  Prior to 15th level<br/>
&gt; it doesn&#39;t really matter much what you use for a weapon.  I think the<br/>
&gt; weapons are a nice idea, but Verant needs to rethink the component costs<br/>
&gt; and get them in line with reality.<br/>
