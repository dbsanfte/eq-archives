<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332298633">Not webupdate list. I have to agree with that one dude. I just care about <br/>
blacksmithing on this list. And if the owner of the site has to stoop so low <br/>
as to send out his site to a whole ton of people just to get people to come <br/>
to their site, that is sad. Why don&#39;t you send it to EQ_Rangers, they have <br/>
100s of people on that list. Just stick to blacksmithing and this world will <br/>
be happy.</div>
