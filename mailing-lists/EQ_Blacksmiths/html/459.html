<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339806171">lol, if it got coded, I sure would have to laugh at the database :) I know from<br/>
experience that lots of text (even if it&#39;s JUST text) takes up lots of space :)<br/>
My e-mail trash is 40 megs =P No files, just text!!<br/>

&gt; Sure it&#39;s possible to code! Wouldn&#39;t be a tough code, although the database<br/>
&gt; changes I bet would be horrendous! HA! A new member of the data structure is<br/>
&gt; EASY to put in, although changing all the data isn&#39;t always so easy.... And,<br/>
&gt; I like the idea. Would be cool to see how much things get around. Like, I,<br/>
&gt; for the most part, don&#39;t remember who I bought my banded from.<br/>
&gt; Uumm...actually, I don&#39;t remember... Heh.<br/>

&gt; Well, in the midst of all the flames, I wanted to make a friendly happy<br/>
&gt; sort of a post. Please, nobody argue with this, it would defeat the<br/>
&gt; entire purpose of this post. I won&#39;t even respond if this gets flamed,<br/>
&gt; and I would hope nobody else will either. Anyway, here goes:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just thought it&#39;d be a neat idea to have &#39;name tags&#39; on trade-made<br/>
&gt; products. Maybe not for cooking or brewing, as those items aren&#39;t meant<br/>
&gt; to last, but on generally anything else. Something in the status window<br/>
&gt; that says, &quot;made by: name&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t that just be neat? Buy a banded<br/>
&gt; tunic 6 months from now with one of your secondary characters and say,<br/>
&gt; &quot;hey! I made that!!&quot; I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s even possible for them to code<br/>
&gt; this, nor do I expect or really even want them to. I just think it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; kinda neat, that&#39;s all :) Too much coding for the effect it would<br/>
&gt; produce (or should I say lack of effect =P). Just, as I said, neat :)<br/>
