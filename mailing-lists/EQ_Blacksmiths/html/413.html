<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015808204">When I bought my banded armor, I was charged 15 plat per piece.  I though<br/>
that was good since I was taking his time away from adventuring.  My friend<br/>
paid close to the same prices for his armor.  I think 20 plat is too high,<br/>
but anything around the 10-15 plat is good.  Most people who need the armor<br/>
have the money to buy it at that price, and if not then they can piece a<br/>
suit together like I did.<br/>

&gt; ore...free<br/>
&gt; mold...few gold<br/>
&gt; water...few silver<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; cost of materials is only a couple of plat, so for someone to sell a few<br/>
gold above cost, the tunic would have to be no more than about 5<br/>
plat....i&#39;ve never seen anybody selling that cheap.  10plat a tunic is still<br/>
a big profit, 20plat a tunic is a huge profit, anything above 20plat is a<br/>
rip off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As for the fixed prices, I&#39;m all for it.  I haven&#39;t reached the level<br/>
where<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can make banded yet, but when I get there, I want more than a few gold<br/>
&gt; &gt; profit for my wares.  I do have a further suggestion though.  When you<br/>
see<br/>
&gt; &gt; people selling at a few gold above cost, bargain with them to get their<br/>
&gt;<br/>
