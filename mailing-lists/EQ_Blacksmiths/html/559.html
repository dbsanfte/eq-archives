<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823310208">Hello all.  I&#39;m new to the trade of smithing and would like some info on<br/>
what to sell the pieces for.  I&#39;ve seen some radically different prices and<br/>
would like a general concensus of going rates.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve heard that you can now forge weapons.  What skill is needed for<br/>
them and what supplies?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time,<br/>
