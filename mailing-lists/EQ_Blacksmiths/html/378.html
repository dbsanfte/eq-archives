<div id="ygrps-yiv-188034596">Now that is a very intersting idea. A couple of more thoughts, how about<br/>
sword and shield molds as well with similiar qualities? Hell how about just<br/>
some sword and shield molds. :)<br/>

&gt; About being able to enchant sheet metal for armor....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, I love the idea.  I think it would be great to get some kick ass<br/>
armor<br/>
&gt; like that!  But then....it wouldn&#39;t be fair.  Think about it.  Enchanters<br/>
&gt; already are the best at Jewelry Making.  It is (pretty much) damn foolish<br/>
&gt; for anyone BUT an enchanter to learn the skill.  Unless, of course, you<br/>
also<br/>
&gt; play a high lvl enchanter who you use for your own enchanted metals.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By giving enchanters the ability to enchant sheet metal, thereby creating<br/>
&gt; magical armor, this make&#39;s enchanters have far too much control over the<br/>
&gt; market.  Jewelry making and Blacksmithing all would depend upon<br/>
enchanters?<br/>
&gt; No, I&#39;d rather not have that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Besides, Magical Armor should be something special.  IMHO, I believe there<br/>
&gt; should be quests for Blacksmith&#39;s, where the reward might be a mold that<br/>
&gt; comes enchanted with some random quality.  This would allow EVERYone the<br/>
&gt; opportunity to do this, and make us not be dependant upon enchanters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What do you all think?<br/>
