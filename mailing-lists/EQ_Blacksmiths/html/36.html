<b>Subject:</b> Re: Armadillo Hide <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525815834"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Last night on the dunes of North Ro my group and I vanquished a foe I had<br/>
 </span></blockquote>never before seen. It was called Dunedigger and it looked like a huge<br/>
armadillo. After &gt;dispatching it, it yielded up an armadillo hide. Does<br/>
anyone know of a use for it? Perhaps a type of armor? Any help would be<br/>
greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Dunedigger is a very rare spawn in N Ro.  He very rarely drops a special<br/>
shield called a Scute shield which is amazing and in high demand.  I hadn&#39;t<br/>
heard of him dropping anything else... no idea what to do with armadillo<br/>
hide.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note... if you are replying please only quote what you are<br/>
replying too... and especially if you reply to the digest.  It&#39;s very<br/>
frustrating having to wade through a post which quotes an entire digest to<br/>
get a couple lines of message...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Geran</div>
