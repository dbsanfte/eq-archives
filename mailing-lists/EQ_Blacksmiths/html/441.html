<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688253489">ok, here&#39;s my 2 coppers worth:<br/>
<br/>
It would be interesting if armor did &#39;fail&#39; or become &#39;damaged&#39; in some way,<br/>
at some time... I mean it happens to REAL armor doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
And, as everyone knows, almost everything else has a &#39;failure rate&#39; of some<br/>
sort in the game... Failure to MAKE armor, failure to cast spells, failure<br/>
to hit a mob, etc.  So, why not failing armor as well?<br/>
<br/>
BUT, it should be DAMAGED, not just &#39;deteriorating&#39; in some way... Damaged<br/>
in battle, against, say RED mobs...  And yes, only after you have had it for<br/>
a long time...<br/>
<br/>
Damaged Armor could still be used, but it could be, for example, only HALF<br/>
as effective as it used to be (with all that bailing wire holding it<br/>
together, it&#39;s still THERE isn&#39;t it?  hehe...) when bought new!<br/>
<br/>
No, don&#39;t make it slowly &#39;deteriorate&#39; and require maintenance because of<br/>
it... Let it be damaged in battle!<br/>
<br/>
As I said, just my 2 coppers worth...<br/>
