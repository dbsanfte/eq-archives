<div id="ygrps-yiv-455395661">Greeting<br/>
<br/>
i play a barbarian shaman lvl 15<br/>
my int is 61 and my char 88<br/>
<br/>
i have recently started blacksmithing and there is my 2 cent.<br/>
first i have only put 3 point in my skill.<br/>
I have started by sharpening weapon and surprise ! unlike its <br/>
always say in the different guide you find about this skill : when <br/>
you lacked the skill you don t loose both the weapon and the <br/>
sharpening stone but only the sharpening stone.  cost of one <br/>
sharpening stone 3 copper :) <br/>
may be its recent patch that have change that ?<br/>
<br/>
I also know that it will take you many time to get enought rusty <br/>
weapon to increase your skill. Well if you check the vendor near <br/>
you , you will probably find many rusty weapon to sell.<br/>
<br/>
Start with the cheapest one: rusty dagger and rusty axe (price <br/>
around 6 silver). when you sell them back to the vendor you will <br/>
loose around ... hum, five copper ? And those become trivial at 21 <br/>
skill. : )<br/>
<br/>
then use rusty mace until 24.<br/>
Then use rusty long sword until 26<br/>
then use rusty two handed sword until  ... don &#39;t find enought to <br/>
know when they become trivial. believe its 27<br/>
Sure you will loose more money as the price of the weapon <br/>
increase. up to five silver for each weapon and little more later ...<br/>
<br/>
I have bring my skill to 26 like this, using very few plate.<br/>
<br/>
Now here are some question.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone give me the cheapest way to increase my skill now?<br/>
Is it possible to make small brick of ore starting with small piece of <br/>
ore ?<br/>
many thanks for your help.<br/>
