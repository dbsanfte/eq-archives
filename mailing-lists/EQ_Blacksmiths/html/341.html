<div id="ygrps-yiv-746400833">I make money with ease off of smithing.  I sell very cheap yes..  and I<br/>
never have a problem finding customers.  I never will.  As long as<br/>
people continue to play the game.. as long as there are newbies  out<br/>
there.. people will continue to buy my banded and I will continue to<br/>
make a killing.</div>
