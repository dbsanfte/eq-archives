<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017890596">There is a vendor, not actually a shop. A few Ogres standing that have some <br/>
smithing stuff on them, but, I don&#39;t think it is has all the &quot;good&quot; molds. <br/>
Like scalers and stuff like that. Scalers is what I hear is the best. And I <br/>
don&#39;t think it has molds for any armor. For any size. So I couldn&#39;t make <br/>
armor either. So anything else?</div>
