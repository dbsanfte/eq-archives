<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627853623">1. Metal bits requires 2 small ore chunks and 1 flask of water. This is why you are getting that message.<br/>
<br/>
2. Some areas are better than others for certain trade skills. For example, Surefall Glade is great for fletchers and bowyers. Qeynos is not very good to smiths. It&#39;s a long way to find ore and you&#39;ll have to decide whether or not it&#39;s worth the effort. As an example, I myself play an ogre in Oggok. We have some molds and one forge but no ore. (We also have no file or scalar molds which makes using the available smithing guides useless). The troll city of Grobb next door has ore, but no molds or a forge. So basically when I was learning to forge, I had to constantly run over to Grobb to buy ore, then go back to Oggok to use the forge. I still have to do that actually as I have to make all my own sheets for armor as no one sells them. It&#39;s a hassle but it&#39;s been worth it. My skill is now over 100 and I&#39;m one of the only master smiths in the Oggok/Grobb region, meaning I have the entire ogre/troll market practically to myself.<br/>

I&#39;m a novice Blacksmith having a little trouble.  I&#39;m in Qeynos region,<br/>
where ore is tough to come by.  I bought some small chunks of ore from a<br/>
traveler, and I have been trying to make metal bits.  According to the book,<br/>
I should use a ore chunk and some water, but each time I try, I get a<br/>
message saying these quantities do not combine to produce anything.  So, my<br/>
questions are:<br/>
<br/>
1. How is the proper way to make metal bits? (What ingredients exactly)<br/>
<br/>
2. With lack of ore in my area, is there a better way to get started in<br/>
smithing?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all.<br/>

&gt;1) I would put in as many points as you can (Up till 21) to start.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;okay if you can only put in 14.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) Next, make Metal Bits until you have a bunch.  If you didn&#39;t put 21<br/>
&gt;points in at the beginning, you will reach 21 making Metal Bits.  Don&#39;t<br/>

&gt;3) Make scalers till 41.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4) Make lanterns till 68.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;5) Make skewers till 90&#39;s.  Once you get to the 90&#39;s, you can make every<br/>
&gt;piece of banded except leggings and cloaks fairly well.  If you want to<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;6) Keep making skewers till 115.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;7) Make pots till 122.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;8) Make sewing kits till 135.  Now, you can make every piece with ease.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It took me about 75pp (I put in 17 points in the beginning) to get to skill<br/>
&gt;90.  It took me 2 days (About 7 hrs total playing time) to get there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope this helps.<br/>
