<div id="ygrps-yiv-762549655">Absolutely correct on the closeness of ore being in Highpass. Add sharpening<br/>
stones to that list.<br/>

Maybe Ironforge had a shaman friend?  :-)<br/>

&gt; I actually paid less for my banded in quenos because the demand there was<br/>
&gt; lower.  Everyone in Freeport was ooc ing for banded.  In Quenos, I was the<br/>
&gt; only one at the time trying to get it.  I did not know that Shamans and<br/>
&gt; Necromancers had a spell that moved items.  I have never heard of anyone<br/>
&gt; bartering for this.  A Shaman could make a lot of money by moving ore to<br/>
&gt; people in Quenos.  I still cannot believe that ore can not be found in<br/>
&gt; Quenos and yet they have Ironforge Estate.  What is he using to make his<br/>
&gt; weapons ?    I understand that the closest place to get ore is from a NPC<br/>
&gt; in front of a mine entrance near Highpass.  Can anyone verify this ?<br/>
