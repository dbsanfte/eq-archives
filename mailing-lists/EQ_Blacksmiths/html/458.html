<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237452598">really, a very nice point. I agree with you for the most part. I just wish<br/>
it were practical to code :( It&#39;s not only difficult to code, but it borders<br/>
on &#39;sweeping changes&#39; that Brad talked about. Now that beta is over, there<br/>
can be no more &#39;sweeping changes&#39; like there used to be. In beta, that was<br/>
part of playing. Getting used to those changes. That can&#39;t happen in the<br/>
commercial release, it&#39;s VERY bad business :( I really wish it were<br/>
practical to do this, I like your idea. I just know it can never happen. We<br/>
can dream, though!!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, here is another possible idea, what do you all think:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Armor/Weapon QUALITY.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is no different than the idea of rusty and tarnished weapons<br/>
&gt; already in use, and could extend to the well-balanced.  I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; advocating true item deterioration.  The item would not go away.  It<br/>
&gt; simply gets &quot;used&quot; till it&#39;s not as good.  Also magical items do not<br/>
&gt; necessarily EVER get worn, they magically stay pristine.  Weaker magic<br/>
&gt; items, like those enchanted with minor bonuses would wear, but not Lore<br/>
&gt; Items for example.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So this is how it would work.  A Player gets an item and uses it.  From<br/>
&gt; use (and not from sitting in a bank box) the item takes wear and the<br/>
&gt; quality adjustment is made to it.  If player faction can be tracked for<br/>
&gt; every little thing, so can this.  It can be computed after fights in the<br/>
&gt; same way if need be.  Worn items work less effectively.  Less<br/>
&gt; absorbtion/less AC, slower duration/less damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Items which are worn are taken to a smith to repair/sharpen.  The amount<br/>
&gt; of improvement IS DEPENDENT ON THE SKILL OF THE SMITH.  Master smiths do<br/>
&gt; a better job.  Average smiths can only repair to a certain level. This<br/>
&gt; is both more realistic and helps make master more relevant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then there&#39;s NPCs.  Ok, so let NPCs sell all the same armor PCs can, at<br/>
&gt; realistic prices.  NPCs are not all masters.  Different smiths have<br/>
&gt; different skills.  PCs will always be able to attain a higher skill than<br/>
&gt; any NPC in the game.  Items sold from an NPC will immediately not be of<br/>
&gt; as good a quality as one made by a PC master.  If a player wants to buy<br/>
&gt; from an NPC at a cheaper price for a cheaper item, fine.  The NPC prices<br/>
&gt; ought to be lowered a bit, granted, but then that also goes to show that<br/>
&gt; PCs would then sell based on their skill.  Why should a master of 150<br/>
&gt; sell his items for the same as a new smith of 80 practicing gorgets?<br/>
&gt; The master has worked his up and should get a better quality product.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At the same time, NPCs should buy from PCs with quality in mind.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps an NPC gives a level or two price below the selling price of a<br/>
&gt; pristine piece.  As you get higher into master, you get more profit from<br/>
&gt; the selling.  Initially the only way for a PC to make profit would be<br/>
&gt; from other PCs, but then as you get might higher selling to NPCs would<br/>
&gt; generate a profit.  Smithing is expensive, as really all trades should<br/>
&gt; be (relatively speaking).  Brewing had the problem recently where you<br/>
&gt; could buy for nothing and sell for much more to NPCs as master, and make<br/>
&gt; master in an hour with only 5pp.  They&#39;ve reduced the profit to nearly<br/>
&gt; nothing now, and are introducing more brews for higher skill<br/>
&gt; advancement.  The same can apply to smithing.  Verant does not want<br/>
&gt; people to be able to make a living on a trade selling to NPCs.  But if a<br/>
&gt; player must spend 150pp+ and spend long hours to become a master that<br/>
&gt; makes just a little profit, good.  It&#39;ll not be worth the time or<br/>
&gt; money.  What it&#39;ll do it also stabilize the economy.  PCs wanting to buy<br/>
&gt; weapons and armor will have to buy from the NPCs, or by from a player at<br/>
&gt; better than what the NPC will take for it.  The only real &quot;deals&quot; for<br/>
&gt; players needing items will come from charity.  Better smiths will get a<br/>
&gt; better price from the NPC, and so their items will cost more to other<br/>
&gt; players.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The same goes for other trades like cooking, pottery and brewing that<br/>
&gt; tend to be only a sell to NPC market.  They will make  a profit, but not<br/>
&gt; that much and only more profit if they truly practice it higher.  All<br/>
&gt; skills should take a long time and more money to master.  That will make<br/>
&gt; the NPC profits more acceptable for Verant, and make being a master more<br/>
&gt; valuable as less attain it.  Think of tailoring where a master tailor<br/>
&gt; making reinforced can make better armor than a below average smith just<br/>
&gt; starting out.  And the reinforced will be far lighter.  It will make it<br/>
&gt; more worthwhile to have ALL the armor types in use.  All I see these<br/>
&gt; days is banded and bronze plate.  I don&#39;t even hear people selling ring<br/>
&gt; anymore.  Let smiths make it too.  That&#39;s why I keep mentioning weapons,<br/>
&gt; as smiths should be allowed to make them as much as any armor.  (Hmm<br/>
&gt; weapon smithing as a new skill separate from armor smithing...?  bowyer<br/>
&gt; and fletcher separate? tanner for hides, and tailor for sewing?  People<br/>
&gt; get to go to a &quot;specialist&quot; for their goods, again more realistic.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Items need not disappear.  Battered armor doesn&#39;t just go away, it&#39;s all<br/>
&gt; rusty and dented and needs some work.  A smith can add some metal bits,<br/>
&gt; and take his hammer and pliers to it and fix things up.  At the same<br/>
&gt; time, truly, all this magical item dropping from creatures should be<br/>
&gt; scaled back a little.  Regular weapons and armor dropped from mobs<br/>
&gt; should be of &quot;used&quot; lesser quality.  &quot;Why buy from a smith when I can<br/>
&gt; camp all I need from this mob?&quot;  Well because you get a better quality<br/>
&gt; item for your money and the smith&#39;s time.  It&#39;ll cut down on the campers<br/>
&gt; for one, and then make it so that having a magical item is worth<br/>
&gt; something.  A quest that always returns an item will be more worthwhile<br/>
&gt; than going after a mob that drops only 10% of the time.  All regular<br/>
&gt; armor would be purchased from smiths (NPC or PC) or at least repaired by<br/>
&gt; a smith when found or bought in the field.  PErhaps the thing to also do<br/>
&gt; it make it so that lesser mobs for players in the teens and twenties<br/>
&gt; tend to drop more &quot;charged&quot; items while the higher 30+ mobs drop more<br/>
&gt; permanent effect items.  Give out potions and 5 use items.  When they<br/>
&gt; are used up, they are useless or nearly so.  That&#39;ll maintain this<br/>
&gt; market of regular armors and weapons nicely.  Just seem that regular<br/>
&gt; items, leathers, chain, normal weapons are rare to all but those under<br/>
&gt; level 5.  Sad.  There are constant auctions of all these &quot;extra&quot; magical<br/>
&gt; items in every zone.  It&#39;s as Monty Hall as it can get.  Make it so<br/>
&gt; Smiths can actually MAKE things, and then make it so what they make is<br/>
&gt; USEFUL and then we will have a better place for smiths and well everyone<br/>
&gt; else too.<br/>
