<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887132217">I agree. Although I have actually been called a crook<br/>
for selling stuff at these prices. There is one guy on<br/>
Tunare that make and enitire suit minus the leggs for<br/>
70 plat. It would be nice if I could actually make a<br/>
profit. The going price is 1plat per ac on Tunare =(<br/>
as we have only on the RARE occassion been able to<br/>
sell for anything higher then that without being<br/>
openly laughed at.<br/>

&gt; upset when I tell them no.  The other source of<br/>
&gt; misinformation comes to<br/>
&gt; these people when they buy a banded gorget for 2-3pp<br/>
&gt; from the wannabee<br/>
&gt; smiths that never get there skill much past 50 (you<br/>
&gt; people on E Marr near<br/>
&gt; Freeport know who I am talking about).  There are<br/>
&gt; perhaps 5 of us really<br/>
&gt; active in smithing on E Marr and I know 2 of the<br/>
&gt; other people for sure.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll try to get in touch with them and see what they<br/>
&gt; think.  The prices<br/>
&gt; esposed on the site are about 1 to 2pp higher than I<br/>
&gt; charge now (5pp per<br/>
&gt; sheet needed to make an item, 15pp for cloaks).<br/>
