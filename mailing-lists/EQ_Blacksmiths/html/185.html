<div id="ygrps-yiv-128470626">I agree, Verant needs to spend a little time getting economy going. A few <br/>
changes, and it would be awsome. But, if they did what you are talking about <br/>
with the giving stuff thru bank accounts, what would the Shamans and <br/>
Necromancers do about there spells that allow them to send items to other <br/>
players. Plus, the economy for some things would be ruined. In Qeynos, banded <br/>
armor goes for a ton more than it does in Freeport. With being able to <br/>
transfer, this would be gone, and all the smith who travel to Qeynos to make <br/>
a killing would then not be able to do that, and the need for travel would be <br/>
gone.<br/>
