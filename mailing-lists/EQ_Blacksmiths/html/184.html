<div id="ygrps-yiv-86321828">I would like to see bank accounts where you could transfer items and money<br/>
into other peoples accounts.  It would make trading and selling items with<br/>
other people a lot easier.  What if you had a friend in Freeport that could<br/>
sell you ore.  You could put the money in his account, and then they could<br/>
put the item in your account.  The exchange would not actually take place<br/>
until both people agreed on what was being transferred to their account.<br/>
This would further the player economy that Verant is trying to encourage.<br/>
Another idea would be a trading post where people could put items in and<br/>
post a price.  If someone wanted to buy the item, they would pay the money<br/>
and get the item.  The money would then go into the sellers bank account.<br/>
