<div id="ygrps-yiv-986493705">How long did it take you to get to level 3??  I did it fairly quickly...<br/>
Only took a couple of hours!  In fact, I had level one done in less than an<br/>
hour..<br/>
<br/>
I was up to level 5 within the next 3-4 hours of play time (over a couple of<br/>
days for me) with a little help from another cleric friend (Thanks Devrill!)<br/>
who gave me a couple of pieces of patchwork armor (she was learning<br/>
tailoring) basically at cost and or free... I gave her pelts (and still do!)<br/>
<br/>
So your point of not being able to take on toughies in the first level is<br/>
true, yes, but you also don&#39;t NEED to really... But you won&#39;t DIE because<br/>
some Orc Pawn starts slamming on you either... your armor is likely to help<br/>
you get back to the guards a LITTLE easier if it&#39;s banded or plate!<br/>
<br/>
Then, when it comes time to start hunting Centurions and the like, you will<br/>
be up on the game again, with higher AC and such...  That&#39;s all.. If you<br/>
like that, then fine...  I found myself going out and getting killed ON<br/>
PURPOSE so that I could have more food and water without having to pay for<br/>
it!  Guess if I could have just gotten say, 100 plat right off the bat I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have to waste time killing myself... hehe... But it was good<br/>
practice on looting my corpse.... hehe...<br/>

&gt; Yeah they took care of twinking to a certain degree. Granted having Banded<br/>
&gt; Mail at 1st level would certainly help you. However at 1st level your<br/>
&gt; Offense and Defense are low, as is your weapon skill. Believe it our not,<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t make a huge difference.<br/>

&gt; &gt; It would take you several days to get up to 10th level, regardless of<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; &gt; armor or weapons you have.  AC on a twinked character, even if he/she is<br/>
&gt; &gt; wearing banded, is still not very high until you get to a higher<br/>
&gt; &gt; level.  You<br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t be able to fight red MOBs very much, because even though<br/>
&gt; &gt; you have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; FS Longsword, your 1h slashing skill might only be 30.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Joint bank accounts wouldn&#39;t be that great of an idea... For the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reasons you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stated, it would, but it would be abused too easily to help<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; *twink* another<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; character up...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think you would start seeing even more (there already are some)<br/>
lower<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; level characters wearing the best armor and having the best weapons<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; money can buy because they are &#39;sharing&#39; those items with the &#39;other&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; player...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; In other words:  I have a level 18 character that has all banded<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; armor and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Combine Staff - I put it into the bank, log out, log back on as a NEW<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; character that is level 1... he puts on the armor, grabs the<br/>
&gt; &gt; staff, and in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; just a few hours he is up to level 10!  Not worrying much about<br/>
getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; killed off because his AC is around 300 or so!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; No, no sharing of accounts...  BUT, I WOULD like to see some way<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for GUILDS<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to have a &#39;seperate&#39; account (for officers) to make it easier to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; handle the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; income and outlay of the guilds...<br/>
