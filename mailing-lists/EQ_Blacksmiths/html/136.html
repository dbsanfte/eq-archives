<b>Subject:</b> Massive Changes to Trade System? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-967385174">I saw this post on Stratics this morning:<br/>
<br/>
A massive revision to trade skills and the manners in which<br/>
they function will be implemented through an important patch<br/>
to be released approximately 2 months from now.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know what they are planning?  Any rumors?<br/>
<br/>
My Blacksmith skill is right around 24 right now, and I am not sure if I<br/>
should develop it any further, spending a ton of plat, if they plan on<br/>
changing the system drastically.<br/>
