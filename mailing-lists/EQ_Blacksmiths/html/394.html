<b>Subject:</b> Market in EQ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-707201831">I was reading an email from someone that compared the EQ market to the US market.  They stated that one reason they are different is because in RL things wear out and in EQ they are eternal.  This is so true.  Has anyone thought of or actually talked to Verant about having armor wear out?  This would cause buyers to go to smiths for repairs or replacements.  I don&#39;t know if this seems like a good idea or not.  I think it does.  Let me know what you all think of this idea.</div>
