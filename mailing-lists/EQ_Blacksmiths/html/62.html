<div id="ygrps-yiv-785829814">Didn&#39;t mean to sink your boat... there are several forums that your web page<br/>
would be quite welcome in.  This just doesn&#39;t happen to be one made for that<br/>
sort of thing. Go back to Onelist and fine the general forum and post there,<br/>
I am sure you will get a better responce from that crowd.<br/>

I&#39;d like to start off by thanking Reedo, Chet, and David for their kind<br/>
words. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately far more people seem to think I am some kind of loser for<br/>
trying tell you all that my site is out there. I was under the impression<br/>
that this mailing list was to keep people informed about EverQuest, and<br/>
particularly about Smithing.<br/>
<br/>
I have decided to no longer post any messages to any boards or lists. I am<br/>
now doing this site solely for my friends and those people who manage to<br/>
find it. I am sick of people complaining about something I do for free to<br/>
help them.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to be kept abreast of changes, just e-mail me saying so and I<br/>
will send an update notice directly to you.<br/>
<br/>
I think the site has a lot of potential considering that all the info comes<br/>
from me, and I have no real HTML experience. (Just bought a book yesterday.)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to have bothered anyone.<br/>

Personally I&#39;m really glad that he posted his web address.  He has some of<br/>
the best info on blacksmithing on the web.<br/>

&gt;Agreed! I like when smaller sites tell people they have updates. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;like it when they flood everyone, but I&#39;ve only seen 2 posts from this guy,<br/>
&gt;and I like his site. If he gets time to work on it, it could be very very<br/>
&gt;benificial. I&#39;ve been there a couple of times, and like the info there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve not had bad experience with people on boards, as I don&#39;t post much and<br/>
&gt;I delete babble very quickly. *shrug* Was annoying to come into work Monday<br/>
&gt;and have 149 new messages waiting...<br/>

&gt;HIM!! It does deal with EQ and that should be all that really matters. I am<br/>
<br/>
&gt;seeing a bad trend on the message board and in game and it has a lot to do <br/>
&gt;with things like this. PEOPLE ARE GETTING RUDE. I had better run ins with <br/>
&gt;pkers on UO then with the people im seeing in EQ and the mailing list. <br/>

&gt;as well as anyone else reading these that your probably at work, if you <br/>
&gt;werent you would be playing right now, so dont tell me you have something <br/>
&gt;better to be doing then reading these posts. I&#39;m not saying post anything <br/>
&gt;and everything, but this mailing list has done very well about staying on <br/>
&gt;subject, a couple of links to eq info sites is not going to kill anyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Rant over, return to your normal blacksmithing news.<br/>
