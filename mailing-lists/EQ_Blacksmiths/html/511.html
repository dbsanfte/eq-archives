<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803819506">Find some ore, and make some metal bits.  Say four stacks worth, as you will fail a few times making these.  Make some scalers with the bits, then make more bits.  Once bits become trivial, make a full backpack or two of them.  This is major carpal tunnel syndrom time, but it&#39;s necessary to do.  Keep making scalers until trivial.  Move on to lanterns, they cost a little more, but you fail a lot less, and don&#39;t lose much money.  Scalers are last until your skill hits 115, then you can try pots to 125(?) then sewing kits.  Although I found that pots and sewing kits don&#39;t give you very much skill.  Once you hit 125 in skill just sell all armor.<br/>

&gt;Greeting<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i play a barbarian shaman lvl 15<br/>
&gt;my int is 61 and my char 88<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i have recently started blacksmithing and there is my 2 cent.<br/>
&gt;first i have only put 3 point in my skill.<br/>
&gt;I have started by sharpening weapon and surprise ! unlike its <br/>
&gt;always say in the different guide you find about this skill : when <br/>
&gt;you lacked the skill you don t loose both the weapon and the <br/>
&gt;sharpening stone but only the sharpening stone.  cost of one <br/>
&gt;sharpening stone 3 copper :) <br/>
&gt;may be its recent patch that have change that ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also know that it will take you many time to get enought rusty <br/>
&gt;weapon to increase your skill. Well if you check the vendor near <br/>
&gt;you , you will probably find many rusty weapon to sell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Start with the cheapest one: rusty dagger and rusty axe (price <br/>
&gt;around 6 silver). when you sell them back to the vendor you will <br/>
&gt;loose around ... hum, five copper ? And those become trivial at 21 <br/>
&gt;skill. : )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;then use rusty mace until 24.<br/>
&gt;Then use rusty long sword until 26<br/>
&gt;then use rusty two handed sword until  ... don &#39;t find enought to <br/>
&gt;know when they become trivial. believe its 27<br/>
&gt;Sure you will loose more money as the price of the weapon <br/>
&gt;increase. up to five silver for each weapon and little more later ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have bring my skill to 26 like this, using very few plate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now here are some question.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can anyone give me the cheapest way to increase my skill now?<br/>
&gt;Is it possible to make small brick of ore starting with small piece of <br/>
&gt;ore ?<br/>
&gt;many thanks for your help.<br/>
