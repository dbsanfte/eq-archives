<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018681730">That is your opinion, to me, being able to make a lot of money in front of a <br/>
forge is great fun. And please tell me where you can get steel plate off <br/>
mobs? You can&#39;t. Bronze, yes, steel, no. Smithing is fun, just not too many <br/>
people want to put the effort in to it to make it that way.</div>
