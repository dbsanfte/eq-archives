<div id="ygrps-yiv-385494246">Price fixing can work if we all adhere to it. If 40 of those 50 smiths (an<br/>
accurate amount you can assume are on one of the two smithing lists I post to)<br/>
agree to fixing prices, those 10 smiths can&#39;t cover the whole server. As for<br/>
pricing, we&#39;re simply losing out right now. The banded market CAN&#39;T die by<br/>
people being angry at us. What are they going to do? Take up smithing<br/>
themselves? Sure, why not! Spend 200 platinum!! The need is still there for<br/>
banded whether the price is up or not. As long as we&#39;re not jerks about it and<br/>
we keep prices within reason, then we&#39;re ok. My banded prices are still less<br/>
than one third of chain, a lesser armor.<br/>
<br/>
As for this not working, don&#39;t worry! I have already changed to the prices I<br/>
posted here before. I now sell full suits for 130 plat instead of 100 as well. I<br/>
have sold less banded, true. I have also heard less whining! People don&#39;t<br/>
complain over my price, I tell them what my price is and they can either buy it<br/>
or shop around for another smith. They do just that :) I don&#39;t hear any whining<br/>
about it either, no matter what they decide. My ending income? I&#39;ve made more<br/>
money in the past two days than I have any other week at smithing. This works<br/>
GREAT, people still buy, and I don&#39;t hear price complaints! People even haggle<br/>
less than they do with lower prices! It&#39;s great!!<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ll try to respond to Scott and Dennis at the same time.  This will be a<br/>
&gt; long read.  You&#39;ve been warned. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will agree wholeheartedly that time is money.  If I had not spent the time<br/>
&gt; that I did smithing, I would be 10 levels higher with probably the same nice<br/>
&gt; equipment I have now.  But, I like smithing, I like interacting with the<br/>
&gt; community, and I like the nice items I am able to now buy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let&#39;s get something else out of the way as well.  Price fixing is never<br/>
&gt; going to work.  There are 50+ master smiths per server, with a new one<br/>
&gt; becoming a master smith every day.  Price fixing just won&#39;t happen unless<br/>
&gt; you can get a majority of the smiths together and hope that they are all<br/>
&gt; intelligent enough to understand that selling less at a more expensive price<br/>
&gt; is good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only feasible way of price fixing, which I practice occasionally, is to<br/>
&gt; collude with a fellow smith in the area.  If I am selling armor in greater<br/>
&gt; faydark and another smith starts selling, I sometimes (depending on their<br/>
&gt; attitude) price fix with them so we don&#39;t end up screwing eachother.  In the<br/>
&gt; end, we both make out because the consumers are forced to buy from one of<br/>
&gt; us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To kurt: Good for you!  Too bad you can&#39;t be everywhere on every server at<br/>
&gt; once.  So, the people that are buying from you are making out, but, that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; only one small corner of your server&#39;s market.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To Nick: I disagree, we have lots to lose.  We have a customer base and a<br/>
&gt; reputation.  If we start jacking our prices, our reputation is going to go<br/>
&gt; down the drain.  Believe it or not, word of mouth is a big contribution to<br/>
&gt; sales.  If this little plan fails, it may take a while to recover that lost<br/>
&gt; reputation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, I don&#39;t know why everyone is griping about not making enough money to<br/>
&gt; recuperate their initial costs.  I recovered my inital investment in the<br/>
&gt; first couple of days.  Perhaps the area you&#39;re selling in is not a very<br/>
&gt; popular banded area.  I sell in greater faydark and it&#39;s excellent.  GFay<br/>
&gt; offers many things that I love.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.  I am in reach of two sizes of molds, small and medium, which allows me<br/>
&gt; to sell to two groups of players increasing my customer base by 50% (Elves<br/>
&gt; prefer small, and there are not THAT many humans, barbarians, or<br/>
&gt; half-elves.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. I don&#39;t have to zone to use a bank, which means I don&#39;t have to carry my<br/>
&gt; wares on me, which means unlimited access to my supplies without zoning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. It is home to two races and adjacent to two more races.  A huge plus in<br/>
&gt; customer base.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. Perhaps the biggest reason of all, it is home to a HUGE level range.<br/>
&gt; Because of Crushbone, most elves, dwarves, and gnomes migrate to the<br/>
&gt; Crushbone area starting at level 5 and stay there throughout their early<br/>
&gt; teens.  At level 5, they see me advertising my armor.  Over the next three<br/>
&gt; days, they gain levels and money and continuously see me advertise my armor.<br/>
&gt; When they finally gain enough money, they put two and two together and ask<br/>
&gt; me for their banded armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Phew, I&#39;m exhausted, gonna go sell some more banded. ;)<br/>
