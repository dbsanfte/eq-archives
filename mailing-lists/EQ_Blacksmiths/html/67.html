<div id="ygrps-yiv-330025523">My smith is a Dark Elf, and I was wondering about smithing as a Dark Elf. <br/>
have a skill of 24 in smithing. But since I am not able to go into E. <br/>
Freeport which seems to go the smithing capital of the world what am I <br/>
supposed to do about getting molds?  Should I just start a good character or <br/>
something and go to Freeport? I would hate to do that, so if there is <br/>
anything that is possible in Neriak, or another evil town, would be greatly <br/>
appreciated. Not sure about Oggok or Grobb. Forget which molds are there. Any <br/>
information would be great, thanks.</div>
