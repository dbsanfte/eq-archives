<div id="ygrps-yiv-598926415">I am a level 17 dwarf warrior that has decided to pick up blacksmithing.  I accidently purchased about 5 of those 2pp ores from steamfront (don&#39;t ask), I have some sharpening stones (10) and a bunch of the other kinds of ore.  I have no idea how to start hehe.  Does anyone know of a website or any info on how to do and build this skill.  thanks in advance<br/>
