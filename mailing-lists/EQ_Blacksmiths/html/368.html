<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733859960">First of all, the RL name thing isn&#39;t meant to offend you. People call me &#39;Nick&#39; all the time,<br/>
be it in e-mail, message boards, or whatever. It&#39;s my name, I don&#39;t really care. If you do,<br/>
however, I&#39;ll respect that and stick to Cerran. I&#39;m not out to offend you, I&#39;m just trying to<br/>
prove a point<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not especially known for banded on my server, I&#39;m at an equal platform with everyone else.<br/>
If I can sell at a price, other people can too. So, when I sell at higher prices, that proves<br/>
to other smiths that they can as well. Instead of undermining my price and making less money<br/>
per sale, they can go to a different zone and sell for the same price I am. Sales are out<br/>
there, and if the market isn&#39;t oversaturated then they always will be. Why get less money and<br/>
contribute to market oversaturation at the same time? Both are negative things to a smith.<br/>
Charging less money, we both lose, charging the same price, we both win. I don&#39;t see how<br/>
somebody can justify competition between smiths as &#39;a good business strategy&#39;. If they charge<br/>
the same price as me, they&#39;ll make more money than if they charged less!! I make more money<br/>
since the price raise, it shouldn&#39;t be different for anyone else. As for new smiths who<br/>
haven&#39;t mastered the trade yet, I have no idea where you&#39;re getting your idea from. Why would<br/>
any reasonably intelligent person charge less for an item when they&#39;re in a higher need for<br/>
money? This is what you&#39;re telling me. Since they need money, they will charge a lower price.<br/>
Usually I put more logic into my arguments, but I can&#39;t even touch that because it simply does<br/>
not make sense. Newer smiths would want to charge higher prices so they can get more money so<br/>
they can spend more money on practicing their smithing! I&#39;m assuming that every new smith on<br/>
this board is in favor of the price raise. If you&#39;re a new smith and you aren&#39;t in favor of<br/>
price raising, frankly, you have your head shoved right up your ass. You&#39;re ruining the market<br/>
you&#39;re just getting into by selling at lower prices, and you&#39;re making less money now and in<br/>
the long run. There is no justification for that, it&#39;s just plain idiotic.<br/>

&gt; I appreciate you feeling personal enough to call people by their irl names so<br/>
&gt; I will do the same with you.  It is quite evident that you are trying to lead<br/>
&gt; this crusade for price fixing.  I would like to inform you that though EQ is<br/>
&gt; not an idealistic economy, nothing is.  So as you attempt to fix the prices<br/>
&gt; with the smiths that join you in this endeavor there will be many more that<br/>
&gt; will not.  You see not everyone is a master smith yet and they need to have<br/>
&gt; cash flow in order to improve upon this.  As you said noone compliments you<br/>
&gt; for being a nice guy or giving them good service, so they&#39;ll just go to the<br/>
&gt; guy who is selling armor at a cheap enough cost to make more and improve their<br/>
&gt; abilities.  The simple reason being that they don&#39;t care if you made it or<br/>
&gt; someone else did as long as it works.  That&#39;s why we will compete with<br/>
&gt; ourselves because the money you make does not go in the other smiths&#39; pockets.<br/>
&gt;  As long as people continue to join the EQ community there will be people who<br/>
&gt; want to learn to smith.  So when they lower their prices to build on their<br/>
&gt; skills and move inventory, that is where people will go.<br/>
