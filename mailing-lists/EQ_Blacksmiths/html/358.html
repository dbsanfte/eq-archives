	Lets take a good store: say Wal Mart.<br/>
<br/>
	If someone steals something, do they raise their prices? Yes. If their<br/>
store has items that are not sold very often, do they raise the price of<br/>
more commonly sold items to compensate? Yes. <br/>
<br/>
	Now, having said that, lets look at another phenomena. <br/>
<br/>
	I go to college and learn programming. Joe, he goes to school and doesn&#39;t<br/>
get more than his High School Diploma. Who makes more money? Who&#39;s skill is<br/>
more valuable?<br/>
<br/>
	Now granted I don&#39;t march out and say &quot;hey I want $50,000 up front because<br/>
that is what my schooling cost! But you would assume that over the next 3,<br/>
5, or 10 years you&#39;d more than exceed that price (of schooling/training) in<br/>
your quality of living and/or straight income.<br/>
<br/>
	The problem with EQ is that the economy&#39;s &quot;bottom&quot; is VERY LOW. In fact it<br/>
is CRITICALLY low. Most trade items cannot be sold to NPCs for even equal<br/>
to what it cost to make them (materials only). As a result, the player has<br/>
no reason to sell lower and lower, as he knows if he makes more than the<br/>
NPC gives him he&#39;s not totally losing out. Of course granted I&#39;ve seen<br/>
nobody sell for less than materials, but there is no given &quot;skill&quot; cost<br/>
because the bottom is so low.<br/>
<br/>
	If it wasn&#39;t for the fact that the word &quot;economy&quot; is only about how much<br/>
money is in the &quot;pool&quot; at any given time, vs. goods measured against money<br/>
in that pool (ie. the economy is non-existent), then EQ&#39;s economy would<br/>
crash horribly and irrepairably.<br/>
<br/>
	I agree with the first guy. The only way to ensure a decent profitability<br/>
in any amount of time measured less than months is to try and fix the prices.<br/>

I&#39;ve subscribed to this list to learn more about smithing not to collude with<br/>
all the other smiths in the game in an attempt to &quot;profit&quot; from customers by<br/>
setting arbitrary prices.  I myself am from the United States  where our<br/>
economy is capitalism.  We reject the ideas of collusion and oligopolies<br/>
because we believe that the one who builds the better mousetrap will win out. <br/>
EQ is showing us that as we saturate it with more and more smiths the prices<br/>
will be driven down due to increased supply.  I  read an email earlier about<br/>
someone who diversified himself and mastered other skills to sell items in<br/>
addition to his armor.  I apologize that I forgot your name,  and I&#39;ve already<br/>
deleted the email,  but you are the one who will succeed because you&#39;re<br/>
accepting the price war of armor and offering more to the customer.  If you<br/>
don&#39;t learn to offer more to the customer you will be priced out of the<br/>
market.  <br/>
