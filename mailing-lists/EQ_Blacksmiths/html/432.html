<div id="ygrps-yiv-397867746">then we agree to disagree. I&#39;m happy with my higher prices and lower time, you&#39;re happy with<br/>
your lower prices and higher time. As long as it works for you, it really doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
Price fixing is a majority based concept, as long as most of us do it, it&#39;s good :) Best of<br/>
luck to you and your smithing, and may our market last a long time before the crash :)<br/>

&gt; &quot;I&#39;ve worked my models on the assumption that there are a limited amount of<br/>
&gt; smiths out there..&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -This &quot;number of smiths&quot; cannot be quantified because more people decide to<br/>
&gt; become smiths everday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;This isn&#39;t a matter of competition, it&#39;s a matter of &#39;they want it if they<br/>
&gt; can get a fair price&#39;.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -Each smith individually has to determine what is a fair price as you hear<br/>
&gt; over and over again depending on their cost, their competition&#39;s pricining,<br/>
&gt; personality of the individual they are dealing with etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;if you want to make a few enemies, go ahead and undersell every smith you<br/>
&gt; see. All you&#39;ll get is a crashing market on your head and a poisoned dagger in<br/>
&gt; your back.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - I hope you&#39;re not implying that we cannot determine our own pricing on the<br/>
&gt; items we worked hard on to make for fear of making &quot;enemies.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Back to the point, though, your argument with me so far has been that price<br/>
&gt; fixing won&#39;t work<br/>
&gt; because people will always sell for lower and customers will refuse to buy for<br/>
&gt; the higher<br/>
&gt; price. The truth is, people are starting to sell for higher all across the<br/>
&gt; boards, and<br/>
&gt; customers are buying at a greater profit to those of us who have decided to<br/>
&gt; price raise.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Again read up on how price affects a supply and demand model.  The reason<br/>
&gt; people pay higher prices is not because the price is higher.  It&#39;s because the<br/>
&gt; demand is higher in comparison to the supply.  As more smiths  enter our<br/>
&gt; markets the supply will be higher. Either way this market is going to crash.<br/>
&gt; It won&#39;t be due to people undercutting themselves.  It&#39;s called planned<br/>
&gt; obsolesence.  If you don&#39;t know what that means, it&#39;s what other people have<br/>
&gt; talked about recently.  We are making products that once  our supply has met<br/>
&gt; the demand of the market we have have nothing but a bunch of worthless metal<br/>
&gt; in our inventory,  because there is no need to replace or repair the item.<br/>
&gt; With that in mind who wants to play musical chairs with their inventory and<br/>
&gt; pricing?  In truth I have never sold an item more than 10% less than what the<br/>
&gt; &quot;going price&quot; is,  but my point the whole time has been that I will not enter<br/>
&gt; into an agreement with people to set my prices.  I will sell my product on<br/>
&gt; what I deem to be a fair price.<br/>
&gt; Likewise if I feel prices are getting artificially high I won&#39;t increase my<br/>
&gt; prices for them.  I don&#39;t work in a nursing home.  I graduated with a degree<br/>
&gt; in accounting from one of the 10 best universities for accounting in the<br/>
&gt; country and am now working as a stock trader.  I will sell at the prices the<br/>
&gt; market demands as long as I&#39;m happy with my profits.  You can sell at yours<br/>
&gt; and hope the market doesn&#39;t disappear on you.<br/>
