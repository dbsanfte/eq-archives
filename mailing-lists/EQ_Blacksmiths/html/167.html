 </span></blockquote>That all depends on who you are...  Go to all the stores in your area and<br/>
check the price of milk!<br/>
<br/>
Then do the same with gasoline!  Price fixing is everywhere!  Where I live<br/>
(Santa Barbara), the CHEAPEST price for gasoline is $1.59 per gallon... Go<br/>
FARTHER away from the refineries to little old Lompoc (an extra 60 miles<br/>
away and 30 miles off the freeways) and the gas is only $1.39!!   Or, worse<br/>
yet, head to some southern states where the gasoline is only $1.25 or so...<br/>
<br/>
Price fixing is done by area and controlled by the markets themselves...<br/>
It&#39;s everywhere and on all sorts of products... the FTC is only interested<br/>
when they can get their names in the paper...</div>
