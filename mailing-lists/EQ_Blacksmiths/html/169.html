&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Oh, so do you think that the grocery store only charges you for the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>actual<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;cost of the product YOU are buying?  and not their &#39;losses&#39; from<br/>
 </span></blockquote>spoilage,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;theft, etc?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; a.  I didn&#39;t say I sold at cost, do the math, a tunic cost way less than<br/>
 </span></blockquote>15pp to make<br/>
<br/>
Oh, so you ARE out to make a profit then... (see your comments below)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; b.  at the grocery store I&#39;m not being charged outrageous fees because<br/>
 </span></blockquote>farmer A can&#39;t produce as apples as efficiently as farmer B<br/>
<br/>
Well, actually you are... and they too use &#39;price fixing&#39; at the wholesale<br/>
level by selling to brokers who then mark it up and sell to distributors who<br/>
then mark it up and sell to you.  But if famer A doesn&#39;t grow as many apples<br/>
he is &#39;subsidized&#39; on his pricing to match... Have you not noticed there are<br/>
&#39;seasons&#39; for fruit?  even though you can get fruit in ALL seasons?  It is<br/>
called SUPPLY AND DEMAND.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; c.  If I feel grocery store A is charging too much I go to grocery store B<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and buy the same merchandise at a lower price, so its up to grocer A to<br/>
lower their prices to meet consumer need/want, not up to grocer B to raise<br/>
their price to match the market &quot;standards&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Then do you go around and call the first store SCUM?  Or do you let them do<br/>
business because some people don&#39;t just shop on price, but on service and<br/>
other reasons?  Sounds like you are interested in LOW PRICES...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;So yes, you do have to consider costs of failures too... If a &#39;client&#39;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>came<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;up to you with all the raw materials and said &quot;Make me a tunic and I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>will<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;give you 5pp.&quot; Would you tell them Okay without mentioning that it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*might<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;not* work and they would be out the 5pp for the raw materials?  Or, if<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;failed with their materials would you then use your own until you were<br/>
 </span></blockquote>able<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;to produce one for them?  This would be a bad thing for you if it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>did... But<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;if that is your thinking, then the heck with ME learning to smith, I am<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;going to start ordering stuff from you all the time!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t work like that, if someone came up to me and said they had the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>materials, I would offer to buy the materials, then charge them my normal<br/>
price.  But that has never happened to me...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;In fact, please put me down for two tunics (I will sell one for 20pp<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;mine will only cost 10), or better yet, make it FOUR!  I can get a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>discount<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;for multiples, right??  hehe... (let&#39;s see now, if I get them for 13pp<br/>
 </span></blockquote>each<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;x4=52 plat... I can sell 3 x20=60... I get mine free AND make 8 plat!<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;without smithing!! Kewl!!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; a.  I sell tunics for 15, you should read more carefully<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did read carefully... do the math... two tunics (at your price) would be<br/>
30p... I would sell one for 20, then mine would only cost me 10 ---<br/>
20+10=30p  But you wouldn&#39;t offer any discounts?  Oh, so YOUR prices ARE<br/>
fixed then?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; b.  people like you make me sick.....you&#39;d take advantage of someone<br/>
 </span></blockquote>trying to do the community a favor (me) by buying my stuff cheap and selling<br/>
at much higher prices for your own personal gain.  &quot;Screw thy fellow man&quot;<br/>
must be your motto of life.<br/>
<br/>
hey, hey, hey... If you feel ill, perhaps it is because you don&#39;t like to<br/>
hear about others making money off of &#39;Your&#39; stuff... Well, that&#39;s the way<br/>
it is done all over... Buy cheap, sell for a profit... Heck, YOU are doing<br/>
it too!  You make money off of the &#39;skill&#39; of smithing... Is it wrong for<br/>
someone else to make money off of the &#39;skill&#39; of selling?  If I can sell<br/>
your products for you, to others you don&#39;t know, or can&#39;t reach, then am I<br/>
not helping you also?  or do you want Exclusive rights to everything you<br/>
sell?  Or do you just want to FIX the price of something that YOU make.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; c.  You would get no such discount from me, infact I&#39;d probably charge you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>40pp per tunic due to your own greed.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and your not greedy at all... No discounts, Fixed price of 15p but it<br/>
costs you only 5p, so that is 150% profit... No, that is a FAIR markup,<br/>
isn&#39;t it?  Sure, you don&#39;t mind paying 150% markup on your things, do you?<br/>
But if someone else tries to mark it up 33% above THEIR cost (20p selling vs<br/>
15p they would pay you) then THEY are the greedy ones, eh?  Tsk, tsk...  And<br/>
you STILL would make 150% profit...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Of course if I order more, you should give me an even BIGGER discount<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;because, after all, I am HELPING you to learn to be a better smith,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>right?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Lemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I generally don&#39;t give discounts on bulk purchases because either someone<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is trying to take advantage of my low prices, or they are trying to twink<br/>
out their guild buddies.<br/>
<br/>
And that would hurt you how?  Because you don&#39;t want to sell to his buddies?<br/>
or because you think that YOU are the only one that should sell to them?<br/>
Convienent for you, but not necessarily for them... If you are only on 4<br/>
hours a night, and someone else is on 4 hours in the DAY, they cannot buy<br/>
your products, and you cannot sell to them... But heaven forbid someone else<br/>
would want to use their time and effort to provide YOUR products for sale to<br/>
others...<br/>
<br/>
Think small, be small...<br/>
<br/>
I only hope that when I can finally make armor and sell it, that I can sell<br/>
AS MUCH AS I CAN MAKE for a GOOD price to make ME a profit... Smithing is a<br/>
business as well as a service... I already give away my healings and buffs<br/>
without charging my fellow players... Why shouldn&#39;t I try to make a profit<br/>
for myself smithing or reselling?<br/>
