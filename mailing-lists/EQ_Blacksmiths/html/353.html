<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140040584">Aye you are right brother smith we can make sheets, I was confused on making<br/>
the bricks of ore to make the sheets, am I correct in this assumption that<br/>
we cannot make the sheets ?<br/>
 Oh and where does one get the blue ore?<br/>
WARNING LONG POST :)<br/>
Now I would like to say my 2 cents on our prices.<br/>
 First if we all agree to stick to a set price then we will get what we ask<br/>
for, cornering the market so to speak. Im not saying make the prices so<br/>
outrages that they cannot afford to buy from us, but at least make it a<br/>
profitable trade once again. Yes, there will be the rouge who comes thru<br/>
once a month and sells for a lesser price, but, thats once a month. I feel<br/>
that for all of our well being we need to band ( no pun intended ) together<br/>
to make this work. If you want to sell, or even give away the occasional<br/>
piece for cost or slightly above cost at least keep it under the table. I do<br/>
this once in awhile to build a good reputation with my clients. It works<br/>
believe me. Sell Bob a set of bracers for 8pp because he&#39;s down on his luck<br/>
or whatever reason you choose, but tell Bob to keep it to himself, but tell<br/>
him what you would like in return is for him to advertise for you, and in<br/>
return you will give him better pricing, this works!!! I was in gfay and did<br/>
this, sent out my auction, next thing I knew &quot;Bob&quot; was shouting about what a<br/>
great smith and guy I was on my prices etc etc, I made 5 complete suits of<br/>
banded within about 90 mins, made 600pp, and in return I gave &quot;Bob&quot; his<br/>
tunic at cost.<br/>
 Maybe Im wrong here to some of you and I dont need your flames etc. All I<br/>
am saying is that,the prices I sell for are about what we are talking about,<br/>
it just takes word of mouth to get the forge a hoppin and WE are making  a<br/>
profit again.<br/>

&gt; Aye, we can make sheets... same way as detailed in the book. We cannot,<br/>
&gt; however, make folded sheets... Now, I&#39;ve heard rumors galore, but the<br/>
&gt; one that seems to keep turning up the most is that we will not be able to<br/>
&gt; forge folded sheets until the expansion comes out, which seriously pisses<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW, Banded will only take you to 175 skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, has anyone played with the Blue Ore yet? I tried a couple<br/>
&gt; combinations,<br/>
&gt; one brick one flask, and then two bricks one flask, no combine on both<br/>
&gt; attempts. If anyone has had any success, please let me know. Otherwise<br/>
&gt; I assume that this end product has been &quot;administratively broken&quot; just as<br/>
&gt; the folded sheets are.<br/>
