<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450780461">I did some smithing this morning, and despite my high hopes, nothing seems to<br/>
have changed.<br/>
<br/>
I made metal bits, and things were exactly the same, no multiples, even if I<br/>
used multiple units.<br/>
<br/>
I made skewers, and the mold disappeared whether I failed or succeeded.<br/>
<br/>
I made some banded (or tried to anyway), and the mold disappeared here too.<br/>
<br/>
They never specifically said that molds would NOT disappear, but they certainly<br/>
implied it with their baking and sharpening stone examples.<br/>
<br/>
Disappointed,<br/>
