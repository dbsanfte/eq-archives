<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062678077">I am at 21 blacksmithing and sharpening hasn&#39;t become trivial.  How do you<br/>
know when it does become trivial?  Also is there a book you can by in the<br/>
game that tells you how to make banded armor and different stuff?  I have no<br/>
idea what I need and I just have the basic blacksmithing book.</div>
