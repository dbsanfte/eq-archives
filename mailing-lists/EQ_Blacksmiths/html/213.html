<div id="ygrps-yiv-7703122">Well, the good news about Twinking is that it will probably cause those<br/>
doing it to get bored fairly quickly... I mean how many characters will you<br/>
make and take up to level 50 before you finally decide your tired of it<br/>
all...<br/>
<br/>
So, for those of us that plan on doing things *the right way* and following<br/>
the rules (mostly), things will start to get better over time... in fact, I<br/>
started a new character (also on Karana) and found that the *newbie* area is<br/>
practically EMPTY compared to when I first started (which was about 2 weeks<br/>
into the games debut).  So, you can actually level up FASTER because there<br/>
is less competition... Also, you can level faster because you KNOW more<br/>
about: 1) How to play... 2) where to go... 3) what to look for...<br/>
<br/>
So, hopefully things will only get BETTER...  At least that&#39;s what I am<br/>
hoping for...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I did see ONE newbie (level 5 Cleric) who already had full banded... he<br/>
had twinked it from his *other* character which was a level 25...<br/>

&gt; the camping problem is directly related to twinkers.  when someone is<br/>
camping an item, they get their item and should move on....but they<br/>
don&#39;t....they continue to camp to get more items to twink their guild<br/>
buddies, or to twink their other characters......mean while I can&#39;t get the<br/>
item due to their twinking.....direct relationship there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The people who deserve the items are the ones that are willing to get them<br/>
with the character that is going to use them......ie no camping rubicite<br/>
with your 40th lvl wizard to give to your 5th lvl warrior<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; greedy bastards all over the place, ruining the game for everyone simply<br/>
so they can twink out their newbie characters or friends, blah<br/>

&gt; What&#39;s crazy about level 5 in rubicite? It&#39;s odd, even frustrating, but<br/>
&gt; so what? You haven&#39;t answered my question; merely given another example<br/>
&gt; of it. Now the camping situation is something entirely different... and<br/>
&gt; not directly related to twinking. Do you think that if they weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; twinking they&#39;d move on? I sure don&#39;t. I&#39;m willing to bet they&#39;d just<br/>
&gt; camp then sell the things. Actually, I&#39;d prefer to see someone camping<br/>
&gt; for the sole purpose of giving &#39;em away. After all, that just means that<br/>
&gt; whoever they&#39;re giving them to will have no reason to camp there. And<br/>
&gt; how do you determine who &#39;deserves&#39; the items? I think you&#39;re speaking<br/>
&gt; on a level of personal frustration... which is completely<br/>
&gt; understandable, but difficult to defend logically.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In any case, here&#39;s to few campers, great loot drops and wildly<br/>
&gt; efficient xp.<br/>

&gt; &gt; depends on what is being twinked.....a lvl 5 in full rubicite is crazy.<br/>
Not only that, but people who twink out their other characters like this are<br/>
the people who FARM items.  They camp until they get their item, which I<br/>
don&#39;t have a problem with, then they continue to camp camp camp camp camp to<br/>
get crap for their guild buddies and for their lower lvl characters,<br/>
depriving the people who DESERVE the items the chance to get them....and<br/>
thats where I have a problem with twinking.<br/>
