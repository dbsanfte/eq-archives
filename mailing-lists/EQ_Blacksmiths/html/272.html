I have a smithing question that might first look<br/>
like a fletching questions, but please bear with<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
To develop my fletching skill I make arrows - bows<br/>
are much too expensive for a failure.  Before the<br/>
recent change to the skills I would buy a batch<br/>
of raw materials from the fletching supplier and<br/>
tediously make arrows, frequently getting a<br/>
message that my skill had gone up.  I sold the<br/>
completed arrows back to a merchant in my guild<br/>
to minimize the cost of gaining skill.  (The<br/>
market for arrows isn&#39;t so hot.)  In my most<br/>
recent training exercise I went from a skill of<br/>
69 to a skill of 74.  The outlay, after buying<br/>
raw materials and selling the completed arrows,<br/>
was about 2.5 pp, or about 5g/skill point.  All<br/>
this was before the patch.  Note that this cost<br/>
is very different than using the skill points<br/>
you get when you gain levels, I&#39;m not talking<br/>
about that.<br/>
<br/>
Fletchers complained bitterly about having to<br/>
make single arrows.  Verant responded with a<br/>
solution that sells components in batches of<br/>
five and produces arrows in batches of five.<br/>
The problem is, the skill level is based on the<br/>
number of times the fletcher hits the &quot;combine&quot;<br/>
key.  The tediousness of making arrows has been<br/>
fixed, but the price of gaining skill points has<br/>
been multiplied by a factor of five.<br/>
<br/>
My question to you smiths is, do you know how<br/>
much it costs to increase your skill?  In the<br/>
range from 60 to 80 is it 5g/point, or<br/>
2.5pp/point?  Or is it far different than that?<br/>
I appreciate your patience in reading through<br/>
this.  Thank you.<br/>
