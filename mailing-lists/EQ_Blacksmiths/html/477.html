<div id="ygrps-yiv-738836491">Smithing, being one of the more expensive trades, varies considerably in<br/>
how long it takes you to master, how much it costs, and whether it&#39;s<br/>
ever profitable at all.  One example.  I mainly play a Dwarf.  My<br/>
charisma is 45 base, and even with a few points of adjustment from items<br/>
my elven friend can purchase materials for me for 25% less than<br/>
merchants well sell to me.  If I have to buy everything myself, as I<br/>
normally do, my costs are significantly higher.  I&#39;ve spent roughly<br/>
150pp so far.  I know some make it in 100pp.  It&#39;ll probably take me<br/>
another 50pp at most to finish up. Your Int score does help you raise<br/>
skills faster.  If you&#39;re not a mage, as I am not, you may find that<br/>
sometimes you simply don&#39;t raise all that fast and have to work longer<br/>
and pay more.  And then there&#39;s the profits.  Smithing is not an NPC<br/>
profit skill.  The market is solely other players.  If you want to make<br/>
a good profit on smithing, you want to be on a less populated server.<br/>
Partially this is because of other smiths; too many and some tend to<br/>
drop their prices so low that the market is ruined.  I play on Fennin<br/>
Ro.  Last night I was trying to sell a couple bracers and a gorget.  I<br/>
had already dropped my price of them to 5pp each knowing the sad market,<br/>
but I was broke and needed the pp to do some more trade practice.  I<br/>
couldn&#39;t sell anything even at that price because there were two people<br/>
selling for 2pp and 4pp.   I couldn&#39;t afford to sell for less at the<br/>
time.  It&#39;s not always the other smiths either as that was in the<br/>
Freeport area and a couple nights ago I was in Kelethin working skewers<br/>
and didn&#39;t bother selling any banded because bronze plate was going for<br/>
just a few plat each.  The Monty Hall environment has nearly ruined the<br/>
trade economy in Fennin Ro.  There are so many people with so much<br/>
stuff, what one guy can make is simply not worth much.  Yes, you can<br/>
make some sales if you are patient, don&#39;t need the money, and sell when<br/>
the server is down to 1200 or less people.  But forget high usage times<br/>
and easy sales.  They are rare.  This not meant to make you not want to<br/>
smith, it&#39;s an admirable trade. It takes long enough that you should<br/>
feel pretty good about making master.  But I recommend you do it on a<br/>
server with less people so you have more people who need you.  You will<br/>
have a better time and they will probably be quite glad they were able<br/>
to find a good smith at all.<br/>

I&#39;m a closet blacksmith wanna-be.  I have mastered<br/>
fletching (because I&#39;m a ranger and it seemed<br/>
like a good idea at the time) and found it to be<br/>
non-profitable.  I mastered pottery (because I&#39;m<br/>
greedy) but they&#39;ve made it so it&#39;s not profitable.<br/>
Because of my pottery history, money is not too big<br/>
of an issue, so I&#39;m looking for another trade to<br/>
master - that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.<br/>
<br/>
How much does it cost to develop smithing to the<br/>
point that it becomes profitable?  I realize I need<br/>
a definition here, but let me just ask for a feeling<br/>
of the skill level where the cash inflow is positive,<br/>
and an estimate of the cash outlay to get there.<br/>
<br/>
I am a wood-elf (and perpetually encumberred) that<br/>
is normally in Kelethin.  I know (think) Steamfont<br/>
is the closest place for ore and that&#39;s a long run -<br/>
should I relocate?  Ak-Anon is out.  Those guys really<br/>
hate me there.  How about Kaladim?  Somewhere else?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read most of the guides on the web, and some<br/>
of them seem out of date. Can you suggest any?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.  BTW can I interest you in a good<br/>
bow, or perhaps a pot . . . maybe a mixing bowl?</div>
