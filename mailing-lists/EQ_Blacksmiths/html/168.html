 </span></blockquote>I find this an interesting comment.  You state, if not through words<br/>
then through your stated intention of action, that you feel the free<br/>
market should rule; that if one smith is charging five plat less than<br/>
another for a particular item, that the free market will come into<br/>
effect.  You state buyers are free to go where they wish with their<br/>
purchasing power.<br/>
<br/>
If he can make purchases from smiths and then resell his purchases at a<br/>
higher price to buyers willing to pay the price, he&#39;s FOLLOWING THE<br/>
FREE MARKET THEORY!  In fact, he would be what we&#39;re all familar with<br/>
in real life, the &#39;middle man&#39;.  Here&#39;s an example:<br/>
<br/>
Joe the MiddleMan is a character of high enough level to make a decent<br/>
amount per hour of adventuring.  He takes his plat and uses it to<br/>
bankroll his purchasing of smiths&#39; wares in his area; making it his<br/>
goal to try and buy as much as possible from the smiths.  He then<br/>
responds to WTB auctions with the product he has &#39;warehoused&#39;, and<br/>
marks it up accordingly.  In this fashion, he proceeds forward; buying<br/>
product regularly off of smiths and holding it until a buyer appears.<br/>
<br/>
Now, *anyone*, producer or middleman or<br/>
end-user-reselling-to-another-end-user, *anyone*; who charges an<br/>
excessive amount over the production cost and/or purchase price can<br/>
have qualities such as greed ascribed to them, with a fair amount of<br/>
truth.  But if one believes in the Free Market, then it&#39;s all fair.  If<br/>
one believes in the Free Market, then any price charged will either be<br/>
a successful price (meaning, buyers will pay it), or will not be a<br/>
successful price (no buyers appear).<br/>
<br/>
Further, how fair is it of *you* to *other smiths* to set your prices<br/>
so low they have difficulty making any sort of money.  The master smith<br/>
decides, &quot;hey, I have a skill of 150!  I can make product with a very<br/>
low failure rate, meaning I don&#39;t have much waste.  I know, I&#39;ll sell<br/>
it for five or ten plat over the materials cost!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all fine and well for the master smiths; but the up and coming<br/>
smiths are faced with an *even longer* road to tred, if they have any<br/>
notions of being able to produce their product for profit.  If the<br/>
master smiths are selling at a price designed to allow for only one<br/>
*failure* over two or three or even more attempts, lesser smiths will<br/>
be hard pressed to sell at a profit at similar pricing levels (because<br/>
the lesser smith will have one *success* over two or three or even more<br/>
attempts).<br/>
<br/>
You say you&#39;re doing the community a favor by charging a low, low<br/>
price; but what community are you serving, ultimately?  The buyer with<br/>
money in hand gets a great deal as smiths begin to lower prices to<br/>
match the lowest; but eventually smiths begin to throw up their hands<br/>
and quit bothering, reducing the availability of armor.  So the<br/>
community you&#39;re &#39;doing a favor&#39; is really only a few early buyers, and<br/>
smiths that are happy to sell at near unprofitable levels; because the<br/>
other smiths take it up the backside, and others interested in smithing<br/>
are prevented from doing something they wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
Now, it is a Free Market, as you say.  But if you&#39;re going to ascribe<br/>
notions of greed and negative emotion to &#39;middleman resellers&#39;, then<br/>
you are not immune to similar labels against you from other smiths. <br/>
How is what the middleman reseller does any more &#39;greedy&#39; than what the<br/>
master smith does to the lesser smith?  I&#39;d say it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s all<br/>
business, and business is war; but if you&#39;re going to start throwing<br/>
negative labels around, you&#39;d better be sure you&#39;re not engaging in<br/>
hypocracy.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, I&#39;ll point out (as others have attempted to do in the<br/>
past), that real life businesses are engaged in the free market of our<br/>
capitalistic society (which, despite some problems, works pretty well);<br/>
but they also have amounts of sanity mixed in amid the incessent<br/>
competitive pricing wars.  They don&#39;t charge prices designed to drive<br/>
themselves out of business; not without actually going out of business<br/>
sooner or later.  Real car manufacturers charge a price per car<br/>
designed to enable them to recoup capital investment costs, raw<br/>
materials costs, costs of training and labor, and the costs of<br/>
unsellable product.<br/>
<br/>
The difference between EQ smiths and real life businesses it that the<br/>
CEO (PC smith) can&#39;t take his Board of Directors (group) out to the<br/>
dungeons and kill stuff for a few hours to get more money with which to<br/>
then go back out and sell product at a loss again.<br/>
