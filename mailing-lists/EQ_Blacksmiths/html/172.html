<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629025709">I think that would be a SUPER idea!  What server are you on?  I want to make<br/>
sure to get in on this deal myself!<br/>
<br/>
I am sure you will recognize me by my warm smile (and name below)... but of<br/>
course I could always use a different name too!  I have a few characters...<br/>
<br/>
But please do lower your prices!  This will make it soooo much easier for me<br/>
to buy them and then sell them to others at a small markup (less than YOURS<br/>
is I bet!)... Let me know when and where?<br/>

&gt; &gt; b.  people like you make me sick.....you&#39;d take<br/>
&gt; &gt; advantage of someone trying to do the community a<br/>
&gt; &gt; favor (me) by buying my stuff cheap and selling at<br/>
&gt; &gt; much higher prices for your own personal gain.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Screw thy fellow man&quot; must be your motto of life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I find this an interesting comment.  You state, if not through words<br/>
&gt; then through your stated intention of action, that you feel the free<br/>
&gt; market should rule; that if one smith is charging five plat less than<br/>
&gt; another for a particular item, that the free market will come into<br/>
&gt; effect.  You state buyers are free to go where they wish with their<br/>
&gt; purchasing power.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If he can make purchases from smiths and then resell his purchases at a<br/>
&gt; higher price to buyers willing to pay the price, he&#39;s FOLLOWING THE<br/>
&gt; FREE MARKET THEORY!  In fact, he would be what we&#39;re all familar with<br/>
&gt; in real life, the &#39;middle man&#39;.  Here&#39;s an example:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Joe the MiddleMan is a character of high enough level to make a decent<br/>
&gt; amount per hour of adventuring.  He takes his plat and uses it to<br/>
&gt; bankroll his purchasing of smiths&#39; wares in his area; making it his<br/>
&gt; goal to try and buy as much as possible from the smiths.  He then<br/>
&gt; responds to WTB auctions with the product he has &#39;warehoused&#39;, and<br/>
&gt; marks it up accordingly.  In this fashion, he proceeds forward; buying<br/>
&gt; product regularly off of smiths and holding it until a buyer appears.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, *anyone*, producer or middleman or<br/>
&gt; end-user-reselling-to-another-end-user, *anyone*; who charges an<br/>
&gt; excessive amount over the production cost and/or purchase price can<br/>
&gt; have qualities such as greed ascribed to them, with a fair amount of<br/>
&gt; truth.  But if one believes in the Free Market, then it&#39;s all fair.  If<br/>
&gt; one believes in the Free Market, then any price charged will either be<br/>
&gt; a successful price (meaning, buyers will pay it), or will not be a<br/>
&gt; successful price (no buyers appear).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Further, how fair is it of *you* to *other smiths* to set your prices<br/>
&gt; so low they have difficulty making any sort of money.  The master smith<br/>
&gt; decides, &quot;hey, I have a skill of 150!  I can make product with a very<br/>
&gt; low failure rate, meaning I don&#39;t have much waste.  I know, I&#39;ll sell<br/>
&gt; it for five or ten plat over the materials cost!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s all fine and well for the master smiths; but the up and coming<br/>
&gt; smiths are faced with an *even longer* road to tred, if they have any<br/>
&gt; notions of being able to produce their product for profit.  If the<br/>
&gt; master smiths are selling at a price designed to allow for only one<br/>
&gt; *failure* over two or three or even more attempts, lesser smiths will<br/>
&gt; be hard pressed to sell at a profit at similar pricing levels (because<br/>
&gt; the lesser smith will have one *success* over two or three or even more<br/>
&gt; attempts).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You say you&#39;re doing the community a favor by charging a low, low<br/>
&gt; price; but what community are you serving, ultimately?  The buyer with<br/>
&gt; money in hand gets a great deal as smiths begin to lower prices to<br/>
&gt; match the lowest; but eventually smiths begin to throw up their hands<br/>
&gt; and quit bothering, reducing the availability of armor.  So the<br/>
&gt; community you&#39;re &#39;doing a favor&#39; is really only a few early buyers, and<br/>
&gt; smiths that are happy to sell at near unprofitable levels; because the<br/>
&gt; other smiths take it up the backside, and others interested in smithing<br/>
&gt; are prevented from doing something they wanted to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, it is a Free Market, as you say.  But if you&#39;re going to ascribe<br/>
&gt; notions of greed and negative emotion to &#39;middleman resellers&#39;, then<br/>
&gt; you are not immune to similar labels against you from other smiths.<br/>
&gt; How is what the middleman reseller does any more &#39;greedy&#39; than what the<br/>
&gt; master smith does to the lesser smith?  I&#39;d say it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s all<br/>
&gt; business, and business is war; but if you&#39;re going to start throwing<br/>
&gt; negative labels around, you&#39;d better be sure you&#39;re not engaging in<br/>
&gt; hypocracy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And finally, I&#39;ll point out (as others have attempted to do in the<br/>
&gt; past), that real life businesses are engaged in the free market of our<br/>
&gt; capitalistic society (which, despite some problems, works pretty well);<br/>
&gt; but they also have amounts of sanity mixed in amid the incessent<br/>
&gt; competitive pricing wars.  They don&#39;t charge prices designed to drive<br/>
&gt; themselves out of business; not without actually going out of business<br/>
&gt; sooner or later.  Real car manufacturers charge a price per car<br/>
&gt; designed to enable them to recoup capital investment costs, raw<br/>
&gt; materials costs, costs of training and labor, and the costs of<br/>
&gt; unsellable product.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The difference between EQ smiths and real life businesses it that the<br/>
&gt; CEO (PC smith) can&#39;t take his Board of Directors (group) out to the<br/>
&gt; dungeons and kill stuff for a few hours to get more money with which to<br/>
&gt; then go back out and sell product at a loss again.<br/>
