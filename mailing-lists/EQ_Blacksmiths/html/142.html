<div id="ygrps-yiv-420620807">Ok, I am currently a level 54 smith, practicing by making skewers... Mostly because I can&#39;t seem to find the &#39;bottles&#39; needed to make Lanterns (BTW, are these working lanterns you can use or sell to PC&#39;s?) anyplace in Freeport... Only bottles with stuff in them (like booze, milk, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
What I REALLY would like to know is:  What level must you be at to make Banded Armor fairly successfully (say 33% of the time or more)  and also, how long should I keep making skewers for practice?<br/>
<br/>
Also, why is it that smiths seem to be selling banded armor SOOoooo cheaply on the Karana Server?  I have seen Gorgets as low as 3 plat, bracers for 4pp or 2 for 7pp... And even a full suit for around 60pp!  I would think that would be LESS than cost if you factor in the cost of getting to that level of smithing... But hey, let us only hope these people do not try to start a RL business... <br/>
