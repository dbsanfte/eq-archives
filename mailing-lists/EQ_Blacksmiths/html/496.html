<div id="ygrps-yiv-530711175">Greetings all....<br/>
   One quick question. I have been doing smithing for what seems like<br/>
forever and am way above master level. However, in all my time of smithing<br/>
I have yet to see or find a mold for banded gloves though I&#39;ve had many<br/>
MANY customers request them. Does anyone know if banded gloves even exist<br/>
and if so are there molds to make them or must they be bought from<br/>
merchant...and if there are molds to make them...where the heck are they<br/>
hiding them?? lol Thanks much for any help. ;)<br/>
