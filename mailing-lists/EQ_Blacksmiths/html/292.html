<div id="ygrps-yiv-931942995">scalers are trivial at 41, no way you be popping out the banded at that <br/>
level. Oh ya, no one wants banded anymore, so it is really pointless to try <br/>
and sell anything. In what I have seen on my server, most people want bronze <br/>
armor. You can still sell, but a lot more diffucult to do so.</div>
