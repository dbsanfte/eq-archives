<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071080940">That sounds like a market to me. Hire a druid/shaman/bard to assist you with<br/>
running & carrying. Make a run to Highhold, or Freeport. Load up as many<br/>
backpacks of ore that you and whomever is with you can carry. Then return to<br/>
Qeynos to sell. Add a little markup on each piece.<br/>

&gt; I actually paid less for my banded in quenos because the demand there was<br/>
&gt; lower.  Everyone in Freeport was ooc ing for banded.  In Quenos, I was the<br/>
&gt; only one at the time trying to get it.  I did not know that Shamans and<br/>
&gt; Necromancers had a spell that moved items.  I have never heard of anyone<br/>
&gt; bartering for this.  A Shaman could make a lot of money by moving ore to<br/>
&gt; people in Quenos.  I still cannot believe that ore can not be found in<br/>
&gt; Quenos and yet they have Ironforge Estate.  What is he using to make his<br/>
&gt; weapons ?    I understand that the closest place to get ore is from a NPC<br/>
&gt; in front of a mine entrance near Highpass.  Can anyone verify this ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank You,<br/>
