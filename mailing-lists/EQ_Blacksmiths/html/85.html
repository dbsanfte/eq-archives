&gt; Here&#39;s some good questions and answers for every dark elf.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Two ogre chicks in Foreign quarter have lots of molds.  File being one of<br/>
&gt; them.  Not sure about skewer or scaler though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Guy in 2nd level of Toadstool Inn sells armor molds not sure where weapon<br/>
&gt; molds are or .... really I&#39;ve not heard anything about making weapons so I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know anything about that. =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok what is better to make for skill improvement scalers or skewers?  If<br/>
&gt; there isn&#39;t one better then which is cheaper and where is it found in Neriak<br/>
&gt; if possible.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was told that Skewers are good because they are so hard.  I guess it&#39;s<br/>
sorta like when you are in combat, you learn combat skills faster if you<br/>
fight somthing white than if you fight something blue or green.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t priced Scalers, but my smith with an 80 charisma (dealing with<br/>
merchants who like him) has a total cost of 2.35 gold per skewer.  That<br/>
includes the mold, the water, and all the costs that went into the metal<br/>
bits.  Hope this helps some.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; And!  Does anyone know if intellect directly affects smithing skill gain<br/>
&gt; like it should affect most other skills.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is my understanding that Intel directly affects smithing skill gain<br/>
llike others, but I didn&#39;t hear that from a GM or anything, so I could<br/>
be wrong.</div>
