<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151734230">Getting twinked is part of the game. I think if someone has another character <br/>
that has the skill to make cool stuff, or the level to hunt and get awsome <br/>
stuff, they should be allowed to do what they want with it. So getting <br/>
twinked is part of the game, and it happens. Heck, the other day, one of the <br/>
few Level 50 characters, made a new character, had him going with level 49 <br/>
armor, and really high level weapons and stuff. Looked awsome, he made level <br/>
8 in an hour. Guess it is just part of the game.<br/>
