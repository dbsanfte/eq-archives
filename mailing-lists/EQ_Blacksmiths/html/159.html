<br/>
Well, lets see, cost of a banded tunic....<br/>
Small Bricks of Ore - Free, or can buy from players for usually 3 or 4 gp<br/>
3 waters - 4sp<br/>
tunic mold - 1pp? (sorry don&#39;t remember real price, never paid real close attention when buying molds)<br/>
So we&#39;re talking less than a few plat to make a tunic....at cost would be below 10pp, below cost would be below 5pp....yep, I would have to agree there, that would be pretty stupid, but I&#39;ve yet to see anybody selling stuff that cheap.<br/>
<br/>
So selling a tunic for 20pp is a BIG profit, for me that&#39;d be about 15pp profit.  Selling for 15pp is still a nice profit of about 10pp.  Taking any more profit than that is pure greed.  So I&#39;ll continue to sell my tunic and leggings for 15plat ea.<br/>
So do you concider cost of materials for your failures?  if so, You charge people for your lack of skill?<br/>

Prices on banded should be at least as much as chain.  Smiths who sell lower<br/>
than that are doing a terrible disservice to their fellow smiths.  All<br/>
Verant needs to do to fix this problem is make merchants pay a reasonable<br/>
amount for smithed goods, then we wouldn&#39;t see stupid things like people<br/>
selling at or below cost.<br/>
