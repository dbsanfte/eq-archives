<div id="ygrps-yiv-554225389">I just double checked and she does sell scalers.  They are the very last<br/>
mold on the left of her list.  I<br/>
&#39;m  on Cazic-Thule but I would assume that they are all the same.  As far as<br/>
spending hundreds of Platinum.  Yes, expect to spend hundreds before you<br/>
make any banded regularly.  I&#39;d spend at least 200PP before I could make it<br/>
regularly.  I only have an INT of 75 so that slowed me down, but I have a<br/>
very high success rate so it counterbalances.  At 50 I was making skewers 30<br/>
or 40% of the time.  Don&#39;t worry.  After you are good at banded that first<br/>
couple of hundred you put into it won&#39;t seem like any big deal.  That just a<br/>
few hours good work now.<br/>
