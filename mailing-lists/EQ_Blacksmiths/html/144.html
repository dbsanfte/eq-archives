<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361813478">A couple of things about price &#39;fixing&#39; and those doing or trying to do it:<br/>
<br/>
First of all, what they are doing is just like any union does... Let&#39;s make<br/>
everyone the same, so that everyone can make the same money... They might as<br/>
well be NPC&#39;s for Tunare&#39;s sake!<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER, your (higher level players) type is one of the reasons they may be<br/>
doing it... Yes, you can easily afford to buy banded, or chain, or even<br/>
plate mail armor... As you said, you really have no need for plat except for<br/>
learning things like smithing... so, no skin off your nose... You are higher<br/>
than level 20 and easily make more money off of better mobs...<br/>
<br/>
BUT, you have to realize that some of these smiths are MUCH lower than<br/>
you... they poured their time and efforts into smithing in the beginning<br/>
instead of gaining experience like others did...<br/>
<br/>
There are some I have seen that are only level 7-10 characters that are<br/>
master smiths!!  Now I myself didn&#39;t know you could do that!  But for these<br/>
players the only way they can make 10-20 plat a day, like you do, is to make<br/>
a good profit on the armor they make... And, they know just like the oil<br/>
companies in RL that if they stick together they can control the market...<br/>
I have even heard that when they &#39;blackball&#39; another smith that when he<br/>
tries to sell armor, the immediately post prices MUCH LOWER (sometimes<br/>
taking a loss) just so you won&#39;t be able to even sell yours!<br/>
<br/>
Now, I hope that the prices don&#39;t keep coming down and down and down<br/>
either... because it is costing me a FORTUNE to learn smithing (I am up to<br/>
level 54 now... woo hoo!) and I WILL be trying to factor that into my costs<br/>
when I make a piece... I figure if it costs me 100pp to get good enough,<br/>
then I need to make a &#39;profit&#39; of 1-5 plat on each piece of banded in order<br/>
to break even within the time it takes to make 30-50 different pieces of<br/>
armor... OR, I can charge MORE and do it even faster... Hey, after all,<br/>
Enchanters do it, so do tailors... Where does it say we should &#39;give it<br/>
away&#39; to people... people appreciate what they work for and earn... not<br/>
what&#39;s just given to them...  So yes, be cheaper in price if you feel you<br/>
must to sell your wares, but don&#39;t give it away at cost... because some of<br/>
us don&#39;t have 100pp sitting in the bank...<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t understand the price fixing.  Is this the Microsoft Smithing<br/>
Alliance?  No, didn&#39;t think so.  And I&#39;m not letting some self reichous<br/>
group deturmine how much or how little profit I should make per piece of<br/>
armor.  And I&#39;ve been told by various other smiths that if I don&#39;t raise my<br/>
prices to match theirs they are going to put me on some blacksmith black<br/>
list.  Which is really kinda pathetic, people are threatening to blackball<br/>
me because I offer the same product (actually better since I make small and<br/>
its lighter) at a lower price than they are willing to sell for.  Not to<br/>
mention once you hit about 25th lvl, the money really isn&#39;t important, very<br/>
few people actually sell items these days so I havn&#39;t needed money for<br/>
anything in a long time, other than to dump into my smithing hobby.<br/>
