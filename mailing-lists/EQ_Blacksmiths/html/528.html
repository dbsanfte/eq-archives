<b>Subject:</b> Smithing changes with latest patch <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-574063884">I&#39;ve heard weapon smithing is now implemented! Unfortunately they&#39;re not quite as good as FS, so hopefully they&#39;ll be either enchantable or a stepping-stone to a high enough skill level to make plate.<br/>
<br/>
Another item, not exactly a change but of interest to those smiths who are paladins like myself: the new Temple zone supposedly has a Paladin who will give you or give you quests for molds to make special armor. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t get on to see what other changes may have taken place to smithing, but check your vendors, check your books, and post back to the list what you find.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
