<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315450531">Anyone else here think that they should make joint bank accounts? Have a <br/>
limit on the number of people that can go into it. This would be great for <br/>
people into trade skills. 2 friends smithing together, put all profit into <br/>
the account. Have it completely seperate from the original ones. And have all <br/>
players consent to it, so that Verant can&#39;t do anything about stolen money. <br/>
Just say sorry. I think this would be very cool. What other people think?<br/>
