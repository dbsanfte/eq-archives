 </span></blockquote>I find this highly amusing.  People like you who<br/>
insist on flooding the market with cheap banded are<br/>
doing a few things.<br/>
<br/>
1) you&#39;re driving smiths away; it&#39;s not worth their<br/>
time anymore.  But I know, you think this is good<br/>
because you get more business.<br/>
<br/>
2) you &#39;teach&#39; the buyers they don&#39;t have to pay more<br/>
than rock-bottom prices.  But again, you think this is<br/>
good because you get more business, because you&#39;re<br/>
happy making a few gold over cost.<br/>
<br/>
3) you flood the market, so everyone has banded, so<br/>
very soon, the server has all the banded it needs.<br/>
<br/>
This is the one I laugh about, because you&#39;re too<br/>
shortsighted to understand it.  When everyone has<br/>
banded, you log on and auction you&#39;re selling it, and<br/>
everyone shrugs because they already have what they<br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun in the pit you&#39;ve dug for yourself.  Or are<br/>
you going to flame me like you flamed him too?<br/>
