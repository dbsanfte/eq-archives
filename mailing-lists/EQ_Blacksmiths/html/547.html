<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077334821">I think the problem with pricing and manufacturing costs on the new<br/>
weapons is due to the disparity between what Verant thinks the weapons<br/>
are worth and what the players will actually pay for them.   The store<br/>
prices on most fine steel weapons is from 30-40 pp in the shops, but you<br/>
can buy them by the tons on Karana for 4-8 pp each from players.  That<br/>
won&#39;t cover the costs of our molds, much less taking failures into<br/>
account.<br/>
<br/>
Most people I know want magic weapons by the time they are 15th level so<br/>
they can hunt critters you need magic weapons for.  Prior to 15th level<br/>
it doesn&#39;t really matter much what you use for a weapon.  I think the<br/>
weapons are a nice idea, but Verant needs to rethink the component costs<br/>
and get them in line with reality.<br/>
