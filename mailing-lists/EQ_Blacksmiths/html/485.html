<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744874477">First, yes.  The weapon sketches were (SADLY) a hoax.  The person who did it<br/>
confessed, as well as the images that were taken were doctored.  Ahh well,<br/>
we can hope.<br/>
<br/>
But also, on the sewing kit.  If your at the forge in Kelethin, go down the<br/>
ramp you used to get up to it, and the NPC right in front of you is the one<br/>
that has the sewing kit things.  The thimble mold and the needle mold.  Be<br/>
aware that of course the sewing kit is also a &quot;backpack&quot;, so be prepared for<br/>
it.<br/>
