OOC - I have a question for all you seasoned smiths.  I have been searching all<br/>
over to find the recipe to make small bricks.  The books do not say and some of<br/>
the webpages I have seen say to combine (2) metal bits (seperated) with (1)<br/>
Flask of Water (not summoned)  when I do this all three items are destroyed.  Do<br/>
I have something wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Did something change with a new patch or did this cobination never work?  Sorry<br/>
if you have answered this already but around Oggok we hardly ever see a really<br/>
trained smith so I have no one in game to ask for guidance.  Thank you in<br/>
advance.<br/>
