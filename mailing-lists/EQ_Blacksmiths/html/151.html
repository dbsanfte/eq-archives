&gt;You&#39;ll know things are trivial when you try to do it. You will get a message<br/>
&gt;something to the effect of &quot;this has become trivial...&quot;. I don&#39;t remember<br/>
&gt;the exact words. There is also another book for smithing, dealing with<br/>
&gt;Smithing Weapons and Armor. This is the one that explains how to make Banded<br/>
&gt;armor. Note that currently, despite the book&#39;s name, you cannot make<br/>
&gt;weapons. I&#39;ve found the book in East Freeport. I&#39;m not sure of all the<br/>
&gt;locations. </span></blockquote></div>
