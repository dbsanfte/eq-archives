<b>Subject:</b> Bottles for Lanterns <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592691071">You can get bottles in Freeport in the same<br/>
building you get the Molds but from another<br/>
NPC.  Most NPCs that sell bottles also sell<br/>
booze.  The bottles have the same icon as<br/>
red wine and are usually at the bottom of<br/>
their list of wares they normally sell.<br/>
<br/>
The lanterns themselves are exactly the same<br/>
as the large lanterns you can buy from NPCs.<br/>
