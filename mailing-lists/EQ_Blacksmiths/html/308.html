<div id="ygrps-yiv-378342361">I agree with the pricing problems of banded... I too have had to watch some<br/>
smiths selling banded armor at what is basically the cost of materials!<br/>
(not the actual cost which would take into account the time and cost to<br/>
learn smithing)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;From time to time I too have sold some cheap, but it is usually when I have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>made way too many of something and had it on me way too long... So, I need<br/>
to get rid of some of the &#39;old&#39; stock...<br/>
<br/>
But I think the real problem with the pricing comes not from overstock, but<br/>
mostly from impatience.  People think that they should be able to /Auction<br/>
1-2 times and that if nobody answers them, they want to go to the next zone<br/>
(&quot;where there are more people&quot;) to try to sell there... Then, when nobody<br/>
wants to buy right away, they start discounting it to the cost!<br/>
<br/>
People, you have to understand something about selling... IT TAKES TIME!!!<br/>
Just like the smithing itself does...<br/>
<br/>
If you have ever been in a fine clothier or jewelery store, you might have<br/>
noticed that there isn&#39;t a whole lot of customers &#39;shopping&#39; around<br/>
inside... They are there selling a quality product for a good profit... that<br/>
is the way they make their money and keep their reputation of a fine<br/>
product...<br/>
<br/>
Much different then Sears or some warehouse store that is basing sales on<br/>
HUGE Volumes because they (vendors) get huge discounts on the items<br/>
(Materials cost)...<br/>
<br/>
Well, remember folks, this isn&#39;t Kmart!!  Don&#39;t try to sell at Kmart<br/>
prices!!<br/>
<br/>
I often hang out at the banks or gates of a city selling my wares... and<br/>
there have been times when I sat there for 5 min or more without selling a<br/>
thing, or even getting a query as to the prices and such!  This can seem<br/>
veeeery frustrating... but look at it in a different light:<br/>
<br/>
Last night I spent about an hour selling banded armor... and guess what?  I<br/>
made about 30 plat in profit (over costs of the materials, not actual<br/>
costs - I am about even now... hehe...)  How long would it take you to earn<br/>
30 plat in, say, Unrest?  or NRo?  Probably at least twice as long, and only<br/>
if you got some good loot off some mob!  If you can just relax and sit back<br/>
and sell armor for a couple of hours, you can make about 30-50 plat per day<br/>
just off of that... Then you won&#39;t mind going to those places where you earn<br/>
lots of experience, but get no good loot... Because it will allready be in<br/>
the bank!<br/>
<br/>
So, remember... Keep those prices up there for a GOOD profit... and RELAX!!!<br/>
Take the time needed to sell...  Just because there are only 14 people in<br/>
NFP and nobody buys from you in the first 5 minutes doesn&#39;t mean that 5<br/>
minutes later the SAME 14 people will be in that zone!  They change all the<br/>
time.... just look at the names... Oh, and if you see some that are there<br/>
for a long time, they are probably selling too!<br/>

&gt; I think this was directed at my comment about doing scalers, lanterns, and<br/>
&gt; skewers till trivial, and by then you&#39;ll be popping out the banded.  The<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as selling banded...I have all but stopped playing my enchanter<br/>
&gt; because I got burned out on all the requests for armor.  I logged him in<br/>
&gt; last night and within 5 minutes was hit with 4 requests from return<br/>
&gt; customers.  This was after taking 10 days off from the game.  I politely<br/>
&gt; refused all 4 requests and promptly rolled up a new enchanter so I could<br/>
&gt; actually do something besides standing behind a hot forge making armor.<br/>

&gt; No, I hardly think the banded market is dead.  It&#39;s been damaged a bit by<br/>
&gt; low priced swindlers running through town selling gorgets for 3pp each and<br/>

&gt; &gt;scalers are trivial at 41, no way you be popping out the banded at that<br/>
&gt; &gt;level. Oh ya, no one wants banded anymore, so it is really pointless to<br/>
