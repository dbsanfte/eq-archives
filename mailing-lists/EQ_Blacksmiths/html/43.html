<div id="ygrps-yiv-713321680">I believe you should not send your personal wab page updates to this forum<br/>
as it does apply to blacksmithing.  If you wish you can send us an update<br/>
for when you change you blacksmithing guide.  Other than that I think that I<br/>
can say that WE don&#39;t really have an interest in what happens to the rest of<br/>
your web site.<br/>
<br/>
There are other forums you could subscribe and send your web page updates<br/>
to. This is a blacksmithing one so this is not the place for you.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>

You didn&#39;t need to quote the whole thing, and the only way not to receive<br/>
those updates is to not subscribe to this mailing list altogether.  It&#39;d be<br/>
the same if you mailed this list an update of your EQ page (imagine that<br/>
you have one), everyone gets it, whether or not their interested.</div>
