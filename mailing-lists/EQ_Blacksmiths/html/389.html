<div id="ygrps-yiv-164599145">Well, as a smith, you expect people to pay you for your time and skill, correct?<br/>
<br/>
That being the case, why should you not pay an enchanter for his time and services?<br/>
<br/>
Why should a master fisherman be able to make armor?  Why should a master talor be able to cook a complicated pie?  They shouldn&#39;t.  Certainly enchanters have an advantage when it comes to making magic items, but then again, shouldn&#39;t an enchanter have an advantage since their whole class is based upon enchantments?  And if you people are afraid that the day will come that you can&#39;t make magic armor because some enchanter is doing it, you are wrong.  You will still be able to, you might have to pay an enchanter to enchant some items for you, but you will still be able to make it.  And if you strongly feel that they will alow smiths to make magic armor, perhaps you should do a little adventuring and find some enchanters to become buddies with, perhaps he will do it for a nominal fee, or perhaps even free.<br/>

I am not trying to take anything away from enchanters, but why should all<br/>
magical items be dependent on one single class?  The same discussion is<br/>
going on in one of the tailoring lists.  If all magical items that can be<br/>
made through all skills need an enchanter to do the enchanting, enchanters<br/>
will be overworked.  Maybe enchanters need to be used in creating certain<br/>
magical items for smiths, but by no means all.<br/>

&gt; Yeah forget what the book said and all that stuff.<br/>
&gt;  reread your FaQ and the &quot;official&quot; guide to EQ, magical weapons are<br/>
&gt; supposed to require the help of a high level enchanter and a master<br/>
&gt; smith, the one things we shouldn&#39;t need is to deal with a slimy little<br/>
&gt; dwarven smith or some such ;)<br/>
&gt;  as for &quot;would become the best class to make magical items.&quot; well I<br/>
&gt; should hope so, its what our class does! what next? Take away damage<br/>
&gt; bonuses for str to fighters cause it might make them the best melee<br/>
&gt; class in the game? or pickpockets from rogues cause it might make them<br/>
&gt; the best rogues in the game? heh, don&#39;t mess with us enchanters or<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll regret it<br/>
