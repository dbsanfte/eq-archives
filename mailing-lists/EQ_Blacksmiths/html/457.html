<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486432940">Just want to say, when we are finally able to make plate (this isn&#39;t in the near<br/>
future, mind you. Tailoring is probably next to be worked on after make poison,<br/>
and then probably tinkering or alchemy from what I&#39;ve read all around), we<br/>
should only sell for 5 to 10 plat less than the magical plates are sold for. We<br/>
can&#39;t sell for NPC plate prices (people would just buy magical plate) but I<br/>
really don&#39;t want to shoot myself in the foot and have the same thing happen<br/>
with plate as it did to banded. Please, no flames, I know some of you will only<br/>
want 10 plat profit per piece, that&#39;s your right, and this is mine. This is what<br/>
I will be doing and I would hope if you&#39;re concerned over smithing, please do<br/>
the same. Plate will NOT be cheaper to make oneself (not only the 150 plat it<br/>
takes to get to banded, but all the time selling banded to get to making plate),<br/>
so we don&#39;t have to worry about that happening. Just gotta be competetive with<br/>
magical plates. Again, please no flames, I&#39;m terribly sick of them, and I will<br/>
not respond. Please, if you&#39;re on my side, don&#39;t respond to any flames either.<br/>
Let the baby have his/her bottle.<br/>
