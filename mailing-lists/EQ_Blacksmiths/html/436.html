<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903716716">Well, you can take up another skill.  But nothing will be worth it very very<br/>
soon.<br/>
<br/>
Brewing has been screwed over.  What&#39;s the point of it now?  Consider it a<br/>
&quot;warrior&quot; trade skill and be done with it, as the bonuses / negatives that<br/>
being drug give you are worth it only to them.<br/>
<br/>
Jewelry?  Consider it an &quot;enchanter&quot; trade skill, and also be done with it.<br/>
What&#39;s the point for anyone else to do it, besides just to say &quot;Hey look!  I<br/>
can make pretty jewelry!  Oh...well, you see, it doesn&#39;t DO anything....but<br/>
doesn&#39;t it look good?&quot;  Leave this for the enchanters.<br/>
<br/>
Fletching.  Currently worthless as well.  You can&#39;t make any arrows any<br/>
better than you can buy at the store (not by much, anyway).  And the<br/>
turnaround just isn&#39;t worth it either.  Leave it for those who use bows.<br/>
<br/>
Baking.  Useful, being able to make your own food or whatnot.  And I hear<br/>
that fishrolls are as profitable, if not slightly moreso (in that you can<br/>
make them with your own portable spit, and not wait in line) than pottery.<br/>
However, I wouldn&#39;t spend my time on this skill.  I just summon my food and<br/>
drink anyways.<br/>
<br/>
Pottery.  Soon to be screwed, similar to brewing.  Gnomes need pie tins I<br/>
hear, but why can&#39;t they just learn the skill and make one?  Sure, ceramic<br/>
linings are needed, and a few others for baking.  But how many bakers out<br/>
there are rushing up to potters and buying up their wares?  I doubt very<br/>
many.  I know for a fact I have never used my own pottery skills to make a<br/>
ceramic lining to use in blacksmithing.  Go fig.<br/>
<br/>
Tailoring.  This skill requires to much running about and such.  I must kill<br/>
&quot;x&quot; creature to get &quot;y&quot; skin, then buy &quot;j&quot; mold to make &quot;z&quot; product.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think so.  While useful (seeing as how there are few who make studded<br/>
leather or reinforced leather, it is useful), but not worth my time for me.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m leaving anything out, sorry.  I&#39;ll nitpick some other time.  My point<br/>
in all this is as follows.  If I wish to spend my time making pie tins with<br/>
pottery to sell for a little bit of a profit, why shouldn&#39;t I be able to?  I<br/>
spent the time to learn the skill.  I&#39;m sacrificing my time that I could be<br/>
gaining experience to make a little bit of cash.  That seems like an even<br/>
trade to me.<br/>
<br/>
And in the end, if it comes down to it, we should AT LEAST be able to sell<br/>
what we make to merchants for the COST of the parts to make the item.  No<br/>
profit.  No loss (unless you have a failure).<br/>
<br/>
Well, done ranting.<br/>
