<b>Subject:</b> Why do they want Bronze? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232572239">I just cannot fathom those that are purchasing BRONZE armor instead of<br/>
banded armor.  With banded being sooo much lighter in weight, and (nowadays)<br/>
a heck of a lot cheaper, it seems silly to me they want to pay so much more<br/>
for the bronze when most pieces only give 1AC better!<br/>
<br/>
Am I missing something?  Does this bronze armor have some &#39;special&#39; powers I<br/>
don&#39;t know about yet?<br/>
<br/>
Some have said they like it because it &#39;Looks Kewl!&#39; for them... I think it<br/>
looks like crap myself... all dull and flat looking... Looks more rusty than<br/>
a rusty sword!  I like the nice clean look banded gives (especially on Human<br/>
Females! Yum, Yum!) when worn.<br/>

&gt; scalers are trivial at 41, no way you be popping out the banded at that<br/>
&gt; level. Oh ya, no one wants banded anymore, so it is really pointless to<br/>
try<br/>
&gt; and sell anything. In what I have seen on my server, most people want<br/>
bronze<br/>
&gt; armor. You can still sell, but a lot more diffucult to do so.<br/>
