<div id="ygrps-yiv-117271143">If only player made items became worn and in need of repair that might help.  But at the same time, that would make a stronger market for bronze armor since you wouldn&#39;t have to worry about maintenance on it.<br/>

Only items that a smith can make should be repairable hence become worn.<br/>
Since magic armor is rare and hard to get why should that item have to be<br/>
repaired, or become worn?<br/>

&gt; OK, simple question, how many of you people that are for items<br/>
deteriorating and going poof have any magic plate?  (none I&#39;d bet)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve spent about 2 months to get the armor that I am now wearing, I&#39;d be<br/>
pissed to an extreem if I were in the middle of a fight and I see a message<br/>
&quot;Your Charred Black Tunic has fallen appart&quot;.  That one piece of armor alone<br/>
took me the better part of week to get.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, so you say I should have to get it repaired by a smith.  I am DE, and<br/>
by choice I have lowered my faction to the point where I will never be able<br/>
to go into Freeport or Rivervale, and due to built in factions, I can not go<br/>
to any other elf city nor can I go into gnome, dwarf, or barbarian city.<br/>
Which means that I would have to search, not only for a respectable smith<br/>
that I trusted, but also an evil one, or trek my self across the world to<br/>
Qeynos.  Simply to get my armor &quot;repaired&quot;.  Now if that isn&#39;t bad<br/>
enough.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Often my group will go deep into a dungeon, deep to the point where either<br/>
a caster has to group gate us to get us out, or we have to spend 30-45 min<br/>
fighting out way out of the dungeon.  And quite often we&#39;ll all camp and<br/>
logout in a &quot;safe&quot; spot in the dungeon, so sometimes we will be in a dungeon<br/>
litterly for days.  Now, say I get the message &quot;your rubicite helm is<br/>
begining to weaken, you should take it for repairs soon&quot;, that means that my<br/>
entire group would have to leave the dungeon so that I might quest to get my<br/>
armor repaired.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I find neither to be acceptable.  What I do find about this, is that there<br/>
are some smiths who think they don&#39;t make enough money, so they want armor<br/>
to wear out, so it has to either be replaced or repaired (more money for<br/>
smiths).  What they fail to concider is the fact that you will not always be<br/>
wearing banded armor.<br/>
