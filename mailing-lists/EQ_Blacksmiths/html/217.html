<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717036549">And, in a role playing game, people usually have somewhere to store things.<br/>
A house, a secret place no one knows about, etc. The Bank is a way of<br/>
implementing this, although the one thing it provides that other<br/>
role-playing type games (or life way back when....) is security. Personally,<br/>
I don&#39;t keep that much in my bank account. Copies of extra keys to Befallen,<br/>
a couple of semi-rare items in process of selling or waiting for a guildmate<br/>
to come get (like a derv ring, a couple of spiked collars, and a mino axe),<br/>
and coinage. That&#39;s basically about it. I don&#39;t keep extra weapons or armor<br/>
or food and drink for when I buy the farm. That&#39;s what friends are for -<br/>
help me do a corpse retrieve (assuming I need help). And, if I need a weapon<br/>
after I die, I&#39;ll kill a couple skeletons in the newbie areas and get some<br/>
weapons before I head back out, which I usually don&#39;t even worry about.<br/>

In a role-playing sense, I think banks are already borderline, much less<br/>
joint accounts.  What&#39;s next, a stock market?  heheheh...little joke, there.<br/>
<br/>
They do make sense in the game, however.  If I didn&#39;t have my vault, I&#39;d be<br/>
overloaded by a factor of about 5...and I&#39;d be far more cautious with all my<br/>
money on me, and without my &quot;emergency kit&quot; (clothes, staff, food and drink)<br/>
in the vault for when I buy the farm.<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, dealing in face-to-face trades and keeping everything on a<br/>
barter and trade level for the game makes sense to me.  Just my humble<br/>
opinion.<br/>
