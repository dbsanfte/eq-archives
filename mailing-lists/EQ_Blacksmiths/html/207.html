<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832662483">Well I have to disagree with the other replies ). Start with Scalers. Don&#39;t<br/>
stop scalers til the become trivial, whatever skill that is. Next are<br/>
Lanterns. I tried skewers and was wasting ALOT of money. Lanterns boosted my<br/>
points a good bit. When Lanterns become trivial, then switch to skewers. One<br/>
last personal recommendation, take skewers all the way to 115, where they<br/>
become trivial. At this skill level you can start making banded armor with<br/>
good proficiency. You still fail on items at times. Keep this in mind. The<br/>
cheapest banded item you can make, gorgets and bracers, each cost you over 1<br/>
plat. Skewers only cost a little over 1 gold. Practicing on skewers is alot<br/>
cheaper on your purse than practicing on Banded.<br/>

<br/>
  i have a 22 skill in blacksmithing with my level 17 dwarf warrior.  i<br/>
started making skewers but i only made 1 in about 21 failing the rest and<br/>
only gaining one skill point.  should i be making something different to<br/>
build my skill at this point?</div>
