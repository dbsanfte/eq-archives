<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024935394"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1) you&#39;re driving smiths away; it&#39;s not worth their<br/>
&gt; time anymore.  But I know, you think this is good<br/>
&gt; because you get more business.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) you &#39;teach&#39; the buyers they don&#39;t have to pay more<br/>
&gt; than rock-bottom prices.  But again, you think this is<br/>
&gt; good because you get more business, because you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; happy making a few gold over cost.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Take a look at this, thne think about it for a bit.  Seems sort of like the<br/>
real world doesn&#39;t it?  I don&#39;t know about you, but where I come from there<br/>
are always people willing to make a bit less of a profit, and just do more<br/>
sales.  Puts me a bit in mind of Kmart, Wallmart, Circit City, etc. etc.<br/>
etc.  And not only these giants have been able to make a living by selling<br/>
low, there are plenty of mom and pop stores that do the same, usualy with<br/>
these smaller shops you get a bit less for your money, usualy in less of a<br/>
customer service ability, little or no warranty, etc.  Luckily in EQ<br/>
customer serveice isn&#39;t a problem... at least INSIDE the game, since things<br/>
don&#39;t break down.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3) you flood the market, so everyone has banded, so<br/>
&gt; very soon, the server has all the banded it needs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is the one I laugh about, because you&#39;re too<br/>
&gt; shortsighted to understand it.  When everyone has<br/>
&gt; banded, you log on and auction you&#39;re selling it, and<br/>
&gt; everyone shrugs because they already have what they<br/>
&gt; want.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh I just love this, especially after I spent the last three days trying to<br/>
find Large Banded for my new character, and ended up paying every cent I had<br/>
on two pieces of Bronze because NO ONE, answered my auctions about looking<br/>
to buy banded.  You know why it&#39;s such a pain to get banded nowadays?<br/>
Because of the people you are speaking of, the ones that make banded<br/>
unprofitable for many smiths.  Looks to me like they are doing a great job<br/>
of cornering the market.<br/>
