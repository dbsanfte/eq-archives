<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428434173">October 13th, 7:00am<br/>
--------------------<br/>
We are excited to announce the implementation of the new &quot;Optional&quot; patch<br/>
system. This new system will allow players to download new optional files<br/>
such as zones, music, character animations, etc. After the EverQuest<br/>
executable is run (everquest.exe), and once the download is complete, you<br/>
will receive an option to patch the &quot;optional&quot; files. If &quot;Yes&quot; is selected,<br/>
the optional files will begin downloading, if &quot;No&quot; is selected, you will<br/>
bypass the optional files and continue. Please note that this optional patch<br/>
requestor will appear every time everquest.exe is run. <br/>
<br/>
In addition to the optional patch program, the following changes and<br/>
enhancements have been made: <br/>
<br/>
*Optional Patch* <br/>
<br/>
A new zone, The Temple of Solusek Ro, is now available via the optional<br/>
patch. <br/>
<br/>
*General Enhancements* <br/>
<br/>
- Experience and looting rights are now awarded for group aggregate damage.<br/>
This is now true for ALL servers. We still consider this change in &#39;TEST&#39;<br/>
and will conduct a poll as to whether it positively addresses the kill<br/>
stealing situation in approximately 2 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
- As mentioned on Saturday, Rubicite armor will no longer spawn. The new<br/>
class specific quests to obtain the new armor are now in for each class that<br/>
could wear Rubicite.<br/>
<br/>
- Journeyman&#39;s Boots will no longer spawn where they did but rather are the<br/>
products of a quest.<br/>
<br/>
- To address trade fraud (players removing items/money immediately prior to<br/>
trading to deceive the other player), items/money may only be removed by<br/>
clicking on the &quot;Cancel&quot; button. - When receiving a text message from either<br/>
an NPC or PC speaking in a language other than &quot;Common Tongue&quot;, if the<br/>
user&#39;s language skill is high enough, the language being spoken will be<br/>
noted preceding the text.<br/>
<br/>
- The fishing pole will now appear in the player&#39;s hand whenever the fishing<br/>
skill is used.<br/>
<br/>
- A number of quests were both added and enhanced throughout the zones. <br/>
<br/>
*Trade Skills* <br/>
<br/>
A number of new items have been added to Blacksmithing. <br/>
<br/>
*Spell Enhancements* <br/>
<br/>
- Some of the Items that Magicians Summon with their spells have been made<br/>
better / had their effects increased.<br/>
<br/>
- Fufil&#39;s Curtailing Chant, Tuyen&#39;s Chant of Flame and Tuyen&#39;s Chant of<br/>
Frost (BARD) have all had their effects slightly increased.<br/>
<br/>
- The Burnout Series (Magicians) has had the negative HP component reduced<br/>
(improvement) and the stat buff increased (improvement). Because of this,<br/>
the spells are no longer permanent - they now have a 15 minute duration.<br/>
Burnout III has also had its casting cost reduced.<br/>
<br/>
- Illusion: Werewolf attack speed component now works as intended.<br/>
<br/>
- Insipid Weakness (Enchanter) will research as intended. <br/>
<br/>
- The EverQuest Team <br/>
<br/>
