<div id="ygrps-yiv-188348022">I am taking part in that debate, so why not bring up the same points here?<br/>
<br/>
Enchanters should get the best means of producing magical equipment, it is<br/>
what they do. No agruement.<br/>
<br/>
However not all special weapons and armor need be magical in nature. If<br/>
tinkering is ever completely (reletive term) and properly implemented then<br/>
they should be able to produce tools and/or components to produce unusual<br/>
smithed equipment. (Please note that if an enchanter were to aid the<br/>
tinkerer the produced tinkered tools/components could be enven more powerful<br/>
and useful)<br/>
<br/>
The addition of enchanted jewel components in smithed items might yield<br/>
special effects.<br/>
<br/>
I forgot to mention this to the tailors, but I&#39;ll tell my fellow smiths.<br/>
Alchemy (another currently iffy skill) could produce potions (to be used in<br/>
place of water) that could also effect smithed items.<br/>
<br/>
The trades were not ment to be independent, and if they were they would be,<br/>
IMHO, far less enjoyable. Sure, trying to track down someone who is skilled<br/>
enough in a certain trade to help you can be a pain, but it is a great<br/>
feeling when you finally do.<br/>
<br/>
Now, for something a bit off topic. I&#39;ve also been thinking it would be<br/>
great if smith could produce (perhaps with the help of some group or other)<br/>
metal thread. This could then be turned into bolts of cloth by tailors, and<br/>
used in different fashions by either smiths or tailors. I don&#39;t ever expect<br/>
to see it in game (to complicated to code), but it would be nice.<br/>

&gt;I am not trying to take anything away from enchanters, but why should all<br/>
&gt;magical items be dependent on one single class?  The same discussion is<br/>
&gt;going on in one of the tailoring lists.  If all magical items that can be<br/>
&gt;made through all skills need an enchanter to do the enchanting, enchanters<br/>
&gt;will be overworked.  Maybe enchanters need to be used in creating certain<br/>
&gt;magical items for smiths, but by no means all.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Yeah forget what the book said and all that stuff.<br/>
&gt;&gt;  reread your FaQ and the &quot;official&quot; guide to EQ, magical weapons are<br/>
&gt;&gt; supposed to require the help of a high level enchanter and a master<br/>
&gt;&gt; smith, the one things we shouldn&#39;t need is to deal with a slimy little<br/>
&gt;&gt; dwarven smith or some such ;)<br/>
&gt;&gt;  as for &quot;would become the best class to make magical items.&quot; well I<br/>
&gt;&gt; should hope so, its what our class does! what next? Take away damage<br/>
&gt;&gt; bonuses for str to fighters cause it might make them the best melee<br/>
&gt;&gt; class in the game? or pickpockets from rogues cause it might make them<br/>
&gt;&gt; the best rogues in the game? heh, don&#39;t mess with us enchanters or<br/>
&gt;&gt; you&#39;ll regret it<br/>
&gt;&gt;  sincerily<br/>
