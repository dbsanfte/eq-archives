<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042263607">Well, seems Verant finally put the banded gauntlet molds in the game.. Sort <br/>
of. They &quot;forgot&quot; to when they did that big patch earlier in the month, and <br/>
&quot;remembered&quot; it later. The molds may be found in Kelethin and Steamfront <br/>
along with the normal banded molds, but for some reason Freeport&#39;s medium <br/>
mold vendor (East Freeport, near the docks) doesn&#39;t have them, at least not <br/>
that I saw. They MAY be located with the weapon molds, I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, so far they seem to be as hard as cloaks. With a 143 skill, I had a <br/>
25% failure rate. The gauntlets do NOT show up on the player model, so if <br/>
your customer wants them for looks then he&#39;s SOL.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been selling them on E&#39;ci at a good clip at 12pp, in line with the <br/>
Smiths of Norrath union rates. A few complaints (&quot;*whine* ..but banded is <br/>
only 1pp per AC! /whine&quot;) but once they find out it&#39;s as hard to make as <br/>
cloaks they&#39;re sympathetic.<br/>
<br/>
Stats are 7AC, weight 3(sm) and 4(med), don&#39;t know about large.<br/>
