<b>Subject:</b> Ore For Free? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-204444669">I just read a message on eqvault general board that you can find ore for<br/>
free.  Can anyone confirm this and wish to divulge this information to the<br/>
rest of us in this forum?<br/>
<br/>
And the exact recipe for studs is:<br/>
<br/>
Studs = 3 Metal Bits + File + Flask<br/>
File = Metal Bits + File Mold + Flask<br/>
Metal Bits = 2 Pieces of Ore + Flask <br/>
8 Pieces of Ore = 440<br/>
6 Flasks of Water = 66<br/>
1 File Mold = 12 <br/>
1 Stud = 518 <br/>
And this is at perfect 100% completion.<br/>
There are 3 seperate steps to make Studs: <br/>
1) Make the Bits<br/>
2) Make the File<br/>
3) Make the Studs <br/>
So you need to have a good skill level to make them. <br/>
Base Cost = 518<br/>
Sale Price = 800 to 1000<br/>
That was cut from a message on the same thread as the one that stated there<br/>
is free ore to be found.<br/>
<br/>
Keep the information flowing...<br/>
