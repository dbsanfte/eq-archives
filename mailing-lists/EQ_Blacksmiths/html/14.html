<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259067231">Best way to increase skill at first is to first off, use as many<br/>
practice pts from your guild allowable ( usually around 20). then i<br/>
would start finding a real damn good source of income as this next plan<br/>
drains you. you make skewers.<br/>
first, ( after you have about 30 plat with you : ) make 40 metal bits<br/>
worth of ore. buy about 40 waters too ( summoned water will NOT work)<br/>
now, go find the vendor that sells molds of &quot;skewers&quot;. Also, you might<br/>
want to get about 4 large backpacks in your inventory. buy as many<br/>
skewer molds as possilbe. now, just spend all you&#39;ve got trying to make<br/>
skewers. they are very difficult to make so until your tivial, you might<br/>
find them damn near impossible to make. ** you gain skill failing too**<br/>
ingrediants for skewers:<br/>
1 water flask<br/>
1 skewer mold<br/>
1 metal bit ( its been awhile...i&#39;m pretty sure its only 1)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 you may find this a bit expensive but let me give you an idea what a<br/>
master smith is capable of making: Once you can make banded armor, (the<br/>
tunic) go around offereing to trade banded for someones chain tunic. (<br/>
also, NPC&#39;s dont like player made crap so dont bother with them.) if you<br/>
can trade a banded tunic for a chain tunic...you just made yourself at<br/>
least 60 plat! ( banded is lighter, and with the same AC as chain)<br/>
