 </span></blockquote>There needs to be a distinction drawn between hobbies and businesses here.<br/>
I do not know of many businesses where hobbieists who are willing to sell<br/>
for a loss because they do it for fun has any kind of significant impact on<br/>
businesses who do something to make money.  The markets are too large here.<br/>
In EQ, where your market is in the hundreds to thousands, it is quite<br/>
possible for a hobbieist to completely ruin other&#39;s chances to make a buck<br/>
at the trades.  How many mom and pop Auto manufacturers are there out there?<br/>
There are a few.  Vector, Panoz, some others.  I&#39;m guessing that the few<br/>
dozen to a hundred cars they sell a year aren&#39;t putting any kind of dent in<br/>
GM&#39;s bottom line.  The volume is just too small.  A couple hundred lost<br/>
banded sales to a hobbieist pretty much amounts to the entire banded market.<br/>
Comparing the US to EQ doesn&#39;t work.  Apples and oranges for the above<br/>
reasons, and a few others, not the least of whch is that in the US things<br/>
wear out and in EQ they are eternal.<br/>
<br/>
The other point where you are wrong is that we have rejected the concepts of<br/>
collusion and oligopolies.  Anyone with a phone or electricity or Cable TV<br/>
or water knows quite well that such concepts still thrive in the US.  Not<br/>
that that&#39;s a good thing, just a fact.  The only difference between them,<br/>
and any other business in the US is that the government supports them and<br/>
discourages others.  Which doesn&#39;t quite seem fair.  I mean, if someone has<br/>
the gusto to build that better moustrap, sell it cheaper than anyone else<br/>
can, and take the market by storm, driving out all competitors, what does<br/>
the government do?  They break up the company.</div>
