<b>Subject:</b> Re: Why do they want Bronze? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-471007534">Its looks, plain and simple, some people care more about how they look than they do about having the most efficient weight/ac armor ratio.<br/>
<br/>
There are basically 2 types of people.  Type A, which cares a great deal about stats and couldn&#39;t care a bit about looks.  And type B, which care more about looks than stats.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a 36th lvl DE warrior, and I&#39;m definitally a type B person.  As soon as I was able, I aquired a full set of blackend iron chainmail.  Which is lower AC than banded and A LOT heavier.  Sure the weight was annoying, but I looked much cooler than the person standing beside me in full banded.  After a couple weeks of wearing full blackend I discovered that small bronze was the same weight but more AC.  At which point I decided to get me a full set of bronze, but after seeing countless other people in full sets of bronze I decided I really didn&#39;t like that look.  But since I was at Unrest I decided to get some anyways.  What I ended up with was bronze helm, tunic, bracers, leggings, and still had my blackend arms, gloves, boots.  This turned out to be a nice looking combo, so I thought, and I had several other people stop and tell me the same.  Now many many levels later, I have Rubicite (red plate) helm, arms, bracers, leggings, and Charred (Black plate) tunic, boots, and gloves, weilding a black 2h sword.  Charred isn&#39;t as good as Rubicite, but the combo of the red and black plate looks extremely impressive.<br/>
<br/>
To each their own, some people care more about an extra point of AC or an extra 2 points of wisdom more than they care how they look.  Some will sacrifice a couple AC and a couple points of an attribute so that they can have nicer looking equipment.</div>
