<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363497942">Last night I began selling banded at my new prices.  They are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Gorgets 7pp<br/>
Bracers 5pp each<br/>
Masks 10pp<br/>
Helms 10pp<br/>
Sleeves 10pp<br/>
Mantles 12pp<br/>
Mail 17pp<br/>
Cloak 20pp<br/>
Belt 8pp<br/>
Boots 8pp<br/>
Leggings 15pp<br/>
<br/>
I started with 9pp on my body.  After 1 and a half hours, I had 215pp on me.<br/>
I had about 3 people decline my services.  The rest bought them.  I also<br/>
sell full sets at 130pp, and I sold 1 full set (of small armor, which was a<br/>
pain for me.  being in gfay, and having to run to BB to get the molds was a<br/>
bother).  Anyhow, I believe if we stick to these prices, which still seem to<br/>
sell well, we will do good.<br/>
