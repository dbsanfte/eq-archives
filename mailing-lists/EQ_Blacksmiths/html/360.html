<div id="ygrps-yiv-992769849">Yes Jewelry craft is really cool, yes its profitable, later on, but up<br/>
until say your at a skill of 120 plus its a very big, very very deep<br/>
black hole in which to throw your pp. and the gods pity you if you are<br/>
not an enchanter trying to do this craft.<br/>

&gt; Your on a different server. Yes, if I had a enchanter, I would try jewercraft<br/>
&gt; as well. I should have done it, but I didn&#39;t. Don&#39;t feel like trying to get<br/>
&gt; master smith again. Jewelcraft seems really cool. Lots of fun. Just wish I<br/>
&gt; had made an enchanter.<br/>
