<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163488645">I&#39;d like to add on this strategy :) Just order 10 tunics and see how great they<br/>
think their prices are after they make it :) If you REALLY want to be a jerk (I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t do this, personally), order the tunics, make sure they&#39;re making them,<br/>
then log off :) That&#39;s too mean for me, though, I wouldn&#39;t do that. I&#39;d just<br/>
order a ton of tunics and watch as they lose money. Then I&#39;d suggest they sell<br/>
them at the raised prices that I am and watch as they get all happy and realize<br/>
they could make money after all :)<br/>
<br/>
If you need an excuse to order that many tunics, just say you&#39;re supplying your<br/>
guild. If you don&#39;t have a guild, go anonymous first :)<br/>

&gt; As for the fixed prices, I&#39;m all for it.  I haven&#39;t reached the level where<br/>
&gt; I can make banded yet, but when I get there, I want more than a few gold<br/>
&gt; profit for my wares.  I do have a further suggestion though.  When you see<br/>
&gt; people selling at a few gold above cost, bargain with them to get their<br/>
&gt; prices lower, and buy out their stock.  Then, sell it yourself at the fixed<br/>
&gt; price.  So long as the person doesn&#39;t run fight back to the forge and make<br/>
&gt; up a new suit of 3gp profit banded, you&#39;ve got yourself more supply without<br/>
&gt; the time and effort of making it and without and without the failure costs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My two cents, free of charge.<br/>
