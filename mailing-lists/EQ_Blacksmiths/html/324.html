<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077476411">there are more people on this list than you think :) I manage the EQ_Cooking<br/>
list which I&#39;ve only seen a select few people post to. It&#39;s more or less a dead<br/>
list because there&#39;s also an EQ_Baking list. Well, despite the lack of talk,<br/>
there&#39;s a lot of listening. Over 50 people are signed up for it. Chances are the<br/>
numbers are similarly higher on this list :) I say we try price fixing for a<br/>
little while. We don&#39;t have anything to lose, but we have everything to gain. We<br/>
can let our market die slowly or we can fight to preserve it and improve it.<br/>
Nobody else will fight the battle for us, but several (including some of our own<br/>
as some recent posts indicate) will fight against us. We can&#39;t just die... too<br/>
much has been invested in our trade to do that.<br/>

&gt; The problem with fixing prices is that there are not enough smiths on this<br/>
&gt; list.  There may be 20 spread out over 20 servers.  Whoopee.   IF this<br/>
&gt; mailing list was legitimate, then fixing prices would work. (Would the EQ<br/>
&gt; government get on our case for collusion?  hehe.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I tend to sell my banded for fair prices.  The market in greater faydark<br/>
&gt; (Fennin Ro) is steady.  There are the occasional low-priced sellers, but<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re almost never a smith; probably some warrior who just got himself a<br/>
&gt; bronze breastplate.  I generally stay around and sell armor for an hour or<br/>
&gt; two and make around 100pp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Believe it or not, smithing is still lucrative, albeit not as good as when a<br/>
&gt; server first starts.  The real profit is made from items like boots, helms,<br/>
&gt; sleeves, pants, and tunics.  Boots cost about 3pp to make and I sell them<br/>
&gt; for 10pp consistently, and they&#39;re easy to make.  Pants and tunics are easy<br/>
&gt; for me as well (skill 134) I sell them for three times their cost (16pp and<br/>
&gt; 18pp, respectively).  I tend to scowl at masks and belts because they cost 2<br/>
&gt; metal sheets and I can only sell them for 5pp and 7pp, respectively.<br/>
