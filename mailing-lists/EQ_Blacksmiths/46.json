Another point of interest --<br/>\nEast Freeport has a shop that sells only rusty weapons.  I&#39;ve been there but<br/>\ncan&#39;t remember where exactly.  Instead of using all my training points I<br/>\nspent only 2 points and made the next 21 levels by sharpening weapons and<br/>\nthen selling them.  Most of them i sold back to the shop at a loss, but I<br/>\nmanaged to sell some two handers for 5 gold each.  It cost a lot more this<br/>\nway..but since my wife is a tailor I didn&#39;t have much use for the money at<br/>\nthe time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Kevin Runde &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:krunde@...\">krunde@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello All,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am brand new to the list and just about to start smithing.
