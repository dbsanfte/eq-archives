Tailoring is probably next to be worked on after make poison,<br/>\nand then probably tinkering or alchemy from what I&#39;ve read all around), we<br/>\nshould only sell for 5 to 10 plat less than the magical plates are sold for. We<br/>\ncan&#39;t sell for NPC plate prices (people would just buy magical plate) but I<br/>\nreally don&#39;t want to shoot myself in the foot and have the same thing happen<br/>\nwith plate as it did to banded. Please, no flames, I know some of you will only<br/>\nwant 10 plat profit per piece, that&#39;s your right, and this is mine. This is what<br/>\nI will be doing and I would hope if you&#39;re concerned over smithing, please do<br/>\nthe same. Plate will NOT be cheaper to make oneself (not only the 150 plat it<br/>\ntakes to get to banded, but all the time selling banded to get to making plate),<br/>\nso we don&#39;t have to worry about that happening. Just gotta be competetive with<br/>\nmagical plates. Again, please no flames, I&#39;m terribly sick of them, and I will<br/>\nnot respond. Please, if you&#39;re on my side, don&#39;t respond to any flames either.<br/>\nLet the baby have his/her bottle.<br/>\n-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Trade Council GM</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
