I have a regular customer<br/>\nthat purchases studs from me (hopefully will be moving up to steel boning<br/>\nsoon) and I only need one file now.  I haven&#39;t failed a stud in a very long<br/>\ntime so I don&#39;t know what happens if you do, but if you succeed you get a<br/>\nstud and your file back!  Ok, so it&#39;s not a biggie, but it is nice only<br/>\nhaving to make 30 metal bits instead of 40 now for 10 studs.  I keep the<br/>\nsame file and reuse it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraethar<br/>\nHigh Elf Enchanter<br/>\nAccomplished Jeweler and Master Smith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
