The male vendor in the house SHOULD have a full complement of medium banded molds as well as sheet metal. Please post the results of your survey to the list. Apparently, the vendor in E&#39;ci has had his items replaced with the normal food/water/junk vending list. Tarew Marr server (sp?) supposedly still has the normal supplies on this guy, so maybe it&#39;s just E&#39;ci that&#39;s hosed? If your vendor doesn&#39;t have his molds and metal, immediately /petition a GM on your server to investigate the trouble. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\n<br/>\nAraman, 19th level Paladin<br/>\nWarwinds of Norrath, E&#39;ci<br/>\nSkill 143 Blacksmith, out-of-work until this is fixed<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:madoc1@...\">madoc1@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
