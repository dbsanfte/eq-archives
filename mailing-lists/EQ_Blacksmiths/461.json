When did this happen???  Seems to me that if<br/>\nyou have features that don&#39;t work yet, and weekly fixes and updates, that<br/>\nyou are still IN beta!  Decisions are still being made as to characters,<br/>\nclasses, skills, spells, etc... So we really are still in a beta stage...<br/>\nActually the former stage should really have been called an Open Alpha stage<br/>\n(or Beta 1 and we are now in Beta 2?  3?  4?).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s one thing to fix small bugs that were UNNOTICED before release, and its<br/>\nanother thing to add whole NEW (unplanned for) features and call it an<br/>\nupgrade... But Verant is still fixing things that do not work properly in<br/>\nalmost every area... Things that they KNEW did not work right when they<br/>\nreleased it for sale to the general public... That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not<br/>\nstill (actually) in beta...<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\nProud member of Platinum Sphere Guild - www.platinumsphere.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Nick Emmerich &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seorin@...\">seorin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; really, a very nice point.

Now that beta is over, there<br/>\n&gt; can be no more &#39;sweeping changes&#39; like there used to be. In beta, that was<br/>\n&gt; part of playing. Getting used to those changes. That can&#39;t happen in the<br/>\n&gt; commercial release, it&#39;s VERY bad business :( I really wish it were<br/>\n&gt; practical to do this, I like your idea.
