I was under the impression<br/>\n&gt; that this mailing list was to keep people informed about EverQuest, and<br/>\n&gt; particularly about Smithing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have decided to no longer post any messages to any boards or lists. I am<br/>\n&gt; now doing this site solely for my friends and those people who manage to<br/>\n&gt; find it. I am sick of people complaining about something I do for free to<br/>\n&gt; help them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you want to be kept abreast of changes, just e-mail me saying so and I<br/>\n&gt; will send an update notice directly to you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think the site has a lot of potential considering that all the info<br/>\ncomes<br/>\n&gt; from me, and I have no real HTML experience. (Just bought a book<br/>\nyesterday.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry to have bothered anyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Charles Adams<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reedo&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:reedo@...\">reedo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Personally I&#39;m really glad that he posted his web address.  He has some of<br/>\n&gt; the best info on blacksmithing on the web.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Whitcraft,David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DWHITCRAFT@...\">DWHITCRAFT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Agreed! I like when smaller sites tell people they have updates. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;like it when they flood everyone, but I&#39;ve only seen 2 posts from this<br/>\nguy,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and I like his site. If he gets time to work on it, it could be very very<br/>\n&gt; &gt;benificial. I&#39;ve been there a couple of times, and like the info there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve not had bad experience with people on boards, as I don&#39;t post much<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I delete babble very quickly. *shrug* Was annoying to come into work<br/>\nMonday<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and have 149 new messages waiting...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-Zantaer, Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Chet Watkins&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chetwatkins@...\">chetwatkins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Has everyone on this game gone postal???!!! WHO CARES!!! If he has an<br/>\n&gt; update<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to his web site and he wants to post it up here for people to check out,<br/>\n&gt; LET<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;HIM!! It does deal with EQ and that should be all that really matters. I<br/>\nam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;seeing a bad trend on the message board and in game and it has a lot to<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with things like this. PEOPLE ARE GETTING RUDE. I had better run ins with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;pkers on UO then with the people im seeing in EQ and the mailing list.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Please, Everyone just sit back, relax, and enjoy the info we recieve. I<br/>\n&gt; know<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;as well as anyone else reading these that your probably at work, if you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;werent you would be playing right now, so dont tell me you have something<br/>\n&gt; &gt;better to be doing then reading these posts. I&#39;m not saying post anything<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and everything, but this mailing list has done very well about staying on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;subject, a couple of links to eq info sites is not going to kill anyone.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Rant over, return to your normal blacksmithing news.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Xezol - Lvl 13 Gnome Mag on E&#39;Ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit My EverQuest Page; including zone maps, trade skill guides, general<br/>\n&gt; weapons info, and more:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dubuque.net/~sirkal/EverQuest.htm\">http://www.dubuque.net/~sirkal/EverQuest.htm</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Attention Star Wars fans!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist is the best place for your Star Wars list!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join today!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
