I didn&#39;t say I sold at cost, do the math, a tunic cost way less than 15pp to make<br/>\nb.  at the grocery store I&#39;m not being charged outrageous fees because farmer A can&#39;t produce as apples as efficiently as farmer B<br/>\nc.  If I feel grocery store A is charging too much I go to grocery store B and buy the same merchandise at a lower price, so its up to grocer A to lower their prices to meet consumer need/want, not up to grocer B to raise their price to match the market &quot;standards&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;So yes, you do have to consider costs of failures too... If a &#39;client&#39; came<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;up to you with all the raw materials and said &quot;Make me a tunic and I will<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;give you 5pp.&quot; Would you tell them Okay without mentioning that it *might<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;not* work and they would be out the 5pp for the raw materials?  Or, if you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;failed with their materials would you then use your own until you were able<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;to produce one for them?  This would be a bad thing for you if it did... But<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;if that is your thinking, then the heck with ME learning to smith, I am<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;going to start ordering stuff from you all the time!!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t work like that, if someone came up to me and said they had the materials, I would offer to buy the materials, then charge them my normal price.  But that has never happened to me...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;In fact, please put me down for two tunics (I will sell one for 20pp and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;mine will only cost 10), or better yet, make it FOUR!  I can get a discount<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;for multiples, right??  hehe... (let&#39;s see now, if I get them for 13pp each<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;x4=52 plat... I can sell 3 x20=60... I get mine free AND make 8 plat! All<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;without smithing!! Kewl!!)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a.  I sell tunics for 15, you should read more carefully<br/>\nb.  people like you make me sick.....you&#39;d take advantage of someone trying to do the community a favor (me) by buying my stuff cheap and selling at much higher prices for your own personal gain.  &quot;Screw thy fellow man&quot; must be your motto of life.<br/>\nc.  You would get no such discount from me, infact I&#39;d probably charge you 40pp per tunic due to your own greed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Of course if I order more, you should give me an even BIGGER discount<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;because, after all, I am HELPING you to learn to be a better smith, right?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Lemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I generally don&#39;t give discounts on bulk purchases because either someone is trying to take advantage of my low prices, or they are trying to twink out their guild buddies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\nJoin a new list today!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
