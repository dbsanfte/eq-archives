First,<br/>\nit&#39;s free if you kill a creature that drops it (not worth time).  Second,<br/>\nore isn&#39;t needed for making armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as for molds.  Since you used a tunic in your letter, I will use it as<br/>\nwell.  A Tunic molds costs over 1pp.  It requires 3 metal sheets, all of<br/>\nwhich also cost over 1pp.  Then the water, at a palsy 1sp or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sell my tunics at 17pp.  I consider this a fair price, and many else have<br/>\nagreed with me (as I have sold many many many for this price).  How can you<br/>\nsay it&#39;s a bit steep?  It is MY choice to sell for the price that I see fit.<br/>\nIt is not up to you to decide how much I feel my time is worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn any account, there will (for the most part) always be a flow, if not<br/>\nconstant, for banded.  Seeing as how new people begin the game, or old<br/>\npeople create new characters (that are not always twinked mind you), we will<br/>\nhave other&#39;s to sell to.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaijar the Mage Blacksmith<br/>\n&quot;With how little weight I can carry, you damn well better appreciate this<br/>\narmor!
