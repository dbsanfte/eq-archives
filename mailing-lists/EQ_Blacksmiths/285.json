But here are<br/>\nmy suggestions:<br/>\n<br/>\nSave 20 points and dump them into the skill, if not already at 20 (your<br/>\nguild will tell you that you need advanced training after 20, which means<br/>\nyou have to start spending some money)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom skill 21-27, sharpen weapons that cost over 1g to sell. At this point<br/>\nyou won&#39;t get any skill increases from daggers and maces.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom skill 27-41, start making scalers. You will need metal bits (2 small<br/>\nblocks of ore + a flask of water), scaler mold and a flask of water. These<br/>\nare great because if you fail, you still get an item to sell.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom skill 42-115, make skewers. Metal bits, skewer mold and a flask of<br/>\nwater. You will rarely make these, but this is the cheapest way to get your<br/>\nskill up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would wait until skill 60 to begin trying to make Banded Armor. At this<br/>\ntime, you should be able to make Gorgets and Bracers with ease. That should<br/>\ncompensate you for your time spent jacking up the skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took me 3 12-hour days and over 200pp (i lost count) to get my skill from<br/>\n30-100. It WILL aggrevate you, but this skill can be one of the most<br/>\nrewarding.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yur@...\">yur@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yur@...\">yur@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tThursday, July 08, 1999 8:52 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[EQ_Blacksmiths] how to start<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yur@...\">yur@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I want to get started on black smithing, my guild master offer me the<br/>\n&gt; skill to<br/>\n&gt; be trained. can someone tell me how to start up ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Richard Yu - IBM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
