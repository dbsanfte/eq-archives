You see, in EQ, every single piece of banded<br/>\nis the same.  Unlike in the real world, where Pepsi can claim their soda is<br/>\nbetter than coke and offer bullshit reasons as to why.  Even though Coke may<br/>\nbe cheaper, some people prefer Pepsi and will pay the extra $.50.  In EQ,<br/>\neveryone knows banded is banded so the ONLY thing that matters is price, not<br/>\nquality.  You can&#39;t &quot;build a better mousetrap,&quot; because the traps are all<br/>\nthe same.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, you can train in multiple trade skills and offer say some cheap ring<br/>\nif someone buys your banded, but, if the consumer is looking only for<br/>\nbanded, he will choose the lower price rather than the higher price with the<br/>\nextra ring or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the armor market was more varied (say, enchanted sheet metal gives banded<br/>\ndifferent properties), then there could be quality competition as your<br/>\nmagical banded might be better thus sell for a higher price.  But, it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t exist, so the only thing that plays a part in the EQ economy is<br/>\nprice.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrenfen of Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ----------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve subscribed to this list to learn more about smithing not to collude<br/>\n </span></blockquote>with<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; all the other smiths in the game in an attempt to &quot;profit&quot; from customers<br/>\n </span></blockquote>by<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; setting arbitrary prices.
