They are the very last<br/>\nmold on the left of her list.  I<br/>\n&#39;m  on Cazic-Thule but I would assume that they are all the same.  As far as<br/>\nspending hundreds of Platinum.  Yes, expect to spend hundreds before you<br/>\nmake any banded regularly.  I&#39;d spend at least 200PP before I could make it<br/>\nregularly.  I only have an INT of 75 so that slowed me down, but I have a<br/>\nvery high success rate so it counterbalances.  At 50 I was making skewers 30<br/>\nor 40% of the time.  Don&#39;t worry.  After you are good at banded that first<br/>\ncouple of hundred you put into it won&#39;t seem like any big deal.  That just a<br/>\nfew hours good work now.<br/>\n<br/>\nArden<br/>\nCazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
