I lived in LA for a long time... but now I enjoy the<br/>\nprice of Gas in Nashville.  Actually the price is the same.. just the tax is<br/>\na lot lower. anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont mind a virtual Trade Union who trys to get prices to a &#39;more<br/>\nprofitable&#39; level to recoup some R&D cost, but if an independent wants to<br/>\ntry to come in and take the market with Low prices/High Volume... That fine<br/>\nwith me.. He still makes money.. I get cheap goods..<br/>\n<br/>\nToo bad all servers are not PvP.  The price fixers could start their own<br/>\nvirtual MOB!  You stay out of our market.. or... we send Bubba the Troll to<br/>\nvisit ya.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Lemac Justerian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, May 20, 1999 5:58 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Price Fixing<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Lemac Justerian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Daniel C.

Go to all the stores in your area and<br/>\n&gt; check the price of milk!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then do the same with gasoline!  Price fixing is everywhere!  Where I live<br/>\n&gt; (Santa Barbara), the CHEAPEST price for gasoline is $1.59 per gallon... Go<br/>\n&gt; FARTHER away from the refineries to little old Lompoc (an extra 60 miles<br/>\n&gt; away and 30 miles off the freeways) and the gas is only $1.39!!<br/>\n&gt; Or, worse<br/>\n&gt; yet, head to some southern states where the gasoline is only<br/>\n&gt; $1.25 or so...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Price fixing is done by area and controlled by the markets themselves...<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s everywhere and on all sorts of products... the FTC is only interested<br/>\n&gt; when they can get their names in the paper...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
