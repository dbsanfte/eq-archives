I&#39;ve sold<br/>\n&gt; several people full suits of banded and then here &quot;You forgot the gloves.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Then I have to explain to them that there are no banded gloves.  It really<br/>\n&gt; is a pain.  I don&#39;t know if they forgot or did it on purpose but it would<br/>\n&gt; have been nice to make them.  The best you can do is get ringmail or chain<br/>\n&gt; to go along with the banded.  I<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mark<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Amazing $14,000 Opportunity.
