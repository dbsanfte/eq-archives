My first piece\r<br/>\nof banded is now fastened securely around my\r<br/>\nneck.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAfter this I decided to finally start doing\r<br/>\nskewers since they only cost 226cp for each\r<br/>\nattempt and next higher cost non-trivial item,\r<br/>\nSewing Kit, costs 576cp per attempt.  I started\r<br/>\ngetting a decent success rate and my skill level\r<br/>\nwas rising in about the same fashion as the other\r<br/>\nitems I was creating.  Also about every\r<br/>\n10 skill points I would attempt to make the\r<br/>\nother items to see if they had become trivial.\r<br/>\nUnfortunately some of the items require ceramic\r<br/>\nlining, a pottery skill, so I had to start\r<br/>\nworking on my pottery (it rose from 1 to 8 :).\r<br/>\nThe only thing that has become trivial from 68\r<br/>\nto 102 is Steel Boning.  During this period I\r<br/>\nspent a total of around 55pp.  This includes\r<br/>\naround 5pp for pottery and I kept the\r<br/>\nmetal cooking items for increasing my cooking\r<br/>\ntrade skill which amounts to about 6pp in sell\r<br/>\nback costs.  An additional 10pp was spent doing\r<br/>\nthe attempts to find the trivial levels for\r<br/>\nthe other items that resulted in failure.  So,\r<br/>\nif I just stuck to doing skewers it would be\r<br/>\naround 34pp.  This brings my total to around\r<br/>\n100pp to get to this level or about 1pp per\r<br/>\nskill point.  I should mention that the character\r<br/>\nis a human warrior that put all his extra points\r<br/>\ninto strength and stamina.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo to summarize:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLegend\r<br/>\n&lt;= means that it became trivial at this level,\r<br/>\n   but it could be sooner\r<br/>\n== became trivial at this skill level\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; trivial level is somewhere above this level\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sharpening Rusty Daggers == 20/21\r<br/>\nMetal Bits == 20/21\r<br/>\nFile == 20/21\r<br/>\nScaler == 41\r<br/>\nSmall Container &lt;= 41\r<br/>\nMedium Container &lt;= 41\r<br/>\nLantern == 68 (it creates a large lantern)\r<br/>\nCookie Cutter &lt;= 68 (I only did the Animal shape\r<br/>\n   so I assuming the other shapes are the same)\r<br/>\nLarge Container &lt;= 68\r<br/>\nSheet Metal &lt;= 68\r<br/>\nStuds &lt;= 68\r<br/>\nSteel Boning &lt;= 88\r<br/>\nSkewers &gt; 101\r<br/>\nMuffin Tin &gt; 101\r<br/>\nPie Tin &gt; 101\r<br/>\nCake Round &gt; 101\r<br/>\nBread Tin &gt; 101\r<br/>\nSmoker &gt; 101\r<br/>\nPot &gt; 101\r<br/>\nSewing Kit &gt; 101 (it creates a small sewing kit)\r<br/>\nFolded Sheet Metal ??? (haven&#39;t attempted)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI did do successful attempts of all non-trivial\r<br/>\nitems at a skill level of 101.  I just happened\r<br/>\nto have an increase to 102 on the last item\r<br/>\nI made, a Sewing Kit.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI have successfully made all the items in the\r<br/>\nBasic Blacksmithing book except for Lockpicks\r<br/>\n(could not find the mold), Toolbox (the recipe\r<br/>\nis bugged), and Folded Sheet Metal (too\r<br/>\nexpensive to try yet).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs for banded, I did successfully make another\r<br/>\nbanded gorget on the first attempt at level 101\r<br/>\nbut it was not trivial.  I have not attempted any\r<br/>\nother banded items yet.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI&#39;m going to put this character aside for a while\r<br/>\nto work on others, so it might be a week before\r<br/>\nI get back to blacksmithing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAre there any advanced blacksmiths out there that\r<br/>\ncould give us an idea of when the banded items\r<br/>\nbecome trivial?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nmike</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
