The answer<br/>\nis at level 136, all items seem to give me the trivial message except<br/>\ncloaks.  In case you are wondering, a great place to level your smith up<br/>\nfrom 122 to 135 is Serpent&#39;s Supply in High Pass Hold.  There is a forge<br/>\ninside the place right next to a vendor with needle and thimble molds and a<br/>\nvendor with water in the same building (since I brought my own metal bits, I<br/>\nhave no idea if an ore vendor is nearby).  This arrangement is important<br/>\nbecause sewing kits are a container and won&#39;t fit in a backpack or other<br/>\ncontainer.  This arrangement allowed me to literally turn around every few<br/>\nseconds and sell my sewing kits to a vendor.  After leveling up, I returned<br/>\nto Freeport and had much better success making armor.  Oddly, the mantles<br/>\nstill had a 50% succes rate even though they are trivial.  Thankfully,<br/>\nsuccess rate on other items is very high now.  I did blow like 30pp before I<br/>\nnoticed I wasn&#39;t getting the failure message for making cloaks (ran out of<br/>\nmoney) but rather the &quot;these items do not combine...&quot; message.  Doh!!!  I<br/>\nwas using 1 water, 1 mold, 3 metal sheets.  Not really my fault as my guide<br/>\nsays 3 sheets as do 2 other guides I found at various sites.  I found one<br/>\nsite that says 2 sheets (is this correct?)  I managed to sell a couple<br/>\npieces of armor before logging out and will try this tomorrow (1 water, 1<br/>\nmold, 2 metal sheets).</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
