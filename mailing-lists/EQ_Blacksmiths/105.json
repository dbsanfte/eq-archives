I am<br/>\ncurrently at level 28 now, but it has cost me 30 plat to get there... Why?<br/>\nbecause I cannot increase by making Files either, and because I cannot find<br/>\nSCALER molds (supposed to be next easiest) I am forced to practice using<br/>\nskewers... Of this, I have been increasing, but only made ONE out of over<br/>\n40! (the very FIRST time I tried it in fact!)<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say this is very frustrating, time and money consuming... Moreso<br/>\nthan I would have thought... At this rate, it could end up costing me 100&#39;s<br/>\nof Plat before I can make anything to sell for a Profit (per item that is),<br/>\nbut makes me wonder if I shouldn&#39;t just spend the plat and buy stuff for<br/>\nmyself and not worry about making any for sale...<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Reedo&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:reedo@...\">reedo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Both skewers and scalers can be found in East Freeport.
