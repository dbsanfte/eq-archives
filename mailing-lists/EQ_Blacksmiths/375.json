The markets are too large here.<br/>\nIn EQ, where your market is in the hundreds to thousands, it is quite<br/>\npossible for a hobbieist to completely ruin other&#39;s chances to make a buck<br/>\nat the trades.  How many mom and pop Auto manufacturers are there out there?<br/>\nThere are a few.  Vector, Panoz, some others.  I&#39;m guessing that the few<br/>\ndozen to a hundred cars they sell a year aren&#39;t putting any kind of dent in<br/>\nGM&#39;s bottom line.  The volume is just too small.  A couple hundred lost<br/>\nbanded sales to a hobbieist pretty much amounts to the entire banded market.<br/>\nComparing the US to EQ doesn&#39;t work.  Apples and oranges for the above<br/>\nreasons, and a few others, not the least of whch is that in the US things<br/>\nwear out and in EQ they are eternal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other point where you are wrong is that we have rejected the concepts of<br/>\ncollusion and oligopolies.  Anyone with a phone or electricity or Cable TV<br/>\nor water knows quite well that such concepts still thrive in the US.  Not<br/>\nthat that&#39;s a good thing, just a fact.  The only difference between them,<br/>\nand any other business in the US is that the government supports them and<br/>\ndiscourages others.  Which doesn&#39;t quite seem fair.  I mean, if someone has<br/>\nthe gusto to build that better moustrap, sell it cheaper than anyone else<br/>\ncan, and take the market by storm, driving out all competitors, what does<br/>\nthe government do?  They break up the company.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
