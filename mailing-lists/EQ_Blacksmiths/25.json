Stone<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, from what I understand (I&#39;m not a blacksmith, but have been<br/>\n&gt; researching it a bit), you can use blacksmithing skill to get a rusty<br/>\n&gt; weapon<br/>\n&gt; to tarnished, which will (I believe) decrease the delay, but leave the<br/>\n&gt; damage alone. If your successful in trying, you get a tarnished weapon.<br/>\n&gt; If<br/>\n&gt; you fail, you destroy the weapon. The exact procedure, I&#39;m not sure of,<br/>\n&gt; sorry.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen a doc on blacksmithing somewhere on a board that had<br/>\n&gt; sharpening of<br/>\n&gt; weapons in it, but I can&#39;t find it at the moment. Anyone know where that<br/>\n&gt; is?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Zantaer<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: D Thoma [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:milamber@...\">milamber@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 3:32 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Sharpening ...

You don&#39;t want to make skewers yet either,<br/>\n&gt; you will waist a HUGE amount of cash for little skill gain.

I have gotten my swiming up to<br/>\n&gt; 34 (bad, I think), and working on one handed blunt (maxed one handed<br/>\nslash).<br/>\n&gt; I really want to try new things because attacking 2 skeletons with the new<br/>\n&gt; one handed blunt skill is about the only fun I am having right now.
