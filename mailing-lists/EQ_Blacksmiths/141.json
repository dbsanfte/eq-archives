I ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1235050203\">Hi All,<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is going to sound like a really odd question, but I&#39;m very curious as <br/>\nto what the attitudes and opinions are of other blacksmiths in the game. I <br/>\nplay on Innoruuk server, and just recently got my blacksmithing skill up to <br/>\n104. I was contacted by a potential customer who inquired about my prices <br/>\nfor a banded tunic. I replied, but it took him several minutes to respond. I <br/>\nassume that he was negotiating with other blacksmiths, because he messaged <br/>\nme a few minutes later to tell me I had good prices and that he would buy <br/>\none. I made the transaction, but was then contacted by another blacksmith <br/>\nwho seemed outraged that I sold my wares for so cheap. Because he knew of <br/>\nthe exact price, I assume that the seller had also been speaking to him and <br/>\nthat the price was discussed. So apparently, this blacksmith felt that I had <br/>\nundercut him out of a commission. He then told me that the prices were fixed <br/>\namong master blacksmiths, at roughly one half chain. When I asked who else <br/>\nwas using these prices, I was told everyone but given no specific examples <br/>\nof well-known blacksmiths who agreed to this price-fixing.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I dont necessarily disagree with setting prices. A lot of money goes into <br/>\ngetting skill up; much more than simply buying a full suit of banded (am I <br/>\nthe only smith who started wearing banded well after many other people of <br/>\nsimiliar level?), as well as the cost of failures, which I still have quite <br/>\na few of and which eat up profit rather quickly. But I don&#39;t want to be <br/>\novercharging for these items and losing customers to people who obvioulsy <br/>\nhave a much better clue than I do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nDy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
