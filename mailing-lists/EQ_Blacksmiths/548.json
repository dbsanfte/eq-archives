Sort <br/>\nof. They &quot;forgot&quot; to when they did that big patch earlier in the month, and <br/>\n&quot;remembered&quot; it later. The molds may be found in Kelethin and Steamfront <br/>\nalong with the normal banded molds, but for some reason Freeport&#39;s medium <br/>\nmold vendor (East Freeport, near the docks) doesn&#39;t have them, at least not <br/>\nthat I saw. They MAY be located with the weapon molds, I&#39;m not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, so far they seem to be as hard as cloaks. With a 143 skill, I had a <br/>\n25% failure rate. The gauntlets do NOT show up on the player model, so if <br/>\nyour customer wants them for looks then he&#39;s SOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been selling them on E&#39;ci at a good clip at 12pp, in line with the <br/>\nSmiths of Norrath union rates. A few complaints (&quot;*whine* ..but banded is <br/>\nonly 1pp per AC! /whine&quot;) but once they find out it&#39;s as hard to make as <br/>\ncloaks they&#39;re sympathetic.<br/>\n<br/>\nStats are 7AC, weight 3(sm) and 4(med), don&#39;t know about large.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~sblack9/Blacksmiths.htm\">http://home.earthlink.net/~sblack9/Blacksmiths.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Araman&quot;, 18th level paladin<br/>\nE&#39;ci, Warwinds of Norrath<br/>\nSkill 143 Blacksmith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
