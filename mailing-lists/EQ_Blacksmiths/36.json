It was called Dunedigger and it looked like a huge<br/>\narmadillo. After &gt;dispatching it, it yielded up an armadillo hide. Does<br/>\nanyone know of a use for it? Perhaps a type of armor? Any help would be<br/>\ngreatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nDunedigger is a very rare spawn in N Ro.  He very rarely drops a special<br/>\nshield called a Scute shield which is amazing and in high demand.  I hadn&#39;t<br/>\nheard of him dropping anything else... no idea what to do with armadillo<br/>\nhide.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note... if you are replying please only quote what you are<br/>\nreplying too... and especially if you reply to the digest.
