What&#39;s next, a stock market?  heheheh...little joke, there.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThey do make sense in the game, however.  If I didn&#39;t have my vault, I&#39;d be overloaded by a factor of about 5...and I&#39;d be far more cautious with all my money on me, and without my &quot;emergency kit&quot; (clothes, staff, food and drink) in the vault for when I buy the farm.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBut seriously, dealing in face-to-face trades and keeping everything on a barter and trade level for the game makes sense to me.  Just my humble opinion.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSkalpyl\r<br/>\nWizard of the 8th Level\r<br/>\nApprentice Blacksmith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
