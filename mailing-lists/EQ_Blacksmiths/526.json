If not, a trip to Ak&#39;Anon will get you the proper<br/>\nmaterials.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Felwithe, going on the path towards Kelethin.  The first lift you come<br/>\nacross, go up it.  On that platform, on the other side of the central tree<br/>\ntrunk, there is a merchant that sells all the molds needed for Sewing Kits.<br/>\nWater can also be bought on this platform.  The ramp going up, which the<br/>\nvendor selling the molds faces, is where you want to go next.  Coming to the<br/>\ntop of this platform, the forge comes right into view.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where I did all my forging, through my level of 164 (so far).  I&#39;ve<br/>\nfound it to be VERY convenient.  Close to all medium armor molds, and fairly<br/>\nclose to small armor molds (outside Kaladim).  Only thing hard to find are<br/>\nlarge molds, but those are really only good if you have a troll/ogre selling<br/>\nbase.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, there ya go from my experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaijar, Magician At Large</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
