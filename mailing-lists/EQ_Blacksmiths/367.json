Here&#39;s a couple things that have worked well for me in<br/>\n&gt; the Qeynos area of the Bristlebain server.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Whenever I see a new smith auctioning his wares in my area, I start up<br/>\n&gt; a conversation and do a price check, let him know how much he can get<br/>\n&gt; selling in my area. Wish him luck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another thing that&#39;s worked well for me, and I hate to give this trick<br/>\n&gt; away, but it helps so much with the price fixing, what&#39;s good for all<br/>\n&gt; is good for me, and all that. So here goes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve a couple buddies who I&#39;ve enlisted as resellers for me. I sell to<br/>\n&gt; them at a 30% discount off my regular prices. They resell at my<br/>\n&gt; current full price, when they sell items off, I restock them. This<br/>\n&gt; moves my product, these friends make money (some a whole lot of it, my<br/>\n&gt; girlfriend has over 300 plat in the bank at level 17, most from<br/>\n&gt; reselling my goods). This has the added bonus of price fixing. Say<br/>\n&gt; someone asks me how much for leggings, I say 20p. That&#39;s too much they<br/>\n&gt; say, so I tell &#39;em check around, that&#39;s the going rate. They do a<br/>\n&gt; couple price checks with others selling banded in that area (MY<br/>\n&gt; RESELLERS) and what do ya know, that IS the going rate, yes, they did<br/>\n&gt; I price check with me, indirectly, but they don&#39;t know that. Other<br/>\n&gt; smiths see you and your resellers all selling for the same amount,<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;ll bump their prices.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Strength in numbers. A group of three or four all agreeing on a price<br/>\n&gt; (those three or four include you and your resellers), have a much<br/>\n&gt; easier time convincing the new smith in town that these are the going<br/>\n&gt; rates, than just one snotty blacksmith trying to get you to up your<br/>\n&gt; rates.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This works folks, give it a try.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Abbot of Bristlebain<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Master of Trades. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
