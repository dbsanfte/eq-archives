But since I am not able to go into E. <br/>\nFreeport which seems to go the smithing capital of the world what am I <br/>\nsupposed to do about getting molds?  Should I just start a good character or <br/>\nsomething and go to Freeport? I would hate to do that, so if there is <br/>\nanything that is possible in Neriak, or another evil town, would be greatly <br/>\nappreciated. Not sure about Oggok or Grobb. Forget which molds are there. Any <br/>\ninformation would be great, thanks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
