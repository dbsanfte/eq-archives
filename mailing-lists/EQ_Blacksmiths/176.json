But instead of going off on how things will<br/>\nbe, based on the RL market and all that I just move on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is the great power of this game... If one thing is unsatifying you move<br/>\non to the next. You can kill monsters alone, kill them in groups, if you<br/>\npicked the right server you can kill players alone, or kill them in groups,<br/>\nyou can work on trade skills, explore your zone and on the ones around it,<br/>\ntalk to the NPC around and do some quests. And then just when you think you<br/>\nhave done it all--Move to a different geographical area! Then you get to<br/>\nstart over, cuz the mosters are different, and so are the players!  Who has<br/>\ntime to sit around and be a merchant? there is adventure to be had in<br/>\nNorrath!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=Shazar=-<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: David Rogers [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:derogers334@...\">derogers334@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 21, 1999 6:57 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Price Fixing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: David Rogers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:derogers334@...\">derogers334@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Jason Coan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; heh, I didn&#39;t even finish reading it myself...., but<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I think I&#39;m going to drop my prices further just to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; piss this guy off even more<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t even make it through half of this message,<br/>\n&gt; but man can&#39;t you find something better to put all<br/>\n&gt; that energy into?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Short attention span theater, two tickets reserved for the above quoted<br/>\nindividuals.<br/>\n<br/>\n(shrug) I enjoy this game a lot, and that means I (gasp, here&#39;s the<br/>\nkicker boys) think about it.  Thoughts are more than single sentence<br/>\nstatements.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut go ahead and flame, you will anyway.  We&#39;ll see who&#39;s right in<br/>\nanother month or two; I predict that servers with uber smiths charging<br/>\nlow prices will see only a few smiths left after a few weeks.  If you<br/>\nwant the validating evidence as to this position, read that post you<br/>\nlost interest in and wandering off to watch WWF in the middle of.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really a shame, I was looking forward to playing a smith too; but<br/>\nwhy should I bother if I&#39;ll only make a gold over costs?  I continue,<br/>\nhowever, to hold out hope that Verdant will fix the trade skills, and<br/>\nmake them work as they should (platemail, weaponsmithing, cloth armor,<br/>\netc...)<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist:  bringing the world together.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nJoin a new list today!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
