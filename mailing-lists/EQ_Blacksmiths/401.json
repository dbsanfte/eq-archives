No agruement.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever not all special weapons and armor need be magical in nature. If<br/>\ntinkering is ever completely (reletive term) and properly implemented then<br/>\nthey should be able to produce tools and/or components to produce unusual<br/>\nsmithed equipment. (Please note that if an enchanter were to aid the<br/>\ntinkerer the produced tinkered tools/components could be enven more powerful<br/>\nand useful)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe addition of enchanted jewel components in smithed items might yield<br/>\nspecial effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nI forgot to mention this to the tailors, but I&#39;ll tell my fellow smiths.<br/>\nAlchemy (another currently iffy skill) could produce potions (to be used in<br/>\nplace of water) that could also effect smithed items.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trades were not ment to be independent, and if they were they would be,<br/>\nIMHO, far less enjoyable. Sure, trying to track down someone who is skilled<br/>\nenough in a certain trade to help you can be a pain, but it is a great<br/>\nfeeling when you finally do.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, for something a bit off topic. I&#39;ve also been thinking it would be<br/>\ngreat if smith could produce (perhaps with the help of some group or other)<br/>\nmetal thread. This could then be turned into bolts of cloth by tailors, and<br/>\nused in different fashions by either smiths or tailors. I don&#39;t ever expect<br/>\nto see it in game (to complicated to code), but it would be nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nDervan<br/>\nDreaming of a better overall trade system<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Paul Hill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:paul@...\">paul@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, July 13, 1999 9:56 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Creating Magical Armor and Weapons<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Paul Hill&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:paul@...\">paul@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am not trying to take anything away from enchanters, but why should all<br/>\n&gt;magical items be dependent on one single class?  The same discussion is<br/>\n&gt;going on in one of the tailoring lists.  If all magical items that can be<br/>\n&gt;made through all skills need an enchanter to do the enchanting, enchanters<br/>\n&gt;will be overworked.  Maybe enchanters need to be used in creating certain<br/>\n&gt;magical items for smiths, but by no means all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;] Creating Magical Armor and Weapons<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Nosferatu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nosferatu@...\">nosferatu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Yeah forget what the book said and all that stuff.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  reread your FaQ and the &quot;official&quot; guide to EQ, magical weapons are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; supposed to require the help of a high level enchanter and a master<br/>\n&gt;&gt; smith, the one things we shouldn&#39;t need is to deal with a slimy little<br/>\n&gt;&gt; dwarven smith or some such ;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  as for &quot;would become the best class to make magical items.&quot; well I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; should hope so, its what our class does! what next?
