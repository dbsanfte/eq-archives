People call me Nick all the time, be it in e-mail, message","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-198163420\">From: Nick Emmerich &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seorin@...\">seorin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, the RL name thing isn&#39;t meant to offend you. People call me<br/>\n&#39;Nick&#39; all the time,<br/>\nbe it in e-mail, message boards, or whatever. It&#39;s my name, I don&#39;t really<br/>\ncare. If you do,<br/>\nhowever, I&#39;ll respect that and stick to Cerran. I&#39;m not out to offend you,<br/>\nI&#39;m just trying to<br/>\nprove a point<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not especially known for banded on my server, I&#39;m at an equal platform<br/>\nwith everyone else.<br/>\nIf I can sell at a price, other people can too. So, when I sell at higher<br/>\nprices, that proves<br/>\nto other smiths that they can as well. Instead of undermining my price and<br/>\nmaking less money<br/>\nper sale, they can go to a different zone and sell for the same price I am.<br/>\nSales are out<br/>\nthere, and if the market isn&#39;t oversaturated then they always will be. Why<br/>\nget less money and<br/>\ncontribute to market oversaturation at the same time? Both are negative<br/>\nthings to a smith.<br/>\nCharging less money, we both lose, charging the same price, we both win. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t see how<br/>\nsomebody can justify competition between smiths as &#39;a good business<br/>\nstrategy&#39;. If they charge<br/>\nthe same price as me, they&#39;ll make more money than if they charged less!! I<br/>\nmake more money<br/>\nsince the price raise, it shouldn&#39;t be different for anyone else. As for new<br/>\nsmiths who<br/>\nhaven&#39;t mastered the trade yet, I have no idea where you&#39;re getting your<br/>\nidea from. Why would<br/>\nany reasonably intelligent person charge less for an item when they&#39;re in a<br/>\nhigher need for<br/>\nmoney? This is what you&#39;re telling me. Since they need money, they will<br/>\ncharge a lower price.<br/>\nUsually I put more logic into my arguments, but I can&#39;t even touch that<br/>\nbecause it simply does<br/>\nnot make sense. Newer smiths would want to charge higher prices so they can<br/>\nget more money so<br/>\nthey can spend more money on practicing their smithing! I&#39;m assuming that<br/>\nevery new smith on<br/>\nthis board is in favor of the price raise. If you&#39;re a new smith and you<br/>\naren&#39;t in favor of<br/>\nprice raising, frankly, you have your head shoved right up your ass. You&#39;re<br/>\nruining the market<br/>\nyou&#39;re just getting into by selling at lower prices, and you&#39;re making less<br/>\nmoney now and in<br/>\nthe long run. There is no justification for that, it&#39;s just plain idiotic.<br/>\n-Nick Emmerich<br/>\n a.k.a. Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Trade Council GM<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately Nick you&#39;ve displayed your total lack of knowledge of how price<br/>\naffects a supply and demand model.  If you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about,<br/>\nit&#39;s the most basic model of economics.  Anyone who doesn&#39;t, I would suggest<br/>\nyou go find out.  So that you understand what the logic is behind your<br/>\ncompetition driving their prices down in order to stimulate more demand for<br/>\ntheir armor over yours.  You might also want to read up on the concept of<br/>\nliquidity and how it affects one&#39;s business.  That might also explain the idea<br/>\nof selling at a discount to raise cash.  Artificially setting prices does not<br/>\nwork.  Any smith with half a brain will know that if there are four &quot;smiths&quot;<br/>\nin the same area that seem to be selling well at &lt;x&gt; price he/she can sell<br/>\nbetter than them at a discount.  We wouldn&#39;t be having this discussion if<br/>\nthere weren&#39;t people already doing this that are affecting the market.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCerran<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
