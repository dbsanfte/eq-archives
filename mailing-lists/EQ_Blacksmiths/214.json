On Rallos Zek this really isn&#39;t a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had my wizard character tweeked, he had the Skull of T, Dusty Blood<br/>\nStained gloves, runed totem staff, savant cap, and about 50 plat to help him<br/>\nout.  Well I made 7th level pretty easy, and all the sudden I was game for<br/>\nPKs, I had to much equipment on to bag it all when I was attacked by a 11th<br/>\nlevel Ranger (Faldor).<br/>\n<br/>\nLater when I thought I had gotten good and bagging stuff a new trick was<br/>\nentered... Blinding.  When blinded you can&#39;t see your inventory, so again I<br/>\nlost a high level item (thank you Relon)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I decide to put all my high level stuff where it belongs, on the high<br/>\nlevel character who deserves it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who tweaks on the PVP server risks being that much of a sweeter<br/>\ntarget, you will get murdered by someone 3-4 levels higher than you<br/>\neverytime.  This is pretty much until high teens, then it evens out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, hate tweaking? Goto a server where you can do something about it. Rallos<br/>\nZek, the only real server!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mark Guckeyson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mguckeyson@...\">mguckeyson@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 01, 1999 7:58 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Banks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mguckeyson@...\">mguckeyson@...</a> (Mark Guckeyson)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s crazy about level 5 in rubicite? It&#39;s odd, even frustrating, but<br/>\nso what? You haven&#39;t answered my question; merely given another example<br/>\nof it. Now the camping situation is something entirely different... and<br/>\nnot directly related to twinking. Do you think that if they weren&#39;t<br/>\ntwinking they&#39;d move on? I sure don&#39;t. I&#39;m willing to bet they&#39;d just<br/>\ncamp then sell the things. Actually, I&#39;d prefer to see someone camping<br/>\nfor the sole purpose of giving &#39;em away. After all, that just means that<br/>\nwhoever they&#39;re giving them to will have no reason to camp there. And<br/>\nhow do you determine who &#39;deserves&#39; the items? I think you&#39;re speaking<br/>\non a level of personal frustration... which is completely<br/>\nunderstandable, but difficult to defend logically. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, here&#39;s to few campers, great loot drops and wildly<br/>\nefficient xp.<br/>\nmark<br/>\n<br/>\nJason Coan wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; depends on what is being twinked.....a lvl 5 in full rubicite is crazy.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not only that, but people who twink out their other characters like this are<br/>\nthe people who FARM items.
