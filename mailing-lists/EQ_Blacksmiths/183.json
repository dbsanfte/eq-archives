I think if someone has another character <br/>\nthat has the skill to make cool stuff, or the level to hunt and get awsome <br/>\nstuff, they should be allowed to do what they want with it. So getting <br/>\ntwinked is part of the game, and it happens. Heck, the other day, one of the <br/>\nfew Level 50 characters, made a new character, had him going with level 49 <br/>\narmor, and really high level weapons and stuff. Looked awsome, he made level <br/>\n8 in an hour. Guess it is just part of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nKondor, Half Elf Paladin<br/>\n~Veeshan~</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
