He rewarded me with an unfinished blade mold.  I am curious<br/>\n&gt; if this is a working item and if so were can I find information on how to<br/>\n&gt; use it?  I had hoped that he would tell me what I would need to use this<br/>\n&gt; item&#8230;but he said nothing.  I have a smithing skill of 110 and<br/>\n&gt; climbing so I am willing to bet that I can make something with it if it is<br/>\n&gt; working but I really hate to waste the time and money trying to make<br/>\n&gt; something when I know I will lose the mold if I try to make anything!<br/>\n&gt; Please any hints or tips would be very very appreciated!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jay Viglione<br/>\n&gt; Belrin 14th Rank Cleric of Kaladim on the Karana Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
