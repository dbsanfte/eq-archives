This is mainly due to a character&#39;s inability to just travel anywhere in Norrath that they would like. On a care bear server, there&#39;s no problems with elves and humans visiting Innothule swamp, or dark elves and ogres stomping through Butcherblock. Yes, the cities are generally prohibited because of the guards, but the surrounding zone is pretty much free of any danger if you&#39;re careful. Therefore, for example, my ogre is free to shop for a better deal in West or East Freeport if he doesn&#39;t like the prices in Oggok and Grobb.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis all changes however when you can&#39;t freely travel because you might get your head handed to you by other players. Now my ogre can&#39;t just stroll around Norrath looking for a good deal. He&#39;s limited by his race and just finding a seller at all might be a major task. Once you find one, you take just about any deal you can get. And it&#39;s not just the dark races that endure this. The gnomes and elves of Faydwer are constantly at war with each other, so their travels and markets are limited as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also the interesting idea of repeat customers that is present on Rallos Zek that isn&#39;t on the blue servers. You see, on Rallos Zek, if you die to a PC they can actually loot you and take that nifty banded tunic you&#39;ve spent your hard earned plats on. Now what are you going to do? Well, of course, go back to that friendly smith you bought from before and buy another. This wouldn&#39;t happen on the blue servers because there&#39;s really no way for you to lose items unless you basically throw them into the dirt yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo while you all debate &quot;the market&quot; issues, just keep in the back of your mind that not all markets are the same and some server(s) (when the Race War server comes out you&#39;ll see the same thing I described above) actually have much more restricted markets than what you may be used to.<br/>\n<br/>\nKludge<br/>\nOgre Shaman and Master Smith<br/>\nRallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
