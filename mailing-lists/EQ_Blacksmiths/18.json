If you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; lucky you&#39;ll get <br/>\n&gt; a taarnished weapon which will be a couple delay<br/>\n&gt; points faster! Not <br/>\n&gt; bad. You might however fail and then loose both the<br/>\n&gt; wepon and the <br/>\n&gt; stone (lost anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
