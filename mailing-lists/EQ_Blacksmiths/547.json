The store<br/>\nprices on most fine steel weapons is from 30-40 pp in the shops, but you<br/>\ncan buy them by the tons on Karana for 4-8 pp each from players.  That<br/>\nwon&#39;t cover the costs of our molds, much less taking failures into<br/>\naccount.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people I know want magic weapons by the time they are 15th level so<br/>\nthey can hunt critters you need magic weapons for.  Prior to 15th level<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t really matter much what you use for a weapon.  I think the<br/>\nweapons are a nice idea, but Verant needs to rethink the component costs<br/>\nand get them in line with reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeatherwood</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
