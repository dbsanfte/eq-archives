Having a nice piece of magic armor that took <br/>\nforever to get disappear because it wore out. I don&#39;t like this idea, as it <br/>\nwould just make EQ more like Diablo and Ultima Online, which I hope they <br/>\nwould want to try and stay away from.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSome other RPG&#39;s I&#39;ve played made it so that common wear items wore quicker<br/>\nthan others as well as making rare quest items not wear very little or not at<br/>\nall since they are supposed to be considered priceless.  I think the idea of<br/>\nmaking items wear would be a great thing for the trade.  A shield and sword<br/>\nwould wear quicker than say boots or leggings.  This gives smiths an<br/>\noppurtunity to increase their skills with less cost if they want to work on<br/>\nrepairing and improving items.<br/>\n<br/>\nCerran<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
