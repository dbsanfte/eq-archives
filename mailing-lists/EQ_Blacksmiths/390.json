The argument is that Enchanters can<br/>\nMaster Jeweling better than any other class, and that gives them an edge on<br/>\nthe market. Also, their high intelligence gives them the advantage of<br/>\nlearning the other trade skills quickly. This combination yields a very<br/>\ndeadly merchant who can clean up an entire zone.

Why should a master<br/>\n&gt; talor be able to cook a complicated pie?  They shouldn&#39;t.  Certainly<br/>\n&gt; enchanters have an advantage when it comes to making magic items, but then<br/>\n&gt; again, shouldn&#39;t an enchanter have an advantage since their whole class is<br/>\n&gt; based upon enchantments?  And if you people are afraid that the day will<br/>\n&gt; come that you can&#39;t make magic armor because some enchanter is doing it,<br/>\n&gt; you are wrong.  You will still be able to, you might have to pay an<br/>\n&gt; enchanter to enchant some items for you, but you will still be able to<br/>\n&gt; make it.  And if you strongly feel that they will alow smiths to make<br/>\n&gt; magic armor, perhaps you should do a little adventuring and find some<br/>\n&gt; enchanters to become buddies with, perhaps he will do it for a nominal<br/>\n&gt; fee, or perhaps even free.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Paul Hill&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:paul@...\">paul@...</a>&gt; 7.13.99 9:58:10 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Paul Hill&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:paul@...\">paul@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am not trying to take anything away from enchanters, but why should all<br/>\n&gt; magical items be dependent on one single class?  The same discussion is<br/>\n&gt; going on in one of the tailoring lists.  If all magical items that can be<br/>\n&gt; made through all skills need an enchanter to do the enchanting, enchanters<br/>\n&gt; will be overworked.  Maybe enchanters need to be used in creating certain<br/>\n&gt; magical items for smiths, but by no means all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ] Creating Magical Armor and Weapons<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Nosferatu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nosferatu@...\">nosferatu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yeah forget what the book said and all that stuff.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  reread your FaQ and the &quot;official&quot; guide to EQ, magical weapons are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; supposed to require the help of a high level enchanter and a master<br/>\n&gt; &gt; smith, the one things we shouldn&#39;t need is to deal with a slimy little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dwarven smith or some such ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  as for &quot;would become the best class to make magical items.&quot; well I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should hope so, its what our class does! what next?
