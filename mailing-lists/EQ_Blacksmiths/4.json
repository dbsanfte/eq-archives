I was<br/>\nunder the impression that you do scalars till you max in that, then switch<br/>\nto skewers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is what I know on the process.  Something I have not heard anyone talk<br/>\nabout ever is your faction standing and how it effects the smithing process.<br/>\nBeing a wood elf currently I thought the best place to go to get ore would<br/>\nbe Steamfont.  But all the gnomes there are apprehensive of me which means<br/>\nbad prices.  The only other place I knew to go was N Freeport, so I made the<br/>\nlong journey and low and behold the humans regard me indifferently.  I ended<br/>\nup saving a Silver per ore and 2 copper per water.  Now on  its own that<br/>\ndoes sound like much, but thing of how much ore you have buy.  Every 100 ore<br/>\nyou buy you save a platinum.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that is my addition to the forum for now I guess.  Anyone know about what<br/>\nskill one can make studs reliably and what you need to make them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanx,<br/>\nAilenu<br/>\nRallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TSNFrodos@...\">TSNFrodos@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TSNFrodos@...\">TSNFrodos@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 13, 1999 4:24 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Skill gain<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TSNFrodos@...\">TSNFrodos@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nit seems that from skill 25 to skill 40 scalars are a good skill gain item, <br/>\nfrom 41 to prob mid 50&#39;s lantern casings seem to be providing better results<br/>\n<br/>\nthan skewers according to my source...<br/>\n<br/>\nalso rumors are floating around that a PC smith who refuses to divulge his <br/>\nsecret has discovered how to make Plate Armor of some kind<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n                      Free Games, Cash Prizes!<br/>\n            Gamesville - World&#39;s Biggest Game Show Site!<br/>\n                <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
