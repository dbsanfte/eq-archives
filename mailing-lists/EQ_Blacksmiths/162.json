I do like having a<br/>\nrough idea of a standard price that the majority as a whole charges.  If<br/>\nsomeone wants to go lower thats their right.  The problem I see is that EQ<br/>\nis totally unlike the Real world in Economics.  If I bring a piece of ring<br/>\nmail to an NPC vendor I get more money from them than I get for bringing<br/>\nthem a better quality piece of banded mail.  Thats just stupid on the AI<br/>\nside of the NPCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuposidly in the big update wthat Verant will be releasing in 6 to 9+<br/>\nmonths, they say that they will be doing a major revamp of trade skills to<br/>\nmake them so they don&#39;t suck.  I certainly hope better pricing for items is<br/>\nincluded in that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, untill that time comes, and it is a while away, its every players<br/>\nright to sell or give items away at what ever price they want to sell them<br/>\nfor.  Even if they want to take a loss on the product.  Perhapse they feel<br/>\nthat they can gain skill faster by selling their product for below cost<br/>\n(yet more than NPCs will give) as a suplement to their continued skill<br/>\ntraining.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the prices that were listed as being seen on the fennin ro server.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Banded Tunic : 20pp <br/>\n&gt;banded cloak : 20pp <br/>\n&gt;Sleeves: 10pp <br/>\n&gt;helm: 10-12pp <br/>\n&gt;boots: 10pp <br/>\n&gt;bracer: 8-10pp (seen go as low as 5pp a piece) <br/>\n&gt;legs: 10-12 <br/>\n&gt;mask: 10pp <br/>\n&gt;gorget: 8-10pp<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All I can say is look around some more.  I was online last night in<br/>\nFreeport and saw someone selling for the following<br/>\n<br/>\nBanded Tunic : 15pp <br/>\nbanded cloak : 15pp <br/>\nSleeves: 5pp <br/>\nhelm: 5pp <br/>\nboots: 4pp <br/>\nbracer: 4pp <br/>\nlegs: 5pp <br/>\nmask: 4pp <br/>\ngorget: 3pp<br/>\n<br/>\nI was stunned to say the least.  But, back to my original theme.  It is<br/>\ntheir right to sell at below cost prices.  There isn&#39;t much anyone can do<br/>\nto stop them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
