If it became widespread, it would once and for all<br/>\nshut the mouths of the assholes out there trying to tell you what you should<br/>\ncharge them for banded.  Lately, I&#39;ve been harassed by people saying (lying<br/>\nactually) that the going rate for banded is now 1pp per AC and getting real<br/>\nupset when I tell them no.  The other source of misinformation comes to<br/>\nthese people when they buy a banded gorget for 2-3pp from the wannabee<br/>\nsmiths that never get there skill much past 50 (you people on E Marr near<br/>\nFreeport know who I am talking about).  There are perhaps 5 of us really<br/>\nactive in smithing on E Marr and I know 2 of the other people for sure.<br/>\nI&#39;ll try to get in touch with them and see what they think.  The prices<br/>\nesposed on the site are about 1 to 2pp higher than I charge now (5pp per<br/>\nsheet needed to make an item, 15pp for cloaks).<br/>\n<br/>\nHaniel the ForgeMaster, E Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;    Date: 13 Oct 1999 16:23:00 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:madoc_ab_owain@...\">madoc_ab_owain@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Smiths of Norrath<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I saw the following site promoted on EQVault:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~sblack9/Blacksmiths.htm\">http://home.earthlink.net/~sblack9/Blacksmiths.htm</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The author makes many good points about keeping costs in line<br/>\n&gt; with the effort needed to attain the skill level.
