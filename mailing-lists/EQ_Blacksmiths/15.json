Also, you might<br/>\nwant to get about 4 large backpacks in your inventory. buy as many<br/>\nskewer molds as possilbe. now, just spend all you&#39;ve got trying to make<br/>\nskewers. they are very difficult to make so until your tivial, you might<br/>\nfind them damn near impossible to make. ** you gain skill failing too**<br/>\ningrediants for skewers:<br/>\n1 water flask<br/>\n1 skewer mold<br/>\n1 metal bit ( its been awhile...i&#39;m pretty sure its only 1)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n you may find this a bit expensive but let me give you an idea what a<br/>\nmaster smith is capable of making: Once you can make banded armor, (the<br/>\ntunic) go around offereing to trade banded for someones chain tunic. (<br/>\nalso, NPC&#39;s dont like player made crap so dont bother with them.) if you<br/>\ncan trade a banded tunic for a chain tunic...you just made yourself at<br/>\nleast 60 plat! ( banded is lighter, and with the same AC as chain)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Yizzlar, Wizard of Karana<br/>\nD Thoma wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; OK, basic question I know, but I have to ask anyway.

I guess the question is how do you make a<br/>\n&gt; sharpenting stone, or do you obtain it some place and then how do you<br/>\n&gt; apply it?  I found the guy I can purchase ore from and can get a flask<br/>\n&gt; of water.  I haven&#39;t even opened up blacksmithing yet (will this<br/>\n&gt; evening).  Can any one give me a little guidence on the best way to<br/>\n&gt; open this skill up other than trial and error.
