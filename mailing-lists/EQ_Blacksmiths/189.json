It would make trading and selling items with<br/>\nother people a lot easier.  What if you had a friend in Freeport that could<br/>\nsell you ore.  You could put the money in his account, and then they could<br/>\nput the item in your account.  The exchange would not actually take place<br/>\nuntil both people agreed on what was being transferred to their account.<br/>\nThis would further the player economy that Verant is trying to encourage.<br/>\nAnother idea would be a trading post where people could put items in and<br/>\npost a price.  If someone wanted to buy the item, they would pay the money<br/>\nand get the item.  The money would then go into the sellers bank account.<br/>\n<br/>\nTanaman<br/>\n12th Level Paladin<br/>\nAradani Guild<br/>\nVeeshan Server.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWith more than 17 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n...ONElist is THE place where the world talks! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
