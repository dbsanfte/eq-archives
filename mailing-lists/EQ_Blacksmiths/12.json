I would think a sharpening stone.  I guess the question is how do you make a sharpenting stone, or do you obtain it some place and then how do you apply it?  I found the guy I can purchase ore from and can get a flask of water.  I haven&#39;t even opened up blacksmithing yet (will this evening).  Can any one give me a little guidence on the best way to open this skill up other than trial and error.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
