You state, if not through words<br/>\n&gt; then through your stated intention of action, that you feel the free<br/>\n&gt; market should rule; that if one smith is charging five plat less than<br/>\n&gt; another for a particular item, that the free market will come into<br/>\n&gt; effect.  You state buyers are free to go where they wish with their<br/>\n&gt; purchasing power.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If he can make purchases from smiths and then resell his purchases at a<br/>\n&gt; higher price to buyers willing to pay the price, he&#39;s FOLLOWING THE<br/>\n&gt; FREE MARKET THEORY!  In fact, he would be what we&#39;re all familar with<br/>\n&gt; in real life, the &#39;middle man&#39;.  Here&#39;s an example:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joe the MiddleMan is a character of high enough level to make a decent<br/>\n&gt; amount per hour of adventuring.  He takes his plat and uses it to<br/>\n&gt; bankroll his purchasing of smiths&#39; wares in his area; making it his<br/>\n&gt; goal to try and buy as much as possible from the smiths.  He then<br/>\n&gt; responds to WTB auctions with the product he has &#39;warehoused&#39;, and<br/>\n&gt; marks it up accordingly.  In this fashion, he proceeds forward; buying<br/>\n&gt; product regularly off of smiths and holding it until a buyer appears.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, *anyone*, producer or middleman or<br/>\n&gt; end-user-reselling-to-another-end-user, *anyone*; who charges an<br/>\n&gt; excessive amount over the production cost and/or purchase price can<br/>\n&gt; have qualities such as greed ascribed to them, with a fair amount of<br/>\n&gt; truth.  But if one believes in the Free Market, then it&#39;s all fair.  If<br/>\n&gt; one believes in the Free Market, then any price charged will either be<br/>\n&gt; a successful price (meaning, buyers will pay it), or will not be a<br/>\n&gt; successful price (no buyers appear).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Further, how fair is it of *you* to *other smiths* to set your prices<br/>\n&gt; so low they have difficulty making any sort of money.  The master smith<br/>\n&gt; decides, &quot;hey, I have a skill of 150!  I can make product with a very<br/>\n&gt; low failure rate, meaning I don&#39;t have much waste.  I know, I&#39;ll sell<br/>\n&gt; it for five or ten plat over the materials cost!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s all fine and well for the master smiths; but the up and coming<br/>\n&gt; smiths are faced with an *even longer* road to tred, if they have any<br/>\n&gt; notions of being able to produce their product for profit.  If the<br/>\n&gt; master smiths are selling at a price designed to allow for only one<br/>\n&gt; *failure* over two or three or even more attempts, lesser smiths will<br/>\n&gt; be hard pressed to sell at a profit at similar pricing levels (because<br/>\n&gt; the lesser smith will have one *success* over two or three or even more<br/>\n&gt; attempts).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You say you&#39;re doing the community a favor by charging a low, low<br/>\n&gt; price; but what community are you serving, ultimately?  The buyer with<br/>\n&gt; money in hand gets a great deal as smiths begin to lower prices to<br/>\n&gt; match the lowest; but eventually smiths begin to throw up their hands<br/>\n&gt; and quit bothering, reducing the availability of armor.  So the<br/>\n&gt; community you&#39;re &#39;doing a favor&#39; is really only a few early buyers, and<br/>\n&gt; smiths that are happy to sell at near unprofitable levels; because the<br/>\n&gt; other smiths take it up the backside, and others interested in smithing<br/>\n&gt; are prevented from doing something they wanted to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, it is a Free Market, as you say.  But if you&#39;re going to ascribe<br/>\n&gt; notions of greed and negative emotion to &#39;middleman resellers&#39;, then<br/>\n&gt; you are not immune to similar labels against you from other smiths.<br/>\n&gt; How is what the middleman reseller does any more &#39;greedy&#39; than what the<br/>\n&gt; master smith does to the lesser smith?  I&#39;d say it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s all<br/>\n&gt; business, and business is war; but if you&#39;re going to start throwing<br/>\n&gt; negative labels around, you&#39;d better be sure you&#39;re not engaging in<br/>\n&gt; hypocracy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And finally, I&#39;ll point out (as others have attempted to do in the<br/>\n&gt; past), that real life businesses are engaged in the free market of our<br/>\n&gt; capitalistic society (which, despite some problems, works pretty well);<br/>\n&gt; but they also have amounts of sanity mixed in amid the incessent<br/>\n&gt; competitive pricing wars.  They don&#39;t charge prices designed to drive<br/>\n&gt; themselves out of business; not without actually going out of business<br/>\n&gt; sooner or later.  Real car manufacturers charge a price per car<br/>\n&gt; designed to enable them to recoup capital investment costs, raw<br/>\n&gt; materials costs, costs of training and labor, and the costs of<br/>\n&gt; unsellable product.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The difference between EQ smiths and real life businesses it that the<br/>\n&gt; CEO (PC smith) can&#39;t take his Board of Directors (group) out to the<br/>\n&gt; dungeons and kill stuff for a few hours to get more money with which to<br/>\n&gt; then go back out and sell product at a loss again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ===<br/>\n&gt; :D<br/>\n&gt;        Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n&gt; -No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&gt; &quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\n&gt; believe it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; First Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n&gt; _____________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Free instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
