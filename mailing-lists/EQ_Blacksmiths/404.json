Why shouldn&#39;t Enchaters get<br/>\nthe enchant ore spell?  It might make us a little more respected in the<br/>\ngame.  If you were able to get enchanted ore for free then you should<br/>\nhave to buy it from NPC merchants.  Why should you get as a looted item<br/>\nfrom a creature you kill?  We would have to buy the spell, you should<br/>\nhave to buy the ore.  As for your components idea, its the same thing<br/>\nwith jewelry, diffrent gems have diffrent effects, but the metal MUST<br/>\nbe enchanted to bring the properties from their dormant state.  An<br/>\nabiltity like this would make others see us as useful.  I have 2<br/>\ncharacters a DE Warrior and a DE Enchanter.  As the warrior I have no<br/>\nproblem with groping (get asked all the time).  When Im an enchanter I<br/>\nrarely get asked and when I do its by people who do not know what class<br/>\nI am, and then the offer is recinded when they figure out that I am an<br/>\nEnchanter.  I have had people people ask what class I was and then just<br/>\nstop talking to me when they found out what class I actully was<br/>\n(originally thaught I was a Cleric).  All of our buffing spells are<br/>\nalso used by other classes (Clerics, Shamans, Druids.) The only thing<br/>\nthat makes us unique is our ability to make things magical. All classes<br/>\nshould have something unique to only them. <br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors - superior strength<br/>\nWizards - superior magic<br/>\nMagicians - ability to use the power of the elements<br/>\nNecromancers - power over the undead<br/>\nDruids - power over nature<br/>\nRangers - best archers<br/>\nClerics - best healers<br/>\netc <br/>\n<br/>\nEnchanters should be the ones to enchant any item...<br/>\nbut of course this is IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nAshton - DE Enchanter Veeshan<br/>\nSargonnas - DE Warrior Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Paul Hill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:paul@...\">paul@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Paul Hill&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:paul@...\">paul@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here is my 2 cents worth on this subject.  I say no<br/>\n&gt; to enchanters being able<br/>\n&gt; to enchant ore for us.  I agree that the enchanters<br/>\n&gt; would become the best<br/>\n&gt; class to make magical items.  Let them do what they<br/>\n&gt; do best and make pretty<br/>\n&gt; jewelry for us to wear.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How can we make magical weapons and armor?  I like<br/>\n&gt; the idea of the mold.<br/>\n&gt; Also maybe introduce special ore that can be used to<br/>\n&gt; make enchanted weapons<br/>\n&gt; and armor.  Of course this ore would have to be<br/>\n&gt; dropped by creatures and not<br/>\n&gt; bought from NPC&#39;s.  Or maybe combine different<br/>\n&gt; ingredients into the ore like<br/>\n&gt; snakeskin for poison resistance, lightstones to give<br/>\n&gt; of light radius.  Maybe<br/>\n&gt; use a combination of all the above to make unique or<br/>\n&gt; lore items, like a<br/>\n&gt; special mold, magical ore, snakefang, and a<br/>\n&gt; lightstone to make a special<br/>\n&gt; sword that causes poison and gives off a lightradius<br/>\n&gt; of a lightstone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Karudil the Wandering Shaman of Ro<br/>\n&gt; 17th Level &lt;The Shadows&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred<br/>\n&gt; spirits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
