(i never trained as i\r<br/>\nam saving training points [do not ask me why i don&#39;t know]) then i started on files\r<br/>\nand studs and made 1 point after spending over 4p decided that was not even close to\r<br/>\nworth it and found Scaler molds and started with them  they advanced my skill at\r<br/>\nabout 1p each cause the finished molds you can sell back at a minimal profit\r<br/>\n(actually a loss i think because of the cost of pisces of ore) i stopped doing this\r<br/>\nat skill 41 and was happy with my results (only problem i had was the confusing\r<br/>\nmolds were visually identical  so i wasted a few in my long trek from 22 to 41) now\r<br/>\ni am making skewers and am loosing about 2p per point.  if this is the way it goes\r<br/>\noh well..  if not i would like a suggestion to what i should make  my skill is 44\r<br/>\nintelligence is 70 and charisma of 115.  i see a pattern here as skill points cost double what\r<br/>\nthey did before. but i am ok with it as i hunt wisps for cash then purchase my\r<br/>\nstuff to make.  is anything besides skewers going to raise my skill for less?  i\r<br/>\ndislike that i fail 90 plus percent of the time and never am able to sell the\r<br/>\nskewers back.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nhope this helps others with there smithing and i would like feedback on if anything\r<br/>\nwill advance me faster for less\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnakri\r<br/>\nMithanial Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
