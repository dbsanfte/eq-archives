(not the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-378342361\">I agree with the pricing problems of banded... I too have had to watch some<br/>\nsmiths selling banded armor at what is basically the cost of materials!<br/>\n(not the actual cost which would take into account the time and cost to<br/>\nlearn smithing)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From time to time I too have sold some cheap, but it is usually when I have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>made way too many of something and had it on me way too long... So, I need<br/>\nto get rid of some of the &#39;old&#39; stock...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think the real problem with the pricing comes not from overstock, but<br/>\nmostly from impatience.  People think that they should be able to /Auction<br/>\n1-2 times and that if nobody answers them, they want to go to the next zone<br/>\n(&quot;where there are more people&quot;) to try to sell there... Then, when nobody<br/>\nwants to buy right away, they start discounting it to the cost!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople, you have to understand something about selling... IT TAKES TIME!!!<br/>\nJust like the smithing itself does...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have ever been in a fine clothier or jewelery store, you might have<br/>\nnoticed that there isn&#39;t a whole lot of customers &#39;shopping&#39; around<br/>\ninside... They are there selling a quality product for a good profit... that<br/>\nis the way they make their money and keep their reputation of a fine<br/>\nproduct...<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch different then Sears or some warehouse store that is basing sales on<br/>\nHUGE Volumes because they (vendors) get huge discounts on the items<br/>\n(Materials cost)...<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, remember folks, this isn&#39;t Kmart!!  Don&#39;t try to sell at Kmart<br/>\nprices!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI often hang out at the banks or gates of a city selling my wares... and<br/>\nthere have been times when I sat there for 5 min or more without selling a<br/>\nthing, or even getting a query as to the prices and such!  This can seem<br/>\nveeeery frustrating... but look at it in a different light:<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I spent about an hour selling banded armor... and guess what?  I<br/>\nmade about 30 plat in profit (over costs of the materials, not actual<br/>\ncosts - I am about even now... hehe...)  How long would it take you to earn<br/>\n30 plat in, say, Unrest?  or NRo?  Probably at least twice as long, and only<br/>\nif you got some good loot off some mob!  If you can just relax and sit back<br/>\nand sell armor for a couple of hours, you can make about 30-50 plat per day<br/>\njust off of that... Then you won&#39;t mind going to those places where you earn<br/>\nlots of experience, but get no good loot... Because it will allready be in<br/>\nthe bank!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, remember... Keep those prices up there for a GOOD profit... and RELAX!!!<br/>\nTake the time needed to sell...  Just because there are only 14 people in<br/>\nNFP and nobody buys from you in the first 5 minutes doesn&#39;t mean that 5<br/>\nminutes later the SAME 14 people will be in that zone!  They change all the<br/>\ntime.... just look at the names... Oh, and if you see some that are there<br/>\nfor a long time, they are probably selling too!<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\nProud member of Platinum Sphere Guild - www.platinumsphere.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Scott Searle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sasearle@...\">sasearle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think this was directed at my comment about doing scalers, lanterns, and<br/>\n&gt; skewers till trivial, and by then you&#39;ll be popping out the banded.
