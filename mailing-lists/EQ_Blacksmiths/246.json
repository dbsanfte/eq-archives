I am doing smithing to make My OWN<br/>\narmor... Yes I also make some for others and sell it, but I have yet to<br/>\nbecome *rich* at it... In fact, I only have about 25 plat in the bank now...<br/>\nhehe... And I will need at least 60 plat to buy the Cleric 19th level spells<br/>\n(I am 18.5 now)... I also learned fishing for the same reason... to feed<br/>\nmyself... Now I have spells that make food and water, so I rarely practice<br/>\nit.  The same will probably happen with smithing once I get all the armor I<br/>\nneed...  But it is still a BUSINESS as well... a different way to make<br/>\nmoney... I even have a dwarf friend that travels back and forth to buy molds<br/>\n(small size) for me every once in a while... and HE makes a profit too!  No<br/>\nbiggy...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to carpal tunnel and other such &#39;typing & mousing&#39; related illnesses, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have a problem with them... I have been working with computers and<br/>\ntyping since 1978 and don&#39;t have problems at all!  I do proper stretching<br/>\nexercises and use proper posture, in addition, a gel filled wrist rest for<br/>\nboth keyboard and mouse (which I HIGHLY recommend - from FELLOWES Co.) keep<br/>\nthe pressure off also... So, no worries... hehe...<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patrick.r.baxter@...\">patrick.r.baxter@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just remember friend...
