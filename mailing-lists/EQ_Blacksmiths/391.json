Type A, which cares a great deal about stats and couldn&#39;t care a bit about looks.  And type B, which care more about looks than stats.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a 36th lvl DE warrior, and I&#39;m definitally a type B person.  As soon as I was able, I aquired a full set of blackend iron chainmail.  Which is lower AC than banded and A LOT heavier.  Sure the weight was annoying, but I looked much cooler than the person standing beside me in full banded.  After a couple weeks of wearing full blackend I discovered that small bronze was the same weight but more AC.  At which point I decided to get me a full set of bronze, but after seeing countless other people in full sets of bronze I decided I really didn&#39;t like that look.  But since I was at Unrest I decided to get some anyways.  What I ended up with was bronze helm, tunic, bracers, leggings, and still had my blackend arms, gloves, boots.  This turned out to be a nice looking combo, so I thought, and I had several other people stop and tell me the same.  Now many many levels later, I have Rubicite (red plate) helm, arms, bracers, leggings, and Charred (Black plate) tunic, boots, and gl!<br/>\n </span></blockquote>oves,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; weilding a black 2h sword.  Charred isn&#39;t as good as Rubicite, but the combo of the red and black plate looks extremely impressive.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To each their own, some people care more about an extra point of AC or an extra 2 points of wisdom more than they care how they look.  Some will sacrifice a couple AC and a couple points of an attribute so that they can have nicer looking equipment.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
