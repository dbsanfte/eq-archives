She increased VERY fast (while we were talking she went from<br/>\n&gt; level 1-15 in about 5 minutes!) and at the same time she was getting to<br/>\n&gt; keep<br/>\n&gt; the stones many times too...  (she had saved lots of old daggers)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She then started making bits and that was where I left her... She messaged<br/>\n&gt; me about 10 min later to tell me she was already over 21 now and was<br/>\n&gt; starting on files.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, you can increase very quickly now without having to put 20 points into<br/>\n&gt; it... If you don&#39;t have lots of extra points to spend that is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\n&gt; Proud member of Platinum Sphere Guild - www.platinumsphere.com<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
