I haven&#39;t reached the level where<br/>\nI can make banded yet, but when I get there, I want more than a few gold<br/>\nprofit for my wares.  I do have a further suggestion though.  When you see<br/>\npeople selling at a few gold above cost, bargain with them to get their<br/>\nprices lower, and buy out their stock.  Then, sell it yourself at the fixed<br/>\nprice.  So long as the person doesn&#39;t run fight back to the forge and make<br/>\nup a new suit of 3gp profit banded, you&#39;ve got yourself more supply without<br/>\nthe time and effort of making it and without and without the failure costs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy two cents, free of charge.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorthing, World of Rodnet Cife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
