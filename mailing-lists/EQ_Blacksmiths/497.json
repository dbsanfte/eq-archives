The best you can do is get ringmail or chain<br/>\nto go along with the banded.  I<br/>\n<br/>\nMark<br/>\n<br/>\nAmazing $14,000 Opportunity.

I have been doing smithing for what seems like<br/>\n&gt; forever and am way above master level. However, in all my time of smithing<br/>\n&gt; I have yet to see or find a mold for banded gloves though I&#39;ve had many<br/>\n&gt; MANY customers request them. Does anyone know if banded gloves even exist<br/>\n&gt; and if so are there molds to make them or must they be bought from<br/>\n&gt; merchant...and if there are molds to make them...where the heck are they<br/>\n&gt; hiding them?? lol Thanks much for any help. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Twilite<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
