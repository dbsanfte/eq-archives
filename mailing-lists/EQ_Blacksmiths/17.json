Dunno which","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1305396528\">There are two books for blacksmithing, one is &quot;blacksmith&quot; something <br/>\n(sorry, forgot) and the other is called &quot;weapons and armors&quot; (or very <br/>\nclose). Dunno which one explains it but you should buy them anyway, <br/>\nthey just cost over 1gp.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want the answer here, you have to buy sharpening stones (not <br/>\nsold everywhere) at 3 or 4cp a piece and then put the rusty weapon <br/>\nand a sharpening stone in a forge (available somewhere in most <br/>\ncities, ask around) and then hit combine. If you&#39;re lucky you&#39;ll get <br/>\na taarnished weapon which will be a couple delay points faster! Not <br/>\nbad. You might however fail and then loose both the wepon and the <br/>\nstone (lost anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me sharpening weapons became trivial at a smithing skill of 22. I <br/>\nthink it means that my smithing skill won&#39;t increase from it, dunno <br/>\nif it means I will never be more successful. I succeed most of the <br/>\ntime anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThormael<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;D Thoma&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:milamber@...\">milamber@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Sharpening ...

I would think a <br/>\nsharpening stone.  I guess the question is how do you make a <br/>\nsharpenting stone, or do you obtain it some place and then how do you <br/>\napply it?  I found the guy I can purchase ore from and can get a <br/>\nflask of water.  I haven&#39;t even opened up blacksmithing yet (will <br/>\nthis evening).  Can any one give me a little guidence on the best way <br/>\nto open this skill up other than trial and error.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for any help<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;David<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
