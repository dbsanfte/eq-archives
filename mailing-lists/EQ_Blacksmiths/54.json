WHO CARES!!! If he has an update <br/>\nto his web site and he wants to post it up here for people to check out, LET <br/>\nHIM!! It does deal with EQ and that should be all that really matters. I am <br/>\nseeing a bad trend on the message board and in game and it has a lot to do <br/>\nwith things like this. PEOPLE ARE GETTING RUDE. I had better run ins with <br/>\npkers on UO then with the people im seeing in EQ and the mailing list. <br/>\nPlease, Everyone just sit back, relax, and enjoy the info we recieve. I know <br/>\nas well as anyone else reading these that your probably at work, if you <br/>\nwerent you would be playing right now, so dont tell me you have something <br/>\nbetter to be doing then reading these posts. I&#39;m not saying post anything <br/>\nand everything, but this mailing list has done very well about staying on <br/>\nsubject, a couple of links to eq info sites is not going to kill anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nRant over, return to your normal blacksmithing news.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patrick.r.baxter@...\">patrick.r.baxter@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Web Update<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 4 May 1999 14:56:37 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patrick.r.baxter@...\">patrick.r.baxter@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I believe you should not send your personal wab page updates to this forum<br/>\n&gt;as it does apply to blacksmithing.  If you wish you can send us an update<br/>\n&gt;for when you change you blacksmithing guide.  Other than that I think that <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;can say that WE don&#39;t really have an interest in what happens to the rest <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;your web site.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There are other forums you could subscribe and send your web page updates<br/>\n&gt;to.

It&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt;the same if you mailed this list an update of your EQ page (imagine that<br/>\n&gt;you have one), everyone gets it, whether or not their interested.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Wanting to get back in touch with old friends?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Reunite through a ONElist community.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
