It does deal with EQ and that should be all that really matters. I am <br/>\nseeing a bad trend on the message board and in game and it has a lot to do <br/>\nwith things like this.

If you wish you can send us an update<br/>\n&gt;for when you change you blacksmithing guide.  Other than that I think that <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;can say that WE don&#39;t really have an interest in what happens to the rest <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;your web site.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There are other forums you could subscribe and send your web page updates<br/>\n&gt;to.
