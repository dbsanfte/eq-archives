Does this bronze armor have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; some &#39;special&#39; powers I don&#39;t know about yet?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yes, you have *utterly* missed the most important<br/>\n&gt;component of the entire EverQuest armor system.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Damage absorption.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;This is the number one problem with Rangers; they<br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t wear better than banded until they get their<br/>\n&gt;hands on the uber camped (and bugged, IMO; no plate<br/>\n&gt;should include magical plate too) magical plates like<br/>\n&gt;Rubicite or Green Splinted, etc...  Watch what happens<br/>\n&gt;in a group with, say, a Warrior, Paladin and Ranger at<br/>\n&gt;level 25.  The first two are probably in full plate,<br/>\n&gt;the Ranger&#39;s in full banded.  The ranger will take<br/>\n&gt;*considerably* more damage than the Warrior or<br/>\n&gt;Paladin; plate makes a much more efficient tank.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This what reinforced leather is for. AC of banded, absoprtion of plate<br/>\n(maybe better, gotta spearmint), and a HELL of a lot lighter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;This problem with Ranger armor is extenuated by<br/>\n&gt;Rangers&#39; use of Dual/Double; they stay high on the<br/>\n&gt;hate list and thus end up tanking a lot, even though<br/>\n&gt;they&#39;re least suited for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heh...  doesn&#39;t help that my taunt is capped and that I use it as often as<br/>\nkick.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Banded is nice to about 20; above that any serious<br/>\n&gt;tank needs to be in plate or they&#39;re going to have to<br/>\n&gt;lean more heavily on their clerics.  And the clerics<br/>\n&gt;will spend more time meditating, and run out of mana<br/>\n&gt;sooner in the fight.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yes, Bronze is heavy, but it&#39;s *worth* *it*.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Feh, buy reinforced from us tailors...  bring us the pelts and boning and<br/>\nwe&#39;ll probably do it free for the practice.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
