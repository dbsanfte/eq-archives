This is why you are getting that message.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Some areas are better than others for certain trade skills. For example, Surefall Glade is great for fletchers and bowyers. Qeynos is not very good to smiths. It&#39;s a long way to find ore and you&#39;ll have to decide whether or not it&#39;s worth the effort. As an example, I myself play an ogre in Oggok. We have some molds and one forge but no ore. (We also have no file or scalar molds which makes using the available smithing guides useless). The troll city of Grobb next door has ore, but no molds or a forge. So basically when I was learning to forge, I had to constantly run over to Grobb to buy ore, then go back to Oggok to use the forge. I still have to do that actually as I have to make all my own sheets for armor as no one sells them. It&#39;s a hassle but it&#39;s been worth it. My skill is now over 100 and I&#39;m one of the only master smiths in the Oggok/Grobb region, meaning I have the entire ogre/troll market practically to myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nKludge<br/>\nMaster Smith of Oggok<br/>\nRallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Johnson, Derek&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:djfam@...\">djfam@...</a>&gt; 07/10 8:33 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Johnson, Derek&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:djfam@...\">djfam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a novice Blacksmith having a little trouble.  I&#39;m in Qeynos region,<br/>\nwhere ore is tough to come by.  I bought some small chunks of ore from a<br/>\ntraveler, and I have been trying to make metal bits.  According to the book,<br/>\nI should use a ore chunk and some water, but each time I try, I get a<br/>\nmessage saying these quantities do not combine to produce anything.  So, my<br/>\nquestions are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. How is the proper way to make metal bits? (What ingredients exactly)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. With lack of ore in my area, is there a better way to get started in<br/>\nsmithing?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all.<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________<br/>\n<br/>\nKaldaan, Bristlebain server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Chris Lin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrislin@...\">chrislin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, July 09, 1999 12:40 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] how to start<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Chris Lin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrislin@...\">chrislin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) I would put in as many points as you can (Up till 21) to start.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;okay if you can only put in 14.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2) Next, make Metal Bits until you have a bunch.  If you didn&#39;t put 21<br/>\n&gt;points in at the beginning, you will reach 21 making Metal Bits.
