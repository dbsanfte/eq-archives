It<br/>\nends up evening out, but you&#39;ll eventually kill yourself by only selling the<br/>\ncheap stuff. A helm for 10pp? The lowest I ever sold one was 12 plat, and that<br/>\nwas before I raised my prices :) Then, a gorget for 7pp? After I raised my<br/>\nprices I sell them for 6 plat :) If a consumer gets smart, you will only be<br/>\nselling your inexpensive items (bracers, helms, sleeves, belt, boots, leggings)<br/>\nand the expensive items (cloaks, gorgets) won&#39;t sell at all. The rest will be<br/>\ninbetween. The pricing list I&#39;ve been using (I posted it earlier, check the<br/>\narchives) has worked excessively well. The closer together all of our prices<br/>\nare, the more willing the consumers will be to buy for higher prices. If they<br/>\nsee a lot of varying prices, they&#39;ll want to shop around first (which is a<br/>\ndisaster if the cheap-o smith zones in while they&#39;re shopping). Let&#39;s try to get<br/>\nas close to a specific price list as possible so we can avoid any possible<br/>\nproblems. I enjoy hearing &quot;yeah, that&#39;s a good price, I&#39;ll take it&quot; :)<br/>\n-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Trade Council GM<br/>\n<br/>\nDennis Meek wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Dennis Meek&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dmeek01@...\">dmeek01@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night I began selling banded at my new prices.  They are as follows:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gorgets 7pp<br/>\n&gt; Bracers 5pp each<br/>\n&gt; Masks 10pp<br/>\n&gt; Helms 10pp<br/>\n&gt; Sleeves 10pp<br/>\n&gt; Mantles 12pp<br/>\n&gt; Mail 17pp<br/>\n&gt; Cloak 20pp<br/>\n&gt; Belt 8pp<br/>\n&gt; Boots 8pp<br/>\n&gt; Leggings 15pp<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I started with 9pp on my body.  After 1 and a half hours, I had 215pp on me.<br/>\n&gt; I had about 3 people decline my services.  The rest bought them.  I also<br/>\n&gt; sell full sets at 130pp, and I sold 1 full set (of small armor, which was a<br/>\n&gt; pain for me.  being in gfay, and having to run to BB to get the molds was a<br/>\n&gt; bother).  Anyhow, I believe if we stick to these prices, which still seem to<br/>\n&gt; sell well, we will do good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Haijar the Mage Blacksmith<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
