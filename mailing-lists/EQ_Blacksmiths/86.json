(i never trained as i<br/>\nam saving training points [dont ask me why i don&#39;t know]) then i started on files<br/>\nand studs and made 1 point after spending over 4p decided that wasnot even close to<br/>\nworth it and found scaler molds and started with them  they advanced my skill at<br/>\nabout 1p each cause the finshed molds you can sell back at a minimual profit<br/>\n(acutally a loss i think because of the cost of pisces of ore) i stoped doing this<br/>\nat skill 41 and was happy with my results (only problem i had was the confusing<br/>\nmolds were visualy identical  so i wasted a few in my long trek from 22 to 41) now<br/>\ni am making skewers and am loseing about 2p per point.  if this is the way it goes<br/>\noh well..  if not i would like a suggestion to what i should make  my skill is 44<br/>\nint is 70 and cha of 115.  i see a pattern here as skill points cost double what<br/>\nthey did before. but i am alright with it as i hunt wisps for cash then purchase my<br/>\nstuff to make.  is anything besides skewers going to raise my skill for less?  i<br/>\ndislike that i fail 90plus percent of the time and never am able to sell the<br/>\nskewers back.<br/>\n<br/>\nhope this helps others with there smithing and i would like feedback on if anyting<br/>\nwill advanse me faster for less<br/>\n<br/>\nAnakri<br/>\nMithanial Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
