I say no to enchanters being able<br/>\nto enchant ore for us.  I agree that the enchanters would become the best<br/>\nclass to make magical items.  Let them do what they do best and make pretty<br/>\njewelry for us to wear.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can we make magical weapons and armor?  I like the idea of the mold.<br/>\nAlso maybe introduce special ore that can be used to make enchanted weapons<br/>\nand armor.  Of course this ore would have to be dropped by creatures and not<br/>\nbought from NPC&#39;s.  Or maybe combine different ingredients into the ore like<br/>\nsnakeskin for poison resistance, lightstones to give of light radius.  Maybe<br/>\nuse a combination of all the above to make unique or lore items, like a<br/>\nspecial mold, magical ore, snakefang, and a lightstone to make a special<br/>\nsword that causes poison and gives off a lightradius of a lightstone.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarudil the Wandering Shaman of Ro<br/>\n17th Level &lt;The Shadows&gt;<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
