This new system will allow players to download new optional files<br/>\nsuch as zones, music, character animations, etc. After the EverQuest<br/>\nexecutable is run (everquest.exe), and once the download is complete, you<br/>\nwill receive an option to patch the &quot;optional&quot; files. If &quot;Yes&quot; is selected,<br/>\nthe optional files will begin downloading, if &quot;No&quot; is selected, you will<br/>\nbypass the optional files and continue. Please note that this optional patch<br/>\nrequestor will appear every time everquest.exe is run. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to the optional patch program, the following changes and<br/>\nenhancements have been made: <br/>\n<br/>\n*Optional Patch* <br/>\n<br/>\nA new zone, The Temple of Solusek Ro, is now available via the optional<br/>\npatch. <br/>\n<br/>\n*General Enhancements* <br/>\n<br/>\n- Experience and looting rights are now awarded for group aggregate damage.<br/>\nThis is now true for ALL servers. We still consider this change in &#39;TEST&#39;<br/>\nand will conduct a poll as to whether it positively addresses the kill<br/>\nstealing situation in approximately 2 weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n- As mentioned on Saturday, Rubicite armor will no longer spawn. The new<br/>\nclass specific quests to obtain the new armor are now in for each class that<br/>\ncould wear Rubicite.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Journeyman&#39;s Boots will no longer spawn where they did but rather are the<br/>\nproducts of a quest.<br/>\n<br/>\n- To address trade fraud (players removing items/money immediately prior to<br/>\ntrading to deceive the other player), items/money may only be removed by<br/>\nclicking on the &quot;Cancel&quot; button. - When receiving a text message from either<br/>\nan NPC or PC speaking in a language other than &quot;Common Tongue&quot;, if the<br/>\nuser&#39;s language skill is high enough, the language being spoken will be<br/>\nnoted preceding the text.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The fishing pole will now appear in the player&#39;s hand whenever the fishing<br/>\nskill is used.<br/>\n<br/>\n- A number of quests were both added and enhanced throughout the zones. <br/>\n<br/>\n*Trade Skills* <br/>\n<br/>\nA number of new items have been added to Blacksmithing. <br/>\n<br/>\n*Spell Enhancements* <br/>\n<br/>\n- Some of the Items that Magicians Summon with their spells have been made<br/>\nbetter / had their effects increased.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Fufil&#39;s Curtailing Chant, Tuyen&#39;s Chant of Flame and Tuyen&#39;s Chant of<br/>\nFrost (BARD) have all had their effects slightly increased.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Burnout Series (Magicians) has had the negative HP component reduced<br/>\n(improvement) and the stat buff increased (improvement). Because of this,<br/>\nthe spells are no longer permanent - they now have a 15 minute duration.<br/>\nBurnout III has also had its casting cost reduced.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Illusion: Werewolf attack speed component now works as intended.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Insipid Weakness (Enchanter) will research as intended. <br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdblevins@...\">jdblevins@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdblevins@...\">jdblevins@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 13, 1999 2:32 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] New Patch<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdblevins@...\">jdblevins@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSo what improvements have come with the new patch?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
