I&#39;ve seen many of the prices you listed, but those<br/>\nwould be the best end prices...<br/>\n<br/>\nBracers for 8-10 is accurate.<br/>\nTunic and cloak for 20 is accurate<br/>\nI haven&#39;t seen legs go for less than 20pp.<br/>\nMost everything else I&#39;ve bought for 12-15pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, It&#39;s been a week and a half and I don&#39;t check out prices anymore. I<br/>\nbought all my stuff from the people who had it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQUESTION: I&#39;ve heard Medium banded is lighter than Large banded. I&#39;m a<br/>\nbarbarian warrior, and someone told me I needed large so I bought some large<br/>\nstuff (bracers, helm, mantle, boots, etc). Then I got a medium tunic and<br/>\nlegs. Still need to get a cloak and mask. <br/>\n<br/>\nProblem is, I can&#39;t carry squat now... With the basic essentials (armor, two<br/>\nmino axes, and 3 backpacks plus food), I&#39;m at like 80/119 weight. Wondering<br/>\nif I changed my large banded over to medium banded if it would be worth it.<br/>\nAnd, can Barbarians wear anything large and anything medium? Someone told me<br/>\nthey can wear SOME medium stuff, but all large worked. Seems stupid to me,<br/>\nbut I&#39;m not sure anymore...<br/>\n<br/>\n-Zantaer, Fennin Ro, 15th Circle Barbarian Warrior<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Nick [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brutalny@...\">brutalny@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 14, 1999 8:25 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Digest Number 21<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Nick&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brutalny@...\">brutalny@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI play on fennin-ro and these are the accepted prices for banded.  they seem<br/>\na bit low..<br/>\n<br/>\nBanded Tunic : 20pp<br/>\nbanded cloak : 20pp<br/>\nSleeves: 10pp<br/>\nhelm: 10-12pp<br/>\nboots: 10pp<br/>\nbracer: 8-10pp (seen go as low as 5pp a piece)<br/>\nlegs: 10-12<br/>\nmask: 10pp<br/>\ngorget: 8-10pp<br/>\n<br/>\nThese prices seem sort of low.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 14, 1999 7:47 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Digest Number 21<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are 2 messages in this issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Topics in today&#39;s digest:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       1.
