AC on a twinked character, even if he/she is<br/>\nwearing banded, is still not very high until you get to a higher level.  You<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be able to fight red MOBs very much, because even though you have a<br/>\nFS Longsword, your 1h slashing skill might only be 30.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Lemac Justerian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, May 28, 1999 12:35 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Banks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Lemac Justerian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joint bank accounts wouldn&#39;t be that great of an idea... For the<br/>\n&gt; reasons you<br/>\n&gt; stated, it would, but it would be abused too easily to help<br/>\n&gt; *twink* another<br/>\n&gt; character up...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think you would start seeing even more (there already are some) lower<br/>\n&gt; level characters wearing the best armor and having the best weapons that<br/>\n&gt; money can buy because they are &#39;sharing&#39; those items with the &#39;other&#39;<br/>\n&gt; player...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In other words:  I have a level 18 character that has all banded<br/>\n&gt; armor and a<br/>\n&gt; Combine Staff - I put it into the bank, log out, log back on as a NEW<br/>\n&gt; character that is level 1... he puts on the armor, grabs the staff, and in<br/>\n&gt; just a few hours he is up to level 10!  Not worrying much about getting<br/>\n&gt; killed off because his AC is around 300 or so!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No, no sharing of accounts...  BUT, I WOULD like to see some way<br/>\n&gt; for GUILDS<br/>\n&gt; to have a &#39;seperate&#39; account (for officers) to make it easier to<br/>\n&gt; handle the<br/>\n&gt; income and outlay of the guilds... </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
