The<br/>\n&gt; pieces of ore that you need to make &quot;metal bits&quot; which are the most basic<br/>\n&gt; thing that you can make, are not availiable on your side of the<br/>\n&gt; continient.<br/>\n&gt; With an intelligence of 60, you will take longer to gain skill points, but<br/>\n&gt; it is still possible.  I still find it strange that ore is not availiable<br/>\n&gt; in Halas, a town and a race of people that would be perfect Blacksmiths.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tanaman-&lt;Aradani&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 14th Lev.
