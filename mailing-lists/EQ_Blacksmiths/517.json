I can make all items with &gt; only a few failures.  (I <br/>\nhate legs though, seem to fail a lot.)

Mine is 138 and pitifully <br/>\nlow, but passable with loads of coin behind it. Get more INT to see more <br/>\nincreases.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m thinking that getting skill from making armor is broke.

I haven&#39;t seen much of a market for banded any longer with the <br/>\nloads of twinked characters and spare cash laying around for bronze, plate, <br/>\nand rubi, so stopped practicing for skill completely. The ONLY raises I get <br/>\nnow are from making, or not making, armor pieces.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
