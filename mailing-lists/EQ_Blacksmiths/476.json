I have mastered \r<br/>\nfletching (because I&#39;m a ranger and it seemed\r<br/>\nlike a good idea at the time) and found it to be\r<br/>\nnon-profitable.  I mastered pottery (because I&#39;m\r<br/>\ngreedy) but they&#39;ve made it so it&#39;s not profitable.\r<br/>\nBecause of my pottery history, money is not too big\r<br/>\nof an issue, so I&#39;m looking for another trade to\r<br/>\nmaster - that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHow much does it cost to develop smithing to the \r<br/>\npoint that it becomes profitable?  I realize I need \r<br/>\na definition here, but let me just ask for a feeling\r<br/>\nof the skill level where the cash inflow is positive, \r<br/>\nand an estimate of the cash outlay to get there.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI am a wood-elf (and perpetually encumberred) that\r<br/>\nis normally in Kelethin.  I know (think) Steamfont\r<br/>\nis the closest place for ore and that&#39;s a long run - \r<br/>\nshould I relocate?  Ak-Anon is out.  Those guys really\r<br/>\nhate me there.  How about Kaladim?  Somewhere else?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI&#39;ve read most of the guides on the web, and some\r<br/>\nof them seem out of date. Can you suggest any?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThanks in advance.  BTW can I interest you in a good\r<br/>\nbow, or perhaps a pot . . . maybe a mixing bowl?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
