Oh well.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any how.  I have a feeling blacksmithing is broke.  My skill is 126 or<br/>\n </span></blockquote>somewhere near there.  I can make all items with only a few failures.

I didn&#39;t have any<br/>\nproblem getting skill up to 126 making all the standard stuff, then I start<br/>\nmaking armor, and I get nothing.  My Int is about average 86.  I&#39;m thinking<br/>\nthat getting skill from making armor is broke.  Has anyone else seen this?<br/>\nAlso, I know some armor items are trivial, and I know I&#39;m not making a ton<br/>\nof trivial armor items.  I&#39;ve made plenty of legs, mails, cloaks, mantles,<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve gotten skill from making armor several times.  The thing that is hard<br/>\nto notice about doing armor is it seems like you are doing a LOT of armor,<br/>\nand not getting anything, but generally, now that I think about it, I&#39;d do<br/>\nhundreds of skewers at a time when I was raising my skill.  Either way it<br/>\nisn&#39;t just smithing that is broken this way.  It took me 750 combines to get<br/>\n5 fletching points this week.  That&#39;s at 3pp per combine.  These were<br/>\narrows, BTW.  That&#39;s 3750 arrows, and supposedly the chances of getting a<br/>\nskill up were doubled since they went to 5 arrows a try.  Argh, that&#39;s a lot<br/>\nof clicking.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Wolfey<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any insight you folks can provide would be great.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, why aren&#39;t there banded gloves.
