I remember an earlier attempt at a trade guild on E&#39;ci that also promoted &quot;price fixing&quot; but eventually failed. This site at least allows you to &quot;find&quot; smiths on your server and place orders via email, so no more hunting around the various zones trying to drum up business. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you, as fellow smiths, think of the idea? If you aren&#39;t already on board, will you sign up? <br/>\n<br/>\nThis list has been dead too long, let&#39;s stir up some discussion!<br/>\n<br/>\nAraman of E&#39;ci<br/>\n17th level Paladin<br/>\nSkill 142 smith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
