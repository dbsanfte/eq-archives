It&#39;s called CRAFTED though??  Who but a smith<br/>\nwould be crafting armor??<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the ability to make weapons, if we cannot make Fine Steel quality<br/>\nweapons, where do they come from? Is there a mysterious NPC smith that makes<br/>\nand sells all the FS items to the creatures?  How pray tell do they get them<br/>\nthen?<br/>\n<br/>\nSmithing needs DRASTIC changes and enhancements to make it more realistic<br/>\n(making pots should be EASIER than making Banded armor, not harder) as well<br/>\nas more profitable for the time it takes...<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\nProud member of Platinum Sphere Guild - www.platinumsphere.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:madoc_ab_owain@...\">madoc_ab_owain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 13, 1999 9:26 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Smithing changes with latest patch<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:madoc_ab_owain@...\">madoc_ab_owain@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard weapon smithing is now implemented! Unfortunately they&#39;re not<br/>\nquite as good as FS, so hopefully they&#39;ll be either enchantable or a<br/>\nstepping-stone to a high enough skill level to make plate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another item, not exactly a change but of interest to those smiths who are<br/>\npaladins like myself: the new Temple zone supposedly has a Paladin who will<br/>\ngive you or give you quests for molds to make special armor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t get on to see what other changes may have taken place to smithing,<br/>\nbut check your vendors, check your books, and post back to the list what you<br/>\nfind.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Araman of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; 17th level Paladin<br/>\n&gt; Skill 142 Smith<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
