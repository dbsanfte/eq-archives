This is in<br/>\naddition and separate from the AC the armor confers. <br/>\nThere is a *huge* difference in damage taken between<br/>\nplate (steel or bronze) and banded.  You can test this<br/>\nyourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake a full suit of banded, and a full suit of plate<br/>\n(bronze or steel).  Go fight a few blues and note how<br/>\nmuch you lose in the fights.  Then switch over to<br/>\nplate and fight a few more of the same types of blues<br/>\nas before; you&#39;ll lose considerably less.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the number one problem with Rangers; they<br/>\ncan&#39;t wear better than banded until they get their<br/>\nhands on the uber camped (and bugged, IMO; no plate<br/>\nshould include magical plate too) magical plates like<br/>\nRubicite or Green Splinted, etc...  Watch what happens<br/>\nin a group with, say, a Warrior, Paladin and Ranger at<br/>\nlevel 25.  The first two are probably in full plate,<br/>\nthe Ranger&#39;s in full banded.  The ranger will take<br/>\n*considerably* more damage than the Warrior or<br/>\nPaladin; plate makes a much more efficient tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis problem with Ranger armor is extenuated by<br/>\nRangers&#39; use of Dual/Double; they stay high on the<br/>\nhate list and thus end up tanking a lot, even though<br/>\nthey&#39;re least suited for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBanded is nice to about 20; above that any serious<br/>\ntank needs to be in plate or they&#39;re going to have to<br/>\nlean more heavily on their clerics.  And the clerics<br/>\nwill spend more time meditating, and run out of mana<br/>\nsooner in the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Bronze is heavy, but it&#39;s *worth* *it*.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
