I have made a sample of<br/>\neach and auctioned them on E Marr.  I got 3 or 4 inquiries from other smiths<br/>\non how to make them and not a single inquiry about the price, etc. from<br/>\nanyone else.  The weapons cost roughly 5pp to make, BTW.  I have heard the<br/>\nstats are not as good as fine steel weapons.  Can someone who knows the fine<br/>\nsteel weapon stats, post them for comparison?  These are the new items:<br/>\n<br/>\nForged Morning Star, 1HB, 8 damage, 38 delay<br/>\n1 water + 1 metal sheet + Hilt Mold + Spiked Ball Mold<br/>\n<br/>\nForged 2-handed Sword, 2HS, 12dmg, 44 delay<br/>\n1 water + 1 metal sheet + Hilt Mold + Pommel Mold + Heavy Steel Blade Mold<br/>\n<br/>\nForged Bastard Sword, 1HS, 7 damage, 33 delay<br/>\n1 water + 1 metal sheet + Hilt Mold + Pommel Mold + Dual Edge Blade Mold<br/>\n<br/>\nThe molds can be found off a vendor in Butcher Block, right outside of<br/>\nKaladmim.  Mold prices with amiable faction and high charisma:<br/>\n<br/>\nDual Edge Blade Mold   1p 9g 1s 8c<br/>\nHeavy Steel Blade Mold 3p 8g 3s 6c<br/>\nSpiked Ball Mold       2p 5g 5s 7c<br/>\nHilt Mold                 6g 3s 9c<br/>\nPommel Mold               6g 3s 9c<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas on what we should charge for these?  Anyone know where else the<br/>\nmolds can be bought or any new items we can make?  I&#39;d particularly like<br/>\nconfirmation on the Paladin in Solusek Ro that gives a quest for armor<br/>\nmolds.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaniel the ForgeMaster, E Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
