I do like having a<br/>\n&gt; rough idea of a standard price that the majority as a whole charges.  If<br/>\n&gt; someone wants to go lower thats their right.  The problem I see is that EQ<br/>\n&gt; is totally unlike the Real world in Economics.  If I bring a piece of ring<br/>\n&gt; mail to an NPC vendor I get more money from them than I get for bringing<br/>\n&gt; them a better quality piece of banded mail.  Thats just stupid on the AI<br/>\n&gt; side of the NPCs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Suposidly in the big update wthat Verant will be releasing in 6 to 9+<br/>\n&gt; months, they say that they will be doing a major revamp of trade skills to<br/>\n&gt; make them so they don&#39;t suck.  I certainly hope better pricing<br/>\n&gt; for items is<br/>\n&gt; included in that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However, untill that time comes, and it is a while away, its every players<br/>\n&gt; right to sell or give items away at what ever price they want to sell them<br/>\n&gt; for.  Even if they want to take a loss on the product.  Perhapse they feel<br/>\n&gt; that they can gain skill faster by selling their product for below cost<br/>\n&gt; (yet more than NPCs will give) as a suplement to their continued skill<br/>\n&gt; training.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for the prices that were listed as being seen on the fennin ro server.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Banded Tunic : 20pp<br/>\n&gt; &gt;banded cloak : 20pp<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sleeves: 10pp<br/>\n&gt; &gt;helm: 10-12pp<br/>\n&gt; &gt;boots: 10pp<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bracer: 8-10pp (seen go as low as 5pp a piece)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;legs: 10-12<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mask: 10pp<br/>\n&gt; &gt;gorget: 8-10pp<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All I can say is look around some more.  I was online last night in<br/>\n&gt; Freeport and saw someone selling for the following<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Banded Tunic : 15pp<br/>\n&gt; banded cloak : 15pp<br/>\n&gt; Sleeves: 5pp<br/>\n&gt; helm: 5pp<br/>\n&gt; boots: 4pp<br/>\n&gt; bracer: 4pp<br/>\n&gt; legs: 5pp<br/>\n&gt; mask: 4pp<br/>\n&gt; gorget: 3pp<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was stunned to say the least.  But, back to my original theme.  It is<br/>\n&gt; their right to sell at below cost prices.  There isn&#39;t much anyone can do<br/>\n&gt; to stop them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\n&gt; Master of Recruiting<br/>\n&gt; www.bck.org<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
