Before the <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; recent change to the skills I would buy a batch <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; of raw materials from the fletching supplier and <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; tediously make arrows, frequently getting a <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; message that my skill had gone up.  I sold the <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; completed arrows back to a merchant in my guild <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; to minimize the cost of gaining skill.  (The <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; market for arrows isn&#39;t so hot.)  In my most <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; recent training exercise I went from a skill of <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 69 to a skill of 74.  The outlay, after buying <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; raw materials and selling the completed arrows, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; was about 2.5 pp, or about 5g/skill point.  All <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; this was before the patch.  Note that this cost <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; is very different than using the skill points <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; you get when you gain levels, I&#39;m not talking <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; about that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fletchers complained bitterly about having to <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; make single arrows.  Verant responded with a <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; solution that sells components in batches of <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; five and produces arrows in batches of five.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem is, the skill level is based on the <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; number of times the fletcher hits the &quot;combine&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; key.  The tediousness of making arrows has been <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; fixed, but the price of gaining skill points has <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; been multiplied by a factor of five.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My question to you smiths is, do you know how <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; much it costs to increase your skill?  In the <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; range from 60 to 80 is it 5g/point, or <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2.5pp/point?  Or is it far different than that?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I appreciate your patience in reading through <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; this.
