In fact, I had level one done in less than an<br/>\nhour..<br/>\n<br/>\nI was up to level 5 within the next 3-4 hours of play time (over a couple of<br/>\ndays for me) with a little help from another cleric friend (Thanks Devrill!)<br/>\nwho gave me a couple of pieces of patchwork armor (she was learning<br/>\ntailoring) basically at cost and or free... I gave her pelts (and still do!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo your point of not being able to take on toughies in the first level is<br/>\ntrue, yes, but you also don&#39;t NEED to really... But you won&#39;t DIE because<br/>\nsome Orc Pawn starts slamming on you either... your armor is likely to help<br/>\nyou get back to the guards a LITTLE easier if it&#39;s banded or plate!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, when it comes time to start hunting Centurions and the like, you will<br/>\nbe up on the game again, with higher AC and such...  That&#39;s all.. If you<br/>\nlike that, then fine...  I found myself going out and getting killed ON<br/>\nPURPOSE so that I could have more food and water without having to pay for<br/>\nit!  Guess if I could have just gotten say, 100 plat right off the bat I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have to waste time killing myself... hehe... But it was good<br/>\npractice on looting my corpse.... hehe...<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: David Burkhart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:davidb@...\">davidb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 28, 1999 9:59 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Banks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:davidb@...\">davidb@...</a> (David Burkhart)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yeah they took care of twinking to a certain degree. Granted having Banded<br/>\n&gt; Mail at 1st level would certainly help you. However at 1st level your<br/>\n&gt; Offense and Defense are low, as is your weapon skill.

AC on a twinked character, even if he/she is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wearing banded, is still not very high until you get to a higher<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level.  You<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t be able to fight red MOBs very much, because even though<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; FS Longsword, your 1h slashing skill might only be 30.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Lemac Justerian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, May 28, 1999 12:35 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Banks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Lemac Justerian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Joint bank accounts wouldn&#39;t be that great of an idea...
