Saw this last night...<br/>\n14th level Druid comes into East Karana and auctions SOW for 2pp... Heh... I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t played a Druid, but I believe they get SOW at 14th, right? I play a<br/>\nshaman, and we get it at 9th. I&#39;ve given away 20 times more SOWs (to people<br/>\nI didn&#39;t know, this does NOT include my own party memebers) than I&#39;ve gotten<br/>\npaid for... *shrug* And I&#39;ve never been paid 2pp for a freakin SOW...sheesh.<br/>\n1pp, quite a number of times, but never more than that. Never. (15th level<br/>\nnow, so I&#39;ve cast that spell as many times as a 15th level wizard has cast<br/>\nhis lightning bolt...heh).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dex Man<br/>\nLeod, Fennin Ro, Sterling Order of Knights<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Nick Emmerich [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seorin@...\">seorin@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 12, 1999 3:29 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [Re: [Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Somethin seems wrong (long<br/>\nresponse)]]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Nick Emmerich &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seorin@...\">seorin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, the RL name thing isn&#39;t meant to offend you. People call me<br/>\n&#39;Nick&#39; all the time,<br/>\nbe it in e-mail, message boards, or whatever. It&#39;s my name, I don&#39;t really<br/>\ncare. If you do,<br/>\nhowever, I&#39;ll respect that and stick to Cerran. I&#39;m not out to offend you,<br/>\nI&#39;m just trying to<br/>\nprove a point<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not especially known for banded on my server, I&#39;m at an equal platform<br/>\nwith everyone else.<br/>\nIf I can sell at a price, other people can too. So, when I sell at higher<br/>\nprices, that proves<br/>\nto other smiths that they can as well. Instead of undermining my price and<br/>\nmaking less money<br/>\nper sale, they can go to a different zone and sell for the same price I am.<br/>\nSales are out<br/>\nthere, and if the market isn&#39;t oversaturated then they always will be. Why<br/>\nget less money and<br/>\ncontribute to market oversaturation at the same time? Both are negative<br/>\nthings to a smith.<br/>\nCharging less money, we both lose, charging the same price, we both win. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t see how<br/>\nsomebody can justify competition between smiths as &#39;a good business<br/>\nstrategy&#39;. If they charge<br/>\nthe same price as me, they&#39;ll make more money than if they charged less!! I<br/>\nmake more money<br/>\nsince the price raise, it shouldn&#39;t be different for anyone else. As for new<br/>\nsmiths who<br/>\nhaven&#39;t mastered the trade yet, I have no idea where you&#39;re getting your<br/>\nidea from. Why would<br/>\nany reasonably intelligent person charge less for an item when they&#39;re in a<br/>\nhigher need for<br/>\nmoney? This is what you&#39;re telling me. Since they need money, they will<br/>\ncharge a lower price.<br/>\nUsually I put more logic into my arguments, but I can&#39;t even touch that<br/>\nbecause it simply does<br/>\nnot make sense. Newer smiths would want to charge higher prices so they can<br/>\nget more money so<br/>\nthey can spend more money on practicing their smithing! I&#39;m assuming that<br/>\nevery new smith on<br/>\nthis board is in favor of the price raise. If you&#39;re a new smith and you<br/>\naren&#39;t in favor of<br/>\nprice raising, frankly, you have your head shoved right up your ass. You&#39;re<br/>\nruining the market<br/>\nyou&#39;re just getting into by selling at lower prices, and you&#39;re making less<br/>\nmoney now and in<br/>\nthe long run. There is no justification for that, it&#39;s just plain idiotic.<br/>\n-Nick Emmerich<br/>\n a.k.a.
