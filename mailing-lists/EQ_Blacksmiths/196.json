Some people are so into *making level xx* that I<br/>\nthink they lose site of the rest of the game...  I have several friends and<br/>\naquaintenances (god I know I spelled that wrong!) that are higher levels<br/>\nthan I am because they play more... But I get more of a charge out of<br/>\nhelping the LOWER level people to &#39;level up&#39; than leveling up myself...<br/>\nSome see this too as &#39;twinking&#39;, but I am doing it for someone else, not<br/>\nmyself (or any of my characters).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t do this by giving them the best armor for free (hey, it cost me<br/>\nmoney to make/buy/find) or weapons or any other &#39;loot&#39;... I do help by<br/>\nhealing them when they need it (gee, I do that with the higher levels too)<br/>\nand letting them pull mobs that are too low for exp for me, but are still<br/>\nblue or white to them...  Sometimes, I won&#39;t even group with them, but<br/>\nrather just stand by for a heal if they need it (they always do)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in MY game of EQ there is no &#39;twinking&#39; and I hope never really will<br/>\nbe...<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all, the object is to QUEST and ADVENTURE, not just &quot;LEVEL UP&quot; on a<br/>\ndaily basis...<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Getting twinked is part of the game.
