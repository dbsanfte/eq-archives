What I&#39;d like to do is collect the stats on all pieces of bronze (total AC and total weight) and have that handy to give to the whiners who say &quot;But I can buy bronze for 2pp per AC, and it&#39;s better!&quot;. FACT: Banded is lighter. FACT: Banded is generally only one point of AC less per piece than bronze. I love watching these high elves loaded with full bronze trying to keep up with their guides. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaniel: Got a loc for those mold vendors?  Also, have you checked the dwarf vendors in ButcherBlock just outside of Kelethin for molds? I always figured the woman should have some, as she&#39;s standing next to a NPC forge :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI checked the banded and misc. smithing vendors in Kelethin to see if they had any new molds, none detected. <br/>\n<br/>\nAraman of E&#39;ci<br/>\n17th level Paladin<br/>\nSkill 142 smith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
