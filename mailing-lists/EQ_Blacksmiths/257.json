First, someone<br/>\ntold me that for ANY trade skill, intelligence is of utmost important.  Now<br/>\nI may be strong, but I am pretty simple minded (a 60 intelligence).  Should<br/>\nI even start being a blacksmith with such low smarts?  How much will being<br/>\n&#39;dumb&#39; affect me when trying to increase my skill?  I thought about making<br/>\nanother character that would be my blacksmith, but I really don&#39;t want to do<br/>\nthe &#39;mule&#39; thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngarth, Warrior of the 16th Tier<br/>\n&quot;Periissem ni periisem&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tThursday, June 10, 1999 2:45 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Starting smithing...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I disagree. 21 is when bits become trivial. Then make scalers until 41,<br/>\n&gt; that <br/>\n&gt; is when they become trivial. Then after that make skewers until 115. That<br/>\n&gt; is <br/>\n&gt; when they become trivial. I tried making banded before this, and everyone <br/>\n&gt; always wanted other banded items. Everyone has gorgets and bracers, they<br/>\n&gt; are <br/>\n&gt; the cheapest thing out there. Once 115 make all banded. You will fail a<br/>\n&gt; lot <br/>\n&gt; on some things. Sometimes you will have a bad spout. Failing 10 times in a<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; row at 121 skill in Legs really sucks. once your that high, just keep<br/>\n&gt; making <br/>\n&gt; banded. and your skill will raise.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Danthin, Master Smith (123)<br/>\n&gt; ~Veeshan~<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
