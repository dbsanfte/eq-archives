I thought that was what this was for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI heard that there was a quest where you are given a mold and you have to<br/>\nsmith a weapon.  Has anyone else heard about this and what smithing skill<br/>\nshould we be at before we waste the mold by not being skillfull enough ?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, does the studded leather armor have any magic properties or just a<br/>\nbetter armor class.  Could we get an Enchanter to enchant the metal studs<br/>\nto do this ?<br/>\n<br/>\nTanaman<br/>\nLev. 13 Paladin.<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
