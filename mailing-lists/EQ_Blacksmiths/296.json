With banded being sooo much lighter in weight, and (nowadays)<br/>\na heck of a lot cheaper, it seems silly to me they want to pay so much more<br/>\nfor the bronze when most pieces only give 1AC better!<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I missing something?  Does this bronze armor have some &#39;special&#39; powers I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know about yet?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome have said they like it because it &#39;Looks Kewl!&#39; for them... I think it<br/>\nlooks like crap myself... all dull and flat looking... Looks more rusty than<br/>\na rusty sword!  I like the nice clean look banded gives (especially on Human<br/>\nFemales! Yum, Yum!) when worn.<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\nProud member of Platinum Sphere Guild - www.platinumsphere.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 08, 1999 9:27 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] [EQ_SMITHS] Somethin seems wrong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; scalers are trivial at 41, no way you be popping out the banded at that<br/>\n&gt; level. Oh ya, no one wants banded anymore, so it is really pointless to<br/>\ntry<br/>\n&gt; and sell anything. In what I have seen on my server, most people want<br/>\nbronze<br/>\n&gt; armor. You can still sell, but a lot more diffucult to do so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KNICKS@...\">KNICKS@...</a>.
