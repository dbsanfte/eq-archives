I know<br/>\nthat during the beta the Mudites in the Beholder zone sometimes gave ore as<br/>\ntreasure.  I was fighting them in a group of level 14+, and they were<br/>\nhitting us HARD.  I&#39;d say get to about 16th to fight in Beholder and even<br/>\nthen watch out for the Gorge Minotaurs and evil eyes.<br/>\nThe Mudite&#39;s can blind and they hit pretty hard.  They have Elders that can<br/>\ncast spells, and I have never seen them running around by themselves.<br/>\nAlways were in a group when I encountered them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;   Date: 29 Apr 1999 16:35:40 -0000<br/>\n&gt;   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g.koenig@...\">g.koenig@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Ore in the world<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi,<br/>\n&gt;I know that we can fid Ore in Streamfort and Freeport.<br/>\n&gt;But do you know somewhere else we can find some?<br/>\n&gt;bye </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
