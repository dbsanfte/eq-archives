Don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; take never literally, though. We need to raise prices on banded. 7 for gorgets,<br/>\n&gt; 8 for bracers, 11 for masks, 13 for helmets, 12 for sleeves, 12 for mantle, 20<br/>\n&gt; for mail, 20 for cloak, 12 for belt, 19 for leggings, 11 for boots. These prices<br/>\n&gt; give us significant profit on 100% success and help even out the profits for<br/>\n&gt; when we fail. If ALL of us sell at these prices and stick to them (don&#39;t let<br/>\n&gt; them drop you more than a plat), then the &#39;low priced&#39; banded sellers will be<br/>\n&gt; very scarce indeed. Then you can see the &#39;wait an hour&#39; frustration on the<br/>\n&gt; buyers end. If someone auctions they are willing to pay 5 plat for a banded<br/>\n&gt; bracer for over an hour, they&#39;ll be frustrated enough to give up and pay the<br/>\n&gt; damn 8 plat. If we have a set price that majority follows, then we will still<br/>\n&gt; sell. While the discount smith might sell 10 gorgets at 2 and a half plat profit<br/>\n&gt; each, we&#39;ll sell at LEAST 5 gorgets in the same amount of time for 5 and a half<br/>\n&gt; plat profit each. They might be making 25 plat, but we&#39;re making 27.5 and have<br/>\n&gt; less chances for a failure :) If we group together and work as one group of<br/>\n&gt; dedicated smiths, we can only win. If we become bitter enemies over who has the<br/>\n&gt; lowest price, the price war will just destroy us all. We will ruin the value of<br/>\n&gt; smithing. NO MORE DISCOUNTS!!! :)<br/>\n&gt; -Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n&gt;  Trade Council GM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry.. are you a moron?  Your plan won&#39;t work for shit.  You keep<br/>\nyour prices at what they are..  i will sell cheaper.. everyone will keep<br/>\ncoming to me.. i&#39;ll get plenty of practice and my smithing will continue<br/>\nto raise.. and I&#39;ll make all the money while you sit all alone with your<br/>\noverpriced shit.  People do NOT pay for failures.  They pay for the<br/>\nproduct.  As a smith, you are supposed to supply people with a product. <br/>\nYou don&#39;t supply them with your failures.  Smithing is a profitable<br/>\nbusiness.. yes.  But it&#39;s the greedy assholes like you who try to make<br/>\nother people pay for your lack of skill who ruin the trade.  Pay for<br/>\nyour own mistakes.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
