Why should a master talor be able to cook a complicated pie?  They shouldn&#39;t.  Certainly enchanters have an advantage when it comes to making magic items, but then again, shouldn&#39;t an enchanter have an advantage since their whole class is based upon enchantments?  And if you people are afraid that the day will come that you can&#39;t make magic armor because some enchanter is doing it, you are wrong.  You will still be able to, you might have to pay an enchanter to enchant some items for you, but you will still be able to make it.  And if you strongly feel that they will alow smiths to make magic armor, perhaps you should do a little adventuring and find some enchanters to become buddies with, perhaps he will do it for a nominal fee, or perhaps even free.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Paul Hill&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:paul@...\">paul@...</a>&gt; 7.13.99 9:58:10 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Paul Hill&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:paul@...\">paul@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not trying to take anything away from enchanters, but why should all<br/>\nmagical items be dependent on one single class?  The same discussion is<br/>\ngoing on in one of the tailoring lists.  If all magical items that can be<br/>\nmade through all skills need an enchanter to do the enchanting, enchanters<br/>\nwill be overworked.
