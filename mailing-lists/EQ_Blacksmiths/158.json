Another prime example, very late in p4, I sold my BBC to a vendor for a whopping 3pp, when I tried to buy it back, the vendor wanted almost 4000pp.  So anyways, the GM told me that the majority of items in the game were ment to be sold to players, not vendors, so vendors will only give you a fraction of what items are worth, then turn around and sell them at grosly exadurated prices.  Which seems all fine and dandy since that really promotes the supply and demand type market they are shooting for.  HOWEVER, when it comes to trade items, I really think they should make exceptions since nobody under about lvl 20 can really afford to take up a trade skill, and at which point you make better cash killing monsters than selling your wares. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents :)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt; John Danielson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:clu@...\">clu@...</a>&gt;  5/20  1:13a &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nFrom: John Danielson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:clu@...\">clu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 17:36 5/19/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;John Cuyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johncuyle@...\">johncuyle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Prices on banded should be at least as much as chain.

All<br/>\n&gt;Verant needs to do to fix this problem is make merchants pay a reasonable<br/>\n&gt;amount for smithed goods, then we wouldn&#39;t see stupid things like people<br/>\n&gt;selling at or below cost.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hell no.  I don&#39;t agree with fixing, and I sure as hell don&#39;t agree with<br/>\nanyone being told ever to sell at any price.  If they feel like taking a<br/>\nloss, they can role-play it like they&#39;re helping the general good of the<br/>\npopulace or whatever they feel like, because it is, after all, their money<br/>\nand their items.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat aside, I agree 100% that the shops should pay more for hand-made<br/>\nitems.  If not that they&#39;re &quot;special&quot;. then that they&#39;re as good as the<br/>\nones you can buy in the shops, and should at least re-sell at 75% of the<br/>\nprice you&#39;d get for their equivalant item.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nAre you hogging all the fun?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nFriends tell friends about ONElist!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
