It&#39;s odd, even frustrating, but<br/>\nso what? You haven&#39;t answered my question; merely given another example<br/>\nof it. Now the camping situation is something entirely different... and<br/>\nnot directly related to twinking. Do you think that if they weren&#39;t<br/>\ntwinking they&#39;d move on? I sure don&#39;t. I&#39;m willing to bet they&#39;d just<br/>\ncamp then sell the things. Actually, I&#39;d prefer to see someone camping<br/>\nfor the sole purpose of giving &#39;em away. After all, that just means that<br/>\nwhoever they&#39;re giving them to will have no reason to camp there. And<br/>\nhow do you determine who &#39;deserves&#39; the items? I think you&#39;re speaking<br/>\non a level of personal frustration... which is completely<br/>\nunderstandable, but difficult to defend logically. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, here&#39;s to few campers, great loot drops and wildly<br/>\nefficient xp.<br/>\nmark<br/>\n<br/>\nJason Coan wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; depends on what is being twinked.....a lvl 5 in full rubicite is crazy.  Not only that, but people who twink out their other characters like this are the people who FARM items.  They camp until they get their item, which I don&#39;t have a problem with, then they continue to camp camp camp camp camp to get crap for their guild buddies and for their lower lvl characters, depriving the people who DESERVE the items the chance to get them....and thats where I have a problem with twinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\nJoin a new list today.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
