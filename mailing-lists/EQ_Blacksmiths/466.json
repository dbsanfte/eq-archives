Yer talkign about<br/>\n&gt; thousands of items...many thousands. And yer talking about touching every<br/>\n&gt; single one of them... Sure, you can write a script (depending on the<br/>\n&gt; database being used, you should be able to), but touching every single item<br/>\n&gt; in the game is DANGEROUS.

Please, nobody argue with this, it would defeat the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; entire purpose of this post. I won&#39;t even respond if this gets flamed,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I would hope nobody else will either. Anyway, here goes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I just thought it&#39;d be a neat idea to have &#39;name tags&#39; on trade-made<br/>\n&gt; &gt; products. Maybe not for cooking or brewing, as those items aren&#39;t meant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to last, but on generally anything else. Something in the status window<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that says, &quot;made by: name&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t that just be neat? Buy a banded<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tunic 6 months from now with one of your secondary characters and say,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;hey! I made that!!&quot; I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s even possible for them to code<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this, nor do I expect or really even want them to. I just think it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kinda neat, that&#39;s all :) Too much coding for the effect it would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; produce (or should I say lack of effect =P). Just, as I said, neat :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Trade Council GM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get $20 off all MotherNature brand products!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/mothernature1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/mothernature1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Books, music, auctions, and more.
