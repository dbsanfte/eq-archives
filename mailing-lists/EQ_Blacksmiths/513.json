Say four stacks worth, as you<br/>\nwill fail a few times making these.  Make some scalers with the bits, then<br/>\nmake more bits.  Once bits become trivial, make a full backpack or two of<br/>\nthem.  This is major carpal tunnel syndrom time, but it&#39;s necessary to do.<br/>\nKeep making scalers until trivial.  Move on to lanterns, they cost a little<br/>\nmore, but you fail a lot less, and don&#39;t lose much money.  Scalers are last<br/>\nuntil your skill hits 115, then you can try pots to 125(?) then sewing kits.<br/>\nAlthough I found that pots and sewing kits don&#39;t give you very much skill.<br/>\nOnce you hit 125 in skill just sell all armor.<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Tue, 7 Sep 1999 19:45:44    nicolas.miskic wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nicolas.miskic@...\">nicolas.miskic@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Greeting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;i play a barbarian shaman lvl 15<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my int is 61 and my char 88<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;i have recently started blacksmithing and there is my 2 cent.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;first i have only put 3 point in my skill.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have started by sharpening weapon and surprise ! unlike its<br/>\n&gt; &gt;always say in the different guide you find about this skill : when<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you lacked the skill you don t loose both the weapon and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sharpening stone but only the sharpening stone.  cost of one<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sharpening stone 3 copper :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;may be its recent patch that have change that ?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I also know that it will take you many time to get enought rusty<br/>\n&gt; &gt;weapon to increase your skill.
