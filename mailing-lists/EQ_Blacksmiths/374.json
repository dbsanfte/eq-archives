I think it would be great to get some kick ass armor<br/>\nlike that!  But then....it wouldn&#39;t be fair.  Think about it.  Enchanters<br/>\nalready are the best at Jewelry Making.  It is (pretty much) damn foolish<br/>\nfor anyone BUT an enchanter to learn the skill.  Unless, of course, you also<br/>\nplay a high lvl enchanter who you use for your own enchanted metals.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy giving enchanters the ability to enchant sheet metal, thereby creating<br/>\nmagical armor, this make&#39;s enchanters have far too much control over the<br/>\nmarket.  Jewelry making and Blacksmithing all would depend upon enchanters?<br/>\nNo, I&#39;d rather not have that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, Magical Armor should be something special.  IMHO, I believe there<br/>\nshould be quests for Blacksmith&#39;s, where the reward might be a mold that<br/>\ncomes enchanted with some random quality.  This would allow EVERYone the<br/>\nopportunity to do this, and make us not be dependant upon enchanters.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you all think?<br/>\n<br/>\nHaijar the Mage Blacksmith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
