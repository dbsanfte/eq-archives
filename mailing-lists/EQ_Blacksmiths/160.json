If a &#39;client&#39; came<br/>\nup to you with all the raw materials and said &quot;Make me a tunic and I will<br/>\ngive you 5pp.&quot; Would you tell them Okay without mentioning that it *might<br/>\nnot* work and they would be out the 5pp for the raw materials?  Or, if you<br/>\nfailed with their materials would you then use your own until you were able<br/>\nto produce one for them?  This would be a bad thing for you if it did... But<br/>\nif that is your thinking, then the heck with ME learning to smith, I am<br/>\ngoing to start ordering stuff from you all the time!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, please put me down for two tunics (I will sell one for 20pp and<br/>\nmine will only cost 10), or better yet, make it FOUR!  I can get a discount<br/>\nfor multiples, right??  hehe... (let&#39;s see now, if I get them for 13pp each<br/>\nx4=52 plat... I can sell 3 x20=60... I get mine free AND make 8 plat! All<br/>\nwithout smithing!! Kewl!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course if I order more, you should give me an even BIGGER discount<br/>\nbecause, after all, I am HELPING you to learn to be a better smith, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
