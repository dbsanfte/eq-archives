I say no to enchanters being able<br/>\n&gt; to enchant ore for us.  I agree that the enchanters would become the best<br/>\n&gt; class to make magical items.  Let them do what they do best and make pretty<br/>\n&gt; jewelry for us to wear.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How can we make magical weapons and armor?  I like the idea of the mold.<br/>\n&gt; Also maybe introduce special ore that can be used to make enchanted weapons<br/>\n&gt; and armor.  Of course this ore would have to be dropped by creatures and not<br/>\n&gt; bought from NPC&#39;s.  Or maybe combine different ingredients into the ore like<br/>\n&gt; snakeskin for poison resistance, lightstones to give of light radius.  Maybe<br/>\n&gt; use a combination of all the above to make unique or lore items, like a<br/>\n&gt; special mold, magical ore, snakefang, and a lightstone to make a special<br/>\n&gt; sword that causes poison and gives off a lightradius of a lightstone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Karudil the Wandering Shaman of Ro<br/>\n&gt; 17th Level &lt;The Shadows&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
