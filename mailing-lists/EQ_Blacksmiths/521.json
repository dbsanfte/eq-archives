Last night, I scoured all 3 Freeport zones<br/>\nlooking for needle molds (everything else was right by the forge in E.<br/>\nFreeport) with no luck (piss me off).  Anyone know where is a good place to<br/>\nforge sewing kits with all the materials near the forge?  Also, what is the<br/>\ntypical success rate for Leggings, Tunics, and Cloaks with a skill of 135 vs<br/>\n122?  Hehe, I&#39;d like to actually make some money with my smithing skill<br/>\ninstead of breaking even on each piece I sell (I sell each piece for 5pp per<br/>\nsheet needed to make).</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
