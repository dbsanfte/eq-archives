Everyone in Freeport was ooc ing for banded.  In Quenos, I was the<br/>\nonly one at the time trying to get it.  I did not know that Shamans and<br/>\nNecromancers had a spell that moved items.  I have never heard of anyone<br/>\nbartering for this.  A Shaman could make a lot of money by moving ore to<br/>\npeople in Quenos.  I still cannot believe that ore can not be found in<br/>\nQuenos and yet they have Ironforge Estate.  What is he using to make his<br/>\nweapons ?    I understand that the closest place to get ore is from a NPC<br/>\nin front of a mine entrance near Highpass.  Can anyone verify this ?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank You,<br/>\n<br/>\nTanaman</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
