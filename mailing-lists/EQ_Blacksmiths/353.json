Im not saying make the prices so<br/>\noutrages that they cannot afford to buy from us, but at least make it a<br/>\nprofitable trade once again. Yes, there will be the rouge who comes thru<br/>\nonce a month and sells for a lesser price, but, thats once a month. I feel<br/>\nthat for all of our well being we need to band ( no pun intended ) together<br/>\nto make this work. If you want to sell, or even give away the occasional<br/>\npiece for cost or slightly above cost at least keep it under the table. I do<br/>\nthis once in awhile to build a good reputation with my clients. It works<br/>\nbelieve me. Sell Bob a set of bracers for 8pp because he&#39;s down on his luck<br/>\nor whatever reason you choose, but tell Bob to keep it to himself, but tell<br/>\nhim what you would like in return is for him to advertise for you, and in<br/>\nreturn you will give him better pricing, this works!!! I was in gfay and did<br/>\nthis, sent out my auction, next thing I knew &quot;Bob&quot; was shouting about what a<br/>\ngreat smith and guy I was on my prices etc etc, I made 5 complete suits of<br/>\nbanded within about 90 mins, made 600pp, and in return I gave &quot;Bob&quot; his<br/>\ntunic at cost.<br/>\n Maybe Im wrong here to some of you and I dont need your flames etc. All I<br/>\nam saying is that,the prices I sell for are about what we are talking about,<br/>\nit just takes word of mouth to get the forge a hoppin and WE are making  a<br/>\nprofit again.<br/>\nEoroth Mishakal<br/>\nCazic Thule Server<br/>\nSmith of the 145th lvl<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Bryan G Hardy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhardy@...\">bhardy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, July 11, 1999 5:55 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Sheet Metal<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Bryan G Hardy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhardy@...\">bhardy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Aye, we can make sheets... same way as detailed in the book.
