People like you who<br/>\ninsist on flooding the market with cheap banded are<br/>\ndoing a few things.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) you&#39;re driving smiths away; it&#39;s not worth their<br/>\ntime anymore.  But I know, you think this is good<br/>\nbecause you get more business.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) you &#39;teach&#39; the buyers they don&#39;t have to pay more<br/>\nthan rock-bottom prices.  But again, you think this is<br/>\ngood because you get more business, because you&#39;re<br/>\nhappy making a few gold over cost.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) you flood the market, so everyone has banded, so<br/>\nvery soon, the server has all the banded it needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the one I laugh about, because you&#39;re too<br/>\nshortsighted to understand it.  When everyone has<br/>\nbanded, you log on and auction you&#39;re selling it, and<br/>\neveryone shrugs because they already have what they<br/>\nwant.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun in the pit you&#39;ve dug for yourself.
