Before the<br/>\nrecent change to the skills I would buy a batch<br/>\nof raw materials from the fletching supplier and<br/>\ntediously make arrows, frequently getting a<br/>\nmessage that my skill had gone up.  I sold the<br/>\ncompleted arrows back to a merchant in my guild<br/>\nto minimize the cost of gaining skill.  (The<br/>\nmarket for arrows isn&#39;t so hot.)  In my most<br/>\nrecent training exercise I went from a skill of<br/>\n69 to a skill of 74.  The outlay, after buying<br/>\nraw materials and selling the completed arrows,<br/>\nwas about 2.5 pp, or about 5g/skill point.  All<br/>\nthis was before the patch.  Note that this cost<br/>\nis very different than using the skill points<br/>\nyou get when you gain levels, I&#39;m not talking<br/>\nabout that.<br/>\n<br/>\nFletchers complained bitterly about having to<br/>\nmake single arrows.  Verant responded with a<br/>\nsolution that sells components in batches of<br/>\nfive and produces arrows in batches of five.<br/>\nThe problem is, the skill level is based on the<br/>\nnumber of times the fletcher hits the &quot;combine&quot;<br/>\nkey.  The tediousness of making arrows has been<br/>\nfixed, but the price of gaining skill points has<br/>\nbeen multiplied by a factor of five.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question to you smiths is, do you know how<br/>\nmuch it costs to increase your skill?  In the<br/>\nrange from 60 to 80 is it 5g/point, or<br/>\n2.5pp/point?  Or is it far different than that?<br/>\nI appreciate your patience in reading through<br/>\nthis.  Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nRamalama - 12.95 Level Wood-Elf Ranger on Mithanial Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nMake your voice heard!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nSign up for the ONElist Weekly Survey.
