Ore, free?  What the hell are you thinking?  First,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s free if you kill a creature that drops it (not worth time).  Second,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ore isn&#39;t needed for making armor.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No, but it CAN be used for making metal sheets... but your correct, not<br/>\n&gt; worth it really (those blocks of ore are 15lbs!!  Try carrying a few of<br/>\n&gt; those and running through a dangerous area!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now, as for molds.  Since you used a tunic in your letter, I will use it<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; well.  A Tunic molds costs over 1pp.  It requires 3 metal sheets, all of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which also cost over 1pp.  Then the water, at a palsy 1sp or so.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I sell my tunics at 17pp.  I consider this a fair price, and many else<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; agreed with me (as I have sold many many many for this price).  How can<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; say it&#39;s a bit steep?  It is MY choice to sell for the price that I see<br/>\n&gt; fit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It is not up to you to decide how much I feel my time is worth.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Might be a &#39;fair&#39; price to the BUYER, yes... but not necessarily fair to the<br/>\n&gt; rest of the smiths... You still forget about the failures and practice you<br/>\n&gt; have to put in... Don&#39;t just base it all on the AMOUNT either... Take into<br/>\n&gt; consideration all the TIME it took you to learn to smith... those endless<br/>\n&gt; hours and hours at the hot forge making those little metal bits and<br/>\n&gt; skewers... the traveling around you had to do to get all the items and head<br/>\n&gt; back to the forge... the waiting in LINE at the forge (In some cases) ...<br/>\n&gt; So, remember the TIME as well as your cost in platinum that it took you to<br/>\n&gt; learn it!  After all, you could have made lots of money out killing mobs AND<br/>\n&gt; gotten experience at the same time!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I try to sell my Tunics for 20 (when I can make them) and I WISH I could<br/>\n&gt; sell them for more!  They are easily worth twice that!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; On any account, there will (for the most part) always be a flow, if not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; constant, for banded.  Seeing as how new people begin the game, or old<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people create new characters (that are not always twinked mind you), we<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have other&#39;s to sell to.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh wrong again my friend... what happens when there is too much of a &#39;good&#39;<br/>\n&gt; thing?  And believe me, there will be... When I first logged on in this game<br/>\n&gt; (about 2 weeks after it &#39;officially&#39; started), people were selling banded<br/>\n&gt; armor for TWICE the prices they are now (and more!) and I would see messages<br/>\n&gt; all the time of &quot;Banded Wanted&quot;...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now look at it from the economic side of things... Now there is PLENTY of<br/>\n&gt; banded armor out there from all the smiths, and prices are MUCH cheaper!<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t think that other newbies are not starting up as new smiths too!  They<br/>\n&gt; are!  and it is a little bit easier for them too because of the &#39;limited&#39;<br/>\n&gt; fixes Verant has done for the beginning smith...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But what happens when you have 1500 players on a server (at any one time)<br/>\n&gt; and there are 1000 sets of banded armor and another 500 sets of Bronze<br/>\n&gt; Plate, Rubicite and other kinds?  Oh and least we forget that those 1000<br/>\n&gt; that don&#39;t have those &#39;higher&#39; forms of armor WILL be getting them also<br/>\n&gt; sooner or later... What happens is that banded armor becomes as worthless as<br/>\n&gt; Studded and Reinforced already is...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Look at the prices for Bronze plate already!  People selling PLATE ARMOR for<br/>\n&gt; less than 20plat per piece?  That is rediculous!  but hey, they can because<br/>\n&gt; it is soooo easy to get nowadays... So many smiths have to sell their stuff<br/>\n&gt; cheaper too... otherwise the buyers just want to wait until they can get the<br/>\n&gt; Plate... They know the prices are coming down too...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, it will end up like Studded and Reinforced armor has... Useless.... It<br/>\n&gt; is only a matter of time...  Of course by then we should all be making<br/>\n&gt; plate!  But that will come with the same strings attached!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Remember one thing about smithing if you remember anything at all... It<br/>\n&gt; costs more than MATERIALS to make an item!  It costs you TIME too!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\n&gt; Proud member of Platinum Sphere Guild - www.platinumsphere.com<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Have pet food delivered right to your door, from Petstore.com!<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/petstore1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/petstore1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A new breed of petstore - Petstore.com<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
