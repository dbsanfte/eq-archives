Yes. If their<br/>\nstore has items that are not sold very often, do they raise the price of<br/>\nmore commonly sold items to compensate? Yes. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow, having said that, lets look at another phenomena. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tI go to college and learn programming. Joe, he goes to school and doesn&#39;t<br/>\nget more than his High School Diploma. Who makes more money? Who&#39;s skill is<br/>\nmore valuable?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow granted I don&#39;t march out and say &quot;hey I want $50,000 up front because<br/>\nthat is what my schooling cost! But you would assume that over the next 3,<br/>\n5, or 10 years you&#39;d more than exceed that price (of schooling/training) in<br/>\nyour quality of living and/or straight income.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe problem with EQ is that the economy&#39;s &quot;bottom&quot; is VERY LOW. In fact it<br/>\nis CRITICALLY low. Most trade items cannot be sold to NPCs for even equal<br/>\nto what it cost to make them (materials only). As a result, the player has<br/>\nno reason to sell lower and lower, as he knows if he makes more than the<br/>\nNPC gives him he&#39;s not totally losing out. Of course granted I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nnobody sell for less than materials, but there is no given &quot;skill&quot; cost<br/>\nbecause the bottom is so low.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIf it wasn&#39;t for the fact that the word &quot;economy&quot; is only about how much<br/>\nmoney is in the &quot;pool&quot; at any given time, vs. goods measured against money<br/>\nin that pool (ie. the economy is non-existent), then EQ&#39;s economy would<br/>\ncrash horribly and irrepairably.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI agree with the first guy. The only way to ensure a decent profitability<br/>\nin any amount of time measured less than months is to try and fix the prices.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCralis Trueblade<br/>\nBrother of the E&#39;ci Trueblades<br/>\nOriginal Brothers of the Guardian Archon<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cralis@...\">cralis@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webmaster@...\">webmaster@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It is our creed that no evil shall stand, whether it be man or gnoll, in<br/>\nthe forest or the city, among friends or be an enemy.
