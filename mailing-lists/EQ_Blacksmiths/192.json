I&#39;ll probably do it myself<br/>\nwhen my warrior reaches high level. Actually, I gave my roommate (a 5th<br/>\nlevel Shaman) 2 onyx earrings, two pieces of banded, spiked collar, two<br/>\ncutthroat rings, and a snakeskin tunic just last Wednesday. People I hang<br/>\nwith sometimes have a problem with it. I was with a 18th level Wizard that<br/>\nran up to a 3rd level wizard (with a FBR on) and said &quot;DUEL ME!&quot;.<br/>\nHeh...kinda funny. I do think it takes a bit out of the challenge of the<br/>\ngame, and I get on it sometimes that *I* had to work so hard to get where<br/>\nI&#39;m at (noone gave me anything), but this soon goes away cuz they obviously<br/>\nplayed ALOT more than me if they can equip a 3rd level character with a FBR<br/>\nand other good eq and start anew. And, Verant said, if I remember correctly,<br/>\nthat THEY have a problem with it. I don&#39;t know that they said they would do<br/>\nanything about it, but they said they look down on it. And no, I have no<br/>\nclue where I saw that...heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust me 2 coppers.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Zantaer, Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:davidb@...\">davidb@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:davidb@...\">davidb@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 28, 1999 12:02 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Banks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:davidb@...\">davidb@...</a> (David Burkhart)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso put yourself in &quot;real life&quot;.

How does twinking<br/>\n&gt; degrade your play and or fun? How does it prevent you from doing<br/>\n&gt; leveling, completing quests, goofing off? If the gear was on a level 50<br/>\n&gt; PC, how is this better than a level 1 PC?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just curious, cause personally, I think telling people what they can and<br/>\n&gt; cannot do with items they own is silly in the first place, and I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; never noticed any lessening of my enjoyment of the game due to some<br/>\n&gt; twinking.
