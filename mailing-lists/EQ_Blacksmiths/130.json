My motto is if<br/>\nyou aren&#39;t going to make a good profit.... don&#39;t make it.  There is plenty<br/>\nof people wanting to buy armor and you shouldn&#39;t just powersmith suits to<br/>\nget to whatever skill making banded will take you.  The thing that I&#39;m told<br/>\nwhat they&#39;re doing is they make hordes of banded tunics ... lately.... and<br/>\nthen sell them for 15 pp each to anyone that will buy them.  So the most<br/>\nexpensive piece of armor is being sold dirt cheap.  But I&#39;m starting up a<br/>\nsmithing consortium on that server and so far have contacted about ten<br/>\nsmiths to get together and charge the same rates or near them on everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone could tell me how I can build weapons it&#39;d be appreciated thanks.<br/>\nThe weapons and armor guide I bought in Neriak seems to point out only the<br/>\nbanded mail smithing ingredients.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if there&#39;s any advanced guides or other ones that basic blacksmithing<br/>\nand the armor and weapons guide I&#39;d like to know where they are thanks =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
