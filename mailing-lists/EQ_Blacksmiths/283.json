He rewarded me with an unfinished blade mold.  I am curious if this is a working item and if so were can I find information on how to use it?  I had hoped that he would tell me what I would need to use this item&#8230;but he said nothing.  I have a smithing skill of 110 and climbing so I am willing to bet that I can make something with it if it is working but I really hate to waste the time and money trying to make something when I know I will lose the mold if I try to make anything!  Please any hints or tips would be very very appreciated!!!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThank you,\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nJay Viglione\r<br/>\nBelrin 14th Rank Cleric of Kaladim on the Karana Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
