That doesn&#39;t make me against this<br/>\n&gt; price war :) Laws were<br/>\n&gt; established against<br/>\n&gt; collusion and monopolies to prevent the abuse of the<br/>\n&gt; abilities they granted.<br/>\n&gt; It was proven<br/>\n&gt; that people who practiced either concept would abuse<br/>\n&gt; the ability (i.e. JD<br/>\n&gt; Rockefeller and<br/>\n&gt; Standard Oil). There is no law in EQ saying we can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; practice these concepts<br/>\n&gt; or even one<br/>\n&gt; saying we can&#39;t abuse them. We could be jerks and<br/>\n&gt; charge just as much as<br/>\n&gt; chain.
