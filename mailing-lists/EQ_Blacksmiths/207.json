Next are<br/>\nLanterns. I tried skewers and was wasting ALOT of money. Lanterns boosted my<br/>\npoints a good bit. When Lanterns become trivial, then switch to skewers. One<br/>\nlast personal recommendation, take skewers all the way to 115, where they<br/>\nbecome trivial. At this skill level you can start making banded armor with<br/>\ngood proficiency. You still fail on items at times. Keep this in mind. The<br/>\ncheapest banded item you can make, gorgets and bracers, each cost you over 1<br/>\nplat. Skewers only cost a little over 1 gold. Practicing on skewers is alot<br/>\ncheaper on your purse than practicing on Banded.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Nick [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brutalny@...\">brutalny@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, May 30, 1999 12:27 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] skewers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  i have a 22 skill in blacksmithing with my level 17 dwarf warrior.  i<br/>\nstarted making skewers but i only made 1 in about 21 failing the rest and<br/>\nonly gaining one skill point.  should i be making something different to<br/>\nbuild my skill at this point?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
