I mean how many characters will you<br/>\nmake and take up to level 50 before you finally decide your tired of it<br/>\nall...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for those of us that plan on doing things *the right way* and following<br/>\nthe rules (mostly), things will start to get better over time... in fact, I<br/>\nstarted a new character (also on Karana) and found that the *newbie* area is<br/>\npractically EMPTY compared to when I first started (which was about 2 weeks<br/>\ninto the games debut).  So, you can actually level up FASTER because there<br/>\nis less competition... Also, you can level faster because you KNOW more<br/>\nabout: 1) How to play... 2) where to go... 3) what to look for...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, hopefully things will only get BETTER...  At least that&#39;s what I am<br/>\nhoping for...<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I did see ONE newbie (level 5 Cleric) who already had full banded... he<br/>\nhad twinked it from his *other* character which was a level 25...<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jason Coan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 01, 1999 9:13 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Banks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; the camping problem is directly related to twinkers.  when someone is<br/>\ncamping an item, they get their item and should move on....but they<br/>\ndon&#39;t....they continue to camp to get more items to twink their guild<br/>\nbuddies, or to twink their other characters......mean while I can&#39;t get the<br/>\nitem due to their twinking.....direct relationship there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The people who deserve the items are the ones that are willing to get them<br/>\nwith the character that is going to use them......ie no camping rubicite<br/>\nwith your 40th lvl wizard to give to your 5th lvl warrior<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; greedy bastards all over the place, ruining the game for everyone simply<br/>\nso they can twink out their newbie characters or friends, blah<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Mark Guckeyson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mguckeyson@...\">mguckeyson@...</a>&gt; 6.1.99 9:57:49 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mguckeyson@...\">mguckeyson@...</a> (Mark Guckeyson)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s crazy about level 5 in rubicite? It&#39;s odd, even frustrating, but<br/>\n&gt; so what? You haven&#39;t answered my question; merely given another example<br/>\n&gt; of it. Now the camping situation is something entirely different... and<br/>\n&gt; not directly related to twinking. Do you think that if they weren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; twinking they&#39;d move on? I sure don&#39;t. I&#39;m willing to bet they&#39;d just<br/>\n&gt; camp then sell the things. Actually, I&#39;d prefer to see someone camping<br/>\n&gt; for the sole purpose of giving &#39;em away. After all, that just means that<br/>\n&gt; whoever they&#39;re giving them to will have no reason to camp there. And<br/>\n&gt; how do you determine who &#39;deserves&#39; the items? I think you&#39;re speaking<br/>\n&gt; on a level of personal frustration... which is completely<br/>\n&gt; understandable, but difficult to defend logically.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In any case, here&#39;s to few campers, great loot drops and wildly<br/>\n&gt; efficient xp.<br/>\n&gt; mark<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jason Coan wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; depends on what is being twinked.....a lvl 5 in full rubicite is crazy.<br/>\nNot only that, but people who twink out their other characters like this are<br/>\nthe people who FARM items.
