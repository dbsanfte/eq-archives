Anyhow, there is a large buzz going on in the pottery list that I<br/>\nwould like to share with all the other smiths out there!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the OoT (I do not know where yet), there is a merchant that is selling<br/>\nWEAPON SKETCHES!  I believe that these sketches and proper ingredients, when<br/>\npropery formed at the wheel and burned at the kiln, form weapon molds!<br/>\nFINALLY!  Maybe soon we will be selling weapons alongside our banded armor!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone else has any info, please share it.  Thanks all!<br/>\n<br/>\nHaijar the Mage Blacksmith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
