I have been searching all<br/>\nover to find the recipe to make small bricks.  The books do not say and some of<br/>\nthe webpages I have seen say to combine (2) metal bits (seperated) with (1)<br/>\nFlask of Water (not summoned)  when I do this all three items are destroyed.  Do<br/>\nI have something wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nDid something change with a new patch or did this cobination never work?  Sorry<br/>\nif you have answered this already but around Oggok we hardly ever see a really<br/>\ntrained smith so I have no one in game to ask for guidance.  Thank you in<br/>\nadvance.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Krobuu<br/>\nE&#39;Ci and Vallon Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
