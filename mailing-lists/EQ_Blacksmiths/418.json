(none I&#39;d bet)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve spent about 2 months to get the armor that I am now wearing, I&#39;d be<br/>\npissed to an extreem if I were in the middle of a fight and I see a message<br/>\n&quot;Your Charred Black Tunic has fallen appart&quot;.  That one piece of armor alone<br/>\ntook me the better part of week to get.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, so you say I should have to get it repaired by a smith.  I am DE, and<br/>\nby choice I have lowered my faction to the point where I will never be able<br/>\nto go into Freeport or Rivervale, and due to built in factions, I can not go<br/>\nto any other elf city nor can I go into gnome, dwarf, or barbarian city.<br/>\nWhich means that I would have to search, not only for a respectable smith<br/>\nthat I trusted, but also an evil one, or trek my self across the world to<br/>\nQeynos.  Simply to get my armor &quot;repaired&quot;.  Now if that isn&#39;t bad<br/>\nenough.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Often my group will go deep into a dungeon, deep to the point where either<br/>\na caster has to group gate us to get us out, or we have to spend 30-45 min<br/>\nfighting out way out of the dungeon.  And quite often we&#39;ll all camp and<br/>\nlogout in a &quot;safe&quot; spot in the dungeon, so sometimes we will be in a dungeon<br/>\nlitterly for days.  Now, say I get the message &quot;your rubicite helm is<br/>\nbegining to weaken, you should take it for repairs soon&quot;, that means that my<br/>\nentire group would have to leave the dungeon so that I might quest to get my<br/>\narmor repaired.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I find neither to be acceptable.  What I do find about this, is that there<br/>\nare some smiths who think they don&#39;t make enough money, so they want armor<br/>\nto wear out, so it has to either be replaced or repaired (more money for<br/>\nsmiths).  What they fail to concider is the fact that you will not always be<br/>\nwearing banded armor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nStart a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\nSee homepage for details on ONElist&#39;s new &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY&quot; program.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
