Not wanting to do the &#39;mule&#39; or twinking thing!<br/>\n<br/>\nI too believe that it&#39;s silly to do that!  I mean, why take away so much<br/>\nfrom the game (earning it all yourself or with friends)??<br/>\n<br/>\nI say again GOOD FOR YOU!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to taking up smithing, realize that it is a time consuming and COSTLY<br/>\nskill to learn (as I found out like others did)... There are sooo many that<br/>\nwant to learn smithing for the money... I myself started smithing because I<br/>\nwanted to make my OWN armor to wear instead of buying it from others...<br/>\nWhich is why I still don&#39;t have full banded even though I am level 18...<br/>\nhehe.. But I also get to waste lots of money making banded stuff that I can<br/>\nsell... hehe...<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hail Blacksmiths.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am a warrior of the 16th Tier and was looking to start a trade skill.<br/>\n&gt; Since I am a barbarian warrior and fit the mold of what a blacksmith<br/>\n&gt; &#39;usually&#39; would look like, I have a few basic questions.
