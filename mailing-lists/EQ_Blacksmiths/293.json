If","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1608181590\">1) I would put in as many points as you can (Up till 21) to start.  It&#39;s<br/>\nokay if you can only put in 14.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Next, make Metal Bits until you have a bunch.  If you didn&#39;t put 21<br/>\npoints in at the beginning, you will reach 21 making Metal Bits.  Don&#39;t sell<br/>\nthem because you&#39;ll need them for everything except banded.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Make scalers till 41.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Make lanterns till 68.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Make skewers till 90&#39;s.  Once you get to the 90&#39;s, you can make every<br/>\npiece of banded except leggings and cloaks fairly well.  If you want to stop<br/>\nfor a bit and regain some cash, this is where I would do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Keep making skewers till 115.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) Make pots till 122.<br/>\n<br/>\n8) Make sewing kits till 135.  Now, you can make every piece with ease.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took me about 75pp (I put in 17 points in the beginning) to get to skill<br/>\n90.  It took me 2 days (About 7 hrs total playing time) to get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrenfen<br/>\nMaster Smith, Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
