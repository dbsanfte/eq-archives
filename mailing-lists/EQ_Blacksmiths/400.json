Now, if they didn&#39;t have items completely wear out,<br/>\nbut maybe eventually go down to 75% of their max stats and stay there until<br/>\nrepaired by a skilled tradesman.  They would have to make it so repairs<br/>\ndidn&#39;t result in the original item being destroyed, however.  How&#39;d you like<br/>\nto take your tunic in for repairs and have the smith destroy it.  Magic<br/>\nitems would be indestructible, of course.  Bah, I hate the entire idea.  I<br/>\nwish they&#39;d fix fletching instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;<br/>\nI was reading an email from someone that compared the EQ market to the US<br/>\nmarket.  They stated that one reason they are different is because in RL<br/>\nthings wear out and in EQ they are eternal.  This is so true.  Has anyone<br/>\nthought of or actually talked to Verant about having armor wear out?  This<br/>\nwould cause buyers to go to smiths for repairs or replacements.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow if this seems like a good idea or not.  I think it does.  Let me know<br/>\nwhat you all think of this idea.<br/>\n&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
