Tailoring is probably next to be worked on after make<br/>\npoison,<br/>\n&gt; and then probably tinkering or alchemy from what I&#39;ve read all around), we<br/>\n&gt; should only sell for 5 to 10 plat less than the magical plates are sold<br/>\nfor. We<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t sell for NPC plate prices (people would just buy magical plate) but<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; really don&#39;t want to shoot myself in the foot and have the same thing<br/>\nhappen<br/>\n&gt; with plate as it did to banded. Please, no flames, I know some of you will<br/>\nonly<br/>\n&gt; want 10 plat profit per piece, that&#39;s your right, and this is mine. This<br/>\nis what<br/>\n&gt; I will be doing and I would hope if you&#39;re concerned over smithing, please<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; the same. Plate will NOT be cheaper to make oneself (not only the 150 plat<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; takes to get to banded, but all the time selling banded to get to making<br/>\nplate),<br/>\n&gt; so we don&#39;t have to worry about that happening. Just gotta be competetive<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; magical plates. Again, please no flames, I&#39;m terribly sick of them, and I<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; not respond. Please, if you&#39;re on my side, don&#39;t respond to any flames<br/>\neither.<br/>\n&gt; Let the baby have his/her bottle.<br/>\n&gt; -Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n&gt;  Trade Council GM<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Attention ONElist list owners!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out the new &quot;DEFAULT MODERATED STATUS&quot; option.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
