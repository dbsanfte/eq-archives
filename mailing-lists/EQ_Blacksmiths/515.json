My","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1488303495\">Everyone notice how last night all the other skills got some changes EXCEPT blacksmithing.  Oh well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny how.  I have a feeling blacksmithing is broke.  My skill is 126 or somewhere near there.  I can make all items with only a few failures.  (I hate legs though, seem to fail a lot.)<br/>\nI have made well over 100 pieces of armor over the past couple of weeks, and have not seen a single point of skill increase.  I didn&#39;t have any problem getting skill up to 126 making all the standard stuff, then I start making armor, and I get nothing.  My Int is about average 86.  I&#39;m thinking that getting skill from making armor is broke.  Has anyone else seen this?  Also, I know some armor items are trivial, and I know I&#39;m not making a ton of trivial armor items.  I&#39;ve made plenty of legs, mails, cloaks, mantles, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny insight you folks can provide would be great.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, why aren&#39;t there banded gloves.  I have people asking me for these all the time.  Let&#39;s get those /feedback /bugs going and get some changes to blacksmithing in the works.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhaat!!!
