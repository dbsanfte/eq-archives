I think it would be great to get some kick ass armor<br/>\n&gt; like that!  But then....it wouldn&#39;t be fair.  Think about it.  Enchanters<br/>\n&gt; already are the best at Jewelry Making.  It is (pretty much) damn foolish<br/>\n&gt; for anyone BUT an enchanter to learn the skill.  Unless, of course, you also<br/>\n&gt; play a high lvl enchanter who you use for your own enchanted metals.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; By giving enchanters the ability to enchant sheet metal, thereby creating<br/>\n&gt; magical armor, this make&#39;s enchanters have far too much control over the<br/>\n&gt; market.  Jewelry making and Blacksmithing all would depend upon enchanters?<br/>\n&gt; No, I&#39;d rather not have that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Besides, Magical Armor should be something special.  IMHO, I believe there<br/>\n&gt; should be quests for Blacksmith&#39;s, where the reward might be a mold that<br/>\n&gt; comes enchanted with some random quality.  This would allow EVERYone the<br/>\n&gt; opportunity to do this, and make us not be dependant upon enchanters.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What do you all think?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Haijar the Mage Blacksmith<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
