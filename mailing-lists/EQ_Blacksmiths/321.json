There may be 20 spread out over 20 servers.  Whoopee.   IF this<br/>\nmailing list was legitimate, then fixing prices would work. (Would the EQ<br/>\ngovernment get on our case for collusion?  hehe.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to sell my banded for fair prices.  The market in greater faydark<br/>\n(Fennin Ro) is steady.  There are the occasional low-priced sellers, but<br/>\nthey&#39;re almost never a smith; probably some warrior who just got himself a<br/>\nbronze breastplate.  I generally stay around and sell armor for an hour or<br/>\ntwo and make around 100pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve it or not, smithing is still lucrative, albeit not as good as when a<br/>\nserver first starts.  The real profit is made from items like boots, helms,<br/>\nsleeves, pants, and tunics.  Boots cost about 3pp to make and I sell them<br/>\nfor 10pp consistently, and they&#39;re easy to make.  Pants and tunics are easy<br/>\nfor me as well (skill 134) I sell them for three times their cost (16pp and<br/>\n18pp, respectively).  I tend to scowl at masks and belts because they cost 2<br/>\nmetal sheets and I can only sell them for 5pp and 7pp, respectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrenfen of Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
