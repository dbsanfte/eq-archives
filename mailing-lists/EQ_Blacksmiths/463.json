I tried 3 times and lost money on rare occasions. That was also<br/>\nwhen my smithing was just over 100, but I still think 4 times (about) is pretty<br/>\ngood :) Let&#39;s not get into this whole thing again, though =P Sell for whatever<br/>\nyou want, my prices work for me, your prices work for you :) 4 times has kept<br/>\nboth me and my customers happy, so I stick with approximately that. That&#39;s my<br/>\nonly reasoning or backing, I will not have another flame war :)<br/>\n-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Trade Council GM<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Lemac Justerian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Plate costs should be balanced between the cost an NPC would BUY them for,<br/>\n&gt; and the cost an NPC will SELL them for... example: if the NPC will BUY that<br/>\n&gt; Breast Plate for 50 but wants to SELL it for 200, then your price could<br/>\n&gt; (should) be half way between those two - 125p - or higher... IF your costs<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t outweigh it...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the RW, most manufacturers make an item for $1.00 in costs for both parts<br/>\n&gt; AND labor, but with overhead, middlemen and retail costs, and profits for<br/>\n&gt; each along the way, the actual PRICE of the item is usually around $9.99 or<br/>\n&gt; more...  Learn from RL folks... Sure we probably couldn&#39;t sell our Banded<br/>\n&gt; for 10 times what it costs (actual) to make it, but hey, 3 times the amount<br/>\n&gt; is not that bad...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\n&gt; Proud member of Platinum Sphere Guild - www.platinumsphere.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Bryan G Hardy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhardy@...\">bhardy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, July 15, 1999 4:25 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Plate Pricing<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Bryan G Hardy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhardy@...\">bhardy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Scaled plate should be offered at no less than half of what storebought<br/>\n&gt; &gt; plate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; costs.

Tailoring is probably next to be worked on after make<br/>\n&gt; &gt; poison,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and then probably tinkering or alchemy from what I&#39;ve read all around),<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; should only sell for 5 to 10 plat less than the magical plates are sold<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for. We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can&#39;t sell for NPC plate prices (people would just buy magical plate)<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; really don&#39;t want to shoot myself in the foot and have the same thing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; happen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with plate as it did to banded. Please, no flames, I know some of you<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; want 10 plat profit per piece, that&#39;s your right, and this is mine. This<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will be doing and I would hope if you&#39;re concerned over smithing,<br/>\n&gt; please<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same. Plate will NOT be cheaper to make oneself (not only the 150<br/>\n&gt; plat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; takes to get to banded, but all the time selling banded to get to making<br/>\n&gt; &gt; plate),<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so we don&#39;t have to worry about that happening. Just gotta be<br/>\n&gt; competetive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; magical plates. Again, please no flames, I&#39;m terribly sick of them, and<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not respond. Please, if you&#39;re on my side, don&#39;t respond to any flames<br/>\n&gt; &gt; either.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let the baby have his/her bottle.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Trade Council GM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Attention ONElist list owners!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Check out the new &quot;DEFAULT MODERATED STATUS&quot; option.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Enjoy 120+ unique music channels right from your desktop!
