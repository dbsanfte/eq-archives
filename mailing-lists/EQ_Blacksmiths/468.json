Some molds are on a couple of ogres (the<br/>\nbooks mainly), and have been told about the guy upstairs in the mushroom inn<br/>\nsells some also (armor I think I was told) and the guy playing darts in the<br/>\nblind fish sells sharpening stones plus ore (this I know).<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know where Sharpening stones are sold in.... forgot the name<br/>\nwood elf city, I found the forge but can&#39;t find ore or the stone to get<br/>\nstarted. Oh, found the molds off 2 vendors... still trying to get use to the<br/>\ncity and not falling off the edge :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTenin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Paul Heenan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pheenan@...\">pheenan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_blacksmiths@onelist.com\">eq_blacksmiths@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 22, 1999 9:28 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Evil Smiths?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Paul Heenan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pheenan@...\">pheenan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this has been asked before, but where can I find smithing<br/>\nsupplies for a Dark Elf?
