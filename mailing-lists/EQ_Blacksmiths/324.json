It&#39;s more or less a dead<br/>\nlist because there&#39;s also an EQ_Baking list. Well, despite the lack of talk,<br/>\nthere&#39;s a lot of listening. Over 50 people are signed up for it. Chances are the<br/>\nnumbers are similarly higher on this list :) I say we try price fixing for a<br/>\nlittle while. We don&#39;t have anything to lose, but we have everything to gain. We<br/>\ncan let our market die slowly or we can fight to preserve it and improve it.<br/>\nNobody else will fight the battle for us, but several (including some of our own<br/>\nas some recent posts indicate) will fight against us. We can&#39;t just die... too<br/>\nmuch has been invested in our trade to do that.<br/>\n-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Trade Council GM<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Lin wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Chris Lin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrislin@...\">chrislin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The problem with fixing prices is that there are not enough smiths on this<br/>\n&gt; list.  There may be 20 spread out over 20 servers.  Whoopee.   IF this<br/>\n&gt; mailing list was legitimate, then fixing prices would work. (Would the EQ<br/>\n&gt; government get on our case for collusion?  hehe.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I tend to sell my banded for fair prices.  The market in greater faydark<br/>\n&gt; (Fennin Ro) is steady.  There are the occasional low-priced sellers, but<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re almost never a smith; probably some warrior who just got himself a<br/>\n&gt; bronze breastplate.  I generally stay around and sell armor for an hour or<br/>\n&gt; two and make around 100pp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Believe it or not, smithing is still lucrative, albeit not as good as when a<br/>\n&gt; server first starts.  The real profit is made from items like boots, helms,<br/>\n&gt; sleeves, pants, and tunics.  Boots cost about 3pp to make and I sell them<br/>\n&gt; for 10pp consistently, and they&#39;re easy to make.  Pants and tunics are easy<br/>\n&gt; for me as well (skill 134) I sell them for three times their cost (16pp and<br/>\n&gt; 18pp, respectively).  I tend to scowl at masks and belts because they cost 2<br/>\n&gt; metal sheets and I can only sell them for 5pp and 7pp, respectively.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Trenfen of Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
