For the reasons you<br/>\nstated, it would, but it would be abused too easily to help *twink* another<br/>\ncharacter up...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you would start seeing even more (there already are some) lower<br/>\nlevel characters wearing the best armor and having the best weapons that<br/>\nmoney can buy because they are &#39;sharing&#39; those items with the &#39;other&#39;<br/>\nplayer...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words:  I have a level 18 character that has all banded armor and a<br/>\nCombine Staff - I put it into the bank, log out, log back on as a NEW<br/>\ncharacter that is level 1... he puts on the armor, grabs the staff, and in<br/>\njust a few hours he is up to level 10!  Not worrying much about getting<br/>\nkilled off because his AC is around 300 or so!<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, no sharing of accounts...  BUT, I WOULD like to see some way for GUILDS<br/>\nto have a &#39;seperate&#39; account (for officers) to make it easier to handle the<br/>\nincome and outlay of the guilds...<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone else here think that they should make joint bank accounts?
