Ogre and Troll smiths have no choice but to make their own sheets from the start as no one sells sheets anywhere near us nor anywhere we can go and not be KOS. It&#39;s a bit of a hassle having to buy 16 small blocks of ore at a time from Grobb, haul them back to Oggok and make eight sheets out of them, but we have no other choice. BTW, at 15 lbs each, the blocks weigh 240 lbs together. Luckily we are endowed with great strength (mine is 140) and this plus what we are already wearing merely encumbers us. I&#39;m thinking a human or elf wouldn&#39;t even be able to move, thus you have vendors who sell it pre-made. <br/>\n<br/>\nKludge<br/>\nMaster Blacksmith of Oggok<br/>\nRallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Bryan G Hardy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhardy@...\">bhardy@...</a>&gt; 07/12 3:11 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Bryan G Hardy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhardy@...\">bhardy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was sworn to secrecy on the blue ore, sorry I cannae say =)<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter 175 is scaled plate, unfortunately the folded sheets are<br/>\n&quot;administratively broken&quot;, meaning Verant has decided not to<br/>\nlet us smith them yet, so combining a block of ore and a flask<br/>\nof water will yield nothing.
