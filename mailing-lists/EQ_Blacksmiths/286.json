She increased VERY fast (while we were talking she went from<br/>\nlevel 1-15 in about 5 minutes!) and at the same time she was getting to keep<br/>\nthe stones many times too...  (she had saved lots of old daggers)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe then started making bits and that was where I left her... She messaged<br/>\nme about 10 min later to tell me she was already over 21 now and was<br/>\nstarting on files.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, you can increase very quickly now without having to put 20 points into<br/>\nit... If you don&#39;t have lots of extra points to spend that is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\nProud member of Platinum Sphere Guild - www.platinumsphere.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
