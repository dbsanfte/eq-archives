AC on a twinked character, even if he/she is<br/>\n&gt; wearing banded, is still not very high until you get to a higher<br/>\n&gt; level.  You<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be able to fight red MOBs very much, because even though<br/>\n&gt; you have a<br/>\n&gt; FS Longsword, your 1h slashing skill might only be 30.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Lemac Justerian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, May 28, 1999 12:35 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com\">EQ_Blacksmiths@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_Blacksmiths] Banks<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Lemac Justerian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Joint bank accounts wouldn&#39;t be that great of an idea...

Not worrying much about getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; killed off because his AC is around 300 or so!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; No, no sharing of accounts...
