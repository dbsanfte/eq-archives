I made a separate character to purchase water and<br/>\n&gt;molds in East Freeport.  I&#39;d just like to say that a dark elf with 134<br/>\n&gt;intelligence makes a very good and cost effective smith.  I&#39;ve spent maybe<br/>\n&gt;at the MOST 80 pp in getting to 100 skill.  I spent 15 practice points right<br/>\n&gt;off and then sharpened until trivial.  Then scalers until 41 trivial and now<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m still making skewers even at 100 skill.  I&#39;m wondering how far skewers<br/>\n&gt;will advance you?  And also what skill level would give you about 50%<br/>\n&gt;success rate making tunic, legs, helm<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On another note on the E&#39;ci server there&#39;s a group of merchants selling<br/>\n&gt;banded tunics for as low as 15 pp ... this destroys mine and every other<br/>\n&gt;smith of the server&#39;s hard work.  They&#39;re selling sleeves for 8 pp for gods<br/>\n&gt;sake!  People level 10 were not meant to afford a full suit of banded mail<br/>\n&gt;and these smiths run a fairly large operation I&#39;m told by fellow smiths that<br/>\n&gt;they number into the 30&#39;s and are a blacksmithing guild.  What is there that<br/>\n&gt;can be done?  Anything?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>On Bertoxxulous, we run a similar guild (we have tailors, jewelsmiths,<br/>\npotters, everything).  However, we don&#39;t charge insanely low prices (they<br/>\nmust operate on sheer volume), and so we make a sizable profit and can<br/>\nafford bronze mail or dual combines, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you tried asking them why they price everything so low?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
