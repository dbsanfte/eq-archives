It would be over 1000<br/>\nhours... But I don&#39;;t think the &#39;average&#39; player is going to spend 20 hours<br/>\na week and only get 1-2 levels either... In fact, I reached level 5 in about<br/>\n4 hours as I recall... It&#39;s the other 17 (I am now 22) that took me the<br/>\nbetter part of 400+ hours to reach... but that is by my CHOICE!  Because I<br/>\nwanted to spend time chatting with others, selling stuff, making stuff and<br/>\njust plain exploring places... And guess what... I still do all that!  I<br/>\nprobably don&#39;t actually play 20 hours a week, more like 15 I would guess...<br/>\nand I probably gain 1.5 levels in that time... So, it would be more like 750<br/>\nhours to make level 50... But that is not the case either I would bet, not<br/>\nfor me anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I know MANY others that play regularly (daily) for at least 4 hours<br/>\nper session... that would give them at least 28 hours per week... which is<br/>\nwhy they (my friends) are 3-7 levels above me even though we started out<br/>\nabout the same time...<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, who cares?!?!   This is the way that *I* like to play!!  If you<br/>\nwant to be some *power-leveler* then go for it!!  Crank up those levels as<br/>\nfast as you can!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Verant did the right thing in making it easy to level up in the<br/>\nBEGINNING, and harder to make levels later on...

I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only a casual player,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and there have been many patches where I&#39;ve felt a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bit shafted.  They have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; made EQ into a beast that requires absurd amounts of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time to make any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; progress whatsoever.  I used to have a great group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of people to party with,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but I couldn&#39;t dedicate the 40+ hours per week that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they did, so I&#39;m enough<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; levels behind that I can&#39;t group with them and make<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any progress... so I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stuck at a mid level and I haven&#39;t been able to find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; another decent group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for the life of me.  So instead of facing all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; frustration, I&#39;m wishing I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could just switch my characters to &quot;inactive&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; status... where I can&#39;t play<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the game, but they don&#39;t delete my characters.... so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I can come back in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; year or so if nothing better comes along.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On the flip side, if EQ was just 50% easier, you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t be able to pry me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; away from that infernal compter.  It&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; excitement of making progress<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that is so fun, and for the casual gamer, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; progress curve in EQ is so low<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after lvl 20 that it&#39;s just not that much fun<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anymore.  I&#39;d almost rather<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spend my time playing Kingdoms or go back and play<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bladur&#39;s Gate all the way<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through, or best of all... go find a good text-based<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MUD where I can advance<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at a reasonable speed then wiz and start adding my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; own imagination to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; world.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Kzak<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; P.S. does anybody know a email address for feedback?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  I&#39;d love to just share<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some of these frustrations.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How do you enter ONElist&#39;s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; By joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
