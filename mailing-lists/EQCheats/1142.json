When I enable both monitors<br/>\n&gt;and play EQ, the second monitor is disabled for Alt-Tabs and such.  <br/>\n&gt;However,<br/>\n&gt;if you move a program like Clock over to the second display, BEFORE you<br/>\n&gt;start EQ, it does stay there during game play.  But programs liek ICQ <br/>\n&gt;return<br/>\n&gt;to the system tray on the primary display, and you can&#39;t see anything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You also can&#39;t move your mouse to the second display.  Depending of which<br/>\n&gt;way to set your screen to stretch, you can&#39;t move beyond the boundaries of<br/>\n&gt;the game during play.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can move your mouse over to the other screen but ONLY if you adjust your<br/>\n<br/>\nsettings under control panel - desktop - monitor. Then adjust your settings <br/>\nfor your desktop area. I had mine set to 2048 x 768 when I had 2 monitors <br/>\nand 2 cards in, and you should be able to use both monitors. I know it works<br/>\n<br/>\nwith Win NT, (I use it at work with the same settings) for drafting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nATTENTION ONElist MEMBERS:  Get your ONElist news!<br/>\nJoin our MEMBER NEWSLETTER here:<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
