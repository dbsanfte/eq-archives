I joined this list to get more hints<br/>\nthan cheats.<br/>\nAll the hacks and cheat programs RUINED Diablo and completely unbalanced UO.<br/>\nI commend Verant for the foresight it took to make alt-tabbing almost<br/>\nimpossible to use while running EQ.<br/>\nI hope Blizzard picks up on this before they release D2.<br/>\nIf you want a juiced up character learn to write your own code...and go play<br/>\nQuake!<br/>\nIf you have to cheat to have fun, maybe you should work on improving your<br/>\nplaying skills instead, &#39;cause if you can&#39;t get good gear (and experience)<br/>\nin this game without cheating you REALLY suck as a player.<br/>\nOh, FYI, I feel the same way about the places where you can get monsters<br/>\n&#39;stuck&#39; and still cast at them...I think it&#39;s great that Verant bans people<br/>\nthat do that crap :)<br/>\nOn a more cordial note, any of you beta testing Asheron&#39;s Call?  I got my<br/>\ninvite last week put haven&#39;t played it yet.<br/>\nOh yeah - save your flames...these are just MY opinions, you&#39;re welcome to<br/>\nyour own :)<br/>\nI KNOW this is a &#39;Cheats&#39; list, but 90% of the time its really a SPOILER<br/>\nlist, not a &#39;cheat&#39; list.<br/>\nDon&#39;t forget to HAVE FUN!<br/>\nIsn&#39;t that why you&#39;re PLAYING????<br/>\nSean<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Omeg Felligan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:omeg_felligan@...\">omeg_felligan@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 17, 1999 9:38 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQCheats] possible big cheat for EQ....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Omeg Felligan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:omeg_felligan@...\">omeg_felligan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, does anyone remember the days of Diablo where you&#39;d just Alt-Tab over to<br/>\n<br/>\nyour cheat program?<br/>\n<br/>\nwell, I was on ICQ the other day and I got a msg, and not thinking I <br/>\nalt-tab&#39;ed once, nothing, twice and I was out of EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my mouse was fairly locked up, but the key board still worked, I could <br/>\nalt-tab between other programs.  (only had ICQ open)  when the CTRL-ALT-DEL <br/>\nwindow came up (I pushed em) I could again use my mouse while it was up.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhen I tried to go back into EQ it didn&#39;t work, but it still takes time to <br/>\ncamp out your character eh? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking this may be able to allow some cheat programs, but probably <br/>\nnot, everything seems to me server side except for hot keys.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I am not a good enough programmer to write something that might be able<br/>\n<br/>\nto take advantage of this, nor do I know anyone who is.  If you are give <br/>\nyour input and see if anything works eh?  hehehe...if anyone does figure <br/>\nsomething out they&#39;d be a god to EQ cheaters :)<br/>\n<br/>\nhope something comes of this,<br/>\nOmeg<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCreate a list for FRIENDS & FAMILY...<br/>\n...and YOU can WIN $100 to Amazon.com.
