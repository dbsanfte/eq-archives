Trez spawned 3 times during that period and had the circlet every time. The times he does not spawn a magician spawns in his place...  I was a lvl 31 wizard and my partern was a lvl 39 druid, although the ele&#39;s and magicians are all green to me, and Trez himself was blue and goes down in two hits for 250 and one hit for 110. As for the trash magicians i kill them as soon as they spawn before they are allowed to summon there pet. Personally i think a lvl 30 wizard could hold the room solo, with minimum risk, but i liked having another person for security..<br/>\n<br/>\nWes Lobdell,<br/>\nNote: I&#39;m not a Mac person, but you have to admit, the following is funny+ACEAIQ- :) And if you don&#39;t +ACI-get+ACI- it, then I guess the media hasn&#39;t soaked it for all its worth yet after all...<br/>\nQuote: +ACI-Macintosh -- we might not get everything right, but<br/>\natleast we knew the century was going to end.+ACI-<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------<br/>\nMy all time favorite Oxymorons:<br/>\nexact estimate, plastic silverware, genuine imitation, mud bath,   original copy, student teacher, alone together, anarchy rules, bitter sweet, bankrupt millionaire, black light, butt-head, casual sex, clean dirt, coed sorority, cold as hell, computer jock, constant change, cowardly lion, curved line(according to the mathematical  definition of a line),  delibrate mistake, dry wine, earth angel(ok thats just going back a ways +ADs-), educational television, even odds, found missing, freezer burn, fresh cheese, full-length bikini, half full, half naked, hard water, hells angels, idiot savant, jumbo shrimp, less is more, and finally my all time<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Dan Bouchard dbouchar+AEA-butler.com<br/>\nTo: EQCheats+AEA-onelist.com EQCheats+AEA-onelist.com<br/>\nDate: Thursday, September 02, 1999 2:13 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: +AFs-EQCheats+AF0- Digest Number 120<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: +ACI-Dan Bouchard+ACI- dbouchar+AEA-butler.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTrezdon is a Necromancer. If you speak with Ulan Meadowgreen (named Centaur in<br/>\nS Karana that gives the quest), he will tell you a story about an evil Dark Elf<br/>\nNecromancer, blah blah blah. The Dark Circlet is actually a pretty decent piece<br/>\nof headgear but is NEC only. I think it&#39;s better than the Savants Cap but not<br/>\nas good as the Runed Circlet. I&#39;m sure after you get your greaves, if you&#39;re<br/>\never back in Najena camping JBoots or something, pick up another Dark Circlet<br/>\nand you might be able to sell it for a good buck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n             Free Games +ACY- Cash Prizes+ACE-<br/>\nGamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest +ACY- Best Game Show Site+ACE-<br/>\n        <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet paid to surf the web+ACE- Free+ACE-<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alladvantage.com/go.asp?refid+AD0-bvf753\">http://www.alladvantage.com/go.asp?refid+AD0-bvf753</a><br/>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
