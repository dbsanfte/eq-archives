That said here are a few spots I<br/>\nliked<br/>\n<br/>\nForest Giants in that zone next to the Lake of Ill<br/>\nOmen, I forgoten the name of that zone even though I<br/>\nhave homestead rights there.  Basement of the Unrest,<br/>\nyou need a GOOD group. This might not be so hot. The<br/>\nlast time I was there the zone was filled with 16th<br/>\nlevel char and there 50th level mains getting a<br/>\npowerlevel.  Kobolds in the &quot;window room&quot; in that zone<br/>\nwith the Naggy (the red dragon).  Frogs in Lower Guk. <br/>\n I think 30th level is also a good time to try Velious<br/>\n(sp?) you know the Ice zone with the wallrus and<br/>\nbunnys and 40+ level giants.  That zone on the other<br/>\nside of the Warrens might be 30th or so level. <br/>\nProbably more fun for a Druid than a warrior.  There<br/>\nis another zone in Kunark with those gyro goo things<br/>\ntoo.  I know that discription sucks. It is in Kunark<br/>\nand it is a dungeon.  Very hard to find it is small<br/>\ncave entrance and garded by a fake pool of water.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the 30&#39;s is one of the best levels in the game<br/>\nfor exploring and having fun. I have twinked my<br/>\nWarrior just by going to the 50th level zones and<br/>\npicking up nodrop stuff.  If your not dressed like a<br/>\ntwink lots of player will help you. Well it used to be<br/>\nthat way. IMHO the levels past 50 are too time<br/>\nconsumeing.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
