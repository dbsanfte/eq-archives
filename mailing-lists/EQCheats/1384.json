Over the weekend,<br/>\nmy warrior got Crafted Helm, greaves, and boots (lreadying having gauntlets<br/>\nand bracer)! WOOHOO!!<br/>\n<br/>\nDark Circlet is off Trezdon in Najena<br/>\nFrost Totem is off Goblin Patriach in King room in Permafrost (need a level<br/>\n30-34 group to break spawn)<br/>\nFire Totem off some goblin in SolA, I hear High Shaman, but I got it from a<br/>\nfriend (gave the gems to a friend and she did the quest and handed me the<br/>\ngreaves).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, all I missing is a Breastplate and Pauldron I think... Lets see, Talon<br/>\nand rune of the Dwarves... I know where the talons are (don&#39;t know how to<br/>\nget to the gypsy/werewolves...will have to wait for one to train to zone<br/>\nprolly), but I&#39;m not sure where the Evil Eyes are in Beholder. Seen one near<br/>\nthe purple crystals in the water, but don&#39;t know where they spawn? Anyone<br/>\nhelp me out?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso gonna need to find Borxx, since he drops one of the three peices I<br/>\nhear. Where does he spawn, and how often?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for everyone&#39;s assistance in the crafted quests!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
