Is there a spot where we can write back to him, for if he reads where<br/>\nwe write I would gladly put my two cents into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for answering your email *I know you didn&#39;t ask for one :)*, but for the general populations<br/>\n*not just mine or yours but for everyone reading this*, I believe that if Sony wants us to sell to<br/>\nother players to make a profit instead of vendors, they are limiting our game play, if they want<br/>\nbest of both worlds *Sony* in their ideology of how the game should be run, then they need to fix<br/>\nit so that IF someone wants to sell to a PC they might get more depending on what they ask for, but<br/>\nif they want to sell to a NPC they will get less. Now, the way they have it setup now, it&#39;s not<br/>\neven worth maken the items to sell to PC&#39;s because what PC in their right mind would spend 2pp on a<br/>\npie tin ? This is the minimum amount that should be offered if sold to a PC, because of the drastic<br/>\nincrease in price for sketching of a Pie Tin. They must work on it more before implementing a<br/>\nnumber throwen into the skill, so that it&#39;s just not profitable at all. Again, Sony is limiting us<br/>\nin how we play the game, if someone chooses to sit on their butts and make PP all day, so be it, as<br/>\nwe all know, you can spend 300pp in about 5-10 minutes if you are buying weapons or armor of<br/>\nconsiderable value, either case it&#39;s our choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S if anyone believes this should not be talked about here, please either delete it when you see<br/>\nmy name with this subject, or show me a spot where we can talk more about it....besides their<br/>\nwebboards :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThulgar<br/>\nGrand Master of the Mystical Knights<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.efni.com/~thulgar\">http://www.efni.com/~thulgar</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAaron Braunstein wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;         I have read at least two interviews with Brad McQuaid<br/>\n&gt; describing how they view trade skills, and he has explicitly stated<br/>\n&gt; in no uncertain terms that they do not want any of the player trade<br/>\n&gt; skills to be implemented in such a way so as to allow for a player to<br/>\n&gt; purchase items from vendors, execute their skill, and sell the<br/>\n&gt; results of their efforts back to vendors at a profit.  The way they<br/>\n&gt; want it to work is to offer players a &#39;sweet spot&#39; between what they<br/>\n&gt; paid for materials and what NPC vendors charge for an equivilant item<br/>\n&gt; to what a player can make themselves through their tradecraft.  This<br/>\n&gt; way, a player is encouraged to sell their wares at a profit to other<br/>\n&gt; players and not at a loss to vendors.<br/>\n&gt;         In this way, they want to stimulate the &quot;player run economy&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and not a &quot;kick back and make a bunch of plat just interacting with<br/>\n&gt; vendors&quot;-type approach.  I&#39;m not saying I agree with it, I&#39;m just<br/>\n&gt; passing on what I know to be true... not player speculation or rumor,<br/>\n&gt; but actual statements from The Man. :)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
