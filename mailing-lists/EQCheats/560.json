If you plan to get into<br/>\nsmithing,<br/>\n&gt; you will probibly spend around 300-400+ plat to get up to around the 100<br/>\n&gt; lev.  I have not seen any item that can be sold back to npc&#39;s for a<br/>\nprofit.<br/>\n&gt; But when you get up to the lev where you can make banded armor, it is a<br/>\nitem<br/>\n&gt; that other players will buy at a good profit.  Now if they could add in<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; making of weapons I would be realy happy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stretch<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
