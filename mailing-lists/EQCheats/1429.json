We were harassed by players","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-225987892\">Dear Sirs:<br/>\n <br/>\n    We were killing guards inside Neriak&#39;s foreign quarters.  We play on the <br/>\nSolusek Ro server.  I play as Keptin Pike.  We were harassed by players there <br/>\nwho were constantly dispelling us and dumping monsters (guards) on us. In <br/>\nfact they even managed to dump guards on us where Neriak zones to Nektulos  <br/>\nSo we got trapped on both sides of the zone due to monster dumping.  Two of <br/>\nus died. I would like to remind you that we were not killing any vendors or <br/>\nquest related  NPCs.  Also, in the Foreign Quarter there is no danger to <br/>\nnewbies from anything.<br/>\n  GM Hidaeki said this was perfectly legal since they were role-playing.  <br/>\nHmm, I  imagine I can do a lot of harassing and exploiting under the guise of <br/>\nrole-playing.  I asked about the exploit of PVP Switch Avoidance and he <br/>\nignored me.  I have posted said exploit below as  posted on your site.<br/>\n<br/>\nPvP Switch Avoidance ï¿½ using in-game methods to work around the PvP switch <br/>\nand allowing non-PvP players to kill other players, such as hall blocking, <br/>\ndumping of monsters, or spell effects that cross that boundary due to a bug. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease tell me if those players who were killing us fall under this exploit <br/>\nand can be given an official warning.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
