I haven&#39;t done it myself as my Barbarian Warrior hasn&#39;t got high<br/>\nenough faction rating yet(.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat, thanks for posting info! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever... I have talked to this guy before as a little human warrior, he<br/>\nstarts the Strongbear bracers quest. When you hail him he yammers on about<br/>\n[young steel warriors] and [spectators] to the Arena... what are the<br/>\nkeywords having to do with the Hero Bracer?<br/>\n<br/>\nThankfully I know how to raise my faction with them... I will do so tonight<br/>\nwith my higher-level character with the Shackles. Maybe Brin will<br/>\nauto-detect when a high-level character speaks to him and give different<br/>\nkeywords upon hailing? Also... assuming that I have high enough faction, can<br/>\nI just dump the Shackles on him and get the Bracer? Are you sure?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have more info please share, thank you very much. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
