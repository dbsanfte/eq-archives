Getting<br/>\nexcited the guide made my friend promise not to tell and then proceeded to<br/>\ntell him of a cool suit of some kind of magical plate (with some type of<br/>\nelemental enchantment) as well as a hammer that is supposed to be one of the<br/>\nultimate cleric weapons. Im not sure if it is a quest piece for the hammer<br/>\nor the hammer itself but when my friend tried to ask more about it the guide<br/>\nshut up real quick.<br/>\nHe was saying it is held/guarded by an undead knight or ghoul knight about<br/>\n45+ (sk possibly)<br/>\nthe armor is supposed to be light is medium sized and has the elemental<br/>\neffect (defensive offensive is unknown) after hearing this I thought there<br/>\nmay be a good reason to explore kedge keep. If anyone explores or hears<br/>\nanything else let me know.... IM thinking about making a cleric just to go<br/>\ncheck this out.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
