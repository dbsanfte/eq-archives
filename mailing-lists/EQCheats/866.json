There<br/>\naren&#39;t any classes I can think of that can wear both<br/>\nof these items. I guess the GMs decide not to load<br/>\ncharacter limiting items either. If a NPC creature<br/>\nkilled player Wizards in Cazic and could loot, there<br/>\nis a good chance they would get rubicite too. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBelgarth<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MFerrulo@...\">MFerrulo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MFerrulo@...\">MFerrulo@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 8/5/99 4:04:26 PM Eastern<br/>\n&gt; Daylight Time, <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DDiina@...\">DDiina@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; <br/>\n&gt;  Speaking of GM organized events....the other day on<br/>\n&gt; my server (Xegony) a GM<br/>\n&gt;  took over the Tae Archeon in Cazic Thule.....he was<br/>\n&gt; a lvl 50 Wizard and was<br/>\n&gt;  casting Ice Comet.....he killed everybody...no one<br/>\n&gt; lost any exp though which<br/>\n&gt;  was cool....the GM did finally fall to a Lvl 50<br/>\n&gt; Mage named Hast who hangs<br/>\n&gt;  out in CT actually helping people!!! That&#39;s right a<br/>\n&gt; lvl 50 who helps<br/>\n&gt;  people.....anyways  Hast told me he got a FULL set<br/>\n&gt; of rubicite armor and a<br/>\n&gt;  shiny mettalic robe off the GM controlled Tae<br/>\n&gt; Archeon.....WOW is all I could<br/>\n&gt;  say &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why did the GM Wizard have rubicite armor? Can<br/>\n&gt; Wizards can&#39;t wear that stuff <br/>\n&gt; and lvl 50 or not a Wizard would never have the<br/>\n&gt; strength to carry it around <br/>\n&gt; in inventory.
