It costs quite a bit (mostly<br/>\ntime) to make both studs and boning (for reinforced), and it&#39;s much harder<br/>\nto recoupe the money for them then it is for banded (remember those<br/>\nfailures?)  Studs usually have to go for 1p each just to break even (less<br/>\nfor higher level smiths, but they don&#39;t want to waste the time).  So, if<br/>\nsomething takes 3 studs and leather, it&#39;s hardly worth it.  Try to find a<br/>\nsmith that will make you some if you want some.<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PRIMEhero@...\">PRIMEhero@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 6/19/99 3:50:31 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Drew Simonis wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  Does anyone have these stats?
