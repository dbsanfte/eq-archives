It was real and it worked but they<br/>\n&gt; decided not to release because of the threats and<br/>\n&gt; because they said tehy loved the game too much to<br/>\n&gt; make the creators mad. They also said tehy decided<br/>\n&gt; not to release it because the code could make it<br/>\n&gt; possible for cheats to be developed that would take<br/>\n&gt; advantage of the real EQ servers and they didn&#39;t want<br/>\n&gt; to ruin the game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It was called Emuq and the link to the website was:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.swileys.com/emuq/\">http://www.swileys.com/emuq/</a><br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if anything about it is still there or<br/>\n&gt; not.
