If it then continues, they can be cited or arrested.  If this happens (after police warnings) THEN you may take civil action against them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Oh, BTW, you might have just LOST your case because you decided to openly discuss (and possibly slander/liable) the case and the defendant (also giving out HIS private Email address) online!  Your lawyer (if you actually have one) should have told you all about this!!  Oh, and BTW, you can&#39;t use a lawyer in Small Claims court either...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\n  Proud member of Platinum Sphere Guild - www.platinumsphere.com<br/>\n<br/>\n    ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n    From: Nick <br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n    Sent: Wednesday, August 04, 1999 10:36 AM<br/>\n    Subject: [EQCheats] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Well, I warned this person to stop emailing me.  As per my lawyers request I had warned him before not to email me or a proof reading fee would be exempted to his university/his parents.  He sent me an email this morning that was lengthy and I didn&#39;t even bother reading it.  Again (to the people of the list), do not send me private emails.  Mr. Clark is going to have to go to small claims court because of his actions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
