Especially<br/>\nsince I can then only gain 26 hit points and 5 of each<br/>\nskill.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some people that do nothing other than play<br/>\nEverquest, not surprising they are level 50. After I<br/>\nwould reach level 50 I would try another class. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the game should have been designed with a<br/>\nhigher cap, say 100 and spread the skill points over<br/>\nthat range. <br/>\n<br/>\nImagine people that can&#39;t play 20 hours a week, say 5<br/>\nhours a week due to work, school and family<br/>\nconstraints. then you have to go 2 weeks at your same<br/>\nlevel. <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of it goes along with not enjoying my ranger<br/>\nanymore. I am level 26, near broke and half my armor<br/>\nis banded because Rubicite is the next level since we<br/>\ncan&#39;t wear any normal plate. I will probably start a<br/>\ncleric and see how it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelgarth <br/>\n<br/>\n--- Lemac Justerian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Lemac Justerian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You think that 8-10 hours is &quot;a bit much&quot; to gain a<br/>\n&gt; level??  I play about 20<br/>\n&gt; hours a week (on average) and gain about 1-2 levels,<br/>\n&gt; which is about right...<br/>\n&gt; if it was half that, then instead of being a level<br/>\n&gt; 22 now, I would probably<br/>\n&gt; already be up to 50!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I kinda thought that most people level up pretty<br/>\n&gt; fast myself... hehe... Who<br/>\n&gt; would have thought that just 3 months into this<br/>\n&gt; online game we would have<br/>\n&gt; Level 50 players, and 4 months in, that we would<br/>\n&gt; have TONS of them, and many<br/>\n&gt; more level 40+ players!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I really didn&#39;t expect to reach level 50 for about a<br/>\n&gt; year (at 20 hrs a week<br/>\n&gt; that is about right too, it seems) so I think things<br/>\n&gt; are pretty good<br/>\n&gt; myself... I know many people are more interested in<br/>\n&gt; leveling up as fast as<br/>\n&gt; they can, but tell me, what do you do after you have<br/>\n&gt; reached level 50 and<br/>\n&gt; have played at that level for a month or more?  I<br/>\n&gt; think I would get pretty<br/>\n&gt; bored with it...<br/>\n&gt; Lemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\n&gt; Proud member of Platinum Sphere Guild -<br/>\n&gt; www.platinumsphere.com </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
