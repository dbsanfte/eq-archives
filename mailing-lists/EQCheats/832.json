This could be said about anything, my friend (the IQ test comment).<br/>\n <br/>\nPersonally, this whole conversation is not needed. All I have to say about<br/>\nit is this: Nick, no one cares about this but you. And, where I&#39;m wrong<br/>\nabout this, the only other people that care are those that want to prove you<br/>\nwrong. <br/>\n <br/>\nCan we please just stop this conversation? The laptop thread I was fine<br/>\nwith. Not that I read much of it, but it had some good info in the thread.<br/>\nNick&#39;s &quot;bitch&quot; thread is way overdue to die.

Ever<br/>\nhear about Message Rules?  You can have emails BLOCKED you know.  Now, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know what that person wrote to you,  But there&#39;s nothing really a<br/>\ncourt can do about this.  I know. I work for a ISP, and just about all you<br/>\ncan do is get there account terminated from that ISP.  Now if I was getting<br/>\ncrap mail like that.  It&#39;s going right to my Blocked list to be deleted of<br/>\nthe server.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n*wishes people had to take a IQ test to be able to get on the internet*<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Nick &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brutalny@...\">brutalny@...</a>&gt;  <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&gt;  <br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 04, 1999 1:36 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQCheats] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I warned this person to stop emailing me.  As per my lawyers request I<br/>\nhad warned him before not to email me or a proof reading fee would be<br/>\nexempted to his university/his parents.  He sent me an email this morning<br/>\nthat was lengthy and I didn&#39;t even bother reading it.  Again (to the people<br/>\nof the list), do not send me private emails.  Mr. Clark is going to have to<br/>\ngo to small claims court because of his actions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
