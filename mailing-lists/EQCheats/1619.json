Going in<br/>\nwithout enchanters to mez them, you&#39;ll all die or evac if you try to pull<br/>\nPhin.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, two FULL SOLID groups should be able to do it, but it&#39;d be<br/>\nrough I think. There are like 10 guardians aruodn him,l with like a 20<br/>\nminute spawn time (this is last time I went on a raid, which was 1-2 months<br/>\nago). Level 47-49 warrior guardians, that summon.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got a buggy pull and pulled 5 guardians at once. We had 4+ full groups,<br/>\nall 45+. Half of us died, other half evac&#39;d. We never even got close to<br/>\npulling Phin. I think you need to kill off a few guardians quick, then pull<br/>\nPhin and friends, and mes all but Phin. I wouldn&#39;t try to charm a swirlspine<br/>\n(don&#39;t think you can, too high level), but if you did, as soon as that charm<br/>\nbreaks, that enchanter is a dead person.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps, and let us know how it goes, and how you did what you did<br/>\n(fail or succeed).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Leod, 50th Shaman on Fennin Ro, Sterling Order of Knights<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mferrulo@...\">mferrulo@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mferrulo@...\">mferrulo@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: March 23, 2000 3:24 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQCheats] Phinegal in KK<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mferrulo@...\">mferrulo@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHail friends,<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight me some of my guildmates will attempt to take down Phinegal in KK.  <br/>\nAnyone have any good advice or tips?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only specific question I have is, about how many 40 plus or 46 plus<br/>\nfolks <br/>\nwill be needed to take Phinegal down?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other advice would be appreciated as well, I have only been as far as<br/>\nthe <br/>\nSS Guards myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizaro Wrathcaster<br/>\n44th Flame of Sol Ro&#39;s Fire<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nDON&#39;T HATE YOUR RATE!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
