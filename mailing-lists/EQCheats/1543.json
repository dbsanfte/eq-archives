A great way to <br/>\n&gt;raise your faction is to give gnoll fangs to Lysbeth McNaff in sets of <br/>\n&gt;three. She is at the Pit of Doom.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I believe that you need more than just amiable, but not so much that it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;warmly, so somewhere inbetween the two.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Aye.. that is exactly what ye do ta check yer faction...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Sent: Friday, October 29, 1999 8:44 AM<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Subject: [EQCheats] Jared: Why you have to be that way??<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Does anybody know what faction (amiable, warmly, etc) that you need with <br/>\n&gt;&gt;the Halas merchants to perform the Langseax quests???<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I spent about 3 hours running around Black Burrow the last couple of days, <br/>\n&gt;&gt;killing anything that moved.  It seems like one out of about 10 gnolls <br/>\n&gt;&gt;drops a Gnoll Tooth (fang??).  I&#39;ve collected 38 of them...killed maybe <br/>\n&gt;&gt;300 - 400 gnolls.  Tedious...VERY tedious.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Anyway...I was going to try the Langseax quest next time I can get<br/>\n&gt;&gt;together with my Druid friend (for tracking and SoW...heard this is useful <br/>\n&gt;&gt;for following the dog during the quest)...but I was hoping somebody could <br/>\n&gt;&gt;give me an idea of what faction will work so I&#39;m not wasting (any more) <br/>\n&gt;&gt;time.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Sean<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tha faction ya need is a &quot;high&quot; amiable.  Jist use tha test mentioned above <br/>\nta make sure ye kin do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nArrrggghh! Ah wish Ah could ramember tha exact kind but Ah thin&#39; it&#39;s &quot;a <br/>\npatrolling gnoll&quot; that has tha teeth most of tha time.  While Ah&#39;ve looted <br/>\nteeth/fangs from most everykind, Ah noticed tha patrolling gnolls seemed to <br/>\nhuv them more often than not.  After Ah realized this Ah started huntin&#39; <br/>\njist them.  Found Ah didn&#39; waste as much time after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh don&#39; thin&#39; trackin&#39; is really needed (Ah&#39;ve done tha quest more than a <br/>\ndozen times an&#39; never used a tracker) but a SoW is a MUST!  That wolf sure <br/>\ncan run!  It&#39;s almost as if he&#39;s got a SoW... err.. OK... he does huv one... <br/>\nafter all he is a Wolf :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when ye turn in tha teeth/fangs, ye don&#39;t HUV to turn them in 3 at a <br/>\ntime.. it&#39;s just that tha exp an&#39; faction is given on every 3rd tooth/fang.  <br/>\nWhat Ah suggest ye do is turn them in 1 at a time until ye git tha <br/>\nexp/faction.  After that, start turnin&#39; in 3 at a time.  Reason why is if <br/>\nsomeboady turned in an &quot;extra&quot; tooth/fang, ye only need ta turn in 2 more <br/>\nfur tha exp/faction.<br/>\n<br/>\nLincus<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
