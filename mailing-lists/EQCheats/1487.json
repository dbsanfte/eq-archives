I can see the use for certain situations like the newbie food/stein <br/>\nquest and even the PoF armor (I know i would go absolutly insane if i saw a <br/>\nlvl 3 ranger in full thorny vine). But there are times when its absolutly <br/>\ninsane to make somthing no drop...like the micro servos in steemfront  I <br/>\nuset to be able to get a micro servo along with the treant bow staff and the <br/>\ndwarven wire (also no drop now...i just destroyed 11 spolls of it cause i <br/>\ncouldnt do anything with it now) to a fletcher along with maby 10pp and they <br/>\ntry the trueshot bow for me. Now i cant do that and i have to buy the bow <br/>\nfrom sombody who has gathered all of the components and who can fletch.<br/>\nOther no drop items puzzle me. The Order of thunder medalion is off of <br/>\nDrosco who is about lvl 5 in the qeynos aquaducts. Its +5chr 2ac  Prety nice <br/>\nbut i no longer have any use for it...why cant i give it away or sell it?<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:    &quot;Selling a Order of thunder Medalion  +5chr 2ac&quot;<br/>\nBuyer: &quot;I could use the added charisma and I dont have time to waste<br/>\n        in the aquaducts looking for drosco...I will take it&quot;<br/>\nMe:    &quot;How is 2pp?&quot;<br/>\nBuyer: &quot;I have 2pp to spare...Sure!&quot;<br/>\nMe:    &lt;Strugeling&gt; &quot;I cant seem to pry it from my<br/>\n       hands!....GRRRRR...I cant seem to let go. Its as if some<br/>\n       ungodly force wants me to keep this absolutly useless item<br/>\n       with me or destroy it&quot;<br/>\nBuyer: &quot;Oh well...I will go spend my time camping Drosco...Even<br/>\n        though he was green to me at least 20 levels ago!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about gnoll fangs...these used to be dropable...if you didnt want em you <br/>\ntosed em on the ground or auctioned them away for a few silver each. Now, <br/>\neven though you dont want them, some force poseses you to hold on to them. <br/>\nThe only way to get rid of them is by crusing them and uterly destroying <br/>\nthem. What was wrong with buying/trading gnoll fangs? It was a good way for <br/>\nyou to raise qeynos faction. All you get is a moonstone worth a few silver <br/>\nwhich you could turn in for a BB stout worth a silver or 2 more. Hardly good <br/>\nmoney after lvl 5!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that realy anoys me are the quest items that have no details on <br/>\nthem and hence need to be identified but alas they are no drop! The other <br/>\nday I got 2 LORE  NO DROP &quot;Bone Chips&quot; off of 2 dread corpses chacing a low <br/>\nlvl player. What are they for?  maby if i could have them identified i could <br/>\nfigure out!<br/>\n<br/>\nTrevalien</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
