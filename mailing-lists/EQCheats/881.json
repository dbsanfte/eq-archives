He was asked about anti-camp zones specificaly and he said that while<br/>\nthey were thinking about it or testing it in beta they did not implement any<br/>\nanti-camp code.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy take on all this is just crappy randomness in the game. Multiple fizzles<br/>\nand resists are more common than isolated or alternating ones, the best<br/>\nchance to get a rare loot, if you were betting on it, is on the very next<br/>\nspawn than some random numbe of spawns.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t camp all that much but so far I&#39;ve seen that if say the mean item<br/>\ndrop time is 8 hours what really happens is the item might be dropped 2-3<br/>\ntimes in rapid succession within 4 hours (rapid?) then nothing for 20-24<br/>\nhours. This is for relatively normal item not the super rare items like the<br/>\nGBS.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have seen:<br/>\n<br/>\nTae Templar not spawn for 2 day, throne room was being cleared all the time.<br/>\nnext day my friends got 3 rubi legs in 3 consecutive spawns.<br/>\n<br/>\nAoF spawning infrequently and dropping only 1 tunic in about 12 hours then<br/>\nback to back AoF within 20 min and both dropping tunics. During the same<br/>\ntime the Cenobyte spawns pretty regularly for 3 days straight but never a<br/>\npair of boots on him.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT these and your observations are pure speculation you have to spend a<br/>\nstatistically significant time observing a spawn and need to know the spawn<br/>\nrules for that specific mob that verant has put in to tell if either there<br/>\nis anti-camp code (no there isn&#39;t) or if their random number generator is<br/>\nflawed (yes it is). I have no desire to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Was wondering where you get your info from? I have spoken with GM&#39;s and<br/>\n&gt; guides alike - there IS anti-camping coding in the game. They&#39;re just not<br/>\n&gt; implemented everywhere! You need to figure out where they are.
