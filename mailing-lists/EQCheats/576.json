That alone will save you a<br/>\nlot<br/>\nof money, not a lot of time, but a lot of money. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWould someone please tell me where to find ore besides buying it?  I&#39;m a<br/>\n17th level ranger so finding it on a rare 30th level spawn in the bottom<br/>\nof some dungeon is pretty useless.  Nonetheless, where is it to be found<br/>\nat all?<br/>\n<br/>\nLeatherwood<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCreate a list for FRIENDS & FAMILY...<br/>\n...and YOU can WIN $100 to Amazon.com.
