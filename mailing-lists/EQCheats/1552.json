I come frmo the old<br/>\ndays.....when Fennin Ro was new... It took my warrior until level 15 to get<br/>\nfull banded. That you even have 20 plat at level 10 is a ton compared to<br/>\nwhere I was. That you actually have 70 at level 7 is insane.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, just ranting... The economy is so whacked....now I can make 150pp a<br/>\nnight easy... *sigh* I&#39;m a little higher level that you, but still, whatever<br/>\nyour doing sounds fine to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Leod<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Omeg Felligan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:omeg_felligan@...\">omeg_felligan@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: November 08, 1999 6:04 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQCheats] Making Plat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Omeg Felligan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:omeg_felligan@...\">omeg_felligan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, anyone have any ways to make plat with some amount of speed?  I&#39;m a <br/>\nlevel 7(almost 8) Erudite Mage saving for a large item (Flowing Black Robe, <br/>\nand other expensive stuff).  I have about 70 Plat so far and was wondering <br/>\nif anyone had a way of making plat other than &quot;have your high lvl get it <br/>\nthen...&quot; b/c I don&#39;t have any high levels on this server :).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nOmeg<br/>\n<br/>\nGet paid to surf the web!
