I am helping my enchanter friend with<br/>\n&gt;  the quest, and I was wondering.. If I get the items at the same time, ie <br/>\n&gt;she<br/>\n&gt;  has one set and i have my own.. if by the end of the quest, i can give <br/>\n&gt;her<br/>\n&gt;  the stuff I&#39;ve got and she can complete it for me.. or is any of the <br/>\n&gt;stuff<br/>\n&gt;  No drop ? This way she can get a stein and I can get a stein also ? Oh <br/>\n&gt;yeah<br/>\n&gt;  i am high elf mage, so I know I can&#39;t get the item myself..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Thanks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Reuben<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah huvn&#39;t done the quest in a long time but tha last time Ah did it weeks <br/>\n(since before tha quest was ever spoiled on any of tha popular spoiler <br/>\nsites), 3 of the 4 items to git the No Drop book were Lore an&#39; none were No <br/>\nDrop.  Yer friend would huv to then turn in her set of ingriediants ta git <br/>\ntha No Drop book.  Ye kin then give her yer set.  She would then need ta do <br/>\ntha final leg of tha quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, Ah had suggested on another list along time ago that tha quest needed <br/>\nto be made harder by makin&#39; the fish a No Drop item.  Ah huv since heard <br/>\nthat, that may huv been done.  Whether it was done one tha test server or <br/>\nall of the productions servers, Ah don&#39; know it&#39;s been many.<br/>\n<br/>\nLincus<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
