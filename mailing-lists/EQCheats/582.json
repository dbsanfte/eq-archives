Sounds like what they did to fletching, raised<br/>\n&gt; skill check by 600%. People with 190+ fletching were<br/>\n&gt; instant gods of bowmaking. It would cost 1000s of<br/>\n&gt; platinum to get there now.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You have hit the nail on the head in many ways.  All of the downward<br/>\n&gt; tweaks such as skill costs, decreasing the spawn frequency of camped<br/>\n&gt; NPCs, and lowering treasure found on critters works against new<br/>\n&gt; players.  It entrenches the old players who have moved up under the old<br/>\n&gt; system and prevents the new players from getting there at all, or at<br/>\n&gt; least makes the journey more arduous and less satisfying.  McQuaid said<br/>\n&gt; he is not going to tweak the game in such a manner as to make the game<br/>\n&gt; too hard for casual players in response to the 24/7 no-life junkies<br/>\n&gt; hollering that things are too easy or capped out.  However it seems he<br/>\n&gt; is moving slightly in that direction nonetheless.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This constant hardening of the system is exactly why I left DragonRealms<br/>\n&gt; to play EQ after nearly 3 years.  The game got to the point where it was<br/>\n&gt; impossible for a casual player to advance his character or make any<br/>\n&gt; money.  I was at the point where at 40th level it was taking 300 hours<br/>\n&gt; or more hours of constant work to make a level.  If Verant moves too far<br/>\n&gt; down this road EQ will whither and die just like DR is.  Then we will<br/>\n&gt; move on to the next game until it gets too difficult to be fun anymore.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Etc., etc., etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Leatherwood<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Transfer your big list to ONElist and earn $500!<br/>\n&gt; For program details, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
