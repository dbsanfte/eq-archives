In order for someone to bind you, two conditions<br/>\nmust be met. First and foremost, they have to be in your party. Being in<br/>\nyour party means you trust them (or that you are a frickin idiot to join<br/>\ntheir party without knowing them) and give consent. The second condition<br/>\nis that a spellcaster can only bind people in city areas (Highhold Pass<br/>\nis considered a city however).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you have a pet and someone makes you invisible, the pet goes away.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This works on all classes cept Necromancers, which you have to use<br/>\nInvisible to Undead on. Most consider it an exploit, I think it&#39;s just<br/>\ndamn clever.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nDid you know that ONElist hosts some of the largest lists on the Internet?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nOur scaleable system is the most reliable free e-mail service on the <br/>\nInternet!<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net <br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
