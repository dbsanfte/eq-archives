The way EQ is set up, any<br/>\n&gt; modifications you make are reflected in YOUR computer&#39;s memory,<br/>\n&gt; and maybe even your display, but NOT on veran&#39;ts server. You<br/>\n&gt; FEED commands to Verant, the actions are resolved on the server,<br/>\n&gt; and the RESULTS are sent back to you. You may modify the commands<br/>\n&gt; sent, or the results on your screen, and it won&#39;t change what<br/>\n&gt; happens to your character on verants servers at all. It is a great<br/>\n&gt; way to preclude tampering. You may change your screen to show<br/>\n&gt; 50000pp, but try to buy something.... The next screen update will<br/>\n&gt; show your real totals... Your character and all interaction with it<br/>\n&gt; are done BY Verant on their own servers. You have NO real contact with<br/>\n&gt; anything that must be modified for any kind of cheat to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>aye, the best you could do would be... stop/start the rain... change night / day....<br/>\nand stuff like that. but no permanent changes in your character at all. Maybe, but<br/>\njust maybe you could get rid of root, blind and spells like that ... just intercept the<br/>\nserver feed using some program to tunnel it and remove/add commands from the<br/>\nfeed , the server would think you are rooted but since your EQ client didnt recieve<br/>\nthe command to root you it would let you move freely.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts kinda easy to do this kind of stuff... it isnt a MAJOR hack since it wont change<br/>\nexp, stats, items and stuff like that but it would give you BIG advantage in PvP.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts kida easy to do that if you know how to play around with sockets and have control<br/>\nof a DNS server (since the update server name and all the other servers names are hard<br/>\ncoded and/or sent through TCP/UDP stream, you need a way to make your EQ client belive<br/>\nhe is connecting in the server while its actually connecting in your local machine)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, its easy to avoid this kind of cheat using any kind of encrypted stream (which would<br/>\nincrease lag) or any kind of security keys to let the server know if its really talking with your<br/>\nEQ client or with any other third party software tunneling the stream.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut does anyone ever tryed that and know how good Verant&#39;s security really is ? I dont have<br/>\nthe time and I really dont feel like giving all the effort to cheat EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I welcome any questions or comments....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ATTN ONELIST USERS: stay current on the latest activities,<br/>\n&gt; programs, & features at ONElist by joining our member newsletter at<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce</a> &quot;&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net goto www.everquest.com<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\n _____        _   _       _  _   _<br/>\n|  __ &#92;  ___ | &#92;_/ | ___ (_)| &#92; | | Jo�o Assad<br/>\n| |  &#92; |/ _ &#92;|  _  |/ _ &#92;| ||  &#92;| | Depto de Opera��es<br/>\n| |__/ | &lt;_&gt; | | | | &lt;_| | || |&#92;  | ------------------------<br/>\n|_____/ &#92;___/|_| |_|&#92;__,_|_||_| &#92;_| <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.domain.com.br\">http://www.domain.com.br</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
