It&#39;s not as bad now that no drop items<br/>\ncan be banked, but it is still frustrating as hell to get a really cool no drop item that&#39;s unusable<br/>\nto you because of race/class restrictions. Especially if you know someone who would gladly buy it<br/>\nfrom you if they were online when you got it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo Drop has it&#39;s place. I heard that it was implemented to prevent newbies from banking their newbie<br/>\nfood and duping it by dying a few times when the food respawns during the first 3 lvls of a<br/>\ncharacter. I also think that making some quest items No Drop is perfectly acceptable. (Like the<br/>\nchanges that were added to the Stein Quest.) Jboots being no drop I am not sure about. Seems to me<br/>\nlike that was a &quot;quick fix&quot; to reduce camping. Which obviously didn&#39;t work very well, just increased<br/>\nthe camping. So now it&#39;s been moved to a quest item. (Which I give Verant the benefit of the doubt<br/>\nand assume that was the long term goal. Instead of finding that their first fix didn&#39;t work so now<br/>\nthey are gonna try another.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut making any and every cool item No Drop is pointless. Especially when Verant is making such a big<br/>\ndeal about a &quot;Player based Economy&quot;. If they want people to buy/sell/trade with each other then just<br/>\nabout EVERYTHING should be something you can sell to another player. At the very least let mechant&#39;s<br/>\nbuy No Drop items (Like those stupid burnt out lightstones from wisps, what the hell are they doing<br/>\nas No DropP? a quest?) and sell them to other players.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my No Drop rant :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Clanretri@...\">Clanretri@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Clanretri@...\">Clanretri@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s good that they making more armors for each class than just one for all.<br/>\n&gt; and the worst thing they could&#39;ve done is making ruby no drop.  What&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; point of playing a game if everything is nodrop?!  THINK<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; gaga, wonders how some ppl thinks. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
