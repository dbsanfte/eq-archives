I&#39;m guessing Polar Bears do but we<br/>\n: all know that EQ doesn&#39;t need to make sense all the time :).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need a Polar Bear Skin, they are white in colour. You can get them from<br/>\nPolar Bear Cubs as well. Give one skin and 5 plat to Karg, he will give you<br/>\na Cloak. Be SURE you hail Karg before turning in each plat/skin combo, as if<br/>\nhe starts moving during the trade you will lose your items.<br/>\n<br/>\n: and...does anyone know how much these skins/pelts go for if I were to go<br/>\n: there and auction to buy them (save on hunting time).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can buy them from merchants (if someone has sold them) for less than 3<br/>\ngp.<br/>\n<br/>\n: Well, not exactly...whenever they patch or server goes down for some<br/>\nreason<br/>\n: the merchant inventory is reset so all those bat wings get super glued<br/>\nback<br/>\n: onto rats to make more bats I guess.  Well, at anyrate I&#39;m guessing that<br/>\nthe<br/>\n: selling bat wings would work right after a new patch and for a few days<br/>\n: after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe merchants I&#39;m referring to sell bat wings for 14 copper all the time,<br/>\nthey always have them in stock. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
