Even over 15 min<br/>\nafter battle game interface didnt function. I was able to walk using<br/>\nkeyboard, turn around with mouse, but no hotkey or spell were working.<br/>\nScreen mode switching too, and i havnt been even able to camp because i<br/>\nplay in &quot;full screen&quot; mode and camp button was unreachable. That<br/>\nhappened to me 3 times, all times i was combating with necromancers and<br/>\nenchanters. I believe problem is some enchanter spell, because i was<br/>\nfighting with necros many times and only if enchanter was nearby i was<br/>\nfacing such problem. I was feared and charmed before and it never cause<br/>\nme such problems, so single charm or fear is ok. Maybe some combo can<br/>\ncause this, like fear+charm or fear+root or something like it. I believe<br/>\nenchanter spell of 8-12 lvl is required to cause such problems, because<br/>\nin fights against 20+ lvl enchanters i never experienced this problem,<br/>\nonly in fights with 8-12 lvl ones. BTW, my friend was in same situation<br/>\neven more times than me, and he also crashed to Windows once, and once<br/>\nwas forced to reset his computer. We have written alot of petitions<br/>\nabout these bugs but none of them were answered.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
