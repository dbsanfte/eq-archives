Most hybrids take this cut, so what makes them<br/>\nso special?  I could see getting a great weapon that is good against undead,<br/>\nor something to that affect, but as I understand it, Fiery Avenger is the<br/>\nbest weapon in the whole game.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2coppers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWenaddar<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tTim West [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:twest@...\">twest@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tMonday, June 28, 1999 1:53 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [EQCheats] Digest Number 36<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Tim West&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:twest@...\">twest@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It has been confirmed on the Holyswords list that Fiery Avenger is a Holy<br/>\n&gt; Sword and is therefore a Paladin only weapon.  The character that holding<br/>\n&gt; the sword in the picture is a GM and that is why he can hold it.  The fact<br/>\n&gt; that Paladins get the Holy Swords and no one else is to make up for the<br/>\n&gt; fact that we get 20% less exp. per kill.  Paladins also are not great<br/>\n&gt; fighters like the Warriors, nor are we great healers or buffers like the<br/>\n&gt; Clerics.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tanaman<br/>\n&gt; Lev 15 Paladin<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan Server.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\n&gt; goto www.everquest.com </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
