The way they <br/>\nwant it to work is to offer players a &#39;sweet spot&#39; between what they <br/>\npaid for materials and what NPC vendors charge for an equivilant item <br/>\nto what a player can make themselves through their tradecraft.  This <br/>\nway, a player is encouraged to sell their wares at a profit to other <br/>\nplayers and not at a loss to vendors.<br/>\n\tIn this way, they want to stimulate the &quot;player run economy&quot; <br/>\nand not a &quot;kick back and make a bunch of plat just interacting with <br/>\nvendors&quot;-type approach.  I&#39;m not saying I agree with it, I&#39;m just <br/>\npassing on what I know to be true... not player speculation or rumor, <br/>\nbut actual statements from The Man. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
