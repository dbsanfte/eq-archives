With","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1239421362\">You have to purchase a ruby from an NPC jewel merchant.  So far, every<br/>\nattempt to use any other ruby (there is one off a fish in Rivervale) has<br/>\nfailed.  With the exception of killing Lynguna herself, since she usually<br/>\ndrops a ruby.  (Seems kinda wierd to kill a unique NPC, get their loot, then<br/>\ntake it back to them in their next life).  In case it&#39;s not obvious, Lynguna<br/>\nwill KOS any non-evil race.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe midnight mallet and Brutechopper have similar stats.  Atk 14 & 15<br/>\nrespectively, and dly 47 & 48 respectively.  The weight on both is around 11<br/>\nI think.  The midnight mallet has 5 charges of waking sleep.  Whether or not<br/>\nit can be recharged I do not know.  Some say it&#39;s 5 per day, but I&#39;m almost<br/>\ncertain that is incorrect... since I have one, and it&#39;s been sitting at 4<br/>\ncharges for a long time (many in-game days)  I do not know if the<br/>\nbrutechopper has a magical effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know about the Brutechopper, but the MM can only be used by shamans<br/>\nor dwarven clerics.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks veyr large when holding it.  My troll was standing next to a<br/>\nhalfling last night and the head of the mallet was almost as large as the<br/>\nhalfling was.  The sucky thing tho is that it uses the attack animation for<br/>\na 2H staff.  The little half-swipe-poke move.  Which looks stupid with this<br/>\ngiant hammer.  I was really looking forward to a big over-head smash<br/>\nanimation once I got the mallet.  I put in a feedback for it, but I know<br/>\nit&#39;ll never happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve hit for 26 damage with it.  It&#39;s a little slower than the rts.  Not<br/>\ntwice as slow, or even half again as slow.  So if you&#39;ve got all your dex<br/>\nand strength buffs going, you&#39;ll hit hard a lot.  Ratio-wise it&#39;s identical<br/>\nto the glowing wooden crook.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m on the innoruk server, and I&#39;ll sell mine cheap to anybody who wants to<br/>\nbuy it.  The price is 100pp.  Why am I selling it?  Mostly because my<br/>\nplaystyle doesn&#39;t involve melee that much.  (despite what people say,<br/>\nshamans are only slightly above _suck_ in melee because their skillcap is<br/>\nlower)  I&#39;ve also got a round of spells coming up and I seriously need to<br/>\nupgrade my armor.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kzak  lvl 14, Innoruk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;robert nunez&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:homenunez@...\">homenunez@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry let me say this again i meant the  MIDNIGHT MALLET<br/>\n<br/>\nand if so how do i go about getting it?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
