YES<br/>\nwizards CAN kite!!! There are on average 10 to 15 plus druid and/or shamans<br/>\nin the area at any given time. And it is quite easy to have a constant<br/>\nsow...  Playing there was amazingly great.. Even when there were 40 plus ppl<br/>\nin the zone i didnt have much trouble gaining xp fast. And the loot is<br/>\ngreat. When high enough to kill avocets, the hardest aviaks there... you get<br/>\ngreat loot, they sometimes drop black pearls worth 50 plus pp to other<br/>\nplayers. and other assorted jewels that sell for 10 to 15 pp at a npc. And<br/>\nthe zone rathe zone is near incase of trouble. There is even an aviak<br/>\nmerchant that will sell to some ppl. I know it wont sell to gnomes.. dont<br/>\nknow what other races it dislikes though. And best of all, aviaks have NO<br/>\nFACTION hits! And for those new to kiting, dont be afraid to try to kite a<br/>\nyellow or red... If you smack it and it turns out it resists to much just<br/>\nhit the zone, and you&#39;ll know from then on... If not, then rack in the xp!<br/>\n<br/>\nWes Lobdell,<br/>\nQuote: &quot;The certain proof that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the<br/>\nuniverse <br/>\nis that no one has bothered to make contact with us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Omeg Felligan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:omeg_felligan@...\">omeg_felligan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, July 21, 1999 12:56 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQCheats] power level to X?/kiting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Omeg Felligan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:omeg_felligan@...\">omeg_felligan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shaman&#39;s are the best kiters right?
