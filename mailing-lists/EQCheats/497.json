But I was once in<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; group where every person got charmed but me, the monk in the party<br/>\n&gt; tried the<br/>\n&gt; sitting trick and it successfully slowed her down.  Enough that she<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; cause too many problems for the rest of the party.  But I don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; canceled the charm.  I feel that further testing is required.  Maybe a<br/>\n&gt; couple of people on the list with the ability to charm can try it with<br/>\n&gt; some<br/>\n&gt; friends?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On a related note:  On that foray against the evil eye....  The other<br/>\n&gt; 5<br/>\n&gt; people all got charmed in our group...  they started attacking while I<br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt; AFK, so I got there halfway through the battle.  I unloaded all my<br/>\n&gt; manna at<br/>\n&gt; the eye and successfully killed it.  I got an experience message, but<br/>\n&gt; nobody<br/>\n&gt; else in the group did.  My current theory is that once you are<br/>\n&gt; charmed, you<br/>\n&gt; count as a monster, and won&#39;t get the experience message for any group<br/>\n&gt; kills<br/>\n&gt; during that time.  Unfortunately, this is also hard to test.<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately<br/>\n&gt; that mishap resulted in the death of more than half our party... but<br/>\n&gt; when I<br/>\n&gt; looked at my XP-o-meter, I got a huge chunk of XP from the fight (if<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; theory is correct, I got all of the XP)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Kzak<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; When fighting evil eyes in the gorge the other night, I hit the sit<br/>\n&gt; button<br/>\n&gt; while charmed somehow. The result was canceling the charm, which<br/>\n&gt; allowed me<br/>\n&gt; to continue with my battle. I managed to do this repeatedly throughout<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; night. This could be a coincidence or an actual bug in the game, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; sure. Since I felt it was cheating, I quit doing it and left the<br/>\n&gt; gorge;<br/>\n&gt; after all, I only wanted another Polished Bone Bracer ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; If you join ONElist&#39;s FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
