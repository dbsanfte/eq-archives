BTW i&#39;m agnostic so basically everyone in nerriak/grobb <br/>\nand Oggok are dubious to me.. and you know DE&#39;s in freeport and other <br/>\ntowns... so in all my searching i have found ONE quest that i can actually <br/>\ndo.. that being the sro research quest (which last time i checked was broken <br/>\nanyway..) i&#39;m really just looking for things like that, that can bring me <br/>\nback into the game truely having fun.. even if it means restarting a <br/>\ncharacter on another server.. (i tried this on Tallon zek.. and 200+ people <br/>\nin nek forest looking for every last moss snake is no fun.. neither is having <br/>\nyour life savings stollen from you by a lev 8 human who jumps you while your <br/>\nhunting, 1/8 a bub from lev 4....) anyone have any ideas on things i can do?  <br/>\nOr even a server or guild that i might be able to join that adds more fun and <br/>\nRPing for the game?  anything you have to say would be verry appreciated...<br/>\n<br/>\nMagis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Gizmo115@...\">Gizmo115@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
