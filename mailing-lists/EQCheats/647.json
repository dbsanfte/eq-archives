Especially<br/>\n&gt; since I can then only gain 26 hit points and 5 of each<br/>\n&gt; skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are some people that do nothing other than play<br/>\n&gt; Everquest, not surprising they are level 50. After I<br/>\n&gt; would reach level 50 I would try another class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think the game should have been designed with a<br/>\n&gt; higher cap, say 100 and spread the skill points over<br/>\n&gt; that range.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Imagine people that can&#39;t play 20 hours a week, say 5<br/>\n&gt; hours a week due to work, school and family<br/>\n&gt; constraints. then you have to go 2 weeks at your same<br/>\n&gt; level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Part of it goes along with not enjoying my ranger<br/>\n&gt; anymore. I am level 26, near broke and half my armor<br/>\n&gt; is banded because Rubicite is the next level since we<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t wear any normal plate. I will probably start a<br/>\n&gt; cleric and see how it goes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Belgarth<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- Lemac Justerian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Lemac Justerian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You think that 8-10 hours is &quot;a bit much&quot; to gain a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level??  I play about 20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hours a week (on average) and gain about 1-2 levels,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which is about right...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if it was half that, then instead of being a level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 22 now, I would probably<br/>\n&gt; &gt; already be up to 50!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I kinda thought that most people level up pretty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fast myself... hehe... Who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would have thought that just 3 months into this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; online game we would have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Level 50 players, and 4 months in, that we would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have TONS of them, and many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more level 40+ players!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I really didn&#39;t expect to reach level 50 for about a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; year (at 20 hrs a week<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that is about right too, it seems) so I think things<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are pretty good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself... I know many people are more interested in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; leveling up as fast as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they can, but tell me, what do you do after you have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reached level 50 and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have played at that level for a month or more?  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think I would get pretty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bored with it...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Proud member of Platinum Sphere Guild -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; www.platinumsphere.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com!<br/>\n&gt; If you join ONElist&#39;s FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
