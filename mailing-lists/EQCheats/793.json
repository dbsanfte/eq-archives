As a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1919057476\">Yup, that&#39;s what I meant. Sorry, if I wasn&#39;t clear about that. I am one of those<br/>\npeople that get used to hotkeys and rarely ever want them to change. As a result<br/>\ncommon button maps for common clases are really good for me. I get really aggravated<br/>\nwhen I keep hitting the spell book hotkey when I mean to be hitting taunt or<br/>\nsomething like that. Even better example is the necro /pet commands. You don&#39;t wanna<br/>\nbe hitting the wrong buttons in a dungeon. =) Another thing to note, If you do the<br/>\nsame name over several servers then monkeying around with the hot buttons will have<br/>\nthe same effect for ALL characters for that name. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a bug or what,<br/>\nbut I was messing around with an alternate character on the Fennin Ro server (E marr<br/>\nwas down again.. go figure) and now that character&#39;s hot buttons ALWAYS disappear no<br/>\nmatter what server I login to. I guess I just have to delete the NAME.opt file and<br/>\nthen recreate the buttons to get them back, but it isn&#39;t that big a deal for me as<br/>\nit&#39;s a the enchanter I started, but never play. If it was my main character, I would<br/>\nhave devoted a little more time to fixing it! :) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it&#39;s just a little trick (and pitfall) I figured out and thought you might<br/>\nenjoy knowing.<br/>\n<br/>\nChet Watkins wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Chet Watkins&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chetwatkins@...\">chetwatkins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think what he means is if has a paladin named bob and a hot key for lay<br/>\n&gt; hands. The hot key for lay hands will be a blank space for bob the warrior<br/>\n&gt; on another server (becuase he doesnt have the skill of course). There for to<br/>\n&gt; get the EXACT layout he makes another bob the paladin. But you are right<br/>\n&gt; anything else thats the same on both classes will transfer fine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Adol<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Moe Drippins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ug@...\">ug@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>, &quot;Diina, David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DDiina@...\">DDiina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: RE: [EQCheats] EQ and Laptops<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Wed, 4 Aug 1999 13:27:46 -0500 (EST)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Moe Drippins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ug@...\">ug@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Diina, David writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Diina, David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DDiina@...\">DDiina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But they are still two separate characters..correct??? just same name<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; class..right?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;i think it doesn&#39;t even care about class; the hotbuttons are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;name-based.
