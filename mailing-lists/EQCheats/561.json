My<br/>\nimpression (please feel free to correct me if I am wrong!) is that you guys<br/>\nare the same group of people that made hundreds of millions of TONS of<br/>\nsurplus Tailoring-made items in UO - you chose to spend time working up your<br/>\nTailor so you could provide your mage with enough money to buy reagents.<br/>\nTrue?<br/>\nThe point I&#39;m trying to make is that you guys were taking advantage of the<br/>\nsystem...using in imbalance in the pricing structure to make a LOT more cash<br/>\nthan you should have been able to make by using trade skills.  Be happy that<br/>\nyou got to take advantage of the system as long as you did.  But PLEASE<br/>\ndon&#39;t whine when they try to balance things out...it trivializes the real<br/>\nissues around game balance.<br/>\nThanks for your time.<br/>\nFlame away  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Doug Sorensen [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:belgarth_of_surefall@...\">belgarth_of_surefall@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 26, 1999 12:13 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQCheats] Pottery<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Doug Sorensen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:belgarth_of_surefall@...\">belgarth_of_surefall@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n Now you can try to sell all those fine pottery Wares<br/>\nto the Players! <br/>\n<br/>\nBelgarth auctions Large Bowl only 2 Plat! <br/>\n<br/>\nThis game is sucking worse every day.
