The Knight supposedly<br/>\nspawns 3 times a day (or every 6 hours I&#39;ve heard).  We got him twice within<br/>\n15 minutes, got two swords.  This is rare.  More likely he will spawn<br/>\nseveral hours apart.  The room that spawns him also spawns about 2 - 3 other<br/>\ndazed goblins, and there is a false wall behind the green gems which<br/>\ncontains an alcove with 2 dazed miners.  My group was in the 25ish range and<br/>\nwe could take all that no prob.  Make sure you have root, chains of music,<br/>\netc. to stop runner or else you will have a dazed train on your hands.  An<br/>\nenchanter or bard is good for crowd control is you are actually going to<br/>\ncamp and room and fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlackened Iron Armor I believe is one AC worse than banded, heavier, but has<br/>\nthe +ACI-cool+ACI- look, and some people pay a fortune for the stuff.  It comes off<br/>\nthe warlord and sometimes elite guards.  The King drops the crown,<br/>\nmedallion, and grotesque mask (not all 3 at once, not all the time).  The<br/>\nKing is guarded by 4 elites, plus 2 in a room beyond.  The warlord room is<br/>\nbefore the King room, containing the warlord and 2 elites.  I&#39;ve seen high<br/>\nteens to low twenties camping the warlord room since there are only 3 mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nRunnyeye is (on Tunare) not crowded and has good treasure and exp.  You just<br/>\nhave to know how to play the dungeon.  Also, if you camp the King&#39;s room be<br/>\nprepared to fight Borxx (or to zone, depending on your party&#39;s level).  My<br/>\nparty killed Borxx each and every time (he&#39;s lvl 30 - 33) and he always<br/>\ndrops the lens for the Staff of the Observers Quest..  The lens sells very<br/>\nwell by itself, but the staff sells for even more.  He also occasionally<br/>\ndrops a bracelet.  Polished Bone I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow..hope this helps.<br/>\nSenjen Silentfist<br/>\n28th Circle Monk<br/>\nTunare server<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: dlobdell dlobdell+AEA-stny.lrun.com<br/>\nTo: EQCheats+AEA-onelist.com EQCheats+AEA-onelist.com<br/>\nDate: Friday, July 16, 1999 11:42 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: +AFs-EQCheats+AF0- Blackened Iron Bastard Sword?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: +ACI-dlobdell+ACI- dlobdell+AEA-stny.lrun.com<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a party of lvl 24 plus you could easly take the knight and the rest of<br/>\nthem if you stood at the top of the ramp and pulled to there.

Others say<br/>\n+AD4APg-it&#39;s random, sometimes they can spawn back to back within a half hour..<br/>\n+AD4APg-sometimes it takes up to 6 hours or so.
