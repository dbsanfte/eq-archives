I know<br/>\n in N Ro i can kill bugs (scarabs and tarantulas) but they give shit for<br/>\n loot.  I have partied with a lvl 10 warrior and lvl 10 bard and kicked ass<br/>\n at derv camps, but it&#39;s too much work finding people willing to party to<br/>\n derv hunt.  I was wondering if there was anywhere that was REALLY easy to<br/>\n lvl at, or like a place where only Mummys spawn, that would work the best.<br/>\n I heard HighPass was good, but from others i heard it&#39;s for lvl 15-25<br/>\n people.  I also heard Lake Rathe was the best, but I&#39;d have to party, and<br/>\n hardly any people are there.  Any info?<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Black Burrow is the best place I&#39;ve found for lvl 8 -10.  Gnolls and Giant <br/>\nSnakes everywhere.  Good exp and the best loot by far for this lvl - cloth <br/>\narmor, weapons, giant snake fangs and money on almost every monster.  Black <br/>\nBurrow is very, very popular so grouping is very easy especially for a healer <br/>\ntype such as yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlack Burrow is the zone that connects Queynos Hills with Everfrost and Halas <br/>\nthe Barbarian lands.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizaro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
