I can&#39;t remember the details of the fight(s), but I do<br/>\nremember it happened one time zoneing from Qeynos to Q. Hills.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy arrow keys (forward and back) no longer move my character, instead they scroll through the text I<br/>\nhave typed in before. (/ignore &lt;whoever&gt;, &quot;sorry, guys I died and will be back as soon as I mem my<br/>\nspells and run back&quot;, etc.) Don&#39;t remember if it affected hotkeys, shortcuts &lt;i&gt; &lt;s&gt; etc. My cursor<br/>\ngets locked into mouselook mode, so I can&#39;t control my cursor to click on stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe keypad movement keys were unaffected but I never use them, so they weren&#39;t really of much help.<br/>\nI would usually have to camp and comeback for it to go away. Although, once it cleared up when I<br/>\nzoned again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never reported it or anything... usually it happened when my group needs me so I would just try to<br/>\nget it resolved and get back to nuking. By the time things would calm down so I could report it, i<br/>\nwould have forgotten about it already.<br/>\n<br/>\nkale usi wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;kale usi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Jean-Christian Sokol &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcsokol@...\">jcsokol@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       From:   Douglas Babcock [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dbabcock@...\">dbabcock@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       &gt;Heres the problem we encountered and I need to know If anyone else<br/>\n&gt; &gt;has seen<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       &gt;this.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       &gt;3 of our casters, 2 clerics and 1 enchanter  lost the ability to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;cast spells<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       &gt;during the melee.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       I was playing with a friend yesterday, in Befallen too, and at one<br/>\n&gt; &gt;time my keyboard went out.
