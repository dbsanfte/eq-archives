In fact ive obtained more PBB&#39;s off regulare evil eyes then lords. And btw, that is quite rare... Ive soloed the EE&#39;s in the gorge for 30 hr periods... and gotten two or three PBB&#39;s in one session... Once i even got 3 in a row off the same spawn... If you were fighting with a party when you kept track of these &#39;80 kills&#39; perhapes you should consider the possibility that your party members werent all honest about there loots smile, if not... then you just have bad luck :( And a side note: Evil eyes also drop polished bone hoops for those who dont know... of course not as good as PBB&#39;s but they are a fair item for a lvl 17 and up, untill you get something better... plus 10 mana each, i know it doesnt seem like much and with the twinking standards now days you could probably get much better, but in the long run with two, it isnt bad... sorry for the long post- <br/>\n<br/>\nWes Lobdell,<br/>\nQuote: +ACI-The certain proof that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe <br/>\nis that no one has bothered to make contact with us.+ACI-<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jason Harrell jharrell+AEA-planetalumni.com<br/>\nTo: EQCheats+AEA-onelist.com EQCheats+AEA-onelist.com<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, July 21, 1999 5:07 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: +AFs-EQCheats+AF0- Yet another possible cheat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: +ACI-Jason Harrell+ACI- jharrell+AEA-planetalumni.com<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a random drop from any evil eye, as far as I&#39;m aware.
