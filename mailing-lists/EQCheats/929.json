Now thats just plain wrong.  We<br/>\n&gt;&gt;should be able to get stuff if we have good skills & high level characters<br/>\n&gt;&gt;not because we are willing to sit in a specific area for over 20 hrs. to<br/>\n&gt;get<br/>\n&gt;&gt;something really nice.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;If you&#39;re happy not getting any of those items that makes the game<br/>\n </span></blockquote>better -<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;well good for you but I for one, am NOT.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t know but for some of us - I know some of us in my guild feel that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;way - that getting all this hot stuff is a sign of wealth, power,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;achievement.  Don&#39;t forget this is a role playing game - some of us take<br/>\n&gt;our<br/>\n&gt;&gt;characters seriously & our guilds too.  Each of us have different goals in<br/>\n&gt;&gt;this game, I guess.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;But, If I can&#39;t get a BIB or whatever because I can&#39;t camp it for 20 hrs.<br/>\n&gt;or<br/>\n&gt;&gt;whatever - that is totally wrong - I shouldn&#39;t be able to get that BIB<br/>\n&gt;&gt;because Im a lousy player or because my character is not high enough to<br/>\n&gt;kill<br/>\n&gt;&gt;it or something - now that I can live with it  But when you&#39;re like level<br/>\n&gt;40<br/>\n&gt;&gt;& you could kill that spawn in your sleep & get that item easily - since<br/>\n&gt;&gt;you&#39;ve worked hard to get to that level - some rewards should come with<br/>\n&gt;&gt;being higher level  - but you&#39;re 40 & you have no rubi, special weapons or<br/>\n&gt;&gt;item because you don&#39;t have time or patience to camp but you will see a 15<br/>\n&gt;&gt;level characters with all those - NOW that is DARN  WRONG !!!!!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Well Im happy you&#39;re having fun.  Oh! by the way I played UO & I was<br/>\n&gt;&gt;bitching & whining there too :o)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;BTW, Im 31 ranger & still dont&#39; have rubi, PGT or BIBS or whatever - like<br/>\n&gt;&gt;you camping 20 or 30 hrs. straight is not plausible for me either - has if<br/>\n&gt;&gt;that was not enough - then you get casters who kill your monsters.  Im a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;very good player, have a good character - I should be able to get those<br/>\n&gt;&gt;things but with the way the game is design - I guess only people who don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt;work or kids especially if they are casters - can get ALL the good stuff.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Yeah you&#39;re right no big deal..

That would make the 10-40 hour<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;wait to get the PGT that much less special.
