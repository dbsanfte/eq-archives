I&#39;ve noticed that when a new world server goes up <br/>\nall the sudden there&#39;s 500+ people playing on it.  I wouldn&#39;t have thought <br/>\nthat within the space of an hour or two of the new world server going online<br/>\n<br/>\nthat that many new players would start there or old players would start a<br/>\nnew <br/>\nchar on it. <br/>\nTHANKS<br/>\n<br/>\nGet paid to surf the web!
