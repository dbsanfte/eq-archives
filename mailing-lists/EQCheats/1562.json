Karg Icebear is very<br/>\nhard<br/>\n: to find these days as so many people are killing him (not like the old<br/>\ndays<br/>\n: when you could always find him wandering around).<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, tedious.... the PB Cloak is a very nice item, though, and is<br/>\nALL/ALL, so selling it is hardly a problem. The rarity of Karg serves to<br/>\nmake the prices even higher. I think that nowadays one could get 20 p per<br/>\ncloak on Faydwer... if one were a shrewd trader, at least. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n: Here is my newbie money raising secret.  Collect Batwings. Sell them in<br/>\n: batches of 20.  Many higher lvl Wizards will pay 10pp or more for a batch<br/>\nof<br/>\n: 20 wings cause we don&#39;t want to bother hunting bats.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t work much anymore... Bat Wings are purchasable in unlimited<br/>\namounts in Kithicor and West Freeport (probably other zones as well, Ogguk<br/>\nor Grobb almost ceratinly) for about 14 copper each. People are beginning to<br/>\nknow this. :) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
