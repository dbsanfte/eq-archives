As a High Elf<br/>\nEnchanter, I have a reasonably high base charisma, many charisma items,<br/>\nand a charisma spell. After some experimentation, I have come to the<br/>\nconclusion that charisma&#39;s effect on pricing maxes at just over 100.<br/>\nHigher charisma than that makes no difference in pricing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have spells which can improve my faction with vendors, and have<br/>\nfound that faction higher than &quot;looks at you indifferently&quot; makes no<br/>\ndifference in pricing. If it&#39;s lower than that, your price will be<br/>\nworse, but better won&#39;t improve prices any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe final factor is the vendor multiple. Some vendors just sell things<br/>\nfor a higher base price. Charisma and faction still have an effect, but<br/>\nthe range of possible prices is higher.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I know about vendor pricing. Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tJason Harrell [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jharrell@...\">jharrell@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, August 03, 1999 4:12 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Jason Harrell&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jharrell@...\">jharrell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tOk, since I&#39;ve seen a ton of prices variances, I&#39;m<br/>\nposting this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tYour CHA has a LOT to do with the pricing.
