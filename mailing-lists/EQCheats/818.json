The game?  Cheats list?  Ring a frickin bell?!!! STOP POSTING<br/>\nBULLCRAP!!!!  IS ANYBODY MONITORING THIS?  KICK THESE IDIOTS OFF!  I DON&#39;T<br/>\nNEED 50 EMAILS ABOUT NOTHING!<br/>\n<br/>\nOk sorry had to get it of my cheast and just to show I am not a talking out<br/>\nmy arse - here is a bug which if you should want you may exploit (a cheat<br/>\nfor those of you unfamiliar with the concept.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the Entrance to Nanjena you can pull a Rock Dervish.  If you get a good<br/>\nlead and run around the corner almost zoning into nanjena you can still cast<br/>\nat the Dervish.  The mob for some reason climbs the side of the zone and<br/>\nnever goes into the tunnel to Nanjena.  You can then kill the mob without<br/>\ngetting hit yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same thing with cyclops in Mt Rathe.  You can pull them.  Just to the<br/>\nNorth of the entrance from Lk Rathe is a mountain range.  If you root or<br/>\nsnare the cy to slow his movement you can run around the mountain range and<br/>\ncast on him from the other side.  The cyclops tries to get to you but<br/>\ninstead goes way up into the air and never touches you.  Flying Cy is pretty<br/>\nfunny too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody else found spots like these?  And again the list is about EQ.  If<br/>\nyour message doesn&#39;t have GAME INFORMATION OR CHEATS.  SHUT THE F UP!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
