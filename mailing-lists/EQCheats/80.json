I was wondering how to raise <br/>\nblacksmithing the fastest? I know it would take a lot of money, but as of <br/>\nright now, I know of 3 people that can make banded. I am sure there is more, <br/>\nbut for an entire world, that is no good. Good for them, but not for everyone <br/>\nelse. I would like to become a good smith, and make banded. I have 24 in the <br/>\nsmithing skill now. I have tried just to keep making studs, as you still gain <br/>\nskill for failing, but is there anything else that would raise it faster? Any <br/>\ncheats as this is what this list is about?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSarn, Veeshan Server<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
