I am<br/>\nnot sure if it&#39;s Verant answer to players cheesing out the effect or if<br/>\nit&#39;s just a bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually just type /q and come back.I am not sure why u lost the fight<br/>\njust cause of that unless u didnt have enough people.It takes me no<br/>\nlonger than about 30 secs to get back in.Considering it only happen 1<br/>\ntime per fight or so on average and that its a long long fight it<br/>\nshould&#39;nt tip the balance too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw is negafen dropping anything for magii<br/>\nclasses(necros,enchanters,wiz,magiciants)? On my server it hasnt dropped<br/>\ncrap for us in several kills.Last kill we had on it, it dropped 3<br/>\nshamans hammers......sigh go figure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKarim.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
