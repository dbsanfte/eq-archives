I am only a casual player,<br/>\nand there have been many patches where I&#39;ve felt a bit shafted.  They have<br/>\nmade EQ into a beast that requires absurd amounts of time to make any<br/>\nprogress whatsoever.  I used to have a great group of people to party with,<br/>\nbut I couldn&#39;t dedicate the 40+ hours per week that they did, so I&#39;m enough<br/>\nlevels behind that I can&#39;t group with them and make any progress... so I&#39;m<br/>\nstuck at a mid level and I haven&#39;t been able to find another decent group<br/>\nfor the life of me.  So instead of facing all the frustration, I&#39;m wishing I<br/>\ncould just switch my characters to &quot;inactive&quot; status... where I can&#39;t play<br/>\nthe game, but they don&#39;t delete my characters.... so I can come back in a<br/>\nyear or so if nothing better comes along.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the flip side, if EQ was just 50% easier, you wouldn&#39;t be able to pry me<br/>\naway from that infernal compter.  It&#39;s the excitement of making progress<br/>\nthat is so fun, and for the casual gamer, the progress curve in EQ is so low<br/>\nafter lvl 20 that it&#39;s just not that much fun anymore.  I&#39;d almost rather<br/>\nspend my time playing Kingdoms or go back and play Bladur&#39;s Gate all the way<br/>\nthrough, or best of all... go find a good text-based MUD where I can advance<br/>\nat a reasonable speed then wiz and start adding my own imagination to the<br/>\nworld.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kzak<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. does anybody know a email address for feedback?  I&#39;d love to just share<br/>\nsome of these frustrations.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
