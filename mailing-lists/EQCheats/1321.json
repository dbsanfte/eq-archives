Even over 15 min<br/>\n\t\t\tafter battle game interface didnt function. I was<br/>\nable to walk using<br/>\n\t\t\tkeyboard, turn around with mouse, but no hotkey or<br/>\nspell were working.<br/>\n\t\t\tScreen mode switching too, and i havnt been even<br/>\nable to camp because i<br/>\n\t\t\tplay in &quot;full screen&quot; mode and camp button was<br/>\nunreachable. That<br/>\n\t\t\thappened to me 3 times, all times i was combating<br/>\nwith necromancers and<br/>\n\t\t\tenchanters. I believe problem is some enchanter<br/>\nspell, because i was<br/>\n\t\t\tfighting with necros many times and only if<br/>\nenchanter was nearby i was<br/>\n\t\t\tfacing such problem. I was feared and charmed before<br/>\nand it never cause<br/>\n\t\t\tme such problems, so single charm or fear is ok.<br/>\nMaybe some combo can<br/>\n\t\t\tcause this, like fear+charm or fear+root or<br/>\nsomething like it. I believe<br/>\n\t\t\tenchanter spell of 8-12 lvl is required to cause<br/>\nsuch problems, because<br/>\n\t\t\tin fights against 20+ lvl enchanters i never<br/>\nexperienced this problem,<br/>\n\t\t\tonly in fights with 8-12 lvl ones. BTW, my friend<br/>\nwas in same situation<br/>\n\t\t\teven more times than me, and he also crashed to<br/>\nWindows once, and once<br/>\n\t\t\twas forced to reset his computer. We have written<br/>\nalot of petitions<br/>\n\t\t\tabout these bugs but none of them were answered.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\tShow your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n\t\t\t&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2</a><br/>\n&quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n\t\t\tWith a new ONElist SHIRT available through our<br/>\nwebsite.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n\t\t\tGet paid to surf the web!
