I<br/>\nhave heard of this many times, but personally haven&#39;t been charmed but once,<br/>\nand that was when I first started playing the game.  But I was once in a<br/>\ngroup where every person got charmed but me, the monk in the party tried the<br/>\nsitting trick and it successfully slowed her down.  Enough that she didn&#39;t<br/>\ncause too many problems for the rest of the party.  But I don&#39;t think it<br/>\ncanceled the charm.  I feel that further testing is required.  Maybe a<br/>\ncouple of people on the list with the ability to charm can try it with some<br/>\nfriends?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note:  On that foray against the evil eye....  The other 5<br/>\npeople all got charmed in our group...  they started attacking while I was<br/>\nAFK, so I got there halfway through the battle.  I unloaded all my manna at<br/>\nthe eye and successfully killed it.  I got an experience message, but nobody<br/>\nelse in the group did.  My current theory is that once you are charmed, you<br/>\ncount as a monster, and won&#39;t get the experience message for any group kills<br/>\nduring that time.  Unfortunately, this is also hard to test.  Unfortunately<br/>\nthat mishap resulted in the death of more than half our party... but when I<br/>\nlooked at my XP-o-meter, I got a huge chunk of XP from the fight (if my<br/>\ntheory is correct, I got all of the XP)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kzak<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nWhen fighting evil eyes in the gorge the other night, I hit the sit button<br/>\nwhile charmed somehow. The result was canceling the charm, which allowed me<br/>\nto continue with my battle. I managed to do this repeatedly throughout the<br/>\nnight. This could be a coincidence or an actual bug in the game, I&#39;m not<br/>\nsure. Since I felt it was cheating, I quit doing it and left the gorge;<br/>\nafter all, I only wanted another Polished Bone Bracer ;)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
