We play on <br/>\nthe<br/>\nSolusek Ro server.  I play as Keptin Pike.  We were harassed by players <br/>\nthere<br/>\nwho were constantly dispelling us and dumping monsters (guards) on us. In<br/>\nfact they even managed to dump guards on us where Neriak zones to Nektulos<br/>\nSo we got trapped on both sides of the zone due to monster dumping.  Two of<br/>\nus died. I would like to remind you that we were not killing any vendors or<br/>\nquest related  NPCs.  Also, in the Foreign Quarter there is no danger to<br/>\nnewbies from anything.<br/>\n   GM Hidaeki said this was perfectly legal since they were role-playing.<br/>\nHmm, I  imagine I can do a lot of harassing and exploiting under the guise <br/>\nof<br/>\nrole-playing.  I asked about the exploit of PVP Switch Avoidance and he<br/>\nignored me.  I have posted said exploit below as  posted on your site.<br/>\n<br/>\nPvP Switch Avoidance ï¿½ using in-game methods to work around the PvP switch<br/>\nand allowing non-PvP players to kill other players, such as hall blocking,<br/>\ndumping of monsters, or spell effects that cross that boundary due to a bug.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease tell me if those players who were killing us fall under this exploit<br/>\nand can be given an official warning.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet paid to surf the web!
