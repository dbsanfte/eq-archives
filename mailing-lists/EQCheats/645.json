I can&#39;t stress the fact<br/>\n&gt; That you get out only what you put in to the<br/>\n&gt; game. I have nights where<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll do nothing but try to map, I guess that<br/>\n&gt; makes me lame since I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; Leveling while I&#39;m doing it though huh? If<br/>\n&gt; someone is not enjoying the <br/>\n&gt; Game then try to find a different circle of<br/>\n&gt; friends, they may be the cause.<br/>\n&gt; Or try going to a different area. sorry for the<br/>\n&gt; rant all but this list has<br/>\n&gt; somehow<br/>\n&gt; Gone from cheats to a bitch list and I know I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not helping here but anywho.<br/>\n&gt; God forbid anyone have to group...<br/>\n&gt; John<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;  From: Doug Sorensen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>+AFs-SMTP:belgarth+AF8-of+AF8-surefall+AEA-yahoo.com+AF0-<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Sent: Tuesday, July 27, 1999 6:28 PM<br/>\n&gt;  To: EQCheats+AEA-onelist.com<br/>\n&gt;  Subject: RE: +AFs-EQCheats+AF0- Level times<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  From: Doug Sorensen<br/>\n&gt; belgarth+AF8-of+AF8-surefall+AEA-yahoo.com<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    I am not really in a great hurry, but I like<br/>\n&gt; to see<br/>\n&gt;  my character advance. The RP aspects of this<br/>\n&gt; game are<br/>\n&gt;  about 1/10th of UO&#39;s even though that game was<br/>\n&gt; riddled<br/>\n&gt;  with Player Killers, bugs and exploits. I<br/>\n&gt; enjoy the<br/>\n&gt;  game, but I feel after playing similar game<br/>\n&gt; types that<br/>\n&gt;  this game corrals you more into the powergamer<br/>\n&gt; role. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I get into the mindset that I can play this<br/>\n&gt; game for a<br/>\n&gt;  few hours and be about the same as I started<br/>\n&gt; or I can<br/>\n&gt;  play something like Heroes of Might and Magic<br/>\n&gt; III and<br/>\n&gt;  go through a few scenarios. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I will more likely plan to leave due to slow<br/>\n&gt; leveling<br/>\n&gt;  than I would if I would see constant<br/>\n&gt; improvements in<br/>\n&gt;  my character. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Even level 50s still have to go in two full<br/>\n&gt; groups to<br/>\n&gt;  take on the tougher stuff like the dragons. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Belgarth Wolfstrider <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
