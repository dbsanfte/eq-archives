It&#39;s supposed to have the same bonouses <br/>\nand is NOT supposed to be a NO DROP item. My info was obtained from a <br/>\nreliable website. Here&#39;s one quote that was posted there:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;begin quote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs of Monday&#39;s patch on the Test Server, the Glowing Stein is no more. If <br/>\nyou possessed it, it is now a Stein of Moggok. It is now a 7/43 1 handed <br/>\nblunt weapon, and can only be carried in the primary melee slot (right <br/>\nhand). If you already had it in the secondary melee slot (left hand), then <br/>\nit will stay there until you remove it. Other than that, it is the same. <br/>\nMAGIC ITEM, and LORE ITEM and is NOT no drop. However, the quest difficulty <br/>\nis being increased once the new item is implemented. This has been verified <br/>\nby GM&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember last time this happened? A lot of items ended up being found only <br/>\non the Plane of Fear. It seems Verant has a bad habit of understating <br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;/end quote&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
