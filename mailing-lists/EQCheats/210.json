The fiery avenger is the super weapon for paladins. <br/>\nIf you don&#39;t believe post on any widely known messageboard about it<br/>\nbeing a paladin only sword.  As far as the other classes super weapons,<br/>\nI don&#39;t know those.  I received the info about all classes having a<br/>\nsuper weapon off a lvl 48 group of 5 people.  The Oaken scimitar is the<br/>\ndruid&#39;s super weapon.  The rest remain unknown as far as i know.  As for<br/>\nthere being only one fiery avenger per server..  that was heresay and I<br/>\nam ashamed that i repeated it.  Everything else is fact to my<br/>\nknowledge.  BTW..  if you ever wondered where to find Aradune and the<br/>\nrest of his crew, Veeshan is the developers playground.  This doesn&#39;t<br/>\nsurprise me seeing as they are the only server to have slain Lady Vox so<br/>\nfar.  Talk to some of the high lvl people on your servers.  You&#39;ll find<br/>\nout some very interesting stuff.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
