I have screen shots even.  Anyway, they looted<br/>\nit and started shouting complaints because it&#39;s a lvl 35 mob, and all it had<br/>\non it was a couple of spider silk, spider legs and like 5 gp or something?<br/>\nIt was quite a rip.

All I have to say is good luck. He&#39;s <br/>\nbig enough to sit on 2 sand dunes by himself. And if he doesn&#39;t get you, the<br/>\n<br/>\nhordes of undead, madmen and orcs that usually mob you at this point might. <br/>\nBUT......... If you&#39;re high enough level or in a high level group, you could<br/>\n<br/>\nprobably take them.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
