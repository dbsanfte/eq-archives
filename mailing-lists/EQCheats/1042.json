Maybe, but<br/>\n&gt; just maybe you could get rid of root, blind and spells like that ... just intercept the<br/>\n&gt; server feed using some program to tunnel it and remove/add commands from the<br/>\n&gt; feed , the server would think you are rooted but since your EQ client didnt recieve<br/>\n&gt; the command to root you it would let you move freely.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, there is one important thing that is handled completely on the <br/>\nclient side.
