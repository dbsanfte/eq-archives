I think it was more for the visiting trolls and orges that needed<br/>\na little help to get<br/>\n&gt; certain vendors to sell to them and such. It may be more trouble than it&#39;s<br/>\nworth for someone who is<br/>\n&gt; KoS in Neriak. (There are guards that wander and you could run into them..<br/>\nunlikely, but possible.<br/>\n&gt; Especially, if some DE wanted to mess with you and trained one or two onto<br/>\nyou.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The easiest way to find out if faction goes down with all halflings would<br/>\nbe to go to Nek forrest<br/>\n&gt; and give a shout.... Most likely, there is someone who just killed one and<br/>\ncan tell you. Or try<br/>\n&gt; conning one of the halflings themselves.... if they like you as much as<br/>\nthe regular halflings do<br/>\n&gt; then I would guess you would not want to go to the halfling town after<br/>\ngetting your faction up with<br/>\n&gt; the evil races. But if they scowl at you then I think it would be pretty<br/>\nsafe to take them out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Whitcraft,David&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Whitcraft,David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DWHITCRAFT@...\">DWHITCRAFT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Does this lower halfling faction at the same time?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Sam Powell [mailto:sam@ti.l-3com.com]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 01, 1999 5:03 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [EQCheats] Raising Faction<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Sam Powell&quot; &lt;sam@ti.l-3com.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I believe killing halflings in Nektulos forest raises Neriak factions,<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; &gt; look out for our guards!
