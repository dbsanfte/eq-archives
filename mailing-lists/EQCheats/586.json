Who<br/>\nwould have thought that just 3 months into this online game we would have<br/>\nLevel 50 players, and 4 months in, that we would have TONS of them, and many<br/>\nmore level 40+ players!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI really didn&#39;t expect to reach level 50 for about a year (at 20 hrs a week<br/>\nthat is about right too, it seems) so I think things are pretty good<br/>\nmyself... I know many people are more interested in leveling up as fast as<br/>\nthey can, but tell me, what do you do after you have reached level 50 and<br/>\nhave played at that level for a month or more?

I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only a casual player,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and there have been many patches where I&#39;ve felt a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bit shafted.  They have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; made EQ into a beast that requires absurd amounts of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time to make any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; progress whatsoever.  I used to have a great group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of people to party with,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but I couldn&#39;t dedicate the 40+ hours per week that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they did, so I&#39;m enough<br/>\n&gt; &gt; levels behind that I can&#39;t group with them and make<br/>\n&gt; &gt; any progress... so I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stuck at a mid level and I haven&#39;t been able to find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; another decent group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for the life of me.  So instead of facing all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; frustration, I&#39;m wishing I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could just switch my characters to &quot;inactive&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; status... where I can&#39;t play<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the game, but they don&#39;t delete my characters.... so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can come back in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; year or so if nothing better comes along.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On the flip side, if EQ was just 50% easier, you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t be able to pry me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; away from that infernal compter.  It&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; excitement of making progress<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that is so fun, and for the casual gamer, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; progress curve in EQ is so low<br/>\n&gt; &gt; after lvl 20 that it&#39;s just not that much fun<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anymore.  I&#39;d almost rather<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spend my time playing Kingdoms or go back and play<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bladur&#39;s Gate all the way<br/>\n&gt; &gt; through, or best of all... go find a good text-based<br/>\n&gt; &gt; MUD where I can advance<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at a reasonable speed then wiz and start adding my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; own imagination to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; world.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Kzak<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; P.S. does anybody know a email address for feedback?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;d love to just share<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some of these frustrations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How do you enter ONElist&#39;s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\n&gt; By joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
