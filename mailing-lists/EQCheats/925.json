Now thats just plain wrong.  We<br/>\nshould be able to get stuff if we have good skills & high level characters<br/>\nnot because we are willing to sit in a specific area for over 20 hrs. to get<br/>\nsomething really nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re happy not getting any of those items that makes the game better -<br/>\nwell good for you but I for one, am NOT.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know but for some of us - I know some of us in my guild feel that<br/>\nway - that getting all this hot stuff is a sign of wealth, power,<br/>\nachievement.  Don&#39;t forget this is a role playing game - some of us take our<br/>\ncharacters seriously & our guilds too.  Each of us have different goals in<br/>\nthis game, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, If I can&#39;t get a BIB or whatever because I can&#39;t camp it for 20 hrs. or<br/>\nwhatever - that is totally wrong - I shouldn&#39;t be able to get that BIB<br/>\nbecause Im a lousy player or because my character is not high enough to kill<br/>\nit or something - now that I can live with it  But when you&#39;re like level 40<br/>\n& you could kill that spawn in your sleep & get that item easily - since<br/>\nyou&#39;ve worked hard to get to that level - some rewards should come with<br/>\nbeing higher level  - but you&#39;re 40 & you have no rubi, special weapons or<br/>\nitem because you don&#39;t have time or patience to camp but you will see a 15<br/>\nlevel characters with all those - NOW that is DARN  WRONG !!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell Im happy you&#39;re having fun.  Oh! by the way I played UO & I was<br/>\nbitching & whining there too :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, Im 31 ranger & still dont&#39; have rubi, PGT or BIBS or whatever - like<br/>\nyou camping 20 or 30 hrs. straight is not plausible for me either - has if<br/>\nthat was not enough - then you get casters who kill your monsters.  Im a<br/>\nvery good player, have a good character - I should be able to get those<br/>\nthings but with the way the game is design - I guess only people who don&#39;t<br/>\nwork or kids especially if they are casters - can get ALL the good stuff.<br/>\nYeah you&#39;re right no big deal.. Who cares how strong my character gets with<br/>\ntime - I&#39;ll still not be able to get those things by myself, yeah no big<br/>\ndeal<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Seamus McNeill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smcneill@...\">smcneill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Saturday, August 14, 1999 2:23 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQCheats] Digest Number 89<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Seamus McNeill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smcneill@...\">smcneill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I work 40 hours a week, have my own apartment, my own car, loan, bills, I<br/>\n&gt;go to night school aswell and I play maybe 2-3 hours a night....so about<br/>\n&gt;15 hours a week...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That won&#39;t get me a pait of JBoots, or BIBS, or BIC...or any rubicite or<br/>\n&gt;anything....but you know what I do....I just enjoy the game.  So WHAT if<br/>\n&gt;you can&#39;t have an item you want.  Tough shit....really people....sure the<br/>\n&gt;item may be cool....but it&#39;s not the end all and be all of your<br/>\n&gt;character.....please.....quite bitching about camping.  I don&#39;t camp,<br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t camp....and don&#39;t care if others do.  If they want to stay up 18<br/>\n&gt;straight hours....then let them....this is a game after all....there are<br/>\n&gt;other things going on in the world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As far as items not being on a MoB all the time.  Well...that would make<br/>\n&gt;SoW from a shaman or druid...not very special....that would make that<br/>\n&gt;special weapon not so special anymore.  That would make the 10-40 hour<br/>\n&gt;wait to get the PGT that much less special.  If you want to power through<br/>\n&gt;the game...get all the best weapons and armor easily and not have to work<br/>\n&gt;at all to get em....then go play UO.  I don&#39;t want to see everyone running<br/>\n&gt;around with JBoots...wielding PGT&#39;s and Darkewood shields....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~S<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;p.s.  power leveling, stupidity and camping will thin out rather<br/>\n&gt;soon....seeing as highschool/college are starting rather soon.....relax<br/>\n&gt;people....plenty of items in the game that we know of....and plenty more<br/>\n&gt;that we don&#39;t know about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;             Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt;Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;        <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\n </span></blockquote>goto www.everquest.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
