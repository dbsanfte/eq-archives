This<br/>\n7th member will not sure up on the grouping list. Also this 7th<br/>\nmember will gain exp as if he were in the group.  I have no tried<br/>\nthis bug so I can&#39;t verify that it works but here it goes:<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIf you have 6 people in a group have one of them disband and<br/>\nthen reinvite him,Â…then invite the 7th person and have them join<br/>\nin a<br/>\ncertain order (not sure what order so you might have to play around<br/>\nwith this one).  This bug was submitted by a member of my website and<br/>\nhe himself said that he was in a group with 7 people because at one<br/>\npoint the 7th person went link dead and it told the group the he went<br/>\nlinkdead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks and let me know if you want more cheats or you can just go to<br/>\nmy website,<br/>\n<br/>\nCraig</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
