I think it was more for the visiting trolls and orges that needed a little help to get<br/>\ncertain vendors to sell to them and such. It may be more trouble than it&#39;s worth for someone who is<br/>\nKoS in Neriak. (There are guards that wander and you could run into them.. unlikely, but possible.<br/>\nEspecially, if some DE wanted to mess with you and trained one or two onto you.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe easiest way to find out if faction goes down with all halflings would be to go to Nek forrest<br/>\nand give a shout.... Most likely, there is someone who just killed one and can tell you. Or try<br/>\nconning one of the halflings themselves.... if they like you as much as the regular halflings do<br/>\nthen I would guess you would not want to go to the halfling town after getting your faction up with<br/>\nthe evil races. But if they scowl at you then I think it would be pretty safe to take them out.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Whitcraft,David&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Whitcraft,David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DWHITCRAFT@...\">DWHITCRAFT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does this lower halfling faction at the same time?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Sam Powell [mailto:sam@ti.l-3com.com]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 01, 1999 5:03 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EQCheats] Raising Faction<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Sam Powell&quot; &lt;sam@ti.l-3com.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I believe killing halflings in Nektulos forest raises Neriak factions, just<br/>\n&gt; look out for our guards!
