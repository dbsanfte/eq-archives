Double attack will<br/>\nallow 2 attacks with same weapon in that same &quot;round&quot;.  While dual wield<br/>\nwould be 2 weapons, blah blah blah... total of 4 attacks occasionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you are right, the theory would have to be adjusted a little.  So say<br/>\nthe Avenger does 100pts of damage...  double attack would allow 200pts in a<br/>\n&quot;round&quot;.  It still doesn&#39;t seem to add up.  Of course, it has that spell<br/>\neffect too, which might make all the difference in the world.  Against<br/>\nnon-monks anyway.  The problem with fighting a monk isn&#39;t doing damage, it&#39;s<br/>\nhitting the slippery devils in the first place.  I REALLY wouldn&#39;t want to<br/>\nfind a creature with a delay 50 weapon if I only hit them in 1 out of 8<br/>\nattempts.  (and spell-weapons can only go off if you score a hit)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kzak<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tim West [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:twest@...\">twest@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 28, 1999 1:15 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQCheats] Fiery Avenger really that good?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Tim West&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:twest@...\">twest@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAh, yes.
