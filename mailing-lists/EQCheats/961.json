Well met all you fellow EQ &quot;Cheaters.&quot; he he! Well... I&#39;m fairly<br/>\n&gt;new to the list and wanted to change things up a bit and touch on 2 new<br/>\n&gt;subjects...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) Where in the world can you find a BAG OF TINKERER? I&#39;ve only read about<br/>\n&gt;this item and never seen one in game. I understand that it&#39;s 10-Slots and<br/>\n&gt;everything placed inside is WEIGHTLESS!!! Wow! Is this bought from a hidden<br/>\n&gt;NPC? Looted from a MOB? Who knows? Anyone with any information on this care<br/>\n&gt;to share?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2) I am also interested in MAXIMUM POWER GAMING! Oh no... let the RP&#39;ers<br/>\n&gt;flame begin. he he! What I mean is this... Can someone direct me to a web<br/>\n&gt;site or provide our fine list of &quot;cheaters&quot; some SOLID information on what<br/>\n&gt;MOBS provide the BEST xp at what level(s). Surely this information must be<br/>\n&gt;out there somewhere... Or better yet, let&#39;s start a list and share our own<br/>\n&gt;experiences on what we have found individually that gives GREAT xp at<br/>\n&gt;certain levels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Here&#39;s my contribution on the Fastest XP/Level discussion... I just<br/>\n </span></blockquote>recently<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;started a Wizard and I was AMAZED how fast my XP rose while fighting GIANT<br/>\n&gt;BATS in BBlock Mountains at level 8-9. The bats don&#39;t SWARM to protect each<br/>\n&gt;other and there are always plenty to be found at night in the area around<br/>\n&gt;the crossroads.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyone else? I assume that I can speak for all of us when I say &quot;All<br/>\n&gt;levels/zones/MOBS would be GREATLY appreciated! Let&#39;s gain some XP thru our<br/>\n&gt;group! BTW... I tend to SOLO a lot due to &quot;multitasking&quot; at home during the<br/>\n&gt;night. You know... family stuff. he he!
