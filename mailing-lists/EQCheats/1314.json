He looks like a zombie and is MUCH<br/>\n&gt; tougher.  He was blue to<br/>\n&gt; me at 35, so not sure exactly his level.  I wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; able to take him solo,<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s for sure.  I heard that after he chased me<br/>\n&gt; running and screaming like<br/>\n&gt; a girl into surefall glade, he was killed by a level<br/>\n&gt; 50 wiz, who I guess had<br/>\n&gt; killed Varsoon in the first place.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Telon on E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations to MSers_Online.
