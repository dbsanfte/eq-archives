I am <br/>\n a dark elf myself, and had a few friends of the &#39;good&#39;aligned races come <br/>\n into Neriak&#39;s foreign quarters killing the guards. A few dark elves and <br/>\n trolls decided to start training NPCs on them, and the trolls BLOCKED the <br/>\n zone. No one could leave unless they gated or evaced.<br/>\n <br/>\n A GM was called on the scene, and the players harrassing were given an <br/>\n official warning. My barbarian friend had died because of this zone <br/>\n blocking, causing him to lose his level.<br/>\n <br/>\n Roleplaying is one thing...causing people to die, and harrassing them is a <br/>\n totally different story.<br/>\n <br/>\n Lanadina &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is rediculous.  I think that members of a particular race working to <br/>\nprotect thier home city guards is roleplaying in its highest form.  While <br/>\ntraining guards that will then kill you may bend what would happen in <br/>\nreality, I think it is far less relaistic to expect the denizens of a <br/>\nparticular city to stand idly by as thier beloved guards are being killed, <br/>\nespecially by members of an opposing race.  I think it adds a whole new lvl <br/>\nof challenge to groups of high lvls who wish to conquer a city.  If those <br/>\nhigh lvls cannot handle that challenge they should stick to the plenty of <br/>\nother places where they can get exp and items and have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Neriak storming event that Keptin talked about happened as he said on <br/>\nSolusek Ro.  Solusek Ro is probably the worst roleplaying server that exists <br/>\nand is almost exclusively a power gaming -hey dude- you suck - cool man! - <br/>\nserver.  I know, my 25 Wizard lives there.  It does not surprise me that <br/>\nKeptin thus complains about what happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tell you what friends, try to attack my guards in Erudin I will stand with <br/>\nthem to the end!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWizaro Wrathcaster</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
