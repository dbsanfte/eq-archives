I loved this game but people got burned out on<br/>\n&gt;it becuase you could build too fast and then got bored. Then people went<br/>\n&gt;around and PKed each other. It turned a wonderful online community into a<br/>\n&gt;garbage dump. What is your great hurry? You planning on leaving soon? As<br/>\n&gt;long as you are having fun and meeting new people and playing a game you<br/>\n&gt;like what difference does it make what level you are or how fast you get<br/>\n&gt;there. These games are ment to be played for years not weeks. I am<br/>\n&gt;surprised that people have already been able to max out. Now what do they<br/>\n&gt;have to do? Ok they can go anywhere and kill almost anything but how long<br/>\n&gt;before they get bored and move on? The game has only been out a few months.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just my 2 cents<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Feather Dreamwalker of Rathe<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I agree that level gaining is quite slow. 8-10 hours<br/>\n&gt;&gt;for a level is a bit much. I can&#39;t imagine the high<br/>\n&gt;&gt;30s and above.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Belgarth<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How do you enter ONElist&#39;s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\n&gt;By joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
