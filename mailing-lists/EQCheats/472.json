Being a HE Bard, you can go<br/>\nalmost anywhere. NRo, SRo, Befallen, WK (about the upper end for WK though),<br/>\nEK (would be lower end for EK), Paw, SK (lower end for SK), EC and WC. Lots<br/>\nof places on the main continent would be excellent for you at 12. Beholder<br/>\nwould be ok in a group, take out some muddites or lower end minos. Tons of<br/>\nplaces...come explore the main continent!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Zantaer/Leod, Fennin Ro, SOK<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Lemac Justerian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 21, 1999 11:09 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQCheats] Where to go at my level?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Lemac Justerian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo yourself and others a favor...
