The character that holding<br/>\nthe sword in the picture is a GM and that is why he can hold it.  The fact<br/>\nthat Paladins get the Holy Swords and no one else is to make up for the<br/>\nfact that we get 20% less exp. per kill.  Paladins also are not great<br/>\nfighters like the Warriors, nor are we great healers or buffers like the<br/>\nClerics.<br/>\n<br/>\nTanaman<br/>\nLev 15 Paladin<br/>\nVeeshan Server.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
