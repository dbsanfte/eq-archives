However, I have a few odds and ends that I have<br/>\n&gt;picked up in my travels.  Some of this stuff is what I have heard, so<br/>\n&gt;take it as you will.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There is a glowing torch found on a rare spawn in Lavastorm...It gives 4<br/>\n&gt;AC, adds +5 charisma, and can be used as a lighting source when held in<br/>\n&gt;your hand.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;After receiving the Squad Ring from the quest in Riverdale, you can use<br/>\n&gt;it to kill Nillipus fairly easily.  All you have to do is lure Nillipus<br/>\n&gt;into the cleric&#39;s guide, where the ring can be recharged, and then use<br/>\n&gt;the ring when you are low on health.  You can then recharge the ring at<br/>\n&gt;one on the NPC&#39;s.  I do not have the squad ring yet, so i can not verify<br/>\n&gt;that this works.  I would appreciate it if someone would tell me how to<br/>\n&gt;recharge the ring?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When talking to NPC&#39;s, they give keywords in brackets.  To activate<br/>\n&gt;these keywords you have to ask a question using the keyword.  Usually, a<br/>\n&gt;simple question such as What [keyword]? will do the trick.  However,<br/>\n&gt;when the keyword is a person, then it requires a Who [keyword]?  I know<br/>\n&gt;this sounds pretty simple, but it took me forever to figure out.  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There are a pair of Shiny Silk Gloves which are found on the Queen<br/>\n&gt;Spider in Lesser Faydark, i forget stats but I believe they are<br/>\n&gt;magical.  It would take about a level 16 group to get them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok, that about ends my knowledge...know, i have a request for a few<br/>\n&gt;spoilers of my own<br/>\n&gt;Most of these deal with packs or  bags which reduce the weight of things<br/>\n&gt;put inside...<br/>\n&gt;For all of these, I would love to have information on:<br/>\n&gt;% of weight reduction<br/>\n&gt;where it is found<br/>\n&gt;what level to get it<br/>\n&gt;how much do they sell for<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shralok Pack- I know it comes from Highhold Pass, thats it<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bag of Sewn Evil Eye- Found in Lower Guk?, 8 slots<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Traveler&#39;s Backpack- found on Rathyl in Najena, need to get keys or<br/>\n&gt;something to find him<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Traveler&#39;s Pouch- found on Rathyl in Najena, can only hold small items<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Traveler&#39;s Pack- reduces weight by 20%, 8 slots, sometimes reward for<br/>\n&gt;Nillipus quest<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Archaelogist&#39;s Pack- found on Goblin Archaelogist in Permafrost, 6 slots<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lionhide Backpack- found in South Karana? off of a rare spawn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pierce&#39;s Pouch of Storing- reduces weight of items by 50-75%, 8 slots,<br/>\n&gt;sometimes a reward from Nillipus quest<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you know of anymore weight reduces packs, and have information on<br/>\n&gt;where to get them, please let me know...Any information about these<br/>\n&gt;items would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, where is the best place to find black pearls if I wanted to buy<br/>\n&gt;them?<br/>\n&gt;And info on the Serpent Skin Eyepatch would be appreciated...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sorry so long,<br/>\n&gt;All help is appreciated,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Grimlin<br/>\n&gt;Level 16 Monk<br/>\n&gt;Bristlebane server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt;Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net <br/>\n&gt;goto www.everquest.com </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
