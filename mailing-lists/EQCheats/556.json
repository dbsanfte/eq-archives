Because,<br/>\nthey are taking a lot of the fun out of the gameby<br/>\ndoing this. Why the hell have those skills at all if<br/>\nnbody profits from it? who is going to use a pie tin?<br/>\nA baker won&#39;t... because they took the profit out of<br/>\nbaking. <br/>\n<br/>\nWho really cares if somebody wants to stand at the<br/>\npottery wheel and make 30 - 40 plat an hour? Not<br/>\nme... all Verant is doing is really making this a<br/>\npower game. the less profitable our skills become...<br/>\nthe more camping and kill stealing you are going to<br/>\nsee. Not to mention high level characters running<br/>\nthrough newbie zones justr to make some quick dough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI uderstand that they want us to interract... but I<br/>\nwas interacting plenty when I was able to make my<br/>\nmoney off of my pie tin making skill. I think they<br/>\nare making things far too difficult. And, if this<br/>\ncontinues... i for one don&#39;t know how much longer I<br/>\nwill play EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant wants you to play it the way THEY want you to<br/>\nplay it and I just don&#39;t think that it is right or<br/>\nfair. If I want to do nothing but stand and make pie<br/>\ntins all day, or bake pies, or make beer, to make<br/>\nmoney... that should be my buisness... trust me... I<br/>\nallways return to the party situation. As a troll I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t make much off of it at all... MAYBE 20 plat an<br/>\nhour. They shoudl NOT do away with the profit margin<br/>\nall together. Lower it or something... or at least<br/>\nmake the dambned skikll useful for god sake!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is realy aggravating me... I am going to stop<br/>\nnow before I cancel my account. Yes... I&#39;m that upset<br/>\nover this.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kenny</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
