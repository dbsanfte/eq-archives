It is one thing to find flaws<br/>\nin the game design and exploit thiose... but it is a<br/>\ntotally different thing to use a hacking program to<br/>\nbuff your character up to some invincible god. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to see this game turned into a cheat fest. <br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said... finding exploitable things within the<br/>\ncurrent game code is one thing... actually hacking it<br/>\nis another and  don&#39;t want to see it happen... you on<br/>\nthe other hand do.
