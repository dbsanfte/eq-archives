Sounds like what they did to fletching, raised<br/>\nskill check by 600%. People with 190+ fletching were<br/>\ninstant gods of bowmaking. It would cost 1000s of<br/>\nplatinum to get there now.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have hit the nail on the head in many ways.  All of the downward<br/>\ntweaks such as skill costs, decreasing the spawn frequency of camped<br/>\nNPCs, and lowering treasure found on critters works against new<br/>\nplayers.  It entrenches the old players who have moved up under the old<br/>\nsystem and prevents the new players from getting there at all, or at<br/>\nleast makes the journey more arduous and less satisfying.  McQuaid said<br/>\nhe is not going to tweak the game in such a manner as to make the game<br/>\ntoo hard for casual players in response to the 24/7 no-life junkies<br/>\nhollering that things are too easy or capped out.  However it seems he<br/>\nis moving slightly in that direction nonetheless.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis constant hardening of the system is exactly why I left DragonRealms<br/>\nto play EQ after nearly 3 years.  The game got to the point where it was<br/>\nimpossible for a casual player to advance his character or make any<br/>\nmoney.  I was at the point where at 40th level it was taking 300 hours<br/>\nor more hours of constant work to make a level.  If Verant moves too far<br/>\ndown this road EQ will whither and die just like DR is.  Then we will<br/>\nmove on to the next game until it gets too difficult to be fun anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nEtc., etc., etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeatherwood<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nTransfer your big list to ONElist and earn $500!<br/>\nFor program details, go to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
