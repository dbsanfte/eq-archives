Monks stink because once your HPs are gone, you are toast.  You<br/>\n&gt;forget that Paladins get root also.  We also have Stun which will freeze<br/>\n&gt;your monk to allow us to heal up.  All of your quickness does not do you<br/>\n&gt;any good if you can&#39;t move.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Why is this going on this List anyway ?  I think we need to start a<br/>\n&gt;EQbadmouth List for this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I never play PvP anyway because I think that it is stupid that someone<br/>\n&gt;could just come up to you and kill you for no other reason.  PvP&#39;s are none<br/>\n&gt;other than a bunch of greedy people that want to steal from other people.<br/>\n&gt;That is why I am glad that the designers of this game were wise enough to<br/>\n&gt;limit player killing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tanaman<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\n </span></blockquote>goto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
