Orc (with the help of a Dwarf with a Big <br/>\nhammer.) (Note: the Spy and the Gen. Orc can be found talking <br/>\ntogether at -2096.28, 2326.77  in Greater Faydark)and they can be <br/>\npulled with spells one at a time) I got their heads and turned them <br/>\nin to Seria and got the dull sword I&#39;m to sharpen the sword, and turn <br/>\nit in with  some arborean amber and a P.forest drakeling scale to get <br/>\nthe first pally sword....well the dum sword will not sharpen, I use 1 <br/>\nand 2 sharping stones, the sword and put them in the forge in the <br/>\narmorer&#39;s shop and I&#39;m told &quot;these idems will not combine try another <br/>\nforge...WHAT other forge?? My first ? is..is there another forge in <br/>\nthe high elf city and if so where or is it because I am only 8th <br/>\nlevel?<br/>\n<br/>\nmy 2nd ? is on the first Pally armor quest where or what in the name <br/>\nof all the good gods can I find or what is &quot;Brick of crude Bronze&quot; <br/>\nand where can I find/make them (I need 2 for my first peace of armor)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nSlicesi<br/>\nHigh Elf Pally<br/>\nNo Guild<br/>\nNewbie</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
