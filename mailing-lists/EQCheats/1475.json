If they make the<br/>\n&gt; rubi quests like they did the crafted armor quest I think it will work out<br/>\n&gt; well.  Make it necessary for high priced gems and a fairly accessible<br/>\n&gt; dropped item from multiple mobs and it will go well.  The jboots should<br/>\n&gt; require a few rubies and maybe the feathers of a griffon.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From:         Evgeny Ivanov[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evgeny@...\">evgeny@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reply To:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent:         Monday, October 11, 1999 6:58 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject:      Re: [EQCheats] JBoots, Rubi & Beyond<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Evgeny Ivanov &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evgeny@...\">evgeny@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Keep reading the news, though.  Instead of being dropped by a mob it is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; going to be through a class specific quest (details not known yet).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hopefully they will make it so that only that class can do it and change<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; warrior crafted quest where only warriors can do it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am sure they will make that quests extremely buggy and insane difficult<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; complete as all later introducing quests. For example, quest for Ice Comet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; buggy from beggining for several weeks, casters research quests was made<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in such<br/>\n&gt; &gt; manner so its more easy to train research in traditional way, quests for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Necro&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; high level pet words are so hards so it is much more easy to find the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; proper<br/>\n&gt; &gt; words from regular high level mobs. Sure, it will be nightmare at Drelzna<br/>\n&gt; &gt; room<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in next 2 days :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Evgeny<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Get paid to surf the web!
