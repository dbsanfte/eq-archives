It was a 52 min spawn and more<br/>\noften than not spawns a regular Ghoul as a placeholder (PH).<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter 16 long hours of waiting in line (only 2 spawned) and getting<br/>\nthe component off the Priest i made off to Najena to complete part<br/>\n1 of the quest . unfortunately when i tried to give it to the NPC while<br/>\ninvis , it broke the invisibility and i was charmed and killed by the<br/>\nNPC<br/>\n(who is a High Elf Enchanter btw) .<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anybody else attempted to complete this quest ?<br/>\nor does anyone have confirmation if quests can be completed<br/>\nwhile invis ? pls email me directly as I dont always get the time<br/>\nto read all this list mails...<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\n<br/>\nKAEN<br/>\nNecromancer of the 30th circle<br/>\non Erollisi Marr .</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
