Note: The following is taken DIRECTLY from AllaKhazam&#39;s site<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.gamestats.com/quests/Q_QHills.htm#The\">http://everquest.gamestats.com/quests/Q_QHills.htm#The</a> Gnoll Slayer)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Gnoll Slayer:  Marton Sayor in the cottage in Qeynos Hills is concerned<br/>\nabout the safety of his infant son.  He says he will give you the gnoll<br/>\nslayer long sword if you help him.  Marton mentions a named gnoll named Lord<br/>\nElgnub who speaks common tongue, and has threatened his family.  Well, Lord<br/>\nElgnub can occasionally be found wandering around blackburrow.  He looks<br/>\nlike a Splitpaw Gnoll and is approximately level 20.  If you kill him you<br/>\nwill get a lore/no drop item Baby Joseph Slayer.  Take the baby back to his<br/>\nfather and the grateful man will give you a Gnoll Slayer sword, which is a<br/>\n1H slashing, 6/28 lore weapon.  Not altogether exciting, but he mentions<br/>\nsomething about the true potential of the sword.  If you inquire further, he<br/>\nmentions there was once an enchantment placed upon a gnolls eye which was<br/>\nembedded in the sword that gave the sword powers to protect against disease<br/>\nand call forth a wolf to fight for you. (Sounds like the scimitar of the<br/>\nMistwalker).  He then says this eye has been stolen, along with the only<br/>\nbook that can restore the enchantment and eye to the sword.  The thief is a<br/>\ngreat, one-eyed, white gnoll.  He provides no further information and says<br/>\nhe&#39;s been hunting for this gnoll for a long time.   (Submitted by Durgo)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWas wondering if anyone has completed this quest, or knows where the White<br/>\nOne Eyed gnolls are? The white gnolls I know of are in Lake Rathe, the<br/>\nEmbalmers at night, and the Undead Reavers in NK. I don&#39;t think they have<br/>\none eye though...<br/>\n<br/>\nAny clues?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
