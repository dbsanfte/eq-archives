I did a /play and I<br/>\nfelt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like I was hit with a brick.  I clocked about 400 hours since the game<br/>\n&gt; came<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out, in March.  I started the day it came out.  Do you know what I could<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with my life with 400 extra hours?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Needless to say, I quit the game this week.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wow!  I guess we could watch the average 23 hours of TV per week like the<br/>\n&gt; rest of the country does... Hmmm... wait... that&#39;s MORE!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or, we could work an extra 20 hours a week??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don;t know about the rest of you, but I work to live, I do NOT live to<br/>\n&gt; work!  I live to have FUN because that is what *I* believe life is all<br/>\n&gt; about... Having a GOOD time, a GOOD life, and trying to help others do the<br/>\n&gt; same thing!  But again, that is MY thoughts and opinions, but it&#39;s also my<br/>\n&gt; life...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry to hear you are quiting Tony!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lemac<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Start a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\n&gt; For details on ONElist&#39;s NEW FRIENDS & FAMILY program, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
