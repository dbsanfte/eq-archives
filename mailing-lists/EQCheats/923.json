So WHAT if<br/>\nyou can&#39;t have an item you want.  Tough shit....really people....sure the<br/>\nitem may be cool....but it&#39;s not the end all and be all of your<br/>\ncharacter.....please.....quite bitching about camping.  I don&#39;t camp,<br/>\ncan&#39;t camp....and don&#39;t care if others do.  If they want to stay up 18<br/>\nstraight hours....then let them....this is a game after all....there are<br/>\nother things going on in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as items not being on a MoB all the time.  Well...that would make<br/>\nSoW from a shaman or druid...not very special....that would make that<br/>\nspecial weapon not so special anymore.  That would make the 10-40 hour<br/>\nwait to get the PGT that much less special.  If you want to power through<br/>\nthe game...get all the best weapons and armor easily and not have to work<br/>\nat all to get em....then go play UO.  I don&#39;t want to see everyone running<br/>\naround with JBoots...wielding PGT&#39;s and Darkewood shields....<br/>\n<br/>\n ~S<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.  power leveling, stupidity and camping will thin out rather<br/>\nsoon....seeing as highschool/college are starting rather soon.....relax<br/>\npeople....plenty of items in the game that we know of....and plenty more<br/>\nthat we don&#39;t know about.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
