Paladin with Fiery","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-32500624\">Hmm...<br/>\n<br/>\nLets look at the comparisons, given the possible duals (with no<br/>\nLay-on-Hands)<br/>\nPaladin with Fiery Avenger Vs. Monk?  Monk will win.<br/>\nPaladin with Fiery Avenger Vs. Warrior? Warrior will probably win.<br/>\nPaladin with Fiery Avenger Vs. Ranger? Probably a toss up.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I&#39;m not certain about these, but I think you&#39;d have to prove me<br/>\nwrong for me to believe it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it... Double attack / Dual wield makes a big difference.  That&#39;s<br/>\n4 attacks per round when you get up there.  Against a monk there is no<br/>\ncontest... you have a delay _50_ weapon that does what?  in the 100pt range?<br/>\nok, maybe 150?  if that! a dmg 15 yields 24-27 hps, so it would stand to<br/>\nreason that a dmg 30 weapon dishes out 50-60hps (if it&#39;s linear) so a dmg 37<br/>\nwould be like 70ish per hit using that reasoning, but I think it&#39;s more than<br/>\nthat.<br/>\nBut that monk...  the monk will dish out... hmm.. 45+45+45+45 (4 punches)<br/>\n+120 (flying kick) = 300pts  TWICE in the time it will take the paladin to<br/>\nswing his weapon once.<br/>\n<br/>\n(On the innoruk server, there is a lvl 50 monk and lvl 50 warrior that duel<br/>\noccasionally, the warrior is in full rubicite and the monk can kill him<br/>\nbefore he even gets to half life.)<br/>\n<br/>\nA warrior will be swinging 3-4 times per round with fast high damage weapons<br/>\nfor probably a total of 90-130 per round, and still getting two rounds worth<br/>\nof hits in the time it takes the paladin to get in one.  (it&#39;s not exactly<br/>\ndouble, but it&#39;s close, 2 speed 28-32 weapons compared with one speed 50<br/>\nweapon)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe the stats that have been rumored about are true, then the Fiery avenger<br/>\nseems like a lot of hype (albeit a very cool weapon) about something that<br/>\nwill give the paladins a fighting chance.  But the reasoning on that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhold much water either, because if it wasn&#39;t a totally bad-ass weapon, then<br/>\nwhy would it be so hard to aquire?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe it&#39;s dmg 50, delay 37?  That would be a different story (he&#39;d still<br/>\nget schooled by a monk, but that&#39;s true for every class)<br/>\n<br/>\nKzak, Shaman who&#39;d get schooled by everybody<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Schafer, Timothy L 1425 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Timothy.Schafer@...\">Timothy.Schafer@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 28, 1999 12:08 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQCheats] Digest Number 36<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Schafer, Timothy L      1425&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Timothy.Schafer@...\">Timothy.Schafer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about Rangers tho, do they get special weapons?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are in the same boat as Paladins.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am a bard, so I could be wrong about No ranger swords, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink Paladins should get the most powerful weapon in the game, just because<br/>\nthey take a small exp cut.

The character that holding<br/>\n&gt; the sword in the picture is a GM and that is why he can hold it.  The fact<br/>\n&gt; that Paladins get the Holy Swords and no one else is to make up for the<br/>\n&gt; fact that we get 20% less exp. per kill.
