So, as","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1462506757\">Well to just confirm this, the wife and I bought, 16 boxes, filled them up with 20 sketches in each box slot, filled 8 slots on character and in bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as he was saying a total of 160 sketches per box *Boxes were cheaper then backpacks*, 1280 sketches per 8 slots. 2560 sketches fer one full character.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, our TOTAL intention for this was to use these to make pottery, or work pottery, just at alot better price. Load and behold when I figured this out yesturday morning, that it would be ALOT cheaper, and more beneficialy if we were to just SELL the dang things back.<br/>\n<br/>\nfor one sketch, we got 4 gp, 4sp, 2cp. Ya can imagine our amazement, when our brains started ticking, and calculating this. I first went ahead to sell my wears, from one load of 8 boxes, I gained 556pp, so I went and sold the other group of boxes, totaling for 1100+ pp. Now this was NOT our intention to do this at all :( But, because of the price change, and because we stopped to think about it, we benefitted more from the patch, then we would have say if we actually spent the money on clay, water, fireing sheets.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, that&#39;s confirmation if you wanted it about the patch, yes some ppl lucked out, but not everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThulgar<br/>\n<br/>\ndlobdell wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;dlobdell&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dlobdell@...\">dlobdell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; +ACo-SNIP+ACo-<br/>\n&gt; But hey, I&#39;m not bitchin&#39;.<br/>\n&gt; +ACo-SNIP+ACo-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Certainly sounds like you are to me +ADs-p<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wes Lobdell,<br/>\n&gt; Quote: +ACI-I don&#39;t want to achieve immortality through my work.

POTTERY<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Kenneth Toomey kennydt+AEA-rocketmail.com<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well..... to all of you bitching about how people<br/>\n&gt; were making 40 plat an hour by selling pie-tins...<br/>\n&gt; Verant&#39;s last change has made it possible for some<br/>\n&gt; people to make about 8,000 plat in 20 minutes. How?<br/>\n&gt; Well.... those of us that used pottery often,<br/>\n&gt; especially the evil races, kept sketches in the bank.<br/>\n&gt; I, for one, had 8 back packs full of sketches plus a<br/>\n&gt; back pack full on my character at the time I loggerd<br/>\n&gt; out teh night before the day of the last update. I<br/>\n&gt; figured i could at least use what sketches I had<br/>\n&gt; saved up to make more pie-tins and thus a little more<br/>\n&gt; money. well... I log in after the update.... the<br/>\n&gt; sketches I have that used to be purchased for a<br/>\n&gt; silver and some odd coin sells for about a plat or<br/>\n&gt; so... no big deal. BUT, I can sell my SKETCHES back<br/>\n&gt; to a VENDOR for about 5 gold eac.... they used to<br/>\n&gt; sell for like 8 copper back to a vendor.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So... lets do some math here... thats 9 back<br/>\n&gt; packs.... each back pack has 160 sketches in it...<br/>\n&gt; and each sketch sells for 5 gopld each. Hmmm.....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have heard of some people that thought ahead and<br/>\n&gt; had multiple characters with inventories and banks<br/>\n&gt; full of sketches that made ungodly sums of money<br/>\n&gt; after the last update.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In effect.... Verant&#39;s attempt at fixing the game<br/>\n&gt; economy has effectively destroyed it for some people.<br/>\n&gt; But hey, I&#39;m not bitchin&#39;. At least I didn&#39;t have to<br/>\n&gt; stand infront of a potttery wheel for hours on end to<br/>\n&gt; make a lot of money.... and it didn&#39;t require me to<br/>\n&gt; have any skill at all... hehe.<br/>\n&gt; -Kenny<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Congratulations DALMATIANRESCUE.
