They said they&#39;ll probably make that<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this update. Wednsdays. Read the eqnews that downloads from the update<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wednsday and it will tell you what changed. ALSO. They are no longer<br/>\n&gt; having<br/>\n&gt; &gt;rubicite dropped from the creatures that drop it currently. Everyone that<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;has<br/>\n&gt; &gt;rubicite will keep it but you will no longer be able to get it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Leave it to Verant to screw something up worse than the problem it was <br/>\n&gt; trying to fix (yet again I might add)! Why the hell couldn&#39;t they just<br/>\n&gt; have <br/>\n&gt; made rubi no drop????? I&#39;m seriously thinking about quitting now.
