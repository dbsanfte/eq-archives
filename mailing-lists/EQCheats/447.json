I have got the kill on him 4 times in 2<br/>\n&gt;days. And he dropped the crook one time. I gave it to a friend to be nice<br/>\n&gt;since my 2H blunt is still at can&#39;t hit anything. BUT after seeing EQ&#39;lizer<br/>\n&gt;and the new druid only crook. I REALLY want to get my skill up to a decent<br/>\n&gt;area. So I&#39;d like to know how often LJ drops a crook. And if I need to step<br/>\n&gt;up the LJ hunt to get a crook.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Slippin<br/>\n&gt;The Rathe </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
