After you have a<br/>\ngood group together go after red and yellow cons but<br/>\ntry to go after reds as much as possible. Ofcourse<br/>\nmake sure that your group of 5, 6 level characters<br/>\ndoes not decided to take on a sand giant or griffawn.<br/>\nBut I tanked Scarabs and Orc centurians that are red<br/>\nfor me with a good group and leveled fast from 5 to 9.<br/>\nAbout 10 hours playing time. Scarabs now con yellow so<br/>\nI need to find another place to hunt soon. Oh and I<br/>\nhave been hunting in misty thicket.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
