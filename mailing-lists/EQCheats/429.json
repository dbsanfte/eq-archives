I know its in<br/>\nRunneyeye, but was looking for more specifics on the location, the MOB that<br/>\ncarries it, group lvl needed to get to / obtain the sword, etc, etc.  I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t spent much time in Runneyeye...is it a good mid-level dungeon?  it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem very crowded..which would be a NICE change after spending the<br/>\nlast week in Unrest!<br/>\nAlso, for those of you wise in the way of Runneyeye...what MOBs drop the<br/>\nBlackened Iron armor pieces?  I know the AC isn&#39;t great, and it weighs a<br/>\nlot, but it looks very cool and I bet there is a market out there for that<br/>\n&#39;look&#39;.<br/>\nThanks in advance for your help!!<br/>\nThoradin of Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
