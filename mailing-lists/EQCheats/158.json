And it is fairly well <br/>\n&gt; &gt;known that the other Karanas yield decent LQ, MQ, and HQ Bear pelts for<br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; &gt;larger types (as well as the Kodiaks to the East). However, with several <br/>\n&gt; &gt;hundred puppies that have gotten their noses whacked I find no good<br/>\n&gt; source<br/>\n&gt; of <br/>\n&gt; &gt;LQ, MQ, or HQ pelts for small sizes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;\tAnd while on the subject, any use for LQ pelts besides resale for <br/>\n&gt; &gt;coin? Tailors use MQ (studded) and HQ (Reinforced, which last I heard<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; &gt;working). LQ uses?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I found that to get any quality wolf pelts it&#39;s best to kill the wolves in<br/>\n&gt; Qeynos hills. I had never gotten anything other than a ruined pelt or some<br/>\n&gt; sort of skin before I tried the wolves there, in just a few hours I had<br/>\n&gt; several HQ and med wolf pelts. Reinforced does work, it&#39;s only one or two<br/>\n&gt; points of ac better than leather but I have successfully made a few<br/>\n&gt; pieces.<br/>\n&gt; As to low quality pelts, there is a quest that uses bear and wolf pelts of<br/>\n&gt; low quality in QH but that&#39;s it. Does anyone have any tips for me on where<br/>\n&gt; it is best to get HQ bear pelts? I have killed countless bears for a very<br/>\n&gt; long time and have only gotten my hands on 4 HQ bear pelts to work with.<br/>\n&gt; And two of those I got lucky and found and bought from a store.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A.
