So yes it may be<br/>\nanother request to trim the message...but i think it makes it easier for<br/>\neveryone.  I think the only person it benefits is that guy on every list<br/>\nwho has an auto email answerer telling people he&#39;s not around.  Noone<br/>\nlikes him anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope to hell a cheat never comes out for this game. I personally would<br/>\nbe sickened and forced to move to a new game.  If you want to cheat go<br/>\nplay UO or Diablo or something else.  Leave this game for people who want<br/>\na challange.  The people who get pleasure only out of cheating, breaking<br/>\nand hacking into things to mess them up have a serious problem in my book<br/>\nand should be shot.  Im sick of playing a game and having a character run<br/>\nby who cheated his way ahead of me cause he lack&#39;s the<br/>\ntalent/patience/skill to do it on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nDie cheaters die!<br/>\n<br/>\n~S</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
