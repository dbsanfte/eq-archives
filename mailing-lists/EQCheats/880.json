I&#39;d take on the guards <br/>\nmyself, but I don&#39;t feel like screwing up my faction with the ogres - <br/>\nthey&#39;re the only ones I know of with certain molds that I need for my <br/>\nblacksmithing. I&#39;d buy a stein, (on Bertox) but everyone wants an outrageous <br/>\namount for one (they usually want enough cash to buy a rubicite chestplate <br/>\nand a GZ). I know the stein is a pretty good item, but isn&#39;t that a little <br/>\nmuch for it? Let&#39;s be a little realistic here now - I want one, but that&#39;s a <br/>\ntad bit much for it!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
