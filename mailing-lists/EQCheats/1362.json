If you were to speak with Ulan Meadowgreen and ask<br/>\nhim about the greaves, he will tell you about a Dark Elf Necromancer who<br/>\nterrorized his old home town, blah blah blah. Anyway, you need to give the Dark<br/>\nCirclet and I believe 2 Star Rubies to Ulan (or his brother) to get the<br/>\ngreaves.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way I have found to get the cheapest prices on gems for the crafted<br/>\narmor quests, is to make a Female Human Enchanter and base her in Freeport.<br/>\nBring her over to the blue house just outside the market area that has the bank<br/>\nin it. The blue building is the gem shop. My lvl 1 Female Human Enchanter gets<br/>\nstar rubies for 68p, Sapphires for 105p. Cheapest prices around. That would<br/>\nmean a pair of gauntlets 136p and you can easily sell them for 200p.<br/>\n<br/>\n+AD4AKgAqACoAKg-IMPORTANT NOTE+ACEAKgAqACoAKg-<br/>\nFor the Crafted Armor quests, if they ask for 2 or more of the same gem, when<br/>\nyou give them the gems and the component, DO NOT stack the gems. Make sure you<br/>\nseparate each of them but give them all at one time.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample: Crafted gauntlets call for an Aviak Charm and 2 Star Rubies. Give the<br/>\ncentaur the aviak charm, then 1 ruby, then another. So out of the 4 slots<br/>\navailable in the GIVE window, 3 are occupied.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Gaidal Cain<br/>\n30 Barbarian Warrior<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n               Free Games +ACY- Cash Prizes+ACE-<br/>\n Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest +ACY- Best Game Show Site+ACE-<br/>\n+AD4APA-a href+AD0AIg- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/gamesville2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/gamesville2</a> +ACIAPg-Click Here/a<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet paid to surf the web+ACE- Free+ACE-<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alladvantage.com/go.asp?refid+AD0-bvf753\">http://www.alladvantage.com/go.asp?refid+AD0-bvf753</a><br/>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
