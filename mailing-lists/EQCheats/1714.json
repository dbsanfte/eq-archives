Shaman and have made it so far to 12th level,<br/>\n&gt; the starting Intel. is 60 for the class/race. I Got a really great<br/>\n&gt; set of arms (Giant scalemail arms) it give +3 wis, +20 hps -3 int<br/>\n&gt; which reduces my intel to 57. I Juat got a Good spear for my class<br/>\n&gt; and level and am trying to learn it up in skill levels, I have added<br/>\n&gt; 10 points to Pierceing and been stabing the &quot;Heck&quot; out of anything I<br/>\n&gt; con Light Blue or higher and have not gone up one poing in pierceing.<br/>\n&gt; Now to what I wanted to know.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does the Dif. between an intel. of 60 and that of 57 make any change<br/>\n&gt; in how well I Learn skills with use? If so then I have a great set of<br/>\n&gt; arms that a spell slinger can use on the server I am on and if not<br/>\n&gt; then how high do I need to raise my Intel to learn quicker?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Frezslice<br/>\n&gt; Bar.
