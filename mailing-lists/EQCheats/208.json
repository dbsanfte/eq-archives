However, I have a few odds and ends that I have<br/>\npicked up in my travels.  Some of this stuff is what I have heard, so<br/>\ntake it as you will.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a glowing torch found on a rare spawn in Lavastorm...It gives 4<br/>\nAC, adds +5 charisma, and can be used as a lighting source when held in<br/>\nyour hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter receiving the Squad Ring from the quest in Riverdale, you can use<br/>\nit to kill Nillipus fairly easily.  All you have to do is lure Nillipus<br/>\ninto the cleric&#39;s guide, where the ring can be recharged, and then use<br/>\nthe ring when you are low on health.  You can then recharge the ring at<br/>\none on the NPC&#39;s.  I do not have the squad ring yet, so i can not verify<br/>\nthat this works.  I would appreciate it if someone would tell me how to<br/>\nrecharge the ring?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen talking to NPC&#39;s, they give keywords in brackets.  To activate<br/>\nthese keywords you have to ask a question using the keyword.  Usually, a<br/>\nsimple question such as What [keyword]? will do the trick.  However,<br/>\nwhen the keyword is a person, then it requires a Who [keyword]?  I know<br/>\nthis sounds pretty simple, but it took me forever to figure out.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a pair of Shiny Silk Gloves which are found on the Queen<br/>\nSpider in Lesser Faydark, i forget stats but I believe they are<br/>\nmagical.  It would take about a level 16 group to get them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, that about ends my knowledge...know, i have a request for a few<br/>\nspoilers of my own<br/>\nMost of these deal with packs or  bags which reduce the weight of things<br/>\nput inside...<br/>\nFor all of these, I would love to have information on:<br/>\n% of weight reduction<br/>\nwhere it is found<br/>\nwhat level to get it<br/>\nhow much do they sell for<br/>\n<br/>\nShralok Pack- I know it comes from Highhold Pass, thats it<br/>\n<br/>\nBag of Sewn Evil Eye- Found in Lower Guk?, 8 slots<br/>\n<br/>\nTraveler&#39;s Backpack- found on Rathyl in Najena, need to get keys or<br/>\nsomething to find him<br/>\n<br/>\nTraveler&#39;s Pouch- found on Rathyl in Najena, can only hold small items<br/>\n<br/>\nTraveler&#39;s Pack- reduces weight by 20%, 8 slots, sometimes reward for<br/>\nNillipus quest<br/>\n<br/>\nArchaelogist&#39;s Pack- found on Goblin Archaelogist in Permafrost, 6 slots<br/>\n<br/>\nLionhide Backpack- found in South Karana? off of a rare spawn<br/>\n<br/>\nPierce&#39;s Pouch of Storing- reduces weight of items by 50-75%, 8 slots,<br/>\nsometimes a reward from Nillipus quest<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you know of anymore weight reduces packs, and have information on<br/>\nwhere to get them, please let me know...Any information about these<br/>\nitems would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, where is the best place to find black pearls if I wanted to buy<br/>\nthem?<br/>\nAnd info on the Serpent Skin Eyepatch would be appreciated...<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry so long,<br/>\nAll help is appreciated,<br/>\n<br/>\nGrimlin<br/>\nLevel 16 Monk<br/>\nBristlebane server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
