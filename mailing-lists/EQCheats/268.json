I would look there if the updates were timely.<br/>\nProblem is, ppl with the neat weapons usually don&#39;t tell<br/>\nwhere they got them from.<br/>\n<br/>\nCamping, you know?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJason Harrell wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason Harrell&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jharrell@...\">jharrell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think this would be a good forum to ask for this.  Currently I am<br/>\n&gt; developing a site for EQ dedicated strictly to the items, how to get them,<br/>\n&gt; and buy/sell them (in game only of course).  I&#39;m not interested in the<br/>\n&gt; standard Leather Arms, etc. There are plenty of sites out there that deal<br/>\n&gt; with this. I *am* interested in anything out of the ordinary, where it came<br/>\n&gt; from and the quest associated with it. This is a full-on spoiler option,<br/>\n&gt; which I have no personal problem with, and if you&#39;re subscribed to this list<br/>\n&gt; neither should you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All I ask is 3 quick things for submissions: a screen shot displaying the<br/>\n&gt; item and the stats on it, a brief description of how you came across it, and<br/>\n&gt; the quest information associated. The second two are optional since even I<br/>\n&gt; hate campers, but they&#39;d really help those of us who go get the item, then<br/>\n&gt; leave the spawn to the others to do the same.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A. Would EQ players go to this site?<br/>\n&gt; B. Is this a good idea?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone wishing to help out will get credit on the site for the submissions<br/>\n&gt; (of course).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; E-mail any submissions to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trajen@...\">trajen@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks all!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Trajen D&#39;Fraust<br/>\n&gt; Barbarian Shaman<br/>\n&gt; Lord of the Divinity, Order of Deus Vult<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Check out this week&#39;s ONElist of the week.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; How is ONElist changing YOUR life?
