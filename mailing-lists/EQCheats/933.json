Why do I<br/>\nhave to sit for 20 hours to get jboots with my lvl 35 char and get no experience at all? I pay to<br/>\nplay this game. I find most of it amusing and fun. I don&#39;t find the camping and the killstealing<br/>\nthat follows it hand in hand very amusing. Why can&#39;t I complain about an unwanted feature in a<br/>\nproduct I pay for?<br/>\n<br/>\n/A<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; this arguement though is just going to fall on deaf ears.. I for one can<br/>\n&gt; time a lot of spawns great... late at night I can come on for say 2 hours<br/>\n&gt; and totally rotate every npc spawn in for ex. upper guk (scyer, ancient<br/>\n&gt; croc, warden, squire, giant spider) &lt;not the lord.. yet at least&gt;... and I<br/>\n&gt; usually come away with at least one good item... now maybe I dont &quot;NEED&quot;<br/>\n&gt; this item but I do get some mighty nice items which are then used to trade<br/>\n&gt; for other stuff that I do need.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So this dumb arguement about 20 hours being required for every single nice<br/>\n&gt; item is not a valid one.  Yes for ruby you usually do have to camp for hours<br/>\n&gt; unless your lucky but I have known a few people to get their lucky breaks<br/>\n&gt; (for ex. a friend of mine was camping the avatar of fear.. wasnt there for<br/>\n&gt; more then 15min, the avatar spawned.. and he was carrying a Ruby BP).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, I think the point the guy was trying to make is &quot;have fun&quot; if your not<br/>\n&gt; having fun then you shouldnt be playing? er better yet why are you playing<br/>\n&gt; if your not overall having fun?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A sign of power in my book would be one that gets by without having to whine<br/>\n&gt; 24/7...<br/>\n&gt; =D<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ok lets get back on topic.. anyone know the ratio of times the Lord in upper<br/>\n&gt; guk will be carrying the ghoulsbane as compared to the silvered bracer? heh<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
