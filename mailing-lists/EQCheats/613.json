The RP aspects of this game are<br/>\n\tabout 1/10th of UO&#39;s even though that game was riddled<br/>\n\twith Player Killers, bugs and exploits. I enjoy the<br/>\n\tgame, but I feel after playing similar game types that<br/>\n\tthis game corrals you more into the powergamer role. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tI get into the mindset that I can play this game for a<br/>\n\tfew hours and be about the same as I started or I can<br/>\n\tplay something like Heroes of Might and Magic III and<br/>\n\tgo through a few scenarios. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tI will more likely plan to leave due to slow leveling<br/>\n\tthan I would if I would see constant improvements in<br/>\n\tmy character. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tEven level 50s still have to go in two full groups to<br/>\n\ttake on the tougher stuff like the dragons. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tBelgarth Wolfstrider <br/>\n<br/>\n\t--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seekerslady@...\">seekerslady@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seekerslady@...\">seekerslady@...</a><br/>\n\t&gt; <br/>\n\t&gt; I used to play meridian 59. I loved this game but<br/>\n\t&gt; people got burned out on<br/>\n\t&gt; it becuase you could build too fast and then got<br/>\n\t&gt; bored. Then people went<br/>\n\t&gt; around and PKed each other. It turned a wonderful<br/>\n\t&gt; online community into a<br/>\n\t&gt; garbage dump. What is your great hurry? You planning<br/>\n\t&gt; on leaving soon? As<br/>\n\t&gt; long as you are having fun and meeting new people<br/>\n\t&gt; and playing a game you<br/>\n\t&gt; like what difference does it make what level you are<br/>\n\t&gt; or how fast you get<br/>\n\t&gt; there. These games are ment to be played for years<br/>\n\t&gt; not weeks. I am<br/>\n\t&gt; surprised that people have already been able to max<br/>\n\t&gt; out. Now what do they<br/>\n\t&gt; have to do? Ok they can go anywhere and kill almost<br/>\n\t&gt; anything but how long<br/>\n\t&gt; before they get bored and move on? The game has only<br/>\n\t&gt; been out a few months.<br/>\n\t&gt; <br/>\n\t&gt; Just my 2 cents<br/>\n\t&gt; <br/>\n\t&gt; Feather Dreamwalker of Rathe<br/>\n\t&gt; &gt;<br/>\n\t&gt; &gt;I agree that level gaining is quite slow. 8-10<br/>\n\t&gt; hours<br/>\n\t&gt; &gt;for a level is a bit much. I can&#39;t imagine the high<br/>\n\t&gt; &gt;30s and above. <br/>\n\t&gt; &gt;<br/>\n\t&gt; &gt;Belgarth <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\tStart a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\n\tFor details on ONElist&#39;s NEW FRIENDS & FAMILY program, go to<br/>\n\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n\tFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the<br/>\nnet goto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
