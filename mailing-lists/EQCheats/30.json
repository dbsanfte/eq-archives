As a guild leader I can say this. If we<br/>\n&gt; were to give someone 10 plat and they quit, who cares! I am surprised a<br/>\n&gt; guild would invite someone with selfish motives, but none the less<br/>\nleeching<br/>\n&gt; off a guild does not hinder them, they are many people what is 10 plat to<br/>\n&gt; 30 people? Or 600 plat for that matter (two of my guild members made that<br/>\n&gt; in 3 days in our cash cow hunting grounds, they were both lev 22-24) Even<br/>\n&gt; if you suckered a guild out of a lot of money (Say 25 plat at lev 6) it<br/>\n&gt; will only hurt you. You will be remembered.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just thought it was funny you using this as a valid tactic. Why stop at<br/>\n&gt; 10 plat, why not stay a member and get 20 plat, or full banded armor? Hey<br/>\n&gt; why not just stay a member the whole way through and get the really good<br/>\n&gt; stuff?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 13, 1999 11:48 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQCheats] Not sure<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not sure about the sense heading. But at level 6, to make 10 plat quick.<br/>\nIs<br/>\n&gt; to join a guild, get high level guild members to give you stuff. Then go<br/>\n&gt; sell<br/>\n&gt; and quit guild. How you like that? Bwahahahah!! I am a Dark Elf Cleric,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; have about 17 plat in bank. Just from saving. I have basic armor, so do<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; need anymore for a while, and do not need anything until level 9 and<br/>\n&gt; spells.<br/>\n&gt; So I have just been saving and that is what I have so far. Not too hard,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; I am gaining exp along the way. So it is all worth it. Anyone know where I<br/>\n&gt; could get Fine Steel Weapons, or armor off of monsters?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that knowledge is power?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new ONElist e-mail community and strengthen your mind!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\n&gt; goto www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; You can now easily share photos and documents with your fellow list<br/>\nmembers<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out our homepage for details on how to use our new shared files<br/>\nfeature!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
