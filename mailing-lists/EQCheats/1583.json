When you make it to East<br/>\nK, head east across the zone until you get to a Valley.  This is the same<br/>\nvalley that leads to High Pass.  I am pretty sure the north south loc is<br/>\nzero.  You can also follow the path from the bridge, just go towards High<br/>\nPass.  When you get to the entrance, Almost everyone will take the path<br/>\ngoing up.  You need the one that is level, or down.  She is near the very<br/>\nend.  you will have to run a long way, maybe 10 min, down that valley to get<br/>\nto her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for getting past the raiders, you can also try passing them by swimming<br/>\nunder water or during the rain.  The rain will lower the distance that they<br/>\ncan see.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rose M.
