I gave the key to the banker in HighHold Keep <br/>\nand received a second staff segment.  I&#39;m now stuck.  Does <br/>\nanyone know what to do with these segments, and what the end <br/>\nresult will be?  All the looking I&#39;ve done online just seems to <br/>\nsuggest that this is for a &quot;battle staff&quot; but no one seems to know <br/>\nwhat to do to get it.  Rumor is that Lady McCabe in HighHold Keep <br/>\nmay be involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny and all help is appreciated.  I&#39;m getting tired of carrying them <br/>\naround now that these darn things are NO DROP.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n--Aaldiana D&#39;Ozz<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------<br/>\nHigh Elf<br/>\nCleric<br/>\nMetal Babe<br/>\nHonorBound (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mav.nu/hb)\">http://mav.nu/hb)</a><br/>\n---------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
