Not to <br/>\nmention that the red hue looks outstanding on a DESK! 8) Getting rubi armor <br/>\nwas one the few last things I had to look forward to for my DESK, (seeing as <br/>\nhow they continuously nerf everything else worthwhile for SK&#39;s). I just wish <br/>\nVerant would think these things out before they go nerfing them the way they <br/>\nalways do, and then they end up spending the next 2 months or so trying to <br/>\nundo what they did to correct the original problem. It would have been much <br/>\nbetter/easier to make rubi no drop/trade lore, or even make it a quest <br/>\nreward (something like crafted, but not quite so easily obtained).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I hear, they&#39;re replacing rubi with class specific armor, which is <br/>\nall fine and dandy, but will any of it have the same regen properties as the <br/>\nrubi BP? Anyone on the test server know?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
