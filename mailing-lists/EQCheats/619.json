But , with a<br/>\nlittle<br/>\n&gt;  ingenuity, one could think up possibly buying a few summoned bags off of<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt;  shaman  or doing the traveler&#39;s backback quest - both items which make<br/>\n&gt;  anything in them weightless.  I have done the majority of all my<br/>\n&gt;  blacksmithing and pottery by fetching the materials from the mudites, and<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt;  has been long tedious and at times down right irritating, but i&#39;ve worked<br/>\n&gt;  hard for what i&#39;ve made :) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually the travellers pack only reduces wqeight by 20%. Same with<br/>\npierce&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; pack or storing. The summoned bags you are correct on however.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Renaldo Singer of the 18th song<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html\">http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html</a><br/>\n&gt; With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
