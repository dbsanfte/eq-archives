I love to duel --","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2064407848\">No, you don&#39;t lose exp from dueling or PvP.  I belive you lose exp in a duel<br/>\nif you die from a DOT or a pet, but this may have been fixed.  I love to<br/>\nduel -- my guild often holds sparring matches, not only to test drive your<br/>\nchar in PvP, but we compare characters and do groups duels to find the best<br/>\ngroup PvP combos. (We are a dark race guild on Rallos Zek, so we role-play<br/>\nevil).  I think that when we do group sparring, it is the best way to<br/>\npractice PvP.  Esp when you go hunting humans, like we do.  Strategies<br/>\nagainst a good necro and his pet do not always apply to a SK/Cleric combo.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said before, I am a Cleric and I LOVE grouping with my Enchanter<br/>\nfriend.  After we buff each other, we have about 300 extra AC and HP&#39;s if<br/>\nnot more... after all, with the two of us in a group we have some of the<br/>\nbest buffing spells in the game.  When I am NOT fighting with a warriorr<br/>\nclass, it is hard because as soon as I smite/expulse, I am targeted and it<br/>\nit too hard to heal or cast because my concentration is broken.  The only<br/>\nreason I like to fight with a SK is they taunt.  But with my enchanter<br/>\nfriend, you get it all -- I buff, he de-buffs, I smite, his pet taunts, and<br/>\nhis pets also double-attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAzboklin, you&#39;re right about pets in general.  I think it&#39;s just a matter of<br/>\npersonal preference.  imho though, as a Cleric, and I tihnk being a DE has<br/>\nsomething to do with it -- Enchanters are the BEST to group with and PvP<br/>\nwith.  But to answer your questions, no you don&#39;t lose exp in PvP yes you<br/>\nlose all the money on your person and the victor has his choice of one item<br/>\nfrom your inventory (heh which is why when I am about to die I shove my<br/>\nscreaming mace in my bag)<br/>\n<br/>\n--Venkman, Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Scott Murawski [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 29, 1999 1:22 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQCheats] Digest Number 39<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Scott Murawski &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGeez, this list is active like nuts!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m interested in the dueling stuff.<br/>\nDo you loose exp if you die in a /duel match or one of those pvp areas like<br/>\nin qeynos?<br/>\nYou loose the money you currently have on you?  Do you loose any items?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so psyched that lots o people say enchanters kick ass, cause I&#39;m an<br/>\nenchanter (yay!).<br/>\n<br/>\nNecro pets are definately way more powerful and necs of the same level can<br/>\nsummon higher level pets<br/>\nthan enchanters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trick with enchanter pets is if you can get debuffs off on the mob<br/>\nbefore anything (like languid pace), your pet has a WAY much better chance<br/>\nof surviving.<br/>\n<br/>\nI get annoyed too cause sometimes my pets are weak and die REALLY REALLY<br/>\nFAST, but if I get a decent<br/>\none, and treat it nice, its good to me too.  And I make sure to be careful<br/>\n(not have a pet) when running around places with aggressive mobs.  Thats<br/>\nwhen pets really suck big time.
