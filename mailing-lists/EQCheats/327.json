Go to www.onelist.com.<br/>\nI&#39;m 90% sure you had to go to that web site to subscribe to the damn list in<br/>\nthe first place anyway... and they made you pick a password for your email<br/>\naddress. Log on with your email address and password and you can either (A)<br/>\nunsubscribe or (B) change any list to DIGEST format, which puts up to like<br/>\n20 mails in ONE email so you NEVER get spammed. Try it out. In fact,<br/>\nremember this for any lists you subscribe to in the future; most listservs<br/>\nhave a DIGEST option to reduce spam. I subscribe to over TEN lists and never<br/>\nhave to worry about my mailbox being cluttered because each message is<br/>\nclearly marked with the name of the list in the subject line, and says<br/>\nDigest. Good luck to you all, pass this knowledge along to anyone you know<br/>\nwho likes mailing lists.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
