I&#39;ve<br/>\nben with a couple, and people can make them work, but people can make ANY<br/>\nclass work. I heard necros are pretty darn powerful at certain things. And,<br/>\nmost every class has a good niche. I, personally, don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever play<br/>\none. I HATE being KOS.

They have been fixing all the probs<br/>\nwith the Necro&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s see.   DOT bug.   corpse dissappears .. no loot no exp nothing<br/>\n<br/>\nPets - ?  are you kidding ... Cant use in Duels unless your are +PVP.<br/>\n  And pets are exceedingly dangerous in dungeons as they will either<br/>\nself-destruct at any time, or randomly smack any npc they go by.   <br/>\nImagine EVERY npc in a dungeon coming after you then your tank (pet)<br/>\nself destructing ! ! ! Happened to me in PAW !<br/>\nAnd another stupid thing about pets.  Even if you get a decent one if<br/>\nsome dumbass gives a good pet a pathetic weapon like a Splintered Club<br/>\n- he becomes useless.  And you have to recast and recast till you get<br/>\na decent pet.   Summon a green pet and watch how long he lasts.  I<br/>\nbelieve I have actually heard the OTHER critters Laughing ...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd No, Necros by themselves are not the masters of Kiting.  Not<br/>\nunless they have someone else cast the SOW on them.  Cause The<br/>\nDarkness line sure isnt enough.  We have fewer spells.  And are only<br/>\nreally really powerfull when it comes to undead.   That&#39;s IF you can:<br/>\n1. Find the right Words <br/>\n2 MAKE THE SPELLS.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCant just go out and buy them.    No pet spells past 20 or 24 ... all<br/>\nare Research.   I know a lvl 45 nec that only has 40% of his higher<br/>\nlvl spells because He cant find the components to make his spells.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHated by some NPC&#39;s.  Try hated by NPC&#39;s in ALL cities.   Randomly<br/>\nkilled.  MOST vendors will not deal with you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh and did you also forget that NECROMANCERS have the LOWEST hit<br/>\npoints in the game.   DUH.. didn&#39;t know that one huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did I miss?   Oh the ROOT Spell ? You&#39;re joking right.  Necro&#39;s<br/>\nget Root at lvl 34.   And I have been told that root at that lvl is<br/>\ntotally pathetic.<br/>\n<br/>\nShock of poison?   It&#39;s at lvl 24.   Does 145 .   At that lvl that is<br/>\nnot a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd your assumptions as to what the damage of our spell are is wayyy<br/>\noff.  Even it the 3 DOT of death is not resisted (which is not common<br/>\neven on greens and blues) they do NOT do 400 in a minute.  Not in 2<br/>\nMINUTES.   Those DOT&#39;s take a LONG time to do all their damage.  And<br/>\nwhen all 3 do hit the critters compleltly forget about your pet.   And<br/>\ncome after you.   Pets taunting  is pathetic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Lets talk Armor and Weapons.   Oh wait.   Necro not only dont get<br/>\ndecent armor.  Are exclued from of MOST of the really nice magic<br/>\nbuffing Items.  Did you notice that STAFF OF THE ORACLE on the Dark<br/>\nSide page.  Look closely... Necro&#39;s cant even use it.    Dagger of<br/>\nMarnek ?   Only Necro only item I have seen.  <br/>\nDmg 3 attack 30.....  At least till you can get a Writhing Staff...<br/>\nlets see they are running 500 plat on the rathe....     yea.. easy<br/>\nthere.. NOT.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou think necro&#39;s have it so easy ... try to play one.   Watch how<br/>\nmuch being hated increases prices....   being KOS&#39;s everywhere slows<br/>\nyou down...   When you have played one up to 16 or so .... then lets<br/>\nsee how much you would think they are overpowered...   till then...<br/>\n<br/>\nGET OVER IT ! ! ! <br/>\n<br/>\nThanos, HUMAN Necromancer    the Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Fling, Kirby&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FlingKirby@...\">FlingKirby@...</a>&gt; 07/23 1:42 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Fling, Kirby&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FlingKirby@...\">FlingKirby@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, with all that said... does anybody else think that necros are<br/>\nvastly<br/>\noverpowered?  They do FAR more damage than any other class at all<br/>\nlevels,<br/>\nthey get pretty much every combat-utility spell that any other class<br/>\ngets<br/>\n(like roots, disempowers, debuffs, etc), AND get the ability to<br/>\nsummon pets<br/>\nof higher level than any other class.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to be a huge bitch or anything.  I was fine with that at first,<br/>\nbut<br/>\nsince EVERY recent patch has included further buffing or tuning of<br/>\nthe necro<br/>\nclass it just seems to be getting a little absurd to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomebody tell me what the drawback is for their class...  being hated<br/>\nby<br/>\nsome NPCs?  After having played a troll for several months and being<br/>\nKOS by<br/>\nEVERY npc north of innothule.... the necros have it easy... like<br/>\nsuper-easy.<br/>\nThen they went and gimped the shamans and I just honestly can&#39;t<br/>\nfigure out<br/>\nwhat is going on.  I&#39;m guessing I&#39;m not seeing the whole picture or<br/>\nsomething.... because recent events just haven&#39;t made any sense to<br/>\nthis<br/>\nstupid troll.<br/>\n<br/>\n-K<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nHeart Flutter also drops a monsters AC by 47 and his str by 17, hit<br/>\nit with<br/>\nthe 1st lvl spell Siphon Str and that gives 10 more Str to you.
