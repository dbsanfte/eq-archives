Win 98 supports dual<br/>\n&gt;monitors, I&#39;ve seen it done back in Beta when we were testing it.... I also<br/>\n&gt;work coding programs for DINPACS systems, which often use 2 or more HIGH<br/>\n&gt;(2400x2000) res monitors... Now, given the way EQ works, I DOUBT that EQ<br/>\n&gt;would come up on one screen and the other would be the rest of the desktop,<br/>\n&gt;but it MIGHT be possible to get to work, I&#39;m not sure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyone tried this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, I wonder if you could write a program that would send a windows<br/>\n&gt;message to EQ that would minimize or &#39;restore&#39; (take to a smaller window)<br/>\n&gt;EQ. Now, THAT might be worth investigating... Anyone tried this? I could<br/>\n&gt;probably figure out a way to find the handle for the EQ window and have a<br/>\n&gt;program runing in the background automatically send it a restore message<br/>\n&gt;after EQ loads... Wouldn&#39;t that be cool....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Leod<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s way cool and highly feasible.
