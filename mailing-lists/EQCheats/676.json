(Kind of like Fletching&#39;s limited market, only worse.) \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHaving been asked by a Rogue friend to put another now useless Mastery to work we set out to a well stocked supplier and loaded up on equipment to use at the wheel. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFifteen Plat later we were no closer to making a Vail or Sealed Vial, and too frustrated to attempt the Plat+ style. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSomeone has to know the correct mix by now. After all, it was on the Test Server before release. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI can state what DOESN&#39;T work for the Vial since I started taking Mix Notes by the time we started getting low on coin. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe following combinations WILL NOT make a Vial:\r<br/>\n(Sketch and Water are assumed requirements) \r<br/>\nSmall Block \r<br/>\nSmall Block and Glass Shards \r<br/>\nSmall Block and Metal Bits \r<br/>\nTwo Small Blocks and Metal Bits \r<br/>\nTwo Small Blocks, Metal Bits, and Glass Shards \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nBlock of Clay \r<br/>\nTwo Blocks \r<br/>\nBlock and Glass Shards \r<br/>\nBlock and Metal Bits \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLarge Block \r<br/>\nLarge Block and Glass Bits \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe last two groupings (Block and L.Block)are guesses on what we used. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnyone have better success? Or further additions of what NOT to try so we all aren&#39;t wasting coin on an already destroyed Skill? \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA Master Potter with no market, \r<br/>\nA Master Fletcher with a minimal market, \r<br/>\nand a Master Smith with a rapidly shrinking market</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
