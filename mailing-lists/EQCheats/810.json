Can anyone charge a proofreading fee?<br/>\nWhat exactly is it? I guess I&#39;ve been out of the scaming business too long<br/>\n;).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is how my lawyer put it to me.  If someone sends you unsolicited email<br/>\nonce it is fine, but if you warn them after that email saying the following<br/>\nor close to it &quot;any further emails to this address will cost a certain<br/>\namount of money to proofread&quot; it is legally binding.  If the person does not<br/>\nmake a payment within 3 months you can take them to small claims court and<br/>\ncharge interest on your time and work.  When you warn them, and they send<br/>\nyou another email just correct it and send it back to them.  Afterwards<br/>\nstart litigation.  This is an excellent way to stop hate/spam/annoying<br/>\nemails.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
