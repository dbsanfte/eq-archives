Ever since level 8 I&#39;ve been in Steamfront killing skeles and<br/>\nclockworks. Now everything con&#39;s green (except for mino&#39;s, and they&#39;re<br/>\nusually heavily camped). Where should I be hunting now? Crushbone is way too<br/>\noverpopulated, on Tarew Marr at least. I just need somewhere to hunt until I<br/>\nhit 14 then I&#39;ll go to Unrest. Thanks for any help.<br/>\n <br/>\n Tanthalias<br/>\n Half Elven Bard, 12th Level<br/>\n Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
