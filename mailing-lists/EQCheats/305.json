I haven&#39;t yet figured out the Troll SK for the BBC (and<br/>\nI&#39;ve gotten about 5 BBC&#39;s  between me and parties I&#39;ve been in). SK will<br/>\nspawn anywhere form 30 minutes to 6 hours.... I seen him spawn 30 minutes<br/>\nafter we killed him once, 2 BBCs in 30 minutes is nice... And, he hadden&#39;t<br/>\nspawned more than once in 10 hours that entire day. The line is supposed to<br/>\nbe the spikes. Don&#39;t pass the spikes if you can help it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Thurg robes necro will spawn in a pattern. On the spot that she spawns,<br/>\nspawns ghouls, necros, and the priest (take some firepower in for the<br/>\npriest). She will NOT spawn (and the others will) if your past the last<br/>\nledge and actually in the room. You need to be atleast on the last<br/>\nstep/ledge going into the room. My guess, is that robes are possible every<br/>\n30 or 40 minutes if done right.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Zantaer, Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jesper.Sallander@...\">Jesper.Sallander@...</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jesper.Sallander@...\">Jesper.Sallander@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 30, 1999 10:55 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQCheats] Question for Befallen Buffs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jesper.Sallander@...\">Jesper.Sallander@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHi all.  I have a question or two about the basement of Befallen...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went down in hopes of getting a BBC for our Pally last night.  We were<br/>\nthere for two hours or so, and never saw the SK.  We were told that there is<br/>\na &quot;spawn line&quot;, ie, don&#39;t cross it or the SK will not spawn.  Is this the<br/>\ncase?  If so, is that line at the end of the tunnel?  Or inside the room?<br/>\nIt was fairly frustrating.  Also, there was another group there camping for<br/>\nthe Robes, and I never saw that Theor..they...whatever guy that is supposed<br/>\nto drop the robes.  Does the same thing apply for him?<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly..how often would you say the SK would normally spawn?  Every 1/2<br/>\nhour?  Hour?  2 hours?  I probably will not return to Befallen, unless it is<br/>\nwith my Paladin with the objective of getting that BBC for him....so the<br/>\ninfo would be appreciated.  That place is just swarming with DE&#39;s, and it<br/>\nmakes my dwarven skin crawl.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nDameat<br/>\n14th Level Dwarven Cleric (AND Master Brewer)<br/>\nRodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFind people who care about what you care about.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAt ONElist:  your connection to community.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
