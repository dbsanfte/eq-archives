Some people spent<br/>\na bunch of money on failures to bring their skill up<br/>\nto master to make money, now they aren&#39;t going to make<br/>\nany. Sounds like what they did to fletching, raised<br/>\nskill check by 600%. People with 190+ fletching were<br/>\ninstant gods of bowmaking. It would cost 1000s of<br/>\nplatinum to get there now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelgarth Wolfstrider <br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry guys....<br/>\n&gt; I have to side with Verant on Nerfing the<br/>\n&gt; Pottery/Brewing type skills.<br/>\n&gt; If you guys want to sit around doing these<br/>\n&gt; monotonous, boring vendor-type<br/>\n&gt; skills, than I guess that is your prerogative...BUT<br/>\n&gt; I sure don&#39;t see where<br/>\n&gt; you guys should be making 8-10 times the profit in<br/>\n&gt; an hour that a person can<br/>\n&gt; make out fighting monsters.<br/>\n&gt; Agreed, they seem to be going a little overboard<br/>\n&gt; with there &#39;corrections&#39;.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think it should be impossible for you to<br/>\n&gt; make money selling made<br/>\n&gt; items to NPCs, but the amount of money that you make<br/>\n&gt; should be very<br/>\n&gt; comparable to what I can make out there gathering<br/>\n&gt; loot off of MOBs.  My<br/>\n&gt; impression (please feel free to correct me if I am<br/>\n&gt; wrong!) is that you guys<br/>\n&gt; are the same group of people that made hundreds of<br/>\n&gt; millions of TONS of<br/>\n&gt; surplus Tailoring-made items in UO - you chose to<br/>\n&gt; spend time working up your<br/>\n&gt; Tailor so you could provide your mage with enough<br/>\n&gt; money to buy reagents.<br/>\n&gt; True?<br/>\n&gt; The point I&#39;m trying to make is that you guys were<br/>\n&gt; taking advantage of the<br/>\n&gt; system...using in imbalance in the pricing structure<br/>\n&gt; to make a LOT more cash<br/>\n&gt; than you should have been able to make by using<br/>\n&gt; trade skills.  Be happy that<br/>\n&gt; you got to take advantage of the system as long as<br/>\n&gt; you did.  But PLEASE<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t whine when they try to balance things out...it<br/>\n&gt; trivializes the real<br/>\n&gt; issues around game balance.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your time.<br/>\n&gt; Flame away  :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Doug Sorensen<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:belgarth_of_surefall@...\">belgarth_of_surefall@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 26, 1999 12:13 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQCheats] Pottery<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Doug Sorensen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:belgarth_of_surefall@...\">belgarth_of_surefall@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Now you can try to sell all those fine pottery<br/>\n&gt; Wares<br/>\n&gt; to the Players! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Belgarth auctions Large Bowl only 2 Plat! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This game is sucking worse every day.
