THEN doesn&#39;t read the email that was sent to him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and is planning on going<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to small claims court to get the fee?

He sent me an email this morning<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that was lengthy and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; didn&#39;t even bother reading it.  Again (to the people of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the list), do not send me<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; private emails.
