The other 5<br/>\npeople all got charmed in our group...  they started attacking while I was<br/>\nAFK, so I got there halfway through the battle.  I unloaded all my manna at<br/>\nthe eye and successfully killed it.  I got an experience message, but nobody<br/>\nelse in the group did.  My current theory is that once you are charmed, you<br/>\ncount as a monster, and won&#39;t get the experience message for any group kills<br/>\nduring that time.  Unfortunately, this is also hard to test.  Unfortunately<br/>\nthat mishap resulted in the death of more than half our party... but when I<br/>\nlooked at my XP-o-meter, I got a huge chunk of XP from the fight (if my<br/>\ntheory is correct, I got all of the XP)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kzak<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nWhen fighting evil eyes in the gorge the other night, I hit the sit button<br/>\nwhile charmed somehow. The result was canceling the charm, which allowed me<br/>\nto continue with my battle. I managed to do this repeatedly throughout the<br/>\nnight. This could be a coincidence or an actual bug in the game, I&#39;m not<br/>\nsure. Since I felt it was cheating, I quit doing it and left the gorge+ADs-<br/>\nafter all, I only wanted another Polished Bone Bracer +ADs-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can WIN +ACQ-100 to Amazon.com+ACE-<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nIf you join ONElists FRIENDS +ACY- FAMILY program.
