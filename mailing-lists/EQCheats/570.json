It would<br/>\nonly ruin it for everyone (just kidding)...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut seriously...  It COSTS a lot to take up a skill... Especially one like<br/>\nSmithing... You will pay out about 200-300plat to learn enough to be able to<br/>\nmake Banded armor... Then you will FINALLY be able to sell something for<br/>\nover your cost (everything else costs more to make than it does to sell to<br/>\nan NPC, and PC&#39;s don&#39;t buy things like Files, Scalers and Skewers, so the<br/>\nonly customer you have is the NPC (can you say monopoly?)... But while I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it fair to make a HUGE profit from NPC&#39;s, it would be nice if<br/>\nyou could simply get you money back on the SUCCESSFUL items...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd is it really any different sitting around a forge or oven making and<br/>\nselling things, than for those that are *harvesting* items from the NPC&#39;s in<br/>\nplaces like Unrest and HighHold??  I don&#39;t think so, and I would almost bet<br/>\nmoney you don&#39;t mind doing that!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I have never seen anyone CAMP a forge, and even if they did, and<br/>\nthere were others waiting &#39;in line&#39;, eventually they would leave because<br/>\nthey needed more raw materials (molds, metal, etc.) so others would drop in<br/>\nwhen they left to go get more...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have heard of many groups that camp places like the Tower in Unrest...<br/>\nGetting all the BS armor they can, then sending a member out to sell it off<br/>\nor twink it over to another character so they can come back for more... The<br/>\nother night we ran into such a group, many of them over level 30, who were<br/>\nnot even interested in any of the other mobs that spawned there, only the<br/>\nKnight... And the others would not attack them because they were too high<br/>\nlevel... This is just Harvesting plain and simple...  One of them even told<br/>\nme he just needed to get his characters loot up to 1000 plat in the bank so<br/>\nhe could SELL it at EBAY!!  How sick can you get...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is, they really are fixing the wrong area (skills) in the wrong<br/>\nmanner... Its lousy that some skills cost so little to practice and others<br/>\ncost more... but a person who decides to be a baker, smith, or whatever<br/>\nSHOULD be able to make a profit from PC&#39;s, and should at the very least be<br/>\nat a break even point for items sold to an NPC...<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is too much money in the game already, and that is because there is<br/>\ntoo much LOOT in the game, not because there are too many pie tins or<br/>\nskewers or Bat Wing Crunchies!  If Verant really wants to do something about<br/>\nit, they need to control things like Mobs dropping Bronze armor all the<br/>\ntime, which USED to sell only to PC&#39;s, but which, now that most already have<br/>\nit, gets dumped at the NPC&#39;s for more plat too...<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\nProud member of Platinum Sphere Guild - www.platinumsphere.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 26, 1999 11:56 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQCheats] Pottery<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry guys....<br/>\n&gt; I have to side with Verant on Nerfing the Pottery/Brewing type skills.<br/>\n&gt; If you guys want to sit around doing these monotonous, boring vendor-type<br/>\n&gt; skills, than I guess that is your prerogative...BUT I sure don&#39;t see where<br/>\n&gt; you guys should be making 8-10 times the profit in an hour that a person<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; make out fighting monsters.<br/>\n&gt; Agreed, they seem to be going a little overboard with there &#39;corrections&#39;.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think it should be impossible for you to make money selling made<br/>\n&gt; items to NPCs, but the amount of money that you make should be very<br/>\n&gt; comparable to what I can make out there gathering loot off of MOBs.  My<br/>\n&gt; impression (please feel free to correct me if I am wrong!) is that you<br/>\nguys<br/>\n&gt; are the same group of people that made hundreds of millions of TONS of<br/>\n&gt; surplus Tailoring-made items in UO - you chose to spend time working up<br/>\nyour<br/>\n&gt; Tailor so you could provide your mage with enough money to buy reagents.<br/>\n&gt; True?<br/>\n&gt; The point I&#39;m trying to make is that you guys were taking advantage of the<br/>\n&gt; system...using in imbalance in the pricing structure to make a LOT more<br/>\ncash<br/>\n&gt; than you should have been able to make by using trade skills.  Be happy<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; you got to take advantage of the system as long as you did.
