Probably a toss up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Necromancer vs any of those with any weapon..  Necro wins.  Heh.  Fact<br/>\n&gt; is that Necros (and enchanters too believe it or not) own in PvP at<br/>\n&gt; higher levels (low levels too for necros).  I admit it too..  Paladins<br/>\n&gt; suck at higher lvls.  No where near the tanks that monks or warriors<br/>\n&gt; are.  No where near the healers that clerics are.  The fiery avenger<br/>\n&gt; kinda brings them back up to standard.  But in no means does it make<br/>\n&gt; them invincible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net goto www.everquest.com </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
