She&#39;ll tell you to get her 6 beads and bring<br/>\nthem back to her.<br/>\nWell when I did this I was surprised, I got like 6 iron rations, they sell<br/>\nfor over 2<br/>\nGold apiece. The real shocker though was the fact that I got about half a<br/>\nbubble of exp from it.<br/>\nThe best part of this was I noticed one of the vendors by the 3 tents was<br/>\nselling those<br/>\nBeads and cheap! Well 5 minutes & 3/4ths of a lvl later I finally bought her<br/>\nout of the necklaces.<br/>\nSo whenever you&#39;re in halas, remember to just take a peek at these vendors<br/>\nand see if they<br/>\nHave beads. I was 4th lvl btw when I did this.<br/>\nJohn<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a>]<br/>\n\tSent:\tWednesday, August 04, 1999 5:13 PM<br/>\n\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\tSubject:\tRE: [EQCheats] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\tFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\tLOL...<br/>\n\tHey Lemac: I&#39;ve NEVER seen a High Elf in court!  :)<br/>\n\tAs to this laughable (but not laudable) supposed lawsuit:<br/>\n\tBelow is a copy of the email that Nick sent me, exactly as it<br/>\nappeared to me<br/>\n\t(I&#39;ve included the ENTIRE mail, for those of you that enjoy a good<br/>\nchuckle.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPlease note in the second line of his email that he says that I can<br/>\nemail<br/>\n\thim when my &#39;daddy&#39; stops my college payments.
