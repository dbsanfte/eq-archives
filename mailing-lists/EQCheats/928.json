Yes for ruby you usually do have to camp for hours<br/>\nunless your lucky but I have known a few people to get their lucky breaks<br/>\n(for ex. a friend of mine was camping the avatar of fear.. wasnt there for<br/>\nmore then 15min, the avatar spawned.. and he was carrying a Ruby BP).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I think the point the guy was trying to make is &quot;have fun&quot; if your not<br/>\nhaving fun then you shouldnt be playing? er better yet why are you playing<br/>\nif your not overall having fun?<br/>\n<br/>\nA sign of power in my book would be one that gets by without having to whine<br/>\n24/7...<br/>\n=D<br/>\n<br/>\nok lets get back on topic.. anyone know the ratio of times the Lord in upper<br/>\nguk will be carrying the ghoulsbane as compared to the silvered bracer? heh<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Evelyne Parisien &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hoosta@...\">hoosta@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Saturday, August 14, 1999 6:33 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQCheats] Digest Number 89<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Evelyne Parisien&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hoosta@...\">hoosta@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I guess you just proved our point - you will never get jboots, rubi & stuff<br/>\n&gt;NOT because you suck at playing or you have a lousy character but because<br/>\n&gt;you just don&#39;t have the TIME for camping.  Now thats just plain wrong.
