Monks stink because once your HPs are gone, you are toast.  You<br/>\nforget that Paladins get root also.  We also have Stun which will freeze<br/>\nyour monk to allow us to heal up.  All of your quickness does not do you<br/>\nany good if you can&#39;t move.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is this going on this List anyway ?  I think we need to start a<br/>\nEQbadmouth List for this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never play PvP anyway because I think that it is stupid that someone<br/>\ncould just come up to you and kill you for no other reason.  PvP&#39;s are none<br/>\nother than a bunch of greedy people that want to steal from other people.<br/>\nThat is why I am glad that the designers of this game were wise enough to<br/>\nlimit player killing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTanaman</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
