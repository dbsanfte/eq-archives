The way EQ is set up, any<br/>\nmodifications you make are reflected in YOUR computer&#39;s memory, <br/>\nand maybe even your display, but NOT on veran&#39;ts server. You <br/>\nFEED commands to Verant, the actions are resolved on the server, <br/>\nand the RESULTS are sent back to you. You may modify the commands<br/>\nsent, or the results on your screen, and it won&#39;t change what <br/>\nhappens to your character on verants servers at all. It is a great<br/>\nway to preclude tampering. You may change your screen to show<br/>\n50000pp, but try to buy something.... The next screen update will<br/>\nshow your real totals... Your character and all interaction with it<br/>\nare done BY Verant on their own servers. You have NO real contact with <br/>\nanything that must be modified for any kind of cheat to work. <br/>\n<br/>\nI welcome any questions or comments....</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
