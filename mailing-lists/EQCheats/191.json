They are the evil version of paladins but I see<br/>\nno sword like that for them?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been confirmed on the Holyswords list that Fiery Avenger is a Holy<br/>\nSword and is therefore a Paladin only weapon.  The character that holding<br/>\nthe sword in the picture is a GM and that is why he can hold it.  The fact<br/>\nthat Paladins get the Holy Swords and no one else is to make up for the<br/>\nfact that we get 20% less exp. per kill.  Paladins also are not great<br/>\nfighters like the Warriors, nor are we great healers or buffers like the<br/>\nClerics.<br/>\n<br/>\nTanaman<br/>\nLev 15 Paladin<br/>\nVeeshan Server.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHow has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\nShare your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net goto<br/>\nwww.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
