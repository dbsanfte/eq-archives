You <br/>\nhave plenty of other ways to get experience.  As far as I know helping <br/>\nguards is perfectly legal.  Buffing, healing, and training are all <br/>\nlegal.  You do not HAVE to come there to get experience.  As a matter of <br/>\nfact you make players like me feel bad and YOU are the one who should be <br/>\nwarned IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nManr, Dark Elf Shadow Knight on Povar.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:51 AM 9/22/99 , you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KEPTINPIKE@...\">KEPTINPIKE@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dear Sirs:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     We were killing guards inside Neriak&#39;s foreign quarters.  We play on the<br/>\n&gt;Solusek Ro server.  I play as Keptin Pike.  We were harassed by players there<br/>\n&gt;who were constantly dispelling us and dumping monsters (guards) on us. In<br/>\n&gt;fact they even managed to dump guards on us where Neriak zones to Nektulos<br/>\n&gt;So we got trapped on both sides of the zone due to monster dumping.  Two of<br/>\n&gt;us died. I would like to remind you that we were not killing any vendors or<br/>\n&gt;quest related  NPCs.  Also, in the Foreign Quarter there is no danger to<br/>\n&gt;newbies from anything.<br/>\n&gt;   GM Hidaeki said this was perfectly legal since they were role-playing.<br/>\n&gt;Hmm, I  imagine I can do a lot of harassing and exploiting under the guise of<br/>\n&gt;role-playing.  I asked about the exploit of PVP Switch Avoidance and he<br/>\n&gt;ignored me.  I have posted said exploit below as  posted on your site.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;PvP Switch Avoidance ï¿½ using in-game methods to work around the PvP switch<br/>\n&gt;and allowing non-PvP players to kill other players, such as hall blocking,<br/>\n&gt;dumping of monsters, or spell effects that cross that boundary due to a bug.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please tell me if those players who were killing us fall under this exploit<br/>\n&gt;and can be given an official warning. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
