I wasn&#39;t involved directly, but happend to<br/>\nbe nearby auctioning when this happend.  I never bothered to look it up, but the<br/>\nGMs sure did.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe manual language was pointed out after several instances of guard training<br/>\nwhere several pleayers were warned that this was a bannable offense.  The GM had<br/>\nalready &quot;marked&quot; their account. After the peeps pointed this paragraph out, and<br/>\nabout a half hour, the lead GM said &quot;We (the GMs) were incorrect.  This is not a<br/>\nbannable offense.  I have removed the warning marks from your account.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was there watching the whole thing.  If they have come to some other<br/>\nconclusion since this time, or if this was server specific, then so be it, but<br/>\nthis was the head GM, after contact by several guides and another GM.  I assume<br/>\nthat the 30 minute delay was because they were contacting Verant associates<br/>\nother than the GMs or had a quick GM meeting to discuss this.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
