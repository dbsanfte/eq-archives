I imagine it wouldn&#39; work<br/>\nwithout some extensive setup work, as everything maximized on two monitors<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen takes up both monitors, it&#39;s just real wide. Windows sees it as<br/>\none monitor, but I think it can distinguigh between the two. Again, I&#39;m not<br/>\nsure (feels like I&#39;m shooting holes in my own idea...heh).<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, you CAN run programs behind EQ, AND I haven&#39;t figured out to see<br/>\nthem without exiting EQ. Ever hit your Windows key and hear your start bar<br/>\nin the background pop up? I shut down my PC on accident about 12 or 13 times<br/>\nbefore I finally pulled the 102-104 keys off my damn keyboard. I&#39;ve also<br/>\nexiting EQ and found 10 Explorer Windows up cuz I hit that damn Start key<br/>\nand DIDN&#39;T shit down, just started up a bunch of other stuff. I just don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how to GET to it without shutting down.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas people? <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Omeg Felligan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:omeg_felligan@...\">omeg_felligan@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 23, 1999 1:47 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQCheats] possible big cheat for EQ....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Omeg Felligan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:omeg_felligan@...\">omeg_felligan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure about the program thing (to minimise), and I haven&#39;t tried the <br/>\n2 monitors...I may be able to but I doubt it (I don&#39;t think any of my <br/>\nfriends would loan me a moniter for a game).  Do you need a 2nd graphics <br/>\ncard for a 2nd moniter?  I&#39;m guessing you would need one in which case I <br/>\ncan&#39;t do it anyway b/c I have no open slots and my current card is bult into<br/>\n<br/>\nthe motherboard (darn Compaq).<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout that program...what does Alt-Tab do?  wouldn&#39;t it be just about the <br/>\nsame as a program sending the EQ window a command to minimise?  in that case<br/>\n<br/>\nthe result would be the same (logging out, computer locking up mostly, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n  But it might be different.<br/>\n<br/>\nanyone have ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nOmeg<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
