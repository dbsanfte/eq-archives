At the bottom of the first<br/>\nramp, you come to a door, a tunnel going left, and a tunnel going right.  Go<br/>\nright at the bottom.  Follow left wall around, past the water, into the nest<br/>\nroom.. there&#39;s a spot on the wall.. either green or purple.. can&#39;t remember<br/>\noff hand.  Anyway.. the Knight spawns there, but be warned, it&#39;s a VERY RARE<br/>\nspawn.. I&#39;ve been there waiting for 4 hrs and didn&#39;t see him..  Others say<br/>\nit&#39;s random, sometimes they can spawn back to back within a half hour..<br/>\nsometimes it takes up to 6 hours or so.  He always has the sword though.<br/>\n\t\tAs far as blackened pieces go, elite guards and up will drop<br/>\nthem..<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tGood luck,<br/>\n\t\tNeedun Luve,<br/>\n\t\tRogue of the Rathe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\t\t\tSent:\tFriday, July 16, 1999 9:26 AM<br/>\n\t\t\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\t\t\tSubject:\t[EQCheats] Blackened Iron<br/>\nBastard Sword?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tHiya all!<br/>\n\t\t\t\tI&#39;m lookin for some info (*spoil* me,<br/>\nPLEASE!) on the BIBS.  I know its in<br/>\n\t\t\t\tRunneyeye, but was looking for more<br/>\nspecifics on the location, the MOB that<br/>\n\t\t\t\tcarries it, group lvl needed to get to /<br/>\nobtain the sword, etc, etc.  I<br/>\n\t\t\t\thaven&#39;t spent much time in Runneyeye...is it<br/>\na good mid-level dungeon?  it<br/>\n\t\t\t\tdoesn&#39;t seem very crowded..which would be a<br/>\nNICE change after spending the<br/>\n\t\t\t\tlast week in Unrest!<br/>\n\t\t\t\tAlso, for those of you wise in the way of<br/>\nRunneyeye...what MOBs drop the<br/>\n\t\t\t\tBlackened Iron armor pieces?  I know the AC<br/>\nisn&#39;t great, and it weighs a<br/>\n\t\t\t\tlot, but it looks very cool and I bet there<br/>\nis a market out there for that<br/>\n\t\t\t\t&#39;look&#39;.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tThanks in advance for your help!!<br/>\n\t\t\t\tThoradin of Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tThe Best Place to Buy Movies - Reel.com<br/>\n\t\t\t\t&lt;a href=&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFor more information on how to join the best<br/>\nroleplaying game on the net goto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
