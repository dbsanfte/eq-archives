Could i hire a few lvl 50s to<br/>\n&gt;kill the mermaid and loot the hair and the gorillas in cazic and loot the<br/>\n&gt;hair. then if Freeport they could hand those to Fuzzlecutter, then i hand<br/>\n&gt;him the wig...any opinions on wether it would work or not?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Trevalien<br/>\n&gt;Dieing for a Rain Caller Bow!! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
