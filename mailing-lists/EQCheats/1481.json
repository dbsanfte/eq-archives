Now that I think about it, I like that alot. You<br/>\nknow what would be better, is something like the Gem off that gnoll in Split<br/>\nPaw, plus some feathers. People could still get around this, by having a<br/>\nhigh level kill the mob and a low level get the loot... *sigh* Just like<br/>\ncrafted stuff now... Better though.<br/>\n<br/>\nOR, make the item needed drop like the Box of Abukar....off any mob of<br/>\nsufficient level but rare as hell...heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nCourse, I&#39;m a shaman, so I can say to make it as hard as ye want, I don&#39;t<br/>\ncare ;-) SoW is a fast cast and uses about 1/100th of my mana now, I hardly<br/>\nmind casting it. Anyone that walks up to me and hails me anymore gets it<br/>\nbefore they ask... *chuckle*<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jones, Brian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brian.Jones@...\">Brian.Jones@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: October 11, 1999 7:05 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQCheats] JBoots, Rubi & Beyond<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brian.Jones@...\">Brian.Jones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes but the ice comment quest should be difficult as it is for high level<br/>\nwizards (minus of the bugs of course, that isn&#39;t good).  If they make the<br/>\nrubi quests like they did the crafted armor quest I think it will work out<br/>\nwell.  Make it necessary for high priced gems and a fairly accessible<br/>\ndropped item from multiple mobs and it will go well.  The jboots should<br/>\nrequire a few rubies and maybe the feathers of a griffon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tEvgeny Ivanov[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evgeny@...\">evgeny@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tMonday, October 11, 1999 6:58 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [EQCheats] JBoots, Rubi & Beyond<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Evgeny Ivanov &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evgeny@...\">evgeny@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Keep reading the news, though.  Instead of being dropped by a mob it is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going to be through a class specific quest (details not known yet).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hopefully they will make it so that only that class can do it and change<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warrior crafted quest where only warriors can do it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am sure they will make that quests extremely buggy and insane difficult<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; complete as all later introducing quests. For example, quest for Ice Comet<br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt; buggy from beggining for several weeks, casters research quests was made<br/>\n&gt; in such<br/>\n&gt; manner so its more easy to train research in traditional way, quests for<br/>\n&gt; Necro&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; high level pet words are so hards so it is much more easy to find the<br/>\n&gt; proper<br/>\n&gt; words from regular high level mobs. Sure, it will be nightmare at Drelzna<br/>\n&gt; room<br/>\n&gt; in next 2 days :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Evgeny<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get paid to surf the web!
