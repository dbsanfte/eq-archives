The game?  Cheats list?  Ring a frickin bell?!!! STOP POSTING<br/>\n&gt; BULLCRAP!!!!  IS ANYBODY MONITORING THIS?  KICK THESE IDIOTS OFF!  I DON&#39;T<br/>\n&gt; NEED 50 EMAILS ABOUT NOTHING!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok sorry had to get it of my cheast and just to show I am not a talking<br/>\nout<br/>\n&gt; my arse - here is a bug which if you should want you may exploit (a cheat<br/>\n&gt; for those of you unfamiliar with the concept.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At the Entrance to Nanjena you can pull a Rock Dervish.  If you get a good<br/>\n&gt; lead and run around the corner almost zoning into nanjena you can still<br/>\ncast<br/>\n&gt; at the Dervish.  The mob for some reason climbs the side of the zone and<br/>\n&gt; never goes into the tunnel to Nanjena.  You can then kill the mob without<br/>\n&gt; getting hit yourself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The same thing with cyclops in Mt Rathe.  You can pull them.  Just to the<br/>\n&gt; North of the entrance from Lk Rathe is a mountain range.  If you root or<br/>\n&gt; snare the cy to slow his movement you can run around the mountain range<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; cast on him from the other side.  The cyclops tries to get to you but<br/>\n&gt; instead goes way up into the air and never touches you.  Flying Cy is<br/>\npretty<br/>\n&gt; funny too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anybody else found spots like these?  And again the list is about EQ.
