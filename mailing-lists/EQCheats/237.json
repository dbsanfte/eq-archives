First off the Fiery Avenger is two handed and Paladin&#39;s wield one handed swords. Orginally it was supposed to be Paladin only but in beta Paladin&#39;s moved frorm using two handed swords as their holy swords to one handed. Also Shadow Knights big weapon is the Dark Reaver 20 dmg 42 dly and casts some spell. The warriors big weapon is the Executioner&#39;s Axe 25dmg 50dly both the Dark Reaver and Axe are in Lower Guk.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
