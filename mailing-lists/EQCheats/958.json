Well met all you fellow EQ &quot;Cheaters.&quot; he he! Well... I&#39;m fairly <br/>\nnew to the list and wanted to change things up a bit and touch on 2 new <br/>\nsubjects...<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Where in the world can you find a BAG OF TINKERER? I&#39;ve only read about <br/>\nthis item and never seen one in game. I understand that it&#39;s 10-Slots and <br/>\neverything placed inside is WEIGHTLESS!!! Wow! Is this bought from a hidden <br/>\nNPC? Looted from a MOB? Who knows? Anyone with any information on this care <br/>\nto share?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I am also interested in MAXIMUM POWER GAMING! Oh no... let the RP&#39;ers <br/>\nflame begin. he he! What I mean is this... Can someone direct me to a web <br/>\nsite or provide our fine list of &quot;cheaters&quot; some SOLID information on what <br/>\nMOBS provide the BEST xp at what level(s). Surely this information must be <br/>\nout there somewhere... Or better yet, let&#39;s start a list and share our own <br/>\nexperiences on what we have found individually that gives GREAT xp at <br/>\ncertain levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my contribution on the Fastest XP/Level discussion... I just recently <br/>\nstarted a Wizard and I was AMAZED how fast my XP rose while fighting GIANT <br/>\nBATS in BBlock Mountains at level 8-9. The bats don&#39;t SWARM to protect each <br/>\nother and there are always plenty to be found at night in the area around <br/>\nthe crossroads.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else? I assume that I can speak for all of us when I say &quot;All <br/>\nlevels/zones/MOBS would be GREATLY appreciated! Let&#39;s gain some XP thru our <br/>\ngroup! BTW... I tend to SOLO a lot due to &quot;multitasking&quot; at home during the <br/>\nnight. You know... family stuff. he he! The tip on the Giant Bats was a SOLO <br/>\ntip.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil next time... great &quot;CHEATING&quot; (errr... sharing knowlege) and best of <br/>\nluck in NORRATH!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Stogie</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
