They con red to level 23&#39;s and I was <br/>\nfighting them in a group of 19-23. They flood the South Ro zone line and <br/>\neven with 4-5 parties, thier are PLENTY to go around. The only drawback is <br/>\nthat they have no loot. That is why I think Verant will let is slide. They <br/>\nare like the crocs for levels 19-25 I figure and they help pull some of the <br/>\nload off the loot zones. Why anyone would complain about them is beyond me. <br/>\nIts not like they are one hit kills, they do have alot of HP&#39;s and a foolish <br/>\nparty can fall to them easily, they do group up when they see their own <br/>\nbeing attacked. I think alot of attention hasn&#39;t been put towards them <br/>\nbecuase most people near or at 20 run straight to unrest on the other side <br/>\nof the world. Well, Anyway check it out and grap whatever exp you can, if <br/>\nthe idiots of the game keeo public posting complaints i am sure they will <br/>\ndisapear as quickly as the appeared.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdol, Lush o&#39; The First Degree, Drun&#39;ken Nation<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQCheats] Gob Pets in Oasis?<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 5 Aug 1999 11:12:58 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just saw a post on one of the Stratics boards concerning an over-run of<br/>\n&gt;Aqua Goblin Pets in Oasis....apparently the wolves are all over the place<br/>\n&gt;for the last few days and giving very easy EXP.<br/>\n&gt;Anybody have any info on this to share???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist now brings ICQ Instant Messaging to members<br/>\n&gt;For details,<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net <br/>\n&gt;goto www.everquest.com </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
