The RP aspects of this game are<br/>\nabout 1/10th of UO&#39;s even though that game was riddled<br/>\nwith Player Killers, bugs and exploits. I enjoy the<br/>\ngame, but I feel after playing similar game types that<br/>\nthis game corrals you more into the powergamer role. <br/>\n<br/>\nI get into the mindset that I can play this game for a<br/>\nfew hours and be about the same as I started or I can<br/>\nplay something like Heroes of Might and Magic III and<br/>\ngo through a few scenarios. <br/>\n<br/>\nI will more likely plan to leave due to slow leveling<br/>\nthan I would if I would see constant improvements in<br/>\nmy character. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven level 50s still have to go in two full groups to<br/>\ntake on the tougher stuff like the dragons. <br/>\n<br/>\nBelgarth Wolfstrider <br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seekerslady@...\">seekerslady@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seekerslady@...\">seekerslady@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I used to play meridian 59. I loved this game but<br/>\n&gt; people got burned out on<br/>\n&gt; it becuase you could build too fast and then got<br/>\n&gt; bored. Then people went<br/>\n&gt; around and PKed each other. It turned a wonderful<br/>\n&gt; online community into a<br/>\n&gt; garbage dump. What is your great hurry? You planning<br/>\n&gt; on leaving soon? As<br/>\n&gt; long as you are having fun and meeting new people<br/>\n&gt; and playing a game you<br/>\n&gt; like what difference does it make what level you are<br/>\n&gt; or how fast you get<br/>\n&gt; there. These games are ment to be played for years<br/>\n&gt; not weeks. I am<br/>\n&gt; surprised that people have already been able to max<br/>\n&gt; out. Now what do they<br/>\n&gt; have to do? Ok they can go anywhere and kill almost<br/>\n&gt; anything but how long<br/>\n&gt; before they get bored and move on? The game has only<br/>\n&gt; been out a few months.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just my 2 cents<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Feather Dreamwalker of Rathe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I agree that level gaining is quite slow. 8-10<br/>\n&gt; hours<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for a level is a bit much. I can&#39;t imagine the high<br/>\n&gt; &gt;30s and above. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Belgarth </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
