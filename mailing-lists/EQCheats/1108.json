I&#39;m still amazed that <br/>\nthere aren&#39;t any.  Congrats to whoever is doing security there they deserve <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there are ppl that want big cheats.  There are ppl that want a new <br/>\nchallange, a new hard game to make a cheat program for.  There are ppl that <br/>\nhave ideas on how to do stuff.  You get a list like this one the topic is <br/>\ncheats, a lot of us have a decient amount of computer, networking, hacking, <br/>\nencryption experance of course you&#39;re going to have ideas on how to get <br/>\naround EQ security if someone brings it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, this may make EQ trainerable, but it may not.  I&#39;m sure anything <br/>\ncurrent will change by the expansion that&#39;s due out this christmas (or <br/>\nafter, can&#39;t remember).<br/>\n<br/>\nOmeg who isn&#39;t sure if he wants anything to come of it or not anymore...oh <br/>\nwell, it&#39;s fun to brainstorm stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;That&#39;s way cool and highly feasible. Haven&#39;t tried it myself, although you <br/>\n&gt;may have just opened up the possibility of a very big &gt;cheat - a &quot;trainer&quot; <br/>\n&gt;utility that uses this idea. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
