Besides the fact that he actually told the<br/>\nentire world about it as well. Lemac&#39;s email details actually what his lawyer should<br/>\nhave told him to the first place. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think all this sean guy has to do to win the case now is just walk in to court with<br/>\nprintouts of this thread. Might even be evidence for a counter suit. (Mental anguish<br/>\nand  lost wages seems to be a popluar cry for money) It would be interesting (once<br/>\nagain if we cared) to find out how that would turn out if it actually ever happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kazen, Marc&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Kazen, Marc&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Marc.Kazen@...\">Marc.Kazen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How can he charge a proof-reading fee if he never read it?<br/>\n&gt; Marc Kazen<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Subject:        Re: [EQCheats] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;From: Steven Cobb &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cobb@...\">cobb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Lemme get this straight, someone was sending him email that<br/>\n&gt; he didn&#39;t want (spam?)<br/>\n&gt;and in an effort to stop it told the guy that he would<br/>\n&gt; charge him a fee for reading<br/>\n&gt;his email. THEN doesn&#39;t read the email that was sent to him<br/>\n&gt; and is planning on going<br/>\n&gt;to small claims court to get the fee?

He sent me an email this morning<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that was lengthy and I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; didn&#39;t even bother reading it.  Again (to the people of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the list), do not send me<br/>\n&gt;&gt; private emails.  Mr. Clark is going to have to go to small<br/>\n&gt;&gt; claims court because of his actions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
