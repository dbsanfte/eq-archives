Shadowstep, gate,<br/>\nfalling, SoW with the bard song (Now stacks) couple of other things.  Also,<br/>\nI accidentally did a preliminary test on this last night.  I was *DEEP* in<br/>\nSol B, deeper then I&#39;d want to go without SoW on, and I pinged a Greater<br/>\nKobold Shaman with an arrow.  *JUST* as he turned around but before he hit<br/>\nme for the first time, there was a net burp.  Not noticing this I ran all<br/>\nthe way to<br/>\nthe spot where we pull to, to see no one there (During net burps people<br/>\ndissappear as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen.)  a moment later, the connection came<br/>\nback.  I was where I saw myself, full life, and about 20 seconds later the<br/>\nShaman came into view.  Basically this means that:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) While I wasn&#39;t there he didn&#39;t engage in combat.<br/>\n2) He didn&#39;t move to follow until after the server knew where I was.<br/>\n3) I saved about 400 hitpoints of damage that I usually take during that<br/>\nrun.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s not too much of a hassle I&#39;m going to rewire my Hubs this afternoon<br/>\nto put the one connection I play EQ from on the desktop to see if I can<br/>\nrepeativly do this.  I&#39;d give it a 50/50 chance, the connection burp was<br/>\nnear the server side and *MAY* have been server side lag.  (Everyone in the<br/>\nzone had the same burp at the same time.)  Either way though it was a good<br/>\nif accidental proof of concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dwarren@...\">dwarren@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dwarren@...\">dwarren@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 18, 1999 9:37 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQCheats] possible big cheat for EQ....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dwarren@...\">dwarren@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Wed, 18 Aug 1999, Joao Assad wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As a programmer, I know the hazards associated with  third party<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Programs fudging your data.

You<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; FEED commands to Verant, the actions are resolved on the server,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the RESULTS are sent back to you. You may modify the commands<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sent, or the results on your screen, and it won&#39;t change what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happens to your character on verants servers at all. It is a great<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way to preclude tampering. You may change your screen to show<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 50000pp, but try to buy something.... The next screen update will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; show your real totals... Your character and all interaction with it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are done BY Verant on their own servers. You have NO real contact with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anything that must be modified for any kind of cheat to work.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; aye, the best you could do would be... stop/start the rain... change<br/>\nnight<br/>\n&gt; / day....<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and stuff like that. but no permanent changes in your character at all.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just maybe you could get rid of root, blind and spells like that ...<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; intercept the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; server feed using some program to tunnel it and remove/add commands from<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feed , the server would think you are rooted but since your EQ client<br/>\n&gt; didnt recieve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the command to root you it would let you move freely.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually, there is one important thing that is handled completely on the<br/>\n&gt; client side.  That is, where you are in the world.  (Proof, sit in a spot,<br/>\n&gt; unplug your ethernet cable from the back of your PC, run 1000 spaces,<br/>\n&gt; plug it back in, see that you&#39;re still there and not at the other place.)<br/>\n&gt; So it should be possible to modify the X/Y/Z location in the client and<br/>\n&gt; have that information passed on to the server...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Uses:<br/>\n&gt; 1 key to the zone line.<br/>\n&gt; bypass guards and jump right to the rare spawn and then jump right out<br/>\n&gt; again.<br/>\n&gt; PVP combat, randomly move 25 in each x/y direction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; For details, including our weekly drawing, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\n&gt; goto www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist now brings ICQ Instant Messaging to members<br/>\n&gt; For details,<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
