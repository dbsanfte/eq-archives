Where do I get the items to complete this Quest, details on where and what holds them, *mobs,<br/>\nvendors, places etc.<br/>\n4. What are the stats on the Crafted items, i.e Can us lovely SHAMANS wear it<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll details can be sent to me, money is almost no option, but I don&#39;t want BS prices if you don&#39;t<br/>\nknow don&#39;t respond. I&#39;m the Grand Master of my guild and I would like to start gathering verified<br/>\ninformation, that i can pass onto my guildmates as *Fact*.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your time<br/>\n<br/>\nThulgar<br/>\nGrand Master of the Mystical Knights<br/>\nhtttp://www.efni.com/~thulgar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
