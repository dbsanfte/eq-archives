What, then, do we do with trade skills that have no benefit to pc&#39;s? 2 very good examples would be brewing and pottery. Brewing was nerfed about 2 weeks ago, and now pottery. Both trade skills used to be profitable selling to npc&#39;s, but they both served NO purpose to other players. Now that you can&#39;t make money on either trade skill, I&#39;m hoping people will boycott the skills, /feedback to Verant, anything they can to make these skills useful. They either need to make it profitable again, or make the products of the skills useful to other players. If other players actually wanted to buy brews and pottery things, they would be profitable, and it would fit Verant&#39;s wish that you can&#39;t make money selling to npc&#39;s. But until then brewing and pottery are the biggest waste of time in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n Tanthalias<br/>\n Half Elven Bard<br/>\n Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginal Message:<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 6<br/>\n   Date: Sun, 25 Jul 1999 13:27:38 -0700<br/>\n   From: Aaron Braunstein &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_spam@...\">aaron_spam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Pottery<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;robert nunez&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:homenunez@...\">homenunez@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Man r u serious?<br/>\n&gt;   Why are they doing this thing?Do they not realize that we take on these<br/>\n&gt;skills which not only take s a ton away from time away from hunting but now<br/>\n&gt;these skills are just a complete waste of time<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the point... kind of.  Verant has always said from the <br/>\nbeginning that they do not want trade skills to be profitable when <br/>\nyou sell your wares back  to the NPC vendors.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
