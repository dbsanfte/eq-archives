Fact<br/>\nis that Necros (and enchanters too believe it or not) own in PvP at<br/>\nhigher levels (low levels too for necros).  I admit it too..  Paladins<br/>\nsuck at higher lvls.  No where near the tanks that monks or warriors<br/>\nare.  No where near the healers that clerics are.  The fiery avenger<br/>\nkinda brings them back up to standard.
