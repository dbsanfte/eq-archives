As a matter of fact up until several months ago, you could<br/>\npurchase in-game items on ebay all the time,  I myself have never subscribe<br/>\nto this type of method of gaining the items I want or need, however it<br/>\nsimple as and effective, and has been very lucrative in the past for<br/>\nhardcore players, no scams just a bunch of game addicts who will do anything<br/>\nto get ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Chuck [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lancilot2000@...\">lancilot2000@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, October 13, 2001 1:04 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@yahoogroups.com\">EQCheats@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQCheats] Digest Number 211<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone even thinks about sending this guy 250 real dollars for<br/>\nthis stuff, then maybe you should be admitted. And the guy actually<br/>\nposting this post, you must have rocks in your head to expect that<br/>\nkind of money for some inanimate items in some game. Get real<br/>\npal, how about I just send you my paycheck every week, NOT.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, don&#39;t be stupid people and fall for scams like this, which is<br/>\nall they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. This is not a cheat, it is a scam and does not belong here.  Maybe<br/>\nyou can&#39;t accept paypal cause you screwed too many people out of<br/>\ntheir hard earned money and they kicked you off their service.  Or could<br/>\nbe that it is almost impossible to get money back from someone if you<br/>\npay them by money order.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 1<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Fri, 12 Oct 2001 08:47:12 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqdealer@...\">eqdealer@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Hot Items!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Heya!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Im dont have that much time to play EQ anymore..<br/>\n&gt;to much work at the moment so im selling the last items i have...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The items are..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cloak of Flames, golden efreeti Bots & 10 000 PP<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The price is 250 Dollars for Everything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Western Union Money order is prefered as Payment option.<br/>\n&gt;I cant accept paypal at the moment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Intressted?!?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;send me an email to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqdealer@...\">eqdealer@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hope to hear from ya soon...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Jimmy bergman<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
