It increases STR, while severely lowering INT. Its only good<br/>\nfor warriors. It pretty much makes magic casting impossible, so its no good<br/>\nfor bards, clerics, paladins, et al. If they made alcohol tolerance a viable<br/>\nskill, or make brews good for something else, and they severely increased<br/>\nnpc prices for brews, brewing would once again be a viable trade skill.<br/>\n <br/>\n Tanthalias<br/>\n Half Elven Bard<br/>\n Ex-Master Brewers<br/>\n Tarew Marr<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nOriginal Message:<br/>\n <br/>\nMessage: 3<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 28 Jul 1999 08:08:26 -0700<br/>\n   From: &quot;Lemac Justerian&quot; &lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a><br/>\n&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>&gt; &gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Trade Skill in General<br/>\n<br/>\nTanthalias,<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought that drinking brew DID give you a boost in Strength!  (while<br/>\nlowering your INT I believe)... So it does kind of &#39;buff&#39; you up... and that<br/>\nis a good reason for the Warriors and fighters to build up an alcohol<br/>\ntollerance...<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, pie tins are needed for some quest, but they can already be purchased<br/>\npretty cheaply from NPC&#39;s...<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that most of those skills are useless, and blacksmithing is quickly<br/>\nbecoming usless as well because of the amount of Bronze Armor (as well as<br/>\nall the banded that has already been made) that Verant has put into the<br/>\ngame... It used to be infrequently dropped in Unrest and Permafrost, but now<br/>\nit is there all the time... So again, they (possibly unknowingly?) have made<br/>\nsmithing a tougher skill to obtain...<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\nProud member of Platinum Sphere Guild - www.platinumsphere.com<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.platinumsphere.com\">http://www.platinumsphere.com</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
