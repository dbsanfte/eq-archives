The other 5<br/>\n people all got charmed in our group...  they started attacking while I<br/>\nwas<br/>\n AFK, so I got there halfway through the battle.  I unloaded all my manna<br/>\nat<br/>\n the eye and successfully killed it.  I got an experience message, but<br/>\nnobody<br/>\n else in the group did.  My current theory is that once you are charmed,<br/>\nyou<br/>\n count as a monster, and won&#39;t get the experience message for any group<br/>\nkills<br/>\n during that time.  Unfortunately, this is also hard to test.<br/>\nUnfortunately<br/>\n that mishap resulted in the death of more than half our party... but when<br/>\nI<br/>\n looked at my XP-o-meter, I got a huge chunk of XP from the fight (if my<br/>\n theory is correct, I got all of the XP)<br/>\n <br/>\n -Kzak<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\n When fighting evil eyes in the gorge the other night, I hit the sit<br/>\nbutton<br/>\n while charmed somehow. The result was canceling the charm, which allowed<br/>\nme<br/>\n to continue with my battle. I managed to do this repeatedly throughout<br/>\nthe<br/>\n night. This could be a coincidence or an actual bug in the game, I&#39;m not<br/>\n sure.
