Well met all you fellow EQ &quot;Cheaters.&quot; he he! Well... I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; fairly <br/>\n&gt; new to the list and wanted to change things up a bit and touch on 2 new <br/>\n&gt; subjects...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Where in the world can you find a BAG OF TINKERER? I&#39;ve only read about<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; this item and never seen one in game. I understand that it&#39;s 10-Slots and <br/>\n&gt; everything placed inside is WEIGHTLESS!!! Wow! Is this bought from a<br/>\n&gt; hidden <br/>\n&gt; NPC? Looted from a MOB? Who knows? Anyone with any information on this<br/>\n&gt; care <br/>\n&gt; to share?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2) I am also interested in MAXIMUM POWER GAMING! Oh no... let the RP&#39;ers <br/>\n&gt; flame begin. he he! What I mean is this... Can someone direct me to a web <br/>\n&gt; site or provide our fine list of &quot;cheaters&quot; some SOLID information on what<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; MOBS provide the BEST xp at what level(s). Surely this information must be<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; out there somewhere... Or better yet, let&#39;s start a list and share our own<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; experiences on what we have found individually that gives GREAT xp at <br/>\n&gt; certain levels.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s my contribution on the Fastest XP/Level discussion... I just<br/>\n&gt; recently <br/>\n&gt; started a Wizard and I was AMAZED how fast my XP rose while fighting GIANT<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BATS in BBlock Mountains at level 8-9. The bats don&#39;t SWARM to protect<br/>\n&gt; each <br/>\n&gt; other and there are always plenty to be found at night in the area around <br/>\n&gt; the crossroads.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone else? I assume that I can speak for all of us when I say &quot;All <br/>\n&gt; levels/zones/MOBS would be GREATLY appreciated! Let&#39;s gain some XP thru<br/>\n&gt; our <br/>\n&gt; group! BTW... I tend to SOLO a lot due to &quot;multitasking&quot; at home during<br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; night. You know... family stuff. he he! The tip on the Giant Bats was a<br/>\n&gt; SOLO <br/>\n&gt; tip.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Until next time... great &quot;CHEATING&quot; (errr... sharing knowlege) and best of<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; luck in NORRATH!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Stogie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist now has T-SHIRTS!<br/>\n&gt; For details and to order, go to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html\">http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\n&gt; goto www.everquest.com </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
