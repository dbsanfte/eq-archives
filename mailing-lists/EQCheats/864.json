I was an<br/>\n\t\tArchon in<br/>\n\t\t\t\tCazic-Thule and while they were having a<br/>\npicnic in the lower<br/>\n\t\tthrone room I<br/>\n\t\t\t\tpopped a justicar, herald, and a champion to<br/>\nliven things up<br/>\n\t\tfor the<br/>\n\t\t\t\tWinnebago crowd.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: If you are killed by a GM/possessed<br/>\nNPC, you do NOT<br/>\n\t\tlose exp!<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tThe zone freaked, had no idea what to do.<br/>\nSome mid to high<br/>\n\t\t40s showed up<br/>\n\t\t\t\tand tried to take me out (they were a<br/>\nlittle, um,<br/>\n\t\tfoolhardy), doing shouts<br/>\n\t\t\t\tof &quot;I&#39;ll defeat him!&quot;, then -- get this --<br/>\nsending in their<br/>\n\t\tpets ONE AT A<br/>\n\t\t\t\tTIME.  There was a 50th necro and a 48th<br/>\nmagician there, and<br/>\n\t\ttheir pets are<br/>\n\t\t\t\tMEAN.  But they sent them in one at a time<br/>\n-- easy for me to<br/>\n\t\tdeal with (I<br/>\n\t\t\t\twas a 50th wizzie).  If both pets had come<br/>\nin, I would have<br/>\n\t\tbeen toast.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tStupid stupid stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tSome of them stormed in, expecting me to be<br/>\nabout 35th<br/>\n\t\tlevel, and I nuked<br/>\n\t\t\t\tthem instantly.  So they started whining<br/>\nabout it being<br/>\n\t\t&quot;unfair&quot;.  Someone<br/>\n\t\t\t\telse in the zone started OOCing how this was<br/>\n&quot;ruining&quot; their<br/>\n\t\tevening because<br/>\n\t\t\t\tall they wanted to do was get some rubicite<br/>\nand log.<br/>\n\t\tHearing things like<br/>\n\t\t\t\tthat makes me almost want to give up on the<br/>\ngame (or its<br/>\n\t\tplayers).<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tAnyway, instead of getting organized, they<br/>\nhid in the<br/>\n\t\tcourtyard.  Now, at<br/>\n\t\t\t\tthis point I had only a small contingent of<br/>\nbodyguards, but<br/>\n\t\tmore important,<br/>\n\t\t\t\tI only had THREE spells memorized -- Ice<br/>\nComet, Conflag, and<br/>\n\t\tFrost Shock.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tNone of those can be cast very quickly.  Two<br/>\ngood tanks, two<br/>\n\t\tclerics, and<br/>\n\t\t\t\tone wizzie could have killed me EASILY, but<br/>\nthey refused to<br/>\n\t\tcome after me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tAs I was getting bored sitting with my<br/>\ngorillas in the<br/>\n\t\tthrone room, I walked<br/>\n\t\t\t\tout into the courtyard -- ALONE -- and<br/>\nproceeded to cast,<br/>\n\t\tkilling a few<br/>\n\t\t\t\tfolks.  Now here&#39;s the even sadder part -- I<br/>\nwalked out,<br/>\n\t\talone, into a room<br/>\n\t\t\t\tof about 20 players from 20th to 50th level,<br/>\nAND NO ONE<br/>\n\t\tBOTHERED ROOTING OR<br/>\n\t\t\t\tSTUNNING ME.  They tried to kill me, but<br/>\ninstead of taking<br/>\n\t\taway my ability<br/>\n\t\t\t\tto run or cast, they just tried to kill me<br/>\nquick.  Then,<br/>\n\t\teven stupider, two<br/>\n\t\t\t\tof the casters chased me into the<br/>\nmaze...alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tDumb dumb dumb.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tSo I ran back to lick my wounds and hid in<br/>\nthe throne room,<br/>\n\t\tbut they<br/>\n\t\t\t\twouldn&#39;t give chase.  I finally decided that<br/>\nit was time for<br/>\n\t\tme to die, so I<br/>\n\t\t\t\tran to the zone border to kill people<br/>\nlooting their corpses<br/>\n\t\t(*evil grin*),<br/>\n\t\t\t\tand finally I got dropped by a nice crowd.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tOkay, so here&#39;s the loot I dropped: full set<br/>\nof rubicite and<br/>\n\t\ta shimmering<br/>\n\t\t\t\tsilk robe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tAnd here&#39;s the point where I get miffed: if<br/>\na GM is killed<br/>\n\t\tin an event,<br/>\n\t\t\t\t&quot;ninja looting&quot; can happen since ANYONE can<br/>\nloot the corpse,<br/>\n\t\tnot the<br/>\n\t\t\t\tperson/party responsible for most damage.  A<br/>\n50th wizard<br/>\n\t\tlooted my corpse<br/>\n\t\t\t\tand got ALL the rubi, then said he didn&#39;t<br/>\nfind anything.  In<br/>\n\t\taddition, he<br/>\n\t\t\t\tdidn&#39;t distribute it to anyone else that was<br/>\nin the battle<br/>\n\t\t-- he kept it for<br/>\n\t\t\t\this guild (presumably).<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tThis really upset me, but because of a error<br/>\non my part the<br/>\n\t\ttwo rubi bracers<br/>\n\t\t\t\tthat were dropped were in a backpack and<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t be looted<br/>\n\t\t(except by me).<br/>\n\t\t\t\tI then looted my corpse and awarded the<br/>\nbracers to a 42nd<br/>\n\t\tlevel wizzie that<br/>\n\t\t\t\tplayed smart, fierce, and was RP the whole<br/>\nway.  I&#39;m still<br/>\n\t\tupset that the<br/>\n\t\t\t\t50th wizzie didn&#39;t share the loot with the<br/>\ntanks that were<br/>\n\t\tthere.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tAt one point a 32nd level SK said something<br/>\nlike &quot;Hey<br/>\n\t\tlizzie, I&#39;m wearing<br/>\n\t\t\t\tyour brother as a cloak!&quot; so I teleported to<br/>\nhim and said<br/>\n\t\t&quot;HSSSS!  THEN YOU<br/>\n\t\t\t\tDIE!&quot;  He was with a party of 30s camping<br/>\nnear the Avatar<br/>\n\t\troom.  He RAN as<br/>\n\t\t\t\tfast as he could, but his party put up a<br/>\nREAL good fight.  I<br/>\n\t\tmean GOOD.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tThey could have taken me down...almost.  I<br/>\npopped an Archon<br/>\n\t\tthat wasted most<br/>\n\t\t\t\tof them, but they nearly killed me.  But<br/>\nthat party was<br/>\n\t\tsmart, organized,<br/>\n\t\t\t\tand BRAVE. I wish I had caught their names<br/>\nbecause I would<br/>\n\t\thave rewarded<br/>\n\t\t\t\tthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tThat party of low 30s had more guts and<br/>\nsmarts than a whole<br/>\n\t\tzone of 40s.<br/>\n\t\t\t\t*sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tIn a way I think a lot of high level players<br/>\nhave become<br/>\n\t\tused to how things<br/>\n\t\t\t\twork, and once things stop working that way,<br/>\nthey get really<br/>\n\t\tconfused and<br/>\n\t\t\t\tdon&#39;t know what to do.  I think a PvP player<br/>\nwould have done<br/>\n\t\ta LOT better.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tWhen I did the event on Cazic-Thule a 32nd<br/>\nlevel paladin<br/>\n\t\t(wearing bronze)<br/>\n\t\t\t\tlooted me, but since I had an ebony blade on<br/>\nme he gave it<br/>\n\t\tto a ranger that<br/>\n\t\t\t\thad helped, and he also gave away the rubi<br/>\npants to another<br/>\n\t\ttank.  Oh, and<br/>\n\t\t\t\ton Cazic-Thule I buffed myself so that<br/>\nbasically ONLY melee<br/>\n\t\ttypes could kill<br/>\n\t\t\t\tme -- I gave myself insane magic resistance.<br/>\nWhen I went<br/>\n\t\tdown on CT server<br/>\n\t\t\t\tI was taking about 400 points of damage per<br/>\ntick from 12<br/>\n\t\tmelee fighters,<br/>\n\t\t\t\twhich is EXACTLY what I wanted since I was<br/>\ndropping melee<br/>\n\t\tgear.  I was NOT<br/>\n\t\t\t\tgoing to let a wizzie get a full set of rubi<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tDuring another event, when I was the<br/>\nwerewolf in SK,<br/>\n\t\tEVERYONE kept running<br/>\n\t\t\t\tfrom me for the zone.  They kept trying to<br/>\npull me to the<br/>\n\t\tzone so they could<br/>\n\t\t\t\tfight then zone if they were getting hurt.<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t play<br/>\n\t\tthat way, and<br/>\n\t\t\t\tsummoned a cyclops to help keep the zone<br/>\nclear (MWUHAHAHA).<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tDuring the entire SK event, I killed only<br/>\nTWO people.  One<br/>\n\t\tof them was a<br/>\n\t\t\t\t35th level dwarven warrior wearing bronze.<br/>\nHe fought<br/>\n\t\tbravely -- when I got<br/>\n\t\t\t\thim to one bub of health, instead of running<br/>\nhe stood up and<br/>\n\t\twent down<br/>\n\t\t\t\tswinging.  Never cried for help, never tried<br/>\nto run.  And<br/>\n\t\tthere was a crowd<br/>\n\t\t\t\taround that didn&#39;t bother healing him<br/>\neither.  This warrior<br/>\n\t\t-- Aindolmar --<br/>\n\t\t\t\twas an exemplary example of a brave, RPing<br/>\nplayer.  I<br/>\n\t\trewarded him after my<br/>\n\t\t\t\tdeath (I dropped a werewolf cloak and tunic<br/>\nfor those that<br/>\n\t\tcare to know)<br/>\n\t\t\t\tspecifically with a crafted breastplate.  He<br/>\nwas wielding a<br/>\n\t\tBBC (I think)<br/>\n\t\t\t\tand wearing bronze with no other twinks.  He<br/>\nwasn&#39;t in a<br/>\n\t\tguild that I could<br/>\n\t\t\t\ttell, and was playing the game &quot;legit&quot; as it<br/>\nwere.  More<br/>\n\t\timportant, it<br/>\n\t\t\t\tlooked like he was playing in the spirit of<br/>\nthe game, and I<br/>\n\t\trewarded that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFinally, when I was the undead vizier on the<br/>\nchessboard, I<br/>\n\t\twas a 25th level<br/>\n\t\t\t\twizard.  A 15th level dwarven warrior (gotta<br/>\nlove those<br/>\n\t\tdorfs!) named<br/>\n\t\t\t\tThrombrir kept trying to rally everyone to<br/>\nattack me.  A<br/>\n\t\tcouple druids kept<br/>\n\t\t\t\trunning from me -- and they were 24th and<br/>\n37th level<br/>\n\t\trespectively -- and<br/>\n\t\t\t\tplayed like complete weenies.  This warrior<br/>\nran up and<br/>\n\t\tstarted whacking on<br/>\n\t\t\t\tme, ALONE.  No party, no backup, but I was<br/>\nconning BRIGHT<br/>\n\t\tRED to him, but he<br/>\n\t\t\t\tdidn&#39;t care.  Once again, he was not a twink<br/>\n-- he had on<br/>\n\t\tringmail and some<br/>\n\t\t\t\trawhide -- and he was busy RPing like crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tIn that battled I dropped an FBR -- which a<br/>\n42nd level necro<br/>\n\t\tlooted, as if<br/>\n\t\t\t\tshe needed it (and I don&#39;t think she<br/>\nshared).  But I had<br/>\n\t\talready learned not<br/>\n\t\t\t\tto reward people that looted my body -- too<br/>\nmany selfish<br/>\n\t\ttypes.  So now I<br/>\n\t\t\t\tkeep track of players that are brave, smart<br/>\n(if that&#39;s in<br/>\n\t\tcharacter),<br/>\n\t\t\t\tuntwinked, and role-playing, and I reward<br/>\nthem appropriately<br/>\n\t\tafter the<br/>\n\t\t\t\tbattle.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tThrombrir received crafted gauntlets and one<br/>\ncrafted bracer<br/>\n\t\tto replace his<br/>\n\t\t\t\trawhide.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tMy point?  The lower level types played<br/>\nwell, smart, and<br/>\n\t\twere having fun,<br/>\n\t\t\t\tand the higher levels were busy screaming<br/>\nabout things being<br/>\n\t\tunfair, were<br/>\n\t\t\t\tdoing dumb stuff, wouldn&#39;t leave the zone<br/>\nborder, and<br/>\n\t\twouldn&#39;t share loot.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tOh, and when high levels hear about an event<br/>\nvia &quot;guildsay&quot;,<br/>\n\t\tthey all come<br/>\n\t\t\t\tto kill me so they can get the loot.  It&#39;s<br/>\nfrustrating being<br/>\n\t\ta 25th level<br/>\n\t\t\t\tmob and getting taken down by a 50th SK<br/>\ninstead of a crowd<br/>\n\t\tof 20s.  But I<br/>\n\t\t\t\tcan&#39;t pick and choose who comes to kill me,<br/>\nso the best I<br/>\n\t\tcan do is make<br/>\n\t\t\t\tsure that the right people are rewarded.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tAn explanation of my &quot;anti-twinking&quot; policy<br/>\nis probably in<br/>\n\t\torder for those<br/>\n\t\t\t\tof you in a guild or that are twinked:<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t- these events are role playing events.  All<br/>\nthe ones I<br/>\n\t\tdescribed I did<br/>\n\t\t\t\talone without any input from others, in an<br/>\nattempt to spice<br/>\n\t\tup the game for<br/>\n\t\t\t\tsome folks.
