The graphics/sounds are on your computer. They have names like<br/>\n&gt; qeynoshills.xmi, qeynoshills.s3d. It may be posible to remove<br/>\n&gt; fog/rain/darkness/ocean (the fogyness underwater: you could make water<br/>\n&gt; crysatl clear)<br/>\n&gt; B.) There is a file that contains a list of guildnames and a single player<br/>\n&gt; name next to each of them. I assume this is the guild leader beacuse my<br/>\nname<br/>\n&gt; is next to my guild. This file is full of giberish too which makes it hard<br/>\n&gt; to read.<br/>\n&gt; C.) There is a file that contains the names of every other file followed<br/>\nby<br/>\n&gt; 3 small hex values. This may be used to check if files have been modified.<br/>\n&gt; Ex:   qeynoshills.xmi d54sd3f46 54df7sd5g 6s8fs69sf<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are no files containing anything that is recognizable (to me) as<br/>\ninfo<br/>\n&gt; regarding your character. After thinking about it it would not be posible<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; store that kind of info on your computer and still have the ability to<br/>\nsell<br/>\n&gt; your acount (on E-bay)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Trevalien<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Whitcraft,David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DWHITCRAFT@...\">DWHITCRAFT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: RE: [EQCheats] Is the verdict finally in?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 27 Aug 1999 11:23:20 -0500<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Whitcraft,David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DWHITCRAFT@...\">DWHITCRAFT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;If there were a way to hack the files locally and give yourself items,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;alter<br/>\n&gt; &gt;your bank box, or anything important like that, people would have already<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hacked it (and then Verant would have most likely put in something to try<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fix it, so we would have heard about it).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The only thing I see that&#39;s possible to hack would be the graphics files,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;which HAVE to be local. No way they could send that much information over<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the &#39;net, isn&#39;t possible. So, the graphics have to be stored locally. You<br/>\n&gt; &gt;could write something to alter the packets as they come in to filter out<br/>\n&gt; &gt;certain graphics messages (blind, rain, nighttime, spell effects, etc),<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you might be able to hack the graphics files themseleves and just take<br/>\n&gt; &gt;these<br/>\n&gt; &gt;affects out.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;None of these bother me enough to want to wirte anything to filter<br/>\npackets<br/>\n&gt; &gt;though.... *chuckle*<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: kale usi [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Friday, August 27, 1999 11:17 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: RE: [EQCheats] Is the verdict finally in?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;kale usi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Michael O&#39;Reilly &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michael@...\">michael@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I think not. I play EQ a lot from different computers. Things I have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;set up on each new computer are hotkeys, friends list, and ignore list.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;However, my character, equipment, bank balance, faction, current buffs,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and location remain the same.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;That indicates to me that all of the second list are on the server, not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the individual computer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Quite possibly true. I don&#39;t know for sure either way - in my opinion I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;agree with you. However, the main thing I&#39;m wondering at this point is -<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what applications could hacking the files stored client side have? It has<br/>\n&gt; &gt;me<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;on pins and needles. I hope that nothing major comes of this. I&#39;d hate<br/>\nlike<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hell to see my hours of work earning items, cash, etc go down the tubes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Yet<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;on another aspect, I&#39;m intrigued. 8p<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Congratulations GENEVINCENT.
