I&#39;m still amazed that<br/>\n&gt;there aren&#39;t any.  Congrats to whoever is doing security there they deserve<br/>\n&gt;it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But there are ppl that want big cheats.  There are ppl that want a new<br/>\n&gt;challange, a new hard game to make a cheat program for.  There are ppl that<br/>\n&gt;have ideas on how to do stuff.  You get a list like this one the topic is<br/>\n&gt;cheats, a lot of us have a decient amount of computer, networking, hacking,<br/>\n&gt;encryption experance of course you&#39;re going to have ideas on how to get<br/>\n&gt;around EQ security if someone brings it up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yes, this may make EQ trainerable, but it may not.  I&#39;m sure anything<br/>\n&gt;current will change by the expansion that&#39;s due out this christmas (or<br/>\n&gt;after, can&#39;t remember).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Omeg who isn&#39;t sure if he wants anything to come of it or not anymore...oh<br/>\n&gt;well, it&#39;s fun to brainstorm stuff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;That&#39;s way cool and highly feasible. Haven&#39;t tried it myself, although you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;may have just opened up the possibility of a very big &gt;cheat - a &quot;trainer&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;utility that uses this idea.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ATTENTION ONElist MEMBERS!
