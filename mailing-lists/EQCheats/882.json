I read an article which sounds similar to the one you say you read and I believe it was Brad himself that was quoted as saying no anti-camping zones . But","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2105970040\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;From: &quot;IDS&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ids@...\">ids@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I read a Q&A with either Brad McQuaid or John Smedley on EQVault, &gt;probably <br/>\n&gt;Brad. He was asked about anti-camp zones specificaly and he &gt;said that <br/>\n&gt;while they were thinking about it or testing it in beta &gt;they did not <br/>\n&gt;implement any anti-camp code.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;My take on all this is just crappy randomness in the game. Multiple <br/>\n&gt; &gt;fizzles and resists are more common than isolated or alternating &gt;ones, <br/>\n&gt;the best chance to get a rare loot, if you were betting on it, &gt;is on the <br/>\n&gt;very next spawn than some random numbe of spawns.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t camp all that much but so far I&#39;ve seen that if say the mean &gt;item <br/>\n&gt;drop time is 8 hours what really happens is the item might be &gt;dropped 2-3 <br/>\n&gt;times in rapid succession within 4 hours (rapid?) then &gt;nothing for 20-24 <br/>\n&gt;hours. This is for relatively normal item not the &gt;super rare items like <br/>\n&gt;the GBS.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What I have seen:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tae Templar not spawn for 2 day, throne room was being cleared all &gt;the <br/>\n&gt;time. next day my friends got 3 rubi legs in 3 consecutive &gt;spawns.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;AoF spawning infrequently and dropping only 1 tunic in about 12 hours &gt;then <br/>\n&gt;back to back AoF within 20 min and both dropping tunics. During the same <br/>\n&gt;time the Cenobyte spawns pretty regularly for 3 days straight but never a <br/>\n&gt;pair of boots on him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;BUT these and your observations are pure speculation you have to &gt;spend a <br/>\n&gt;statistically significant time observing a spawn and need to &gt;know the <br/>\n&gt;spawn rules for that specific mob that verant has put in to &gt;tell if either <br/>\n&gt;there is anti-camp code (no there isn&#39;t) or if their &gt;random number <br/>\n&gt;generator is flawed (yes it is). I have no desire to do &gt;that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I read an article which sounds similar to the one you say you read and I <br/>\nbelieve it was Brad himself that was quoted as saying &quot;no anti-camping <br/>\nzones&quot;. But that article was released at least a month ago, (maybe longer) <br/>\nand camping has become a major issue since then - hence all the changes <br/>\n(lore items implemented; no drops more common; unbelievably slow/long spawn <br/>\nrates for rares; changing respawn rates).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for my pure speculation, I spent over 2 weeks (hours upon hours) <br/>\ntiming/camping various spawns throughout Befallen to test my theory. I even <br/>\nhad other players helping me out. According to what I found, in certain <br/>\nareas, not all areas mind you, there&#39;s an anti-camping code. If you wish to <br/>\nnot believe, then so be it. But in my experience, they exist. I only wish I <br/>\nhad screenshots of the GM&#39;s and Guides I&#39;ve talked to who said there was to <br/>\nback up what I&#39;m saying. I&#39;d gladly send the screenshots to all who doubt.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
