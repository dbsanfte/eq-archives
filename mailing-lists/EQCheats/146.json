It costs quite a bit (mostly<br/>\n&gt; time) to make both studs and boning (for reinforced), and it&#39;s much harder<br/>\n&gt; to recoupe the money for them then it is for banded (remember those<br/>\n&gt; failures?)  Studs usually have to go for 1p each just to break even (less<br/>\n&gt; for higher level smiths, but they don&#39;t want to waste the time).  So, if<br/>\n&gt; something takes 3 studs and leather, it&#39;s hardly worth it.
