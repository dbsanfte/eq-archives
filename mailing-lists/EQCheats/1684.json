If that is real its a very good deal. With the CoF costing around<br/>\n120K on my server and plat selling at 100 bucks per 10000 plat this item is<br/>\na steal. I say again it may be a scam it may not but ya don&#39;t need to flame<br/>\npeople just cause they might spend real cash on an item. And think how long<br/>\nit would take to earn that or the time needed to raise a level high enough<br/>\nto challenge a dragon and &quot;hope&quot; to win a roll for it. Plus there 10000 plat<br/>\nin the deal too.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents take it as you all like  :)  but if real its a great deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Chuck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lancilot2000@...\">lancilot2000@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@yahoogroups.com\">EQCheats@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, October 13, 2001 4:03 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQCheats] Digest Number 211<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If anyone even thinks about sending this guy 250 real dollars for<br/>\n&gt; this stuff, then maybe you should be admitted. And the guy actually<br/>\n&gt; posting this post, you must have rocks in your head to expect that<br/>\n&gt; kind of money for some inanimate items in some game. Get real<br/>\n&gt; pal, how about I just send you my paycheck every week, NOT.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, don&#39;t be stupid people and fall for scams like this, which is<br/>\n&gt; all they are.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S. This is not a cheat, it is a scam and does not belong here.  Maybe<br/>\n&gt; you can&#39;t accept paypal cause you screwed too many people out of<br/>\n&gt; their hard earned money and they kicked you off their service.  Or could<br/>\n&gt; be that it is almost impossible to get money back from someone if you<br/>\n&gt; pay them by money order.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Message: 1<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Fri, 12 Oct 2001 08:47:12 -0000<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqdealer@...\">eqdealer@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Hot Items!!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Heya!!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Im dont have that much time to play EQ anymore..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to much work at the moment so im selling the last items i have...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The items are..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Cloak of Flames, golden efreeti Bots & 10 000 PP<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The price is 250 Dollars for Everything.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Western Union Money order is prefered as Payment option.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I cant accept paypal at the moment.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Intressted?!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;send me an email to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqdealer@...\">eqdealer@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hope to hear from ya soon...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Jimmy bergman<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Your use of Yahoo!
