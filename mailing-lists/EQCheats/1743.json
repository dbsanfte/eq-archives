I am <br/>\nbeginning to think you people don&#39;t care, I might as well just send <br/>\nan email with the hacks to the only FOUR people who voted. C&#39;mon, I <br/>\nhave checked every day, and NO ONE votes. This group is for these <br/>\nkinds of things, and well, no one wants them but 4 people. I expect <br/>\natleast 30 votes on the poll, or I will just email the hacks for EQ <br/>\nto the people who want them. All the people who didn&#39;t vote then, if <br/>\nthere are less than 30, will not get these and will not have another <br/>\nchance unless they look for a few hours on the internet finding them. <br/>\nSorry people, BUT THERE ARE ONLY 4 VOTES.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
