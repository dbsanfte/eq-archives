I was told that Varsoon<br/>\n&gt; was the tough one. I dont think that Varsoon the<br/>\n&gt; Undead was in at the time, maybe he was changed?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Belgarth<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- &quot;Treadway, Donald&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DTreadway@...\">DTreadway@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Treadway, Donald&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DTreadway@...\">DTreadway@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Varsoon is much lower, in the teens, but when you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kill Varsoon, Varsoon the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Undying spawns.  He looks like a zombie and is MUCH<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tougher.  He was blue to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me at 35, so not sure exactly his level.  I wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; able to take him solo,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s for sure.  I heard that after he chased me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; running and screaming like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a girl into surefall glade, he was killed by a level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 50 wiz, who I guess had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; killed Varsoon in the first place.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Telon on E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Bid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to MSers_Online.
