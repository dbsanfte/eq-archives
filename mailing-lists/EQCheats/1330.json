I was under the impression that it<br/>\n&gt; was the Preacher that had<br/>\n&gt; it. But I can&#39;t seem to get it.. Anyone know if it<br/>\n&gt; is the preacher or is it<br/>\n&gt; in another area ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, I read on everlore that the staffs are part of<br/>\n&gt; a quest. Somehow you<br/>\n&gt; can use the Water Crystal Staff and starts a long<br/>\n&gt; quest to get a great mage<br/>\n&gt; useable one handed magic staff or something... Im<br/>\n&gt; curious if any of you have<br/>\n&gt; any idea as to what it is ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Reuben<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
