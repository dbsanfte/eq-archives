As per my lawyers request I had warned him before not to email me or a proof reading fee would be exempted to his university/his parents.  He sent me an email this morning that was lengthy and I didn&#39;t even bother reading it.  Again (to the people of the list), do not send me private emails.  Mr. Clark is going to have to go to small claims court because of his actions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
