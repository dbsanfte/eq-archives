Is <br/>\nto join a guild, get high level guild members to give you stuff. Then go sell <br/>\nand quit guild. How you like that? Bwahahahah!! I am a Dark Elf Cleric, and I <br/>\nhave about 17 plat in bank. Just from saving. I have basic armor, so do not <br/>\nneed anymore for a while, and do not need anything until level 9 and spells. <br/>\nSo I have just been saving and that is what I have so far. Not too hard, and <br/>\nI am gaining exp along the way. So it is all worth it. Anyone know where I <br/>\ncould get Fine Steel Weapons, or armor off of monsters?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
