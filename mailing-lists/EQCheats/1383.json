You need the Dark <br/>\nCirclet and two Star Rubies. You take these items to Ulan a Centaur in the <br/>\nCentaur Village of South Karana. The /loc on the Centaur Village is 200, <br/>\n-2400. I always Hail him and ask him about the item I want him to make <br/>\nbefore I turn over the quest items to him. I keep my number one inventory <br/>\nslot clear and do not stack the gems. This may be a bit anal but I want to <br/>\nmake sure not to lose anything, and never have doing it this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nRoyal Fire<br/>\nDwarven Paladin of the 30th Order<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 10 Sep 1999, Whitcraft,David wrote:<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Whitcraft,David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DWHITCRAFT@...\">DWHITCRAFT@...</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Who has actually DONE the Crafted Greaves quest?
