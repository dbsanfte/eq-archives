Being a tank or meelee character it is Rather easy to <br/>\npowerlvl. Go to anyplace that has barely red mobs(i have heard that about <br/>\nyour lvl Cazic is real nice...heard) Have a much higher lvl healer type with <br/>\nyou-un grouped- and have them super buff you and heal you while you go at <br/>\nthe red ones solo. If your buddy is a caster type have them nuke the mob to <br/>\nalmost death...mem erase it(enchanters) or have them zone and you just go in <br/>\nand mop up the mostly dead creature  Full exp for you :)<br/>\nIt is much harder to powerlvl if you r a caster....the 6 lvl cap on what you <br/>\ncan hit along with the resist rate being high:( still a healer for your pet <br/>\nif you got one Helps  ALOT  or just have them nuke then zone again  then u <br/>\nblast it to Death :)<br/>\nFor other places  i am not sure at all being that my mage is about lvl 20  I <br/>\nhope this helps any at all  good luck :)<br/>\n<br/>\nArkania<br/>\nNameless<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
