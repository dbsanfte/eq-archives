I<br/>\nthen spent two hours running through Highpass Hold to Freeport  (pants<br/>\nand wheezes).  But then I spent hours running all over the temple of<br/>\nMarr in North Freeport without ever finding the woman I&#39;m supposed to<br/>\ngive the letter to for my reward.  I thought she might be keeping<br/>\nbankers&#39;s hours so I wandered around the temple for two days and nights<br/>\n(game time) without ever seeing her.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan someone please tell me where she is?  I&#39;ll run back to Freeport if I<br/>\ncan be certain of finding her, but it&#39;s a very long trip to waste time<br/>\non just for the hell of it.  Please help me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBarthos (druid of 8 seasons living on Bristlebane)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
