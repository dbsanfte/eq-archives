Enchanter.. yes.  cleric.  no.  =) I&#39;ve seen necros take out<br/>\npeople 7 lvls higher than them.  Heh.  And this was a lvl 14 necro vs a<br/>\nlvl 21 cleric.  Necros own in pvp.  You odn&#39;t believe me..  go dual<br/>\none.  You&#39;ll get your ass handed to you.  I too thought clerics were<br/>\nbadass pvpers and whatnot.  Nope..  I got beat by a necro 3 lvls below<br/>\nme. Clerics are good..  but enchanters and necros have us beat at higher<br/>\nlvls.. hands down.  Necros dots will kill you with a quickness.  I had 5<br/>\nstacked on me and it took about 30 secs for my life to go from full to<br/>\nnada.  Not a pretty sight.  Necros are the shit in pvp.  So are<br/>\nenchanters.  Go dual one.  It&#39;s fun.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
