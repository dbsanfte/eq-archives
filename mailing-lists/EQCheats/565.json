I thought it was crap.<br/>\n Yes... I was using my pottery skill to buy my<br/>\nspells... but listen... I sunk 60 or more plat intio<br/>\npottery just to be able to make a profit! And that<br/>\nwas when I was 10th level! not like I had a cash<br/>\nflowing out of my ears! So it wasn&#39;t like I was just<br/>\nsuddenly good at pottery. It was a HUGE pain in the<br/>\nass! No to mention I was a troll on the pvp server...<br/>\nwhich meant the only place i could buy sketches was<br/>\nall the way down in sro... so i was constantly going<br/>\nfro neriak to sro,... neriak had the pottery wheel<br/>\nand SRO had the sketches. So here I habve wasted all<br/>\nthis time traveling and spending money to get the<br/>\nskill up... and now it is going to be totally<br/>\nuseless! I wouldn&#39;t care if they lowered the profit<br/>\nmargin in half... but dam it...if youre going to have<br/>\na skill in the game.... then make it friggin&#39; have<br/>\nSOME kind of use and value!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat they are doing is not balancing.... it just<br/>\nplain sucks. And, there&#39;s a lot of things sucking<br/>\nabout this game lately and it is starting to really<br/>\ntick me off. It is supposed to gtet better with<br/>\ntime... not worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no use fopr pottery now... no use for<br/>\nbrewing... and no use for baking... so why not take<br/>\nthem out of the game completely? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just so you know... My troll only makes about 15<br/>\nplat an hour... and I can do that with a party<br/>\nkilling dervs. But when I don&#39;t have a party to get<br/>\nwith... it was sure nice to make a little money till<br/>\none came along.<br/>\n-Kenny</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
