First of all, I think you mean the Troll <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Shadowknight in Befallen, which has the BBC.  He spawns past some &gt;spikes<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;on the 3rd floor of befallen.  If you mean the Ogre, it&#39;s &gt;still not true.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve had the TSK spawn right next to me, with the &gt;BBC in hand, at least 3 <br/>\n&gt;times. I&#39;ve had the Ogre SK spawn on top of &gt;my head and drop the barbed <br/>\n&gt;armplates.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So there is definitely no anticamp in Befallen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sandeep<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All the anticamp code does is slow down respawn rates, (making the wait <br/>\nlonger than normal and thereby trying to discourage camping). It doesn&#39;t <br/>\nstop the spawning totally. Try timing some creatures respawn rates sometime <br/>\nin an area where you suspect the codinge has been used.<br/>\nI timed various creatures in Befallen where I suspected the coding was used,<br/>\n<br/>\nand found that respawn rates were a lot slower when you were in the radius <br/>\nof the &quot;sphere of anti-camping&quot;. I would like to stress something here as <br/>\nwell - this DOES NOT mean the anti-camping coding is used everywhere! It&#39;s <br/>\nused in just a FEW areas that I&#39;m aware of. One place I found it used, was <br/>\nthe SK room that has the first key. When I camped that area to test my <br/>\ntheory, it took well over an hour and a half for the SK to respawn. When I <br/>\nstayed about 2 rooms over from the SK room, I found that the SK would <br/>\nrespawn every 45 mins to an hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did this for 2 weeks to test out the rumors I had heard, and also after <br/>\nhaving read an interview with Brad (I believe) about camping, and how they <br/>\nsupposively wouldn&#39;t use any anticamping coding. I also had a bunch of other<br/>\n<br/>\nplayers keep track/time as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF, and I stress IF, there isn&#39;t any anti-camping coding, (and I believe <br/>\nthat there IS, and I could be wrong) I&#39;d like to know why I was told by <br/>\nseveral GM&#39;s and Guides that it does indeed exist, (sorry, no screenshots to<br/>\n<br/>\nback this up as it was at least a month ago I was told) and why there&#39;s an <br/>\nuncanny, and very noticeable pattern by myself and other players as well who<br/>\n<br/>\nhelped me out? PERHAPS this coding has since been removed, which is highly <br/>\npossible; there&#39;s been many patches since I last tested this theory out. I&#39;m<br/>\n<br/>\nnot sure if it has been removed because I don&#39;t camp. I just did it this one<br/>\n<br/>\ntime to test out what I had heard.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 coppers worth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.  <br/>\nCheck out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.  <br/>\nFor details, go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
