Win 98 supports dual<br/>\nmonitors, I&#39;ve seen it done back in Beta when we were testing it.... I also<br/>\nwork coding programs for DINPACS systems, which often use 2 or more HIGH<br/>\n(2400x2000) res monitors... Now, given the way EQ works, I DOUBT that EQ<br/>\nwould come up on one screen and the other would be the rest of the desktop,<br/>\nbut it MIGHT be possible to get to work, I&#39;m not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone tried this?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I wonder if you could write a program that would send a windows<br/>\nmessage to EQ that would minimize or &#39;restore&#39; (take to a smaller window)<br/>\nEQ. Now, THAT might be worth investigating... Anyone tried this? I could<br/>\nprobably figure out a way to find the handle for the EQ window and have a<br/>\nprogram runing in the background automatically send it a restore message<br/>\nafter EQ loads... Wouldn&#39;t that be cool.... <br/>\n<br/>\n-Leod<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Omeg Felligan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:omeg_felligan@...\">omeg_felligan@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, August 19, 1999 8:04 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQCheats] possible big cheat for EQ....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Omeg Felligan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:omeg_felligan@...\">omeg_felligan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one thing that ppl are ignoreing is that EQ logs you off if you <br/>\nalt-tab out, and that your computer all but freezes up...but whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nalso there doesn&#39;t seem to be any way to float anything above EQ while in <br/>\ngame (I&#39;ve tried ICQ&#39;s floating thingy, didn&#39;t work).  so you&#39;d have to <br/>\nwrite a hack to over come this and I&#39;m guessing that would be entirely <br/>\nclient side...either that or have 2 monitors ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nso even if cheat programs were developed (yeah right) than how would you <br/>\neven get to them?<br/>\n<br/>\nOmeg<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nStart a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\nFor details on ONElist&#39;s NEW FRIENDS & FAMILY program, go to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
