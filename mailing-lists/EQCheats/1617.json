Never missed the<br/>\n&gt;  wizard, not nearly as fun as the rogue.  Wizards just nuke and med...

A truly skilled Wizard is much<br/>\n&gt; more than Nuke and Med.  I don&#39;t have time to debate you on this, let me just<br/>\n&gt; paste below a post from a fellow Wizard from the Wizard Listserv - It is good<br/>\n&gt; reading for anyone regardless of class.  The Nuances of playing a Wizard well<br/>\n&gt; are beyond many, but they are vast and incredibly fun and challenging.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wizaro Wrathcaster<br/>\n&gt; 44th Flame of Solusek Ro&#39;s Fire<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
