Being ex-military, and being an ex-intelligence type, and<br/>\n&gt; having been trained/shown how to do it, cracking network protocol and<br/>\n&gt; network protocol encryption is not as hard as you think it is. But don&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; me wrong. It&#39;s not something that you can just hop on a computer and learn<br/>\n&gt; overnight or in just a few hours. You have to know what you&#39;re looking for,<br/>\n&gt; and then, just maybe then, you can figure it out on your own. It would take<br/>\n&gt; months, or possibly even years to learn how on your own.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As i know, there are already alot of cryptic algorithms exists, which<br/>\nmake cryptoanalytical method of cracking fairly ineffective. Of course,<br/>\nmost of them illegal to use without approval of agencies like FBI in USA<br/>\nor FAPSI in my country. Still, if consider server and client as &quot;closed<br/>\nsystems&quot; (unauthorized access is impossible), it is easy to implement<br/>\ncoding what will make cryptoanalytical hack almost impossible. But, i<br/>\ndont think EQ uses really good crypting for its protocol. First, it is<br/>\nvery restricted in many countries, and EQ is international product which<br/>\nsupposed to be legal in all countries. Second, good crypting is very<br/>\ntime-consuming, and EQ server have traffic around 1MB/sec. It is<br/>\nimpossible to encrypt 1MB per second with any serious algorithm. I<br/>\nbelieve it is using something like XOR with random-seeded bitstrings, or<br/>\njust CRC protection, to make his traffic safe. It is enough to force<br/>\nmost &quot;hackers&quot; to use debugger on EQ&#39;s exe instead of much easer parsing<br/>\nof network data. And i never seen games using anything more serious than<br/>\nsuch forms of protection.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
