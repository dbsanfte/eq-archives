I haven&#39;t been<br/>\n able to find squat...<br/>\n <br/>\n Or, any info would be nice... How many things would there be to fight at<br/>\n 32nd level? Could I safely go in an check things out without getting<br/>\n attacked by every other mob there? Normal Invis work or there undead types?<br/>\n <br/>\n Thanks &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could do well in the Bartender room with a good group or even solo maybe. <br/>\n Bartender spawns fairly often and drops Drake Hide Leggings.  I was only <br/>\n23rd lvl when I camped the bar room with 2 full groups of guildmates.  There <br/>\nis also a Goblin Drunkard that drops a foreman tunic I think.  I just <br/>\nscratched the surface of SOL A and I know there is a lot of other good stuff <br/>\nthere.  I saw no Undead there, but there are spellcasting gobs like in <br/>\nRunnyeye who may be able to see invisi. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust so you know, Sol A can get real rough.  While we held the bar room for 5 <br/>\nhours with only one death (er, me - thank god for resurections) and got 7 <br/>\npairs of drake hide leggings (wohooo!) in the final hour (the 6th) our 32 lvl <br/>\nMonk went to pull and somehow came back with a huge train.  I mean HUGE!!!  <br/>\nand then the room spawn occured. AHHHHHHH.  The battle raged for about 7 <br/>\nminutes and in the end, 11 guildmates, half over lvl 30, lay dead and one <br/>\nfrail, scared out of his robe wizard sat medding (no mana to gate - <br/>\nahhhhhhhh) surrounded by 3 goblins who survived.  The gobs just stood over me <br/>\nnot attacking as I tried to med up enough mana to gate.  I&#39;ve never been so <br/>\nscared in my life.  Afraid to stand up and gate for fear of gaining thier <br/>\nattention, I cried for help to the other folks in the dungeon - no help came. <br/>\n I decided to go for the gate, standing up literally under the chin of a <br/>\ngoblin wizard, I appprehensivley began reciting the words for my gate spell <br/>\nhoping the gobs would not hear.  They did not, or they wanted me to live so I <br/>\ncould spread the word about the worst massacre I&#39;ve ever seen.  Safely gating <br/>\nback to High Hold Keep, I have yet to return to Sol A, but will revenge my <br/>\nbothers deaths someday.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizaro WrathCaster<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
