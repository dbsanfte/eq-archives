How?<br/>\nWell.... those of us that used pottery often,<br/>\nespecially the evil races, kept sketches in the bank.<br/>\nI, for one, had 8 back packs full of sketches plus a<br/>\nback pack full on my character at the time I loggerd<br/>\nout teh night before the day of the last update. I<br/>\nfigured i could at least use what sketches I had<br/>\nsaved up to make more pie-tins and thus a little more<br/>\nmoney. well... I log in after the update.... the<br/>\nsketches I have that used to be purchased for a<br/>\nsilver and some odd coin sells for about a plat or<br/>\nso... no big deal. BUT, I can sell my SKETCHES back<br/>\nto a VENDOR for about 5 gold eac.... they used to<br/>\nsell for like 8 copper back to a vendor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... lets do some math here... thats 9 back<br/>\npacks.... each back pack has 160 sketches in it...<br/>\nand each sketch sells for 5 gopld each. Hmmm.....<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard of some people that thought ahead and<br/>\nhad multiple characters with inventories and banks<br/>\nfull of sketches that made ungodly sums of money<br/>\nafter the last update. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn effect.... Verant&#39;s attempt at fixing the game<br/>\neconomy has effectively destroyed it for some people.<br/>\nBut hey, I&#39;m not bitchin&#39;. At least I didn&#39;t have to<br/>\nstand infront of a potttery wheel for hours on end to<br/>\nmake a lot of money.... and it didn&#39;t require me to<br/>\nhave any skill at all... hehe.<br/>\n-Kenny</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
