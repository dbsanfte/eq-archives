I did not expect so <br/>\nmany people to join.  However the number of the people on this list is not <br/>\nworking well with the number of messages (0). So I&#39;m going to start off <br/>\nhopefully.  I&#39;d like to hear from all of you the most rewarding Static Quest <br/>\nyou have been on. If you don&#39;t know what that is, it&#39;s a quest that is <br/>\navailable 24/7. Not a GM or Guild Created quest, those are Dynamic Quests.  <br/>\nBut back onto the subject, the most rewarding static quest I&#39;ve been on is in <br/>\nQeynos (The best city :P), which is the quest of collecting taxes for Vicus, <br/>\nwho is the tax collector but hes got a bit of a cough and he can&#39;t do his <br/>\njob.  <br/>\nHe normally gives a number of silver pieces, experience, and up to 2 items, <br/>\nat least thats the best I&#39;ve had. The biggest silver: 24.  The biggest exp: <br/>\n3/4 of a Bubble. Best items: A gem and an earring.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease reply to the list w/ what you think was the most rewarding quest <br/>\nyou&#39;ve been on. Also if anyone has any tips/hints/tricks on anything that is <br/>\nhelpful in the game, send &#39;em in. And if anyone has questions about something <br/>\nin the game thats not general (i.e. no newbie crap, im not here to babysit, <br/>\nplay the tutorial), don&#39;t hesitate to send in.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
