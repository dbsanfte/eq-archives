I have <br/>\nrecently ditched my Dark Elf characters and went to a Barbarian Warrior. Only <br/>\nafter seeing them slaughter my guards in Nektulos. Was very impressive. What <br/>\nweapon is a good newbie 1 handed slashing weapon? Back in beta I used a rusty <br/>\nfalchion that I got off a decaying skeleton. There something better until I <br/>\nraise enough money to get a mino axe. Or combine sword? Also, any way to <br/>\nlevel really really fast? With a Barbarian Warrior. That is where the cheat <br/>\ncomes into it I guess. Thanks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
