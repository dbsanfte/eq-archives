But I have to put my 2 coppers worth<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your Lawyer obviously doesn&#39;t know squat about electronic mail, laws<br/>\nagainst<br/>\n&gt; spaming or anything else to do with the internet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In order for any contract to be &quot;Binding&quot;  it must be signed or witnessed.<br/>\n&gt; If there was a way to send a registered E-mail, that showed the letter had<br/>\n&gt; been read by the correct recipient then yes Nick you could file a<br/>\nharassment<br/>\n&gt; suit.  As it is your suit or claim to suit is little more than pathetic<br/>\n&gt; attempt to bully a person on the list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Secondly,  all forms of suit are not punishable by monetary gain.  You are<br/>\n&gt; talking a form of harassment.  If anything a restraining order could be<br/>\n&gt; leveled on Mr. Clark but in no way shape or form will there be monetary<br/>\n&gt; compensation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Give us all a break and stop with this thread.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ***** If I receive any personal replies to this E-mail I will charge the<br/>\n&gt; said sender a $500 fee for proof reading.*****<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *****I hold the copywrite to the above message.  If said message is<br/>\nreplied<br/>\n&gt; too with any or all of the content without written permission from me a<br/>\n&gt; royalty fee will be charged of $5 per word.*****<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Aruyall<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Here is how my lawyer put it to me.  If someone sends you unsolicited<br/>\n&gt; email<br/>\n&gt; &gt; once it is fine, but if you warn them after that email saying the<br/>\n&gt; following<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or close to it &quot;any further emails to this address will cost a certain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; amount of money to proofread&quot; it is legally binding.  If the person does<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make a payment within 3 months you can take them to small claims court<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; charge interest on your time and work.  When you warn them, and they<br/>\nsend<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you another email just correct it and send it back to them.  Afterwards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; start litigation.  This is an excellent way to stop hate/spam/annoying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; emails.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to Richard van den Brink<br/>\n&gt; This week&#39;s FRIENDS & FAMILY WINNER!<br/>\n&gt; To enter go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
