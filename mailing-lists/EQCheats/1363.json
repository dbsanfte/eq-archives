Im not sure if this is a bug or not, but stand back where the bartender spawns and you are completely safe from the other gobs in the room, as long as you dont come out from behind there.. you can even kill anything that spawns behind the bar. Of course if you aggro the other ones in the room then go behind the bar, they will follow :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWes Lobdell,<br/>\nNote: I&#39;m not a Mac person, but you have to admit, the following is funny+ACEAIQ- :) And if you don&#39;t +ACI-get+ACI- it, then I guess the media hasn&#39;t soaked it for all its worth yet after all...<br/>\nQuote: +ACI-Macintosh -- we might not get everything right, but<br/>\natleast we knew the century was going to end.+ACI-<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------<br/>\nMy all time favorite Oxymorons:<br/>\nexact estimate, plastic silverware, genuine imitation, mud bath,   original copy, student teacher, alone together, anarchy rules, bitter sweet, bankrupt millionaire, black light, butt-head, casual sex, clean dirt, coed sorority, cold as hell, computer jock, constant change, cowardly lion, curved line(according to the mathematical  definition of a line),  delibrate mistake, dry wine, earth angel(ok thats just going back a ways +ADs-), educational television, even odds, found missing, freezer burn, fresh cheese, full-length bikini, half full, half naked, hard water, hells angels, idiot savant, jumbo shrimp, less is more, and finally my all time<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: MFerrulo+AEA-aol.com MFerrulo+AEA-aol.com<br/>\nTo: EQCheats+AEA-onelist.com EQCheats+AEA-onelist.com<br/>\nDate: Friday, September 10, 1999 2:11 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: +AFs-EQCheats+AF0- Sol A<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: MFerrulo+AEA-aol.com<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 9/10/99 12:55:49 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\nDWHITCRAFT+AEA-cerner.com writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n+AD4APAA8- Anyone have a map or guide or even seen one for Solusk A? I haven&#39;t been<br/>\n able to find squat...<br/>\n <br/>\n Or, any info would be nice... How many things would there be to fight at<br/>\n 32nd level? Could I safely go in an check things out without getting<br/>\n attacked by every other mob there? Normal Invis work or there undead types?<br/>\n <br/>\n Thanks +AD4APg-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could do well in the Bartender room with a good group or even solo maybe. <br/>\n Bartender spawns fairly often and drops Drake Hide Leggings.  I was only <br/>\n23rd lvl when I camped the bar room with 2 full groups of guildmates.  There <br/>\nis also a Goblin Drunkard that drops a foreman tunic I think.  I just <br/>\nscratched the surface of SOL A and I know there is a lot of other good stuff <br/>\nthere.  I saw no Undead there, but there are spellcasting gobs like in <br/>\nRunnyeye who may be able to see invisi. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust so you know, Sol A can get real rough.  While we held the bar room for 5 <br/>\nhours with only one death (er, me - thank god for resurections) and got 7 <br/>\npairs of drake hide leggings (wohooo+ACE-) in the final hour (the 6th) our 32 lvl <br/>\nMonk went to pull and somehow came back with a huge train.  I mean HUGE+ACEAIQAh-  <br/>\nand then the room spawn occured. AHHHHHHH.  The battle raged for about 7 <br/>\nminutes and in the end, 11 guildmates, half over lvl 30, lay dead and one <br/>\nfrail, scared out of his robe wizard sat medding (no mana to gate - <br/>\nahhhhhhhh) surrounded by 3 goblins who survived.  The gobs just stood over me <br/>\nnot attacking as I tried to med up enough mana to gate.  I&#39;ve never been so <br/>\nscared in my life.  Afraid to stand up and gate for fear of gaining thier <br/>\nattention, I cried for help to the other folks in the dungeon - no help came. <br/>\n I decided to go for the gate, standing up literally under the chin of a <br/>\ngoblin wizard, I appprehensivley began reciting the words for my gate spell <br/>\nhoping the gobs would not hear.  They did not, or they wanted me to live so I <br/>\ncould spread the word about the worst massacre I&#39;ve ever seen.  Safely gating <br/>\nback to High Hold Keep, I have yet to return to Sol A, but will revenge my <br/>\nbothers deaths someday.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizaro WrathCaster<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you like to have a voice in the marketplace and be<br/>\nrewarded for it?
