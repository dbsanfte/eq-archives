Each of them can<br/>\ncancel attack. For example, client can allow you casting (you begin to<br/>\ncast a spell) but with some lag &quot;target is out of range&quot; will come from<br/>\nserver and your casting aborted. So i believe no distance cheat is<br/>\npossible. And if even it will be possible, it will be easy for Verant to<br/>\nstop it by adding simple check. BTW, monster&#39;s attacks also checked for<br/>\ndistance in AI, but only by XY coords, and player&#39;s attacks checked by<br/>\nXYZ (and maybe Z check is client side only!). So it is possible when<br/>\nmonsters attack you from far above or below, and you cannot strike back.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I dont know if EQ have the mechanics (however its spelled) to avoid this kind of cheat...<br/>\n&gt; they could send sanity checks asking/sending to the clients lots of stuff to avoid this kind<br/>\n&gt; of cheat but that would increase lag. Seems to me that Verant relies all their protection<br/>\n&gt; (against this kind of cheat) in dont allowing you to ALT-TAB, which is a good protection<br/>\n&gt; but not the best... if you have anything running between you and the server as I mentioned<br/>\n&gt; before you really dont need to ALT-TAB. you can create your own commands that only<br/>\n&gt; your program understand and do not send to the server... lemme see what could be done<br/>\n&gt; easily...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Server do not have any checks for &quot;too fast movement&quot; or &quot;instant<br/>\nteleportation&quot;. There are some &quot;warp holes&quot; exists in several zones. You<br/>\nwalk to some spot and become teleported. It is bug, but when it happens,<br/>\nserver do not make any actions to stop it. Some guys use it as zone<br/>\nborder usually used, or as &quot;guaranteed&quot; shadow step. So instant<br/>\nteleportation isnt checked and can be cheated with. But Verant can add<br/>\nchecking. But it will be not easy - &quot;shadow steps&quot; and &quot;sow&quot; spells make<br/>\nit difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd targeting through wall cannot be checked by server at all. Tracing<br/>\nis too proccessor consuming, and one server works for over 1000 people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; /ultravision on/off<br/>\n&gt; /rain start/stop<br/>\n&gt; /sow on/off   -&gt; As someone mentioned before maybe the server dont<br/>\n&gt; have sanity checks<br/>\n&gt; to see if you are moving too fast... the server might trust the client<br/>\n&gt; too much in this aspect of the game<br/>\n&gt; /levitate on/off<br/>\n&gt; /clipping on/off -&gt; it would allow you to move through walls just like<br/>\n&gt; quake<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, it will be cool :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; /breath on/off -&gt; would let you breath underwater... did you<br/>\n&gt; EVER notice that the air indicator is NEVER<br/>\n&gt; affected by lag ? Maybe the server trust the client too much in<br/>\n&gt; this....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, i think client knows you are in water and approximate your<br/>\nbreathing. It works in same way as health bar - client try to approx it,<br/>\nbut really only server can change it. BTW, about water: on client,<br/>\nmonsters seems to move in water slow (as players), and on server, they<br/>\nmove much faster (almost at land run speed). Seems like Verant made<br/>\nmonsters swim faster, but patched only server, without client :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; again, Verant rely most of their security dont allowing you to<br/>\n&gt; ALT-TAB, and they trust too much in EQ client =P<br/>\n&gt; BUT I can be completely wrong anyway =)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You do not need to hack EQ program to cheat, you can hack network<br/>\nprotocol. All vital data flow through protocol and it is much easer to<br/>\ndecode than program itself. But protocol can be crypted, and impossible<br/>\nto decode at all..<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just think the game is too fun and no one is bored enough to start<br/>\n&gt; coding<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree. If you will start cracking EQ, your friends will gain several<br/>\nlevels and it will be impossible to group with them anymore :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
