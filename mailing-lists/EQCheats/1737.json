Zombie skins and spiderling<br/>\nsilks are a minimum of 10pp EACH (that&#39;s 200pp per stack) right now. Last<br/>\nnight I sold two stacks (I should have brought up more) for 14.9pp per silk.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I actually make sure keep enough silks in inventory and my trader up<br/>\nwhenever I&#39;m not playing, I can make enough for a horse within a week or so<br/>\nwith minimal play.
