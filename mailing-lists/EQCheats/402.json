The<br/>\nfisherman is also 30+ level.  A friend of mine has camped the spot in The<br/>\nRathe for days, he has his clock set for 6 hours, jumps on kills it, logs<br/>\nfor 6 hours, repeats.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has only earned 1pair.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO this is pretty unfair (not just that my friend camps the site) but you<br/>\ntake a serious faction hit with Qeynos vendors and eventually guards for<br/>\nkilling this guy.  There should be some sort of quest for these, or at least<br/>\nsomeway of killing a evil (or non aligned) character to get one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe some of the monsters in the sewers should have them occasionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nWenaddar (non camping bard) of Cazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:karnax@...\">karnax@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:karnax@...\">karnax@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tWednesday, July 07, 1999 6:12 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[EQCheats] Fishbone Earrings<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:karnax@...\">karnax@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone know where the Fishbone earrings can be found, and what you<br/>\n&gt; have to do in order to get them?
