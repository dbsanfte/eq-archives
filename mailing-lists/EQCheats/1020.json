They just moved the Deputy into Misty so he was a<br/>\nzone away. Its a shame they did this because the cheat describe above was<br/>\nabusive and childish. The Deputy was not uncommon and it was VERY easy to do<br/>\nthis quest over and over again without dragging him to the guy that gave the<br/>\nquest. It was a great way to improve faction and get lots of experience<br/>\nquickly. Once they did this stupid dragging trick (which really gained them<br/>\nnothing, you could hail him and lock him in place without doing this) the<br/>\neasy quick part went away. I have no problem with using things to our<br/>\nadvantage, but this trick was unnecessary and cost all of us a great easy<br/>\npower leveling quest for youngsters.<br/>\n<br/>\n=(</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
