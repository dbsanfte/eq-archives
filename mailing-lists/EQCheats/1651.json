This<br/>\n&gt; 7th member will not sure up on the grouping list. Also this 7th<br/>\n&gt; member will gain exp as if he were in the group.  I have no tried<br/>\n&gt; this bug so I can&#39;t verify that it works but here it goes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you have 6 people in a group have one of them disband and<br/>\n&gt; then reinvite him,.then invite the 7th person and have them join<br/>\n&gt; in a<br/>\n&gt; certain order (not sure what order so you might have to play around<br/>\n&gt; with this one).  This bug was submitted by a member of my website <br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; he himself said that he was in a group with 7 people because at one<br/>\n&gt; point the 7th person went link dead and it told the group the he <br/>\nwent<br/>\n&gt; linkdead.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks and let me know if you want more cheats or you can just go to<br/>\n&gt; my website,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Craig<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n&gt; Wish you had something rad to add to your email?<br/>\n&gt; We do at www.supersig.com.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6810/13/_/442966/_/963866862/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6810/13/_/442966/_/963866862/</a><br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Get paid to surf the web!
