I have been told its on<br/>\n&gt; Nafagen&#39;s corpse. Being that I am bearly reaching 20 , I won&#39;t be able to<br/>\n&gt; accomplish this any time soon. I just want to know out of curiosity if this<br/>\n&gt; is true.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, Where does one get the Shimmering orb ? I bought one from a auction<br/>\n&gt; and am curious as to the origination of this item ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh yeah.. I saw this gnome with with a glowing orb of sorts on his<br/>\n&gt; character.. He wouldn&#39;t let me look at it nor would he tell me its name.<br/>\n&gt; Upon the 2 second glance in his inventorey look, it was a blue stone.. kina<br/>\n&gt; like a jewel.. Anyone know what it is ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best place to EXPLORE topics, SHARE ideas, and<br/>\n&gt; CONNECT to people with the same interests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net goto www.everquest.com </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
