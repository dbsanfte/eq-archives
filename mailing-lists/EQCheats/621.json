I loved this game but people got burned out<br/>\non<br/>\nit becuase you could build too fast and then got bored. Then people went<br/>\naround and PKed each other. It turned a wonderful online community into<br/>\na<br/>\ngarbage dump. What is your great hurry? You planning on leaving soon? As<br/>\nlong as you are having fun and meeting new people and playing a game you<br/>\nlike what difference does it make what level you are or how fast you get<br/>\nthere. These games are ment to be played for years not weeks. I am<br/>\nsurprised that people have already been able to max out. Now what do<br/>\nthey<br/>\nhave to do? Ok they can go anywhere and kill almost anything but how<br/>\nlong<br/>\nbefore they get bored and move on? The game has only been out a few<br/>\nmonths.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents<br/>\n<br/>\nFeather Dreamwalker of Rathe<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I agree that level gaining is quite slow. 8-10 hours<br/>\n&gt;for a level is a bit much. I can&#39;t imagine the high<br/>\n&gt;30s and above. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Belgarth <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you enter ONElist&#39;s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\nBy joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
