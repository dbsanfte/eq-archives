If you feel that a guide is being biased and is not adhereing the the<br/>\nrules you may repetition or ask for your issue to be escalated to a GM.<br/>\nPersonally I think it should be legal. If I see halfling guards getting<br/>\nkited you can bet I would love to snare/root the evil %$##$ doing it. IMHO<br/>\nIt is a risk factor that should be allowed.<br/>\n<br/>\nRun through any dungeon killing something and the dungeon NPC residents are<br/>\ngoing to jump in and assist in anyway they can, why should PC residents be<br/>\ntreated eany different? You want to see a train created that causes problems<br/>\nwith getting out of a dungeon... go sit in Splitpaw for a while. At least<br/>\nevery couple of hours the front door area is blocked by 5-15 gnolls of<br/>\nvarious levels due to a train created and all the other NPCs jumping in. I<br/>\ndont see anyone petitioning to get them in trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know in a few areas the higher levels are acting as guards in places they<br/>\nare killing them. This gives the newbies a place to run to that is basically<br/>\nstronger than the guards to begin with since they are killing them after<br/>\nall. These people normally SoW and buff all the newbies also. Yes it takes a<br/>\nway some of the roleplaying perspective but it keeps everyone happy and GMs<br/>\nout of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the issue of &quot;you dont have to kill them, you can hunt somewhere<br/>\nelse&quot; well yes and no. From a roleplaying side if things many people have<br/>\ntaken it upon themselves to pick a race to &quot;eliminate&quot; from Norrath. Neriak<br/>\nguards are high on that list. But so are Ogres. I see plenty of evil<br/>\ncharacters picking off halfling guards and Karanas guards also. So this is<br/>\nnot an issue suffered by evil races only. Dark elves that stay in Nektulos<br/>\nForest for any length of time end up hunting halflings, no reason why<br/>\nhalflings shouldn&#39;t come back and return the favor. I know I do.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
