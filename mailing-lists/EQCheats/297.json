Don t really care what an Monk can","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1074562202\">Personally, I would like to see a site database that I can query to it. I<br/>\nwant to be able to see what a Paladin can carry.  Don&#39;t really care what an<br/>\nMonk can carry.  Just basically filter the data a bit more. (OK, wish list)<br/>\nI would like to be able to sort the data by ac, weight, damage, range, ...<br/>\nmaybe special ability (not sure how this would be done, alphabetical?).  I<br/>\nwould like to see even the basic items listed LIKE BANDED.  I don&#39;t know how<br/>\nmany sites I have gone to and not seen banded listed, which tells me the<br/>\nsite is a joke, because they only list &quot;special&quot; items and/or items in the<br/>\nbook, which I already have.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do like having the spoiler listed on a different page, or farther down the<br/>\npage (if done you should have a big graphic &quot;SPOILER&quot; so people who don&#39;t<br/>\nwant it).  Just note I run with a 1600x1200 resolution so put it far down<br/>\nthe page (I know lucky me, but you stare at a computer screen for 8 to 10<br/>\nhours a day and then go home an play EQ for another 3 to 5 hours)<br/>\n<br/>\nOH, one other thing since it is listed, Race, like to be able to say I was a<br/>\nlarge paladin, again don&#39;t care for the stuff I can&#39;t use because of my<br/>\nrace.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes I would do this but don&#39;t have a database available to me that<br/>\npeople could query to, and don&#39;t have a server I can put the data on.  I<br/>\nwould be willing to help (stress help) with the database and development of<br/>\nthe web pages, but I don&#39;t have those tools available to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Michael Ott &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mott@...\">mott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 29, 1999 5:02 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQCheats] Unique Items<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Michael Ott &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mott@...\">mott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nits a good idea if it is carried through... so far i have yet to see a site<br/>\nthat really does that. No one takes the time to actually build a database of<br/>\nstuff most rely on volunteer submissions wh8ich sucks because you dont get a<br/>\ngood response that way. Whoever runs a site needs to go out and do most of<br/>\nthe research and keep it up with all of the current patches once again I<br/>\nhave not yet seen this...<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jason Harrell [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jharrell@...\">jharrell@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 29, 1999 2:45 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQCheats] Unique Items<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jason Harrell&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jharrell@...\">jharrell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Snip&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
