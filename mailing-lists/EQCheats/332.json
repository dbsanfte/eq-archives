Second I check with a GM ( not a guide a real verant employed GM ) and he told me how the exp bonus works. If you have a full group of people with the majority of the people within 4 levels ( 4 people or more ) then the 25% bonuns goes to the highest level person. If the majority people are more then 4 levels away ( again 4 people or more ) then the experience bonus goes to the lowest level person.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
