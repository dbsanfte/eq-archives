Simply pick up the item in question with you<br/>\ncursor then have the caster target you and cast the spell. Whatever<br/>\nthe targeted player is &quot;holding&quot; (ie Floating on the cursor) will be<br/>\nindentified.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took a little bit of trial and error, but I finally figured out<br/>\nthat that is how the spell works. I am a wizzie and when I cast the<br/>\nspell, it would tell me that I didn&#39;t have a target. So I targeted<br/>\nmyself, and then it told me that I wasn&#39;t &quot;holding&quot; anything. That<br/>\ntook a while to realize I could have an object on my cursor and still<br/>\nfire off a spell. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never tried it on other people, but I don&#39;t see why it wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nwork on them either.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
