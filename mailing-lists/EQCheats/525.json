They do FAR more damage than any other class at all levels,<br/>\nthey get pretty much every combat-utility spell that any other class gets<br/>\n(like roots, disempowers, debuffs, etc), AND get the ability to summon pets<br/>\nof higher level than any other class.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to be a huge bitch or anything.  I was fine with that at first, but<br/>\nsince EVERY recent patch has included further buffing or tuning of the necro<br/>\nclass it just seems to be getting a little absurd to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomebody tell me what the drawback is for their class...  being hated by<br/>\nsome NPCs?  After having played a troll for several months and being KOS by<br/>\nEVERY npc north of innothule.... the necros have it easy... like super-easy.<br/>\nThen they went and gimped the shamans and I just honestly can&#39;t figure out<br/>\nwhat is going on.  I&#39;m guessing I&#39;m not seeing the whole picture or<br/>\nsomething.... because recent events just haven&#39;t made any sense to this<br/>\nstupid troll.<br/>\n<br/>\n-K<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nHeart Flutter also drops a monsters AC by 47 and his str by 17, hit it with<br/>\nthe 1st lvl spell Siphon Str and that gives 10 more Str to you.
