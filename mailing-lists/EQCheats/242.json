First off the Fiery Avenger is two handed and<br/>\n&gt; Paladin&#39;s wield one handed swords. Orginally it was supposed to be<br/>\n&gt; Paladin only but in beta Paladin&#39;s moved frorm using two handed swords<br/>\n&gt; as their holy swords to one handed. Also Shadow Knights big weapon is<br/>\n&gt; the Dark Reaver 20 dmg 42 dly and casts some spell. The warriors big<br/>\n&gt; weapon is the Executioner&#39;s Axe 25dmg 50dly both the Dark Reaver and<br/>\n&gt; Axe are in Lower Guk.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Aradune himself stated the sword would be paladin only in release.  What<br/>\nare we in now?  Release.  So that makes the fiery avenger what?  Paladin<br/>\nonly.  Simple deductive reasoning would show you where we got our<br/>\nanswer.  Sheesh.  And..  Paladins can handle a 2hand sword just as good<br/>\nas a 1 hand sword.. heh.  Most paladins i see have 2hand slash weapons<br/>\nactually.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
