I know of only<br/>\none and it seems to have been pulled or I am at a maximum faction with them<br/>\n<br/>\nGet the squad ring quest completed and everytime you turn in ring to Hendi<br/>\nshe will give you pluses with Clerics.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever I dont get them anymore. I lost it around the time they made rings<br/>\nnodrop to prevent the assholes from scamming people for money for them. The<br/>\nring is a faction based reward so if you didnt earn it you couldnt get it<br/>\nrecharged and people were selling them for 80pp and when the victim turned<br/>\nit it it poofed and the seller went back and got it again. and resold it...<br/>\nmay have been a coincidence but it seemed to quit giving me faction on<br/>\nrecharge then.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that I never found any faction improvements for them... they are<br/>\nPriestsofMischief.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe making honeyjum will do it. Its another all its own quest. It improves<br/>\na lot factions I just cant remember all who.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested in Rivervale quests above they are on my website. I<br/>\nonly have a few zones up right now as I am verifying them all myself if I<br/>\ncan.<br/>\n<br/>\nLigge<br/>\nwww.eqguide.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
