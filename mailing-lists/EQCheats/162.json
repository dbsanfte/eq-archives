Except you do of course<br/>\nnot get the pluses on any statistics. Rather worthless as it is since in<br/>\nthe end any piece of reinforced you make will wind up costing you more than<br/>\nit would have to just buy or hunt for snakeskin. Atfer around 23 failed<br/>\nreinforced attempts I got 2 improvements in the skill with my 77<br/>\nintelligence. Unless they start to allow the stacking of boning and studs<br/>\nthis skill is just too damned hard to work on.<br/>\n<br/>\nHm, I see from the others that I&#39;m having spectacularly bad luck in getting<br/>\nthese HQ bear pelts. I mostly fought both common lands and the Karanas for<br/>\npelts and occasionally went to Everfrost. I&#39;m starting to wonder if the<br/>\nrumors about weapon type affecting the pelts dropped are true. I wield two<br/>\npiercing weapons and almost never get anything other than a ruined pelt or<br/>\nskin from animals. The exception being of course pumas who always seem to<br/>\nhave either med or HQ pelts for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nA.
