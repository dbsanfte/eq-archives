He only<br/>\nplayed the regular old servers. No pvp. Oh... and if<br/>\nyou use Linux... there is no way they can tell if you<br/>\nare using it... because that would require them to<br/>\nlook at your network... which is illegal. The only<br/>\npeople that have been caught were using the Windows<br/>\nversion (which is no more), or were stupid enough to<br/>\nsay something about it in game. So... don&#39;t expect too<br/>\nmany bans from it... but it does happen from time to<br/>\ntime... like with nmy friend who was cancelling his<br/>\naccount anyway and announced to the whole server that<br/>\nhe was using it. Hehehe. was funny actually.<br/>\n-Kenny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
