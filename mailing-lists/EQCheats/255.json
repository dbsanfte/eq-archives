I haer there is an<br/>\nSK only weapon....Fiery Avenger for paladins i guess, Druids have the<br/>\noaken scimitar...I hear tell of a ranger only weapon too.  Warrior&#39;s<br/>\nshould be able to use any and all weapons, they are the MASTERS of melee.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA monk or any other class can&#39;t toast you if they can&#39;t hit you.  Blind,<br/>\nFear, Root(which paladins get) plus many other spells like levitate or<br/>\nwhatnot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPaladins can LAY ON HANDS.....that, from what i undestand, heals up to 500<br/>\nHP.....500 HIT POINTS.  Thats a good amount in my eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Verant did a pretty good job balancing the class&#39;s.  Not too<br/>\nmention this game is not a PvP game...its meant for grouping and fun.  I<br/>\nthink they balanced the class&#39;s against NPC&#39;s excelently....if you want<br/>\nto PvP, go to a game that was meant for it or go play quake.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
