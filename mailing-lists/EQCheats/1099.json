They posted the messages and<br/>\nsuch that were sent back and forth between them and<br/>\nVerant. They had screenshots of the thing in action.<br/>\nAnd, according to them, they had been working on it<br/>\nsince the game was in beta because a few of them<br/>\nmanaged to get into the testing of EQ. Origin had<br/>\nleft out a vital line in their software agreement<br/>\nthat allowed them to LAWFULLLY make the emulator.<br/>\nVerant, howver, covered themseleves in their<br/>\nagreement, which youhave to agree to to play the<br/>\ngame. The emulator was not a full functional thing<br/>\nanyway... nor is the one for Ultima Onlline. For<br/>\ninstance.... none of the NPC quests were there... you<br/>\nwould have had to make your own via an editor like in<br/>\nUltima Online Emulator. The way they talked, EQ and<br/>\nUltima Online were both about the same as far as<br/>\nmaking the emulators. I believed them. And, I just<br/>\nthink it is a matter of time before someone does it<br/>\njust li9ke with Ultima Online. Someone will release<br/>\none not caring about Verant&#39;s threats.<br/>\n-Kenny</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
