I mean, all spell and<br/>\nhotkey functions were gone, as if fear effect continued forever.<br/>\nWe were forced to camp to clear effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could have taken Nag easily if not for this.  Losing 2 out of 3 clerics<br/>\ndoes sort of affect the outcome of battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not a bitch nor am I inviting complaints<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to know if anyone else has encountered this.  We had a nice long talk<br/>\nwith our Servers head GM and she wants to know as well so they can fix this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance<br/>\n<br/>\nJoatmos<br/>\nXegony.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
