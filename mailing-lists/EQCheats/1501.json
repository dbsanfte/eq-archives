While not all<br/>\nof it will come from quests in the Temple of Solusek Ro, most of the armor will.<br/>\nThere will be SK armor, it has a black plate apperance (nice), ranger is green<br/>\nchain, cleric gold plate, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe possible problem that may arise, if the do these quests like they &quot;fixed&quot;<br/>\nseveral of the other quests, is that if ANY of these quests rely on one static<br/>\nspawn that you have to kill.  Often times these spawns are 6-8 hours apart, are<br/>\nheavily camped, etc.  Anyone seen how badly Befallen and Kerra Isle are camped<br/>\n(almost 24/7) now that the Paw of Opella information has become known?  The<br/>\nTestiment is even worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf these quests require one static spawn that has the necessary item rare or a<br/>\nlong spawn time, it&#39;s another useless quest IMO.  I would much rather continue<br/>\nto get experience and fight in places that are challenging, instead of sitting<br/>\non a static spawn for hours to get an item.  I&#39;d love to have the best equipment<br/>\nin the game, but not at the expense of my enjoyment.  I have a hard enough time<br/>\nto put 3-4 hours together on a week night, let alone some of the 16 hours people<br/>\nhave camped for the rings from Mitty (Paw quest).  My worst horror story is 12<br/>\nhours for JBoot, but at least I was getting experience at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf camping is what is required (even though it&#39;s now a &quot;quest&quot;), I really don&#39;t<br/>\nsee this as any improvement to the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully this will not be the case with these new quests.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
