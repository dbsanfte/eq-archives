It was real and it worked but they<br/>\ndecided not to release because of the threats and<br/>\nbecause they said tehy loved the game too much to<br/>\nmake the creators mad. They also said tehy decided<br/>\nnot to release it because the code could make it<br/>\npossible for cheats to be developed that would take<br/>\nadvantage of the real EQ servers and they didn&#39;t want<br/>\nto ruin the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was called Emuq and the link to the website was:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.swileys.com/emuq/\">http://www.swileys.com/emuq/</a><br/>\nI don&#39;t know if anything about it is still there or<br/>\nnot.
