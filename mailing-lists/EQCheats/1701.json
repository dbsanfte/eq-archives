There are some wandering goblins, but also wandering orges,<br/>\nwhich at your level are lethal.  Go with some backup.  There are 2<br/>\ngoblin camps as well (not the aqua goblins, those are light blue<br/>\nskinned, stick with green skin goblins).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Laurie pointed out, there are Cultural Forges, and regular forges. <br/>\nYou may be using a Cultural Forge (they would say something like Elven<br/>\nForge, or Dwarven Forge in the title vs just Forge).  Find just a<br/>\n&quot;Forge&quot; and try again on the sharpening.
