And how can you say<br/>\nthat he alone<br/>\n\t\tearned the loot of that MOB?  There were dozens of people<br/>\nthere all helping<br/>\n\t\tto kill the Archon and lesser critters that had been<br/>\nsummoned.<br/>\n\t\tUnfortunately, he did not even necessarily do the most<br/>\ndamage, since GM<br/>\n\t\tcontrolled NPC&#39;s are open for anyone to loot after they are<br/>\nkilled.  Here is<br/>\n\t\tBrian&#39;s post to the ranger list.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Brian Hook&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhook@...\">bhook@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI have some spare time this week, and as such I&#39;ve been<br/>\ndoing some GM events<br/>\n\t\tafter hours on various servers (I was Morxxa Mangyfur the<br/>\nWerewolf in SK on<br/>\n\t\tTunare; the named Archon in Cazic-Thule on Cazic-Thule and<br/>\nXegony; the<br/>\n\t\tUndead Vizier on the chessboard on Cazic-Thule; Frumpy<br/>\nDarkpaw in<br/>\n\t\tblackburrow on Cazic-Thule), and I&#39;ve learned some<br/>\ninteresting things about<br/>\n\t\tplayers in general.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFirst, higher level players are weenies.  It&#39;s that simple.<br/>\nThe minute a<br/>\n\t\tfight turns against them, they&#39;re zoning.  They&#39;re also<br/>\ngenerally very<br/>\n\t\tstupid the minute something unexpected happens.  I was an<br/>\nArchon in<br/>\n\t\tCazic-Thule and while they were having a picnic in the lower<br/>\nthrone room I<br/>\n\t\tpopped a justicar, herald, and a champion to liven things up<br/>\nfor the<br/>\n\t\tWinnebago crowd.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tNOTE: If you are killed by a GM/possessed NPC, you do NOT<br/>\nlose exp!<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThe zone freaked, had no idea what to do.  Some mid to high<br/>\n40s showed up<br/>\n\t\tand tried to take me out (they were a little, um,<br/>\nfoolhardy), doing shouts<br/>\n\t\tof &quot;I&#39;ll defeat him!&quot;, then -- get this -- sending in their<br/>\npets ONE AT A<br/>\n\t\tTIME.  There was a 50th necro and a 48th magician there, and<br/>\ntheir pets are<br/>\n\t\tMEAN.  But they sent them in one at a time -- easy for me to<br/>\ndeal with (I<br/>\n\t\twas a 50th wizzie).  If both pets had come in, I would have<br/>\nbeen toast.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tStupid stupid stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSome of them stormed in, expecting me to be about 35th<br/>\nlevel, and I nuked<br/>\n\t\tthem instantly.  So they started whining about it being<br/>\n&quot;unfair&quot;.  Someone<br/>\n\t\telse in the zone started OOCing how this was &quot;ruining&quot; their<br/>\nevening because<br/>\n\t\tall they wanted to do was get some rubicite and log.<br/>\nHearing things like<br/>\n\t\tthat makes me almost want to give up on the game (or its<br/>\nplayers).<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAnyway, instead of getting organized, they hid in the<br/>\ncourtyard.  Now, at<br/>\n\t\tthis point I had only a small contingent of bodyguards, but<br/>\nmore important,<br/>\n\t\tI only had THREE spells memorized -- Ice Comet, Conflag, and<br/>\nFrost Shock.<br/>\n\t\tNone of those can be cast very quickly.  Two good tanks, two<br/>\nclerics, and<br/>\n\t\tone wizzie could have killed me EASILY, but they refused to<br/>\ncome after me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAs I was getting bored sitting with my gorillas in the<br/>\nthrone room, I walked<br/>\n\t\tout into the courtyard -- ALONE -- and proceeded to cast,<br/>\nkilling a few<br/>\n\t\tfolks.  Now here&#39;s the even sadder part -- I walked out,<br/>\nalone, into a room<br/>\n\t\tof about 20 players from 20th to 50th level, AND NO ONE<br/>\nBOTHERED ROOTING OR<br/>\n\t\tSTUNNING ME.  They tried to kill me, but instead of taking<br/>\naway my ability<br/>\n\t\tto run or cast, they just tried to kill me quick.  Then,<br/>\neven stupider, two<br/>\n\t\tof the casters chased me into the maze...alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tDumb dumb dumb.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSo I ran back to lick my wounds and hid in the throne room,<br/>\nbut they<br/>\n\t\twouldn&#39;t give chase.  I finally decided that it was time for<br/>\nme to die, so I<br/>\n\t\tran to the zone border to kill people looting their corpses<br/>\n(*evil grin*),<br/>\n\t\tand finally I got dropped by a nice crowd.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tOkay, so here&#39;s the loot I dropped: full set of rubicite and<br/>\na shimmering<br/>\n\t\tsilk robe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAnd here&#39;s the point where I get miffed: if a GM is killed<br/>\nin an event,<br/>\n\t\t&quot;ninja looting&quot; can happen since ANYONE can loot the corpse,<br/>\nnot the<br/>\n\t\tperson/party responsible for most damage.  A 50th wizard<br/>\nlooted my corpse<br/>\n\t\tand got ALL the rubi, then said he didn&#39;t find anything.  In<br/>\naddition, he<br/>\n\t\tdidn&#39;t distribute it to anyone else that was in the battle<br/>\n-- he kept it for<br/>\n\t\this guild (presumably).<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThis really upset me, but because of a error on my part the<br/>\ntwo rubi bracers<br/>\n\t\tthat were dropped were in a backpack and couldn&#39;t be looted<br/>\n(except by me).<br/>\n\t\tI then looted my corpse and awarded the bracers to a 42nd<br/>\nlevel wizzie that<br/>\n\t\tplayed smart, fierce, and was RP the whole way.  I&#39;m still<br/>\nupset that the<br/>\n\t\t50th wizzie didn&#39;t share the loot with the tanks that were<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAt one point a 32nd level SK said something like &quot;Hey<br/>\nlizzie, I&#39;m wearing<br/>\n\t\tyour brother as a cloak!&quot; so I teleported to him and said<br/>\n&quot;HSSSS!  THEN YOU<br/>\n\t\tDIE!&quot;  He was with a party of 30s camping near the Avatar<br/>\nroom.  He RAN as<br/>\n\t\tfast as he could, but his party put up a REAL good fight.  I<br/>\nmean GOOD.<br/>\n\t\tThey could have taken me down...almost.  I popped an Archon<br/>\nthat wasted most<br/>\n\t\tof them, but they nearly killed me.  But that party was<br/>\nsmart, organized,<br/>\n\t\tand BRAVE. I wish I had caught their names because I would<br/>\nhave rewarded<br/>\n\t\tthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThat party of low 30s had more guts and smarts than a whole<br/>\nzone of 40s.<br/>\n\t\t*sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tIn a way I think a lot of high level players have become<br/>\nused to how things<br/>\n\t\twork, and once things stop working that way, they get really<br/>\nconfused and<br/>\n\t\tdon&#39;t know what to do.  I think a PvP player would have done<br/>\na LOT better.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWhen I did the event on Cazic-Thule a 32nd level paladin<br/>\n(wearing bronze)<br/>\n\t\tlooted me, but since I had an ebony blade on me he gave it<br/>\nto a ranger that<br/>\n\t\thad helped, and he also gave away the rubi pants to another<br/>\ntank.  Oh, and<br/>\n\t\ton Cazic-Thule I buffed myself so that basically ONLY melee<br/>\ntypes could kill<br/>\n\t\tme -- I gave myself insane magic resistance.  When I went<br/>\ndown on CT server<br/>\n\t\tI was taking about 400 points of damage per tick from 12<br/>\nmelee fighters,<br/>\n\t\twhich is EXACTLY what I wanted since I was dropping melee<br/>\ngear.  I was NOT<br/>\n\t\tgoing to let a wizzie get a full set of rubi again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tDuring another event, when I was the werewolf in SK,<br/>\nEVERYONE kept running<br/>\n\t\tfrom me for the zone.  They kept trying to pull me to the<br/>\nzone so they could<br/>\n\t\tfight then zone if they were getting hurt.  I wouldn&#39;t play<br/>\nthat way, and<br/>\n\t\tsummoned a cyclops to help keep the zone clear (MWUHAHAHA).<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tDuring the entire SK event, I killed only TWO people.  One<br/>\nof them was a<br/>\n\t\t35th level dwarven warrior wearing bronze.  He fought<br/>\nbravely -- when I got<br/>\n\t\thim to one bub of health, instead of running he stood up and<br/>\nwent down<br/>\n\t\tswinging.  Never cried for help, never tried to run.  And<br/>\nthere was a crowd<br/>\n\t\taround that didn&#39;t bother healing him either.  This warrior<br/>\n-- Aindolmar --<br/>\n\t\twas an exemplary example of a brave, RPing player.  I<br/>\nrewarded him after my<br/>\n\t\tdeath (I dropped a werewolf cloak and tunic for those that<br/>\ncare to know)<br/>\n\t\tspecifically with a crafted breastplate.  He was wielding a<br/>\nBBC (I think)<br/>\n\t\tand wearing bronze with no other twinks.  He wasn&#39;t in a<br/>\nguild that I could<br/>\n\t\ttell, and was playing the game &quot;legit&quot; as it were.  More<br/>\nimportant, it<br/>\n\t\tlooked like he was playing in the spirit of the game, and I<br/>\nrewarded that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFinally, when I was the undead vizier on the chessboard, I<br/>\nwas a 25th level<br/>\n\t\twizard.  A 15th level dwarven warrior (gotta love those<br/>\ndorfs!) named<br/>\n\t\tThrombrir kept trying to rally everyone to attack me.  A<br/>\ncouple druids kept<br/>\n\t\trunning from me -- and they were 24th and 37th level<br/>\nrespectively -- and<br/>\n\t\tplayed like complete weenies.  This warrior ran up and<br/>\nstarted whacking on<br/>\n\t\tme, ALONE.  No party, no backup, but I was conning BRIGHT<br/>\nRED to him, but he<br/>\n\t\tdidn&#39;t care.  Once again, he was not a twink -- he had on<br/>\nringmail and some<br/>\n\t\trawhide -- and he was busy RPing like crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tIn that battled I dropped an FBR -- which a 42nd level necro<br/>\nlooted, as if<br/>\n\t\tshe needed it (and I don&#39;t think she shared).  But I had<br/>\nalready learned not<br/>\n\t\tto reward people that looted my body -- too many selfish<br/>\ntypes.  So now I<br/>\n\t\tkeep track of players that are brave, smart (if that&#39;s in<br/>\ncharacter),<br/>\n\t\tuntwinked, and role-playing, and I reward them appropriately<br/>\nafter the<br/>\n\t\tbattle.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThrombrir received crafted gauntlets and one crafted bracer<br/>\nto replace his<br/>\n\t\trawhide.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMy point?  The lower level types played well, smart, and<br/>\nwere having fun,<br/>\n\t\tand the higher levels were busy screaming about things being<br/>\nunfair, were<br/>\n\t\tdoing dumb stuff, wouldn&#39;t leave the zone border, and<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t share loot.<br/>\n\t\tOh, and when high levels hear about an event via &quot;guildsay&quot;,<br/>\nthey all come<br/>\n\t\tto kill me so they can get the loot.  It&#39;s frustrating being<br/>\na 25th level<br/>\n\t\tmob and getting taken down by a 50th SK instead of a crowd<br/>\nof 20s.  But I<br/>\n\t\tcan&#39;t pick and choose who comes to kill me, so the best I<br/>\ncan do is make<br/>\n\t\tsure that the right people are rewarded.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAn explanation of my &quot;anti-twinking&quot; policy is probably in<br/>\norder for those<br/>\n\t\tof you in a guild or that are twinked:<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t- these events are role playing events.  All the ones I<br/>\ndescribed I did<br/>\n\t\talone without any input from others, in an attempt to spice<br/>\nup the game for<br/>\n\t\tsome folks.  As such, I reward role players.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t- I don&#39;t reward twinks because, well, they don&#39;t need the<br/>\nstuff and often<br/>\n\t\tdon&#39;t appreciate what they received.  There was an 11th<br/>\nlevel wizzie wearing<br/>\n\t\tan FBR at the chessboard, and I killed him THREE times =)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t- the players that really need the gear are often the ones<br/>\nleast willing to<br/>\n\t\tsacrifice their ideals (camping/twinking) to get the gear.<br/>\nBy rewarding<br/>\n\t\tthese players in events like these it spreads good word of<br/>\nmouth, and more<br/>\n\t\timportant, instills a sense of faith that they&#39;ve been doing<br/>\nthe right thing<br/>\n\t\tby RPing instead of power gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAnyway, I await your flames :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tBrian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; ----------<br/>\n\t\t&gt; From: \tA Good Egg[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:douglas@...\">douglas@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\t&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\t&gt; Sent: \tThursday, August 05, 1999 4:12 PM<br/>\n\t\t&gt; To: \t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\t&gt; Subject: \tRE: [EQCheats] Gob Pets in Oasis?<br/>\n\t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; From: A Good Egg &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:douglas@...\">douglas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n\t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; On Thu, 5 Aug 1999, Treadway, Donald wrote:<br/>\n\t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Treadway, Donald&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DTreadway@...\">DTreadway@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n\t\t&gt; &gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; &gt; In fact it was Brian Hook, formerly of Quake 3 fame who<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ran that event.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; The<br/>\n\t\t&gt; &gt; thing that disgusts me is that that wizard told everyone<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that the Archon<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; &gt; dropped nothing.
