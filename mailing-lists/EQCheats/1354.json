He&#39;s not<br/>\nlisted on any maps I&#39;ve seen, so I&#39;ll tell ya his location first. He&#39;s down<br/>\naround the corner from Bonecraker. His room should be just across the wall<br/>\nfrom Bonecracker actually. Has some blood in the room with a misty type<br/>\nwaterfall. Two elementals, a mage plus pet, Trazdon&#39;s spawn point (can be<br/>\nhim or a mage from my experience), plus an ogre (officer when I was there,<br/>\nhe never cam edown to assist or anything so I never killed him). At level<br/>\n32, the mages were still agressive, although two 149 damage spells kills<br/>\nthem. Pets are three of the same I think. Get em as they spawn and yer fine.<br/>\nTrazdon isn&#39;t a whole lot harder, but again, I&#39;m 32 so I resisted most of<br/>\nhis spells. He was low low blue to me, the mages were greens (agressive<br/>\ngreen). <br/>\n<br/>\nI held the room with little problem as a 32 Shaman (although a nice cleric<br/>\ntraded buffs with me for a sow, so I had like 804 hp...heh...that was nice).<br/>\nI think it&#39;s a 20 minute spawn cycle.<br/>\n<br/>\nNever camped the others, so I don&#39;t know for sure, but they should be about<br/>\nthe same.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MFerrulo@...\">MFerrulo@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MFerrulo@...\">MFerrulo@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 10, 1999 12:46 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQCheats] Crafted Greaves<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MFerrulo@...\">MFerrulo@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 9/10/99 12:00:44 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jj@...\">jj@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; <br/>\n Trazdon carries the circlet for the greaves...
