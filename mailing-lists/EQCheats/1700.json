Orc (with the help of a Dwarf with a Big <br/>\n&gt; hammer.) (Note: the Spy and the Gen. Orc can be found talking <br/>\n&gt; together at -2096.28, 2326.77  in Greater Faydark)and they can be <br/>\n&gt; pulled with spells one at a time) I got their heads and turned them <br/>\n&gt; in to Seria and got the dull sword I&#39;m to sharpen the sword, and turn <br/>\n&gt; it in with  some arborean amber and a P.forest drakeling scale to get <br/>\n&gt; the first pally sword....well the dum sword will not sharpen, I use 1 <br/>\n&gt; and 2 sharping stones, the sword and put them in the forge in the <br/>\n&gt; armorer&#39;s shop and I&#39;m told &quot;these idems will not combine try another <br/>\n&gt; forge...WHAT other forge??
