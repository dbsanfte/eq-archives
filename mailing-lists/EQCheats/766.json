As a High Elf<br/>\n&gt;Enchanter, I have a reasonably high base charisma, many charisma items,<br/>\n&gt;and a charisma spell. After some experimentation, I have come to the<br/>\n&gt;conclusion that charisma&#39;s effect on pricing maxes at just over 100.<br/>\n&gt;Higher charisma than that makes no difference in pricing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also have spells which can improve my faction with vendors, and have<br/>\n&gt;found that faction higher than &quot;looks at you indifferently&quot; makes no<br/>\n&gt;difference in pricing. If it&#39;s lower than that, your price will be<br/>\n&gt;worse, but better won&#39;t improve prices any more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The final factor is the vendor multiple. Some vendors just sell things<br/>\n&gt;for a higher base price. Charisma and faction still have an effect, but<br/>\n&gt;the range of possible prices is higher.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That&#39;s what I know about vendor pricing.

There seems<br/>\n&gt;to be a cap at a CHA<br/>\n&gt; of 117 for the Star Rubies at a little over 68pp each.<br/>\n&gt;The lower your<br/>\n&gt; charisma, the higher the gems will cost. I&#39;d not like to<br/>\n&gt;think that anyone<br/>\n&gt; will debate this, since I&#39;m fairly certain that it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;applicable to everyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html\">http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html</a><br/>\n&gt;With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\n </span></blockquote>goto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
