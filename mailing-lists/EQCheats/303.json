I have a question or two about the basement of Befallen...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went down in hopes of getting a BBC for our Pally last night.  We were<br/>\nthere for two hours or so, and never saw the SK.  We were told that there is<br/>\na &quot;spawn line&quot;, ie, don&#39;t cross it or the SK will not spawn.  Is this the<br/>\ncase?  If so, is that line at the end of the tunnel?  Or inside the room?<br/>\nIt was fairly frustrating.  Also, there was another group there camping for<br/>\nthe Robes, and I never saw that Theor..they...whatever guy that is supposed<br/>\nto drop the robes.  Does the same thing apply for him?<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly..how often would you say the SK would normally spawn?  Every 1/2<br/>\nhour?  Hour?  2 hours?  I probably will not return to Befallen, unless it is<br/>\nwith my Paladin with the objective of getting that BBC for him....so the<br/>\ninfo would be appreciated.  That place is just swarming with DE&#39;s, and it<br/>\nmakes my dwarven skin crawl.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nDameat<br/>\n14th Level Dwarven Cleric (AND Master Brewer)<br/>\nRodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
