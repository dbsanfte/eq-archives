But , with a little<br/>\ningenuity, one could think up possibly buying a few summoned bags off of a<br/>\nshaman  or doing the traveler&#39;s backback quest - both items which make<br/>\nanything in them weightless.  I have done the majority of all my<br/>\nblacksmithing and pottery by fetching the materials from the mudites, and it<br/>\nhas been long tedious and at times down right irritating, but i&#39;ve worked<br/>\nhard for what i&#39;ve made :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRebequa<br/>\n16th Rogue<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
