The guards <br/>\nwere green and the shamans were blue, also at level 33, so they are much <br/>\nlower.  They were all amiable except the chief, so I didn&#39;t kill any &lt;G&gt;.  <br/>\nAlso, the Chief said something about [enchanting the stone] when I hailed <br/>\nhim...and when I asked him about that, he said I had best be on my way and <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t talk about it.  I assume he was referring to the large stone they <br/>\nare all standing around...anyone have more info or get something else out of <br/>\nthe chief?<br/>\n<br/>\nMa`ar, Innoruuk<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;    They are found on the Ogres in W.
