No way they could send that much information over<br/>\nthe &#39;net, isn&#39;t possible. So, the graphics have to be stored locally. You<br/>\ncould write something to alter the packets as they come in to filter out<br/>\ncertain graphics messages (blind, rain, nighttime, spell effects, etc), or<br/>\nyou might be able to hack the graphics files themseleves and just take these<br/>\naffects out.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of these bother me enough to want to wirte anything to filter packets<br/>\nthough.... *chuckle*<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: kale usi [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, August 27, 1999 11:17 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQCheats] Is the verdict finally in?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;kale usi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Michael O&#39;Reilly &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michael@...\">michael@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think not.

I don&#39;t know for sure either way - in my opinion I <br/>\nagree with you. However, the main thing I&#39;m wondering at this point is - <br/>\nwhat applications could hacking the files stored client side have? It has me<br/>\n<br/>\non pins and needles. I hope that nothing major comes of this. I&#39;d hate like <br/>\nhell to see my hours of work earning items, cash, etc go down the tubes. Yet<br/>\n<br/>\non another aspect, I&#39;m intrigued. 8p<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations GENEVINCENT.
