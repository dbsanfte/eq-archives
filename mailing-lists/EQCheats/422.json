I have screen shots even.  Anyway, they looted<br/>\nit and started shouting complaints because it&#39;s a lvl 35 mob, and all it had<br/>\non it was a couple of spider silk, spider legs and like 5 gp or something?<br/>\nIt was quite a rip.  Of course, I saw this at least 2 or 3 patches ago, so<br/>\nthe whole world of norrath could be completely freakin different now.<br/>\n* Kzak<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nThe Terrorantula does spawn in S Ro. All I have to say is good luck. He&#39;s<br/>\nbig enough to sit on 2 sand dunes by himself. And if he doesn&#39;t get you, the<br/>\nhordes of undead, madmen and orcs that usually mob you at this point might.<br/>\nBUT......... If you&#39;re high enough level or in a high level group, you could<br/>\nprobably take them.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\nHow has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\nShare your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
