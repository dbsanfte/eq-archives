And, I have seen it in use. It<br/>\ndisplays all zone info complete with mobs... mob<br/>\nnames... their level... their hit points... what they<br/>\nare carrying.... your amount of experience you are<br/>\ngetting for each kill.... your percentage of<br/>\nexperience towards your next level.. even PC&#39;s and<br/>\ntheir pets. You simply click on the mob you wish to<br/>\nattack and a line is drawn on the show EQ map from<br/>\nyour position to the mab and you simply folllow the<br/>\nline. They did have a Windows version available taht<br/>\nwould run in the background of Everquest. But,<br/>\neveryone was getting busted with it. And, you CAN get<br/>\nbusted with the Linux one too. My friend did. So use<br/>\nat your own risk.<br/>\n-Ken<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
