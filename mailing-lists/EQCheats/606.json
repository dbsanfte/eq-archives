I was on 108, and that was a<br/>\nreally great game.. but you are right, it got ruined.  I think when they<br/>\nmade the spell class changes, it really went downhill from there.  The older<br/>\nchars were mage/tanks, and newer players would never be as powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seekerslady@...\">seekerslady@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seekerslady@...\">seekerslady@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 28, 1999 6:12 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQCheats] Level times<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seekerslady@...\">seekerslady@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI used to play meridian 59. I loved this game but people got burned out on<br/>\nit becuase you could build too fast and then got bored. Then people went<br/>\naround and PKed each other. It turned a wonderful online community into a<br/>\ngarbage dump. What is your great hurry? You planning on leaving soon? As<br/>\nlong as you are having fun and meeting new people and playing a game you<br/>\nlike what difference does it make what level you are or how fast you get<br/>\nthere. These games are ment to be played for years not weeks. I am<br/>\nsurprised that people have already been able to max out. Now what do they<br/>\nhave to do? Ok they can go anywhere and kill almost anything but how long<br/>\nbefore they get bored and move on? The game has only been out a few months.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents<br/>\n<br/>\nFeather Dreamwalker of Rathe<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I agree that level gaining is quite slow. 8-10 hours<br/>\n&gt;for a level is a bit much. I can&#39;t imagine the high<br/>\n&gt;30s and above. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Belgarth <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you enter ONElist&#39;s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\nBy joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
