The way EQ is set up, any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; modifications you make are reflected in YOUR computer&#39;s memory,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and maybe even your display, but NOT on veran&#39;ts server. You<br/>\n&gt; &gt; FEED commands to Verant, the actions are resolved on the server,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and the RESULTS are sent back to you. You may modify the commands<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sent, or the results on your screen, and it won&#39;t change what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; happens to your character on verants servers at all. It is a great<br/>\n&gt; &gt; way to preclude tampering. You may change your screen to show<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 50000pp, but try to buy something.... The next screen update will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; show your real totals... Your character and all interaction with it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are done BY Verant on their own servers. You have NO real contact with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything that must be modified for any kind of cheat to work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; aye, the best you could do would be... stop/start the rain... change night<br/>\n/ day....<br/>\n&gt; and stuff like that. but no permanent changes in your character at all.<br/>\nMaybe, but<br/>\n&gt; just maybe you could get rid of root, blind and spells like that ... just<br/>\nintercept the<br/>\n&gt; server feed using some program to tunnel it and remove/add commands from<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; feed , the server would think you are rooted but since your EQ client<br/>\ndidnt recieve<br/>\n&gt; the command to root you it would let you move freely.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, there is one important thing that is handled completely on the<br/>\nclient side.  That is, where you are in the world.  (Proof, sit in a spot,<br/>\nunplug your ethernet cable from the back of your PC, run 1000 spaces,<br/>\nplug it back in, see that you&#39;re still there and not at the other place.)<br/>\nSo it should be possible to modify the X/Y/Z location in the client and<br/>\nhave that information passed on to the server...<br/>\n<br/>\nUses:<br/>\n1 key to the zone line.<br/>\nbypass guards and jump right to the rare spawn and then jump right out<br/>\nagain.<br/>\nPVP combat, randomly move 25 in each x/y direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\nFor details, including our weekly drawing, go to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
