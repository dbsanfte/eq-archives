No way they could send that much information over<br/>\n&gt;the &#39;net, isn&#39;t possible. So, the graphics have to be stored locally. You<br/>\n&gt;could write something to alter the packets as they come in to filter out<br/>\n&gt;certain graphics messages (blind, rain, nighttime, spell effects, etc), or<br/>\n&gt;you might be able to hack the graphics files themseleves and just take <br/>\n&gt;these<br/>\n&gt;affects out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;None of these bother me enough to want to wirte anything to filter packets<br/>\n&gt;though.... *chuckle*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: kale usi [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Friday, August 27, 1999 11:17 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [EQCheats] Is the verdict finally in?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;kale usi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Michael O&#39;Reilly &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michael@...\">michael@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I think not. I play EQ a lot from different computers. Things I have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;set up on each new computer are hotkeys, friends list, and ignore list.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;However, my character, equipment, bank balance, faction, current buffs,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and location remain the same.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;That indicates to me that all of the second list are on the server, not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the individual computer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Quite possibly true. I don&#39;t know for sure either way - in my opinion I<br/>\n&gt;agree with you. However, the main thing I&#39;m wondering at this point is -<br/>\n&gt;what applications could hacking the files stored client side have? It has <br/>\n&gt;me<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;on pins and needles. I hope that nothing major comes of this. I&#39;d hate like<br/>\n&gt;hell to see my hours of work earning items, cash, etc go down the tubes. <br/>\n&gt;Yet<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;on another aspect, I&#39;m intrigued. 8p<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations GENEVINCENT.
