Using their information i was able to complete the quest.  In the wood elf city on the same platform as the druid guildhall is a weapon shop, outside the shop, is a npc that if you hail him will tell you about kilij&#39;s plans and if you bring him the plans and three enchanted gold bars he will make a weapon.  The plans come from a sand giant in So Ro, hes not named but he is in the twenties instead of the thirties like most sand giants, about six weeks ago we killed him twice while killing sand giants in the span of about two hours and got plans both times. Get an enchanter to enchant three gold bars, give the npc the bars, dont stack them, and the plans, in return you recieve the Brazen Brass Kilij, magic, 10 damage, one handed slash, 35 delay wt 8.5, class warrior bard and rogue, race all.  Thanks to this list i was able to piece this together, hope some of you find this info usefull.<br/>\n <br/>\nGzaz Taintedtouch, innoruuks holy man, Rathe (had to posess the body of a young wood elf to complete the quest, did it with a level one warrior)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
