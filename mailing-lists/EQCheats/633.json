Think about the ppl you met and the good times you<br/>\nhad with some<br/>\nconversations, think what kind of person it&#39;s made you, and showen you ways<br/>\nto handle different<br/>\nsituations in life. Believe it or not, games are not just kill or be killed,<br/>\ntheir there for the<br/>\ncommunity of mortal man and woman, to learn and interact, teach each other<br/>\nnew things and new<br/>\nideas, share some culteral ideals that you might not have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of it this way, in those 400 hrs, you have reach out to more ppl in<br/>\nthat time, then you would<br/>\nin a life time, spending those hrs at something different. Unless of course<br/>\nyou were are actor or<br/>\nrock star.<br/>\n<br/>\nLifes fun, enjoy it for what you have of it, after all, you could die<br/>\ntomorrow, and I&#39;d like to<br/>\nknow i had fun in that time with ppl from all over the world, then sitting<br/>\non my chair or office,<br/>\nor such talking to one person, or myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThulgar<br/>\nGrand Master of the Mystical Knights<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.efni.com/~thulgar\">http://www.efni.com/~thulgar</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Lemac Justerian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Vegue, Tony     1047&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tonyv@...\">tonyv@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Good point -- a typical work year is 2080 hours.

I clocked about 400 hours since the game<br/>\n&gt; came<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out, in March.  I started the day it came out.

I guess we could watch the average 23 hours of TV per week like the<br/>\n&gt; rest of the country does... Hmmm... wait... that&#39;s MORE!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or, we could work an extra 20 hours a week??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don;t know about the rest of you, but I work to live, I do NOT live to<br/>\n&gt; work!  I live to have FUN because that is what *I* believe life is all<br/>\n&gt; about... Having a GOOD time, a GOOD life, and trying to help others do the<br/>\n&gt; same thing!
