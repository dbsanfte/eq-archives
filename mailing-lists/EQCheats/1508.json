Seems to me<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJourneyman Boots are NoDrop because they have infinite charges.... in Beta,<br/>\npeople would join a party and pass the boots around to everyone in the<br/>\nparty. Obviously in Final there would be chance of the jboots being stolen,<br/>\nbut this would still cause a major imbalance. So, they are NoDrop.<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message -----<br/>\n<br/>\n: From: &quot;Trevalien&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trevalien@...\">trevalien@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n:<br/>\n: How about gnoll fangs...these used to be dropable...if you didnt want em<br/>\nyou<br/>\n: tosed em on the ground or auctioned them away for a few silver each. Now,<br/>\n: even though you dont want them, some force poseses you to hold on to them.<br/>\n: The only way to get rid of them is by crusing them and uterly destroying<br/>\n: them. What was wrong with buying/trading gnoll fangs? It was a good way<br/>\nfor<br/>\n: you to raise qeynos faction. All you get is a moonstone worth a few silver<br/>\n: which you could turn in for a BB stout worth a silver or 2 more. Hardly<br/>\ngood<br/>\n: money after lvl 5!<br/>\n<br/>\nFangs are NoDrop because they are one of the few ways to gain faction with a<br/>\ncouple of groups, and it defeats the purpose of the faction system if a rich<br/>\nplayer can just buy them. You want faction, earn it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have Rubi pieces, sell them or trade them now... it will never be as<br/>\nvaluable again as it will be in the next few days. Except of course for the<br/>\nRubicite Breastplate, this thing is the Black Lotus of EQ, hang on to that<br/>\nfor a long time, you&#39;ll probably be able to trade it for a car in about six<br/>\nmonths :) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
