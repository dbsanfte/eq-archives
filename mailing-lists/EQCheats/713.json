(these are blue evokers to<br/>\nme, a 22 level shaman)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe preacher now has greater heal, and uses it on itself with reckless<br/>\nabandon.   Pretend you are killing the same gob five times over and you have<br/>\na pretty good idea of what it&#39;s like.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the four or so hours I was in perma, the preacher spawned twice (which is<br/>\nmuch less than it used to), the prelate never spawned, and the rest of the<br/>\nspawns were filled with evokers, priests, and reg. gobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first time we killed the preacher he had the RC, the second time he had<br/>\nthe morning star.   (Which I think is INCREDIBLY good luck, since I have<br/>\nkilled him about 20 times and this is the first time he&#39;s had the morning<br/>\nstar)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and just a quick note to you 40 level people who have never been in<br/>\npermafrost yet think you know everything -- the ALCHEMIST has the mammoth<br/>\narmor.   The ARCHEOLOGIST has the pack and the dented brass mask.   They<br/>\nDON&#39;T spawn in the same place!  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Laocoon, 22nd level Shaman of the Tribunal<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seekerslady@...\">seekerslady@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 02, 1999 2:40 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQCheats] Perma Frost<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seekerslady@...\">seekerslady@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have seen a few changes myself in perma. Things such as the preacher not<br/>\n&gt; having anything but money on him. Also I used to get chain and the odd<br/>\n&gt; piece of bronze from gobbies now I rarely get anything besides some cash.<br/>\n&gt; The arch and preacher do not spawn as often either. Also the preacher<br/>\nseems<br/>\n&gt; to spawn on a regular basis with a FS warhammer now and nothing else on<br/>\n&gt; him.
