That is, where you are in the world.  (Proof, sit in a spot,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unplug your ethernet cable from the back of your PC, run 1000 spaces,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; plug it back in, see that you&#39;re still there and not at the other place.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So it should be possible to modify the X/Y/Z location in the client and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have that information passed on to the server...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also believe what targeting happens only on client side. If client is<br/>\n&gt; notified about monster (update has been sent from server what such<br/>\n&gt; monster exists) you can target it without server check. Afaik targeting<br/>\n&gt; in EQ uses bounding boxes tracing, and im sure it is made by client, not<br/>\n&gt; server. So, because you can shoot your DDs through walls and monsters in<br/>\n&gt; most cases cannot move through walls, it can be ultimate cheating.<br/>\n&gt; Target any monster in dungeon on client, and nuke him from behind a wall<br/>\n&gt; without any opposition. Of course, server do not send ALL monsters in<br/>\n&gt; zone to client, so you dont know their IDs and cannot target them at<br/>\n&gt; all, but you possible can target any mob in ~30 meters radius.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now that would be a big exploit. Its the client who tells you if you can or cannot hit a mob<br/>\nso it might be possible to change the mobs position in client side only... like make them<br/>\nall appear just in your face (sure, only the ones you know the ID).. done that you can<br/>\ncast / hit them from far away...<br/>\n<br/>\nits even possible to tell you the mob distance... like when you /con a mob you get an extra<br/>\nmessage<br/>\nsaying the mob distance so you know if you can actually kill the mob before it even reach you or<br/>\nnot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont know if EQ have the mechanics (however its spelled) to avoid this kind of cheat...<br/>\nthey could send sanity checks asking/sending to the clients lots of stuff to avoid this kind<br/>\nof cheat but that would increase lag. Seems to me that Verant relies all their protection<br/>\n(against this kind of cheat) in dont allowing you to ALT-TAB, which is a good protection<br/>\nbut not the best... if you have anything running between you and the server as I mentioned<br/>\nbefore you really dont need to ALT-TAB. you can create your own commands that only<br/>\nyour program understand and do not send to the server... lemme see what could be done<br/>\neasily...<br/>\n<br/>\n/ultravision on/off<br/>\n/rain start/stop<br/>\n/sow on/off   -&gt; As someone mentioned before maybe the server dont have sanity checks<br/>\nto see if you are moving too fast... the server might trust the client too much in this aspect of<br/>\nthe game<br/>\n/levitate on/off<br/>\n/clipping on/off -&gt; it would allow you to move through walls just like quake<br/>\n/breath on/off -&gt; would let you breath underwater... did you EVER notice that the air indicator is<br/>\nNEVER<br/>\naffected by lag ? Maybe the server trust the client too much in this....<br/>\n/casting_time  seconds -&gt; this one would never work , the server is the one that control casting<br/>\ntime =)<br/>\n<br/>\nwell I could give examples forever... some of this wouldnt work but I BET some would work...<br/>\n<br/>\nagain, Verant rely most of their security dont allowing you to ALT-TAB, and they trust too much<br/>\nin EQ client =P<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT I can be completely wrong anyway =)<br/>\n<br/>\nI just think the game is too fun and no one is bored enough to start coding<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt; Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net goto www.everquest.com<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\n _____        _   _       _  _   _<br/>\n|  __ &#92;  ___ | &#92;_/ | ___ (_)| &#92; | | Jo�o Assad<br/>\n| |  &#92; |/ _ &#92;|  _  |/ _ &#92;| ||  &#92;| | Depto de Opera��es<br/>\n| |__/ | &lt;_&gt; | | | | &lt;_| | || |&#92;  | ------------------------<br/>\n|_____/ &#92;___/|_| |_|&#92;__,_|_||_| &#92;_| <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.domain.com.br\">http://www.domain.com.br</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
