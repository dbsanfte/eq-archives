We can get drunk!  But shouldn&#39;t a master brewer be <br/>\nable to make other items besides alchol?  Perhaps an invigoring tonic<br/>\nthat restores stamina faster, or a healthy potion that gives a short<br/>\nperiod of regeneration?  (We could use troll chunks for this... yuck!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBaking:  Why can&#39;t we have a soup that cures disease or poision?  The <br/>\npossibilites with baking are endless with a little creativity and some<br/>\neffort.<br/>\n<br/>\nPottery:  Where are the sketches to make molds for weapons and armor?<br/>\nMaybe a nice ceramic bow stave for the master fletcher around the way,<br/>\nor ceramic arrow shafts/vanes? <br/>\n<br/>\nSmithing:  Weapons, armor, etc...  Maybe allow the use of enchanted <br/>\nmetals for special armor and weapons.  Steel Bow Staves?  Steel arrow <br/>\nheads?  I&#39;d buy them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFletching:  Fix archery!  Why would anyone buy an arrow that has a long <br/>\nrange when archery is so F^&%&#39;d up, that it doesn&#39;t matter?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it is, the trade skills do not even come close to generating anything <br/>\nlike a player based economy.  Making the damn things usefull would<br/>\ndo wonders.  I doubt Verant will ever do wonders.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am presently in a suspended mode, evaluating if I should bother <br/>\nplaying again.  Seeing the effects of the patches, I doubt I will.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Micro Servo&#39;s no drop?  WTF!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWinvaras<br/>\nLv 20 Ranger<br/>\nMaster Brewer, Master Potter, Master Fletcher<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
