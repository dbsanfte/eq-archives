First of all, I don&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve that this &#39;Nick&#39; character has consulted a lawyer (at least not a<br/>\nGOOD one).  Secondly, even if he DID consult a lawyer, I paid for my own<br/>\neducation, thank you, and I believe he has given me permission to email him<br/>\nanytime I want to!<br/>\nThis incident (that all started with Nick&#39;s irrelevant comments about<br/>\ncamping, and his subsequent flaming of Rebecca have gotten WAY out of hand,<br/>\nand are taking up altogether too much of the bandwidth associated with this<br/>\nemail group.<br/>\nChuckle a little if you want....I have  :)<br/>\nBut, PLEASE, let&#39;s move on and talk about EQ!<br/>\nSean Clark<br/>\nPS: I am FACULTY at the university I have my email at, not a student :)<br/>\nHere&#39;s the message that nick sent me, in it&#39;s entirety:<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously I have a job or I would probably be a tweaker like you.  You say<br/>\njob like you have ever had one, when daddy stops your college payments then<br/>\nyou can email me and talk.  Until then this is your notice never to email me<br/>\nagain any further emails from you will require a 500 dollar proof reading<br/>\nfee, under penalty of law of course.  Thank you very much and have a nice<br/>\nday.<br/>\n<br/>\nN.H.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&gt;; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brutalny@...\">brutalny@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 02, 1999 5:14 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQCheats] Digest Number 79<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi Nick<br/>\n&gt; As you have probably already realized, your original comments are<br/>\ncompletely<br/>\n&gt; inappropriate for the list.
