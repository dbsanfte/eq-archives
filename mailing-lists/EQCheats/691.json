POTTERY<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Well to just confirm this, the wife and I bought, 16 boxes, filled them up<br/>\nwith 20 sketches in each box slot, filled 8 slots on character and in bank.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, as he was saying a total of 160 sketches per box *Boxes were cheaper<br/>\nthen backpacks*, 1280 sketches per 8 slots. 2560 sketches fer one full<br/>\ncharacter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, our TOTAL intention for this was to use these to make pottery, or<br/>\nwork pottery, just at alot better price. Load and behold when I figured this<br/>\nout yesturday morning, that it would be ALOT cheaper, and more beneficialy<br/>\nif we were to just SELL the dang things back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; for one sketch, we got 4 gp, 4sp, 2cp. Ya can imagine our amazement, when<br/>\nour brains started ticking, and calculating this. I first went ahead to sell<br/>\nmy wears, from one load of 8 boxes, I gained 556pp, so I went and sold the<br/>\nother group of boxes, totaling for 1100+ pp. Now this was NOT our intention<br/>\nto do this at all :( But, because of the price change, and because we<br/>\nstopped to think about it, we benefitted more from the patch, then we would<br/>\nhave say if we actually spent the money on clay, water, fireing sheets.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, that&#39;s confirmation if you wanted it about the patch, yes some ppl<br/>\nlucked out, but not everyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thulgar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; dlobdell wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;dlobdell&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dlobdell@...\">dlobdell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; +ACo-SNIP+ACo-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But hey, I&#39;m not bitchin&#39;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; +ACo-SNIP+ACo-<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Certainly sounds like you are to me +ADs-p<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wes Lobdell,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Quote: +ACI-I don&#39;t want to achieve immortality through my work.

How?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well.... those of us that used pottery often,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; especially the evil races, kept sketches in the bank.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I, for one, had 8 back packs full of sketches plus a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; back pack full on my character at the time I loggerd<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out teh night before the day of the last update. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; figured i could at least use what sketches I had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; saved up to make more pie-tins and thus a little more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; money. well... I log in after the update.... the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sketches I have that used to be purchased for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; silver and some odd coin sells for about a plat or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so... no big deal. BUT, I can sell my SKETCHES back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to a VENDOR for about 5 gold eac.... they used to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sell for like 8 copper back to a vendor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So... lets do some math here... thats 9 back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; packs.... each back pack has 160 sketches in it...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and each sketch sells for 5 gopld each. Hmmm.....<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have heard of some people that thought ahead and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had multiple characters with inventories and banks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; full of sketches that made ungodly sums of money<br/>\n&gt; &gt; after the last update.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; In effect.... Verant&#39;s attempt at fixing the game<br/>\n&gt; &gt; economy has effectively destroyed it for some people.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But hey, I&#39;m not bitchin&#39;. At least I didn&#39;t have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stand infront of a potttery wheel for hours on end to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make a lot of money.... and it didn&#39;t require me to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have any skill at all... hehe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Kenny<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist<br/>\nSponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Congratulations DALMATIANRESCUE.
