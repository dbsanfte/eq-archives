You seem to be saying that there is<br/>\na way to get the Dazed Goblin Knight to spawn quickly... but you don&#39;t tell<br/>\nus how to do it. Please elaborate. Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I agree with some of the recent posters, I think it is utter horseshit<br/>\nthe way rare item loots are handled in this game; forcing people to camp 18+<br/>\nhours to get an item is utter insanity. All the really cool stuff should<br/>\ncome from quests, anyway, not from just killing a mob.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Mark S.
