This includes when higher level characters train larger MOBs<br/>\nthrough newbie zones (including giants, spectres, cycs, and guards).  Now, a lot<br/>\nof the time, people fighting in these areas know (by way of previous death) that<br/>\nthese MOBs get trained regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere you were fighting there is nothing to harn newbies, so you weren&#39;t doing<br/>\nany harm, so I really don&#39;t have a problem with it.  However, any &quot;evil&quot; race<br/>\nhas few options for banking or going into a city where they are not KOS, your<br/>\n&quot;violation&quot; of their city is - in GMs mind - a justifiable excuse for training<br/>\nyou.  This goes both ways, I&#39;ve seen Dark Elves kill the wandering guards around<br/>\njust about every city- Greater Fay, FP, Karanas, Quenos, etc.  that have been<br/>\ntrained by &quot;good&quot; races.  Funniest site I ever saw was a level 8 or so High Elf<br/>\nCleric train the Wood Elf Ranger Guild Master to 2 DE necros killing guards- he<br/>\ncast Divine Aura on himself and jumped off the city platform and ran right to<br/>\nthese guys- twice.  Needless to say, he also dying in training the Ranger<br/>\nGuildmaster to them, but I&#39;ve never seen 2 level 35s die so quickly!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
