It is already<br/>\novercrowded with people (over 90 last night!) which makes the whole area<br/>\nslow down...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really a good place to get experience, yes... but a TERRIBLE place to<br/>\nget killed in (especially for a character that cannot bind right outside)<br/>\nwhich can happen often to lower levels (those under 15) from the many trains<br/>\nand long distance from the house to the zone.  Many times I have zoned into<br/>\nUnrest only to find about 10-20 (or more!) bodies in the tunnel from the<br/>\nzone to the house... It looks awful!  And many players have to travel all<br/>\nthe way from Kaladim or Kelethin to get back to their corpse which takes a<br/>\nlong time as well...<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\nProud member of Platinum Sphere Guild - www.platinumsphere.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Whitcraft,David &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DWHITCRAFT@...\">DWHITCRAFT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 21, 1999 9:04 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQCheats] Where to go at my level?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Whitcraft,David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DWHITCRAFT@...\">DWHITCRAFT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can go to Unrest now.

Ever since level 8 I&#39;ve been in Steamfront killing skeles and<br/>\n&gt; clockworks. Now everything con&#39;s green (except for mino&#39;s, and they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; usually heavily camped). Where should I be hunting now? Crushbone is way<br/>\ntoo<br/>\n&gt; overpopulated, on Tarew Marr at least. I just need somewhere to hunt until<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; hit 14 then I&#39;ll go to Unrest.
