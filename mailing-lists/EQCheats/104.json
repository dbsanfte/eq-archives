I know<br/>\nin N Ro i can kill bugs (scarabs and tarantulas) but they give shit for<br/>\nloot.  I have partied with a lvl 10 warrior and lvl 10 bard and kicked ass<br/>\nat derv camps, but it&#39;s too much work finding people willing to party to<br/>\nderv hunt.  I was wondering if there was anywhere that was REALLY easy to<br/>\nlvl at, or like a place where only Mummys spawn, that would work the best.<br/>\nI heard HighPass was good, but from others i heard it&#39;s for lvl 15-25<br/>\npeople.  I also heard Lake Rathe was the best, but I&#39;d have to party, and<br/>\nhardly any people are there.
