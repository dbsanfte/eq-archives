You are correct that a small group","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1242372275\">I&#39;m mostly a solo guy, and since Qeynos hills is a newbie zone, there <br/>\nusually isn&#39;t anyone 30+ to group with right there.  You are correct that a <br/>\nsmall group should have no problems taking him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one time that I killed Varsoon the necro he had nothing but a rusty <br/>\ndagger, so I&#39;m guessing that I was either unlucky, he is like Pyzjn and has <br/>\nat item that is only rare drop, or he is like the other low level necro that <br/>\nspawns in the zone that never drops anything except a rusty dagger.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I wasn&#39;t expecting the Varsoon the Undying when I killed Varsoon the <br/>\nnecro the first time, I wasn&#39;t ready for him, and I zoned at BB.  I kited <br/>\nhim pretty far so I didn&#39;t know he was a spellcaster, sounds like I lucked <br/>\nout big time. &lt;G&gt;  After I zoned back I found that someone else had trained <br/>\nhim to the guards, so no body, and no one found out what he drops (if <br/>\nanything).<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I&#39;m hearing a variety of levels, I&#39;m guessing that he is either a <br/>\nvariable level spawn or he is different levels on different servers (I&#39;ve <br/>\ncome across that before, was a big flame war on another list over two people <br/>\nwho were sure the same crit was a different level...)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Pyzjn drops is the Glowing Black Stone, it is held in off hand (might <br/>\nbe able to hold it in either hand, not sure) and grants +9 int and +10 sv <br/>\nmagic...used to be the best thing for a caster to hold in his off hand <br/>\nbefore the glowing stein quest went public.<br/>\n<br/>\nProblem is getting Pyzjn to spawn...I have seen him a total ot 2 times, and <br/>\nneither time did he have the damn rock.  I have heard he is on a 6 hour <br/>\nspawn, and Varsoon, Pyzjn, and one other low level necro that drops jack <br/>\nmight spawn every 6 hours.  Rumor only though.  Also, the damn rock is damn <br/>\nrare, about the same as getting Drez to drop jboots....about a 10% chance <br/>\nevery time he spawns &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people hear about the cool item, go the qeynos hills for a weekend, <br/>\nnever even see the bastard, and give up in disgust.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m heading back there to replenish my stock of bat wings, so maybe I&#39;ll see <br/>\none of them and have more info later.  I&#39;ll keep you posted if I come across <br/>\nanyting interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Ma`ar, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Get a caster buddy then root and shoot then...or just leave him alone. What<br/>\n&gt;do the pair of them drop? And what does Pyzgin drop? Shimmering Orb or<br/>\n&gt;something wierd for mage types (I be a shaman, so have no interest in it).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Jared Hughes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaredh@...\">jaredh@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Thursday, September 09, 1999 4:36 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [EQCheats] Digest Number 125<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Jared Hughes&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaredh@...\">jaredh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kiting him is next to impossible, he casts the necro line of darkness <br/>\n&gt;spells<br/>\n&gt;on you, which makes you feel like you are creeping, and i had jboots and it<br/>\n&gt;was like i was 180/65 overweight. can&#39;t kite under those conditions<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Veldra Rae`lynn<br/>\n&gt;lvl 32 magician<br/>\n&gt;Veeshan </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
