The result of the<br/>\n&gt;quest is the Shinging Star of Light (a mace 6 28 that cast clense).  You<br/>\n&gt;must have high faction with the Priest of Life to do this quest, which is a<br/>\n&gt;pain cause there is only a few things you can do to raise the faction.  The<br/>\n&gt;mace itself is worth around 20 pp or so and involves some running around<br/>\n&gt;between WK and Qeynos.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Honeycombs are found off of Bixies and Bixie Drones.
