I usually drop in there<br/>\nwith my druid to pick up a ton of fish scales (for underwater breathing) and<br/>\ncat&#39;s eye agate (for my pure casting friends who need it for shielding<br/>\nspells).  I honestly have found every regeant anyone has ever needed in that<br/>\nplace!<br/>\n<br/>\nMoney at earlier levels is always a little tough to get.  Once you hit about<br/>\n20-25, the mobs you&#39;re fighting will start to drop plat on a regular basis.<br/>\nI think one of the richest mobs in the game has to be Hill Giants so far,<br/>\nusually carrying between 10 and 70 plat (which auto-splits nicely in a big<br/>\ngroup).  Now I am sure Vox and Nagafen might be loaded too, but they are<br/>\nusually bursting with really cool weapons and other rare items. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n-CC (aka Haukha, 35th level Halfling Druid, Veeshan)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
