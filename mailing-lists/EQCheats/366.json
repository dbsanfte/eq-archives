The stats look pretty reasonable (not quite<br/>\n&gt; like a Shiny Hally, but I REALLY want to stick with the axes!).  I<br/>\n&gt; understand it is a quest for evil characters, but how is the quest<br/>\n&gt; initiated?  What is involved?  How much are these weapons selling for?  I<br/>\n&gt; was figuring around 100 plat...a little under what the Hally is selling for<br/>\n&gt; &#39;cause it lacks the damage of the Hally.<br/>\n&gt; Also, I was thinkin about heading up to High Hold and was wondering what lvl<br/>\n&gt; you would need to be to get a Tomahawk or a Halberd...any feedback??<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; Thoradin of Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; Paladin of Brell<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net goto www.everquest.com </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
