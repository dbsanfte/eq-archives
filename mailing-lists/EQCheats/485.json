If you are going into a battle with something that has a really<br/>\nnasty condition (like when fighting necros or crits that charm) Get a<br/>\nShaman load a bunch of buffs on you.  Then you will not be bothered by<br/>\nthe harmful stuff.  You can try this yourself.  I am a lvl 24 Shaman so<br/>\nI cast all my buffs and filled all the slots up(5 stat buffs, 5<br/>\nresistance buffs, 2 sight buffs, my ac/hp buff, my ac only buff and SoW)<br/>\nThen I cast Envenomed Breath on myself.  I didn&#39;t get the usual resist<br/>\nmessage, but I didn&#39;t take damage and I didn&#39;t get the poison icon.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
