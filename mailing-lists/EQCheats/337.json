I have given a whole bunch of necklaces to the<br/>\n&gt;Sheriff in Riverdale, a lot of belts to Deputy Budo, and killed a<br/>\n&gt;crapload of goblins.  The deputies consider me warmly...How can I tell<br/>\n&gt;how much longer it will take me before I get the ring? Ive also killed<br/>\n&gt;Mooto quite a few times.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, there is a NPC in Riverdale named Silna Stormsmith(sp?)...She goes<br/>\n&gt;on about delivering messages to Freeport but I cannot get her to give me<br/>\n&gt;the quest..Is the quest worth it?  How do I go about getting it?  If you<br/>\n&gt;are coming out of Misty Thicket, Silna spawns down the hallway to the<br/>\n&gt;left, next to that bench where deputies stand.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, any tips on doing the Nillipuss quest would be helpful...What<br/>\n&gt;level do I have to be to kill him?  How long does it take him to spawn?<br/>\n&gt;Where does he spawn?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would appreciate help on the Squad Ring quest the most...It is really<br/>\n&gt;ticking me off that the stupid sherrif will not give me the ring...Once<br/>\n&gt;I finally do get the ring, can I get it recharged or do I have to go get<br/>\n&gt;a new one?  If I can get it recharged, how do I do it?  Im a level 16<br/>\n&gt;monk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Grimlin<br/>\n&gt;Bristlebane server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How many communities do you think join ONElist each week?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;More than 5,000!
