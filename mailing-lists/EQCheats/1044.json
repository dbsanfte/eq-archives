That is, where you are in the world.  (Proof, sit in a spot,<br/>\n&gt; unplug your ethernet cable from the back of your PC, run 1000 spaces,<br/>\n&gt; plug it back in, see that you&#39;re still there and not at the other place.)<br/>\n&gt; So it should be possible to modify the X/Y/Z location in the client and<br/>\n&gt; have that information passed on to the server...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I also believe what targeting happens only on client side. If client is<br/>\nnotified about monster (update has been sent from server what such<br/>\nmonster exists) you can target it without server check. Afaik targeting<br/>\nin EQ uses bounding boxes tracing, and im sure it is made by client, not<br/>\nserver. So, because you can shoot your DDs through walls and monsters in<br/>\nmost cases cannot move through walls, it can be ultimate cheating.<br/>\nTarget any monster in dungeon on client, and nuke him from behind a wall<br/>\nwithout any opposition. Of course, server do not send ALL monsters in<br/>\nzone to client, so you dont know their IDs and cannot target them at<br/>\nall, but you possible can target any mob in ~30 meters radius.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
