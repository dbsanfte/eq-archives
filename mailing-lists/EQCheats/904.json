One other thought, the world needs to expand.<br/>\nFor instance, there is befallen, an excellent dungeon for level 9or10-20+.<br/>\nIt contains some unique items, the most notable one being the BBC.  In my<br/>\nexperience, it takes several hours for the SK to spawn at times, or atleast<br/>\n45 mins to an hour.  Not very often does it carry the BBC.  Me and my<br/>\nfriends (16-20) can take this shadowknight and everything that comes with<br/>\nit.  However, all that has to happen is for a high level wiz to sit there,<br/>\nwait for the sk to spawn with sword in hand...hell, last night a 20<br/>\nsomething CLERIC stole it from us..::Sigh::<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t insult my intelligence.  If I, or my group, is tough enough to take<br/>\nmonster x, which carries z, let the z be there, so we can leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nDameat<br/>\nHead Lush - Drun&#39;Ken Nation<br/>\nRodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n             Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\nGamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n        <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
