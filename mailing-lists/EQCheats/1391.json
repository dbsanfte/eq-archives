We were overkill for everything, even the<br/>\nking is blue to me. The only problem was the Level 20<br/>\nPaladin was causing trains due to his low level. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are a 32 shaman (not sure if you mean you, and<br/>\na 32 Shaman) I would bring a Ranger/Paladin/Warrior/SK<br/>\nto do the main tanking. You will more than likely get<br/>\njumped by a few elite goblin guards which could get<br/>\nrough. Especially if you get Borxx, you want to<br/>\ninterrupt his casting, which a ranger or warrior can<br/>\ndo well with dual wield/double attack and decent<br/>\nweapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\n<br/>\nBelgarth<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Whitcraft,David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DWHITCRAFT@...\">DWHITCRAFT@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Whitcraft,David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DWHITCRAFT@...\">DWHITCRAFT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, I heard he (Borxx) spawns in the King&#39;s Room.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll be going with<br/>\n&gt; (atleast) myself (32 Shaman) plus a druid friend (29<br/>\n&gt; Druid), and will nuke<br/>\n&gt; his ass off when he spawns if possible. That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; assuming someone is camping<br/>\n&gt; the kings room.... If not, well...I&#39;ll have to bring<br/>\n&gt; some friends. Might<br/>\n&gt; have to pull a higher level friend or two....hrm....<br/>\n&gt; Camping the King&#39;s room<br/>\n&gt; could be fun though for a higher level group.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone camped this room before? Know what kind of<br/>\n&gt; group it would take to<br/>\n&gt; camp sucessfully and control it? right now, my group<br/>\n&gt; has been camping the<br/>\n&gt; King&#39;s room in Perma and controling it well (&#39;cept<br/>\n&gt; when the pull goes bad<br/>\n&gt; for the higher levelers and 3-5 Ice Giants come<br/>\n&gt; charging into the<br/>\n&gt; room.....ouch....*chuckle*). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
