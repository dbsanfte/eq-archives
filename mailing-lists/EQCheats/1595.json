What i mean is a merchant that sells unlimited supply of<br/>\n&gt; RAW <br/>\n&gt; HIDE (not leather) armor. I know he exists, because i saw it once a long<br/>\n&gt; time <br/>\n&gt; ago, but for the life of me cannot remember. Please help!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure about a merchant that sells raw hide.  I have never seen one,<br/>\nbut I know where you can get great amounts at if your willing to kill some<br/>\nzombies.  Go to eruds island (The one with the wisps) and go to the sunken<br/>\nship on the island.  By the ship (underwater) 3 zombies spawn.  They drop<br/>\nZombie Skins and Raw hide common, and rarely drop Bronze weapons.  But the<br/>\ngood part is they spawn fast and usually by the time you clean up the 3&#39;rd<br/>\nzombie the 1&#39;st one has spawned again.  Probably with about 30mins to an<br/>\nhour of camping you may be able to have a complete suit of raw hide.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeres a tip for pulling the zombies.  If your a caster of anysort with a<br/>\nlull type of spell you can easily pull them with no worries.  You can wade<br/>\ninto the water just enough where you can see CLEARLY all the way to the ship<br/>\nwithout actually being considered swimming.  It&#39;s not hard to do.  just keep<br/>\ntaking small steps forward until the ship comes into plain view.  You know<br/>\nyou&#39;ve done this wrong if you see your breath meter pop up.  Once you waded<br/>\nin just enough to see all 3 zombies clearly you can lull 2 and pull one<br/>\nwithout having to worry about outswimming them since you&#39;ll basically be on<br/>\nland anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your a druid and want the best leather armor I recommend just buying some<br/>\nreinforced leather from a tailor.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
