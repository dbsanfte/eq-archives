My plan is to put two network cards on and linux on it. Have<br/>\nthe network traffic go through the first computer, then to my game computer.<br/>\nThen I can do all the packet sniffing I want without bothering the game<br/>\nclient. I was thinking about making a little client on the linux box with<br/>\nvector graphics showing your position and the position of all local mobs.<br/>\nLike a radar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to make a better messaging system. Like check every so often<br/>\nyour friends list to see when friends are on. And display which friends are<br/>\non line. And have seperate friends lists for each server.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I think would be cool would be to make bots. I was thinking a<br/>\nhealbot would be pretty easy. To activate you do a &quot;/m healbot join&quot;.<br/>\nHealbot would then join your party. His sole job would be to cast heal<br/>\nspells on the members of the party. I imagine I could get a lot of exp while<br/>\nat work. :) I was think he would be gnomish clockwork so that he could even<br/>\nbe in character. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately I have a job and do not found the time to do any of this yet.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
