Not much in the middle of<br/>\nthat. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the BIBS, sorry, not sure. I *think* it&#39;s on the goblin chieftain<br/>\no king, whatever, but, really, I&#39;m making that up.

I know its in<br/>\nRunneyeye, but was looking for more specifics on the location, the MOB that<br/>\ncarries it, group lvl needed to get to / obtain the sword, etc, etc.  I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t spent much time in Runneyeye...is it a good mid-level dungeon?  it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem very crowded..which would be a NICE change after spending the<br/>\nlast week in Unrest!<br/>\nAlso, for those of you wise in the way of Runneyeye...what MOBs drop the<br/>\nBlackened Iron armor pieces?  I know the AC isn&#39;t great, and it weighs a<br/>\nlot, but it looks very cool and I bet there is a market out there for that<br/>\n&#39;look&#39;.<br/>\nThanks in advance for your help!!<br/>\nThoradin of Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Best Place to Buy Movies - Reel.com<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
