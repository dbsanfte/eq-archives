The house has 4 floors and a basement.  It can<br/>\n&gt; be confusing, so have a cleric invis you to undead and explore a bit.<br/>\n&gt; be ready to run though.  trains build fairly quick as all undead KOS<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; are quick to help out their buddies.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Levels 14-16 can safely kill the yard trash(death beetles, Tormented<br/>\n&gt; dead, Jack-o-lanterns)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Levels 17-20 should pull from the first and second floors of the<br/>\n&gt; house(Ghouls, Dry bone skels, lurking mummies)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Levels 21-24 can safely camp a room on the third floor(Lots of skel<br/>\n&gt; types, Carrion ghouls, specials)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Levels 24-30 can take the knight room on the 4th floor(Undead knight,<br/>\n&gt; festering hags, greater dark bone)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Levels 30+ can begin to camp in the basement(Ghost, dark terrors,<br/>\n&gt; mortuary fungus, lots of other nasties I don&#39;t want to mess with)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as items, there are several items of interest to come out of<br/>\n&gt; Unrest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lesser loot <br/>\n&gt; FS weapons - Carrion ghouls<br/>\n&gt; Small ringmail - Carrion ghouls, barbed bone skels<br/>\n&gt; Small bronze plate - Dry bone skels<br/>\n&gt; Assorted gemstones - various<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Major loot\t\tMob\t\t\t\tAuction Price <br/>\n&gt; Dwarven Workboots \tDwarven ghost  \t\t\t800pp+<br/>\n&gt; Jagged bands \t\tDwarven ghost  \t\t\t200pp<br/>\n&gt; Bloodstained Tunic \tKnight of Unrest(rare drop) \t400pp+<br/>\n&gt; Bloodstained Mantle \tKnight of Unrest\t\t\t80pp<br/>\n&gt; Ivory Bracelet \t\tReanimated hand \t\t100pp+<br/>\n&gt; bloodstained gloves \tReclusive Ghoul Magi(rare drop) \t75+pp<br/>\n&gt; Savant&#39;s Cap \t\tReclusive Ghoul Magi \t\t30pp<br/>\n&gt; Thick leather apron \tUndead barkeep \t\t25pp<br/>\n&gt; Opalline Earrings\tUndead barkeep \t\t25pp<br/>\n&gt; Gladius \t\tNot sure on this one \t\t<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
