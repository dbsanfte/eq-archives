Just FYI for the rest of you.. in HackersQuest&#39;s FAQ they <br/>\ngive you directions on how to modify the tutorial, and a link to a hex <br/>\neditor that you need to do it.  Or, if you want to do it the easy way, they <br/>\nalso have a link for a program that does it all for you.  I suggest copying <br/>\nthe tutorial and renaming it so you can keep the original if you mess it up <br/>\nsomehow, tho if you&#39;re paying attention it really isn&#39;t tough to do.
