It is slow, but they always <br/>\nspawn at temple or pyramid all the time. Without fail, and if you go later at <br/>\nnight when there is not a lot of people, you could gain a lot. Also killing <br/>\nthe occasional lesser mummy or zombie helps as well. Doesn&#39;t seem like much <br/>\nloot, but after sitting there and killing for a long time you acrue a large <br/>\namount of silver and copper which gets to be a lot. The highest that I <br/>\nremember getting is about 350 copper and 150 silver. Not bad, plus I am a <br/>\nnecromancer and I have over 75 bone chips to use. Just a suggestion and if <br/>\nyou are not evil, the guards could kill you on site. I would only try this <br/>\nwhen you are level 8 or above for a necromancer. Not sure about any other <br/>\nclass.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
