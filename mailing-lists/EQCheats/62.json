In order for someone to bind you, two conditions<br/>\n &gt; must be met. First and foremost, they have to be in your party. Being in<br/>\n &gt; your party means you trust them (or that you are a frickin idiot to join<br/>\n &gt; their party without knowing them) and give consent. The second condition<br/>\n &gt; is that a spellcaster can only bind people in city areas (Highhold Pass<br/>\n &gt; is considered a city however).<br/>\n &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your free web-based email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xoom.com\">http://www.xoom.com</a><br/>\nBirthday?
