All vital data flow through protocol and it is much easier &gt;to <br/>\n&gt;decode than program itself. But protocol can be crypted, and &gt;impossible to <br/>\n&gt;decode at all..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not entirely true. Being ex-military, and being an ex-intelligence type, and <br/>\nhaving been trained/shown how to do it, cracking network protocol and <br/>\nnetwork protocol encryption is not as hard as you think it is. But don&#39;t get <br/>\nme wrong. It&#39;s not something that you can just hop on a computer and learn <br/>\novernight or in just a few hours. You have to know what you&#39;re looking for, <br/>\nand then, just maybe then, you can figure it out on your own. It would take <br/>\nmonths, or possibly even years to learn how on your own.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
