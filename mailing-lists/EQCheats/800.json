You can have emails BLOCKED you know.  Now, I don&#39;t know what that person wrote to you,  But there&#39;s nothing really a court can do about this.  I know. I work for a ISP, and just about all you can do is get there account terminated from that ISP.  Now if I was getting crap mail like that.

As per my lawyers request I had warned him before not to email me or a proof reading fee would be exempted to his university/his parents.  He sent me an email this morning that was lengthy and I didn&#39;t even bother reading it.  Again (to the people of the list), do not send me private emails.  Mr. Clark is going to have to go to small claims court because of his actions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
