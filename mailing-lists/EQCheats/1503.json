None of those are on mobs that are unique and take forever to spawn.<br/>\nLots of Avocets, Patriach and High shaman spawn quite a bit, Trazdon doesn&#39;t<br/>\ntake hour and hours to spawn, etc. Gypsies are a BITCH, but oh well...heh.<br/>\nPeople still seems to be geting BPs. <br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine the items needed for the quests will mostly be NODROP, but the<br/>\narmor itself will not. Crafted was a pilot for this (prolly the first one<br/>\nthey got completely done so decided to throw it out to see how it went, plus<br/>\nWarriors NEEDED some assistance...). I think they did VERY good on the<br/>\ncrafted quests (&#39;cept for those stupid guantlets, that was insane...)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:srutkowski@...\">srutkowski@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:srutkowski@...\">srutkowski@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: October 11, 1999 2:54 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQCheats] New Quest Items<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:srutkowski@...\">srutkowski@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure that all classes will have new armor in the game.  While not<br/>\nall<br/>\nof it will come from quests in the Temple of Solusek Ro, most of the armor<br/>\nwill.<br/>\nThere will be SK armor, it has a black plate apperance (nice), ranger is<br/>\ngreen<br/>\nchain, cleric gold plate, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe possible problem that may arise, if the do these quests like they<br/>\n&quot;fixed&quot;<br/>\nseveral of the other quests, is that if ANY of these quests rely on one<br/>\nstatic<br/>\nspawn that you have to kill.  Often times these spawns are 6-8 hours apart,<br/>\nare<br/>\nheavily camped, etc.  Anyone seen how badly Befallen and Kerra Isle are<br/>\ncamped<br/>\n(almost 24/7) now that the Paw of Opella information has become known?  The<br/>\nTestiment is even worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf these quests require one static spawn that has the necessary item rare or<br/>\na<br/>\nlong spawn time, it&#39;s another useless quest IMO.  I would much rather<br/>\ncontinue<br/>\nto get experience and fight in places that are challenging, instead of<br/>\nsitting<br/>\non a static spawn for hours to get an item.  I&#39;d love to have the best<br/>\nequipment<br/>\nin the game, but not at the expense of my enjoyment.  I have a hard enough<br/>\ntime<br/>\nto put 3-4 hours together on a week night, let alone some of the 16 hours<br/>\npeople<br/>\nhave camped for the rings from Mitty (Paw quest).  My worst horror story is<br/>\n12<br/>\nhours for JBoot, but at least I was getting experience at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf camping is what is required (even though it&#39;s now a &quot;quest&quot;), I really<br/>\ndon&#39;t<br/>\nsee this as any improvement to the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully this will not be the case with these new quests.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet paid to surf the web!
