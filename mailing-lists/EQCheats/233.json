Word has it<br/>\nthat brad also plays a &#39;real&#39; ranger character that he actually<br/>\nPLAYS...getting his own equipment, having to earn his own experience.<br/>\nAll the whining about Brad shouldn&#39;t THIS and Brad shouldn&#39;t THAT is a bunch<br/>\nof BS.<br/>\nBrad spent the last three or four YEARS of his life working on this game!<br/>\n(For all of you that aren&#39;t QUITE sure....that&#39;s REAL LIFE years!!!   :)<br/>\nIf any of you spent 3-4 years of your life working to develop a product, are<br/>\nyou saying you wouldn&#39;t take advantage of USING that product?  PLEASE!!!<br/>\nIf Brad wants to go kill a WAY high level NPC, or slay a dragon, don&#39;t ya<br/>\nthink he&#39;s EARNED that right?  We wouldn&#39;t even be having this discussion if<br/>\nit weren&#39;t for Brad&#39;s dedication to this GAME (please try and remember that<br/>\nit a game!!).<br/>\nThere has been SO much stuff (magic equipment, quests, skill and magic<br/>\ntweaks) added to the game in the last couple of weeks, and all you guys can<br/>\nargue about is why the Avenger is Paladin Only?  I play a bunch of different<br/>\ncharacters, and I love playin them ALL.  I know I could get to the upper<br/>\nlevels faster if I just stuck to one character, but I&#39;m having FUN.<br/>\nMy suggestion is this: if its FUN for you to argue about why Brad&#39;s lvl 50<br/>\nRanger can use a Paladin-Only Fiery Avenger, than go ahead and argue.  But<br/>\nif you like the world that Brad created, than cut the guy a little slack -<br/>\nAND GO PLAY THE GAME!!!<br/>\nThoradin of Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: kurt walther [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:itzkurt@...\">itzkurt@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 27, 1999 11:42 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQCheats] Digest Number 36<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: kurt walther &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:itzkurt@...\">itzkurt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust so yall know..  Aradune is not decked out as he was in beta.  BETA<br/>\nwas just that.. BETA.  In release, he&#39;s just as watched as the rest of<br/>\nus.  He has to earn everything just like the rest of us.  He may be high<br/>\nlvl (i don&#39;t know) but i assure you he&#39;s not packin anything he didn&#39;t<br/>\nearn.  As for the green splinted platemail..  I talked to a lvl 48<br/>\ncleric and he said his group still had a couple levels to go before they<br/>\ncould make a run at getting some of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking for a new hobby?
