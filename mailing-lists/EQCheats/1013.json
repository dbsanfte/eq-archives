I was told that there was some sort of quest which gives<br/>\n&gt; INSANE experience and that it was being heavily exploited.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone know what this is?  I may want to try a stuntie, and any leg up<br/>\n&gt; is sure a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a quest that was taken out of atleast one server due to<br/>\nexploitation where you were given an item by someone in the halfling town to<br/>\ngive to a guard who wanders from point A to B and then dissapears once per<br/>\ngame day.  What someone did is attacked the guard and ran to the person who<br/>\ngave the quest, and then died.  Someone standing next to the person who gave<br/>\nthe quest would then hail the guard locking him in place.  You then could<br/>\nreceive the quest, and give the item to the guard gaining xp and faction.<br/>\nPeople went from first to 12th level like this in a matter of hours before<br/>\nbeing banned.  It&#39;s possible though unlikely this quest (Or any quest like<br/>\nit) is still in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Doug </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
