Can anyone charge a proofreading fee?<br/>\nWhat exactly is it? I guess I&#39;ve been out of the scaming business too long<br/>\n+AD4AOw-).+AD4APgA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is how my lawyer put it to me.  If someone sends you unsolicited email<br/>\nonce it is fine, but if you warn them after that email saying the following<br/>\nor close to it +ACI-any further emails to this address will cost a certain<br/>\namount of money to proofread+ACI- it is legally binding.  If the person does not<br/>\nmake a payment within 3 months you can take them to small claims court and<br/>\ncharge interest on your time and work.  When you warn them, and they send<br/>\nyou another email just correct it and send it back to them.  Afterwards<br/>\nstart litigation.  This is an excellent way to stop hate/spam/annoying<br/>\nemails.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways+ACE-<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAre you?
