Infact, Any rumors of there being a reset point in the room is <br/>\ntotally wrong. The key point to getting the BBC is to keep the room clear at <br/>\nALL times. I ran in the room to make sure no spawns were hiding and it never <br/>\neffected the spawn. We were there to obtain 2 Bone Bladed Claymores. Within <br/>\n4 to 4 and a half hours the SK spawned 3 times. Each time he carried the BBC <br/>\nwith him. We had to wait for the third becuase the second spawn was stolen <br/>\nunder our noses. We walked out frustrated and tired, the people there can be <br/>\njerks, but with satisfaction that we obtained through battle the sword of <br/>\npower and not through money. Good luck to all who try to camp him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdol , 16th Level Paladin of Freeport<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Jason Harrell&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jharrell@...\">jharrell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQCheats] Question for Befallen Buffs<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 1 Jul 1999 03:50:53 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Jason Harrell&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jharrell@...\">jharrell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What&#39;s the blackened wand for?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Sandeep Shekar [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sandeep@...\">sandeep@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, June 30, 1999 11:22 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQCheats] Question for Befallen Buffs<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Sandeep Shekar &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sandeep@...\">sandeep@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;We went down in hopes of getting a BBC for our Pally last night.  We were<br/>\n&gt; &gt;there for two hours or so, and never saw the SK.  We were told that there<br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a &quot;spawn line&quot;, ie, don&#39;t cross it or the SK will not spawn.  Is this the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;case?  If so, is that line at the end of the tunnel?  Or inside the room?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;It was fairly frustrating.  Also, there was another group there camping <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the Robes, and I never saw that Theor..they...whatever guy that is <br/>\n&gt;supposed<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to drop the robes.  Does the same thing apply for him?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I spent about 3 days in Befallen and my parties got a total of 5 BBCs, 3<br/>\n&gt;Thaum robes and 2 Gossamier robes, countless daggers of Marknek, and not a<br/>\n&gt;single blackened wand (the item I was looking for).  There is NO spawn line<br/>\n&gt;or any kind of anti camp radius on ANY of the mobs in befallen.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt;standing next to mobs when they spawned with the aforementioned items.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Lastly..how often would you say the SK would normally spawn?  Every 1/2<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hour?  Hour?  2 hours?  I probably will not return to Befallen, unless it<br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with my Paladin with the objective of getting that BBC for him....so the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;info would be appreciated.  That place is just swarming with DE&#39;s, and it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;makes my dwarven skin crawl.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yeah, I hate the place too.  The spawn time in Befallen is about 20<br/>\n&gt;minutes, and the SK spawns about 25% of the time.  About 33% of the time<br/>\n&gt;that he spawns, he has a BBC.  So I guess if you are looking for a BBC,<br/>\n&gt;plan on being there for 3-4 hours or so.  I hate camping, so I&#39;d just run<br/>\n&gt;the entire 3rd floor - Thaum room,  Darkelf SK, and Troll SK.  We still<br/>\n&gt;ended up at the start of the spawn cycle before the 20 minutes was up.  I<br/>\n&gt;hate this dungeon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sandeep Shekar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
