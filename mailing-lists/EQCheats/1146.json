Williams&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Williams@...\">John_Williams@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was wondering if anyone could tell me why this happened and how to avoid<br/>\n&gt; it in the future.<br/>\n&gt; I was hunting the little undead camp in south karana right by the zone. I<br/>\n&gt; got killed by lord<br/>\n&gt; Grimrot, the only problem I have is that I never even saw him. He cast a<br/>\n&gt; spell on me and killed<br/>\n&gt; Me in one shot. I liked the area but would just like to be able to avoid<br/>\n&gt; grimrot, anyone know<br/>\n&gt; To avoid him?<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt; John<br/>\n<br/>\nLord Grimrot is a rare spawn and also spawns in two incarnations.  The Human<br/>\nShadowknight (What you saw) is L35 and usually carrys the Opaline Scythe (No<br/>\ndrop SK/Warrior only weapon.)  Or sometimes he spawns in a lower level<br/>\n(L25?) skeleton form.  In either case when he spawns shout that he&#39;s out and<br/>\nsee if someone wants to kill him, then wait 24 norrathian hours.  After that<br/>\ntime if he isn&#39;t dead he will de-spawn.  BTW: One reason I&#39;ve been so quiet<br/>\nlately is I&#39;ve been massivly twinking a new character.  Also the reason I<br/>\nknow about the above information (Particuarlly the de-spawn.)  I have 3<br/>\ncomputers capable of playing eq next to eachother, and on one I have a<br/>\nfriends L39 druid, on the other my newbie.  Walk into the skel fields at L8,<br/>\nput Skin like diamonds, shield of spikes on the newbie, have him trigger all<br/>\nthe putrids, and watch them kill thesmelves on<br/>\nthe damage shield.  Only two things need to watch out for.  First is healnig<br/>\nof course.  Second is, you don&#39;t get exp for a monster unless you damage it<br/>\nfirst.  So if something dies on just the shield, no xp.  So either cast an<br/>\nAoE, or make sure to target what&#39;s hitting you and melee it once in turn.<br/>\nAnother interesting thing I learned is unless you piss them off, only 3<br/>\nmonsters will attack you at once.  Using the above methods, I&#39;ve raised from<br/>\n1 to 20 in maybe 22 hours of real playing time.  Knwoing what I know now, I<br/>\ncould do it even faster.  (I experimented for an hour or two at places that<br/>\ndidn&#39;t pay off.)  The bigest downside is that right now I&#39;m spending about 3<br/>\nhours raising spell skills that i never used.  Try explaining to people why<br/>\ntheir cleric can&#39;t cast SPirit Armour because they only have a 20<br/>\nAbjuration! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
