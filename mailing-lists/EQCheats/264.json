No one takes the time to actually build a database of<br/>\nstuff most rely on volunteer submissions wh8ich sucks because you dont get a<br/>\ngood response that way.

Currently I am<br/>\ndeveloping a site for EQ dedicated strictly to the items, how to get them,<br/>\nand buy/sell them (in game only of course).  I&#39;m not interested in the<br/>\nstandard Leather Arms, etc. There are plenty of sites out there that deal<br/>\nwith this. I *am* interested in anything out of the ordinary, where it came<br/>\nfrom and the quest associated with it. This is a full-on spoiler option,<br/>\nwhich I have no personal problem with, and if you&#39;re subscribed to this list<br/>\nneither should you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I ask is 3 quick things for submissions: a screen shot displaying the<br/>\nitem and the stats on it, a brief description of how you came across it, and<br/>\nthe quest information associated. The second two are optional since even I<br/>\nhate campers, but they&#39;d really help those of us who go get the item, then<br/>\nleave the spawn to the others to do the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nA. Would EQ players go to this site?<br/>\nB. Is this a good idea?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone wishing to help out will get credit on the site for the submissions<br/>\n(of course).<br/>\n<br/>\nE-mail any submissions to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trajen@...\">trajen@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all!<br/>\n<br/>\nTrajen D&#39;Fraust<br/>\nBarbarian Shaman<br/>\nLord of the Divinity, Order of Deus Vult<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out this week&#39;s ONElist of the week.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nHow is ONElist changing YOUR life?
