I tracked a Lt in North Karana once, and went out<br/>\nto find him since I had never seen the name before.  He was green to me in<br/>\nthe low 30&#39;s.  He was just a little northwest of the wooden bridge, just<br/>\nstanding out in the meadow.  He didn&#39;t respond when I hailed him, and he<br/>\nsoon started walking west.  The fact that he was on my tracking list<br/>\nindicates that he probably had just recently spawned (anyone who knows how<br/>\ntracking for over 30 rangers works will understand), so unless he spawns in<br/>\na random spot, I&#39;d look for him there.  I didn&#39;t kill him, since he conned<br/>\namiably to me (and I&#39;m a good little ranger :).  Hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nTelon on E&#39;ci<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TSandrich@...\">TSandrich@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TSandrich@...\">TSandrich@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tWednesday, September 08, 1999 8:33 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[EQCheats] Pair of Bent spectacles/Lt.

Perhaps he is blind and can&#39;t find the guard towers.  If anyone<br/>\n&gt; has <br/>\n&gt; any info as to where he is, I would greatly appreciate it.  Yes, there<br/>\n&gt; will <br/>\n&gt; be a horrible faction hit, but that&#39;s the way it goes.
