<div id="ygrps-yiv-803610492">The frozen goblin is actually in the SCRYER room. The King&#39;s room is the<br/>
raised/lower floor room just this side of the diplomat and Vox&#39;s tunnels.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen the frozen gobbie, but I don&#39;t know what his deal is... And yea,.<br/>
I seen that map. It&#39;s inaccurate, although the layout is essentially correct<br/>
I think, just mob names are wrong.<br/>

Anybody have any info on the frozen gob in Permafrost?  One of my maps<br/>
indicates the room that he is in is the &quot;King&quot; room, but I believe that is a<br/>
mistake.  The gob is in an oval shaped room in a giant block of ice.  He is<br/>
wearing some sort of a hat or crown, and he is not targetable.<br/>
Anybody know anything about this gob?<br/>
