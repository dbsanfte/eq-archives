<div id="ygrps-yiv-746820931">Ah, thank you for the info. Is there a spot where we can write back to him, for if he reads where<br/>
we write I would gladly put my two cents into it.<br/>
<br/>
As for answering your email *I know you didn&#39;t ask for one :)*, but for the general populations<br/>
*not just mine or yours but for everyone reading this*, I believe that if Sony wants us to sell to<br/>
other players to make a profit instead of vendors, they are limiting our game play, if they want<br/>
best of both worlds *Sony* in their ideology of how the game should be run, then they need to fix<br/>
it so that IF someone wants to sell to a PC they might get more depending on what they ask for, but<br/>
if they want to sell to a NPC they will get less. Now, the way they have it setup now, it&#39;s not<br/>
even worth maken the items to sell to PC&#39;s because what PC in their right mind would spend 2pp on a<br/>
pie tin ? This is the minimum amount that should be offered if sold to a PC, because of the drastic<br/>
increase in price for sketching of a Pie Tin. They must work on it more before implementing a<br/>
number throwen into the skill, so that it&#39;s just not profitable at all. Again, Sony is limiting us<br/>
in how we play the game, if someone chooses to sit on their butts and make PP all day, so be it, as<br/>
we all know, you can spend 300pp in about 5-10 minutes if you are buying weapons or armor of<br/>
considerable value, either case it&#39;s our choice.<br/>
<br/>
P.S if anyone believes this should not be talked about here, please either delete it when you see<br/>
my name with this subject, or show me a spot where we can talk more about it....besides their<br/>
webboards :)<br/>

&gt; describing how they view trade skills, and he has explicitly stated<br/>
&gt; in no uncertain terms that they do not want any of the player trade<br/>
&gt; skills to be implemented in such a way so as to allow for a player to<br/>
&gt; purchase items from vendors, execute their skill, and sell the<br/>
&gt; results of their efforts back to vendors at a profit.  The way they<br/>
&gt; want it to work is to offer players a &#39;sweet spot&#39; between what they<br/>
&gt; paid for materials and what NPC vendors charge for an equivilant item<br/>
&gt; to what a player can make themselves through their tradecraft.  This<br/>
&gt; way, a player is encouraged to sell their wares at a profit to other<br/>
&gt; players and not at a loss to vendors.<br/>
&gt;         In this way, they want to stimulate the &quot;player run economy&quot;<br/>
&gt; and not a &quot;kick back and make a bunch of plat just interacting with<br/>
&gt; vendors&quot;-type approach.  I&#39;m not saying I agree with it, I&#39;m just<br/>
&gt; passing on what I know to be true... not player speculation or rumor,<br/>
&gt; but actual statements from The Man. :)<br/>
