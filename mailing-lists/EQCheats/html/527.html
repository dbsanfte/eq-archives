<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now, with all that said... does anybody else think that necros are vastly<br/>
&gt; overpowered?  They do FAR more damage than any other class at all levels,<br/>
&gt; they get pretty much every combat-utility spell that any other class gets<br/>
&gt; (like roots, disempowers, debuffs, etc), AND get the ability to summon pets<br/>
&gt; of higher level than any other class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*LOL*  How many necros have you played?  Their pets are *vastly*<br/>
 inferior to mage pets.  Vastly.<br/>
<br/>
They also have to research their mid-high level pets.<br/>
<br/>
They are hated in almost all but 3 cities.<br/>

&gt; by some NPCs? After having played a troll for several months and<br/>
&gt; being KOS by EVERY npc north of innothule.... the necros have it<br/>
&gt; easy... like super-easy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*laugh*  Uh-huh.   What makes you think the DE necros have it any<br/>
easier?  Or human or eru necros which are viewed with distaste IN<br/>
THEIR OWN CITY?<br/>

&gt; figure out what is going on. I&#39;m guessing I&#39;m not seeing the whole<br/>
&gt; picture or something.... because recent events just haven&#39;t made any<br/>
&gt; sense to this stupid troll.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Cutting down a 1600(!) damage spell is HARDLY &quot;gimping&quot; unless you are<br/>
a 100% kiter.  Are you?</div>
