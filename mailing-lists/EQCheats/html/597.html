<div id="ygrps-yiv-365732015">Good point -- a typical work year is 2080 hours.  I did a /play and I felt<br/>
like I was hit with a brick.  I clocked about 400 hours since the game came<br/>
out, in March.  I started the day it came out.  Do you know what I could do<br/>
with my life with 400 extra hours?  <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I quit the game this week.<br/>

I think the point that was being made is that some of us (a lot?) have other<br/>
commitments outside of being brain-sucked by a computer game - spouses,<br/>
children, career commitments, school, whatever - that make it impossible for<br/>
us to play 20 hours a week.<br/>
You said you were originally thinking it would take you a year to reach<br/>
level 50 at 20 hours a week.  Reality check :  THAT&#39;S over 1000 HOURS of<br/>
your time to finish playing a GAME.<br/>
Most people in this country don&#39;t spend 2000 hours in a YEAR making enough<br/>
money to live.<br/>
Yikes, scary to me that anybody would spend that much time playing a<br/>
game....but I digress....if you want to spend the time (and/or if you HAVE<br/>
that much time to spend!) I guess its your prerogative...but for a lot of us<br/>
that just isn&#39;t possible.<br/>
I have been fairly satisfied with the rate of my level progression, but I<br/>
would be happier if it were a LITTLE bit faster.  It seems that the best way<br/>
to balance the game between Evercrack junkies and the more casual gamer are<br/>
additions and add-ons for higher levels (which Verant is working on), and a<br/>
faster rate of level progression overall.<br/>
Just my 2 coppers worth.<br/>

You think that 8-10 hours is &quot;a bit much&quot; to gain a level??  I play about 20<br/>
hours a week (on average) and gain about 1-2 levels, which is about right...<br/>
if it was half that, then instead of being a level 22 now, I would probably<br/>
already be up to 50!<br/>
<br/>
I kinda thought that most people level up pretty fast myself... hehe... Who<br/>
would have thought that just 3 months into this online game we would have<br/>
Level 50 players, and 4 months in, that we would have TONS of them, and many<br/>
more level 40+ players!!<br/>
<br/>
I really didn&#39;t expect to reach level 50 for about a year (at 20 hrs a week<br/>
that is about right too, it seems) so I think things are pretty good<br/>
myself... I know many people are more interested in leveling up as fast as<br/>
they can, but tell me, what do you do after you have reached level 50 and<br/>
have played at that level for a month or more?  I think I would get pretty<br/>
bored with it...<br/>

&gt; I agree that level gaining is quite slow. 8-10 hours<br/>
&gt; for a level is a bit much. I can&#39;t imagine the high<br/>
&gt; 30s and above.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;If Verant moves too far down this road EQ will<br/>
&gt; &gt; whither and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;die just like DR is.  Then we will move on to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; next game<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;until it gets too difficult to be fun anymore.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You have also hit that nail right on the head.  I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; only a casual player,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and there have been many patches where I&#39;ve felt a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bit shafted.  They have<br/>
&gt; &gt; made EQ into a beast that requires absurd amounts of<br/>
&gt; &gt; time to make any<br/>
&gt; &gt; progress whatsoever.  I used to have a great group<br/>
&gt; &gt; of people to party with,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but I couldn&#39;t dedicate the 40+ hours per week that<br/>
&gt; &gt; they did, so I&#39;m enough<br/>
&gt; &gt; levels behind that I can&#39;t group with them and make<br/>
&gt; &gt; any progress... so I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; stuck at a mid level and I haven&#39;t been able to find<br/>
&gt; &gt; another decent group<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the life of me.  So instead of facing all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; frustration, I&#39;m wishing I<br/>
&gt; &gt; could just switch my characters to &quot;inactive&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; status... where I can&#39;t play<br/>
&gt; &gt; the game, but they don&#39;t delete my characters.... so<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can come back in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; year or so if nothing better comes along.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; On the flip side, if EQ was just 50% easier, you<br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t be able to pry me<br/>
&gt; &gt; away from that infernal compter.  It&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; &gt; excitement of making progress<br/>
&gt; &gt; that is so fun, and for the casual gamer, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; progress curve in EQ is so low<br/>
&gt; &gt; after lvl 20 that it&#39;s just not that much fun<br/>
&gt; &gt; anymore.  I&#39;d almost rather<br/>
&gt; &gt; spend my time playing Kingdoms or go back and play<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bladur&#39;s Gate all the way<br/>
&gt; &gt; through, or best of all... go find a good text-based<br/>
&gt; &gt; MUD where I can advance<br/>
&gt; &gt; at a reasonable speed then wiz and start adding my<br/>
&gt; &gt; own imagination to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; world.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; P.S. does anybody know a email address for feedback?<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I&#39;d love to just share<br/>
&gt; &gt; some of these frustrations.<br/>
