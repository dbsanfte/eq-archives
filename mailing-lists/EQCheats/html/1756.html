<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361964357">I just decided, that instead of you all going to the links and the <br/>
site for EverQuest Emulator, and doing all of that stuff, that you <br/>
might as well just download the file at the group. It is the same <br/>
thing, but I added more stuff to it, so it is better =). It makes you <br/>
go faster when you play and go LD less =).<br/>
<br/>
Check it out in the files on how to connect to EQ Emu</div>
