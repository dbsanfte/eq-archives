<div id="ygrps-yiv-169872069">Hmmmm, how about joining a guild for legit reasons?  I&#39;ve been playing EQ<br/>
for a little over a week now and I&#39;m slowly getting to know a few other<br/>
players.  However, most of the time I&#39;m wondering around by myself.  I&#39;m a<br/>
wood elf ranger, currently level 7 on the Rallos Zek server.  I&#39;d like to<br/>
join a guild, but I haven&#39;t run into anyone else that&#39;s in one.<br/>

&gt; What a crappy way to make 10 plat. As a guild leader I can say this. If we<br/>
&gt; were to give someone 10 plat and they quit, who cares! I am surprised a<br/>
&gt; guild would invite someone with selfish motives, but none the less<br/>
leeching<br/>
&gt; off a guild does not hinder them, they are many people what is 10 plat to<br/>
&gt; 30 people? Or 600 plat for that matter (two of my guild members made that<br/>
&gt; in 3 days in our cash cow hunting grounds, they were both lev 22-24) Even<br/>
&gt; if you suckered a guild out of a lot of money (Say 25 plat at lev 6) it<br/>
&gt; will only hurt you. You will be remembered.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just thought it was funny you using this as a valid tactic. Why stop at<br/>
&gt; 10 plat, why not stay a member and get 20 plat, or full banded armor? Hey<br/>
&gt; why not just stay a member the whole way through and get the really good<br/>
&gt; stuff?<br/>

&gt; Not sure about the sense heading. But at level 6, to make 10 plat quick.<br/>
Is<br/>
&gt; to join a guild, get high level guild members to give you stuff. Then go<br/>
&gt; sell<br/>
&gt; and quit guild. How you like that? Bwahahahah!! I am a Dark Elf Cleric,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; have about 17 plat in bank. Just from saving. I have basic armor, so do<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; need anymore for a while, and do not need anything until level 9 and<br/>
&gt; spells.<br/>
&gt; So I have just been saving and that is what I have so far. Not too hard,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; I am gaining exp along the way. So it is all worth it. Anyone know where I<br/>
&gt; could get Fine Steel Weapons, or armor off of monsters?<br/>
