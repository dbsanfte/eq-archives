<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756400773">your paladin would miss a lot more than 1 out of 8 fighting a monk.  monks are all about not<br/>
getting hit.  a monk could duel any class and own them except possibly a wizard if he got the monk<br/>
rooted right away.  otherwise he would be dead as all hell.  a necro might have a chance too, if he<br/>
could get a dot or 2 or 3 on the monk (doubt this) he could kite him around the zone and eventually<br/>
kill him. but no melee classes can compare to a monk.  monks kick ass.<br/>

&gt; My Paladin only misses once out of every eight tries.  You also have to<br/>
&gt; take into account that we can buff ourselves pretty well stacking our<br/>
&gt; spirit armor, bravery, and guard spells to take our AC beyond that of a<br/>
&gt; warrior or monk and Symbal of Tranzil to add 250 more hit points by itself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think Verant has done a pretty good job in making the classes pretty<br/>
&gt; comparable.<br/>
