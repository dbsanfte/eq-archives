<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403425901">Don&#39;t know about Befallen.  However I can say that in Unrest it seems to<br/>
be true.  We were in the Knight room, and one member of the party sat in<br/>
the center of the room where the spawn point is.  we saw maybe 2 spawns<br/>
in 4 hours.  After he left, we stood at the edges of the wall, and the<br/>
knight spawned twice in an hour.  Take it for what you will.  Your<br/>
mileage may vary<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi all.  I have a question or two about the basement of Befallen...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We went down in hopes of getting a BBC for our Pally last night.  We<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; there for two hours or so, and never saw the SK.  We were told that<br/>
&gt; there is<br/>
&gt; a &quot;spawn line&quot;, ie, don&#39;t cross it or the SK will not spawn.  Is this<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; case?  If so, is that line at the end of the tunnel?  Or inside the<br/>
&gt; room?<br/>
&gt; It was fairly frustrating.  Also, there was another group there<br/>
&gt; camping for<br/>
&gt; the Robes, and I never saw that Theor..they...whatever guy that is<br/>
&gt; supposed<br/>
&gt; to drop the robes.  Does the same thing apply for him?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lastly..how often would you say the SK would normally spawn?  Every<br/>
&gt; 1/2<br/>
&gt; hour?  Hour?  2 hours?  I probably will not return to Befallen, unless<br/>
&gt; it is<br/>
&gt; with my Paladin with the objective of getting that BBC for him....so<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; info would be appreciated.  That place is just swarming with DE&#39;s, and<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; makes my dwarven skin crawl.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>
