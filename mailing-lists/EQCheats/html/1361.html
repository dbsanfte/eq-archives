<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131800365">Yes, i have done the crafted greaves and you do have the correct item.. in fact ive done all the crafted quests so feel free to ask anything about them.. Greaves require the dark circlet and two star rubies.. (Remember DONT stack the gems) Although i was once told that stacking them still works, it wouldnt take the chance..<br/>

Who has actually DONE the Crafted Greaves quest? I&#39;ve heard different<br/>
stories on what item you need. Some say the Silver Circlet off Drelzna, some<br/>
say a circlet off Najena, and some say one off Trazdon. <br/>
<br/>
I killed Trazdon in Najena last night at got a Dark Circlet (LORE NO DROP<br/>
MAGIC ITEM) Necro Only, AC 4, -2 CHA,  INT. Is this the correct item<br/>
(please only if you have 1st hand knowledge...) It could be a Circlet from<br/>
any of them could work....but I dont&#39; wanna take the chance as there is a<br/>
couple hours of work (plus two deaths...growl...I hadden&#39;t died in 6 ot 7<br/>
levels) and 140pp in rubies at stake...heh.<br/>
<br/>
And if this ISN&#39;T the correct circlet, what&#39;s this head peice worth?<br/>
