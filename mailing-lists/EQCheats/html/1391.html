<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733442216">I went there this weekend with me (Level 30 Ranger),<br/>
Level 30 Paladin, Level 33 warrior and a Level 20<br/>
Paladin. We were overkill for everything, even the<br/>
king is blue to me. The only problem was the Level 20<br/>
Paladin was causing trains due to his low level. <br/>
<br/>
If you are a 32 shaman (not sure if you mean you, and<br/>
a 32 Shaman) I would bring a Ranger/Paladin/Warrior/SK<br/>
to do the main tanking. You will more than likely get<br/>
jumped by a few elite goblin guards which could get<br/>
rough. Especially if you get Borxx, you want to<br/>
interrupt his casting, which a ranger or warrior can<br/>
do well with dual wield/double attack and decent<br/>
weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

&gt; Well, I heard he (Borxx) spawns in the King&#39;s Room.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll be going with<br/>
&gt; (atleast) myself (32 Shaman) plus a druid friend (29<br/>
&gt; Druid), and will nuke<br/>
&gt; his ass off when he spawns if possible. That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; assuming someone is camping<br/>
&gt; the kings room.... If not, well...I&#39;ll have to bring<br/>
&gt; some friends. Might<br/>
&gt; have to pull a higher level friend or two....hrm....<br/>
&gt; Camping the King&#39;s room<br/>
&gt; could be fun though for a higher level group.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone camped this room before? Know what kind of<br/>
&gt; group it would take to<br/>
&gt; camp sucessfully and control it? right now, my group<br/>
&gt; has been camping the<br/>
&gt; King&#39;s room in Perma and controling it well (&#39;cept<br/>
&gt; when the pull goes bad<br/>
&gt; for the higher levelers and 3-5 Ice Giants come<br/>
&gt; charging into the<br/>
&gt; room.....ouch....*chuckle*). <br/>
