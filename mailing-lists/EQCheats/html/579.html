<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278777777">Thanks to all for the intelligent responses!  :)<br/>
I just wanted to add that I DO NOT CAMP - at least not as far as farming<br/>
items as concerned (as opposed to hanging out at a derv camp for hours on<br/>
end - which I HAVE done!).<br/>
Smithing is a special case...not only does it require a SIGNIFICANT<br/>
financial investment, but the only profitable outlet for your wares is<br/>
selling to fellow players.  This kind of player interaction is something<br/>
that Verant has deemed a positive role-playing experience (OK, I KNOW what<br/>
you&#39;re thinking!  But that&#39;s what VERANT thinks!).  Unfortunately for all of<br/>
the master smiths out there, the massive flooding of ringmail, chain and<br/>
ESPECIALLY bronze armor has ruined the market for selling banded.<br/>
For those of you that think that 60 plat is a significant investment when<br/>
you know that a skill will earn up to 40 plat an hour....well....I don&#39;t<br/>
know what to say....I think that&#39;s pretty funny :)<br/>
Try and keep things in perspective, folks!  EQ is a GAME...and to this point<br/>
its the best online RPG that&#39;s ever been produced.  It&#39;s got it&#39;s<br/>
faults...and, yeah, I think they are making some pretty silly decisions in<br/>
there current attempts at tweaking the &#39;balance&#39;.  But its still the best<br/>
online RPG that I&#39;ve ever played....wouldn&#39;t you agree??<br/>
Now go out there and kick some ASS!<br/>
Or....errrr....go out there and throw some CLAY!<br/>
Whatever ya do, HAVE FUN!<br/>
Sean<br/>

Sean, since you insisted that we &#39;flame away&#39; here is a response for ya!<br/>
<br/>
Obviously you have NOT tried to take up a skill...  please don&#39;t... It would<br/>
only ruin it for everyone (just kidding)...<br/>
<br/>
But seriously...  It COSTS a lot to take up a skill... Especially one like<br/>
Smithing... You will pay out about 200-300plat to learn enough to be able to<br/>
make Banded armor... Then you will FINALLY be able to sell something for<br/>
over your cost (everything else costs more to make than it does to sell to<br/>
an NPC, and PC&#39;s don&#39;t buy things like Files, Scalers and Skewers, so the<br/>
only customer you have is the NPC (can you say monopoly?)... But while I<br/>
don&#39;t think it fair to make a HUGE profit from NPC&#39;s, it would be nice if<br/>
you could simply get you money back on the SUCCESSFUL items...<br/>
<br/>
And is it really any different sitting around a forge or oven making and<br/>
selling things, than for those that are *harvesting* items from the NPC&#39;s in<br/>
places like Unrest and HighHold??  I don&#39;t think so, and I would almost bet<br/>
money you don&#39;t mind doing that!<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I have never seen anyone CAMP a forge, and even if they did, and<br/>
there were others waiting &#39;in line&#39;, eventually they would leave because<br/>
they needed more raw materials (molds, metal, etc.) so others would drop in<br/>
when they left to go get more...<br/>
<br/>
But I have heard of many groups that camp places like the Tower in Unrest...<br/>
Getting all the BS armor they can, then sending a member out to sell it off<br/>
or twink it over to another character so they can come back for more... The<br/>
other night we ran into such a group, many of them over level 30, who were<br/>
not even interested in any of the other mobs that spawned there, only the<br/>
Knight... And the others would not attack them because they were too high<br/>
level... This is just Harvesting plain and simple...  One of them even told<br/>
me he just needed to get his characters loot up to 1000 plat in the bank so<br/>
he could SELL it at EBAY!!  How sick can you get...<br/>
<br/>
My point is, they really are fixing the wrong area (skills) in the wrong<br/>
manner... Its lousy that some skills cost so little to practice and others<br/>
cost more... but a person who decides to be a baker, smith, or whatever<br/>
SHOULD be able to make a profit from PC&#39;s, and should at the very least be<br/>
at a break even point for items sold to an NPC...<br/>
<br/>
There is too much money in the game already, and that is because there is<br/>
too much LOOT in the game, not because there are too many pie tins or<br/>
skewers or Bat Wing Crunchies!  If Verant really wants to do something about<br/>
it, they need to control things like Mobs dropping Bronze armor all the<br/>
time, which USED to sell only to PC&#39;s, but which, now that most already have<br/>
it, gets dumped at the NPC&#39;s for more plat too...<br/>

&gt; Sorry guys....<br/>
&gt; I have to side with Verant on Nerfing the Pottery/Brewing type skills.<br/>
&gt; If you guys want to sit around doing these monotonous, boring vendor-type<br/>
&gt; skills, than I guess that is your prerogative...BUT I sure don&#39;t see where<br/>
&gt; you guys should be making 8-10 times the profit in an hour that a person<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; make out fighting monsters.<br/>
&gt; Agreed, they seem to be going a little overboard with there &#39;corrections&#39;.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think it should be impossible for you to make money selling made<br/>
&gt; items to NPCs, but the amount of money that you make should be very<br/>
&gt; comparable to what I can make out there gathering loot off of MOBs.  My<br/>
&gt; impression (please feel free to correct me if I am wrong!) is that you<br/>
guys<br/>
&gt; are the same group of people that made hundreds of millions of TONS of<br/>
&gt; surplus Tailoring-made items in UO - you chose to spend time working up<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; Tailor so you could provide your mage with enough money to buy reagents.<br/>
&gt; True?<br/>
&gt; The point I&#39;m trying to make is that you guys were taking advantage of the<br/>
&gt; system...using in imbalance in the pricing structure to make a LOT more<br/>
cash<br/>
&gt; than you should have been able to make by using trade skills.  Be happy<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; you got to take advantage of the system as long as you did.  But PLEASE<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t whine when they try to balance things out...it trivializes the real<br/>
&gt; issues around game balance.<br/>
&gt; Thanks for your time.<br/>
&gt; Flame away  :-)<br/>

&gt;  Now you can try to sell all those fine pottery Wares<br/>
&gt; to the Players!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Belgarth auctions Large Bowl only 2 Plat!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This game is sucking worse every day. It has the<br/>
&gt; serious UO syndrome of sucking all the fun and<br/>
&gt; enjoyment out of the game.<br/>
