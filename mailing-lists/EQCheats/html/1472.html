<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980574688">Keep reading the news, though.  Instead of being dropped by a mob it is<br/>
going to be through a class specific quest (details not known yet).<br/>
Hopefully they will make it so that only that class can do it and change the<br/>
warrior crafted quest where only warriors can do it.<br/>

&gt; &gt;No its not on the live server yet. They said they&#39;ll probably make that<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt;this update. Wednsdays. Read the eqnews that downloads from the update<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt;wednsday and it will tell you what changed. ALSO. They are no longer<br/>
&gt; having<br/>
&gt; &gt;rubicite dropped from the creatures that drop it currently. Everyone that<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;has<br/>
&gt; &gt;rubicite will keep it but you will no longer be able to get it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Leave it to Verant to screw something up worse than the problem it was <br/>
&gt; trying to fix (yet again I might add)! Why the hell couldn&#39;t they just<br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; made rubi no drop????? I&#39;m seriously thinking about quitting now. Rubi was<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; about the last think my DESK had left to look forward to.<br/>
