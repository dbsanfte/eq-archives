<div id="ygrps-yiv-895408754">Yea.. that certainly does sorta bring back my spirit into the game.. i dunno <br/>
but it just didn&#39;t seem as fun as it used to... especially for me... i have a <br/>
lev 18 magician (DE) on veeshan and am pretty proud of him... but its hard to <br/>
level... and most of the stuff i hear about going on.. even to get the nicer <br/>
items, you need to be lev 30+... and i don&#39;t know if i can hang in there long <br/>
enough to reach that lev... though i&#39;d love to do something other than just <br/>
hunt all the time... BTW i&#39;m agnostic so basically everyone in nerriak/grobb <br/>
and Oggok are dubious to me.. and you know DE&#39;s in freeport and other <br/>
towns... so in all my searching i have found ONE quest that i can actually <br/>
do.. that being the sro research quest (which last time i checked was broken <br/>
anyway..) i&#39;m really just looking for things like that, that can bring me <br/>
back into the game truely having fun.. even if it means restarting a <br/>
character on another server.. (i tried this on Tallon zek.. and 200+ people <br/>
in nek forest looking for every last moss snake is no fun.. neither is having <br/>
your life savings stollen from you by a lev 8 human who jumps you while your <br/>
hunting, 1/8 a bub from lev 4....) anyone have any ideas on things i can do?  <br/>
Or even a server or guild that i might be able to join that adds more fun and <br/>
RPing for the game?  anything you have to say would be verry appreciated...<br/>
