<div id="ygrps-yiv-465278098">I think several classes have it. It&#39;s not all that great. All I have<br/>
ever gotten from it was an &quot;In-game name&quot; for items. Like the<br/>
Blackened Wand or whatever. If you cast Ident on it, you get a name of<br/>
&quot;Wand of So-and-So&quot; I think it&#39;s mostly as hints to quest items. You<br/>
wouldn&#39;t know that the blackened wand was related to a quest if the<br/>
NPCs are all talking about some guy&#39;s wand, but the blackened was the<br/>
actuall quest item. (Unless, the info was posted somewhere.) :)<br/>
<br/>
The info I have recieved from identify has hardly been the trouble to<br/>
mem and cast the spell. (IMO at least) The only thing more useless<br/>
than Ident is Sense magic. Every stupid thing that I would sense magic<br/>
on already had (MAGIC ITEM) in the description.<br/>

&gt; *chuckle* Yea, and Alchemy will be implimented and Shaman&#39;s will get that<br/>
&gt; new spell we were promised replacing Charm.... *chuckle* Please, I would<br/>
&gt; love to get happy about them fixing and finishing stuff....just hasn&#39;t been<br/>
&gt; a good track record for shaman promises though...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is Identify an Enchanter spell? If so, then it should be replaced by a good<br/>
&gt; one ;-)<br/>
