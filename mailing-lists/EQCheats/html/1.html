<div id="ygrps-yiv-926493471">Greetings everyone, this is the list moderator, I&#39;m pleased to see everyone <br/>
who joined, and overwhelmed at the number of people.  I did not expect so <br/>
many people to join.  However the number of the people on this list is not <br/>
working well with the number of messages (0). So I&#39;m going to start off <br/>
hopefully.  I&#39;d like to hear from all of you the most rewarding Static Quest <br/>
you have been on. If you don&#39;t know what that is, it&#39;s a quest that is <br/>
available 24/7. Not a GM or Guild Created quest, those are Dynamic Quests.  <br/>
But back onto the subject, the most rewarding static quest I&#39;ve been on is in <br/>
Qeynos (The best city :P), which is the quest of collecting taxes for Vicus, <br/>
who is the tax collector but hes got a bit of a cough and he can&#39;t do his <br/>
job.  <br/>
He normally gives a number of silver pieces, experience, and up to 2 items, <br/>
at least thats the best I&#39;ve had. The biggest silver: 24.  The biggest exp: <br/>
3/4 of a Bubble. Best items: A gem and an earring.<br/>
<br/>
Please reply to the list w/ what you think was the most rewarding quest <br/>
you&#39;ve been on. Also if anyone has any tips/hints/tricks on anything that is <br/>
helpful in the game, send &#39;em in. And if anyone has questions about something <br/>
in the game thats not general (i.e. no newbie crap, im not here to babysit, <br/>
play the tutorial), don&#39;t hesitate to send in.</div>
