<div id="ygrps-yiv-539729496">Well, speaking from experience (last night), I was camping Trazdon. He&#39;s not<br/>
listed on any maps I&#39;ve seen, so I&#39;ll tell ya his location first. He&#39;s down<br/>
around the corner from Bonecraker. His room should be just across the wall<br/>
from Bonecracker actually. Has some blood in the room with a misty type<br/>
waterfall. Two elementals, a mage plus pet, Trazdon&#39;s spawn point (can be<br/>
him or a mage from my experience), plus an ogre (officer when I was there,<br/>
he never cam edown to assist or anything so I never killed him). At level<br/>
32, the mages were still agressive, although two 149 damage spells kills<br/>
them. Pets are three of the same I think. Get em as they spawn and yer fine.<br/>
Trazdon isn&#39;t a whole lot harder, but again, I&#39;m 32 so I resisted most of<br/>
his spells. He was low low blue to me, the mages were greens (agressive<br/>
green). <br/>
<br/>
I held the room with little problem as a 32 Shaman (although a nice cleric<br/>
traded buffs with me for a sow, so I had like 804 hp...heh...that was nice).<br/>
I think it&#39;s a 20 minute spawn cycle.<br/>
<br/>
Never camped the others, so I don&#39;t know for sure, but they should be about<br/>
the same.<br/>
