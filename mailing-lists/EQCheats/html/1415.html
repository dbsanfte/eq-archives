: Yes i do know where the plans come from, can you please send more info to<br/>
: the list as to where the quest starts from please, at any rate the plans<br/>
: come off a SG in so ro, hes not named however he is distinguished by being<br/>
: much lower level than a sg normally is, mid to hight twenties instead of<br/>
: thirties.  Now that i have helped you please help me and tell me where the<br/>
: quest starts.<br/>
<br/>
The Kilji quest starts in Kelethin, go down past the Ranger and Druid<br/>
guilds, there is a smith shop, there is a guy standing outside the shop who<br/>
talks about them. He wants the plans and (I think) 3 enchanted gold bars, or<br/>
something like that. Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
Now that I have helped you, please please please SOMEONE take pity upon my<br/>
weary form and tell me who to talk to to start the Hero Bracer quest!! Only<br/>
lead I have is that it is somewhere in Qeynos, probably... well whoopee,<br/>
there&#39;s only like fifty dozen NPCs there.<br/>
<br/>
Please someone help. </span></blockquote></div>
