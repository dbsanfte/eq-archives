 Anyone know where a lvl 9 cleric could hunt and level REALLY fast.  I know<br/>
 in N Ro i can kill bugs (scarabs and tarantulas) but they give shit for<br/>
 loot.  I have partied with a lvl 10 warrior and lvl 10 bard and kicked ass<br/>
 at derv camps, but it&#39;s too much work finding people willing to party to<br/>
 derv hunt.  I was wondering if there was anywhere that was REALLY easy to<br/>
 lvl at, or like a place where only Mummys spawn, that would work the best.<br/>
 I heard HighPass was good, but from others i heard it&#39;s for lvl 15-25<br/>
 people.  I also heard Lake Rathe was the best, but I&#39;d have to party, and<br/>
 hardly any people are there.  Any info?<br/>

Snakes everywhere.  Good exp and the best loot by far for this lvl - cloth <br/>
armor, weapons, giant snake fangs and money on almost every monster.  Black <br/>
Burrow is very, very popular so grouping is very easy especially for a healer <br/>
type such as yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Black Burrow is the zone that connects Queynos Hills with Everfrost and Halas <br/>
the Barbarian lands.<br/>
