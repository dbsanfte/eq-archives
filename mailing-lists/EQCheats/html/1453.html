<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037263278">It states, somewhere, in the manual that part of the game is &quot;protecting your<br/>
home&quot; and city against other races.  I wasn&#39;t involved directly, but happend to<br/>
be nearby auctioning when this happend.  I never bothered to look it up, but the<br/>
GMs sure did.<br/>
<br/>
The manual language was pointed out after several instances of guard training<br/>
where several pleayers were warned that this was a bannable offense.  The GM had<br/>
already &quot;marked&quot; their account. After the peeps pointed this paragraph out, and<br/>
about a half hour, the lead GM said &quot;We (the GMs) were incorrect.  This is not a<br/>
bannable offense.  I have removed the warning marks from your account.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was there watching the whole thing.  If they have come to some other<br/>
conclusion since this time, or if this was server specific, then so be it, but<br/>
this was the head GM, after contact by several guides and another GM.  I assume<br/>
that the 30 minute delay was because they were contacting Verant associates<br/>
other than the GMs or had a quick GM meeting to discuss this.</div>
