That one <br>did not follow the terms of agreement, and yes, was illegal, however, <br>I think you should all read about the second one.<br>The second one is completely legal, and you cannot lose your account <br>using it. The EverQuest officials don&#39;t like it very much, but they <br>have to live with it. They are not allowed to delete your account, <br>even if they were to found out you were using it and in the part of <br>EverQuest. GM&#39;s absolutely hate it, and most of them would delete <br>your account, though they are not allowed, if they found out. If they <br>were to do this, you could complain to Sony and they would be FORCED <br>to give your account back. All the EverQuest officials know about <br>this second one, and they can&#39;t do anything about it. It isn&#39;t a
 <br>third party program, and does not, in any of the rules and terms of <br>agreement, go against what they say. <br>I do repeat that they already know about this. They cannot do <br>anything about it, and they don&#39;t really care. The only people who <br>actually care are the GM&#39;s because, they lose there power over other <br>players. They like the power, and that is why they delete other <br>accounts. They can get in serious trouble with Sony if they were to <br>do this. <br>I have so far met 1 GM from EverQuest that has decided to join this. <br>They were one of the few GM&#39;s that were at Lead-Administrator status <br>or lower that thought this was neat. This thing has been worked on <br>almost since EverQuest was made. <br>This is completely legal. On there site, they show that they are not <br>affilitated with the EverQuest makers/programmers, and show the <br>EverQuest trademark at the bottom.<br>It was very nice that you thought about that first, and I totally <br>agree. The
 first one will not be added because the site was <br>destroyed, and the version I have on my computer no longer works with <br>EverQuest because they updated the patch.<br>I am adding in the one thing tomorrow. Many people like this, and it <br>is growing every day ever since Guild Wars started =). I haven&#39;t <br>really tried it yet myself, but Guild Wars is supposed to be amazing.<br>From your proud GM of this thing:<br>(Lord Deimos The Slaughterer) Currently second in command on two <br>servers and GM on five other servers, 7 total.<br>And when you join, look for my great GM friends too =)<br><br><br>Name: Rallos<br>Ranks: mgtg<br>Servers:<br>(Semi_Legit) Jezebell&#39;s Server<br>Badbing Semi-Legit Server<br>Bahamut Zero (Legit) Server<br><br>Name: Nilar<br>Ranks:<br>Gm-Impossible <br>mgtg<br>Servers:<br>(Semi-Legit) Jezebell&#39;s Server<br>SaltyBooger&#39;s (Non-Legit) Server<br>Badabing Semi-Legit Server<br><br>Name: Agushor<br>Ranks: <br>Gm-Impossible<br>Server&#39;s:<br>Bahamut
