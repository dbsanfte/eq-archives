<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174993288">IIRC, the preacher has either a Cold Iron Mace? (name<br/>
something like that) or the Runed Circlet. I would<br/>
think someone else had it.<br/>
<br/>
There is a Wizard quest dealing with the Ice Comet<br/>
spell that requires various staffs, I believe that is<br/>
what these are for. From the information I have, you<br/>
need to be a Wizard to do it because of research<br/>
requirements.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi there,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Im in permafrost and I have been hunting for the mob<br/>
&gt; that has the Ice<br/>
&gt; Crystal Staff. I was under the impression that it<br/>
&gt; was the Preacher that had<br/>
&gt; it. But I can&#39;t seem to get it.. Anyone know if it<br/>
&gt; is the preacher or is it<br/>
&gt; in another area ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, I read on everlore that the staffs are part of<br/>
&gt; a quest. Somehow you<br/>
&gt; can use the Water Crystal Staff and starts a long<br/>
&gt; quest to get a great mage<br/>
&gt; useable one handed magic staff or something... Im<br/>
&gt; curious if any of you have<br/>
&gt; any idea as to what it is ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Reuben<br/>
