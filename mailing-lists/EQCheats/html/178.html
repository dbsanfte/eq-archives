<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279865222">I hope whoever finds it doesn&#39;t tell anyone else, although I highly doubt <br/>
that. If all the stats said here are true, that thing will the be the most <br/>
camped item in all of Norrath. For its looks, and its stats. If your paladin <br/>
or not, you could sell it for a ton. I just hope that someone finds it, and <br/>
then doesn&#39;t tell anyone.</div>
