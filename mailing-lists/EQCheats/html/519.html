<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302969975">I play Both Shaman and Druid in game and the Shamans spells are a bit more<br/>
powerful but druids get snare, that gives them a major edge in kiting.<br/>
Though neither of these is the king of kiting actually, it&#39;s a Necro.  Even<br/>
better is a Necro with Jboots and SoW or even a Necro teamed with a Druid.<br/>
At 12 I can do 250 Damage in a min with 2 spells stack 2 others and life tap<br/>
and it comes to about 300 a min at 12 then rising to 450 at 16 for just 3<br/>
spells.  The big &quot;IF&quot; is if your darkness spell is resisted.<br/>

I play a lvl 30 druid and I know that my dots don&#39;t even compare to the<br/>
Shamans,<br/>
well maybe now they do since they toned them down. For example My sting<br/>
swarm at<br/>
19lvl does like 100, Creeping crude(24lvl) around 180, and immote(29lvl) is<br/>
around 250 with a -15 ac adj. Druids do make great kiters up to lvl 34ish,<br/>
but<br/>
after that its dung. time and we suck in dung&#39;s. Most of our spells are<br/>
outdoor<br/>
only, and we don&#39;t heal or nuke as good as cleric&#39;s or wizards do. We&#39;re<br/>
alot<br/>
like a bard in someways, more versatile but not good in any one thing.</div>
