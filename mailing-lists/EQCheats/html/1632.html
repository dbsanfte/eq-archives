<div id="ygrps-yiv-404447365">I&#39;ve heard that you can hex edit the Tutorial.exe so that you can view any <br/>
zone in the game free of mobs.  I was just wondering how exactly you do <br/>
that.  What files to open with what, which lines of code to replace, etc.  <br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

Hi there.. there is a program called &quot;Eze&quot; that you can use to hex edit the <br/>
game without having to wory about the actual hex. it&#39;s all done though the <br/>
interface. you may have to edit the config and things, and the drawbacks are <br/>
some zones aren&#39;t accessable, because the tutorial starts at 0,0 and that&#39;s <br/>
not in some zones, and that you are ahuman that can only walk, but the <br/>
advantages are you can explor kedge and not worry about drowning, and you <br/>
can explore MM without pulling the entire zone. =)<br/>
