<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104976834">Just reading on the boards about this, and was wond3ring how much it was<br/>
going for. I&#39;ve been ni the room, and we held it for awhile, but the goblin<br/>
never popped, and when our group of 20-24th levels had 6 dire wolves and a<br/>
couple goblins on us, it kinda broke us up...Heh.. So, was wondering how<br/>
much the Circlet is selling for.</div>
