<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396629739">necro&#39;s do get root but at like 34 or 39...somewhere in that range....most<br/>
casting class&#39;s get root early and then just get improved versions as they<br/>
get older.<br/>
<br/>
For some actual info now<br/>
<br/>
Dark Elves have the hardest racial exp gain.<br/>
Humans have the easiest racial exp gain.<br/>
SK&#39;s and Necro&#39;s have the hardest exp gains.<br/>
Druids make 25% more exp when hunting in an &quot;indoor&quot; zone.<br/>
<br/>
Byzar Bloodforge is the NPC in Kaladim....he is in the left wing of the<br/>
warriors guild.  You need a really good faction though to get it from him.<br/>
If you have been killing crushbone orcs or goblins for your early levels<br/>
you should be good.  Trumpy...the one you need to kill to get the head is<br/>
about level 9....realy easy to kill and the guards standing around him<br/>
won&#39;t care if you attack him.<br/>
