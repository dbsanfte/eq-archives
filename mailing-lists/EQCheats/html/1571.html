 This doesn&#39;t work much anymore... Bat Wings are purchasable in unlimited<br/>
 amounts in Kithicor and West Freeport (probably other zones as well, Ogguk<br/>
 or Grobb almost ceratinly) for about 14 copper each. People are beginning to<br/>
 know this. :)<br/>

But...,<br/>
Higher lvl wizards and even many mid lvl wizards like me will jump on an <br/>
offer to buy 20 wings or so for 10pp (chump change really) - just so as not <br/>
to even bother with trying to find a merchant that has them - or go to a zone <br/>
where we have no business to attend to.<br/>
