<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159208975">Lake Rathe is for like AT LEAST lvl 18&#39;s in groups...good luck+ACE-<br/>
Try fighting Undead...befallen would be one place to go.<br/>
Also, there is a camp (ruins) in the East Commons, just west of the tunnel<br/>
that leads to Nort Ro...irs along the south zone border.  Skells and ghouls<br/>
mostly I think...make sure you /con them some will come up red to me<br/>
(lvl12).<br/>

Anyone know where a lvl 9 cleric could hunt and level REALLY fast.  I know<br/>
in N Ro i can kill bugs (scarabs and tarantulas) but they give shit for<br/>
loot.  I have partied with a lvl 10 warrior and lvl 10 bard and kicked ass<br/>
at derv camps, but it&#39;s too much work finding people willing to party to<br/>
derv hunt.  I was wondering if there was anywhere that was REALLY easy to<br/>
lvl at, or like a place where only Mummys spawn, that would work the best.<br/>
I heard HighPass was good, but from others i heard it&#39;s for lvl 15-25<br/>
people.  I also heard Lake Rathe was the best, but I&#39;d have to party, and<br/>
hardly any people are there.  Any info?<br/>
