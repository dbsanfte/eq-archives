<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599348319">Unfortunately this is not quite true.  I personally have witnessed the <br/>
Knight spawn 3 times.  He had the BIB only once.  The other 2 <br/>
times it was just a fine steel weapon.<br/>
<br/>
And wouldnt you know it,  I was second in line to loot  :)<br/>

&gt; I fully agree the BIB is much easier to get, the knight spawns about every<br/>
&gt; 4 hours in my experience and he always has the sword.......the exp in that<br/>
&gt; room is great to and you tend to avoid evil eye trains.......unless some<br/>
&gt; blinded idiot wanders into the room with an EE chasing him (happened to my<br/>
&gt; party once)  but if you are under lvl 28 or so I would recommend not<br/>
&gt; leaving the room.....(don&#39;t pull anything) just be patient and content<br/>
&gt; with room spawn and you should have no trouble..<br/>
