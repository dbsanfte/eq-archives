<div id="ygrps-yiv-910679208"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; the person who<br/>
&gt; gave the quest, and then died.  Someone standing next to the<br/>
&gt; person who gave<br/>
&gt; the quest would then hail the guard locking him in place.<br/>
&gt; You then could<br/>
&gt; receive the quest, and give the item to the guard gaining xp<br/>
&gt; and faction.<br/>
&gt; People went from first to 12th level like this in a matter of<br/>
&gt; hours before<br/>
&gt; being banned.  It&#39;s possible though unlikely this quest (Or<br/>
&gt; any quest like<br/>
&gt; it) is still in the game.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The quest is still there. They just moved the Deputy into Misty so he was a<br/>
zone away. Its a shame they did this because the cheat describe above was<br/>
abusive and childish. The Deputy was not uncommon and it was VERY easy to do<br/>
this quest over and over again without dragging him to the guy that gave the<br/>
quest. It was a great way to improve faction and get lots of experience<br/>
quickly. Once they did this stupid dragging trick (which really gained them<br/>
nothing, you could hail him and lock him in place without doing this) the<br/>
easy quick part went away. I have no problem with using things to our<br/>
advantage, but this trick was unnecessary and cost all of us a great easy<br/>
power leveling quest for youngsters.<br/>
