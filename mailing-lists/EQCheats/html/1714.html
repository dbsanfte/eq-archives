<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496315185">no for fighting skills the important factor is dex and agi, I have a WE<br/>
rogue who has over 15o agi and about 175 dex but dumb as a rock on wis/int<br/>
and his fighting skills fly through the roof, try buffing up your dex and<br/>
agi a bit it should help<br/>

Subject: [EQCheats] About Intel. and learning.....................<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I am working up a Bar. Shaman and have made it so far to 12th level,<br/>
&gt; the starting Intel. is 60 for the class/race. I Got a really great<br/>
&gt; set of arms (Giant scalemail arms) it give +3 wis, +20 hps -3 int<br/>
&gt; which reduces my intel to 57. I Juat got a Good spear for my class<br/>
&gt; and level and am trying to learn it up in skill levels, I have added<br/>
&gt; 10 points to Pierceing and been stabing the &quot;Heck&quot; out of anything I<br/>
&gt; con Light Blue or higher and have not gone up one poing in pierceing.<br/>
&gt; Now to what I wanted to know.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does the Dif. between an intel. of 60 and that of 57 make any change<br/>
&gt; in how well I Learn skills with use? If so then I have a great set of<br/>
&gt; arms that a spell slinger can use on the server I am on and if not<br/>
&gt; then how high do I need to raise my Intel to learn quicker?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks..<br/>
