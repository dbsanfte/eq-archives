idea.<br/>
<br/>
And, people are HUNGRY to get on a server that isn&#39;t so damned crowded. Same<br/>
thing happened with UO. New server goes up, instantly hundred of people on<br/>
it.<br/>

    Does anyone know if there&#39;s a way to move one or all of your chars to a <br/>
different world server?  I&#39;ve noticed that when a new world server goes up <br/>
all the sudden there&#39;s 500+ people playing on it.  I wouldn&#39;t have thought <br/>
that within the space of an hour or two of the new world server going online<br/>
<br/>
that that many new players would start there or old players would start a<br/>
new <br/>
char on it. <br/>
THANKS<br/>
