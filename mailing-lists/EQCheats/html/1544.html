<div id="ygrps-yiv-888895443">I want to do the rain caller quest but at 19 i dont think i will survive in <br/>
Kedge keep for more than 10 seconds...hardly enough time to camp a lvl 50+ <br/>
mermaid with a few full groups of lvl 50s and loot the body.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking, in quests like the CB belt quest, when you give nusbuk only <br/>
1 shoulder pad he tells you to kill another legonier and bring him a second <br/>
pad for your reward. if another person gives him 1 pad he thinks he has <br/>
goten 2 and gives the EXP and reward for the quest to the last person to <br/>
hand him an item.<br/>
<br/>
Are all NPCs like that?<br/>
Basicaly i need to give the mermaid hair(no drop) gorilla hair(no drop) and <br/>
an old wig to fuzzlecutter in Fp...i can get the wig but the gorilla hair <br/>
and the mermaid hair are imposible for me. Could i hire a few lvl 50s to <br/>
kill the mermaid and loot the hair and the gorillas in cazic and loot the <br/>
hair. then if Freeport they could hand those to Fuzzlecutter, then i hand <br/>
him the wig...any opinions on wether it would work or not?<br/>
