<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120778997">Heh -- gotta admit, EQ has put a drastic reduction on how much TV I watch.<br/>
I guess if you look at it that way, it doesn&#39;t seem quite so bad. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Good point -- a typical work year is 2080 hours.  I did a /play and I<br/>
felt<br/>
&gt; &gt; like I was hit with a brick.  I clocked about 400 hours since the game<br/>
&gt; came<br/>
&gt; &gt; out, in March.  I started the day it came out.  Do you know what I could<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; &gt; with my life with 400 extra hours?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Needless to say, I quit the game this week.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wow!  I guess we could watch the average 23 hours of TV per week like the<br/>
&gt; rest of the country does... Hmmm... wait... that&#39;s MORE!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or, we could work an extra 20 hours a week??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don;t know about the rest of you, but I work to live, I do NOT live to<br/>
&gt; work!  I live to have FUN because that is what *I* believe life is all<br/>
&gt; about... Having a GOOD time, a GOOD life, and trying to help others do the<br/>
&gt; same thing!  But again, that is MY thoughts and opinions, but it&#39;s also my<br/>
&gt; life...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry to hear you are quiting Tony!<br/>
