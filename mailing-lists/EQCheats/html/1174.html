<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011183502">acctually...you can get good stuff and not be twinked.  I had a gnome that <br/>
got to lvl 6 or 7 (I think) did a lot of fishing, paid for brewing, used <br/>
that to master pottery and did that (this is back when they worked to get <br/>
money from NPCs) and was able to buy lotsa good stuff that ppl lvls 18-20 <br/>
wanted.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, it took a loot of time and it was boreing and I gave up the <br/>
character cause everyone called me a twinker (grrr).<br/>
<br/>
well, I guess a lvl 1 might be able to do the same some other way, but I <br/>
doubt it.<br/>
