 </span></blockquote>I disagree on the first emulator being a bunch Of BS.<br/>
The guys that were doing are the same ones that did<br/>
it for Ultima Online. They posted the messages and<br/>
such that were sent back and forth between them and<br/>
Verant. They had screenshots of the thing in action.<br/>
And, according to them, they had been working on it<br/>
since the game was in beta because a few of them<br/>
managed to get into the testing of EQ. Origin had<br/>
left out a vital line in their software agreement<br/>
that allowed them to LAWFULLLY make the emulator.<br/>
Verant, howver, covered themseleves in their<br/>
agreement, which youhave to agree to to play the<br/>
game. The emulator was not a full functional thing<br/>
anyway... nor is the one for Ultima Onlline. For<br/>
instance.... none of the NPC quests were there... you<br/>
would have had to make your own via an editor like in<br/>
Ultima Online Emulator. The way they talked, EQ and<br/>
Ultima Online were both about the same as far as<br/>
making the emulators. I believed them. And, I just<br/>
think it is a matter of time before someone does it<br/>
just li9ke with Ultima Online. Someone will release<br/>
one not caring about Verant&#39;s threats.<br/>
