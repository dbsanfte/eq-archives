I would not count this as consistent &quot;cheat&quot; without further testing.  I<br/>
have heard of this many times, but personally haven&#39;t been charmed but once,<br/>
and that was when I first started playing the game.  But I was once in a<br/>
group where every person got charmed but me, the monk in the party tried the<br/>
sitting trick and it successfully slowed her down.  Enough that she didn&#39;t<br/>
cause too many problems for the rest of the party.  But I don&#39;t think it<br/>
canceled the charm.  I feel that further testing is required.  Maybe a<br/>
couple of people on the list with the ability to charm can try it with some<br/>
friends?<br/>
<br/>
On a related note:  On that foray against the evil eye....  The other 5<br/>
people all got charmed in our group...  they started attacking while I was<br/>
AFK, so I got there halfway through the battle.  I unloaded all my manna at<br/>
the eye and successfully killed it.  I got an experience message, but nobody<br/>
else in the group did.  My current theory is that once you are charmed, you<br/>
count as a monster, and won&#39;t get the experience message for any group kills<br/>
during that time.  Unfortunately, this is also hard to test.  Unfortunately<br/>
that mishap resulted in the death of more than half our party... but when I<br/>
looked at my XP-o-meter, I got a huge chunk of XP from the fight (if my<br/>
theory is correct, I got all of the XP)<br/>

When fighting evil eyes in the gorge the other night, I hit the sit button<br/>
while charmed somehow. The result was canceling the charm, which allowed me<br/>
to continue with my battle. I managed to do this repeatedly throughout the<br/>
night. This could be a coincidence or an actual bug in the game, I&#39;m not<br/>
sure. Since I felt it was cheating, I quit doing it and left the gorge;<br/>
after all, I only wanted another Polished Bone Bracer ;)<br/>
