<div id="ygrps-yiv-917573392">I have something similar happen with my game. I can&#39;t remember the details of the fight(s), but I do<br/>
remember it happened one time zoneing from Qeynos to Q. Hills.<br/>
<br/>
my arrow keys (forward and back) no longer move my character, instead they scroll through the text I<br/>
have typed in before. (/ignore &lt;whoever&gt;, &quot;sorry, guys I died and will be back as soon as I mem my<br/>
spells and run back&quot;, etc.) Don&#39;t remember if it affected hotkeys, shortcuts &lt;i&gt; &lt;s&gt; etc. My cursor<br/>
gets locked into mouselook mode, so I can&#39;t control my cursor to click on stuff.<br/>
<br/>
the keypad movement keys were unaffected but I never use them, so they weren&#39;t really of much help.<br/>
I would usually have to camp and comeback for it to go away. Although, once it cleared up when I<br/>
zoned again.<br/>
<br/>
I never reported it or anything... usually it happened when my group needs me so I would just try to<br/>
get it resolved and get back to nuking. By the time things would calm down so I could report it, i<br/>
would have forgotten about it already.<br/>

&gt; &gt;       &gt;Heres the problem we encountered and I need to know If anyone else<br/>
&gt; &gt;has seen<br/>
&gt; &gt;       &gt;this.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;       &gt;3 of our casters, 2 clerics and 1 enchanter  lost the ability to<br/>
&gt; &gt;cast spells<br/>
&gt; &gt;       &gt;during the melee.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;       I was playing with a friend yesterday, in Befallen too, and at one<br/>
&gt; &gt;time my keyboard went out. I hit the hotkeys but NOTHING happened. I could<br/>
&gt; &gt;talk, but couldn&#39;t &lt;i&gt;nventory, &lt;a&gt;ttack, etc.  I had to /exit. And then<br/>
&gt; &gt;log<br/>
&gt; &gt;again.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Same thing has happened to me, my brother and several friends. We all<br/>
&gt; submitted /bug reports about it, and that was the last we ever heard of the<br/>
&gt; problem. It still continues to happen though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We all play on Bertoxxulous.<br/>
