<b>Subject:</b> RE: possible big cheat for EQ.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-20374010">Hey, the two monitors is an interesting idea... Win 98 supports dual<br/>
monitors, I&#39;ve seen it done back in Beta when we were testing it.... I also<br/>
work coding programs for DINPACS systems, which often use 2 or more HIGH<br/>
(2400x2000) res monitors... Now, given the way EQ works, I DOUBT that EQ<br/>
would come up on one screen and the other would be the rest of the desktop,<br/>
but it MIGHT be possible to get to work, I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone tried this?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I wonder if you could write a program that would send a windows<br/>
message to EQ that would minimize or &#39;restore&#39; (take to a smaller window)<br/>
EQ. Now, THAT might be worth investigating... Anyone tried this? I could<br/>
probably figure out a way to find the handle for the EQ window and have a<br/>
program runing in the background automatically send it a restore message<br/>
after EQ loads... Wouldn&#39;t that be cool.... <br/>

I think one thing that ppl are ignoreing is that EQ logs you off if you <br/>
alt-tab out, and that your computer all but freezes up...but whatever.<br/>
<br/>
also there doesn&#39;t seem to be any way to float anything above EQ while in <br/>
game (I&#39;ve tried ICQ&#39;s floating thingy, didn&#39;t work).  so you&#39;d have to <br/>
write a hack to over come this and I&#39;m guessing that would be entirely <br/>
client side...either that or have 2 monitors ;)<br/>
<br/>
so even if cheat programs were developed (yeah right) than how would you <br/>
even get to them?<br/>
