<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285306676">Aaaaahhhhh...never noticed...alhtough I haven&#39;t fought reavers since like<br/>
18th level, and i&#39;m 34 now. Thanks for the info...I wonder if the Skull of<br/>
J&#39;hen Tra is that this guy is lookin for? Doubt it, but it&#39;s the only item<br/>
of worth I&#39;ve ever gotten off these gnolls. A book and an eye...any clues on<br/>
this? There any named white gnolls out there in EK or Lake Rathe?<br/>

Was wondering if anyone has completed this quest, or knows where the White<br/>
One Eyed gnolls are? The white gnolls I know of are in Lake Rathe, the<br/>
Embalmers at night, and the Undead Reavers in NK. I don&#39;t think they have<br/>
one eye though...<br/>
<br/>
Any clues?<br/>
<br/>
Well the Gnol Reavers in EK and the Exhumed Gnolls in Lake Rathe do only<br/>
have one eye. If you look at their faces one is is poached.</div>
