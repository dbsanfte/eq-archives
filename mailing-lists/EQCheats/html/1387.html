<div id="ygrps-yiv-17314923">Well that is my automatic signature, and in no way do I intend on removing it for YOU, since you have been the only person to point it out. I really don&#39;t understand what your problem is, since it is at the BOTTOM of my messages, and NOTHING forces you to scroll down and read it, please do not publicly announce your pet peves to me...  If you notice many other ppl have a autosig, I could truly care less if it annoys you, my signature and all of it contents are staying, sorry+ACE-<br/>
