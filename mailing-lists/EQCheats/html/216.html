&gt; Hmm...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lets look at the comparisons, given the possible duals (with no<br/>
&gt; Lay-on-Hands)<br/>
&gt; Paladin with Fiery Avenger Vs. Monk?  Monk will win.<br/>
&gt; Paladin with Fiery Avenger Vs. Warrior? Warrior will probably win.<br/>
&gt; Paladin with Fiery Avenger Vs. Ranger? Probably a toss up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Necromancer vs any of those with any weapon..  Necro wins.  Heh.  Fact<br/>
is that Necros (and enchanters too believe it or not) own in PvP at<br/>
higher levels (low levels too for necros).  I admit it too..  Paladins<br/>
suck at higher lvls.  No where near the tanks that monks or warriors<br/>
are.  No where near the healers that clerics are.  The fiery avenger<br/>
kinda brings them back up to standard.  But in no means does it make<br/>
them invincible.</div>
