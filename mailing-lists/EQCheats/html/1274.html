<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971984661">yes, both are off the undead knight, someone said that he does harm touch,<br/>
which isnt true, but on occasion he will get a pet summoned, which dies<br/>
easy.  i&#39;ve been camping this room alot lately, and you need a mid 20&#39;s<br/>
group i&#39;d say, healer type is nice.  make sure the room downstairs is also<br/>
camped (bar room), or you will get all those spawns too (they attack<br/>
through the floor).  if you have to take care of both tower room and bar<br/>
room, its hectic, but a mid 20 group can do it as long as there are 2<br/>
healer types, druid and cleric is good, and a burner makes things go<br/>
smoother.<br/>
<br/>
the mantle is dropped every time, the tunic is a very rare drop, i would<br/>
say 1 in 10 is a fair ratio, and he the knight spawns every 1-1.5 hour i<br/>
think, never really noticed.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bloodstained Mantle and Bloostained Tunic, both off the Undead Knight in<br/>
&gt; Unrest? If so, what level party you need (I have heard prolly around 26-30?)<br/>
&gt; to take him down? And how rare are the drops off him?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, Polished Bone Hoops, same info needed. Level, zone, mob...etc...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
