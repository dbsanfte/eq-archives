<b>Subject:</b> RE: possible big cheat for EQ.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028895113">Nope, I have a Riva TNT and a matrox Mystique.  When I enable both monitors<br/>
and play EQ, the second monitor is disabled for Alt-Tabs and such.  However,<br/>
if you move a program like Clock over to the second display, BEFORE you<br/>
start EQ, it does stay there during game play.  But programs liek ICQ return<br/>
to the system tray on the primary display, and you can&#39;t see anything.<br/>
<br/>
You also can&#39;t move your mouse to the second display.  Depending of which<br/>
way to set your screen to stretch, you can&#39;t move beyond the boundaries of<br/>
the game during play.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure about the program thing (to minimise), and I haven&#39;t tried the <br/>
2 monitors...I may be able to but I doubt it (I don&#39;t think any of my <br/>
friends would loan me a moniter for a game).  Do you need a 2nd graphics <br/>
card for a 2nd moniter?  I&#39;m guessing you would need one in which case I <br/>
can&#39;t do it anyway b/c I have no open slots and my current card is bult into<br/>
<br/>
the motherboard (darn Compaq).<br/>
<br/>
About that program...what does Alt-Tab do?  wouldn&#39;t it be just about the <br/>
same as a program sending the EQ window a command to minimise?  in that case<br/>
<br/>
the result would be the same (logging out, computer locking up mostly, etc).<br/>
<br/>
  But it might be different.<br/>
<br/>
anyone have ideas?<br/>
