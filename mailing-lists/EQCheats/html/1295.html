<b>Subject:</b> Q&#39;s about Secret Passages in Neriak + Spoiler <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939514093">Anyone know what the button in the 3rd gate library does? It&#39;s on the 2nd <br/>
floor of the library. Just turn around and look at the far wall towards some <br/>
animal heads. That&#39;s how you know you&#39;re near the correct spot. The button <br/>
is an off colored spot on the wall across from the animal heads.<br/>
<br/>
Also, does anyone know how to open secret door that&#39;s disguised as a firepot <br/>
in 3rd gate (it&#39;s near the water at one of the dead ends out by the water)? <br/>
Pick locks will not work on it at all. I&#39;ve had some very high lvl rogues <br/>
try it. You need some sort of key to open it. Rumor has it, that the thex <br/>
mallet may be the key to open it. There&#39;s also some speculation that the <br/>
keys you get in crushbone that are useless may be the key to open it.<br/>
<br/>
My spoiler is for the Shining Star of Life - This quest begins in North <br/>
Qeynos at the Temple of Life with Astead Wemor.  This is one of the few real <br/>
cleric quests Bolaldil Balmsoul (Lvl 21 Cleric as of this note) has seen.  <br/>
To begin, hail Astead.  Advise him that you wish to provide service to the <br/>
temple, and are willing to travel afar. He will tell you to go to Rivervale <br/>
to find the herbalist, Kizzie Mintopp, to obtain a desperately needed <br/>
ingedient (Honey Jum). He also tells you to tell her that you are from the <br/>
Temple of Life.<br/>
  Once you reach Rivervale, and locate Kizzie, give her a hail and the catch <br/>
phrase. She tells you that you were not due for another week.  She also <br/>
tells you that she cannot make the Honey Jum because Joogl Honeybugger has <br/>
not delivered any honeycomb to her due to his injuries. Joogl, she says, can <br/>
be found in his burrow just outside of Rivervale. Where exactly Kizzie does <br/>
not say.<br/>
  After you locate Joogl Honeybugger in the Misty Thicket, give him a <br/>
bandage to receive faction and information on how to harvest three <br/>
honeycombs and five gold pieces needed to satisfy Kizzie Mintopp&#39;s needs.  <br/>
Joogl tells you that the Bixie Drones carry the honeycomb.  This is true, <br/>
but in fact, regular Bixies also drop honeycomb as well.<br/>
  Once you have the three honeycomb and five gold, give them to Kizzie<br/>
Mintopp.  You receive another faction adjustment and the Honey Jum. Return <br/>
to the Temple of Life in North Qeynos.  Give the Honey Jum to Astead Wemor. <br/>
You get another faction adjustment and some money, but you are not done yet. <br/>
Astead Wemor gives you a unique potion designed to cure a madness particular <br/>
to a farmer named Lempeck Hargrin.  Astead tells you that Lempeck Hargrin <br/>
can be found in the Western Plains of Karana between the river and the crop <br/>
fields. Astead also bids you to hurry before it is too late. You find <br/>
Lempeck Hargrin in his farmhouse in the area noted by Astead Wemor. Give the <br/>
potion to Lempeck to cure him. You receive another faction change, and a No <br/>
Drop Scythe which cannot be used by a cleric. Take the Scythe back to Astead <br/>
Wemor. Upon receiving the Scythe, Astead Wemor gives you yet another faction <br/>
adjustment, cash, and the end prize, the Shining Star of Life (1h Blunt, <br/>
damage: 6, Delay: 28, Casts Clense, Useable by clerics and paladins of all <br/>
races). He also tells you where to go when you need to recharge this weapon. <br/>
The clense effect will cancel negative effects which you are suffering from <br/>
such as disease or poison.</div>
