<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824051826">Hrm...this is with EQ? You used two monitors and played EQ, and could get to<br/>
the second screen? What kind of cards did you have, and would I need to go<br/>
from Win98 to NT (I have 95, 98, NT 4 server and workstation, and Beta 3 or<br/>
4 of 2000 I think, I forget which) to get this to work? I&#39;m really intrested<br/>
in if you had to have two 3dfx cards or just one plus another video that<br/>
wasn&#39;t 3dfx.<br/>

&gt;Nope, I have a Riva TNT and a matrox Mystique.  When I enable both monitors<br/>
&gt;and play EQ, the second monitor is disabled for Alt-Tabs and such.  <br/>
&gt;However,<br/>
&gt;if you move a program like Clock over to the second display, BEFORE you<br/>
&gt;start EQ, it does stay there during game play.  But programs liek ICQ <br/>
&gt;return<br/>
&gt;to the system tray on the primary display, and you can&#39;t see anything.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You also can&#39;t move your mouse to the second display.  Depending of which<br/>
&gt;way to set your screen to stretch, you can&#39;t move beyond the boundaries of<br/>
&gt;the game during play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can move your mouse over to the other screen but ONLY if you adjust your<br/>
<br/>
settings under control panel - desktop - monitor. Then adjust your settings <br/>
for your desktop area. I had mine set to 2048 x 768 when I had 2 monitors <br/>
and 2 cards in, and you should be able to use both monitors. I know it works<br/>
<br/>
with Win NT, (I use it at work with the same settings) for drafting.<br/>
