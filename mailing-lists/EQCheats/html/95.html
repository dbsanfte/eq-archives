<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-602890217">As a fletcher I have been tracking the results of different combination of<br/>
arrow components. As any fletcher knows though is that there are over one<br/>
hundred different combinations. So, I have posted an excel spreadsheet with<br/>
what I have and hope that some of you other fletchers will help complete the<br/>
information. Any little bit would be great. You will need to navigate<br/>
through the menu, asher stuff| pcgames, to find it.<br/>
