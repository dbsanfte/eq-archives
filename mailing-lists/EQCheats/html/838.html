 Well, in my opinion, it SHOULD take this long to get these bad boys. I&#39;ve<br/>
 played a warrior and a shaman. I KNOW the value of SOW... If everyone had<br/>
 JBoots, the game would be toast. JBoots are one of the best items in the<br/>
 game. And, of course, I&#39;m shaded by my Shamanic Opinion.... <br/>

Boots?  We would be the masters of kiting and would still have teleport, <br/>
portal, evacuate and gate spells.  That would be way unbalanced.<br/>
