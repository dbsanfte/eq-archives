<div id="ygrps-yiv-875122400">Crude Stien is the stien that adds +15 CHA, right? Well, that one is off the<br/>
bouncers in Feerrott. No quest to get it, just need a big bad ass character<br/>
to take em out (they are lore, so I just went to Feerrott and looted one off<br/>
a corpse that a ncie Druid was willing to save for me ;-). That druid was<br/>
47th level, by the way. And the bouncers still resisted snare alot...<br/>

Ok Next question.. (thanks for the help btw)<br/>
<br/>
The Crude Stein has a decent bonus ratio also.. So I was wondering how does<br/>
one get this ? is this like the glowing stein that it takes a certain race<br/>
or so to do it ? .. I will finish the glowing stein tonight, but I want to<br/>
complete the Crude Stein soon also.. Is it possible to equip a stein in both<br/>
hands ? Like the crude stein in one and the glowing stein in the other ? ..<br/>
thats my goal.. but non the less.. id like em both still..<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
