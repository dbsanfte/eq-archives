but Nick, As per MY lawyer&#39;s request (who happens to be my uncle :) i don&#39;t go out of my way to find a lawyer )  I emailed him your first whine note, and now your second, as well as your response to my note, and everyone elses response to your note, and he informs me that you are pretty much full of shit (highly technical term i know, let me know if you need it broken down into simpler words)  And that I alone could sue you for major harrassment and public defamation for your one little note.  I wouldn&#39;t go sticking your nose in the air as if your shit doesn&#39;t stink like everyone elses.  At least Sean has morals.<br/>

  Well, I warned this person to stop emailing me.  As per my lawyers request I had warned him before not to email me or a proof reading fee would be exempted to his university/his parents.  He sent me an email this morning that was lengthy and I didn&#39;t even bother reading it.  Again (to the people of the list), do not send me private emails.  Mr. Clark is going to have to go to small claims court because of his actions. </span></blockquote></div>
