<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490319018">Hi!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Not entirely true. Being ex-military, and being an ex-intelligence type, and<br/>
&gt; having been trained/shown how to do it, cracking network protocol and<br/>
&gt; network protocol encryption is not as hard as you think it is. But don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; me wrong. It&#39;s not something that you can just hop on a computer and learn<br/>
&gt; overnight or in just a few hours. You have to know what you&#39;re looking for,<br/>
&gt; and then, just maybe then, you can figure it out on your own. It would take<br/>
&gt; months, or possibly even years to learn how on your own.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As i know, there are already alot of cryptic algorithms exists, which<br/>
make cryptoanalytical method of cracking fairly ineffective. Of course,<br/>
most of them illegal to use without approval of agencies like FBI in USA<br/>
or FAPSI in my country. Still, if consider server and client as &quot;closed<br/>
systems&quot; (unauthorized access is impossible), it is easy to implement<br/>
coding what will make cryptoanalytical hack almost impossible. But, i<br/>
dont think EQ uses really good crypting for its protocol. First, it is<br/>
very restricted in many countries, and EQ is international product which<br/>
supposed to be legal in all countries. Second, good crypting is very<br/>
time-consuming, and EQ server have traffic around 1MB/sec. It is<br/>
impossible to encrypt 1MB per second with any serious algorithm. I<br/>
believe it is using something like XOR with random-seeded bitstrings, or<br/>
just CRC protection, to make his traffic safe. It is enough to force<br/>
most &quot;hackers&quot; to use debugger on EQ&#39;s exe instead of much easer parsing<br/>
of network data. And i never seen games using anything more serious than<br/>
such forms of protection.</div>
