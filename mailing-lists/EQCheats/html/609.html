&gt; Good point -- a typical work year is 2080 hours.  I did a /play and I felt<br/>
&gt; like I was hit with a brick.  I clocked about 400 hours since the game<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with my life with 400 extra hours?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Needless to say, I quit the game this week.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow!  I guess we could watch the average 23 hours of TV per week like the<br/>
rest of the country does... Hmmm... wait... that&#39;s MORE!!<br/>
<br/>
Or, we could work an extra 20 hours a week??<br/>
<br/>
I don;t know about the rest of you, but I work to live, I do NOT live to<br/>
work!  I live to have FUN because that is what *I* believe life is all<br/>
about... Having a GOOD time, a GOOD life, and trying to help others do the<br/>
same thing!  But again, that is MY thoughts and opinions, but it&#39;s also my<br/>
life...<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to hear you are quiting Tony!<br/>
