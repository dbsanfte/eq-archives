<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201068535">Well, a couple of things here.<br/>
<br/>
Aye, you need two cards to do two monitors. I imagine it wouldn&#39; work<br/>
without some extensive setup work, as everything maximized on two monitors<br/>
I&#39;ve seen takes up both monitors, it&#39;s just real wide. Windows sees it as<br/>
one monitor, but I think it can distinguigh between the two. Again, I&#39;m not<br/>
sure (feels like I&#39;m shooting holes in my own idea...heh).<br/>
<br/>
Second, you CAN run programs behind EQ, AND I haven&#39;t figured out to see<br/>
them without exiting EQ. Ever hit your Windows key and hear your start bar<br/>
in the background pop up? I shut down my PC on accident about 12 or 13 times<br/>
before I finally pulled the 102-104 keys off my damn keyboard. I&#39;ve also<br/>
exiting EQ and found 10 Explorer Windows up cuz I hit that damn Start key<br/>
and DIDN&#39;T shit down, just started up a bunch of other stuff. I just don&#39;t<br/>
know how to GET to it without shutting down.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas people? <br/>

I&#39;m not sure about the program thing (to minimise), and I haven&#39;t tried the <br/>
2 monitors...I may be able to but I doubt it (I don&#39;t think any of my <br/>
friends would loan me a moniter for a game).  Do you need a 2nd graphics <br/>
card for a 2nd moniter?  I&#39;m guessing you would need one in which case I <br/>
can&#39;t do it anyway b/c I have no open slots and my current card is bult into<br/>
<br/>
the motherboard (darn Compaq).<br/>
<br/>
About that program...what does Alt-Tab do?  wouldn&#39;t it be just about the <br/>
same as a program sending the EQ window a command to minimise?  in that case<br/>
<br/>
the result would be the same (logging out, computer locking up mostly, etc).<br/>
<br/>
  But it might be different.<br/>
<br/>
anyone have ideas?<br/>
