<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057396854">The Dark Elf SK on Level 1 of Befallen took an hour and a half to spawn?<br/>
Damn... I haven&#39;t been to Befallen in awhile. They musta changed it. I used<br/>
to sit on the bed next to his spawn point and he&#39;d spawn every 10 minutes...<br/>
And, this was 2 months ago...haven&#39;t been back in 2 months<br/>

&gt;Absolutely not true.  First of all, I think you mean the Troll <br/>
&gt; &gt;Shadowknight in Befallen, which has the BBC.  He spawns past some &gt;spikes<br/>
<br/>
&gt;on the 3rd floor of befallen.  If you mean the Ogre, it&#39;s &gt;still not true.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve had the TSK spawn right next to me, with the &gt;BBC in hand, at least 3 <br/>
&gt;times. I&#39;ve had the Ogre SK spawn on top of &gt;my head and drop the barbed <br/>
&gt;armplates.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So there is definitely no anticamp in Befallen.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>All the anticamp code does is slow down respawn rates, (making the wait <br/>
longer than normal and thereby trying to discourage camping). It doesn&#39;t <br/>
stop the spawning totally. Try timing some creatures respawn rates sometime <br/>
in an area where you suspect the codinge has been used.<br/>
I timed various creatures in Befallen where I suspected the coding was used,<br/>
<br/>
and found that respawn rates were a lot slower when you were in the radius <br/>
of the &quot;sphere of anti-camping&quot;. I would like to stress something here as <br/>
well - this DOES NOT mean the anti-camping coding is used everywhere! It&#39;s <br/>
used in just a FEW areas that I&#39;m aware of. One place I found it used, was <br/>
the SK room that has the first key. When I camped that area to test my <br/>
theory, it took well over an hour and a half for the SK to respawn. When I <br/>
stayed about 2 rooms over from the SK room, I found that the SK would <br/>
respawn every 45 mins to an hour.<br/>
<br/>
I did this for 2 weeks to test out the rumors I had heard, and also after <br/>
having read an interview with Brad (I believe) about camping, and how they <br/>
supposively wouldn&#39;t use any anticamping coding. I also had a bunch of other<br/>
<br/>
players keep track/time as well.<br/>
<br/>
IF, and I stress IF, there isn&#39;t any anti-camping coding, (and I believe <br/>
that there IS, and I could be wrong) I&#39;d like to know why I was told by <br/>
several GM&#39;s and Guides that it does indeed exist, (sorry, no screenshots to<br/>
<br/>
back this up as it was at least a month ago I was told) and why there&#39;s an <br/>
uncanny, and very noticeable pattern by myself and other players as well who<br/>
<br/>
helped me out? PERHAPS this coding has since been removed, which is highly <br/>
possible; there&#39;s been many patches since I last tested this theory out. I&#39;m<br/>
<br/>
not sure if it has been removed because I don&#39;t camp. I just did it this one<br/>
<br/>
time to test out what I had heard.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 coppers worth<br/>
