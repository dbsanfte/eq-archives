<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062945856">Aradune is *NOT* a GM.  He has stated numerous times on the EQVault message<br/>
boards that Aradune is the avatar of the goddess Karana.  So think of him<br/>
as an NPC (sort of) with Brad McQuaid in charge.  I personally think it<br/>
adds a new dimension to the game, and that there should be more characters<br/>
in the game like him.  So whether or not he &quot;earned&quot; his items is a moot<br/>
point.</div>
