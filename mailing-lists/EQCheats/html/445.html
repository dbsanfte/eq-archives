<div id="ygrps-yiv-991818175">Heh.. most of this information is correct.  However, I&#39;m gonna tweak it<br/>
a little to what i know is true.. Like i said.. most is correct though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Two classes really shine here since it is an Undead dungeon: Clerics and Paladins.  &lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Three classes shine.  Necros are always good to have.. especially<br/>
against undead.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Levels 21-24 can safely camp a room on the third floor(Lots of skel types, Carrion ghouls, specials)&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are two main rooms on the third floor.  The bar room.  and the<br/>
hand room.  Both have specials.  and of course the balcony which just<br/>
has some nice pops.. nothing special there though<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Levels 30+ can begin to camp in the basement(Ghost, dark terrors, mortuary fungus, lots of other nasties I don&#39;t want to mess with)&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ehh.. the basement isn&#39;t THAT bad.  I&#39;ve seen as low as 21 there before.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t recommend going there before 25 though.  Hags, greater dark<br/>
boned, werebats, and barbed bones frequent the basement.  Then..  there<br/>
is a secret hallway that leads to the other crap.. the really bad stuff.<br/>
(the ghost, fungus, dark terrors and crap)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; FS weapons - Carrion ghouls &lt;   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dry bones.. barbed bones.. greater dark bone (also have FS)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Small ringmail - Carrion ghouls, barbed bone skels&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dark bones..  ghouls also have small ringmail<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Small bronze plate - Dry bone skels<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the occasional greater dark bone and barbed bone will have small bronze<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Major loot              Mob                             Auction Price<br/>
&gt; Bloodstained Tunic      Knight of Unrest(rare drop)     400pp+ <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(not sure what server he&#39;s on but the BS tunic doesn&#39;t go for much more<br/>
than 250 on mine)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Bloodstained Mantle     Knight of Unrest                        80pp<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(i got my BS mantle for 25 plat.. going is usually 50 on my server)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
His list of mobs was mostly correct.. however..  monks are harder than<br/>
carr ghouls. the reanimated hand is easier than monks.  i&#39;d rank the<br/>
undead barkeep up there on the danger just because he has a &quot;killer&quot;<br/>
backstab on him..  i&#39;ve seen him do 150+ on a backstab.  be careful<br/>
around him<br/>
<br/>
All in all this guys description of unrest was pretty good.  I just<br/>
wanted to add a little info to it.. and correct what i knew was wrong. <br/>
I&#39;m sure there are other things people can add too.</div>
