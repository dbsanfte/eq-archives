<div id="ygrps-yiv-876392519">I felt like writing back about being pathetic...I don&#39;t think it&#39;s my fault <br/>
that the economy, or lack there of, of EQ is messed up.  if you wanted to <br/>
you could take a completly untwinked lvl 1 character, run mail quests for a <br/>
while to get money, then buy anything you wanted to buy.  so in theroy you <br/>
could have a very low lvl character (you&#39;d gain XP from questing to I&#39;m not <br/>
going to say lvl 1) with a Oracle robe, staff of writhing, stien of moggok, <br/>
glowing black stone, et cetera that earned every last CP of it on his own.<br/>
