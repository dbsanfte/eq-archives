<b>Subject:</b> Re: Making Plat <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-677620478">Bat wings, along with other components that are required for various spells,<br/>
can be purchased for sure in the Erudin Mage Tower.  I usually drop in there<br/>
with my druid to pick up a ton of fish scales (for underwater breathing) and<br/>
cat&#39;s eye agate (for my pure casting friends who need it for shielding<br/>
spells).  I honestly have found every regeant anyone has ever needed in that<br/>
place!<br/>
<br/>
Money at earlier levels is always a little tough to get.  Once you hit about<br/>
20-25, the mobs you&#39;re fighting will start to drop plat on a regular basis.<br/>
I think one of the richest mobs in the game has to be Hill Giants so far,<br/>
usually carrying between 10 and 70 plat (which auto-splits nicely in a big<br/>
group).  Now I am sure Vox and Nagafen might be loaded too, but they are<br/>
usually bursting with really cool weapons and other rare items. =)<br/>
