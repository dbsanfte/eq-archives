<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667976573">I&#39;m looking for methods in general to raise faction with the Blood <br/>
Sabres, the guild in the Qeynos Aqueducts. Specifically, I would like <br/>
to know if there is something to do with the &quot;Busted Prayer Beads&quot; <br/>
that Brother Estle drops. I suspect I need Whole Beads to do the <br/>
other quest, but I am wondering if I can do something with them to <br/>
raise Blood Sabre faction.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any insight you are able to provide me/us.</div>
