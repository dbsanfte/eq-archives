<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631510049">Crown of King Tranix? Anyone know how to obtain this item? King Tranix is<br/>
the head gnoll in BB, isn&#39;t he? I have heard him once before last night,<br/>
hollering back when I played a young warrior. I was on my way through BB<br/>
last night with my shaman when I heard Tranix hollering, I stopped, and he<br/>
hit me frm behind. Quick fight, but he didn&#39;t have anything but a bronze<br/>
mace (was green to this 28th shaman). Any clues? Suppose it could have<br/>
something to do with the named gnolls out in EK?</div>
