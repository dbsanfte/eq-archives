<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612342786">Anyone know where a lvl 9 cleric could hunt and level REALLY fast.  I know<br/>
in N Ro i can kill bugs (scarabs and tarantulas) but they give shit for<br/>
loot.  I have partied with a lvl 10 warrior and lvl 10 bard and kicked ass<br/>
at derv camps, but it&#39;s too much work finding people willing to party to<br/>
derv hunt.  I was wondering if there was anywhere that was REALLY easy to<br/>
lvl at, or like a place where only Mummys spawn, that would work the best.<br/>
I heard HighPass was good, but from others i heard it&#39;s for lvl 15-25<br/>
people.  I also heard Lake Rathe was the best, but I&#39;d have to party, and<br/>
hardly any people are there.  Any info?</div>
