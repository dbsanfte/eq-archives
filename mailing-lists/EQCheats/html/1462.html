<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-721054878">Does anyone know if there&#39;s a way to move one or all of your chars to a <br/>
different world server?  I&#39;ve noticed that when a new world server goes up <br/>
all the sudden there&#39;s 500+ people playing on it.  I wouldn&#39;t have thought <br/>
that within the space of an hour or two of the new world server going online <br/>
that that many new players would start there or old players would start a new <br/>
char on it. <br/>
THANKS</div>
