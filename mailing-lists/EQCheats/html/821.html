What would probably happen (in a counter suit) would be not much... Mental<br/>
anguish won&#39;t fly, and you can&#39;t recover lost wages from having to go to<br/>
court...<br/>
<br/>
BUT, he COULD sue him for maliciously filing a lawsuit... But he would only<br/>
have a 50/50 chance of winning that one if it was a one time thing and done<br/>
in small claims court...  Besides which it would cost him money to FILE that<br/>
counter claim (which you recover only if you win).<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry about it though... There will be no suit, and if there is,<br/>
the judge will have a really good laugh with the bailiff and others in the<br/>
courtroom...  Right before he dismisses the case and chews the plaintiff out<br/>
for having wasted the courts time+ACE-<br/>
<br/>
(in case people are wondering, yes, I have spent many hours in Small Claims<br/>
court on several issues myself (usually collections), and at the same time<br/>
observing many more issues - Oh, and I was only the defendant once, which I<br/>
also won)<br/>

+AD4APg- That is the part that truely amazes me. Besides the fact that he actually<br/>
told the<br/>
+AD4APg- entire world about it as well. Lemac&#39;s email details actually what his<br/>
lawyer should<br/>
+AD4APg- have told him to the first place.<br/>
+AD4APg-<br/>
+AD4APg- I think all this sean guy has to do to win the case now is just walk in to<br/>
court with<br/>
+AD4APg- printouts of this thread. Might even be evidence for a counter suit.<br/>
(Mental anguish<br/>
+AD4APg- and  lost wages seems to be a popluar cry for money) It would be<br/>
interesting (once<br/>
+AD4APg- again if we cared) to find out how that would turn out if it actually ever<br/>
happened.<br/>

+AD4APg- Lemme get this straight, someone was sending him email that<br/>
+AD4APg-  he didn&#39;t want (spam?)<br/>
+AD4APg- and in an effort to stop it told the guy that he would<br/>
+AD4APg-  charge him a fee for reading<br/>
+AD4APg- his email. THEN doesn&#39;t read the email that was sent to him<br/>
+AD4APg-  and is planning on going<br/>
+AD4APg- to small claims court to get the fee? THEN he spams us about<br/>
+AD4APg-  it like we cared?<br/>
+AD4APg- <br/>
+AD4APg- I agree with the others on the list, Nick is silly indeed.<br/>
+AD4APg-  Amazes me how people<br/>
+AD4APg- refuse to use something as simple as a killist and think<br/>
+AD4APg-  this method would be a<br/>
+AD4APg- better solution.<br/>
+AD4APg- <br/>
+AD4APg- +AD4APg- Nick wrote:<br/>
+AD4APg- +AD4APg-<br/>
+AD4APg- +AD4APg- Well, I warned this person to stop emailing me.  As per my<br/>
+AD4APg- +AD4APg- lawyers request I had<br/>
+AD4APg- +AD4APg- warned him before not to email me or a proof reading fee<br/>
+AD4APg- +AD4APg- would be exempted to his<br/>
+AD4APg- +AD4APg- university/his parents.  He sent me an email this morning<br/>
+AD4APg- +AD4APg- that was lengthy and I<br/>
+AD4APg- +AD4APg- didn&#39;t even bother reading it.  Again (to the people of<br/>
+AD4APg- +AD4APg- the list), do not send me<br/>
+AD4APg- +AD4APg- private emails.  Mr. Clark is going to have to go to small<br/>
+AD4APg- +AD4APg- claims court because of his actions.<br/>
