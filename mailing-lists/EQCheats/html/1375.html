&gt;    They are found on the Ogres in W. Karana. It is<br/>
&gt; on the Ogre Shaman and above if I recall, I wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; paying attention which mob we got it from. I have <br/>
&gt; one and like it very much. Not sure on the value <br/>
&gt; though.<br/>

&gt; These ogres have lots of good stuff it seems.  What<br/>
&gt; Lvl are they?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I am a 30th Level Ranger and an Ogre Guard<br/>
(Shadowknight) did a bubble of damage to me (about 160<br/>
points)including his Harm Touch. I would imagine by<br/>
that they are about level 23 or so, low blue to me.<br/>
(these don&#39;t have much for loot though). I think the<br/>
Shamans were about 30 (wasn&#39;t paying much attention,<br/>
friend killed these) and Chief Goonda about 34th<br/>
level. The Chief hits quite hard. I got jumped by him<br/>
and he did over 80 points per swing, two swings a<br/>
round. <br/>
<br/>
  I was with a level 50 Wizard friend at the time, so<br/>
I don&#39;t know how hard they are in an average group. <br/>
