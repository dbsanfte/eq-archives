<div id="ygrps-yiv-878637142">Sorry, I was in a hurry and didn&#39;t disclose my source.  Brian Hook posted an<br/>
account of the encounter on the errangers list.  What I was saying is that<br/>
Hast denied that there was any treasure at the time.  I didn&#39;t say he didn&#39;t<br/>
tell anyone about it after the fact.  And how can you say that he alone<br/>
earned the loot of that MOB?  There were dozens of people there all helping<br/>
to kill the Archon and lesser critters that had been summoned.<br/>
Unfortunately, he did not even necessarily do the most damage, since GM<br/>
controlled NPC&#39;s are open for anyone to loot after they are killed.  Here is<br/>
Brian&#39;s post to the ranger list.<br/>
<br/>
From: &quot;Brian Hook&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bhook@...">bhook@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have some spare time this week, and as such I&#39;ve been doing some GM events<br/>
after hours on various servers (I was Morxxa Mangyfur the Werewolf in SK on<br/>
Tunare; the named Archon in Cazic-Thule on Cazic-Thule and Xegony; the<br/>
Undead Vizier on the chessboard on Cazic-Thule; Frumpy Darkpaw in<br/>
blackburrow on Cazic-Thule), and I&#39;ve learned some interesting things about<br/>
players in general.<br/>
<br/>
First, higher level players are weenies.  It&#39;s that simple.  The minute a<br/>
fight turns against them, they&#39;re zoning.  They&#39;re also generally very<br/>
stupid the minute something unexpected happens.  I was an Archon in<br/>
Cazic-Thule and while they were having a picnic in the lower throne room I<br/>
popped a justicar, herald, and a champion to liven things up for the<br/>
Winnebago crowd.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: If you are killed by a GM/possessed NPC, you do NOT lose exp!<br/>
<br/>
The zone freaked, had no idea what to do.  Some mid to high 40s showed up<br/>
and tried to take me out (they were a little, um, foolhardy), doing shouts<br/>
of &quot;I&#39;ll defeat him!&quot;, then -- get this -- sending in their pets ONE AT A<br/>
TIME.  There was a 50th necro and a 48th magician there, and their pets are<br/>
MEAN.  But they sent them in one at a time -- easy for me to deal with (I<br/>
was a 50th wizzie).  If both pets had come in, I would have been toast.<br/>
<br/>
Stupid stupid stupid.<br/>
<br/>
Some of them stormed in, expecting me to be about 35th level, and I nuked<br/>
them instantly.  So they started whining about it being &quot;unfair&quot;.  Someone<br/>
else in the zone started OOCing how this was &quot;ruining&quot; their evening because<br/>
all they wanted to do was get some rubicite and log.  Hearing things like<br/>
that makes me almost want to give up on the game (or its players).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, instead of getting organized, they hid in the courtyard.  Now, at<br/>
this point I had only a small contingent of bodyguards, but more important,<br/>
I only had THREE spells memorized -- Ice Comet, Conflag, and Frost Shock.<br/>
None of those can be cast very quickly.  Two good tanks, two clerics, and<br/>
one wizzie could have killed me EASILY, but they refused to come after me.<br/>
<br/>
As I was getting bored sitting with my gorillas in the throne room, I walked<br/>
out into the courtyard -- ALONE -- and proceeded to cast, killing a few<br/>
folks.  Now here&#39;s the even sadder part -- I walked out, alone, into a room<br/>
of about 20 players from 20th to 50th level, AND NO ONE BOTHERED ROOTING OR<br/>
STUNNING ME.  They tried to kill me, but instead of taking away my ability<br/>
to run or cast, they just tried to kill me quick.  Then, even stupider, two<br/>
of the casters chased me into the maze...alone.<br/>
<br/>
Dumb dumb dumb.<br/>
<br/>
So I ran back to lick my wounds and hid in the throne room, but they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t give chase.  I finally decided that it was time for me to die, so I<br/>
ran to the zone border to kill people looting their corpses (*evil grin*),<br/>
and finally I got dropped by a nice crowd.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so here&#39;s the loot I dropped: full set of rubicite and a shimmering<br/>
silk robe.<br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s the point where I get miffed: if a GM is killed in an event,<br/>
&quot;ninja looting&quot; can happen since ANYONE can loot the corpse, not the<br/>
person/party responsible for most damage.  A 50th wizard looted my corpse<br/>
and got ALL the rubi, then said he didn&#39;t find anything.  In addition, he<br/>
didn&#39;t distribute it to anyone else that was in the battle -- he kept it for<br/>
his guild (presumably).<br/>
<br/>
This really upset me, but because of a error on my part the two rubi bracers<br/>
that were dropped were in a backpack and couldn&#39;t be looted (except by me).<br/>
I then looted my corpse and awarded the bracers to a 42nd level wizzie that<br/>
played smart, fierce, and was RP the whole way.  I&#39;m still upset that the<br/>
50th wizzie didn&#39;t share the loot with the tanks that were there.<br/>
<br/>
At one point a 32nd level SK said something like &quot;Hey lizzie, I&#39;m wearing<br/>
your brother as a cloak!&quot; so I teleported to him and said &quot;HSSSS!  THEN YOU<br/>
DIE!&quot;  He was with a party of 30s camping near the Avatar room.  He RAN as<br/>
fast as he could, but his party put up a REAL good fight.  I mean GOOD.<br/>
They could have taken me down...almost.  I popped an Archon that wasted most<br/>
of them, but they nearly killed me.  But that party was smart, organized,<br/>
and BRAVE. I wish I had caught their names because I would have rewarded<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
That party of low 30s had more guts and smarts than a whole zone of 40s.<br/>
*sigh*<br/>
<br/>
In a way I think a lot of high level players have become used to how things<br/>
work, and once things stop working that way, they get really confused and<br/>
don&#39;t know what to do.  I think a PvP player would have done a LOT better.<br/>
<br/>
When I did the event on Cazic-Thule a 32nd level paladin (wearing bronze)<br/>
looted me, but since I had an ebony blade on me he gave it to a ranger that<br/>
had helped, and he also gave away the rubi pants to another tank.  Oh, and<br/>
on Cazic-Thule I buffed myself so that basically ONLY melee types could kill<br/>
me -- I gave myself insane magic resistance.  When I went down on CT server<br/>
I was taking about 400 points of damage per tick from 12 melee fighters,<br/>
which is EXACTLY what I wanted since I was dropping melee gear.  I was NOT<br/>
going to let a wizzie get a full set of rubi again.<br/>
<br/>
During another event, when I was the werewolf in SK, EVERYONE kept running<br/>
from me for the zone.  They kept trying to pull me to the zone so they could<br/>
fight then zone if they were getting hurt.  I wouldn&#39;t play that way, and<br/>
summoned a cyclops to help keep the zone clear (MWUHAHAHA).<br/>
<br/>
During the entire SK event, I killed only TWO people.  One of them was a<br/>
35th level dwarven warrior wearing bronze.  He fought bravely -- when I got<br/>
him to one bub of health, instead of running he stood up and went down<br/>
swinging.  Never cried for help, never tried to run.  And there was a crowd<br/>
around that didn&#39;t bother healing him either.  This warrior -- Aindolmar --<br/>
was an exemplary example of a brave, RPing player.  I rewarded him after my<br/>
death (I dropped a werewolf cloak and tunic for those that care to know)<br/>
specifically with a crafted breastplate.  He was wielding a BBC (I think)<br/>
and wearing bronze with no other twinks.  He wasn&#39;t in a guild that I could<br/>
tell, and was playing the game &quot;legit&quot; as it were.  More important, it<br/>
looked like he was playing in the spirit of the game, and I rewarded that.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, when I was the undead vizier on the chessboard, I was a 25th level<br/>
wizard.  A 15th level dwarven warrior (gotta love those dorfs!) named<br/>
Thrombrir kept trying to rally everyone to attack me.  A couple druids kept<br/>
running from me -- and they were 24th and 37th level respectively -- and<br/>
played like complete weenies.  This warrior ran up and started whacking on<br/>
me, ALONE.  No party, no backup, but I was conning BRIGHT RED to him, but he<br/>
didn&#39;t care.  Once again, he was not a twink -- he had on ringmail and some<br/>
rawhide -- and he was busy RPing like crazy.<br/>
<br/>
In that battled I dropped an FBR -- which a 42nd level necro looted, as if<br/>
she needed it (and I don&#39;t think she shared).  But I had already learned not<br/>
to reward people that looted my body -- too many selfish types.  So now I<br/>
keep track of players that are brave, smart (if that&#39;s in character),<br/>
untwinked, and role-playing, and I reward them appropriately after the<br/>
battle.<br/>
<br/>
Thrombrir received crafted gauntlets and one crafted bracer to replace his<br/>
rawhide.<br/>
<br/>
My point?  The lower level types played well, smart, and were having fun,<br/>
and the higher levels were busy screaming about things being unfair, were<br/>
doing dumb stuff, wouldn&#39;t leave the zone border, and wouldn&#39;t share loot.<br/>
Oh, and when high levels hear about an event via &quot;guildsay&quot;, they all come<br/>
to kill me so they can get the loot.  It&#39;s frustrating being a 25th level<br/>
mob and getting taken down by a 50th SK instead of a crowd of 20s.  But I<br/>
can&#39;t pick and choose who comes to kill me, so the best I can do is make<br/>
sure that the right people are rewarded.<br/>
<br/>
An explanation of my &quot;anti-twinking&quot; policy is probably in order for those<br/>
of you in a guild or that are twinked:<br/>
<br/>
- these events are role playing events.  All the ones I described I did<br/>
alone without any input from others, in an attempt to spice up the game for<br/>
some folks.  As such, I reward role players.<br/>
<br/>
- I don&#39;t reward twinks because, well, they don&#39;t need the stuff and often<br/>
don&#39;t appreciate what they received.  There was an 11th level wizzie wearing<br/>
an FBR at the chessboard, and I killed him THREE times =)<br/>
<br/>
- the players that really need the gear are often the ones least willing to<br/>
sacrifice their ideals (camping/twinking) to get the gear.  By rewarding<br/>
these players in events like these it spreads good word of mouth, and more<br/>
important, instills a sense of faith that they&#39;ve been doing the right thing<br/>
by RPing instead of power gaming.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I await your flames :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; In fact it was Brian Hook, formerly of Quake 3 fame who ran that event.<br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing that disgusts me is that that wizard told everyone that the Archon<br/>
&gt; &gt; dropped nothing.  It took everyone in the zone to deal with the mob&#39;s<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Archon, and this guy not only has the gall to keep the loot all to<br/>
&gt; &gt; himself, but also to lie about what he got.  Gives all wizards a bad<br/>
&gt; name,<br/>
&gt; &gt; oh, wait, they already have that, don&#39;t they.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ummm, what are you talking about?  Hast apparently DID tell people what<br/>
&gt; he got, since that was reported in the e-mail to which you replied.  And<br/>
&gt; while you might be magnaminous enough to share, most people actually<br/>
&gt; keep the stuff they earn.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Though I imagine Hast probably shared the rubicite, since it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; exactly stuff he can wear. =)<br/>

&gt; We cross our bridges when we come to them and burn them behind us,<br/>
