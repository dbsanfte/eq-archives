: Jboots being no drop I am not sure about. Seems to me<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Journeyman Boots are NoDrop because they have infinite charges.... in Beta,<br/>
people would join a party and pass the boots around to everyone in the<br/>
party. Obviously in Final there would be chance of the jboots being stolen,<br/>
but this would still cause a major imbalance. So, they are NoDrop.<br/>

: How about gnoll fangs...these used to be dropable...if you didnt want em<br/>
you<br/>
: tosed em on the ground or auctioned them away for a few silver each. Now,<br/>
: even though you dont want them, some force poseses you to hold on to them.<br/>
: The only way to get rid of them is by crusing them and uterly destroying<br/>
: them. What was wrong with buying/trading gnoll fangs? It was a good way<br/>
for<br/>
: you to raise qeynos faction. All you get is a moonstone worth a few silver<br/>
: which you could turn in for a BB stout worth a silver or 2 more. Hardly<br/>
good<br/>
: money after lvl 5!<br/>
<br/>
Fangs are NoDrop because they are one of the few ways to gain faction with a<br/>
couple of groups, and it defeats the purpose of the faction system if a rich<br/>
player can just buy them. You want faction, earn it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you have Rubi pieces, sell them or trade them now... it will never be as<br/>
valuable again as it will be in the next few days. Except of course for the<br/>
Rubicite Breastplate, this thing is the Black Lotus of EQ, hang on to that<br/>
for a long time, you&#39;ll probably be able to trade it for a car in about six<br/>
months :) </span></blockquote></div>
