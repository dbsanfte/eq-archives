<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147992971">There are now several types of silk to be made.  As you mentioned:<br/>
Silk- made by combining spider silk<br/>
Cured Silk- made by combining silk with heady kiola and other items<br/>
Glowing Silk- made by combining silk (or maybe cured silk) with enchanters<br/>
&quot;mana&quot; spells (vicious, purified, etc)<br/>
Shadowed Silk- made by combining silk (don&#39;t know which one) with necromancer<br/>
spells, and quest items<br/>
<br/>
Not sure of all the stuff found so far, but several of the web sites have the<br/>
instructions<br/>
