<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-41369192">Anyone actually done this part? I heard somewhere that two runes are off<br/>
normal EEs, and the 3rd is off Borxx. And, we killed him twice last night<br/>
and no Rune of the dwarves or whatever... *sigh*<br/>

Borxx is in RunnyEye...but I have NEVER seen him drop those Runes. They are <br/>
on Evil Eyes within RunnyEye, but havent seen them on her. Borxx drops the <br/>
lens for the Staff of the Observers Quest...you may want to hunt the EEs in <br/>
RunnyEye...I&#39;ve heard people shouting in the zone that they got runes off of<br/>
<br/>
them =)<br/>
