&gt;There&#39;s going to be class only armor for every different class.  The SK<br/>
&gt;quests are found in Mistmoore on the test server right now, however I have<br/>
&gt;not heard the specs of them.. but so far Rogue greaves, Ranger arms, etc<br/>
&gt;have been the same AC as rubi but the bracer was 1 less due to the <br/>
&gt;dexterity<br/>
&gt;buff.  I&#39;m certain the SK armor will be comparable.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I heard the same thing about the SK armor with one additional note - as of <br/>
the 10th, the SK armor quest was still broken. Go figure! 8p I hope they get <br/>
it fixed in time for the patch!</div>
