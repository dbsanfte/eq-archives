<b>Subject:</b> Staff segments <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080613159">I received a staff segment from a named bandit in East Karanas <br/>
along with a key.  I gave the key to the banker in HighHold Keep <br/>
and received a second staff segment.  I&#39;m now stuck.  Does <br/>
anyone know what to do with these segments, and what the end <br/>
result will be?  All the looking I&#39;ve done online just seems to <br/>
suggest that this is for a &quot;battle staff&quot; but no one seems to know <br/>
what to do to get it.  Rumor is that Lady McCabe in HighHold Keep <br/>
may be involved.<br/>
<br/>
Any and all help is appreciated.  I&#39;m getting tired of carrying them <br/>
around now that these darn things are NO DROP.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
