			Now, with all that said... does anybody else think<br/>
that necros are vastly<br/>
			overpowered?  They do FAR more damage than any other<br/>
class at all levels,<br/>
			they get pretty much every combat-utility spell that<br/>
any other class gets<br/>
			(like roots, disempowers, debuffs, etc), AND get the<br/>
ability to summon pets<br/>
			of higher level than any other class.<br/>
<br/>
			Not to be a huge bitch or anything.  I was fine with<br/>
that at first, but<br/>
			since EVERY recent patch has included further<br/>
buffing or tuning of the necro<br/>
			class it just seems to be getting a little absurd to<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
			Somebody tell me what the drawback is for their<br/>
class...  being hated by<br/>
			some NPCs?  After having played a troll for several<br/>
months and being KOS by<br/>
			EVERY npc north of innothule.... the necros have it<br/>
easy... like super-easy.<br/>
			Then they went and gimped the shamans and I just<br/>
honestly can&#39;t figure out<br/>
			what is going on.  I&#39;m guessing I&#39;m not seeing the<br/>
whole picture or<br/>
			something.... because recent events just haven&#39;t<br/>
made any sense to this<br/>
			stupid troll.<br/>

			Heart Flutter also drops a monsters AC by 47 and his<br/>
str by 17, hit it with<br/>
			the 1st lvl spell Siphon Str and that gives 10 more<br/>
Str to you.   So with<br/>
			the 3 It is Slowed, Weakened, Has its Ac dropped a<br/>
good bit you are doing<br/>
			about 400 points of damage in a min (The Dark Side<br/>
has a nice listing of the<br/>
			spells and what they do per tick).<br/>
