<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505989962">This would be great unless it is indeed server side lag, then there would be<br/>
no way to recreate it.  If you could get it to work repeatedly you could go<br/>

&gt; 2) He didn&#39;t move to follow until after the server knew where I was.<br/>
&gt; 3) I saved about 400 hitpoints of damage that I usually take during that<br/>
