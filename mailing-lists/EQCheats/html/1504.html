<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369524804">Verant Hates Druids. Or should I say Brad hates Druids. Just look at the AC<br/>
of our PoF Stuff. Our Boots are AC 6 where Clerics boots are AC 15. Shesh<br/>
Casters didn&#39;t lose any thing Rubi Yet they have Amor Quest in the Temple.<br/>
Oh Well. I still like my Druid, but could still use some better armor &<br/>
Weapons<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I have heard that druids will NOT be getting new stuff. They didn&#39;t loose it<br/>
with Rubi anyways. *shrug* I think Verant likes Druids less than Shamans ;-)</div>
