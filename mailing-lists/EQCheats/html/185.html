<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934719817">No I said in Beta it was NOT Paladin Only but I was told by a GM that it was intended to be paladin only and was going to be for the final release. Was always intend as paladin only just wasn&#39;t that way in beta. Guess we will have to wait till someone finds it to know for sure. I have not been able to get verification that it even remains in the game<br/>
