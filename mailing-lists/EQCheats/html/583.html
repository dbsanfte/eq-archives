<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884735350">Yes and it is a total failure and waste of time.  Look at smithing at one<br/>
time yes you could make money now you can get a full suit at cost. Almost<br/>
the same with fletching, Brewing and baking are almost a total waste since<br/>
you can buy cheaper from vendors, Tinkering doesn&#39;t even really work most of<br/>
its items are not cost effective or just don&#39;t work.  Jeweler making is the<br/>
ONLY skill so far that might work and that is only from the high end items<br/>
which take so much money to make only high level people can afford.  This<br/>
IMHO is a big strike against EQ and have been saying it since the early<br/>
beta.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	I have read at least two interviews with Brad McQuaid<br/>
describing how they view trade skills, and he has explicitly stated<br/>
in no uncertain terms that they do not want any of the player trade<br/>
skills to be implemented in such a way so as to allow for a player to<br/>
purchase items from vendors, execute their skill, and sell the<br/>
results of their efforts back to vendors at a profit.  The way they<br/>
want it to work is to offer players a &#39;sweet spot&#39; between what they<br/>
paid for materials and what NPC vendors charge for an equivilant item<br/>
to what a player can make themselves through their tradecraft.  This<br/>
way, a player is encouraged to sell their wares at a profit to other<br/>
players and not at a loss to vendors.<br/>
	In this way, they want to stimulate the &quot;player run economy&quot;<br/>
and not a &quot;kick back and make a bunch of plat just interacting with<br/>
vendors&quot;-type approach.  I&#39;m not saying I agree with it, I&#39;m just<br/>
passing on what I know to be true... not player speculation or rumor,<br/>
but actual statements from The Man. :)<br/>
