<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335368012">Nice but not good. Necros still Have pets, plus Lifetap, Plus Root, Plus,<br/>
Poison shock, plus Cancel magic, hit it once then Darkness him, then hit him<br/>
with CM again and same  Nice thing is that he won&#39;t cancel his DoT&#39;s just<br/>
the buffs.  This would work against a newbie PvP but not an experienced one.<br/>

Oh my!  that&#39;s the best &quot;cheat&quot; I&#39;ve read on this list in a long time!!<br/>
<br/>
What a great way to spank those arrogant DE necros that think they own PvP.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Your character can only have a 15 conditions affecting him or her at one<br/>
time.  If you are going into a battle with something that has a really<br/>
nasty condition (like when fighting necros or crits that charm) Get a<br/>
Shaman load a bunch of buffs on you.  Then you will not be bothered by<br/>
the harmful stuff.  You can try this yourself.  I am a lvl 24 Shaman so<br/>
I cast all my buffs and filled all the slots up(5 stat buffs, 5<br/>
resistance buffs, 2 sight buffs, my ac/hp buff, my ac only buff and SoW)<br/>
Then I cast Envenomed Breath on myself.  I didn&#39;t get the usual resist<br/>
message, but I didn&#39;t take damage and I didn&#39;t get the poison icon.<br/>
