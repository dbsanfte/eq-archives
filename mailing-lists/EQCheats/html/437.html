<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-279951983">I have spent a lot of time in Unrest lately, so here goes.<br/>
<br/>
Two classes really shine here since it is an Undead dungeon: Clerics and<br/>
Paladins.  Make sure you have one of each if you can.<br/>
<br/>
The zone is fairly small, consisting of a large mansion and the<br/>
surrounding courtyard.  The house has 4 floors and a basement.  It can<br/>
be confusing, so have a cleric invis you to undead and explore a bit.<br/>
be ready to run though.  trains build fairly quick as all undead KOS and<br/>
are quick to help out their buddies.<br/>
<br/>
Levels 14-16 can safely kill the yard trash(death beetles, Tormented<br/>
dead, Jack-o-lanterns)<br/>
<br/>
Levels 17-20 should pull from the first and second floors of the<br/>
house(Ghouls, Dry bone skels, lurking mummies)<br/>
<br/>
Levels 21-24 can safely camp a room on the third floor(Lots of skel<br/>
types, Carrion ghouls, specials)<br/>
<br/>
Levels 24-30 can take the knight room on the 4th floor(Undead knight,<br/>
festering hags, greater dark bone)<br/>
<br/>
Levels 30+ can begin to camp in the basement(Ghost, dark terrors,<br/>
mortuary fungus, lots of other nasties I don&#39;t want to mess with)<br/>
<br/>

Unrest.<br/>
