<div id="ygrps-yiv-112197731">Be careful though, Blackburrow is also known as &quot;Home of Low-Level Trains&quot; <br/>
People will train anythin in BB(lvls5-15) sometimes without warning. Thats <br/>
the main reason i left around level 11 everyone is stealing the rare spawns <br/>
that you need and then you get slaughtered cause no one helps and then you <br/>
get ran over by a damn train.</div>
