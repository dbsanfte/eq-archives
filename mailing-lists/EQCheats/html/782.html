Lemme get this straight, someone was sending him email that he didn&#39;t want<br/>
(spam?)<br/>
and in an effort to stop it told the guy that he would charge him a fee for<br/>
reading<br/>
his email. THEN doesn&#39;t read the email that was sent to him and is planning<br/>
on going<br/>
to small claims court to get the fee? THEN he spams us about it like we<br/>
cared?<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the others on the list, Nick is silly indeed. Amazes me how<br/>
people<br/>
refuse to use something as simple as a killist and think this method would<br/>
be a<br/>
better solution.<br/>
