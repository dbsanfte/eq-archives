<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825076918">I have never heard that it is not a paladin only weapon.  Aradune is the main GM of the game&#39;s<br/>
character.  think he might have some influence and might just be able to change the stats just for<br/>
his sword so that he can show it off?  Don&#39;t act like a smart ass when noone really knows for sure<br/>
what it is.<br/>

&gt; Paladin only? really?  Did you all know Aradune is a ranger?  And it is<br/>
&gt; known that this is NOT a paladin only weapon.<br/>
