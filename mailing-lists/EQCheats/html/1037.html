&gt; Actually you only have to be level 20 to complete it easily, although I have<br/>
&gt; heard reports of enchanters as low as level 8 doing the quest.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The reason you should be 20 is that you have to have ogre illusion to<br/>
enter into<br/>
ogguk.  Enchanter websites also claim that the level 20 increase faction<br/>
spell is also required.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise you are KOS by the guards which roam around.  How a level 8<br/>
could get in (invis? but then many casters could do it) and talk to the<br/>
bartender is beyond me.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily i have a level 23 enchanter so it should be easy enough.<br/>
