<b>Subject:</b> Please Read Concerning Me Adding To Group! VOTE! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195254778">Please reply to this post saying if you want me to add a gigantic <br/>
amount of hacks to this group, as well as links, and more files to <br/>
the file archive, for I have realized that this is a cheating group, <br/>
but it is empty.<br/>
<br/>
Please reply by sending me an email at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:xteam_leader@...">xteam_leader@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Please make sure that Vote is in the subject line.<br/>
<br/>
If you want me to add hacks to this group, which I am already doing <br/>
with around 3 other groups and 1 site, well read the following.<br/>
<br/>
Want:I would like you to add EQ hacks to EQCheats *name*.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t Want: I do not want you to add EQ hacks to EQCheats *name*.<br/>
<br/>
Please include your yahoo ID that is in this group, and make sure <br/>
that the above is just like I said, or I will probably delete your <br/>
email.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all vote yes, I will have the 40&#39;some hacks within a week <br/>
that won&#39;t get you banned from EverQuest if you follow the guidelines <br/>
that I set out for them, however, if you don&#39;t, you will get banned...<br/>
<br/>
I will include a guideline file concerning the hacks, and it will <br/>
have the max for every hack if you vote yes.<br/>
<br/>
The highest vote within 3 weeks, you can only vote once, will win.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to change your vote for some reason, please include <br/>
in the heading, Change Vote, and I will change your vote. If you have <br/>
any questions, please email me at the email I have giving above with <br/>
the subject line being, Hack EQCheats, included with the question as <br/>
well, and I will try and reply as soon as I can.<br/>
<br/>
I will need all votes within 2 weeks, I will have all the hacks in 1 <br/>
week, but after two weeks, I will start deleting all questions, <br/>
votes, and other such things concerning it.</div>
