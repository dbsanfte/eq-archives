Verant towards the party that was designing it. It<br/>
was the same group of people that desidned the first<br/>
UO emulators and they had a screenshot of the EQ<br/>
emulator which showed various monsters (which I had<br/>
never seen) al grouped together in what appeared to<br/>
be East Commons. It was real and it worked but they<br/>
decided not to release because of the threats and<br/>
because they said tehy loved the game too much to<br/>
make the creators mad. They also said tehy decided<br/>
not to release it because the code could make it<br/>
possible for cheats to be developed that would take<br/>
advantage of the real EQ servers and they didn&#39;t want<br/>
to ruin the game.<br/>
<br/>
It was called Emuq and the link to the website was:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.swileys.com/emuq/">http://www.swileys.com/emuq/</a><br/>
I don&#39;t know if anything about it is still there or<br/>
not. But that is/was the link.<br/>
