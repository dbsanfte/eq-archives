<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-699278674">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
Im in permafrost and I have been hunting for the mob that has the Ice<br/>
Crystal Staff. I was under the impression that it was the Preacher that had<br/>
it. But I can&#39;t seem to get it.. Anyone know if it is the preacher or is it<br/>
in another area ?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I read on everlore that the staffs are part of a quest. Somehow you<br/>
can use the Water Crystal Staff and starts a long quest to get a great mage<br/>
useable one handed magic staff or something... Im curious if any of you have<br/>
any idea as to what it is ?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
Reuben</div>
