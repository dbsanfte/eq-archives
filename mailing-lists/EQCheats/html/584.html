<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329319977">Well Dar, I just went from 198 to 199 and it took me close to 2000PP to do<br/>
it so us Gods still have to pay through the teeth.  Also not a lot of people<br/>
want to pay around 350pp for a bow.  Once they fix archery so the arrow adds<br/>
to the bows arrange and damage then people might pay.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Some people spent<br/>
a bunch of money on failures to bring their skill up<br/>
to master to make money, now they aren&#39;t going to make<br/>
any. Sounds like what they did to fletching, raised<br/>
skill check by 600%. People with 190+ fletching were<br/>
instant gods of bowmaking. It would cost 1000s of<br/>
platinum to get there now.&gt;&gt;<br/>

You have hit the nail on the head in many ways.  All of the downward<br/>
tweaks such as skill costs, decreasing the spawn frequency of camped<br/>
NPCs, and lowering treasure found on critters works against new<br/>
players.  It entrenches the old players who have moved up under the old<br/>
system and prevents the new players from getting there at all, or at<br/>
least makes the journey more arduous and less satisfying.  McQuaid said<br/>
he is not going to tweak the game in such a manner as to make the game<br/>
too hard for casual players in response to the 24/7 no-life junkies<br/>
hollering that things are too easy or capped out.  However it seems he<br/>
is moving slightly in that direction nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
This constant hardening of the system is exactly why I left DragonRealms<br/>
to play EQ after nearly 3 years.  The game got to the point where it was<br/>
impossible for a casual player to advance his character or make any<br/>
money.  I was at the point where at 40th level it was taking 300 hours<br/>
or more hours of constant work to make a level.  If Verant moves too far<br/>
down this road EQ will whither and die just like DR is.  Then we will<br/>
move on to the next game until it gets too difficult to be fun anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Etc., etc., etc.<br/>
