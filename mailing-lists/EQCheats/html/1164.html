&gt; I realy hope this is wrong...If a cheat becomes available i will quit EQ. I <br/>
&gt; can imagine me saving up to get my banded cape (the last peice i need for <br/>
&gt; full banded i think) and i see a lvl 1 ranger walk past me with Full Thorny <br/>
&gt; Vine Armor, A Darkwood Bow, Fish Bone Earings, and A Pegasus Cloak. (those <br/>
&gt; are the items on my wishlist). I would probably chalange him to a dual but <br/>
&gt; he might kick my ass in that stuff!<br/>

a flowing black robe, shimmering orb, and one of those skull staves<br/>
running from an orc centurion in the E. Commonlands.<br/>
