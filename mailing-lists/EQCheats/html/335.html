<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172891385">Ok, for the past several days I have been trying to complete the Squad<br/>
Ring quest in Riverdale.  I have given a whole bunch of necklaces to the<br/>
Sheriff in Riverdale, a lot of belts to Deputy Budo, and killed a<br/>
crapload of goblins.  The deputies consider me warmly...How can I tell<br/>
how much longer it will take me before I get the ring? Ive also killed<br/>
Mooto quite a few times.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there is a NPC in Riverdale named Silna Stormsmith(sp?)...She goes<br/>
on about delivering messages to Freeport but I cannot get her to give me<br/>
the quest..Is the quest worth it?  How do I go about getting it?  If you<br/>
are coming out of Misty Thicket, Silna spawns down the hallway to the<br/>
left, next to that bench where deputies stand.<br/>
<br/>
Also, any tips on doing the Nillipuss quest would be helpful...What<br/>
level do I have to be to kill him?  How long does it take him to spawn?<br/>
Where does he spawn?<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate help on the Squad Ring quest the most...It is really<br/>
ticking me off that the stupid sherrif will not give me the ring...Once<br/>
I finally do get the ring, can I get it recharged or do I have to go get<br/>
a new one?  If I can get it recharged, how do I do it?  Im a level 16<br/>
monk.<br/>
