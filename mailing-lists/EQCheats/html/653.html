The strength increase you mentioned is the skill called Alcohol Tolerance.<br/>
It is a joke. It increases STR, while severely lowering INT. Its only good<br/>
for warriors. It pretty much makes magic casting impossible, so its no good<br/>
for bards, clerics, paladins, et al. If they made alcohol tolerance a viable<br/>
skill, or make brews good for something else, and they severely increased<br/>
npc prices for brews, brewing would once again be a viable trade skill.<br/>

I thought that drinking brew DID give you a boost in Strength!  (while<br/>
lowering your INT I believe)... So it does kind of &#39;buff&#39; you up... and that<br/>
is a good reason for the Warriors and fighters to build up an alcohol<br/>
tollerance...<br/>
<br/>
Also, pie tins are needed for some quest, but they can already be purchased<br/>
pretty cheaply from NPC&#39;s...<br/>
<br/>
I agree that most of those skills are useless, and blacksmithing is quickly<br/>
becoming usless as well because of the amount of Bronze Armor (as well as<br/>
all the banded that has already been made) that Verant has put into the<br/>
game... It used to be infrequently dropped in Unrest and Permafrost, but now<br/>
it is there all the time... So again, they (possibly unknowingly?) have made<br/>
smithing a tougher skill to obtain...<br/>
