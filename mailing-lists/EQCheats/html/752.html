<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869909805">Sorry I have not been able to reply, I have not been home.  I did not mean<br/>
for that message to go on the list (I mixed things up somehow).  I emailed<br/>
that message because her and one of her friends sent me private emails.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know about you folks, but I hate getting private emails from people I<br/>
don&#39;t know,  especially emails that are just sent to talk down to the<br/>
recipient (namly me).  Again my apologies.<br/>
