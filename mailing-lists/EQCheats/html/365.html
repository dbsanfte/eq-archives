<div id="ygrps-yiv-259222895">Time for a weapon upgrade for this 14th level Dwarven Paladin.<br/>
I prefer to use axes (at least until I git me hands on a Holy Sword :), so I<br/>
was lookin at the Brutechopper.  The stats look pretty reasonable (not quite<br/>
like a Shiny Hally, but I REALLY want to stick with the axes!).  I<br/>
understand it is a quest for evil characters, but how is the quest<br/>
initiated?  What is involved?  How much are these weapons selling for?  I<br/>
was figuring around 100 plat...a little under what the Hally is selling for<br/>
&#39;cause it lacks the damage of the Hally.<br/>
Also, I was thinkin about heading up to High Hold and was wondering what lvl<br/>
you would need to be to get a Tomahawk or a Halberd...any feedback??<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
