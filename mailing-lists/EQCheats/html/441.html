<b>Subject:</b> LJ and the quest for crook staff <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568091649">I have been hunting Lockjaw lately. I have got the kill on him 4 times in 2<br/>
days. And he dropped the crook one time. I gave it to a friend to be nice<br/>
since my 2H blunt is still at can&#39;t hit anything. BUT after seeing EQ&#39;lizer<br/>
and the new druid only crook. I REALLY want to get my skill up to a decent<br/>
area. So I&#39;d like to know how often LJ drops a crook. And if I need to step<br/>
up the LJ hunt to get a crook.<br/>
