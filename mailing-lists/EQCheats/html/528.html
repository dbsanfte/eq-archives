I don&#39;t have a high level necro but at my relative level 15 necro (and knowing others with high<br/>
level necros), I have experienced a lot of their peculiarities. I disagree with some of your<br/>
statements.<br/>
<br/>
1. No necros aren&#39;t the most powerful class, in fact I really don&#39;t think there is one. If you are<br/>
basing it on damage spells then show me the necro&#39;s version of ice comet and you&#39;ll have me there.<br/>
Or show me the necro pet that can cast spells, or the necro that can dual wield .... you get the<br/>
picture. Each class is very good at something and no class is great at everything.<br/>
<br/>
2. KOS is horrible plain and simple. You know it, you&#39;ve experienced it. Try not being able to sell<br/>
to any non-evil vendor. If you are a DE then sure .. walk around Neriak and have at it. But don&#39;t<br/>
try it in a foreign city. A necro&#39;s power isn&#39;t to make up for being KOS, it&#39;s because they are<br/>
masters of the dead. Lifesteal, disease, poison, summoning undead ... these are all necro weapons,<br/>
not gifts from Verant for those wishing to play evil.<br/>
<br/>
3. Root? Only at high levels when it&#39;s usually being done by someone else MUCH sooner.<br/>
Invisibility? Self only. Buffs? Only one ... spirit armor, that doesn&#39;t HURT us. Heals? They hurt<br/>
us as we cast them. Only trading life, not healing it. Our spells are nicely tuned to what the<br/>
whole idea of a necromancer should be.<br/>
<br/>
4. Far more damage than any other class at the same level? Hardly. Make a necro ... try the solo<br/>
thing. Without a pet you&#39;ll die in a heartbeat. With one you can do okay ... but ONLY if you know<br/>
how to play a necro well. The same goes for any class. Play them well and you will do well, play<br/>
them like crap and ... you die.<br/>
<br/>
So in a sense I don&#39;t agree. Yes I have a nice class, and yes I like my Necro. But he is not the<br/>
only good class, and he is definitely not the most powerful in the game. The way you worded your<br/>
email it sounds like you may have had a druid and might be a little mad that they were gimped. I<br/>
agree with the fact that major changes should never be patched without notification but Necros<br/>
should not take the ridicule of anyone just because a previously powerful class feels shortchanged.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the changes being made to the Necro change have actually been corrections to things that<br/>
didn&#39;t work. And they still aren&#39;t all done, try using a DOT in a party and cry as you receive NO<br/>
experience if the DOT kills the creature. In addition, some spells are being removed and replaced<br/>
with less powerful spells. Charm is an example.<br/>
<br/>
All I&#39;m saying is that it appears Verant wants things balanced. If THEY think necros are too<br/>
powerful, they too will be gimped. But I sincerely believe that as a class they are what they<br/>
should be. Well rounded, and masters of undead.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, with all that said... does anybody else think that necros are vastly<br/>
&gt; overpowered?  They do FAR more damage than any other class at all levels,<br/>
&gt; they get pretty much every combat-utility spell that any other class gets<br/>
&gt; (like roots, disempowers, debuffs, etc), AND get the ability to summon pets<br/>
&gt; of higher level than any other class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not to be a huge bitch or anything.  I was fine with that at first, but<br/>
&gt; since EVERY recent patch has included further buffing or tuning of the necro<br/>
&gt; class it just seems to be getting a little absurd to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Somebody tell me what the drawback is for their class...  being hated by<br/>
&gt; some NPCs?  After having played a troll for several months and being KOS by<br/>
&gt; EVERY npc north of innothule.... the necros have it easy... like super-easy.<br/>
&gt; Then they went and gimped the shamans and I just honestly can&#39;t figure out<br/>
&gt; what is going on.  I&#39;m guessing I&#39;m not seeing the whole picture or<br/>
&gt; something.... because recent events just haven&#39;t made any sense to this<br/>
&gt; stupid troll.<br/>

&gt; Heart Flutter also drops a monsters AC by 47 and his str by 17, hit it with<br/>
&gt; the 1st lvl spell Siphon Str and that gives 10 more Str to you.   So with<br/>
&gt; the 3 It is Slowed, Weakened, Has its Ac dropped a good bit you are doing<br/>
&gt; about 400 points of damage in a min (The Dark Side has a nice listing of the<br/>
&gt; spells and what they do per tick).<br/>
