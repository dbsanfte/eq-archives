<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925896198">its warrior only armor, all races can wear it but it started out as only medium<br/>
at first which they changed after this last patch. Each piece has a different<br/>
quest, example gauntlets one avocet charm and 2 star rubies. To get the whole<br/>
quest just run down to the village and hail whatever meadowgreen and he will<br/>
fill you in on the details. Also any race and class can do it. Check out eqlizer<br/>
for stats for each piece I believe they have them all.</div>
