<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512710260"><p>Thanks for all the replys from everyone. after killing about&nbsp;30 Griz. bears and Gian. Spiders (all con blue or light blue) My spear findly kicked in and I starting learning Peirceing, about one point for every mob blue or higher. I used up most of my PP on so more armor so drifted over to Blackborrow for gnoll&nbsp;drops (being only 12th I found its the best way to make PP fast sofar.) and some Guy came along and took me on a whrll wind trip all over the place where everything <strong>con&#39;ed &nbsp;RED!!</strong> he buffed me and just helped with the kills and I went from 12th with one bubble to 13th at 50% in 1 hour. </p>
<p>Just my 2cp worth</p>
