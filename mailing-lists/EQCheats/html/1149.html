<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761382687">Happened to look in the EQ directory and found a log file<br/>
<br/>
dbg.txt<br/>
obviously a file to aid in debugging.<br/>
in this file it contains a few lines<br/>
that look like this<br/>
<br/>
EQGAME SENDS OUT CHECKSUMS HERE<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know exactly what that does, but I would assume it is checking file<br/>
sizes.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that the following would work for long for that reason.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; That way you crack the file replace the<br/>
&gt; actual file right before logging on and wen their servers go to pull the<br/>
&gt; info bingo they pull the cracked file. </span></blockquote></div>
