<div id="ygrps-yiv-908536786">Maybe this should turn into a general discussion list. :-). Anyway. I have <br/>
recently ditched my Dark Elf characters and went to a Barbarian Warrior. Only <br/>
after seeing them slaughter my guards in Nektulos. Was very impressive. What <br/>
weapon is a good newbie 1 handed slashing weapon? Back in beta I used a rusty <br/>
falchion that I got off a decaying skeleton. There something better until I <br/>
raise enough money to get a mino axe. Or combine sword? Also, any way to <br/>
level really really fast? With a Barbarian Warrior. That is where the cheat <br/>
comes into it I guess. Thanks.</div>
