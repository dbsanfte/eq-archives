<b>Subject:</b> Idea on vial creation. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113887578">Just an idea.  Vials need to be sealed, so wouldn&#39;t a cork be required?  I would think so and they can be found in Steamfont at the 3rd Windmill.  Also, I would think that vials could be used for storing potions too.  So that would have us two classes that require our services.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The following combinations WILL NOT make a Vial:<br/>
&gt; (Sketch and Water are assumed requirements)<br/>
&gt; Small Block<br/>
&gt; Small Block and Glass Shards<br/>
&gt; Small Block and Metal Bits<br/>
&gt; Two Small Blocks and Metal Bits<br/>
&gt; Two Small Blocks, Metal Bits, and Glass Shards<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Block of Clay<br/>
&gt; Two Blocks<br/>
&gt; Block and Glass Shards<br/>
&gt; Block and Metal Bits<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Large Block<br/>
&gt; Large Block and Glass Bits<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The last two groupings (Block and L.Block)are guesses on what we used. </span></blockquote></div>
