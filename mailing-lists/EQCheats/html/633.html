<div id="ygrps-yiv-815386218">Everyone is right -- I think I was a bit hasty this week when I quit.  I<br/>
planned on reading a book or two, but when I went to my book shelf, I ended<br/>
up reading the EQ Manual -- hah!  So, I am back, and I apologize for the<br/>
last message I sent out... I just had a flash of panic... <br/>
<br/>
See you all in the game...<br/>

I agree with you, tis but to have fun in life not to be so serious as to<br/>
quit a game when you<br/>
notice it racks up a few extra hrs of time, you can&#39;t get back or buy back<br/>
those hrs so there&#39;s no<br/>
point in quiting.<br/>
<br/>
What are you going to do, spend more time watching T.V, washing the car, etc<br/>
etc ? even if you<br/>
spent 20 hrs a day awake ya never would get back those hrs you lost, and<br/>
those are not really lost<br/>
hrs if you think of it. Think about the ppl you met and the good times you<br/>
had with some<br/>
conversations, think what kind of person it&#39;s made you, and showen you ways<br/>
to handle different<br/>
situations in life. Believe it or not, games are not just kill or be killed,<br/>
their there for the<br/>
community of mortal man and woman, to learn and interact, teach each other<br/>
new things and new<br/>
ideas, share some culteral ideals that you might not have.<br/>
<br/>
Think of it this way, in those 400 hrs, you have reach out to more ppl in<br/>
that time, then you would<br/>
in a life time, spending those hrs at something different. Unless of course<br/>
you were are actor or<br/>
rock star.<br/>
<br/>
Lifes fun, enjoy it for what you have of it, after all, you could die<br/>
tomorrow, and I&#39;d like to<br/>
know i had fun in that time with ppl from all over the world, then sitting<br/>
on my chair or office,<br/>
or such talking to one person, or myself.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Good point -- a typical work year is 2080 hours.  I did a /play and I<br/>

&gt; came<br/>
&gt; &gt; out, in March.  I started the day it came out.  Do you know what I could<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; &gt; with my life with 400 extra hours?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Needless to say, I quit the game this week.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wow!  I guess we could watch the average 23 hours of TV per week like the<br/>
&gt; rest of the country does... Hmmm... wait... that&#39;s MORE!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or, we could work an extra 20 hours a week??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don;t know about the rest of you, but I work to live, I do NOT live to<br/>
&gt; work!  I live to have FUN because that is what *I* believe life is all<br/>
&gt; about... Having a GOOD time, a GOOD life, and trying to help others do the<br/>
&gt; same thing!  But again, that is MY thoughts and opinions, but it&#39;s also my<br/>
&gt; life...<br/>

&gt; Sorry to hear you are quiting Tony!<br/>
