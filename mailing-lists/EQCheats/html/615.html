<div id="ygrps-yiv-554351954">Pottery is still usefull to bakers(mixing bowl, protable oven thingy, molds, <br/>
untensils, etc), but bakeing is useless to other players (food is cheep to <br/>
begin with, so who cares hoe long it lasts, or what it weighs?).  So, <br/>
pottery is usefull, just only to ppl that practice another useless skill :(.<br/>
