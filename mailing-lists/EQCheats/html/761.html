<div id="ygrps-yiv-110044337">There are three factors that I know of that play into pricing from<br/>
vendors: charisma, faction, and vendor multiple. As a High Elf<br/>
Enchanter, I have a reasonably high base charisma, many charisma items,<br/>
and a charisma spell. After some experimentation, I have come to the<br/>
conclusion that charisma&#39;s effect on pricing maxes at just over 100.<br/>
Higher charisma than that makes no difference in pricing.<br/>
<br/>
I also have spells which can improve my faction with vendors, and have<br/>
found that faction higher than &quot;looks at you indifferently&quot; makes no<br/>
difference in pricing. If it&#39;s lower than that, your price will be<br/>
worse, but better won&#39;t improve prices any more.<br/>
<br/>
The final factor is the vendor multiple. Some vendors just sell things<br/>
for a higher base price. Charisma and faction still have an effect, but<br/>
the range of possible prices is higher.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I know about vendor pricing. Good luck.<br/>

		Ok, since I&#39;ve seen a ton of prices variances, I&#39;m<br/>
posting this.<br/>
<br/>
		Your CHA has a LOT to do with the pricing. There seems<br/>
to be a cap at a CHA<br/>
		of 117 for the Star Rubies at a little over 68pp each.<br/>
The lower your<br/>
		charisma, the higher the gems will cost. I&#39;d not like to<br/>
think that anyone<br/>
		will debate this, since I&#39;m fairly certain that it&#39;s<br/>
applicable to everyone.</div>
