 Leave it to Verant to screw something up worse than the problem it was <br/>
 trying to fix (yet again I might add)! Why the hell couldn&#39;t they just have <br/>
 made rubi no drop????? I&#39;m seriously thinking about quitting now. Rubi was <br/>
 about the last think my DESK had left to look forward to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why do you think no DROP would help anything?  The armor could be used by so <br/>
many different classes, it would make no difference.  Few people sell Rubi - <br/>
they all wear it.  The last thing to look forward to?  How do you know?  This <br/>
is not a static game, there will be new quests and new armors and new items <br/>
for SKs some BETTER than Rubi.  <br/>
