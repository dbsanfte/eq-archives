<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-236741710">I have done negafen several times, as far as i know loosing control of<br/>
hot keys only happened when players  *SIT* several times to cancel the<br/>
effect of fear.<br/>
<br/>
Sitting repeatedly while under fear or charm seem to cause this. I am<br/>
not sure if it&#39;s Verant answer to players cheesing out the effect or if<br/>
it&#39;s just a bug.<br/>
<br/>
I usually just type /q and come back.I am not sure why u lost the fight<br/>
just cause of that unless u didnt have enough people.It takes me no<br/>
longer than about 30 secs to get back in.Considering it only happen 1<br/>
time per fight or so on average and that its a long long fight it<br/>
should&#39;nt tip the balance too much.<br/>
<br/>
Btw is negafen dropping anything for magii<br/>
classes(necros,enchanters,wiz,magiciants)? On my server it hasnt dropped<br/>
crap for us in several kills.Last kill we had on it, it dropped 3<br/>
shamans hammers......sigh go figure.<br/>
