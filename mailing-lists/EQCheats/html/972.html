<b>Subject:</b> Orb of Teeshan ? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-393585249">I am interested in finding the Orb or Teeshan. I have been told its on<br/>
Nafagen&#39;s corpse. Being that I am bearly reaching 20 , I won&#39;t be able to<br/>
accomplish this any time soon. I just want to know out of curiosity if this<br/>
is true.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Where does one get the Shimmering orb ? I bought one from a auction<br/>
and am curious as to the origination of this item ?<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah.. I saw this gnome with with a glowing orb of sorts on his<br/>
character.. He wouldn&#39;t let me look at it nor would he tell me its name.<br/>
Upon the 2 second glance in his inventorey look, it was a blue stone.. kina<br/>
like a jewel.. Anyone know what it is ?</div>
