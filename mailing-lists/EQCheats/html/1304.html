<div id="ygrps-yiv-757062467">When I killed Tomer? the teen level necro over and<br/>
over the faction went up with the clerics, etc.. and<br/>
went down with something that looked like it would<br/>
affect a necro type, I don&#39;t recall the names. <br/>

&gt; This is where SHE spawns, =), but she doesn&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; stay there.  She jumped<br/>
&gt; my ranger when he was level 12 south of BB and<br/>
&gt; killed me.  I&#39;m interested to<br/>
&gt; know if there are any faction hits when she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; killed, as I&#39;d like to take<br/>
&gt; her out with my necro.  I&#39;ve only seen her at night.<br/>
