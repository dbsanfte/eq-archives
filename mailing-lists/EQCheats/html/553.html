&gt; That&#39;s the point... kind of.  Verant has always said from the<br/>
&gt; beginning that they do not want trade skills to be profitable when<br/>
&gt; you sell your wares back  to the NPC vendors.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, but who else is going to buy most of that &#39;junk&#39;??  I mean really, how<br/>
many of you would PAY to have a rusty weapon sharpened for you? DUH!  They<br/>
should at least make them BREAK EVEN - No money made, but no money LOST<br/>
either (when successful anyway) while you are practicing your &#39;skill&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
And if Verant doesn&#39;t want to do a proper money economy (now money is<br/>
constantly added to the game) then I would also like to see prices for the<br/>
components go DOWN as your skill level increases!  Make it profitable at<br/>
SOME point in your skill level!<br/>
