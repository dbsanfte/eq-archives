&gt;  I have a question about the quest.. I am helping my enchanter friend with<br/>
&gt;  the quest, and I was wondering.. If I get the items at the same time, ie <br/>
&gt;she<br/>
&gt;  has one set and i have my own.. if by the end of the quest, i can give <br/>
&gt;her<br/>
&gt;  the stuff I&#39;ve got and she can complete it for me.. or is any of the <br/>
&gt;stuff<br/>
&gt;  No drop ? This way she can get a stein and I can get a stein also ? Oh <br/>
&gt;yeah<br/>
&gt;  i am high elf mage, so I know I can&#39;t get the item myself..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah huvn&#39;t done the quest in a long time but tha last time Ah did it weeks <br/>
(since before tha quest was ever spoiled on any of tha popular spoiler <br/>
sites), 3 of the 4 items to git the No Drop book were Lore an&#39; none were No <br/>
Drop.  Yer friend would huv to then turn in her set of ingriediants ta git <br/>
tha No Drop book.  Ye kin then give her yer set.  She would then need ta do <br/>
tha final leg of tha quest.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Ah had suggested on another list along time ago that tha quest needed <br/>
to be made harder by makin&#39; the fish a No Drop item.  Ah huv since heard <br/>
that, that may huv been done.  Whether it was done one tha test server or <br/>
all of the productions servers, Ah don&#39; know it&#39;s been many.<br/>
