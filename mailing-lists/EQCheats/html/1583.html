<div id="ygrps-yiv-396563465">Doesn&#39;t look like anyone told you where Milea is.  When you make it to East<br/>
K, head east across the zone until you get to a Valley.  This is the same<br/>
valley that leads to High Pass.  I am pretty sure the north south loc is<br/>
zero.  You can also follow the path from the bridge, just go towards High<br/>
Pass.  When you get to the entrance, Almost everyone will take the path<br/>
going up.  You need the one that is level, or down.  She is near the very<br/>
end.  you will have to run a long way, maybe 10 min, down that valley to get<br/>
to her.<br/>
<br/>
As for getting past the raiders, you can also try passing them by swimming<br/>
under water or during the rain.  The rain will lower the distance that they<br/>
can see.<br/>

Hello all<br/>
<br/>
I have a question.  This poor warrior on the Prexus server<br/>
need to know where Milea Clothspinner ( the sister that starts<br/>
this quest is in Qyenos, you have to give this Milea a letter )<br/>
cave in East Karanas.<br/>
<br/>
And could you please tell me the best way to get there<br/>
from West Karanas.  I have died more times than I want<br/>
to say trying to get there.  I have hugged the coast but<br/>
every time I get to North Karanas Radiers near the coast <br/>
kill me.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
Ranala level 10 warrior who is wondering if she will ever<br/>
get to East Karanas in one piece.<br/>
