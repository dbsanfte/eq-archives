&lt;&lt; Solusek Ro is probably the worst roleplaying server that exists <br/>
 and is almost exclusively a power gaming -hey dude- you suck - cool man! - <br/>
 server. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    While this is very true of many of the zones if your looking for people <br/>
that are really role-playing their Char&#39;s go to the swamp or Guk.  I play a <br/>
troll shaman and everyone (almost) is role-playing their chars. Other than <br/>
that If I had a way to switch my chars to a different server I would in a <br/>
Everquest Minute.</div>
