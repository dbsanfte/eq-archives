<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886109061">Actually, my group spent the greater part of yesterday camping the preacher.<br/>
I found out a few things have changed in perma:<br/>
<br/>
Evokers now, in addition to thier nearly unlimited mana and chanelling skill<br/>
of 255, have access to a plethora of new AE spells capable of taking a full<br/>
party of level 21-23 to one bubble of health.  (these are blue evokers to<br/>
me, a 22 level shaman)<br/>
<br/>
The preacher now has greater heal, and uses it on itself with reckless<br/>
abandon.   Pretend you are killing the same gob five times over and you have<br/>
a pretty good idea of what it&#39;s like.<br/>
<br/>
In the four or so hours I was in perma, the preacher spawned twice (which is<br/>
much less than it used to), the prelate never spawned, and the rest of the<br/>
spawns were filled with evokers, priests, and reg. gobs.<br/>
<br/>
The first time we killed the preacher he had the RC, the second time he had<br/>
the morning star.   (Which I think is INCREDIBLY good luck, since I have<br/>
killed him about 20 times and this is the first time he&#39;s had the morning<br/>
star)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and just a quick note to you 40 level people who have never been in<br/>
permafrost yet think you know everything -- the ALCHEMIST has the mammoth<br/>
armor.   The ARCHEOLOGIST has the pack and the dented brass mask.   They<br/>
DON&#39;T spawn in the same place!  ;)<br/>

&gt; I have seen a few changes myself in perma. Things such as the preacher not<br/>
&gt; having anything but money on him. Also I used to get chain and the odd<br/>
&gt; piece of bronze from gobbies now I rarely get anything besides some cash.<br/>
&gt; The arch and preacher do not spawn as often either. Also the preacher<br/>
seems<br/>
&gt; to spawn on a regular basis with a FS warhammer now and nothing else on<br/>
&gt; him. Truly depressing.<br/>

&gt; &gt;After the patch Ive notice a few changes in Permafrost on loot.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I was in perma last night for 5 hours or so and only looted one bronze<br/>
&gt; &gt;sword, usually we walk away with lots of rawhide armor and lots of FS<br/>
&gt; &gt;weapons. Most all the weapons i looted last night were all Rusty, I am<br/>
lvl<br/>
&gt; &gt;24 and we were taking blues and whites and yellows.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Also the archaelogist and the preacher never spawned while i was there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Anyone else see any difference?<br/>
