<div id="ygrps-yiv-382794955">I seriously doubt they&#39;d have high level encryption...it is after all just a <br/>
game :).<br/>
<br/>
I would be interested in finding out exactly what they use, but I don&#39;t have <br/>
the time nor do I have the knowledge to do that (I do programming, no <br/>
hacking, and not too much programming).<br/>
<br/>
anyway...if anyone does find a way to hack please tell me, I started this <br/>
whole silly thread ;). &lt;--silly who&#39;s gonna hack it when they could just be <br/>
playing instead :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
