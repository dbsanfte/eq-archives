<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416885146">Sorry, your mistaken. There is a merchant that sells Bat wings. Even after the server resets and no<br/>
one has longed in, she is waiting there with as many bat wings as you can afford.<br/>
<br/>
The one I know about is in the mages guild in W. Freeport. I have personally bought backpacks worth<br/>
of wings when me AND my group were baking. :)<br/>

&gt; Well, not exactly...whenever they patch or server goes down for some reason<br/>
&gt; the merchant inventory is reset so all those bat wings get super glued back<br/>
&gt; onto rats to make more bats I guess.  Well, at anyrate I&#39;m guessing that the<br/>
&gt; selling bat wings would work right after a new patch and for a few days<br/>
&gt; after that.<br/>

&gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t work much anymore... Bat Wings are purchasable in unlimited<br/>
&gt; &gt;amounts in Kithicor and West Freeport (probably other zones as well, Ogguk<br/>
&gt; &gt;or Grobb almost ceratinly) for about 14 copper each. People are beginning<br/>
&gt; &gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;know this. :) </span></blockquote></div>
