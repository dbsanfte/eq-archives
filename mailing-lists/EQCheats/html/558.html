&gt; Can anyone tell me what I need to do to get one of these?<br/>
&gt; I went to the Sisters Isle.. got on a canoe and sailed around for a bit...<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t find anything that looked like pirates, especially ones I could<br/>
&gt; solo.. I&#39;m a 26th level rogue.ï¿½ Do I need a group for this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Two islands due west (Ok maybe not west, there is an east/west flip that<br/>
occurs somewhere on the OOT, if you just got off the boat at the sisters<br/>
island, head straight down the dock until you get to the end of the island<br/>
hang a left, 2 islands straight that direction.) there is an island with<br/>
a named giant, and MANY cyclops.  At the &#39;back left&#39; tip (Depending on if the <br/>
flip occured that&#39;s either south west or north east) of the island is a <br/>
campfire and the following:<br/>
<br/>
1) Halfling Rogue (Captain something) Has the Bracers<br/>
2) Dark Elf Warrior?<br/>
3) Gnome magican<br/>
4) *-Elf Warrior?<br/>
<br/>
They are semi-linked but I&#39;ve managed to kill them all without triggering the<br/>
Elf.  Kill the Magician first as he&#39;s a spellcaster.  Two Mid twenties cleared<br/>
the island and kept it clear for 4-5 spawns.  The bracers are lore, +5 strength<br/>
Also you can get an earring hat can be returned to the sisters as a quest.<br/>
