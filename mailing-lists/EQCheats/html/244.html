&gt; Brad is one of the people that MADE EQ...Aradune is his &#39;flagship&#39; character<br/>
&gt; ...he doesn&#39;t HAVE to &#39;earn&#39; his experience OR his equipment.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll say it again.  He does have to earn the crap his character has. <br/>
The GM watch him just as close (if not closer) as they do the rest of<br/>
us.  Go to Veeshan.  You won&#39;t see any ranger with a fiery avenger.. <br/>
nor will you ever on any server</div>
