<br/>
Here is the entire Soulfire quest, the way I understand it:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Get the note from Kalatrina in the Hall of Truth, top level.<br/>
2.  Go to the spy, tell him &#39;Truth is good&#39;, and then give him the<br/>
letter.<br/>
3.  After the Guard kills him, take his note and you are supposed to<br/>
give it to her, but she doesn&#39;t hand it back to you, so skip this part<br/>
of the quest.  She noramlly tells you to go to<br/>
the Office of the People and speak with the woman there, but I&#39;m<br/>
telling you right now.<br/>
4.  At the Office of the People, you are again supposed to give her the<br/>
note, but she also doesn&#39;t give it back.  Simply tell her &quot;Who is<br/>
Zimel?&#39;, and she will tell you about Groflah, and<br/>
that Zimel&#39;s Blades in condemned.<br/>
5.  First, go to the Hall of Truth, and tell Kalatrina that &#39;Zimels<br/>
Baldes is condemned.&#39;.  I believe this is where you first hear about<br/>
Soulfire (or is it the time you give it to her the<br/>
first time, I haven&#39;t done this part in a while).<br/>
6.  Now, go to Groflah&#39;s Forge, and ask him &#39;Who is Zimel?&#39;.  He will<br/>
give you a negative response, and then give him the Zimel&#39;s Blades<br/>
note.  He will tell you to meet him in the<br/>
Seafarer&#39;s Roost.<br/>
7.  Go to the Seafarer&#39;s Roost (at the docks in East Freeport), and<br/>
wait for Groflah to show up.  He is usually there at 3 am, but it&#39;s<br/>
fairly ramdom.  When he shows, again ask him &#39;Who is<br/>
Zimel?&#39;, and he&#39;ll tell you about he&#39;s buddies with old Zimel.  Now<br/>
give him the note, and he&#39;ll decode it for you.  It says &#39;H E L P  C A<br/>
P T I V E&#39;, on it, implying that the prisoner<br/>
under the arena is Zimel (as we suspected for some time).<br/>
8.  While waiting at the Seafarer&#39;s Roost, do NOT go AFK, as you will<br/>
miss a crucial part of the quest.  Randomly a drunk named Tykar Renlin<br/>
will show up, and will cuss out Captain Lucan<br/>
when a bard sings a song about him.  He also says that Lucan imprisoned<br/>
him and his buddy, old Zimel.  Ask him &#39;Who is Zimel?&#39; and he will ask<br/>
you for a drink.  Give him 4 Drom&#39;s<br/>
Champagnes, and he will give you a blanket called &#39;Bunker Cell #2&#39; (I<br/>
think, but it&#39;s not important what it&#39;s called).<br/>
9.  Go to the prisoner under the Arena.  Hail him, and ask him &#39;Who is<br/>
Zimel?&#39;.  He will &#39;Stare deeply into your eyes&#39;, and say nothing.  Ask<br/>
him &#39;Where is Soulfire?&#39;, and he&#39;ll ramble<br/>
something along the lines of &#39;Bog n Goo!!  Freezing!!  Hungry!! <br/>
Thirsty too!!&#39;.  This implies that he needs two items.<br/>
10.  Go kill some snakes and get a few Snake Scales off them.  Put them<br/>
in a brew barrel with a bottle, and a flask of water.  This will give<br/>
you &#39;Bog Juice&#39;, one of the items that Zimel<br/>
asks for (Bog n Goo;  this is the Bog, now for the Goo...)<br/>
11.  Get some Fire Beetle Eyes (if you don&#39;t know where to get these,<br/>
you don&#39;t deserve Soulfire), and Rat ears, and put them into an oven. <br/>
You get &#39;Edible Goo&#39;, which Zimel also asks for<br/>
(This is the Goo part...)<br/>
12.  Give the &#39;Bunker Cell #2&#39;, the &#39;Bog Juice&#39;, and the &#39;Edible Goo&#39;<br/>
to Zimel.  He gives you a key called H.K. 102, and he mutters something<br/>
about Tunaria&#39;s Corridor.  If you&#39;ve done the<br/>
Princess Quest in High Keep, you know what to do...<br/>
13.  Take the Key to High Keep (located in Highpass Hold;  this is the<br/>
narrow pass between Qeynos and Freeport, and the coninent used to be<br/>
called Tunaria, hence, Tunaria&#39;s Corridor).  Give<br/>
the key to the Clerk in the bank, that&#39;s it.  You get a note from Hayle<br/>
Mool, addressed to Zimel.  It tells you to come get him in Qeynos, but<br/>
if you&#39;ve been there before, you know he&#39;s<br/>
being held in Splitpaw...<br/>
14.  In Splitpaw, find him (don&#39;t ask...) and give him the note.  He<br/>
will tell you something I forgot already, but then you ask him &#39;What is<br/>
the Proof of Nobility?&#39;.  He will tell you that<br/>
he requires the note you gave him, The Brilliant Sword of Faith, the<br/>
Glowing Sword Hilt, and the Testimony of Truth (some of which are<br/>
sub-quests, explained below).<br/>
15.  At this point, I HAVE NOT given him the items, at least in the<br/>
correct manner (long story, and rather embarassing;  I&#39;d perfer if you<br/>
didn&#39;t ask...).  If you give the items one at a<br/>
time, I have heard (though this is not confirmed) he will hand you over<br/>
the Soulfire!  Congrats, you should have the blade if you&#39;re smarter<br/>
than I am!<br/>
<br/>
THE TEST OF TRUTH<br/>
<br/>
This is also started in the Hall of Truth, and may not be started after<br/>
level 8.  This is a very simple quest, so I will not explain it here...<br/>
<br/>
THE BRILLIANT SWORD OF FAITH<br/>
<br/>
1.  Speak with the Paladin Guild Master at the top of the Hall of<br/>
Truth, and ask him everything pertaining to killing Lucan D&#39;lere.<br/>
2.  Once you have gotten the quest, assemble a team of TONS of level 45<br/>
plus people, because Captain Lucan is the badass leader of the Warrior<br/>
Guild in Freeport, and the head of the<br/>
Freeport Militia.  He&#39;s level 48, so make sure you&#39;ve got PLENTY of<br/>
time to spend killing him, since he&#39;s TOUGH.  Tonight on my server<br/>
(Rodcet Nife) a group of about 20 level 40+ people<br/>
LOST to this bugger, and only killed him after dying three or four<br/>
times each.<br/>
3.  If you get his Testimony from him (which rarely spawns, God knows<br/>
why...), return it to the man who gave you the quest, and he forks over<br/>
the Brilliant Sword of Faith.<br/>
<br/>
GLOWING SWORD HILT<br/>
<br/>
This is gained off a Shadow Knight in Mistmoore named Xicotl.  I am not<br/>
sure, but I think it spawns every time, and he&#39;s in either the Guest<br/>
House or the Throne Room, if I recall<br/>
correctly.  He&#39;s surrounded by other Shadow Knights and Necros, so be<br/>
prepared for another tough battle (though not as tough as the bloodbath<br/>
when you fight Lucan, that&#39;s just BRUTAL).  I<br/>
should point out that whenever this guy gets pulled, the whole zone<br/>
clears, so be warned...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my take on Soulfire, correct me if I&#39;m wrong...  But I&#39;m not.  :<br/>
