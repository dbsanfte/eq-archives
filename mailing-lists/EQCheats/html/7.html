<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981475040">I have a level 9 Dark Elf Necromancer and what I have found that give decent <br/>
experience is killing skels in Nektulos Forest. It is slow, but they always <br/>
spawn at temple or pyramid all the time. Without fail, and if you go later at <br/>
night when there is not a lot of people, you could gain a lot. Also killing <br/>
the occasional lesser mummy or zombie helps as well. Doesn&#39;t seem like much <br/>
loot, but after sitting there and killing for a long time you acrue a large <br/>
amount of silver and copper which gets to be a lot. The highest that I <br/>
remember getting is about 350 copper and 150 silver. Not bad, plus I am a <br/>
necromancer and I have over 75 bone chips to use. Just a suggestion and if <br/>
you are not evil, the guards could kill you on site. I would only try this <br/>
when you are level 8 or above for a necromancer. Not sure about any other <br/>
class.</div>
