<div id="ygrps-yiv-970733952">Well, I have to say that I liked the sig. I even passed it on to a few friends who chuckled at it.<br/>
And he has one point in the fact that it is at the bottom of he text. Might as well get upset at<br/>
OneList for their little &quot;commerical&quot; tagged on each and every email someone sends to the list.<br/>
<br/>
But I WILL have to agree that the +ACI crap, (Which is why I included so much of the previous<br/>
comments in my reply) is annoying. (I even had to edit all that junk out when I forwarded it out.) I<br/>
understand it is probably something his mail program puts in and he/she has no idea that this junk<br/>
is in there. But it DOES get annoying. It&#39;s a shame that apparently it annoys people enough that<br/>
this email address is on a few kill lists.<br/>

&gt; Well that is my automatic signature, and in no way do I intend on removing it for YOU, since you have been the only person to point it out. I really don&#39;t understand what your problem is, since it is at the BOTTOM of my messages, and NOTHING forces you to scroll down and read it, please do not publicly announce your pet peves to me...  If you notice many other ppl have a autosig, I could truly care less if it annoys you, my signature and all of it contents are staying, sorry+ACE-<br/>

&gt; Whoever is adding the following crap to their responses, can you please stop?<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s incredibly annoying and is not at all funny in any way.<br/>
