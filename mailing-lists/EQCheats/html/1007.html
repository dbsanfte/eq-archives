<b>Subject:</b> exploitable quest? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576664450">On vallon zek, I was amazed at the hobbit druids who leveled so<br/>
quickly.  I was told that there was some sort of quest which gives<br/>
INSANE experience and that it was being heavily exploited.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know what this is?  I may want to try a stuntie, and any leg up<br/>
is sure a good thing.<br/>
