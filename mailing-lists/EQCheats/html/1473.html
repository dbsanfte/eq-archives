&gt; Keep reading the news, though.  Instead of being dropped by a mob it is<br/>
&gt; going to be through a class specific quest (details not known yet).<br/>
&gt; Hopefully they will make it so that only that class can do it and change the<br/>
&gt; warrior crafted quest where only warriors can do it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am sure they will make that quests extremely buggy and insane difficult to<br/>
complete as all later introducing quests. For example, quest for Ice Comet was<br/>
buggy from beggining for several weeks, casters research quests was made in such<br/>
manner so its more easy to train research in traditional way, quests for Necro&#39;s<br/>
high level pet words are so hards so it is much more easy to find the proper<br/>
words from regular high level mobs. Sure, it will be nightmare at Drelzna room<br/>
in next 2 days :)<br/>
