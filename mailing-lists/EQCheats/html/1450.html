&gt;Well I asked around for some official answers and I was told basically that<br/>
&gt;blocking, training, etc etc were all ILLEGAL. Plain and simple. End of<br/>
&gt;statement.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;No role-playing excuses allowed. If guides are accepting role-playing<br/>
&gt;excuses and allowing it to continue then those guides are not following the<br/>
&gt;rules.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Guards in all areas have loot and give experience. They are there to be<br/>
&gt;killed. The fact that they protect newbies in their homelands is an added<br/>
&gt;bonus, but any sort of assistance they are given by players to attack the<br/>
&gt;people hunting them does go against the PVP avoidance rule.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If people are hunting your guards in your homeland you have no recourse but<br/>
&gt;to duel them yourself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Someone wanted to know what was the official answer according to actual<br/>
&gt;guide rules, so I asked. </span></blockquote></div>
