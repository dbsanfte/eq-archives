<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755267619">I was wondering if anyone had completed the 2nd of the two guildmasters<br/>
quests in the rogue guild in kelethin?  I have done the first one long ago,<br/>
where you bring him 2 gp&#39;s and 2 rusty daggers, when i talk to the other guy<br/>
however, he asks if you are a new adventurer or something of that sort, and<br/>
if you say, yes, i am a new adventurer he&#39;ll say no, can&#39;t give a quest to<br/>
someone that inexperienced, or something of the like.  If you try to say<br/>
that you are not new, he still will not give you it, but merely repeats<br/>
himself.  I either can&#39;t find out what to say to him, or the quest is<br/>
broken, just curious<br/>
