&gt; of course I know I can get an invis and make the run but I&#39;d kinda like to<br/>
&gt; take the time to wonder around neriak and surrounding areas.  Since I killed<br/>
&gt; DE Guards for bronze so often I&#39;m not KOS.  I&#39;m trying to locate the mask of<br/>
&gt; deceivers which when worn and rt clicked will transform my appearance to that<br/>
