<div id="ygrps-yiv-161805342">The Fiery Avenger is done through a quest which is some way will include the Great Red Dragon in SOL B. Also it is not a Paladin only weapon unless they changed it recently. There is no way they would allow only 1 person on each server to have one because that would severely piss off the people who don&#39;t play every day.</div>
