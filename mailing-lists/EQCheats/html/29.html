<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429444866">I agree with what you said about why not stay in the guild. That is what I am <br/>
going to do. Alomst everyone in the guild is decked out in good armor. At <br/>
least everyone I have seen has at least one piece of chainmail. I am not sure <br/>
how to make 10 plat real quick, but the guild idea, is very good. Just stay <br/>
in the guild. Best way to go, and you will be remembered. Whether it is for <br/>
bad or good is up to you. Sorry I came off the wrong way on my last mail. My <br/>
fault. Just wasn&#39;t sure, shouldn&#39;t have answered, did anyway. Ooops.</div>
