I agree that level gaining is quite slow. 8-10 hours<br/>
for a level is a bit much. I can&#39;t imagine the high<br/>
30s and above. <br/>

&gt; &gt;If Verant moves too far down this road EQ will<br/>
&gt; whither and<br/>
&gt; &gt;die just like DR is.  Then we will move on to the<br/>
&gt; next game<br/>
&gt; &gt;until it gets too difficult to be fun anymore.<br/>

&gt; You have also hit that nail right on the head.  I am<br/>
&gt; only a casual player,<br/>
&gt; and there have been many patches where I&#39;ve felt a<br/>
&gt; bit shafted.  They have<br/>
&gt; made EQ into a beast that requires absurd amounts of<br/>
&gt; time to make any<br/>
&gt; progress whatsoever.  I used to have a great group<br/>
&gt; of people to party with,<br/>
&gt; but I couldn&#39;t dedicate the 40+ hours per week that<br/>
&gt; they did, so I&#39;m enough<br/>
&gt; levels behind that I can&#39;t group with them and make<br/>
&gt; any progress... so I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; stuck at a mid level and I haven&#39;t been able to find<br/>
&gt; another decent group<br/>
&gt; for the life of me.  So instead of facing all the<br/>
&gt; frustration, I&#39;m wishing I<br/>
&gt; could just switch my characters to &quot;inactive&quot;<br/>
&gt; status... where I can&#39;t play<br/>
&gt; the game, but they don&#39;t delete my characters.... so<br/>
&gt; I can come back in a<br/>
&gt; year or so if nothing better comes along.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the flip side, if EQ was just 50% easier, you<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be able to pry me<br/>
&gt; away from that infernal compter.  It&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; excitement of making progress<br/>
&gt; that is so fun, and for the casual gamer, the<br/>
&gt; progress curve in EQ is so low<br/>
&gt; after lvl 20 that it&#39;s just not that much fun<br/>
&gt; anymore.  I&#39;d almost rather<br/>
&gt; spend my time playing Kingdoms or go back and play<br/>
&gt; Bladur&#39;s Gate all the way<br/>
&gt; through, or best of all... go find a good text-based<br/>
&gt; MUD where I can advance<br/>
&gt; at a reasonable speed then wiz and start adding my<br/>
&gt; own imagination to the<br/>
&gt; world.<br/>

&gt; P.S. does anybody know a email address for feedback?<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;d love to just share<br/>
&gt; some of these frustrations. </span></blockquote></div>
