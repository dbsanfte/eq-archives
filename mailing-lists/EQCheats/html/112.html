<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-87276342">Greetings everyone, I have a small information or spoiler request. I&#39;m<br/>
looking for any and all information regarding Bull Smasher, a one handed<br/>
blunt weapon I saw talked about on The Druid&#39;s Grove. The stats as I<br/>
remember them are Damage 6 Delay 20, +2 Str/Agi/Dex, and useable by<br/>
Halflings/Gnomes/Dwarves. The person in question did not know where to<br/>
get it, but heard it was a quest in Ak&#39;Anon. Can anyone pleaes help me<br/>
with this? Thank you.</div>
