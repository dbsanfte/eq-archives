&gt;    I started playing about 2 months ago and am really enjoying <br/>
&gt; myself. But I am stuck. I use the diff. infomation and maps you can <br/>
&gt; find on the net as well as equipment list ect to help me find things <br/>
&gt; for quests ect. well I am stumped...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am working on a High Elf Pally and am really enjoying building this <br/>
&gt; guy up. I started working on the Felwithe Defenders  Falchion quest. <br/>
&gt; I am 8th level and the quest is rated 10th to 15th level.I started <br/>
&gt; the quest (talking to the Seria elf in the pally house) I killed the <br/>
&gt; masked spy and the Gen. Orc (with the help of a Dwarf with a Big <br/>
&gt; hammer.) (Note: the Spy and the Gen. Orc can be found talking <br/>
&gt; together at -2096.28, 2326.77  in Greater Faydark)and they can be <br/>
&gt; pulled with spells one at a time) I got their heads and turned them <br/>
&gt; in to Seria and got the dull sword I&#39;m to sharpen the sword, and turn <br/>
&gt; it in with  some arborean amber and a P.forest drakeling scale to get <br/>
&gt; the first pally sword....well the dum sword will not sharpen, I use 1 <br/>
&gt; and 2 sharping stones, the sword and put them in the forge in the <br/>
&gt; armorer&#39;s shop and I&#39;m told &quot;these idems will not combine try another <br/>
&gt; forge...WHAT other forge?? My first ? is..is there another forge in <br/>
&gt; the high elf city and if so where or is it because I am only 8th <br/>
&gt; level?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; my 2nd ? is on the first Pally armor quest where or what in the name <br/>
&gt; of all the good gods can I find or what is &quot;Brick of crude Bronze&quot; <br/>
&gt; and where can I find/make them (I need 2 for my first peace of armor)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
