<div id="ygrps-yiv-133766747">No, however i was recently in SK when a person was auctioning to by a elephant tusk.. he said it was a rare tusk, unlike the normal Mammoth tusks, and small mammoth tusks that are normally found on elephants and mammoths..<br/>
He said he wanted it for his dark elf friend, who needed it for a quest of some sort.. thats all the info i got out of him.<br/>

+AD4APg- I was wondering if anyone has seen this item. I think it might come off<br/>
+AD4APg- Terrorantula. BUT that is my thought. If anyone has heard any rumors about<br/>
+AD4APg- where it comes from I&#39;d be interested to know.<br/>
