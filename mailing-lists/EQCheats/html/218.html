<div id="ygrps-yiv-247620310">Just so yall know..  Aradune is not decked out as he was in beta.  BETA<br/>
was just that.. BETA.  In release, he&#39;s just as watched as the rest of<br/>
us.  He has to earn everything just like the rest of us.  He may be high<br/>
lvl (i don&#39;t know) but i assure you he&#39;s not packin anything he didn&#39;t<br/>
earn.  As for the green splinted platemail..  I talked to a lvl 48<br/>
cleric and he said his group still had a couple levels to go before they<br/>
could make a run at getting some of it.</div>
