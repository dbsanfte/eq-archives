<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066410002">I thought about doing a little hacking. I have an extra computer collecting<br/>
dust right now. My plan is to put two network cards on and linux on it. Have<br/>
the network traffic go through the first computer, then to my game computer.<br/>
Then I can do all the packet sniffing I want without bothering the game<br/>
client. I was thinking about making a little client on the linux box with<br/>
vector graphics showing your position and the position of all local mobs.<br/>
Like a radar.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to make a better messaging system. Like check every so often<br/>
your friends list to see when friends are on. And display which friends are<br/>
on line. And have seperate friends lists for each server.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I think would be cool would be to make bots. I was thinking a<br/>
healbot would be pretty easy. To activate you do a &quot;/m healbot join&quot;.<br/>
Healbot would then join your party. His sole job would be to cast heal<br/>
spells on the members of the party. I imagine I could get a lot of exp while<br/>
at work. :) I was think he would be gnomish clockwork so that he could even<br/>
be in character. :)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I have a job and do not found the time to do any of this yet.</div>
