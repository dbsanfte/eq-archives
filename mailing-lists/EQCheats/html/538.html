<div id="ygrps-yiv-390427975">WARNING TEST SERVER has changed the Pottery costs, and is NOT profitable at all, details below.<br/>
<br/>
With a CHA 85<br/>
<br/>
now                                              before<br/>
<br/>
Sketch  1pp 6sp 1cp ---------         1sp 1cp<br/>
water  1sp 1cp ---------------         1sp 1cp<br/>
Clay 4sp 3cp -----------------         4sp 3cp<br/>
Sheet 4sp 3cp ----------------         4sp 3cp<br/>
<br/>
As you can see this is not going to go over to well, this increase is WAY to much, considering the<br/>
sales of a pie tin after fired is only 6 gp 5 sp 7 cp. Get your pottery and money now, regular<br/>
servers are going to be updated this Tuesday...</div>
