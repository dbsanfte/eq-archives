AGAIN I thought this guy was gone?<br/>
I took it upon myself to post this message on the<br/>
other  Egroup message boards because this guy is<br/>
really getting annoying, I had to post this 7 times<br/>
besides this one...<br/>
<br/>
This is getting annoying out of the 10 lists I&#39;m<br/>
currently on this guy is on 8 of them selling his<br/>
cheats. Already one Moderator has kicked him and now<br/>
he hits everyother site he can get on pushing his<br/>
product. This ain&#39;t E-Bay buddy! Your making it<br/>
annoying to check e-mails about everquest! Please I<br/>
urge you Moderators to do something about these<br/>
commercial interuptions thank you.<br/>
                    Sinchi<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there will be something done about him.<br/>
Sorry to get off topic with this but I know you all<br/>
understand and most atleast agree with me. Thank you.<br/>
