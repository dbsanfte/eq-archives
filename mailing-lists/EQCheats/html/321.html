&gt;I mentioned the experience bonus with a group and one<br/>
&gt;of the members said he asked 5 GMs and that the bonus<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was at the Orc Totem last night with a group of six players all around<br/>
level 9.  I don&#39;t know if the experience came from the fabled 25% bonus, or<br/>
a side effect of having greater forces take on greater odds, but we all<br/>
racked up on xp.  <br/>
<br/>
Interesting side note:  I could swear the orcs were spawning much faster<br/>
there with a group of six than when I&#39;d been there with groups of 3 or 4.<br/>
This may have been due to the lastest patch or something though.<br/>
