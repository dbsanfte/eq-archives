<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031767547">Got a question on spells?<br/>
        on dot&#39;s they start off with a certain amount then continue doing<br/>
more over time. will it all ways do the same amount as long as the taget is<br/>
alive?<br/>
        on transfer&#39;s which I thought only necro&#39;s get it take an amount and<br/>
gives it to the necro. will this amount all ways be the same as long as the<br/>
mob has it and you can take it?<br/>
       but on dd the amount varies if what I have seen on the web sites is<br/>
correct? is there any way to help insure you get a good shot does range<br/>
effect it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On a specific spells does anyone know about heart flutter? I looked a web<br/>
site and it said 20 mana and 100 dmg it might have been dot but it also had<br/>
str and a/c reduced. this sound very effecient to meeee....<br/>
