  The strength increase you mentioned is the skill called Alcohol Tolerance. It is a joke. It increases STR, while severely lowering INT. Its only good for warriors. It pretty much makes magic casting impossible, so its no good for bards, clerics, paladins, et al. If they made alcohol tolerance a viable skill, or make brews good for something else, and they severely increased npc prices for brews, brewing would once again be a viable trade skill.<br/>

  Which is what it is supposed to do... a trade off of Strength for Intelligence... Just like real life (sort of)... And it is a TEMPORARY thing... <br/>
<br/>
  I saw it as something that Tanks would/should be interested in... The whole reason for alcoholic beverages to be sold by vendors AND Players... They would have more strength when in battle, so would do more damage during the battle... That way they could carry the alcoholic beverages around when they were in &#39;battle&#39; areas... They would automatically be drinking it all the time... which would keep their strenght boosted all the time, and when they wanted even MORE (like before a battle) they could &#39;tank up&#39; on a couple more (which is why you can make yourself drink) for an added boost... Then, when they are done with fighting, they sober up by drinking water or milk and their INT goes back up and they can sell/buy things cheaper...<br/>
