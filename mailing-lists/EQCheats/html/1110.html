<b>Subject:</b> RE: possible big cheat for EQ.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-98903846">I think it would be cool if we could make a trainer for eq but I would NOT <br/>
want it used. Sudenly all we have is lvl 50s in full suits of crafted or <br/>
rubicite or cryosilk (depending on class) There would no longer be a point <br/>
to the game. Wow  you can kill anything you want...but so can everyone else. <br/>
If someone here does develop a trainer please dont put it out there.<br/>

&gt;this is not a flame :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What do ppl really expect?  when I got EQ I was amazed that it&#39;d been out a<br/>
&gt;week or 2 and there weren&#39;t any trainers for it yet.  I&#39;m still amazed that<br/>
&gt;there aren&#39;t any.  Congrats to whoever is doing security there they deserve<br/>
&gt;it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But there are ppl that want big cheats.  There are ppl that want a new<br/>
&gt;challange, a new hard game to make a cheat program for.  There are ppl that<br/>
&gt;have ideas on how to do stuff.  You get a list like this one the topic is<br/>
&gt;cheats, a lot of us have a decient amount of computer, networking, hacking,<br/>
&gt;encryption experance of course you&#39;re going to have ideas on how to get<br/>
&gt;around EQ security if someone brings it up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes, this may make EQ trainerable, but it may not.  I&#39;m sure anything<br/>
&gt;current will change by the expansion that&#39;s due out this christmas (or<br/>
&gt;after, can&#39;t remember).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Omeg who isn&#39;t sure if he wants anything to come of it or not anymore...oh<br/>
&gt;well, it&#39;s fun to brainstorm stuff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;That&#39;s way cool and highly feasible. Haven&#39;t tried it myself, although you<br/>
&gt;&gt;may have just opened up the possibility of a very big &gt;cheat - a &quot;trainer&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;utility that uses this idea.<br/>
