<div id="ygrps-yiv-165246187">Pzygin was green to me when I was 22nd and Varsoon was a deep red. So<br/>
Varsoon must be in the upper 20&#39;s or higher.<br/>

Wow, I was told wrong then. I was told that Varsoon<br/>
was the tough one. I dont think that Varsoon the<br/>
Undead was in at the time, maybe he was changed?<br/>

&gt; Varsoon is much lower, in the teens, but when you<br/>
&gt; kill Varsoon, Varsoon the<br/>
&gt; Undying spawns.  He looks like a zombie and is MUCH<br/>
&gt; tougher.  He was blue to<br/>
&gt; me at 35, so not sure exactly his level.  I wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; able to take him solo,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s for sure.  I heard that after he chased me<br/>
&gt; running and screaming like<br/>
&gt; a girl into surefall glade, he was killed by a level<br/>
&gt; 50 wiz, who I guess had<br/>
&gt; killed Varsoon in the first place.<br/>
