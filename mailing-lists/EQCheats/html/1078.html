&gt; &gt; there own server?  could you give me(us) more<br/>
&gt; information about this please? <br/>
&gt; &gt;   hehehe...it&#39;d be neato to have my own server for<br/>
&gt; just me and my friends ;) <br/>
&gt; &gt;   no $10/mo either.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; hmmm...interesting...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; please give me all the info you can or point me<br/>
&gt; somewhere where I can get <br/>
&gt; &gt; the info.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; thanks,<br/>

&gt; &gt; PS..could they interact with NPCs at all or just<br/>
&gt; walk around?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Why is everyone assuming that the datastream is<br/>
&gt; encrypted?  Within<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;a month of attempting it another group had an<br/>
&gt; everquest *SERVER* &gt;emulator <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;that was able to have a client walk around the<br/>
&gt; world and see &gt;monsters that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;they spawned.  Surely you don&#39;t think they had<br/>
&gt; time to &gt;break ANY encoding <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;and *STILL* be able to analyize the protocol to<br/>
&gt; &gt;the point of having a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;working server do you?<br/>

&gt; This project is no more due to lawsuit threats from<br/>
&gt; Verant towards the party that was designing it. It<br/>
&gt; was the same group of people that desidned the first<br/>
&gt; UO emulators and they had a screenshot of the EQ<br/>
&gt; emulator which showed various monsters (which I had<br/>
&gt; never seen) al grouped together in what appeared to<br/>
&gt; be East Commons. It was real and it worked but they<br/>
&gt; decided not to release because of the threats and<br/>
&gt; because they said tehy loved the game too much to<br/>
&gt; make the creators mad. They also said tehy decided<br/>
&gt; not to release it because the code could make it<br/>
&gt; possible for cheats to be developed that would take<br/>
&gt; advantage of the real EQ servers and they didn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; to ruin the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was called Emuq and the link to the website was:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.swileys.com/emuq/">http://www.swileys.com/emuq/</a><br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know if anything about it is still there or<br/>
&gt; not. But that is/was the link.<br/>
