<b>Subject:</b> Re: General information about Kerra Island <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643312647">A Magician friend of mine spent some time on Kerra<br/>
Island killing the cat people for their gems...  <br/>
<br/>
I went there once and found :<br/>
<br/>
they run away pretty quick and bring back (stronger)<br/>
friends...<br/>
at level 10 most things were either green or red ..<br/>
<br/>
while I was there a high level group from one of the<br/>
Guilds came and said they were gonna sweep the island<br/>
and kill the boss man......    they all died - there<br/>
were dead bodies everywhere...<br/>
<br/>
I would sau, unless you have root, or snare or a pet<br/>
to chase them down - it is not worth the<br/>
travelling....<br/>
