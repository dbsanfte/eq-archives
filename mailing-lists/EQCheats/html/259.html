<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064407848">No, you don&#39;t lose exp from dueling or PvP.  I belive you lose exp in a duel<br/>
if you die from a DOT or a pet, but this may have been fixed.  I love to<br/>
duel -- my guild often holds sparring matches, not only to test drive your<br/>
char in PvP, but we compare characters and do groups duels to find the best<br/>
group PvP combos. (We are a dark race guild on Rallos Zek, so we role-play<br/>
evil).  I think that when we do group sparring, it is the best way to<br/>
practice PvP.  Esp when you go hunting humans, like we do.  Strategies<br/>
against a good necro and his pet do not always apply to a SK/Cleric combo.<br/>
<br/>
As I said before, I am a Cleric and I LOVE grouping with my Enchanter<br/>
friend.  After we buff each other, we have about 300 extra AC and HP&#39;s if<br/>
not more... after all, with the two of us in a group we have some of the<br/>
best buffing spells in the game.  When I am NOT fighting with a warriorr<br/>
class, it is hard because as soon as I smite/expulse, I am targeted and it<br/>
it too hard to heal or cast because my concentration is broken.  The only<br/>
reason I like to fight with a SK is they taunt.  But with my enchanter<br/>
friend, you get it all -- I buff, he de-buffs, I smite, his pet taunts, and<br/>
his pets also double-attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Azboklin, you&#39;re right about pets in general.  I think it&#39;s just a matter of<br/>
personal preference.  imho though, as a Cleric, and I tihnk being a DE has<br/>
something to do with it -- Enchanters are the BEST to group with and PvP<br/>
with.  But to answer your questions, no you don&#39;t lose exp in PvP yes you<br/>
lose all the money on your person and the victor has his choice of one item<br/>
from your inventory (heh which is why when I am about to die I shove my<br/>
screaming mace in my bag)<br/>

Geez, this list is active like nuts!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in the dueling stuff.<br/>
Do you loose exp if you die in a /duel match or one of those pvp areas like<br/>
in qeynos?<br/>
You loose the money you currently have on you?  Do you loose any items?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so psyched that lots o people say enchanters kick ass, cause I&#39;m an<br/>
enchanter (yay!).<br/>
<br/>
Necro pets are definately way more powerful and necs of the same level can<br/>
summon higher level pets<br/>
than enchanters.<br/>
<br/>
The trick with enchanter pets is if you can get debuffs off on the mob<br/>
before anything (like languid pace), your pet has a WAY much better chance<br/>
of surviving.<br/>
<br/>
I get annoyed too cause sometimes my pets are weak and die REALLY REALLY<br/>
FAST, but if I get a decent<br/>
one, and treat it nice, its good to me too.  And I make sure to be careful<br/>
(not have a pet) when running around places with aggressive mobs.  Thats<br/>
when pets really suck big time.  They taunt the hell outa everthing.<br/>
