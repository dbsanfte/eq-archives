Let me get an understanding of this. Can anyone charge a proofreading fee?<br/>
What exactly is it? I guess I&#39;ve been out of the scaming business too long<br/>

Here is how my lawyer put it to me.  If someone sends you unsolicited email<br/>
once it is fine, but if you warn them after that email saying the following<br/>
or close to it +ACI-any further emails to this address will cost a certain<br/>
amount of money to proofread+ACI- it is legally binding.  If the person does not<br/>
make a payment within 3 months you can take them to small claims court and<br/>
charge interest on your time and work.  When you warn them, and they send<br/>
you another email just correct it and send it back to them.  Afterwards<br/>
start litigation.  This is an excellent way to stop hate/spam/annoying<br/>
emails.<br/>
