<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648748899">A friend of mine was grouped with a guide&#39;s lesser character for exploring<br/>
who was very lose tongued about Kedge Keep.<br/>
They were killing in unrest when my friend asked if the guide/char knew<br/>
anything about the area or about a &quot;rumored&quot; keep under the water. Getting<br/>
excited the guide made my friend promise not to tell and then proceeded to<br/>
tell him of a cool suit of some kind of magical plate (with some type of<br/>
elemental enchantment) as well as a hammer that is supposed to be one of the<br/>
ultimate cleric weapons. Im not sure if it is a quest piece for the hammer<br/>
or the hammer itself but when my friend tried to ask more about it the guide<br/>
shut up real quick.<br/>
He was saying it is held/guarded by an undead knight or ghoul knight about<br/>
45+ (sk possibly)<br/>
the armor is supposed to be light is medium sized and has the elemental<br/>
effect (defensive offensive is unknown) after hearing this I thought there<br/>
may be a good reason to explore kedge keep. If anyone explores or hears<br/>
anything else let me know.... IM thinking about making a cleric just to go<br/>
check this out.</div>
