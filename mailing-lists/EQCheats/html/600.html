<div id="ygrps-yiv-127981791"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; From: Doug Sorensen &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:belgarth_of_surefall@...">belgarth_of_surefall@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I like to see my character advance, to wait 8 to 10<br/>
&gt; hours for a level is definately a bit much. Especially<br/>
&gt; since I can then only gain 26 hit points and 5 of each<br/>
&gt; skill.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey, don&#39;t get me wrong, I like to see my character advance as much as the<br/>
next guy!  But I don&#39;t think that it is too much to ask that 8-10 hours of<br/>
playtime is too much... That means that to max out (at 50) would take<br/>
400-500 hours... that is a LOT of playing time, and that (to me anyway) is a<br/>
GOOD thing, not a bad thing!  It means that I can either do it FAST (12hrs a<br/>
day x 40 days) or slow (4hrs a day x 120 days)... Do you want the game over<br/>
in a month or a year, it is up to you after all...  As to your HP&#39;s, well,<br/>
there are other classes and characters that get more...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There are some people that do nothing other than play<br/>
&gt; Everquest, not surprising they are level 50. After I<br/>
&gt; would reach level 50 I would try another class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I feel the same way!  Although now that I have gone over level 20, I am<br/>
looking at starting another one in addition to my cleric, that I will play<br/>
&#39;part time&#39; (perhaps 25% of my playing time) until I get up to Level 50, or<br/>
get bored, whichever comes first.<br/>
<br/>
But I am not a power leveler myself, in fact, most people in my &#39;circle of<br/>
friends&#39; that I have played with over the past couple of months are about<br/>
3-8 levels above me!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think the game should have been designed with a<br/>
&gt; higher cap, say 100 and spread the skill points over<br/>
&gt; that range.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This would only make you &#39;Feel Better&#39; or worse, depending on you... If you<br/>
want to feel better about it, figure it at 250 levels... and picture in your<br/>
mind that each bubble is one level... In any case, it is just a numbers<br/>
game...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Imagine people that can&#39;t play 20 hours a week, say 5<br/>
&gt; hours a week due to work, school and family<br/>
&gt; constraints. then you have to go 2 weeks at your same<br/>
&gt; level.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, and they can still enjoy the game just as much if they are not stuck<br/>
into the &#39;Level up&#39; attitude... Again, those that are into &#39;Leveling up&#39;<br/>
will do so... they will power level themselves, play 10-15 hours a day,<br/>
etc... That is not me though... or I wouldn&#39;t still be Level 22 after<br/>
playing for over 18 days (game clock days - actually over 430 hours total<br/>
time)... Do the math and you will see that I average about 1 level every 19<br/>
hours... hehe... not that great really, but I have lots of fun!  I have seen<br/>
MANY others who get to level 20 in HALF that time (or less).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Part of it goes along with not enjoying my ranger<br/>
&gt; anymore. I am level 26, near broke and half my armor<br/>
&gt; is banded because Rubicite is the next level since we<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t wear any normal plate. I will probably start a<br/>
&gt; cleric and see how it goes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Belgarth<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Welcome to the club!  I am level 22 now, have over 100plat in bank, but at<br/>
level 24 I will need to spend around 70plat for my spells... I have banded<br/>
armor (I made myself - smithing) and still need to waste a bunch of money on<br/>
my smithing too!  My character CAN wear plate, but it is soooo heavy and<br/>
expensive I don&#39;t bother...<br/>
<br/>
All in all, my cleric does all right most of the time... I usually only get<br/>
killed 1-2 times per level... hehe...<br/>
