&gt; On vallon zek, I was amazed at the hobbit druids who leveled so<br/>
&gt; quickly.  I was told that there was some sort of quest which gives<br/>
&gt; INSANE experience and that it was being heavily exploited.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone know what this is?  I may want to try a stuntie, and any leg up<br/>
&gt; is sure a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
There was a quest that was taken out of atleast one server due to<br/>
exploitation where you were given an item by someone in the halfling town to<br/>
give to a guard who wanders from point A to B and then dissapears once per<br/>
game day.  What someone did is attacked the guard and ran to the person who<br/>
gave the quest, and then died.  Someone standing next to the person who gave<br/>
the quest would then hail the guard locking him in place.  You then could<br/>
receive the quest, and give the item to the guard gaining xp and faction.<br/>
People went from first to 12th level like this in a matter of hours before<br/>
being banned.  It&#39;s possible though unlikely this quest (Or any quest like<br/>
it) is still in the game.<br/>
