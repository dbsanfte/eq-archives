<div id="ygrps-yiv-541485517">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Actually, there is one important thing that is handled completely on the<br/>
&gt; client side.  That is, where you are in the world.  (Proof, sit in a spot,<br/>
&gt; unplug your ethernet cable from the back of your PC, run 1000 spaces,<br/>
&gt; plug it back in, see that you&#39;re still there and not at the other place.)<br/>
&gt; So it should be possible to modify the X/Y/Z location in the client and<br/>
&gt; have that information passed on to the server...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also believe what targeting happens only on client side. If client is<br/>
notified about monster (update has been sent from server what such<br/>
monster exists) you can target it without server check. Afaik targeting<br/>
in EQ uses bounding boxes tracing, and im sure it is made by client, not<br/>
server. So, because you can shoot your DDs through walls and monsters in<br/>
most cases cannot move through walls, it can be ultimate cheating.<br/>
Target any monster in dungeon on client, and nuke him from behind a wall<br/>
without any opposition. Of course, server do not send ALL monsters in<br/>
zone to client, so you dont know their IDs and cannot target them at<br/>
all, but you possible can target any mob in ~30 meters radius.</div>
