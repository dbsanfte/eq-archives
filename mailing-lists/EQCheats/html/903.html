&gt; &gt;There is no anti-camp vode in this game. You should sit in the room &gt;not<br/>
&gt; &gt;the little corridor because sitting in the corridor pulls moosh &gt;from the<br/>
&gt; &gt;basement cells.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I got my boots on my second visit, luckyly in about 4 hours, 2 boots<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;spawned back to back so the magician that was with me got a pair too.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Was wondering where you get your info from? I have spoken with GM&#39;s and<br/>
&gt; guides alike - there IS anti-camping coding in the game. They&#39;re just not<br/>
&gt; implemented everywhere! You need to figure out where they are. I personally<br/>
&gt; have tested areas in Befallen, and have found it to be true, because certain<br/>
&gt; creatures spawn quicker with no campers in the area. In other areas,<br/>
&gt; creatures spawn just as quickly with or without campers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And even if you don&#39;t believe me, what do you think having a 4+ hour respawn<br/>
&gt; rate is? Chopped liver? In my book, that&#39;s just another form of anti-camping<br/>
&gt; code meant to discourage camping to me!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even if there was any anticamping areas areas which I doubt very much I don&#39;t think the solution is<br/>
to make a monster spawn once every 12 hours and only have the item every tenth time it spawns. Some<br/>
people that pay to play this game and want a certain object have to work, sleep and other stuff in<br/>
real life and can&#39;t camp for 18 hours straight like the students. And when I&#39;ve killed bonecracker<br/>
11 times in a row and still don&#39;t get a whip its just plain boring. I already shown that I can kill<br/>
him. Let me have my whip so I can leave and let some other person try...</div>
