<div id="ygrps-yiv-971634083">I think it&#39;s good that they lowered the rate of higher weapons being <br/>
dropped...that way the price will remain a little high, and there isn&#39;t <br/>
going to be as much twinking with weapons if you need to camp an area for 3 <br/>
hours to get it I&#39;m sure you aren&#39;t going to give it away for free as much <br/>
as you would had you gotten 10 in those same 3 hours.<br/>
