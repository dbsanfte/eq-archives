<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487730790">i was assuming those 3 items were off of the great beast nagafen herself.  <br/>
the eq&#39;lizer paragraph leading up to the items said &quot;looks like theres been <br/>
more dragon slaying recently,&quot; and then proceeded to tempt us with 3 <br/>
outstanding items.<br/>

&gt;Subject: LJ and the quest for crook staff<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have been hunting Lockjaw lately. I have got the kill on him 4 times in 2<br/>
&gt;days. And he dropped the crook one time. I gave it to a friend to be nice<br/>
&gt;since my 2H blunt is still at can&#39;t hit anything. BUT after seeing EQ&#39;lizer<br/>
&gt;and the new druid only crook. I REALLY want to get my skill up to a decent<br/>
&gt;area. So I&#39;d like to know how often LJ drops a crook. And if I need to step<br/>
&gt;up the LJ hunt to get a crook.<br/>
