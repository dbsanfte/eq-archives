<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624196675">Yeah lets look at the things he has said regarding the stuff he<br/>
carries....<br/>
<br/>
Flaming sword - &quot;No groups currently active have enough firepower to get<br/>
the Avenger&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Green Splinted Plate - &quot;It would require several groups of 50 level<br/>
characters ready to die to get one piece&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yet all the things he wears are &quot;attainable&quot;.......If you have a bunch<br/>
of powergamer types all at level 50 that don&#39;t mind you taking all the<br/>
loot to get the gear.<br/>
