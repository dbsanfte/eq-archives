&gt; Good point -- a typical work year is 2080 hours.  I did a /play and I felt<br/>
&gt; like I was hit with a brick.  I clocked about 400 hours since the game came<br/>
&gt; out, in March.  I started the day it came out.  Do you know what I could do<br/>
&gt; with my life with 400 extra hours?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Needless to say, I quit the game this week.<br/>
