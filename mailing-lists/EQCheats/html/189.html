<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264550187"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Which server is the test server?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No such thing as a stupid question.  I believe you have to run EQTEST.EXE or<br/>
something to that effect.  I do NOT believe it puts an icon in your<br/>
Everquest group for you.  You will have to go to your EVERQUEST directory<br/>
and run the executable directly.  I have yet to create a character on the<br/>
test server, so I could be mistaken, but I believe that is the process</div>
