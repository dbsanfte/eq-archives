<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-913670705">Shouldn&#39;t work, as all crucial info is stored server side (like UO, and<br/>
unlike Diablo). This is what allowed people to hack Diablo, but not UO (as<br/>
far as character stats). Might work for some other things though, like<br/>
getting into closed zones or something, who knows.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little surprised no one has hacked the graphics files and come out<br/>
with a way to modify the files PC side to take away some affects, such as<br/>
night, blindness, spell effects, rain, etc. I remember when I played UO,<br/>
someone hacked the graphics and I ran this program that took away all walls<br/>
and roofs of all structures, so you could see inside (wall was still there,<br/>
you could only SEE inside). Quite funny though walking around seeing<br/>
everyone&#39;s thousands of reagants they had gotten from duping... *sigh*<br/>

Fairly easily and seemingly possible idea for this why not try<br/>
networking....logging on but before actually playing the game while on news<br/>
screen try replacing the files. That way you crack the file replace the<br/>
actual file right before logging on and wen their servers go to pull the<br/>
info bingo they pull the cracked file. Real quick real easy and you have a<br/>
super pumped character. Just use another computer to place the file. There<br/>
may be the possibility of &quot;file in use&quot; error messages but highly unlikely<br/>
as you wouldn&#39;t be logged on as of that time.<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea<br/>
