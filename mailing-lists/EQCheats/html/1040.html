<div id="ygrps-yiv-862331406">Sorry, but your &quot;hope something comes of this&quot; when you found you could<br/>
ALT - TAB out of the game and hope someone could write a cheat program says<br/>
it all. If you played it straight on Diablo and had a good time, why would<br/>
you want people to write a cheat program to exploit EverQuest. That just<br/>
doesn&#39;t make any sense to me. UNLESS you are the kind of person that needs<br/>
to cheat to have fun. If you&#39;re not, I apologize, but then I just don&#39;t<br/>
understand why you would sent that email.<br/>

&gt; I did not say that I had to cheat to have fun with EQ.  I have lots of fun<br/>
&gt; and haven&#39;t taken advantage of any of the &quot;cheats&quot; that this list has<br/>
&gt; provided.  I use the guest info, but I don&#39;t trap monsters or anything.<br/>
&gt; From Diablo I was one of the ppl that made it to level 50 with no cheats,<br/>
&gt; and only items that I found so I knew they were legit.  I also had a<br/>
&gt; hacked-to-heck character on Diablo b/c sometimes I think it&#39;s fun to run<br/>
&gt; around and kill anything ya darn well please.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; if I had to cheat to have fun I wouldn&#39;t play EQ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; please note lack of flames.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It&#39;s players like you that make me sick. Why the hell bother playing this<br/>
&gt; &gt;game, if you need to cheat at it to have fun. Go bother someone else&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;game.<br/>
