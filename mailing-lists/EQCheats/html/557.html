<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214460331">Someone was asking about smithing skill.  If you plan to get into smithing,<br/>
you will probibly spend around 300-400+ plat to get up to around the 100<br/>
lev.  I have not seen any item that can be sold back to npc&#39;s for a profit.<br/>
But when you get up to the lev where you can make banded armor, it is a item<br/>
that other players will buy at a good profit.  Now if they could add in the<br/>
making of weapons I would be realy happy<br/>
