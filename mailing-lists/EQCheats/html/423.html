<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592924712">It is called the Staff of Writhing, and is gotten as an alternate drop off<br/>
the Noble kobold in Solusek B.  The other item the Noble drops is the<br/>
mithril bracer, which has the +5 wisdom (I forget the AC, I&#39;m so excited<br/>
about the wisdom!!).  I know this for a fact, because I have two mithril<br/>
bracers and have acquired two Writing Staffs.  They are GREAT trade items<br/>
BTW to casters.</div>
