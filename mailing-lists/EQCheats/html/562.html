<div id="ygrps-yiv-810467890">Sure... many mobs carry the blocks of ore... hey, and they only weigh<br/>
15lbs!!  Heck, you can carry 3-4 of them if you have good Strength!!  That<br/>
will save LOTS of money... yeah, right...  I would rather leave them behind<br/>
and carry a FS or Bronze sword that weighs less and is worth MUCH more...<br/>
<br/>
I really think that if Verant keeps making skills LESS profitable (or no<br/>
breakeven), then they will be encouraging players to quit doing skills all<br/>
together, which means that even MORE players will be out in the &#39;battle&#39;<br/>
zones...<br/>
<br/>
I would think they would want to ENCOURAGE people to learn skills rather<br/>
than the opposite... I think their reasoning (which is probably money<br/>
related) is kind of ontrack in that they don&#39;t want a level 5 player selling<br/>
Banded all the time and being able to buy &#39;high end&#39; weapons and armor which<br/>
would normally be out of reach of his level...<br/>
<br/>
Verant should ENCOURAGE people to practice their skills... Give them a<br/>
Faction adjustment with the NPC&#39;s or something... Give them some EXPERIENCE<br/>
when they go from one level to another (or every 10 levels)<br/>
<br/>
The same thing goes with languages... Why would MOST of us want (or need) to<br/>
learn different languages (like Dragon)??  Are we going to talk to dragons<br/>
with it??  No... But it would be a nice gesture if after learning a new<br/>
language (to expert level) that we got a little experience for it...<br/>
<br/>
After all, what IS experience?  If we only get it from battle (or some<br/>
quests), maybe they shouldn&#39;t call it experience... Maybe they need to call<br/>
it Battle Points instead...<br/>
<br/>
It sure seems strange to me that we would NOT get any experience gain for<br/>
things like Practicing a Trade and/or Learning a language...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just a shame that the ONLY way you can gain experience is by killing<br/>
things (even in most quests you must kill something)...<br/>

&gt; profits are still to be had in some respects in certain skills - you just<br/>
&gt; have to be willing to do a little work ... like getting your own ores and<br/>
&gt; clays, and not buying them from the store.  That alone will save you a lot<br/>
&gt; of money, not a lot of time, but a lot of money. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Someone was asking about smithing skill.  If you plan to get into<br/>
&gt; smithing,<br/>
&gt; &gt; you will probibly spend around 300-400+ plat to get up to around the 100<br/>
&gt; &gt; lev.  I have not seen any item that can be sold back to npc&#39;s for a<br/>
&gt; profit.<br/>
&gt; &gt; But when you get up to the lev where you can make banded armor, it is a<br/>
&gt; item<br/>
&gt; &gt; that other players will buy at a good profit.  Now if they could add in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; making of weapons I would be realy happy<br/>
