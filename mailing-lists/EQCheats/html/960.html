<div id="ygrps-yiv-206469819">Hey hey, I can see what your saying, but true cheats are so uncommon in EQ,<br/>
that it&#39;s odd when you actually see one (especially a new one). Alot of us<br/>
are used to UO where cheats where common, you rarely got found out, and the<br/>
GMs were so overworked they didn&#39;t give a shit when you used em. It&#39;s NOT<br/>
the same thing here, from what I can tell.<br/>
<br/>
And, the trapping thing can and will get you banned. People will petition<br/>
your ass and a GM WILL come (I petitioned one guy that pissed me off - AND<br/>
was trapping - and a GM was there inside of 20 minutes).<br/>
<br/>
AND, I see your point. I for one will not be responding to emails saying<br/>
stupid shit like &quot;Hey you stupid shit, that&#39;s a cheat! That&#39;ll get you<br/>
banned!&quot; HA! This is a little insane! I get it now!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

All, <br/>
<br/>
It seems every time that someone posts a cheat that might be frowned<br/>
upon by the GM&#39;s, numerous people feel the need to chime in that it<br/>
might be frowned upon by the GM&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I know you all mean well, but this *IS* a cheat list, and it&#39;s a bit<br/>
tiring to get 5 emails about the dangers of doing &quot;X&quot; for every mail<br/>
that we get about &quot;X&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Might I suggest that the owner of this list put that disclaimer at the<br/>
bottom of the list or make it part of the &quot;Hello, welcome to EQ<br/>
cheats...&quot; subscription notice?<br/>
<br/>
Just one man&#39;s opinion.<br/>
