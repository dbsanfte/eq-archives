<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-533505736">I was cruising AllaKhazam&#39;s site, and saw this quest for the Gnoll Slayer<br/>
sword. Note: The following is taken DIRECTLY from AllaKhazam&#39;s site<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/quests/Q_QHills.htm#The">http://everquest.gamestats.com/quests/Q_QHills.htm#The</a> Gnoll Slayer)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Gnoll Slayer:  Marton Sayor in the cottage in Qeynos Hills is concerned<br/>
about the safety of his infant son.  He says he will give you the gnoll<br/>
slayer long sword if you help him.  Marton mentions a named gnoll named Lord<br/>
Elgnub who speaks common tongue, and has threatened his family.  Well, Lord<br/>
Elgnub can occasionally be found wandering around blackburrow.  He looks<br/>
like a Splitpaw Gnoll and is approximately level 20.  If you kill him you<br/>
will get a lore/no drop item Baby Joseph Slayer.  Take the baby back to his<br/>
father and the grateful man will give you a Gnoll Slayer sword, which is a<br/>
1H slashing, 6/28 lore weapon.  Not altogether exciting, but he mentions<br/>
something about the true potential of the sword.  If you inquire further, he<br/>
mentions there was once an enchantment placed upon a gnolls eye which was<br/>
embedded in the sword that gave the sword powers to protect against disease<br/>
and call forth a wolf to fight for you. (Sounds like the scimitar of the<br/>
Mistwalker).  He then says this eye has been stolen, along with the only<br/>
book that can restore the enchantment and eye to the sword.  The thief is a<br/>
great, one-eyed, white gnoll.  He provides no further information and says<br/>
he&#39;s been hunting for this gnoll for a long time.   (Submitted by Durgo)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Was wondering if anyone has completed this quest, or knows where the White<br/>
One Eyed gnolls are? The white gnolls I know of are in Lake Rathe, the<br/>
Embalmers at night, and the Undead Reavers in NK. I don&#39;t think they have<br/>
one eye though...<br/>
<br/>
Any clues?</div>
