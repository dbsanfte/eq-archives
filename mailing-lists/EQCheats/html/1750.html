<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034496149">I think your statement is worth mentioning to people.<br/>
The first hack I was going to submit had its site destroyed. That one <br/>
did not follow the terms of agreement, and yes, was illegal, however, <br/>
I think you should all read about the second one.<br/>
The second one is completely legal, and you cannot lose your account <br/>
using it. The EverQuest officials don&#39;t like it very much, but they <br/>
have to live with it. They are not allowed to delete your account, <br/>
even if they were to found out you were using it and in the part of <br/>
EverQuest. GM&#39;s absolutely hate it, and most of them would delete <br/>
your account, though they are not allowed, if they found out. If they <br/>
were to do this, you could complain to Sony and they would be FORCED <br/>
to give your account back. All the EverQuest officials know about <br/>
this second one, and they can&#39;t do anything about it. It isn&#39;t a <br/>
third party program, and does not, in any of the rules and terms of <br/>
agreement, go against what they say. <br/>
I do repeat that they already know about this. They cannot do <br/>
anything about it, and they don&#39;t really care. The only people who <br/>
actually care are the GM&#39;s because, they lose there power over other <br/>
players. They like the power, and that is why they delete other <br/>
accounts. They can get in serious trouble with Sony if they were to <br/>
do this. <br/>
I have so far met 1 GM from EverQuest that has decided to join this. <br/>
They were one of the few GM&#39;s that were at Lead-Administrator status <br/>
or lower that thought this was neat. This thing has been worked on <br/>
almost since EverQuest was made. <br/>
This is completely legal. On there site, they show that they are not <br/>
affilitated with the EverQuest makers/programmers, and show the <br/>
EverQuest trademark at the bottom.<br/>
It was very nice that you thought about that first, and I totally <br/>
agree. The first one will not be added because the site was <br/>
destroyed, and the version I have on my computer no longer works with <br/>
EverQuest because they updated the patch.<br/>
I am adding in the one thing tomorrow. Many people like this, and it <br/>
is growing every day ever since Guild Wars started =). I haven&#39;t <br/>
really tried it yet myself, but Guild Wars is supposed to be amazing.<br/>
From your proud GM of this thing:<br/>
(Lord Deimos The Slaughterer) Currently second in command on two <br/>
servers and GM on five other servers, 7 total.<br/>
And when you join, look for my great GM friends too =)<br/>

Interesting GM Facts:<br/>
Did you know that there are 157 GM Commands<br/>
Did you know that the Plane of Time B has 4 Hidden Areas<br/>
Did you know that load is a zone (GM)<br/>
Did you know that Sun Set Home is a zone (GM)<br/>
Did you know that load is a plane<br/>
Did you know that Gm-Impossible and Mgmt are not what they are really <br/>
called<br/>
Gm-Impossible = Server Debugger (Highest Rank)<br/>
Mgmg = Server Operator (Second Highest Rank)<br/>
Did you know that GM&#39;s can go invisible whenever they want<br/>
Did you know that a GM shrine is when 1 or more GM&#39;s are present in <br/>
an area as an NPC recommded size of 20 or higher<br/>
Did you know that every time a GM changes your first name, you go <br/>
Linkdead<br/>
Did you know that GM&#39;s are people too (HARD HARD QUESTION lol)<br/>
Did you know an event is when a GM is at an area and starts spawning <br/>
stuff with really awesome items (That would be my main thing next to <br/>
Zone Building)<br/>
Did you know that the GM commands do not start with / like /kill, <br/>
they start with #, #kill<br/>
Did you know that GM&#39;s have hacking commands? <br/>
#gmspeed on (Makes you run really really fast) Permanent unless <br/>
turned off, that means you log off and log back on, and you still <br/>
have it.<br/>
#flymode 1 (Makes you fly) Not permanent<br/>
#haste 85 (Makes you have haste by 85%) Not permanent<br/>
Did you know that when you make your name too long, it makes these <br/>
awesome symbols at the end of it that change every time you move<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy these fun facts, and ask around the servers for:<br/>
Lord<br/>
Lord Deimos<br/>
Deimos<br/>
Lord Deimos The Slaughterer<br/>
Those are my world-wide names =). Lord Deimos The Slaughterer is my <br/>
name on all the servers I am GM on, which are listed above<br/>
Just about everyone knows me now<br/>
Look for my GM buddies too</div>
