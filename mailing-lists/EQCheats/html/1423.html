&gt;Does anyone know of anything about a weapon called the &quot;Kilij&quot; ?  I am on<br/>
&gt;the quest, and i am looking for &#39;the plans for the kilij&#39;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s what it&#39;s called, it&#39;s the plans on how the kilij is made, so i can<br/>
&gt;take them to the guy who can make them, Any info or anyone selling such an<br/>
&gt;item on Cazic Thule would be welcomed.<br/>
