<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242372275">I&#39;m mostly a solo guy, and since Qeynos hills is a newbie zone, there <br/>
usually isn&#39;t anyone 30+ to group with right there.  You are correct that a <br/>
small group should have no problems taking him.<br/>
<br/>
The one time that I killed Varsoon the necro he had nothing but a rusty <br/>
dagger, so I&#39;m guessing that I was either unlucky, he is like Pyzjn and has <br/>
at item that is only rare drop, or he is like the other low level necro that <br/>
spawns in the zone that never drops anything except a rusty dagger.<br/>
<br/>
Since I wasn&#39;t expecting the Varsoon the Undying when I killed Varsoon the <br/>
necro the first time, I wasn&#39;t ready for him, and I zoned at BB.  I kited <br/>
him pretty far so I didn&#39;t know he was a spellcaster, sounds like I lucked <br/>
out big time. &lt;G&gt;  After I zoned back I found that someone else had trained <br/>
him to the guards, so no body, and no one found out what he drops (if <br/>
anything).<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;m hearing a variety of levels, I&#39;m guessing that he is either a <br/>
variable level spawn or he is different levels on different servers (I&#39;ve <br/>
come across that before, was a big flame war on another list over two people <br/>
who were sure the same crit was a different level...)<br/>
<br/>
What Pyzjn drops is the Glowing Black Stone, it is held in off hand (might <br/>
be able to hold it in either hand, not sure) and grants +9 int and +10 sv <br/>
magic...used to be the best thing for a caster to hold in his off hand <br/>
before the glowing stein quest went public.<br/>
<br/>
Problem is getting Pyzjn to spawn...I have seen him a total ot 2 times, and <br/>
neither time did he have the damn rock.  I have heard he is on a 6 hour <br/>
spawn, and Varsoon, Pyzjn, and one other low level necro that drops jack <br/>
might spawn every 6 hours.  Rumor only though.  Also, the damn rock is damn <br/>
rare, about the same as getting Drez to drop jboots....about a 10% chance <br/>
every time he spawns &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most people hear about the cool item, go the qeynos hills for a weekend, <br/>
never even see the bastard, and give up in disgust.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m heading back there to replenish my stock of bat wings, so maybe I&#39;ll see <br/>
one of them and have more info later.  I&#39;ll keep you posted if I come across <br/>
anyting interesting.<br/>

&gt;do the pair of them drop? And what does Pyzgin drop? Shimmering Orb or<br/>
&gt;something wierd for mage types (I be a shaman, so have no interest in it).<br/>

&gt;Kiting him is next to impossible, he casts the necro line of darkness <br/>
&gt;spells<br/>
&gt;on you, which makes you feel like you are creeping, and i had jboots and it<br/>
&gt;was like i was 180/65 overweight. can&#39;t kite under those conditions<br/>
