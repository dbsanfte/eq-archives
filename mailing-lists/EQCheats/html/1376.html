<div id="ygrps-yiv-258734208">I have a question about the quest.. I am helping my enchanter friend with<br/>
the quest, and I was wondering.. If I get the items at the same time, ie she<br/>
has one set and i have my own.. if by the end of the quest, i can give her<br/>
the stuff I&#39;ve got and she can complete it for me.. or is any of the stuff<br/>
No drop ? This way she can get a stein and I can get a stein also ? Oh yeah<br/>
i am high elf mage, so I know I can&#39;t get the item myself..<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
