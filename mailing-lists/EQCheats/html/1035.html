&gt; As a programmer, I know the hazards associated with  third party<br/>
&gt; Programs fudging your data. The way EQ is set up, any<br/>
&gt; modifications you make are reflected in YOUR computer&#39;s memory,<br/>
&gt; and maybe even your display, but NOT on veran&#39;ts server. You<br/>
&gt; FEED commands to Verant, the actions are resolved on the server,<br/>
&gt; and the RESULTS are sent back to you. You may modify the commands<br/>
&gt; sent, or the results on your screen, and it won&#39;t change what<br/>
&gt; happens to your character on verants servers at all. It is a great<br/>
&gt; way to preclude tampering. You may change your screen to show<br/>
&gt; 50000pp, but try to buy something.... The next screen update will<br/>
&gt; show your real totals... Your character and all interaction with it<br/>
&gt; are done BY Verant on their own servers. You have NO real contact with<br/>
&gt; anything that must be modified for any kind of cheat to work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>aye, the best you could do would be... stop/start the rain... change night / day....<br/>
and stuff like that. but no permanent changes in your character at all. Maybe, but<br/>
just maybe you could get rid of root, blind and spells like that ... just intercept the<br/>
server feed using some program to tunnel it and remove/add commands from the<br/>
feed , the server would think you are rooted but since your EQ client didnt recieve<br/>
the command to root you it would let you move freely.<br/>
<br/>
Its kinda easy to do this kind of stuff... it isnt a MAJOR hack since it wont change<br/>
exp, stats, items and stuff like that but it would give you BIG advantage in PvP.<br/>
<br/>
Its kida easy to do that if you know how to play around with sockets and have control<br/>
of a DNS server (since the update server name and all the other servers names are hard<br/>
coded and/or sent through TCP/UDP stream, you need a way to make your EQ client belive<br/>
he is connecting in the server while its actually connecting in your local machine)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, its easy to avoid this kind of cheat using any kind of encrypted stream (which would<br/>
increase lag) or any kind of security keys to let the server know if its really talking with your<br/>
EQ client or with any other third party software tunneling the stream.<br/>
<br/>
But does anyone ever tryed that and know how good Verant&#39;s security really is ? I dont have<br/>
the time and I really dont feel like giving all the effort to cheat EQ.<br/>
