<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-405663867">Pretty good stuff about unrest BUT, small bronze and FS can and does<br/>
load on any mobs equal to or higher level than the dry bones, and small<br/>
ringmail can load on anything larger than the yard trash.  You also<br/>
missed the Pugius dagger that loads on the minor sword fiend, kind a<br/>
rare spawn.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have spent a lot of time in Unrest lately, so here goes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Two classes really shine here since it is an Undead dungeon: Clerics<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; Paladins.  Make sure you have one of each if you can.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The zone is fairly small, consisting of a large mansion and the<br/>
&gt; surrounding courtyard.  The house has 4 floors and a basement.  It can<br/>
&gt; be confusing, so have a cleric invis you to undead and explore a bit.<br/>
&gt; be ready to run though.  trains build fairly quick as all undead KOS<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; are quick to help out their buddies.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Levels 14-16 can safely kill the yard trash(death beetles, Tormented<br/>
&gt; dead, Jack-o-lanterns)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Levels 17-20 should pull from the first and second floors of the<br/>
&gt; house(Ghouls, Dry bone skels, lurking mummies)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Levels 21-24 can safely camp a room on the third floor(Lots of skel<br/>
&gt; types, Carrion ghouls, specials)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Levels 24-30 can take the knight room on the 4th floor(Undead knight,<br/>
&gt; festering hags, greater dark bone)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Levels 30+ can begin to camp in the basement(Ghost, dark terrors,<br/>
&gt; mortuary fungus, lots of other nasties I don&#39;t want to mess with)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as items, there are several items of interest to come out of<br/>
&gt; Unrest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lesser loot <br/>
&gt; FS weapons - Carrion ghouls<br/>
&gt; Small ringmail - Carrion ghouls, barbed bone skels<br/>
&gt; Small bronze plate - Dry bone skels<br/>
&gt; Assorted gemstones - various<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Major loot		Mob				Auction Price <br/>
&gt; Dwarven Workboots 	Dwarven ghost  			800pp+<br/>
&gt; Jagged bands 		Dwarven ghost  			200pp<br/>
&gt; Bloodstained Tunic 	Knight of Unrest(rare drop) 	400pp+<br/>
&gt; Bloodstained Mantle 	Knight of Unrest			80pp<br/>
&gt; Ivory Bracelet 		Reanimated hand 		100pp+<br/>
&gt; bloodstained gloves 	Reclusive Ghoul Magi(rare drop) 	75+pp<br/>
