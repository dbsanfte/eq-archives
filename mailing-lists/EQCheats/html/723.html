<b>Subject:</b> Centaur info on Crafted Armor <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-758177447">Ok, I had a question about the crafted Armor, I know now that you can get it from the Centaur<br/>
Village in South Karana, now the thing I ASK is:<br/>
<br/>
1. What do I have to do to GET the crafted items started, *btw the armors light blue*<br/>
2. Is this a warriors only quest, or can anyone do it<br/>
3. Where do I get the items to complete this Quest, details on where and what holds them, *mobs,<br/>
vendors, places etc.<br/>
4. What are the stats on the Crafted items, i.e Can us lovely SHAMANS wear it<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All details can be sent to me, money is almost no option, but I don&#39;t want BS prices if you don&#39;t<br/>
know don&#39;t respond. I&#39;m the Grand Master of my guild and I would like to start gathering verified<br/>
information, that i can pass onto my guildmates as *Fact*.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time<br/>
