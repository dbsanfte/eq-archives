<div id="ygrps-yiv-294024810">No ONE person will be able to get the fiery avenger by himself.  It&#39;s<br/>
IMPOSSIBLE.  It takes 3 FULL groups to kill a dragon.  When a mob has<br/>
over 16k hit points, you&#39;re not gonna solo it by any means.  They made<br/>
it so the power weapons in this game were very hard to get.  You have to<br/>
EARN them.  And yes..  the fiery avenger is a paladin only sword.  It&#39;s<br/>
a fact.. deal with it.  And no one has it on any server.  It pays to<br/>
have friends in high places.  Get the inside scoop on many issues.. <br/>
Only thing that sucks is that ya have to deal with being jealous of<br/>
every one of them.</div>
