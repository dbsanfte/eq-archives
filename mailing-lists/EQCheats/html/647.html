<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866020272">Heh on Rubicite....Forget about it.<br/>
<br/>
In the works Rubicite will be takin away from all but true warrior classe.<br/>
i.e.  Warriors, Paladins, Shadowknights.  Verant is tired of CT being camped<br/>
so much and they think Rubicite is unbalancing the clasees.  Heh after all<br/>
it is plate and rogues and rangers not suppose to be able to wear plate.<br/>

&gt; I like to see my character advance, to wait 8 to 10<br/>
&gt; hours for a level is definately a bit much. Especially<br/>
&gt; since I can then only gain 26 hit points and 5 of each<br/>
&gt; skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are some people that do nothing other than play<br/>
&gt; Everquest, not surprising they are level 50. After I<br/>
&gt; would reach level 50 I would try another class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think the game should have been designed with a<br/>
&gt; higher cap, say 100 and spread the skill points over<br/>
&gt; that range.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Imagine people that can&#39;t play 20 hours a week, say 5<br/>
&gt; hours a week due to work, school and family<br/>
&gt; constraints. then you have to go 2 weeks at your same<br/>
&gt; level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Part of it goes along with not enjoying my ranger<br/>
&gt; anymore. I am level 26, near broke and half my armor<br/>
&gt; is banded because Rubicite is the next level since we<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t wear any normal plate. I will probably start a<br/>
&gt; cleric and see how it goes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You think that 8-10 hours is &quot;a bit much&quot; to gain a<br/>
&gt; &gt; level??  I play about 20<br/>
&gt; &gt; hours a week (on average) and gain about 1-2 levels,<br/>
&gt; &gt; which is about right...<br/>
&gt; &gt; if it was half that, then instead of being a level<br/>
&gt; &gt; 22 now, I would probably<br/>
&gt; &gt; already be up to 50!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I kinda thought that most people level up pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; fast myself... hehe... Who<br/>
&gt; &gt; would have thought that just 3 months into this<br/>
&gt; &gt; online game we would have<br/>
&gt; &gt; Level 50 players, and 4 months in, that we would<br/>
&gt; &gt; have TONS of them, and many<br/>
&gt; &gt; more level 40+ players!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I really didn&#39;t expect to reach level 50 for about a<br/>
&gt; &gt; year (at 20 hrs a week<br/>
&gt; &gt; that is about right too, it seems) so I think things<br/>
&gt; &gt; are pretty good<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself... I know many people are more interested in<br/>
&gt; &gt; leveling up as fast as<br/>
&gt; &gt; they can, but tell me, what do you do after you have<br/>
&gt; &gt; reached level 50 and<br/>
&gt; &gt; have played at that level for a month or more?  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think I would get pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; bored with it...<br/>
