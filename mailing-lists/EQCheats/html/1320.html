<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3 of our casters, 2 clerics and 1 enchanter  lost the ability to cast spells<br/>
&gt; during the melee.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t mean we were charmed or feared or roared.  I mean, all spell and<br/>
&gt; hotkey functions were gone, as if fear effect continued forever.<br/>
&gt; We were forced to camp to clear effect.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had almost same problems in PK battles on Tallon Zek. Even over 15 min<br/>
after battle game interface didnt function. I was able to walk using<br/>
keyboard, turn around with mouse, but no hotkey or spell were working.<br/>
Screen mode switching too, and i havnt been even able to camp because i<br/>
play in &quot;full screen&quot; mode and camp button was unreachable. That<br/>
happened to me 3 times, all times i was combating with necromancers and<br/>
enchanters. I believe problem is some enchanter spell, because i was<br/>
fighting with necros many times and only if enchanter was nearby i was<br/>
facing such problem. I was feared and charmed before and it never cause<br/>
me such problems, so single charm or fear is ok. Maybe some combo can<br/>
cause this, like fear+charm or fear+root or something like it. I believe<br/>
enchanter spell of 8-12 lvl is required to cause such problems, because<br/>
in fights against 20+ lvl enchanters i never experienced this problem,<br/>
only in fights with 8-12 lvl ones. BTW, my friend was in same situation<br/>
even more times than me, and he also crashed to Windows once, and once<br/>
was forced to reset his computer. We have written alot of petitions<br/>
about these bugs but none of them were answered.</div>
