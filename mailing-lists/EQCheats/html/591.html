<div id="ygrps-yiv-557982441">You really need to get off it.  They have been fixing all the probs<br/>
with the Necro&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see.   DOT bug.   corpse dissappears .. no loot no exp nothing<br/>
<br/>
Pets - ?  are you kidding ... Cant use in Duels unless your are +PVP.<br/>
  And pets are exceedingly dangerous in dungeons as they will either<br/>
self-destruct at any time, or randomly smack any npc they go by.   <br/>
Imagine EVERY npc in a dungeon coming after you then your tank (pet)<br/>
self destructing ! ! ! Happened to me in PAW !<br/>
And another stupid thing about pets.  Even if you get a decent one if<br/>
some dumbass gives a good pet a pathetic weapon like a Splintered Club<br/>
- he becomes useless.  And you have to recast and recast till you get<br/>
a decent pet.   Summon a green pet and watch how long he lasts.  I<br/>
believe I have actually heard the OTHER critters Laughing ...<br/>
<br/>
And No, Necros by themselves are not the masters of Kiting.  Not<br/>
unless they have someone else cast the SOW on them.  Cause The<br/>
Darkness line sure isnt enough.  We have fewer spells.  And are only<br/>
really really powerfull when it comes to undead.   That&#39;s IF you can:<br/>
1. Find the right Words <br/>
2 MAKE THE SPELLS.  <br/>
<br/>
Cant just go out and buy them.    No pet spells past 20 or 24 ... all<br/>
are Research.   I know a lvl 45 nec that only has 40% of his higher<br/>
lvl spells because He cant find the components to make his spells.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hated by some NPC&#39;s.  Try hated by NPC&#39;s in ALL cities.   Randomly<br/>
killed.  MOST vendors will not deal with you.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh and did you also forget that NECROMANCERS have the LOWEST hit<br/>
points in the game.   DUH.. didn&#39;t know that one huh?<br/>
<br/>
What did I miss?   Oh the ROOT Spell ? You&#39;re joking right.  Necro&#39;s<br/>
get Root at lvl 34.   And I have been told that root at that lvl is<br/>
totally pathetic.<br/>
<br/>
Shock of poison?   It&#39;s at lvl 24.   Does 145 .   At that lvl that is<br/>
not a lot.<br/>
<br/>
And your assumptions as to what the damage of our spell are is wayyy<br/>
off.  Even it the 3 DOT of death is not resisted (which is not common<br/>
even on greens and blues) they do NOT do 400 in a minute.  Not in 2<br/>
MINUTES.   Those DOT&#39;s take a LONG time to do all their damage.  And<br/>
when all 3 do hit the critters compleltly forget about your pet.   And<br/>
come after you.   Pets taunting  is pathetic.<br/>
<br/>
And Lets talk Armor and Weapons.   Oh wait.   Necro not only dont get<br/>
decent armor.  Are exclued from of MOST of the really nice magic<br/>
buffing Items.  Did you notice that STAFF OF THE ORACLE on the Dark<br/>
Side page.  Look closely... Necro&#39;s cant even use it.    Dagger of<br/>
Marnek ?   Only Necro only item I have seen.  <br/>
Dmg 3 attack 30.....  At least till you can get a Writhing Staff...<br/>
lets see they are running 500 plat on the rathe....     yea.. easy<br/>
there.. NOT.<br/>
<br/>
You think necro&#39;s have it so easy ... try to play one.   Watch how<br/>
much being hated increases prices....   being KOS&#39;s everywhere slows<br/>
you down...   When you have played one up to 16 or so .... then lets<br/>
see how much you would think they are overpowered...   till then...<br/>
<br/>
GET OVER IT ! ! ! <br/>

<br/>
Now, with all that said... does anybody else think that necros are<br/>
vastly<br/>
overpowered?  They do FAR more damage than any other class at all<br/>
levels,<br/>
they get pretty much every combat-utility spell that any other class<br/>
gets<br/>
(like roots, disempowers, debuffs, etc), AND get the ability to<br/>
summon pets<br/>
of higher level than any other class.<br/>
<br/>
Not to be a huge bitch or anything.  I was fine with that at first,<br/>
but<br/>
since EVERY recent patch has included further buffing or tuning of<br/>
the necro<br/>
class it just seems to be getting a little absurd to me.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody tell me what the drawback is for their class...  being hated<br/>
by<br/>
some NPCs?  After having played a troll for several months and being<br/>
KOS by<br/>
EVERY npc north of innothule.... the necros have it easy... like<br/>
super-easy.<br/>
Then they went and gimped the shamans and I just honestly can&#39;t<br/>
figure out<br/>
what is going on.  I&#39;m guessing I&#39;m not seeing the whole picture or<br/>
something.... because recent events just haven&#39;t made any sense to<br/>
this<br/>
stupid troll.<br/>

Heart Flutter also drops a monsters AC by 47 and his str by 17, hit<br/>
it with<br/>
the 1st lvl spell Siphon Str and that gives 10 more Str to you.   So<br/>
with<br/>
the 3 It is Slowed, Weakened, Has its Ac dropped a good bit you are<br/>
doing<br/>
about 400 points of damage in a min (The Dark Side has a nice listing<br/>
of the<br/>
spells and what they do per tick).<br/>
