&gt;  The Crude stein if from killing the Bouncers in the<br/>
&gt;Ferrott zone. Don&#39;t think you can get them any other<br/>
&gt;way. They are in the high 30s to 40th level range and<br/>
&gt;hit extremely hard. Over 100 points per swing, attack<br/>
&gt;fast and have a brutal kick too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Look for Bouncer Hurd and Bouncer Flerb, there may be<br/>
&gt;others, I am familiar with those two.<br/>

by doing the Noble Hunters and Nork&#39;s Severed Arm quests (both start in <br/>
Ogguk). Please note that both of these quests give random items for <br/>
completing them. The crude stein is just one of the random items given.</div>
