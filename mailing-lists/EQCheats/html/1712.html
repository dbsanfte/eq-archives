&gt; &gt; &gt; My necro is bound in the pot room<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Is it possible to bind oneself in Timorous Deep now ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well yeah, I actually posted about that a while back, I think.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Info about the Pot room...skip to the &quot;map&quot; of pots and description of guard<br/>
placements, if you already know the basics:<br/>
<br/>
In case anyone doesn&#39;t know, anyone who can bind has an alternative to paying<br/>
a druid/wizard or buying Planes of Power, to get around quickly.<br/>
<br/>
You can bind yourself in the teleport pot room in Timorous Deep, which is at<br/>
-12,000 +4,500. This room contains twelve pots, one for each of twelve major<br/>
cities on the planet. You click on (or run through) any one of them to be<br/>
teleported to that city.<br/>
<br/>
Bind yourself here, and whenever you want to go to another city you just gate<br/>
to this room, then pick another city. Also good for getting back quickly when<br/>
you die. You appear in the pot room and click on the city by where you were<br/>
killed.<br/>
<br/>
To get here the first time, you have to either swim a VERY long way, or have<br/>
lev on, the zone&#39;s mostly water. You cross near an island or two, careful for<br/>
killer &quot;raptors&quot; and such stuff. <br/>
<br/>
You will see four spires poking out of the water where the pot room is<br/>
(people usually call them pillars). You get between the four and swim<br/>
straight down, where you&#39;ll find a square trap door in the ocean floor. You<br/>
swim through it, take a couple hundred points in falling damage (not enough<br/>
to kill even my 8th level high elf enchanter, I probably didn&#39;t have buffs<br/>
on), and now you&#39;re standing in the pot room. Bind yourself immediately.<br/>
There may be a bug that says you&#39;re not bound, but if so just camp out and<br/>
back in, and you&#39;ll see your bind point has changed to this room.<br/>
<br/>
There is a super-rare dragon that spawns here who will kill even ubers, but<br/>
I&#39;ve only seen it once, ever (what I saw was my corpse, not the actual<br/>
dragon). I have gated to (or died and appeared in) the pot room literally<br/>
thousands of times, probably, and only been killed once when I left myself<br/>
standing there AFK. The undead guy from my previous post will warn you in<br/>
detail NOT to leave yourself there AFK, if you hail him.<br/>
<br/>
Once bound, you can click on any pot to teleport to that city. Actually, youc<br/>
an do it without binding, perhaps because you&#39;re a melee who was in Timorous<br/>
anyway and found it faster to run here and then pot to somewhere far away,<br/>
instead of taking a boat. But if you meant to bind, don&#39;t forget and click a<br/>
pot first...I did that with the fourth character I bound here, so I got to do<br/>
the whole run again.<br/>
<br/>
You usually appear within sight of the guards, so be invisible or otherwise<br/>
prepared if you are KoS. <br/>
<br/>
The pots are in a circle, and I will list them going clockwise from Freeport,<br/>
which is the only one that has a name on it. You may have to crouch really<br/>
close to read that name, too.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re in a circle, like a clock. Let&#39;s call Freeport midnight:<br/>
<br/>
12:00 Freeport    (looks like a pot, as most of them do, but says &quot;Freeport&quot;)<br/>
1:00  Cabilis     (taller pot with wings on it)<br/>
2:00  Kaladim<br/>
3:00  Ak&#39;Anon     (looks like a lavalamp, I describe weird ones here)<br/>
4:00  Rivervale   (looks like a torch on a long thin rod base)<br/>
5:00  Grobb       (looks like a campfire)<br/>
6:00  Oggok       (like most, a variation on the basic pot)<br/>
7:00  Erudin<br/>
8:00  Neriak<br/>
9:00  Kelethim<br/>
10:00  Felwithe<br/>
11:00  Halas      (looks like a cube with a bowl on it)<br/>
<br/>
Guards (for the KoS) and any other notes (I do not guarantee the accuracy,<br/>
though it mostly is correct):<br/>
<br/>
Freeport -- you appear close to the guards, but you usually have enough time<br/>
to jump off the dock without them aggroing on you, then you can swim to the<br/>
underground<br/>
<br/>
Cabilis -- You appear just inside East Cabilis (correct me if I&#39;m wrong, this<br/>
is from memory), /definitely/ out of guard aggro range, next to the zone to<br/>
Lake of Ill Omen (or was it Warslik&#39;s Woods)<br/>
<br/>
Kaladim -- Never used this one.<br/>
<br/>
Ak&#39;Anon -- Rarely go there, but I think you either have a moment to leap into<br/>
the zone to escape the guards, or they&#39;re just not in range. No promises,<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Rivervale -- If you&#39;re KoS, turn around and immediately run to the zone, you<br/>
appear just outside the tunnel to Misty Thicket. If you&#39;re quick, you<br/>
probably won&#39;t even get hit.<br/>
<br/>
Grobb -- You appear out of sight of the guards<br/>
<br/>
Oggok -- You appear out of sight of the guards in the tunnel to the exit<br/>
<br/>
Erudin -- If I recall correctly, my Dark Elf cleric was killed upon appearing<br/>
here last time, so either you appear in sight of the guards, or in the patrol<br/>
range of one.<br/>
<br/>
Neriak -- You appear out of sight of the guards, though people get chased to<br/>
the zone line here a lot, so one may be wandering by. You appear in the<br/>
commons, by the zone to the foreign quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Kelethim -- You appear out of sight of the /standing/ guards, just up from<br/>
the PoD lift (or was it the newbie lift), but in the path of a patrolling<br/>
guard, so there&#39;s a small but real chance you&#39;ll get attacked instantly.<br/>
<br/>
Felwithe -- I am pretty sure you&#39;re out of guard aggro range, but I typically<br/>
use Kelethim instead, so I may not remember well.<br/>
<br/>
Halas -- You&#39;re standing right by the guards on the dock. I have this theory<br/>
that my troll shaman could instantly start running, with BOTH Lev and SoW on<br/>
and make it to the zone alive...but my Dark Elf cleric definitely did not,<br/>
even when my troll shaman had cast SoW and Lev on her before she stepped<br/>
through the pot. Getting her corpse back was quite an experience.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and please understand that if you DO teleport in where you&#39;re KoS and get<br/>
killed, your corpse will probably end up lying near the feet of the guards<br/>
who hate you, so getting it back can be a pain.<br/>
