<div id="ygrps-yiv-534420978">AND, if this was a slip up or whatnot, clean it up and stay on the list. I&#39;m<br/>
all for people growing and developing. But, if this is how you actually feel<br/>
(your comment to Rebecca), then I would rather you not be on the list. I<br/>
really don&#39;t know what Rebecca said or did, but that&#39;s not the issue here. I<br/>
do NOT care to come back from a weekend, to sift through 120 emails to find<br/>
stuff like this. Not that it was hard or upsetting, was real easy to delete,<br/>
but it can offend some people, and it&#39;s just plain disrespectful.<br/>
<br/>
Clean it up, I&#39;d welcome you to stay and participate. <br/>

Hi Nick<br/>
As you have probably already realized, your original comments are completely<br/>
inappropriate for the list.  Furthermore, I want you to know that I find you<br/>
second comment (below), addressed to Rebecca to be completely inappropriate,<br/>
childish and unprofessional.<br/>
Without getting into your complete lack of respect for other individuals,<br/>
your disregard for appropriate way to address a lady, and your lack of<br/>
intellectual ingenuity in dealing with criticism, (not to mention your<br/>
apparent lack of maturity), I would like to suggest that you take your crude<br/>
language AND your lame attitude and remove yourself from this list.<br/>
This is NOT a forum for EQ complaints, and I certainly don&#39;t recall any<br/>
posts asking for your opinion on anything, much less you opinion on camping.<br/>
Grow up.<br/>
Get a job.<br/>
Learn to express yourself in a manner appropriate to your environment.<br/>
Sean<br/>
<br/>
