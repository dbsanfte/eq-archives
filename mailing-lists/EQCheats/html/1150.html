<div id="ygrps-yiv-803946902">Ok to save me from weeding through 1000 emails could someone please email me<br/>
directly the exact location of the Paw Container for the Paw of Opalla<br/>
quest...<br/>
I know it is in the Queynos Aqueducts and I know it is dropped by Vin<br/>
Moltor...what I don&#39;t know is which entrance to the aqueducts is he closer<br/>
to? The North Queynos or South Queynos.....I was down there yesterday and I<br/>
really don&#39;t feel like waltzing into the Necro Guild...so thank you very<br/>
much all :-)</div>
