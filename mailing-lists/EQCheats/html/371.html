 </span></blockquote>Regular werewolves (around 18-20) are found in West Commons, Kithicor, and<br/>
West Karana.  There&#39;s a named rare werewolf (around 30) in North Karana<br/>
that sometimes spawns near the werewolf hunting party.  And then there are<br/>
the high 20s (?) werewolves in Mistmoore castle.<br/>
