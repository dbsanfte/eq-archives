<div>It&#39;s kinda silly reading this list of complaints for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Having started in Mar. &#39;99, I&#39;ve been able to see the perspective of how 
incredibly easy players have it today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take into account.. back 
then...</div>
<div>Deaths cost 2x the amount of exp.</div>
<div>There was only the old world to explore and level in, so you had the 
choice of like..&nbsp; Spectres, or . .hmm, Spectres... to kill for exp at 
certain levels.</div>
<div>There were no high level Clerics etc...&nbsp; so if you wanted a res, 
too bad.&nbsp; Clarity?&nbsp; Too bad.&nbsp; Clarity 2?&nbsp; Didnt 
exist..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PoT9?&nbsp; Forget it.&nbsp; A port?&nbsp; Nope.. you&#39;re 
walking.</div>
<div>And equipment was like..&nbsp;&nbsp;omg, Flowing Black Robes at level 
50.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Nowadays, players have a seemingly endless supply of NPC&#39;s to kill, .. 
the exp penalty for dying has been halved...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equipment is 15 
times better or something ridiculous, and with the inception of the Bazaar, 
can be found and acquired in a matter of minutes for anyone who wants to walk 3 
minutes tops to the PoKnowledge book in their local town and port there. 
...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc... etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;if anything, make the game harder to advance instead of easier 
;x</div>
