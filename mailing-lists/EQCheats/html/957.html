<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051655129">All, <br/>
<br/>
It seems every time that someone posts a cheat that might be frowned<br/>
upon by the GM&#39;s, numerous people feel the need to chime in that it<br/>
might be frowned upon by the GM&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I know you all mean well, but this *IS* a cheat list, and it&#39;s a bit<br/>
tiring to get 5 emails about the dangers of doing &quot;X&quot; for every mail<br/>
that we get about &quot;X&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Might I suggest that the owner of this list put that disclaimer at the<br/>
bottom of the list or make it part of the &quot;Hello, welcome to EQ<br/>
cheats...&quot; subscription notice?<br/>
<br/>
Just one man&#39;s opinion.<br/>
