<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069503060">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I have not played in about a year and a half so this<br/>
info might be a bit dated.<br/>
<br/>
At level 30 or so ( I have gotten three characters to<br/>
this level, war, druid, Wizzy,)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First of all at this level and a warrior you should<br/>
really be in a group. That said here are a few spots I<br/>
liked<br/>
<br/>
Forest Giants in that zone next to the Lake of Ill<br/>
Omen, I forgoten the name of that zone even though I<br/>
have homestead rights there.  Basement of the Unrest,<br/>
you need a GOOD group. This might not be so hot. The<br/>
last time I was there the zone was filled with 16th<br/>
level char and there 50th level mains getting a<br/>
powerlevel.  Kobolds in the &quot;window room&quot; in that zone<br/>
with the Naggy (the red dragon).  Frogs in Lower Guk. <br/>
 I think 30th level is also a good time to try Velious<br/>
(sp?) you know the Ice zone with the wallrus and<br/>
bunnys and 40+ level giants.  That zone on the other<br/>
side of the Warrens might be 30th or so level. <br/>
Probably more fun for a Druid than a warrior.  There<br/>
is another zone in Kunark with those gyro goo things<br/>
too.  I know that discription sucks. It is in Kunark<br/>
and it is a dungeon.  Very hard to find it is small<br/>
cave entrance and garded by a fake pool of water.<br/>
<br/>
I think the 30&#39;s is one of the best levels in the game<br/>
for exploring and having fun. I have twinked my<br/>
Warrior just by going to the 50th level zones and<br/>
picking up nodrop stuff.  If your not dressed like a<br/>
twink lots of player will help you. Well it used to be<br/>
that way. IMHO the levels past 50 are too time<br/>
consumeing.  <br/>
