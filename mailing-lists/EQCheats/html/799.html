<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670304311">Hmmm, well since your daddy  is &quot;done&quot;  paying for your college it sounds<br/>
like an invite to me too.<br/>
Mail him again and say thanks.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Now for a cheat...<br/>
<br/>
In halas, theres a lady in the pit of despair, I cant recall her name right<br/>
now.<br/>
Talk to her about ice goblins. She&#39;ll tell you to get her 6 beads and bring<br/>
them back to her.<br/>
Well when I did this I was surprised, I got like 6 iron rations, they sell<br/>
for over 2<br/>
Gold apiece. The real shocker though was the fact that I got about half a<br/>
bubble of exp from it.<br/>
The best part of this was I noticed one of the vendors by the 3 tents was<br/>
selling those<br/>
Beads and cheap! Well 5 minutes & 3/4ths of a lvl later I finally bought her<br/>
out of the necklaces.<br/>
So whenever you&#39;re in halas, remember to just take a peek at these vendors<br/>
and see if they<br/>
Have beads. I was 4th lvl btw when I did this.<br/>

	LOL...<br/>
	Hey Lemac: I&#39;ve NEVER seen a High Elf in court!  :)<br/>
	As to this laughable (but not laudable) supposed lawsuit:<br/>
	Below is a copy of the email that Nick sent me, exactly as it<br/>
appeared to me<br/>
	(I&#39;ve included the ENTIRE mail, for those of you that enjoy a good<br/>
chuckle.<br/>
<br/>
	Please note in the second line of his email that he says that I can<br/>
email<br/>
	him when my &#39;daddy&#39; stops my college payments.  First of all, I<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
	believe that this &#39;Nick&#39; character has consulted a lawyer (at least<br/>
not a<br/>
	GOOD one).  Secondly, even if he DID consult a lawyer, I paid for my<br/>
own<br/>
	education, thank you, and I believe he has given me permission to<br/>
email him<br/>
	anytime I want to!<br/>
	This incident (that all started with Nick&#39;s irrelevant comments<br/>
about<br/>
	camping, and his subsequent flaming of Rebecca have gotten WAY out<br/>
of hand,<br/>
	and are taking up altogether too much of the bandwidth associated<br/>
with this<br/>
	email group.<br/>
	Chuckle a little if you want....I have  :)<br/>
	But, PLEASE, let&#39;s move on and talk about EQ!<br/>
	Sean Clark<br/>
	PS: I am FACULTY at the university I have my email at, not a student<br/>
:)<br/>
	Here&#39;s the message that nick sent me, in it&#39;s entirety:<br/>
<br/>
	Obviously I have a job or I would probably be a tweaker like you.<br/>
You say<br/>
	job like you have ever had one, when daddy stops your college<br/>
payments then<br/>
	you can email me and talk.  Until then this is your notice never to<br/>
email me<br/>
	again any further emails from you will require a 500 dollar proof<br/>
reading<br/>
	fee, under penalty of law of course.  Thank you very much and have a<br/>
nice<br/>
	day.<br/>
<br/>
	N.H.<br/>

	&gt; Hi Nick<br/>
	&gt; As you have probably already realized, your original comments are<br/>
	completely<br/>
	&gt; inappropriate for the list.  Furthermore, I want you to know that<br/>
I find<br/>
	you<br/>
	&gt; second comment (below), addressed to Rebecca to be completely<br/>
	inappropriate,<br/>
	&gt; childish and unprofessional.<br/>
	&gt; Without getting into your complete lack of respect for other<br/>
individuals,<br/>
	&gt; your disregard for appropriate way to address a lady, and your<br/>
lack of<br/>
	&gt; intellectual ingenuity in dealing with criticism, (not to mention<br/>
your<br/>
	&gt; apparent lack of maturity), I would like to suggest that you take<br/>
your<br/>
	crude<br/>
	&gt; language AND your lame attitude and remove yourself from this<br/>
list.<br/>
	&gt; This is NOT a forum for EQ complaints, and I certainly don&#39;t<br/>
recall any<br/>
	&gt; posts asking for your opinion on anything, much less you opinion<br/>
on<br/>
	camping.<br/>
	&gt; Grow up.<br/>
	&gt; Get a job.<br/>
	&gt; Learn to express yourself in a manner appropriate to your<br/>
environment.<br/>
	&gt; Sean<br/>
