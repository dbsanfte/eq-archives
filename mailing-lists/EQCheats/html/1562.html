: I&#39;m not sure Polar Bear cloaks are the way to go.  Karg Icebear is very<br/>
hard<br/>
: to find these days as so many people are killing him (not like the old<br/>
days<br/>
: when you could always find him wandering around).<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, tedious.... the PB Cloak is a very nice item, though, and is<br/>
ALL/ALL, so selling it is hardly a problem. The rarity of Karg serves to<br/>
make the prices even higher. I think that nowadays one could get 20 p per<br/>
cloak on Faydwer... if one were a shrewd trader, at least. :)<br/>

: Here is my newbie money raising secret.  Collect Batwings. Sell them in<br/>
: batches of 20.  Many higher lvl Wizards will pay 10pp or more for a batch<br/>
of<br/>
: 20 wings cause we don&#39;t want to bother hunting bats.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t work much anymore... Bat Wings are purchasable in unlimited<br/>
amounts in Kithicor and West Freeport (probably other zones as well, Ogguk<br/>
or Grobb almost ceratinly) for about 14 copper each. People are beginning to<br/>
know this. :) </span></blockquote></div>
