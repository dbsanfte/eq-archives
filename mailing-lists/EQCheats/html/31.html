<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541786376">personally i don&#39;t see the benefit of guilds.  it has always seemed like a<br/>
communist kind of thing :)<br/>
<br/>
just find yourself a good group of friends that you enjoy hanging out<br/>
with.  in a guild you dont have a choice in who you help, you are expected<br/>
to help any guild mate that needs it, which isn&#39;t always a good thing.<br/>
