<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219496733">Guard Training.....<br/>
<br/>
A fellow DE Necro was trying to reach level 50 by camping the FP guards on E.<br/>
Marr.<br/>
<br/>
We were all having a good time running guard after guard to him and his pets.<br/>
<br/>
He never complained (in fact he thanked us) , something about much easier to nab<br/>
one returning alone than trying to pull 1 from its post?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...Apparently a 3rd party interupted by sending a /petition<br/>
<br/>
I was informed that Training guards Or monster to kill someone was completely<br/>
against there policy..   A BANNABLE OFFENSE...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
now im hearing this may not be the case?<br/>
<br/>
does anyone know for sure...we had to stop even though he didnt mine the<br/>
trains....</div>
