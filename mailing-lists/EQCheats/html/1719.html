&gt;  I just though I would drop a not that I just pinged 14th last night <br/>
&gt; (I know some of you blast thru levels like a missle but I only play <br/>
&gt; about an hour or so a day). The highest level I have got to so far is <br/>
&gt; 15th as a Elf Pally then I got killed in the middle of a high level <br/>
&gt; Orc camp and was unable to recover my body (O&#39; well , I like Shamans <br/>

corpse, it would be easy to find someone who would. Hell, a 5th level Druid<br/>
or fourth level Enchanter could have retrieved it. You could even have MADE<br/>
an enchanter, gotten her to fourth level in about an hour, and invised her to<br/>
drag it out. You can drag your own corpses with alts if you consent them, of<br/>
course.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You should go play in Paludal Caverns by 14th level, it has a higher<br/>
experience bonus than anywhere else in the game at any level. You should be<br/>
able to level every couple of hours.<br/>
<br/>
I think you have cure disease, in which case you can go hunt Fiends.<br/>
Otherwise you should join a Bandit group, but be careful because you&#39;re<br/>
slightly low for that and can&#39;t take/deal the hits like a Troll shaman. The<br/>
Fiends don&#39;t drop decent loot, but the Bandits drop armor you can sell for<br/>
multiple platinum at the Bazaar. You can also get free Uber buffs if you hang<br/>
around the Nexus either asking Ubers or waiting for someone to offer them. <br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;ve figured out how to root and DoT your victims. That&#39;s the big<br/>
Shaman soloing technique. Root, Slow, DoT, then maybe DD if you have enough<br/>
mana. Be ready to re-root. If you get KEI in the Nexus, you can even root and<br/>
Direct Damage them to death, easily. At your level you can&#39;t cast fast enough<br/>
to use up your mana if you have KEI on. With my Troll shaman I also melee<br/>
them a bit each time (I solo yellows) just to keep my melee skills up, but<br/>
trolls are stronger and have regeneration built in. I can melee stuff my own<br/>
level without even casting on them, have always been able to.<br/>
