&lt;&lt; I didn&#39;t say it would be easy, you do have to work to get what you want if<br/>
 you really want to do it, it&#39;s part of the game, and you either accept it or<br/>
 don&#39;t, choice is yours, Yes, the ores are heavey, 15weight is a lot to carry<br/>
 around when you&#39;re not a typical ogre/troll/barbarian.  But , with a little<br/>
 ingenuity, one could think up possibly buying a few summoned bags off of a<br/>
 shaman  or doing the traveler&#39;s backback quest - both items which make<br/>
 anything in them weightless.  I have done the majority of all my<br/>
 blacksmithing and pottery by fetching the materials from the mudites, and it<br/>
 has been long tedious and at times down right irritating, but i&#39;ve worked<br/>
 hard for what i&#39;ve made :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually the travellers pack only reduces wqeight by 20%. Same with pierce&#39;s <br/>
pack or storing. The summoned bags you are correct on however.<br/>
