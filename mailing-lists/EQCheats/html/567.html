<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152194038">The Bracers of Erosilli are found on the same island that Gornit the HG is on... you can see it from the boat when passing... There is a camp with a halfling &#39;captain&#39;, dark elf, gnome magi, and wood elf around a fire and a couple tents right next to Gornit... the Halfling captain is the one that dropst he bracer... You might want a group just to be safe.. Gornit is pretty close to the camp, and every few minutes he will walk up towards the camp then back down into the water. So be alert...<br/>
Remember the bracers ARE lore+ACE-<br/>

Can anyone tell me what I need to do to get one of these?<br/>
I went to the Sisters Isle.. got on a canoe and sailed around for a bit...<br/>
didn&#39;t find anything that looked like pirates, especially ones I could<br/>
solo.. I&#39;m a 26th level rogue. Do I need a group for this?<br/>
