<div id="ygrps-yiv-407037759">Well, monks have mend too.. and paladins might be able to stun or root, but<br/>
they have no offensive spells aside from on undead, so if the monk is rooted<br/>
they can still attack as much as you.<br/>

&gt;I was talking about fighting MOB&#39;s when I said I only miss 1 out of 8<br/>
&gt;times. Monks stink because once your HPs are gone, you are toast.  You<br/>
&gt;forget that Paladins get root also.  We also have Stun which will freeze<br/>
&gt;your monk to allow us to heal up.  All of your quickness does not do you<br/>
&gt;any good if you can&#39;t move.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why is this going on this List anyway ?  I think we need to start a<br/>
&gt;EQbadmouth List for this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I never play PvP anyway because I think that it is stupid that someone<br/>
&gt;could just come up to you and kill you for no other reason.  PvP&#39;s are none<br/>
&gt;other than a bunch of greedy people that want to steal from other people.<br/>
&gt;That is why I am glad that the designers of this game were wise enough to<br/>
&gt;limit player killing.<br/>
