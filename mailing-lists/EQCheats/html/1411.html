<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613986319">First -<br/>
<br/>
I need to know some good ways to raise faction with Kelethin Merchants - I<br/>
know of giving slaves to keys and completing the Banded Orc Vest with<br/>
merchant Linadian, are there others? i have a quest that requires me to kill<br/>
something that gives bad faction with them, :)<br/>
<br/>
Second -<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of anything about a weapon called the &quot;Kilij&quot; ?  I am on<br/>
the quest, and i am looking for &#39;the plans for the kilij&#39;<br/>
That&#39;s what it&#39;s called, it&#39;s the plans on how the kilij is made, so i can<br/>
take them to the guy who can make them, Any info or anyone selling such an<br/>
item on Cazic Thule would be welcomed.<br/>
