Guy, if you don&#39;t want private messages, then:<br/>
<br/>
1) Put a SIGNATURE line at the bottom of the message stating you don&#39;t want them.<br/>
<br/>
2) Get off of any lists (like these) that show your email account!<br/>
<br/>
3) Have your email system only accept messages from certain email accounts (and dump all others)<br/>
<br/>
4) Have your email system BLOCK certain email accounts and auto-dump any messages from them (like the /ignore command in EQ)<br/>
<br/>
5) For all other stuff, get a seperate &#39;junk&#39; email account that automatically deletes any messages that come in!<br/>
<br/>
6) Sell your computer!<br/>
<br/>
The rules of law covering &#39;Spam&#39; types of Email (which you can warn the company and they must stop or be liable to damages) do NOT cover an individual sending you a PRIVATE (not sent to others) message which is NOT an advertisment...<br/>
<br/>
If someone is harrassing you via email, then you must contact their ISP and inform them you do not wish this person to &#39;harrass&#39; you with Email, and then file charges of harrassment against them with the local authorities (Police).  If it then continues, they can be cited or arrested.  If this happens (after police warnings) THEN you may take civil action against them.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, BTW, you might have just LOST your case because you decided to openly discuss (and possibly slander/liable) the case and the defendant (also giving out HIS private Email address) online!  Your lawyer (if you actually have one) should have told you all about this!!  Oh, and BTW, you can&#39;t use a lawyer in Small Claims court either...<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

  Well, I warned this person to stop emailing me.  As per my lawyers request I had warned him before not to email me or a proof reading fee would be exempted to his university/his parents.  He sent me an email this morning that was lengthy and I didn&#39;t even bother reading it.  Again (to the people of the list), do not send me private emails.  Mr. Clark is going to have to go to small claims court because of his actions. </span></blockquote></div>
