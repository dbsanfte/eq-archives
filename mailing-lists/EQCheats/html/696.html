<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301447549">This was posted on the pottery list.  The recipe for vials!!!<br/>
<br/>
OK, since people who announce they know something but are not telling annoy<br/>
me, I will send out the formula for everyone.  I made multiple vials and<br/>
will<br/>
list<br/>
my skill levels below:<br/>
<br/>
Vial<br/>
<br/>
Small Block of Clay<br/>
Any non-ruined pelt - I have succeeded with Black Wolf Skin,<br/>
                Puma Skin, Grizzley Skin, Low Qual Bear Pelt,<br/>
                Med Qual Cat Pelt, High Qual Cat Pelt<br/>
Vial Sketch<br/>
High Quality Firing Sheet<br/>
<br/>
Lined Vial<br/>
<br/>
Small Block of Clay<br/>
Any non-ruined pelt<br/>
Lined Vial sketch<br/>
High Quality Firing Sheet (?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With a skill of 120, I was successful on making 6 of 7 vial attempts.<br/>
My rate with lined vial attempts was 0 of 9, although I was received<br/>
the &quot;Lack Skill&quot; message and not the &quot;Does not Combine&quot; message.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
