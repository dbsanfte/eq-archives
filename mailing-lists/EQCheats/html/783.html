		Lemme get this straight, someone was sending him email that<br/>
he didn&#39;t want (spam?)<br/>
		and in an effort to stop it told the guy that he would<br/>
charge him a fee for reading<br/>
		his email. THEN doesn&#39;t read the email that was sent to him<br/>
and is planning on going<br/>
		to small claims court to get the fee? THEN he spams us about<br/>
it like we cared?<br/>
<br/>
		I agree with the others on the list, Nick is silly indeed.<br/>
Amazes me how people<br/>
		refuse to use something as simple as a killist and think<br/>
this method would be a<br/>
		better solution.<br/>
