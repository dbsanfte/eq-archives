<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069203083">As far as I know they only come off of a fisherman in Qeynos hills, he<br/>
spawns exactly 6 hours apart, and only has the earing 1 in 10 times.  The<br/>
fisherman is also 30+ level.  A friend of mine has camped the spot in The<br/>
Rathe for days, he has his clock set for 6 hours, jumps on kills it, logs<br/>
for 6 hours, repeats.<br/>
<br/>
He has only earned 1pair.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO this is pretty unfair (not just that my friend camps the site) but you<br/>
take a serious faction hit with Qeynos vendors and eventually guards for<br/>
killing this guy.  There should be some sort of quest for these, or at least<br/>
someway of killing a evil (or non aligned) character to get one.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of the monsters in the sewers should have them occasionally.<br/>

&gt; Does anyone know where the Fishbone earrings can be found, and what you<br/>
&gt; have to do in order to get them? Is it a quest item, or do you just have<br/>
&gt; to kill somebody?<br/>
