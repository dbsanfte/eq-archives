<div id="ygrps-yiv-500052413">Ok, since I&#39;ve seen a ton of prices variances, I&#39;m posting this.<br/>

Your CHA has a LOT to do with the pricing. There seems to be a cap at a CHA<br/>
of 117 for the Star Rubies at a little over 68pp each. The lower your<br/>
charisma, the higher the gems will cost. I&#39;d not like to think that anyone<br/>
will debate this, since I&#39;m fairly certain that it&#39;s applicable to everyone.</div>
