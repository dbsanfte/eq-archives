<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sure... many mobs carry the blocks of ore... hey, and they only weigh<br/>
&gt; 15lbs!!  Heck, you can carry 3-4 of them if you have good Strength!!  That<br/>
&gt; will save LOTS of money... yeah, right...  I would rather leave them<br/>
 </span></blockquote>behind<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and carry a FS or Bronze sword that weighs less and is worth MUCH more...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t say it would be easy, you do have to work to get what you want if<br/>
you really want to do it, it&#39;s part of the game, and you either accept it or<br/>
don&#39;t, choice is yours, Yes, the ores are heavey, 15weight is a lot to carry<br/>
around when you&#39;re not a typical ogre/troll/barbarian.  But , with a little<br/>
ingenuity, one could think up possibly buying a few summoned bags off of a<br/>
shaman  or doing the traveler&#39;s backback quest - both items which make<br/>
anything in them weightless.  I have done the majority of all my<br/>
blacksmithing and pottery by fetching the materials from the mudites, and it<br/>
has been long tedious and at times down right irritating, but i&#39;ve worked<br/>
hard for what i&#39;ve made :)<br/>
