I&#39;m not sure about the program thing (to minimise), and I haven&#39;t tried the <br/>
2 monitors...I may be able to but I doubt it (I don&#39;t think any of my <br/>
friends would loan me a moniter for a game).  Do you need a 2nd graphics <br/>
card for a 2nd moniter?  I&#39;m guessing you would need one in which case I <br/>
can&#39;t do it anyway b/c I have no open slots and my current card is bult into <br/>
the motherboard (darn Compaq).<br/>
<br/>
About that program...what does Alt-Tab do?  wouldn&#39;t it be just about the <br/>
same as a program sending the EQ window a command to minimise?  in that case <br/>
the result would be the same (logging out, computer locking up mostly, etc). <br/>
  But it might be different.<br/>
<br/>
anyone have ideas?<br/>
