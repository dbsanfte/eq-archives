<b>Subject:</b> possible big cheat for EQ.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-710614593">Ok, does anyone remember the days of Diablo where you&#39;d just Alt-Tab over to <br/>
your cheat program?<br/>
<br/>
well, I was on ICQ the other day and I got a msg, and not thinking I <br/>
alt-tab&#39;ed once, nothing, twice and I was out of EQ.<br/>
<br/>
Now, my mouse was fairly locked up, but the key board still worked, I could <br/>
alt-tab between other programs.  (only had ICQ open)  when the CTRL-ALT-DEL <br/>
window came up (I pushed em) I could again use my mouse while it was up.<br/>
<br/>
when I tried to go back into EQ it didn&#39;t work, but it still takes time to <br/>
camp out your character eh? :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking this may be able to allow some cheat programs, but probably <br/>
not, everything seems to me server side except for hot keys.<br/>
<br/>
But, I am not a good enough programmer to write something that might be able <br/>
to take advantage of this, nor do I know anyone who is.  If you are give <br/>
your input and see if anything works eh?  hehehe...if anyone does figure <br/>
something out they&#39;d be a god to EQ cheaters :)<br/>
<br/>
hope something comes of this,<br/>
Omeg</div>
