<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159296604">I agree, No Drop is about the crappiest thing in the game. It&#39;s not as bad now that no drop items<br/>
can be banked, but it is still frustrating as hell to get a really cool no drop item that&#39;s unusable<br/>
to you because of race/class restrictions. Especially if you know someone who would gladly buy it<br/>
from you if they were online when you got it.<br/>
<br/>
No Drop has it&#39;s place. I heard that it was implemented to prevent newbies from banking their newbie<br/>
food and duping it by dying a few times when the food respawns during the first 3 lvls of a<br/>
character. I also think that making some quest items No Drop is perfectly acceptable. (Like the<br/>
changes that were added to the Stein Quest.) Jboots being no drop I am not sure about. Seems to me<br/>
like that was a &quot;quick fix&quot; to reduce camping. Which obviously didn&#39;t work very well, just increased<br/>
the camping. So now it&#39;s been moved to a quest item. (Which I give Verant the benefit of the doubt<br/>
and assume that was the long term goal. Instead of finding that their first fix didn&#39;t work so now<br/>
they are gonna try another.)<br/>
<br/>
But making any and every cool item No Drop is pointless. Especially when Verant is making such a big<br/>
deal about a &quot;Player based Economy&quot;. If they want people to buy/sell/trade with each other then just<br/>
about EVERYTHING should be something you can sell to another player. At the very least let mechant&#39;s<br/>
buy No Drop items (Like those stupid burnt out lightstones from wisps, what the hell are they doing<br/>
as No DropP? a quest?) and sell them to other players.<br/>
<br/>
Just my No Drop rant :)<br/>

&gt; it&#39;s good that they making more armors for each class than just one for all.<br/>
&gt; and the worst thing they could&#39;ve done is making ruby no drop.  What&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; point of playing a game if everything is nodrop?!  THINK<br/>

&gt; gaga, wonders how some ppl thinks. </span></blockquote></div>
