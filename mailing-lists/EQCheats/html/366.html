&gt; <br/>
&gt; Time for a weapon upgrade for this 14th level Dwarven Paladin.<br/>
&gt; I prefer to use axes (at least until I git me hands on a Holy Sword :), so I<br/>
&gt; was lookin at the Brutechopper.  The stats look pretty reasonable (not quite<br/>
&gt; like a Shiny Hally, but I REALLY want to stick with the axes!).  I<br/>
&gt; understand it is a quest for evil characters, but how is the quest<br/>
&gt; initiated?  What is involved?  How much are these weapons selling for?  I<br/>
&gt; was figuring around 100 plat...a little under what the Hally is selling for<br/>
&gt; &#39;cause it lacks the damage of the Hally.<br/>
&gt; Also, I was thinkin about heading up to High Hold and was wondering what lvl<br/>
&gt; you would need to be to get a Tomahawk or a Halberd...any feedback??<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
