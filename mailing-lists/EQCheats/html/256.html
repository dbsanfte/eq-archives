<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201070313">I agree with the no PvP. This game is about grouping up together and having<br/>
fun.  I was grouped up with a Bar Rogue, High Elf Bard, Half Elf Paladin,<br/>
Dwarf Cleric, and myself in Unrest.  What a great place for a lev 15 player<br/>
to lev up !  I gained 2 bubbles in about 1and a half hours.  It was<br/>
constant battling.  I was told that there is a 10% exp. bonus with three<br/>
people grouped and a 25% exp. bonus for six people grouped.  Has anyone<br/>
else heard about this ?<br/>
