&gt; &gt;We went down in hopes of getting a BBC for our Pally last night.  We were<br/>
&gt; &gt;there for two hours or so, and never saw the SK.  We were told that there<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt;a &quot;spawn line&quot;, ie, don&#39;t cross it or the SK will not spawn.  Is this the<br/>
&gt; &gt;case?  If so, is that line at the end of the tunnel?  Or inside the room?<br/>
&gt; &gt;It was fairly frustrating.  Also, there was another group there camping<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt;the Robes, and I never saw that Theor..they...whatever guy that is<br/>
supposed<br/>
&gt; &gt;to drop the robes.  Does the same thing apply for him?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I spent about 3 days in Befallen and my parties got a total of 5 BBCs, 3<br/>
&gt; Thaum robes and 2 Gossamier robes, countless daggers of Marknek, and not a<br/>
&gt; single blackened wand (the item I was looking for).  There is NO spawn<br/>
line<br/>
&gt; or any kind of anti camp radius on ANY of the mobs in befallen.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; standing next to mobs when they spawned with the aforementioned items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Lastly..how often would you say the SK would normally spawn?  Every 1/2<br/>
&gt; &gt;hour?  Hour?  2 hours?  I probably will not return to Befallen, unless it<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt;with my Paladin with the objective of getting that BBC for him....so the<br/>
&gt; &gt;info would be appreciated.  That place is just swarming with DE&#39;s, and it<br/>
&gt; &gt;makes my dwarven skin crawl.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yeah, I hate the place too.  The spawn time in Befallen is about 20<br/>
&gt; minutes, and the SK spawns about 25% of the time.  About 33% of the time<br/>
&gt; that he spawns, he has a BBC.  So I guess if you are looking for a BBC,<br/>
&gt; plan on being there for 3-4 hours or so.  I hate camping, so I&#39;d just run<br/>
&gt; the entire 3rd floor - Thaum room,  Darkelf SK, and Troll SK.  We still<br/>
&gt; ended up at the start of the spawn cycle before the 20 minutes was up.  I<br/>
&gt; hate this dungeon.<br/>
