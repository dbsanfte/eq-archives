&gt; In fact it was Brian Hook, formerly of Quake 3 fame who ran that event.<br/>
The<br/>
&gt; thing that disgusts me is that that wizard told everyone that the Archon<br/>
&gt; dropped nothing.  It took everyone in the zone to deal with the mob&#39;s and<br/>
&gt; the Archon, and this guy not only has the gall to keep the loot all to<br/>
&gt; himself, but also to lie about what he got.  Gives all wizards a bad name,<br/>
&gt; oh, wait, they already have that, don&#39;t they.<br/>
<br/>
Ummm, what are you talking about?  Hast apparently DID tell people what<br/>
he got, since that was reported in the e-mail to which you replied.  And<br/>
while you might be magnaminous enough to share, most people actually<br/>
keep the stuff they earn.<br/>
<br/>
Though I imagine Hast probably shared the rubicite, since it&#39;s not<br/>
exactly stuff he can wear. =)<br/>

We cross our bridges when we come to them and burn them behind us,<br/>
with nothing to show for our progress but the memory of the smell<br/>
of smoke and the presumption that once our eyes watered.<br/>
