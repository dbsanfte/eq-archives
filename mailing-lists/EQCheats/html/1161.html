<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404673150">If there were a way to hack the files locally and give yourself items, alter<br/>
your bank box, or anything important like that, people would have already<br/>
hacked it (and then Verant would have most likely put in something to try to<br/>
fix it, so we would have heard about it).<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I see that&#39;s possible to hack would be the graphics files,<br/>
which HAVE to be local. No way they could send that much information over<br/>
the &#39;net, isn&#39;t possible. So, the graphics have to be stored locally. You<br/>
could write something to alter the packets as they come in to filter out<br/>
certain graphics messages (blind, rain, nighttime, spell effects, etc), or<br/>
you might be able to hack the graphics files themseleves and just take these<br/>
affects out.<br/>
<br/>
None of these bother me enough to want to wirte anything to filter packets<br/>
though.... *chuckle*<br/>

&gt;I think not. I play EQ a lot from different computers. Things I have to<br/>
&gt;set up on each new computer are hotkeys, friends list, and ignore list.<br/>
&gt;However, my character, equipment, bank balance, faction, current buffs,<br/>
&gt;and location remain the same.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That indicates to me that all of the second list are on the server, not<br/>
&gt;the individual computer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Quite possibly true. I don&#39;t know for sure either way - in my opinion I <br/>
agree with you. However, the main thing I&#39;m wondering at this point is - <br/>
what applications could hacking the files stored client side have? It has me<br/>
<br/>
on pins and needles. I hope that nothing major comes of this. I&#39;d hate like <br/>
hell to see my hours of work earning items, cash, etc go down the tubes. Yet<br/>
<br/>
on another aspect, I&#39;m intrigued. 8p<br/>
