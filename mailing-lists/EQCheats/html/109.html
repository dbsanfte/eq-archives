<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-338856442">I think the fastest way to level for anybody is to get<br/>
a good group together with tanks, Healers, and Mages,<br/>
Bards help alot to with their songs. After you have a<br/>
good group together go after red and yellow cons but<br/>
try to go after reds as much as possible. Ofcourse<br/>
make sure that your group of 5, 6 level characters<br/>
does not decided to take on a sand giant or griffawn.<br/>
But I tanked Scarabs and Orc centurians that are red<br/>
for me with a good group and leveled fast from 5 to 9.<br/>
About 10 hours playing time. Scarabs now con yellow so<br/>
I need to find another place to hunt soon. Oh and I<br/>
have been hunting in misty thicket.<br/>
