<div id="ygrps-yiv-712540317">Man O man.  I am taking you to small claims court for posting off topic<br/>
to this list.  I did not want to read this mail, and will forward you <br/>
a charge for having to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I even checked with my lawyer, AND his lawyer!<br/>

&gt; Well, I warned this person to stop emailing me.  As per my lawyers<br/>
&gt; request I had warned him before not to email me or a proof reading fee<br/>
&gt; would be exempted to his university/his parents.  He sent me an email<br/>
&gt; this morning that was lengthy and I didn&#39;t even bother reading it.<br/>
&gt; Again (to the people of the list), do not send me private emails.  Mr.<br/>
&gt; Clark is going to have to go to small claims court because of his<br/>
&gt; actions. </span></blockquote></div>
