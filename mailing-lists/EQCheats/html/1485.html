wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see that the new armor types look the exact same as rubi. It seems easier<br/>
than having to code new graphic info for each and every new set of armor. I mean, it&#39;s not like the<br/>
rubi graphic will get used as much as the armor that is replacing it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You have a point in that they seem to look before they leap. I actually think this is one example<br/>
where they actually came up with a plan instead of &quot;Just make it No Drop. That will solve the<br/>
problem.&quot; Making things no drop does not solve the problem, it just hides it for a while.</div>
