<div id="ygrps-yiv-654828520">Here is a quest i completed a while back:<br/>
Runner&#39;s ring<br/>
+2 AGI<br/>
+2 STA<br/>
I equiped this on my 15 Paladin and it gave him about an extra 30 AC<br/>
I could not start the quest because I am not a druid I suppose but I took my<br/>
lvl 19, at the time, ranger, Killed Nillipus, who took me down to 2 bubbles<br/>
of life. He spawns by the bridge in rivervale sometimes on one side of it<br/>
sometimes more toward the entrance to misty thicket. He spawns about every<br/>
10 minutes, real time,. I killed him a few times and looted plat, brownie<br/>
parts, gems, arrows, and best of all jumjum stalk. I gathered up 4 jumjum<br/>
stalk and took it to Reebo Leafsway at the druids guild by the farmers field<br/>
and gave them all at once to him. He gave me some plat and the runners ring.<br/>
I tried to give him 3 and he gave me a bunch of carrots. I gave my ring to<br/>
another character of mine and gave him 4 stalk and he gave me a bunch of<br/>
carrots once and a compass another time. So I am not sure if this a random<br/>
drop or actually something to count on. It has been told to me that if you<br/>
let Nillipuss run around before you attack him that is when he picks up the<br/>
stalk, supposedly swipes them from the field, but i have killed him right<br/>
after he spawned and he had one on him then also. Well its something to try<br/>
anyway. Good luck.<br/>
