 Training guards and what not on you and blocking the zones is ILLEGAL. I am <br/>
 a dark elf myself, and had a few friends of the &#39;good&#39;aligned races come <br/>
 into Neriak&#39;s foreign quarters killing the guards. A few dark elves and <br/>
 trolls decided to start training NPCs on them, and the trolls BLOCKED the <br/>
 zone. No one could leave unless they gated or evaced.<br/>
 <br/>
 A GM was called on the scene, and the players harrassing were given an <br/>
 official warning. My barbarian friend had died because of this zone <br/>
 blocking, causing him to lose his level.<br/>
 <br/>
 Roleplaying is one thing...causing people to die, and harrassing them is a <br/>
 totally different story.<br/>

This is rediculous.  I think that members of a particular race working to <br/>
protect thier home city guards is roleplaying in its highest form.  While <br/>
training guards that will then kill you may bend what would happen in <br/>
reality, I think it is far less relaistic to expect the denizens of a <br/>
particular city to stand idly by as thier beloved guards are being killed, <br/>
especially by members of an opposing race.  I think it adds a whole new lvl <br/>
of challenge to groups of high lvls who wish to conquer a city.  If those <br/>
high lvls cannot handle that challenge they should stick to the plenty of <br/>
other places where they can get exp and items and have fun.<br/>
<br/>
The Neriak storming event that Keptin talked about happened as he said on <br/>
Solusek Ro.  Solusek Ro is probably the worst roleplaying server that exists <br/>
and is almost exclusively a power gaming -hey dude- you suck - cool man! - <br/>
server.  I know, my 25 Wizard lives there.  It does not surprise me that <br/>
Keptin thus complains about what happened.<br/>
<br/>
I tell you what friends, try to attack my guards in Erudin I will stand with <br/>
them to the end!!<br/>
