<div id="ygrps-yiv-901637429">well maybe we don&#39;t like seeing your message and the 500 messages on the<br/>
same topic that i read yesterday or the day before.  So yes it may be<br/>
another request to trim the message...but i think it makes it easier for<br/>
everyone.  I think the only person it benefits is that guy on every list<br/>
who has an auto email answerer telling people he&#39;s not around.  Noone<br/>
likes him anyway. <br/>
<br/>
I hope to hell a cheat never comes out for this game. I personally would<br/>
be sickened and forced to move to a new game.  If you want to cheat go<br/>
play UO or Diablo or something else.  Leave this game for people who want<br/>
a challange.  The people who get pleasure only out of cheating, breaking<br/>
and hacking into things to mess them up have a serious problem in my book<br/>
and should be shot.  Im sick of playing a game and having a character run<br/>
by who cheated his way ahead of me cause he lack&#39;s the<br/>
talent/patience/skill to do it on his own.<br/>
<br/>
Die cheaters die!<br/>
