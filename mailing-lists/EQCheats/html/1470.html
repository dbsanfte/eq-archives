<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103353497">No its not on the live server yet. They said they&#39;ll probably make that in <br/>
this update. Wednsdays. Read the eqnews that downloads from the update for <br/>
wednsday and it will tell you what changed. ALSO. They are no longer having <br/>
rubicite dropped from the creatures that drop it currently. Everyone that has <br/>
rubicite will keep it but you will no longer be able to get it.</div>
