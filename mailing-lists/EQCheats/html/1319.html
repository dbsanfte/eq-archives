<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531132358">I have had in elsewhere, in befallen in fact.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I was feared, and checked, but there was no message in my<br/>
buffer. I then thought it would run out, and it didn&#39;t. I then camped<br/>
and when I logged back on, it was fine. Didn&#39;t /bug it though :(<br/>

Ok all you Nag killers<br/>
<br/>
We attempted Nagafen last night.<br/>
Giants were all a piece of cake, no deaths and no real problems.<br/>
<br/>
Heres the problem we encountered and I need to know If anyone else has<br/>
seen<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
3 of our casters, 2 clerics and 1 enchanter  lost the ability to cast<br/>
spells<br/>
during the melee.<br/>
I don&#39;t mean we were charmed or feared or roared.  I mean, all spell and<br/>
hotkey functions were gone, as if fear effect continued forever.<br/>
We were forced to camp to clear effect.<br/>
<br/>
We could have taken Nag easily if not for this.  Losing 2 out of 3<br/>
clerics<br/>
does sort of affect the outcome of battle.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a bitch nor am I inviting complaints<br/>
<br/>
I need to know if anyone else has encountered this.  We had a nice long<br/>
talk<br/>
with our Servers head GM and she wants to know as well so they can fix<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
