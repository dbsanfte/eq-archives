back then was FUN.&nbsp; It was a challenge.&nbsp; You felt a sense of 
accomplishment when you fought your way with 3 groups to the Efreeti room, or 
just made it safely to CT alone with your kos to everything in those zones 
character.</span></div>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1611843914663552616-10072003">I&#39;m not saying the game can&#39;t be fun now, or 
there&#39;s no accomplishment in whatever goals people set for themselves now days, 
the game certainly has changed.&nbsp; But if anything the game doesn&#39;t need to 
be made even easier than it already is.</span></div>

  <div>It&#39;s kinda silly reading this list of complaints for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Having started in Mar. &#39;99, I&#39;ve been able to see the perspective of how 
  incredibly easy players have it today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take into account.. 
  back then...</div>
  <div>Deaths cost 2x the amount of exp.</div>
  <div>There was only the old world to explore and level in, so you had the 
  choice of like..&nbsp; Spectres, or . .hmm, Spectres... to kill for exp at 
  certain levels.</div>
  <div>There were no high level Clerics etc...&nbsp; so if you wanted a res, too 
  bad.&nbsp; Clarity?&nbsp; Too bad.&nbsp; Clarity 2?&nbsp; Didnt 
  exist..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PoT9?&nbsp; Forget it.&nbsp; A port?&nbsp; 
  Nope.. you&#39;re walking.</div>
  <div>And equipment was like..&nbsp;&nbsp;omg, Flowing Black Robes at level 
  50.</div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div>Nowadays, players have a seemingly endless supply of NPC&#39;s to kill, .. 
  the exp penalty for dying has been halved...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equipment is 15 
  times better or something ridiculous, and with the inception of the Bazaar, 
  can be found and acquired in a matter of minutes for anyone who wants to walk 
  3 minutes tops to the PoKnowledge book in their local town and port there. 
  ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc... etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div>&nbsp;if anything, make the game harder to advance instead of easier
