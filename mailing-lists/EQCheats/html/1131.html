<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106995698">Fairly easily and seemingly possible idea for this why not try<br/>
networking....logging on but before actually playing the game while on news<br/>
screen try replacing the files. That way you crack the file replace the<br/>
actual file right before logging on and wen their servers go to pull the<br/>
info bingo they pull the cracked file. Real quick real easy and you have a<br/>
super pumped character. Just use another computer to place the file. There<br/>
may be the possibility of &quot;file in use&quot; error messages but highly unlikely<br/>
as you wouldn&#39;t be logged on as of that time.<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea</div>
