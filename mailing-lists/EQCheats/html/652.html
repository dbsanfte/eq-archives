<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616144744">The strength increase you mentioned is the skill called Alcohol Tolerance. It is a joke. It increases STR, while severely lowering INT. Its only good for warriors. It pretty much makes magic casting impossible, so its no good for bards, clerics, paladins, et al. If they made alcohol tolerance a viable skill, or make brews good for something else, and they severely increased npc prices for brews, brewing would once again be a viable trade skill.<br/>

I thought that drinking brew DID give you a boost in Strength!  (while lowering your INT I believe)... So it does kind of &#39;buff&#39; you up... and that is a good reason for the Warriors and fighters to build up an alcohol tollerance...<br/>
<br/>
Also, pie tins are needed for some quest, but they can already be purchased pretty cheaply from NPC&#39;s...<br/>
<br/>
I agree that most of those skills are useless, and blacksmithing is quickly becoming usless as well because of the amount of Bronze Armor (as well as all the banded that has already been made) that Verant has put into the game... It used to be infrequently dropped in Unrest and Permafrost, but now it is there all the time... So again, they (possibly unknowingly?) have made smithing a tougher skill to obtain...<br/>
