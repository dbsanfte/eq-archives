<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQCheats] ShowEQ Question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-787754125">First off let me say that *I* personally do not use<br/>
show EQ or cheat on my income taxes. But a little bird<br/>
told me that show eq does not let you see the tells<br/>
between players but it does tell you every thing else.<br/>
 Let me add that EQ is a game and you have no<br/>
constitutional rights inside the game. Heck, murder is<br/>
commited every minute in the game. I mean really what<br/>
did a Dervish do to you? Anything you type is public<br/>
property and can be seen by all of the EQ staff.  /em<br/>
wonders how much of a cybor slut Renee is.<br/>

&gt; a question about <br/>
&gt; it. Can the person who is using ShowEQ see other<br/>
&gt; players Text box? or <br/>
&gt; can they see other players personal messages? If<br/>
&gt; yes,... isn&#39;t that <br/>
&gt; illegal? That&#39;s invasion of privacy!<br/>
