<b>Subject:</b> Barbed Leggings in Befallen <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-846554989">Where does the (I believe female dark elf?) SK with the Barbed Leggings<br/>
spawn at in Befallen? I know it&#39;s level 3, but I don&#39;t know where. I Spent<br/>
ALOT of time in BF with another character, but never saw this SK (my groups<br/>
would never go looking for her though...somehting about &quot;She took out my<br/>
entire group of 20s...blah blah blah&quot;...well, I&#39;m a 29th Shaman now, and<br/>
ready to kick some booty to get this...heh). Also, spawn frequency (rate 20<br/>
minute like Ogre SK or 30min-20hours like Troll SK with BBC?), and drop<br/>
frequency if you know it.</div>
