<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874843644">I think this would be a good forum to ask for this.  Currently I am<br/>
developing a site for EQ dedicated strictly to the items, how to get them,<br/>
and buy/sell them (in game only of course).  I&#39;m not interested in the<br/>
standard Leather Arms, etc. There are plenty of sites out there that deal<br/>
with this. I *am* interested in anything out of the ordinary, where it came<br/>
from and the quest associated with it. This is a full-on spoiler option,<br/>
which I have no personal problem with, and if you&#39;re subscribed to this list<br/>
neither should you.<br/>
<br/>
All I ask is 3 quick things for submissions: a screen shot displaying the<br/>
item and the stats on it, a brief description of how you came across it, and<br/>
the quest information associated. The second two are optional since even I<br/>
hate campers, but they&#39;d really help those of us who go get the item, then<br/>
leave the spawn to the others to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
A. Would EQ players go to this site?<br/>
B. Is this a good idea?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone wishing to help out will get credit on the site for the submissions<br/>
(of course).<br/>
<br/>
E-mail any submissions to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:trajen@...">trajen@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks all!<br/>
