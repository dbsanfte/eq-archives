<b>Subject:</b> Pair of Bent spectacles/Lt. Guard <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656273661">This item is dropped by the Lt. in  N Karrana, and I have never seen this <br/>
guard.  Perhaps he is blind and can&#39;t find the guard towers.  If anyone has <br/>
any info as to where he is, I would greatly appreciate it.  Yes, there will <br/>
be a horrible faction hit, but that&#39;s the way it goes. Thanks all.</div>
