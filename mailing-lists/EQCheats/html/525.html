<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583437996">Now, with all that said... does anybody else think that necros are vastly<br/>
overpowered?  They do FAR more damage than any other class at all levels,<br/>
they get pretty much every combat-utility spell that any other class gets<br/>
(like roots, disempowers, debuffs, etc), AND get the ability to summon pets<br/>
of higher level than any other class.<br/>
<br/>
Not to be a huge bitch or anything.  I was fine with that at first, but<br/>
since EVERY recent patch has included further buffing or tuning of the necro<br/>
class it just seems to be getting a little absurd to me.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody tell me what the drawback is for their class...  being hated by<br/>
some NPCs?  After having played a troll for several months and being KOS by<br/>
EVERY npc north of innothule.... the necros have it easy... like super-easy.<br/>
Then they went and gimped the shamans and I just honestly can&#39;t figure out<br/>
what is going on.  I&#39;m guessing I&#39;m not seeing the whole picture or<br/>
something.... because recent events just haven&#39;t made any sense to this<br/>
stupid troll.<br/>

Heart Flutter also drops a monsters AC by 47 and his str by 17, hit it with<br/>
the 1st lvl spell Siphon Str and that gives 10 more Str to you.   So with<br/>
the 3 It is Slowed, Weakened, Has its Ac dropped a good bit you are doing<br/>
about 400 points of damage in a min (The Dark Side has a nice listing of the<br/>
spells and what they do per tick).</div>
