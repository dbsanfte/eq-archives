<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133869979">I guess you just proved our point - you will never get jboots, rubi & stuff<br/>
NOT because you suck at playing or you have a lousy character but because<br/>
you just don&#39;t have the TIME for camping.  Now thats just plain wrong.  We<br/>
should be able to get stuff if we have good skills & high level characters<br/>
not because we are willing to sit in a specific area for over 20 hrs. to get<br/>
something really nice.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re happy not getting any of those items that makes the game better -<br/>
well good for you but I for one, am NOT.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know but for some of us - I know some of us in my guild feel that<br/>
way - that getting all this hot stuff is a sign of wealth, power,<br/>
achievement.  Don&#39;t forget this is a role playing game - some of us take our<br/>
characters seriously & our guilds too.  Each of us have different goals in<br/>
this game, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
But, If I can&#39;t get a BIB or whatever because I can&#39;t camp it for 20 hrs. or<br/>
whatever - that is totally wrong - I shouldn&#39;t be able to get that BIB<br/>
because Im a lousy player or because my character is not high enough to kill<br/>
it or something - now that I can live with it  But when you&#39;re like level 40<br/>
& you could kill that spawn in your sleep & get that item easily - since<br/>
you&#39;ve worked hard to get to that level - some rewards should come with<br/>
being higher level  - but you&#39;re 40 & you have no rubi, special weapons or<br/>
item because you don&#39;t have time or patience to camp but you will see a 15<br/>
level characters with all those - NOW that is DARN  WRONG !!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Well Im happy you&#39;re having fun.  Oh! by the way I played UO & I was<br/>
bitching & whining there too :o)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Im 31 ranger & still dont&#39; have rubi, PGT or BIBS or whatever - like<br/>
you camping 20 or 30 hrs. straight is not plausible for me either - has if<br/>
that was not enough - then you get casters who kill your monsters.  Im a<br/>
very good player, have a good character - I should be able to get those<br/>
things but with the way the game is design - I guess only people who don&#39;t<br/>
work or kids especially if they are casters - can get ALL the good stuff.<br/>
Yeah you&#39;re right no big deal.. Who cares how strong my character gets with<br/>
time - I&#39;ll still not be able to get those things by myself, yeah no big<br/>
deal<br/>
<br/>

&gt;I work 40 hours a week, have my own apartment, my own car, loan, bills, I<br/>
&gt;go to night school aswell and I play maybe 2-3 hours a night....so about<br/>
&gt;15 hours a week...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That won&#39;t get me a pait of JBoots, or BIBS, or BIC...or any rubicite or<br/>
&gt;anything....but you know what I do....I just enjoy the game.  So WHAT if<br/>
&gt;you can&#39;t have an item you want.  Tough shit....really people....sure the<br/>
&gt;item may be cool....but it&#39;s not the end all and be all of your<br/>
&gt;character.....please.....quite bitching about camping.  I don&#39;t camp,<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t camp....and don&#39;t care if others do.  If they want to stay up 18<br/>
&gt;straight hours....then let them....this is a game after all....there are<br/>
&gt;other things going on in the world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As far as items not being on a MoB all the time.  Well...that would make<br/>
&gt;SoW from a shaman or druid...not very special....that would make that<br/>
&gt;special weapon not so special anymore.  That would make the 10-40 hour<br/>
&gt;wait to get the PGT that much less special.  If you want to power through<br/>
&gt;the game...get all the best weapons and armor easily and not have to work<br/>
&gt;at all to get em....then go play UO.  I don&#39;t want to see everyone running<br/>
&gt;around with JBoots...wielding PGT&#39;s and Darkewood shields....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ~S<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;p.s.  power leveling, stupidity and camping will thin out rather<br/>
&gt;soon....seeing as highschool/college are starting rather soon.....relax<br/>
&gt;people....plenty of items in the game that we know of....and plenty more<br/>
&gt;that we don&#39;t know about.<br/>
