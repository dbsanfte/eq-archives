<div id="ygrps-yiv-649638605">Between lvl 20 and 30 as a wizard my main &quot;kiting grounds&quot; were around tha Aviak village in South Karana.. that is absolutly a kiters heaven... YES wizards CAN kite!!! There are on average 10 to 15 plus druid and/or shamans in the area at any given time. And it is quite easy to have a constant sow...  Playing there was amazingly great.. Even when there were 40 plus ppl in the zone i didnt have much trouble gaining xp fast. And the loot is great. When high enough to kill avocets, the hardest aviaks there... you get great loot, they sometimes drop black pearls worth 50 plus pp to other players. and other assorted jewels that sell for 10 to 15 pp at a npc. And the zone rathe zone is near incase of trouble. There is even an aviak merchant that will sell to some ppl. I know it wont sell to gnomes.. dont know what other races it dislikes though. And best of all, aviaks have NO FACTION hits! And for those new to kiting, dont be afraid to try to kite a yellow or red... If you smack it and it turns out it resists to much just hit the zone, and you&#39;ll know from then on... If not, then rack in the xp!<br/>

&gt;Shaman&#39;s are the best kiters right?  B/c they get SoW at 9th, and Druids <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t get it till 14th...or are the Druid DOTs that much better?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;hmmm...maybe I will stick with the shaman :).<br/>
