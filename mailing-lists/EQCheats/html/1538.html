<b>Subject:</b> Incomplete/Wrong information (RE: Dark Reaver) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441121311">I believe he was thinking the Reaver of the Dead.  Dark Reaver is dropped by the<br/>
Cav, Reaver of the Dead is a quest (I think SK and Necro only).<br/>
<br/>
The fact that he didn&#39;t know, got confused or anything else doesn&#39;t make him a<br/>
retard.  I&#39;m getting upset that people keep flaming others to boost their own<br/>
ego.  It&#39;s not like most of us haven&#39;t posted incorrect or incomplete<br/>
information before.</div>
