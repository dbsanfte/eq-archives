<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665369007"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Ok, so do they drop skin? How do you end up getting lupine armor? I was<br/>
&gt;assuming they&#39;d drop a pelt or skin and you could take it to certain<br/>
&gt;vendors, like Karg (heck of a walk though). If so, how expensive is it to<br/>
&gt;have him make it? Heard the claws were 75pp?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Werewolf either drops Lupine Armbands (don&#39;t need to do anything, they just<br/>
work), Pelt (Take it to Karg with 100pp and you get a lupine cloak), or<br/>
claws (Take it to Karg with 75pp and you get lupine gauntlets), or nothing<br/>
at all (yuck).  The named werewolf drops a lupine tunic.<br/>
