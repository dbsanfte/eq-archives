 </span></blockquote>This is my thoughts exactly.  One other thought, the world needs to expand.<br/>
For instance, there is befallen, an excellent dungeon for level 9or10-20+.<br/>
It contains some unique items, the most notable one being the BBC.  In my<br/>
experience, it takes several hours for the SK to spawn at times, or atleast<br/>
45 mins to an hour.  Not very often does it carry the BBC.  Me and my<br/>
friends (16-20) can take this shadowknight and everything that comes with<br/>
it.  However, all that has to happen is for a high level wiz to sit there,<br/>
wait for the sk to spawn with sword in hand...hell, last night a 20<br/>
something CLERIC stole it from us..::Sigh::<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t insult my intelligence.  If I, or my group, is tough enough to take<br/>
monster x, which carries z, let the z be there, so we can leave.<br/>
