<div id="ygrps-yiv-475886665">Actually Gather shadows works too but that is a self only and is your own <br/>
fault. I don&#39;t think it is clever since you can just walk up on some one <br/>
and do it. One SOB on Fen Ro does it a lot any time he sees some one with a <br/>
pet he Invisi&#39;s them, he of course waits till they are in a fight.  He is <br/>
also the type of guy who casts see Invisible on guards so they will kill <br/>
and dark characters using the spell.<br/>

<br/>
Bah that is no exploit. In order for someone to bind you, two conditions<br/>
must be met. First and foremost, they have to be in your party. Being in<br/>
your party means you trust them (or that you are a frickin idiot to join<br/>
their party without knowing them) and give consent. The second condition<br/>
is that a spellcaster can only bind people in city areas (Highhold Pass<br/>
is considered a city however).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you have a pet and someone makes you invisible, the pet goes away.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This works on all classes cept Necromancers, which you have to use<br/>
Invisible to Undead on. Most consider it an exploit, I think it&#39;s just<br/>
damn clever.<br/>
