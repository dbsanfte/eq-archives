&gt; Just out of curiosity, can someone see what a pair<br/>
&gt; of crafted gauntlets <br/>
&gt; sells for to a merchant? (just be careful u dont<br/>
&gt; actualy sell them!) I was <br/>
&gt; in Felwithe (on povar) the other day and found that<br/>
&gt; someone had sold a pair <br/>
&gt; to a merchant (the merchant wanted about 3200pp) I<br/>
&gt; know how merchants work <br/>
&gt; and I figure that he might have goten 50-100pp.<br/>
&gt; There was also some other <br/>
&gt; items that i was amazed that anyone would sell but i<br/>
&gt; forget what they were <br/>
&gt; (i think a BIBS was in there)<br/>
