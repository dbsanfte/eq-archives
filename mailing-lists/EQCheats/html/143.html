 Does anyone have these stats?  I have been looking for these items, but it <br/>
seems that no one makes them!  I would love to see the stats and determine if <br/>
my search is worth while.  I would be willing to discard my quite common <br/>
banded armor in favor of this if the AC were not too much lower, just for the <br/>
sake of RP&#39;ing...<br/>

	Studded is handmade armor and actually not to commonly used from what <br/>
I&#39;ve asked people. Reinforced can normally be found on Druids in the midlevel <br/>
ranges before they get strong or wealthy enough to get better armor. Ask a <br/>
few Druids in the mid teens what they are using and the stats if they could <br/>
as they are restricted to wearing no metal armor.</div>
