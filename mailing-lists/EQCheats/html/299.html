<div id="ygrps-yiv-251456487">We also have Stun which will freeze<br/>
your monk to allow us to heal up. <br/>
<br/>
Just a side note about that.. stun lasts for 3 maybe 4 sec.. a tick is about 5 seconds.. and on average you heal 2 hp per tick, i think its 3 when sitting or somthing? I dont play a melee class so i dont really pay attention to that, but i know thats close... Anyway you do the math...<br/>
