<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532362227">Well, I heard he (Borxx) spawns in the King&#39;s Room. I&#39;ll be going with<br/>
(atleast) myself (32 Shaman) plus a druid friend (29 Druid), and will nuke<br/>
his ass off when he spawns if possible. That&#39;s assuming someone is camping<br/>
the kings room.... If not, well...I&#39;ll have to bring some friends. Might<br/>
have to pull a higher level friend or two....hrm.... Camping the King&#39;s room<br/>
could be fun though for a higher level group.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone camped this room before? Know what kind of group it would take to<br/>
camp sucessfully and control it? right now, my group has been camping the<br/>
King&#39;s room in Perma and controling it well (&#39;cept when the pull goes bad<br/>
for the higher levelers and 3-5 Ice Giants come charging into the<br/>
room.....ouch....*chuckle*). <br/>

  Borxx spawns in the King room down below. I don&#39;t<br/>
know what his spawn rate is but I have seen him in<br/>
there both times I went to Runnyeye. I went there with<br/>
a level 32 Paladin, Level 33 Cleric and myself at<br/>
level 26 and we all barely lived. Make sure to have a <br/>
strong and/or full group. <br/>

&gt; Also gonna need to find Borxx, since he drops one of<br/>
&gt; the three peices I<br/>
&gt; hear. Where does he spawn, and how often?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks again for everyone&#39;s assistance in the<br/>
&gt; crafted quests!!<br/>
