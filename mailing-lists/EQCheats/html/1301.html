<div id="ygrps-yiv-432813756">This is where SHE spawns, =), but she doesn&#39;t really stay there.  She jumped<br/>
my ranger when he was level 12 south of BB and killed me.  I&#39;m interested to<br/>
know if there are any faction hits when she&#39;s killed, as I&#39;d like to take<br/>
her out with my necro.  I&#39;ve only seen her at night.<br/>

&gt;   He is in the mini graveyard between the Surefall and<br/>
&gt; Blackburrow entrances. Not sure of his spawn rate but<br/>
&gt; Varsoon is an alternate necro that spawns there.<br/>
