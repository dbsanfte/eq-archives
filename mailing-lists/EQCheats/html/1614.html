<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428161172">I quit a level 29 wizard to start a rogue back in July.  Never missed the <br/>
wizard, not nearly as fun as the rogue.  Wizards just nuke and med... Kinda <br/>
boring IMO, but, hey, that&#39;s what a wizard is.  Playing a rogue in combat <br/>
is more interactive than any other character.  You are constantly moving <br/>
around trying to backstab the mob, its quite fun.<br/>

&gt;Dont like an aspect of a class?  Dont play it.<br/>
