<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739850771">I want to duel wield later on. But at early levels, should I get a 2 handed <br/>
weapon? Or would that just be wasting time? As a barbarian I do not have that <br/>
high of int so it would be hard to learn both. But the damage for a good 2 <br/>
handed weapon is great. So at lower levels would it be bad or good to use 2 <br/>
handed?</div>
