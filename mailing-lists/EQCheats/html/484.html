That should do it<br/>
<br/>
Your character can only have a 15 conditions affecting him or her at one<br/>
time.  If you are going into a battle with something that has a really<br/>
nasty condition (like when fighting necros or crits that charm) Get a<br/>
Shaman load a bunch of buffs on you.  Then you will not be bothered by<br/>
the harmful stuff.  You can try this yourself.  I am a lvl 24 Shaman so<br/>
I cast all my buffs and filled all the slots up(5 stat buffs, 5<br/>
resistance buffs, 2 sight buffs, my ac/hp buff, my ac only buff and SoW)<br/>
Then I cast Envenomed Breath on myself.  I didn&#39;t get the usual resist<br/>
message, but I didn&#39;t take damage and I didn&#39;t get the poison icon.</div>
