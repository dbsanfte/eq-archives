The game is only what you make of it, so if you think its 1/10th of UO<br/>
Then go back there or like you said play heroes. I can&#39;t stress the fact<br/>
That you get out only what you put in to the game. I have nights where<br/>
I&#39;ll do nothing but try to map, I guess that makes me lame since I&#39;m not<br/>
Leveling while I&#39;m doing it though huh? If someone is not enjoying the <br/>
Game then try to find a different circle of friends, they may be the cause.<br/>
Or try going to a different area. sorry for the rant all but this list has<br/>
somehow<br/>
Gone from cheats to a bitch list and I know I&#39;m not helping here but anywho.<br/>
God forbid anyone have to group...<br/>

	  I am not really in a great hurry, but I like to see<br/>
	my character advance. The RP aspects of this game are<br/>
	about 1/10th of UO&#39;s even though that game was riddled<br/>
	with Player Killers, bugs and exploits. I enjoy the<br/>
	game, but I feel after playing similar game types that<br/>
	this game corrals you more into the powergamer role. <br/>
<br/>
	I get into the mindset that I can play this game for a<br/>
	few hours and be about the same as I started or I can<br/>
	play something like Heroes of Might and Magic III and<br/>
	go through a few scenarios. <br/>
<br/>
	I will more likely plan to leave due to slow leveling<br/>
	than I would if I would see constant improvements in<br/>
	my character. <br/>
<br/>
	Even level 50s still have to go in two full groups to<br/>
	take on the tougher stuff like the dragons. <br/>

	&gt; I used to play meridian 59. I loved this game but<br/>
	&gt; people got burned out on<br/>
	&gt; it becuase you could build too fast and then got<br/>
	&gt; bored. Then people went<br/>
	&gt; around and PKed each other. It turned a wonderful<br/>
	&gt; online community into a<br/>
	&gt; garbage dump. What is your great hurry? You planning<br/>
	&gt; on leaving soon? As<br/>
	&gt; long as you are having fun and meeting new people<br/>
	&gt; and playing a game you<br/>
	&gt; like what difference does it make what level you are<br/>
	&gt; or how fast you get<br/>
	&gt; there. These games are ment to be played for years<br/>
	&gt; not weeks. I am<br/>
	&gt; surprised that people have already been able to max<br/>
	&gt; out. Now what do they<br/>
	&gt; have to do? Ok they can go anywhere and kill almost<br/>
	&gt; anything but how long<br/>
	&gt; before they get bored and move on? The game has only<br/>
	&gt; been out a few months.<br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; Just my 2 cents<br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; Feather Dreamwalker of Rathe<br/>
	&gt; &gt;<br/>
	&gt; &gt;I agree that level gaining is quite slow. 8-10<br/>
	&gt; hours<br/>
	&gt; &gt;for a level is a bit much. I can&#39;t imagine the high<br/>
	&gt; &gt;30s and above. <br/>
