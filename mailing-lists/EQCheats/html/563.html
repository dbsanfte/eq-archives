<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017749268">I actually haven&#39;t done any of those trade skills<br/>
myself, I feel that it is terribly wrong to kill them.<br/>
Maybe a lowering of profit perhaps. Some people spent<br/>
a bunch of money on failures to bring their skill up<br/>
to master to make money, now they aren&#39;t going to make<br/>
any. Sounds like what they did to fletching, raised<br/>
skill check by 600%. People with 190+ fletching were<br/>
instant gods of bowmaking. It would cost 1000s of<br/>
platinum to get there now.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry guys....<br/>
&gt; I have to side with Verant on Nerfing the<br/>
&gt; Pottery/Brewing type skills.<br/>
&gt; If you guys want to sit around doing these<br/>
&gt; monotonous, boring vendor-type<br/>
&gt; skills, than I guess that is your prerogative...BUT<br/>
&gt; I sure don&#39;t see where<br/>
&gt; you guys should be making 8-10 times the profit in<br/>
&gt; an hour that a person can<br/>
&gt; make out fighting monsters.<br/>
&gt; Agreed, they seem to be going a little overboard<br/>
&gt; with there &#39;corrections&#39;.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think it should be impossible for you to<br/>
&gt; make money selling made<br/>
&gt; items to NPCs, but the amount of money that you make<br/>
&gt; should be very<br/>
&gt; comparable to what I can make out there gathering<br/>
&gt; loot off of MOBs.  My<br/>
&gt; impression (please feel free to correct me if I am<br/>
&gt; wrong!) is that you guys<br/>
&gt; are the same group of people that made hundreds of<br/>
&gt; millions of TONS of<br/>
&gt; surplus Tailoring-made items in UO - you chose to<br/>
&gt; spend time working up your<br/>
&gt; Tailor so you could provide your mage with enough<br/>
&gt; money to buy reagents.<br/>
&gt; True?<br/>
&gt; The point I&#39;m trying to make is that you guys were<br/>
&gt; taking advantage of the<br/>
&gt; system...using in imbalance in the pricing structure<br/>
&gt; to make a LOT more cash<br/>
&gt; than you should have been able to make by using<br/>
&gt; trade skills.  Be happy that<br/>
&gt; you got to take advantage of the system as long as<br/>
&gt; you did.  But PLEASE<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t whine when they try to balance things out...it<br/>
&gt; trivializes the real<br/>
&gt; issues around game balance.<br/>
&gt; Thanks for your time.<br/>
&gt; Flame away  :-)<br/>

&gt;  Now you can try to sell all those fine pottery<br/>
&gt; Wares<br/>
&gt; to the Players! <br/>

&gt; Belgarth auctions Large Bowl only 2 Plat! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This game is sucking worse every day. It has the<br/>
&gt; serious UO syndrome of sucking all the fun and<br/>
&gt; enjoyment out of the game.<br/>
