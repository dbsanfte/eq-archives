<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-503678449">Look at it from a Smith&#39;s point of view... It costs quite a bit (mostly<br/>
time) to make both studs and boning (for reinforced), and it&#39;s much harder<br/>
to recoupe the money for them then it is for banded (remember those<br/>
failures?)  Studs usually have to go for 1p each just to break even (less<br/>
for higher level smiths, but they don&#39;t want to waste the time).  So, if<br/>
something takes 3 studs and leather, it&#39;s hardly worth it.  Try to find a<br/>
smith that will make you some if you want some.<br/>
