<div id="ygrps-yiv-260244740">Just want to warn you about doing theese stunts. You can do the same thing to the spectres in ferrott. Get em stuck and cast through the wall. But I know two people in my guild that have been warned by GM&#39;s not to exploit this bug or they will take action. Anyway, you run in to the cave with the spectre/spectres after you and just before the room with the entrance to plane of fear the spectres will get stuck in the wall and you can cast through it.<br/>
<br/>
(Agrees fully with you. Don&#39;t wanna read about babys trying to sue each other either)<br/>

&gt; At the Entrance to Nanjena you can pull a Rock Dervish.  If you get a good<br/>
&gt; lead and run around the corner almost zoning into nanjena you can still cast<br/>
&gt; at the Dervish.  The mob for some reason climbs the side of the zone and<br/>
&gt; never goes into the tunnel to Nanjena.  You can then kill the mob without<br/>
&gt; getting hit yourself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The same thing with cyclops in Mt Rathe.  You can pull them.  Just to the<br/>
&gt; North of the entrance from Lk Rathe is a mountain range.  If you root or<br/>
&gt; snare the cy to slow his movement you can run around the mountain range and<br/>
&gt; cast on him from the other side.  The cyclops tries to get to you but<br/>
&gt; instead goes way up into the air and never touches you.  Flying Cy is pretty<br/>
&gt; funny too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anybody else found spots like these? </span></blockquote></div>
