a program called showEQ  it displayed lots of mob/zone info and gave you an <br/>
overhead view of the zone and a list of items on each mob...i have never <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually I found it about 10 minutes after I sent the mail (isn&#39;t that <br/>
always the way?)  Just FYI for the rest of you.. in HackersQuest&#39;s FAQ they <br/>
give you directions on how to modify the tutorial, and a link to a hex <br/>
editor that you need to do it.  Or, if you want to do it the easy way, they <br/>
also have a link for a program that does it all for you.  I suggest copying <br/>
the tutorial and renaming it so you can keep the original if you mess it up <br/>
somehow, tho if you&#39;re paying attention it really isn&#39;t tough to do.  Here&#39;s <br/>
the link:<br/>
