<b>Subject:</b> reason for that email <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800380776">I&#39;m sorry if that email bothered any of you, but I did it because a person<br/>
on this list (the one named in that email) decided to pick up my email<br/>
address and spam me with long emails over and over.  It was a warning to<br/>
please not take my email address from this list and spam me.</div>
