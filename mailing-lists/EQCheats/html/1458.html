Subject: RE: Gnoll Slayer Sword<br/>
<br/>
Aaaaahhhhh...never noticed...alhtough I haven&#39;t fought reavers since like<br/>
18th level, and i&#39;m 34 now. Thanks for the info...I wonder if the Skull of<br/>
J&#39;hen Tra is that this guy is lookin for? Doubt it, but it&#39;s the only item<br/>
of worth I&#39;ve ever gotten off these gnolls. A book and an eye...any clues on<br/>
this? There any named white gnolls out there in EK or Lake Rathe?<br/>
<br/>
about named gnoll :<br/>
<br/>
last night i was hunting at the gnoll reaver and undead reaver spot <br/>
and i have see a rare spawn a gnoll named splitclaw (no sure of the <br/>
exact name)  it cons red to me at lvl 17. he also has summoned a <br/>
pet (a skeleton ) wich cons white to me.<br/>
<br/>
They killed me helped with two reaver :(<br/>
<br/>
i am really wandering what can we loot on him :)<br/>
<br/>
Sure it s a rare spawn because i use to camp there.<br/>
<br/>
that s my 2 cents.<br/>
