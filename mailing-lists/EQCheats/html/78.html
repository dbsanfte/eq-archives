<div id="ygrps-yiv-200912351">Hmmmm, thanks for the info. I think it might be hard because I am in Neriak <br/>
with my smith. I do not think there are any armor molds there, skewers are <br/>
not there either. I may just resort to making a new character in Freeport <br/>
area to get all the stuff I need, I hear that Freeport is home to 2 of the <br/>
banded making smiths on my server. What server your friend play? Thanks for <br/>
the info, hope to be able to make banded soon.</div>
