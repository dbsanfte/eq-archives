<div id="ygrps-yiv-496369497">HI <br/>
<br/>
I have been in permafrost for most of the last week and a half have gone<br/>
form level 21 to 25 fighting only in the preacher and Arch rooms. There are<br/>
very few people in perma doing this right now so pretty easy if you want to<br/>
take your friends up and grab one of the rooms.The items you can get are in<br/>
the Arch room the mask +3 str, and the ARch pack that lowers weight of<br/>
items by 20%. In the Preacher room Runed Circlet - 4AC, +4 intel, +4 wis,<br/>
Cold Iron Moring Star - damage 9, delay 28 I believe.<br/>
<br/>
anyway what I need to know about the Ebony Blade. Stats, Where is it etc.<br/>
Thanks</div>
