&gt;There are now several types of silk to be made.  As you mentioned:<br/>
&gt;Silk- made by combining spider silk<br/>
&gt;Cured Silk- made by combining silk with heady kiola and other items<br/>
&gt;Glowing Silk- made by combining silk (or maybe cured silk) with enchanters<br/>
&gt;&quot;mana&quot; spells (vicious, purified, etc)<br/>
&gt;Shadowed Silk- made by combining silk (don&#39;t know which one) with necromancer<br/>
&gt;spells, and quest items<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not sure of all the stuff found so far, but several of the web sites have the<br/>
&gt;instructions<br/>
