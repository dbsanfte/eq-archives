<b>Subject:</b> training guards <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-30146453">Yes, training guards, blocking etc is illegal BUT it is up to the discretion<br/>
of every guide that gets called to the scene and every server is not treated<br/>
equal. If you feel that a guide is being biased and is not adhereing the the<br/>
rules you may repetition or ask for your issue to be escalated to a GM.<br/>
Personally I think it should be legal. If I see halfling guards getting<br/>
kited you can bet I would love to snare/root the evil %$##$ doing it. IMHO<br/>
It is a risk factor that should be allowed.<br/>
<br/>
Run through any dungeon killing something and the dungeon NPC residents are<br/>
going to jump in and assist in anyway they can, why should PC residents be<br/>
treated eany different? You want to see a train created that causes problems<br/>
with getting out of a dungeon... go sit in Splitpaw for a while. At least<br/>
every couple of hours the front door area is blocked by 5-15 gnolls of<br/>
various levels due to a train created and all the other NPCs jumping in. I<br/>
dont see anyone petitioning to get them in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
I know in a few areas the higher levels are acting as guards in places they<br/>
are killing them. This gives the newbies a place to run to that is basically<br/>
stronger than the guards to begin with since they are killing them after<br/>
all. These people normally SoW and buff all the newbies also. Yes it takes a<br/>
way some of the roleplaying perspective but it keeps everyone happy and GMs<br/>
out of it.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the issue of &quot;you dont have to kill them, you can hunt somewhere<br/>
else&quot; well yes and no. From a roleplaying side if things many people have<br/>
taken it upon themselves to pick a race to &quot;eliminate&quot; from Norrath. Neriak<br/>
guards are high on that list. But so are Ogres. I see plenty of evil<br/>
characters picking off halfling guards and Karanas guards also. So this is<br/>
not an issue suffered by evil races only. Dark elves that stay in Nektulos<br/>
Forest for any length of time end up hunting halflings, no reason why<br/>
halflings shouldn&#39;t come back and return the favor. I know I do.</div>
