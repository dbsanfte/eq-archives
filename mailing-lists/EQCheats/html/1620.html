<b>Subject:</b> Hex Editing the Tutorial <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-622939219">I&#39;ve heard that you can hex edit the Tutorial.exe so that you can view any zone in the game free of mobs.  I was just wondering how exactly you do that.  What files to open with what, which lines of code to replace, etc.  Thanks in advance.</div>
