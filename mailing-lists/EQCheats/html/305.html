<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215923954">Befallen is wild.... I haven&#39;t yet figured out the Troll SK for the BBC (and<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten about 5 BBC&#39;s  between me and parties I&#39;ve been in). SK will<br/>
spawn anywhere form 30 minutes to 6 hours.... I seen him spawn 30 minutes<br/>
after we killed him once, 2 BBCs in 30 minutes is nice... And, he hadden&#39;t<br/>
spawned more than once in 10 hours that entire day. The line is supposed to<br/>
be the spikes. Don&#39;t pass the spikes if you can help it. <br/>
<br/>
The Thurg robes necro will spawn in a pattern. On the spot that she spawns,<br/>
spawns ghouls, necros, and the priest (take some firepower in for the<br/>
priest). She will NOT spawn (and the others will) if your past the last<br/>
ledge and actually in the room. You need to be atleast on the last<br/>
step/ledge going into the room. My guess, is that robes are possible every<br/>
30 or 40 minutes if done right.<br/>

Hi all.  I have a question or two about the basement of Befallen...<br/>
<br/>
We went down in hopes of getting a BBC for our Pally last night.  We were<br/>
there for two hours or so, and never saw the SK.  We were told that there is<br/>
a &quot;spawn line&quot;, ie, don&#39;t cross it or the SK will not spawn.  Is this the<br/>
case?  If so, is that line at the end of the tunnel?  Or inside the room?<br/>
It was fairly frustrating.  Also, there was another group there camping for<br/>
the Robes, and I never saw that Theor..they...whatever guy that is supposed<br/>
to drop the robes.  Does the same thing apply for him?<br/>
<br/>
Lastly..how often would you say the SK would normally spawn?  Every 1/2<br/>
hour?  Hour?  2 hours?  I probably will not return to Befallen, unless it is<br/>
with my Paladin with the objective of getting that BBC for him....so the<br/>
info would be appreciated.  That place is just swarming with DE&#39;s, and it<br/>
makes my dwarven skin crawl.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
