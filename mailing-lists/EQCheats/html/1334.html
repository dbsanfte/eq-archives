went<br/>
<br/>
-- this would make him lvl 20-21... when was the last time you saw something<br/>
that double hit for --70 damage that was lvl 20-21? and yes i know this<br/>
because he hit me for that much when i  was --lvl 31.<br/>
<br/>
on to take out me (ranger), a level 23 warrior with the Executioners Axe,<br/>

warrior!).<br/>
