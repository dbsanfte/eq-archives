<div id="ygrps-yiv-104208118">Aradune is Brad&#39;s character....he and 2 other people are the three head<br/>
programmers and basically came up with the entire game.  <br/>
<br/>
Most class&#39;s have some weapon that only they can use.  I haer there is an<br/>
SK only weapon....Fiery Avenger for paladins i guess, Druids have the<br/>
oaken scimitar...I hear tell of a ranger only weapon too.  Warrior&#39;s<br/>
should be able to use any and all weapons, they are the MASTERS of melee.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A monk or any other class can&#39;t toast you if they can&#39;t hit you.  Blind,<br/>
Fear, Root(which paladins get) plus many other spells like levitate or<br/>
whatnot.  <br/>
<br/>
Paladins can LAY ON HANDS.....that, from what i undestand, heals up to 500<br/>
HP.....500 HIT POINTS.  Thats a good amount in my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
I think Verant did a pretty good job balancing the class&#39;s.  Not too<br/>
mention this game is not a PvP game...its meant for grouping and fun.  I<br/>
think they balanced the class&#39;s against NPC&#39;s excelently....if you want<br/>
to PvP, go to a game that was meant for it or go play quake.</div>
