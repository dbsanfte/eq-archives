<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118494949">I&#39;ve done the Crafted Greaves quest (Just have Helm and Breastplate left!) and<br/>
you have the correct item. If you were to speak with Ulan Meadowgreen and ask<br/>
him about the greaves, he will tell you about a Dark Elf Necromancer who<br/>
terrorized his old home town, blah blah blah. Anyway, you need to give the Dark<br/>
Circlet and I believe 2 Star Rubies to Ulan (or his brother) to get the<br/>
greaves.<br/>
<br/>
The best way I have found to get the cheapest prices on gems for the crafted<br/>
armor quests, is to make a Female Human Enchanter and base her in Freeport.<br/>
Bring her over to the blue house just outside the market area that has the bank<br/>
in it. The blue building is the gem shop. My lvl 1 Female Human Enchanter gets<br/>
star rubies for 68p, Sapphires for 105p. Cheapest prices around. That would<br/>
mean a pair of gauntlets 136p and you can easily sell them for 200p.<br/>
<br/>
****IMPORTANT NOTE!****<br/>
For the Crafted Armor quests, if they ask for 2 or more of the same gem, when<br/>
you give them the gems and the component, DO NOT stack the gems. Make sure you<br/>
separate each of them but give them all at one time.<br/>
<br/>
Example: Crafted gauntlets call for an Aviak Charm and 2 Star Rubies. Give the<br/>
centaur the aviak charm, then 1 ruby, then another. So out of the 4 slots<br/>
available in the GIVE window, 3 are occupied.<br/>
