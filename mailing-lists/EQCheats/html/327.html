<div id="ygrps-yiv-980293022">Alright, I saw someone moaning about not being able to unsubscribe in one of<br/>
the posts in the last digest I got, so I&#39;ll tell ya. Go to www.onelist.com.<br/>
I&#39;m 90% sure you had to go to that web site to subscribe to the damn list in<br/>
the first place anyway... and they made you pick a password for your email<br/>
address. Log on with your email address and password and you can either (A)<br/>
unsubscribe or (B) change any list to DIGEST format, which puts up to like<br/>
20 mails in ONE email so you NEVER get spammed. Try it out. In fact,<br/>
remember this for any lists you subscribe to in the future; most listservs<br/>
have a DIGEST option to reduce spam. I subscribe to over TEN lists and never<br/>
have to worry about my mailbox being cluttered because each message is<br/>
clearly marked with the name of the list in the subject line, and says<br/>
Digest. Good luck to you all, pass this knowledge along to anyone you know<br/>
who likes mailing lists.</div>
