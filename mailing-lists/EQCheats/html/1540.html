<div id="ygrps-yiv-652379132">According to Everlore, here&#39;s how to check if you have enough faction:<br/>
<br/>
Note: An easy way to check your faction for this quest is to go to Renth and<br/>
say &quot;I will hunt the murderer.&quot; If he gives you more information about it,<br/>
you have high enough faction to complete the quest. A great way to raise<br/>
your faction is to give gnoll fangs to Lysbeth McNaff in sets of three. She<br/>
is at the Pit of Doom.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that you need more than just amiable, but not so much that it&#39;s<br/>
warmly, so somewhere inbetween the two.<br/>

Subject: [EQCheats] Jared: Why you have to be that way??<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Does anybody know what faction (amiable, warmly, etc) that you need with<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Halas merchants to perform the Langseax quests???<br/>
&gt; I spent about 3 hours running around Black Burrow the last couple of days,<br/>
&gt; killing anything that moved.  It seems like one out of about 10 gnolls<br/>
drops<br/>
&gt; a Gnoll Tooth (fang??).  I&#39;ve collected 38 of them...killed maybe 300 -<br/>
400<br/>
&gt; gnolls.  Tedious...VERY tedious.<br/>
&gt; Anyway...I was going to try the Langseax quest next time I can get<br/>
together<br/>
&gt; with my Druid friend (for tracking and SoW...heard this is useful for<br/>
&gt; following the dog during the quest)...but I was hoping somebody could give<br/>
&gt; me an idea of what faction will work so I&#39;m not wasting (any more) time.<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
