<b>Subject:</b> Frozen Gob in Permafrost? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835725825">Anybody have any info on the frozen gob in Permafrost?  One of my maps<br/>
indicates the room that he is in is the &quot;King&quot; room, but I believe that is a<br/>
mistake.  The gob is in an oval shaped room in a giant block of ice.  He is<br/>
wearing some sort of a hat or crown, and he is not targetable.<br/>
Anybody know anything about this gob?</div>
