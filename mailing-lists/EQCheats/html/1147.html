<div id="ygrps-yiv-776743095">Schweeeett... When I played UO, I had two accounts and ALWAYS had two<br/>
players on. Had a GM Blacksmith on one accountt hat I used, plus my Warrior<br/>
Mage characters on the other... Damage shield is an excellent idea for TRUE<br/>
Powergaming.... Well done on the Super Twink! (Miss a bit of the fun<br/>
though...heh).<br/>

Lord Grimrot is a rare spawn and also spawns in two incarnations.  The Human<br/>
Shadowknight (What you saw) is L35 and usually carrys the Opaline Scythe (No<br/>
drop SK/Warrior only weapon.)  Or sometimes he spawns in a lower level<br/>
(L25?) skeleton form.  In either case when he spawns shout that he&#39;s out and<br/>
see if someone wants to kill him, then wait 24 norrathian hours.  After that<br/>
time if he isn&#39;t dead he will de-spawn.  BTW: One reason I&#39;ve been so quiet<br/>
lately is I&#39;ve been massivly twinking a new character.  Also the reason I<br/>
know about the above information (Particuarlly the de-spawn.)  I have 3<br/>
computers capable of playing eq next to eachother, and on one I have a<br/>
friends L39 druid, on the other my newbie.  Walk into the skel fields at L8,<br/>
put Skin like diamonds, shield of spikes on the newbie, have him trigger all<br/>
the putrids, and watch them kill thesmelves on<br/>
the damage shield.  Only two things need to watch out for.  First is healnig<br/>
of course.  Second is, you don&#39;t get exp for a monster unless you damage it<br/>
first.  So if something dies on just the shield, no xp.  So either cast an<br/>
AoE, or make sure to target what&#39;s hitting you and melee it once in turn.<br/>
Another interesting thing I learned is unless you piss them off, only 3<br/>
monsters will attack you at once.  Using the above methods, I&#39;ve raised from<br/>
1 to 20 in maybe 22 hours of real playing time.  Knwoing what I know now, I<br/>
could do it even faster.  (I experimented for an hour or two at places that<br/>
didn&#39;t pay off.)  The bigest downside is that right now I&#39;m spending about 3<br/>
hours raising spell skills that i never used.  Try explaining to people why<br/>
their cleric can&#39;t cast SPirit Armour because they only have a 20<br/>
Abjuration!</div>
