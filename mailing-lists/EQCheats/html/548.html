<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999359026">Ok, today I sent in a longgg  report on their skills, and how they are going about them.<br/>
<br/>
As to answer your question, pottery is now useless, profit is none acceptable as it costs more to<br/>
use or make something then it does to sell it. As I said earlier in my report on the changes, this<br/>
change has also been made to many other sketches in pottery, and the profit for those are not<br/>
acceptable either. Your right, we should have the abilitie to choose what we want to do in EQ.<br/>
Warrior, healer, venturer, greedy merchant it&#39;s all our choice, why you ask, because we are paying<br/>
for it. And in previous statements made by Sony, indicated that these were possible, that we as<br/>
members of society have the abilities to choose what we want to do. Now witht he vamping of most<br/>
skills *regardless if it&#39;s to balance them out*, is leaning us more into the Fight kill be a<br/>
warrior type character, or such. Either case, someone couldn&#39;t take up some skills and just become<br/>
masters at them now because of the changes, their pointless in making anything especially Pottery,<br/>
what can you do with a empty Pie Tin, make a pie from bakery ? Bakery it&#39;self was changed and is<br/>
now to much to increase the skill in and the profit is again nill and void.<br/>
<br/>
Where&#39;s EQ going with all this I ask, when are we going to say something about the changes ? Well,<br/>
I already have said my piece to them. you don&#39;t need to flame them or rant about the changes, but<br/>
imply your own feelings towards what you think is going on, and always remember the fact that you<br/>
are paying for this game to play it.<br/>
