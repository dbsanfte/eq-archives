<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162163654">with all of this conversation about how cool a weapon is and how its unfiar<br/>
that paladins have a huge sword &quot;the best weapon&quot; on EQ everyone is<br/>
forgetting.... there are a million other quests...there are a million other<br/>
items... I&#39;ve heard there are still things that people have not found yet as<br/>
well as brand new things that are added every week. Just have fun wit the<br/>
world...explore find new things dont worry if only paladins can get the<br/>
fiery avenger that just means i can devote my tyime to another quest  its no<br/>
big deal...<br/>

My Paladin only misses once out of every eight tries.  You also have to<br/>
take into account that we can buff ourselves pretty well stacking our<br/>
spirit armor, bravery, and guard spells to take our AC beyond that of a<br/>
warrior or monk and Symbal of Tranzil to add 250 more hit points by itself.<br/>
<br/>
I think Verant has done a pretty good job in making the classes pretty<br/>
comparable.<br/>
