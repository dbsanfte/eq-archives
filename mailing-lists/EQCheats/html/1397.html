<div id="ygrps-yiv-243470938">I happened to wander by and con them yesterday... the chief glowered <br/>
dubiously at me, and was yellow at 33...so he is probably 35.  The guards <br/>
were green and the shamans were blue, also at level 33, so they are much <br/>
lower.  They were all amiable except the chief, so I didn&#39;t kill any &lt;G&gt;.  <br/>
Also, the Chief said something about [enchanting the stone] when I hailed <br/>
him...and when I asked him about that, he said I had best be on my way and <br/>
wouldn&#39;t talk about it.  I assume he was referring to the large stone they <br/>
are all standing around...anyone have more info or get something else out of <br/>
the chief?<br/>

&gt;    They are found on the Ogres in W. Karana. It is on<br/>
&gt;  the Ogre Shaman and above if I recall, I wasn&#39;t paying<br/>
&gt;  attention which mob we got it from. I have one and<br/>
&gt;  like it very much. Not sure on the value though.<br/>
