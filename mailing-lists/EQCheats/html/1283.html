<div id="ygrps-yiv-163941345">Trezdon is a Necromancer. If you speak with Ulan Meadowgreen (named Centaur in<br/>
S Karana that gives the quest), he will tell you a story about an evil Dark Elf<br/>
Necromancer, blah blah blah. The Dark Circlet is actually a pretty decent piece<br/>
of headgear but is NEC only. I think it&#39;s better than the Savants Cap but not<br/>
as good as the Runed Circlet. I&#39;m sure after you get your greaves, if you&#39;re<br/>
ever back in Najena camping JBoots or something, pick up another Dark Circlet<br/>
and you might be able to sell it for a good buck.</div>
