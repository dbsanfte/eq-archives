&gt; When you see the raiders in the distance, walk inlands and around them and<br/>
&gt; then back down to the coast.<br/>
&gt; Or get a invisibility to pass them.<br/>
&gt; Or get a teleport by a druid to east karana, see to it that you are invis<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you Drokk, I will walk around them today.  I just was not sure if I<br/>
could<br/>
go to far up on the hill.  But the way folks where talking if I go from the<br/>
cost line<br/>
I would be killed as soon as something saw me.  Fresh Meat I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Drokk again for all the help may your skills always be at their<br/>
fullest.<br/>

&gt; You can easily get to East Karana by hugging the coast and then simply go<br/>
&gt; around the raiders and then back to the coast.  Just run along the high<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; To be even safer.  Stop at the Wizard Spires at the first stone bridge and<br/>
&gt; get either a sow or Invisibility or even both.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So that is what that thing near the bridge is :)    Thank you so much Wizaro<br/>
Wrathcaster.  I will do that also on the way down.<br/>

Thank you again Wizaro Wrathcaster may your mana always be be full<br/>

&gt; Doesn&#39;t look like anyone told you where Milea is.  When you make it to<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; K, head east across the zone until you get to a Valley.  This is the same<br/>
&gt; valley that leads to High Pass.  I am pretty sure the north south loc is<br/>
&gt; zero.  You can also follow the path from the bridge, just go towards High<br/>
&gt; Pass.  When you get to the entrance, Almost everyone will take the path<br/>
&gt; going up.  You need the one that is level, or down.  She is near the very<br/>

Rain was a pain for me to see in.  What a great idea :)<br/>

Thank you so much Brian and good hunting to you always.<br/>
