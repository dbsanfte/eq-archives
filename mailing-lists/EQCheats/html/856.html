 Speaking of GM organized events....the other day on my server (Xegony) a GM<br/>
 took over the Tae Archeon in Cazic Thule.....he was a lvl 50 Wizard and was<br/>
 casting Ice Comet.....he killed everybody...no one lost any exp though which<br/>
 was cool....the GM did finally fall to a Lvl 50 Mage named Hast who hangs<br/>
 out in CT actually helping people!!! That&#39;s right a lvl 50 who helps<br/>
 people.....anyways  Hast told me he got a FULL set of rubicite armor and a<br/>
 shiny mettalic robe off the GM controlled Tae Archeon.....WOW is all I could<br/>
 say &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why did the GM Wizard have rubicite armor? Can Wizards can&#39;t wear that stuff <br/>
and lvl 50 or not a Wizard would never have the strength to carry it around <br/>
in inventory.  This seems bizarre<br/>
