<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391344591">I was camping in najena for Jboots for 6 hours and didnt see any boots, the<br/>
guy that was first in line for the boots had been there for 26 hours<br/>
straight and had only seen one pair!  Is there some sort of trick or secret<br/>
to obtain these boots?</div>
