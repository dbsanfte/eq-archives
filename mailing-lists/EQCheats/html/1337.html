<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398957842">As far as I know, the Ice Crytal Staff doesn&#39;t come from Perma. Not from a<br/>
goblin atleast, maybe it&#39;s on an Ice Giant, or something beyond the 30-<br/>
goblins around there (or could be a rare on something in the &#39;Patriach<br/>
room&#39;, as some have called it). The PReacher has The CIM (Cold Iron<br/>
Morningstar) or a (much rarer) Runed Circlet.<br/>

Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
Im in permafrost and I have been hunting for the mob that has the Ice<br/>
Crystal Staff. I was under the impression that it was the Preacher that had<br/>
it. But I can&#39;t seem to get it.. Anyone know if it is the preacher or is it<br/>
in another area ?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I read on everlore that the staffs are part of a quest. Somehow you<br/>
can use the Water Crystal Staff and starts a long quest to get a great mage<br/>
useable one handed magic staff or something... Im curious if any of you have<br/>
any idea as to what it is ?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
Reuben</div>
