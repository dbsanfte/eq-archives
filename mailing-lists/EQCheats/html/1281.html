<b>Subject:</b> Raising Faction in evil cites... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-372726058">I don&#39;t think so.... but then again it&#39;s been a while since I played my DE necro and tried it.<br/>
<br/>
I was told by someone that the only reason the halflings were in Nektouls forrest was to raise<br/>
faction. I think it was more for the visiting trolls and orges that needed a little help to get<br/>
certain vendors to sell to them and such. It may be more trouble than it&#39;s worth for someone who is<br/>
KoS in Neriak. (There are guards that wander and you could run into them.. unlikely, but possible.<br/>
Especially, if some DE wanted to mess with you and trained one or two onto you.)<br/>
<br/>
The easiest way to find out if faction goes down with all halflings would be to go to Nek forrest<br/>
and give a shout.... Most likely, there is someone who just killed one and can tell you. Or try<br/>
conning one of the halflings themselves.... if they like you as much as the regular halflings do<br/>
then I would guess you would not want to go to the halfling town after getting your faction up with<br/>
the evil races. But if they scowl at you then I think it would be pretty safe to take them out.<br/>

&gt; Does this lower halfling faction at the same time?<br/>

&gt; I believe killing halflings in Nektulos forest raises Neriak factions, just<br/>
&gt; look out for our guards!  When you zone in, follow the zone wall to the left<br/>
&gt; and you&#39;ll run into they&#39;re camp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I was wondering about raising faction in a few cities. Halas,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oggok, Neriak,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and Grobb (the &#39;evil&#39; cities and the Barb city). </span></blockquote></div>
