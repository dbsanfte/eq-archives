Honeycombs are found off of Bixies and Bixie Drones.  These little guys are <br/>
prolly like lvl 2 -4 ...certainly none that I can remember higher than <br/>
5....I was collecting them last week and selling them for one plat <br/>
each...made a bundle of $$ that way (wee at least for a lvl 8 character <br/>
:)they are used for making Honeyjum....and , I think for another quest...but <br/>
after selling a bunch of the honeycomb I began wondering why it was so <br/>
valuable...and I STILL don&#39;t understand why people are paying such an <br/>
outrageous amount of $$ for it!!<br/>
Anybody know the answer to this puzzle</div>
