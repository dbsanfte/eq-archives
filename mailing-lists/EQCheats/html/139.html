&gt; bragged about.  But these places I&#39;m sure are few and far between, if they<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kera Isle is full of MOB&#39;s that like to train, an no one to help out.<br/>
The best loot I got there in 2 days of hunting Pridesman, Clawknights<br/>
Kera Guards and Huntress&#39;s were some gem stones.  Mostly I got fish.<br/>
<br/>
I did meet up with some fellow travelers, and, as we were the only <br/>
people in the zone, we got great exp, which is what I need anyway.<br/>
