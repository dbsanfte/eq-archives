<b>Subject:</b> Post awhile back on Crafted Locations <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-109110465">There was an excellent post either earlier this week or end of laat week on<br/>
locations on all of the items required for the crafted pieces (or many of<br/>
them). If anyone still has this list, could you either re-post it or email<br/>
it to me?<br/>
<br/>
If not, can we fill the list back out again?<br/>
<br/>
Aviak Charms, Gauntlets - Aviak Avocents in SK, 28-30th level (confirmed)<br/>
<br/>
Frost Totem, Boots - Shamans (High or not?) in Perma?<br/>
<br/>
Optic Nerves, Bracer - Evil Eyes anywhere (Beholder, 20-24th levelish -<br/>
confirmed)<br/>
<br/>
Werewolf Talons, Breastplate - Werewolves in Mistmoore or any of them? What<br/>
level?<br/>
<br/>
Stolen circlet, Greaves - Najena on a necromancer? which one?<br/>
<br/>
Fire Totem, Helm - Goblins in Sol A or B? which? And what level and<br/>
specifically which goblins?<br/>
<br/>
Eye of Griffon, Vambrace - Any type of Griffon (ewwe/awne), just just the<br/>
big mommies? Level 30-35ish? Karanas and Commons.<br/>
<br/>
3 pieces of the Rune of the Dwarves, Pauldrun - Runny Eye, on a goblin<br/>
prolly, but no clue which one. Level 20+ atleast.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone bring some certainty to this list? Thanks!</div>
