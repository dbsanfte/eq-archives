<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465455617"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I found a hollow skull with in the karanas somewhere, which is a container<br/>
&gt;with only 2 slots and a combine button, It came off of a gnoll looking<br/>
&gt;animal, with white fur, shortly after a zone that i can&#39;t remember which it<br/>
&gt;is - Anyone know what this is used for? and what goes inside it? :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the hollow skull quest, a pretty nice quest for mage types.  You<br/>
need to have a group at about 30 to complete the quest (The last mob you<br/>
have to kill is about level 32).  The gnoll assassin you killed was chasing<br/>
a NPC named Yiz Pon.  Talk to him and he&#39;ll get you started on the quest.<br/>
