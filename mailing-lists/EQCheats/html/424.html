<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613537136">Kedge keep is lvl 30+.  It&#39;s one of the hardest dungeons in the game. <br/>
There is a reason no one has explored it in depth.  If you die in it,<br/>
you&#39;re gonna have a hell of a time getting back to your body.  It&#39;s kind<br/>
of obvious that it holds some very kick ass items.  The ones no one can<br/>
find anywhere.. but the people continue to leave kedge keep untouched. <br/>
And you&#39;re cleric won&#39;t do so hot in kedge.  you need someone to cast a<br/>
water breathing spell on you.  That or a fish bone earring.</div>
