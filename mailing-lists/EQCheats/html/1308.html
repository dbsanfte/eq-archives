<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110429362">SO Im in permafrost now.. just got there late last night.. cool place.. (no<br/>
pun intended) anyhow.. I hear there are some good loot there. I am in it for<br/>
Exp mainly but some items or a good item to give to my future wife would be<br/>
great. I am 20 and with my pet i didn&#39;t die once.. so we are good to go. I<br/>
will of course group as soon as possible.. dangers when you are alone...<br/>
So.. my question is..<br/>
<br/>
What can i expect Lootwise and from who ? I am a magicuser, so anything good<br/>
for me, I want to target.. I know group of course.. but i just want to know<br/>
what im getting into.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone give me any advice in case i can&#39;t find a group ? i did okay.. it<br/>
was like 2 ice gobs then med.. 2 ice gobs med.. seemed to be my flow.. fine<br/>
by me.. because my exp bar was going up..</div>
