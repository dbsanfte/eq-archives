<div id="ygrps-yiv-804988300">Gladly so too. Its about time quests start giving some exp again, also its<br/>
around a lvl 25 and up quest so there should be a nice size chunk of exp.<br/>
Granted you have to cash out like 278 plat for the gems. (for the star rubies).<br/>
I only completed the gauntlets portion as of yet but hope that the exp gain is<br/>
the same or more for the rest of the items too.<br/>
<br/>
Also anyone wanna sell some good wisdom eq on sol server? Got alot of money to<br/>
burn.</div>
