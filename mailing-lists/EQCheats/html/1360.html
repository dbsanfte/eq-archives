 The plain (sic) of fear is already there.  You just have to be 46th<br/>
 level to get to it.  And they&#39;re adding two continents, not one.  And a<br/>
 number of races.  If you go to eq.stratics.com and check out the various<br/>
 news articles you might find more solid information.<br/>

smaller than Antonica.  They are adding one new race (lizardman like race) a <br/>
bunch of new monsters, dramatically improved graphics including translucent <br/>
water and moving parts on buildings. About 15 total new zones.<br/>
<br/>
Also, two new zones are soon to be added via patch.<br/>
