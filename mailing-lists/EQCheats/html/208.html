<div id="ygrps-yiv-65650201">Ok first off, I am only a Level 16 monk so I do not have very many rare<br/>
spoilers for you guys.  However, I have a few odds and ends that I have<br/>
picked up in my travels.  Some of this stuff is what I have heard, so<br/>
take it as you will.<br/>
<br/>
There is a glowing torch found on a rare spawn in Lavastorm...It gives 4<br/>
AC, adds +5 charisma, and can be used as a lighting source when held in<br/>
your hand.<br/>
<br/>
After receiving the Squad Ring from the quest in Riverdale, you can use<br/>
it to kill Nillipus fairly easily.  All you have to do is lure Nillipus<br/>
into the cleric&#39;s guide, where the ring can be recharged, and then use<br/>
the ring when you are low on health.  You can then recharge the ring at<br/>
one on the NPC&#39;s.  I do not have the squad ring yet, so i can not verify<br/>
that this works.  I would appreciate it if someone would tell me how to<br/>
recharge the ring?<br/>
<br/>
When talking to NPC&#39;s, they give keywords in brackets.  To activate<br/>
these keywords you have to ask a question using the keyword.  Usually, a<br/>
simple question such as What [keyword]? will do the trick.  However,<br/>
when the keyword is a person, then it requires a Who [keyword]?  I know<br/>
this sounds pretty simple, but it took me forever to figure out.  :)<br/>
<br/>
There are a pair of Shiny Silk Gloves which are found on the Queen<br/>
Spider in Lesser Faydark, i forget stats but I believe they are<br/>
magical.  It would take about a level 16 group to get them.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, that about ends my knowledge...know, i have a request for a few<br/>
spoilers of my own<br/>
Most of these deal with packs or  bags which reduce the weight of things<br/>
put inside...<br/>
For all of these, I would love to have information on:<br/>
% of weight reduction<br/>
where it is found<br/>
what level to get it<br/>
how much do they sell for<br/>
<br/>
Shralok Pack- I know it comes from Highhold Pass, thats it<br/>
<br/>
Bag of Sewn Evil Eye- Found in Lower Guk?, 8 slots<br/>
<br/>
Traveler&#39;s Backpack- found on Rathyl in Najena, need to get keys or<br/>
something to find him<br/>
<br/>
Traveler&#39;s Pouch- found on Rathyl in Najena, can only hold small items<br/>
<br/>
Traveler&#39;s Pack- reduces weight by 20%, 8 slots, sometimes reward for<br/>
Nillipus quest<br/>
<br/>
Archaelogist&#39;s Pack- found on Goblin Archaelogist in Permafrost, 6 slots<br/>
<br/>
Lionhide Backpack- found in South Karana? off of a rare spawn<br/>
<br/>
Pierce&#39;s Pouch of Storing- reduces weight of items by 50-75%, 8 slots,<br/>
sometimes a reward from Nillipus quest<br/>
<br/>
If you know of anymore weight reduces packs, and have information on<br/>
where to get them, please let me know...Any information about these<br/>
items would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Also, where is the best place to find black pearls if I wanted to buy<br/>
them?<br/>
And info on the Serpent Skin Eyepatch would be appreciated...<br/>
<br/>
Sorry so long,<br/>
All help is appreciated,<br/>
