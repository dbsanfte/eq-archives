<div id="ygrps-yiv-536743597">Except for the fact that he took what I said out of<br/>
context. I didn&#39;t say I wanted to solo, and I didn&#39;t<br/>
say I wanted to solo dragons even at 50. I said that<br/>
even when you reach level 50, there is plenty more to<br/>
do in the game. <br/>
<br/>
The reason why I stated the RP is 1/10th of UO was to<br/>
explain the reason why I powerlevel. I wouldn&#39;t go<br/>
back there due to the reasons I stated before: Player<br/>
Killers, bugs and exploits. <br/>
<br/>
If you enjoy mapping or whatever, that&#39;s good for you.<br/>

&gt; Damn man, what do you think a dragon should be<br/>
&gt; able to be soloed?<br/>
&gt; The game is only what you make of it, so if you<br/>
&gt; think its 1/10th of UO<br/>
&gt; Then go back there or like you said play<br/>
&gt; heroes. I can&#39;t stress the fact<br/>
&gt; That you get out only what you put in to the<br/>
&gt; game. I have nights where<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll do nothing but try to map, I guess that<br/>
&gt; makes me lame since I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; Leveling while I&#39;m doing it though huh? If<br/>
&gt; someone is not enjoying the <br/>
&gt; Game then try to find a different circle of<br/>
&gt; friends, they may be the cause.<br/>
&gt; Or try going to a different area. sorry for the<br/>
&gt; rant all but this list has<br/>
&gt; somehow<br/>
&gt; Gone from cheats to a bitch list and I know I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not helping here but anywho.<br/>
&gt; God forbid anyone have to group...<br/>

&gt;    I am not really in a great hurry, but I like<br/>
&gt; to see<br/>
&gt;  my character advance. The RP aspects of this<br/>
&gt; game are<br/>
&gt;  about 1/10th of UO&#39;s even though that game was<br/>
&gt; riddled<br/>
&gt;  with Player Killers, bugs and exploits. I<br/>
&gt; enjoy the<br/>
&gt;  game, but I feel after playing similar game<br/>
&gt; types that<br/>
&gt;  this game corrals you more into the powergamer<br/>
&gt; role. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I get into the mindset that I can play this<br/>
&gt; game for a<br/>
&gt;  few hours and be about the same as I started<br/>
&gt; or I can<br/>
&gt;  play something like Heroes of Might and Magic<br/>
&gt; III and<br/>
&gt;  go through a few scenarios. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I will more likely plan to leave due to slow<br/>
&gt; leveling<br/>
&gt;  than I would if I would see constant<br/>
&gt; improvements in<br/>
&gt;  my character. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Even level 50s still have to go in two full<br/>
&gt; groups to<br/>
&gt;  take on the tougher stuff like the dragons. <br/>
