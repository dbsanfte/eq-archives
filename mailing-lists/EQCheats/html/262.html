 I&#39;m interested in the dueling stuff.<br/>
 Do you loose exp if you die in a /duel match or one of those pvp areas like<br/>
 in qeynos?<br/>
 You loose the money you currently have on you?  Do you loose any items?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you duel in a city arenas like the arenas in Queynos and Freeport and the <br/>
one near Lake Rathe:<br/>
<br/>
1) your corpse cannot be looted by your opponent or anyone else if you die<br/>
2) you do not lose or gain any experience points<br/>
3)  The embarrasing sever wide message &quot;(insert PC name) has been defeated by <br/>
(insert PC name) in a duel&quot; does not go out.<br/>
4) you do not lose any faction (unfortunantly, do to a bug this last point is <br/>
not currently true - I think they are fixing the faction loss bug soon - many <br/>
tournaments have been postponed because of this)<br/>
<br/>
So, in summary - Dueling in the city arenas is just for fun, and very fun it <br/>
is.  It&#39;s also hilarious when someone in the crowd who is watching (from <br/>
outside the arena boundry) tries to get cute by casting a spell on one of the <br/>
combatants (like a heal or a root).  You can be guaranteed that in a few <br/>
seconds a Guard is going to come slay whoever that asshole was.  I&#39;ve seen it <br/>
happen a few times and it&#39;s hilarious!!<br/>
<br/>
My first time dueling in the arena was with my 14th lvl Erudite Wizard.  I <br/>
dueled a 16th lvl Barb Shaman - he said that the duel would start upon my <br/>
first attack.  Wellllllllllllll, you can guess what my first attack was (er, <br/>
ROOT! of course).  He was was rooted and we traded damage spells for about 5 <br/>
or 6 rounds and being the damage god that us Wizards are, you can guess the <br/>
result (I hit for 79 at the time).<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, have fun dueling in the arenas, its adds a whole new lvl of fun to <br/>
the game.<br/>
