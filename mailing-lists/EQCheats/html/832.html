<div id="ygrps-yiv-650653921">Haha! This could be said about anything, my friend (the IQ test comment).<br/>
 <br/>
Personally, this whole conversation is not needed. All I have to say about<br/>
it is this: Nick, no one cares about this but you. And, where I&#39;m wrong<br/>
about this, the only other people that care are those that want to prove you<br/>
wrong. <br/>
 <br/>
Can we please just stop this conversation? The laptop thread I was fine<br/>
with. Not that I read much of it, but it had some good info in the thread.<br/>
Nick&#39;s &quot;bitch&quot; thread is way overdue to die. Please, let it.<br/>

Dear Nick<br/>
 <br/>
    hahaha,  This person does not know too much about the internet.  Ever<br/>
hear about Message Rules?  You can have emails BLOCKED you know.  Now, I<br/>
don&#39;t know what that person wrote to you,  But there&#39;s nothing really a<br/>
court can do about this.  I know. I work for a ISP, and just about all you<br/>
can do is get there account terminated from that ISP.  Now if I was getting<br/>
crap mail like that.  It&#39;s going right to my Blocked list to be deleted of<br/>
the server.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
*wishes people had to take a IQ test to be able to get on the internet*<br/>

Well, I warned this person to stop emailing me.  As per my lawyers request I<br/>
had warned him before not to email me or a proof reading fee would be<br/>
exempted to his university/his parents.  He sent me an email this morning<br/>
that was lengthy and I didn&#39;t even bother reading it.  Again (to the people<br/>
of the list), do not send me private emails.  Mr. Clark is going to have to<br/>
go to small claims court because of his actions. </span></blockquote></div>
