<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097636710">The honey jum is for a cleric/paladin quest in Qeynos.  The result of the<br/>
quest is the Shinging Star of Light (a mace 6 28 that cast clense).  You<br/>
must have high faction with the Priest of Life to do this quest, which is a<br/>
pain cause there is only a few things you can do to raise the faction.  The<br/>
mace itself is worth around 20 pp or so and involves some running around<br/>
between WK and Qeynos.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Honeycombs are found off of Bixies and Bixie Drones.  These<br/>
&gt; little guys are<br/>
&gt; prolly like lvl 2 -4 ...certainly none that I can remember higher than<br/>
&gt; 5....I was collecting them last week and selling them for one plat<br/>
&gt; each...made a bundle of $$ that way (wee at least for a lvl 8 character :)<br/>
&gt; they are used for making Honeyjum....and , I think for another quest...but<br/>
&gt; after selling a bunch of the honeycomb I began wondering why it was so<br/>
&gt; valuable...and I STILL don&#39;t understand why people are paying such an<br/>
&gt; outrageous amount of $$ for it!!<br/>
&gt; Anybody know the answer to this puzzle&gt;&gt;????<br/>
