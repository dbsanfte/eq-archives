<div id="ygrps-yiv-778077493">I found a hollow skull with in the karanas somewhere, which is a container<br/>
with only 2 slots and a combine button, It came off of a gnoll looking<br/>
animal, with white fur, shortly after a zone that i can&#39;t remember which it<br/>
is - Anyone know what this is used for? and what goes inside it? :)<br/>
