: About the cloaks...what kind of skin/pelt do you need to turn in and what<br/>
: kind or critter drops them most often?  I&#39;m guessing Polar Bears do but we<br/>
: all know that EQ doesn&#39;t need to make sense all the time :).<br/>
<br/>
You need a Polar Bear Skin, they are white in colour. You can get them from<br/>
Polar Bear Cubs as well. Give one skin and 5 plat to Karg, he will give you<br/>
a Cloak. Be SURE you hail Karg before turning in each plat/skin combo, as if<br/>
he starts moving during the trade you will lose your items.<br/>
<br/>
: and...does anyone know how much these skins/pelts go for if I were to go<br/>
: there and auction to buy them (save on hunting time).<br/>
<br/>
You can buy them from merchants (if someone has sold them) for less than 3<br/>
gp.<br/>
<br/>
: Well, not exactly...whenever they patch or server goes down for some<br/>
reason<br/>
: the merchant inventory is reset so all those bat wings get super glued<br/>
back<br/>
: onto rats to make more bats I guess.  Well, at anyrate I&#39;m guessing that<br/>
the<br/>
: selling bat wings would work right after a new patch and for a few days<br/>
: after that.<br/>
<br/>
The merchants I&#39;m referring to sell bat wings for 14 copper all the time,<br/>
they always have them in stock. </span></blockquote></div>
