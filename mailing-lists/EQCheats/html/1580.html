<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873852416">Hello all<br/>
<br/>
I have a question.  This poor warrior on the Prexus server<br/>
need to know where Milea Clothspinner ( the sister that starts<br/>
this quest is in Qyenos, you have to give this Milea a letter )<br/>
cave in East Karanas.<br/>
<br/>
And could you please tell me the best way to get there<br/>
from West Karanas.  I have died more times than I want<br/>
to say trying to get there.  I have hugged the coast but<br/>
every time I get to North Karanas Radiers near the coast <br/>
kill me.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
Ranala level 10 warrior who is wondering if she will ever<br/>
get to East Karanas in one piece.</div>
