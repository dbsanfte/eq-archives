 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what they said about UO. Look what happened there. Give it time, <br/>
someone&#39;s bound to hack it. All they&#39;ve managed to do is prolongue the <br/>
inevitable, because if it can be programmed, then someone can counterprogram <br/>
it. It&#39;s just a matter of time. And if you think patches will help, just <br/>
look at Diablo. It didn&#39;t stop them there. Personally, I hope nothing comes <br/>
of it.<br/>

Just my 2 coppers worth.</div>
