Must not have a Linux machine... or you&#39;d be using it<br/>
too eh?<br/>
Didn&#39;t have to fear that from myu friend. He only<br/>
played the regular old servers. No pvp. Oh... and if<br/>
you use Linux... there is no way they can tell if you<br/>
are using it... because that would require them to<br/>
look at your network... which is illegal. The only<br/>
people that have been caught were using the Windows<br/>
version (which is no more), or were stupid enough to<br/>
say something about it in game. So... don&#39;t expect too<br/>
many bans from it... but it does happen from time to<br/>
time... like with nmy friend who was cancelling his<br/>
account anyway and announced to the whole server that<br/>
he was using it. Hehehe. was funny actually.<br/>
