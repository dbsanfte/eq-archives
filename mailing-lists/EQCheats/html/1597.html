&gt; Hail and Well Met<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a new member to this list nd just wanted to say hello to <br/>
&gt; everyone. I hope to learn much from this list and gain <br/>
&gt; friendships from others on it. Perhaps even grouping with <br/>
&gt; some in the Future. I play on the a Paladin mainly myself but <br/>
&gt; am the Guildmaster of the new guild Family of Friends <br/>
 </span></blockquote><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/onlineguild/">http://www.geocities.com/onlineguild/</a> and make it my business to know about<br/>
all the different aspects of the game to help my fellow guildmates. Family<br/>
of Friends is currently recruiting and we have a membership application area<br/>
on our web site for potential recruits. Family of Friends resides on the<br/>
Bertoxxulous server. If nothing else there are two very useful links for<br/>
online gamers in general on our links page.<br/>
