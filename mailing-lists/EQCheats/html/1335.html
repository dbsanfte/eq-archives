<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736031342">Hmm, are you sure it was Varsoon the Undying and not just Varsoon?  I&#39;ve<br/>
only seen VtU once, he was blue to me and I was definately 35 at the time.<br/>
I know cause I had just trained disarm (which rangers don&#39;t get till 35) and<br/>
I was practicing it on skeletons outside Surefall.  I had all my int gear on<br/>
instead of normal combat gear and all my buffs had worn off, since I really<br/>
didn&#39;t need them against the skels.  When I went to check out Varsoon the<br/>
Undying, he spanked my ass good, let me tell ya.  I&#39;m guessing you saw plain<br/>
old Varsoon who was yellow to you at 20.  I&#39;ve never seen him in his normal<br/>
form.<br/>

&gt; At level 19 Varsoon the Undying was Yellow to me- so he is 20 or 20, but<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; went<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -- this would make him lvl 20-21... when was the last time you saw<br/>
&gt; something<br/>
&gt; that double hit for --70 damage that was lvl 20-21? and yes i know this<br/>
&gt; because he hit me for that much when i  was --lvl 31.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; on to take out me (ranger), a level 23 warrior with the Executioners Axe,<br/>
&gt; and a<br/>
&gt; level 23 Druid.  All were full health and all were full mana (even the<br/>
&gt; warrior!).<br/>
