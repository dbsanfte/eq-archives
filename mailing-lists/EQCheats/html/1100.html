<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386075429">This bring up something that I would love to see...if we all got our hands <br/>
on emulators and could submit quests that we have written on them to Verant <br/>
than maybe they would be implemented, or at least Verant might gain some <br/>
quest ideas they hadn&#39;t thought of before.<br/>
<br/>
No, it wouldn&#39;t be NEARLY as good as real server, but it might be cool to <br/>
give Verant some ideas how how the players would make EQ if they could <br/>
change the world around as they wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
that and maybe players could come up with their own spells, mobs, items, <br/>
zones, anything and submit them to Verant...I think it&#39;d be a great resource <br/>
for Verant to enhance the game.<br/>
