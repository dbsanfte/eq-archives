<b>Subject:</b> Mask of the deceiver <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016437068">I&#39;m a lvl 22 Cleric and would like to be heading to the LavaStorm Mtn&#39;s.  Now of course I know I can get an invis and make the run but I&#39;d kinda like to take the time to wonder around neriak and surrounding areas.  Since I killed DE Guards for bronze so often I&#39;m not KOS.  I&#39;m trying to locate the mask of deceivers which when worn and rt clicked will transform my appearance to that of a DE.  Does anyone know where I can locate such an iteM?<br/>
