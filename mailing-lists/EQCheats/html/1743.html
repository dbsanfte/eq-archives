<div id="ygrps-yiv-277653113">There have been hardly any votes on the poll for EQ hacks. I am <br/>
beginning to think you people don&#39;t care, I might as well just send <br/>
an email with the hacks to the only FOUR people who voted. C&#39;mon, I <br/>
have checked every day, and NO ONE votes. This group is for these <br/>
kinds of things, and well, no one wants them but 4 people. I expect <br/>
atleast 30 votes on the poll, or I will just email the hacks for EQ <br/>
to the people who want them. All the people who didn&#39;t vote then, if <br/>
there are less than 30, will not get these and will not have another <br/>
chance unless they look for a few hours on the internet finding them. <br/>
Sorry people, BUT THERE ARE ONLY 4 VOTES.</div>
