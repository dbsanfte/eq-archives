&gt;low quality in QH but that&#39;s it. Does anyone have any tips for me on where<br/>
&gt;it is best to get HQ bear pelts? I have killed countless bears for a very<br/>
&gt;long time and have only gotten my hands on 4 HQ bear pelts to work with.<br/>
&gt;And two of those I got lucky and found and bought from a store.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve gotten about 9 HQ bear pelts in my career (as loot, not bought).  ALL<br/>
except 2 of them i got from the little blackbears and young Kodiaks that<br/>
roam the  Misty Thicket.<br/>
One other i got from a black bear in West Commons and the other I got from a<br/>
grizzly bear (i think it was a grizzly...coulda been a smaller one) in West<br/>
karana.<br/>
<br/>
As i haven&#39;t exactly spent a HUGE amount of times going after bear pelts (I<br/>
mostly have tailored small sizes for newbies..i find the wee folk irrestibly<br/>
cute), i would think someone with the sole intent of getting HQ bear should<br/>
be able to do quite well going after them in Misty Thicket.  Figure about 1<br/>
or 2 per game day in Misty thicket if you go after all the little bears that<br/>
spawn there.   There&#39;s a time frame on Bear Spawns in Misty, so you will<br/>
have a good deal of downtime waiting for a game day to pass and a new spawn<br/>
come, but you are guaranteed to get the HQ pelts (unless I and a friend of<br/>
mine are just terribly luck).<br/>
