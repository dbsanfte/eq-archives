<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504659057"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I believe killing halflings in Nektulos forest raises Neriak<br/>
&gt; factions, just<br/>
&gt; look out for our guards!  When you zone in, follow the zone<br/>
&gt; wall to the left<br/>
&gt; and you&#39;ll run into they&#39;re camp.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only halflings that raise faction with Neriak guards are the Najena<br/>
injured halfling and Leatherfoot Raider halfling in Nek Forest and give caps<br/>
over to Neriak warrior guild person. Yes it does lower faction with<br/>
Halflings. The regular halflings in Nek forest gave me hits against all of<br/>
Rivervale but no good ones for Neriak.<br/>
<br/>
You can also go kill elf prisoners in Crushbone.<br/>
<br/>
You can also kill elf nobles in In. Swamp.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that raising faction with Indigo Brotherhood does NOT raise<br/>
faction with the merchants and other groups in Neriak. I have found no way<br/>
to do so and believe me I have looked...</div>
