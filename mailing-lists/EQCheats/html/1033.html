<b>Subject:</b> RE: possible big cheat for EQ.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836679445">As a programmer, I know the hazards associated with  third party <br/>
Programs fudging your data. The way EQ is set up, any<br/>
modifications you make are reflected in YOUR computer&#39;s memory, <br/>
and maybe even your display, but NOT on veran&#39;ts server. You <br/>
FEED commands to Verant, the actions are resolved on the server, <br/>
and the RESULTS are sent back to you. You may modify the commands<br/>
sent, or the results on your screen, and it won&#39;t change what <br/>
happens to your character on verants servers at all. It is a great<br/>
way to preclude tampering. You may change your screen to show<br/>
50000pp, but try to buy something.... The next screen update will<br/>
show your real totals... Your character and all interaction with it<br/>
are done BY Verant on their own servers. You have NO real contact with <br/>
anything that must be modified for any kind of cheat to work. <br/>
<br/>
I welcome any questions or comments....</div>
