<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195492926">Well, not exactly...whenever they patch or server goes down for some reason <br/>
the merchant inventory is reset so all those bat wings get super glued back <br/>
onto rats to make more bats I guess.  Well, at anyrate I&#39;m guessing that the <br/>
selling bat wings would work right after a new patch and for a few days <br/>
after that.<br/>

&gt;amounts in Kithicor and West Freeport (probably other zones as well, Ogguk<br/>
&gt;or Grobb almost ceratinly) for about 14 copper each. People are beginning <br/>
