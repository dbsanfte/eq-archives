<b>Subject:</b> Where to go at my level? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707572962">I was wondering if anyone could tell me where I should be hunting as a level 12 bard. Ever since level 8 I&#39;ve been in Steamfront killing skeles and clockworks. Now everything con&#39;s green (except for mino&#39;s, and they&#39;re usually heavily camped). Where should I be hunting now? Crushbone is way too overpopulated, on Tarew Marr at least. I just need somewhere to hunt until I hit 14 then I&#39;ll go to Unrest. Thanks for any help.<br/>
