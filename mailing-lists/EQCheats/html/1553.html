 A somewhat tedious but still lucrative method involves Polar Bear Cloaks.<br/>
 You can make these for 5 plat each in Everfrost, and they will sell for<br/>
 10-15 on Faydwer... possibly more these days.<br/>
 <br/>
 Involves travel and some work, but quite a lot of money can be made by doing<br/>
 this.<br/>
 <br/>
 Alternatively, you are close to Wisp time.... Greater Lightstones will get<br/>
 you almost ten plat each, and they aren&#39;t terribly hard to find. :)<br/>

to find these days as so many people are killing him (not like the old days <br/>
when you could always find him wandering around).<br/>
<br/>
Here is my newbie money raising secret.  Collect Batwings. Sell them in <br/>
batches of 20.  Many higher lvl Wizards will pay 10pp or more for a batch of <br/>
20 wings cause we don&#39;t want to bother hunting bats.</div>
