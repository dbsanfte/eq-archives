<div id="ygrps-yiv-269553758">I would ask this on the blacksmithing list but I think they are against <br/>
cheats over there, so here it goes. I was wondering how to raise <br/>
blacksmithing the fastest? I know it would take a lot of money, but as of <br/>
right now, I know of 3 people that can make banded. I am sure there is more, <br/>
but for an entire world, that is no good. Good for them, but not for everyone <br/>
else. I would like to become a good smith, and make banded. I have 24 in the <br/>
smithing skill now. I have tried just to keep making studs, as you still gain <br/>
skill for failing, but is there anything else that would raise it faster? Any <br/>
cheats as this is what this list is about?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
