 I quit a level 29 wizard to start a rogue back in July.  Never missed the <br/>
 wizard, not nearly as fun as the rogue.  Wizards just nuke and med... Kinda <br/>
 boring IMO, but, hey, that&#39;s what a wizard is.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry friend, but you are incredibly wrong.  A truly skilled Wizard is much <br/>
more than Nuke and Med.  I don&#39;t have time to debate you on this, let me just <br/>
paste below a post from a fellow Wizard from the Wizard Listserv - It is good <br/>
reading for anyone regardless of class.  The Nuances of playing a Wizard well <br/>
are beyond many, but they are vast and incredibly fun and challenging.<br/>

You know, folks, I&#39;ve spent my entire career as a wizard trying to prove<br/>
the KSing wizard stereotype wrong. Now I&#39;m faced every day with the whining<br/>
wizard stereotype. I am entirely happy with my level 47 wizard and have been<br/>
since I made him. Here&#39;s my take on a few issues.<br/>
<br/>
The people asking for the Staff of Temperate Flux to lower resistances by 60<br/>
instead of 6 do not have a grasp of reality. That would be unbalancing. We<br/>
are supposed to need a debuffer to be of maximum effectiveness. If you take<br/>
the time to do tests using the staff and not using the staff, you will see<br/>
the difference it makes. Using the staff won&#39;t reduce your chances of<br/>
resists to zero, but it does help. It&#39;s also useful for pulling without<br/>
doing damage so that it&#39;s easy for tanks to pull mobs off of you. (Yes,<br/>
wizards make great pullers in some circumstances.) Don&#39;t forget, you<br/>
personally have less resists just because you are a wizard.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never felt as powerful with my wizard as I did last night. I got a tell<br/>
from a guild member that Phinigel in Kedge had spawned. About 30 minutes<br/>
later, all the wizards and druids had delivered our 24-person multi-guild<br/>
raiding party outside Unrest and we grouped up. Within about an hour, we had<br/>
mowed through all the rares we could find, including Estrella, and I rarely<br/>
got more than one conflagration off before the mob was killed. The bulk of<br/>
the damage was being done by myself and the 5 other wizards in the raiding<br/>
party. My group was the only one with two wizards and we got the xp on over<br/>
half the kills. The things weren&#39;t living long enough for DoTs to work or<br/>
for the targets to seriously hurt anyone. When we got to Phinigel, we pulled<br/>
a few guardians and killed them, and then had a bad pull that pulled<br/>
Phinigel and 3 of his swirlspine guardians. The 3 enchanters proceeded to<br/>
mez the guardians and everyone targeted Phinigel. When Phinigel still had<br/>
about 2/3 of his hitpoints left, the shaman shouted &quot;Malise!&quot; and it was a<br/>
glorious sight to see all the wizards begin casting (along with a few other<br/>
wizard wannabes). I right-clicked the staff of temperate flux to mess him up<br/>
a bit more and chain-casted 7 conflagration spells, six of which hit for the<br/>
full 618 damage and one was partially resisted for 297 damage, before he was<br/>
dead. Keep in mind that I&#39;m only level 47 now, and how much more I could<br/>
have done at 50. All of the wizards had similar effects. That&#39;s 4005 damage<br/>
within a very small amount of time, and though I think I may have done the<br/>
most damage, I did not do so by much. No other class came close. Our ability<br/>
to kill such a major mob so fast enabled us to get to killing the guardians<br/>
one at a time before anything had a chance to go wrong with the mezzes.<br/>
<br/>
This power along with ports (and evacs), decent self-shields, roots, and a<br/>
few stuns, make me entirely happy with my class. The only thing I would love<br/>
to have is another stun spell, and I get one of those at level 49 (along<br/>
with ice comet, muhahaha).<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few tips for grouping:<br/>
---------------------------------<br/>
I always ask for cleric buffs in my party, and those who I have grouped with<br/>
before know why. If we get a bad pull, I can pull a mob immediately (not<br/>
have to try and try like a tank) with one nuke to drag it away from the<br/>
group and immobilize it so the party can go back and get it later.<br/>
Immobilize is faster (yes, enough to make a difference when you&#39;re getting<br/>
hit for double 100+) and has a harder save for the mob to make, and it<br/>
usually lasts quite a while if the mob&#39;s not getting hit. It&#39;s a poor<br/>
wizard&#39;s version of mez.<br/>
<br/>
If the tanks can&#39;t or don&#39;t get a mob off the cleric, you better do it. You<br/>
may die, but the cleric can rez you. If you don&#39;t, you&#39;re all gonna die. If<br/>
you do get the mob onto you, run it to the tanks and STOP so they can taunt<br/>
it off you. Don&#39;t run around like an idiot screaming, &quot;Help! Help!&quot; so that<br/>
they have to try to chase you.<br/>
<br/>
Use your stuns until burn time, and then drop the mob. Don&#39;t burn too early,<br/>
pulling the mob onto you from the tank, and then onto the cleric when he has<br/>
to heal your low-ac wizard arse. It amazes me how many 40+ wizards STILL<br/>
don&#39;t understand this.<br/>
<br/>
Make druids&#39; and rangers&#39; snare spell obsolete by doing your duty and timing<br/>
your spells well to drop the runner right as they turn to run.<br/>
<br/>
In dungeons and especially in Lower Guk, know your way around the place. If<br/>
the puller gets rooted and can&#39;t feign, you can go save his/her life with<br/>
one super-taunt nuke, or at least stun the target to give him/her a chance<br/>
to run back to the cleric.<br/>
<br/>
If it all goes wrong, evac the party to safety and try it again.<br/>
---------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
In short, ADAPT TO THE SITUATION. Don&#39;t get stuck into the rut of trying to<br/>
only be the master of direct damage. Be truly useful to your party. I<br/>
regularly get into groups that other wizards get turned away from because<br/>
the people know I work hard for the group and work well under pressure. If<br/>
all you do is stand up and cast one DD per mob and sit back down, then you<br/>
deserve to get turned away for groups. Any idiot can do that.<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t find a group (happens to everyone sometimes, not just wizards),<br/>
then solo. Anyone who has ever said wizards can&#39;t solo never really tried.<br/>
Even at level 47, I can still make a bubble every couple of hours soloing at<br/>
several places, and I don&#39;t even have jboots. One tip: the easiest xp mobs<br/>
are caster mobs. They have lower hitpoints (and therefore take less mana to<br/>
kill so you can kill more) as a general rule and you can OWN them if you use<br/>
a stun/dd/disrupt rotation.<br/>
<br/>
To sum this entire post up, don&#39;t whine about being weak. Learn how to be<br/>
strong. If something doesn&#39;t work, then try something else. The game is<br/>
supposed to be a challenge. Work on your skills (No, not the &quot;You have<br/>
become better at .......&quot; skills). If I could rule any mob in the game<br/>
without having to work for it, I&#39;d toss Everquest in the pile with the other<br/>
games I don&#39;t play anymore and go do something else.<br/>
