&gt;Getting thse things would be a result of hacking not twinking. the thorny<br/>
&gt;vine armor is plane of fear and i think no drop. the pegasus claok is no<br/>
&gt;drop too.<br/>

that I see way too many 1st lvl characters wearing all bronze and in a few <br/>
cases - steel chestplates!!!!!!!! Now if that isn&#39;t twinking - just shoot <br/>
me! It took me a month solid of 2 hrs plus a night of saving to get my steel <br/>
chestplate! I&#39;m just now crawling out of the hole I put myself into to get <br/>
it. It practically cost an arm and a leg &lt;checks himself to make sure he&#39;s <br/>
not missing vital organs/body parts&gt;</div>
