on you, which makes you feel like you are creeping, and i had jboots and it<br/>
was like i was 180/65 overweight. can&#39;t kite under those conditions<br/>

Varsoon was yellow to me at 24, so he was level 25 or 26 that time he<br/>
spawned.  He has a nasty DD spell that he likes to cast a lot, as well as a<br/>
couple of DoT&#39;s and a pet.  He hits for about 40, and drops jack.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is &quot;Varsoon the Undying&quot;, a zombie, that spawns when you kill<br/>
him.  Varsoon the Undying was level 30 (even con) when I killed Varsoon, and<br/>
he hits for 70 - 80, double.  I don&#39;t think he is a spell caster, so I guess<br/>
you could kite him it you are careful.  Just watch that you don&#39;t kite him<br/>
into the guards, some of whom will make short work of him.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to solo him, because you will probably be low mana and health<br/>
from killing Varsoon and getting hit with his DoT&#39;s.  I suggest a group<br/>
approach for this reason, or an agreement to the effect of, &quot;I&#39;ll kill<br/>
varsoon, you get his zombie&quot;, so you are full health and mana when you take<br/>
him on.<br/>
