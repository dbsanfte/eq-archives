<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329920578">Can find ores and clays (blocks, small and large) on Muddites in Beholder.<br/>
From what I&#39;ve seen, the Muddite Minors have clay alot of time (heavy...),<br/>
and I *think* the elders have ore on them at times. Don&#39;t smith so I never<br/>
paid attention, but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard.<br/>

profits are still to be had in some respects in certain skills - you<br/>
just<br/>
have to be willing to do a little work ... like getting your own ores<br/>
and<br/>
clays, and not buying them from the store.  That alone will save you a<br/>
lot<br/>
of money, not a lot of time, but a lot of money. :)<br/>
<br/>
Would someone please tell me where to find ore besides buying it?  I&#39;m a<br/>
17th level ranger so finding it on a rare 30th level spawn in the bottom<br/>
of some dungeon is pretty useless.  Nonetheless, where is it to be found<br/>
at all?<br/>
