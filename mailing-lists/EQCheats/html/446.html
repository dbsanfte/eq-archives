<b>Subject:</b> Gnoll city. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142885454">Ok, someone was telling me about a gnoll city and said it wasn&#39;t in Black <br/>
Burrow or Infected Paw, do any of you know where this city is, or any <br/>
information about it?<br/>
<br/>
Also if you know ways to raise faction with the gnolls in the city, and how <br/>
I can learn Gnoll (no one that I&#39;ve found has known it well enough to teach <br/>
me, one guy got me to Awful then had to camp out).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all,<br/>
Omeg</div>
