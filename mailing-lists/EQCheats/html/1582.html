&lt;&lt; And could you please tell me the best way to get there<br/>
 from West Karanas.  I have died more times than I want<br/>
 to say trying to get there.  I have hugged the coast but<br/>
 every time I get to North Karanas Radiers near the coast <br/>
 kill me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can easily get to East Karana by hugging the coast and then simply go <br/>
around the raiders and then back to the coast.  Just run along the high ridge <br/>
near the raiders and then when you are past - get back to the water.<br/>
<br/>
To be even safer.  Stop at the Wizard Spires at the first stone bridge and <br/>
get either a sow or Invisibility or even both.<br/>
