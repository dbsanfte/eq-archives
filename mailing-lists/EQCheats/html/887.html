<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665228447"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I have heard otherwise about anti camp code. The Ogre<br/>
&gt;Shadowknight is supposedly anti camp, it you are in<br/>
&gt;front of the spikes, he won&#39;t show.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely not true.  First of all, I think you mean the Troll Shadowknight<br/>
in Befallen, which has the BBC.  He spawns past some spikes on the 3rd<br/>
floor of befallen.  If you mean the Ogre, it&#39;s still not true.  I&#39;ve had<br/>
the TSK spawn right next to me, with the BBC in hand, at least 3 times.<br/>
I&#39;ve had the Ogre SK spawn on top of my head and drop the barbed armplates.<br/>
<br/>
So there is definitely no anticamp in Befallen.<br/>
