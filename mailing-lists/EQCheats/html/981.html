<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183723743">that glowing orb is most likely a Blackened Sapphire.   It gives a STA<br/>
bonus and provides light.  Maybe some other bonuses too, i dont remember<br/>
right now.<br/>

&gt; I am interested in finding the Orb or Teeshan. I have been told its on<br/>
&gt; Nafagen&#39;s corpse. Being that I am bearly reaching 20 , I won&#39;t be able to<br/>
&gt; accomplish this any time soon. I just want to know out of curiosity if this<br/>
&gt; is true.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, Where does one get the Shimmering orb ? I bought one from a auction<br/>
&gt; and am curious as to the origination of this item ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh yeah.. I saw this gnome with with a glowing orb of sorts on his<br/>
&gt; character.. He wouldn&#39;t let me look at it nor would he tell me its name.<br/>
&gt; Upon the 2 second glance in his inventorey look, it was a blue stone.. kina<br/>
&gt; like a jewel.. Anyone know what it is ?<br/>
