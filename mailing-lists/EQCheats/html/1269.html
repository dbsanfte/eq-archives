<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838049598">There was a post on this list awhile ago stating there<br/>
was a way to reduce the time required to get the<br/>
Knight to spawn. If someone has this information,<br/>
could they please post it? If you don&#39;t want to make<br/>
it public knowledge, could you send it to me? <br/>
