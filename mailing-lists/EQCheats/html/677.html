<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787331031">Has anyone found a merchant that charges more/less than what would be considered normal.  I noticed that one of the merchants in Qeynos will pay more for loot than any other.  I can buy water from any merchant (regards me kindly) and sell it to this merchant(regards me indiferent) and almost break even.  I haven&#39;t figured out exactly how much more he pays, but it is more than &quot;normal&quot;.  <br/>

Oh, its the guy near the docks inside the animal pen.  He sells compasses for 2.5 pp.</div>
