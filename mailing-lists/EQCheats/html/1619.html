<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724606321">You&#39;ll need at MINIMUM two enchanters to mez the Swirlspines. Going in<br/>
without enchanters to mez them, you&#39;ll all die or evac if you try to pull<br/>
Phin.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, two FULL SOLID groups should be able to do it, but it&#39;d be<br/>
rough I think. There are like 10 guardians aruodn him,l with like a 20<br/>
minute spawn time (this is last time I went on a raid, which was 1-2 months<br/>
ago). Level 47-49 warrior guardians, that summon.<br/>
<br/>
We got a buggy pull and pulled 5 guardians at once. We had 4+ full groups,<br/>
all 45+. Half of us died, other half evac&#39;d. We never even got close to<br/>
pulling Phin. I think you need to kill off a few guardians quick, then pull<br/>
Phin and friends, and mes all but Phin. I wouldn&#39;t try to charm a swirlspine<br/>
(don&#39;t think you can, too high level), but if you did, as soon as that charm<br/>
breaks, that enchanter is a dead person.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps, and let us know how it goes, and how you did what you did<br/>
(fail or succeed).<br/>

Hail friends,<br/>
<br/>
Tonight me some of my guildmates will attempt to take down Phinegal in KK.  <br/>
Anyone have any good advice or tips?<br/>
<br/>
The only specific question I have is, about how many 40 plus or 46 plus<br/>
folks <br/>
will be needed to take Phinegal down?<br/>
<br/>
Any other advice would be appreciated as well, I have only been as far as<br/>
the <br/>
SS Guards myself.<br/>
