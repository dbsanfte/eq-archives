<div id="ygrps-yiv-679750229">hi !<br/>
<br/>
I heard from some sources (not sure where since i already deleted the<br/>
mail) that<br/>
quests are able to be completed while under Invisibility .<br/>
<br/>
They stated examples by completing the Mystic Cloak quest<br/>
(8ac +5int +5sv magic 10 charges SteelSkin) .<br/>
<br/>
A few days later i attempted to try this out myself by camping<br/>
the Priest of Najena in Unrest . It was a 52 min spawn and more<br/>
often than not spawns a regular Ghoul as a placeholder (PH).<br/>
<br/>
After 16 long hours of waiting in line (only 2 spawned) and getting<br/>
the component off the Priest i made off to Najena to complete part<br/>
1 of the quest . unfortunately when i tried to give it to the NPC while<br/>
invis , it broke the invisibility and i was charmed and killed by the<br/>
NPC<br/>
(who is a High Elf Enchanter btw) .<br/>
<br/>
Has anybody else attempted to complete this quest ?<br/>
or does anyone have confirmation if quests can be completed<br/>
while invis ? pls email me directly as I dont always get the time<br/>
to read all this list mails...<br/>
<br/>
regards,<br/>
