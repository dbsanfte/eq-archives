<div id="ygrps-yiv-662996051">For you mid to low characters out there who want to gain equipment by dueling, here is a nice trick.  Have a high-level cleric friend <br/>
cast Symbol of Piznam or Symbol of Naltron before you duel your opponent.  As long as you two are equaly matched equipment wise, you will <br/>
easily win the duel.</div>
