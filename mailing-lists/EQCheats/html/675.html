<br/>
All of the poisons require vials.  The vials are made by persons skilled in the art of pottery.  Verant has seen fit NOT TO TELL ANYONE HOW TO MAKE THE FRICKING THINGS!  They said the vials were to be the item potters could sell in their &#39;player based&#39; economy.  So far ive seen numerous posts by people trying every different combination to make the stupid vials, and nobody has it yet.  So rejoice, poison is fixed! Good luck finding vials though.<br/>
