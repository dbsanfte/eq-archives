So I have to time when the ancient croc is gonna spawn and get up at 3am to kill him and hope he<br/>
has the leggings and not the sleves again every night (and hope I don&#39;t get up for nothing if<br/>
someone else timed it and gotten there before me, or a wiz just killsteals it from me)? Why do I<br/>
have to sit for 20 hours to get jboots with my lvl 35 char and get no experience at all? I pay to<br/>
play this game. I find most of it amusing and fun. I don&#39;t find the camping and the killstealing<br/>
that follows it hand in hand very amusing. Why can&#39;t I complain about an unwanted feature in a<br/>
product I pay for?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; this arguement though is just going to fall on deaf ears.. I for one can<br/>
&gt; time a lot of spawns great... late at night I can come on for say 2 hours<br/>
&gt; and totally rotate every npc spawn in for ex. upper guk (scyer, ancient<br/>
&gt; croc, warden, squire, giant spider) &lt;not the lord.. yet at least&gt;... and I<br/>
&gt; usually come away with at least one good item... now maybe I dont &quot;NEED&quot;<br/>
&gt; this item but I do get some mighty nice items which are then used to trade<br/>
&gt; for other stuff that I do need.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So this dumb arguement about 20 hours being required for every single nice<br/>
&gt; item is not a valid one.  Yes for ruby you usually do have to camp for hours<br/>
&gt; unless your lucky but I have known a few people to get their lucky breaks<br/>
&gt; (for ex. a friend of mine was camping the avatar of fear.. wasnt there for<br/>
&gt; more then 15min, the avatar spawned.. and he was carrying a Ruby BP).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, I think the point the guy was trying to make is &quot;have fun&quot; if your not<br/>
&gt; having fun then you shouldnt be playing? er better yet why are you playing<br/>
&gt; if your not overall having fun?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A sign of power in my book would be one that gets by without having to whine<br/>
&gt; 24/7...<br/>
&gt; =D<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ok lets get back on topic.. anyone know the ratio of times the Lord in upper<br/>
&gt; guk will be carrying the ghoulsbane as compared to the silvered bracer? heh<br/>
