<div id="ygrps-yiv-643177351">i know that Blackburrow is a cave type which makes it hard to map and to<br/>
learn without lots of travel and getting lost in it. Then there is the<br/>
Befallen type which to me is more like a underground house, making it to me<br/>
easier to learn and map.<br/>
What about the others? or is there any web sites with maps of these area&#39;s?<br/>
