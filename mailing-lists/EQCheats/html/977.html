<b>Subject:</b> RE: possible big cheat for EQ.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-906368550">I sure hope nothing comes of this.  I joined this list to get more hints<br/>
than cheats.<br/>
All the hacks and cheat programs RUINED Diablo and completely unbalanced UO.<br/>
I commend Verant for the foresight it took to make alt-tabbing almost<br/>
impossible to use while running EQ.<br/>
I hope Blizzard picks up on this before they release D2.<br/>
If you want a juiced up character learn to write your own code...and go play<br/>
Quake!<br/>
If you have to cheat to have fun, maybe you should work on improving your<br/>
playing skills instead, &#39;cause if you can&#39;t get good gear (and experience)<br/>
in this game without cheating you REALLY suck as a player.<br/>
Oh, FYI, I feel the same way about the places where you can get monsters<br/>
&#39;stuck&#39; and still cast at them...I think it&#39;s great that Verant bans people<br/>
that do that crap :)<br/>
On a more cordial note, any of you beta testing Asheron&#39;s Call?  I got my<br/>
invite last week put haven&#39;t played it yet.<br/>
Oh yeah - save your flames...these are just MY opinions, you&#39;re welcome to<br/>
your own :)<br/>
I KNOW this is a &#39;Cheats&#39; list, but 90% of the time its really a SPOILER<br/>
list, not a &#39;cheat&#39; list.<br/>
Don&#39;t forget to HAVE FUN!<br/>
Isn&#39;t that why you&#39;re PLAYING????<br/>

Ok, does anyone remember the days of Diablo where you&#39;d just Alt-Tab over to<br/>
<br/>
your cheat program?<br/>
<br/>
well, I was on ICQ the other day and I got a msg, and not thinking I <br/>
alt-tab&#39;ed once, nothing, twice and I was out of EQ.<br/>
<br/>
Now, my mouse was fairly locked up, but the key board still worked, I could <br/>
alt-tab between other programs.  (only had ICQ open)  when the CTRL-ALT-DEL <br/>
window came up (I pushed em) I could again use my mouse while it was up.<br/>
<br/>
when I tried to go back into EQ it didn&#39;t work, but it still takes time to <br/>
camp out your character eh? :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking this may be able to allow some cheat programs, but probably <br/>
not, everything seems to me server side except for hot keys.<br/>
<br/>
But, I am not a good enough programmer to write something that might be able<br/>
<br/>
to take advantage of this, nor do I know anyone who is.  If you are give <br/>
your input and see if anything works eh?  hehehe...if anyone does figure <br/>
something out they&#39;d be a god to EQ cheaters :)<br/>
<br/>
hope something comes of this,<br/>
