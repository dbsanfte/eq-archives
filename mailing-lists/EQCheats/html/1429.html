<div id="ygrps-yiv-225987892">Dear Sirs:<br/>
 <br/>
    We were killing guards inside Neriak&#39;s foreign quarters.  We play on the <br/>
Solusek Ro server.  I play as Keptin Pike.  We were harassed by players there <br/>
who were constantly dispelling us and dumping monsters (guards) on us. In <br/>
fact they even managed to dump guards on us where Neriak zones to Nektulos  <br/>
So we got trapped on both sides of the zone due to monster dumping.  Two of <br/>
us died. I would like to remind you that we were not killing any vendors or <br/>
quest related  NPCs.  Also, in the Foreign Quarter there is no danger to <br/>
newbies from anything.<br/>
  GM Hidaeki said this was perfectly legal since they were role-playing.  <br/>
Hmm, I  imagine I can do a lot of harassing and exploiting under the guise of <br/>
role-playing.  I asked about the exploit of PVP Switch Avoidance and he <br/>
ignored me.  I have posted said exploit below as  posted on your site.<br/>
<br/>
PvP Switch Avoidance ï¿½ using in-game methods to work around the PvP switch <br/>
and allowing non-PvP players to kill other players, such as hall blocking, <br/>
dumping of monsters, or spell effects that cross that boundary due to a bug. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me if those players who were killing us fall under this exploit <br/>
and can be given an official warning.</div>
