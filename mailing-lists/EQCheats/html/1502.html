<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452032583">if the items are lore and no drop then verant should be able to let the<br/>
spawn rate be a little quicker than it has been with item drops being not as<br/>
rare as they are now.<br/>

I&#39;m pretty sure that all classes will have new armor in the game.  While not<br/>
all<br/>
of it will come from quests in the Temple of Solusek Ro, most of the armor<br/>
will.<br/>
There will be SK armor, it has a black plate apperance (nice), ranger is<br/>
green<br/>
chain, cleric gold plate, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The possible problem that may arise, if the do these quests like they<br/>
&quot;fixed&quot;<br/>
several of the other quests, is that if ANY of these quests rely on one<br/>
static<br/>
spawn that you have to kill.  Often times these spawns are 6-8 hours apart,<br/>
are<br/>
heavily camped, etc.  Anyone seen how badly Befallen and Kerra Isle are<br/>
camped<br/>
(almost 24/7) now that the Paw of Opella information has become known?  The<br/>
Testiment is even worse.<br/>
<br/>
If these quests require one static spawn that has the necessary item rare or<br/>
a<br/>
long spawn time, it&#39;s another useless quest IMO.  I would much rather<br/>
continue<br/>
to get experience and fight in places that are challenging, instead of<br/>
sitting<br/>
on a static spawn for hours to get an item.  I&#39;d love to have the best<br/>
equipment<br/>
in the game, but not at the expense of my enjoyment.  I have a hard enough<br/>
time<br/>
to put 3-4 hours together on a week night, let alone some of the 16 hours<br/>
people<br/>
have camped for the rings from Mitty (Paw quest).  My worst horror story is<br/>
12<br/>
hours for JBoot, but at least I was getting experience at the time.<br/>
<br/>
If camping is what is required (even though it&#39;s now a &quot;quest&quot;), I really<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
see this as any improvement to the game.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this will not be the case with these new quests.<br/>
