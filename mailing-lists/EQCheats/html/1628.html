 </span></blockquote>Yes I heard of it. And, I have seen it in use. It<br/>
displays all zone info complete with mobs... mob<br/>
names... their level... their hit points... what they<br/>
are carrying.... your amount of experience you are<br/>
getting for each kill.... your percentage of<br/>
experience towards your next level.. even PC&#39;s and<br/>
their pets. You simply click on the mob you wish to<br/>
attack and a line is drawn on the show EQ map from<br/>
your position to the mab and you simply folllow the<br/>
line. They did have a Windows version available taht<br/>
would run in the background of Everquest. But,<br/>
everyone was getting busted with it. And, you CAN get<br/>
busted with the Linux one too. My friend did. So use<br/>
at your own risk.<br/>
