<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145695419">Ah.. I still play DR now.. I have only been in the realms for about a year<br/>
and a half... and It is going down hill very fast.. Its just to the point<br/>
where it is so boring now.. they did all these changes that just hurt the<br/>
game.. Hopefully EQ doesnt do that.. I dont know if ya ever knew me but I<br/>

&gt; I played Hawkford Aspenglen two and a half years.  The last year Hawk<br/>
&gt; was married to Damaria, the empath.  I gave Hawk and my cleric, Nirin,<br/>
&gt; to Erefayna&#39;s player and she&#39;s having fun with them now.<br/>
