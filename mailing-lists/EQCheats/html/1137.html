The Langseax:  This is the quest to obtain the Langseax.  Complete Version: <br/>
Go to Renth McLanis in the tavern across from Mac&#39;s Kilts.  Ask him &quot;What <br/>
dangerous matter?&quot;.  He tells you of a crime.  Agree to hunt the murderer.  <br/>
Renth then sends you to see Dok in Dok&#39;s Cigars.  Find out all you can about <br/>
the crime.  He tells you to go see the leader of Clan McMannus.  This is the <br/>
fishing village located in West Karanas.  Speak to the leader.  Then speak <br/>
to Ulrich McMannus and he tells you Frostbite can track prey if he has a <br/>
piece of sweaty clothing. Return to Dok and ask him &quot;Where is the sweaty <br/>
shirt?&quot;.  He then tells you he sold it to Tundra Jack.  Find Tundra Jack on <br/>
the tundra of Everfrost.  He will tell you that Iceberg is using it for a <br/>
collar and that you can distract Iceberg with his favorite meal, Lion <br/>
Delight.  Go back to Halas and speak to Teria O&#39; Danos.  Do the lion<br/>
meat quest (you get coin and faction as well as the Lion Delight).  Once you <br/>
have Lion Delight, be sure to bury it lower in your container then your <br/>
normal food to prevent it being eaten by you.  Take the Lion Delight to <br/>
Iceberg and receive the shirt (NO DROP, LORE ITEM) and faction adjustment.  <br/>
Now run to the village and give the shirt to Frostbite. (NOTE: Frostbite <br/>
will wait for the murderer to spawn before he takes off.  He walks pretty <br/>
fast so<br/>
having Spirit of Wolf on you would help.  It also helps to have a party <br/>
member along that can track because I lost sight of Frostbite many times and <br/>
have had to start over.  Also, Frostbite likes to fight things along the <br/>
way. Help him out.  Be very careful not to target Frostbite by accident!) <br/>
Frostbite will lead you right to the criminal. The murderer will be either <br/>
Paglan or Basil.  Paglan is level 21, Basil is level 20.  Kill whoever the <br/>
dog leads you to, and hope he drops a Barbarian head and then return to <br/>
Halas with the head. Give the head to Renth for faction, coin, and of <br/>
course, Langseax.    Short Version:  Run to village, and receive the lion <br/>
meat.  Run to Halas, turn in meat to Teria and get Lion Delight, faction, <br/>
exp. and coin. Run to Iceberg, give Lion Delight, receive shirt, faction, <br/>
exp. Run to Frosbite, give shirt, gain exp. Kill the criminal. Return head <br/>
for faction, coin, exp and Langseax.  (Submitted by Joril Stoutbear, Waladen <br/>
