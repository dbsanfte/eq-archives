&gt;a month of attempting it another group had an everquest *SERVER* &gt;emulator <br/>
&gt;that was able to have a client walk around the world and see &gt;monsters that <br/>
&gt;they spawned.  Surely you don&#39;t think they had time to &gt;break ANY encoding <br/>
&gt;and *STILL* be able to analyize the protocol to &gt;the point of having a <br/>
&gt;working server do you? </span></blockquote></div>
