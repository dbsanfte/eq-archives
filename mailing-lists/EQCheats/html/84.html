<b>Subject:</b> SPOILER: Quest Information Requested <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-711578277">I have been doing the Potion of Marr quest found in the Temple of Marr in<br/>
Freeport. I am on the last sentry, who I find out is shipwrecked somewhere<br/>
out in the Ocean of Tears. Does someone have a location for poor Sentry<br/>
Xyrin? A good description of how to find her from the Sisterhood Island<br/>
docks or a /loc would be greatly appreciated. I have spent FAR too much time<br/>
in a rowboat as it is...<br/>
