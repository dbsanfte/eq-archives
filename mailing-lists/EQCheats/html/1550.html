<b>Subject:</b> Making Plat <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632305350">Ok, anyone have any ways to make plat with some amount of speed?  I&#39;m a <br/>
level 7(almost 8) Erudite Mage saving for a large item (Flowing Black Robe, <br/>
and other expensive stuff).  I have about 70 Plat so far and was wondering <br/>
if anyone had a way of making plat other than &quot;have your high lvl get it <br/>
then...&quot; b/c I don&#39;t have any high levels on this server :).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Omeg</div>
