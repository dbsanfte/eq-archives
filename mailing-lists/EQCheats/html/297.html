<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074562202">Personally, I would like to see a site database that I can query to it. I<br/>
want to be able to see what a Paladin can carry.  Don&#39;t really care what an<br/>
Monk can carry.  Just basically filter the data a bit more. (OK, wish list)<br/>
I would like to be able to sort the data by ac, weight, damage, range, ...<br/>
maybe special ability (not sure how this would be done, alphabetical?).  I<br/>
would like to see even the basic items listed LIKE BANDED.  I don&#39;t know how<br/>
many sites I have gone to and not seen banded listed, which tells me the<br/>
site is a joke, because they only list &quot;special&quot; items and/or items in the<br/>
book, which I already have.<br/>
<br/>
I do like having the spoiler listed on a different page, or farther down the<br/>
page (if done you should have a big graphic &quot;SPOILER&quot; so people who don&#39;t<br/>
want it).  Just note I run with a 1600x1200 resolution so put it far down<br/>
the page (I know lucky me, but you stare at a computer screen for 8 to 10<br/>
hours a day and then go home an play EQ for another 3 to 5 hours)<br/>
<br/>
OH, one other thing since it is listed, Race, like to be able to say I was a<br/>
large paladin, again don&#39;t care for the stuff I can&#39;t use because of my<br/>
race.<br/>
<br/>
And yes I would do this but don&#39;t have a database available to me that<br/>
people could query to, and don&#39;t have a server I can put the data on.  I<br/>
would be willing to help (stress help) with the database and development of<br/>
the web pages, but I don&#39;t have those tools available to me.<br/>

its a good idea if it is carried through... so far i have yet to see a site<br/>
that really does that. No one takes the time to actually build a database of<br/>
stuff most rely on volunteer submissions wh8ich sucks because you dont get a<br/>
good response that way. Whoever runs a site needs to go out and do most of<br/>
the research and keep it up with all of the current patches once again I<br/>
have not yet seen this...<br/>
