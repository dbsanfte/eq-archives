<div id="ygrps-yiv-316521945">I do know for sure it is a Paladin only sword.  Each class will have its<br/>
own super weapon.  The fiery avenger is the super weapon for paladins. <br/>
If you don&#39;t believe post on any widely known messageboard about it<br/>
being a paladin only sword.  As far as the other classes super weapons,<br/>
I don&#39;t know those.  I received the info about all classes having a<br/>
super weapon off a lvl 48 group of 5 people.  The Oaken scimitar is the<br/>
druid&#39;s super weapon.  The rest remain unknown as far as i know.  As for<br/>
there being only one fiery avenger per server..  that was heresay and I<br/>
am ashamed that i repeated it.  Everything else is fact to my<br/>
knowledge.  BTW..  if you ever wondered where to find Aradune and the<br/>
rest of his crew, Veeshan is the developers playground.  This doesn&#39;t<br/>
surprise me seeing as they are the only server to have slain Lady Vox so<br/>
far.  Talk to some of the high lvl people on your servers.  You&#39;ll find<br/>
out some very interesting stuff.</div>
