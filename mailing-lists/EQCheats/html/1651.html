<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045723475">I appoligize if what I did seemed underhanded.  I didn&#39;t mean for it <br/>
to be.  I figured that I would offer cheats and hacking info every <br/>
few days and post my website if anyone would be interested in <br/>
purchasing all the cheats right away.<br/>
<br/>
I though it would be nice if I posted some cheats along with my <br/>
website so that I wouldn&#39;t just be advertising my guide.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I appologize if I&#39;ve offended anyone<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt; Incredible, why didn&#39;t you just say I&#39;m selling a cheat book, go to <br/>
my web<br/>
&gt; page to buy it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I actually might have purchased your book and info if you had of <br/>
been honest<br/>
&gt; in your approach.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I started a website devoted to cheats and hacking in <br/>
everquest...I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; post a few over the next few days and see how you like them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My website is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquestbugs.com">http://www.everquestbugs.com</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s a grouping bug that lets a 7th member in your group<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This 7th member won&#39;t be able to talk in the group but I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; told that<br/>
&gt; he will able to read what the other member in the group say.  This<br/>
&gt; 7th member will not sure up on the grouping list. Also this 7th<br/>
&gt; member will gain exp as if he were in the group.  I have no tried<br/>
&gt; this bug so I can&#39;t verify that it works but here it goes:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you have 6 people in a group have one of them disband and<br/>
&gt; then reinvite him,.then invite the 7th person and have them join<br/>
&gt; in a<br/>
&gt; certain order (not sure what order so you might have to play around<br/>
&gt; with this one).  This bug was submitted by a member of my website <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; he himself said that he was in a group with 7 people because at one<br/>
&gt; point the 7th person went link dead and it told the group the he <br/>
went<br/>
&gt; linkdead.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks and let me know if you want more cheats or you can just go to<br/>
&gt; my website,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
