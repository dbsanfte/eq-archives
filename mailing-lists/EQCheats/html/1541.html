<b>Subject:</b> Shadow silk armor? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845223971">Hello all,<br/>
    I was reading about this shadow armor stuff.  i believe i read that it<br/>
is.   1 shadow wolf pelt, 1 silk swatch, and 1 gather shadows scroll (an<br/>
extra one to make inkie shadow silk)      has anyone tried this?  it didn&#39;t<br/>
say anything about patterns or different quantities.  so i was wondering<br/>
about the amount of silk.  is it like making raw silk armor (ie: 2 silk for<br/>
tunic, 1 for gorget?)  or does this all combine to make like a shadow silk<br/>
swatch or sumthin.<br/>
<br/>
thanx in advance<br/>
<br/>
Jim</div>
