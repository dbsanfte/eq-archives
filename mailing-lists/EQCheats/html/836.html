<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692086520">Yup, The post was beyond correct. They con red to level 23&#39;s and I was <br/>
fighting them in a group of 19-23. They flood the South Ro zone line and <br/>
even with 4-5 parties, thier are PLENTY to go around. The only drawback is <br/>
that they have no loot. That is why I think Verant will let is slide. They <br/>
are like the crocs for levels 19-25 I figure and they help pull some of the <br/>
load off the loot zones. Why anyone would complain about them is beyond me. <br/>
Its not like they are one hit kills, they do have alot of HP&#39;s and a foolish <br/>
party can fall to them easily, they do group up when they see their own <br/>
being attacked. I think alot of attention hasn&#39;t been put towards them <br/>
becuase most people near or at 20 run straight to unrest on the other side <br/>
of the world. Well, Anyway check it out and grap whatever exp you can, if <br/>
the idiots of the game keeo public posting complaints i am sure they will <br/>
disapear as quickly as the appeared.<br/>
