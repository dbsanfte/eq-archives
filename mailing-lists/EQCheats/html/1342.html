<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019955405">Who has actually DONE the Crafted Greaves quest? I&#39;ve heard different<br/>
stories on what item you need. Some say the Silver Circlet off Drelzna, some<br/>
say a circlet off Najena, and some say one off Trazdon. <br/>
<br/>
I killed Trazdon in Najena last night at got a Dark Circlet (LORE NO DROP<br/>
MAGIC ITEM) Necro Only, AC 4, -2 CHA, +4 INT. Is this the correct item<br/>
(please only if you have 1st hand knowledge...) It could be a Circlet from<br/>
any of them could work....but I dont&#39; wanna take the chance as there is a<br/>
couple hours of work (plus two deaths...growl...I hadden&#39;t died in 6 ot 7<br/>
levels) and 140pp in rubies at stake...heh.<br/>
<br/>
And if this ISN&#39;T the correct circlet, what&#39;s this head peice worth?<br/>
*chuckle*<br/>
Thanks.</div>
