<b>Subject:</b> Re: Stein from Ogres <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-799173871">Someone suggested getting a thief to steal the stein from the ogre guards. <br/>
Has anyone tried this yet and managed to get one? I&#39;d take on the guards <br/>
myself, but I don&#39;t feel like screwing up my faction with the ogres - <br/>
they&#39;re the only ones I know of with certain molds that I need for my <br/>
blacksmithing. I&#39;d buy a stein, (on Bertox) but everyone wants an outrageous <br/>
amount for one (they usually want enough cash to buy a rubicite chestplate <br/>
and a GZ). I know the stein is a pretty good item, but isn&#39;t that a little <br/>
much for it? Let&#39;s be a little realistic here now - I want one, but that&#39;s a <br/>
tad bit much for it!</div>
