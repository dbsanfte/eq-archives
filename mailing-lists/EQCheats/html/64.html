<div id="ygrps-yiv-100151823">Ok first of all i have been in EQ since phase 1 beta and i&#39;ve never had a problem with the binding issue.. If you didnt notice the spell bind takes a considerable amount of time to cast and you could most likely flee far enough away to counter it... Of course if your that paranoid about it happening then you may have other under lying problems +AD0-) And even if it was to happen, its most likely not life threatening... <br/>
Concering the Casting invis on a pet, the pevious post was correct it is a bannable offence and largely looked down upon...<br/>

+AD4APg- Grouping with someone was my way to get to know them...<br/>

That works for levels under 12, hehe. After that they can mess you up<br/>
with Affinity Bind. Only of course if you go into a city with them.<br/>
