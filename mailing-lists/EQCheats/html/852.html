Here&#39;s what Brian said about that particular episode:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...And here&#39;s the point where I get miffed: if a GM is killed in an event,<br/>
&quot;ninja looting&quot; can happen since ANYONE can loot the corpse, not the<br/>
person/party responsible for most damage.  A 50th wizard looted my corpse<br/>
and got ALL the rubi, then said he didn&#39;t find anything.  In addition, he<br/>
didn&#39;t distribute it to anyone else that was in the battle -- he kept it for<br/>
his guild (presumably).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This really upset me, but because of a error on my part the two rubi<br/>
bracers<br/>
that were dropped were in a backpack and couldn&#39;t be looted (except by me).<br/>
I then looted my corpse and awarded the bracers to a 42nd level wizzie that<br/>
played smart, fierce, and was RP the whole way.  I&#39;m still upset that the<br/>
50th wizzie didn&#39;t share the loot with the tanks that were there.&quot;<br/>

Speaking of GM organized events....the other day on my server (Xegony) a GM<br/>
took over the Tae Archeon in Cazic Thule.....he was a lvl 50 Wizard and was<br/>
casting Ice Comet.....he killed everybody...no one lost any exp though which<br/>
was cool....the GM did finally fall to a Lvl 50 Mage named Hast who hangs<br/>
out in CT actually helping people!!! That&#39;s right a lvl 50 who helps<br/>
people.....anyways  Hast told me he got a FULL set of rubicite armor and a<br/>
shiny mettalic robe off the GM controlled Tae Archeon.....WOW is all I could<br/>
say<br/>

		They are gone now. Apparently, the EXP was TOO easy. They<br/>
were only hitting<br/>
		for 40 if that, and I could actually see my experience bar<br/>
moving in level<br/>
		30 (which is sometimes impossible to see since its a barrier<br/>
level).<br/>
<br/>
		Alas, I went back to Oasis AND Lake Rathe, and the doggies<br/>
are now gone.<br/>

		I just saw a post on one of the Stratics boards concerning<br/>
an over-run of<br/>
		Aqua Goblin Pets in Oasis....apparently the wolves are all<br/>
over the place<br/>
		for the last few days and giving very easy EXP.<br/>
		Anybody have any info on this to share???<br/>
