Agree with almost all of this+ACE- The vendor (named Aviak at the very top of<br/>
the village) won&#39;t sell to Barbarians either, tried last night. Other thing,<br/>
SOME of the aviaks (I think egrets, the lowest ones, maybe some others) can<br/>
keep up with SOW. I think it&#39;s only egrets, unless they changed it in the<br/>
last couple of months.<br/>

Between lvl 20 and 30 as a wizard my main +ACI-kiting grounds+ACI- were around tha<br/>
Aviak village in South Karana.. that is absolutly a kiters heaven... YES<br/>
wizards CAN kite+ACEAIQAh- There are on average 10 to 15 plus druid and/or shamans<br/>
in the area at any given time. And it is quite easy to have a constant<br/>
sow...  Playing there was amazingly great.. Even when there were 40 plus ppl<br/>
in the zone i didnt have much trouble gaining xp fast. And the loot is<br/>
great. When high enough to kill avocets, the hardest aviaks there... you get<br/>
great loot, they sometimes drop black pearls worth 50 plus pp to other<br/>
players. and other assorted jewels that sell for 10 to 15 pp at a npc. And<br/>
the zone rathe zone is near incase of trouble. There is even an aviak<br/>
merchant that will sell to some ppl. I know it wont sell to gnomes.. dont<br/>
know what other races it dislikes though. And best of all, aviaks have NO<br/>
FACTION hits+ACE- And for those new to kiting, dont be afraid to try to kite a<br/>
yellow or red... If you smack it and it turns out it resists to much just<br/>
hit the zone, and you&#39;ll know from then on... If not, then rack in the xp+ACE-<br/>

+AD4APg-Shaman&#39;s are the best kiters right?  B/c they get SoW at 9th, and Druids <br/>
+AD4APg-don&#39;t get it till 14th...or are the Druid DOTs that much better?<br/>
+AD4APg-<br/>
+AD4APg-hmmm...maybe I will stick with the shaman :).<br/>
