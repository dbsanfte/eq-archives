<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949550075">It&#39;s just a minor thing, but there&#39;s a skeleton standing in the teleport/pot<br/>
room of Timorous Deep. It can be cast upon, and you can gain skill casting<br/>
upon it, and you can &quot;tap&quot; it for hit points, AC, attack, and whatever else<br/>
you like, if you&#39;re of the classes who do that sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
But it never fights back, and never dies.<br/>
<br/>
My necro is bound in the pot room, so she can teleport everywhere. I raised<br/>
her Evocation skill (which was horrible) by going there and casting Ward<br/>
Undead on the skeleton repeatedly, medding in between. When I need to heal,<br/>
and am near a city where the pots go, I gate back and do a Leach and life<br/>
taps on it, as well as one of the hp-mana spells on myself. I leave fully<br/>
healthy and charged with mana.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of raising your casting skills, remember to ALWAYS practice away all<br/>
your mana right before a rez. When you&#39;re rezzed, you LOSE all your mana, so<br/>
mem that one spell you have in the category where your skill is still like<br/>
10, and cast it until you use up your mana, while waiting for a rez.<br/>
