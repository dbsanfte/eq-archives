<b>Subject:</b> Re: possible big cheat for EQ.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005516812">I did not say that I had to cheat to have fun with EQ.  I have lots of fun <br/>
and haven&#39;t taken advantage of any of the &quot;cheats&quot; that this list has <br/>
provided.  I use the guest info, but I don&#39;t trap monsters or anything.  <br/>
From Diablo I was one of the ppl that made it to level 50 with no cheats, <br/>
and only items that I found so I knew they were legit.  I also had a <br/>
hacked-to-heck character on Diablo b/c sometimes I think it&#39;s fun to run <br/>
around and kill anything ya darn well please.<br/>
<br/>
if I had to cheat to have fun I wouldn&#39;t play EQ.<br/>
