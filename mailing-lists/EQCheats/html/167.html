<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151111978">It is found in High Hold Pass on a Named Gnoll (Vexven Mucktail) not the <br/>
Polished Granite Tomahawk also Spawns in this area on a Gnoll Named Grenix <br/>
Mucktail but are Rare and Over camped (ok ok im guilty for having done it in <br/>
the past but have long stopped) at lvl 20 it was still a hard solo Battle <br/>
for a well equiped paladin (Vexven not as bad but Grenix and that Damn tommy <br/>
of his...) Im not sure how the spawn works some say you get one or the other <br/>
at random and one every 3 hours BUT i was there one day fro like 8 hours abd <br/>
only saw one Vexven and not grenix UNTILL i tried to Log kind of funny but <br/>
grenix spawned on me and we fought for 10 minute each having a tommy that <br/>
kept going off finally i killed him and i tried to log as i was resting and <br/>
lo and behold Vexven spawned on me again but i killed him with a little help <br/>
pretty quick...<br/>
