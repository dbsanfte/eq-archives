Subject: [EQCheats] Everquest Cheats over 30 of them<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I started a website devoted to cheats and hacking in everquest...I&#39;ll<br/>
post a few over the next few days and see how you like them.<br/>
<br/>
My website is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquestbugs.com">http://www.everquestbugs.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a grouping bug that lets a 7th member in your group<br/>
<br/>
This 7th member won&#39;t be able to talk in the group but I&#39;m<br/>
told that<br/>
he will able to read what the other member in the group say.  This<br/>
7th member will not sure up on the grouping list. Also this 7th<br/>
member will gain exp as if he were in the group.  I have no tried<br/>
this bug so I can&#39;t verify that it works but here it goes:<br/>
<br/>
If you have 6 people in a group have one of them disband and<br/>
then reinvite him,.then invite the 7th person and have them join<br/>
in a<br/>
certain order (not sure what order so you might have to play around<br/>
with this one).  This bug was submitted by a member of my website and<br/>
he himself said that he was in a group with 7 people because at one<br/>
point the 7th person went link dead and it told the group the he went<br/>
linkdead.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and let me know if you want more cheats or you can just go to<br/>
my website,<br/>
