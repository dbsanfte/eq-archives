&gt; Congrats to you sir, this is the first time i have ever seen <br/>
&gt; any kind of <br/>
&gt; useful info on this sight. Hopefully we will all follow your <br/>
&gt; lead. If i find <br/>
&gt; out any info on your bags Ill be sure to post it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes congrats, good info my frined. I have a nice quest for you all gang. Go<br/>
kill Trumpy IronToe in South Qeynos and Bring his head to an NPC in Kaladim,<br/>
i can`t remember his first name, something BloodForge and he`ll gave you a<br/>
BloodForge Hammer. 2H blunt magic +10 resist magic, 13 dam 50 del and light.<br/>
A good hammer. Take a note that you need to have a good faction with him if<br/>
you want to have the hammer.<br/>
<br/>
The only problem is that if you kill Trumpy this will ruined your faction<br/>
with QeynosCorruptGuard =(( I`m now KOS with them.<br/>
<br/>
If someone have an idea where I can raise my faction with them please let me<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
