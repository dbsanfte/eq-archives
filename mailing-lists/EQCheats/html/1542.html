<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542526024">I agree, however was being quiet as I figured I&#39;d just get flamed if I said <br/>
anything, oh well, been flamed before :).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I believe he was thinking the Reaver of the Dead.  Dark Reaver is dropped <br/>
&gt;by the<br/>
&gt;Cav, Reaver of the Dead is a quest (I think SK and Necro only).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The fact that he didn&#39;t know, got confused or anything else doesn&#39;t make <br/>
&gt;him a<br/>
&gt;retard.  I&#39;m getting upset that people keep flaming others to boost their <br/>
&gt;own<br/>
&gt;ego.  It&#39;s not like most of us haven&#39;t posted incorrect or incomplete<br/>
&gt;information before. </span></blockquote></div>
