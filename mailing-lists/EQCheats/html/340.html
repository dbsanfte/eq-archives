<div id="ygrps-yiv-172425618">Just a side note on that: the ring can be recharged at any cleric guild.. I&#39;ve recharged it in Ak&#39;anon and Freeport before.. But i do agree, the ring isnt very useful, not as good as it was in beta anyway.<br/>

Ok..  first off.. I&#39;m very picky about the name of the town.  Rivervale<br/>
not riverdale.  Hehe..  just one of those little things that ticks me<br/>
off.  Next..  the squad ring is useless once you leave the zones<br/>
surrounding rivervale.  It still works but with only one charge it&#39;s not<br/>
very economical to run back to vale everytime to get it recharged.  Kill<br/>
mooto more to get the ring.  He gives the most faction.  Nillipuss is<br/>
about lvl 17.<br/>
