<div id="ygrps-yiv-811759074">Yes, any eye will drop them, many people say that the Lords have a higher drop rate, however this is untrue based on my exp... In fact ive obtained more PBB&#39;s off regulare evil eyes then lords. And btw, that is quite rare... Ive soloed the EE&#39;s in the gorge for 30 hr periods... and gotten two or three PBB&#39;s in one session... Once i even got 3 in a row off the same spawn... If you were fighting with a party when you kept track of these &#39;80 kills&#39; perhapes you should consider the possibility that your party members werent all honest about there loots smile, if not... then you just have bad luck :( And a side note: Evil eyes also drop polished bone hoops for those who dont know... of course not as good as PBB&#39;s but they are a fair item for a lvl 17 and up, untill you get something better... plus 10 mana each, i know it doesnt seem like much and with the twinking standards now days you could probably get much better, but in the long run with two, it isnt bad... sorry for the long post- <br/>

It&#39;s a random drop from any evil eye, as far as I&#39;m aware. I got one from<br/>
East Karana, and one in the gorge.  FYI, I actually kept track of the total<br/>
and I had to kill over 80 eyes to get a pair of the PBB&#39;s.  I&#39;m told this is<br/>
extraordinarily bad luck...<br/>

About this, is the PBB on one specific eye or is it on any eye in the area<br/>
(gorge/EK)?<br/>

When fighting evil eyes in the gorge the other night, I hit the sit button<br/>
while charmed somehow. The result was canceling the charm, which allowed me<br/>
to continue with my battle. I managed to do this repeatedly throughout the<br/>
night. This could be a coincidence or an actual bug in the game, I&#39;m not<br/>
sure. Since I felt it was cheating, I quit doing it and left the gorge+ADs-<br/>
after all, I only wanted another Polished Bone Bracer +ADs-)<br/>
