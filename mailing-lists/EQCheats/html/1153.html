<div id="ygrps-yiv-936924633">Does anyone know if there is a onelist for wizards? I have tried to find <br/>
one in the onelist directory but to no avail.  I will admit however that I <br/>
get messed up looking thru it.  So if someone could give me the address of <br/>
the onelist list for wizards (if there is one) I would appreciate it.</div>
