<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549370322">Havent read through all my email so I dont know if someone already replied, but the amount a vendor will pay you or charge you depends on your faction.  Although they can be lumped together as indifferent, some either like you more in that scale or just pay more(for instance the Innkeeper in the Commons and not the people on the sides).<br/>

    Has anyone found a merchant that charges more/less than what would be considered normal.  I noticed that one of the merchants in Qeynos will pay more for loot than any other.  I can buy water from any merchant (regards me kindly) and sell it to this merchant(regards me indiferent) and almost break even.  I haven&#39;t figured out exactly how much more he pays, but it is more than &quot;normal&quot;.  <br/>

    Oh, its the guy near the docks inside the animal pen.  He sells compasses for 2.5 pp.</div>
