&gt; &gt; As a programmer, I know the hazards associated with  third party<br/>
&gt; &gt; Programs fudging your data. The way EQ is set up, any<br/>
&gt; &gt; modifications you make are reflected in YOUR computer&#39;s memory,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and maybe even your display, but NOT on veran&#39;ts server. You<br/>
&gt; &gt; FEED commands to Verant, the actions are resolved on the server,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the RESULTS are sent back to you. You may modify the commands<br/>
&gt; &gt; sent, or the results on your screen, and it won&#39;t change what<br/>
&gt; &gt; happens to your character on verants servers at all. It is a great<br/>
&gt; &gt; way to preclude tampering. You may change your screen to show<br/>
&gt; &gt; 50000pp, but try to buy something.... The next screen update will<br/>
&gt; &gt; show your real totals... Your character and all interaction with it<br/>
&gt; &gt; are done BY Verant on their own servers. You have NO real contact with<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything that must be modified for any kind of cheat to work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; aye, the best you could do would be... stop/start the rain... change night<br/>
/ day....<br/>
&gt; and stuff like that. but no permanent changes in your character at all.<br/>
Maybe, but<br/>
&gt; just maybe you could get rid of root, blind and spells like that ... just<br/>
intercept the<br/>
&gt; server feed using some program to tunnel it and remove/add commands from<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; feed , the server would think you are rooted but since your EQ client<br/>
didnt recieve<br/>
&gt; the command to root you it would let you move freely.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, there is one important thing that is handled completely on the<br/>
client side.  That is, where you are in the world.  (Proof, sit in a spot,<br/>
unplug your ethernet cable from the back of your PC, run 1000 spaces,<br/>
plug it back in, see that you&#39;re still there and not at the other place.)<br/>
So it should be possible to modify the X/Y/Z location in the client and<br/>
have that information passed on to the server...<br/>
<br/>
Uses:<br/>
1 key to the zone line.<br/>
bypass guards and jump right to the rare spawn and then jump right out<br/>
again.<br/>
PVP combat, randomly move 25 in each x/y direction.<br/>
<br/>
