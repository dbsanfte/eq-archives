<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129480344"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I have read NO other true statements from them about profit or not <br/>
&gt;profit. But then again, I guess<br/>
&gt;their actions with these patches speak louder than words.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I have read at least two interviews with Brad McQuaid <br/>
describing how they view trade skills, and he has explicitly stated <br/>
in no uncertain terms that they do not want any of the player trade <br/>
skills to be implemented in such a way so as to allow for a player to <br/>
purchase items from vendors, execute their skill, and sell the <br/>
results of their efforts back to vendors at a profit.  The way they <br/>
want it to work is to offer players a &#39;sweet spot&#39; between what they <br/>
paid for materials and what NPC vendors charge for an equivilant item <br/>
to what a player can make themselves through their tradecraft.  This <br/>
way, a player is encouraged to sell their wares at a profit to other <br/>
players and not at a loss to vendors.<br/>
	In this way, they want to stimulate the &quot;player run economy&quot; <br/>
and not a &quot;kick back and make a bunch of plat just interacting with <br/>
vendors&quot;-type approach.  I&#39;m not saying I agree with it, I&#39;m just <br/>
passing on what I know to be true... not player speculation or rumor, <br/>
but actual statements from The Man. :)<br/>
