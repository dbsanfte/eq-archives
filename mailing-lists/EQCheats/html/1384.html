<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075724909">Thanks all for the assist with the crafted items quests. Over the weekend,<br/>
my warrior got Crafted Helm, greaves, and boots (lreadying having gauntlets<br/>
and bracer)! WOOHOO!!<br/>
<br/>
Dark Circlet is off Trezdon in Najena<br/>
Frost Totem is off Goblin Patriach in King room in Permafrost (need a level<br/>
30-34 group to break spawn)<br/>
Fire Totem off some goblin in SolA, I hear High Shaman, but I got it from a<br/>
friend (gave the gems to a friend and she did the quest and handed me the<br/>
greaves).<br/>
<br/>
Now, all I missing is a Breastplate and Pauldron I think... Lets see, Talon<br/>
and rune of the Dwarves... I know where the talons are (don&#39;t know how to<br/>
get to the gypsy/werewolves...will have to wait for one to train to zone<br/>
prolly), but I&#39;m not sure where the Evil Eyes are in Beholder. Seen one near<br/>
the purple crystals in the water, but don&#39;t know where they spawn? Anyone<br/>
help me out?<br/>
<br/>
Also gonna need to find Borxx, since he drops one of the three peices I<br/>
hear. Where does he spawn, and how often?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for everyone&#39;s assistance in the crafted quests!!</div>
