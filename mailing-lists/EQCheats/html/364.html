<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239421362">You have to purchase a ruby from an NPC jewel merchant.  So far, every<br/>
attempt to use any other ruby (there is one off a fish in Rivervale) has<br/>
failed.  With the exception of killing Lynguna herself, since she usually<br/>
drops a ruby.  (Seems kinda wierd to kill a unique NPC, get their loot, then<br/>
take it back to them in their next life).  In case it&#39;s not obvious, Lynguna<br/>
will KOS any non-evil race.<br/>
<br/>
The midnight mallet and Brutechopper have similar stats.  Atk 14 & 15<br/>
respectively, and dly 47 & 48 respectively.  The weight on both is around 11<br/>
I think.  The midnight mallet has 5 charges of waking sleep.  Whether or not<br/>
it can be recharged I do not know.  Some say it&#39;s 5 per day, but I&#39;m almost<br/>
certain that is incorrect... since I have one, and it&#39;s been sitting at 4<br/>
charges for a long time (many in-game days)  I do not know if the<br/>
brutechopper has a magical effect.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about the Brutechopper, but the MM can only be used by shamans<br/>
or dwarven clerics.<br/>
<br/>
It looks veyr large when holding it.  My troll was standing next to a<br/>
halfling last night and the head of the mallet was almost as large as the<br/>
halfling was.  The sucky thing tho is that it uses the attack animation for<br/>
a 2H staff.  The little half-swipe-poke move.  Which looks stupid with this<br/>
giant hammer.  I was really looking forward to a big over-head smash<br/>
animation once I got the mallet.  I put in a feedback for it, but I know<br/>
it&#39;ll never happen.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve hit for 26 damage with it.  It&#39;s a little slower than the rts.  Not<br/>
twice as slow, or even half again as slow.  So if you&#39;ve got all your dex<br/>
and strength buffs going, you&#39;ll hit hard a lot.  Ratio-wise it&#39;s identical<br/>
to the glowing wooden crook.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on the innoruk server, and I&#39;ll sell mine cheap to anybody who wants to<br/>
buy it.  The price is 100pp.  Why am I selling it?  Mostly because my<br/>
playstyle doesn&#39;t involve melee that much.  (despite what people say,<br/>
shamans are only slightly above _suck_ in melee because their skillcap is<br/>
lower)  I&#39;ve also got a round of spells coming up and I seriously need to<br/>
upgrade my armor.<br/>
