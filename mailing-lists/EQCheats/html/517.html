<b>Subject:</b> Help on Drosco/Wolten Quest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-978581705">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m stumped and would like a bit of advice please.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten the letter off of Drosco in the Qeynos sewers and turned it<br/>
in to Wolten at the paladin guild for the note to carry to Freeport.  I<br/>
then spent two hours running through Highpass Hold to Freeport  (pants<br/>
and wheezes).  But then I spent hours running all over the temple of<br/>
Marr in North Freeport without ever finding the woman I&#39;m supposed to<br/>
give the letter to for my reward.  I thought she might be keeping<br/>
bankers&#39;s hours so I wandered around the temple for two days and nights<br/>
(game time) without ever seeing her.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone please tell me where she is?  I&#39;ll run back to Freeport if I<br/>
can be certain of finding her, but it&#39;s a very long trip to waste time<br/>
on just for the hell of it.  Please help me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
