<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919057476">Yup, that&#39;s what I meant. Sorry, if I wasn&#39;t clear about that. I am one of those<br/>
people that get used to hotkeys and rarely ever want them to change. As a result<br/>
common button maps for common clases are really good for me. I get really aggravated<br/>
when I keep hitting the spell book hotkey when I mean to be hitting taunt or<br/>
something like that. Even better example is the necro /pet commands. You don&#39;t wanna<br/>
be hitting the wrong buttons in a dungeon. =) Another thing to note, If you do the<br/>
same name over several servers then monkeying around with the hot buttons will have<br/>
the same effect for ALL characters for that name. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a bug or what,<br/>
but I was messing around with an alternate character on the Fennin Ro server (E marr<br/>
was down again.. go figure) and now that character&#39;s hot buttons ALWAYS disappear no<br/>
matter what server I login to. I guess I just have to delete the NAME.opt file and<br/>
then recreate the buttons to get them back, but it isn&#39;t that big a deal for me as<br/>
it&#39;s a the enchanter I started, but never play. If it was my main character, I would<br/>
have devoted a little more time to fixing it! :) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s just a little trick (and pitfall) I figured out and thought you might<br/>
enjoy knowing.<br/>

&gt; I think what he means is if has a paladin named bob and a hot key for lay<br/>
&gt; hands. The hot key for lay hands will be a blank space for bob the warrior<br/>
&gt; on another server (becuase he doesnt have the skill of course). There for to<br/>
&gt; get the EXACT layout he makes another bob the paladin. But you are right<br/>
&gt; anything else thats the same on both classes will transfer fine.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But they are still two separate characters..correct??? just same name<br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; class..right?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;i think it doesn&#39;t even care about class; the hotbuttons are<br/>
&gt; &gt;name-based.  I think. </span></blockquote></div>
