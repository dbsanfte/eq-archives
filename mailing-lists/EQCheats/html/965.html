<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-893977762">For the people who responded that just *HAVE* to alert others that a<br/>
cheat is bannable, how about a compromise; when you see an email that<br/>
lists a bannable cheat, can you please just WAIT a little while before<br/>
responding?  An email alerting that a cheat may be bannable is<br/>
certainly useful, 5 are not, no matter HOW much your ego is assuaged<br/>
by sending it.<br/>
