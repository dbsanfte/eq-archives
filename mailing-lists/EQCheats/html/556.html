they are taking a lot of the fun out of the gameby<br/>
doing this. Why the hell have those skills at all if<br/>
nbody profits from it? who is going to use a pie tin?<br/>
A baker won&#39;t... because they took the profit out of<br/>
baking. <br/>
<br/>
Who really cares if somebody wants to stand at the<br/>
pottery wheel and make 30 - 40 plat an hour? Not<br/>
me... all Verant is doing is really making this a<br/>
power game. the less profitable our skills become...<br/>
the more camping and kill stealing you are going to<br/>
see. Not to mention high level characters running<br/>
through newbie zones justr to make some quick dough.<br/>
<br/>
I uderstand that they want us to interract... but I<br/>
was interacting plenty when I was able to make my<br/>
money off of my pie tin making skill. I think they<br/>
are making things far too difficult. And, if this<br/>
continues... i for one don&#39;t know how much longer I<br/>
will play EQ.<br/>
<br/>
Verant wants you to play it the way THEY want you to<br/>
play it and I just don&#39;t think that it is right or<br/>
fair. If I want to do nothing but stand and make pie<br/>
tins all day, or bake pies, or make beer, to make<br/>
money... that should be my buisness... trust me... I<br/>
allways return to the party situation. As a troll I<br/>
didn&#39;t make much off of it at all... MAYBE 20 plat an<br/>
hour. They shoudl NOT do away with the profit margin<br/>
all together. Lower it or something... or at least<br/>
make the dambned skikll useful for god sake!<br/>
<br/>
This is realy aggravating me... I am going to stop<br/>
now before I cancel my account. Yes... I&#39;m that upset<br/>
over this.<br/>
