<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092997626">lucky.  I did this stupid quest about 5 times before it was fixed/broken, <br/>
back when it gave plunga&#39;s head as the reward and all us brewers thought you <br/>
could read the book when they fixed it so you could have new recipies...<br/>
<br/>
anyway, I have an 8th level druid and all 4 items but can&#39;t do this stupid <br/>
quest, grrr....<br/>
