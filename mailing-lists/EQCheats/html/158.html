<div id="ygrps-yiv-778162679">Is reinforced leather better than snakeskin armor of the same piece, i.e. is<br/>
snakeskin arms better than reinforced arms?<br/>
<br/>
If not, then snakeskin is the way to go.  You get + vs poison, and it&#39;s<br/>
fairly easy to get in Blackburrow, or Split paw, can&#39;t remember which one,<br/>
but you could go there for about a week, and have close to a whole set.  Our<br/>
druid did it, with a friend to help, and they had it in 3 days.<br/>

&gt; &gt;	This is all well and good for medium wearers. And it is fairly well <br/>
&gt; &gt;known that the other Karanas yield decent LQ, MQ, and HQ Bear pelts for<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt;larger types (as well as the Kodiaks to the East). However, with several <br/>
&gt; &gt;hundred puppies that have gotten their noses whacked I find no good<br/>
&gt; source<br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; &gt;LQ, MQ, or HQ pelts for small sizes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;	And while on the subject, any use for LQ pelts besides resale for <br/>
&gt; &gt;coin? Tailors use MQ (studded) and HQ (Reinforced, which last I heard<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt;working). LQ uses?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I found that to get any quality wolf pelts it&#39;s best to kill the wolves in<br/>
&gt; Qeynos hills. I had never gotten anything other than a ruined pelt or some<br/>
&gt; sort of skin before I tried the wolves there, in just a few hours I had<br/>
&gt; several HQ and med wolf pelts. Reinforced does work, it&#39;s only one or two<br/>
&gt; points of ac better than leather but I have successfully made a few<br/>
&gt; pieces.<br/>
&gt; As to low quality pelts, there is a quest that uses bear and wolf pelts of<br/>
&gt; low quality in QH but that&#39;s it. Does anyone have any tips for me on where<br/>
&gt; it is best to get HQ bear pelts? I have killed countless bears for a very<br/>
&gt; long time and have only gotten my hands on 4 HQ bear pelts to work with.<br/>
&gt; And two of those I got lucky and found and bought from a store.<br/>
