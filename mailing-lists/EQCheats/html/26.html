<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202703468">Not sure about the sense heading. But at level 6, to make 10 plat quick. Is <br/>
to join a guild, get high level guild members to give you stuff. Then go sell <br/>
and quit guild. How you like that? Bwahahahah!! I am a Dark Elf Cleric, and I <br/>
have about 17 plat in bank. Just from saving. I have basic armor, so do not <br/>
need anymore for a while, and do not need anything until level 9 and spells. <br/>
So I have just been saving and that is what I have so far. Not too hard, and <br/>
I am gaining exp along the way. So it is all worth it. Anyone know where I <br/>
could get Fine Steel Weapons, or armor off of monsters?</div>
