<b>Subject:</b> RE: possible big cheat for EQ.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-382002254"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: &quot;Whitcraft,David&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:DWHITCRAFT@...">DWHITCRAFT@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hey, the two monitors is an interesting idea... Win 98 supports dual<br/>
&gt;monitors, I&#39;ve seen it done back in Beta when we were testing it.... I also<br/>
&gt;work coding programs for DINPACS systems, which often use 2 or more HIGH<br/>
&gt;(2400x2000) res monitors... Now, given the way EQ works, I DOUBT that EQ<br/>
&gt;would come up on one screen and the other would be the rest of the desktop,<br/>
&gt;but it MIGHT be possible to get to work, I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone tried this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I wonder if you could write a program that would send a windows<br/>
&gt;message to EQ that would minimize or &#39;restore&#39; (take to a smaller window)<br/>
&gt;EQ. Now, THAT might be worth investigating... Anyone tried this? I could<br/>
&gt;probably figure out a way to find the handle for the EQ window and have a<br/>
&gt;program runing in the background automatically send it a restore message<br/>
&gt;after EQ loads... Wouldn&#39;t that be cool....<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s way cool and highly feasible. Haven&#39;t tried it myself, although you <br/>
may have just opened up the possibility of a very big cheat - a &quot;trainer&quot; <br/>
utility that uses this idea.</div>
