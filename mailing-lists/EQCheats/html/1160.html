&gt;I think not. I play EQ a lot from different computers. Things I have to<br/>
&gt;set up on each new computer are hotkeys, friends list, and ignore list.<br/>
&gt;However, my character, equipment, bank balance, faction, current buffs,<br/>
&gt;and location remain the same.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That indicates to me that all of the second list are on the server, not<br/>
&gt;the individual computer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Quite possibly true. I don&#39;t know for sure either way - in my opinion I <br/>
agree with you. However, the main thing I&#39;m wondering at this point is - <br/>
what applications could hacking the files stored client side have? It has me <br/>
on pins and needles. I hope that nothing major comes of this. I&#39;d hate like <br/>
hell to see my hours of work earning items, cash, etc go down the tubes. Yet <br/>
on another aspect, I&#39;m intrigued. 8p</div>
