You have also hit that nail right on the head.  I am only a casual player,<br/>
and there have been many patches where I&#39;ve felt a bit shafted.  They have<br/>
made EQ into a beast that requires absurd amounts of time to make any<br/>
progress whatsoever.  I used to have a great group of people to party with,<br/>
but I couldn&#39;t dedicate the 40+ hours per week that they did, so I&#39;m enough<br/>
levels behind that I can&#39;t group with them and make any progress... so I&#39;m<br/>
stuck at a mid level and I haven&#39;t been able to find another decent group<br/>
for the life of me.  So instead of facing all the frustration, I&#39;m wishing I<br/>
could just switch my characters to &quot;inactive&quot; status... where I can&#39;t play<br/>
the game, but they don&#39;t delete my characters.... so I can come back in a<br/>
year or so if nothing better comes along.<br/>
<br/>
On the flip side, if EQ was just 50% easier, you wouldn&#39;t be able to pry me<br/>
away from that infernal compter.  It&#39;s the excitement of making progress<br/>
that is so fun, and for the casual gamer, the progress curve in EQ is so low<br/>
after lvl 20 that it&#39;s just not that much fun anymore.  I&#39;d almost rather<br/>
spend my time playing Kingdoms or go back and play Bladur&#39;s Gate all the way<br/>
through, or best of all... go find a good text-based MUD where I can advance<br/>
at a reasonable speed then wiz and start adding my own imagination to the<br/>
world.<br/>

P.S. does anybody know a email address for feedback?  I&#39;d love to just share<br/>
some of these frustrations.</div>
