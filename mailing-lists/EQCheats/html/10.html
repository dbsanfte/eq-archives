<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616077067">I am a Dark Elf Cleric. At level 9 I get HoW but I was wondering what I <br/>
should get before that. Or what is better than the HoW. Any quest item or <br/>
anything like that. Also was wondering some stats on the Flowing Black Robe <br/>
you get in Najena. Just curious, thanks.</div>
