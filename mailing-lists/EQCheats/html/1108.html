<b>Subject:</b> RE: possible big cheat for EQ.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-455879753">this is not a flame :)<br/>
<br/>
What do ppl really expect?  when I got EQ I was amazed that it&#39;d been out a <br/>
week or 2 and there weren&#39;t any trainers for it yet.  I&#39;m still amazed that <br/>
there aren&#39;t any.  Congrats to whoever is doing security there they deserve <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
But there are ppl that want big cheats.  There are ppl that want a new <br/>
challange, a new hard game to make a cheat program for.  There are ppl that <br/>
have ideas on how to do stuff.  You get a list like this one the topic is <br/>
cheats, a lot of us have a decient amount of computer, networking, hacking, <br/>
encryption experance of course you&#39;re going to have ideas on how to get <br/>
around EQ security if someone brings it up.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this may make EQ trainerable, but it may not.  I&#39;m sure anything <br/>
current will change by the expansion that&#39;s due out this christmas (or <br/>
after, can&#39;t remember).<br/>
<br/>
Omeg who isn&#39;t sure if he wants anything to come of it or not anymore...oh <br/>
well, it&#39;s fun to brainstorm stuff.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;That&#39;s way cool and highly feasible. Haven&#39;t tried it myself, although you <br/>
&gt;may have just opened up the possibility of a very big &gt;cheat - a &quot;trainer&quot; <br/>
&gt;utility that uses this idea. </span></blockquote></div>
