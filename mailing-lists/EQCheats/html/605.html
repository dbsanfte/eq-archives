<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968707491">I am not really in a great hurry, but I like to see<br/>
my character advance. The RP aspects of this game are<br/>
about 1/10th of UO&#39;s even though that game was riddled<br/>
with Player Killers, bugs and exploits. I enjoy the<br/>
game, but I feel after playing similar game types that<br/>
this game corrals you more into the powergamer role. <br/>
<br/>
I get into the mindset that I can play this game for a<br/>
few hours and be about the same as I started or I can<br/>
play something like Heroes of Might and Magic III and<br/>
go through a few scenarios. <br/>
<br/>
I will more likely plan to leave due to slow leveling<br/>
than I would if I would see constant improvements in<br/>
my character. <br/>
<br/>
Even level 50s still have to go in two full groups to<br/>
take on the tougher stuff like the dragons. <br/>

&gt; I used to play meridian 59. I loved this game but<br/>
&gt; people got burned out on<br/>
&gt; it becuase you could build too fast and then got<br/>
&gt; bored. Then people went<br/>
&gt; around and PKed each other. It turned a wonderful<br/>
&gt; online community into a<br/>
&gt; garbage dump. What is your great hurry? You planning<br/>
&gt; on leaving soon? As<br/>
&gt; long as you are having fun and meeting new people<br/>
&gt; and playing a game you<br/>
&gt; like what difference does it make what level you are<br/>
&gt; or how fast you get<br/>
&gt; there. These games are ment to be played for years<br/>
&gt; not weeks. I am<br/>
&gt; surprised that people have already been able to max<br/>
&gt; out. Now what do they<br/>
&gt; have to do? Ok they can go anywhere and kill almost<br/>
&gt; anything but how long<br/>
&gt; before they get bored and move on? The game has only<br/>
&gt; been out a few months.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my 2 cents<br/>

&gt; &gt;I agree that level gaining is quite slow. 8-10<br/>
&gt; hours<br/>
&gt; &gt;for a level is a bit much. I can&#39;t imagine the high<br/>
&gt; &gt;30s and above. <br/>
