<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651473399">ok enough enough, i will finally tell you all the way it is with hacking EQ.<br/>
<br/>
    to &quot;hack&quot; eq, you could do the following, change items on your chr and<br/>
find all items ingame and then equip them, change the amount of pp your chr<br/>
has, the race avatar, class avatar, and a few other things.<br/>
<br/>
 the how to &quot;hack&quot; EQ. you would have to have 2 computers, set up on a rpoxy<br/>
and have one be the base server for the internet server and play eq on the<br/>
one that is not the server. then with the one that has the proxy server get<br/>
a winpacket editor and search for strings and such on the line. once oyu<br/>
make, yes you would have to make a search engine and sniffer, you oculd<br/>
start to find what thigns are what of all the info being sent to and from EQ<br/>
servers. once you discover what strings do what then you oculd alter them on<br/>
your side once you are sent the packet then once the packet is sent back it<br/>
would thus be saved on the server side. the problem is you would have to be<br/>
able to &quot;grab&quot; a packet to edit it.  then send it back and make the server<br/>
think it was doing its job and you were jsut getting pl.<br/>
<br/>
  ok there is the LD on it and if you have any questions please FLAME ON,<br/>
also you could do this iwth a sys running win98 and then any other sys that<br/>
could run the software required.<br/>

&gt; I have looked through my EQ directory and have seen a few things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A.) The graphics/sounds are on your computer. They have names like<br/>
&gt; qeynoshills.xmi, qeynoshills.s3d. It may be posible to remove<br/>
&gt; fog/rain/darkness/ocean (the fogyness underwater: you could make water<br/>
&gt; crysatl clear)<br/>
&gt; B.) There is a file that contains a list of guildnames and a single player<br/>
&gt; name next to each of them. I assume this is the guild leader beacuse my<br/>
name<br/>
&gt; is next to my guild. This file is full of giberish too which makes it hard<br/>
&gt; to read.<br/>
&gt; C.) There is a file that contains the names of every other file followed<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; 3 small hex values. This may be used to check if files have been modified.<br/>
&gt; Ex:   qeynoshills.xmi d54sd3f46 54df7sd5g 6s8fs69sf<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are no files containing anything that is recognizable (to me) as<br/>
info<br/>
&gt; regarding your character. After thinking about it it would not be posible<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; store that kind of info on your computer and still have the ability to<br/>
sell<br/>
&gt; your acount (on E-bay)<br/>

&gt; &gt;If there were a way to hack the files locally and give yourself items,<br/>
&gt; &gt;alter<br/>
&gt; &gt;your bank box, or anything important like that, people would have already<br/>
&gt; &gt;hacked it (and then Verant would have most likely put in something to try<br/>
&gt; &gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;fix it, so we would have heard about it).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The only thing I see that&#39;s possible to hack would be the graphics files,<br/>
&gt; &gt;which HAVE to be local. No way they could send that much information over<br/>
&gt; &gt;the &#39;net, isn&#39;t possible. So, the graphics have to be stored locally. You<br/>
&gt; &gt;could write something to alter the packets as they come in to filter out<br/>
&gt; &gt;certain graphics messages (blind, rain, nighttime, spell effects, etc),<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; &gt;you might be able to hack the graphics files themseleves and just take<br/>
&gt; &gt;these<br/>
&gt; &gt;affects out.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;None of these bother me enough to want to wirte anything to filter<br/>
packets<br/>
&gt; &gt;though.... *chuckle*<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;I think not. I play EQ a lot from different computers. Things I have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;set up on each new computer are hotkeys, friends list, and ignore list.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;However, my character, equipment, bank balance, faction, current buffs,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;and location remain the same.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;That indicates to me that all of the second list are on the server, not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the individual computer.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Quite possibly true. I don&#39;t know for sure either way - in my opinion I<br/>
&gt; &gt;agree with you. However, the main thing I&#39;m wondering at this point is -<br/>
&gt; &gt;what applications could hacking the files stored client side have? It has<br/>
&gt; &gt;me<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;on pins and needles. I hope that nothing major comes of this. I&#39;d hate<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; &gt;hell to see my hours of work earning items, cash, etc go down the tubes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Yet<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;on another aspect, I&#39;m intrigued. 8p<br/>
