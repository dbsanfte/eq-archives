There was an excellent post either earlier this week or end of laat week on<br/>
locations on all of the items required for the crafted pieces (or many of<br/>
them). If anyone still has this list, could you either re-post it or email<br/>
it to me?<br/>
<br/>
If not, can we fill the list back out again?<br/>
