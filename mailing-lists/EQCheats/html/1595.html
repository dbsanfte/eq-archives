&gt; Subject: Where is the raw-hide armor merchant!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hail i have been searching for days, anyone know where the raw hide<br/>
&gt; merchant <br/>
&gt; is located at? What i mean is a merchant that sells unlimited supply of<br/>
&gt; RAW <br/>
&gt; HIDE (not leather) armor. I know he exists, because i saw it once a long<br/>
&gt; time <br/>
&gt; ago, but for the life of me cannot remember. Please help!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure about a merchant that sells raw hide.  I have never seen one,<br/>
but I know where you can get great amounts at if your willing to kill some<br/>
zombies.  Go to eruds island (The one with the wisps) and go to the sunken<br/>
ship on the island.  By the ship (underwater) 3 zombies spawn.  They drop<br/>
Zombie Skins and Raw hide common, and rarely drop Bronze weapons.  But the<br/>
good part is they spawn fast and usually by the time you clean up the 3&#39;rd<br/>
zombie the 1&#39;st one has spawned again.  Probably with about 30mins to an<br/>
hour of camping you may be able to have a complete suit of raw hide.<br/>
<br/>
Heres a tip for pulling the zombies.  If your a caster of anysort with a<br/>
lull type of spell you can easily pull them with no worries.  You can wade<br/>
into the water just enough where you can see CLEARLY all the way to the ship<br/>
without actually being considered swimming.  It&#39;s not hard to do.  just keep<br/>
taking small steps forward until the ship comes into plain view.  You know<br/>
you&#39;ve done this wrong if you see your breath meter pop up.  Once you waded<br/>
in just enough to see all 3 zombies clearly you can lull 2 and pull one<br/>
without having to worry about outswimming them since you&#39;ll basically be on<br/>
land anyway.<br/>
<br/>
If your a druid and want the best leather armor I recommend just buying some<br/>
reinforced leather from a tailor.</div>
