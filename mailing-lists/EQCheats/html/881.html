<b>Subject:</b> Re: ___JBoots___ and Anticamping coding <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894857528">I read a Q&A with either Brad McQuaid or John Smedley on EQVault, probably<br/>
Brad. He was asked about anti-camp zones specificaly and he said that while<br/>
they were thinking about it or testing it in beta they did not implement any<br/>
anti-camp code.<br/>
<br/>
My take on all this is just crappy randomness in the game. Multiple fizzles<br/>
and resists are more common than isolated or alternating ones, the best<br/>
chance to get a rare loot, if you were betting on it, is on the very next<br/>
spawn than some random numbe of spawns.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t camp all that much but so far I&#39;ve seen that if say the mean item<br/>
drop time is 8 hours what really happens is the item might be dropped 2-3<br/>
times in rapid succession within 4 hours (rapid?) then nothing for 20-24<br/>
hours. This is for relatively normal item not the super rare items like the<br/>
GBS.<br/>
<br/>
What I have seen:<br/>
<br/>
Tae Templar not spawn for 2 day, throne room was being cleared all the time.<br/>
next day my friends got 3 rubi legs in 3 consecutive spawns.<br/>
<br/>
AoF spawning infrequently and dropping only 1 tunic in about 12 hours then<br/>
back to back AoF within 20 min and both dropping tunics. During the same<br/>
time the Cenobyte spawns pretty regularly for 3 days straight but never a<br/>
pair of boots on him.<br/>
<br/>
BUT these and your observations are pure speculation you have to spend a<br/>
statistically significant time observing a spawn and need to know the spawn<br/>
rules for that specific mob that verant has put in to tell if either there<br/>
is anti-camp code (no there isn&#39;t) or if their random number generator is<br/>
flawed (yes it is). I have no desire to do that.<br/>
