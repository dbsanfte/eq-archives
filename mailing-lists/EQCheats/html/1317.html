<b>Subject:</b> Nagafen Problems <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106674809">Ok all you Nag killers<br/>
<br/>
We attempted Nagafen last night.<br/>
Giants were all a piece of cake, no deaths and no real problems.<br/>
<br/>
Heres the problem we encountered and I need to know If anyone else has seen<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
3 of our casters, 2 clerics and 1 enchanter  lost the ability to cast spells<br/>
during the melee.<br/>
I don&#39;t mean we were charmed or feared or roared.  I mean, all spell and<br/>
hotkey functions were gone, as if fear effect continued forever.<br/>
We were forced to camp to clear effect.<br/>
<br/>
We could have taken Nag easily if not for this.  Losing 2 out of 3 clerics<br/>
does sort of affect the outcome of battle.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a bitch nor am I inviting complaints<br/>
<br/>
I need to know if anyone else has encountered this.  We had a nice long talk<br/>
with our Servers head GM and she wants to know as well so they can fix this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
<br/>
