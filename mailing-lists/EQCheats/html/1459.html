&gt; about named gnoll :<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; last night i was hunting at the gnoll reaver and undead reaver spot <br/>
&gt; and i have see a rare spawn a gnoll named splitclaw (no sure of the <br/>
&gt; exact name)  it cons red to me at lvl 17. he also has summoned a <br/>
&gt; pet (a skeleton ) wich cons white to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Splitclaw is about 25 ish.  He isn&#39;t THAT rare as i&#39;ve seen him and<br/>
i&#39;m not in the area often.  ANyhow i talked to someone who killed him<br/>
and he didn&#39;t have anything out of the ordinary.  Just words or<br/>
something.<br/>
