<div id="ygrps-yiv-124037667">ok...<br/>
<br/>
I have lots of fun not cheating and in every game I play I have at least one <br/>
100% legit character, and I play that character to have fun not cheating...<br/>
<br/>
but other times I feel like just roamping around the game with a hacked <br/>
character to have fun with things my real character can&#39;t touch/see yet.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;d love to go take a look at Lady Vox (just see her in the game, <br/>
not kill her, just look) but I have a feeling that if my 8th level Half-Elf <br/>
Druid did manage to get to her somehow I&#39;d see that familiar LOADING... <br/>
PLEASE WAIT msg before I could blink.<br/>
<br/>
make more sense now?<br/>
