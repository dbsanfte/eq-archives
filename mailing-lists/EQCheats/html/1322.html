&gt;	&gt;Heres the problem we encountered and I need to know If anyone else<br/>
&gt;has seen<br/>
&gt;	&gt;this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	&gt;3 of our casters, 2 clerics and 1 enchanter  lost the ability to<br/>
&gt;cast spells<br/>
&gt;	&gt;during the melee.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	I was playing with a friend yesterday, in Befallen too, and at one<br/>
&gt;time my keyboard went out. I hit the hotkeys but NOTHING happened. I could<br/>
&gt;talk, but couldn&#39;t &lt;i&gt;nventory, &lt;a&gt;ttack, etc.  I had to /exit. And then <br/>
&gt;log<br/>
&gt;again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same thing has happened to me, my brother and several friends. We all <br/>
submitted /bug reports about it, and that was the last we ever heard of the <br/>
problem. It still continues to happen though.<br/>
<br/>
We all play on Bertoxxulous.</div>
