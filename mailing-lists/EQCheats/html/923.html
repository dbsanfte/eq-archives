<div id="ygrps-yiv-647342837">I work 40 hours a week, have my own apartment, my own car, loan, bills, I<br/>
go to night school aswell and I play maybe 2-3 hours a night....so about<br/>
15 hours a week...<br/>
<br/>
That won&#39;t get me a pait of JBoots, or BIBS, or BIC...or any rubicite or<br/>
anything....but you know what I do....I just enjoy the game.  So WHAT if<br/>
you can&#39;t have an item you want.  Tough shit....really people....sure the<br/>
item may be cool....but it&#39;s not the end all and be all of your<br/>
character.....please.....quite bitching about camping.  I don&#39;t camp,<br/>
can&#39;t camp....and don&#39;t care if others do.  If they want to stay up 18<br/>
straight hours....then let them....this is a game after all....there are<br/>
other things going on in the world.<br/>
<br/>
As far as items not being on a MoB all the time.  Well...that would make<br/>
SoW from a shaman or druid...not very special....that would make that<br/>
special weapon not so special anymore.  That would make the 10-40 hour<br/>
wait to get the PGT that much less special.  If you want to power through<br/>
the game...get all the best weapons and armor easily and not have to work<br/>
at all to get em....then go play UO.  I don&#39;t want to see everyone running<br/>
around with JBoots...wielding PGT&#39;s and Darkewood shields....<br/>
<br/>
 ~S<br/>
<br/>
p.s.  power leveling, stupidity and camping will thin out rather<br/>
soon....seeing as highschool/college are starting rather soon.....relax<br/>
people....plenty of items in the game that we know of....and plenty more<br/>
that we don&#39;t know about.</div>
