&gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Actually, there is one important thing that is handled completely on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; client side.  That is, where you are in the world.  (Proof, sit in a spot,<br/>
&gt; &gt; unplug your ethernet cable from the back of your PC, run 1000 spaces,<br/>
&gt; &gt; plug it back in, see that you&#39;re still there and not at the other place.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; So it should be possible to modify the X/Y/Z location in the client and<br/>
&gt; &gt; have that information passed on to the server...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also believe what targeting happens only on client side. If client is<br/>
&gt; notified about monster (update has been sent from server what such<br/>
&gt; monster exists) you can target it without server check. Afaik targeting<br/>
&gt; in EQ uses bounding boxes tracing, and im sure it is made by client, not<br/>
&gt; server. So, because you can shoot your DDs through walls and monsters in<br/>
&gt; most cases cannot move through walls, it can be ultimate cheating.<br/>
&gt; Target any monster in dungeon on client, and nuke him from behind a wall<br/>
&gt; without any opposition. Of course, server do not send ALL monsters in<br/>
&gt; zone to client, so you dont know their IDs and cannot target them at<br/>
&gt; all, but you possible can target any mob in ~30 meters radius.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now that would be a big exploit. Its the client who tells you if you can or cannot hit a mob<br/>
so it might be possible to change the mobs position in client side only... like make them<br/>
all appear just in your face (sure, only the ones you know the ID).. done that you can<br/>
cast / hit them from far away...<br/>
<br/>
its even possible to tell you the mob distance... like when you /con a mob you get an extra<br/>
message<br/>
saying the mob distance so you know if you can actually kill the mob before it even reach you or<br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
I dont know if EQ have the mechanics (however its spelled) to avoid this kind of cheat...<br/>
they could send sanity checks asking/sending to the clients lots of stuff to avoid this kind<br/>
of cheat but that would increase lag. Seems to me that Verant relies all their protection<br/>
(against this kind of cheat) in dont allowing you to ALT-TAB, which is a good protection<br/>
but not the best... if you have anything running between you and the server as I mentioned<br/>
before you really dont need to ALT-TAB. you can create your own commands that only<br/>
your program understand and do not send to the server... lemme see what could be done<br/>
easily...<br/>
<br/>
/ultravision on/off<br/>
/rain start/stop<br/>
/sow on/off   -&gt; As someone mentioned before maybe the server dont have sanity checks<br/>
to see if you are moving too fast... the server might trust the client too much in this aspect of<br/>
the game<br/>
/levitate on/off<br/>
/clipping on/off -&gt; it would allow you to move through walls just like quake<br/>
/breath on/off -&gt; would let you breath underwater... did you EVER notice that the air indicator is<br/>
NEVER<br/>
affected by lag ? Maybe the server trust the client too much in this....<br/>
/casting_time  seconds -&gt; this one would never work , the server is the one that control casting<br/>
time =)<br/>
<br/>
well I could give examples forever... some of this wouldnt work but I BET some would work...<br/>
<br/>
again, Verant rely most of their security dont allowing you to ALT-TAB, and they trust too much<br/>
in EQ client =P<br/>
<br/>
BUT I can be completely wrong anyway =)<br/>
<br/>
I just think the game is too fun and no one is bored enough to start coding<br/>
