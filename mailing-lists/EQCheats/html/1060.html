<div id="ygrps-yiv-294901642">Here&#39;s a correction to my earlier post about nerfing the quest for the <br/>
glowing stein - after the next patch, the glowing stein will be known as the <br/>
Stein of Moggok, and will be a 7 dmg 43 delay 1h blunt weapon that has to be <br/>
equipped in your primary melee slot. It&#39;s supposed to have the same bonouses <br/>
and is NOT supposed to be a NO DROP item. My info was obtained from a <br/>
reliable website. Here&#39;s one quote that was posted there:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;begin quote&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As of Monday&#39;s patch on the Test Server, the Glowing Stein is no more. If <br/>
you possessed it, it is now a Stein of Moggok. It is now a 7/43 1 handed <br/>
blunt weapon, and can only be carried in the primary melee slot (right <br/>
hand). If you already had it in the secondary melee slot (left hand), then <br/>
it will stay there until you remove it. Other than that, it is the same. <br/>
MAGIC ITEM, and LORE ITEM and is NOT no drop. However, the quest difficulty <br/>
is being increased once the new item is implemented. This has been verified <br/>
by GM&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Remember last time this happened? A lot of items ended up being found only <br/>
on the Plane of Fear. It seems Verant has a bad habit of understating <br/>
things.<br/>
