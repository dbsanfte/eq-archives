<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609135551">Do yourself and others a favor... Don&#39;t go to Unrest... It is already<br/>
overcrowded with people (over 90 last night!) which makes the whole area<br/>
slow down...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really a good place to get experience, yes... but a TERRIBLE place to<br/>
get killed in (especially for a character that cannot bind right outside)<br/>
which can happen often to lower levels (those under 15) from the many trains<br/>
and long distance from the house to the zone.  Many times I have zoned into<br/>
Unrest only to find about 10-20 (or more!) bodies in the tunnel from the<br/>
zone to the house... It looks awful!  And many players have to travel all<br/>
the way from Kaladim or Kelethin to get back to their corpse which takes a<br/>
long time as well...<br/>

&gt; You can go to Unrest now. Beetles would be good,possibly solo. Might be<br/>
low<br/>
&gt; blue to you now though. Get grouped up and start tackling jack-o-lanterns<br/>
&gt; and other lawn trash. Don&#39;t go in the house tho...bad juju...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if anyone could tell me where I should be hunting as a<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; 12 bard. Ever since level 8 I&#39;ve been in Steamfront killing skeles and<br/>
&gt; clockworks. Now everything con&#39;s green (except for mino&#39;s, and they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; usually heavily camped). Where should I be hunting now? Crushbone is way<br/>
too<br/>
&gt; overpopulated, on Tarew Marr at least. I just need somewhere to hunt until<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; hit 14 then I&#39;ll go to Unrest. Thanks for any help.<br/>
