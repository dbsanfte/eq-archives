<b>Subject:</b> Finding Ores <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774008012">profits are still to be had in some respects in certain skills - you<br/>
just<br/>
have to be willing to do a little work ... like getting your own ores<br/>
and<br/>
clays, and not buying them from the store.  That alone will save you a<br/>
lot<br/>
of money, not a lot of time, but a lot of money. :)<br/>
<br/>
Would someone please tell me where to find ore besides buying it?  I&#39;m a<br/>
17th level ranger so finding it on a rare 30th level spawn in the bottom<br/>
of some dungeon is pretty useless.  Nonetheless, where is it to be found<br/>
at all?<br/>
