<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163785365">Here&#39;s how I envision trade skills, and they would be damn usefull, <br/>
IMHO, were these ideas implemented.<br/>
<br/>
Brewing:  Yeah!  We can get drunk!  But shouldn&#39;t a master brewer be <br/>
able to make other items besides alchol?  Perhaps an invigoring tonic<br/>
that restores stamina faster, or a healthy potion that gives a short<br/>
period of regeneration?  (We could use troll chunks for this... yuck!)<br/>
<br/>
Baking:  Why can&#39;t we have a soup that cures disease or poision?  The <br/>
possibilites with baking are endless with a little creativity and some<br/>
effort.<br/>
<br/>
Pottery:  Where are the sketches to make molds for weapons and armor?<br/>
Maybe a nice ceramic bow stave for the master fletcher around the way,<br/>
or ceramic arrow shafts/vanes? <br/>
<br/>
Smithing:  Weapons, armor, etc...  Maybe allow the use of enchanted <br/>
metals for special armor and weapons.  Steel Bow Staves?  Steel arrow <br/>
heads?  I&#39;d buy them.<br/>
<br/>
Fletching:  Fix archery!  Why would anyone buy an arrow that has a long <br/>
range when archery is so F^&%&#39;d up, that it doesn&#39;t matter?<br/>
<br/>
As it is, the trade skills do not even come close to generating anything <br/>
like a player based economy.  Making the damn things usefull would<br/>
do wonders.  I doubt Verant will ever do wonders.  <br/>
<br/>
I am presently in a suspended mode, evaluating if I should bother <br/>
playing again.  Seeing the effects of the patches, I doubt I will.<br/>
<br/>
(Micro Servo&#39;s no drop?  WTF!)<br/>
