<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I warned this person to stop emailing me.  As per my lawyers request I had warned him before not to email me or a proof reading fee would be exempted to<br/>
            his university/his parents.  He sent me an email this morning that was lengthy and I didn&#39;t even bother reading it.  Again (to the people of the list), do not send me<br/>
            private emails.  Mr. Clark is going to have to go to small claims court because of his actions.</div>
