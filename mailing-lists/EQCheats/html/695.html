Verant has seen fit NOT TO TELL ANYONE HOW TO MAKE<br/>
THE FRICKING THINGS!  They said the vials were to be<br/>

trying every different combination to make the stupid<br/>
vials, and nobody has it yet.  So rejoice, poison is<br/>
fixed! Good luck finding vials though.<br/>

Add a new item to make.... but don&#39;t update the<br/>
pottery book to tell you how to do it. Stupid.<br/>
<br/>
I dunno why me email displays that. I use<br/>
Rocketmail... mst have something to do with them so<br/>
don&#39;t ask. i can do nothing about it.<br/>
