: the npc to see for this quest is Brin Stolunger in the warrior guild in S.<br/>
Qeynos.  I haven&#39;t done it myself as my Barbarian Warrior hasn&#39;t got high<br/>
enough faction rating yet(.<br/>
<br/>
Great, thanks for posting info! :)<br/>
<br/>
However... I have talked to this guy before as a little human warrior, he<br/>
starts the Strongbear bracers quest. When you hail him he yammers on about<br/>
[young steel warriors] and [spectators] to the Arena... what are the<br/>
keywords having to do with the Hero Bracer?<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully I know how to raise my faction with them... I will do so tonight<br/>
with my higher-level character with the Shackles. Maybe Brin will<br/>
auto-detect when a high-level character speaks to him and give different<br/>
keywords upon hailing? Also... assuming that I have high enough faction, can<br/>
I just dump the Shackles on him and get the Bracer? Are you sure?<br/>
<br/>
If you have more info please share, thank you very much. </span></blockquote></div>
