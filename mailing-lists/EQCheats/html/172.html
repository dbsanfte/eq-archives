<div id="ygrps-yiv-425468245">The fiery avenger is a paladin only sword.  I have heard from numerous<br/>
people that it is NOT found on any npc.  It is a quest item.  You have<br/>
to find the parts to it and have it put together from what i<br/>
understand.  There will only be ONE available on each server as well. <br/>
IMHO this weapon is far too much power for only one class to be able to<br/>
wield.</div>
