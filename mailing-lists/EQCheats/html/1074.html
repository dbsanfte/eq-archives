Why is everyone assuming that the datastream is encrypted?  Within<br/>
a month of attempting it another group had an everquest *SERVER* <br/>
emulatorthat was able to have a client walk around the world and see <br/>
monsters that they spawned.  Surely you don&#39;t think they had time to break <br/>
ANY encoding and *STILL* be able to analyize the protocol to the point of <br/>
having a working server do you?<br/>
<br/>
I never said it was encrypted. I was making comments about the possibility <br/>
that it may be, and comments about someone else saying it was encrypted.</div>
