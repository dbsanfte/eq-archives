<div id="ygrps-yiv-710476241">For those of you not on top of things, with Verants forecasted (test<br/>
server)change of price for pie sketches(pottery), players just loaded up<br/>
their inventorys with pie sketches at 12 copper each.<br/>
Well after the patch, npc&#39;s will now buy those pie sketches for about 500<br/>
copper.<br/>
I know of numerous players that filled up their inventories, their bank, and<br/>
mules with these stackable pie sketches.<br/>
Total possible, 2880 sketches, for one character.<br/>
Total Investment: 12 copper * 2880 = 34,560 copper<br/>
Total ROI: 500 copper * 2880 = 1,440,000 copper.<br/>
thats a 35pp investment with a return of 1,440pp<br/>
Pottery was very profitable. For some.<br/>
<br/>
Good hump-day to you all!<br/>
