<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724942606">Your theory is correct, when in a battle, if a person in your party is charmed, he will NOT get xp for anything killed during the duration of the charm...<br/>

On a related note:  On that foray against the evil eye....  The other 5<br/>
people all got charmed in our group...  they started attacking while I was<br/>
AFK, so I got there halfway through the battle.  I unloaded all my manna at<br/>
the eye and successfully killed it.  I got an experience message, but nobody<br/>
else in the group did.  My current theory is that once you are charmed, you<br/>
count as a monster, and won&#39;t get the experience message for any group kills<br/>
during that time.  Unfortunately, this is also hard to test.  Unfortunately<br/>
that mishap resulted in the death of more than half our party... but when I<br/>
looked at my XP-o-meter, I got a huge chunk of XP from the fight (if my<br/>
theory is correct, I got all of the XP)<br/>

When fighting evil eyes in the gorge the other night, I hit the sit button<br/>
while charmed somehow. The result was canceling the charm, which allowed me<br/>
to continue with my battle. I managed to do this repeatedly throughout the<br/>
night. This could be a coincidence or an actual bug in the game, I&#39;m not<br/>
sure. Since I felt it was cheating, I quit doing it and left the gorge+ADs-<br/>
after all, I only wanted another Polished Bone Bracer +ADs-)<br/>
