&gt; Subject: 	[EQCheats] Everquest Cheats over 30 of them<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I started a website devoted to cheats and hacking in everquest...I&#39;ll <br/>
&gt; post a few over the next few days and see how you like them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My website is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquestbugs.com">http://www.everquestbugs.com</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s a grouping bug that lets a 7th member in your group<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This 7th member won&#39;t be able to talk in the group but I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; told that <br/>
&gt; he will able to read what the other member in the group say.  This <br/>
&gt; 7th member will not sure up on the grouping list. Also this 7th <br/>
&gt; member will gain exp as if he were in the group.  I have no tried <br/>
&gt; this bug so I can&#39;t verify that it works but here it goes:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;       If you have 6 people in a group have one of them disband and <br/>
&gt; then reinvite him,...then invite the 7th person and have them join<br/>
&gt; in a <br/>
&gt; certain order (not sure what order so you might have to play around <br/>
&gt; with this one).  This bug was submitted by a member of my website and <br/>
&gt; he himself said that he was in a group with 7 people because at one <br/>
&gt; point the 7th person went link dead and it told the group the he went <br/>
&gt; linkdead.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks and let me know if you want more cheats or you can just go to <br/>
&gt; my website,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
