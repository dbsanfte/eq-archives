<div id="ygrps-yiv-633441460">I have a particular hatred of Show EQ, people use it on the Team PVP servers<br/>
to pick their victims - what use is anonymous when some twink with Show EQ<br/>
can tell exactly what level you are, how many hitpoints you have and how<br/>
much cash you are carrying? To me this program is the lowest of the low and<br/>
I cheer when I hear of someone getting banned for using it.<br/>
