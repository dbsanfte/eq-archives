<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452433663">Ok, i already sent this message once and nobody responded...Im going to<br/>
send it one more time in the hopes that someone will have information to<br/>
add to my list..<br/>
<br/>
I am only a Level 16 monk so I do not have very many rare spoilers for<br/>
you guys.  However, I<br/>
have a few odds and ends that I have picked up in my travels.  Some of<br/>
this stuff is what I have heard, so<br/>
take it as you will.<br/>
<br/>
There is a glowing torch found on a rare spawn in Lavastorm...It gives 4<br/>
AC, adds +5 charisma, and can<br/>
be used as a lighting source when held in your hand.<br/>
<br/>
After receiving the Squad Ring from the quest in Riverdale, you can use<br/>
it to kill Nillipus fairly easily.  All<br/>
you have to do is lure Nillipus into the cleric&#39;s guide, where the ring<br/>
can be recharged, and then use the ring<br/>
when you are low on health.  You can then recharge the ring at one on<br/>
the NPC&#39;s.  I do not have the squad<br/>
ring yet, so i can not verify that this works.  I would appreciate it if<br/>
someone would tell me how to recharge<br/>
the ring?<br/>
<br/>
When talking to NPC&#39;s, they give keywords in brackets.  To activate<br/>
these keywords you have to ask a<br/>
question using the keyword.  Usually, a simple question such as What<br/>
[keyword]? will do the trick.<br/>
However, when the keyword is a person, then it requires a Who<br/>
[keyword]?  I know this sounds pretty<br/>
simple, but it took me forever to figure out.  :)<br/>
<br/>
There are a pair of Shiny Silk Gloves which are found on the Queen<br/>
Spider in Lesser Faydark, i forget stats<br/>
but I believe they are magical.  It would take about a level 16 group to<br/>
get them.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, that about ends my knowledge...know, i have a request for a few<br/>
spoilers of my own<br/>
Most of these deal with packs or  bags which reduce the weight of things<br/>
put inside...<br/>
For all of these, I would love to have information on:<br/>
% of weight reduction<br/>
where it is found<br/>
what level to get it<br/>
how much do they sell for<br/>
<br/>
Shralok Pack- I know it comes from Highhold Pass, thats it<br/>
<br/>
Bag of Sewn Evil Eye- Found in Lower Guk?, 8 slots<br/>
<br/>
Traveler&#39;s Backpack- found on Rathyl in Najena, need to get keys or<br/>
something to find him<br/>
<br/>
Traveler&#39;s Pouch- found on Rathyl in Najena, can only hold small items<br/>
<br/>
Traveler&#39;s Pack- reduces weight by 20%, 8 slots, sometimes reward for<br/>
Nillipus quest<br/>
<br/>
Archaelogist&#39;s Pack- found on Goblin Archaelogist in Permafrost, 6 slots<br/>
<br/>
Lionhide Backpack- found in South Karana? off of a rare spawn<br/>
<br/>
Pierce&#39;s Pouch of Storing- reduces weight of items by 50-75%, 8 slots,<br/>
sometimes a reward from Nillipus<br/>
quest<br/>
<br/>
If you know of anymore weight reduces packs, and have information on<br/>
where to get them, please let me<br/>
know...Any information about these items would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Also, where is the best place to find black pearls if I wanted to buy<br/>
them?<br/>
And info on the Serpent Skin Eyepatch would be appreciated...<br/>
<br/>
Sorry so long,<br/>
All help is appreciated,<br/>
