&gt; &gt; Sorry guys....<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have to side with Verant on Nerfing the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pottery/Brewing type skills.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you guys want to sit around doing these<br/>
&gt; &gt; monotonous, boring vendor-type<br/>
&gt; &gt; skills, than I guess that is your prerogative...BUT<br/>
&gt; &gt; I sure don&#39;t see where<br/>
&gt; &gt; you guys should be making 8-10 times the profit in<br/>
&gt; &gt; an hour that a person can<br/>
&gt; &gt; make out fighting monsters.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Agreed, they seem to be going a little overboard<br/>
&gt; &gt; with there &#39;corrections&#39;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think it should be impossible for you to<br/>
&gt; &gt; make money selling made<br/>
&gt; &gt; items to NPCs, but the amount of money that you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>make<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; should be very<br/>
&gt; &gt; comparable to what I can make out there gathering<br/>
&gt; &gt; loot off of MOBs.  My<br/>
&gt; &gt; impression (please feel free to correct me if I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; wrong!) is that you guys<br/>
&gt; &gt; are the same group of people that made hundreds of<br/>
&gt; &gt; millions of TONS of<br/>
&gt; &gt; surplus Tailoring-made items in UO - you chose to<br/>
&gt; &gt; spend time working up your<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tailor so you could provide your mage with enough<br/>
&gt; &gt; money to buy reagents.<br/>
&gt; &gt; True?<br/>
&gt; &gt; The point I&#39;m trying to make is that you guys were<br/>
&gt; &gt; taking advantage of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; system...using in imbalance in the pricing<br/>
 </span></blockquote>structure<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; to make a LOT more cash<br/>
&gt; &gt; than you should have been able to make by using<br/>
&gt; &gt; trade skills.  Be happy that<br/>
&gt; &gt; you got to take advantage of the system as long as<br/>
&gt; &gt; you did.  But PLEASE<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t whine when they try to balance things<br/>
 </span></blockquote>out...it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; trivializes the real<br/>
&gt; &gt; issues around game balance.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for your time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Flame away  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Never played UO past beta. I thought it was crap.<br/>
 Yes... I was using my pottery skill to buy my<br/>
spells... but listen... I sunk 60 or more plat intio<br/>
pottery just to be able to make a profit! And that<br/>
was when I was 10th level! not like I had a cash<br/>
flowing out of my ears! So it wasn&#39;t like I was just<br/>
suddenly good at pottery. It was a HUGE pain in the<br/>
ass! No to mention I was a troll on the pvp server...<br/>
which meant the only place i could buy sketches was<br/>
all the way down in sro... so i was constantly going<br/>
fro neriak to sro,... neriak had the pottery wheel<br/>
and SRO had the sketches. So here I habve wasted all<br/>
this time traveling and spending money to get the<br/>
skill up... and now it is going to be totally<br/>
useless! I wouldn&#39;t care if they lowered the profit<br/>
margin in half... but dam it...if youre going to have<br/>
a skill in the game.... then make it friggin&#39; have<br/>
SOME kind of use and value!<br/>
<br/>
What they are doing is not balancing.... it just<br/>
plain sucks. And, there&#39;s a lot of things sucking<br/>
about this game lately and it is starting to really<br/>
tick me off. It is supposed to gtet better with<br/>
time... not worse.<br/>
<br/>
There is no use fopr pottery now... no use for<br/>
brewing... and no use for baking... so why not take<br/>
them out of the game completely? <br/>
<br/>
And just so you know... My troll only makes about 15<br/>
plat an hour... and I can do that with a party<br/>
killing dervs. But when I don&#39;t have a party to get<br/>
with... it was sure nice to make a little money till<br/>
one came along.<br/>
