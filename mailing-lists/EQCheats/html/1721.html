realize how much easier this game is than it was 4 years ago when I started 
playing?&nbsp; Getting levels actually meant something back then, now people 
think of it just as an obstacle to get to the end of the game it seems.&nbsp; 
Anyway, cry me a river, players now have it easier than ever 
before.</font></span></div>

  your thoughs on recent changes<br><br></font></div><tt>DUe to the frequent 
  changes sony/varent has induced into this game <br>such as revamping some 
  perfectly fine zones and make them harder than <br>orginaly, and swiping c3 
  and even c2 from our collective grasp, my <br>famley members who play this 
  game will be writing sony and they will <br>shortly and most likely <br>be 
  quiting this game, which in effect may lead to my defection as <br>well due to 
  the incressing dificulty of this so call &quot;class balancing&quot;<br>now mind you 
  this is total horse shit on sonys part, and they are <br>taking all the fun 
  and adventur out of this game by making every <br>thing totaly impossible and 
  un reachable, now i know not every one <br>feels like this but not every one 
  is a druid who with out c3 can <br>cast no more that 3 spells with out haveing 
  to sit for 20 minets and <br>meddititing for example<br><br>What im asking my 
  fellow everquest players and there friends is for <br>there suport in the 
  effort we are trying to get sony to see, that <br>they are systematicly 
  desimating a game that once was fun and <br>enjoyable. Once this letter is 
  writin i will have it in <br>the forums were i can with sonys email which we 
  have directed these <br>coments.We would appriciate the suport of our fellow 
  gamers and <br>friends if they too would also after that time email sony and 
  the <br>like with their concers and grips- please once this is posted 
  <br>consider our request as some one has to fight back again the few who 
  <br>decide they need to nerf our spells, our strengh and our fun in this 
  <br>game <br><br>I am asking for the suport of fellow games in showing there 
  <br>displesure for the changes that are taking place with this game and <br>im 
  hoping to fight back against the evil that is the everquest <br>managemnt.
