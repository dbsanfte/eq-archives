<div id="ygrps-yiv-179948093">Don&#39;t know how to raise faction with trolls (Froggies raise faction with<br/>
trolls? Seems like they do...not sure though).<br/>
<br/>
Problem with this is you need ALOT of cash sometimes....and sometimes you<br/>
only need a few hundred pp. I know one person that used 1500pp and never got<br/>
the hoop...<br/>

Hail,<br/>
<br/>
I want to do the quest for the ivandyrs (not sure of spelling) hoop, a<br/>
magical earing that gives INT. I have to give Lyunga a ruby to get the<br/>
earing. But she is a troll so hoz do I raise faction with her (I am an<br/>
Erudite). Also can anyone who has done this quest tell me if it gives any<br/>
exp too ?? And if it does how much ?? thx :)<br/>
