<b>Subject:</b> RE: Gnoll Slayer Sword <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-964048635">Was wondering if anyone has completed this quest, or knows where the White<br/>
One Eyed gnolls are? The white gnolls I know of are in Lake Rathe, the<br/>
Embalmers at night, and the Undead Reavers in NK. I don&#39;t think they have<br/>
one eye though...<br/>
<br/>
Any clues?<br/>
<br/>
Well the Gnol Reavers in EK and the Exhumed Gnolls in Lake Rathe do only<br/>
have one eye. If you look at their faces one is is poached.</div>
