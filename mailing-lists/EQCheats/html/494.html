When fighting evil eyes in the gorge the other night, I hit the sit button<br/>
while charmed somehow. The result was canceling the charm, which allowed me<br/>
to continue with my battle. I managed to do this repeatedly throughout the<br/>
night. This could be a coincidence or an actual bug in the game, I&#39;m not<br/>
sure. Since I felt it was cheating, I quit doing it and left the gorge;<br/>
after all, I only wanted another Polished Bone Bracer ;)<br/>
<br/>
Good Hunting All.</div>
