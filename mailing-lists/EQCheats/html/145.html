<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-149157166">Aye, for studded leather, you have to smith the studs and then tailor the<br/>
low quality skin (not easy to get) with the studs.  For Re-inforced<br/>
leather, you have to smith the boning and then tailor the high quality skin<br/>
with the boning.  This is a very complex process for what you get.  The<br/>
smith has to make the studs from metal bits and files, the files are made<br/>
from metal bits and a file mold.  The tailor has to find all of the skins<br/>
which are hard to get because most kills yield up ruined pelts.</div>
