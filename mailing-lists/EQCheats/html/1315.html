<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920298064">Hmmm, that rings a bell. I tracked a Lt in North Karana once, and went out<br/>
to find him since I had never seen the name before.  He was green to me in<br/>
the low 30&#39;s.  He was just a little northwest of the wooden bridge, just<br/>
standing out in the meadow.  He didn&#39;t respond when I hailed him, and he<br/>
soon started walking west.  The fact that he was on my tracking list<br/>
indicates that he probably had just recently spawned (anyone who knows how<br/>
tracking for over 30 rangers works will understand), so unless he spawns in<br/>
a random spot, I&#39;d look for him there.  I didn&#39;t kill him, since he conned<br/>
amiably to me (and I&#39;m a good little ranger :).  Hope this helps.<br/>

&gt; This item is dropped by the Lt. in  N Karrana, and I have never seen this <br/>
&gt; guard.  Perhaps he is blind and can&#39;t find the guard towers.  If anyone<br/>
&gt; has <br/>
&gt; any info as to where he is, I would greatly appreciate it.  Yes, there<br/>
&gt; will <br/>
&gt; be a horrible faction hit, but that&#39;s the way it goes. Thanks all.<br/>
