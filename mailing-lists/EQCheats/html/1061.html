<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You do not need to hack EQ program to cheat, you can hack network <br/>
&gt; &gt;protocol. All vital data flow through protocol and it is much easier &gt;to <br/>
&gt;decode than program itself. But protocol can be crypted, and &gt;impossible to <br/>
&gt;decode at all..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not entirely true. Being ex-military, and being an ex-intelligence type, and <br/>
having been trained/shown how to do it, cracking network protocol and <br/>
network protocol encryption is not as hard as you think it is. But don&#39;t get <br/>
me wrong. It&#39;s not something that you can just hop on a computer and learn <br/>
overnight or in just a few hours. You have to know what you&#39;re looking for, <br/>
and then, just maybe then, you can figure it out on your own. It would take <br/>
months, or possibly even years to learn how on your own.</div>
