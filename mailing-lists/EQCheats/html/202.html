<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468753867">My Paladin only misses once out of every eight tries.  You also have to<br/>
take into account that we can buff ourselves pretty well stacking our<br/>
spirit armor, bravery, and guard spells to take our AC beyond that of a<br/>
warrior or monk and Symbal of Tranzil to add 250 more hit points by itself.<br/>
<br/>
I think Verant has done a pretty good job in making the classes pretty<br/>
comparable.</div>
