<div id="ygrps-yiv-550698798">Hast told me he split the ruby with other people who were there...but<br/>
obviously he kept the Metallic Robe for himself.....so Jason, are you saying<br/>
that you were the GM that was controlling Archeon??  I don&#39;t know Hast well<br/>
but he has always given me the perception that he is an honest helpful<br/>
person.....he spends a lot of his time taking his turn on the templar and<br/>
diviner.....I know most people think a lvl 50 should spend there time doing<br/>
something that is more there lvl like the fear plane .....but he told me he<br/>
is getting stuff for his guild mates.....my point is he could steal every<br/>
Tae spawn if he wanted too...but not only does he not steal, he makes sure<br/>
no one else steals......usually two or three groups are there and when it is<br/>
your turn he tells you.....the one day the only reason I was there was to<br/>
get a lizard scale cloak, didn&#39;t want ruby, and I was talking to Hast and I<br/>
told him this....the next thing I know there was a Lizard scale cloak in my<br/>
trade window with the trade button already pushed....he said &quot;here so you<br/>
don&#39;t have to sit here and waste your time waiting for the tae&#39;s to spawn.&quot;<br/>
He had told me he had two he was saving for guild members, but he was prolly<br/>
going to get a bunch more so he just gave me one......so you guys be the<br/>
judge....<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for getting off the topic of the list....<br/>

		&gt; In fact it was Brian Hook, formerly of Quake 3 fame who<br/>
ran that event.  The<br/>
		&gt; thing that disgusts me is that that wizard told everyone<br/>
that the Archon<br/>
		&gt; dropped nothing.  It took everyone in the zone to deal<br/>
with the mob&#39;s and<br/>
		&gt; the Archon, and this guy not only has the gall to keep the<br/>
loot all to<br/>
		&gt; himself, but also to lie about what he got.  Gives all<br/>
wizards a bad name,<br/>
		&gt; oh, wait, they already have that, don&#39;t they.<br/>
<br/>
		Ummm, what are you talking about?  Hast apparently DID tell<br/>
people what<br/>
		he got, since that was reported in the e-mail to which you<br/>
replied.  And<br/>
		while you might be magnaminous enough to share, most people<br/>
actually<br/>
		keep the stuff they earn.<br/>
<br/>
		Though I imagine Hast probably shared the rubicite, since<br/>
it&#39;s not<br/>
		exactly stuff he can wear. =)<br/>
