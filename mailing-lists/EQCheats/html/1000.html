&gt; Anyone know where in Halas this quest can be completed and how hard it<br/>
&gt; is?  This weapon has pretty damn good stats (6/23 weight 4), almost<br/>
&gt; identical to a silvery war axe and much better than a combine weapon.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not lore so it can be dual weald as well.  Any help would be<br/>
&gt; appreciated. </span></blockquote></div>
