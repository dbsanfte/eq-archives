<div id="ygrps-yiv-189714570">----  The quest starts in Kelethin - The weapons shop by the druid guild,<br/>
there&#39;s an NPC outside the weapon shop * i saw him through a window* who<br/>
told me a large story about the kilij, actually quite interesting.  To get<br/>
the Kilij you have to bring him the plans and 3 bars of enchanted gold,<br/>
that&#39;s all i know at this time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Yes i do know where the plans come from, can you please send more info to<br/>
&gt; the list as to where the quest starts from please, at any rate the plans<br/>
&gt; come off a SG in so ro, hes not named however he is distinguished by being<br/>
&gt; much lower level than a sg normally is, mid to hight twenties instead of<br/>
&gt; thirties.  Now that i have helped you please help me and tell me where the<br/>
&gt; quest starts.<br/>
