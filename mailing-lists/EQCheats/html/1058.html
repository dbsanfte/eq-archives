<div id="ygrps-yiv-480206109">Ok, last night I was trying to tailor myself a medium studded tunic.  the <br/>
first time when I follow the &#39;recipe&#39; in the tailoring book I got the &quot;does <br/>
not combine&quot; msg, so I tried again, triple checked the items in my sewing <br/>
kit, made sure they weren&#39;t stacked, triple checked the book, and still got <br/>
the same msg.<br/>
<br/>
I petitioned it and the guide that answered me wanted to know a lot of stuff <br/>
name of book, exact item I was trying to make etc...<br/>
<br/>
is this item messed up, is the book wrong in some way?  does anyone know how <br/>
to make a medium studded tunic?<br/>
<br/>
I just wish I hadn&#39;t lost 2 pelts, 10 studs, and 2 patterns to the whole <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
Omeg</div>
