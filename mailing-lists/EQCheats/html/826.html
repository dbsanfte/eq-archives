 Today I got to read about idiot A&#39;s Laptop problems (I don&#39;t give a f&#39;in<br/>
 crap)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Actually, I think my post was somewhat relevant if not entirely so, to this <br/>
list.  Being able to play EQ while on a business trip with a laptop seems to <br/>
me to be a great &quot;Cheat&quot; if not in the same sense that we normally consider <br/>
what is &quot;Cheat&quot; is.  Anyway, the laptop thread that I started also led to <br/>
another great &quot;cheat&quot;, the ability to transfer your hotkey preference to <br/>
another server.  Does that information bother you!!!  Is that not a &quot;cheat&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Many people have helpfully responded to my laptop inquiry and of the 12 or so <br/>
posts so far, you are the first to complain.  Sorry I offended you so much.  <br/>
I have been a regular contributor to this list and will continue to be <br/>
despite your admonitions.<br/>
