&gt; &gt; Well that is my automatic signature, and in no way do I intend on<br/>
&gt; &gt; removing it for YOU, since you have been the only person to point it<br/>

Actually, I don&#39;t care anymore because his articles are so<br/>
consistently mega&#39;quotes/low content, that egregiously long .sig, and<br/>
the wack-o formatting with all the +AC bullXXXX involved, that<br/>
anything from him goes to the bit bucket before I even see it.<br/>
<br/>
*BUT*, I wanted to let him know via the list that he shouldn&#39;t think a<br/>
second think that just one person is more than a little irritated by<br/>
it.<br/>
