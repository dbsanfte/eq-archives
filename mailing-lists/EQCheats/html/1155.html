<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-232670930">It&#39;s been suggested from a knowledgeable hacker, that important information <br/>
(such as your characters banking information) is stored locally on your hard <br/>
drive in a packed file. Has anyone else been able to unpack any files to <br/>
verify/refute this? If this is found to be true, then it looks as though EQ <br/>
has been hacked like UO.</div>
