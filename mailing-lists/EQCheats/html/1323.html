<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580583864">The only time I have ever had this happen is after attempting to cast a<br/>
spell *while* charmed or feared. After regaining control, no hot-buttons or<br/>
spell buttons would work but I could move around just fine.<br/>

&gt;Ok all you Nag killers<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We attempted Nagafen last night.<br/>
&gt;Giants were all a piece of cake, no deaths and no real problems.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Heres the problem we encountered and I need to know If anyone else has<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;3 of our casters, 2 clerics and 1 enchanter  lost the ability to cast<br/>

&gt;I don&#39;t mean we were charmed or feared or roared.  I mean, all spell and<br/>
&gt;hotkey functions were gone, as if fear effect continued forever.<br/>
&gt;We were forced to camp to clear effect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We could have taken Nag easily if not for this.  Losing 2 out of 3 clerics<br/>
&gt;does sort of affect the outcome of battle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is not a bitch nor am I inviting complaints<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I need to know if anyone else has encountered this.  We had a nice long<br/>
