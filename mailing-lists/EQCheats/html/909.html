<div id="ygrps-yiv-680598628">The following post is not clear at all. You seem to be saying that there is<br/>
a way to get the Dazed Goblin Knight to spawn quickly... but you don&#39;t tell<br/>
us how to do it. Please elaborate. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I agree with some of the recent posters, I think it is utter horseshit<br/>
the way rare item loots are handled in this game; forcing people to camp 18+<br/>
hours to get an item is utter insanity. All the really cool stuff should<br/>
come from quests, anyway, not from just killing a mob.<br/>
