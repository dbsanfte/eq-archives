<div id="ygrps-yiv-366867634">I can tell you that&#39;s the truth, it is still a rip and yes it can eat sand<br/>
giants.  While hunting SG&#39;s we came across it 2 times it&#39;s poison is very<br/>
damaging.  But since it is a rare spawn, and a rare items not sure if it<br/>
carries it.<br/>

By the time you are in the high teens, there is nothing in south ro worth<br/>
your while (all green) with the exception of the occasional Sand Giant, the<br/>
very rare Terrorantula, or the merchants.<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that the Terrorantula can eat a Sand Giant for breakfast, but<br/>
then I personally saw a single group of high-30&#39;s (I&#39;d guess) take it<br/>
without too much difficulty.  I have screen shots even.  Anyway, they looted<br/>
it and started shouting complaints because it&#39;s a lvl 35 mob, and all it had<br/>
on it was a couple of spider silk, spider legs and like 5 gp or something?<br/>
It was quite a rip.  Of course, I saw this at least 2 or 3 patches ago, so<br/>
the whole world of norrath could be completely freakin different now.<br/>

The Terrorantula does spawn in S Ro. All I have to say is good luck. He&#39;s<br/>
big enough to sit on 2 sand dunes by himself. And if he doesn&#39;t get you, the<br/>
hordes of undead, madmen and orcs that usually mob you at this point might.<br/>
BUT......... If you&#39;re high enough level or in a high level group, you could<br/>
probably take them.<br/>
