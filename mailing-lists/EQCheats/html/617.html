<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074759513">I agree with you Lemac.....a lot of my friends think I&#39;m nuts because I<br/>
spend my evenings in EQ when I get home from work until I go to bed.  But<br/>
when I ask them what THEY did, they spent 4 - 5 hours watching TV.  Oh yeah,<br/>
that&#39;s REAL stimulating...::rolls her eyes::<br/>
<br/>
I view my time in EQ as entertainment that I enjoy.  If some people like to<br/>
spend their free time doing something else, that&#39;s their perogative.<br/>
Different strokes for different folks......just don&#39;t criticize me for doing<br/>
something with my time that I thoroughly enjoy.  When it stops being fun,<br/>
I&#39;ll spend those hours doing something else I enjoy.  Til then...see you all<br/>
in Norrath.....<br/>
