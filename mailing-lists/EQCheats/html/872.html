&gt; Why does someone &quot;need&quot; this to level? Are you using them to kite or what?<br/>
&gt; If you &quot;need&quot; these boots, why didn&#39;t you try getting a group together<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not taking this as a flame ). I&#39;v found that roaming outdoors (my<br/>
prefered method of hunting outdoors) is very frustration when done with even<br/>
one other person. Server lag and client prediction makes you hunt your group<br/>
more than prey so I prefer to do it solo. I also have a druid and have<br/>
helped many people cross antonica and always had trouble having people<br/>
always either disappearing or running in circles. With my group we always<br/>
met at the end of the trip cause everyone knew how to get there, much less<br/>
frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a necro, and as we go up in lvls especially after 29 when we get our<br/>
last store bought pet, we do too much damage to the mob to have the pet<br/>
taunt it (I&#39;ll be lucky to mae a 34 pet at 39 so even if the pet could taunt<br/>
it would not last long) so my only choice left is to kite.<br/>
<br/>
Why should I group if I don&#39;t have to, grouping outdoors is silly I&#39;m seeing<br/>
groups around the aviak village and I find it funny. The spawns are too<br/>
sporadic for a group, and roaming the outdoors with a group is nearly<br/>
impossible.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve played a druid to 37 grouping all the way from 19-37, kited very rarely<br/>
only when my group of friends were not on so I&#39;ve so I wanted to try<br/>
something different, but to catch up to my friends I am trying to level fast<br/>
and soloing will let me do that.<br/>
<br/>
Druid to 37 - 26 days played time grouping after 19<br/>
Necro to 27 - 8 days played time solo. This includes about 18 hours in total<br/>
camping jboots and about 8 hours hunting green skels for 3 backpacks of bone<br/>
chips<br/>
<br/>
I have no interest in revisiting dungeons that I spent tons of time in<br/>
already.<br/>
