&lt;&lt; most kills yield up ruined pelts. &gt;&gt;<br/>

This is very untrue unless you are speaking of low level animals. If you want <br/>
medium quality cat pelts (for Studded) You kill Pumas in East Commons along <br/>
the desert wall. If you want high quality cat pelts (for Reinforced) You kill <br/>
Lions (especially Patriarch and Matriarch) in the Karanas. As far as I know <br/>
Patriarch and matriach are most commonly found in Eastern Karana along the <br/>
path. Also for low quality cat pelts are sometimes found on Pumas, as are <br/>
high quality.</div>
