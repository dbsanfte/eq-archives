<div id="ygrps-yiv-700627995">I am a Dark Elf and despise people trying to come and kill our guards.  You <br/>
have plenty of other ways to get experience.  As far as I know helping <br/>
guards is perfectly legal.  Buffing, healing, and training are all <br/>
legal.  You do not HAVE to come there to get experience.  As a matter of <br/>
fact you make players like me feel bad and YOU are the one who should be <br/>
warned IMHO.<br/>

&gt;Dear Sirs:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     We were killing guards inside Neriak&#39;s foreign quarters.  We play on the<br/>
&gt;Solusek Ro server.  I play as Keptin Pike.  We were harassed by players there<br/>
&gt;who were constantly dispelling us and dumping monsters (guards) on us. In<br/>
&gt;fact they even managed to dump guards on us where Neriak zones to Nektulos<br/>
&gt;So we got trapped on both sides of the zone due to monster dumping.  Two of<br/>
&gt;us died. I would like to remind you that we were not killing any vendors or<br/>
&gt;quest related  NPCs.  Also, in the Foreign Quarter there is no danger to<br/>
&gt;newbies from anything.<br/>
&gt;   GM Hidaeki said this was perfectly legal since they were role-playing.<br/>
&gt;Hmm, I  imagine I can do a lot of harassing and exploiting under the guise of<br/>
&gt;role-playing.  I asked about the exploit of PVP Switch Avoidance and he<br/>
&gt;ignored me.  I have posted said exploit below as  posted on your site.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;PvP Switch Avoidance ï¿½ using in-game methods to work around the PvP switch<br/>
&gt;and allowing non-PvP players to kill other players, such as hall blocking,<br/>
&gt;dumping of monsters, or spell effects that cross that boundary due to a bug.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please tell me if those players who were killing us fall under this exploit<br/>
&gt;and can be given an official warning. </span></blockquote></div>
