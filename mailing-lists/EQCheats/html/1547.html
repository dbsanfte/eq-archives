&gt;I want to do the rain caller quest but at 19 i dont think i will survive in<br/>
&gt;Kedge keep for more than 10 seconds...hardly enough time to camp a lvl 50+<br/>
&gt;mermaid with a few full groups of lvl 50s and loot the body.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was thinking, in quests like the CB belt quest, when you give nusbuk only<br/>
&gt;1 shoulder pad he tells you to kill another legonier and bring him a second<br/>
&gt;pad for your reward. if another person gives him 1 pad he thinks he has<br/>
&gt;goten 2 and gives the EXP and reward for the quest to the last person to<br/>
&gt;hand him an item.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are all NPCs like that?<br/>
&gt;Basicaly i need to give the mermaid hair(no drop) gorilla hair(no drop) and<br/>
&gt;an old wig to fuzzlecutter in Fp...i can get the wig but the gorilla hair<br/>
&gt;and the mermaid hair are imposible for me. Could i hire a few lvl 50s to<br/>
&gt;kill the mermaid and loot the hair and the gorillas in cazic and loot the<br/>
&gt;hair. then if Freeport they could hand those to Fuzzlecutter, then i hand<br/>
&gt;him the wig...any opinions on wether it would work or not?<br/>
