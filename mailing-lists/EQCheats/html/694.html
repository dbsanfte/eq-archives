<div id="ygrps-yiv-248889830">After the patch Ive notice a few changes in Permafrost on loot.<br/>
<br/>
I was in perma last night for 5 hours or so and only looted one bronze<br/>
sword, usually we walk away with lots of rawhide armor and lots of FS<br/>
weapons. Most all the weapons i looted last night were all Rusty, I am lvl<br/>
24 and we were taking blues and whites and yellows.<br/>
Also the archaelogist and the preacher never spawned while i was there.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else see any difference?<br/>
