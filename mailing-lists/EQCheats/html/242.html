&gt; I don&#39;t know where you guys are hearing this but the Fiery Avenger is<br/>
&gt; not paladin only. First off the Fiery Avenger is two handed and<br/>
&gt; Paladin&#39;s wield one handed swords. Orginally it was supposed to be<br/>
&gt; Paladin only but in beta Paladin&#39;s moved frorm using two handed swords<br/>
&gt; as their holy swords to one handed. Also Shadow Knights big weapon is<br/>
&gt; the Dark Reaver 20 dmg 42 dly and casts some spell. The warriors big<br/>
&gt; weapon is the Executioner&#39;s Axe 25dmg 50dly both the Dark Reaver and<br/>
&gt; Axe are in Lower Guk.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Aradune himself stated the sword would be paladin only in release.  What<br/>
are we in now?  Release.  So that makes the fiery avenger what?  Paladin<br/>
only.  Simple deductive reasoning would show you where we got our<br/>
answer.  Sheesh.  And..  Paladins can handle a 2hand sword just as good<br/>
as a 1 hand sword.. heh.  Most paladins i see have 2hand slash weapons<br/>
actually.</div>
