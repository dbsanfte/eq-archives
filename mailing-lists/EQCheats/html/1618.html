<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-417677416">Hail friends,<br/>
<br/>
Tonight me some of my guildmates will attempt to take down Phinegal in KK.  <br/>
Anyone have any good advice or tips?<br/>
<br/>
The only specific question I have is, about how many 40 plus or 46 plus folks <br/>
will be needed to take Phinegal down?<br/>
<br/>
Any other advice would be appreciated as well, I have only been as far as the <br/>
SS Guards myself.<br/>
