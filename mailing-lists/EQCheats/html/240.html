&gt; Actually the 2 best classes for PVP are Cleric and Enchanter at high levels.<br/>
&gt; In terms of melee, yes monks by leaps and bounds<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Uhm..  Enchanter.. yes.  cleric.  no.  =) I&#39;ve seen necros take out<br/>
people 7 lvls higher than them.  Heh.  And this was a lvl 14 necro vs a<br/>
lvl 21 cleric.  Necros own in pvp.  You odn&#39;t believe me..  go dual<br/>
one.  You&#39;ll get your ass handed to you.  I too thought clerics were<br/>
badass pvpers and whatnot.  Nope..  I got beat by a necro 3 lvls below<br/>
me. Clerics are good..  but enchanters and necros have us beat at higher<br/>
lvls.. hands down.  Necros dots will kill you with a quickness.  I had 5<br/>
stacked on me and it took about 30 secs for my life to go from full to<br/>
nada.  Not a pretty sight.  Necros are the shit in pvp.  So are<br/>
enchanters.  Go dual one.  It&#39;s fun.</div>
