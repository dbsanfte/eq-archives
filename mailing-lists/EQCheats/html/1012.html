<b>Subject:</b> Re: possible big cheat for EQ.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-149666296">very ironic.  I post about how something might, but probably wouldn&#39;t, lead <br/>
to what would be the biggest cheat in the game, to the EQCheats list mind <br/>
you, and I get flamed and called a moron.<br/>
<br/>
oh well.<br/>
<br/>
I know very little about hacking, but I do know some, and I know it&#39;d be <br/>
hard to hack EQ cause everything seems to be server side.  The only way of <br/>
hacking I could think of would be to figure out the IP addy of the server <br/>
you play on, hack it yourself, edit your character after breaking any <br/>
encription on the file, getting off the server, and hopeing you didn&#39;t mess <br/>
anything big up or that Verant didn&#39;t notice you as that would be some large <br/>
law breaking for a game.<br/>
<br/>
but, I know very little about hacking, do know some so this may be way out <br/>
there also :).<br/>
<br/>
flame me silly I guess,<br/>
