<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525628057">Does anyone know what kind of loot can be found in the Estate Of Unrest and<br/>
what MOBs this loot can be found off of ?<br/>
<br/>
Also, what is the best way to raise my faction standing with the Dwarves ?<br/>
I am a Half-Elf and they want nothing to do with me.  All of the people in<br/>
the town look at me apprehensively.<br/>
