<br/>
<br/>
    I have heard that drinking increases some stats and decreases others?<br/>
    Does anyone know what stats and how much?<br/>
    Does the alcolhol tolerance skill offset any of the penalties if so how much?<br/>
    What is a good drink for raising skill and a good drink for actual use when going into combat?<br/>
