<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990765789">I have seen the harm touch and it was about 300<br/>
points. He is an undead shadow knight isn&#39;t he? That<br/>
would explain it. If you camped him lately and he<br/>
doesn&#39;t harm touch, did they change him? <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I have gone insane. <br/>

&gt; yes, both are off the undead knight, someone said<br/>
&gt; that he does harm touch,<br/>
&gt; which isnt true, but on occasion he will get a pet<br/>
&gt; summoned, which dies<br/>
&gt; easy.  i&#39;ve been camping this room alot lately, and<br/>
&gt; you need a mid 20&#39;s<br/>
&gt; group i&#39;d say, healer type is nice.  make sure the<br/>
&gt; room downstairs is also<br/>
&gt; camped (bar room), or you will get all those spawns<br/>
&gt; too (they attack<br/>
&gt; through the floor).  if you have to take care of<br/>
&gt; both tower room and bar<br/>
&gt; room, its hectic, but a mid 20 group can do it as<br/>
&gt; long as there are 2<br/>
&gt; healer types, druid and cleric is good, and a burner<br/>
&gt; makes things go<br/>
&gt; smoother.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the mantle is dropped every time, the tunic is a<br/>
&gt; very rare drop, i would<br/>
&gt; say 1 in 10 is a fair ratio, and he the knight<br/>
&gt; spawns every 1-1.5 hour i<br/>
&gt; think, never really noticed.<br/>
