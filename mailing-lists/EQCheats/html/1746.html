<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-34169966">I am couting down the days, there are five days left to vote, and <br/>
only 5 people have voted, so these 5 are the people getting these <br/>
programs and sites<br/>
<br/>
THIS IS NOT A HOAX, IT IS NOT FAKE<br/>
<br/>
I am being serious when I say my character is level 255. Its swords <br/>
are 255 damage 1 delay 50K to AC 125 to all stats and 150 to all <br/>
resists<br/>
I DO UP TO 12K DAMAGE ABOUT 30 TIMES A SECOND!<br/>
<br/>
I am being serious PEOPLE!<br/>
That could be your character<br/>
<br/>
This is free, I just like sharing stuff. People, please vote, I dont <br/>
like giving it to just so few people.<br/>
<br/>
If you did vote, look for me, I am on many servers, just ask around <br/>
(Mainly ask the GM&#39;s)<br/>
I am Lord Deimos The Slaughterer if you ever see me<br/>
Barbarian Warrior level 255<br/>
Hurry people, just 5 days left!</div>
