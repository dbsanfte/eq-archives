<div id="ygrps-yiv-655552759">For those interested in Shaman DOT spells... check out this site:<br/>

<br/>
Click on &quot;DOT Calc&quot; over on the left side.  Then type in your level and drag<br/>
the mouse over the little broken graphic on the right and it will give you a<br/>
readout of the damage at a particular level.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings up a good point.  All the shaman DOT spells used to vary in<br/>
damage depending on what level you are.  But they gimped them so hard that<br/>
now they almost ALL 21 ticks, and do the same damange per tick that the lvl<br/>
19 spell, affliction, does exactly 135 damage whether you are lvl 19 or 40.<br/>
The way it used to work, affliction did about 400 damage at lvl 19 (I think)<br/>
and by the time you got to lvl 22, it was doing 500-600.<br/>
<br/>
They all had variable initial damage, depending on level, and the number of<br/>
ticks would increase based on level too.   So each time you leveled, your<br/>
DOT spell would be slightly different.  I personally found that very<br/>
interesting.  Since the lvl 5 sicken spell was essentially useless until<br/>
about lvl 15, where it&#39;s ratios leveled out to something you would actually<br/>
want to cast.<br/>
<br/>
Now there isn&#39;t a single DOT spell that last longer than 21 ticks.  Almost<br/>
all of them are more expensive to cast, they do less total damage, and they<br/>
are exactly the same every time you cast them, regardless of level.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the druids and necros get fancy new buffed up spells.  Don&#39;t get<br/>
me wrong, I don&#39;t want to sound like a whining little twit.  I&#39;m just<br/>
curious if any serious thought went into &quot;The Great Shaman Gimping&quot;, and the<br/>
designers really honestly believe that it&#39;s more balanced now.  And if so,<br/>
there must be some part of the equation that I&#39;m missing.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, shamans are not &quot;better kiters&quot; than druids.  We do get SOW at lvl 9<br/>
(as opposed to 16), but we don&#39;t get any decent DOT spells until...  uh... I<br/>
don&#39;t know now.  It used to be lvl 19 was the magic level where you could<br/>
start kiting, but that&#39;s not the case now.  I actually don&#39;t think it ever<br/>
happens now.  At lvl 19, we&#39;re only doing 135 damage, at lvl 24, we&#39;re only<br/>
doing 200, and at lvl 34 comes a 500 damage spell.  But I&#39;m sure by that<br/>
time, 500 damage will seem like a drop in the bucket.<br/>

 So, the level 19 now does 500/10*2= 100 points of damage? Scourge goes<br/>
1600/10*2=320? And the 49 does 6000/10*2=1200? This seems like too big a<br/>
hit, these actually correct? Please, let me be wrong on this one... 100<br/>
points of damage at level 19 in insane... SS does 78 at 18th level as it<br/>
is... I must be wrong on this one...<br/>
<br/>
But DAMN! I had heard scourge did 1600, but I didn&#39;t know about the 6000<br/>
damage one...sheesh<br/>

The thing the Shamans are miffed about is that our disease line of<br/>
spells used to do OBSCENE damage.  The level 19 spell did 500 damage,<br/>
level 34 did 1600, and our level 49 did over 6000.  Only thing was it<br/>
took 11+ minutes for the spell to wear off, so they were only good for<br/>
kiting.  Our disease line had the duration cut by a factor of 10 and had<br/>
the damage doubled.<br/>
<br/>
On the plus side though, our poison spells got a big power up.<br/>
Envenomed breath now does 25 points per tic for 21 tics.  You can still<br/>
kite yellows fairly easily with just this spell, but the days of kiting<br/>
deep reds with ease are over for shamans.<br/>

&gt; Question about kiting. Alot of the DoT spells just got their damage<br/>
&gt; per tick<br/>
&gt; doubles and time halved (or something similar to this - time lessened<br/>
&gt; damage<br/>
&gt; upped). Alot of people seem to be pissed bout this in the Shaman<br/>
&gt; community.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got a shaman that will hit 19 tonight, and was wondering why<br/>
&gt; people in<br/>
&gt; the kiting community are mad about this? Only thing I can think of is<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; longer it takes to do the damage, the more mana you regain running<br/>
&gt; around. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kiting.  Hit the mob with a spell, usually a damage over time.  Run<br/>
&gt; run<br/>
&gt; run run until the spell wears off.  Stop, recast, run some more.<br/>
&gt; Repeat<br/>
&gt; until OOM or beast is dead.  Med up and do it again.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yet again, stupid question...what exactly is kiting?  I get the<br/>
&gt; basic<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;whack <br/>
&gt; &gt; it and run&quot; but then what?  and why run?<br/>
