Training guards and what not on you and blocking the zones is ILLEGAL. I am <br/>
a dark elf myself, and had a few friends of the &#39;good&#39;aligned races come <br/>
into Neriak&#39;s foreign quarters killing the guards. A few dark elves and <br/>
trolls decided to start training NPCs on them, and the trolls BLOCKED the <br/>
zone. No one could leave unless they gated or evaced.<br/>
<br/>
A GM was called on the scene, and the players harrassing were given an <br/>
official warning. My barbarian friend had died because of this zone <br/>
blocking, causing him to lose his level.<br/>
<br/>
Roleplaying is one thing...causing people to die, and harrassing them is a <br/>
totally different story.<br/>

Dear Sirs:<br/>
<br/>
     We were killing guards inside Neriak&#39;s foreign quarters.  We play on <br/>
the<br/>
Solusek Ro server.  I play as Keptin Pike.  We were harassed by players <br/>
there<br/>
who were constantly dispelling us and dumping monsters (guards) on us. In<br/>
fact they even managed to dump guards on us where Neriak zones to Nektulos<br/>
So we got trapped on both sides of the zone due to monster dumping.  Two of<br/>
us died. I would like to remind you that we were not killing any vendors or<br/>
quest related  NPCs.  Also, in the Foreign Quarter there is no danger to<br/>
newbies from anything.<br/>
   GM Hidaeki said this was perfectly legal since they were role-playing.<br/>
Hmm, I  imagine I can do a lot of harassing and exploiting under the guise <br/>
of<br/>
role-playing.  I asked about the exploit of PVP Switch Avoidance and he<br/>
ignored me.  I have posted said exploit below as  posted on your site.<br/>
<br/>
PvP Switch Avoidance ï¿½ using in-game methods to work around the PvP switch<br/>
and allowing non-PvP players to kill other players, such as hall blocking,<br/>
dumping of monsters, or spell effects that cross that boundary due to a bug.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me if those players who were killing us fall under this exploit<br/>
and can be given an official warning.<br/>
