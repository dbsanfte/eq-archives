<div id="ygrps-yiv-895970316">I also agree...No drop is absolutly the most stupid thing I have ever heard <br/>
of! I can see the use for certain situations like the newbie food/stein <br/>
quest and even the PoF armor (I know i would go absolutly insane if i saw a <br/>
lvl 3 ranger in full thorny vine). But there are times when its absolutly <br/>
insane to make somthing no drop...like the micro servos in steemfront  I <br/>
uset to be able to get a micro servo along with the treant bow staff and the <br/>
dwarven wire (also no drop now...i just destroyed 11 spolls of it cause i <br/>
couldnt do anything with it now) to a fletcher along with maby 10pp and they <br/>
try the trueshot bow for me. Now i cant do that and i have to buy the bow <br/>
from sombody who has gathered all of the components and who can fletch.<br/>
Other no drop items puzzle me. The Order of thunder medalion is off of <br/>
Drosco who is about lvl 5 in the qeynos aquaducts. Its +5chr 2ac  Prety nice <br/>
but i no longer have any use for it...why cant i give it away or sell it?<br/>
<br/>
Me:    &quot;Selling a Order of thunder Medalion  +5chr 2ac&quot;<br/>
Buyer: &quot;I could use the added charisma and I dont have time to waste<br/>
        in the aquaducts looking for drosco...I will take it&quot;<br/>
Me:    &quot;How is 2pp?&quot;<br/>
Buyer: &quot;I have 2pp to spare...Sure!&quot;<br/>
Me:    &lt;Strugeling&gt; &quot;I cant seem to pry it from my<br/>
       hands!....GRRRRR...I cant seem to let go. Its as if some<br/>
       ungodly force wants me to keep this absolutly useless item<br/>
       with me or destroy it&quot;<br/>
Buyer: &quot;Oh well...I will go spend my time camping Drosco...Even<br/>
        though he was green to me at least 20 levels ago!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How about gnoll fangs...these used to be dropable...if you didnt want em you <br/>
tosed em on the ground or auctioned them away for a few silver each. Now, <br/>
even though you dont want them, some force poseses you to hold on to them. <br/>
The only way to get rid of them is by crusing them and uterly destroying <br/>
them. What was wrong with buying/trading gnoll fangs? It was a good way for <br/>
you to raise qeynos faction. All you get is a moonstone worth a few silver <br/>
which you could turn in for a BB stout worth a silver or 2 more. Hardly good <br/>
money after lvl 5!<br/>
<br/>
One thing that realy anoys me are the quest items that have no details on <br/>
them and hence need to be identified but alas they are no drop! The other <br/>
day I got 2 LORE  NO DROP &quot;Bone Chips&quot; off of 2 dread corpses chacing a low <br/>
lvl player. What are they for?  maby if i could have them identified i could <br/>
figure out!<br/>
