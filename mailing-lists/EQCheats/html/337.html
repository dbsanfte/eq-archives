wears a red shirt.. ask him &quot;Am I one with the wall&quot;... and it takes<br/>
something like 1400 faction points and necklaces do 1 point or so per one,<br/>
belts like 5.. it takes awhile<br/>

&gt;Ok, for the past several days I have been trying to complete the Squad<br/>
&gt;Ring quest in Riverdale.  I have given a whole bunch of necklaces to the<br/>
&gt;Sheriff in Riverdale, a lot of belts to Deputy Budo, and killed a<br/>
&gt;crapload of goblins.  The deputies consider me warmly...How can I tell<br/>
&gt;how much longer it will take me before I get the ring? Ive also killed<br/>
&gt;Mooto quite a few times.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, there is a NPC in Riverdale named Silna Stormsmith(sp?)...She goes<br/>
&gt;on about delivering messages to Freeport but I cannot get her to give me<br/>
&gt;the quest..Is the quest worth it?  How do I go about getting it?  If you<br/>
&gt;are coming out of Misty Thicket, Silna spawns down the hallway to the<br/>
&gt;left, next to that bench where deputies stand.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, any tips on doing the Nillipuss quest would be helpful...What<br/>
&gt;level do I have to be to kill him?  How long does it take him to spawn?<br/>
&gt;Where does he spawn?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would appreciate help on the Squad Ring quest the most...It is really<br/>
&gt;ticking me off that the stupid sherrif will not give me the ring...Once<br/>
&gt;I finally do get the ring, can I get it recharged or do I have to go get<br/>
&gt;a new one?  If I can get it recharged, how do I do it?  Im a level 16<br/>
&gt;monk.<br/>
