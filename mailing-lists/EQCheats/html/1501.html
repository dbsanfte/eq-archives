<b>Subject:</b> New Quest Items <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-165435816">I&#39;m pretty sure that all classes will have new armor in the game.  While not all<br/>
of it will come from quests in the Temple of Solusek Ro, most of the armor will.<br/>
There will be SK armor, it has a black plate apperance (nice), ranger is green<br/>
chain, cleric gold plate, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The possible problem that may arise, if the do these quests like they &quot;fixed&quot;<br/>
several of the other quests, is that if ANY of these quests rely on one static<br/>
spawn that you have to kill.  Often times these spawns are 6-8 hours apart, are<br/>
heavily camped, etc.  Anyone seen how badly Befallen and Kerra Isle are camped<br/>
(almost 24/7) now that the Paw of Opella information has become known?  The<br/>
Testiment is even worse.<br/>
<br/>
If these quests require one static spawn that has the necessary item rare or a<br/>
long spawn time, it&#39;s another useless quest IMO.  I would much rather continue<br/>
to get experience and fight in places that are challenging, instead of sitting<br/>
on a static spawn for hours to get an item.  I&#39;d love to have the best equipment<br/>
in the game, but not at the expense of my enjoyment.  I have a hard enough time<br/>
to put 3-4 hours together on a week night, let alone some of the 16 hours people<br/>
have camped for the rings from Mitty (Paw quest).  My worst horror story is 12<br/>
hours for JBoot, but at least I was getting experience at the time.<br/>
<br/>
If camping is what is required (even though it&#39;s now a &quot;quest&quot;), I really don&#39;t<br/>
see this as any improvement to the game.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this will not be the case with these new quests.</div>
