<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-250636063">I have looked through my EQ directory and have seen a few things.<br/>
<br/>
A.) The graphics/sounds are on your computer. They have names like <br/>
qeynoshills.xmi, qeynoshills.s3d. It may be posible to remove <br/>
fog/rain/darkness/ocean (the fogyness underwater: you could make water <br/>
crysatl clear)<br/>
B.) There is a file that contains a list of guildnames and a single player <br/>
name next to each of them. I assume this is the guild leader beacuse my name <br/>
is next to my guild. This file is full of giberish too which makes it hard <br/>
to read.<br/>
C.) There is a file that contains the names of every other file followed by <br/>
3 small hex values. This may be used to check if files have been modified.<br/>
Ex:   qeynoshills.xmi d54sd3f46 54df7sd5g 6s8fs69sf<br/>
<br/>
There are no files containing anything that is recognizable (to me) as info <br/>
regarding your character. After thinking about it it would not be posible to <br/>
store that kind of info on your computer and still have the ability to sell <br/>
your acount (on E-bay)<br/>

&gt;If there were a way to hack the files locally and give yourself items, <br/>
&gt;alter<br/>
&gt;your bank box, or anything important like that, people would have already<br/>
&gt;hacked it (and then Verant would have most likely put in something to try <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;fix it, so we would have heard about it).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only thing I see that&#39;s possible to hack would be the graphics files,<br/>
&gt;which HAVE to be local. No way they could send that much information over<br/>
&gt;the &#39;net, isn&#39;t possible. So, the graphics have to be stored locally. You<br/>
&gt;could write something to alter the packets as they come in to filter out<br/>
&gt;certain graphics messages (blind, rain, nighttime, spell effects, etc), or<br/>
&gt;you might be able to hack the graphics files themseleves and just take <br/>
&gt;these<br/>
&gt;affects out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;None of these bother me enough to want to wirte anything to filter packets<br/>
&gt;though.... *chuckle*<br/>

&gt; &gt;I think not. I play EQ a lot from different computers. Things I have to<br/>
&gt; &gt;set up on each new computer are hotkeys, friends list, and ignore list.<br/>
&gt; &gt;However, my character, equipment, bank balance, faction, current buffs,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and location remain the same.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;That indicates to me that all of the second list are on the server, not<br/>
&gt; &gt;the individual computer.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Quite possibly true. I don&#39;t know for sure either way - in my opinion I<br/>
&gt;agree with you. However, the main thing I&#39;m wondering at this point is -<br/>
&gt;what applications could hacking the files stored client side have? It has <br/>
&gt;me<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;on pins and needles. I hope that nothing major comes of this. I&#39;d hate like<br/>
&gt;hell to see my hours of work earning items, cash, etc go down the tubes. <br/>
&gt;Yet<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;on another aspect, I&#39;m intrigued. 8p<br/>
