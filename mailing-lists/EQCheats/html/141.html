<b>Subject:</b> Stats on reinforced or studded leather <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275630086">Does anyone have these stats?  I have been looking for these items,<br/>
but it seems tht no one makes them!  I would love to see the stats<br/>
and determine if my search is worth while.  I would be willing<br/>
to discard my quite common banded armor in favor of this if the<br/>
AC were not too much lower, just for the sake of RP&#39;ing...<br/>

&gt; &gt; I could be wrong, it just might be a place that no one has been too, or<br/>
&gt; &gt; bragged about.  But these places I&#39;m sure are few and far between, if they<br/>
&gt; &gt; even still exist.<br/>

&gt; Kera Isle is full of MOB&#39;s that like to train, an no one to help out.<br/>
&gt; The best loot I got there in 2 days of hunting Pridesman, Clawknights<br/>
&gt; Kera Guards and Huntress&#39;s were some gem stones.  Mostly I got fish.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I did meet up with some fellow travelers, and, as we were the only<br/>
&gt; people in the zone, we got great exp, which is what I need anyway.<br/>
