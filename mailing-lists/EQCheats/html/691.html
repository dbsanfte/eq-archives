&gt; Well to just confirm this, the wife and I bought, 16 boxes, filled them up<br/>
with 20 sketches in each box slot, filled 8 slots on character and in bank.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, as he was saying a total of 160 sketches per box *Boxes were cheaper<br/>
then backpacks*, 1280 sketches per 8 slots. 2560 sketches fer one full<br/>
character.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, our TOTAL intention for this was to use these to make pottery, or<br/>
work pottery, just at alot better price. Load and behold when I figured this<br/>
out yesturday morning, that it would be ALOT cheaper, and more beneficialy<br/>
if we were to just SELL the dang things back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; for one sketch, we got 4 gp, 4sp, 2cp. Ya can imagine our amazement, when<br/>
our brains started ticking, and calculating this. I first went ahead to sell<br/>
my wears, from one load of 8 boxes, I gained 556pp, so I went and sold the<br/>
other group of boxes, totaling for 1100+ pp. Now this was NOT our intention<br/>
to do this at all :( But, because of the price change, and because we<br/>
stopped to think about it, we benefitted more from the patch, then we would<br/>
have say if we actually spent the money on clay, water, fireing sheets.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, that&#39;s confirmation if you wanted it about the patch, yes some ppl<br/>
lucked out, but not everyone.<br/>

POTTERY<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; From: Kenneth Toomey kennydt+AEA-rocketmail.com<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Well..... to all of you bitching about how people<br/>
&gt; &gt; were making 40 plat an hour by selling pie-tins...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Verant&#39;s last change has made it possible for some<br/>
&gt; &gt; people to make about 8,000 plat in 20 minutes. How?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well.... those of us that used pottery often,<br/>
&gt; &gt; especially the evil races, kept sketches in the bank.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I, for one, had 8 back packs full of sketches plus a<br/>
&gt; &gt; back pack full on my character at the time I loggerd<br/>
&gt; &gt; out teh night before the day of the last update. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; figured i could at least use what sketches I had<br/>
&gt; &gt; saved up to make more pie-tins and thus a little more<br/>
&gt; &gt; money. well... I log in after the update.... the<br/>
&gt; &gt; sketches I have that used to be purchased for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; silver and some odd coin sells for about a plat or<br/>
&gt; &gt; so... no big deal. BUT, I can sell my SKETCHES back<br/>
&gt; &gt; to a VENDOR for about 5 gold eac.... they used to<br/>
&gt; &gt; sell for like 8 copper back to a vendor.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So... lets do some math here... thats 9 back<br/>
&gt; &gt; packs.... each back pack has 160 sketches in it...<br/>
&gt; &gt; and each sketch sells for 5 gopld each. Hmmm.....<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have heard of some people that thought ahead and<br/>
&gt; &gt; had multiple characters with inventories and banks<br/>
&gt; &gt; full of sketches that made ungodly sums of money<br/>
&gt; &gt; after the last update.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In effect.... Verant&#39;s attempt at fixing the game<br/>
&gt; &gt; economy has effectively destroyed it for some people.<br/>
&gt; &gt; But hey, I&#39;m not bitchin&#39;. At least I didn&#39;t have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; stand infront of a potttery wheel for hours on end to<br/>
&gt; &gt; make a lot of money.... and it didn&#39;t require me to<br/>
&gt; &gt; have any skill at all... hehe.<br/>
