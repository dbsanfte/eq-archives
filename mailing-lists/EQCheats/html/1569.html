&gt;Bat wings, along with other components that are required for various <br/>
&gt;spells,<br/>
&gt;can be purchased for sure in the Erudin Mage Tower.  I usually drop in <br/>
&gt;there<br/>
&gt;with my druid to pick up a ton of fish scales (for underwater breathing) <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;cat&#39;s eye agate (for my pure casting friends who need it for shielding<br/>
&gt;spells).  I honestly have found every regeant anyone has ever needed in <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;place!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Money at earlier levels is always a little tough to get.  Once you hit <br/>
&gt;about<br/>
&gt;20-25, the mobs you&#39;re fighting will start to drop plat on a regular basis.<br/>
&gt;I think one of the richest mobs in the game has to be Hill Giants so far,<br/>
&gt;usually carrying between 10 and 70 plat (which auto-splits nicely in a big<br/>
&gt;group).  Now I am sure Vox and Nagafen might be loaded too, but they are<br/>
&gt;usually bursting with really cool weapons and other rare items. =)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve heard that Melatite (not to be confused with Malachite) is a regeant <br/>
(can&#39;t verify). I was wondering if it could be bought there as well? I&#39;ve <br/>
been camping Sol A for it and have thus been unable to obtain any.</div>
