<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-416278990">Honeycombs are found off of Bixies and Bixie Drones.  These little guys are<br/>
prolly like lvl 2 -4 ...certainly none that I can remember higher than<br/>
5....I was collecting them last week and selling them for one plat<br/>
each...made a bundle of $$ that way (wee at least for a lvl 8 character :)<br/>
they are used for making Honeyjum....and , I think for another quest...but<br/>
after selling a bunch of the honeycomb I began wondering why it was so<br/>
valuable...and I STILL don&#39;t understand why people are paying such an<br/>
outrageous amount of $$ for it!!<br/>
Anybody know the answer to this puzzle&gt;&gt;????<br/>

I would like to know where and how to get honeycombs and off what creatures.<br/>
<br/>
  I hear a lot of people are paying 1-5pp for them because of a quest and <br/>
that people at level 5 can get honeycombs.  This would be great for making <br/>
quick money.<br/>
