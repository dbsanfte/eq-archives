<div id="ygrps-yiv-865513205">It&#39;ll be like the warrior cafted armor quest- items to make it will be no drop,<br/>
but final items won&#39;t be.  That&#39;s what all the items look like on the test<br/>
server, and since Crafted was the &quot;test&quot; on the production servers I&#39;d imagine<br/>
you&#39;ll be able to trade all the new armor too.  One thing that could change<br/>
(just thought about this) is that you could have the quest only able to be<br/>
completed by that particular class. . . .</div>
