<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291097308">This is indeed a paladin only sword. In Beta it was not but from what I understand it was only made that way in Beta so that the GM&#39;s could carry it around to show it off. However I don&#39;t know of anyone on any server who has found it yet.<br/>

  Unless they changed it..?  It&#39;s been paladin only since beta where it was a two-handed weapon but has been supposedly changed to 1-handed for the release.  In beta, its stats were something along the lines of 35 atk/50 delay or something of the like.  A very cool picture can be found at.. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gameznet.com/eq/sceenshots/aradune.JPG">http://gameznet.com/eq/sceenshots/aradune.JPG</a>  I dont know if it will be only 1 per server, I doubt it will though.<br/>

    The Fiery Avenger is done through a quest which is some way will include the Great Red Dragon in SOL B. Also it is not a Paladin only weapon unless they changed it recently. There is no way they would allow only 1 person on each server to have one because that would severely piss off the people who don&#39;t play every day. </span></blockquote></div>
