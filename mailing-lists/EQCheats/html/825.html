&gt; The same thing with cyclops in Mt Rathe.  You can pull them.  Just to the<br/>
&gt; North of the entrance from Lk Rathe is a mountain range.  If you root or<br/>
&gt; snare the cy to slow his movement you can run around the mountain range<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would say beware if any of you are trying this - the Guides and GMs<br/>
consider this an exploit, and they already know about these areas so they<br/>
hang out there invisible and watch to catch people doing it.  After a<br/>
certain number of warnings for exploiting, you&#39;ll be suspended, and then<br/>
banned permanently.  I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t do it, I&#39;m just saying I&#39;ve seen<br/>
banning happen.<br/>
