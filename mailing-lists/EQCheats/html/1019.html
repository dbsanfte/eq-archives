<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681194449">I saw on a website that the Slime Staff is from a Named eye in the Gorge. We<br/>
were fighting  the Lord (cant remember name) Eye. And only got stalks or<br/>
something like that.. Am I hunting in the wrong place or the wrong eye ?<br/>
anyone know the location and Mob that carries this item  ?</div>
