<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645265278">I have a smith friend that will make them, but, since I only want<br/>
the armor for RP purposes, and to make one set for myself hardly<br/>
is worth getting my tailoring skill up, I guess I&#39;ll be common<br/>
and stick with banded till I can get something more unique.<br/>

Gatorskin leggings/sleves and a lockjaw tunic sounds nice...<br/>

&gt; Look at it from a Smith&#39;s point of view... It costs quite a bit (mostly<br/>
&gt; time) to make both studs and boning (for reinforced), and it&#39;s much harder<br/>
&gt; to recoupe the money for them then it is for banded (remember those<br/>
&gt; failures?)  Studs usually have to go for 1p each just to break even (less<br/>
&gt; for higher level smiths, but they don&#39;t want to waste the time).  So, if<br/>
&gt; something takes 3 studs and leather, it&#39;s hardly worth it.  Try to find a<br/>
&gt; smith that will make you some if you want some.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Does anyone have these stats?  I have been looking for these items, but<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; seems that no one makes them!  I would love to see the stats and determine<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; &gt; my search is worth while.  I would be willing to discard my quite common<br/>
&gt; &gt; banded armor in favor of this if the AC were not too much lower, just for<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; sake of RP&#39;ing...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Studded is handmade armor and actually not to commonly used from what<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve asked people. Reinforced can normally be found on Druids in the<br/>
&gt; midlevel<br/>
&gt; &gt; ranges before they get strong or wealthy enough to get better armor. Ask a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few Druids in the mid teens what they are using and the stats if they<br/>
&gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt; as they are restricted to wearing no metal armor.<br/>
