<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104324450">I too, would like more info on the new armor coming out. Atleast, what<br/>
classes are there quests in for at the moment? I understand not all classes<br/>
will have quests out of the Temple (hopefully it won&#39;t be like Shaman&#39;s<br/>
promise for Alchemy....yeah, right....what alchemy - see all them potions<br/>
being sold?! ROFL), but would be nice to know which classes have them in on<br/>
Wednesday.<br/>

&gt;Cool yer jets, Rubi is too screwy. People dupe it, people argue over it, <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s way too general purpose. And, it&#39;s all being REPLACED with armor<br/>
&gt;anyways, prolly better stuff than it is now. Rubi AC with stat <br/>
&gt;bonuses...yee<br/>
&gt;haw. And, it being a quest, it&#39;ll prolly be easier to get than camping for<br/>
&gt;30 hours for a rubi bp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please excuse the typos in my previous posting - what happened is that too <br/>
many people farmed rubi and that KStealing ran rampant in that area, so they<br/>
<br/>
decided to remove it from being dropped as loot.<br/>
<br/>
I would have liked to have gotten a rubi BP for the regen properties. Not to<br/>
<br/>
mention that the red hue looks outstanding on a DESK! 8) Getting rubi armor <br/>
was one the few last things I had to look forward to for my DESK, (seeing as<br/>
<br/>
how they continuously nerf everything else worthwhile for SK&#39;s). I just wish<br/>
<br/>
Verant would think these things out before they go nerfing them the way they<br/>
<br/>
always do, and then they end up spending the next 2 months or so trying to <br/>
undo what they did to correct the original problem. It would have been much <br/>
better/easier to make rubi no drop/trade lore, or even make it a quest <br/>
reward (something like crafted, but not quite so easily obtained).<br/>
<br/>
From what I hear, they&#39;re replacing rubi with class specific armor, which is<br/>
<br/>
all fine and dandy, but will any of it have the same regen properties as the<br/>
<br/>
rubi BP? Anyone on the test server know?<br/>
