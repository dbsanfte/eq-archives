&gt; Varsoon is much lower, in the teens, but when you<br/>
&gt; kill Varsoon, Varsoon the<br/>
&gt; Undying spawns.  He looks like a zombie and is MUCH<br/>
&gt; tougher.  He was blue to<br/>
&gt; me at 35, so not sure exactly his level.  I wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; able to take him solo,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s for sure.  I heard that after he chased me<br/>
&gt; running and screaming like<br/>
&gt; a girl into surefall glade, he was killed by a level<br/>
&gt; 50 wiz, who I guess had<br/>
&gt; killed Varsoon in the first place.<br/>
