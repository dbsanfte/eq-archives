&gt; &lt;&lt; I didn&#39;t say it would be easy, you do have to work to get what you want<br/>
if<br/>
&gt;  you really want to do it, it&#39;s part of the game, and you either accept it<br/>
or<br/>
&gt;  don&#39;t, choice is yours, Yes, the ores are heavey, 15weight is a lot to<br/>
carry<br/>
&gt;  around when you&#39;re not a typical ogre/troll/barbarian.  But , with a<br/>
little<br/>
&gt;  ingenuity, one could think up possibly buying a few summoned bags off of<br/>
a<br/>
&gt;  shaman  or doing the traveler&#39;s backback quest - both items which make<br/>
&gt;  anything in them weightless.  I have done the majority of all my<br/>
&gt;  blacksmithing and pottery by fetching the materials from the mudites, and<br/>
it<br/>
&gt;  has been long tedious and at times down right irritating, but i&#39;ve worked<br/>
&gt;  hard for what i&#39;ve made :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually the travellers pack only reduces wqeight by 20%. Same with<br/>
pierce&#39;s<br/>
&gt; pack or storing. The summoned bags you are correct on however.<br/>
