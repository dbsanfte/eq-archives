<div id="ygrps-yiv-365386689">&lt;After the patch Ive notice a few changes in Permafrost on loot.<br/>
<br/>
I was in perma last night for 5 hours or so and only looted one bronze<br/>
sword, usually we walk away with lots of rawhide armor and lots of FS<br/>
weapons. Most all the weapons i looted last night were all Rusty, I am<br/>
lvl<br/>
24 and we were taking blues and whites and yellows.<br/>
Also the archaelogist and the preacher never spawned while i was there.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else see any difference?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My party hunted there for 4 hours yesterday and found a total of 2 rusty<br/>
weapons .. no armor, no bronze, nothing but coins.<br/>
<br/>
This is similar to what happened to the Dervishes in Northern Ro a month<br/>
ago.  They used to drop bronze weapons and now they only drop rusty<br/>
weapons.<br/>
