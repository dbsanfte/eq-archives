<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768151713">I just though I would drop a not that I just pinged 14th last night <br/>
(I know some of you blast thru levels like a missle but I only play <br/>
about an hour or so a day). The highest level I have got to so far is <br/>
15th as a Elf Pally then I got killed in the middle of a high level <br/>
Orc camp and was unable to recover my body (O&#39; well , I like Shamans <br/>
better anyways lol). Anyways Ias asking where is the best places to <br/>
hunt / get good drops for a 14th level Bar. shaman.<br/>

Thanks <br/>
