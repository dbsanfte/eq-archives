		Sorry, I was in a hurry and didn&#39;t disclose my source.<br/>
Brian Hook posted an<br/>
		account of the encounter on the errangers list.  What I was<br/>
saying is that<br/>
		Hast denied that there was any treasure at the time.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t say he didn&#39;t<br/>
		tell anyone about it after the fact.  And how can you say<br/>
that he alone<br/>
		earned the loot of that MOB?  There were dozens of people<br/>
there all helping<br/>
		to kill the Archon and lesser critters that had been<br/>
summoned.<br/>
		Unfortunately, he did not even necessarily do the most<br/>
damage, since GM<br/>
		controlled NPC&#39;s are open for anyone to loot after they are<br/>
killed.  Here is<br/>
		Brian&#39;s post to the ranger list.<br/>
<br/>
		From: &quot;Brian Hook&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bhook@...">bhook@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
		I have some spare time this week, and as such I&#39;ve been<br/>
doing some GM events<br/>
		after hours on various servers (I was Morxxa Mangyfur the<br/>
Werewolf in SK on<br/>
		Tunare; the named Archon in Cazic-Thule on Cazic-Thule and<br/>
Xegony; the<br/>
		Undead Vizier on the chessboard on Cazic-Thule; Frumpy<br/>
Darkpaw in<br/>
		blackburrow on Cazic-Thule), and I&#39;ve learned some<br/>
interesting things about<br/>
		players in general.<br/>
<br/>
		First, higher level players are weenies.  It&#39;s that simple.<br/>
The minute a<br/>
		fight turns against them, they&#39;re zoning.  They&#39;re also<br/>
generally very<br/>
		stupid the minute something unexpected happens.  I was an<br/>
Archon in<br/>
		Cazic-Thule and while they were having a picnic in the lower<br/>
throne room I<br/>
		popped a justicar, herald, and a champion to liven things up<br/>
for the<br/>
		Winnebago crowd.<br/>
<br/>
		NOTE: If you are killed by a GM/possessed NPC, you do NOT<br/>
lose exp!<br/>
<br/>
		The zone freaked, had no idea what to do.  Some mid to high<br/>
40s showed up<br/>
		and tried to take me out (they were a little, um,<br/>
foolhardy), doing shouts<br/>
		of &quot;I&#39;ll defeat him!&quot;, then -- get this -- sending in their<br/>
pets ONE AT A<br/>
		TIME.  There was a 50th necro and a 48th magician there, and<br/>
their pets are<br/>
		MEAN.  But they sent them in one at a time -- easy for me to<br/>
deal with (I<br/>
		was a 50th wizzie).  If both pets had come in, I would have<br/>
been toast.<br/>
<br/>
		Stupid stupid stupid.<br/>
<br/>
		Some of them stormed in, expecting me to be about 35th<br/>
level, and I nuked<br/>
		them instantly.  So they started whining about it being<br/>
&quot;unfair&quot;.  Someone<br/>
		else in the zone started OOCing how this was &quot;ruining&quot; their<br/>
evening because<br/>
		all they wanted to do was get some rubicite and log.<br/>
Hearing things like<br/>
		that makes me almost want to give up on the game (or its<br/>
players).<br/>
<br/>
		Anyway, instead of getting organized, they hid in the<br/>
courtyard.  Now, at<br/>
		this point I had only a small contingent of bodyguards, but<br/>
more important,<br/>
		I only had THREE spells memorized -- Ice Comet, Conflag, and<br/>
Frost Shock.<br/>
		None of those can be cast very quickly.  Two good tanks, two<br/>
clerics, and<br/>
		one wizzie could have killed me EASILY, but they refused to<br/>
come after me.<br/>
<br/>
		As I was getting bored sitting with my gorillas in the<br/>
throne room, I walked<br/>
		out into the courtyard -- ALONE -- and proceeded to cast,<br/>
killing a few<br/>
		folks.  Now here&#39;s the even sadder part -- I walked out,<br/>
alone, into a room<br/>
		of about 20 players from 20th to 50th level, AND NO ONE<br/>
BOTHERED ROOTING OR<br/>
		STUNNING ME.  They tried to kill me, but instead of taking<br/>
away my ability<br/>
		to run or cast, they just tried to kill me quick.  Then,<br/>
even stupider, two<br/>
		of the casters chased me into the maze...alone.<br/>
<br/>
		Dumb dumb dumb.<br/>
<br/>
		So I ran back to lick my wounds and hid in the throne room,<br/>
but they<br/>
		wouldn&#39;t give chase.  I finally decided that it was time for<br/>
me to die, so I<br/>
		ran to the zone border to kill people looting their corpses<br/>
(*evil grin*),<br/>
		and finally I got dropped by a nice crowd.<br/>
<br/>
		Okay, so here&#39;s the loot I dropped: full set of rubicite and<br/>
a shimmering<br/>
		silk robe.<br/>
<br/>
		And here&#39;s the point where I get miffed: if a GM is killed<br/>
in an event,<br/>
		&quot;ninja looting&quot; can happen since ANYONE can loot the corpse,<br/>
not the<br/>
		person/party responsible for most damage.  A 50th wizard<br/>
looted my corpse<br/>
		and got ALL the rubi, then said he didn&#39;t find anything.  In<br/>
addition, he<br/>
		didn&#39;t distribute it to anyone else that was in the battle<br/>
-- he kept it for<br/>
		his guild (presumably).<br/>
<br/>
		This really upset me, but because of a error on my part the<br/>
two rubi bracers<br/>
		that were dropped were in a backpack and couldn&#39;t be looted<br/>
(except by me).<br/>
		I then looted my corpse and awarded the bracers to a 42nd<br/>
level wizzie that<br/>
		played smart, fierce, and was RP the whole way.  I&#39;m still<br/>
upset that the<br/>
		50th wizzie didn&#39;t share the loot with the tanks that were<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
		At one point a 32nd level SK said something like &quot;Hey<br/>
lizzie, I&#39;m wearing<br/>
		your brother as a cloak!&quot; so I teleported to him and said<br/>
&quot;HSSSS!  THEN YOU<br/>
		DIE!&quot;  He was with a party of 30s camping near the Avatar<br/>
room.  He RAN as<br/>
		fast as he could, but his party put up a REAL good fight.  I<br/>
mean GOOD.<br/>
		They could have taken me down...almost.  I popped an Archon<br/>
that wasted most<br/>
		of them, but they nearly killed me.  But that party was<br/>
smart, organized,<br/>
		and BRAVE. I wish I had caught their names because I would<br/>
have rewarded<br/>
		them.<br/>
<br/>
		That party of low 30s had more guts and smarts than a whole<br/>
zone of 40s.<br/>
		*sigh*<br/>
<br/>
		In a way I think a lot of high level players have become<br/>
used to how things<br/>
		work, and once things stop working that way, they get really<br/>
confused and<br/>
		don&#39;t know what to do.  I think a PvP player would have done<br/>
a LOT better.<br/>
<br/>
		When I did the event on Cazic-Thule a 32nd level paladin<br/>
(wearing bronze)<br/>
		looted me, but since I had an ebony blade on me he gave it<br/>
to a ranger that<br/>
		had helped, and he also gave away the rubi pants to another<br/>
tank.  Oh, and<br/>
		on Cazic-Thule I buffed myself so that basically ONLY melee<br/>
types could kill<br/>
		me -- I gave myself insane magic resistance.  When I went<br/>
down on CT server<br/>
		I was taking about 400 points of damage per tick from 12<br/>
melee fighters,<br/>
		which is EXACTLY what I wanted since I was dropping melee<br/>
gear.  I was NOT<br/>
		going to let a wizzie get a full set of rubi again.<br/>
<br/>
		During another event, when I was the werewolf in SK,<br/>
EVERYONE kept running<br/>
		from me for the zone.  They kept trying to pull me to the<br/>
zone so they could<br/>
		fight then zone if they were getting hurt.  I wouldn&#39;t play<br/>
that way, and<br/>
		summoned a cyclops to help keep the zone clear (MWUHAHAHA).<br/>
<br/>
		During the entire SK event, I killed only TWO people.  One<br/>
of them was a<br/>
		35th level dwarven warrior wearing bronze.  He fought<br/>
bravely -- when I got<br/>
		him to one bub of health, instead of running he stood up and<br/>
went down<br/>
		swinging.  Never cried for help, never tried to run.  And<br/>
there was a crowd<br/>
		around that didn&#39;t bother healing him either.  This warrior<br/>
-- Aindolmar --<br/>
		was an exemplary example of a brave, RPing player.  I<br/>
rewarded him after my<br/>
		death (I dropped a werewolf cloak and tunic for those that<br/>
care to know)<br/>
		specifically with a crafted breastplate.  He was wielding a<br/>
BBC (I think)<br/>
		and wearing bronze with no other twinks.  He wasn&#39;t in a<br/>
guild that I could<br/>
		tell, and was playing the game &quot;legit&quot; as it were.  More<br/>
important, it<br/>
		looked like he was playing in the spirit of the game, and I<br/>
rewarded that.<br/>
<br/>
		Finally, when I was the undead vizier on the chessboard, I<br/>
was a 25th level<br/>
		wizard.  A 15th level dwarven warrior (gotta love those<br/>
dorfs!) named<br/>
		Thrombrir kept trying to rally everyone to attack me.  A<br/>
couple druids kept<br/>
		running from me -- and they were 24th and 37th level<br/>
respectively -- and<br/>
		played like complete weenies.  This warrior ran up and<br/>
started whacking on<br/>
		me, ALONE.  No party, no backup, but I was conning BRIGHT<br/>
RED to him, but he<br/>
		didn&#39;t care.  Once again, he was not a twink -- he had on<br/>
ringmail and some<br/>
		rawhide -- and he was busy RPing like crazy.<br/>
<br/>
		In that battled I dropped an FBR -- which a 42nd level necro<br/>
looted, as if<br/>
		she needed it (and I don&#39;t think she shared).  But I had<br/>
already learned not<br/>
		to reward people that looted my body -- too many selfish<br/>
types.  So now I<br/>
		keep track of players that are brave, smart (if that&#39;s in<br/>
character),<br/>
		untwinked, and role-playing, and I reward them appropriately<br/>
after the<br/>
		battle.<br/>
<br/>
		Thrombrir received crafted gauntlets and one crafted bracer<br/>
to replace his<br/>
		rawhide.<br/>
<br/>
		My point?  The lower level types played well, smart, and<br/>
were having fun,<br/>
		and the higher levels were busy screaming about things being<br/>
unfair, were<br/>
		doing dumb stuff, wouldn&#39;t leave the zone border, and<br/>
wouldn&#39;t share loot.<br/>
		Oh, and when high levels hear about an event via &quot;guildsay&quot;,<br/>
they all come<br/>
		to kill me so they can get the loot.  It&#39;s frustrating being<br/>
a 25th level<br/>
		mob and getting taken down by a 50th SK instead of a crowd<br/>
of 20s.  But I<br/>
		can&#39;t pick and choose who comes to kill me, so the best I<br/>
can do is make<br/>
		sure that the right people are rewarded.<br/>
<br/>
		An explanation of my &quot;anti-twinking&quot; policy is probably in<br/>
order for those<br/>
		of you in a guild or that are twinked:<br/>
<br/>
		- these events are role playing events.  All the ones I<br/>
described I did<br/>
		alone without any input from others, in an attempt to spice<br/>
up the game for<br/>
		some folks.  As such, I reward role players.<br/>
<br/>
		- I don&#39;t reward twinks because, well, they don&#39;t need the<br/>
stuff and often<br/>
		don&#39;t appreciate what they received.  There was an 11th<br/>
level wizzie wearing<br/>
		an FBR at the chessboard, and I killed him THREE times =)<br/>
<br/>
		- the players that really need the gear are often the ones<br/>
least willing to<br/>
		sacrifice their ideals (camping/twinking) to get the gear.<br/>
By rewarding<br/>
		these players in events like these it spreads good word of<br/>
mouth, and more<br/>
		important, instills a sense of faith that they&#39;ve been doing<br/>
the right thing<br/>
		by RPing instead of power gaming.<br/>
<br/>
		Anyway, I await your flames :-)<br/>
<br/>
