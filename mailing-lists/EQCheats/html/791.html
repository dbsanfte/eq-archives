&gt; That is the part that truely amazes me. Besides the fact that he<br/>
&gt; actually told the<br/>
&gt; entire world about it as well. Lemac&#39;s email details actually what his<br/>
&gt; lawyer should<br/>
&gt; have told him to the first place. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think all this sean guy has to do to win the case now is just walk<br/>
&gt; in to court with<br/>
&gt; printouts of this thread. Might even be evidence for a counter suit.<br/>
&gt; (Mental anguish<br/>
&gt; and  lost wages seems to be a popluar cry for money) It would be<br/>
&gt; interesting (once<br/>
&gt; again if we cared) to find out how that would turn out if it actually<br/>
&gt; ever happened.<br/>

&gt; &gt; How can he charge a proof-reading fee if he never read it?<br/>

&gt; &gt;Lemme get this straight, someone was sending him email that<br/>
&gt; &gt; he didn&#39;t want (spam?)<br/>
&gt; &gt;and in an effort to stop it told the guy that he would<br/>
&gt; &gt; charge him a fee for reading<br/>
&gt; &gt;his email. THEN doesn&#39;t read the email that was sent to him<br/>
&gt; &gt; and is planning on going<br/>
&gt; &gt;to small claims court to get the fee? THEN he spams us about<br/>
&gt; &gt; it like we cared?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I agree with the others on the list, Nick is silly indeed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Amazes me how people<br/>
&gt; &gt;refuse to use something as simple as a killist and think<br/>
&gt; &gt; this method would be a<br/>
&gt; &gt;better solution.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, I warned this person to stop emailing me.  As per my<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; lawyers request I had<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; warned him before not to email me or a proof reading fee<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; would be exempted to his<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; university/his parents.  He sent me an email this morning<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; that was lengthy and I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; didn&#39;t even bother reading it.  Again (to the people of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the list), do not send me<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; private emails.  Mr. Clark is going to have to go to small<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; claims court because of his actions.<br/>
