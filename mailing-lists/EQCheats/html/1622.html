<div id="ygrps-yiv-887744039"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;ve heard that you can hex edit the Tutorial.exe so that you can view any <br/>
&gt; zone in the game free of mobs.  I was just wondering how exactly you do <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  What files to open with what, which lines of code to replace, etc.  Thanks<br/>
&gt; in advance.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is an application out there you can use... if i find the link I will <br/>
send it on. Anyone else have it handy?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually I found it about 10 minutes after I sent the mail (isn&#39;t that always the way?)  Just FYI for the rest of you.. in HackersQuest&#39;s FAQ they give you directions on how to modify the tutorial, and a link to a hex editor that you need to do it.  Or, if you want to do it the easy way, they also have a link for a program that does it all for you.  I suggest copying the tutorial and renaming it so you can keep the original if you mess it up somehow, tho if you&#39;re paying attention it really isn&#39;t tough to do.  Here&#39;s the link:<br/>
