<div id="ygrps-yiv-257575312">Yes but the ice comment quest should be difficult as it is for high level<br/>
wizards (minus of the bugs of course, that isn&#39;t good).  If they make the<br/>
rubi quests like they did the crafted armor quest I think it will work out<br/>
well.  Make it necessary for high priced gems and a fairly accessible<br/>
dropped item from multiple mobs and it will go well.  The jboots should<br/>
require a few rubies and maybe the feathers of a griffon.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Keep reading the news, though.  Instead of being dropped by a mob it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to be through a class specific quest (details not known yet).<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hopefully they will make it so that only that class can do it and change<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; warrior crafted quest where only warriors can do it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am sure they will make that quests extremely buggy and insane difficult<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; complete as all later introducing quests. For example, quest for Ice Comet<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; buggy from beggining for several weeks, casters research quests was made<br/>
&gt; in such<br/>
&gt; manner so its more easy to train research in traditional way, quests for<br/>
&gt; Necro&#39;s<br/>
&gt; high level pet words are so hards so it is much more easy to find the<br/>
&gt; proper<br/>
&gt; words from regular high level mobs. Sure, it will be nightmare at Drelzna<br/>
&gt; room<br/>
&gt; in next 2 days :)<br/>
