<b>Subject:</b> Bag of TINKERER&#39;s Information... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-965072254">Hello all! Well met all you fellow EQ &quot;Cheaters.&quot; he he! Well... I&#39;m fairly <br/>
new to the list and wanted to change things up a bit and touch on 2 new <br/>
subjects...<br/>
<br/>
1) Where in the world can you find a BAG OF TINKERER? I&#39;ve only read about <br/>
this item and never seen one in game. I understand that it&#39;s 10-Slots and <br/>
everything placed inside is WEIGHTLESS!!! Wow! Is this bought from a hidden <br/>
NPC? Looted from a MOB? Who knows? Anyone with any information on this care <br/>
to share?<br/>
<br/>
2) I am also interested in MAXIMUM POWER GAMING! Oh no... let the RP&#39;ers <br/>
flame begin. he he! What I mean is this... Can someone direct me to a web <br/>
site or provide our fine list of &quot;cheaters&quot; some SOLID information on what <br/>
MOBS provide the BEST xp at what level(s). Surely this information must be <br/>
out there somewhere... Or better yet, let&#39;s start a list and share our own <br/>
experiences on what we have found individually that gives GREAT xp at <br/>
certain levels.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my contribution on the Fastest XP/Level discussion... I just recently <br/>
started a Wizard and I was AMAZED how fast my XP rose while fighting GIANT <br/>
BATS in BBlock Mountains at level 8-9. The bats don&#39;t SWARM to protect each <br/>
other and there are always plenty to be found at night in the area around <br/>
the crossroads.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else? I assume that I can speak for all of us when I say &quot;All <br/>
levels/zones/MOBS would be GREATLY appreciated! Let&#39;s gain some XP thru our <br/>
group! BTW... I tend to SOLO a lot due to &quot;multitasking&quot; at home during the <br/>
night. You know... family stuff. he he! The tip on the Giant Bats was a SOLO <br/>
tip.<br/>
<br/>
Until next time... great &quot;CHEATING&quot; (errr... sharing knowlege) and best of <br/>
luck in NORRATH!<br/>
