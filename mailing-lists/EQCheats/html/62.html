Grouping with someone was my way to get to know them...<br/>

 &gt; &gt; Someone could &quot;bind affinity&quot; to you where you would get killed after getting killed.<br/>
 &gt; <br/>
 &gt; Bah that is no exploit. In order for someone to bind you, two conditions<br/>
 &gt; must be met. First and foremost, they have to be in your party. Being in<br/>
 &gt; your party means you trust them (or that you are a frickin idiot to join<br/>
 &gt; their party without knowing them) and give consent. The second condition<br/>
 &gt; is that a spellcaster can only bind people in city areas (Highhold Pass<br/>
 &gt; is considered a city however).<br/>
