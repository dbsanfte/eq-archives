<div id="ygrps-yiv-896742710">I was hoping for some new druid quests...  a good variety would be nice,<br/>
even if it&#39;s not for full armor, but just a few things that would help us<br/>
out, and not be something that every other class wants as well.<br/>

&gt; Verant Hates Druids. Or should I say Brad hates Druids. Just look at the<br/>
AC<br/>
&gt; of our PoF Stuff. Our Boots are AC 6 where Clerics boots are AC 15. Shesh<br/>
&gt; Casters didn&#39;t lose any thing Rubi Yet they have Amor Quest in the Temple.<br/>
&gt; Oh Well. I still like my Druid, but could still use some better armor &<br/>
&gt; Weapons<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have heard that druids will NOT be getting new stuff. They didn&#39;t loose<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; with Rubi anyways. *shrug* I think Verant likes Druids less than Shamans<br/>
;-)<br/>
