<div id="ygrps-yiv-939710760">clear up a quick misconception real quick.<br/>
<br/>
The one people were getting banned for was NOT SHOWEQ this one runs on linux and<br/>
      is for all purposes .<br/>
<br/>
COMPLETELY UNSEEN BY EQ.  unless you are a braggart in game like i know one<br/>
      person was.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The one that everone was getting busted over is/was  a 3rd party calling it<br/>
      showeq for windows (its now defunt i think).<br/>
<br/>
There is a diffrence<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And yes i know not because i run them (i did run the windows for a to check it<br/>
      out) but that thing was as much a pain to use and monitor if not worse<br/>
      than camping.<br/>
<br/>
AND GOD I HATE CAMPING...was fun to see everythings level and stuff but hey its<br/>
      got 32000 HP i knew i couldnt kill it before then.....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The windows version is what got Verant to changing the encryption like ever 3<br/>
      days, just too many people could use it.<br/>
<br/>
The linux version, well some people are still gonna use it. but they cant see it<br/>
      and id guess about 95%+&#39;s not gonna have a clue on how to even install it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The real problem with this is not they can see special spawns, but on PVP<br/>
      servers.....this is but one reason i wont play on&#39;em<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Flame if you want, but then again i really dont care if you do, lower yourself<br/>
      to those standards.<br/>
<br/>
At that point i dont even bother, cant argue with Kids, the IRS, or your wife.</div>
