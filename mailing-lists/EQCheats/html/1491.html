 </span></blockquote>Well, my understanding is that you don&#39;t need to give them to a caster<br/>
to have them identified. Simply pick up the item in question with you<br/>
cursor then have the caster target you and cast the spell. Whatever<br/>
the targeted player is &quot;holding&quot; (ie Floating on the cursor) will be<br/>
indentified.<br/>
<br/>
It took a little bit of trial and error, but I finally figured out<br/>
that that is how the spell works. I am a wizzie and when I cast the<br/>
spell, it would tell me that I didn&#39;t have a target. So I targeted<br/>
myself, and then it told me that I wasn&#39;t &quot;holding&quot; anything. That<br/>
took a while to realize I could have an object on my cursor and still<br/>
fire off a spell. :)<br/>
<br/>
I have never tried it on other people, but I don&#39;t see why it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
work on them either.</div>
