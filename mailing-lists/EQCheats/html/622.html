<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013198858">JOHNDREW!!!!!   Hey there hon!!  How are you? So, you are still in DR, eh?<br/>
Well, Michael quit EQ and went back to DR...yep yep, left me a widow in EQ.<br/>
But I really had gotten bored with DR and simply couldn&#39;t get back into it,<br/>
and didn&#39;t have time for both, so I shelved DR.  Still have Aderes and<br/>
NIkira and Teira, but don&#39;t plan on playing it again, unless I get really<br/>
bored or tired with EQ.  Besides, DR was 3 times as expensive as EQ, which<br/>
to me is ridiculous.  Simutronics is not customer friendly, and that&#39;s<br/>
another reason I left.<br/>
<br/>
Yah, you two folks poke your heads into Rathe sometime...I have my little<br/>
newbie druid Tiasha, who is only 11.  She&#39;s hunting in oasis.  Of course<br/>
Mikaela is almost 47 now, so she plays with the big boys in lguk, nagefen&#39;s<br/>
lair and permafrost en route to Vox.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;big hugs to ya&gt;<br/>
<br/>
