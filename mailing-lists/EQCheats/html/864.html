				Sorry, I was in a hurry and didn&#39;t disclose<br/>
my source.<br/>
		Brian Hook posted an<br/>
				account of the encounter on the errangers<br/>
list.  What I was<br/>
		saying is that<br/>
				Hast denied that there was any treasure at<br/>
the time.  I<br/>
		didn&#39;t say he didn&#39;t<br/>
				tell anyone about it after the fact.  And<br/>
how can you say<br/>
		that he alone<br/>
				earned the loot of that MOB?  There were<br/>
dozens of people<br/>
		there all helping<br/>
				to kill the Archon and lesser critters that<br/>
had been<br/>
		summoned.<br/>
				Unfortunately, he did not even necessarily<br/>
do the most<br/>
		damage, since GM<br/>
				controlled NPC&#39;s are open for anyone to loot<br/>
after they are<br/>
		killed.  Here is<br/>
				Brian&#39;s post to the ranger list.<br/>
<br/>
				From: &quot;Brian Hook&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bhook@...">bhook@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
				I have some spare time this week, and as<br/>
such I&#39;ve been<br/>
		doing some GM events<br/>
				after hours on various servers (I was Morxxa<br/>
Mangyfur the<br/>
		Werewolf in SK on<br/>
				Tunare; the named Archon in Cazic-Thule on<br/>
Cazic-Thule and<br/>
		Xegony; the<br/>
				Undead Vizier on the chessboard on<br/>
Cazic-Thule; Frumpy<br/>
		Darkpaw in<br/>
				blackburrow on Cazic-Thule), and I&#39;ve<br/>
learned some<br/>
		interesting things about<br/>
				players in general.<br/>
<br/>
				First, higher level players are weenies.<br/>
It&#39;s that simple.<br/>
		The minute a<br/>
				fight turns against them, they&#39;re zoning.<br/>
They&#39;re also<br/>
		generally very<br/>
				stupid the minute something unexpected<br/>
happens.  I was an<br/>
		Archon in<br/>
				Cazic-Thule and while they were having a<br/>
picnic in the lower<br/>
		throne room I<br/>
				popped a justicar, herald, and a champion to<br/>
liven things up<br/>
		for the<br/>
				Winnebago crowd.<br/>
<br/>
				NOTE: If you are killed by a GM/possessed<br/>
NPC, you do NOT<br/>
		lose exp!<br/>
<br/>
				The zone freaked, had no idea what to do.<br/>
Some mid to high<br/>
		40s showed up<br/>
				and tried to take me out (they were a<br/>
little, um,<br/>
		foolhardy), doing shouts<br/>
				of &quot;I&#39;ll defeat him!&quot;, then -- get this --<br/>
sending in their<br/>
		pets ONE AT A<br/>
				TIME.  There was a 50th necro and a 48th<br/>
magician there, and<br/>
		their pets are<br/>
				MEAN.  But they sent them in one at a time<br/>
-- easy for me to<br/>
		deal with (I<br/>
				was a 50th wizzie).  If both pets had come<br/>
in, I would have<br/>
		been toast.<br/>
<br/>
				Stupid stupid stupid.<br/>
<br/>
				Some of them stormed in, expecting me to be<br/>
about 35th<br/>
		level, and I nuked<br/>
				them instantly.  So they started whining<br/>
about it being<br/>
		&quot;unfair&quot;.  Someone<br/>
				else in the zone started OOCing how this was<br/>
&quot;ruining&quot; their<br/>
		evening because<br/>
				all they wanted to do was get some rubicite<br/>
and log.<br/>
		Hearing things like<br/>
				that makes me almost want to give up on the<br/>
game (or its<br/>
		players).<br/>
<br/>
				Anyway, instead of getting organized, they<br/>
hid in the<br/>
		courtyard.  Now, at<br/>
				this point I had only a small contingent of<br/>
bodyguards, but<br/>
		more important,<br/>
				I only had THREE spells memorized -- Ice<br/>
Comet, Conflag, and<br/>
		Frost Shock.<br/>
				None of those can be cast very quickly.  Two<br/>
good tanks, two<br/>
		clerics, and<br/>
				one wizzie could have killed me EASILY, but<br/>
they refused to<br/>
		come after me.<br/>
<br/>
				As I was getting bored sitting with my<br/>
gorillas in the<br/>
		throne room, I walked<br/>
				out into the courtyard -- ALONE -- and<br/>
proceeded to cast,<br/>
		killing a few<br/>
				folks.  Now here&#39;s the even sadder part -- I<br/>
walked out,<br/>
		alone, into a room<br/>
				of about 20 players from 20th to 50th level,<br/>
AND NO ONE<br/>
		BOTHERED ROOTING OR<br/>
				STUNNING ME.  They tried to kill me, but<br/>
instead of taking<br/>
		away my ability<br/>
				to run or cast, they just tried to kill me<br/>
quick.  Then,<br/>
		even stupider, two<br/>
				of the casters chased me into the<br/>
maze...alone.<br/>
<br/>
				Dumb dumb dumb.<br/>
<br/>
				So I ran back to lick my wounds and hid in<br/>
the throne room,<br/>
		but they<br/>
				wouldn&#39;t give chase.  I finally decided that<br/>
it was time for<br/>
		me to die, so I<br/>
				ran to the zone border to kill people<br/>
looting their corpses<br/>
		(*evil grin*),<br/>
				and finally I got dropped by a nice crowd.<br/>
<br/>
				Okay, so here&#39;s the loot I dropped: full set<br/>
of rubicite and<br/>
		a shimmering<br/>
				silk robe.<br/>
<br/>
				And here&#39;s the point where I get miffed: if<br/>
a GM is killed<br/>
		in an event,<br/>
				&quot;ninja looting&quot; can happen since ANYONE can<br/>
loot the corpse,<br/>
		not the<br/>
				person/party responsible for most damage.  A<br/>
50th wizard<br/>
		looted my corpse<br/>
				and got ALL the rubi, then said he didn&#39;t<br/>
find anything.  In<br/>
		addition, he<br/>
				didn&#39;t distribute it to anyone else that was<br/>
in the battle<br/>
		-- he kept it for<br/>
				his guild (presumably).<br/>
<br/>
				This really upset me, but because of a error<br/>
on my part the<br/>
		two rubi bracers<br/>
				that were dropped were in a backpack and<br/>
couldn&#39;t be looted<br/>
		(except by me).<br/>
				I then looted my corpse and awarded the<br/>
bracers to a 42nd<br/>
		level wizzie that<br/>
				played smart, fierce, and was RP the whole<br/>
way.  I&#39;m still<br/>
		upset that the<br/>
				50th wizzie didn&#39;t share the loot with the<br/>
tanks that were<br/>
		there.<br/>
<br/>
				At one point a 32nd level SK said something<br/>
like &quot;Hey<br/>
		lizzie, I&#39;m wearing<br/>
				your brother as a cloak!&quot; so I teleported to<br/>
him and said<br/>
		&quot;HSSSS!  THEN YOU<br/>
				DIE!&quot;  He was with a party of 30s camping<br/>
near the Avatar<br/>
		room.  He RAN as<br/>
				fast as he could, but his party put up a<br/>
REAL good fight.  I<br/>
		mean GOOD.<br/>
				They could have taken me down...almost.  I<br/>
popped an Archon<br/>
		that wasted most<br/>
				of them, but they nearly killed me.  But<br/>
that party was<br/>
		smart, organized,<br/>
				and BRAVE. I wish I had caught their names<br/>
because I would<br/>
		have rewarded<br/>
				them.<br/>
<br/>
				That party of low 30s had more guts and<br/>
smarts than a whole<br/>
		zone of 40s.<br/>
				*sigh*<br/>
<br/>
				In a way I think a lot of high level players<br/>
have become<br/>
		used to how things<br/>
				work, and once things stop working that way,<br/>
they get really<br/>
		confused and<br/>
				don&#39;t know what to do.  I think a PvP player<br/>
would have done<br/>
		a LOT better.<br/>
<br/>
				When I did the event on Cazic-Thule a 32nd<br/>
level paladin<br/>
		(wearing bronze)<br/>
				looted me, but since I had an ebony blade on<br/>
me he gave it<br/>
		to a ranger that<br/>
				had helped, and he also gave away the rubi<br/>
pants to another<br/>
		tank.  Oh, and<br/>
				on Cazic-Thule I buffed myself so that<br/>
basically ONLY melee<br/>
		types could kill<br/>
				me -- I gave myself insane magic resistance.<br/>
When I went<br/>
		down on CT server<br/>
				I was taking about 400 points of damage per<br/>
tick from 12<br/>
		melee fighters,<br/>
				which is EXACTLY what I wanted since I was<br/>
dropping melee<br/>
		gear.  I was NOT<br/>
				going to let a wizzie get a full set of rubi<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
				During another event, when I was the<br/>
werewolf in SK,<br/>
		EVERYONE kept running<br/>
				from me for the zone.  They kept trying to<br/>
pull me to the<br/>
		zone so they could<br/>
				fight then zone if they were getting hurt.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t play<br/>
		that way, and<br/>
				summoned a cyclops to help keep the zone<br/>
clear (MWUHAHAHA).<br/>
<br/>
				During the entire SK event, I killed only<br/>
TWO people.  One<br/>
		of them was a<br/>
				35th level dwarven warrior wearing bronze.<br/>
He fought<br/>
		bravely -- when I got<br/>
				him to one bub of health, instead of running<br/>
he stood up and<br/>
		went down<br/>
				swinging.  Never cried for help, never tried<br/>
to run.  And<br/>
		there was a crowd<br/>
				around that didn&#39;t bother healing him<br/>
either.  This warrior<br/>
		-- Aindolmar --<br/>
				was an exemplary example of a brave, RPing<br/>
player.  I<br/>
		rewarded him after my<br/>
				death (I dropped a werewolf cloak and tunic<br/>
for those that<br/>
		care to know)<br/>
				specifically with a crafted breastplate.  He<br/>
was wielding a<br/>
		BBC (I think)<br/>
				and wearing bronze with no other twinks.  He<br/>
wasn&#39;t in a<br/>
		guild that I could<br/>
				tell, and was playing the game &quot;legit&quot; as it<br/>
were.  More<br/>
		important, it<br/>
				looked like he was playing in the spirit of<br/>
the game, and I<br/>
		rewarded that.<br/>
<br/>
				Finally, when I was the undead vizier on the<br/>
chessboard, I<br/>
		was a 25th level<br/>
				wizard.  A 15th level dwarven warrior (gotta<br/>
love those<br/>
		dorfs!) named<br/>
				Thrombrir kept trying to rally everyone to<br/>
attack me.  A<br/>
		couple druids kept<br/>
				running from me -- and they were 24th and<br/>
37th level<br/>
		respectively -- and<br/>
				played like complete weenies.  This warrior<br/>
ran up and<br/>
		started whacking on<br/>
				me, ALONE.  No party, no backup, but I was<br/>
conning BRIGHT<br/>
		RED to him, but he<br/>
				didn&#39;t care.  Once again, he was not a twink<br/>
-- he had on<br/>
		ringmail and some<br/>
				rawhide -- and he was busy RPing like crazy.<br/>
<br/>
				In that battled I dropped an FBR -- which a<br/>
42nd level necro<br/>
		looted, as if<br/>
				she needed it (and I don&#39;t think she<br/>
shared).  But I had<br/>
		already learned not<br/>
				to reward people that looted my body -- too<br/>
many selfish<br/>
		types.  So now I<br/>
				keep track of players that are brave, smart<br/>
(if that&#39;s in<br/>
		character),<br/>
				untwinked, and role-playing, and I reward<br/>
them appropriately<br/>
		after the<br/>
				battle.<br/>
<br/>
				Thrombrir received crafted gauntlets and one<br/>
crafted bracer<br/>
		to replace his<br/>
				rawhide.<br/>
<br/>
				My point?  The lower level types played<br/>
well, smart, and<br/>
		were having fun,<br/>
				and the higher levels were busy screaming<br/>
about things being<br/>
		unfair, were<br/>
				doing dumb stuff, wouldn&#39;t leave the zone<br/>
border, and<br/>
		wouldn&#39;t share loot.<br/>
				Oh, and when high levels hear about an event<br/>
via &quot;guildsay&quot;,<br/>
		they all come<br/>
				to kill me so they can get the loot.  It&#39;s<br/>
frustrating being<br/>
		a 25th level<br/>
				mob and getting taken down by a 50th SK<br/>
instead of a crowd<br/>
		of 20s.  But I<br/>
				can&#39;t pick and choose who comes to kill me,<br/>
so the best I<br/>
		can do is make<br/>
				sure that the right people are rewarded.<br/>
<br/>
				An explanation of my &quot;anti-twinking&quot; policy<br/>
is probably in<br/>
		order for those<br/>
				of you in a guild or that are twinked:<br/>
<br/>
				- these events are role playing events.  All<br/>
the ones I<br/>
		described I did<br/>
				alone without any input from others, in an<br/>
attempt to spice<br/>
		up the game for<br/>
				some folks.  As such, I reward role players.<br/>
<br/>
				- I don&#39;t reward twinks because, well, they<br/>
don&#39;t need the<br/>
		stuff and often<br/>
				don&#39;t appreciate what they received.  There<br/>
was an 11th<br/>
		level wizzie wearing<br/>
				an FBR at the chessboard, and I killed him<br/>
THREE times =)<br/>
<br/>
				- the players that really need the gear are<br/>
often the ones<br/>
		least willing to<br/>
				sacrifice their ideals (camping/twinking) to<br/>
get the gear.<br/>
		By rewarding<br/>
				these players in events like these it<br/>
spreads good word of<br/>
		mouth, and more<br/>
				important, instills a sense of faith that<br/>
they&#39;ve been doing<br/>
		the right thing<br/>
				by RPing instead of power gaming.<br/>
<br/>
				Anyway, I await your flames :-)<br/>
