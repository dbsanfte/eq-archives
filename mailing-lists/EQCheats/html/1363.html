<div id="ygrps-yiv-355202787">Just a note on camping the bar room, If you stand behind the counter, the other 2 or 3 gobs that spawn in that room wont attack you... Im not sure if this is a bug or not, but stand back where the bartender spawns and you are completely safe from the other gobs in the room, as long as you dont come out from behind there.. you can even kill anything that spawns behind the bar. Of course if you aggro the other ones in the room then go behind the bar, they will follow :)<br/>

 able to find squat...<br/>
 <br/>
 Or, any info would be nice... How many things would there be to fight at<br/>
 32nd level? Could I safely go in an check things out without getting<br/>
 attacked by every other mob there? Normal Invis work or there undead types?<br/>
 <br/>
 Thanks +AD4APg-<br/>

You could do well in the Bartender room with a good group or even solo maybe. <br/>
 Bartender spawns fairly often and drops Drake Hide Leggings.  I was only <br/>
23rd lvl when I camped the bar room with 2 full groups of guildmates.  There <br/>
is also a Goblin Drunkard that drops a foreman tunic I think.  I just <br/>
scratched the surface of SOL A and I know there is a lot of other good stuff <br/>
there.  I saw no Undead there, but there are spellcasting gobs like in <br/>
Runnyeye who may be able to see invisi. <br/>
<br/>
Just so you know, Sol A can get real rough.  While we held the bar room for 5 <br/>
hours with only one death (er, me - thank god for resurections) and got 7 <br/>
pairs of drake hide leggings (wohooo+ACE-) in the final hour (the 6th) our 32 lvl <br/>
Monk went to pull and somehow came back with a huge train.  I mean HUGE+ACEAIQAh-  <br/>
and then the room spawn occured. AHHHHHHH.  The battle raged for about 7 <br/>
minutes and in the end, 11 guildmates, half over lvl 30, lay dead and one <br/>
frail, scared out of his robe wizard sat medding (no mana to gate - <br/>
ahhhhhhhh) surrounded by 3 goblins who survived.  The gobs just stood over me <br/>
not attacking as I tried to med up enough mana to gate.  I&#39;ve never been so <br/>
scared in my life.  Afraid to stand up and gate for fear of gaining thier <br/>
attention, I cried for help to the other folks in the dungeon - no help came. <br/>
 I decided to go for the gate, standing up literally under the chin of a <br/>
goblin wizard, I appprehensivley began reciting the words for my gate spell <br/>
hoping the gobs would not hear.  They did not, or they wanted me to live so I <br/>
could spread the word about the worst massacre I&#39;ve ever seen.  Safely gating <br/>
back to High Hold Keep, I have yet to return to Sol A, but will revenge my <br/>
bothers deaths someday.<br/>
