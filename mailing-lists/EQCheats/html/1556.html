<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625319073">hehehe, whatever I&#39;m doing invloves hanging out in the bank and eventually a <br/>
high level caster will see a young one so they want to help, give you stuff, <br/>
and then you sell it for the money (or keep it if you want it :).<br/>
<br/>
I have a few scemes...first I&#39;m in Qeynos already so I&#39;m going to gather a <br/>
bunch of Gold Ear Studs (as many as I feel like camping for) then run over <br/>
to the faydarks (stop in steamfont on the way for spiderling silk).  Then <br/>
sell off the earrings about as far from Qeynos as you can get, sell the <br/>
spiderling silk to bards (it&#39;s a quest there) and repeat the silk thing.  <br/>
that might work.  I donno.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help I&#39;ll give those batwings a try I think... :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
