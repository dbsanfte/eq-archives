<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788543899">Lemme get this straight, someone was sending him email that he didn&#39;t want (spam?)<br/>
and in an effort to stop it told the guy that he would charge him a fee for reading<br/>
his email. THEN doesn&#39;t read the email that was sent to him and is planning on going<br/>
to small claims court to get the fee? THEN he spams us about it like we cared?<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the others on the list, Nick is silly indeed. Amazes me how people<br/>
refuse to use something as simple as a killist and think this method would be a<br/>
better solution.<br/>

&gt; Well, I warned this person to stop emailing me.  As per my lawyers request I had<br/>
&gt; warned him before not to email me or a proof reading fee would be exempted to his<br/>
&gt; university/his parents.  He sent me an email this morning that was lengthy and I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t even bother reading it.  Again (to the people of the list), do not send me<br/>
&gt; private emails.  Mr. Clark is going to have to go to small claims court because of<br/>
&gt; his actions. </span></blockquote></div>
