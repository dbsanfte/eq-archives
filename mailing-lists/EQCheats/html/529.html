 Your theory is correct, when in a battle, if a person in your party is<br/>
charmed, he will NOT get xp for anything killed during the duration of the<br/>
charm...<br/>

 On a related note:  On that foray against the evil eye....  The other 5<br/>
 people all got charmed in our group...  they started attacking while I<br/>
was<br/>
 AFK, so I got there halfway through the battle.  I unloaded all my manna<br/>
at<br/>
 the eye and successfully killed it.  I got an experience message, but<br/>
nobody<br/>
 else in the group did.  My current theory is that once you are charmed,<br/>
you<br/>
 count as a monster, and won&#39;t get the experience message for any group<br/>
kills<br/>
 during that time.  Unfortunately, this is also hard to test.<br/>
Unfortunately<br/>
 that mishap resulted in the death of more than half our party... but when<br/>
I<br/>
 looked at my XP-o-meter, I got a huge chunk of XP from the fight (if my<br/>
 theory is correct, I got all of the XP)<br/>

 When fighting evil eyes in the gorge the other night, I hit the sit<br/>
button<br/>
 while charmed somehow. The result was canceling the charm, which allowed<br/>
me<br/>
 to continue with my battle. I managed to do this repeatedly throughout<br/>
the<br/>
 night. This could be a coincidence or an actual bug in the game, I&#39;m not<br/>
 sure. Since I felt it was cheating, I quit doing it and left the gorge+ADs-<br/>
 after all, I only wanted another Polished Bone Bracer +ADs-)<br/>
