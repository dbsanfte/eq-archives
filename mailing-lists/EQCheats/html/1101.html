<b>Subject:</b> Quest Submission -- off topic <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860185746">One of the GM&#39;s gave me an e-mail address that he said we could use to<br/>
submit quest ideas.  It sounded like he wanted full blown stories and all.<br/>
It would prolly make their jobs easier to have players do it for them.  His<br/>
address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jellis@...">jellis@...</a>.  He said he would delete without reading<br/>
anything that has nothing to do with quests, including buggy quests.  I<br/>
think he wanted things as detailed as possible if you wanted to submit them.<br/>
I know this is off-topic.  I apologize, but reading the posts about the<br/>
server emulator (which would be awesome) and the original quests reminded<br/>
me.</div>
