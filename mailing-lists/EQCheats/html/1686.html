<b>Subject:</b> ShowEQ Question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289788190">First off, let me say that I personally do not Use ShowEQ or any <br/>
other method of cheating in the game,... I just have a question about <br/>
it. Can the person who is using ShowEQ see other players Text box? or <br/>
can they see other players personal messages? If yes,... isn&#39;t that <br/>
illegal? That&#39;s invasion of privacy!</div>
