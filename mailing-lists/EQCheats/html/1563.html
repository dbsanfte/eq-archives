<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699768782">About the cloaks...what kind of skin/pelt do you need to turn in and what <br/>
kind or critter drops them most often?  I&#39;m guessing Polar Bears do but we <br/>
all know that EQ doesn&#39;t need to make sense all the time :).<br/>
<br/>
and...does anyone know how much these skins/pelts go for if I were to go <br/>
there and auction to buy them (save on hunting time).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
