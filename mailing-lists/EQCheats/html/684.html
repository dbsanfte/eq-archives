Well..... to all of you bitching about how people<br/>
were making 40 plat an hour by selling pie-tins...<br/>
Verant&#39;s last change has made it possible for some<br/>
people to make about 8,000 plat in 20 minutes. How?<br/>
Well.... those of us that used pottery often,<br/>
especially the evil races, kept sketches in the bank.<br/>
I, for one, had 8 back packs full of sketches plus a<br/>
back pack full on my character at the time I loggerd<br/>
out teh night before the day of the last update. I<br/>
figured i could at least use what sketches I had<br/>
saved up to make more pie-tins and thus a little more<br/>
money. well... I log in after the update.... the<br/>
sketches I have that used to be purchased for a<br/>
silver and some odd coin sells for about a plat or<br/>
so... no big deal. BUT, I can sell my SKETCHES back<br/>
to a VENDOR for about 5 gold eac.... they used to<br/>
sell for like 8 copper back to a vendor.<br/>
<br/>
So... lets do some math here... thats 9 back<br/>
packs.... each back pack has 160 sketches in it...<br/>
and each sketch sells for 5 gopld each. Hmmm.....<br/>
<br/>
I have heard of some people that thought ahead and<br/>
had multiple characters with inventories and banks<br/>
full of sketches that made ungodly sums of money<br/>
after the last update. <br/>
<br/>
In effect.... Verant&#39;s attempt at fixing the game<br/>
economy has effectively destroyed it for some people.<br/>
But hey, I&#39;m not bitchin&#39;. At least I didn&#39;t have to<br/>
stand infront of a potttery wheel for hours on end to<br/>
make a lot of money.... and it didn&#39;t require me to<br/>
have any skill at all... hehe.<br/>
