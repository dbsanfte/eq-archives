&gt;Heh - you might see that anyway.  Last night I saw a level 10 wizard in<br/>
&gt;a flowing black robe, shimmering orb, and one of those skull staves<br/>
&gt;running from an orc centurion in the E. Commonlands.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;--<br/>
&gt;We cross our bridges when we come to them and burn them behind us,<br/>
&gt;with nothing to show for our progress but the memory of the smell<br/>
&gt;of smoke and the presumption that once our eyes watered.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m afraid he&#39;s correct. Twinking is at an all time how now. The &quot;player run <br/>
economy&quot; is all but non existant. Everything&#39;s falling apart. And now people <br/>
are getting bored and are starting to hack at EQ. What&#39;s next? Let me guess. <br/>
Verant&#39;s going to release a patch that allows the sky to fall. But it&#39;ll fix <br/>
EVERYTHING as usual. &gt;8)</div>
