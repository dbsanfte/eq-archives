<div id="ygrps-yiv-949094828">Somone asked about improving faction with Rivervale Clerics. I know of only<br/>
one and it seems to have been pulled or I am at a maximum faction with them<br/>
<br/>
Get the squad ring quest completed and everytime you turn in ring to Hendi<br/>
she will give you pluses with Clerics.<br/>
<br/>
However I dont get them anymore. I lost it around the time they made rings<br/>
nodrop to prevent the assholes from scamming people for money for them. The<br/>
ring is a faction based reward so if you didnt earn it you couldnt get it<br/>
recharged and people were selling them for 80pp and when the victim turned<br/>
it it it poofed and the seller went back and got it again. and resold it...<br/>
may have been a coincidence but it seemed to quit giving me faction on<br/>
recharge then.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that I never found any faction improvements for them... they are<br/>
PriestsofMischief.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe making honeyjum will do it. Its another all its own quest. It improves<br/>
a lot factions I just cant remember all who.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in Rivervale quests above they are on my website. I<br/>
only have a few zones up right now as I am verifying them all myself if I<br/>
can.<br/>
