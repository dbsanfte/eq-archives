<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919955446">Hmm.. I&#39;ve had the same problem numerous times...  Fighting<br/>
just fine, then next thing I can&#39;t press any of the hot keys.    I type /q<br/>
and the game quits, and I rejoin, it&#39;s as if I was linkdead for a period of<br/>
time, as I&#39;m still with my group, but now everything works dandy.<br/>

			Hi!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>			I had almost same problems in PK battles on Tallon<br/>
Zek. Even over 15 min<br/>
			after battle game interface didnt function. I was<br/>
able to walk using<br/>
			keyboard, turn around with mouse, but no hotkey or<br/>
spell were working.<br/>
			Screen mode switching too, and i havnt been even<br/>
able to camp because i<br/>
			play in &quot;full screen&quot; mode and camp button was<br/>
unreachable. That<br/>
			happened to me 3 times, all times i was combating<br/>
with necromancers and<br/>
			enchanters. I believe problem is some enchanter<br/>
spell, because i was<br/>
			fighting with necros many times and only if<br/>
enchanter was nearby i was<br/>
			facing such problem. I was feared and charmed before<br/>
and it never cause<br/>
			me such problems, so single charm or fear is ok.<br/>
Maybe some combo can<br/>
			cause this, like fear+charm or fear+root or<br/>
something like it. I believe<br/>
			enchanter spell of 8-12 lvl is required to cause<br/>
such problems, because<br/>
			in fights against 20+ lvl enchanters i never<br/>
experienced this problem,<br/>
			only in fights with 8-12 lvl ones. BTW, my friend<br/>
was in same situation<br/>
			even more times than me, and he also crashed to<br/>
Windows once, and once<br/>
			was forced to reset his computer. We have written<br/>
alot of petitions<br/>
			about these bugs but none of them were answered.<br/>
