<div id="ygrps-yiv-167782335">Spooky place.  Of course we all have to run through it to get to Unrest, but<br/>
does anyone know anything else about this place?  The only thing I&#39;ve seen<br/>
there is Goblin Tidal Lords, which are WAAY red for me.  Is this the<br/>
underwater dungeon I&#39;ve heard about?  Anything else in the zone?  I know<br/>
them rocky cliffs are dangerous...&quot;You fall for 127 points of damage&quot;  OUCH!<br/>
