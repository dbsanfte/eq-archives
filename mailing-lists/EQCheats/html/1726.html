Secrets of the Sentient<br/>
Did You Know:<br/>
George Washington Never won a single battle during the revolutionary war.<br/>
He only fought delaying actions for better generals, or lost battles.<br/>
<br/>
=====<br/>
The more morals and taboos there are, The more cruelty afflicts people;<br/>
The more swords and knives there are, The more factions divide people;<br/>
The more arts and skills there are, The more change obsoletes people;<br/>
The more laws and taxes there are, The more theft corrupts people.<br/>
<br/>
Yet take no action, and the people nurture each other;<br/>
Make no laws, and the people deal fairly with each other;<br/>
Own no interest, and the people cooperate with each other;<br/>
Express no desire, and the people harmonize with each other.<br/>
