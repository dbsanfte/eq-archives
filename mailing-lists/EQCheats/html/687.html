<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001786566">Lets not turn this into a flame mailer. I think we all have better things to do<br/>
then read about someone complaining about someone else.  On another note, has<br/>
anyone else noticed that Giants seem to be carrying alot more plat these days.<br/>
Before the patch I was getting an average 2ish plat per giant (3 person party)<br/>
and now its up to around 11ish per giant. Not a bad increase I must say. Made<br/>
around 150 plat in one night. Makes sense to me since they are around lvl 35 and<br/>
hit to damn hard. Also has anyone get one of those no weight boxes of the<br/>
spectres yet??</div>
