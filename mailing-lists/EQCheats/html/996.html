<div id="ygrps-yiv-800806653">Anyone know where in Halas this quest can be completed and how hard it is?  This weapon has pretty damn good stats (6/23 weight 4), almost identical to a silvery war axe and much better than a combine weapon.  It&#39;s not lore so it can be dual weald as well.  Any help would be appreciated.</div>
