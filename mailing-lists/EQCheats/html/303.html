<b>Subject:</b> Question for Befallen Buffs <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-409327622">Hi all.  I have a question or two about the basement of Befallen...<br/>
<br/>
We went down in hopes of getting a BBC for our Pally last night.  We were<br/>
there for two hours or so, and never saw the SK.  We were told that there is<br/>
a &quot;spawn line&quot;, ie, don&#39;t cross it or the SK will not spawn.  Is this the<br/>
case?  If so, is that line at the end of the tunnel?  Or inside the room?<br/>
It was fairly frustrating.  Also, there was another group there camping for<br/>
the Robes, and I never saw that Theor..they...whatever guy that is supposed<br/>
to drop the robes.  Does the same thing apply for him?<br/>
<br/>
Lastly..how often would you say the SK would normally spawn?  Every 1/2<br/>
hour?  Hour?  2 hours?  I probably will not return to Befallen, unless it is<br/>
with my Paladin with the objective of getting that BBC for him....so the<br/>
info would be appreciated.  That place is just swarming with DE&#39;s, and it<br/>
makes my dwarven skin crawl.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
