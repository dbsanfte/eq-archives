<div id="ygrps-yiv-491928918">A probationary period of approximately one (1) month shall then ensue. The new Recruit shall then post an introductory message upon the private message board. The initiate period begins from the date of this posting, and is a period of trial for the player, a time to be spent getting to know the members of the guild, understanding the guild&#39;s practices and policies, and deciding if the Comrades of Norrath is something the player wishes to become a part of. Recruits are free to resign their status at any time. At the conclusion of the probationary period, a vote shall be taken, guildwide.</div>
