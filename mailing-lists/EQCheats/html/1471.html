&gt;No its not on the live server yet. They said they&#39;ll probably make that in<br/>
&gt;this update. Wednsdays. Read the eqnews that downloads from the update for<br/>
&gt;wednsday and it will tell you what changed. ALSO. They are no longer having<br/>
&gt;rubicite dropped from the creatures that drop it currently. Everyone that <br/>
&gt;has<br/>
&gt;rubicite will keep it but you will no longer be able to get it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Leave it to Verant to screw something up worse than the problem it was <br/>
trying to fix (yet again I might add)! Why the hell couldn&#39;t they just have <br/>
made rubi no drop????? I&#39;m seriously thinking about quitting now. Rubi was <br/>
about the last think my DESK had left to look forward to.</div>
