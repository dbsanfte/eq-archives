<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099576548">Well I asked around for some official answers and I was told basically that<br/>
blocking, training, etc etc were all ILLEGAL. Plain and simple. End of<br/>
statement.<br/>
<br/>
No role-playing excuses allowed. If guides are accepting role-playing<br/>
excuses and allowing it to continue then those guides are not following the<br/>
rules.<br/>
<br/>
Guards in all areas have loot and give experience. They are there to be<br/>
killed. The fact that they protect newbies in their homelands is an added<br/>
bonus, but any sort of assistance they are given by players to attack the<br/>
people hunting them does go against the PVP avoidance rule.<br/>
<br/>
If people are hunting your guards in your homeland you have no recourse but<br/>
to duel them yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Someone wanted to know what was the official answer according to actual<br/>
guide rules, so I asked.</div>
