<div id="ygrps-yiv-357142950">With a party of lvl 24 plus you could easly take the knight and the rest of them if you stood at the top of the ramp and pulled to there. Personally i did it at around 24 but i had two other ppl with me, a lvl 28 pala and a lvl 28 cleric... <br/>

And while I&#39;m thinking about it, a quesiton for those of you that use<br/>
blackened armor. Is it better than banded? I heard it&#39;s about the same AC,<br/>
and is a bit heavier I think? Does it absorb more damage or what?<br/>

what&#39;s the level on the knight and the other mobs (dazed guards, elites,<br/>
shamans, etc)?<br/>

 BIB is on the goblin Knight.  At the bottom of the first<br/>
ramp, you come to a door, a tunnel going left, and a tunnel going right.  Go<br/>
right at the bottom.  Follow left wall around, past the water, into the nest<br/>
room.. there&#39;s a spot on the wall.. either green or purple.. can&#39;t remember<br/>
off hand.  Anyway.. the Knight spawns there, but be warned, it&#39;s a VERY RARE<br/>
spawn.. I&#39;ve been there waiting for 4 hrs and didn&#39;t see him..  Others say<br/>
it&#39;s random, sometimes they can spawn back to back within a half hour..<br/>
sometimes it takes up to 6 hours or so.  He always has the sword though.<br/>
 As far as blackened pieces go, elite guards and up will drop<br/>
them..<br/>
<br/>
 Good luck,<br/>

 Hiya all+ACE-<br/>
 I&#39;m lookin for some info (+ACo-spoil+ACo- me,<br/>
PLEASE+ACE-) on the BIBS.  I know its in<br/>
 Runneyeye, but was looking for more<br/>
specifics on the location, the MOB that<br/>
 carries it, group lvl needed to get to /<br/>
obtain the sword, etc, etc.  I<br/>
 haven&#39;t spent much time in Runneyeye...is it<br/>
a good mid-level dungeon?  it<br/>
 doesn&#39;t seem very crowded..which would be a<br/>
NICE change after spending the<br/>
 last week in Unrest+ACE-<br/>
 Also, for those of you wise in the way of<br/>
Runneyeye...what MOBs drop the<br/>
 Blackened Iron armor pieces?  I know the AC<br/>
isn&#39;t great, and it weighs a<br/>
 lot, but it looks very cool and I bet there<br/>
is a market out there for that<br/>
 &#39;look&#39;.<br/>
 Thanks in advance for your help+ACEAIQ-<br/>
