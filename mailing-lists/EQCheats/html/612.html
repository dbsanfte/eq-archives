<div id="ygrps-yiv-790412679">What 8 or 10 hrs. to level - heck it takes me that just to gain a bubble<br/>
   and then I die & its all gone in 10 sec.  Ive been 27 for 2 weeks.   Its<br/>
hard, dangerous & slow  for a ranger to solo but I seem to have difficulties<br/>
finding a group to join - Is there no one out there or group out there that<br/>
want rangers in their groups anymore???   Once I was in the Keep shouting<br/>
for a group - was there for an hour & half & I never found a group & I<br/>
eventually had to leave but a lower cleric came in & found a group in like 5<br/>
minutes - its very frustrating :o(<br/>

&gt;What server did you play on in Meridian?  I was on 108, and that was a<br/>
&gt;really great game.. but you are right, it got ruined.  I think when they<br/>
&gt;made the spell class changes, it really went downhill from there.  The<br/>

&gt;I used to play meridian 59. I loved this game but people got burned out on<br/>
&gt;it becuase you could build too fast and then got bored. Then people went<br/>
&gt;around and PKed each other. It turned a wonderful online community into a<br/>
&gt;garbage dump. What is your great hurry? You planning on leaving soon? As<br/>
&gt;long as you are having fun and meeting new people and playing a game you<br/>
&gt;like what difference does it make what level you are or how fast you get<br/>
&gt;there. These games are ment to be played for years not weeks. I am<br/>
&gt;surprised that people have already been able to max out. Now what do they<br/>
&gt;have to do? Ok they can go anywhere and kill almost anything but how long<br/>
&gt;before they get bored and move on? The game has only been out a few months.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just my 2 cents<br/>

&gt;&gt;I agree that level gaining is quite slow. 8-10 hours<br/>
&gt;&gt;for a level is a bit much. I can&#39;t imagine the high<br/>
&gt;&gt;30s and above.<br/>
