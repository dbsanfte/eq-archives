&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; most kills yield up ruined pelts. &gt;&gt;<br/>

 This is very untrue unless you are speaking of low level animals. If you <br/>
want medium quality cat pelts (for Studded) You kill Pumas in East Commons <br/>
along the desert wall. If you want high quality cat pelts (for Reinforced) <br/>
You kill Lions (especially Patriarch and Matriarch) in the Karanas. As far as <br/>
I know Patriarch and matriach are most commonly found in Eastern Karana along <br/>
the path. Also for low quality cat pelts are sometimes found on Pumas, as are <br/>
high quality. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	This is all well and good for medium wearers. And it is fairly well <br/>
known that the other Karanas yield decent LQ, MQ, and HQ Bear pelts for the <br/>
larger types (as well as the Kodiaks to the East). However, with several <br/>
hundred puppies that have gotten their noses whacked I find no good source of <br/>
LQ, MQ, or HQ pelts for small sizes.<br/>
	And while on the subject, any use for LQ pelts besides resale for <br/>
coin? Tailors use MQ (studded) and HQ (Reinforced, which last I heard wasn&#39;t <br/>
working). LQ uses?</div>
