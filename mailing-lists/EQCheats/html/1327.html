<div id="ygrps-yiv-628931044">This has happened to me and my friend that fight together. Both are lvl <br/>
20 Druids and fighting crag spiders in E. Karana.  Had to camp to fix it.  <br/>
BUT it was happening to lots of people in the zone.  I knew to camp because <br/>
people where yelling that this would fix it.  We both did a /bug. Last I <br/>
heard of it and it hasn&#39;t happened to us since.  but my roommate ( who uses <br/>
my account for her char ) had this happen to her Saturday in Neriak (  SP? )  <br/>
Forest but she didn&#39;t know the /bug command.<br/>
