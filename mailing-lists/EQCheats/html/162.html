<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-54762796">Exactly the same. At least the pieces I made were. Except you do of course<br/>
not get the pluses on any statistics. Rather worthless as it is since in<br/>
the end any piece of reinforced you make will wind up costing you more than<br/>
it would have to just buy or hunt for snakeskin. Atfer around 23 failed<br/>
reinforced attempts I got 2 improvements in the skill with my 77<br/>
intelligence. Unless they start to allow the stacking of boning and studs<br/>
this skill is just too damned hard to work on.<br/>
<br/>
Hm, I see from the others that I&#39;m having spectacularly bad luck in getting<br/>
these HQ bear pelts. I mostly fought both common lands and the Karanas for<br/>
pelts and occasionally went to Everfrost. I&#39;m starting to wonder if the<br/>
rumors about weapon type affecting the pelts dropped are true. I wield two<br/>
piercing weapons and almost never get anything other than a ruined pelt or<br/>
skin from animals. The exception being of course pumas who always seem to<br/>
have either med or HQ pelts for me.<br/>

&gt;Is reinforced leather better than snakeskin armor of the same piece, i.e. is<br/>
&gt;snakeskin arms better than reinforced arms?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If not, then snakeskin is the way to go.  You get + vs poison, and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;fairly easy to get in Blackburrow, or Split paw, can&#39;t remember which one,<br/>
&gt;but you could go there for about a week, and have close to a whole set.  Our<br/>
&gt;druid did it, with a friend to help, and they had it in 3 days.<br/>
