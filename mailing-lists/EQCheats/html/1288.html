&gt; I don&#39;t think so.... but then again it&#39;s been a while since I played my DE<br/>
necro and tried it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was told by someone that the only reason the halflings were in Nektouls<br/>
forrest was to raise<br/>
&gt; faction. I think it was more for the visiting trolls and orges that needed<br/>
a little help to get<br/>
&gt; certain vendors to sell to them and such. It may be more trouble than it&#39;s<br/>
worth for someone who is<br/>
&gt; KoS in Neriak. (There are guards that wander and you could run into them..<br/>
unlikely, but possible.<br/>
&gt; Especially, if some DE wanted to mess with you and trained one or two onto<br/>
you.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The easiest way to find out if faction goes down with all halflings would<br/>
be to go to Nek forrest<br/>
&gt; and give a shout.... Most likely, there is someone who just killed one and<br/>
can tell you. Or try<br/>
&gt; conning one of the halflings themselves.... if they like you as much as<br/>
the regular halflings do<br/>
&gt; then I would guess you would not want to go to the halfling town after<br/>
getting your faction up with<br/>
&gt; the evil races. But if they scowl at you then I think it would be pretty<br/>
safe to take them out.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Does this lower halfling faction at the same time?<br/>

&gt; &gt; I believe killing halflings in Nektulos forest raises Neriak factions,<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt; look out for our guards!  When you zone in, follow the zone wall to the<br/>
left<br/>
&gt; &gt; and you&#39;ll run into they&#39;re camp.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was wondering about raising faction in a few cities. Halas,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Oggok, Neriak,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and Grobb (the &#39;evil&#39; cities and the Barb city).<br/>
