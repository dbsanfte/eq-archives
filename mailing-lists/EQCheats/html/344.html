&gt; Just a side note on that: the ring can be recharged at any cleric guild.. I&#39;ve recharged it in Ak&#39;anon and Freeport before.. But i do agree, the ring isnt very useful, not as good as it was in beta anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well..  I wouldn&#39;t say anywhere.  I tried to get it recharged in<br/>
Felwithe and I lost it.  But..  since the quest is faction based once i<br/>
got back to vale i got aonther ring.  I don&#39;t feel like trying any other<br/>
towns.</div>
