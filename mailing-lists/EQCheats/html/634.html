&gt; What server did you play on in Meridian?  I was on 108, and that was a<br/>
&gt; really great game.. but you are right, it got ruined.  I think when they<br/>
&gt; made the spell class changes, it really went downhill from there.  The<br/>
older<br/>
&gt; chars were mage/tanks, and newer players would never be as powerful.<br/>

&gt; I used to play meridian 59. I loved this game but people got burned out on<br/>
&gt; it becuase you could build too fast and then got bored. Then people went<br/>
&gt; around and PKed each other. It turned a wonderful online community into a<br/>
&gt; garbage dump. What is your great hurry? You planning on leaving soon? As<br/>
&gt; long as you are having fun and meeting new people and playing a game you<br/>
&gt; like what difference does it make what level you are or how fast you get<br/>
&gt; there. These games are ment to be played for years not weeks. I am<br/>
&gt; surprised that people have already been able to max out. Now what do they<br/>
&gt; have to do? Ok they can go anywhere and kill almost anything but how long<br/>
&gt; before they get bored and move on? The game has only been out a few<br/>
months.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just my 2 cents<br/>

&gt; &gt;I agree that level gaining is quite slow. 8-10 hours<br/>
&gt; &gt;for a level is a bit much. I can&#39;t imagine the high<br/>
&gt; &gt;30s and above.<br/>
