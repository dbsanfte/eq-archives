<b>Subject:</b> Blackened Iron Bastard Sword? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-776207315">Hiya all!<br/>
I&#39;m lookin for some info (*spoil* me, PLEASE!) on the BIBS.  I know its in<br/>
Runneyeye, but was looking for more specifics on the location, the MOB that<br/>
carries it, group lvl needed to get to / obtain the sword, etc, etc.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t spent much time in Runneyeye...is it a good mid-level dungeon?  it<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem very crowded..which would be a NICE change after spending the<br/>
last week in Unrest!<br/>
Also, for those of you wise in the way of Runneyeye...what MOBs drop the<br/>
Blackened Iron armor pieces?  I know the AC isn&#39;t great, and it weighs a<br/>
lot, but it looks very cool and I bet there is a market out there for that<br/>
&#39;look&#39;.<br/>
Thanks in advance for your help!!<br/>
