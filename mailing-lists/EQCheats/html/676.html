<b>Subject:</b> Pottery&#39;s Last Use <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-270061202">As seen with the recent posting of the poison formulas a Master Potter has only one market to sell to, Rogues. (Kind of like Fletching&#39;s limited market, only worse.) <br/>
<br/>
Having been asked by a Rogue friend to put another now useless Mastery to work we set out to a well stocked supplier and loaded up on equipment to use at the wheel. <br/>
<br/>
Fifteen Plat later we were no closer to making a Vail or Sealed Vial, and too frustrated to attempt the Plat+ style. <br/>
<br/>
Someone has to know the correct mix by now. After all, it was on the Test Server before release. <br/>
<br/>
I can state what DOESN&#39;T work for the Vial since I started taking Mix Notes by the time we started getting low on coin. <br/>
<br/>
The following combinations WILL NOT make a Vial:<br/>
(Sketch and Water are assumed requirements) <br/>
Small Block <br/>
Small Block and Glass Shards <br/>
Small Block and Metal Bits <br/>
Two Small Blocks and Metal Bits <br/>
Two Small Blocks, Metal Bits, and Glass Shards <br/>
 <br/>
Block of Clay <br/>
Two Blocks <br/>
Block and Glass Shards <br/>
Block and Metal Bits <br/>
<br/>
Large Block <br/>
Large Block and Glass Bits <br/>
<br/>
The last two groupings (Block and L.Block)are guesses on what we used. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone have better success? Or further additions of what NOT to try so we all aren&#39;t wasting coin on an already destroyed Skill? <br/>
<br/>
A Master Potter with no market, <br/>
A Master Fletcher with a minimal market, <br/>
and a Master Smith with a rapidly shrinking market</div>
