tradeskill items, so suddenly 10K doesn&#39;t seem worth $25.<br/>
<br/>
The northeast corner of Feerott spawns scores of spiders, so I can gather two<br/>
or three silks there in a bad hour, or I can go to innothule and get the same<br/>
with a little more work, plus farm zombie skins. Zombie skins and spiderling<br/>
silks are a minimum of 10pp EACH (that&#39;s 200pp per stack) right now. Last<br/>
night I sold two stacks (I should have brought up more) for 14.9pp per silk.<br/>
<br/>
If I actually make sure keep enough silks in inventory and my trader up<br/>
whenever I&#39;m not playing, I can make enough for a horse within a week or so<br/>
with minimal play. In fact, right now I have enough for my second horse, I<br/>
bought my wife a Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate for 6K just recently. <br/>
