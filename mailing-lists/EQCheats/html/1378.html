 I have a question about the quest.. I am helping my enchanter friend with<br/>
 the quest, and I was wondering.. If I get the items at the same time, ie she<br/>
 has one set and i have my own.. if by the end of the quest, i can give her<br/>
 the stuff I&#39;ve got and she can complete it for me.. or is any of the stuff<br/>
 No drop ? This way she can get a stein and I can get a stein also ? Oh yeah<br/>
 i am high elf mage, so I know I can&#39;t get the item myself..<br/>
 <br/>
 Thanks<br/>

which means you can only carry one at a time.<br/>
