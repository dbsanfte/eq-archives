<div id="ygrps-yiv-26075753">Very good point, never assume especially with this company. :) But the<br/>
way I see it, if we couldn&#39;t cast it on others, then it wouldn&#39;t ask<br/>
us to pick a target.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I just got an idea. When I get back to a town, I am going to find<br/>
the PoD and cast indentify on him (assuming he is holding his staff).<br/>
See of that works. :)<br/>
<br/>
I do agree that we seem to have gotten totally shafted on being able<br/>
to cast (buff) on other people. I understand it&#39;s not our speciality,<br/>
and all, but my god I&#39;m not talking about cleric/pally type buffs.<br/>
Sight and heat/cold/magic resistance would be great to cast on party<br/>
members.<br/>

&gt;  I have never tried it on other people, but I don&#39;t see why it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;  work on them either.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well I wouldn&#39;t assume this.  Hardly any of our spells work on other people.<br/>
&gt; Does it make sense that we can cast See Invisi on others but not Heat Sight?<br/>
&gt; Also, keep in mind that Identify Magic spell is gonna be taken out of the<br/>
&gt; game soon and replaced with a new spell (all who have Identify magic will<br/>
&gt; auto recieve new spell I think).<br/>
