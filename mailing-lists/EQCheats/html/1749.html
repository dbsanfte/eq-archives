<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770814995">I voted, but I felt like I should Qualify my statement.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think hacks should be added to this site.  It is my belief that <br/>
hacking of EQ is against the Agreement.  This could cost someone <br/>
their account.  I&#39;m not so sure I or anyone who is reading this site <br/>
would like to wake up tomorrow and not be able to play EQ.  I do <br/>
like reading the board on this site and should probably contibute <br/>
more.  I will thank you now for hosting it.</div>
