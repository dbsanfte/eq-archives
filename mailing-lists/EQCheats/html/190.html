<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075593545">It has been confirmed on the Holyswords list that Fiery Avenger is a Holy<br/>
Sword and is therefore a Paladin only weapon.  The character that holding<br/>
the sword in the picture is a GM and that is why he can hold it.  The fact<br/>
that Paladins get the Holy Swords and no one else is to make up for the<br/>
fact that we get 20% less exp. per kill.  Paladins also are not great<br/>
fighters like the Warriors, nor are we great healers or buffers like the<br/>
Clerics.<br/>
