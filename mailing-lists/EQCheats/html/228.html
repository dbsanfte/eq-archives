&gt;Ok first off, I am only a Level 16 monk so I do not have very many rare<br/>
&gt;spoilers for you guys.  However, I have a few odds and ends that I have<br/>
&gt;picked up in my travels.  Some of this stuff is what I have heard, so<br/>
&gt;take it as you will.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is a glowing torch found on a rare spawn in Lavastorm...It gives 4<br/>
&gt;AC, adds +5 charisma, and can be used as a lighting source when held in<br/>
&gt;your hand.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After receiving the Squad Ring from the quest in Riverdale, you can use<br/>
&gt;it to kill Nillipus fairly easily.  All you have to do is lure Nillipus<br/>
&gt;into the cleric&#39;s guide, where the ring can be recharged, and then use<br/>
&gt;the ring when you are low on health.  You can then recharge the ring at<br/>
&gt;one on the NPC&#39;s.  I do not have the squad ring yet, so i can not verify<br/>
&gt;that this works.  I would appreciate it if someone would tell me how to<br/>
&gt;recharge the ring?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When talking to NPC&#39;s, they give keywords in brackets.  To activate<br/>
&gt;these keywords you have to ask a question using the keyword.  Usually, a<br/>
&gt;simple question such as What [keyword]? will do the trick.  However,<br/>
&gt;when the keyword is a person, then it requires a Who [keyword]?  I know<br/>
&gt;this sounds pretty simple, but it took me forever to figure out.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are a pair of Shiny Silk Gloves which are found on the Queen<br/>
&gt;Spider in Lesser Faydark, i forget stats but I believe they are<br/>
&gt;magical.  It would take about a level 16 group to get them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok, that about ends my knowledge...know, i have a request for a few<br/>
&gt;spoilers of my own<br/>
&gt;Most of these deal with packs or  bags which reduce the weight of things<br/>
&gt;put inside...<br/>
&gt;For all of these, I would love to have information on:<br/>
&gt;% of weight reduction<br/>
&gt;where it is found<br/>
&gt;what level to get it<br/>
&gt;how much do they sell for<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Shralok Pack- I know it comes from Highhold Pass, thats it<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bag of Sewn Evil Eye- Found in Lower Guk?, 8 slots<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Traveler&#39;s Backpack- found on Rathyl in Najena, need to get keys or<br/>
&gt;something to find him<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Traveler&#39;s Pouch- found on Rathyl in Najena, can only hold small items<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Traveler&#39;s Pack- reduces weight by 20%, 8 slots, sometimes reward for<br/>
&gt;Nillipus quest<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Archaelogist&#39;s Pack- found on Goblin Archaelogist in Permafrost, 6 slots<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lionhide Backpack- found in South Karana? off of a rare spawn<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Pierce&#39;s Pouch of Storing- reduces weight of items by 50-75%, 8 slots,<br/>
&gt;sometimes a reward from Nillipus quest<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you know of anymore weight reduces packs, and have information on<br/>
&gt;where to get them, please let me know...Any information about these<br/>
&gt;items would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, where is the best place to find black pearls if I wanted to buy<br/>
&gt;them?<br/>
&gt;And info on the Serpent Skin Eyepatch would be appreciated...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry so long,<br/>
&gt;All help is appreciated,<br/>
