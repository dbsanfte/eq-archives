 Alright, as I said, I would not change it for ONE person, however many<br/>
 people, I will... I still don&#39;t see how a few extra lines are that all<br/>
 imposing, especially when you can scroll by them in one hundredth of a<br/>
 second, but if your all that annoyed then fine.. ive removed all of the<br/>
 oxymorons that I find so funny, so all you lazy ppl that cant scroll, your<br/>
 wish is my command, as for the random characters people speak of, I have<br/>
no<br/>
 clue how to get rid of them, and YES I do use outlook Express and ive been<br/>
 told it has something to do with that. As for me being on peoples kill<br/>
 lists, thats fine with me.. no skin off my back, I&#39;m just here to pick up<br/>
 any extra knowledge, however I myself have a great deal of knowledge.. and<br/>
 im not just blowing my horn either. +ACo-shrug </span></blockquote></div>
