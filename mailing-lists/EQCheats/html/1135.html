<div id="ygrps-yiv-250833010">I was wondering if anyone could tell me why this happened and how to avoid<br/>
it in the future.<br/>
I was hunting the little undead camp in south karana right by the zone. I<br/>
got killed by lord<br/>
Grimrot, the only problem I have is that I never even saw him. He cast a<br/>
spell on me and killed<br/>
Me in one shot. I liked the area but would just like to be able to avoid<br/>
grimrot, anyone know <br/>
To avoid him?<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
John</div>
