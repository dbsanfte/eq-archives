<b>Subject:</b> Raising Faction <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126353376">I was wondering about raising faction in a few cities. Halas, Oggok, Neriak,<br/>
and Grobb (the &#39;evil&#39; cities and the Barb city). <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had two barbarian characters, and the only way I&#39;ve found to raise<br/>
faction in Halas is through quests...is there a mob you can kill?<br/>
<br/>
As far as the other cities, I need a way that someone that&#39;s KOS right now<br/>
can raise faction (ie. a mob to kill, not a quest to do since I&#39;ll get KOS&#39;d<br/>
trying to do the quest).</div>
