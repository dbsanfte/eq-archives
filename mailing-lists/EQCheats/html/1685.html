<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979914596">Actually Chuck, not sure how long you have been playing the game, but people<br/>
have been buying and selling eq items with real money for a long time, its<br/>
not hard to do.  As a matter of fact up until several months ago, you could<br/>
purchase in-game items on ebay all the time,  I myself have never subscribe<br/>
to this type of method of gaining the items I want or need, however it<br/>
simple as and effective, and has been very lucrative in the past for<br/>
hardcore players, no scams just a bunch of game addicts who will do anything<br/>
to get ahead.<br/>

If anyone even thinks about sending this guy 250 real dollars for<br/>
this stuff, then maybe you should be admitted. And the guy actually<br/>
posting this post, you must have rocks in your head to expect that<br/>
kind of money for some inanimate items in some game. Get real<br/>
pal, how about I just send you my paycheck every week, NOT.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, don&#39;t be stupid people and fall for scams like this, which is<br/>
all they are.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. This is not a cheat, it is a scam and does not belong here.  Maybe<br/>
you can&#39;t accept paypal cause you screwed too many people out of<br/>
their hard earned money and they kicked you off their service.  Or could<br/>
be that it is almost impossible to get money back from someone if you<br/>
pay them by money order.<br/>
