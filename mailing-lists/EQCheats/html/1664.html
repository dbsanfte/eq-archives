&gt; AGAIN I thought this guy was gone?<br/>
&gt; I took it upon myself to post this message on the<br/>
&gt; other  Egroup message boards because this guy is<br/>
&gt; really getting annoying, I had to post this 7 times<br/>
&gt; besides this one...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is getting annoying out of the 10 lists I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; currently on this guy is on 8 of them selling his<br/>
&gt; cheats. Already one Moderator has kicked him and now<br/>
&gt; he hits everyother site he can get on pushing his<br/>
&gt; product. This ain&#39;t E-Bay buddy! Your making it<br/>
&gt; annoying to check e-mails about everquest! Please I<br/>
&gt; urge you Moderators to do something about these<br/>
&gt; commercial interuptions thank you.<br/>
&gt;                     Sinchi<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Sorry to get off topic with this but I know you all<br/>
&gt; understand and most atleast agree with me. Thank you.<br/>
