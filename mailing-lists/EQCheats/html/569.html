<div id="ygrps-yiv-254366608">You have to remember that the trade skills arn&#39;t all dependent on each other like they will be in the future... I&#39;m sure pottery will have its uses, just like baking ect will eventually.. You&#39;ll just have to wait. I play a gnome and i&#39;d love to be able to tinker, but tinkering is totally bugged... So i&#39;ll just have to wait, and i accept that... It leaves something to look forward to. Untill then tinkering is basicly useless+ACE-<br/>
