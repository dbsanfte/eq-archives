<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515383751">Ahh..I&#39;ll go check it out today and see if it doesn&#39;t work anymore<br/>
<br/>
Also, How does everyone feel of hacking.  I know it is dangerous <br/>
because Verant is always looking out for that stuff and it could get <br/>
your account banned.  My website also has info about how to hack to <br/>
raise items stats, make your character run at SOW speed, ect..<br/>
<br/>
Let me know how you feel about hacking info<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
