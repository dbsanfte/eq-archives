<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047853942">Sorry guys....<br/>
I have to side with Verant on Nerfing the Pottery/Brewing type skills.<br/>
If you guys want to sit around doing these monotonous, boring vendor-type<br/>
skills, than I guess that is your prerogative...BUT I sure don&#39;t see where<br/>
you guys should be making 8-10 times the profit in an hour that a person can<br/>
make out fighting monsters.<br/>
Agreed, they seem to be going a little overboard with there &#39;corrections&#39;.<br/>
I don&#39;t think it should be impossible for you to make money selling made<br/>
items to NPCs, but the amount of money that you make should be very<br/>
comparable to what I can make out there gathering loot off of MOBs.  My<br/>
impression (please feel free to correct me if I am wrong!) is that you guys<br/>
are the same group of people that made hundreds of millions of TONS of<br/>
surplus Tailoring-made items in UO - you chose to spend time working up your<br/>
Tailor so you could provide your mage with enough money to buy reagents.<br/>
True?<br/>
The point I&#39;m trying to make is that you guys were taking advantage of the<br/>
system...using in imbalance in the pricing structure to make a LOT more cash<br/>
than you should have been able to make by using trade skills.  Be happy that<br/>
you got to take advantage of the system as long as you did.  But PLEASE<br/>
don&#39;t whine when they try to balance things out...it trivializes the real<br/>
issues around game balance.<br/>
Thanks for your time.<br/>
Flame away  :-)<br/>

This game is sucking worse every day. It has the<br/>
serious UO syndrome of sucking all the fun and<br/>
enjoyment out of the game.<br/>
