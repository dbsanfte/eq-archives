<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012236312">I had a question about yuo monk. Was wondering how do you keep your weight <br/>
below 9. I think that is the weight you have to be, before you start losing <br/>
AC. I have like 1 item and I am above that, how yuo do it? I guess those <br/>
pouches could help, just curious thanks. OH ya, monks rule, go monks!! Might <br/>
go make one now...</div>
