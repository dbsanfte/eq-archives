<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147288250">Just to let ya know, you&#39;ll get one warning, probably not more, from a GM<br/>
before they take action for this. Most of the areas where people do this<br/>
(Everfrost, Aviak houses, etc) are known and I think they check em at times.<br/>
Possible actions are warnings, banning, and deletions I believe. Not sure if<br/>
anyone has been deleted or not, but my roomie got a warning for doing it in<br/>
Everfrost.<br/>
<br/>
Thought you should know...<br/>

I dont know if you guys know about the Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron safe spot or<br/>
not so I&#39;ll post it.<br/>
<br/>
Its good for wizards lvl 18-22<br/>
<br/>
here is what you have to do... go to the goblin camp on the left of the<br/>
unrest entrace tunnel<br/>
and just blast one of the goblins (if there is a shaman blast him<br/>
first).. run back to the tunnel<br/>
and go to the end of the tunnel... now start going back to the entrace<br/>
step by step and check if<br/>
you are in range to attack the goblins trying to blast them with your<br/>
spell(they will be stuck in<br/>
the roof, over the entrace and wont go inside after you)... then once if<br/>
get in reach to attack<br/>
them just start blasting them and you will kill them easily... the Tidal<br/>
Lords take a little more<br/>
time to kill since they are RED to you you will have to burn all your<br/>
mana , go back to the end<br/>
of tunnel and med to full mana untill you start blasting again.<br/>
<br/>
when you kill a goblin just go near the entrace untill you get in range<br/>
to be attacked by them<br/>
with their bows... once you get HIT or missed once you will have another<br/>
goblin targeted... go<br/>
to the end of the tunnel again and kill it. do it over and over and you<br/>
will gain LOTS of exp..<br/>
<br/>
also if you have the cancel magic, cast it on each goblin before start<br/>
attcking them... it will<br/>
reduce their chance to resist your spells since it will remove the buffs<br/>
the shamans cast on them.<br/>
<br/>
made it there from lvl 18 to 20 in 2 days.... 7 hours of play total.<br/>
<br/>
I think only wizards will be able to exploit this bug successfully.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
