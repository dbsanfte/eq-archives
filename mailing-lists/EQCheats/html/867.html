&gt;   A necro friend said he just put in 48 hours to get<br/>
&gt; those boots. Haven&#39;t heard anything about reducing the<br/>
&gt; time. Could there be anti-camp zones like some other<br/>
&gt; mobs perhaps?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is no anti-camp vode in this game. You should sit in the room not the<br/>
little corridor because sitting in the corridor pulls moosh from the<br/>
basement cells.<br/>
<br/>
I got my boots on my second visit, luckyly in about 4 hours, 2 boots spawned<br/>
back to back so the magician that was with me got a pair too.</div>
