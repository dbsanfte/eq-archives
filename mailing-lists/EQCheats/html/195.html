<div id="ygrps-yiv-32500624">Hmm...<br/>
<br/>
Lets look at the comparisons, given the possible duals (with no<br/>
Lay-on-Hands)<br/>
Paladin with Fiery Avenger Vs. Monk?  Monk will win.<br/>
Paladin with Fiery Avenger Vs. Warrior? Warrior will probably win.<br/>
Paladin with Fiery Avenger Vs. Ranger? Probably a toss up.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I&#39;m not certain about these, but I think you&#39;d have to prove me<br/>
wrong for me to believe it.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it... Double attack / Dual wield makes a big difference.  That&#39;s<br/>
4 attacks per round when you get up there.  Against a monk there is no<br/>
contest... you have a delay _50_ weapon that does what?  in the 100pt range?<br/>
ok, maybe 150?  if that! a dmg 15 yields 24-27 hps, so it would stand to<br/>
reason that a dmg 30 weapon dishes out 50-60hps (if it&#39;s linear) so a dmg 37<br/>
would be like 70ish per hit using that reasoning, but I think it&#39;s more than<br/>
that.<br/>
But that monk...  the monk will dish out... hmm.. 45+45+45+45 (4 punches)<br/>
+120 (flying kick) = 300pts  TWICE in the time it will take the paladin to<br/>
swing his weapon once.<br/>
<br/>
(On the innoruk server, there is a lvl 50 monk and lvl 50 warrior that duel<br/>
occasionally, the warrior is in full rubicite and the monk can kill him<br/>
before he even gets to half life.)<br/>
<br/>
A warrior will be swinging 3-4 times per round with fast high damage weapons<br/>
for probably a total of 90-130 per round, and still getting two rounds worth<br/>
of hits in the time it takes the paladin to get in one.  (it&#39;s not exactly<br/>
double, but it&#39;s close, 2 speed 28-32 weapons compared with one speed 50<br/>
weapon)<br/>
<br/>
The the stats that have been rumored about are true, then the Fiery avenger<br/>
seems like a lot of hype (albeit a very cool weapon) about something that<br/>
will give the paladins a fighting chance.  But the reasoning on that doesn&#39;t<br/>
hold much water either, because if it wasn&#39;t a totally bad-ass weapon, then<br/>
why would it be so hard to aquire?<br/>
<br/>
So maybe it&#39;s dmg 50, delay 37?  That would be a different story (he&#39;d still<br/>
get schooled by a monk, but that&#39;s true for every class)<br/>
<br/>
Kzak, Shaman who&#39;d get schooled by everybody<br/>

<br/>
What about Rangers tho, do they get special weapons?<br/>
<br/>
They are in the same boat as Paladins.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am a bard, so I could be wrong about No ranger swords, but I don&#39;t<br/>
think Paladins should get the most powerful weapon in the game, just because<br/>
they take a small exp cut.  Most hybrids take this cut, so what makes them<br/>
so special?  I could see getting a great weapon that is good against undead,<br/>
or something to that affect, but as I understand it, Fiery Avenger is the<br/>
best weapon in the whole game.<br/>

&gt; It has been confirmed on the Holyswords list that Fiery Avenger is a Holy<br/>
&gt; Sword and is therefore a Paladin only weapon.  The character that holding<br/>
&gt; the sword in the picture is a GM and that is why he can hold it.  The fact<br/>
&gt; that Paladins get the Holy Swords and no one else is to make up for the<br/>
&gt; fact that we get 20% less exp. per kill.  Paladins also are not great<br/>
&gt; fighters like the Warriors, nor are we great healers or buffers like the<br/>
&gt; Clerics.<br/>
