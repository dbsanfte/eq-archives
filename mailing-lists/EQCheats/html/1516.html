<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165181141">I was thinking about a High Elf Enchanter :)<br/>
<br/>
I just had an evil thought for a PVP server- I know everyone&#39;s heard about the<br/>
body caomping that had/is going on, but what about hanging out at the evac<br/>
sites?  This would work especially well for and enchanter- you see them before<br/>
they get updates to their screen- so you could tashan/i/ia, charm one member<br/>
then sick it on the rest as they zone.  Mes the others not being attacked, and<br/>
then gate out before they really have any idea what hit them.<br/>
<br/>
Well, this IS a cheat list?  That sounds pretty close to one :)</div>
