<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678282751">this arguement though is just going to fall on deaf ears.. I for one can<br/>
time a lot of spawns great... late at night I can come on for say 2 hours<br/>
and totally rotate every npc spawn in for ex. upper guk (scyer, ancient<br/>
croc, warden, squire, giant spider) &lt;not the lord.. yet at least&gt;... and I<br/>
usually come away with at least one good item... now maybe I dont &quot;NEED&quot;<br/>
this item but I do get some mighty nice items which are then used to trade<br/>
for other stuff that I do need.<br/>
<br/>
So this dumb arguement about 20 hours being required for every single nice<br/>
item is not a valid one.  Yes for ruby you usually do have to camp for hours<br/>
unless your lucky but I have known a few people to get their lucky breaks<br/>
(for ex. a friend of mine was camping the avatar of fear.. wasnt there for<br/>
more then 15min, the avatar spawned.. and he was carrying a Ruby BP).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think the point the guy was trying to make is &quot;have fun&quot; if your not<br/>
having fun then you shouldnt be playing? er better yet why are you playing<br/>
if your not overall having fun?<br/>
<br/>
A sign of power in my book would be one that gets by without having to whine<br/>
24/7...<br/>
=D<br/>
<br/>
ok lets get back on topic.. anyone know the ratio of times the Lord in upper<br/>
guk will be carrying the ghoulsbane as compared to the silvered bracer? heh<br/>

&gt;I guess you just proved our point - you will never get jboots, rubi & stuff<br/>
&gt;NOT because you suck at playing or you have a lousy character but because<br/>
&gt;you just don&#39;t have the TIME for camping.  Now thats just plain wrong.  We<br/>
&gt;should be able to get stuff if we have good skills & high level characters<br/>
&gt;not because we are willing to sit in a specific area for over 20 hrs. to<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you&#39;re happy not getting any of those items that makes the game better -<br/>
&gt;well good for you but I for one, am NOT.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t know but for some of us - I know some of us in my guild feel that<br/>
&gt;way - that getting all this hot stuff is a sign of wealth, power,<br/>
&gt;achievement.  Don&#39;t forget this is a role playing game - some of us take<br/>

&gt;you&#39;ve worked hard to get to that level - some rewards should come with<br/>
&gt;being higher level  - but you&#39;re 40 & you have no rubi, special weapons or<br/>
&gt;item because you don&#39;t have time or patience to camp but you will see a 15<br/>
&gt;level characters with all those - NOW that is DARN  WRONG !!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well Im happy you&#39;re having fun.  Oh! by the way I played UO & I was<br/>
&gt;bitching & whining there too :o)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BTW, Im 31 ranger & still dont&#39; have rubi, PGT or BIBS or whatever - like<br/>
&gt;you camping 20 or 30 hrs. straight is not plausible for me either - has if<br/>
&gt;that was not enough - then you get casters who kill your monsters.  Im a<br/>
&gt;very good player, have a good character - I should be able to get those<br/>
&gt;things but with the way the game is design - I guess only people who don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;work or kids especially if they are casters - can get ALL the good stuff.<br/>
&gt;Yeah you&#39;re right no big deal.. Who cares how strong my character gets with<br/>
&gt;time - I&#39;ll still not be able to get those things by myself, yeah no big<br/>
&gt;deal<br/>

&gt;&gt;I work 40 hours a week, have my own apartment, my own car, loan, bills, I<br/>
&gt;&gt;go to night school aswell and I play maybe 2-3 hours a night....so about<br/>
&gt;&gt;15 hours a week...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;That won&#39;t get me a pait of JBoots, or BIBS, or BIC...or any rubicite or<br/>
&gt;&gt;anything....but you know what I do....I just enjoy the game.  So WHAT if<br/>
&gt;&gt;you can&#39;t have an item you want.  Tough shit....really people....sure the<br/>
&gt;&gt;item may be cool....but it&#39;s not the end all and be all of your<br/>
&gt;&gt;character.....please.....quite bitching about camping.  I don&#39;t camp,<br/>
&gt;&gt;can&#39;t camp....and don&#39;t care if others do.  If they want to stay up 18<br/>
&gt;&gt;straight hours....then let them....this is a game after all....there are<br/>
&gt;&gt;other things going on in the world.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;As far as items not being on a MoB all the time.  Well...that would make<br/>
&gt;&gt;SoW from a shaman or druid...not very special....that would make that<br/>
&gt;&gt;special weapon not so special anymore.  That would make the 10-40 hour<br/>
&gt;&gt;wait to get the PGT that much less special.  If you want to power through<br/>
&gt;&gt;the game...get all the best weapons and armor easily and not have to work<br/>
&gt;&gt;at all to get em....then go play UO.  I don&#39;t want to see everyone running<br/>
&gt;&gt;around with JBoots...wielding PGT&#39;s and Darkewood shields....<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; ~S<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;p.s.  power leveling, stupidity and camping will thin out rather<br/>
&gt;&gt;soon....seeing as highschool/college are starting rather soon.....relax<br/>
&gt;&gt;people....plenty of items in the game that we know of....and plenty more<br/>
&gt;&gt;that we don&#39;t know about.<br/>
