<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613380946">Aradune stated (yes he&#39;s a ranger) that the weapon was for all classes<br/>
in beta just so it could be shown off.  He also stated that as of<br/>
release it would be a &quot;HOLY SWORD&quot;, meaning that only paladins can use<br/>
it.  It was stated very clearly that the sword would be for PALADINS<br/>
ONLY whenever EQ was released.  For beta though, it was available to any<br/>
class that could use a 2h sword.  Clear enough?</div>
