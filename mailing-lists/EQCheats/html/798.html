Hey Lemac: I&#39;ve NEVER seen a High Elf in court!  :)<br/>
As to this laughable (but not laudable) supposed lawsuit:<br/>
Below is a copy of the email that Nick sent me, exactly as it appeared to me<br/>
(I&#39;ve included the ENTIRE mail, for those of you that enjoy a good chuckle.<br/>
<br/>
Please note in the second line of his email that he says that I can email<br/>
him when my &#39;daddy&#39; stops my college payments.  First of all, I don&#39;t<br/>
believe that this &#39;Nick&#39; character has consulted a lawyer (at least not a<br/>
GOOD one).  Secondly, even if he DID consult a lawyer, I paid for my own<br/>
education, thank you, and I believe he has given me permission to email him<br/>
anytime I want to!<br/>
This incident (that all started with Nick&#39;s irrelevant comments about<br/>
camping, and his subsequent flaming of Rebecca have gotten WAY out of hand,<br/>
and are taking up altogether too much of the bandwidth associated with this<br/>
email group.<br/>
Chuckle a little if you want....I have  :)<br/>
But, PLEASE, let&#39;s move on and talk about EQ!<br/>
Sean Clark<br/>
PS: I am FACULTY at the university I have my email at, not a student :)<br/>
Here&#39;s the message that nick sent me, in it&#39;s entirety:<br/>
<br/>
Obviously I have a job or I would probably be a tweaker like you.  You say<br/>
job like you have ever had one, when daddy stops your college payments then<br/>
you can email me and talk.  Until then this is your notice never to email me<br/>
again any further emails from you will require a 500 dollar proof reading<br/>
fee, under penalty of law of course.  Thank you very much and have a nice<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
N.H.<br/>

&gt; Hi Nick<br/>
&gt; As you have probably already realized, your original comments are<br/>
completely<br/>
&gt; inappropriate for the list.  Furthermore, I want you to know that I find<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; second comment (below), addressed to Rebecca to be completely<br/>
inappropriate,<br/>
&gt; childish and unprofessional.<br/>
&gt; Without getting into your complete lack of respect for other individuals,<br/>
&gt; your disregard for appropriate way to address a lady, and your lack of<br/>
&gt; intellectual ingenuity in dealing with criticism, (not to mention your<br/>
&gt; apparent lack of maturity), I would like to suggest that you take your<br/>
crude<br/>
&gt; language AND your lame attitude and remove yourself from this list.<br/>
&gt; This is NOT a forum for EQ complaints, and I certainly don&#39;t recall any<br/>
&gt; posts asking for your opinion on anything, much less you opinion on<br/>
camping.<br/>
&gt; Grow up.<br/>
&gt; Get a job.<br/>
&gt; Learn to express yourself in a manner appropriate to your environment.<br/>
&gt; Sean<br/>
