&gt;There is no anti-camp vode in this game. You should sit in the room &gt;not <br/>
&gt;the little corridor because sitting in the corridor pulls moosh &gt;from the <br/>
&gt;basement cells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I got my boots on my second visit, luckyly in about 4 hours, 2 boots <br/>
&gt; &gt;spawned back to back so the magician that was with me got a pair too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Was wondering where you get your info from? I have spoken with GM&#39;s and <br/>
guides alike - there IS anti-camping coding in the game. They&#39;re just not <br/>
implemented everywhere! You need to figure out where they are. I personally <br/>
have tested areas in Befallen, and have found it to be true, because certain <br/>
creatures spawn quicker with no campers in the area. In other areas, <br/>
creatures spawn just as quickly with or without campers.<br/>
<br/>
And even if you don&#39;t believe me, what do you think having a 4+ hour respawn <br/>
rate is? Chopped liver? In my book, that&#39;s just another form of anti-camping <br/>
code meant to discourage camping to me!</div>
