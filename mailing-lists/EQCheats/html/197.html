<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532574427">Please note, double attack is different than dual wield.  Double attack will<br/>
allow 2 attacks with same weapon in that same &quot;round&quot;.  While dual wield<br/>
would be 2 weapons, blah blah blah... total of 4 attacks occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
But you are right, the theory would have to be adjusted a little.  So say<br/>
the Avenger does 100pts of damage...  double attack would allow 200pts in a<br/>
&quot;round&quot;.  It still doesn&#39;t seem to add up.  Of course, it has that spell<br/>
effect too, which might make all the difference in the world.  Against<br/>
non-monks anyway.  The problem with fighting a monk isn&#39;t doing damage, it&#39;s<br/>
hitting the slippery devils in the first place.  I REALLY wouldn&#39;t want to<br/>
find a creature with a delay 50 weapon if I only hit them in 1 out of 8<br/>
attempts.  (and spell-weapons can only go off if you score a hit)<br/>

Ah, yes.  Paladins do get Double attack at Lev 20.  This would help a lot<br/>
and ruin a little bit of your theory.<br/>
