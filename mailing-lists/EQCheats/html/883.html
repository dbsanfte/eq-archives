<div id="ygrps-yiv-951090350">ust a side note about the Jboots.. the effect isnt as good as SoW.. it is <br/>
slightly slower then SoW. Just incase anyone wanted to know..<br/>
<br/>
The jboots are in fact slower than sow and the effect doesnt last as long <br/>
either, but there is one advantage, you can recharge the effect while <br/>
running, so if that mob is on your tail and the jboot sow is leaving you can <br/>
open your pack and click on them while running and never lose speed.  A very <br/>
nice compensation if you ask me.<br/>
