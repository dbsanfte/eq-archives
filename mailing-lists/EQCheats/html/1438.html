<div id="ygrps-yiv-650837397">Well said.<br/>
<br/>
All in the interest of roleplaying...<br/>
<br/>
Something that&#39;s funny the happened the other day: I zoned into Qeynos<br/>
Hills, and was running down the road. This ranger (way green to me, I think<br/>
around level 10) hailed me. I stopped, being ni a roleplaying mood, and<br/>
started a chat. He said &quot;Hey, come help me kill this guy!&quot;. I&#39;m thinking,<br/>
this could be fun. I&#39;m a level 30ish (at the time) Barbarian Shaman, mind<br/>
you... <br/>
<br/>
Ranger : runs to a BARBARIAN and says &quot;Kill him pls&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Leod: &quot;Who is pls?&quot; I say, looking around. (I do this alot...pls, plz, oic,<br/>
u, ur...all that shit bugs me...although SOME are ok...*chuckle*)<br/>
<br/>
Ranger: &quot;What? Just kill him.&quot; he says.<br/>
<br/>
Leod: &quot;What? Why would I want to kill one of my brethren?&quot; &lt;Leod smiles at<br/>
barbarian&gt; &quot;Hail so-and-so&quot; and I start a conversation, with this (green to<br/>
me) barbarian.<br/>
<br/>
Ranger: &quot;Dude, just kill him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Leod growls. &quot;WHY would I want to kill one of my brothers?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ranger: &quot;uumm....he&#39;s a poacher, wanted by Surefall. Come on, kill him for<br/>
me&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Leod growls. &quot;What do I care about Surefall? I hunt bears and wolves all the<br/>
time. Surefall have a price on my head as well? If so, I&#39;ll go see your<br/>
people, and they can meet the blunt of of me hammer!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ranger: &quot;u suck&quot; and runs off. Then he shouts something like<br/>
insert-some-barbarian-myth-characetr here (I forgot the name he used) will<br/>
,look down at you! You&#39;ve disappointed them!! You suck!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Leod shouts &quot;WHAT? I ROLEPLAY and you tell me I suck? I suck cause I won&#39;t<br/>
kill one of my brethren? GET REAL!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Leod chucles, pokes the barbarian in the ribs, and runs off.<br/>
<br/>
It was funny after I got over the initial shock that this guy like didn&#39;t<br/>
EVEN get it....quite odd...<br/>
<br/>
-Leod...killer of some guards, rarely in RP mode, but sometimes it&#39;s fun ;-)<br/>

Yes, training guards, blocking etc is illegal BUT it is up to the discretion<br/>
of every guide that gets called to the scene and every server is not treated<br/>
equal. If you feel that a guide is being biased and is not adhereing the the<br/>
rules you may repetition or ask for your issue to be escalated to a GM.<br/>
Personally I think it should be legal. If I see halfling guards getting<br/>
kited you can bet I would love to snare/root the evil %$##$ doing it. IMHO<br/>
It is a risk factor that should be allowed.<br/>
<br/>
Run through any dungeon killing something and the dungeon NPC residents are<br/>
going to jump in and assist in anyway they can, why should PC residents be<br/>
treated eany different? You want to see a train created that causes problems<br/>
with getting out of a dungeon... go sit in Splitpaw for a while. At least<br/>
every couple of hours the front door area is blocked by 5-15 gnolls of<br/>
various levels due to a train created and all the other NPCs jumping in. I<br/>
dont see anyone petitioning to get them in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
I know in a few areas the higher levels are acting as guards in places they<br/>
are killing them. This gives the newbies a place to run to that is basically<br/>
stronger than the guards to begin with since they are killing them after<br/>
all. These people normally SoW and buff all the newbies also. Yes it takes a<br/>
way some of the roleplaying perspective but it keeps everyone happy and GMs<br/>
out of it.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the issue of &quot;you dont have to kill them, you can hunt somewhere<br/>
else&quot; well yes and no. From a roleplaying side if things many people have<br/>
taken it upon themselves to pick a race to &quot;eliminate&quot; from Norrath. Neriak<br/>
guards are high on that list. But so are Ogres. I see plenty of evil<br/>
characters picking off halfling guards and Karanas guards also. So this is<br/>
not an issue suffered by evil races only. Dark elves that stay in Nektulos<br/>
Forest for any length of time end up hunting halflings, no reason why<br/>
halflings shouldn&#39;t come back and return the favor. I know I do.<br/>
