 </span></blockquote>I called you a moron because you said you wish<br/>
something came from it. It is one thing to find flaws<br/>
in the game design and exploit thiose... but it is a<br/>
totally different thing to use a hacking program to<br/>
buff your character up to some invincible god. I<br/>
don&#39;t want to see this game turned into a cheat fest. <br/>
<br/>
Like I said... finding exploitable things within the<br/>
current game code is one thing... actually hacking it<br/>
is another and  don&#39;t want to see it happen... you on<br/>
the other hand do. Thus... the comment.<br/>
