I have completed the Crafted Greaves quest twice now. You need the Dark <br/>
Circlet and two Star Rubies. You take these items to Ulan a Centaur in the <br/>
Centaur Village of South Karana. The /loc on the Centaur Village is 200, <br/>
-2400. I always Hail him and ask him about the item I want him to make <br/>
before I turn over the quest items to him. I keep my number one inventory <br/>
slot clear and do not stack the gems. This may be a bit anal but I want to <br/>
make sure not to lose anything, and never have doing it this way.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

&gt;Who has actually DONE the Crafted Greaves quest? I&#39;ve heard different<br/>
&gt;stories on what item you need. Some say the Silver Circlet off Drelzna, <br/>
&gt;some<br/>
&gt;say a circlet off Najena, and some say one off Trazdon.&gt;<br/>
&gt;I killed Trazdon in Najena last night at got a Dark Circlet (LORE NO DROP<br/>
&gt;MAGIC ITEM) Necro Only, AC 4, -2 CHA, +4 INT. Is this the correct item<br/>
&gt;(please only if you have 1st hand knowledge...) It could be a Circlet from<br/>
&gt;any of them could work....but I dont&#39; wanna take the chance as there is a<br/>
&gt;couple hours of work (plus two deaths...growl...I hadden&#39;t died in 6 ot 7<br/>
&gt;levels) and 140pp in rubies at stake...heh.&gt;<br/>
&gt;And if this ISN&#39;T the correct circlet, what&#39;s this head peice worth?<br/>
&gt;*chuckle*&gt; Thanks. </span></blockquote></div>
