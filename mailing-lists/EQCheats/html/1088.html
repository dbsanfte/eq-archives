&gt; Unless they have a timed program server side.  So that you can only move X<br/>
&gt; Paces in X Seconds.  And may also be limited to Z value, Vertical, there<br/>
&gt; fore not able to get out of range of mobs.<br/>

I would doubt it, it would be a *LOT* of extra coding... Shadowstep, gate,<br/>
falling, SoW with the bard song (Now stacks) couple of other things.  Also,<br/>
I accidentally did a preliminary test on this last night.  I was *DEEP* in<br/>
Sol B, deeper then I&#39;d want to go without SoW on, and I pinged a Greater<br/>
Kobold Shaman with an arrow.  *JUST* as he turned around but before he hit<br/>
me for the first time, there was a net burp.  Not noticing this I ran all<br/>
the way to<br/>
the spot where we pull to, to see no one there (During net burps people<br/>
dissappear as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen.)  a moment later, the connection came<br/>
back.  I was where I saw myself, full life, and about 20 seconds later the<br/>
Shaman came into view.  Basically this means that:<br/>
<br/>
1) While I wasn&#39;t there he didn&#39;t engage in combat.<br/>
2) He didn&#39;t move to follow until after the server knew where I was.<br/>
3) I saved about 400 hitpoints of damage that I usually take during that<br/>
run.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not too much of a hassle I&#39;m going to rewire my Hubs this afternoon<br/>
to put the one connection I play EQ from on the desktop to see if I can<br/>
repeativly do this.  I&#39;d give it a 50/50 chance, the connection burp was<br/>
near the server side and *MAY* have been server side lag.  (Everyone in the<br/>
zone had the same burp at the same time.)  Either way though it was a good<br/>
if accidental proof of concept.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; As a programmer, I know the hazards associated with  third party<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Programs fudging your data. The way EQ is set up, any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; modifications you make are reflected in YOUR computer&#39;s memory,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and maybe even your display, but NOT on veran&#39;ts server. You<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; FEED commands to Verant, the actions are resolved on the server,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the RESULTS are sent back to you. You may modify the commands<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sent, or the results on your screen, and it won&#39;t change what<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; happens to your character on verants servers at all. It is a great<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; way to preclude tampering. You may change your screen to show<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 50000pp, but try to buy something.... The next screen update will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; show your real totals... Your character and all interaction with it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are done BY Verant on their own servers. You have NO real contact with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything that must be modified for any kind of cheat to work.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; aye, the best you could do would be... stop/start the rain... change<br/>
night<br/>
&gt; / day....<br/>
&gt; &gt; and stuff like that. but no permanent changes in your character at all.<br/>
&gt; Maybe, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; just maybe you could get rid of root, blind and spells like that ...<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; intercept the<br/>
&gt; &gt; server feed using some program to tunnel it and remove/add commands from<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; feed , the server would think you are rooted but since your EQ client<br/>
&gt; didnt recieve<br/>
&gt; &gt; the command to root you it would let you move freely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually, there is one important thing that is handled completely on the<br/>
&gt; client side.  That is, where you are in the world.  (Proof, sit in a spot,<br/>
&gt; unplug your ethernet cable from the back of your PC, run 1000 spaces,<br/>
&gt; plug it back in, see that you&#39;re still there and not at the other place.)<br/>
&gt; So it should be possible to modify the X/Y/Z location in the client and<br/>
&gt; have that information passed on to the server...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Uses:<br/>
&gt; 1 key to the zone line.<br/>
&gt; bypass guards and jump right to the rare spawn and then jump right out<br/>
&gt; again.<br/>
&gt; PVP combat, randomly move 25 in each x/y direction.<br/>
