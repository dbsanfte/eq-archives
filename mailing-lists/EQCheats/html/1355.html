<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692218730">Does anyone know what will be added to the expansion. I have heard different<br/>
stories from different people. I have heard that Velious would be the new<br/>
continent added as well as the plain of fear I have also heard of a<br/>
different continent being added. If anyone knows I would love to hear more.<br/>

Thanks</div>
