<b>Subject:</b> RE: Guard Killing - Getting Trained <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426369728">Verant&#39;s official stance on this issue is that people can train you to protect<br/>
their lands, etc.  basically as long as they can think up a good roleplaying<br/>
excuse to do it.  This includes when higher level characters train larger MOBs<br/>
through newbie zones (including giants, spectres, cycs, and guards).  Now, a lot<br/>
of the time, people fighting in these areas know (by way of previous death) that<br/>
these MOBs get trained regularly.<br/>
<br/>
Where you were fighting there is nothing to harn newbies, so you weren&#39;t doing<br/>
any harm, so I really don&#39;t have a problem with it.  However, any &quot;evil&quot; race<br/>
has few options for banking or going into a city where they are not KOS, your<br/>
&quot;violation&quot; of their city is - in GMs mind - a justifiable excuse for training<br/>
you.  This goes both ways, I&#39;ve seen Dark Elves kill the wandering guards around<br/>
just about every city- Greater Fay, FP, Karanas, Quenos, etc.  that have been<br/>
trained by &quot;good&quot; races.  Funniest site I ever saw was a level 8 or so High Elf<br/>
Cleric train the Wood Elf Ranger Guild Master to 2 DE necros killing guards- he<br/>
cast Divine Aura on himself and jumped off the city platform and ran right to<br/>
these guys- twice.  Needless to say, he also dying in training the Ranger<br/>
Guildmaster to them, but I&#39;ve never seen 2 level 35s die so quickly!</div>
