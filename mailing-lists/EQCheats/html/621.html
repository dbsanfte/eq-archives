I used to play meridian 59. I loved this game but people got burned out<br/>
on<br/>
it becuase you could build too fast and then got bored. Then people went<br/>
around and PKed each other. It turned a wonderful online community into<br/>
a<br/>
garbage dump. What is your great hurry? You planning on leaving soon? As<br/>
long as you are having fun and meeting new people and playing a game you<br/>
like what difference does it make what level you are or how fast you get<br/>
there. These games are ment to be played for years not weeks. I am<br/>
surprised that people have already been able to max out. Now what do<br/>
they<br/>
have to do? Ok they can go anywhere and kill almost anything but how<br/>
long<br/>
before they get bored and move on? The game has only been out a few<br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents<br/>

&gt;I agree that level gaining is quite slow. 8-10 hours<br/>
&gt;for a level is a bit much. I can&#39;t imagine the high<br/>
&gt;30s and above. <br/>
