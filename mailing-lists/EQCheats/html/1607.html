<div id="ygrps-yiv-570068984"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Is it still possible to power level during a hell level, and if yes, where <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;a good spot to power? All help is appreciated. Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is possible to powerlvl anytime anywhere...You just the right person <br/>
helping you.  Being a tank or meelee character it is Rather easy to <br/>
powerlvl. Go to anyplace that has barely red mobs(i have heard that about <br/>
your lvl Cazic is real nice...heard) Have a much higher lvl healer type with <br/>
you-un grouped- and have them super buff you and heal you while you go at <br/>
the red ones solo. If your buddy is a caster type have them nuke the mob to <br/>
almost death...mem erase it(enchanters) or have them zone and you just go in <br/>
and mop up the mostly dead creature  Full exp for you :)<br/>
It is much harder to powerlvl if you r a caster....the 6 lvl cap on what you <br/>
can hit along with the resist rate being high:( still a healer for your pet <br/>
if you got one Helps  ALOT  or just have them nuke then zone again  then u <br/>
blast it to Death :)<br/>
For other places  i am not sure at all being that my mage is about lvl 20  I <br/>
hope this helps any at all  good luck :)<br/>
