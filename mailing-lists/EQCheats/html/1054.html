<b>Subject:</b> Re: possible big cheat for EQ.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487170652">I think one thing that ppl are ignoreing is that EQ logs you off if you <br/>
alt-tab out, and that your computer all but freezes up...but whatever.<br/>
<br/>
also there doesn&#39;t seem to be any way to float anything above EQ while in <br/>
game (I&#39;ve tried ICQ&#39;s floating thingy, didn&#39;t work).  so you&#39;d have to <br/>
write a hack to over come this and I&#39;m guessing that would be entirely <br/>
client side...either that or have 2 monitors ;)<br/>
<br/>
so even if cheat programs were developed (yeah right) than how would you <br/>
even get to them?<br/>
