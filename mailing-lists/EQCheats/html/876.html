<div id="ygrps-yiv-324363722"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Okay, that&#39;s what how I think things work.  Now for a couple of questions:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are there levels of faction above Warmly?<br/>
<br/>
no warm is the highest there is.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Quest wise: is there anything left besides turning in deathfist belts that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>will raise faction with FP militia? I&#39;d like a list of any quests and/or<br/>
kills that will raise faction with that group?  Lowering faction with the<br/>
knights is fine, since just killing orcs will raise it again.<br/>
<br/>
unsure about this<br/>
<br/>
Also, as I plan to be a world traveler, are there any kills that will<br/>
increase faction with vendors/guards in Grobb or Oggok that won&#39;t too<br/>
seriously damage faction with the smaller races?<br/>
<br/>
no clue<br/>
<br/>
Finally, on the CHA raising end, does the Leatherfoot Raider Quest really<br/>
require D&#39;Vinn&#39;s Dragoon Dirk as it appears?  Or are there just plain<br/>
&quot;dirks&quot; found on other dragoons that will work?<br/>
<br/>
D&#39;vinn&#39;s is usually the easiest to get, but any dragoon dirk will do.<br/>
Dragoon Zytl in West Commons also drops one.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are welcome :)</div>
