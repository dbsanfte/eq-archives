<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-97094006">I recently looted some mobs and have recieved the following items which I<br/>
+ACo-think+ACo- maybe for quests, but I don&#39;t have info on who or what they are for:<br/>
<br/>
Mallet Head<br/>
Mallet Handle<br/>
Metal Disk<br/>
<br/>
I got the first two in Befallen, the other somewhere in North Ro I think...<br/>
Can&#39;t remember...<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you know of anything they are for?  I cannot use them<br/>
(as far as I know) and the first two items I cannot even sell...<br/>
