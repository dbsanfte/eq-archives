<div id="ygrps-yiv-789712713">You can go to Unrest now. Beetles would be good,possibly solo. Might be low<br/>
blue to you now though. Get grouped up and start tackling jack-o-lanterns<br/>
and other lawn trash. Don&#39;t go in the house tho...bad juju...<br/>

Subject: [EQCheats] Where to go at my level?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone could tell me where I should be hunting as a level<br/>
12 bard. Ever since level 8 I&#39;ve been in Steamfront killing skeles and<br/>
clockworks. Now everything con&#39;s green (except for mino&#39;s, and they&#39;re<br/>
usually heavily camped). Where should I be hunting now? Crushbone is way too<br/>
overpopulated, on Tarew Marr at least. I just need somewhere to hunt until I<br/>
hit 14 then I&#39;ll go to Unrest. Thanks for any help.<br/>
