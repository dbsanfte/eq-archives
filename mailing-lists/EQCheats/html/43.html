<div id="ygrps-yiv-487458669"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Someone could &quot;bind affinity&quot; to you where you would get killed after getting killed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bah that is no exploit. In order for someone to bind you, two conditions<br/>
must be met. First and foremost, they have to be in your party. Being in<br/>
your party means you trust them (or that you are a frickin idiot to join<br/>
their party without knowing them) and give consent. The second condition<br/>
is that a spellcaster can only bind people in city areas (Highhold Pass<br/>
is considered a city however).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you have a pet and someone makes you invisible, the pet goes away.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This works on all classes cept Necromancers, which you have to use<br/>
Invisible to Undead on. Most consider it an exploit, I think it&#39;s just<br/>
damn clever.</div>
