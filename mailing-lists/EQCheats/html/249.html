<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796764828">I was talking about fighting MOB&#39;s when I said I only miss 1 out of 8<br/>
times. Monks stink because once your HPs are gone, you are toast.  You<br/>
forget that Paladins get root also.  We also have Stun which will freeze<br/>
your monk to allow us to heal up.  All of your quickness does not do you<br/>
any good if you can&#39;t move.<br/>
<br/>
Why is this going on this List anyway ?  I think we need to start a<br/>
EQbadmouth List for this.<br/>
<br/>
I never play PvP anyway because I think that it is stupid that someone<br/>
could just come up to you and kill you for no other reason.  PvP&#39;s are none<br/>
other than a bunch of greedy people that want to steal from other people.<br/>
That is why I am glad that the designers of this game were wise enough to<br/>
limit player killing.<br/>
