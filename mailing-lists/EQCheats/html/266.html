<div id="ygrps-yiv-793132227">Good Point Michael, however since I have no life (ha ha) I&#39;ll be doing the<br/>
work on it. I&#39;ve already gathered quite a library of things, it will be<br/>
database driven, and *will* be maintained.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to your submission!<br/>

its a good idea if it is carried through... so far i have yet to see a site<br/>
that really does that. No one takes the time to actually build a database of<br/>
stuff most rely on volunteer submissions wh8ich sucks because you dont get a<br/>
good response that way. Whoever runs a site needs to go out and do most of<br/>
the research and keep it up with all of the current patches once again I<br/>
have not yet seen this...<br/>

I think this would be a good forum to ask for this.  Currently I am<br/>
developing a site for EQ dedicated strictly to the items, how to get them,<br/>
and buy/sell them (in game only of course).  I&#39;m not interested in the<br/>
standard Leather Arms, etc. There are plenty of sites out there that deal<br/>
with this. I *am* interested in anything out of the ordinary, where it came<br/>
from and the quest associated with it. This is a full-on spoiler option,<br/>
which I have no personal problem with, and if you&#39;re subscribed to this list<br/>
neither should you.<br/>
<br/>
All I ask is 3 quick things for submissions: a screen shot displaying the<br/>
item and the stats on it, a brief description of how you came across it, and<br/>
the quest information associated. The second two are optional since even I<br/>
hate campers, but they&#39;d really help those of us who go get the item, then<br/>
leave the spawn to the others to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
A. Would EQ players go to this site?<br/>
B. Is this a good idea?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone wishing to help out will get credit on the site for the submissions<br/>
(of course).<br/>
