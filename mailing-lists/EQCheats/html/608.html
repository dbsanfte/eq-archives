<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987149708">what people dont seem to understand is that it is summer vacation.  all<br/>
the little kiddies are at home all day long now, and have alot of time to<br/>
waste away on eq.  i suspect when september rolls around and kids dont<br/>
have 16 hours/day to play eq, things will get better, at least until the<br/>
next school vacation...<br/>
