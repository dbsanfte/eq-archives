<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477650142">Requesting info on where the following weapons (all 2H blunts) can be<br/>
attained. IE. Zone, Mob, and level needed (or any parts you know).<br/>
<br/>
Dragonbone<br/>
<br/>
Man-O-War<br/>
<br/>
Spiritists Hammer (From the stats on this baby, I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s Fear Plane...)<br/>
<br/>
Any info on the GM given quest for Blued Two Handed Hammer as well.<br/>
<br/>
Hrm...spoilers.. Well, how about a mammoth cloak. Lots know where it is, in<br/>
case ya don&#39;t, here ye be. Permafrost, goblin Alchemist, I believe he&#39;s<br/>
behind a rock that acts like a door somewhere close to the preacher. He&#39;s<br/>
roughly a 2 hour spawn I believe. Common drop is mammoth leggings, arch<br/>
backpack (6 large slots, -25% weight), and his rare is Mammoth Cloak (VERY<br/>
highly sought after item...). Buddy camped for 10+ hours the other night and<br/>
never saw the cloak. Solo, 35th level, group, high 20s full group.<br/>
