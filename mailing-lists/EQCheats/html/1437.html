<div id="ygrps-yiv-279745434">Blocking the zone is illegal, yes. That&#39;s understandable.<br/>
<br/>
Helping the guards in their fight should NOT be illegal. If your fighting my<br/>
brethren, I&#39;m gonna do what I can to see that you all DIE (which is SQUAT<br/>
since I can&#39;t do crap to a NPC sides kill them). If I could, I&#39;d SoW all the<br/>
Barbarian guards, buff them with a Talisman of Tanarg, heal them, quickness<br/>
them, etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And, as far as I know, Barbarian guards are mostly left alone, and I&#39;m never<br/>
there anyways... Qeynos guards can bite my ass, as well as all the other<br/>
races guards. Kill them if you want ;-) I was kill Troll guards last night!<br/>
<br/>
And, if I blocked the zone on purpose to &#39;assit&#39; the guards, I&#39;d expect to<br/>
be banned.... That&#39;s lame.<br/>

Training guards and what not on you and blocking the zones is ILLEGAL. I am <br/>
a dark elf myself, and had a few friends of the &#39;good&#39;aligned races come <br/>
into Neriak&#39;s foreign quarters killing the guards. A few dark elves and <br/>
trolls decided to start training NPCs on them, and the trolls BLOCKED the <br/>
zone. No one could leave unless they gated or evaced.<br/>
<br/>
A GM was called on the scene, and the players harrassing were given an <br/>
official warning. My barbarian friend had died because of this zone <br/>
blocking, causing him to lose his level.<br/>
<br/>
Roleplaying is one thing...causing people to die, and harrassing them is a <br/>
totally different story.<br/>
