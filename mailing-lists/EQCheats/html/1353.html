&lt;&lt; Anyone have a map or guide or even seen one for Solusk A? I haven&#39;t been<br/>
 able to find squat...<br/>
 <br/>
 Or, any info would be nice... How many things would there be to fight at<br/>
 32nd level? Could I safely go in an check things out without getting<br/>
 attacked by every other mob there? Normal Invis work or there undead types?<br/>
 <br/>
 Thanks &gt;&gt;<br/>

You could do well in the Bartender room with a good group or even solo maybe. <br/>
 Bartender spawns fairly often and drops Drake Hide Leggings.  I was only <br/>
23rd lvl when I camped the bar room with 2 full groups of guildmates.  There <br/>
is also a Goblin Drunkard that drops a foreman tunic I think.  I just <br/>
scratched the surface of SOL A and I know there is a lot of other good stuff <br/>
there.  I saw no Undead there, but there are spellcasting gobs like in <br/>
Runnyeye who may be able to see invisi. <br/>
<br/>
Just so you know, Sol A can get real rough.  While we held the bar room for 5 <br/>
hours with only one death (er, me - thank god for resurections) and got 7 <br/>
pairs of drake hide leggings (wohooo!) in the final hour (the 6th) our 32 lvl <br/>
Monk went to pull and somehow came back with a huge train.  I mean HUGE!!!  <br/>
and then the room spawn occured. AHHHHHHH.  The battle raged for about 7 <br/>
minutes and in the end, 11 guildmates, half over lvl 30, lay dead and one <br/>
frail, scared out of his robe wizard sat medding (no mana to gate - <br/>
ahhhhhhhh) surrounded by 3 goblins who survived.  The gobs just stood over me <br/>
not attacking as I tried to med up enough mana to gate.  I&#39;ve never been so <br/>
scared in my life.  Afraid to stand up and gate for fear of gaining thier <br/>
attention, I cried for help to the other folks in the dungeon - no help came. <br/>
 I decided to go for the gate, standing up literally under the chin of a <br/>
goblin wizard, I appprehensivley began reciting the words for my gate spell <br/>
hoping the gobs would not hear.  They did not, or they wanted me to live so I <br/>
could spread the word about the worst massacre I&#39;ve ever seen.  Safely gating <br/>
back to High Hold Keep, I have yet to return to Sol A, but will revenge my <br/>
bothers deaths someday.<br/>
