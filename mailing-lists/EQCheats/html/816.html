Your Lawyer obviously doesn&#39;t know squat about electronic mail, laws against<br/>
spaming or anything else to do with the internet.<br/>
<br/>
In order for any contract to be &quot;Binding&quot;  it must be signed or witnessed.<br/>
If there was a way to send a registered E-mail, that showed the letter had<br/>
been read by the correct recipient then yes Nick you could file a harassment<br/>
suit.  As it is your suit or claim to suit is little more than pathetic<br/>
attempt to bully a person on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly,  all forms of suit are not punishable by monetary gain.  You are<br/>
talking a form of harassment.  If anything a restraining order could be<br/>
leveled on Mr. Clark but in no way shape or form will there be monetary<br/>
compensation.<br/>
<br/>
Give us all a break and stop with this thread.<br/>

&gt; Here is how my lawyer put it to me.  If someone sends you unsolicited<br/>
email<br/>
&gt; once it is fine, but if you warn them after that email saying the<br/>
following<br/>
&gt; or close to it &quot;any further emails to this address will cost a certain<br/>
&gt; amount of money to proofread&quot; it is legally binding.  If the person does<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; make a payment within 3 months you can take them to small claims court and<br/>
&gt; charge interest on your time and work.  When you warn them, and they send<br/>
&gt; you another email just correct it and send it back to them.  Afterwards<br/>
&gt; start litigation.  This is an excellent way to stop hate/spam/annoying<br/>
&gt; emails.<br/>
