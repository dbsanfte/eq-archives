&gt; famley members who play this game will be writing sony and they will <br/>
&gt; shortly and most likely <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, some of their changes are stupid, though others are brilliant. Most of<br/>
the &quot;balancing&quot; falls on the stupid side, though.<br/>
<br/>
But some, like the nerfing of Uber buffs on lowbies, is because almost<br/>
everyone at SOE plays PvP. While I absolutely hate being unable to get KEI (I<br/>
never played without it on a blue server, from the first moment I can get to<br/>
Nexus alive on up, starting at first level), PotG and such, on PvP servers<br/>
(where I play a lot now) it&#39;s a wonderful blessing, as the cowardly Player<br/>
Killers can&#39;t buff themselves up to invulnerability for the times they&#39;re<br/>
hanging around zonelines murdering everyone who comes through.<br/>
<br/>
They shouldn&#39;t have nerfed Uber spells, but they almost certainly just got<br/>
fed up with being butchered by 16th level PKers with 2000 HP and unlimited<br/>
mana.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be quiting this game, which in effect may lead to my defection as <br/>
&gt; well due to the incressing dificulty of this so call &quot;class balancing&quot;<br/>
&gt; now mind you this is total horse shit on sonys part, and they are <br/>
&gt; taking all the fun and adventur out of this game by making every <br/>
&gt; thing totaly impossible and un reachable, now i know not every one <br/>
&gt; feels like this but not every one is a druid who with out c3 can <br/>
&gt; cast no more that 3 spells with out haveing to sit for 20 minets and <br/>
&gt; meddititing for example<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They WANT you to quit, but you&#39;re not supposed to do it for another few<br/>
months, until EQ2 comes out. They are, in essence, giving way too much fuel<br/>
to the EverQuest fire, so that it will burn really bright until November (or<br/>
whatever the current release date), then go out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What im asking my fellow everquest players and there friends is for <br/>
&gt; there suport in the effort we are trying to get sony to see, that <br/>
&gt; they are systematicly desimating a game that once was fun and <br/>
&gt; enjoyable. Once this letter is writin i will have it in <br/>
&gt; the forums were i can with sonys email which we have directed these <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think they&#39;ll rub their hands together in glee.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; coments.We would appriciate the suport of our fellow gamers and <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Spellcheck those complaints you send to them, it&#39;ll improve their crediblity.<br/>
Seriously.<br/>

I like to believe that people in the long run are going to do more to promote<br/>
peace than our governments.  Indeed, I think that people want peace so much<br/>
that one of these days governments had better get out of the way and let them<br/>
have it.         -- Dwight D. Eisenhower<br/>
