<b>Subject:</b> Aradune is THE GM Guys...chill out ! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-419385689">Brad is one of the people that MADE EQ...Aradune is his &#39;flagship&#39; character<br/>
...he doesn&#39;t HAVE to &#39;earn&#39; his experience OR his equipment.  Word has it<br/>
that brad also plays a &#39;real&#39; ranger character that he actually<br/>
PLAYS...getting his own equipment, having to earn his own experience.<br/>
All the whining about Brad shouldn&#39;t THIS and Brad shouldn&#39;t THAT is a bunch<br/>
of BS.<br/>
Brad spent the last three or four YEARS of his life working on this game!<br/>
(For all of you that aren&#39;t QUITE sure....that&#39;s REAL LIFE years!!!   :)<br/>
If any of you spent 3-4 years of your life working to develop a product, are<br/>
you saying you wouldn&#39;t take advantage of USING that product?  PLEASE!!!<br/>
If Brad wants to go kill a WAY high level NPC, or slay a dragon, don&#39;t ya<br/>
think he&#39;s EARNED that right?  We wouldn&#39;t even be having this discussion if<br/>
it weren&#39;t for Brad&#39;s dedication to this GAME (please try and remember that<br/>
it a game!!).<br/>
There has been SO much stuff (magic equipment, quests, skill and magic<br/>
tweaks) added to the game in the last couple of weeks, and all you guys can<br/>
argue about is why the Avenger is Paladin Only?  I play a bunch of different<br/>
characters, and I love playin them ALL.  I know I could get to the upper<br/>
levels faster if I just stuck to one character, but I&#39;m having FUN.<br/>
My suggestion is this: if its FUN for you to argue about why Brad&#39;s lvl 50<br/>
Ranger can use a Paladin-Only Fiery Avenger, than go ahead and argue.  But<br/>
if you like the world that Brad created, than cut the guy a little slack -<br/>
AND GO PLAY THE GAME!!!<br/>

Just so yall know..  Aradune is not decked out as he was in beta.  BETA<br/>
was just that.. BETA.  In release, he&#39;s just as watched as the rest of<br/>
us.  He has to earn everything just like the rest of us.  He may be high<br/>
lvl (i don&#39;t know) but i assure you he&#39;s not packin anything he didn&#39;t<br/>
earn.  As for the green splinted platemail..  I talked to a lvl 48<br/>
cleric and he said his group still had a couple levels to go before they<br/>
could make a run at getting some of it.<br/>
