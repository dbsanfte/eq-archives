<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521681429">Oh and a word of warning about evil eyes.  Pre patch, I took one down<br/>
with no problem whatsoever.  I had a 70 MR and ever spell it cast washed<br/>
over me.  I tried it again after they made Tashan unresistable(or close<br/>
to).  I had to zone this time.  That is even fighting a green con eye(it<br/>
was blue risky the first time).<br/>

&gt; I would not count this as consistent &quot;cheat&quot; without further testing.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; have heard of this many times, but personally haven&#39;t been charmed but<br/>
&gt; once,<br/>
&gt; and that was when I first started playing the game.  But I was once in<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; group where every person got charmed but me, the monk in the party<br/>
&gt; tried the<br/>
&gt; sitting trick and it successfully slowed her down.  Enough that she<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; cause too many problems for the rest of the party.  But I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; canceled the charm.  I feel that further testing is required.  Maybe a<br/>
&gt; couple of people on the list with the ability to charm can try it with<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; friends?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a related note:  On that foray against the evil eye....  The other<br/>
&gt; 5<br/>
&gt; people all got charmed in our group...  they started attacking while I<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; AFK, so I got there halfway through the battle.  I unloaded all my<br/>
&gt; manna at<br/>
&gt; the eye and successfully killed it.  I got an experience message, but<br/>
&gt; nobody<br/>
&gt; else in the group did.  My current theory is that once you are<br/>
&gt; charmed, you<br/>
&gt; count as a monster, and won&#39;t get the experience message for any group<br/>
&gt; kills<br/>
&gt; during that time.  Unfortunately, this is also hard to test.<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately<br/>
&gt; that mishap resulted in the death of more than half our party... but<br/>
&gt; when I<br/>
&gt; looked at my XP-o-meter, I got a huge chunk of XP from the fight (if<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; theory is correct, I got all of the XP)<br/>

&gt; When fighting evil eyes in the gorge the other night, I hit the sit<br/>
&gt; button<br/>
&gt; while charmed somehow. The result was canceling the charm, which<br/>
&gt; allowed me<br/>
&gt; to continue with my battle. I managed to do this repeatedly throughout<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; night. This could be a coincidence or an actual bug in the game, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; sure. Since I felt it was cheating, I quit doing it and left the<br/>
&gt; gorge;<br/>
&gt; after all, I only wanted another Polished Bone Bracer ;)<br/>
