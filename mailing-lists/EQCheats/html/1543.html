&gt;According to Everlore, here&#39;s how to check if you have enough<br/>
&gt;faction:<br/>
&gt;Note: An easy way to check your faction for this quest is to go to Renth <br/>
&gt;and say &quot;I will hunt the murderer.&quot; If he gives you more information about <br/>
&gt;it, you have high enough faction to complete the quest. A great way to <br/>
&gt;raise your faction is to give gnoll fangs to Lysbeth McNaff in sets of <br/>
&gt;three. She is at the Pit of Doom.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I believe that you need more than just amiable, but not so much that it&#39;s <br/>
&gt;warmly, so somewhere inbetween the two.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt;Subject: [EQCheats] Jared: Why you have to be that way??<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Does anybody know what faction (amiable, warmly, etc) that you need with <br/>
&gt;&gt;the Halas merchants to perform the Langseax quests???<br/>
&gt;&gt;I spent about 3 hours running around Black Burrow the last couple of days, <br/>
&gt;&gt;killing anything that moved.  It seems like one out of about 10 gnolls <br/>
&gt;&gt;drops a Gnoll Tooth (fang??).  I&#39;ve collected 38 of them...killed maybe <br/>
&gt;&gt;300 - 400 gnolls.  Tedious...VERY tedious.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Anyway...I was going to try the Langseax quest next time I can get<br/>
&gt;&gt;together with my Druid friend (for tracking and SoW...heard this is useful <br/>
&gt;&gt;for following the dog during the quest)...but I was hoping somebody could <br/>
&gt;&gt;give me an idea of what faction will work so I&#39;m not wasting (any more) <br/>
&gt;&gt;time.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tha faction ya need is a &quot;high&quot; amiable.  Jist use tha test mentioned above <br/>
ta make sure ye kin do it.<br/>
<br/>
Arrrggghh! Ah wish Ah could ramember tha exact kind but Ah thin&#39; it&#39;s &quot;a <br/>
patrolling gnoll&quot; that has tha teeth most of tha time.  While Ah&#39;ve looted <br/>
teeth/fangs from most everykind, Ah noticed tha patrolling gnolls seemed to <br/>
huv them more often than not.  After Ah realized this Ah started huntin&#39; <br/>
jist them.  Found Ah didn&#39; waste as much time after that.<br/>
<br/>
Ah don&#39; thin&#39; trackin&#39; is really needed (Ah&#39;ve done tha quest more than a <br/>
dozen times an&#39; never used a tracker) but a SoW is a MUST!  That wolf sure <br/>
can run!  It&#39;s almost as if he&#39;s got a SoW... err.. OK... he does huv one... <br/>
after all he is a Wolf :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, when ye turn in tha teeth/fangs, ye don&#39;t HUV to turn them in 3 at a <br/>
time.. it&#39;s just that tha exp an&#39; faction is given on every 3rd tooth/fang.  <br/>
What Ah suggest ye do is turn them in 1 at a time until ye git tha <br/>
exp/faction.  After that, start turnin&#39; in 3 at a time.  Reason why is if <br/>
someboady turned in an &quot;extra&quot; tooth/fang, ye only need ta turn in 2 more <br/>
fur tha exp/faction.<br/>
