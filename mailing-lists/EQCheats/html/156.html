&gt;	This is all well and good for medium wearers. And it is fairly well <br/>
&gt;known that the other Karanas yield decent LQ, MQ, and HQ Bear pelts for the <br/>
&gt;larger types (as well as the Kodiaks to the East). However, with several <br/>

&gt;	And while on the subject, any use for LQ pelts besides resale for <br/>
&gt;coin? Tailors use MQ (studded) and HQ (Reinforced, which last I heard wasn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;working). LQ uses?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I found that to get any quality wolf pelts it&#39;s best to kill the wolves in<br/>
Qeynos hills. I had never gotten anything other than a ruined pelt or some<br/>
sort of skin before I tried the wolves there, in just a few hours I had<br/>
several HQ and med wolf pelts. Reinforced does work, it&#39;s only one or two<br/>
points of ac better than leather but I have successfully made a few pieces.<br/>
As to low quality pelts, there is a quest that uses bear and wolf pelts of<br/>
low quality in QH but that&#39;s it. Does anyone have any tips for me on where<br/>
it is best to get HQ bear pelts? I have killed countless bears for a very<br/>
long time and have only gotten my hands on 4 HQ bear pelts to work with.<br/>
And two of those I got lucky and found and bought from a store.<br/>
