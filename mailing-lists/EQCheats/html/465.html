<b>Subject:</b> Blade Molds - possible spoiler <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-220460086">I&#39;ve asked this time and time again, yet no one seems to know exactly what <br/>
these are for - blade molds. Specifically the ones that are stackable that <br/>
you get from the same NPC&#39;s you talk to to initiate the Screaming Mace <br/>
Quest. I have theories as to what these molds are for, but would like to <br/>
know if anyone out there knows for sure</div>
