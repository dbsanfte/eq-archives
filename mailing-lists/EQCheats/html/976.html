<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036038723">There is a difference between a small cheat that you and your friend know to<br/>
get a little extra cash, and a third party program that anyone can get.<br/>
Cheating isnt any fun if it wrecks the game, and third party programs are<br/>
one of the main reason UO was destroyed for me.<br/>
<br/>
So far there is no way to alt-tab and get any functionality out of a third<br/>
party program.   I hope it stays that way.<br/>

&gt; Ok, does anyone remember the days of Diablo where you&#39;d just Alt-Tab over<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; your cheat program?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; well, I was on ICQ the other day and I got a msg, and not thinking I<br/>
&gt; alt-tab&#39;ed once, nothing, twice and I was out of EQ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, my mouse was fairly locked up, but the key board still worked, I<br/>
could<br/>
&gt; alt-tab between other programs.  (only had ICQ open)  when the<br/>
CTRL-ALT-DEL<br/>
&gt; window came up (I pushed em) I could again use my mouse while it was up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; when I tried to go back into EQ it didn&#39;t work, but it still takes time to<br/>
&gt; camp out your character eh? :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m thinking this may be able to allow some cheat programs, but probably<br/>
&gt; not, everything seems to me server side except for hot keys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But, I am not a good enough programmer to write something that might be<br/>
able<br/>
&gt; to take advantage of this, nor do I know anyone who is.  If you are give<br/>
&gt; your input and see if anything works eh?  hehehe...if anyone does figure<br/>
&gt; something out they&#39;d be a god to EQ cheaters :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; hope something comes of this,<br/>
