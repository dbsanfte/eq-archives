<div id="ygrps-yiv-103077144">Also related to the dark circlet: I was there last night for about 5 hours with a friend of mine... Trez spawned 3 times during that period and had the circlet every time. The times he does not spawn a magician spawns in his place...  I was a lvl 31 wizard and my partern was a lvl 39 druid, although the ele&#39;s and magicians are all green to me, and Trez himself was blue and goes down in two hits for 250 and one hit for 110. As for the trash magicians i kill them as soon as they spawn before they are allowed to summon there pet. Personally i think a lvl 30 wizard could hold the room solo, with minimum risk, but i liked having another person for security..<br/>

Trezdon is a Necromancer. If you speak with Ulan Meadowgreen (named Centaur in<br/>
S Karana that gives the quest), he will tell you a story about an evil Dark Elf<br/>
Necromancer, blah blah blah. The Dark Circlet is actually a pretty decent piece<br/>
of headgear but is NEC only. I think it&#39;s better than the Savants Cap but not<br/>
as good as the Runed Circlet. I&#39;m sure after you get your greaves, if you&#39;re<br/>
ever back in Najena camping JBoots or something, pick up another Dark Circlet<br/>
and you might be able to sell it for a good buck.<br/>
