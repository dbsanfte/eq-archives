 I am going on the road for 2 weeks and may get a laptop so I can play while <br/>
 travelling.  Anyone ever see a EQ played on Laptop?  Is it possible? Any <br/>
 advice as to what kind of not to expensive laptop to get? <br/>
 <br/>
 I do not expect the performance of my desk top - just something playable :)<br/>
