&gt; a necro vs a monk would be a great fight but i still think the monk would win.  unless on the pvp<br/>
&gt; server.  because the necro&#39;s pets don&#39;t work in duels (last i checked)  the only server they work<br/>
&gt; on is the pvp server.  do necro&#39;s get root? i don&#39;t remember if they do then they could own monks<br/>
&gt; but i dont&#39; think they get it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I assure you the necro would win.  I&#39;ve watched it with my own eyes.  A<br/>
lvl 30 necro in unrest one day spanked EVERY person who stepped up to<br/>
them.. with over half life left after each fight.  Monks didn&#39;t do very<br/>
good at all against the necro.  Who needs root when you have fear. <br/>
Necros own in pvp.  Find out for yourself by fighting one.  You&#39;ll get<br/>
owned.  Melee classes don&#39;t do so hot in pvp.</div>
