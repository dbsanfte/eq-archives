<div id="ygrps-yiv-530021370">Heh, I *think* this is on topic... it&#39;s so hard to tell anymore.<br/>
<br/>
It appears the three main factors in prices are faction, charisma, and vendor<br/>
multiple.  <br/>
<br/>
Some vendors just sell for more.  Sonsa Fromp in one of the huts in Misty<br/>
Thicket, for example, sells chain armor for a little over twice Twippie Diggs&#39;<br/>
prices in Rivervale.  Infact, if you ask him about it, he&#39;ll warn you.  <br/>
<br/>
Charisma is a little more nebulous... I&#39;m a bard with pretty high charisma<br/>
(around 110 with all of my gear on) and prices seem to be generally pretty<br/>
good, but it&#39;s harder to measure against someone else due to faction.  But it<br/>
definately makes a difference.  Get a few pieces of plus CHA stuff and check<br/>
prices with and without them.  Things definately get better for people with<br/>
higher charisma... to a point.  Then there&#39;s faction.<br/>
<br/>
Faction can really do a number on you.  The order of faction (as I remember<br/>
it) goes &quot;threatens to attack,&quot; &quot;glares threateningly,&quot; &quot;glowers dubiously,&quot;<br/>
&quot;indifferent, &quot;amiable,&quot; &quot;kindly&quot;, &quot;warmly,&quot; and if there are things higher<br/>
than warmly, I haven&#39;t gotten my faction with anyone that high yet.  Even<br/>
within each of these &quot;bands&quot; you can have higher or lower faction it seems,<br/>
these are just breaking points.  It&#39;s possible to get one price, kill a few<br/>
things that change faction with that vendor, and then get a slightly<br/>
higher/lower price; even though the &quot;con&quot; didn&#39;t change.  These are usually<br/>
pretty small price changes, prices seem to change by a much greater degree<br/>
when you hit a new band.  I.E. Given the same CHA, there may be some small<br/>
changes between different levels of indifferent, but when you hit amiable, the<br/>
change is much more in your favor.  Of course this is easier to see on very<br/>
expensive items than on flasks of water or fishing bait.<br/>
<br/>
So basically, someone who hates you might give you slightly better prices if<br/>
your charming or better looking (which also seems to be in the realm of<br/>
charisma), but even if you&#39;re a complete ass people who love you will cut you<br/>
a deal (which makes sense to me).  This particularly makes sense from the<br/>
perspective of &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s an arrogant bastard, but he keeps us safe from the<br/>
orcs.  Cut a few coppers off of that water flask.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As far as race/class modifications to prices, these seem to be faction based. <br/>
Rouges can&#39;t have a hard time at first in places like Freeport (at least mine<br/>
did), but once you&#39;ve raised faction with &quot;Coalition_Tradefolk&quot; (which seems<br/>
to be the primary vendor faction in East and West Freeport, not sure about<br/>
North) they&#39;ll sell to you just fine.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that&#39;s what how I think things work.  Now for a couple of questions: <br/>
Are there levels of faction above Warmly?  Quest wise: is there anything left<br/>
besides turning in deathfist belts that will raise faction with FP militia? <br/>
I&#39;d like a list of any quests and/or kills that will raise faction with that<br/>
group?  Lowering faction with the knights is fine, since just killing orcs<br/>
will raise it again.  Also, as I plan to be a world traveler, are there any<br/>
kills that will increase faction with vendors/guards in Grobb or Oggok that<br/>
won&#39;t too seriously damage faction with the smaller races?  Finally, on the<br/>
CHA raising end, does the Leatherfoot Raider Quest really require D&#39;Vinn&#39;s<br/>
Dragoon Dirk as it appears?  Or are there just plain &quot;dirks&quot; found on other<br/>
dragoons that will work?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
<br/>
Wow, that was a lot longer than I thought it would be.<br/>

<br/>
Everyone has to remember that just because you have HUGE CHA stats, doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean you going to get<br/>
BETTER prices.<br/>
<br/>
This is where your faction for that person, or area comes into play. If they<br/>
con to you *When you<br/>
target and click c*, dubiously, then your going to get good prices, if they<br/>
con indifferently, then<br/>
your going to get awful prices, now if they con admiably, your rocken the<br/>
prices will be low, and<br/>
thus a high CHA will help you out in this area indeed.<br/>
<br/>
So, it doesn&#39;t matter if you have high CHA, if they don&#39;t con right ya paying<br/>
more, If you have low<br/>
CHA, and con high, ya pay less, go figure but that&#39;s how it works out.<br/>
