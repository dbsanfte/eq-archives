<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685411810">So.. Upon logging in yesterday.. to my dismay.. the Eruds tonic that I had<br/>
gotten for the Stein quest.. has now changed to a No Drop Item. On sunday it<br/>
was lore.. now its no drop.. sigh.... So I am out of the league on this one<br/>
now.. and upon looking the Mogguk stein is now implimented.. so does this<br/>
mean that the Glowing stein is out of the game ?<br/>
<br/>
Guess i will have to save up some PP to get mine or hope that lilinye wants<br/>
to do the quest twice.. sigh..<br/>
