<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502137877">I checked with Nora Sparkles out in West Commons and she does charge alot more<br/>
for gems then any other merchant. So much so there was 100 plat difference<br/>
between her and the merchant in N. freeport. I&#39;m thinking they jacked the rates<br/>
on her because she might sell to the evil races.</div>
