<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828726762">What you failed to mention is your &#39;webpage devoted to cheats and<br/>
hacking in EverQuest&#39; is nothing more than an ad.  It doesn&#39;t list a<br/>
single &#39;cheat&#39; or &#39;hack&#39;.  To make matters worse, in your attempt to<br/>
fool people to your website you provide incomplete information about a<br/>
cheat that no longer works.  The teaser you give hasn&#39;t even been<br/>
verified by you?  What kind of quality assurance is that from a project<br/>
that you&#39;re trying to profit from?  Feel free to post cheats or bugs,<br/>
but please keep this bullshit off the list.<br/>

&gt; Ahh..I&#39;ll go check it out today and see if it doesn&#39;t work anymore<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, How does everyone feel of hacking.  I know it is dangerous<br/>
&gt; because Verant is always looking out for that stuff and it could get<br/>
&gt; your account banned.  My website also has info about how to hack to<br/>
&gt; raise items stats, make your character run at SOW speed, ect..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let me know how you feel about hacking info<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject:    [EQCheats] Everquest Cheats over 30 of them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I started a website devoted to cheats and hacking in<br/>
&gt; everquest...I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; post a few over the next few days and see how you like them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My website is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquestbugs.com">http://www.everquestbugs.com</a><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Here&#39;s a grouping bug that lets a 7th member in your group<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This 7th member won&#39;t be able to talk in the group but I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; told that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; he will able to read what the other member in the group say.<br/>
&gt; This<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 7th member will not sure up on the grouping list. Also this 7th<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; member will gain exp as if he were in the group.  I have no tried<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this bug so I can&#39;t verify that it works but here it goes:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;       If you have 6 people in a group have one of them disband<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; then reinvite him,...then invite the 7th person and have them join<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; certain order (not sure what order so you might have to play<br/>
&gt; around<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with this one).  This bug was submitted by a member of my website<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; he himself said that he was in a group with 7 people because at<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; point the 7th person went link dead and it told the group the he<br/>
&gt; went<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; linkdead.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks and let me know if you want more cheats or you can just go<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my website,<br/>
