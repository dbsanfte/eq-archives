<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528489715">ok 2 trys each time in my large sewing kit...<br/>
<br/>
slot Row, Coloum<br/>
slot 1,1: medium quality cat pelt<br/>
slot 1,2: tunic pattern<br/>
slot 2,1: stud<br/>
slot 2,2: stud<br/>
slot 3,1: stud<br/>
slot 3,2: stud<br/>
slot 4,1: stud<br/>
<br/>
order shouldn&#39;t matter, no items were stacked (studs can&#39;t stack if I <br/>
remember correctly) and both times got the &quot;does not combine&quot;<br/>
<br/>
needless to say I was not happy, I&#39;ve dumped about 60-70 plat into smithing <br/>
and a bunch into tailoring (not as much) b/c I&#39;m a druid and I want to make <br/>
my own armor...I hope it works soon, but I don&#39;t want to try again...too <br/>
much loss of money when it doesn&#39;t work :).<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

PS..the guide thought it was a bug and was going to report back the items I <br/>
lost and that it happened so I don&#39;t know what&#39;ll happen, I doubt I&#39;ll get <br/>
back what I Lost.<br/>
