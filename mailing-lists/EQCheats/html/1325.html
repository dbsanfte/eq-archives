&lt;&lt; I believe problem is some enchanter spell, because i was<br/>
 fighting with necros many times and only if enchanter was nearby i was<br/>
 facing such problem. I was feared and charmed before and it never cause<br/>
 me such problems, so single charm or fear is ok.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

I think you are correct.  I am fighting Evil Eyes (enchanters) in Beholders <br/>
and this has happened to me three times and also to my partner.  THis is <br/>
serious BUG!!!!  It happens to me only sometimes, but only when I have been <br/>
casted on by an EE and usually after being Charmed.  the only way I can get <br/>
out of it is by Disconnecting.<br/>
