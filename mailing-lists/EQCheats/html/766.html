<div id="ygrps-yiv-860097484">Well with my dwarf, who has only 60 charisma, I fought in Misty Thicket for<br/>
awhile at young levels and killed a *bunch* of gobs and turned in beeds and<br/>
such, and when I get them to judge me amiably, milk went from costing 7<br/>
copper at indifferent, to 6.  As well as a minor change in the food I bought<br/>
there.  Maybe only certain vendors continue to charge less, not sure.. oh<br/>
and there is a definite difference in the amount you get paid between those<br/>
two factions as well.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are three factors that I know of that play into pricing from<br/>
&gt;vendors: charisma, faction, and vendor multiple. As a High Elf<br/>
&gt;Enchanter, I have a reasonably high base charisma, many charisma items,<br/>
&gt;and a charisma spell. After some experimentation, I have come to the<br/>
&gt;conclusion that charisma&#39;s effect on pricing maxes at just over 100.<br/>
&gt;Higher charisma than that makes no difference in pricing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also have spells which can improve my faction with vendors, and have<br/>
&gt;found that faction higher than &quot;looks at you indifferently&quot; makes no<br/>
&gt;difference in pricing. If it&#39;s lower than that, your price will be<br/>
&gt;worse, but better won&#39;t improve prices any more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The final factor is the vendor multiple. Some vendors just sell things<br/>
&gt;for a higher base price. Charisma and faction still have an effect, but<br/>
&gt;the range of possible prices is higher.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s what I know about vendor pricing. Good luck.<br/>

&gt; Ok, since I&#39;ve seen a ton of prices variances, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;posting this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Your CHA has a LOT to do with the pricing. There seems<br/>
&gt;to be a cap at a CHA<br/>
&gt; of 117 for the Star Rubies at a little over 68pp each.<br/>
&gt;The lower your<br/>
&gt; charisma, the higher the gems will cost. I&#39;d not like to<br/>
&gt;think that anyone<br/>
&gt; will debate this, since I&#39;m fairly certain that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;applicable to everyone.<br/>
