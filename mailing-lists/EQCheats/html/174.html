<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821824033">I to am interested in where the Bull Smasher is found. A high elf, cleric<br/>
friend of mine has one and WAS using it up until about  3 weeks ago when it<br/>
changed and he could no longer equip it. Now, only the little people can use<br/>
it. We were curious where it came from though since he bought it and the<br/>
seller wouldn&#39;t disclose her source.<br/>
