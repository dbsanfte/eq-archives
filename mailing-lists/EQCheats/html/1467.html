<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767665345">it&#39;s all old players makeing new characters, and new ppl starting...I think <br/>
it&#39;s usually old people that want to be the &quot;gods&quot; of the server and power <br/>
level really fast to get to 50 first...either that or it&#39;s people that are <br/>
sick of others twinking so they choose a server with no high level <br/>
characters (at least for about a week or so).<br/>
