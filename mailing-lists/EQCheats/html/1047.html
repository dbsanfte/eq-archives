<div id="ygrps-yiv-671349625">b/c CLurg has his own faction, he&#39;s in the ogre city and you need to give <br/>
him a book you get in Freeport that is no drop.  therefore only enchanters <br/>
can (with spells) get high enought faction.  There was one ogre warrior that <br/>
I know of that did this quest (the first PC to do it FYI), but he has since <br/>
stopped running the quest for ppl.<br/>
<br/>
high level is when you get one spell of there&#39;s...it&#39;s some faction spell.<br/>
