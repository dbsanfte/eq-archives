<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888329801">Several items over the last few weeks (Jboots and PGT most assuredly, also<br/>
assorted others) have had the rate at which they spawn and load turned down<br/>
by about 25% to 33% (give or take).<br/>
<br/>
Basically, all da cool shit.... well, if it wasn&#39;t whoopin&#39; imbalancing in<br/>
some way, it wouldn&#39;t be COOL, now would it? Dev team sees this, sez &quot;Uh-oh,<br/>
too much of dat particular flavor be in da mix&quot; and tweaks it a bit.<br/>
Naturally, they don&#39;t SAY this.... half the people in the game would be<br/>
pissed as hell and the other half would haul ass to that location to get it<br/>
before it is &quot;too late.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had to pry this info outta a Guide one night after waiting 6.5 frigging<br/>
hours for a PGT (my fourth, but hey, man&#39;s gotta eat you know?), also my<br/>
experience has been that some stuff is just not loading as frequently.<br/>
<br/>
ESPECIALLY Jboots.... it just about happened overnight awhile back... expect<br/>
jboots once a day. Maybe.</div>
