<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047002315">Question one I can answer.  Tinkerer bag is BOUGHT off a gnome NPC in SolA.<br/>
Better save your coppers though.  It costs around 5000-7000pp depending on<br/>
faction and charisma<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello all! Well met all you fellow EQ &quot;Cheaters.&quot; he he! Well... I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; fairly <br/>
&gt; new to the list and wanted to change things up a bit and touch on 2 new <br/>
&gt; subjects...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Where in the world can you find a BAG OF TINKERER? I&#39;ve only read about<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; this item and never seen one in game. I understand that it&#39;s 10-Slots and <br/>
&gt; everything placed inside is WEIGHTLESS!!! Wow! Is this bought from a<br/>
&gt; hidden <br/>
&gt; NPC? Looted from a MOB? Who knows? Anyone with any information on this<br/>
&gt; care <br/>
&gt; to share?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) I am also interested in MAXIMUM POWER GAMING! Oh no... let the RP&#39;ers <br/>
&gt; flame begin. he he! What I mean is this... Can someone direct me to a web <br/>
&gt; site or provide our fine list of &quot;cheaters&quot; some SOLID information on what<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; MOBS provide the BEST xp at what level(s). Surely this information must be<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; out there somewhere... Or better yet, let&#39;s start a list and share our own<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; experiences on what we have found individually that gives GREAT xp at <br/>
&gt; certain levels.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s my contribution on the Fastest XP/Level discussion... I just<br/>
&gt; recently <br/>
&gt; started a Wizard and I was AMAZED how fast my XP rose while fighting GIANT<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BATS in BBlock Mountains at level 8-9. The bats don&#39;t SWARM to protect<br/>
&gt; each <br/>
&gt; other and there are always plenty to be found at night in the area around <br/>
&gt; the crossroads.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone else? I assume that I can speak for all of us when I say &quot;All <br/>
&gt; levels/zones/MOBS would be GREATLY appreciated! Let&#39;s gain some XP thru<br/>
&gt; our <br/>
&gt; group! BTW... I tend to SOLO a lot due to &quot;multitasking&quot; at home during<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; night. You know... family stuff. he he! The tip on the Giant Bats was a<br/>
&gt; SOLO <br/>
&gt; tip.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Until next time... great &quot;CHEATING&quot; (errr... sharing knowlege) and best of<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; luck in NORRATH!<br/>
