<b>Subject:</b> Fast ways to level as a Paladin, Druid, or Shaman? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929839727">If you have some ways to quick level for any of these classes ( Druid and<br/>
Shaman tactics should be pretty much the same ), please let me know. I am<br/>
trying to find good spots where I can level very quickly maybe by using DoT<br/>
spells or something like that. Please give me all the info you can.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
