<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137248034">I have seen a few changes myself in perma. Things such as the preacher not<br/>
having anything but money on him. Also I used to get chain and the odd<br/>
piece of bronze from gobbies now I rarely get anything besides some cash.<br/>
The arch and preacher do not spawn as often either. Also the preacher seems<br/>
to spawn on a regular basis with a FS warhammer now and nothing else on<br/>
him. Truly depressing.<br/>

&gt;After the patch Ive notice a few changes in Permafrost on loot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was in perma last night for 5 hours or so and only looted one bronze<br/>
&gt;sword, usually we walk away with lots of rawhide armor and lots of FS<br/>
&gt;weapons. Most all the weapons i looted last night were all Rusty, I am lvl<br/>
&gt;24 and we were taking blues and whites and yellows.<br/>
&gt;Also the archaelogist and the preacher never spawned while i was there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone else see any difference?<br/>
