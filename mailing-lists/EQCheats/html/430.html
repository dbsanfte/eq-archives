<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685977819">Depends on what you mean as Mid-Level. True Mid level, like 25-30, yeah, I<br/>
think it&#39;s really good. You can find low level goblins (green to a 12th<br/>
leveler), and everything else is like 18-20+. Not much in the middle of<br/>
that. <br/>
<br/>
As far as the BIBS, sorry, not sure. I *think* it&#39;s on the goblin chieftain<br/>
o king, whatever, but, really, I&#39;m making that up. I don&#39;t honestly know.<br/>
Heh...<br/>

Hiya all!<br/>
I&#39;m lookin for some info (*spoil* me, PLEASE!) on the BIBS.  I know its in<br/>
Runneyeye, but was looking for more specifics on the location, the MOB that<br/>
carries it, group lvl needed to get to / obtain the sword, etc, etc.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t spent much time in Runneyeye...is it a good mid-level dungeon?  it<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem very crowded..which would be a NICE change after spending the<br/>
last week in Unrest!<br/>
Also, for those of you wise in the way of Runneyeye...what MOBs drop the<br/>
Blackened Iron armor pieces?  I know the AC isn&#39;t great, and it weighs a<br/>
lot, but it looks very cool and I bet there is a market out there for that<br/>
&#39;look&#39;.<br/>
Thanks in advance for your help!!<br/>
