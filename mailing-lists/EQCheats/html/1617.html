&gt;  I quit a level 29 wizard to start a rogue back in July.  Never missed the<br/>
&gt;  wizard, not nearly as fun as the rogue.  Wizards just nuke and med... Kinda<br/>
&gt;  boring IMO, but, hey, that&#39;s what a wizard is.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry friend, but you are incredibly wrong.  A truly skilled Wizard is much<br/>
&gt; more than Nuke and Med.  I don&#39;t have time to debate you on this, let me just<br/>
&gt; paste below a post from a fellow Wizard from the Wizard Listserv - It is good<br/>
&gt; reading for anyone regardless of class.  The Nuances of playing a Wizard well<br/>
&gt; are beyond many, but they are vast and incredibly fun and challenging.<br/>
