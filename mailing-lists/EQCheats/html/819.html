&gt; What in the hell is the matter with you people?!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Today I got to read about idiot A&#39;s Laptop problems (I don&#39;t give a f&#39;in<br/>
&gt; crap)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then I got to read 9 comments about idiot B&#39;s post about how he is going<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; sue somebody (I don&#39;t give a f&#39;in crap)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; REMEBER EQ?  The game?  Cheats list?  Ring a frickin bell?!!! STOP POSTING<br/>
&gt; BULLCRAP!!!!  IS ANYBODY MONITORING THIS?  KICK THESE IDIOTS OFF!  I DON&#39;T<br/>
&gt; NEED 50 EMAILS ABOUT NOTHING!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok sorry had to get it of my cheast and just to show I am not a talking<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; my arse - here is a bug which if you should want you may exploit (a cheat<br/>
&gt; for those of you unfamiliar with the concept.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At the Entrance to Nanjena you can pull a Rock Dervish.  If you get a good<br/>
&gt; lead and run around the corner almost zoning into nanjena you can still<br/>
cast<br/>
&gt; at the Dervish.  The mob for some reason climbs the side of the zone and<br/>
&gt; never goes into the tunnel to Nanjena.  You can then kill the mob without<br/>
&gt; getting hit yourself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The same thing with cyclops in Mt Rathe.  You can pull them.  Just to the<br/>
&gt; North of the entrance from Lk Rathe is a mountain range.  If you root or<br/>
&gt; snare the cy to slow his movement you can run around the mountain range<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; cast on him from the other side.  The cyclops tries to get to you but<br/>
&gt; instead goes way up into the air and never touches you.  Flying Cy is<br/>
pretty<br/>
&gt; funny too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anybody else found spots like these?  And again the list is about EQ.  If<br/>
&gt; your message doesn&#39;t have GAME INFORMATION OR CHEATS.  SHUT THE F UP!<br/>
