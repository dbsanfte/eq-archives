<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555291107">Well, I am a friend of Dameat, and we took the advice of the spikes on the <br/>
floor being the spawn line and that worked VERY well last night in our quest <br/>
for the BBC. Infact, Any rumors of there being a reset point in the room is <br/>
totally wrong. The key point to getting the BBC is to keep the room clear at <br/>
ALL times. I ran in the room to make sure no spawns were hiding and it never <br/>
effected the spawn. We were there to obtain 2 Bone Bladed Claymores. Within <br/>
4 to 4 and a half hours the SK spawned 3 times. Each time he carried the BBC <br/>
with him. We had to wait for the third becuase the second spawn was stolen <br/>
under our noses. We walked out frustrated and tired, the people there can be <br/>
jerks, but with satisfaction that we obtained through battle the sword of <br/>
power and not through money. Good luck to all who try to camp him.<br/>

&gt; &gt;We went down in hopes of getting a BBC for our Pally last night.  We were<br/>
&gt; &gt;there for two hours or so, and never saw the SK.  We were told that there<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt;a &quot;spawn line&quot;, ie, don&#39;t cross it or the SK will not spawn.  Is this the<br/>
&gt; &gt;case?  If so, is that line at the end of the tunnel?  Or inside the room?<br/>
&gt; &gt;It was fairly frustrating.  Also, there was another group there camping <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt;the Robes, and I never saw that Theor..they...whatever guy that is <br/>
&gt;supposed<br/>
&gt; &gt;to drop the robes.  Does the same thing apply for him?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I spent about 3 days in Befallen and my parties got a total of 5 BBCs, 3<br/>
&gt;Thaum robes and 2 Gossamier robes, countless daggers of Marknek, and not a<br/>
&gt;single blackened wand (the item I was looking for).  There is NO spawn line<br/>
&gt;or any kind of anti camp radius on ANY of the mobs in befallen.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt;standing next to mobs when they spawned with the aforementioned items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Lastly..how often would you say the SK would normally spawn?  Every 1/2<br/>
&gt; &gt;hour?  Hour?  2 hours?  I probably will not return to Befallen, unless it<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt;with my Paladin with the objective of getting that BBC for him....so the<br/>
&gt; &gt;info would be appreciated.  That place is just swarming with DE&#39;s, and it<br/>
&gt; &gt;makes my dwarven skin crawl.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yeah, I hate the place too.  The spawn time in Befallen is about 20<br/>
&gt;minutes, and the SK spawns about 25% of the time.  About 33% of the time<br/>
&gt;that he spawns, he has a BBC.  So I guess if you are looking for a BBC,<br/>
&gt;plan on being there for 3-4 hours or so.  I hate camping, so I&#39;d just run<br/>
&gt;the entire 3rd floor - Thaum room,  Darkelf SK, and Troll SK.  We still<br/>
&gt;ended up at the start of the spawn cycle before the 20 minutes was up.  I<br/>
&gt;hate this dungeon.<br/>
