What are the Race/Class specifications for this mace?  Sounds like a nice item!  The cleansing alone could save my life!<br/>

Do the Shining Star of Light quest (involves getting honeycombs/jumjum juice <br/>
in Rivervale) then going to Qeynos and West Karanas in quick succession.  <br/>
The SSoL is a 1HBlunt magical weapon and goes for anywhere between 40 and 50 <br/>
plat (basically, it&#39;s a 6/28 magic mace with a Cleanse effect - some people <br/>
call it a poor man&#39;s Screaming Mace).  On any given night, I can do this <br/>
quest in 45 minutes with SOW.<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY caveat is getting your faction up with Priests of Life.  Easiest <br/>
way to do this - kill rabid grizzlies and rabid wolves in Qeynos Hills and <br/>
give them to one of the Priestesses in the UFO saucer in the Cleric&#39;s guild <br/>
area of Qeynos (north qeynos, east side). If you do this, be warned - there <br/>
are two NPCs wandering the Qeynos Hills zone.  Cros Treewind and Holly <br/>
Windstalker - they HATE when people kill the bears and wolves and will KOS <br/>
you if the see you and you are within their AGGRO range.  They are level <br/>
30ish and tough to survive, even at level 22. My suggestion is to get <br/>
yourself SOWed and do you rabid animal hunting.  Anyway, when you hand each <br/>
diseased pelt in, you get XPs.  And bear pelts earn you up to 2plat per pelt <br/>
from the PRiestess.<br/>
<br/>
Besides getting your faction up to amiable with the PriestsOfLife, there is <br/>
no killing involved and some decent XPs for each part of the quest.  There <br/>
are several sites which detail the quest.  Here&#39;s one:<br/>

I&#39;ve created and sold six (6!) SSoLs over the last 10 days.  Three I&#39;ve sold <br/>
for 40-ish.. a couple for 50+.. and one I &quot;gave&quot; to a low level cleric who <br/>
needed a break - for 12 plat.  (Yes, I&#39;m a nice guy).<br/>
<br/>
The cost to you for the quest is 30 gold.  And 45 minutes.  It&#39;s a KILLER <br/>
way to make money.  And if you REALLY want to have some fun, go sell the <br/>
mace in Greater Faydark - the High Elves there have access to NO low level <br/>
cleric weapons other than the Screaming Mace.  And to tell you the truth, <br/>
when fighting Ghouls, I&#39;d rather have the SSoL than the Screaming Mace. (the <br/>
SSoL&#39;s Cleanse effect removes GhoulRoot, diseases, poisons, etc during <br/>
combat).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a great low to medium level weapon!!!<br/>
