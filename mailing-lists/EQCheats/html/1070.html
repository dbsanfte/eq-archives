<div id="ygrps-yiv-64390107"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;As i know, there are already alot of cryptic algorithms exists, which<br/>
&gt;make cryptoanalytical method of cracking fairly ineffective. Of &gt;course, <br/>
&gt;most of them illegal to use without approval of agencies like &gt;FBI in USA <br/>
&gt;or FAPSI in my country. Still, if consider server and &gt;client as &quot;closed <br/>
&gt;systems&quot; (unauthorized access is impossible), it is &gt;easy to implement <br/>
&gt;coding what will make cryptoanalytical hack almost &gt;impossible. But, i dont <br/>
&gt;think EQ uses really good crypting for its &gt;protocol. First, it is very <br/>
&gt;restricted in many countries, and EQ is &gt;international product which <br/>
&gt;supposed to be legal in all countries. &gt;Second, good crypting is very <br/>
&gt;time-consuming, and EQ server have &gt;traffic around 1MB/sec. It is <br/>
&gt;impossible to encrypt 1MB per second &gt;with any serious algorithm. I believe <br/>
&gt;it is using something like XOR &gt;with random-seeded bitstrings, or just CRC <br/>
&gt;protection, to make his &gt;traffic safe. It is enough to force most &quot;hackers&quot; <br/>
&gt;to use debugger on &gt;EQ&#39;s exe instead of much easer parsing of network data. <br/>
&gt;And i never &gt;seen games using anything more serious than such forms of <br/>
&gt;protection.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good points. But again, only partially correct. Nothing... and I stress <br/>
NOTHING is absolutely &quot;crack proof&quot; (with one exception that I know of). <br/>
It&#39;s just a matter of time before the encryption algorithms are cracked. <br/>
Better algorithms just ensure that it will take longer to crack. In fact, <br/>
there&#39;s only one algorithm that&#39;s currently absolutely crack proof, and I <br/>
doubt that Verant&#39;s using it to encrypt server to client/client to server <br/>
protocols (it&#39;s military grade and is similar to Netscapes 128 bit <br/>
encryption key, but on a much more advanced level; hence part of the US <br/>
governments reluctance to allow Netscapes encryption technology/algorithms <br/>
out of the country - Netscapes encryption key is very hard to crack, but not <br/>
impossible, and also because they&#39;re afraid that 3rd world countries will <br/>
develope their own keys using this technology).<br/>
<br/>
One of the many things that limits Verants use of a good encrypting <br/>
algorithm on their game, (or any other company, country, government entity <br/>
etc.) is that with highly complex encryption algorithms, the encryption <br/>
process is not quick enough to utilize highspeed transmissions at full <br/>
bandwith - resulting in wasted bandwith, high packet loss, and lag, making <br/>
exploitations (of various forms) easier to use. For the most part, software <br/>
capable of homing in on these weaknesses is limited to government agencies <br/>
(IE - the FBI, CIA, the Pentagon etc.) which limits the average hacker from <br/>
hacking using this type of software.<br/>
<br/>
In short, with extremely few ways to ensure an unbreakable encryption, (only <br/>
one instance that I know of with my background and training) and a limited <br/>
number of ways to make it absolutely hack proof, you&#39;d have to have a stand <br/>
alone only system/server (IE - no LAN, WAN, Intra/Internet access, no modem <br/>
etc.) with a limited access login terminal physically located nearby to keep <br/>
ALL hackers at bay. Otherwise, someone, somewhere, somehow, will hack into <br/>
it and find a way to exploit (heck... even the US Government has hackers <br/>
getting into their &quot;secure&quot; computers and they spend millions trying to <br/>
protect their systems). It&#39;s just a matter of time if you have a hacker <br/>
who&#39;s deligent enough to stay at it.<br/>
<br/>
On a better note however, once a &quot;hack&quot; or &quot;exploit&quot; is discovered by those <br/>
who wish to protect their interests, software etc., they can then find a way <br/>
to block out that hack/exploit, making it a little more secure, bringing <br/>
their protection methods one step closer to being unhackable/unbreakable.</div>
