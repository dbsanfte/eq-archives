I think you COULD make alot<br/>\nof cheats if you could do this, but it would be such a odd setup that 98% of<br/>\nthe people wouldn&#39;t do it, so it wouldn&#39;t cause alot of ruckus... Oh well...<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople! Feel free to keep experimenting!! Maybe someone can find a setup or<br/>\na way to get to that other side.

When I enable both monitors<br/>\nand play EQ, the second monitor is disabled for Alt-Tabs and such.  However,<br/>\nif you move a program like Clock over to the second display, BEFORE you<br/>\nstart EQ, it does stay there during game play.  But programs liek ICQ return<br/>\nto the system tray on the primary display, and you can&#39;t see anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also can&#39;t move your mouse to the second display.  Depending of which<br/>\nway to set your screen to stretch, you can&#39;t move beyond the boundaries of<br/>\nthe game during play.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Francois B.

Do you need a 2nd graphics <br/>\ncard for a 2nd moniter?  I&#39;m guessing you would need one in which case I <br/>\ncan&#39;t do it anyway b/c I have no open slots and my current card is bult into<br/>\n<br/>\nthe motherboard (darn Compaq).<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout that program...what does Alt-Tab do?  wouldn&#39;t it be just about the <br/>\nsame as a program sending the EQ window a command to minimise?  in that case<br/>\n<br/>\nthe result would be the same (logging out, computer locking up mostly, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n  But it might be different.<br/>\n<br/>\nanyone have ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nOmeg<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
