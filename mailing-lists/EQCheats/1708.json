It can be cast upon, and you can gain skill casting<br/>\nupon it, and you can &quot;tap&quot; it for hit points, AC, attack, and whatever else<br/>\nyou like, if you&#39;re of the classes who do that sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it never fights back, and never dies.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy necro is bound in the pot room, so she can teleport everywhere. I raised<br/>\nher Evocation skill (which was horrible) by going there and casting Ward<br/>\nUndead on the skeleton repeatedly, medding in between. When I need to heal,<br/>\nand am near a city where the pots go, I gate back and do a Leach and life<br/>\ntaps on it, as well as one of the hp-mana spells on myself. I leave fully<br/>\nhealthy and charged with mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of raising your casting skills, remember to ALWAYS practice away all<br/>\nyour mana right before a rez. When you&#39;re rezzed, you LOSE all your mana, so<br/>\nmem that one spell you have in the category where your skill is still like<br/>\n10, and cast it until you use up your mana, while waiting for a rez.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nCoffee contains water...so does your pee<br/>\n<br/>\nE-Mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KazVorpal@...\">KazVorpal@...</a><br/>\nAIM/Yahoo/AOL Instant Messenger: KazVorpal<br/>\nICQ#: 1912557</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
