I see alot of other players getting killed down here, and <br/>\nfailing ther Drosco quest (Erudites and others don&#39;t have good enough <br/>\nfaction for it).<br/>\n<br/>\nBloodsabre faction is difficult, as mostly only quests already within <br/>\nthe bloodsabres will raise it. There is a quest called &quot;The Crate&quot; <br/>\nthat will easily raise your faction with the Blood Sabres. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EQCheats@y..., &quot;Kevin Sayer&quot; &lt;ksayer498@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; DID YOU GET THIS EMAIL?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Kevin Sayer&quot; &lt;ksayer498@h...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: EQCheats@y...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: EQCheats@y...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EQCheats] Blood Sabres<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Sat, 25 Aug 2001 18:58:27 -0400<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hiya,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I checked into the faction you are trying to raise. Go to <br/>\neverlore.com and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;type in Busted Prayer Beads on the search. Click search and then <br/>\nclick<br/>\n&gt; &gt;busted prayer beads when you see it come up. Check the message <br/>\nboard. The<br/>\n&gt; &gt;first entry says how he got faction with the Blood Sabres. Thats <br/>\nall i <br/>\n&gt; &gt;could<br/>\n&gt; &gt;find. Wish I could be more of a help. Do you have any secrets, <br/>\ncheats or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;whatever that you could share with me?

Specifically, I would <br/>\nlike<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to know if there is something to do with the &quot;Busted Prayer <br/>\nBeads&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that Brother Estle drops. I suspect I need Whole Beads to do the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;other quest, but I am wondering if I can do something with them <br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;raise Blood Sabre faction.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks in advance for any insight you are able to provide me/us.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;_________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
