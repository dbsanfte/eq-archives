I was on 108, and that was a<br/>\n&gt; really great game.. but you are right, it got ruined.  I think when they<br/>\n&gt; made the spell class changes, it really went downhill from there.  The<br/>\nolder<br/>\n&gt; chars were mage/tanks, and newer players would never be as powerful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seekerslady@...\">seekerslady@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seekerslady@...\">seekerslady@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 28, 1999 6:12 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EQCheats] Level times<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seekerslady@...\">seekerslady@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I used to play meridian 59. I loved this game but people got burned out on<br/>\n&gt; it becuase you could build too fast and then got bored. Then people went<br/>\n&gt; around and PKed each other. It turned a wonderful online community into a<br/>\n&gt; garbage dump. What is your great hurry? You planning on leaving soon? As<br/>\n&gt; long as you are having fun and meeting new people and playing a game you<br/>\n&gt; like what difference does it make what level you are or how fast you get<br/>\n&gt; there. These games are ment to be played for years not weeks. I am<br/>\n&gt; surprised that people have already been able to max out. Now what do they<br/>\n&gt; have to do? Ok they can go anywhere and kill almost anything but how long<br/>\n&gt; before they get bored and move on? The game has only been out a few<br/>\nmonths.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just my 2 cents<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Feather Dreamwalker of Rathe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I agree that level gaining is quite slow. 8-10 hours<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for a level is a bit much. I can&#39;t imagine the high<br/>\n&gt; &gt;30s and above.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Belgarth<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How do you enter ONElist&#39;s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\n&gt; By joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
