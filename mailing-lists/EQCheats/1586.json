The SSoL","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-751287402\">Do the Shining Star of Light quest (involves getting honeycombs/jumjum juice <br/>\nin Rivervale) then going to Qeynos and West Karanas in quick succession.  <br/>\nThe SSoL is a 1HBlunt magical weapon and goes for anywhere between 40 and 50 <br/>\nplat (basically, it&#39;s a 6/28 magic mace with a Cleanse effect - some people <br/>\ncall it a poor man&#39;s Screaming Mace).  On any given night, I can do this <br/>\nquest in 45 minutes with SOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ONLY caveat is getting your faction up with Priests of Life.  Easiest <br/>\nway to do this - kill rabid grizzlies and rabid wolves in Qeynos Hills and <br/>\ngive them to one of the Priestesses in the UFO saucer in the Cleric&#39;s guild <br/>\narea of Qeynos (north qeynos, east side). If you do this, be warned - there <br/>\nare two NPCs wandering the Qeynos Hills zone.  Cros Treewind and Holly <br/>\nWindstalker - they HATE when people kill the bears and wolves and will KOS <br/>\nyou if the see you and you are within their AGGRO range.  They are level <br/>\n30ish and tough to survive, even at level 22. My suggestion is to get <br/>\nyourself SOWed and do you rabid animal hunting.  Anyway, when you hand each <br/>\ndiseased pelt in, you get XPs.  And bear pelts earn you up to 2plat per pelt <br/>\nfrom the PRiestess.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides getting your faction up to amiable with the PriestsOfLife, there is <br/>\nno killing involved and some decent XPs for each part of the quest.  There <br/>\nare several sites which detail the quest.  Here&#39;s one:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gameznet.com/eq/quest/shiningstarlight.html\">http://www.gameznet.com/eq/quest/shiningstarlight.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve created and sold six (6!) SSoLs over the last 10 days.  Three I&#39;ve sold <br/>\nfor 40-ish.. a couple for 50+.. and one I &quot;gave&quot; to a low level cleric who <br/>\nneeded a break - for 12 plat.  (Yes, I&#39;m a nice guy).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cost to you for the quest is 30 gold.  And 45 minutes.  It&#39;s a KILLER <br/>\nway to make money.  And if you REALLY want to have some fun, go sell the <br/>\nmace in Greater Faydark - the High Elves there have access to NO low level <br/>\ncleric weapons other than the Screaming Mace.  And to tell you the truth, <br/>\nwhen fighting Ghouls, I&#39;d rather have the SSoL than the Screaming Mace. (the <br/>\nSSoL&#39;s Cleanse effect removes GhoulRoot, diseases, poisons, etc during <br/>\ncombat).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a great low to medium level weapon!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nDaku - Cleric of the 22nd Circle of Tunare - Quellious server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
