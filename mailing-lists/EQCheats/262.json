Do you loose any items?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you duel in a city arenas like the arenas in Queynos and Freeport and the <br/>\none near Lake Rathe:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) your corpse cannot be looted by your opponent or anyone else if you die<br/>\n2) you do not lose or gain any experience points<br/>\n3)  The embarrasing sever wide message &quot;(insert PC name) has been defeated by <br/>\n(insert PC name) in a duel&quot; does not go out.<br/>\n4) you do not lose any faction (unfortunantly, do to a bug this last point is <br/>\nnot currently true - I think they are fixing the faction loss bug soon - many <br/>\ntournaments have been postponed because of this)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in summary - Dueling in the city arenas is just for fun, and very fun it <br/>\nis.  It&#39;s also hilarious when someone in the crowd who is watching (from <br/>\noutside the arena boundry) tries to get cute by casting a spell on one of the <br/>\ncombatants (like a heal or a root).  You can be guaranteed that in a few <br/>\nseconds a Guard is going to come slay whoever that asshole was.  I&#39;ve seen it <br/>\nhappen a few times and it&#39;s hilarious!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first time dueling in the arena was with my 14th lvl Erudite Wizard.  I <br/>\ndueled a 16th lvl Barb Shaman - he said that the duel would start upon my <br/>\nfirst attack.  Wellllllllllllll, you can guess what my first attack was (er, <br/>\nROOT! of course).  He was was rooted and we traded damage spells for about 5 <br/>\nor 6 rounds and being the damage god that us Wizards are, you can guess the <br/>\nresult (I hit for 79 at the time).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, have fun dueling in the arenas, its adds a whole new lvl of fun to <br/>\nthe game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizaro<br/>\nErudite Wizard currently residing in High Hold Keep<br/>\nPlane of Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
