This is what allowed people to hack Diablo, but not UO (as<br/>\nfar as character stats). Might work for some other things though, like<br/>\ngetting into closed zones or something, who knows.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a little surprised no one has hacked the graphics files and come out<br/>\nwith a way to modify the files PC side to take away some affects, such as<br/>\nnight, blindness, spell effects, rain, etc. I remember when I played UO,<br/>\nsomeone hacked the graphics and I ran this program that took away all walls<br/>\nand roofs of all structures, so you could see inside (wall was still there,<br/>\nyou could only SEE inside). Quite funny though walking around seeing<br/>\neveryone&#39;s thousands of reagants they had gotten from duping... *sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Michael Ott [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mott@...\">mott@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 23, 1999 4:03 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQCheats] possible big cheat for EQ....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Michael Ott &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mott@...\">mott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFairly easily and seemingly possible idea for this why not try<br/>\nnetworking....logging on but before actually playing the game while on news<br/>\nscreen try replacing the files. That way you crack the file replace the<br/>\nactual file right before logging on and wen their servers go to pull the<br/>\ninfo bingo they pull the cracked file. Real quick real easy and you have a<br/>\nsuper pumped character. Just use another computer to place the file. There<br/>\nmay be the possibility of &quot;file in use&quot; error messages but highly unlikely<br/>\nas you wouldn&#39;t be logged on as of that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust an idea<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist members, don&#39;t miss out on the latest news at ONElist!<br/>\nJoin our community member news update  <br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce</a> &quot;here&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
