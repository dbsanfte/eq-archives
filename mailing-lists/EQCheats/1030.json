The result of the<br/>\nquest is the Shinging Star of Light (a mace 6 28 that cast clense).  You<br/>\nmust have high faction with the Priest of Life to do this quest, which is a<br/>\npain cause there is only a few things you can do to raise the faction.  The<br/>\nmace itself is worth around 20 pp or so and involves some running around<br/>\nbetween WK and Qeynos.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Honeycombs are found off of Bixies and Bixie Drones.  These<br/>\n&gt; little guys are<br/>\n&gt; prolly like lvl 2 -4 ...certainly none that I can remember higher than<br/>\n&gt; 5....I was collecting them last week and selling them for one plat<br/>\n&gt; each...made a bundle of $$ that way (wee at least for a lvl 8 character :)<br/>\n&gt; they are used for making Honeyjum....and , I think for another quest...but<br/>\n&gt; after selling a bunch of the honeycomb I began wondering why it was so<br/>\n&gt; valuable...and I STILL don&#39;t understand why people are paying such an<br/>\n&gt; outrageous amount of $$ for it!!<br/>\n&gt; Anybody know the answer to this puzzle&gt;&gt;????<br/>\n&gt; Sean </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
