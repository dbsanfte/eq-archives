All I have<br/>\never gotten from it was an &quot;In-game name&quot; for items. Like the<br/>\nBlackened Wand or whatever. If you cast Ident on it, you get a name of<br/>\n&quot;Wand of So-and-So&quot; I think it&#39;s mostly as hints to quest items. You<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t know that the blackened wand was related to a quest if the<br/>\nNPCs are all talking about some guy&#39;s wand, but the blackened was the<br/>\nactuall quest item. (Unless, the info was posted somewhere.) :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe info I have recieved from identify has hardly been the trouble to<br/>\nmem and cast the spell. (IMO at least) The only thing more useless<br/>\nthan Ident is Sense magic. Every stupid thing that I would sense magic<br/>\non already had (MAGIC ITEM) in the description.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Whitcraft,David&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Whitcraft,David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DWHITCRAFT@...\">DWHITCRAFT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *chuckle* Yea, and Alchemy will be implimented and Shaman&#39;s will get that<br/>\n&gt; new spell we were promised replacing Charm.... *chuckle* Please, I would<br/>\n&gt; love to get happy about them fixing and finishing stuff....just hasn&#39;t been<br/>\n&gt; a good track record for shaman promises though...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is Identify an Enchanter spell?
