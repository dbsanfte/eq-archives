I was just wondering how exactly you do <br/>\nthat.  What files to open with what, which lines of code to replace, etc.  <br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nHi there.. there is a program called &quot;Eze&quot; that you can use to hex edit the <br/>\ngame without having to wory about the actual hex. it&#39;s all done though the <br/>\ninterface. you may have to edit the config and things, and the drawbacks are <br/>\nsome zones aren&#39;t accessable, because the tutorial starts at 0,0 and that&#39;s <br/>\nnot in some zones, and that you are ahuman that can only walk, but the <br/>\nadvantages are you can explor kedge and not worry about drowning, and you <br/>\ncan explore MM without pulling the entire zone. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nGikkwiny, 20th warrior on Quellious<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
