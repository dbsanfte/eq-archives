That&#39;s understandable.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelping the guards in their fight should NOT be illegal. If your fighting my<br/>\nbrethren, I&#39;m gonna do what I can to see that you all DIE (which is SQUAT<br/>\nsince I can&#39;t do crap to a NPC sides kill them). If I could, I&#39;d SoW all the<br/>\nBarbarian guards, buff them with a Talisman of Tanarg, heal them, quickness<br/>\nthem, etc etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, as far as I know, Barbarian guards are mostly left alone, and I&#39;m never<br/>\nthere anyways... Qeynos guards can bite my ass, as well as all the other<br/>\nraces guards. Kill them if you want ;-) I was kill Troll guards last night!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, if I blocked the zone on purpose to &#39;assit&#39; the guards, I&#39;d expect to<br/>\nbe banned....

I am <br/>\na dark elf myself, and had a few friends of the &#39;good&#39;aligned races come <br/>\ninto Neriak&#39;s foreign quarters killing the guards. A few dark elves and <br/>\ntrolls decided to start training NPCs on them, and the trolls BLOCKED the <br/>\nzone.
