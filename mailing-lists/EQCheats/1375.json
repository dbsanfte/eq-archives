I would imagine by<br/>\nthat they are about level 23 or so, low blue to me.<br/>\n(these don&#39;t have much for loot though). I think the<br/>\nShamans were about 30 (wasn&#39;t paying much attention,<br/>\nfriend killed these) and Chief Goonda about 34th<br/>\nlevel. The Chief hits quite hard. I got jumped by him<br/>\nand he did over 80 points per swing, two swings a<br/>\nround. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I was with a level 50 Wizard friend at the time, so<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how hard they are in an average group. <br/>\n<br/>\nBelgarth<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
