You should be<br/>\nable to level every couple of hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you have cure disease, in which case you can go hunt Fiends.<br/>\nOtherwise you should join a Bandit group, but be careful because you&#39;re<br/>\nslightly low for that and can&#39;t take/deal the hits like a Troll shaman. The<br/>\nFiends don&#39;t drop decent loot, but the Bandits drop armor you can sell for<br/>\nmultiple platinum at the Bazaar. You can also get free Uber buffs if you hang<br/>\naround the Nexus either asking Ubers or waiting for someone to offer them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you&#39;ve figured out how to root and DoT your victims. That&#39;s the big<br/>\nShaman soloing technique. Root, Slow, DoT, then maybe DD if you have enough<br/>\nmana. Be ready to re-root. If you get KEI in the Nexus, you can even root and<br/>\nDirect Damage them to death, easily. At your level you can&#39;t cast fast enough<br/>\nto use up your mana if you have KEI on. With my Troll shaman I also melee<br/>\nthem a bit each time (I solo yellows) just to keep my melee skills up, but<br/>\ntrolls are stronger and have regeneration built in. I can melee stuff my own<br/>\nlevel without even casting on them, have always been able to.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nThere are things in the Constitution that have been overtaken by events, by time...Inappropriate, anachronistic, it isn&#39;t done anymore...<br/>\n -- Chairman Henry Hyde, who doesn&#39;t believe the Constitution needs to be followed or legally changed, just ignored.<br/>\n<br/>\nAIM/Yahoo/AOL Instant Messenger: KazVorpal    <br/>\nICQ#: 1912557</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
