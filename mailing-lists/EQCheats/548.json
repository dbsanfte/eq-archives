As I said earlier in my report on the changes, this<br/>\nchange has also been made to many other sketches in pottery, and the profit for those are not<br/>\nacceptable either. Your right, we should have the abilitie to choose what we want to do in EQ.<br/>\nWarrior, healer, venturer, greedy merchant it&#39;s all our choice, why you ask, because we are paying<br/>\nfor it. And in previous statements made by Sony, indicated that these were possible, that we as<br/>\nmembers of society have the abilities to choose what we want to do. Now witht he vamping of most<br/>\nskills *regardless if it&#39;s to balance them out*, is leaning us more into the Fight kill be a<br/>\nwarrior type character, or such. Either case, someone couldn&#39;t take up some skills and just become<br/>\nmasters at them now because of the changes, their pointless in making anything especially Pottery,<br/>\nwhat can you do with a empty Pie Tin, make a pie from bakery ? Bakery it&#39;self was changed and is<br/>\nnow to much to increase the skill in and the profit is again nill and void.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere&#39;s EQ going with all this I ask, when are we going to say something about the changes ? Well,<br/>\nI already have said my piece to them. you don&#39;t need to flame them or rant about the changes, but<br/>\nimply your own feelings towards what you think is going on, and always remember the fact that you<br/>\nare paying for this game to play it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThulgar<br/>\nGrand Master of the Mystical Knights<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.efni.com/~thulgar\">http://www.efni.com/~thulgar</a><br/>\n<br/>\nKenneth Toomey wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Kenneth Toomey &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kennydt@...\">kennydt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So what the hell is pottery going to be good for now??<br/>\n&gt; -Kenny<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (Buglart, Troll Shaman)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.
