I&#39;ve<br/>\nonly seen VtU once, he was blue to me and I was definately 35 at the time.<br/>\nI know cause I had just trained disarm (which rangers don&#39;t get till 35) and<br/>\nI was practicing it on skeletons outside Surefall.  I had all my int gear on<br/>\ninstead of normal combat gear and all my buffs had worn off, since I really<br/>\ndidn&#39;t need them against the skels.  When I went to check out Varsoon the<br/>\nUndying, he spanked my ass good, let me tell ya.  I&#39;m guessing you saw plain<br/>\nold Varsoon who was yellow to you at 20.  I&#39;ve never seen him in his normal<br/>\nform.<br/>\n<br/>\nTelon on E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tJared Hughes[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaredh@...\">jaredh@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tThursday, September 09, 1999 4:59 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRE: [EQCheats] Re: Pzygin and Varsoon<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jared Hughes&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaredh@...\">jaredh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At level 19 Varsoon the Undying was Yellow to me- so he is 20 or 20, but<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; went<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- this would make him lvl 20-21... when was the last time you saw<br/>\n&gt; something<br/>\n&gt; that double hit for --70 damage that was lvl 20-21? and yes i know this<br/>\n&gt; because he hit me for that much when i  was --lvl 31.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; on to take out me (ranger), a level 23 warrior with the Executioners Axe,<br/>\n&gt; and a<br/>\n&gt; level 23 Druid.
