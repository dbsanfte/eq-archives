I have heard that the<br/>\ntunic is about 1 out of 10 kills.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe level ranges sound about right, if you have a<br/>\ncleric or two you can get by with a little lower. If I<br/>\nrecall, he does use harm touch for about 300 hits, so<br/>\nbe prepared for that. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess is that the Polished bone hoops are from<br/>\nChief Goonda the Ogre Shaman in W.
