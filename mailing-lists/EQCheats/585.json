That alone will save you a<br/>\n&gt; lot<br/>\n&gt; of money, not a lot of time, but a lot of money. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Would someone please tell me where to find ore besides buying it?  I&#39;m a<br/>\n&gt; 17th level ranger so finding it on a rare 30th level spawn in the bottom<br/>\n&gt; of some dungeon is pretty useless.
