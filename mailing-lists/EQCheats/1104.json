Win 98 supports dual<br/>\n&gt;monitors, I&#39;ve seen it done back in Beta when we were testing it.... I also<br/>\n&gt;work coding programs for DINPACS systems, which often use 2 or more HIGH<br/>\n&gt;(2400x2000) res monitors... Now, given the way EQ works, I DOUBT that EQ<br/>\n&gt;would come up on one screen and the other would be the rest of the desktop,<br/>\n&gt;but it MIGHT be possible to get to work, I&#39;m not sure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyone tried this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, I wonder if you could write a program that would send a windows<br/>\n&gt;message to EQ that would minimize or &#39;restore&#39; (take to a smaller window)<br/>\n&gt;EQ. Now, THAT might be worth investigating... Anyone tried this? I could<br/>\n&gt;probably figure out a way to find the handle for the EQ window and have a<br/>\n&gt;program runing in the background automatically send it a restore message<br/>\n&gt;after EQ loads... Wouldn&#39;t that be cool....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Leod<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Omeg Felligan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:omeg_felligan@...\">omeg_felligan@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Thursday, August 19, 1999 8:04 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQCheats] possible big cheat for EQ....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Omeg Felligan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:omeg_felligan@...\">omeg_felligan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think one thing that ppl are ignoreing is that EQ logs you off if you<br/>\n&gt;alt-tab out, and that your computer all but freezes up...but whatever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;also there doesn&#39;t seem to be any way to float anything above EQ while in<br/>\n&gt;game (I&#39;ve tried ICQ&#39;s floating thingy, didn&#39;t work).  so you&#39;d have to<br/>\n&gt;write a hack to over come this and I&#39;m guessing that would be entirely<br/>\n&gt;client side...either that or have 2 monitors ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;so even if cheat programs were developed (yeah right) than how would you<br/>\n&gt;even get to them?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Omeg<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Start a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\n&gt;For details on ONElist&#39;s NEW FRIENDS & FAMILY program, go to<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\n&gt;goto www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist members, don&#39;t miss out on the latest news at ONElist!<br/>\n&gt;Join our community member news update<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce</a> &quot;here&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net <br/>\n&gt;goto www.everquest.com </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
