I mean, all spell and<br/>\nhotkey functions were gone, as if fear effect continued forever.<br/>\nWe were forced to camp to clear effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could have taken Nag easily if not for this.  Losing 2 out of 3<br/>\nclerics<br/>\ndoes sort of affect the outcome of battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not a bitch nor am I inviting complaints<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to know if anyone else has encountered this.  We had a nice long<br/>\ntalk<br/>\nwith our Servers head GM and she wants to know as well so they can fix<br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance<br/>\n<br/>\nJoatmos<br/>\nXegony.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you like to have a voice in the marketplace and be<br/>\nrewarded for it?
