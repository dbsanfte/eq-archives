Heck, you can carry 3-4 of them if you have good Strength!!  That<br/>\nwill save LOTS of money... yeah, right...  I would rather leave them behind<br/>\nand carry a FS or Bronze sword that weighs less and is worth MUCH more...<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think that if Verant keeps making skills LESS profitable (or no<br/>\nbreakeven), then they will be encouraging players to quit doing skills all<br/>\ntogether, which means that even MORE players will be out in the &#39;battle&#39;<br/>\nzones...<br/>\n<br/>\nI would think they would want to ENCOURAGE people to learn skills rather<br/>\nthan the opposite... I think their reasoning (which is probably money<br/>\nrelated) is kind of ontrack in that they don&#39;t want a level 5 player selling<br/>\nBanded all the time and being able to buy &#39;high end&#39; weapons and armor which<br/>\nwould normally be out of reach of his level...<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant should ENCOURAGE people to practice their skills... Give them a<br/>\nFaction adjustment with the NPC&#39;s or something... Give them some EXPERIENCE<br/>\nwhen they go from one level to another (or every 10 levels)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same thing goes with languages... Why would MOST of us want (or need) to<br/>\nlearn different languages (like Dragon)??  Are we going to talk to dragons<br/>\nwith it??  No... But it would be a nice gesture if after learning a new<br/>\nlanguage (to expert level) that we got a little experience for it...<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all, what IS experience?  If we only get it from battle (or some<br/>\nquests), maybe they shouldn&#39;t call it experience... Maybe they need to call<br/>\nit Battle Points instead...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sure seems strange to me that we would NOT get any experience gain for<br/>\nthings like Practicing a Trade and/or Learning a language...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just a shame that the ONLY way you can gain experience is by killing<br/>\nthings (even in most quests you must kill something)...<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian - High Elf Cleric on Karana server<br/>\nProud member of Platinum Sphere Guild - www.platinumsphere.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Rebecca &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:indrika@...\">indrika@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 26, 2005 11:34 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQCheats] Re: Smithing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Rebecca&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:indrika@...\">indrika@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; profits are still to be had in some respects in certain skills - you just<br/>\n&gt; have to be willing to do a little work ... like getting your own ores and<br/>\n&gt; clays, and not buying them from the store.  That alone will save you a lot<br/>\n&gt; of money, not a lot of time, but a lot of money. :)<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Scott Calkins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stretch1@...\">stretch1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 26, 1999 10:28 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQCheats] Re: Smithing<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Scott Calkins&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stretch1@...\">stretch1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Someone was asking about smithing skill.  If you plan to get into<br/>\n&gt; smithing,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you will probibly spend around 300-400+ plat to get up to around the 100<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lev.  I have not seen any item that can be sold back to npc&#39;s for a<br/>\n&gt; profit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But when you get up to the lev where you can make banded armor, it is a<br/>\n&gt; item<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that other players will buy at a good profit.  Now if they could add in<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; making of weapons I would be realy happy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Stretch<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\n&gt; goto www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist now has T-SHIRTS!<br/>\n&gt; For details and to order, go to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html\">http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
