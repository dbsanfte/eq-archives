At high levels there mana draining spells are a HUGE advantage. (Send pet in- Use stun spell on enemy- Mana Seive enemy- then blast...) I almost think a enchanter could wipe a necro out with this tactic if the stun allowed him time enough to mana drain.. of course enchanters pet would keep the necro pet occupied... it could all be done in a matter of seconds, by the time the necro was unstunned, a lot of his mana would be gone.. Now im not saying its hands down vs a necro, things would have to go right... but if it worked then the enchanter would have a advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nWes Lobdell,<br/>\nQuote: +ACI-The certain proof that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe <br/>\nis that no one has bothered to make contact with us.+ACI-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: kurt walther itzkurt+AEA-wans.net<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan wrote:<br/>\n+AD4APg- <br/>\n+AD4APg- From: +ACI-Jonathan+ACI- jp1234+AEA-prodigy.net<br/>\n+AD4APg- <br/>\n+AD4APg- Actually the 2 best classes for PVP are Cleric and Enchanter at high levels.<br/>\n+AD4APg- In terms of melee, yes monks by leaps and bounds<br/>\n<br/>\nUhm..

You odn&#39;t believe me..  go dual<br/>\none.  You&#39;ll get your ass handed to you.  I too thought clerics were<br/>\nbadass pvpers and whatnot.  Nope..  I got beat by a necro 3 lvls below<br/>\nme. Clerics are good..  but enchanters and necros have us beat at higher<br/>\nlvls.. hands down.  Necros dots will kill you with a quickness.  I had 5<br/>\nstacked on me and it took about 30 secs for my life to go from full to<br/>\nnada.  Not a pretty sight.  Necros are the shit in pvp.  So are<br/>\nenchanters.  Go dual one.  It&#39;s fun.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
