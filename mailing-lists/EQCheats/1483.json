People dupe it, people argue over it, <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s way too general purpose. And, it&#39;s all being REPLACED with armor<br/>\n&gt;anyways, prolly better stuff than it is now. Rubi AC with stat <br/>\n&gt;bonuses...yee<br/>\n&gt;haw. And, it being a quest, it&#39;ll prolly be easier to get than camping for<br/>\n&gt;30 hours for a rubi bp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please excuse the typos in my previous posting - what happened is that too <br/>\nmany people farmed rubi and that KStealing ran rampant in that area, so they<br/>\n<br/>\ndecided to remove it from being dropped as loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have liked to have gotten a rubi BP for the regen properties. Not to<br/>\n<br/>\nmention that the red hue looks outstanding on a DESK! 8) Getting rubi armor <br/>\nwas one the few last things I had to look forward to for my DESK, (seeing as<br/>\n<br/>\nhow they continuously nerf everything else worthwhile for SK&#39;s). I just wish<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant would think these things out before they go nerfing them the way they<br/>\n<br/>\nalways do, and then they end up spending the next 2 months or so trying to <br/>\nundo what they did to correct the original problem. It would have been much <br/>\nbetter/easier to make rubi no drop/trade lore, or even make it a quest <br/>\nreward (something like crafted, but not quite so easily obtained).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I hear, they&#39;re replacing rubi with class specific armor, which is<br/>\n<br/>\nall fine and dandy, but will any of it have the same regen properties as the<br/>\n<br/>\nrubi BP? Anyone on the test server know?<br/>\n<br/>\nGet paid to surf the web!
