Things such as the preacher not<br/>\nhaving anything but money on him. Also I used to get chain and the odd<br/>\npiece of bronze from gobbies now I rarely get anything besides some cash.<br/>\nThe arch and preacher do not spawn as often either. Also the preacher seems<br/>\nto spawn on a regular basis with a FS warhammer now and nothing else on<br/>\nhim.
