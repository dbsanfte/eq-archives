He has a nasty DD spell that he likes to cast a lot, as well as a <br/>\ncouple of DoT&#39;s and a pet.  He hits for about 40, and drops jack.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is &quot;Varsoon the Undying&quot;, a zombie, that spawns when you kill <br/>\nhim.  Varsoon the Undying was level 30 (even con) when I killed Varsoon, and <br/>\nhe hits for 70 - 80, double.  I don&#39;t think he is a spell caster, so I guess <br/>\nyou could kite him it you are careful.  Just watch that you don&#39;t kite him <br/>\ninto the guards, some of whom will make short work of him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard to solo him, because you will probably be low mana and health <br/>\nfrom killing Varsoon and getting hit with his DoT&#39;s.  I suggest a group <br/>\napproach for this reason, or an agreement to the effect of, &quot;I&#39;ll kill <br/>\nvarsoon, you get his zombie&quot;, so you are full health and mana when you take <br/>\nhim on.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Ma`ar, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;What lvls are Varsoon and Pyzgin?
