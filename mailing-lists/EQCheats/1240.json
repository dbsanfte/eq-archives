King Tranix is<br/>\nthe head gnoll in BB, isn&#39;t he? I have heard him once before last night,<br/>\nhollering back when I played a young warrior. I was on my way through BB<br/>\nlast night with my shaman when I heard Tranix hollering, I stopped, and he<br/>\nhit me frm behind. Quick fight, but he didn&#39;t have anything but a bronze<br/>\nmace (was green to this 28th shaman). Any clues? Suppose it could have<br/>\nsomething to do with the named gnolls out in EK?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
