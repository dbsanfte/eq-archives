But I have to put my 2 coppers worth in<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour Lawyer obviously doesn&#39;t know squat about electronic mail, laws against<br/>\nspaming or anything else to do with the internet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order for any contract to be &quot;Binding&quot;  it must be signed or witnessed.<br/>\nIf there was a way to send a registered E-mail, that showed the letter had<br/>\nbeen read by the correct recipient then yes Nick you could file a harassment<br/>\nsuit.  As it is your suit or claim to suit is little more than pathetic<br/>\nattempt to bully a person on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly,  all forms of suit are not punishable by monetary gain.  You are<br/>\ntalking a form of harassment.  If anything a restraining order could be<br/>\nleveled on Mr. Clark but in no way shape or form will there be monetary<br/>\ncompensation.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive us all a break and stop with this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***** If I receive any personal replies to this E-mail I will charge the<br/>\nsaid sender a $500 fee for proof reading.*****<br/>\n<br/>\n*****I hold the copywrite to the above message.  If said message is replied<br/>\ntoo with any or all of the content without written permission from me a<br/>\nroyalty fee will be charged of $5 per word.*****<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAruyall<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here is how my lawyer put it to me.  If someone sends you unsolicited<br/>\nemail<br/>\n&gt; once it is fine, but if you warn them after that email saying the<br/>\nfollowing<br/>\n&gt; or close to it &quot;any further emails to this address will cost a certain<br/>\n&gt; amount of money to proofread&quot; it is legally binding.  If the person does<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; make a payment within 3 months you can take them to small claims court and<br/>\n&gt; charge interest on your time and work.  When you warn them, and they send<br/>\n&gt; you another email just correct it and send it back to them.  Afterwards<br/>\n&gt; start litigation.  This is an excellent way to stop hate/spam/annoying<br/>\n&gt; emails.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
