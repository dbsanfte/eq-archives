Alot of us<br/>\n&gt;are used to UO where cheats where common, you rarely got found out, and the<br/>\n&gt;GMs were so overworked they didn&#39;t give a shit when you used em. It&#39;s NOT<br/>\n&gt;the same thing here, from what I can tell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And, the trapping thing can and will get you banned. People will petition<br/>\n&gt;your ass and a GM WILL come (I petitioned one guy that pissed me off - AND<br/>\n&gt;was trapping - and a GM was there inside of 20 minutes).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;AND, I see your point. I for one will not be responding to emails saying<br/>\n&gt;stupid shit like &quot;Hey you stupid shit, that&#39;s a cheat! That&#39;ll get you<br/>\n&gt;banned!&quot; HA! This is a little insane!
