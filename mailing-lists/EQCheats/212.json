It takes 3 FULL groups to kill a dragon.  When a mob has<br/>\nover 16k hit points, you&#39;re not gonna solo it by any means.  They made<br/>\nit so the power weapons in this game were very hard to get.  You have to<br/>\nEARN them.  And yes..  the fiery avenger is a paladin only sword.  It&#39;s<br/>\na fact.. deal with it.  And no one has it on any server.  It pays to<br/>\nhave friends in high places.  Get the inside scoop on many issues.. <br/>\nOnly thing that sucks is that ya have to deal with being jealous of<br/>\nevery one of them.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
