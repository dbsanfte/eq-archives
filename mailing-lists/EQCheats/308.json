He spawns by the bridge in rivervale sometimes on one side of it<br/>\nsometimes more toward the entrance to misty thicket. He spawns about every<br/>\n10 minutes, real time,. I killed him a few times and looted plat, brownie<br/>\nparts, gems, arrows, and best of all jumjum stalk. I gathered up 4 jumjum<br/>\nstalk and took it to Reebo Leafsway at the druids guild by the farmers field<br/>\nand gave them all at once to him. He gave me some plat and the runners ring.<br/>\nI tried to give him 3 and he gave me a bunch of carrots. I gave my ring to<br/>\nanother character of mine and gave him 4 stalk and he gave me a bunch of<br/>\ncarrots once and a compass another time. So I am not sure if this a random<br/>\ndrop or actually something to count on. It has been told to me that if you<br/>\nlet Nillipuss run around before you attack him that is when he picks up the<br/>\nstalk, supposedly swipes them from the field, but i have killed him right<br/>\nafter he spawned and he had one on him then also. Well its something to try<br/>\nanyway. Good luck.<br/>\nAudrey Angelfire 23Ranger on the Veeshan Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
