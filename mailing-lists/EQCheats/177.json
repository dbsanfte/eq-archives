It&#39;s been paladin only since beta where it was a two-handed weapon but has been supposedly changed to 1-handed for the release.  In beta, its stats were something along the lines of 35 atk/50 delay or something of the like.

Also it is not a Paladin only weapon unless they changed it recently. There is no way they would allow only 1 person on each server to have one because that would severely piss off the people who don&#39;t play every day. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
