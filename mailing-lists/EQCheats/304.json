I have a question or two about the basement of Befallen...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We went down in hopes of getting a BBC for our Pally last night.  We<br/>\n&gt; were<br/>\n&gt; there for two hours or so, and never saw the SK.  We were told that<br/>\n&gt; there is<br/>\n&gt; a &quot;spawn line&quot;, ie, don&#39;t cross it or the SK will not spawn.  Is this<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; case?  If so, is that line at the end of the tunnel?  Or inside the<br/>\n&gt; room?<br/>\n&gt; It was fairly frustrating.  Also, there was another group there<br/>\n&gt; camping for<br/>\n&gt; the Robes, and I never saw that Theor..they...whatever guy that is<br/>\n&gt; supposed<br/>\n&gt; to drop the robes.  Does the same thing apply for him?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lastly..how often would you say the SK would normally spawn?  Every<br/>\n&gt; 1/2<br/>\n&gt; hour?  Hour?  2 hours?  I probably will not return to Befallen, unless<br/>\n&gt; it is<br/>\n&gt; with my Paladin with the objective of getting that BBC for him....so<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; info would be appreciated.  That place is just swarming with DE&#39;s, and<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; makes my dwarven skin crawl.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dameat<br/>\n&gt; 14th Level Dwarven Cleric (AND Master Brewer)<br/>\n&gt; Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Find people who care about what you care about.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; At ONElist:  your connection to community.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the<br/>\n&gt; net goto www.everquest.com </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
