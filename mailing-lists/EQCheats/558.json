At the &#39;back left&#39; tip (Depending on if the <br/>\nflip occured that&#39;s either south west or north east) of the island is a <br/>\ncampfire and the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Halfling Rogue (Captain something) Has the Bracers<br/>\n2) Dark Elf Warrior?<br/>\n3) Gnome magican<br/>\n4) *-Elf Warrior?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are semi-linked but I&#39;ve managed to kill them all without triggering the<br/>\nElf.  Kill the Magician first as he&#39;s a spellcaster.  Two Mid twenties cleared<br/>\nthe island and kept it clear for 4-5 spawns.  The bracers are lore, +5 strength<br/>\nAlso you can get an earring hat can be returned to the sisters as a quest.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nKanis Wyrmslayer<br/>\nAce of Spades - Dealers of Death<br/>\n31th Season Ranger<br/>\nSoluesk Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
