They seem to have the<br/>\nhotbutton layouts on them. It could save you a little effort in re-mapping the<br/>\nbuttons if you copy them to the laptop. At least the one for the character you are<br/>\nplaying. (eg. if the char you are playing is named Smitty then copy the smitty.opt<br/>\nfile to the laptop&#39;s EQ directory. When I found this out, I was tickled. Now I try to<br/>\ncreate the same class/name on any server I log into. (E Marr goes down a lot and it&#39;s<br/>\nnice having a backup game on another server.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MFerrulo@...\">MFerrulo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MFerrulo@...\">MFerrulo@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am going on the road for 2 weeks and may get a laptop so I can play while<br/>\n&gt; travelling.
