It&#39;s<br/>\nfun for a bit, but it&#39;s REALLY decreases the amount of time I&#39;ll play the<br/>\ngame.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would LOVE to be able to check ICQ, browse the web, and check my email<br/>\nwhile I&#39;m playing though.

If you played it straight on Diablo and had a good time, why would<br/>\nyou want people to write a cheat program to exploit EverQuest. That just<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make any sense to me. UNLESS you are the kind of person that needs<br/>\nto cheat to have fun. If you&#39;re not, I apologize, but then I just don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand why you would sent that email.<br/>\n<br/>\nMacabre<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Omeg Felligan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:omeg_felligan@...\">omeg_felligan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 18, 1999 9:08 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQCheats] possible big cheat for EQ....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Omeg Felligan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:omeg_felligan@...\">omeg_felligan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I did not say that I had to cheat to have fun with EQ.  I have lots of fun<br/>\n&gt; and haven&#39;t taken advantage of any of the &quot;cheats&quot; that this list has<br/>\n&gt; provided.  I use the guest info, but I don&#39;t trap monsters or anything.<br/>\n&gt; From Diablo I was one of the ppl that made it to level 50 with no cheats,<br/>\n&gt; and only items that I found so I knew they were legit.  I also had a<br/>\n&gt; hacked-to-heck character on Diablo b/c sometimes I think it&#39;s fun to run<br/>\n&gt; around and kill anything ya darn well please.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; if I had to cheat to have fun I wouldn&#39;t play EQ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Omeg<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; please note lack of flames.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;It&#39;s players like you that make me sick. Why the hell bother playing this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;game, if you need to cheat at it to have fun.
