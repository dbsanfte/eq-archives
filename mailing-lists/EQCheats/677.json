I noticed that one of the merchants in Qeynos will pay more for loot than any other.  I can buy water from any merchant (regards me kindly) and sell it to this merchant(regards me indiferent) and almost break even.  I haven&#39;t figured out exactly how much more he pays, but it is more than &quot;normal&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, its the guy near the docks inside the animal pen.
