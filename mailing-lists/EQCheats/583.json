Look at smithing at one<br/>\ntime yes you could make money now you can get a full suit at cost. Almost<br/>\nthe same with fletching, Brewing and baking are almost a total waste since<br/>\nyou can buy cheaper from vendors, Tinkering doesn&#39;t even really work most of<br/>\nits items are not cost effective or just don&#39;t work.  Jeweler making is the<br/>\nONLY skill so far that might work and that is only from the high end items<br/>\nwhich take so much money to make only high level people can afford.  This<br/>\nIMHO is a big strike against EQ and have been saying it since the early<br/>\nbeta.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nXakthan<br/>\nLord of Shadows<br/>\nFollower of the Crimson Knights<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;--- Enigma ---&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.door.net/enigma\">http://members.door.net/enigma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: \tAaron Braunstein [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_spam@...\">aaron_spam@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tMonday, July 26, 1999 9:17 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQCheats@onelist.com\">EQCheats@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [EQCheats] Pottery<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Aaron Braunstein &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_spam@...\">aaron_spam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have read NO other true statements from them about profit or not<br/>\n&gt;profit.

The way they<br/>\nwant it to work is to offer players a &#39;sweet spot&#39; between what they<br/>\npaid for materials and what NPC vendors charge for an equivilant item<br/>\nto what a player can make themselves through their tradecraft.  This<br/>\nway, a player is encouraged to sell their wares at a profit to other<br/>\nplayers and not at a loss to vendors.<br/>\n\tIn this way, they want to stimulate the &quot;player run economy&quot;<br/>\nand not a &quot;kick back and make a bunch of plat just interacting with<br/>\nvendors&quot;-type approach.  I&#39;m not saying I agree with it, I&#39;m just<br/>\npassing on what I know to be true... not player speculation or rumor,<br/>\nbut actual statements from The Man. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the net<br/>\ngoto www.everquest.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
