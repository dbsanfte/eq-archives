Does anyone have any tips for me on where<br/>\n&gt;it is best to get HQ bear pelts? I have killed countless bears for a very<br/>\n&gt;long time and have only gotten my hands on 4 HQ bear pelts to work with.<br/>\n&gt;And two of those I got lucky and found and bought from a store.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve gotten about 9 HQ bear pelts in my career (as loot, not bought).  ALL<br/>\nexcept 2 of them i got from the little blackbears and young Kodiaks that<br/>\nroam the  Misty Thicket.<br/>\nOne other i got from a black bear in West Commons and the other I got from a<br/>\ngrizzly bear (i think it was a grizzly...coulda been a smaller one) in West<br/>\nkarana.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs i haven&#39;t exactly spent a HUGE amount of times going after bear pelts (I<br/>\nmostly have tailored small sizes for newbies..i find the wee folk irrestibly<br/>\ncute), i would think someone with the sole intent of getting HQ bear should<br/>\nbe able to do quite well going after them in Misty Thicket.  Figure about 1<br/>\nor 2 per game day in Misty thicket if you go after all the little bears that<br/>\nspawn there.   There&#39;s a time frame on Bear Spawns in Misty, so you will<br/>\nhave a good deal of downtime waiting for a game day to pass and a new spawn<br/>\ncome, but you are guaranteed to get the HQ pelts (unless I and a friend of<br/>\nmine are just terribly luck).<br/>\n<br/>\nBjornne Spiritwolf<br/>\nBarbarian Shaman, Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
