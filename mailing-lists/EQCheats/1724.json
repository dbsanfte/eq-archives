Most of<br/>\nthe &quot;balancing&quot; falls on the stupid side, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut some, like the nerfing of Uber buffs on lowbies, is because almost<br/>\neveryone at SOE plays PvP. While I absolutely hate being unable to get KEI (I<br/>\nnever played without it on a blue server, from the first moment I can get to<br/>\nNexus alive on up, starting at first level), PotG and such, on PvP servers<br/>\n(where I play a lot now) it&#39;s a wonderful blessing, as the cowardly Player<br/>\nKillers can&#39;t buff themselves up to invulnerability for the times they&#39;re<br/>\nhanging around zonelines murdering everyone who comes through.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey shouldn&#39;t have nerfed Uber spells, but they almost certainly just got<br/>\nfed up with being butchered by 16th level PKers with 2000 HP and unlimited<br/>\nmana.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; be quiting this game, which in effect may lead to my defection as <br/>\n&gt; well due to the incressing dificulty of this so call &quot;class balancing&quot;<br/>\n&gt; now mind you this is total horse shit on sonys part, and they are <br/>\n&gt; taking all the fun and adventur out of this game by making every <br/>\n&gt; thing totaly impossible and un reachable, now i know not every one <br/>\n&gt; feels like this but not every one is a druid who with out c3 can <br/>\n&gt; cast no more that 3 spells with out haveing to sit for 20 minets and <br/>\n&gt; meddititing for example<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They WANT you to quit, but you&#39;re not supposed to do it for another few<br/>\nmonths, until EQ2 comes out. They are, in essence, giving way too much fuel<br/>\nto the EverQuest fire, so that it will burn really bright until November (or<br/>\nwhatever the current release date), then go out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What im asking my fellow everquest players and there friends is for <br/>\n&gt; there suport in the effort we are trying to get sony to see, that <br/>\n&gt; they are systematicly desimating a game that once was fun and <br/>\n&gt; enjoyable.
