I&#39;v found that roaming outdoors (my<br/>\nprefered method of hunting outdoors) is very frustration when done with even<br/>\none other person. Server lag and client prediction makes you hunt your group<br/>\nmore than prey so I prefer to do it solo. I also have a druid and have<br/>\nhelped many people cross antonica and always had trouble having people<br/>\nalways either disappearing or running in circles. With my group we always<br/>\nmet at the end of the trip cause everyone knew how to get there, much less<br/>\nfrustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a necro, and as we go up in lvls especially after 29 when we get our<br/>\nlast store bought pet, we do too much damage to the mob to have the pet<br/>\ntaunt it (I&#39;ll be lucky to mae a 34 pet at 39 so even if the pet could taunt<br/>\nit would not last long) so my only choice left is to kite.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy should I group if I don&#39;t have to, grouping outdoors is silly I&#39;m seeing<br/>\ngroups around the aviak village and I find it funny. The spawns are too<br/>\nsporadic for a group, and roaming the outdoors with a group is nearly<br/>\nimpossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve played a druid to 37 grouping all the way from 19-37, kited very rarely<br/>\nonly when my group of friends were not on so I&#39;ve so I wanted to try<br/>\nsomething different, but to catch up to my friends I am trying to level fast<br/>\nand soloing will let me do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nDruid to 37 - 26 days played time grouping after 19<br/>\nNecro to 27 - 8 days played time solo. This includes about 18 hours in total<br/>\ncamping jboots and about 8 hours hunting green skels for 3 backpacks of bone<br/>\nchips<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no interest in revisiting dungeons that I spent tons of time in<br/>\nalready.<br/>\n.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
