Lowering faction with the<br/>\nknights is fine, since just killing orcs will raise it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nunsure about this<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as I plan to be a world traveler, are there any kills that will<br/>\nincrease faction with vendors/guards in Grobb or Oggok that won&#39;t too<br/>\nseriously damage faction with the smaller races?<br/>\n<br/>\nno clue<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, on the CHA raising end, does the Leatherfoot Raider Quest really<br/>\nrequire D&#39;Vinn&#39;s Dragoon Dirk as it appears?
