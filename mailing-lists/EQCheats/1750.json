That one <br/>\ndid not follow the terms of agreement, and yes, was illegal, however, <br/>\nI think you should all read about the second one.<br/>\nThe second one is completely legal, and you cannot lose your account <br/>\nusing it. The EverQuest officials don&#39;t like it very much, but they <br/>\nhave to live with it. They are not allowed to delete your account, <br/>\neven if they were to found out you were using it and in the part of <br/>\nEverQuest. GM&#39;s absolutely hate it, and most of them would delete <br/>\nyour account, though they are not allowed, if they found out. If they <br/>\nwere to do this, you could complain to Sony and they would be FORCED <br/>\nto give your account back. All the EverQuest officials know about <br/>\nthis second one, and they can&#39;t do anything about it. It isn&#39;t a <br/>\nthird party program, and does not, in any of the rules and terms of <br/>\nagreement, go against what they say. <br/>\nI do repeat that they already know about this. They cannot do <br/>\nanything about it, and they don&#39;t really care. The only people who <br/>\nactually care are the GM&#39;s because, they lose there power over other <br/>\nplayers. They like the power, and that is why they delete other <br/>\naccounts. They can get in serious trouble with Sony if they were to <br/>\ndo this. <br/>\nI have so far met 1 GM from EverQuest that has decided to join this. <br/>\nThey were one of the few GM&#39;s that were at Lead-Administrator status <br/>\nor lower that thought this was neat. This thing has been worked on <br/>\nalmost since EverQuest was made. <br/>\nThis is completely legal. On there site, they show that they are not <br/>\naffilitated with the EverQuest makers/programmers, and show the <br/>\nEverQuest trademark at the bottom.<br/>\nIt was very nice that you thought about that first, and I totally <br/>\nagree. The first one will not be added because the site was <br/>\ndestroyed, and the version I have on my computer no longer works with <br/>\nEverQuest because they updated the patch.<br/>\nI am adding in the one thing tomorrow. Many people like this, and it <br/>\nis growing every day ever since Guild Wars started =). I haven&#39;t <br/>\nreally tried it yet myself, but Guild Wars is supposed to be amazing.<br/>\nFrom your proud GM of this thing:<br/>\n(Lord Deimos The Slaughterer) Currently second in command on two <br/>\nservers and GM on five other servers, 7 total.<br/>\nAnd when you join, look for my great GM friends too =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nName: Rallos<br/>\nRanks: mgtg<br/>\nServers:<br/>\n(Semi_Legit) Jezebell&#39;s Server<br/>\nBadbing Semi-Legit Server<br/>\nBahamut Zero (Legit) Server<br/>\n<br/>\nName: Nilar<br/>\nRanks:<br/>\nGm-Impossible  <br/>\nmgtg<br/>\nServers:<br/>\n(Semi-Legit) Jezebell&#39;s Server<br/>\nSaltyBooger&#39;s (Non-Legit) Server<br/>\nBadabing Semi-Legit Server<br/>\n<br/>\nName: Agushor<br/>\nRanks: <br/>\nGm-Impossible<br/>\nServer&#39;s:<br/>\nBahamut Zero<br/>\n<br/>\nName :Slipknot<br/>\nRanks:<br/>\nGm-Administrator<br/>\nServers:<br/>\nDil&#39;s World Server<br/>\n<br/>\nName: SaltyBooger:<br/>\nRanks:<br/>\nGm-Impossible<br/>\nServers:<br/>\nSaltyBooger&#39;s (Non-Legit) Server<br/>\n<br/>\nName: Nauglar<br/>\nRanks:<br/>\nGm-Impossible<br/>\nServers: <br/>\nNauglar&#39;s Server<br/>\n<br/>\nI myself am known as<br/>\nName: Lord Deimos The Slaughterer (aka Lord or Deimos or Lord Deimos)<br/>\nRanks:<br/>\nGm-Administrator<br/>\nGm-Impossible<br/>\nmgmt<br/>\nServers:<br/>\nBahamut Zero (Legit) Server<br/>\nNauglar&#39;s Server<br/>\nTeh J&#39;has Server<br/>\nSaltyBoogers (Non-Legit) Server<br/>\n<br/>\nHope to see you all joining tomorrow =).<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting GM Facts:<br/>\nDid you know that there are 157 GM Commands<br/>\nDid you know that the Plane of Time B has 4 Hidden Areas<br/>\nDid you know that load is a zone (GM)<br/>\nDid you know that Sun Set Home is a zone (GM)<br/>\nDid you know that load is a plane<br/>\nDid you know that Gm-Impossible and Mgmt are not what they are really <br/>\ncalled<br/>\nGm-Impossible = Server Debugger (Highest Rank)<br/>\nMgmg = Server Operator (Second Highest Rank)<br/>\nDid you know that GM&#39;s can go invisible whenever they want<br/>\nDid you know that a GM shrine is when 1 or more GM&#39;s are present in <br/>\nan area as an NPC recommded size of 20 or higher<br/>\nDid you know that every time a GM changes your first name, you go <br/>\nLinkdead<br/>\nDid you know that GM&#39;s are people too (HARD HARD QUESTION lol)<br/>\nDid you know an event is when a GM is at an area and starts spawning <br/>\nstuff with really awesome items (That would be my main thing next to <br/>\nZone Building)<br/>\nDid you know that the GM commands do not start with / like /kill, <br/>\nthey start with #, #kill<br/>\nDid you know that GM&#39;s have hacking commands? <br/>\n#gmspeed on (Makes you run really really fast) Permanent unless <br/>\nturned off, that means you log off and log back on, and you still <br/>\nhave it.<br/>\n#flymode 1 (Makes you fly) Not permanent<br/>\n#haste 85 (Makes you have haste by 85%) Not permanent<br/>\nDid you know that when you make your name too long, it makes these <br/>\nawesome symbols at the end of it that change every time you move<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you enjoy these fun facts, and ask around the servers for:<br/>\nLord<br/>\nLord Deimos<br/>\nDeimos<br/>\nLord Deimos The Slaughterer<br/>\nThose are my world-wide names =).
