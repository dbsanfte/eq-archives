Might as well get upset at<br/>\nOneList for their little &quot;commerical&quot; tagged on each and every email someone sends to the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I WILL have to agree that the +ACI crap, (Which is why I included so much of the previous<br/>\ncomments in my reply) is annoying. (I even had to edit all that junk out when I forwarded it out.) I<br/>\nunderstand it is probably something his mail program puts in and he/she has no idea that this junk<br/>\nis in there.
