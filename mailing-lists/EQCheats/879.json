I have spoken with GM&#39;s and <br/>\nguides alike - there IS anti-camping coding in the game. They&#39;re just not <br/>\nimplemented everywhere! You need to figure out where they are. I personally <br/>\nhave tested areas in Befallen, and have found it to be true, because certain <br/>\ncreatures spawn quicker with no campers in the area. In other areas, <br/>\ncreatures spawn just as quickly with or without campers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even if you don&#39;t believe me, what do you think having a 4+ hour respawn <br/>\nrate is? Chopped liver? In my book, that&#39;s just another form of anti-camping <br/>\ncode meant to discourage camping to me!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
