Anyone know how to obtain this item? King Tranix is<br/>\n&gt; the head gnoll in BB, isn&#39;t he? I have heard him once before last night,<br/>\n&gt; hollering back when I played a young warrior. I was on my way through BB<br/>\n&gt; last night with my shaman when I heard Tranix hollering, I stopped, and he<br/>\n&gt; hit me frm behind. Quick fight, but he didn&#39;t have anything but a bronze<br/>\n&gt; mace (was green to this 28th shaman). Any clues? Suppose it could have<br/>\n&gt; something to do with the named gnolls out in EK?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist members: don&#39;t miss out on the latest news at ONElist<br/>\n&gt; Join our community member news update at <br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter5\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter5</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get paid to surf the web!
