The stats look pretty reasonable (not quite<br/>\nlike a Shiny Hally, but I REALLY want to stick with the axes!).  I<br/>\nunderstand it is a quest for evil characters, but how is the quest<br/>\ninitiated?  What is involved?  How much are these weapons selling for?  I<br/>\nwas figuring around 100 plat...a little under what the Hally is selling for<br/>\n&#39;cause it lacks the damage of the Hally.<br/>\nAlso, I was thinkin about heading up to High Hold and was wondering what lvl<br/>\nyou would need to be to get a Tomahawk or a Halberd...any feedback??<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nThoradin of Bristlebane<br/>\nPaladin of Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
