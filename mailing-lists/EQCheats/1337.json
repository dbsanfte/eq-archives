I was under the impression that it was the Preacher that had<br/>\nit. But I can&#39;t seem to get it.. Anyone know if it is the preacher or is it<br/>\nin another area ?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I read on everlore that the staffs are part of a quest. Somehow you<br/>\ncan use the Water Crystal Staff and starts a long quest to get a great mage<br/>\nuseable one handed magic staff or something... Im curious if any of you have<br/>\nany idea as to what it is ?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nReuben</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
