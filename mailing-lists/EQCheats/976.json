(only had ICQ open)  when the<br/>\nCTRL-ALT-DEL<br/>\n&gt; window came up (I pushed em) I could again use my mouse while it was up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; when I tried to go back into EQ it didn&#39;t work, but it still takes time to<br/>\n&gt; camp out your character eh? :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m thinking this may be able to allow some cheat programs, but probably<br/>\n&gt; not, everything seems to me server side except for hot keys.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But, I am not a good enough programmer to write something that might be<br/>\nable<br/>\n&gt; to take advantage of this, nor do I know anyone who is.  If you are give<br/>\n&gt; your input and see if anything works eh?  hehehe...if anyone does figure<br/>\n&gt; something out they&#39;d be a god to EQ cheaters :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hope something comes of this,<br/>\n&gt; Omeg<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Create a list for FRIENDS & FAMILY...<br/>\n&gt; ...and YOU can WIN $100 to Amazon.com.
