Plain and simple. End of<br/>\nstatement.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo role-playing excuses allowed. If guides are accepting role-playing<br/>\nexcuses and allowing it to continue then those guides are not following the<br/>\nrules.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuards in all areas have loot and give experience. They are there to be<br/>\nkilled. The fact that they protect newbies in their homelands is an added<br/>\nbonus, but any sort of assistance they are given by players to attack the<br/>\npeople hunting them does go against the PVP avoidance rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people are hunting your guards in your homeland you have no recourse but<br/>\nto duel them yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone wanted to know what was the official answer according to actual<br/>\nguide rules, so I asked.<br/>\n&#92;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
