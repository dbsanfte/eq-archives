We were told that there<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;a &quot;spawn line&quot;, ie, don&#39;t cross it or the SK will not spawn.  Is this the<br/>\n&gt;case?  If so, is that line at the end of the tunnel?  Or inside the room?<br/>\n&gt;It was fairly frustrating.  Also, there was another group there camping for<br/>\n&gt;the Robes, and I never saw that Theor..they...whatever guy that is supposed<br/>\n&gt;to drop the robes.  Does the same thing apply for him?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I spent about 3 days in Befallen and my parties got a total of 5 BBCs, 3<br/>\nThaum robes and 2 Gossamier robes, countless daggers of Marknek, and not a<br/>\nsingle blackened wand (the item I was looking for).  There is NO spawn line<br/>\nor any kind of anti camp radius on ANY of the mobs in befallen.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\nstanding next to mobs when they spawned with the aforementioned items.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Lastly..how often would you say the SK would normally spawn?  Every 1/2<br/>\n&gt;hour?  Hour?  2 hours?  I probably will not return to Befallen, unless it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;with my Paladin with the objective of getting that BBC for him....so the<br/>\n&gt;info would be appreciated.  That place is just swarming with DE&#39;s, and it<br/>\n&gt;makes my dwarven skin crawl.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, I hate the place too.  The spawn time in Befallen is about 20<br/>\nminutes, and the SK spawns about 25% of the time.  About 33% of the time<br/>\nthat he spawns, he has a BBC.  So I guess if you are looking for a BBC,<br/>\nplan on being there for 3-4 hours or so.  I hate camping, so I&#39;d just run<br/>\nthe entire 3rd floor - Thaum room,  Darkelf SK, and Troll SK.  We still<br/>\nended up at the start of the spawn cycle before the 20 minutes was up.  I<br/>\nhate this dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandeep Shekar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCampaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nDiscuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
