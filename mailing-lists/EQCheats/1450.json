They are there to be<br/>\n&gt;killed. The fact that they protect newbies in their homelands is an added<br/>\n&gt;bonus, but any sort of assistance they are given by players to attack the<br/>\n&gt;people hunting them does go against the PVP avoidance rule.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If people are hunting your guards in your homeland you have no recourse but<br/>\n&gt;to duel them yourself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Someone wanted to know what was the official answer according to actual<br/>\n&gt;guide rules, so I asked. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
