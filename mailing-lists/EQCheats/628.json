I can&#39;t stress the fact<br/>\nThat you get out only what you put in to the game. I have nights where<br/>\nI&#39;ll do nothing but try to map, I guess that makes me lame since I&#39;m not<br/>\nLeveling while I&#39;m doing it though huh?

The RP aspects of this game are<br/>\n about 1/10th of UO&#39;s even though that game was riddled<br/>\n with Player Killers, bugs and exploits. I enjoy the<br/>\n game, but I feel after playing similar game types that<br/>\n this game corrals you more into the powergamer role. <br/>\n<br/>\n I get into the mindset that I can play this game for a<br/>\n few hours and be about the same as I started or I can<br/>\n play something like Heroes of Might and Magic III and<br/>\n go through a few scenarios. <br/>\n<br/>\n I will more likely plan to leave due to slow leveling<br/>\n than I would if I would see constant improvements in<br/>\n my character. <br/>\n<br/>\n Even level 50s still have to go in two full groups to<br/>\n take on the tougher stuff like the dragons. <br/>\n<br/>\n Belgarth Wolfstrider <br/>\n<br/>\n --- seekerslady+AEA-geocities.com wrote:<br/>\n  From: seekerslady+AEA-geocities.com<br/>\n  <br/>\n  I used to play meridian 59. I loved this game but<br/>\n  people got burned out on<br/>\n  it becuase you could build too fast and then got<br/>\n  bored. Then people went<br/>\n  around and PKed each other. It turned a wonderful<br/>\n  online community into a<br/>\n  garbage dump. What is your great hurry? You planning<br/>\n  on leaving soon? As<br/>\n  long as you are having fun and meeting new people<br/>\n  and playing a game you<br/>\n  like what difference does it make what level you are<br/>\n  or how fast you get<br/>\n  there. These games are ment to be played for years<br/>\n  not weeks. I am<br/>\n  surprised that people have already been able to max<br/>\n  out. Now what do they<br/>\n  have to do? Ok they can go anywhere and kill almost<br/>\n  anything but how long<br/>\n  before they get bored and move on? The game has only<br/>\n  been out a few months.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Just my 2 cents<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Feather Dreamwalker of Rathe<br/>\n  <br/>\n  I agree that level gaining is quite slow. 8-10<br/>\n  hours<br/>\n  for a level is a bit much. I can&#39;t imagine the high<br/>\n  30s and above. <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Belgarth <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n Start a new ONElist list +ACY- you can WIN great prizes+ACE-<br/>\n For details on ONElist&#39;s NEW FRIENDS +ACY- FAMILY program, go to<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n For more information on how to join the best roleplaying game on the<br/>\nnet goto www.everquest.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways+ACE-<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAre you?
