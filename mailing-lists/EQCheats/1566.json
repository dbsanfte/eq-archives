There is a merchant that sells Bat wings. Even after the server resets and no<br/>\none has longed in, she is waiting there with as many bat wings as you can afford.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one I know about is in the mages guild in W. Freeport. I have personally bought backpacks worth<br/>\nof wings when me AND my group were baking. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOmeg Felligan wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Omeg Felligan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:omeg_felligan@...\">omeg_felligan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, not exactly...whenever they patch or server goes down for some reason<br/>\n&gt; the merchant inventory is reset so all those bat wings get super glued back<br/>\n&gt; onto rats to make more bats I guess.  Well, at anyrate I&#39;m guessing that the<br/>\n&gt; selling bat wings would work right after a new patch and for a few days<br/>\n&gt; after that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Omeg<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t work much anymore... Bat Wings are purchasable in unlimited<br/>\n&gt; &gt;amounts in Kithicor and West Freeport (probably other zones as well, Ogguk<br/>\n&gt; &gt;or Grobb almost ceratinly) for about 14 copper each. People are beginning<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;know this. :) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
