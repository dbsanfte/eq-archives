I have seven questions:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1. How do you know when you are maxed at a skill?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*** Level *5 +5  ie a level 10 player has 55 as max<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;2. Where are Najena and Befallen?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*** Befallen is easily reached if you exit freeport from the west<br/>\n    gate, then make sure you have the wall on your lefthand side,<br/>\n    zone 2 times and then after a short while you will se a litup cave<br/>\n    entrance, thats the entrance. note that you will pass a large<br/>\n    opening in the sand and thats the entrance to north karanas.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Consult your map about najena<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;3. What should a level six Barbarian be doing with his limited &gt;amounts of <br/>\n&gt;time?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*** Go to bb (black burrow) but be carefull, If you are you will have<br/>\n    no problem advancing. Go for the scrawny gnolls and be carefull<br/>\n    There are HUGE trains in bb, probably the worst in the game,<br/>\n    but its worth it, IMHO<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;4. How is experience divided in a group?  Is it the same amout as solo, <br/>\n&gt;split<br/>\n&gt;into shares, or is there more total experience given out?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*** The higher the level the more xp. a level 15 will get more xp<br/>\n    then a level 11 if they team. I dont know if its the same amount<br/>\n    on the yellow bar (since the lev 15 need more xp then the lev 11).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;5. Are there any items I can get on Tunare to raise my intelligence?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*** dont know<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;6. Are there any quests to become non-PvP?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*** dont know<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVashi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;You have my deepest gratitude in advance for any information.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rocjaw,<br/>\n&gt;Son of Halas<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today.<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
