But i didnt want<br/>\nto skimp out on exp either. I was sick and tired of befallen so i decided to<br/>\ngo test my luck at Lake Rathe. Well lets just say i was there for a long<br/>\nlong time and still am. During the day look for the occasional gnoll<br/>\nembalmer or high shaman (Shamans have runed totem staffs while embalmers<br/>\ncarry magic skulls and crysknives ) Or hunt any of the aviaks you see, the<br/>\ndrop bronze weapons and cash or words for research, all sell for a few gold<br/>\nor plat. At night the undead come out and they are somewhat tough so get in<br/>\na group and kill the drybones for small bronze. <br/>\n<br/>\nThats what i did around your level.<br/>\n<br/>\nLothaniel/Rayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tPatricia Halas[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tThursday, June 24, 1999 2:06 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Magical Weapon<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Patricia Halas &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am currently in HH collecting extra ringmail to sell in Halas so I can <br/>\n&gt; have enough money to buy a combine longsword but it is getting so boring.<br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; have nevered seen that named gnoll fellow even though I spend most of my <br/>\n&gt; time hunting gnolls.
