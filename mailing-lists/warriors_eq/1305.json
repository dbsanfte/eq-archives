I was a 12th warrior at the time with two rangers and a<br/>\ncleric if I remeber correctly and the three tanks coundn&#39;t outdamage that 13th<br/>\ndruid. It wasn&#39;t until the cleric starting using expulse undead that we ever got<br/>\nexperience. There may have been an undocumented fix in a patch since, but from<br/>\nthat experience I believe that the experience went to the single PC that did the<br/>\nmost damage not the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2cp. Hope it helps,<br/>\n<br/>\nSurtur<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. I still haven&#39;t gotten a response on where to look for guild links for E&#39;ci.<br/>\nPlease email me with info if you have it please.

Thats why,<br/>\n&gt; really, only higher level wizards can steal kill.  This is not the case?? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
