You can ALMOST solo it at that \nlevel, if you have regen, SOW, and a good bow, and the exp is very nice, I \nsoloed orcs at the top at 36 and 2, 3 of them were worth a blue. If you have a \nGOOD connection and a good party, you can try the orc fort, but if your \nconnection is less than perfect you&#39;ll get some nasty lag, and if your puller is \nless than perfect you&#39;ll get some nasty trains. Let a caster pull here with \nsnare.</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpool10550@...\"\n title=\"jpool10550@...\">jpool10550@...</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"warriors_eq@yahoogroups.com\">warriors_eq@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Friday, February 16, 2001 9:39 \n  AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [warriors_eq] 35 warrior in \n  Velious</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>I just got Velious and was wondering if a lvl 35 could go \n  there?
