First off you have to kill the two spiders you see<br/>\nfirst, yes ther eis two you just cant see the second one untill you walk<br/>\nin....drawe them out to where the croc is....so no other spiders jump in on<br/>\nyou . when you dipsose of them, go to where they were and hang a right.<br/>\nyoull see a larger heart spider and a normal one. Gotta kill them both as<br/>\nwell. The larger doesnt give you the sheild tho, you have to sit and wait<br/>\nfor the next respawn which will be 2 normal hearts. then kill them, then sit<br/>\nthere and wait again. THE NEXT spawn will be the greater and a normal heart<br/>\nspider, watch out the poison from the greater consues around 250 hp<br/>\nroughly....so make sure you got some kind of healer....once you kill it,<br/>\nwhoever loots the body will get the shield itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce more the spawninggoes like this.<br/>\nLarger/normal........./normal/normal..............greater/normal...........n<br/>\normal/normal..........repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nhope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh the Giant is about level 18-21 and normal heart spiders can be from 11 to<br/>\n15.<br/>\nJohn Zwanenburg<br/>\nTips Support/Support Sipt<br/>\nTel: (613) 998-2745<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tThursday, May 20, 1999 1:01 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Guk Question<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; John can you help me out with this question?<br/>\n&gt; I am about to hit lvl 13 and was thinkin about trying for the chitin<br/>\n&gt; shield.<br/>\n&gt; I I get together a strong group do we have a shot?<br/>\n&gt; To get to the Spider(s) do you go into the water from the room with the<br/>\n&gt; two<br/>\n&gt; frogs that spawn that is close to the entrance?
