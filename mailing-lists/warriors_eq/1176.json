You still have not<br/>\naddressed the biggest point.  Whether our head is cut off, or you get fried<br/>\nby a lightning strike, your just as dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, let&#39;s talk fantasy, in most fantasy novels the mighty wizard isn&#39;t<br/>\nsitting around frying one creature, he&#39;s unleashed on an army of critters.<br/>\nThis is where the mage should shine, his ability to strike at a distance at<br/>\nmany targets, doing significant damage.  A fireball should hot everything in<br/>\nan area, not just one creature.  The warrior should be able, at high levels<br/>\nto work his way thru an army, one opponent at a time.  But, when that blade<br/>\nslices and dices, the end effect is the same as their spell, bad for whoever<br/>\nis one the receiving end.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy play a wizard, because no matter who good a warrior is, he can be<br/>\noverrun by alot of opponents, the Wizard can attack these mobs of creatures,<br/>\nsoften them up, or cause them to run, buying the warrior time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what of the fantasy of the mighty Knight slaying the dragon with Lance<br/>\nand sword?  Can&#39;t happen here can it?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you are arguing for is an artificial set of rules in the name of game<br/>\nbalance.  I say that there are many ways to balance out the different<br/>\nclasses, while preserving both the realistic and fantasy feel of Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, my opinion may differ from yours, but it is not wrong. That<br/>\nstatement is just darn impolite and provocative, and it goes to hinder<br/>\nintellectual debate, rather then encourage the free exchange of ideas.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think those kind of statements have a place here, but that is just my<br/>\nopinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Wayne Sheppard [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, June 11, 1999 6:44 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Digest Number 59<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You are wrong  Your experiences with live steel weapons does <br/>\n&gt; not relate to a<br/>\n&gt; fantasy game.  You have no valid comparison to what damage a <br/>\n&gt; sword should do<br/>\n&gt; versus a magical spell.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Melee fighters should be able to do just as much damage, if <br/>\n&gt; not more [than<br/>\n&gt; a caster]&quot;<br/>\n&gt; This would be totally imbalanced.  If a warrior could could <br/>\n&gt; do that much<br/>\n&gt; damage, and wear the best armor in the game, and have the <br/>\n&gt; most hp&#39;s, why<br/>\n&gt; would anyone play anything else?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Warriors do less damage than a wizard BECAUSE they can stay in a fight<br/>\n&gt; longer with the monster due to his greater hp&#39;s and armor.  <br/>\n&gt; Over time, a<br/>\n&gt; Warrior will do more damage that the Wizard.  But it would <br/>\n&gt; wreck the game if<br/>\n&gt; Warriors could deal damage as fast as Wizards.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wayne<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    Date: Thu, 10 Jun 1999 14:37:55 -0700<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    From: &quot;Obergfell, Steven&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SObergfell@...\">SObergfell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Re: Petition or Melee vs. Caster damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sorry, that last email was just too hard to read!!!  Here <br/>\n&gt; it is again in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; plain text!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I think the difference between melee combatants and <br/>\n&gt; casters magic should<br/>\n&gt; &gt;be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thus:  Melee fighters should be able to do just as much <br/>\n&gt; damage, if not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;more,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; whereas a caster may strike from a distance, and strike <br/>\n&gt; multiple targets<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with area effect spells.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I am the president of a national group that fights with live steel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;weapons.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;ve been fighting with long swords, 2-handed swords, axes <br/>\n&gt; and maces for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;10<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; years, and I am very comfortable with just how devastating <br/>\n&gt; these weapons<br/>\n&gt; &gt;can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; be.  No matter if you are struck by lightning or are cut <br/>\n&gt; in 2 by a large<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; axe, you are just as dead!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So perhaps the direction we need to seek, and the <br/>\n&gt; difference between<br/>\n&gt; these<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; types of characters. melee and caster, is not how much <br/>\n&gt; damage they do,<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; how.  A caster should be able to reach far away, and <br/>\n&gt; strike multiple<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; targets, while the great warrior should only be able to <br/>\n&gt; strike at one<br/>\n&gt; &gt;target<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; at a time, but be able to mow them down like wheat.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Oh, and if anyone is interested in an organization that <br/>\n&gt; allow you to wear<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; armor and swing a real blade ( and trust me, it will give <br/>\n&gt; you a whole new<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; perspective on your RPGing!) check out our website!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; www.adrianempire.org&#92;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist has over 165,000 e-mail communities from which to choose!<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=======================================================<br/>\nThis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.
