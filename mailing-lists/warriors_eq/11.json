Personally I went for the 1H.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will make you a bit less effective untill you reach about lvl 15, when<br/>\nyou get dual wield and doubble attack. This will from there on be pretty<br/>\nmuch the same, if not better than a 2h weapon.<br/>\nSince you are a Human warrior, you cannot use bash, and 2 1H weapons or a 2H<br/>\nweapon and bash due to that you will need a shield. Therefor you should keep<br/>\non using Kick. Bash never will hit it for you, if you dont decide to use a<br/>\nshield and a 1h sword, who I havent seen any warrior over lvl 15 use.<br/>\nAlso keep Taunt and Sense heading maxed, these are two good skills to use in<br/>\nthe future. A warrior who cannot taunt the beast whacking the wizard to<br/>\npieces are no warrior at all and will loose.<br/>\nBind Wounds is expensive to work up, but I have now learned it is a very<br/>\nusefull skill and should be worked on. (have a magician summon bandages for<br/>\nyou)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also recommended that you have a primary weapon skill, and a<br/>\nsecoundary. At later levels if you find an awesome weapon you be sure you<br/>\ncan use it! I would personally recommend working 1h slash as primary, and 2h<br/>\nslash as secoundary.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou never need to put more than one skill point in any skill, but some<br/>\nskills can be a pain in the ass to work when they are under 10 skill. I have<br/>\nnever put more than 9 in a skill, and I now have almost maxed out Doubble<br/>\nattack and dual wield at lvl 16 (soon 17).<br/>\n<br/>\nA place for you to hunt now at lvl 7 and all the way up to lvl 15 or 16 is<br/>\nBlackBurrow.<br/>\nI did it up to lvl 16 there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt last I would like to tell you all about a messageboard for Warriors.<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.interzet.com<br/>\nGoto messageboards - warrior.<br/>\nIt is well visited!<br/>\n<br/>\nChtuga<br/>\nBarbarian warrior<br/>\nE&#39;ci server<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kelly Pruett &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pruett@...\">pruett@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: Warrior List &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Warrior@onelist.com\">EQ_Warrior@onelist.com</a>&gt;; Warrior2 List<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: 14. mai 1999 14:53<br/>\nSubject: [warriors_eq] Ideas for a low level newbie?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
