They added a ring for high level<br/>\nplayers only. When you got to a spot you liked you &quot;turned&quot; the ring. After that<br/>\nyou could go anywhere ... then again &quot;turn&quot; the ring and ....  poof, you were<br/>\nback at your bound ring spot. It was SUCH a cool item.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, I think the Verant guys want to keep people separated for some<br/>\nreason in this game (zone server reasons maybe??)  There does need to be a way<br/>\nto stay somewhere though ... maybe they could balance it with a high cost or<br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faderic<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Jones, Brian&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Um, which part did you think was funny?

Or at least<br/>\n&gt; give a spell to a wizard that allows you to gate them back (they<br/>\n&gt; are still not able to bind you anywhere but a city).<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
