If a warrior could could do that much<br/>\ndamage, and wear the best armor in the game, and have the most hp&#39;s, why<br/>\nwould anyone play anything else?<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors do less damage than a wizard BECAUSE they can stay in a fight<br/>\nlonger with the monster due to his greater hp&#39;s and armor.  Over time, a<br/>\nWarrior will do more damage that the Wizard.  But it would wreck the game if<br/>\nWarriors could deal damage as fast as Wizards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;    Date: Thu, 10 Jun 1999 14:37:55 -0700<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    From: &quot;Obergfell, Steven&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SObergfell@...\">SObergfell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: Petition or Melee vs. Caster damage<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, that last email was just too hard to read!!!
