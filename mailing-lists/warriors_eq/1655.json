I&#39;ve more or less soloed my warrior up until<br/>\n&gt; now (23rd level) and I feel a little stumped as<br/>\n&gt; to what to do next. I can only play for an hour<br/>\n&gt; or 2 at night, so it&#39;s really difficult to find<br/>\n&gt; regular people to group with right now. Do any of<br/>\n&gt; you know a half way decent place that I can<br/>\n&gt; either solo at this level or an easy dungeon to<br/>\n&gt; get into a group? Keep in mind, I am Teir&#39;dal, so<br/>\n&gt; faction is an issue to a certain degree...<br/>\n&gt; Obviously I&#39;m most interested in spots good for<br/>\n&gt; xp & loot, but I&#39;ll take what I can get. Any<br/>\n&gt; help will be appreciated... Thanx! =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PS Anyone have a clue what happened to the<br/>\n&gt; EQ-Warrior list???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kinrea Keres<br/>\n&gt; 23rd DE Warrior<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuks Revenge<br/>\n&gt; Saryrn............<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; Sinarya L&#39;achesis<br/>\n&gt; 21st DE Necromancer<br/>\n&gt; Guild Leader<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuks Revenge<br/>\n&gt; Saryrn Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Thousands of Stores.
