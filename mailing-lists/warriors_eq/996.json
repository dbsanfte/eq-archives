I was going to use the hollow tree for a resting<br/>\narea and found meself at the bottom of the gnolls <br/>\ndungeon.  I was still bare except for my kelt and rusty<br/>\nlongsword, yet I still felt the need to try to retrieve my<br/>\nfew possesions.  Call it stupidity if you will, but I was<br/>\nable to retrieve my corpse and make it back out alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngarth, Clan Anstruther, Warrior of the 15th Tier<br/>\n&quot;Periissem ni periisem&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tPatricia Halas[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tFriday, June 04, 1999 10:09 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Body Recovery<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Patricia Halas &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ahh, understand I risk losing my equipment if the world crashes while I am<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; camping and my body is left in the open desert (or at the inn in Oasis as<br/>\n&gt; it <br/>\n&gt; is now), but I must trust in the will of my lord and protector Rallos Zek.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I was a young warrior of the 5th Rank I fell down the hole on the top<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; level of black burrow and was forced to leave my body and all my brand new<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; patchwork armor.  No problem, Rallos Zek gave me the power to start anew<br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; rebuild my weath until I now have half banded and half ring mail, a<br/>\n&gt; combine <br/>\n&gt; long sword, a fine steel long sword and a fine steel 2H sword.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; SH** - It is going to take a whole lot longer to get that stuff back if I <br/>\n&gt; lose it.
