In pen and paper","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-340293953\">Ok here&#39;s my opinion. I started a warrior because that is my favorite class.<br/>\nI like to fight monsters and such, and I love to use a sword. In pen and<br/>\npaper games I am usually a ranger or a thief because in those games it&#39;s<br/>\nreally not about the type of character you play, but how you play them.<br/>\nAnyways, let&#39;s just say I am not really too happy with the way that warriors<br/>\n(especially humans) play in EQ. I never played anything else, but there was<br/>\nsomething that was lacking. I made a ranger today and by level 3 I was<br/>\nloving him. There are so many more advantages. First, being able to pick who<br/>\nyou fight with tracking...Then elves have stats better than humans<br/>\nanyways...add to that the fact that they are EXTREMELY simalar in combat,<br/>\nPLUS have spells. People are arguing that the spells they have suck, and<br/>\nthat they will never be more than 80% of max and blah blah blah....Who<br/>\ncares??!? Warriors don&#39;t get spells at all, and if you want 100% be a mage!<br/>\nWell, I am not abandoning my warrior just yet, but I will be splitting a lot<br/>\nof time with my ranger to see how things even out.<br/>\n<br/>\nTyveris,<br/>\nAspiring Samurai</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
