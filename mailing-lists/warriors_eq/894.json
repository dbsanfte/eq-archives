This is now<br/>\nbecoming IMPOSSIBLE for me at my level to do.  Let me recite a little story.<br/>\n<br/>\nI login on Saturday starting out in lake rathe, camped.  Not to fussed since<br/>\nI can not pull the aviaks anyway, only CASTERS can.  Whats up with that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI moved on to the Egret Aviaks, CAMPED.  hmmm no problem lets try HH, both<br/>\nends camped. sigh, oh well im near Neriak I can head home to stock up and<br/>\ntry out lesser faydark and Mistmoore.  On the boat I get, I arrive in<br/>\nMistmoore for the first time, thought the place was pretty cool.  Learned<br/>\nthe easier areas pretty quick and start pulling for my group.<br/>\n<br/>\nWow this is going pretty well.  Hmmm zone went from 2 groups to 5 groups.<br/>\nOne group SIITING on the gargoyle spawn, another group hogging THE whole<br/>\ngraveyard, and the third, this is the best, the third camping the CORRIDOR<br/>\nbetween the easy side of Mistmoore to the hard side of Mistmoore.  I mean<br/>\nC&#39;MON.  Thats just RUDE.  Everytime we tried to pull some tuffer mobs<br/>\nthrough the corridor their mages pets went berserk and they effectively took<br/>\nall the kills.<br/>\n<br/>\nSIGH<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when lake rathe was empty.  I remember when HH was empty.  Is it<br/>\njust because most people on the server are my level ?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople just DONT understand that a spawn can only support SO many groups.<br/>\nOh, a word of warning, NEVER take a caster to the Aviaks In Lake Rathe, they<br/>\nwont leave.  I know a few of my friends who I didn&#39;t see until they made<br/>\nlevel 25.  They just would not leave that easy xp area.  I hate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nARGH!<br/>\n<br/>\nahhh I feel much better now, thanks for listening.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be starting a new character on MM just to see if its a little better<br/>\nWAY behind the pack.  Lets hope it is.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
