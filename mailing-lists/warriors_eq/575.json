You also need to throw weight into that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; equation.  Because even tho a mino axe has a better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ratio than a FS sword, but after about 3 mobs your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stamina is shot, which lowers your stats, including<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your attack ability.  Try the same thing with 2 FS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; long swords and you&#39;ll still have plenty of stamina.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s a good point, one I&#39;ve not considered.  I haven&#39;t yet had any<br/>\n&gt; problems with either of my characters yet in the Stamina department<br/>\n&gt; (Dwarven Paladin and Troll Warrior); I only have Stamina problems when<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m fleeing across zones, jumping to stay ahead of them.  But it&#39;s an<br/>\n&gt; excellent point; the Mino axe is *heavy*.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Weight also impacts your possible lootage potential; lighter &#39;carry&#39;<br/>\n&gt; gear/weapons = more loot to take back!  This has got to be a good<br/>\n&gt; thing, neh?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2.  That would depend on what you are fighting, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you must also calculate in the reposte skill.  When<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you can reposte for 10 points with a 1h slash or 44<br/>\n&gt; &gt; points with a 2h slash, bit of a difference there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know nothing about Riposte; neither of my characters have it, and no<br/>\n&gt; one on any of the boards/lists/sites I read has said anything about it.<br/>\n&gt;  Anyone have info re: Riposte?
