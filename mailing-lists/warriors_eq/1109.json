But<br/>\nI was invis and invis to undead.  Some of the horrors that can be found in<br/>\nthere is pretty amazing.  I  ant wait till I have a group that can handle<br/>\nthat exploring that place.  The first and only time time I was there, I was<br/>\nlevel21 or 22... cant remember.  We stayed outside, right next to the zone.<br/>\nbut even then, it got very ugly very fast.  Suffice to say i was full health<br/>\n(somewhere around 710hp) and died in less than 5 seconds flat.  Even with a<br/>\nfull group at my back, they didnt have time to cast a single heal i got hit<br/>\nso hard and fast.  I cant remember what hit me, a deathly usher or herald i<br/>\nthink.  something like that.  regardless, the time we spent there before<br/>\nthat was very very good for xp and loot.  you just have to be very careful,<br/>\nknow when to zone, and always use your different camera angles to watch for<br/>\nother incomming mobs.  I actually plan to head back there very soon now that<br/>\nI am much higher level and able to handle a little more than 2 casts from<br/>\none of those nasties.  The shield you mentioned comes from there as well,<br/>\ncalled the Mistmoore Shield I believe.  Bugged shield as well, when you zone<br/>\nto certain zones, or store it in the bank, it just disappears.  it is a<br/>\nknown bug, and apparently they are working on it.  just no resolve as of<br/>\nyet.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that gives you the info your looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Dyvim Kincaid<br/>\nStormriders of Cazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Andrew Palmer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:apalmer@...\">apalmer@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 09, 1999 1:21 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] (no subject)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Andrew Palmer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:apalmer@...\">apalmer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I havent traveled to mistmoore myself but I have seen a cool shield that<br/>\n&gt; comes from there.
