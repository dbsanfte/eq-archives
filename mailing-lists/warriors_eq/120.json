I&#39;ve come to EQ<br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt; &gt;most of us, with a lot of experience in multiplayer gaming. Now, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fairly new to EQ (level 8) but I thought I had a good understanding<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it, and it&#39;s unwritten rules, until now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The other night I was in BlackBurrow in a small group of 3. Two of us<br/>\n&gt; &gt;were at the bottom level, and I was up top, returning from a town<br/>\n&gt; run. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;saw a gnoll guardsman kill someone, so I ran up to take charge of it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;There was nobody else around it. After a few hits it fled to the<br/>\n&gt; lower<br/>\n&gt; &gt;level with me chasing it every step, hacking and kicking. Upon<br/>\n&gt; reaching<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the lower level, there was a mini train already down there, but both<br/>\n&gt; me,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and the members of my group, were working on the gnoll guardsman I<br/>\n&gt; had<br/>\n&gt; &gt;chased down. Towards the end of the fight, a fighter type of some<br/>\n&gt; sort<br/>\n&gt; &gt;walked up and took the final swing on the guardsman. Thinking I had<br/>\n&gt; done<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it ( I had to scroll back to look afterward) I bent over and looted<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;corpse.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The fighter started complaining at once that I was a kill stealer and<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;took his loot. I explained to him that I had chased the monster down,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and had done the most damage, and therefore the computer LET me take<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;kill. He respnded that HE had chased the monster down from the top (I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;never even saw anyone up top but myself) and had made the kill<br/>\n&gt; therefore<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it wasn&#39;t mine to take. I didn&#39;t feel like the argument was worth it<br/>\n&gt; so<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I gave up and tried to trade him the loot. He would not accept, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;instead complained to me via tells that he couldn&#39;t believe I did<br/>\n&gt; that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My questions are:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;1.) Was I ethically wrong to take the loot?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2.) Does the game only allow the majority damage dealer to take the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;loot, or the final swinger?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;3.) How would you guys deal with this situation?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Thanks for any advice ....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-Faderic of Qeynos (Ellorisi Marr server)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Congratulations to &quot;Trail Rider,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR<br/>\n&gt; life!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; &gt;For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
