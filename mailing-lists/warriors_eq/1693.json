Anyone <br/>\n\tknow what the are?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZone Experience <br/>\n<br/>\nAs of the next patch, you will receive additional experience (per kill) in<br/>\nthe following zones: <br/>\n<br/>\n*\tDroga increased by 12% <br/>\n*\tNurga increased by 12% <br/>\n*\tSolusek&#39;s Eye (Sol A) increased by 13% <br/>\n*\tNajena increased by 13% <br/>\n*\tBefallen increased by 13% <br/>\n*\tPaw increased by 13% <br/>\n*\tPermafrost increased by 13% <br/>\n*\tKaesora increased by 18% <br/>\n*\tQeynos Catacombs increased by 20% <br/>\n*\tRunnyeye increased by 20% <br/>\n*\tKerra Ridge increased by 20% <br/>\n*\tThe Hole increased by 25% <br/>\n<br/>\nGrouping Bonus <br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing the next patch, the group bonus will be as follows: <br/>\n<br/>\n*\t2 person group - 2% total bonus. <br/>\n*\t3 person group - 6% total bonus. <br/>\n*\t4 person group - 10% total bonus. <br/>\n*\t5 person group - 14% total bonus. <br/>\n*\t6 person group - 20% total bonus. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis bonus is applied to the total experience reward for killing a creature<br/>\nprior to distributing it to the group. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany people have pointed out that when killing in a group you get less<br/>\nexperience per kill. This is of course true, but what is often missed is<br/>\nthat you can kill many more creatures, and creatures of a higher level when<br/>\nin that group. For instance, a good two-person group should be able to kill<br/>\nthings of a higher level over twice as fast as a solo person should. Now,<br/>\nwe&#39;re going to give them even more of a bonus for doing so, and make it<br/>\neasier for people to find pickup groups on the basis of getting higher<br/>\nscaled bonus. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, we very well may decide to revamp and/or readjust NPC populations<br/>\nand/or experience multipliers in the future in order to ensure that groups<br/>\nadventuring there find them worthwhile. <br/>\n<br/>\nExperience Penalties <br/>\n<br/>\nEffectively class based experience penalties will be removed, although race<br/>\npenalties will remain. <br/>\n<br/>\nSummary <br/>\n<br/>\n*\tThe changes that we are making in the next patch should have a<br/>\nprofound impact upon the game: <br/>\n*\tClasses no longer have a true class-based experience penalty, making<br/>\nit easier for people to play the class that they want to play, rather than<br/>\nthe class that they feel compelled to play due to faster advancement. <br/>\n*\tRace based penalties are no longer shared with the group, and in<br/>\ntruth are not severe enough to greatly impact the advancement speed of any<br/>\nparticular race. Even the race with the worst penalty will level no slower<br/>\nthan a human monk does now, and in truth will level faster due to the other<br/>\nchanges that went in. <br/>\n*\tThe grouping bonus increase, in addition to the other changes, makes<br/>\ngrouping much more efficient, without reducing the current efficiency of<br/>\nsoloing for those who prefer that route. <br/>\n*\tExperience modifiers turned up in the other zones should encourage<br/>\npeople to spread out, have more fun, and allow those staying behind in other<br/>\nareas to have more fun themselves since the area is less crowded. <br/>\n*\tAll players, assuming that they have an experience penalty, or ever<br/>\ngroup with anyone who does, will level faster. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGordon Wrinn<br/>\nAssociate Producer, EQLive<br/>\nSony Online Entertainment<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure, but I think this was on the patch message.
