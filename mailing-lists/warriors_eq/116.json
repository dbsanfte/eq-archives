I am Odhinn MacDoughl, 21st level Barbarian Warrior on the worst =<br/>\nserver to be a Warrior on, Rallos Zek.  I&#39;ve been seeing ye all chat =<br/>\nabout the polished granite tomahawks, and I&#39;m here to answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.)  Acquisition:   Gexnor (sp) Mucktail in Highpass, who respawns from =<br/>\nhalf an hour to once a day, carries the tomahawk, but only rarely.  =<br/>\nOther times he carries the Cracked Darkwood Shield or other useless =<br/>\nitems.  Mucktail is always camped.  I waited a week to get my first =<br/>\ntommy, and decided to just pay for my second.  I paid 200pp, a =<br/>\nreasonable price considering I could level and do other things while =<br/>\nsome bum waited around for Mucky to come back.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.) Utilization:   As ye may have inferred above, I have two Tommys.  =<br/>\nAnd god I love them.  The damage isn&#39;t great per hit, but you get alot =<br/>\nof hits (6 damage, 26 delay).  It is, of course, a magic item.  But the =<br/>\nbest best best feature is that it casts Berserker Strength, which has =<br/>\nsaved my arse more times than I care to admit.  In long melees, it may =<br/>\ncast several times, in most melees it will cast just once.  But what it =<br/>\ndoes is amazing for warriors.  +20 STR, -10 AGI, and a little thing =<br/>\ncalled a Magic Shield.  That&#39;s right, a 50-150point Invulnerability to =<br/>\nattacks, just like them damn magic users get.  You get this a couple of =<br/>\ntimes in a battle, and you, my friend, are on top of the world, cuz all =<br/>\nthe enemy damage gets soaked.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Tommy&#39;s are A.) Expensive B.) Kickass.   I love &#39;em ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOdhinn MacDoughl<br/>\nSkald, Hand Of Tyr<br/>\n21st Level Barbarian Warrior</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
