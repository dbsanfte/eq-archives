After a lot of great<br/>\nhunting, I returned to Halas to drop coin and loot, and decided to stop<br/>\nat the Warrior guild to be sure that they would train him.  Thuxtis had<br/>\nrecently made 14th level and was eagery looking forward to the magical<br/>\n15th.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there I am at the guild (and yes they will train gnmoes), I just<br/>\nhappened to look down the list of skills to train and I see:<br/>\n<br/>\nDual Wield<br/>\nNo Charge<br/>\n<br/>\nHuh? Thuxtis rubs his eyes and looks again.<br/>\n<br/>\nDual Wield<br/>\nNo Charge<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, You don&#39;t have to tell Thuxtis three times, so i reach up and<br/>\nclick on it, then press the practice button.  &quot;Your Skill in Dual Wield<br/>\nhas Gone up&quot;. Awesome... practice, practice, practice, practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did this little gem of a change slip through?  My friend Ramkota<br/>\ninformed me this morning that at 13th he could practice it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the Moral of the story is for all you 13-14 level warriors (and it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t hurt for the 12th to try as well), grab a SOW and RUN to the<br/>\nnearest guild to grab this skill.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n*****************************************************<br/>\n* Okay, who put a stop Payment on my Reality check? *<br/>\n*****************************************************<br/>\n* <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Castle/5225\">http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Castle/5225</a>  *<br/>\n* Scott M Parrish                <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sparrish@...\">sparrish@...</a> *<br/>\n*****************************************************</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
