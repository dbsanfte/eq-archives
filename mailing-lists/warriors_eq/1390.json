I have an amazing hunting ground, two of them<br/>\nactually but now one is totally camped out so i may as well tell the rest of<br/>\nyou where my first one was. Actually this is no BIG secret but still it isnt<br/>\neasy to get to. In lake rathe there are tons of camping spots that are<br/>\nusually open for the taking because its hard to navigate in this zone. My<br/>\nfavorite spot is the large staircase where 3 aviak guards spawn. They spawn<br/>\nevery 2-3 minutes so if you want to do this make sure you are with at least<br/>\ntwo other level 21ish people. No you say why is this good looting? well on<br/>\naverage the aviaks drop anywhere from 6 gold to 1 or 2 plat cash, plus words<br/>\nand pages, plus bronze weapons and even some armor. This can really add up<br/>\nbig time when 3 aviaks spawn 3 minutes apart. so lets say you get the<br/>\naverage 6 gold every loot. no more no less. no weapons or items either. Go<br/>\nthere for one hour, in a group of 3 you will loot 20 times about. Thats 12<br/>\nplat in an hour, not bad considering they usually have stuff along with<br/>\ncash.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere, now you know my OLD hunting spot. its still good and i still go there<br/>\nfrom time to time. Just not as frequently as i used to.<br/>\n<br/>\nRayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tMichael Wooldirdge[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dark@...\">dark@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, June 29, 1999 12:55 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Hunting Grounds<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Actually it wasn&#39;t bragging I told you that it wasn&#39;t hard to get money<br/>\n&gt; for a BloodClaw after level 20 and I play on E&#39;ci so I&#39;m not even on your<br/>\n&gt; server. You asked me where my hunting ground was so I wasn&#39;t bragging. The<br/>\n&gt; reason for not telling you is because once people learn of this it will be<br/>\n&gt; pointless and too crowded to even attempt to hunt there. Bottom line is<br/>\n&gt; explore and you&#39;ll find good hunting grounds.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
