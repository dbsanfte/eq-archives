I am stating a fact: I don&#39;t want to hear someone&#39;s opinions on why<br/>\nwarriors suck on a warrior board for them to tell me how great their cleric<br/>\nis. Who cares that it was a cleric? It could have easily been a Wizard or a<br/>\nNecro, there&#39;s no difference. The point was that this is a warriors board to<br/>\nhelp people who want to play warriors, not for people to discuss the<br/>\ndifferences between clerics and warriors and decide who is better at what.<br/>\nLastly I do want to quote you on something though...<br/>\n&quot;And believe it or not probably the only few classes you COULD compare would<br/>\nbe<br/>\nwars vs clerics<br/>\nwars vs pallys<br/>\nwars vs SKs<br/>\nwars vs monks&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOk time to play a game...anyone ever watch Sesame Street? They have this<br/>\ngame where one thing doesn&#39;t belong in the group of other things...like a<br/>\nscrewdriver, a hammer, a saw, and then an apple. Get the point? Monks:<br/>\nfighter type. Paladin: Fighter type. Shadow Knights: The word Knight speaks<br/>\nfor itself. Cleric: Spellcaster. Clerics were never meant to be fighters,<br/>\nthat is why there is a hybrid cleric/fighter and that is a paladin. Clerics<br/>\nare priests. Again, this is not a flame. I am happy that you find joy in<br/>\nplaying a cleric, I really truly am. I play a monk, a Magician and a Ranger<br/>\nall quite often as well. But I don&#39;t come on this board and tell everyone<br/>\nhow much more fulfilling it is for me to play my monk rather than my<br/>\nwarrior. I am sorry that I might be taking this so personally, but I can<br/>\ncompare it to you walking into an all african-american convention and<br/>\nshouting that you hate black people.

The inital post made by Wayne<br/>\n&gt; &gt; started<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out saying &quot;Warriors suck...&quot;  and continued to degrade the class from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there.  He happened to use a cleric to back up his points on why<br/>\nwarriors<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sucked.  I felt it was my duty to defend a class that I put hard work<br/>\ninto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and, I might add, I play QUITE well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know that he was trashing the warrior class, i however am not trashing<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; class at all<br/>\n&gt; I have played a warrior, probably longer than you ( not that it matters)<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; have found a class<br/>\n&gt; that i prefer and was stating the differences between them. And yes i can<br/>\n&gt; believe you when you<br/>\n&gt; say that you play the class quite well because i for one felt i played it<br/>\n&gt; very good as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That all depends on the player once again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Comparing warriors to clerics is like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; comparing apples to oranges, there is no comparison.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, if you cant compare two classes then what can you compare? There<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; always be comparison.<br/>\n&gt; And believe it or not probably the only few classes you COULD compare<br/>\nwould<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; wars vs clerics<br/>\n&gt; wars vs pallys<br/>\n&gt; wars vs SKs<br/>\n&gt; wars vs monks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Oh yeah and John, you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; DID say that you can take as well as a warrior....here is your exact<br/>\n&gt; &gt; words.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My cleric can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; take just as good as a warrior, my ac is damn high and my buffs add to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You might have meant &#39;tank&#39; and fat fingered, but in the context that<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; &gt; presented there it does seem like you were saying your cleric can take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (damage) as good as a warrior.  Even if you said tank I still would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disagree<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I did happen to have a typo there, it happens sometimes. Its not feasible<br/>\n&gt; for me to state i can take as much<br/>\n&gt; damage as a warrior can take, but i can TANK as good as them. i can dodge,<br/>\n&gt; (quite often surprisingly) and my ac<br/>\n&gt; isnt anything to skoff at. My ac is the same as any warrior of my level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And I don&#39;t think anyone is reading this list because they moved to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; another<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh well, their loss i guess.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Zwanenburg, John[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reply To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 13, 1999 12:47 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [warriors_eq] Why I don&#39;t play a Warrior<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Zwanenburg, John&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jynxx,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gee did we hit a nerve there or what?

Even tho we are talking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; clerics AND warriors, we are discussing something!!! Isnt that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; point?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh and Brian jones, i didnt say that I could take as much damage, i<br/>\nsaid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could tank just as well. My cleric isnt skimping out on HP but he isnt<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; troll warrior. I ususally tank for my group.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh and Jynxx, Ive taken damage from level 30ish mobs with both my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warrior<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and cleric and yeah i can last.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If your pissed, flame me back, i couldnt care less. If you dont want<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; discuss this then fine. That doesnt bother me either, but this is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; discussion board and yes our topic right now does include warriors. Oh<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one last time for the record.

Blah blah blah....who cares? This is a board for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WARRIORS, not clerics. I am sorry if I am offending anyone by saying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but please keep your cleric opinions to yourselves. If I wanted to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hear<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about the virtues of playing a cleric vs. playing a warrior I would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; joined a cleric board. Last time I looked the list was called<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Warriors_eq&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and had nothing to do with Clerics. If you have fun playing a cleric<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there, be down...have all the fun you want. Just don&#39;t tell me that<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do anything because I am a warrior because even with all your heals<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t be half as vital in a group as I am. Without a warrior to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; save<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arse from getting hit by that 31st level mob you&#39;d be dead in 7<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seconds<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flat...well maybe 10 if you got a heal in there. Bottom line: Don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; come<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my board telling me I suck, cause it&#39;s gonna tick me (and a lot of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GOOD warriors) off really bad.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tyveris,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blue Samurai of the Butterfly Rank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Clancy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcashio3@...\">tcashio3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 13, 1999 10:39 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Why I don&#39;t play a Warrior<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Clancy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcashio3@...\">tcashio3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Umm...  whoever says this about clerics is stupid as hell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At lvl 31 I group consistantly with a cleric.  This class is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; amazing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you think all they do is heal, you are very very wrong.
