It&#39;s not recommended anyone under 46 go in against Nagafen though.<br/>\nFigure at 42, even with high saves, you will spend most of your time running<br/>\naway from him or dead from his breath. Every level over 46  is  roughly<br/>\nequivilent to +10 on the saves. Levels and proper classes are most of the<br/>\ntactics needed on Nagafen/Vox. You want higher level people there so you<br/>\nhave fewer people which equals less lag. You need high numbers of warriors,<br/>\nclerics, and wizards for a succesful kill. 6-8 warriors, same on wizards, 2<br/>\nclerics for each tank group (and hopefully a bard) one for each other group,<br/>\nand one or two each on enchanters and shamans for buffs.
