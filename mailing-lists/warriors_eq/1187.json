As a player who runs both a warrior (level 8)<br/>\nand a cleric (level 12) I see advantages in both classes. First and<br/>\nforemost, there are a LOT of critters that resist root. And if your<br/>\ngroup is targeting creatures above the spell cap (ie, 6 levels or more<br/>\nabove you) they will automatically resist root or ensnare or whatever<br/>\nspell you are using. And when root fails, you are praying for a tank to<br/>\ntake some of the abuse else you are toast.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those sports fans, a football analogy I think works best. Warriors,<br/>\nPaladins, and Monks (and perhaps some of the other hybrid melee classes<br/>\nbut I prefer to use the 3 mentioned) are like offensive lineman. They<br/>\nare engaging the creature to let the other offensive players do their<br/>\nwork. A caster can&#39;t cast if he&#39;s being pounded on, plain and simple.<br/>\n*Sometimes* channel MIGHT let you get a spell of but more often than<br/>\nnot they need to be disengaged. So the tank is critical to<br/>\naccomplishing this. The benefits are two-fold. First the tank is doing<br/>\nsome decent damage on his own, keeping the critters attention and the<br/>\ncasters are unleashing their power trying to get the guy down in the<br/>\nmost efficient manner possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point being, all of these classes have value in a group. Group<br/>\nbeing the operative word. Warriors are designed to be able to handle a<br/>\ngreat deal of abuse in a melee. I seriously doubt any high level<br/>\nplayers will tell you that tanks are of no value. Without them, the<br/>\nrest of the members of the group have a much harder time doing their<br/>\njob.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the point about the cleric being able to take on whites vs blue I<br/>\nfind to be absolutely false. Clerics don&#39;t have the offensive power or<br/>\nmana to play the root n shoot game. *Maybe* against some undead but<br/>\nagain root is an unstable spell. Maybe my opinion on that will change<br/>\nonce I advance in levels but that&#39;s how I see it for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nDasan, level 7 barbarian Warrior<br/>\nBristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n--- mark mark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:markerob@...\">markerob@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: mark mark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:markerob@...\">markerob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I believe that warriors are necessary in a group<br/>\n&gt; only to the high teen-low <br/>\n&gt; twenties.  When most hybrid-magic user classes get<br/>\n&gt; to that level they can <br/>\n&gt; either root, or get a pet that will engage the<br/>\n&gt; creature while he or she <br/>\n&gt; casts (wherein they usually don&#39;t need long because<br/>\n&gt; they deal out the most <br/>\n&gt; damage).  I am a lev 17 warrior and blue cons can<br/>\n&gt; take me down to 1/3 hp, it <br/>\n&gt; then takes me a half hour to heal back up.  While I<br/>\n&gt; have a cleric who is <br/>\n&gt; taking on white cons with little problem.  I have to<br/>\n&gt; agree that warriors are <br/>\n&gt; necessary, but only to the level before casters come<br/>\n&gt; into their own. And fyi <br/>\n&gt; I have a fellow mate who is a level 18 wiz with all<br/>\n&gt; his points put into int <br/>\n&gt; and he has only 100 less hp than I have. Another<br/>\n&gt; overlooked characteristic <br/>\n&gt; is that casters can hit magic only creatures from<br/>\n&gt; the begining, while <br/>\n&gt; warriors have to run around for weeks trying to save<br/>\n&gt; up the money for a <br/>\n&gt; special weapon (wich are way overpriced), and most<br/>\n&gt; of the time we end up <br/>\n&gt; running from green con&#39;s because we can&#39;t hit them. <br/>\n&gt; I only use my warrior <br/>\n&gt; now to get money and equipment for other characters<br/>\n&gt; and roleplay.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Arathorne, Solsek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
