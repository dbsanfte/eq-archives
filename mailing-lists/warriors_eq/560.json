I will admit that when I started I was focused<br/>\n&gt; on dual wield...I realized my mistake  at 12th level but by that<br/>\n&gt; time it was<br/>\n&gt; to late to work on my 2 handed slashing skill.  My ranger<br/>\n&gt; alternates between<br/>\n&gt; a fine steel 2 handed sword and a mino axe/shiny brass shield combo.  I am<br/>\n&gt; keeping both skills maxxed at every level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My opinion on the 1hs vs 2hs is this.  Warriors need both.  For blue mobs<br/>\n&gt; the only way to fly is 2 handed with double attack at higher levels.  You<br/>\n&gt; hit very often for high damage, and with double attack you are a<br/>\n&gt; devastating<br/>\n&gt; hack&#39;n&#39;slash machine.  For higher level mobs that con yellow or red, the 1<br/>\n&gt; handed weapons shine because of their speed.  You are not going<br/>\n&gt; to hit high<br/>\n&gt; level mobs as much, so having 50% more swings gives you a better chance to<br/>\n&gt; do damage, even if you do less damage...some is better than none.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed, 2hs is for weaker creatures.  More damage gives them less time to<br/>\nrun because you knock them to death faster in larger chunks.  And as for the<br/>\nduel weild on higher level mobs, completely right again.  I find that 2hs is<br/>\nworthless at my stage of ability against higher level mobs.  And that using<br/>\nthe duel weild and double attack is much more effective.  Especially against<br/>\nany casting type of enemy.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am interested to hear others opinions on this.  And what do you think of<br/>\n&gt; trying to get my 2hs skill of 14 up to 80 on my 15th level DE warrior?<br/>\n&gt; Worth working on?  Or will I have a hard time increasing skill?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I didnt even start training or using my 2hs until level 25.  I am at level<br/>\n27 now, and my 2hs is at 90.  I still have to get it up a long long ways<br/>\nuntil its worth using most of the time.  I have been grouping with people I<br/>\nknow can eliminate anything I draw to them without much help from me.  This<br/>\nallows me to use the hell out of my 2hs, so I might have a slight advantage<br/>\nas far as training it is concerned.  It seems to gain skill levels alot<br/>\nfaster using it against yellows and reds than against whites and blues.<br/>\n<br/>\nDyvim Kincaid<br/>\nStormriders of Cazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: David Rogers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:derogers334@...\">derogers334@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Monday, May 24, 1999 1:59 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Rangers and warriors<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: David Rogers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:derogers334@...\">derogers334@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--- Jason Coan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Paladin.....they ARE a joke, their healing ability<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is a joke, their buffing ability is a joke, because<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; their heals and buffs are 9 levels behind, the only<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thing they have going for them is their lay hands,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; which can be very good, but I dont&#39; think it makes<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; up for their lack of melee ability.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Uh ... ok.  If you say so.  I call Paladins &#39;self-filling tanks&#39;,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;because they are just that.  They&#39;re not really effective until they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;get Meditate at 12th, but once there they can do a solo fight that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;drags them down to 1 bar of HP; and be back in another fight in 7-10<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mins.  For a corresponding warrior, it would be 13-18 mins, or more.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Lay On Hands is the Panic Button; you can push it to get out of jail,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;or at least, have more time to either finish off the mob or run for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;safety.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;As for the spells being 9 levels behind, so?  Paladins are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fighter/healers, while Clerics are healer/fighters.  Clerics can be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mini-tanks up until about 9th or 10th; but Paladins can tank all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;way to 50.  The ability to tank and still have a reserve to compliment<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the party&#39;s cleric is useful.  Past 10th, Clerics are 80%+ casters for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;all realistic intents and purposes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Paladins don&#39;t get Kick; but at 6th they get bash which I personally<br/>\n&gt; &gt;like much better.  Kick won&#39;t interrupt casting, while Bash will.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;stopped using Kick with my Troll Warrior when I got Bash (which let my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Slam start being much more effective)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;If you&#39;re fixated on Dual Wield (which I think you might be, since you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mentioned Rangers; and they&#39;re the only hybrid, that I recall, that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;gets Dual Wield); that might explain why you like Warriors and Rangers<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the most.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Personally, I think the jury&#39;s still out on Dual Wield, and on melee in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;general.  The further up you go, the more the offensive and debuff<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spellcasters really carry the fight to the mobs; the tanks are just<br/>\n&gt; &gt;there to do what their name says.  If this is proven out, then Dueal<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Wield or no, the tanks are just there to soak damage.  If this is not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;proven, then Dual Wield still has to debate against the endless fighter<br/>\n&gt; &gt;arguements of Dual Wield vs 2H Weapons (which is one of those semantic<br/>\n&gt; &gt;arguements, IMO; stats bear each out)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;For grouping, I&#39;d prefer to have pure tank in the tank slot, any day of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the week; with a Paladin fighting alongside him.  (my ideal 6man group<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is 2 Warriors, 1 Paladin, 1 Cleric, 1 Wizard, 1 Bard; haven&#39;t assembled<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it yet, but it sounds fun!) For soloing, however, the Paladin is more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;efficient than the Warrior.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;===<br/>\n&gt; &gt;:D<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;believe it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;First Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n&gt; &gt;_____________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Free instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ONElist:  bringing the world together.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; How many communities do you think join ONElist each day?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; More than 1,000!
