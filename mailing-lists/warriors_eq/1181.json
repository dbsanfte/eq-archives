Grouped (16s-19s) with only 1 tank (me),<br/>\ntwo clerics, two wizards and one shaman, we could<br/>\n*not* take Skeleton Monks or Barbed Bone Skeletons<br/>\nbecause the Wizards were dead weight then (resists),<br/>\nthe Clerics didn&#39;t have enough healing to keep me up,<br/>\nand I didn&#39;t have the firepower alone to take them<br/>\ndown before everyone was OOM and it was still at half<br/>\nlife, laughing at us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who think they can hunt without tanks are right,<br/>\nif they&#39;re willing to *only* hunt blues and whites. <br/>\nIf they want to hunt &#39;up level&#39; from themselves, in<br/>\nyellows and reds, they have to have tanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy prefered party always has three tanks, period.  My<br/>\nmost fun ripping and shredding party would be four<br/>\ntanks and two clerics (but my friend&#39;s a wizard, and I<br/>\ncan&#39;t just throw him away like that).  But with three<br/>\ntanks and a pair of clerics, you can use the 6th slot<br/>\nas a wildcard to fill with a bard or wizard or<br/>\nwhatever.  Enchanters go especially well, their<br/>\ndebuffs make fights a lot easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
