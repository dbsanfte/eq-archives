For those of you who ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-490547752\">Hey gang,<br/>\n<br/>\nI just thought id let you know that when the new race war sever comes up<br/>\nmyself and a very good friend are starting a guild. For those of you who<br/>\ndont know the race war server is sort of like the PvP server Rallos Zek but<br/>\nyou cant just walk up and kill anyone. The Races are divided into teams  and<br/>\nonly other teams can kill you. This is how the teams are made up so far:<br/>\nTrolls, Ogres, Dark Elves (Probably Lizard Men too when they get added)<br/>\nBarbarians, Humans, Erudites,<br/>\nWood Elves, High Elves, Half Elves.<br/>\nDwarves, Gnomes, Halflings.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow this is going to be way better than Rallos zek cause you wont have some<br/>\nperson of your own race killing you. makes more sense this way.<br/>\nThe guild we are going to start is going to be called The Dark and is only<br/>\ngoing to be made up of the team of Trolls, Ogres, and Dark Elves. This Guild<br/>\nwill attempt to bring misery and pain to those who follow the light. Both my<br/>\nfriend and i are roleplayers and enjoy the feeling of playing the bad guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo right now i am asking you if anyone wants to join us when the new server<br/>\ncomes out. We can always use Warriors, but we are also looking for other<br/>\nclasses too they are: Shamans, Rogues, Enchanters, Clerics In particular. I<br/>\nam starting a Necro to be the Guild leader and My friend as Co leader will<br/>\nbe a wizard. We would like to get as many people as possible and if you want<br/>\nto be a warrior thats fine! Heck thats GREAT! We just need people.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want more info on our guild or want to inquire about joining email me<br/>\nat <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a> during the week or <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zbitnew@...\">zbitnew@...</a> during the<br/>\nweekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks guys and i hope you all join me!<br/>\n<br/>\nLothaniel/Rayne T&#39;kazz<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tBilly Barnett[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sigurd@...\">sigurd@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tWednesday, June 16, 1999 6:35 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] You want to know how weak warriors!

I was a 12th warrior at the time with two rangers<br/>\n&gt; and a<br/>\n&gt; cleric if I remeber correctly and the three tanks coundn&#39;t outdamage that<br/>\n&gt; 13th<br/>\n&gt; druid. It wasn&#39;t until the cleric starting using expulse undead that we<br/>\n&gt; ever got<br/>\n&gt; experience. There may have been an undocumented fix in a patch since, but<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; that experience I believe that the experience went to the single PC that<br/>\n&gt; did the<br/>\n&gt; most damage not the group.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just my 2cp. Hope it helps,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Surtur<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PS. I still haven&#39;t gotten a response on where to look for guild links for<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci.<br/>\n&gt; Please email me with info if you have it please.

Thats<br/>\n&gt; why,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really, only higher level wizards can steal kill.
