We have looked forever trying to find the spell<br/>\n&gt; to enchant<br/>\n&gt; ore but can&#39;t.  I&#39;m sure you guys can understand the importance<br/>\n&gt; of magical<br/>\n&gt; armor.  Anyway we want to make it to sell cheap to other players.<br/>\n&gt;  If anyone<br/>\n&gt; has played around with this or knows anything about it please tell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Arathorne,  Solsek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With more than 20 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ...ONElist is home to the liveliest discussions on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
