Ive been to qeynos and i must say that that area has spots for<br/>\ncash, or spots for exp, but its hard to find one with both. Being level 9 it<br/>\nwould be good to group with another level 9 char and go to the sewers, as<br/>\nthere is lots of smugglers and thugs there. Good exp and so so cash. To be<br/>\nhonest im not partial to BB at all...actually i think its a rather poor<br/>\ndungeon compared to all others i have seen ( befallen, Najena being the<br/>\nbest.) wait till you are level 12 or so then go for Gnoll Guardsmen and the<br/>\noccasional Elite. that will be nice exp, dont know about cash. Then when you<br/>\nhit level 14 or so go up to the everfrost and permafrost zones, go hunt ice<br/>\ngoblins in a group of 3 people. Its amazing for loot and for exp trust me on<br/>\nthis one. If you are up for adventuring, make your way across the Continent<br/>\nand head for the Freeport areas, lots of good places for both loot and EXP<br/>\nhere. Such as The desert of Ro, Befallen, West commons, many orc camps and<br/>\nDirvish camps all throught those areas. Give it a try!<br/>\n<br/>\nLothaniel T&#39;Kazz<br/>\nJohn Zwanenburg<br/>\nTips Support/Support Sipt<br/>\nTel: (613) 998-2745</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
