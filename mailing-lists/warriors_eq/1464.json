Trade deathfist slashed belts to the captain of the freeport militia. He can be found on the porch in the back of the militia house in east freeport.  Downside to this is that it lowers faction with the knights of truth paladins.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is another npc who takes the orc belts in the warrior guild in freeport.  Not sure of the faction adjustments when you trade them to him, but I do know that there is no negative faction adjustment.  I am pretty sure he adjusts merchant faction, but give it a try to be sure.  I think that it is more beneficial to trade 4 belts at once instead of one at a time.  Maybe someone else can clarify this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nBael<br/>\nTier&#39;dal warrrior of the 17th level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: jason &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:spawn56@...\">spawn56@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Wednesday, July 14, 1999 1:59 AM<br/>\n    Subject: [warriors_eq]Freeport Vendor Faction<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    I recently killedd a few human pcs in the Freeport arena and was wondering if there was anything i could do to raise faction with the Coalition of Trade Folk (freeport vendors) I am starting to run low on milk and haven&#39;t found anything that raises faction with the Trade Folk.
