You may know the answer regardless.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have come into possession of a blade mold.  This item should be used with the smithing skill to make a sword of some kind.  Does anyone know what other components are needed? What the recipe for creating the sword is? What is the smithing skill required for success?  I myself am not a smith, but I know quite a few trustworthy ones on Bertox. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone is interested I will post the total solution to the blade mold quest when I complete it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
