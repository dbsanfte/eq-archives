None of my members are below 18th level, so it&#39;s not bad twinking, we just want a piece of the pie and camping an area is the only way to do it.  If you want a specific item and can&#39;t find buddies to help you camp, raise money and buy it.  Logistically, raising enough money for a item takes just as much time, plus you get xp.  That&#39;s how a player driven economy works.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sorry, but i think that&#39;s bullshit.  Show me where i can make 125pp, or<br/>\nwhatever the going rate for a tomahawk, in 3hrs or whenever he spawns. I&#39;m<br/>\nlevel 20 and usually fight in halfway decent cash areas, but between the<br/>\ngroup, in 3 hours, we usually make only about 8 to 10 plat each. Get your<br/>\nguild OUT of the area and go hunt in dungeons and do shit like you&#39;re<br/>\nsupposed to do. I&#39;m in the Bloodstone Templars, on the Solusek Ro server,<br/>\nand we do not camp shit for our lower members.  If we find anyone<br/>\npartaking in such dishonorable activities, they risk getting kicked from<br/>\nthe guild. We DO, however, enjoy going together as a group to obtain the<br/>\nitems and move on. Why can&#39;t your guild be noble and do the same? <br/>\n<br/>\nNick<br/>\n<br/>\nFrizzan Z`ress (Bloodstone Templars)<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\nIngido Brotherhood Twentieth Level</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
