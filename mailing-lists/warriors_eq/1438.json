The inital post made by Wayne<br/>\n&gt; started<br/>\n&gt; out saying &quot;Warriors suck...&quot;  and continued to degrade the class from<br/>\n&gt; there.  He happened to use a cleric to back up his points on why warriors<br/>\n&gt; sucked.  I felt it was my duty to defend a class that I put hard work into<br/>\n&gt; and, I might add, I play QUITE well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know that he was trashing the warrior class, i however am not trashing the<br/>\nclass at all<br/>\nI have played a warrior, probably longer than you ( not that it matters) and<br/>\nhave found a class<br/>\nthat i prefer and was stating the differences between them. And yes i can<br/>\nbelieve you when you <br/>\nsay that you play the class quite well because i for one felt i played it<br/>\nvery good as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all depends on the player once again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Comparing warriors to clerics is like<br/>\n&gt; comparing apples to oranges, there is no comparison.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, if you cant compare two classes then what can you compare? There will<br/>\nalways be comparison.<br/>\nAnd believe it or not probably the only few classes you COULD compare would<br/>\nbe<br/>\nwars vs clerics<br/>\nwars vs pallys<br/>\nwars vs SKs<br/>\nwars vs monks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Oh yeah and John, you<br/>\n&gt; DID say that you can take as well as a warrior....here is your exact<br/>\n&gt; words. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; My cleric can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; take just as good as a warrior, my ac is damn high and my buffs add to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; You might have meant &#39;tank&#39; and fat fingered, but in the context that you<br/>\n&gt; presented there it does seem like you were saying your cleric can take<br/>\n&gt; (damage) as good as a warrior.  Even if you said tank I still would<br/>\n&gt; disagree<br/>\n&gt; with you.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I did happen to have a typo there, it happens sometimes. Its not feasible<br/>\nfor me to state i can take as much<br/>\ndamage as a warrior can take, but i can TANK as good as them. i can dodge,<br/>\n(quite often surprisingly) and my ac<br/>\nisnt anything to skoff at.

Last time i checked the amount of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people actually using this board was less than 5. And yeah i know its a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warriors discussion board but oh whats this? Even tho we are talking<br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; clerics AND warriors, we are discussing something!!! Isnt that the<br/>\n&gt; point?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Oh and Brian jones, i didnt say that I could take as much damage, i said<br/>\n&gt; i<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could tank just as well. My cleric isnt skimping out on HP but he isnt a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; troll warrior. I ususally tank for my group. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Oh and Jynxx, Ive taken damage from level 30ish mobs with both my<br/>\n&gt; warrior<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and cleric and yeah i can last.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If your pissed, flame me back, i couldnt care less. If you dont want to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; discuss this then fine. That doesnt bother me either, but this is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; discussion board and yes our topic right now does include warriors. Oh<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one last time for the record. My cleric is far better than my warrior<br/>\n&gt; ever<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; (BTW: My warrior is level 43 and my cleric is level 34)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rayne<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: \tJynxx[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jynxx@...\">jynxx@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: \tTuesday, July 13, 1999 1:21 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Why I don&#39;t play a Warrior<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jynxx&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jynxx@...\">jynxx@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok...clerics heal. Blah blah blah....who cares? This is a board for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; WARRIORS, not clerics. I am sorry if I am offending anyone by saying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but please keep your cleric opinions to yourselves. If I wanted to<br/>\n&gt; hear<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about the virtues of playing a cleric vs. playing a warrior I would<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; joined a cleric board. Last time I looked the list was called<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Warriors_eq&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and had nothing to do with Clerics. If you have fun playing a cleric<br/>\n&gt; out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there, be down...have all the fun you want. Just don&#39;t tell me that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do anything because I am a warrior because even with all your heals<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t be half as vital in a group as I am. Without a warrior to<br/>\n&gt; save<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; arse from getting hit by that 31st level mob you&#39;d be dead in 7<br/>\n&gt; seconds<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; flat...well maybe 10 if you got a heal in there. Bottom line: Don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; come<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my board telling me I suck, cause it&#39;s gonna tick me (and a lot of<br/>\n&gt; other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; GOOD warriors) off really bad.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tyveris,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blue Samurai of the Butterfly Rank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Clancy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcashio3@...\">tcashio3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 13, 1999 10:39 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Why I don&#39;t play a Warrior<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Clancy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcashio3@...\">tcashio3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Umm...  whoever says this about clerics is stupid as hell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At lvl 31 I group consistantly with a cleric.  This class is<br/>\n&gt; amazing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you think all they do is heal, you are very very wrong.  Their dd&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stun<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (amazing for rogues) and they can heal better than any other class.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; want<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to see your two druids heal you to full from 1 bar of life<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also if all you fight is yellows and reds you need to rethink your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; leveling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; process.  Whites and blues are excellent to fight if you are in<br/>\n&gt; groups<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; handle large numbers well.  Before you say all clerics do is heal,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; play<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or play with a good one.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.
