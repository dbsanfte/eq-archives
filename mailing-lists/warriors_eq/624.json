At level 50 I believe a warrior could wipe the floor with a ranger,<br/>\nespecially a warrior who has some fast weapons for high interrupts or a big<br/>\nbash/slam skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference is not evident until much higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, how many wood elf rangers are there? 100? 200? 400? there as common as<br/>\ndirt, and I bet you now a wizard would MUCH prefer a warrior to a ranger as<br/>\na partner.  Warriors are MUCH more valuable to a party than a ranger in a<br/>\ndungeon for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Faydar is a whole, and Faydark is the worst of the worst places on<br/>\nnorrath. My suggestion is play the class that suites your personality,<br/>\notherwise you will get bored.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tTom Swift[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, May 25, 1999 1:26 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Rangers and warriors<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This past week I decided to take a break from my level 15 dark elf<br/>\n&gt; warrior.� I was abit frustrated.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; I started a half-elf warrior in Kelethin.� It is insanely easy to play<br/>\n&gt; there.� I made level 5 in about 3.5 hours.� Then I stopped and tried a<br/>\n&gt; wood elf ranger.� Has anyone else played a ranger?� I imagine it is the<br/>\n&gt; most poorly balanced of all the hybrids.� After 4 hours I reached level 5<br/>\n&gt; and got kick.� I am now 12-18 hours into the character and almost level<br/>\n&gt; 9.� I am just as capable as an equivalent warrior.� Next level I gain an<br/>\n&gt; array of spells which will boost my combat effectiveness and allow me to<br/>\n&gt; heal.� Part of the easy success is the plethora of low level orcs<br/>\n&gt; available a stone&#39;s throw from Kelethin.� With my tracking ability I am<br/>\n&gt; never at a loss for targets and I can engage blue con orcs in rapid<br/>\n&gt; succession or even 2 at a time. I can even engage and successfully beat<br/>\n&gt; yellow con orcs more than 50% of the time and almost always can kill orcs<br/>\n&gt; that con even to me without trouble. So far it seems that I get as many<br/>\n&gt; hit points now as my warrior did.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; My point is, with a ranger class as powerful a combatant as it is I see<br/>\n&gt; little necessity for the pure warrior.� I am going to play through to<br/>\n&gt; level 15 I think, just to see a more even comparison.� My concern is only<br/>\n&gt; from a game mechanics perspective though as I have no doubt my playing as<br/>\n&gt; a dark elf was a much more rewarding experience.� Has anyone else noticed<br/>\n&gt; that the warrior just is not different enough from the hybrid fighter<br/>\n&gt; classes?<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Bael��������������������������������������������������� Aelyn<br/>\n&gt; Warrior of the 15th Order����� or������������� Ranger of the 8th Rank<br/>\n&gt; Indigo Brotherhood������������������������������� Humble Servant of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; still undecided<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
