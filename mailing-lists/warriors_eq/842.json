Sorry that you&#39;re a loner.  My guild needs to be equipped too you know.   None of my members are below 18th level, so it&#39;s not bad twinking, we just want a piece of the pie and camping an area is the only way to do it.  If you want a specific item and can&#39;t find buddies to help you camp, raise money and buy it.  Logistically, raising enough money for a item takes just as much time, plus you get xp.  That&#39;s how a player driven economy works.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW<br/>\n<br/>\nOdhinn MacDoughl<br/>\nSkald, Hand Of Tyr<br/>\n23rd level Barbarian Warrior<br/>\nMaster, Alcohol Tolerance</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
