The lower lvl char is getting 20/44 =<br/>\n&gt; 45.5% of the exp, the higher char 24/44 = 54.5%.<br/>\n&gt; In the second case, a lvl 6 with a lvl 10 we get:<br/>\n&gt; 6/16 = 37.5% for the lower lvl char and 10/16 = 62.5%<br/>\n&gt; for the higher lvl char So if you look at these<br/>\n&gt; numers it makes a LOT of sense that the difference<br/>\n&gt; in levels isn&#39;t as significant as you get into the<br/>\n&gt; mid 20&#39;s and higher.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, that makes perfect sense; I hadn&#39;t sat down to work out the<br/>\nmath like that, but now that you present it to me, I find it logical<br/>\nand correct.
