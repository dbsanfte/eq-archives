You may recall that I had started a ranger about 3 weeks<br/>\n&gt; ago.  I have been playing with that character more than my warrior because<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; wanted to compare capabilities at the same level.  My ranger uses a 2<br/>\n&gt; handed<br/>\n&gt; dwarven axe (great weapon by the way, 14 damage 43 delay), and sometimes a<br/>\n&gt; 1<br/>\n&gt; handed dwarven axe.  He is at level 15.  I can solo any blue, many yellows<br/>\n&gt; and i have even soloed a few red orc slavers.  In comparison my warrior,<br/>\n&gt; level 16 is beaten to the point of 10 minute resting after a fight by most<br/>\n&gt; blues. He runs from anything that is yellow or red.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In a group the ranger meets all the same party needs as a warrior plus<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; provides his own healing and buffing.  My 16th level warrior is about to<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; a fine steel 2 handed sword and work up his 2hs skill to a comparable<br/>\n&gt; level<br/>\n&gt; as the ranger.  We will see how that goes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The warrior formerly known as Bael<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now one of those weenie wood elf rangers, Aelyn.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
