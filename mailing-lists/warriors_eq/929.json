So you finallygot yerself a Tommy eh?<br/>\n&gt; Good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stuff, great weapon. So where abouts are you fighting now? You gonna be<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; IRC at all today?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve actually been waiting on getting the armor from you before i fought<br/>\n&gt; anymore hehe. I&#39;m camped outside of Neriak with Frizzan, and started<br/>\n&gt; character number 3. A dark elf wizzie named Veldrin. I gave him my old old<br/>\n&gt; runed totem staff which i used with my druid before killing LJ to get the<br/>\n&gt; Crooked Staff. That in combinaion with the Theourmatgist&#39;s Robe (dunno how<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s spelled) and i&#39;m going pretty good. Those of you who have tried<br/>\n&gt; wizards know how much you die :)  I&#39;m level 6, almost 7, in 16 hours.<br/>\n&gt; Going good. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; About IRC, nope.. There&#39;s too much to do in the office today for me to<br/>\n&gt; even sneak on :(  I will be on eq from 6pm to 10 or 10:30pm eastern<br/>\n&gt; tonight for sure tho.  Hopefully we can get together and roleplay some ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Talk to ya soon,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nick<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What was YOUR favorite part?!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Tell other Star Wars fans at ONElist!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
