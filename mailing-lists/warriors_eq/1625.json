This is the &quot;hotkey&quot;<br/>\nbox.  Initially, hotkeys default to the numbers 1-6 on your keyboard, but<br/>\nyou can reconfigure that through the options settings.  Songs, spells, the<br/>\nspellbook, socials, and inventory boxes can all be made &quot;hotkeys&quot;. To create<br/>\na &quot;hotkey&quot;, LEFT click on the box/spell/icon you want and HOLD it down.<br/>\nAfter a second, the box will magically &quot;lift up&quot; and attach itself to your<br/>\npointer.  Simply &quot;drop&quot; the new box onto the appropriate hotkey slot, and<br/>\nblammo! Instant hotkey.  Now, whenever you press the associated hotkey<br/>\nbutton, you will activate the song/spell or action in that slot.  Inventory<br/>\nboxes do NOT &quot;activate&quot;, putting them in your hotkey bank is simply to avoid<br/>\nhaving to open your inventory to swap items in combat.<br/>\nQ: Why would I want to swap items in combat?!<br/>\nA: Well, not just in combat, but by placing inventory slots (General<br/>\ninventory slots, or worn/wielded slots will work.  Bag slots will NOT) into<br/>\nyour hotkey bank, you can grab (for example) your sword and swap it with an<br/>\ninstrument in order to heal faster, run faster or whatever.  PRACTICE THIS<br/>\nMANEUVER!!!  You *WILL* drop your weapon or instrument at least once, and<br/>\nmore likely several times, so practice practice practice!  And if you *do*<br/>\naccidentally drop something, don&#39;t panic, just back up, grab the item and<br/>\nrun like crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me try to add - what you want on a hot key palette - you have 6 that you<br/>\ncan select by shift-1, shift-2, etc. - is your weapon slots 1 and 2 and 2<br/>\nmain inventory slots.  To get them there, bag your weps, open inventory so<br/>\nyou can see main slots, right click and hold on an empty main slot - it<br/>\nshould &quot;pop loose&quot; so you have it on your cursor.  Key shift-1 to bring up<br/>\nyour hot key pallette and drop the inv slot onto the place on the pallette<br/>\nwhere you want it.  Do this for 3 main inv slots and your melee wep 1 and<br/>\nmelee wep 2 slots.  So you should have:<br/>\n<br/>\n[inv slot1]   [melee 1]<br/>\n[inv slot 2]  [melee 2]<br/>\n[inv slot 3]  [            ]<br/>\n[              ]  [            ]<br/>\n[              ]  [            ]<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you can put weps in your slots: 2hs in melee1, 1hs in inv 1, 1hb in inv<br/>\n2. To switch, click on 2hs - click on 1hs - click on melee1 - click on 1hb -<br/>\nclick on melee 2.  And you can figure out how to reverse process.  TIP: look<br/>\nat the mouse pointer - not the wep - place tip of mouse pointer in center of<br/>\nboxes before clicking.  Practice with some rustys or some fs crap weps<br/>\nbefore swapping your BIBS, Yaks and Waks ;p<br/>\n<br/>\nSnyak <br/>\nWarrior of the 13th Level<br/>\nQeynos, Antonica 53226 visiting Freeport<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n&quot;The opinions expressed herein are my own and do not <br/>\nnecessarily reflect those of my Guild Master nor my Deity.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 37th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tTrent Carroll [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trent@...\">trent@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, November 30, 1999 1:09 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[warriors_eq] making hotkeys<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Trent Carroll&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trent@...\">trent@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tYou can make a hotkey out of just about anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tYou can not make a hot key out of a weapon, but you can make<br/>\na hot key out<br/>\n\t\tof a backpack slot.  You must then, always keep your weapons<br/>\nin this<br/>\n\t\tspecific slot.  I had my first experiment with this using a<br/>\nbard character a<br/>\n\t\tfew days back.  hotkeyed a backpack slot and my Melee1 and<br/>\nMelee2 slots.<br/>\n\t\tIt&#39;s works pretty well.  Sometimes looting can cause a minor<br/>\nproblem though.<br/>\n\t\tMost of the time it&#39;s OK though.  These don&#39;t act like<br/>\nregular hot keys,<br/>\n\t\twhere you can just click 3 or 4 to make them work.  They act<br/>\nlike inventory<br/>\n\t\tslots.  You click on a weapon to pick it up, and then drop<br/>\nit in one of your<br/>\n\t\tother &quot;Hot Slots&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHope this helps.  If someone has an even better way that I<br/>\noverlooked I&#39;m<br/>\n\t\tall ears.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t       ~ FREE Games & CA$H Prizes!  ~  $55,000+ Awarded<br/>\nMonthly ~ <br/>\n\t\tWelcome to Gamesville.com-- Home of the World&#39;s Biggest &<br/>\nBest Free Games<br/>\n\t\t  Play Three-Eyed Bingo, Quick-Draw Poker, Pop Quiz &<br/>\nPicturama  FREE! <br/>\n\t\t   &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/gamesville5\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/gamesville5</a><br/>\n&quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n\t\tFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
