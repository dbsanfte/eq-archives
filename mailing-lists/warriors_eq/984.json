This time I got <br/>\na troll shaman to cast SoW on me before I left the oasis and was able to <br/>\neasily get to my body.  Once there I saw the two Trolls who had tried to <br/>\nhelp me when I was jumped by the dry bones skeleton the first time.  They <br/>\nhad been guarding my body, killing dervishes, and just having a good time <br/>\nbeing trolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I talked to the trolls for a bit (their common isn�t that good, one can <br/>\nsee their intelligence isn�t that high).  I learned then that all Trolls are <br/>\nnot that bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I finished getting dressed, cut a slice of bread to feed my hungry <br/>\nstomach, drank some water and off I went.  I decided to run like the wind <br/>\nback to the oasis and kill some crocodiles.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce in the oasis area, I realized I still had three full backpacks dragging <br/>\nme down.  I have sold my stuff at the inn in Oasis before, so I decided to <br/>\nrisk it one more time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI climbed up the hill overlooking the inn and looked around for errant <br/>\ngiants.  Everything looked ok so in I ran to lighten my load.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell anyone reading this can guess the rest.  At least I sold all my extra <br/>\nloot before a sand giant ripped the roof off the inn and slammed his fist <br/>\ninto my head.  I really need to get some giant repellant as soon as I can <br/>\nfind some.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have decided that I hate giants more than griffons, and one day I will <br/>\nlead a hunt to destroy every giant in the world of Norrath!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of Rallos Zek;<br/>\n<br/>\nPatty of Halas<br/>\nusername: Patricia<br/>\nserver: Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
