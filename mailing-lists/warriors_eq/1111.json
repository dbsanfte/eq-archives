It should be a button listed in that menu. Left click and hold<br/>\non it until you &#39;pick it up&#39;. Place it in one of your empty hot slots on the<br/>\nleft side of the screen.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo use it, click on the person you want to use it on (or click on your name to<br/>\nuse it on yourself). Get close to the person. Have bandages in ANY inventory<br/>\nslot. Click on bind wound key.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe better your skill is, the more damage you can heal. However, the biggest<br/>\nlimitation is that you can only heal someone up to half of their hit point<br/>\nlevel. After that, they will have to heal normally. You also will not get<br/>\nsuccess if the person already has over half of their hit points left.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do not have the button listed (which I don&#39;t think is possible. Every<br/>\nwarrior starts with it.) then you will need to train it at least once. If it<br/>\ndoes not go up, try putting two more trains in it until it does &#39;work&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Rosmorte<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmark mark wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: mark mark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:markerob@...\">markerob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; can someone help me out with bind wound,,,, I have put points into it but<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know how to use it.
