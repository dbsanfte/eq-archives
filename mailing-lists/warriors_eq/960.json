No matter<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what time i goto Highpass, there&#39;s always at least one group just sitting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;there waiting for endless hours for the gnoll to spawn.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My question is this:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Does anyone know the anticamp and timing of the gnoll that carries the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;weapon?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Some people don&#39;t believe that there is an anticamp for weapons, and<br/>\n&gt; those<br/>\n&gt; &gt;who don&#39;t, let me give you an example to prove that there is.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;CHITIN SHIELD<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Some talk was going on about getting the chitin shield and that you had<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;kill a giant heart spider to get it, which is located in Guk.  I went to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Guk over four separate occasions for many many hours, each and every time<br/>\n&gt; &gt;being unsuccessful.  One kind person posted a respawn list of what would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;come next, but even that proved to be wrong.  A guildmate of mine and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;had an idea though.  He had recently figured out the anticamp spot and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;timer for getting the BBC and Gossimer robe, so we decided to experiment.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;We did figure it out, and this is how it goes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Kill everything inside the room where the giant heart spider is supposed<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to spawn. DO NOT LOOT ANYTHING UNTIL EVERYTHING IS DEAD.  When everything<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is dead, loot quick, and run out of the room and go behind the corridor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The little hall outside of the room has a darker floor, then there is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lower lighter floor, and another darker one nearer the water. Have your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;party all stand on the darker floor there and wait for 16 minutes after<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the person who looted the giant heart or the large or whatever was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spawned. If you want to give it an extra minute, you can do so.  If<br/>\n&gt; &gt;everyone followed the rules, when you all run in, there should be another<br/>\n&gt; &gt;giant heart spider with the chitin shield again for you. I have tested<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this and successfully done it on three occasions, so it DOES work.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Back to the tomahawk discussion and one more thing.. I don&#39;t know how it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is on all of your servers, but I play on Solusek Ro, and I&#39;m disgusted<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with the players and people on the server.  People charging 100 to over<br/>\n&gt; &gt;200 plat for a rare item.  In beta, an item rarely went over 20 plat, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;if it did, by that time, you were in your mid twenties in level and could<br/>\n&gt; &gt;get it without a problem or could afford to pay for it. I am a level 19<br/>\n&gt; &gt;warrior and also have a level 19 druid, and i do NOT have 100 to 200 plat<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to spend on anything but the things to keep my character advancing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Spells for my druid and armor for my warrior.  Those people who do have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that cash at early levels must have a LOT of time on their hands.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I got my char to almost level 20 in 6 days and 20 some hours.  This isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that spectaular, but i fight to get experience and i fight well. I work<br/>\n&gt; &gt;full time and am also a full time student at a university. I do not have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the time to run around and kill wisps or whatever people with big bank<br/>\n&gt; &gt;accounts do. The reason why i want to share the spawn information with<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;guys is because I hope you will help me in lowering the disgusting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;inflated prices of the game. Give items to players or sell them for<br/>\n&gt; cheap.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;It&#39;s what I and some good members of my guild do.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Thanks for reading and hopefully someone knows the info for the tomahawk.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;d really love to get one or two for my dual wield.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Nick<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Frizzan on Solusek Ro (Bloodstone Templars)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;See homepage for details.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
