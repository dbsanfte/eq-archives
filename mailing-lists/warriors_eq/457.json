This doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll hit, but you get another swing, and I&#39;m assuming your chance to hit is calculated as with any normal swing.  Reposte really kicks when you are wielding a big 2h sword like my BBC :)  Let me give you a couple examples:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1.  In this fight I was wielding my demon claw and my whip, in a good round (I concider a round to be the time between taunts, and an attack is a swing or kick), I had 12 attacks, 2 of which were repostes, 8 of which hit for 12,14,7,6,10,8,13,10, total of 80 points, 10 of those coming from a sucessfull hit with reposte.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2.  In this fight I was wielding my BBC, in a good round I had 6 attacks, 1 of which was a reposte, 4 of those attacks I connected for 13, 42, 38, 27, total of 120 damage, 42 of those coming from a sucessfull hit with reposte.  (note:  due to slow speed of the BBC I usually only get one attack (2 if double), and about every 3 or 4 rounds I get 2 attacks (4 if both doubles) with it, this was one such round)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3.  In this fight I was wielding my BBC, in a good round I had 5 attacks, 2 of which were reposte, 4 of those attacks connected for 10, 41, 27, 26, total of 104, 26 points coming from a sucessfull hit with reposte.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; conclusion:  reposte rocks, anything that gives you extra attacks is a good thing, expecially something that also prevents you from taking damage :)  But it really seems to make a difference when you got a big heavy hitting weapon.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope that helps some<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Salr D&#39;Taynkk<br/>\n&gt; Dark Warrior of The Kith<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ps.  finally finished off my full set of blackend last night, woohoo, I look cool :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slu@...\">slu@...</a>&gt; 5.20.99 8:15:38 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jason, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is consistent with a description I have heard before. I guess by your description (if its based on the principles of fencing in the RW) that it might drive off of successful parries. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Which brings up another question, when you parry do you lose an attack (after all it is your sword that is doing the parrying)? If riposte would be a return off a parry how would this fit into the overall attacks per turn for a high lvl warrior? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One more question, is the riposte damage that people have seen greater than that of their normal weapon? If so this might add all sorts of other cool dynamics to this skill. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If anyone has info to add I&#39;d love to learn more about folks direct experiences with this. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Robert <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------- <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Jason Coan[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:coanj@...\">coanj@...</a>] <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reply To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 18, 1999 2:09 PM <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Riposte Skill <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:coanj@...\">coanj@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reposte is a counter attack you get upon a successful parry, based upon <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; skill. I&#39;ve got it, but I&#39;m not sure if the reposte attack is my damage, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if it actually turns the mobs damage against him....ie, Zealot hits me for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 74, I reposte, do I do 74 points of damage, or the damage that my weapon <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do? <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Salr D&#39;Taynkk <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dark Warrior of The Kith <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Veeshan <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message----- <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Mifsud, Michael [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Mifsud@...\">Michael.Mifsud@...</a>] <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, May 17, 1999 9:56 PM <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Riposte Skill <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Mifsud, Michael&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Mifsud@...\">Michael.Mifsud@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Riposte traditionally is to counterattack after a parry (fencing term). <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GUESS thats what it would be in the game as well... <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jaade, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Indigo Sista Soldier. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------- <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slu@...\">slu@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slu@...\">slu@...</a>] <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reply To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 18, 1999 10:50 AM <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [warriors_eq] Riposte Skill <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slu@...\">slu@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey Folks <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can anyone give a quick run down on the riposte skill?
