If you drink more (with greater tolerance) do you keep getting more str & sta or is there a cap?  If so why bother drinking a ton of booze (especially if you don&#39;t get drunk!)?  Does the lowered int influence the rate you improve skills (I haven&#39;t noticed any difference so far)?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would seem that at high levels this might be handy thing for warriors to have (if you can keep the extra str & sta longer).  Anyone have experience with this?<br/>\n<br/>\nRob Wilbarg aka Flair on Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
