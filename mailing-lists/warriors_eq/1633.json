Also,<br/>\nwe are planning on Raiding Lord Nagafen this weekend, and would really love<br/>\nto have some information from those who have done it before on some of the<br/>\nbest tactics on how to accomplish this.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has some tactics they could pass along on all of these raids, I<br/>\nwould be most grateful.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaks</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
