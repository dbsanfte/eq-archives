But as far as the 2h<br/>\nslashing goes im not that partial to the BBC..IMO its not all that good, the<br/>\nminus really blows ... I just use a combine 2 hander right now, but i dont<br/>\neven use it that much, i much rather the speed and damage i am gettting with<br/>\nmy 2 1h Slashing weapons.

It is wonderful to change camera view just to watch as the<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; two swords fly.  Attack, Attack, Attack, Attack, Bash, Attack, Attack, <br/>\n&gt; Attack, Attack, Attack, Attack, Bash!!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh well, will have to see how good I am with my 2H Sword once I max out<br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; skill.  Like I said it works well now (24 to 25 a hit - with double attack<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; up to 50 per round), but I still think my two longswords rule.  Saving<br/>\n&gt; cash <br/>\n&gt; now to buy a second combine longsword.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One last thing; talking to a 21 level warrior last night, the BBC is to<br/>\n&gt; him <br/>\n&gt; the best weapon he has seen.  Of course it is a 2H weapon, so 2H Slashing<br/>\n&gt; is <br/>\n&gt; important to keep up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is all my opinion as a level 15 Barbarian Warrior Princess.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of Rellos Zek;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Patty of Halas<br/>\n&gt; username: Patricia<br/>\n&gt; server: Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
