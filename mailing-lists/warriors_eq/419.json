Once you cross the bridge you are","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-809362899\">I have done Upper Guk at level 13.  If you have a strong group it is<br/>\npossible...but beware of other parties of solo players.  Once you cross the<br/>\nbridge you are in a &quot;hub&quot; room.  Fleeing creatures will run into a room<br/>\npopulated with Tuk warriors and Gaz warriors.  If you do not follow them<br/>\nthey will come back and sometimes bring these warriors out.  I&#39;ve died in<br/>\nUpper Guk a few times due to the follies of others in the dungeon.  If a PC<br/>\nor froglock blocks the bridge there is no escape from the trains. You will<br/>\ndie deeper inside than you would prefer.  The upside is that most froglocks<br/>\ndo not KOS until you killed a couple dozen and your faction with them is<br/>\nbad.  So you can often walk right down and pick up your stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most dangerous part is the water under the bridge.  Some of the trains<br/>\nwill occassionally drop Ton warriors and Gaz warriors into the water.  I<br/>\nalmost always see one or more there.  If you fall off the bridge into the<br/>\nwater you will very likely die unless you are a good swimmer.  I&#39;d advise<br/>\nusing a mage to draw anything out of the water and kill it before you start<br/>\nhunting across the bridge.  And remember don&#39;t panic!  Falling in the water<br/>\nis only a death sentence if you panic.  If you can&#39;t solo whatever is in<br/>\nthere just swim out and get to dry ground before you die.  It is much easier<br/>\nto get to your corpse<br/>\n if it isn&#39;t in the water.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you see anything fleeing from the entrance over the bridge while<br/>\nyou are hunting on the otherside...kill it.  Doesn&#39;t matter if it is yours<br/>\nor not, if you don&#39;t take the kill it may bring back a train.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm....looking back that all kind of rambles.  It will make more sense when<br/>\nyou actually get to Guk and look around.<br/>\n<br/>\nBael<br/>\n15th Order of the Indigo Brotherhood<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, May 20, 1999 1:04 PM<br/>\nSubject: [warriors_eq] Guk Question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;John can you help me out with this question?<br/>\n&gt;I am about to hit lvl 13 and was thinkin about trying for the chitin<br/>\n </span></blockquote>shield.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I I get together a strong group do we have a shot?<br/>\n&gt;To get to the Spider(s) do you go into the water from the room with the two<br/>\n&gt;frogs that spawn that is close to the entrance?
