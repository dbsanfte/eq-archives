I&#39;ve had an interesting experience while being partied with a<br/>\n&gt; friend<br/>\n&gt; who plays a rogue. Most of the group has problems with the tough mobs and<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; die if it starts attacking the party .... except for the rogue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s an example. While doing the screaming mace quest we were camped in<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; tower of Crushbone waiting for Emperor Crush to arrive. Assured that<br/>\n&gt; Ambassador<br/>\n&gt; Dvinn was at the zone killing newbies, we continued to wait without any<br/>\n&gt; concern.<br/>\n&gt; Suddenly Crush spawns ... no problem, we begin the whacking. Then, about 3<br/>\n&gt; or 4<br/>\n&gt; seconds later, Dvinn spawns. Wham Wham Wham, one down ... etc until 5<br/>\n&gt; party<br/>\n&gt; members were dead, none even made it past the throne.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Except for the rogue who sat there plain as day, probably messing herself<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; the fear. He never touched her, and in fact conned to her as indifferent I<br/>\n&gt; believe. She was able to do corpse retrievals for some of us as we all<br/>\n&gt; waited at<br/>\n&gt; the zone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Soooooo, I think as long as the mob is dubious or auto-attack toward<br/>\n&gt; everyone in<br/>\n&gt; your group, then yes, he will kill the whole group. I guess it pays to<br/>\n&gt; take a<br/>\n&gt; dark elf or rogue along with you at times.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Rosmorte (aka Faderic)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tom Swift wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Tom Swift&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As a side note.  If one of your group is engaged on combat by and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mob...named or not....then once your party member is dead the mob will<br/>\n&gt; come<br/>\n&gt; &gt; after the next closest party member and so on till all are dead or<br/>\n&gt; zoned, or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you kill the mob.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When a giant attacks a party member...first thing I do is DISBAND! Same<br/>\n&gt; goes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for anything that can wipe out the whole party.  We disband and then<br/>\n&gt; regroup<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when the danger is passed. Then the whole party doesn&#39;t have to run to<br/>\n&gt; zone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to regroup which can save considerable time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This can upset some people so it is best to make sure everyone<br/>\n&gt; understands<br/>\n&gt; &gt; before it happens.  To many people die becuase giants can destroy a<br/>\n&gt; party<br/>\n&gt; &gt; before anyone realizes the trouble.  90+  damage per hit makes short<br/>\n&gt; work of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most players especially after being stunned.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
