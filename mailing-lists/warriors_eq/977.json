As I was <br/>\nputting my stuff away I was think about the good times I has with my guild <br/>\nmates hunting frogs in the dungeon.  I had never been to Guk and it was a <br/>\nlot of fun.  Well mostly fun, that one train that wiped out the entire party <br/>\nwas no fun, especially the walk back from the high pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I was along in the swamps and backing my stuff.  Darn backpacks were <br/>\nheavy and as I put them all one I realized I was encumbered now the �Spirit <br/>\nof the Bear� had left me (141/130).  Time to go sell.  Maybe there is a spot <br/>\nin South Ro I could sell, if not there I knew I could sell at the inn in <br/>\nOasis.  Oasis would be good.  There I could get some experience killing <br/>\ncrocodiles and caimans.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo adjusting my backpacks I started off running around the side of the swamp <br/>\nto the pass leading to South Ro.  An easy trot saw a couple of frogs and an <br/>\nalligator or two, but nothing that looked worth hunting.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I zoned to South Ro I decided to look around a bit to see what was <br/>\naround.  Just a bunch of Orcs, had to kill a couple just because, but didn�t <br/>\nget any experience.  It was also kind of fun to walk straight through the <br/>\nOrc camps since they were too scared of me to do anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n�Well enough of this� I thought and turned to go into the desert.  Time to <br/>\nsell my loot and get to killing crocodiles.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I was crossing the desert I came across a couple of Troll and a dark elf <br/>\nkilling dervishes.  Stopped to check things out for a second and to see what <br/>\nthe camp looked like.  As I was checking things out I saw a skeleton <br/>\nstanding out in front of the tents all by himself.  Well, figured I would <br/>\nget closer and check him out, might be some good experience for me on the <br/>\nway to Oasis.  Big mistake, wasn�t just any skeleton but a dry bone skeleton <br/>\nthat didn�t like barbarians.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trolls jumped in to help me, but even with my dual long swords flying <br/>\nand the trolls beating on the skeleton, I soon found myself laying on my <br/>\nback again wondering why I ever got so close to the skeleton.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell soon after that I found myself back in the high hold pass naked except <br/>\nfor my kilt.  As I was standing up I got a message from Rallos Zek, the once <br/>\nI was hoping not to here � �You have failed me once again young barbarian, <br/>\nno longer can you claim the 16th Rank of warrior, you have lost a level and <br/>\nare now 15 again.�<br/>\n<br/>\nDrat and darn, not only did I lose a level, had a long walk ahead of me, but <br/>\nall my spare stuff from the bank vault was on my body.  Oh well, back to the <br/>\nbattle, now I really had to go back to Oasis as soon as possible to make <br/>\n16th Rank again.  Pissing off Rallos Zek is never a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I ran as fast as I can, past ghouls, giant spiders, sand giants and orcs. <br/>\n  Finally I was back in the desert of South Ro, hugging the wall, and <br/>\nlooking for my body.<br/>\n<br/>\nRunning south to the dervish tents, I suddenly heard the sound no one wants <br/>\nto hear.  Even the bravest warrior blanches in fear when she hears the <br/>\npounding footsteps of a giant behind her.<br/>\n<br/>\nA sand giant hits you for 96 points<br/>\nA sand giant hits you for 87 points<br/>\nYou are stunned�<br/>\n<br/>\nWell that hurt.  Once I found myself back in the Pass I decided that was <br/>\nenough for the day.  Looking around I found myself a nice flat rock to rest <br/>\non and lay down to camp.  Good thing I am a barbarian and the chill air this <br/>\nhigh didn�t bother me.  Guess I will go get my body later tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of Rallos Zek;<br/>\n<br/>\nPatty of Halas<br/>\nusername: Patricia<br/>\nserver: Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
