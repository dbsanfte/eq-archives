With 18dmg, 39 delay, and glowing like a greater<br/>\nlighstone, this two handed sword is calling to be my replacement for the<br/>\nAGI stealing BBC. Thing is though, the website only said it would be<br/>\nfound on a roaming barbarian in everfrost. Does anyone know which<br/>\nbarbarian has it?  My drow warrior is already KOS there, so it&#39;s no big<br/>\ndeal if i kill a few barbarians :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo John - I didn&#39;t catch you on last eve.  Hopefully tonight after work<br/>\nwe can get together and share stories.  I was in Guk and Cazic but I&#39;ll<br/>\ngo anywhere really :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNick<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\nJoin a new list today.<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
