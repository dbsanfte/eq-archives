This kind of<br/>\nthing almost makes me wish +PVP was the required<br/>\nsetting (almost, but not quite; because reality in<br/>\nother games proves people will just use PC Killing as<br/>\na source of amusement and bullying, and not a serious<br/>\nin-game mechanism).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no problem with someone camping to obtain an<br/>\nitem.  Key word here, *one*.  They show up, wait their<br/>\nturn, get their item, move on.  In this fashion, it&#39;s<br/>\nlike an amusement park ride, everyone takes a turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nCamping to get multiples is just lame.  Very, very,<br/>\nvery, very lame.  It takes away the fun in a very<br/>\nserious way.  I can&#39;t compete for the commonly<br/>\nmentioned items because the hard-core &#39;see if I let<br/>\nyou get one before I and my friends kill-steal it away<br/>\nfrom you while we laugh&#39; groups are determined to set<br/>\nup and hold the spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m probably going to have to pay plat for items I&#39;d<br/>\nlike my character to have, which really takes a lot of<br/>\nthe fun out of it.  A lot of the fun.  It would be<br/>\n*fun* to go adventuring, fight through the dungeon,<br/>\nfind the spot/npc everyone rumors as the source of a<br/>\nmighty item, and then defeat him/her/it in battle for<br/>\na great reward.  That would be *fun*.  But strolling<br/>\nthrough the dungeon that people are keeping cleared,<br/>\nfinding a huge crowd anxiously waiting for the npc to<br/>\narrive; that&#39;s *not fun*.  Especially when they&#39;re<br/>\nrude and irritated that I dare have the nerve to want<br/>\nto come and get an item for myself, which is what the<br/>\nresponse almost always is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorse, it&#39;s certainly not fun to buy it.  I probably<br/>\nwill, but it&#39;s not going to be the same at all.  Not<br/>\nat all.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of two things needs to happen; Uber monster spawns<br/>\nneed to be instituted (like SGs in NRo and Oasis, or<br/>\nthe Mino Hero in Steamfont) that will make farmers pay<br/>\nwith XP and blood for their patches, or hard coded<br/>\n&#39;lore&#39; item limits.  And if this makes it hard to get<br/>\na paired set of PG Tomahawks, tough.  We tried it the<br/>\nnice way, and it&#39;s not working; so you&#39;ll just have to<br/>\nuse one PGT and one of something else.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
