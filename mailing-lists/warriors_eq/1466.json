Trade deathfist slashed belts to the<br/>\n&gt; captain of the freeport militia. He can be found on the porch in the back<br/>\n&gt; of the militia house in east freeport.  Downside to this is that it lowers<br/>\n&gt; faction with the knights of truth paladins.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; There is another npc who takes the orc belts in the warrior guild in<br/>\n&gt; freeport.  Not sure of the faction adjustments when you trade them to him,<br/>\n&gt; but I do know that there is no negative faction adjustment.  I am pretty<br/>\n&gt; sure he adjusts merchant faction, but give it a try to be sure.  I think<br/>\n&gt; that it is more beneficial to trade 4 belts at once instead of one at a<br/>\n&gt; time.  Maybe someone else can clarify this point.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Bael<br/>\n&gt; Tier&#39;dal warrrior of the 17th level.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; \tFrom: jason &lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:spawn56@...\">spawn56@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tDate: Wednesday, July 14, 1999 1:59 AM<br/>\n&gt; \tSubject: [warriors_eq]Freeport Vendor Faction<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tI recently killedd a few human pcs in the Freeport arena and was<br/>\n&gt; wondering if there was anything i could do to raise faction with the<br/>\n&gt; Coalition of Trade Folk (freeport vendors) I am starting to run low on<br/>\n&gt; milk and haven&#39;t found anything that raises faction with the Trade Folk.<br/>\n&gt; Any information would be much appreciated<br/>\n&gt; \t <br/>\n&gt; \tThanks, Jason<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
