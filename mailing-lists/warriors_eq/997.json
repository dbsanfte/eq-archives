No problem, Rallos Zek gave me the power to start anew and <br/>\n&gt; rebuild my weath until I now have half banded and half ring mail, a combine <br/>\n&gt; long sword, a fine steel long sword and a fine steel 2H sword.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; SH** - It is going to take a whole lot longer to get that stuff back if I <br/>\n&gt; lose it.  Better recover my body at lunch.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; btw: Will someone please help me get painbringer?  tehehehe, ok, I know a <br/>\n&gt; 16th rank warrior wont last long in Sol B, but I will tag along :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of Rallos Zek;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Patty of Halas<br/>\n&gt; username: Patricia<br/>\n&gt; server: Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
