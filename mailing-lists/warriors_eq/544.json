No matter<br/>\nwhat time i goto Highpass, there&#39;s always at least one group just sitting<br/>\nthere waiting for endless hours for the gnoll to spawn. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is this:<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know the anticamp and timing of the gnoll that carries the<br/>\nweapon?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people don&#39;t believe that there is an anticamp for weapons, and those<br/>\nwho don&#39;t, let me give you an example to prove that there is.<br/>\n<br/>\nCHITIN SHIELD<br/>\n<br/>\nSome talk was going on about getting the chitin shield and that you had to<br/>\nkill a giant heart spider to get it, which is located in Guk.  I went to<br/>\nGuk over four separate occasions for many many hours, each and every time<br/>\nbeing unsuccessful.  One kind person posted a respawn list of what would<br/>\ncome next, but even that proved to be wrong.  A guildmate of mine and I<br/>\nhad an idea though.  He had recently figured out the anticamp spot and<br/>\ntimer for getting the BBC and Gossimer robe, so we decided to experiment.<br/>\nWe did figure it out, and this is how it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nKill everything inside the room where the giant heart spider is supposed<br/>\nto spawn. DO NOT LOOT ANYTHING UNTIL EVERYTHING IS DEAD.  When everything<br/>\nis dead, loot quick, and run out of the room and go behind the corridor.<br/>\nThe little hall outside of the room has a darker floor, then there is a<br/>\nlower lighter floor, and another darker one nearer the water. Have your<br/>\nparty all stand on the darker floor there and wait for 16 minutes after<br/>\nthe person who looted the giant heart or the large or whatever was<br/>\nspawned. If you want to give it an extra minute, you can do so.  If<br/>\neveryone followed the rules, when you all run in, there should be another<br/>\ngiant heart spider with the chitin shield again for you. I have tested<br/>\nthis and successfully done it on three occasions, so it DOES work.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the tomahawk discussion and one more thing.. I don&#39;t know how it<br/>\nis on all of your servers, but I play on Solusek Ro, and I&#39;m disgusted<br/>\nwith the players and people on the server.  People charging 100 to over<br/>\n200 plat for a rare item.  In beta, an item rarely went over 20 plat, and<br/>\nif it did, by that time, you were in your mid twenties in level and could<br/>\nget it without a problem or could afford to pay for it. I am a level 19<br/>\nwarrior and also have a level 19 druid, and i do NOT have 100 to 200 plat<br/>\nto spend on anything but the things to keep my character advancing.<br/>\nSpells for my druid and armor for my warrior.  Those people who do have<br/>\nthat cash at early levels must have a LOT of time on their hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got my char to almost level 20 in 6 days and 20 some hours.  This isn&#39;t<br/>\nthat spectaular, but i fight to get experience and i fight well. I work<br/>\nfull time and am also a full time student at a university. I do not have<br/>\nthe time to run around and kill wisps or whatever people with big bank<br/>\naccounts do. The reason why i want to share the spawn information with you<br/>\nguys is because I hope you will help me in lowering the disgusting<br/>\ninflated prices of the game. Give items to players or sell them for cheap.<br/>\nIt&#39;s what I and some good members of my guild do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading and hopefully someone knows the info for the tomahawk.<br/>\nI&#39;d really love to get one or two for my dual wield.<br/>\n<br/>\nNick<br/>\nFrizzan on Solusek Ro (Bloodstone Templars)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
