Just like the mage has to rest while<br/>\ndealing out those spells, we warriors should need to rest after fighting in<br/>\nall that armor and swinging that 3 to 5 lbs. sword around, 9 lbs. in the<br/>\ncase of great swords.<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.adrianempire.org<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jones, Brian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, June 11, 1999 5:15 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Petition or Melee vs. Caster damage<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mages have a limit at what they can do though.  Sure they can <br/>\n&gt; hit with a<br/>\n&gt; spell for 1200 damage, but they have mana that will <br/>\n&gt; eventually run out.  By<br/>\n&gt; what you are suggesting,  a warrior could keep swinging and <br/>\n&gt; swinging for<br/>\n&gt; 1200 damage per attack without losing that ability after <br/>\n&gt; prolonged use (did<br/>\n&gt; that make sense)?  The critical strike is probably a good <br/>\n&gt; solution, as well<br/>\n&gt; as the specialization skill - but in no way should a warrior <br/>\n&gt; be able to do<br/>\n&gt; as much damage as a caster.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: \tObergfell, Steven[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SObergfell@...\">SObergfell@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: \tThursday, June 10, 1999 4:37 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: \t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Petition or Melee vs. Caster damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Obergfell, Steven&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SObergfell@...\">SObergfell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sorry, that last email was just too hard to read!!!  Here <br/>\n&gt; it is again in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; plain text!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think the difference between melee combatants and casters <br/>\n&gt; magic should<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thus:  Melee fighters should be able to do just as much <br/>\n&gt; damage, if not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whereas a caster may strike from a distance, and strike <br/>\n&gt; multiple targets<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with area effect spells.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am the president of a national group that fights with live steel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weapons.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been fighting with long swords, 2-handed swords, axes <br/>\n&gt; and maces for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 10<br/>\n&gt; &gt; years, and I am very comfortable with just how devastating <br/>\n&gt; these weapons<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be.  No matter if you are struck by lightning or are cut in <br/>\n&gt; 2 by a large<br/>\n&gt; &gt; axe, you are just as dead!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So perhaps the direction we need to seek, and the <br/>\n&gt; difference between these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2<br/>\n&gt; &gt; types of characters. melee and caster, is not how much <br/>\n&gt; damage they do, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; how.  A caster should be able to reach far away, and strike multiple<br/>\n&gt; &gt; targets, while the great warrior should only be able to <br/>\n&gt; strike at one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; target<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at a time, but be able to mow them down like wheat.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Oh, and if anyone is interested in an organization that <br/>\n&gt; allow you to wear<br/>\n&gt; &gt; armor and swing a real blade ( and trust me, it will give <br/>\n&gt; you a whole new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; perspective on your RPGing!) check out our website!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; www.adrianempire.org&#92;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; =======================================================<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This email message is for the sole use of the intended <br/>\n&gt; recipient(s) and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; may contain confidential and privileged information.
