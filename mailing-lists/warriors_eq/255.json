What should a level six Barbarian be doing with his limited amounts of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Scrawny gnolls at entrance of BB three gen spots pretty easy picking.. will get<br/>\nyou to 8 easy.. painfully but easy.. there is a guard that wanders at the base<br/>\nof the entrance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you get in a group go inside BB and stay on the top level. If you go at<br/>\nnight watch out for that first step oyi... there is a big hole in the middle<br/>\nand water and this buggar in the water too (ouch!) fell in it the first time I<br/>\nwent there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t mind the dungeon atmosphere BB is great exp... I prefer the plains<br/>\nso can&#39;t tell you much more...<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the plains hunt some  larges spiders, and in a group some polar bears (some<br/>\nyou will be able to handle on your own) Just stay close to Brandl ( i think<br/>\nthats how you spell his name) when you hunt alone.. pull them in and you will<br/>\nbe able to run if you get in trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater on the plains you can get in a group 8/9 ish.. start going for orcs<br/>\ntroopers... lepoards.. giant spiders.. just watch out for ice bone skeletons  (<br/>\nyou will need a magical weapon so just run ),  shamans and mounts.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m level 14 and have been doing mammoth calfs alone and in groups ..<br/>\nstarted them n groups when was 11. and can handle sharmans and mounts with one<br/>\nother person (love the bash skill for disrupting spells - it seems to work<br/>\nbetter than kicking got it to 70 currently). I must say having a sharman to<br/>\ngive you SOW and heal you is wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\n<br/>\nAzlana, Warrior of Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
