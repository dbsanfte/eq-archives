I<br/>\ntold him of the things I have been reading here such as a critical strike (which<br/>\nhe didn&#39;t think would be accepted), increase what bind wound could do ( he<br/>\nagreed that it should go up to 70-80%), increased skill cap (no comment from<br/>\nhim) and unique warrior skill (again  no comment from him). His idea was to have<br/>\nthe warrior&#39;s  defensives skill be increased some how. That would make the<br/>\nwarrior harder to hit and therefore less damage and less down time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to try to get him to join this mailing list since I feel he could<br/>\ngive great insight. He did say that they were not going to be writing anything<br/>\nsoon but said something about how a warrior could be tweeked to make a warrior<br/>\nawsome.<br/>\n<br/>\nAzlana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
