And ya, 20 is a bit to low, good group of mid to high 20s is good.  Barbed whips are rather rare, but I have seen a couple people selling them, in the 50pp range, but neither of these people were in Najena when they were selling them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; CAB &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bash@...\">Bash@...</a>&gt; 5.17.99 11:04:51 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: CAB &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bash@...\">Bash@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBarb Warrior looking up at 20th from close range, looking to upgrade<br/>\ndualign weapons.

If so what is a fair<br/>\nprice for one? Also what are some other good dualing weapons? heard of a<br/>\ncrystaline sword that sounds just sweet, but no idea where that one<br/>\ncomes from.<br/>\n<br/>\nBashlor the Big Dumb Barb Warrior of Bertox<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nDid you know ONElist has over 300 Star Wars lists?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a> <br/>\nJoin one today!<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
