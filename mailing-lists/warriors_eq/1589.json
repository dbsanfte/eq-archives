The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-280788293\">Taunt is ineffective if your casters are dealing to much damage with spells.<br/>\nThey do large amounts of damage in a short time keeping a mobs attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason the 2 hs is better in a group is if the wiz controls himself in<br/>\nthe early parts of combat you can keep a mob taunted on you the whole time<br/>\nbecause of the damage you are dealing with your big sword.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen when the wizzie kicks in the heavy damage the mob takes off running.<br/>\nSo in the perfect combat you take all the damage...cleric only has one<br/>\nperson to heal...and the group moves on to the next combat faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also helps that you do the pulling as well.  Keep a bow on hand for<br/>\npulling from a distance.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy $.02<br/>\n<br/>\nBael<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Patricia Halas &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, October 18, 1999 10:14 AM<br/>\nSubject: [warriors_eq] Re: 1H or 2H<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Patricia Halas&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I must agree.

It also seems to help my taunt when I am using dual<br/>\n&gt;langseax 1H swords and taunting, that almost always gets the mob off a<br/>\n&gt;caster no matter what spells he is using.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So in closing.  Keep your 1H and 2H skills max&#39;ed along with slam/bash and<br/>\n&gt;kick and keep on fighting!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Patricia Bryan<br/>\n&gt;Princess of the Bryan Dynasty<br/>\n&gt;Dynasty Guild, Bristlebane Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
