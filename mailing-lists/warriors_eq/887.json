He spawns near the throne room.  He<br/>\ncarries the final piece that allows you to combine and you DO not get the<br/>\nblued hammer, you get some mallet, which is one damage/delay less than the<br/>\nsummoned hammer but is +10 to magic resistance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe took him down with a full party of level 20&#39;s.  Sapped all the healers<br/>\nand casters mana and our paladin had to use LOH.  We won in the end but both<br/>\nour wizards died.  I would say his 25 to 28th level, only because he<br/>\nresisted the wizards spells about 40% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nJaade D&#39;Vinn<br/>\nIndigo Sista Soldier<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tZwanenburg, John[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tMonday, May 31, 1999 10:34 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Blued Hammer<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Zwanenburg, John&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hey all me again,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ive been playing my cleric alot lately...( yeah yeah i know =) ) and for<br/>\n&gt; themost part been leveling like mad...ive been kicking around befallen<br/>\n&gt; tons<br/>\n&gt; killing the elf skeleton and getting the parts required to make the blued<br/>\n&gt; hammer ( a kick ass weapon for blunt users.)
