Currently I dual<br/>\n&gt; wield polished granite tomahawk axes (don&#39;t ask about how long it took me,<br/>\n&gt; or how many fools try to take them away) and can safely say they kick so<br/>\n&gt; much ass. How else can a Warrior steal kills from a Caster???  Anyway, I<br/>\n&gt; currently only have ringmail and some banded for armor and what I really<br/>\n&gt; want is plate.  Bronze plate I hear is fairly reasonable, though heavy,<br/>\n&gt; which shouldn&#39;t be a problem with my high Strength.  Does anyone know<br/>\n&gt; where the best place to acquire Medium sized Bronze plate is?  I&#39;ve got my<br/>\n&gt; weapons, and now I need to beef up my armor.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Odhinn MacDoughl<br/>\n&gt; Skald, Hand of Tyr<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
