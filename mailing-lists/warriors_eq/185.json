As an ogre<br/>\nwarrior (level 20 CT server) it may be more important for me<br/>\nthan for most of you. In just two levels of camping on the orcs in HighPass<br/>\n(maybe 18 hours total time), the guards and citizens<br/>\nof High Pass are now amiable to me, a huge improvement from the glowering<br/>\nthey stared at. Every time another group was<br/>\nfighting an orc, I would simply drop a bow shot into it. This gave me<br/>\npositive faction with every kill that was done, and I haven&#39;t<br/>\nmet a person yet who gets angry at 10 damage going into a level 16-20 mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nOglug ~Hand of Chaos~</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
