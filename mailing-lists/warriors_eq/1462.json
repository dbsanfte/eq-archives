I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1035342968\">I wouldnt start heading to Solusek A until around 25 and up.  Maybe even<br/>\nhigher. I didnt go anyway there until level 30.  Solusek B is much more<br/>\ndangerous.  I just set foot inside at level 30 and the first thing I saw was<br/>\nred.  May have been bad luck to see a powerful Goblin right off the bat, or<br/>\nmaybe that is the way the whole place is.  Do not know, I didnt go any<br/>\nfarther.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the demon claw.  You should (I would think) depending on the server<br/>\nyour on, and how many high level characters are on the server be able to<br/>\npick on up for around 200 - 300 plat.  The shouldnt be for trade only items,<br/>\nand they can be obtained around level 32 on your own with a group.  Though<br/>\nyou DEFINITELY better have 2 clerics and someone at least around level 35.<br/>\nThe mob is a level 35 SK and has a 800point harm touch from what I have<br/>\nheard.  He never got me with the touch.  He also smacks ya around a little<br/>\nharder and alot faster than a Sand Giant.<br/>\n<br/>\nDyvim Kincaid<br/>\nWarrior of Cazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: David Rogers [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:derogers334@...\">derogers334@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 14, 1999 9:58 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [warriors_eq] what should i be looking for now?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: David Rogers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:derogers334@...\">derogers334@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- James Wofford &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:James.Wofford@...\">James.Wofford@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As far as weapons are concerned.
