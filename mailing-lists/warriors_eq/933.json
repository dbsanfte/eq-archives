Any good group can do it.<br/>\n Also, now that I&#39;m 22nd level, often the groups I&#39;m in (and if you hit 20<br/>\nand don&#39;t group all the time, you are wasting your time IMHO) vary in level<br/>\nby more than 4 levels. I&#39;ve killed giant skels (level 22-25) with a group<br/>\nall at or below 20. When I got my SBH, no one in the group was above 20 and<br/>\nthe orc that drops it is at least 24th. Brad has always said that twinking<br/>\ncatches up to you, and I believe it. A friend had a 17th level halfling<br/>\nwarrior and decided to pass all his gear on to a wood elf ranger he wanted<br/>\nto try (full set of ring, mino axe, tentacle whip). He had the hardest time<br/>\njudging what to kill and he was levelling so fast his skills didn&#39;t stay<br/>\nup. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere a very few items I would pay for that could be found as loot. Find<br/>\nout where they are located, go there, and get in a group. The only money<br/>\nI&#39;ve spent since level 13 when I bought a regular battle axe (at the time I<br/>\nmade 13 very few FS weapons were being found on CT) the only cash I&#39;ve<br/>\nspent was about 80pp for most of a set of banded and 6pp for snakeskin<br/>\ngloves (no matter how often I&#39;ve been in Paw, I never find snakeskin). Been<br/>\nkicking a fair amount into guild so I have about 90pp at level 22 (money<br/>\nreally isn&#39;t that important to me) and am trying to meet a fletcher I know<br/>\nwho will sell me a shaped ash bow for 60pp. If evil races could fletch easy<br/>\nI&#39;d be making my own by now, but hey, Verant all plays good races (in beta<br/>\nI can remember 2 GM&#39;s who were regularly evil) and us ogres and trolls get<br/>\nscrewed (try to smith as one sometime). May spend a few spare plats on some<br/>\nbronze from some guild mates who have been hunting Najena heavy, or may<br/>\njust go join them and take it from the dead body of the captain.<br/>\n<br/>\nOglug ~Hand of Chaos~<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage text written by INTERNET:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Make all rare items level specific.
