I made level 9<br/>\nlast night - woo hoo!  Twice actually - too many stupid deaths: Holly got me<br/>\nwhen I was not looking, that dang Gnoll Commander in Black Burrow that hangs<br/>\nout on the far side of the river on the left once you get down by the rock<br/>\nand the first bridge.  One time I tried to drag him back to a wizard friend<br/>\nfor an ambush but got dizzy and he whacked me good.  Next time, I came back<br/>\nwith more friends - a wizard and a druid and we tried to gang him.  We had<br/>\nhim too and then 2 more of his GS buds showed up and we were ded meat at<br/>\nthat point.<br/>\nBut he is gonna pay for that because I am coming back with all my friends<br/>\nand we are gonna hand him a full can of KickButt(tm)!<br/>\nSo, even at level 8 I have been finding it harder and harder to get xp -<br/>\nsolo or in partys.  I have been doing either BB (for loot) or West Karanas<br/>\n(for xp).  Are the aqueducts any good for low 9&#39;s?  I kinda really hate<br/>\nmazes and tunnels - I still get lost going to the bank!  Or is it time to<br/>\nventure forth?  I have been to N Karanas (hate gryfawns with a passion!) and<br/>\nS Karanas near Split Paw one time but MD seemed low then.<br/>\nOne of my goals is to try to catch a cleric friend who is at level 14 (he<br/>\ngot a real job so he can&#39;t play EQ all day long no more :-)  But I am up for<br/>\nadventure as well.  And I have spent some time helping others and that&#39;s fun<br/>\ntoo.  <br/>\nAny thoughts?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
