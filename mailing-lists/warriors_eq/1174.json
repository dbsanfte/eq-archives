But<br/>\n&gt;hp&#39;s should be a primary result of race and stamina.  A Wood Elf or Dark<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Elf<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Warrior should have LESS hp&#39;s than a Dwarven Paladin.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Warriors should have a slight melee advantage over hybrids.  Apparently<br/>\n&gt;this isn&#39;t so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Warriors should have one combat skill that is not obtainable by the<br/>\n&gt;hybrids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How did Verant try to balance the Warrior but failed:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- They gave hybrids an EXP penalty.  In theory this should have worked.  If<br/>\n&gt;you play a Warrior and a Paladin each for 100 hours, then the Warrior will<br/>\n&gt;be at a higher level than the Paladin and therefore more powerful.  This<br/>\n&gt;does work, but most people don&#39;t understand or don&#39;t care.  Plus there are<br/>\n&gt;too many level-based restrictions like who you can group with, what<br/>\n </span></blockquote>monsters<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;give you experience.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Warriors get combat skills at a lower level than hybrids.  This does give<br/>\n&gt;Warriors a combat advantage when they have the skill and the hybrids don&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt;At levels 1-4, a warrior can kick, while no other hybrid can.  At levels<br/>\n&gt;13-16 Warriors can dual wield while no other hybrid can.  At levels 15-19,<br/>\n&gt;Warriors can double attack, while no other hybrid can.  The same goes for<br/>\n&gt;Parry from 10-16.  These earlier skills do give Warriors a combat<br/>\n </span></blockquote>advantage.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But at level 20, the hybrids catch up with the Warrior in the skills<br/>\n&gt;department.  At higher levels, the Warrior has no skill advantage over the<br/>\n&gt;hybrids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Warriors have access to the best melee races - Trolls, Ogres, and<br/>\n&gt;Barbarians.  The stat bonuses these races have give the Warrior a<br/>\n&gt;significant advantage over weaker races.  But the two evil races, Ogres and<br/>\n&gt;Trolls, have significant penalties that cancel out their stat bonus.<br/>\n&gt;Barbarians are a good choice, but some people can&#39;t deal without night<br/>\n&gt;vision.  But the better race selection does nothing to those who choose to<br/>\n&gt;play a dark elf or wood elf, who probably made a poor race choice for a<br/>\n&gt;warrior.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Berzerker Frenzy.  Not something to depend on.  Most of the time we want<br/>\n&gt;to be healed before we get down to the Frenzy level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Verant also screwed up by giving Rangers both dual wield and double<br/>\n&gt;attack.  Only Warriors should get both skills  (I&#39;m not considering Rogues<br/>\n&gt;here, only hybrids).  It was good that Paladins and SKs didn&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt;dual-wield.  Rangers getting both skills was a mistake IMHO.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Higher Skill Cap.  It was always rumored that Warriors didn&#39;t have a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>skill<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;cap on their combat skills.  This lead many of us to believe that a high<br/>\n&gt;level Warrior would have a decent combat advantage over the hybrids.<br/>\n&gt;Apparently this rumor is false, and we have the same combat cap.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What can be done to fix Warriors:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Warriors should have a higher skill cap, either lvl *6 +5 or lvl *5 +10<br/>\n&gt;instead of the hybrid lvl *5 +5 cap.  Warriors should also not be capped at<br/>\n&gt;200 like the hybrids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Give Warriors a warrior-only skill.  The Monk has several special moves.<br/>\n&gt;Give the Warrior something to use that is a little better than Kick or<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bash.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Give Warriors a once-per-day skill.  We need a Berserk or Battle Cry<br/>\n </span></blockquote>skill<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;that would give us a significant short-duration combat boost.  It shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;be based on how low our hp&#39;s are, but instead usable when we want.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What should not be done:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Warriors don&#39;t need anything that makes soloing easier.  If anything, the<br/>\n&gt;ability of other classes to solo should be reduced.  EQ is a group oriented<br/>\n&gt;game and should remain that way.  If you want to play solo, Might & Magic 7<br/>\n&gt;was just released.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Warriors don&#39;t need any magic.  We shouldn&#39;t have spells that make us<br/>\n </span></blockquote>heal<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;or gate or anything.  Warriors are as far away from spellcasters as<br/>\n&gt;possible.  If you want the ability to cast spells, play a hybrid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How do we get these changes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Don&#39;t ask for things totally ridiculous.  When people ask for huge<br/>\n&gt;unbalancing changes, it makes them look like they haven&#39;t thought it out<br/>\n&gt;very carefully.  Verant is much more likely to pay attention to our<br/>\n&gt;suggestions if they are well thought out AND reasonable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Once we come up with a reasonable set of changes, get as many Warriors<br/>\n&gt;behind it as we can.  Currently we have 100 people asking for 100 different<br/>\n&gt;changes ranging from critical hits to healing to gating to wizard-like<br/>\n&gt;damage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Warriors only need a few small changes to become the dominate melee class<br/>\n&gt;they should be.
