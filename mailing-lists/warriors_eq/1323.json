There were 6 of us. A<br/>\nlevel 49 cleric. Level 43 warrior (Me) Level 47 Wizard, level 47 Rogue,<br/>\nlevel 49 necro and a level 45 Ranger. We decided why the heck not give him a<br/>\ntry even tho he conned red to everyone in the party. Well it was quite the<br/>\nbattle. By far the craziest i have ever seen. In the end only the Necro and<br/>\nthe wizard were left but somehow they managed to pull it off. I tried my<br/>\nbest to stay in melee with him and was doing quite well untill the cleric<br/>\nhad a fizzle. But then it was ouch time. As soon as i went, the Rogue was<br/>\nnext and followed by the Ranger. The cleric somehow managed to stay alive<br/>\nfor a while longer but couldnt handle the beating. When i finally made it<br/>\nback the necro was at 1 quarter life and the wozard half. Talk about your<br/>\nkick ass battle, Ill never forget it. When my friend who was just watching<br/>\nsends me the screens, would any one like them?<br/>\n<br/>\nLothaniel/Rayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, June 15, 1999 8:27 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Warriors vs Hybrids<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wrote an e-mail to one of those guys from PPI - the ones who do the<br/>\n&gt; great<br/>\n&gt; analysis works of classs (see eq-stratis cleric for a sampling of their<br/>\n&gt; work). I<br/>\n&gt; told him of the things I have been reading here such as a critical strike<br/>\n&gt; (which<br/>\n&gt; he didn&#39;t think would be accepted), increase what bind wound could do ( he<br/>\n&gt; agreed that it should go up to 70-80%), increased skill cap (no comment<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; him) and unique warrior skill (again  no comment from him). His idea was<br/>\n&gt; to have<br/>\n&gt; the warrior&#39;s  defensives skill be increased some how. That would make the<br/>\n&gt; warrior harder to hit and therefore less damage and less down time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am going to try to get him to join this mailing list since I feel he<br/>\n&gt; could<br/>\n&gt; give great insight. He did say that they were not going to be writing<br/>\n&gt; anything<br/>\n&gt; soon but said something about how a warrior could be tweeked to make a<br/>\n&gt; warrior<br/>\n&gt; awsome.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Azlana<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Got an opinion?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Make it count!
