It has not yet been <br/>\n&quot;prooven&quot; do be Brads, but I have have no reason to doubt it, except for the <br/>\nfact that it was posted very early for CA time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the excerpt:<br/>\n: Certain classes (warriors) were not at all thought out.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, I&#39;m going to change my position on this, after some long <br/>\ndiscussions with the GMs, my dev team, and after careful consideration of <br/>\nthe various emails and posts I&#39;ve read. There will be some significant <br/>\nimprovements made to warriors soon. But not well thought out? Hrm. As the <br/>\ngame progressed through beta and through release, we&#39;ve been tweaking and <br/>\nbalancing, and sometimes classes need to be re-balanced a bit. But I think <br/>\nwe always make a concerted effort to think things out.<br/>\n<br/>\n*****************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny I remember saying I thought may have been balance early in beta and <br/>\nnot looked at since :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is in a thread called: As soon as I dump my stuff to my guildmemebers I <br/>\ncancle my account (or something like that).<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy the news.<br/>\n<br/>\nKailyn of Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
