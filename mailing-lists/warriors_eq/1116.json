I am level 2, and have bought the first two spells.  I bought a mandolin and a lute, and have no idea how to use them.  Perhaps this comes at a later level?  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Leri<br/>\n&gt; Xegony Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;** --------- End Original Message ----------- **<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
