See below. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*laugh*  Firmly believe away, but please only do so after reading the rest<br/>\nof this article.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ok, if AC is all that matters, why do a pair of characters at equal<br/>\n&gt; level and Defensive skills have such vast differences?  One a Ranger in<br/>\n&gt; full banded, the other a Warrior/Paladin/ShadowKnight in full plate; the<br/>\n&gt; Rangers consistently take more damage from fights than their heavily<br/>\n&gt; armored fellow tanks. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok... have you actually looked at the AC advantage that Plate provides<br/>\nover Banded?  Have you actually _asked_ a Ranger in full Banded his AC and<br/>\nthen compared it to yours (assuming in full Plate)? <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the numbers.  Armor sets add the following amount to your &#39;base&#39; AC<br/>\nfrom level/agility/defense skill.  (Note that there are some modifying<br/>\neffects. e.g., Armor provides more AC for characters with high (90+) <br/>\nAgility.) <br/>\n<br/>\nFull Plate: 110 AC<br/>\nFull Banded: 77 AC<br/>\n<br/>\nAC differential: 33 AC (not including modifying effects)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is where the difference in damage arises, not from the type of armor. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were to replace all of these Plate pieces with Magical Leather<br/>\nArmor that totalled up to 110AC you would receive the _exact_ same<br/>\nprotection as if you had Plate on (level and skill being equal).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Still don&#39;t like that test?  Try this one: take *your* WAR/PAL/SDK and<br/>\n&gt; get a full suit of plate to match the full suit of banded you&#39;re so<br/>\n&gt; proud of.  Go fight a few blue mobs in your banded armor and note the<br/>\n&gt; strength of the blows that connect against you; how much single shots<br/>\n&gt; tend to do, how many low damage shots you receive, and how much total<br/>\n&gt; damage you take over the fight. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As noted above, your test is flawed because there is a serious AC<br/>\ndifference between the Banded and Plate.  And I have tested both Plate and<br/>\nPlate equivalents looking for differences.  My Paladin, Warrior, and SK<br/>\nall maximize AC per slot resulting in the greatest protection.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdmittedly, I do prefer the look of Steel Plate, but I will sacrifice it<br/>\nin favor of better equipment (higher AC/stat enhancers) if the advantage<br/>\nis significant enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from AC differences, appearance of armor matters only for personal<br/>\naethestics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now put on the plate and try another few fights against similar mobs<br/>\n&gt; (level and race).  You should notice fewer shots dealing maximum damage<br/>\n&gt; against you, more shots doing low damage (2-10 where before it would<br/>\n&gt; have been 40-60 on each connect), and less total damage at the end of<br/>\n&gt; the fight. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As is _very_ correct, given that you&#39;re wearing 33 AC more.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You think you&#39;ve found some secret uber-combo (ala Tekken or something,<br/>\n&gt; up-up-down-left-right left and right punch together to produce the<br/>\n&gt; MegaFireball) or something; this game has shown no instances of such<br/>\n&gt; imbalances.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whoa... whoa... whoa... nice shooting Tex... <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat ultra-secret combo am I trying to reveal?  I&#39;m just saying that<br/>\nAC is the deciding factor in determining protection during melee combat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen did knowledge of the game you&#39;re playing become some cheat code?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you truly think they managed to get all the way through four phases<br/>\n&gt; of beta and the past 4-6 months of final and never notice that plate, as<br/>\n&gt; you are alledging, is useless? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Plate is _not_ useless.  It provides the most AC per piece available of<br/>\nany armor that can be bought from standard NPC merchants.  Therefore it is<br/>\nthe best protection you can get without adventuring.  But that is _not_<br/>\nbecause it is (insert angel choir here) Plate. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thinking you&#39;ve found some hidden truth; that banded is marginally (5%<br/>\n&gt; or less) effective than Plate but has a fraction of the weight ...<br/>\n&gt; folly.  Sheer folly. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*vast confusion*  Where, in any of my mail, have I stated that Banded is<br/>\nequivalent to Plate?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Plate matters in a fight.  I&#39;ll take plate armored tanks over those in<br/>\n&gt; banded seven days a week and the rest of the month too.  I have watched<br/>\n&gt; the performance of Rangers (since they *can&#39;t* have better than banded)<br/>\n&gt; higher than my level for months now; they&#39;re stuck in banded while I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; in plate, and I take less damage when tanking.  I&#39;ve watched warriors<br/>\n&gt; who aren&#39;t plate armored yet, and I take less damage than they when<br/>\n&gt; tanking. And I only have an 80 AGI, so it&#39;s not that. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No... AC matters in a fight.  I would take a L30 Warrior in full Azure<br/>\nover a L30 Warrior in full Steel Plate any day of the week.  Why?  Because<br/>\nAzure has a higher AC per piece and therefore provides more protection<br/>\nthan Plate. <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, Azure looks like Cloth armor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But hey, whatever you want to do.  If you&#39;re in my group though, I won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; appreciate the higher percentage of the healers&#39; mana you&#39;ll be taking<br/>\n&gt; to recover from the greater damage you&#39;ll be taking.  I suspect they<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t either. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*grin* You won&#39;t have to &quot;not appreciate it&quot;, because I won&#39;t be taking<br/>\nthe damage. <br/>\n<br/>\nAC matters.  Style (appearance) matters.  Choose which one matters more.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a fight, I know which one I would choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\n<br/>\nDrew</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
