Of couse that means the<br/>\nquests would have to be very difficult and actually work :)  When<br/>\nI was designing an RPG along, long, long time ago, my co-designer<br/>\nand myself came up with a way to make sure that someone didn&#39;t<br/>\ncomplete the quest twice.  There is a boolean flag for each quest<br/>\nattached to the character with a true or false vale.  The true meant<br/>\nthat you completed the quest.  After you completed the quest then<br/>\nyou were flagged and couldn&#39;t get the item again.  But what if you<br/>\nwanted to get one for a friend?  Well this could be accomplished in<br/>\nEQ with the party leader.  Whoever was the inviter would be <br/>\nconsidered the party leader and would get the item upon succesful<br/>\ncompletion of the quest.  Then your friend would invite and become<br/>\nthe party leader and could do the quest again, getting the same <br/>\nitem.  There could be alot more checks added to see if the quest <br/>\nwas in progress, how many characters in the party has the same <br/>\nquest in progress, etc, etc.  Killing something to get a great <br/>\nweapon just doesn&#39;t seem appropriate.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tJynxx[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jynxx@...\">Jynxx@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, May 25, 1999 3:11 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Camping, a solution<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jynxx&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jynxx@...\">Jynxx@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s what we need! A random item spawn.....I&#39;ll even take it one step<br/>\n&gt; further:<br/>\n&gt; Lets say that said sword is on a level 45 person...so we&#39;ll call that a<br/>\n&gt; &#39;level 45 item&#39; it can then spawn to any level 45+ NPC in all of the zone,<br/>\n&gt; or even norrath. That would make people have to travel A LOT to find items<br/>\n&gt; they want, and would completely prevent camping for items altogether. That<br/>\n&gt; way if you really wanted an item bad enough, your group had to go search<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; it...not just sit sround and wait for it....that to me is not even<br/>\n&gt; role-playing.<br/>\n&gt; Just my 2 cents.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tyveris<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist has over 150,000 e-mail communities from which to chose!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
