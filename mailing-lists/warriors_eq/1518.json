I prefer a shaman with me.<br/>\nRegen (level 24 shaman spell) is one of the most mana efficient ways to<br/>\nheal people. A shaman at 24 or above can go almost OOM during the fight,<br/>\nthen throw regen on the tanks, and the tanks will be 80% or better by the<br/>\ntime the finger wagglers are FM. And I do agree with Dyvim, until you fight<br/>\nwith an enchanter, you have no idea of their power. They don&#39;t start coming<br/>\ninto their true power until level 16. With one spell, they can change the<br/>\nodds in a fight. And if you fight something that has a pet, once you kill<br/>\nthe master, an enchanter can one shot the pet.<br/>\n<br/>\nOglug, Cazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage text written by INTERNET:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;tanks (2 true warriors)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>2healers (cleric/druid)<br/>\n2nukers (enchanter/wizard)&lt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
