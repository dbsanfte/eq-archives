It just seems that if a woman is afraid or scared to go to a certain place or whatever it seems more acceptable than if a man said he&#39;s afraid. So I think it is to allow more acceptance of one&#39;s fears in the game. *chuckles* Me, I don&#39;t like going to new places (once I know the area .. watch out) and the guys I hunt with know that and are patient with me. After they see that I&#39;m comfortable then they keep sending me out to fetch since I have<br/>\nthe most HP out of them all. Go figya.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAzlana<br/>\n<br/>\nJason Coan wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Speaking of women.....There is one big question I have.....why do guys play girl characters....some say they are role playing.....do they also dress up in womens close and role play women in real life?  or is &quot;role playing&quot; a female the first step towards role playing a real life female? I know there are a lot of legitimate female players, but I&#39;d bet a large sum of money that most of the female characters are being driven by guys.....call me homophobic if you will, but I think its weird.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a>&gt; 5.19.99 12:47:10 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hail,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It was good to see another of the female gender with a passion for<br/>\n&gt; slashin an bashing!<br/>\n&gt; Currently on a mission to get my four bubbles for dual attack and dual<br/>\n&gt; weild *snickers*.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *grumbles*<br/>\n&gt; gotta take care of some RL stuff so I can hunt.. hunt..hunt<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Azlana, Barbarian Warrior of Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What was YOUR favorite part?!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Tell other Star Wars fans at ONElist!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
