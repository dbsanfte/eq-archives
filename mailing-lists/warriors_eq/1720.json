Never thought of myself as THE Kailyn, but \nyeah its me. I did do the AC/Agi and Stm/HP though, I had help, especially with \nthe second. I got lucky and someone else saw the pattern in the data and I am \nthe one who got the credit. And if you ever catch Kailyn on Povar, she is a \nwoman.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div><tt>I indeed was part of the great warrior sitout (I think the \n  first<br>sitout).

I was not over at \nStratics yet.&nbsp;I was on one of the other baords. I can&#39;t remember the name \nof but they are dead (atleast to me) due to really bad software. I jumped over \nto Stratics well after that. I actaully have a piercing skill because a friend \nof mine got me a pair of Crys Knives (4/20???) magic for Unrest. I was &quot;Ruatha&quot; \nswapping them with my Mino axes when fighting magical mobs. Ahh the good old \ndays. </font></div>\n<blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div><tt>BTW another great warrior weapon to add to the &quot;uber&quot; list you \n  mentioned<br>is the bloodpoint 10/21 procs an 80 pt hp txf &amp; is not lore \n  (drops in<br>Howling Stones).&nbsp; I have 1 of these at the moment &amp; with \n  werwolf form<br>see 8-9 procs a fight.&nbsp; My goal in life (other than get \n  to lvl 56 &amp;<br>riposte) is to obtain another.</tt></div></blockquote>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Actually it was more of my point that weapons have \ngone completely insane in the upgrades to the game.
