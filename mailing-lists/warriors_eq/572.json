They are the best class in the game and can solo indefinitally.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; David Rogers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:derogers334@...\">derogers334@...</a>&gt; 5.24.99 3:01:44 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: David Rogers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:derogers334@...\">derogers334@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nThat&#39;s a play style decision, not a numbers one.  I&#39;m speaking only to<br/>\nthe numbers.  Minute for minute, Warriors can&#39;t solo as efficiently as<br/>\nother classes can.  Verdant does heavily encourage grouping, so once<br/>\nyou find even one other person to group with, you are enabled to begin<br/>\nignoring certain disadvantages of one class or the other; but sometimes<br/>\nyou&#39;re knocking around alone, and Warriors have a tougher time doing<br/>\nthat than other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re not so far behind. I&#39;ve heard the number 25% less mentioned a<br/>\nfew times; if true, it&#39;s significant, but not massively so.  25% of 100<br/>\nis only 25, which isn&#39;t very much from a high level mob.  25% of 1000<br/>\nis 250, which is a larger number (but still the same fraction); but,<br/>\nagain, 250 isn&#39;t so terribly much when considered against the damage<br/>\noutput of a high level mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, if you say so.  With the Paladin, the heals do make a difference<br/>\nin downtime.  The reason my other character is a Troll Warrior is for<br/>\nregen; one of my main goals in EQ is to minimize downtime between<br/>\n&#39;action&#39;.  Whether grouped or solo, both characters have something they<br/>\ncan use without looking to anyone else to reduce their downtime.  If I<br/>\nknew I always had a healer available, I&#39;d play an Ogre instead of a<br/>\nTroll; but because you can&#39;t always depend on having a heal present, I<br/>\nplay with Regen when I go Warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors would be better off if bandages weren&#39;t so *damn* expensive,<br/>\nIMO.  Bandages should go for 1sp each; they&#39;re just rags that&#39;ve been<br/>\nwashed and sterilized in hot water, after all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve found kick to be almost as good as bash, you&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; be suprised at how often a 15 point kick will<br/>\n&gt; disrupt a caster.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kick does more damage, but has a markedly lower percentage chance to<br/>\ndisrupt the casting.  Bash will far more often interrupt the spell. <br/>\nVs. NPC wizards, for example, this is damn critical.  I use kick with<br/>\nmy Troll to finish off fleeing opponents when they&#39;re almost dead; but<br/>\nuse Slam most all the time for the stun chance.  After having been<br/>\nstunned all the time by everything *I* fight, it&#39;s nice to watch a mob<br/>\nstand there for a few seconds while you whack on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; EXACTLY warriors tank, paladins attempt to tank. <br/>\n&gt; The damage either deals is minimal, both are in the<br/>\n&gt; party for one reason....to keep the casters alive<br/>\n&gt; long enough to kill the mobs.  So what would be<br/>\n&gt; better, a tank that can absorb all the damage with<br/>\n&gt; fewer heals required by the cleric, or a semi-tank<br/>\n&gt; that requires more heals from the cleric, thus more<br/>\n&gt; of a chance the monster will jump the cleric?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re looking for a &quot;X class is the best, period&quot; answer in this<br/>\ndebate, I seriously doubt you&#39;ll find it.  Verdant has done a pretty<br/>\ngood job of balancing the classes; there really isn&#39;t any one perfect,<br/>\nor &#39;best&#39; class.  Warriors have pros and cons, as do the warrior<br/>\nsubclasses, as do the Mages, as do the mage subclasses.  Each has a<br/>\nstyle of play that&#39;s either slightly or massively different from the<br/>\nother.  It comes down to personal preference and available resources.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples:<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors have to pair with a Cleric (or any mage subclass with healing<br/>\nspells, or even a Paladin, who also has healing); because otherwise the<br/>\ndowntime after fights will catch up with them.  Even pairing with other<br/>\nWarriors, or with Wizards/Magicians won&#39;t work around this; Warriors<br/>\nwill have to have a healer present to counteract their innate<br/>\ndisadvantage of requiring healing at the higher levels.  SKs are in<br/>\nthis boat too; they get tricks, but no heals; and so need the healing<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladins can self-heal, which enables a Paladin to fairly efficiently<br/>\nteam without a healer present.  After my favorite pairing<br/>\n(Paladin/Wizard), my next most favorite pairing is (Paladin/Warrior);<br/>\nbecause we&#39;re both solid melee combatants, and the Paladin can keep<br/>\nboth topped off.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut again, it&#39;s just a matter of style and resources present.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2 tanks, why do you need a paladin?  More than 2<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See above; Paladin acts as second mini-cleric.  Just as 2 warriors help<br/>\nspread the tanking between themselves (reducing the danger and overall<br/>\nHP load that would be more onerous to a single tank), a Paladin helps<br/>\nspread the healing load on the single cleric, yet doesn&#39;t force the<br/>\nparty to have a second guy (second cleric) standing around waiting for<br/>\nthe tanks to drop.  A Paladin can swing with the warriors and then step<br/>\nback to heal, then step back in.  It splits the difference between a<br/>\n3rd tank and a cleric nicely, IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I like having tanks/fighters along; any full group I formed up<br/>\nwould preferably have 3 fighter classes present, and *at least* 1<br/>\nWarrior.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But to sum up, paladins sacrifice so much melee<br/>\n&gt; ability for so little casting ability which<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m confused where you&#39;re getting this &#39;sacrifice so much melee<br/>\nability&#39; thing from?  Paladin combat skills are level with Warriors&#39;. <br/>\nThe only main difference is at which point a particular skill shows up<br/>\n(no kick or dual wield, and everything else 3-5 levels after the<br/>\nWarrior receives it), and the lower hps.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s ok to not like a particular class; I hate rogues and druids, for<br/>\nexample.  But there&#39;s a difference between simply disliking a class for<br/>\nastetic or personal opinion reasons, and the class flat out being<br/>\ninferior.  No class in EQ is flat out inferior.  Each is simply tuned<br/>\nin a certain way.  You find what best suits your own natural<br/>\ninclinations as a player, and off ya go!<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWhere do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\nAt ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
