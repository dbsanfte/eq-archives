Some people just don&#39;t want to know where to<br/>\nget these things :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to answer your question about Drosco.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWarning *spoiler*.....scroll down to find out what quest Drosco is <br/>\nconnected to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems like ol&#39; Drosco was a member of the Bloodsabers<br/>\n(the group in the sewers that worships Bertox).  One of the<br/>\nNPCs in the Shrine of Bertox in the sewers will tell you that<br/>\nDrosco has been leading the guards to the Shrine and that<br/>\nhe must be killed.  I believe you return the letter or the <br/>\namulet to the NPC to solve the quest.  Note that this will<br/>\nonly work for evil aligned characters.  If you are good, you<br/>\nwill have NO chance to make it to the Shrine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tmark mark[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:markerob@...\">markerob@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tWednesday, June 09, 1999 2:14 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] [warrior_eq]  Charisma necklaces spoiler<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: mark mark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:markerob@...\">markerob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if everyone knows about this but I&#39;ll post it just in case.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Drosco in the Qeynos aquiducts has a +5 to char medal on him,and he is an <br/>\n&gt; easy kill. Prob lev 8 or so. It is a lore item though, so you will not be <br/>\n&gt; able to get more than one. It is better to enter the sewers in the pool<br/>\n&gt; near <br/>\n&gt; the qeynos bank, that is closer to his spawn.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is also a nesting rat down there that has a gold necklace +3 to <br/>\n&gt; charisma. I don&#39;t know what quest it is related to, but it is not a lore <br/>\n&gt; item so you could prob get more than one (not sure), anyway the rat is a <br/>\n&gt; very easy kill.  Prob lev 4-6.  If anyone knows what quest this is for<br/>\n&gt; send <br/>\n&gt; me a post,  curious.....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just for everyones information.....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Arathorne, Warrior of Clan Dolald<br/>\n&gt;       Solsek Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
