This impacted ALL \n  classes &amp; not just warriors. To be honest in 5 hours of Howling Stones \n  last night Ididn&#39;t notice the difference (i.e. with my Bloodpoint &amp; \n  werewolf form I still saw plenty of agro).<br>3) Warriors were only &quot;useless&quot; \n  the first 6 months of the games existence...I know I experienced it first hand \n  (same armor, weapons &amp; hps as everyone else with zero distinguishing \n  skills) .&nbsp; These days with decent warr specific armor &amp; weapons we \n  tank very well at most levels.<br>4) The idea that warriors don&#39;t contribute \n  significant offensive damage is an old idea.&nbsp; With the uber hps high \n  level MOBs the damage we contribute over time is quite significant.<br>5) \n  Raising the defensive caps for the other classes actually makes them stronger \n  in the groups I play in.&nbsp; That means my groups survive more. I kind of \n  like that.<br>6) The mid 30s-40s is a tough spot for warriors.&nbsp; Mostly \n  because the other tank classes (Rangers/SKs in particular) have similar agro \n  capability to ourselves at this point but little experience in the value of \n  their role in a group.&nbsp; By the mid 40s very few Rangers, SKs &amp; \n  Pallies are actively trying wrest agro away from a warrior...at least if they \n  have any brains.<br><br>regards<br><br>Flair Shieldrender<br>54 Champion \n  Fennin Ro<br><br>James Wofford wrote:<br>\n  <blockquote\n type=\"cite\"><pre>sigh..
