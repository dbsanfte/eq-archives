I think it should be TOTALLY random unless<br/>\na quest is attached to that item.  So the executioner axe is on a level 45<br/>\nmob in a dungeon.  That means the executioner axe could appear on ANY level<br/>\n45 mob in the game (within reason, necromancers wielding it in Najena<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make sense).  Probably add the restriction that it also must be a<br/>\ndungeon mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only reason I dont like your idea is simply, people will camp at all 4<br/>\nspots.  People WILL spend obscene amounts of time trying to get that item.<br/>\nFor a solid week easy I saw the same people over and over again waiting for<br/>\nthe Tomahawks. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think your solution just spreads camping.  There are people with lots of<br/>\ntime, people WILL spend days at a spot waiting for an item if they know that<br/>\nSOMETIME the item WILL appear here then it WILL be camped.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tJames Wofford[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:James.Wofford@...\">James.Wofford@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tWednesday, May 26, 1999 5:41 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Camping, a solution<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: James Wofford &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:James.Wofford@...\">James.Wofford@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You bring up a valid point.  But the reason for random spawn is to make<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; game more enjoyable to people as a whole.  Also, the spawn would have to<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; completely random in time.  I Just think the spawn should be on maybe 3 or<br/>\n&gt; 4<br/>\n&gt; different types of mobs, all around the same level, all spawning in 3 or 4<br/>\n&gt; different zones, and all spawning at different random intervals.  This<br/>\n&gt; increases the chances the items will be around, and makes it a little more<br/>\n&gt; difficult to camp it.  Also, there should be more of a chance that the<br/>\n&gt; item<br/>\n&gt; is not actually on the mob since there will be more appearing more often.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For instance, you want a rubicite breastplate.  For those of us who know<br/>\n&gt; what and where it comes from, its pretty easy to wait for the spawn to<br/>\n&gt; appear.  Then get together poeple and whack it.  (dont get me wrong, its<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; an easy task to kill... just to wait for it.) On the other hand, if that<br/>\n&gt; same creature spawned in 3 or 4 different zones, and only spawned at<br/>\n&gt; random<br/>\n&gt; intervals...  The campers would either have to spend obscene amounts of<br/>\n&gt; time<br/>\n&gt; sitting on one area hopping to get lucky.  Or they would just have to<br/>\n&gt; travel<br/>\n&gt; back and forth to the 3 or 4 different zones to get their kill.  This also<br/>\n&gt; increases the chance that the spawn will appear when they just left the<br/>\n&gt; zone<br/>\n&gt; they were waiting in and give someone else a chance at it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
