You did the majority of the damage, then he walked up and killed it. I think he was hoping to loot something without really working for it. And then you say he proceeded to send you tells saying &quot;I cant belive you did that&quot;? The next time something ike that happens, just tell them to leave you alone. If they keep it up just /ignore them. <br/>\n<br/>\n                                           Gaab<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHotBot - Search smarter.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotbot.com\">http://www.hotbot.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
