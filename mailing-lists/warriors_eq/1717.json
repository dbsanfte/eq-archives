If all 3 hit(3 waves of 56<br/>\neach) its 164 points a proc and on my warrior I usually resist near all of<br/>\nit.  The aoe is very small and if your in a group w/o an enchanter there is<br/>\nreally no reason not to use it IMO(Unless you have better which isn&#39;t too<br/>\ntough its not that good). But with Garu I can proc 7 to 10 times on a exp<br/>\nmob. (10x 164= 1640dmg, not too bad).  This is coming from a player who&#39;s<br/>\nmain is a 55 enchanter so I am suppose to hate aoe weapons.  Does anyone<br/>\nknow of anyother AOE weapons with a halfway all right proc?  I would love to<br/>\nhave one for my off hand as well as main for those times when no Enchanter<br/>\nis around and for single pulls.<br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Robert Wilbarg [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slu@...\">slu@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 02, 2001 5:11 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@yahoogroups.com\">warriors_eq@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [warriors_eq] Latest Patch<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWow THE Kailyn?

I was laughing when over your story about bronze...I myself<br/>\ndid not get full bronze until lvl 24 (?) if I remember right.
