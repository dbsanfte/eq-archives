This answer is<br/>\nfrom the Archmage Geoffrey Zatkin (GZ) himself<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Is it true that I get more experience when I party?<br/>\n<br/>\nA: Yes. If you kill a monster solo, you get X experience. If a party of two<br/>\nkills a monster, you get X + P (P = Party Experience Addition), divided by<br/>\ntwo (half of that experience for each of you). The bigger your party, the<br/>\nbigger that P is - the Party Experience Addition is larger for three people<br/>\nthen for then for two, and larger for four people then for three, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note, pets do NOT count towards P (2 players and 2 pets still<br/>\ncount as a party of 2).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the link.
