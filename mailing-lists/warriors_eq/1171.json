Can only specialize in<br/>\n&gt; one weapon over the skill of 50 - increased speed, more damage, more<br/>\n&gt; attack with that weapon, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2) Critical Strike - operates much like backstab does for rogue. It has a<br/>\n&gt; recycle time, must use it to raise in level. Does triple damage when<br/>\n&gt; successful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3) Sleep - This would be the equivalent to magic users meditate spell. You<br/>\n&gt; heal at a faster rate, but your entire screen is blacked out (ala blindess<br/>\n&gt; spell).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4) Triple attack. At level 30 you get a chance for a third hit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any of these would be a warrior only skill, and I doubt if it would change<br/>\n&gt; the balance of the game any, only making the warriors more than just a<br/>\n&gt; damage-taker.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Angarth, Sponge of the 15th Tier<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Periissem ni periisem&quot;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
