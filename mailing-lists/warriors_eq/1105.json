Prob lev 8 or so. It is a lore item though, so you will not be <br/>\nable to get more than one. It is better to enter the sewers in the pool near <br/>\nthe qeynos bank, that is closer to his spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a nesting rat down there that has a gold necklace +3 to <br/>\ncharisma. I don&#39;t know what quest it is related to, but it is not a lore <br/>\nitem so you could prob get more than one (not sure), anyway the rat is a <br/>\nvery easy kill.  Prob lev 4-6.  If anyone knows what quest this is for send <br/>\nme a post,  curious.....<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for everyones information.....<br/>\n<br/>\nArathorne, Warrior of Clan Dolald<br/>\n      Solsek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
