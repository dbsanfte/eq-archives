Where is a place tankers are<br/>\nneeded?  I see the people fighting the Sand Giants but I don&#39;t suspect that<br/>\ntankers are needed.  Most of the people fighting it keep the sand giant<br/>\nnon-mobile or have pets that keep the thing busy while they wail on it with<br/>\nmagic.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is good place for us tankers to go 30+?  I personally am a troll shadow<br/>\nknight, but play it mostly like a Warrior =P.  With my halberd, blackened<br/>\niron crown, blackened iron breastplate and banded I make a great tank.<br/>\nHopefully getting store plate soon . . . but anyway...  Since you are<br/>\nbragging about your lvl (jk) =).  Where is a good place that tanks are<br/>\nneeded to lvl up<br/>\n<br/>\n-16 Shadow Knight<br/>\nKazruk da Ugli</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
