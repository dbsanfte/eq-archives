I play CB an awful lot so I relate this from my own exp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact is that a mage will outdamage a warrior every day of the week on a creature he is equipped/able to hit (is it within 4 levels for non-fizzles for wizs?), is standing still & has a tank on them.  The difference in levels doesn&#39;t matter as long as the wiz can hit it.  Whether this right or wrong this is how the game is set up (i&#39;d be inclined to say its still wrong too). You would think that higher level chars would be able to inflict greater damage on dark green cons than someone attacking a yellow or red... <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if you took the same wiz (Mr 18), pitted him against a mid-twenties critter (ala a skeletal monk or something), guess who wins?  The warrior (lvl 36?) because all his (the wizs) spells fizzle while the warrior still hits. So the warrior has a relative advantage over a wizard in &quot;the blind spot&quot; between where the wizards ability ends (i.e. things he can&#39;t hit) & your own capacity to kill (in this case probably creatures of level 22-34).  This of course means you can only outgun people at least 5 or so levels below you as a warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when I&#39;m camping the CB castle I just let Dvinn & Crush kill solo wizards (oh this is fun to watch).  If there is a team of wizards I just leave.  I absolutely hate the KSing &*(&##&#39;s!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ** Original Subject: [warriors_eq] You want to know how weak warriors!

I have some dam good equipment <br/>\n&gt; and am one of the higher warriors on the server... But something happened to <br/>\n&gt; me yesterday that I think highlights the warrior classes weakness... I <br/>\n&gt; decided I wanted to get that new dragoon&#39;s dirk from Dvinn in Crushbone... <br/>\n&gt; So I went there, camped in his room, for those of you that dont know, Dvinn <br/>\n&gt; is about a 25th level DE that is very tough.... He spawned and I attacked <br/>\n&gt; him... low and behold a wizzie... AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE.... ran into the <br/>\n&gt; room, and started blasting him!  Guess what? AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE STOLE <br/>\n&gt; DVINN FROM A 38TH LEVEL WARRIOR!!!!!  Do I need to say ANYTHING else? btw I <br/>\n&gt; was using a zweildahander.... This was the most embarassing thing that has <br/>\n&gt; ever happened to me... I&#39;m sitting there in almost full rubicite, all these <br/>\n&gt; cool items, everyone is looking at me... and then i have the thing stolen <br/>\n&gt; from me by ONE, not a group, but ONE 18th level wizzie......grumbles <br/>\n&gt; something about warriors suck and I am ready to cancel my account...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Eogun on Povar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
