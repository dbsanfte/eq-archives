Rangers (as well as paladins) COULD wear plate. Rangers<br/>\n&gt; just could not cast spells in plate mail. For all intents and purposes the<br/>\n&gt; ranger was EXACTLY the same as a fighter, except a few VERY minor things.<br/>\n&gt; They get 1d8 hit die instead of 1d10 like a fighter, yet they still get<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; constitution bonus. They still get the strength bonus, but were limited in<br/>\n&gt; weapon specialization. They got the same number of attacks per round,<br/>\n&gt; except<br/>\n&gt; at higher levels and even then it was only a half-attack (every other<br/>\n&gt; round). Look closely at any AD&D table except experience. They group<br/>\n&gt; Fighters, Rangers and Paladins all into one group, subclassed the<br/>\n&gt; &#39;fighter-type&#39;. But I am not trying to argue the fact of rangers vs.<br/>\n&gt; warriors vs. paladins..... Just warriors vs. damage of other classes.<br/>\n&gt; maybe<br/>\n&gt; just having some really sweet warrior only weapons would be better than<br/>\n&gt; adding new skills? I mean a warriors strength is his weapon, and warriors<br/>\n&gt; are supposed to have the greatest variety of weapons, right? Oh well, I<br/>\n&gt; guess it&#39;s becoming a moot point. I am starting to get very opinionated<br/>\n&gt; (too<br/>\n&gt; late hehe) about this subject, mainly because I like to solo sometimes and<br/>\n&gt; at 10th level I really couldn&#39;t do that anymore because monsters were<br/>\n&gt; hitting me for twice as much damage as I was hitting them for, and twice<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; fast. Ok, I am done....sorry for the mindless banter    ;-}~<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jynxx<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
