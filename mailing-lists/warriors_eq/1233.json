The main reason I didn&#39;t venture into Blackburrow<br/>\nwas because I was already down on experience, had no friends with me, and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know my way around.  I killed Gnasher who was chasing some<br/>\nunfortunate and buffed some of the newbies.  I even gave out some of the<br/>\nrusty and worn weapons I had acquired in my Karanas travels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI &#39;d like to hunt in East Karanas but I will wait for some friends to join<br/>\nme.

There is a wide variety<br/>\nof levels in there but generally its good for 6 - 10&#39;s I&#39;d say (your other<br/>\nstuff implies that you are quite a bit higher than 10 - esp if you are<br/>\nkilling Gryfawns in EK.) The elites (which are pretty hard but under 15 I<br/>\nthink) stay buried pretty deep. And the trains are pretty easy to avoid.<br/>\nSome groups will make it their business to stop trains. That is they wait<br/>\nfor the train and attack it for the kicks. It&#39;s a great place for groups -<br/>\neven 8, 9, 10&#39;s grouped have a great time in there. And it&#39;s the first<br/>\nreally good (for that level) place to get loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe worst part of BB is that it is buggy if you die in there. I have died<br/>\ndown on the second level (lower) and come back to not be able to find my<br/>\ncorpse. Even the bard says it points to a wall and there is nothing on the<br/>\nother side of the wall. So, I start asking in /ooc and someone tells me<br/>\nthey see it on the first level (upper.) Sometimes the guy who dies cannot<br/>\nsee his own corpse but the guy standing right next to him can. And then<br/>\nsometimes it gets overlayed by terrain textures and if you are lucky - there<br/>\nwill be the toe of a boot or something sticking out that you can click on to<br/>\nloot. Other times you die and your corpse will be on the bottom of the<br/>\nwater - even though you died on land.<br/>\n<br/>\nSnyak.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tom Swift [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 14, 1999 12:04 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [warriors_eq] Week end adventures<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this was meant for my groups mailing list...didn&#39;t mean to spam.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tom Swift &lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>&gt; &gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;  &lt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt; &gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, June 14, 1999 12:49 PM<br/>\nSubject: [warriors_eq] Week end adventures<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI died alot this weekend. Bad luck, incompetence of others, various other<br/>\nreasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also travelled through the Karanas, North, south, and east. I also checked<br/>\nout Queynos hill, Surefall glades and Blackburrow. Didn&#39;t really wander<br/>\nblack burrow at all. Fear of trains and other recent deaths made me choose<br/>\nnot to stay.
