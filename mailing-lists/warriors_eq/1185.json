You rmaking some sense.  Let&#39;s try and put together a<br/>\n&gt; reasonable offer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) Critical Hit as a Warrior only skill (maybe add Monk)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I really like this one.  We need to really define this skill.  Maybe we can<br/>\ncome up with some kind of frequency, damage, and such that we can &quot;suggest&quot;<br/>\nto Verant as what we feel would be nice.  Lets keep it reasonable, we dont<br/>\nwanna ask to be superhuman.  i.e. instant death on success.<br/>\nI was thinking it could do a int or wiz check of some sort, concidering the<br/>\ncritical hit would be from lerning where and how to hit for maximum<br/>\nefficiency.  Also, all of our int and wizdoms should be relatively low to<br/>\nminumize the actuall sucess of this skill.  That way it does not get out of<br/>\nhand.  Maybe a 200point strike on sucess would be enough damage as well.<br/>\nmodified by strength and level of course.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) Remove skill caps for warrior on the following skills:<br/>\n&gt; Offense, Defense,<br/>\n&gt; Dual weild, Dble attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is probably one of the more important addition i would like to see.<br/>\nBut I would also like to see the removal of all weapon skill caps as well.<br/>\nThe way it is now, we cap at 200 on all weapon skills.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3) add specialization in weapons forms (1-handed slash, 2- handed slash,<br/>\n&gt; archery, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is my second in line for preference of what to add.  I think that<br/>\nspecialization similiar to the magic specialization would be great.  the<br/>\nbenefits to specialization would be attack delay reduction, and minor damage<br/>\nincrease.  maybe just double the strength modifier.  more input would be<br/>\ngreat on this.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4) Add a once a day ability Battle Cry (As a barbarian I really like this)<br/>\n&gt; That temporarily enhances  fighting abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This sounds pretty neat, tho i think this would be asking for too much.<br/>\nAlthough it doesnt hurt to add it in.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 5) Increase the effects of strength on damage and stamina on healing, but<br/>\n&gt; not drastically.  Since these are primary attributes for a warrior this<br/>\n&gt; should help us out in being more effective in the early stages of<br/>\n&gt; combat and get us off our butts a little faster afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Instead of this, I read someone put a skill called sleep.  this would<br/>\neffectively double our rate of regeneration, but we would be blinded by a<br/>\nblack screen.  I would also say we would have to have some kind of negative<br/>\nto a skill like this other than just being blind.  Maybe it takes us<br/>\nsomething like 5 rounds to come out of a sleep or something.  This would<br/>\nmake the use of it dangerous, tho with a group watching your back, it would<br/>\nbe beneficial.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; what do you think?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think we are getting much closer to something we can present as a<br/>\npettition.  lets just firm things up with solid definitions and a solid<br/>\norder as to what we would like to see implemented, and we are there.  Good<br/>\nwork guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think we have thought about this very logically and tried to keep<br/>\nmost of the requests within a balanced boundry of game play.<br/>\n<br/>\nDyvim Kincaid<br/>\nStormriders of Cazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
