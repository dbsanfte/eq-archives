No problem, Rallos Zek gave me the power to start anew and <br/>\nrebuild my weath until I now have half banded and half ring mail, a combine <br/>\nlong sword, a fine steel long sword and a fine steel 2H sword.<br/>\n<br/>\nSH** - It is going to take a whole lot longer to get that stuff back if I <br/>\nlose it.  Better recover my body at lunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw: Will someone please help me get painbringer?  tehehehe, ok, I know a <br/>\n16th rank warrior wont last long in Sol B, but I will tag along :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of Rallos Zek;<br/>\n<br/>\nPatty of Halas<br/>\nusername: Patricia<br/>\nserver: Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
