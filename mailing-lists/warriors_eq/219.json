I am a little<br/>\nover a bubble away from� 16 and my skills are now 65 for dual wield and 72<br/>\nfor double attack.� My rate of advancement has slowed considerably, I am<br/>\nwondering if I should expect to max these at 80 before I hit 16 or if that<br/>\nis uncommon.<br/>\n�<br/>\nIf I can max them I will likely get myself killed right before i level up in<br/>\norder to buy some more time at 15.<br/>\n�<br/>\nBy the way I am using a combine scimitar and tentacle whip against magical<br/>\nopponents and dual mino axes against non-magical opponents.� My max damage<br/>\nper round is 79, that is double attacks on both weapons with max damage(17)<br/>\nand a max damage kick (11).� <br/>\n�<br/>\nAnd in reference to others questions about faction.� It is easy enough to<br/>\ngain enough faction for the Commonlands vendors to deal with you, just kill<br/>\norcs by the dozens.� I kill every orc I see, pawns, centurions and so on.�<br/>\nYou can get Freeport residents to deal with you by completing the orc<br/>\nslashed belt quest repeatedly.� If you do that tho you faction with the<br/>\nPaladins in North Freeport will get worse.� It is up to you whether West and<br/>\neast freeport are more important to you then North Freeport<br/>\n�<br/>\nBael<br/>\n15th Order<br/>\nIndigo Brotherhood</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
