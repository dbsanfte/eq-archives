There is a &#39;rare&#39; NPC that spawns with the creature who<br/>\ndrops the large bronze (a 26th or 27th level cleric instead of a 22nd or so<br/>\nlevel warrior). This makes the fight very dangerous (a 22nd level paladin,<br/>\n2 24th level warriors, a 24th level ranger, and a 24th level wizard managed<br/>\nthe fight). She also seems to be spawning more often as of late, or at<br/>\nleast was when I finished getting my full set of large bronze at level 24.<br/>\nI started camping that spot at level 21 or 22, now I have to go back to<br/>\nthat zone at 26 to take out a few more special NPC&#39;s there. Large bronze is<br/>\nalso very heavy, a full set, a BBC, and a ash bow tip the scales at about<br/>\n138. This doesn&#39;t leave me much room to carry alot of loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nOglug ~Hand of Chaos~ CT<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage text written by INTERNET:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Only small bronze armor is dropped by DBs.
