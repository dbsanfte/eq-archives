Beginning to think I&#39;m the only woodelf <br/>\nwarrior :) I have been kos since the beginning by the Darven City Guards. <br/>\nAfter oh 12-15 kills I left, made my way to Freeport and other places to do <br/>\nmy levelling. I have swam around to get to unrest but some named npc still <br/>\nfound me by dags cauldron and whacked me. I now WANT to go home. I want to <br/>\ngo to mistmoore. Is it something I said, did, didn&#39;t do? They always say <br/>\nsomething like I&#39;m not a believer?? Of What? Can I raise factions? How?<br/>\nReally sorry for all the questions but I want to go to my homeland and can <br/>\nnot, safely anyway. I&#39;m a woodelf for crying out loud, not a dark race.<br/>\nAny and all help is greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nTan the homeless woodelf.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
