Some people are saying that a group of really<br/>\nhigh levels do not need warriors. I say thats BS my friends always want my<br/>\nwarrior in their group. Not just becuase im company mind you. Because they<br/>\nare spell casters. If im not there, the MOB would latch onto them and<br/>\ninterrupt their casting. <br/>\n<br/>\nSure we could beg verant for one more skill .... critical hit , which is a<br/>\nvery good idea. And i like the idea of it being like ripsote and parry.<br/>\nMakes more sense. But the fact of the matter is this: We are there to<br/>\nprevent our spellcasting buddies from being hit by creatures so that THEY<br/>\ncan dish out the damage. I have never had anyone complain to me and say look<br/>\nman we dont want you in the group anymore cause you doont dish out the most<br/>\ndamage. <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery group needs a good strong warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tWayne Sheppard[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tFriday, June 11, 1999 10:26 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Warriors vs Wizards<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Many of the Warriors here have complained that they cannot do damage as<br/>\n&gt; fast<br/>\n&gt; as a Wizard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now all of you real life ninjas and steel sword swinging fools just calm<br/>\n&gt; down.  Read carefully.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Warriors get to wear platemail and have many more hps than a Wizard.<br/>\n&gt; Warriors also have a higher Offense, Defense, and Weapon skills.  This all<br/>\n&gt; means that a Warrior can stand toe to toe against an NPC.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now lets make a Warrior have the same ability to deal damage as a Wizard.<br/>\n&gt; Now we would have a class that has the best armor, the highest combat<br/>\n&gt; skills, the most hp&#39;s AND the ability to deal the most damage.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why would anyone want to play a Wizard if a Warrior could do as much<br/>\n&gt; damage<br/>\n&gt; AND be able to take blows in melee?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wayne<br/>\n&gt; PS - When someone says that a Warrior should be able to deal as much<br/>\n&gt; damage<br/>\n&gt; as fast as a Wizard I immediately realize this person doesn&#39;t have a clue<br/>\n&gt; about game balance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Have you entered ONElist&#39;s &quot;Grow to Give&quot; program?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Deadline is June 19.
