I am a warrior in her 25th season, and generally use my <br/>\nlangseax of wolves for my 2H weapon (normally get hits in the 40s and once a <br/>\ncrit of 99), but I get my 1H skills max&#39;ed out for the better weapons I hope <br/>\nto get in the future.  It also seems to help my taunt when I am using dual <br/>\nlangseax 1H swords and taunting, that almost always gets the mob off a <br/>\ncaster no matter what spells he is using.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in closing.  Keep your 1H and 2H skills max&#39;ed along with slam/bash and <br/>\nkick and keep on fighting!<br/>\n<br/>\nPatricia Bryan<br/>\nPrincess of the Bryan Dynasty<br/>\nDynasty Guild, Bristlebane Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
