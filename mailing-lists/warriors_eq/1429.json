This is a board for<br/>\nWARRIORS, not clerics. I am sorry if I am offending anyone by saying this,<br/>\nbut please keep your cleric opinions to yourselves. If I wanted to hear<br/>\nabout the virtues of playing a cleric vs. playing a warrior I would have<br/>\njoined a cleric board. Last time I looked the list was called &#39;Warriors_eq&#39;<br/>\nand had nothing to do with Clerics. If you have fun playing a cleric out<br/>\nthere, be down...have all the fun you want. Just don&#39;t tell me that I don&#39;t<br/>\ndo anything because I am a warrior because even with all your heals you<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t be half as vital in a group as I am. Without a warrior to save your<br/>\narse from getting hit by that 31st level mob you&#39;d be dead in 7 seconds<br/>\nflat...well maybe 10 if you got a heal in there. Bottom line: Don&#39;t come to<br/>\nmy board telling me I suck, cause it&#39;s gonna tick me (and a lot of other<br/>\nGOOD warriors) off really bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nTyveris,<br/>\nBlue Samurai of the Butterfly Rank<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Clancy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcashio3@...\">tcashio3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 13, 1999 10:39 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [warriors_eq] Why I don&#39;t play a Warrior<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Clancy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcashio3@...\">tcashio3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Umm...  whoever says this about clerics is stupid as hell<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At lvl 31 I group consistantly with a cleric.  This class is amazing.  If<br/>\n&gt; you think all they do is heal, you are very very wrong.  Their dd&#39;s do<br/>\nstun<br/>\n&gt; (amazing for rogues) and they can heal better than any other class.  I<br/>\nwant<br/>\n&gt; to see your two druids heal you to full from 1 bar of life<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also if all you fight is yellows and reds you need to rethink your<br/>\nleveling<br/>\n&gt; process.  Whites and blues are excellent to fight if you are in groups<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; handle large numbers well.  Before you say all clerics do is heal, play<br/>\none,<br/>\n&gt; or play with a good one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.
