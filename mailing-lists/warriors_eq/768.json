I am the main person doing this and Ill try to cut out one line<br/>\n&gt;non-sensical posts completely out.  I will also begin to trim the giant<br/>\n&gt;emails as well.  I will also check to see if someone has answered the<br/>\n&gt;question or made a comment I was going to make from now on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think the main reason you will see lots of posts from me in a row is that<br/>\n&gt;I live in a different time zone.  When you guys are asleep im at work<br/>\n&gt;reading the list.  Therefore when you wake up in the morning you will see<br/>\n&gt;lots of emails from me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thats not an excuse but one of the reasons why you will see a lot of emails<br/>\n&gt;from me in one chunk and then none for a 24 hour stint.  Ill try and cut<br/>\n&gt;back, but I really like this list and perhaps I get to excited when <br/>\n&gt;replying<br/>\n&gt;:)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
