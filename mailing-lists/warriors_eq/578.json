I do not die very<br/>\noften and do not understand how people can flaunt 200pp for items when<br/>\ni&#39;ve never even seen that much money before. My guess is that the people<br/>\nwho have all this money either have no lives, playing all day long, dying<br/>\na lot, and camping item spots to pay for other item spots. All this<br/>\ninflation is bullshit and once we start, as a group, helping one another<br/>\nout, it will all phase down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; mino axe now.  But for things like a BBC, SBH, or Tomahawk, why drive the<br/>\n&gt; price down and ruin the worth of the item.  Half the fun in the game is<br/>\n&gt; going and getting something for yourself.  Buying items is definitely a part<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>SBH spawns about every 2 or 2 and a half hours on the Shralok there, and<br/>\nas long as you have a high level wizard or two in your group, you can<br/>\noutgun the people. Is that worth 125pp or whatever it&#39;s going for? I&#39;m<br/>\nsorry, but i can&#39;t make 125pp in 2 and a half hours. Nor can i make 125pp<br/>\nin a week. I&#39;ve never made that much money, so i don&#39;t know how long it<br/>\nwould take.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; tried to get a BBC for about a month before I gave up because of campers and<br/>\n&gt; kill stealers.  Hard to express the anger you feel when you sit killing and<br/>\n&gt; waiting for 3 plus hours only to have another group move in and steal the<br/>\n&gt; kill to gain what you have been patiently waiting for.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The Shadowknight that spawns with the BBC spawns every 30 minutes and<br/>\neveryone has to be in the main room to avoid the anticamp. If there is a<br/>\ngroup there doing it wrong, explain it to them, and if you do it right,<br/>\nthey will be gone in half an hour with a BBC in their possesion and you<br/>\ncan wait your half an hour to get one too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Im off the track here.  The point is, why drive the cost of something down?<br/>\n&gt; You should want to keep the items worth something until the majority of<br/>\n&gt; people in the game can get them for themselves.  Otherwise you will see lvl<br/>\n&gt; 3 and 4 characters running around with weapons that are level 15 or 20.  And<br/>\n&gt; they only paid 4plat for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And this is exactly my point. I, at level 19, can get a majority of the<br/>\ngood weapons in the game with a good party if given the chance. Everyone<br/>\nwould get a chance if we figured out the system for these items. The price<br/>\nshould not be for the people who spend 24 hours a day, 7 days a week<br/>\nplaying. It should be something that the people who only have a couple<br/>\nhours a day to play can attain too. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nNick</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
