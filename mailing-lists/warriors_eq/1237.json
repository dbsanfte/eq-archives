He spawned and I attacked<br/>\nhim... low and behold a wizzie... AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE.... ran into the<br/>\nroom, and started blasting him!  Guess what? AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE STOLE<br/>\nDVINN FROM A 38TH LEVEL WARRIOR!!!!!  Do I need to say ANYTHING else? btw I<br/>\nwas using a zweildahander....
