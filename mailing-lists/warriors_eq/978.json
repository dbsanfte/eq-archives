I have heard too many <br/>\nhorror stories of people that came back for their corpse and it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthere anymore (the Xegony crash comes to mind, don&#39;t know how<br/>\ncorpses are handled when the server crashes but I really wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to chance it).<br/>\n<br/>\nAngarth, Warrior of the 15th Tier<br/>\n&quot;Periissem ni periisem&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tPatricia Halas[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tThursday, June 03, 1999 9:44 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] From the diary of a warrior princess<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Patricia Halas &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Got up this morning camped just outside of the entrance to Guk.  As I was <br/>\n&gt; putting my stuff away I was think about the good times I has with my guild<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; mates hunting frogs in the dungeon.  I had never been to Guk and it was a <br/>\n&gt; lot of fun.  Well mostly fun, that one train that wiped out the entire<br/>\n&gt; party <br/>\n&gt; was no fun, especially the walk back from the high pass.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So now I was along in the swamps and backing my stuff.  Darn backpacks<br/>\n&gt; were <br/>\n&gt; heavy and as I put them all one I realized I was encumbered now the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Spirit <br/>\n&gt; of the Bear&quot; had left me (141/130).  Time to go sell.  Maybe there is a<br/>\n&gt; spot <br/>\n&gt; in South Ro I could sell, if not there I knew I could sell at the inn in <br/>\n&gt; Oasis.  Oasis would be good.  There I could get some experience killing <br/>\n&gt; crocodiles and caimans.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So adjusting my backpacks I started off running around the side of the<br/>\n&gt; swamp <br/>\n&gt; to the pass leading to South Ro.  An easy trot saw a couple of frogs and<br/>\n&gt; an <br/>\n&gt; alligator or two, but nothing that looked worth hunting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once I zoned to South Ro I decided to look around a bit to see what was <br/>\n&gt; around.  Just a bunch of Orcs, had to kill a couple just because, but<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; get any experience.  It was also kind of fun to walk straight through the <br/>\n&gt; Orc camps since they were too scared of me to do anything.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Well enough of this&quot; I thought and turned to go into the desert.  Time to<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; sell my loot and get to killing crocodiles.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As I was crossing the desert I came across a couple of Troll and a dark<br/>\n&gt; elf <br/>\n&gt; killing dervishes.  Stopped to check things out for a second and to see<br/>\n&gt; what <br/>\n&gt; the camp looked like.  As I was checking things out I saw a skeleton <br/>\n&gt; standing out in front of the tents all by himself.  Well, figured I would <br/>\n&gt; get closer and check him out, might be some good experience for me on the <br/>\n&gt; way to Oasis.  Big mistake, wasn&#39;t just any skeleton but a dry bone<br/>\n&gt; skeleton <br/>\n&gt; that didn&#39;t like barbarians.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The trolls jumped in to help me, but even with my dual long swords flying <br/>\n&gt; and the trolls beating on the skeleton, I soon found myself laying on my <br/>\n&gt; back again wondering why I ever got so close to the skeleton.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well soon after that I found myself back in the high hold pass naked<br/>\n&gt; except <br/>\n&gt; for my kilt.  As I was standing up I got a message from Rallos Zek, the<br/>\n&gt; once <br/>\n&gt; I was hoping not to here - &quot;You have failed me once again young barbarian,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; no longer can you claim the 16th Rank of warrior, you have lost a level<br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; are now 15 again.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Drat and darn, not only did I lose a level, had a long walk ahead of me,<br/>\n&gt; but <br/>\n&gt; all my spare stuff from the bank vault was on my body.  Oh well, back to<br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; battle, now I really had to go back to Oasis as soon as possible to make <br/>\n&gt; 16th Rank again.  Pissing off Rallos Zek is never a good idea.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I ran as fast as I can, past ghouls, giant spiders, sand giants and<br/>\n&gt; orcs. <br/>\n&gt;   Finally I was back in the desert of South Ro, hugging the wall, and <br/>\n&gt; looking for my body.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Running south to the dervish tents, I suddenly heard the sound no one<br/>\n&gt; wants <br/>\n&gt; to hear.  Even the bravest warrior blanches in fear when she hears the <br/>\n&gt; pounding footsteps of a giant behind her.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A sand giant hits you for 96 points<br/>\n&gt; A sand giant hits you for 87 points<br/>\n&gt; You are stunned...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well that hurt.  Once I found myself back in the Pass I decided that was <br/>\n&gt; enough for the day.  Looking around I found myself a nice flat rock to<br/>\n&gt; rest <br/>\n&gt; on and lay down to camp.  Good thing I am a barbarian and the chill air<br/>\n&gt; this <br/>\n&gt; high didn&#39;t bother me.  Guess I will go get my body later tonight.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of Rallos Zek;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Patty of Halas<br/>\n&gt; username: Patricia<br/>\n&gt; server: Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
