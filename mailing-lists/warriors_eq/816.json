My primary reason for looking to switch<br/>\nfrom longsword primary and mino axe secondary isn&#39;t speed or damage its<br/>\nSTAMINA.  There is a current thread running on this topic - be sure you<br/>\ncheck it out.  Mino axes are HEAVY, and weilding two weapons already takes a<br/>\nlot of stamina.  Combine this with the fact that the length of your fights<br/>\nincreases with the level of the MOB and you run into quite a few situations<br/>\nwhere you are runnng too low on mana.<br/>\nLast weekend I was soloing some orcs in the south part of Oasis while I was<br/>\nwaiting for some friends to come so we could hunt some crocs.  I engaged a<br/>\nlone orc and pulled him down to the beach.  While I was fighting this orc<br/>\n(and doing pretty well - he was conning blue) I heard the DREADED sound of<br/>\nan approaching giant (You know the sound if you&#39;ve heard it! It&#39;s one of the<br/>\nfew things that gives me an adrenaline rush EVERY time in EQ!).  Not wanting<br/>\nto be squished like a bug, I tried to take myself and the orc closer to the<br/>\nzone boundary - without getting into the ocean - and I got a LITTLE too<br/>\nclose to the OTHER orc that was in the camp.  To make a long story short I<br/>\nmanaged to avoid the Giant, but I couldn&#39;t flee the orcs without running<br/>\ninto the giant.  I killed off the first orc and still had around half my<br/>\nhealth...I ran out of stamina before I ran out of health with the second<br/>\norc, and I was pretty damn confused!  You see I was SWINGING, but I wasn&#39;t<br/>\nHITTING anything.  I checked SEVERAL timesto make sure I was still in attack<br/>\nmode and properly targeted (you guys know that feeling??) and then FINALLY<br/>\nrealized I was just plain ol&#39; tuckered out.  Anyway it came down to the last<br/>\ncouple of blows, and I DID die...but I learned a lesson too.  Mino axes are<br/>\npretty cool (and I love the way they look - 2 axes is even cooler!), but<br/>\nswords are much less demanding on your stamina.<br/>\nRight now I am trying to see if I can improve my Piercing skill (I think its<br/>\naround 20, lol!) by sticking a Fine Steel Rapier in my secondary weapon<br/>\nslot.  I&#39;ll let you all know how that works!<br/>\nThanks fer your time...sorry if I rambled!<br/>\nGrukklukk of Bristlebane, lvl 15 basher<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tom Swift [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 26, 1999 12:51 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [warriors_eq] weapon ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Tom Swift&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou missed the recent discussion on that very topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep your 2 hander for dealing with blue creatures....keep your skill up.<br/>\nAs far as 1hs, use the longsword in your primary slot and the mino in your<br/>\nsecondary.
