I refuse to camp <br/>\nfor a lore item or whatever, but my friends and I will frequently camp <br/>\naround a spawn area and Kill Kill Kill.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can find us loitering around the Drevs in West Commons, the second <br/>\npillar in Oasis, or the Orcs in HH.  You just have to work out a deal with <br/>\nthe groups already there.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost groups will share.  I find it also handy to give other groups a helping <br/>\nhand (if they will let me).  Gives me practice using my 2H sword, and since <br/>\nthey are blasting away with magic there is no way I will get the experience. <br/>\n  Then the next Orc pops up and my group destroys him and we get the <br/>\nexperience/loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nGroups that work together have fun and a chance to share the <br/>\nexperience/loot.  Groups that spend there time stealing others kills are <br/>\nprobably not happy in the long run and are better off ignored.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my lowly opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of Rallos Zek;<br/>\n<br/>\nPatty of Halas<br/>\nusername: Patricia<br/>\nserver: Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
