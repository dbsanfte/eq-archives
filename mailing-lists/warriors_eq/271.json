I know at level one<br/>\n&gt; theres<br/>\n&gt; not much difference between the standard stamina and a bumped up stamina,<br/>\n&gt; but as the levels progress theres a BIG difference.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Example compare your vanilla troll warrior and vanilla barbarian warrior.<br/>\n&gt; At level 20 the troll will have aprox 780hp at level 22 the barbarian will<br/>\n&gt; have aprox 666hp.  Im taking this information from 2 people I know.  So<br/>\n&gt; obviously the higher natural stamina does really affect hp over time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So has anyone figured out a ration? Or any word from Verant how it<br/>\n&gt; actually<br/>\n&gt; works?  At the moment all we have (which is fine) is that more stamina =<br/>\n&gt; more hp at HIGHER levels.  The higher the levels become the greater the<br/>\n&gt; divergence.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wonder if people would mind telling us there stamina, level and hp?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My character has a stamina of 75 and at level 18 she has exactly 500hp. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
