That&#39;s a bunch of bull! It sucks even more when he does it 6 more times. I know this falls on the line of steal killing but I just thought it is a little unfair that spell casters can cause so much damage. I know it all evens out with warriors getting the hps and being able to take the hits and all. It just seems that you can be a spell caster and just wander around blasting others hard work and getting the (un)experience. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just one warrior&#39;s thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone share my option or frustrations?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nNumok lvl 12 Ogre Warrior<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGet your FREE Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mailcity.lycos.com\">http://mailcity.lycos.com</a> <br/>\nGet your PERSONALIZED START PAGE at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://my.lycos.com\">http://my.lycos.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist:  bringing the world together.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\nJoin a new list today!<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
