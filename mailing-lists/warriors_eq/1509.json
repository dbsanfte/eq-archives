A well balanced group<br/>\n&gt; can take multiple reds/yellow/blues/greens.  The best thing about<br/>\n&gt; this kind<br/>\n&gt; of group is the tanks can distribute tha damage very well between them<br/>\n&gt; (providing they know what they are doing.)  And their is a cleric to help<br/>\n&gt; tank as well.  The clerics would alternate acting as a 3rd tank while one<br/>\n&gt; would just sit back heal/dd.  When he was out of mana, that cleric would<br/>\n&gt; take the place of the first tanking and then he would take over as healer.<br/>\n&gt; the mages.. Well they just blew things up efficiently.  Rarely did we (the<br/>\n&gt; warriors) have to try to pull something off the nukers cause they<br/>\n&gt; burned to<br/>\n&gt; fast.  Its a good feeling to get 3 levels in 2 days with this<br/>\n&gt; kind of group<br/>\n&gt; WITHOUT powerleveling or being lame.  The bottom line was<br/>\n&gt; downtime was VERY<br/>\n&gt; minimal and we could take very large groups of critters NON-stop.  As for<br/>\n&gt; grouping with the Enchanters... You havent played a group until you group<br/>\n&gt; with higher level enchanters.  Their debuff/charms are simply INCREDIBLE.<br/>\n&gt; If I were to pull absolutely too many mobs, he would just charm<br/>\n&gt; one and turn<br/>\n&gt; it from 10vs6 to 9vs7.  As well as slow up the attackers so they<br/>\n&gt; are acting<br/>\n&gt; half as fast.  Less attacks equals less damage to tanks equals less mana<br/>\n&gt; used by clerics equals more life for the tanks equals more damage they can<br/>\n&gt; inflict equals less mana used by the mages.  Sorry for the run on<br/>\n&gt; sentance,<br/>\n&gt; but you get the picture.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps you a bit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dyvim Kincaid<br/>\n&gt; Warrior of Cazic Thule.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Trent Carroll [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trent@...\">trent@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 20, 1999 8:59 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [warriors_eq] best grouping<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Trent Carroll&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trent@...\">trent@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In your experience what has been the best group make-up that you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have been a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; part of?  If possible give a little input on why it was the best group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make-up.  I&#39;m concerned here with character classes, not level.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Interested<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in group sizes anywhere between 2 and 6.  Of particular<br/>\n&gt; interest to me is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what it&#39;s like to group with an enchanter.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve mostly played in very small groups.  I usually play with one other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; person in my group.  A cleric was nice to group with in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pre-teens since<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he did comparable melee damage and could keep me healed up.  In<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the teens I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; began grouping with a magician.  He used a water elemental for<br/>\n&gt; a pet which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is supposed to be about the equivalent of an equal level troll<br/>\n&gt; warrior.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would let the elemental tank for me and I would stand at that perfect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; distance where the mob attacks the elemental and not me, yet I<br/>\n&gt; could still<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get my hits in.  Since the elemental regains HP at about 10<br/>\n&gt; &gt; points per round<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as opposed to my two it meant less down time.  At level 12 the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; magician had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a DD spell that did 90+ damage, very nice when it was needed to finish<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something off quick.  He could also summon bandages so I get<br/>\n&gt; healed up to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 50% for free.  As a two man team the magician was much better than the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cleric because we could dish out much more damage in less time,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pet taking much of the damage healing was not really necessary.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As an added<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bonus the pet could play the part of sacrificial lamb while we<br/>\n&gt; zoned when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things got nasty.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kindrael<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Congrats to GROW TO GIVE winners, ZENtertainment & ROTInews!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check out ONElistï¿½s new program, FRIENDS & FAMILY.
