I also found at lvl 9 or so I could solo clockworks, then turn in the black boxes for 1 to 12 silver a pop, even when partyied with one healer, i was lvling once every hour to 2 hours and made a couple plat every 30 min or so, depending on how many clocks i killed inbetween skirmishes with eles.  Another good place from 12 to 18 or so is the sisters camp in lesser fay, they drop bronze weapons alot and have some cash on them.  at 12 to 15 you can also solo death beetles in unrest for 1 and a half gold or so each for thier carapaces.  After this you can party in unest for some mad bronze armor and other cool items, such as words and other research items and bronze weapons, I leave unrest now after every 3 hours and get around 20 plat average, sometimes i get nothing sometimes i get a couple bronze items, plus the measly cash you get from the monsters.<br/>\nKrause, warrior of kaladim</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
