Blackend is lower AC and much <br/>\nheavier than ringmail.....but it does look cool :)  which is why I&#39;ve a got <br/>\na full set myself :)<br/>\n<br/>\nps.  to me, the point of dual wielding it to get a large number of attacks.  <br/>\nWielding a weapon with the delay of a good 2h sword kinda defeats the <br/>\npurpose.  Not to mention that your dual attack is based in part on the speed <br/>\nof your primary weapon.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, the mino is a GREAT weapon for <br/>\n1h slash, but when you hit 15th and get double attack and dual wield there <br/>\nare much better weapons to be used, IMO<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Dean Boyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gino_14@...\">gino_14@...</a>&gt; 5.24.99 9:35:39 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Dean Boyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gino_14@...\">gino_14@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n   When I get Duel Weild I&#39;m prob. going to go with the best Mino. Batlle <br/>\nAxe<br/>\ncouse it does a wooping 8dmg/35delay and with my secondary wepon I&#39;ll prob.<br/>\nuse a Fine Steel Long Sword OR a barbed whip OR a combine long sword.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S Could someone please tellme the specs. on the Fine Stell Long Sword,<br/>\nCombine Long Sword and Barbed Whip?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   How do you cheack my skill in sta. and how do I get that skill up.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S I also found that using kick often in a row draws your sta. down, but if<br/>\nyou use bash is dosn&#39;t seem to bring sta. down as much as kick.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I&#39;ve just got Perry skill and put 3 skill points into it.  Is this<br/>\nautomatic and I&#39;ve never seen it been used.  Is this skill even working and<br/>\nis the skill going up?<br/>\n<br/>\n   I&#39;ve just gotten Blacken Armor and replaced it with my banded and <br/>\nringmail<br/>\narmor!  Man, the weight is so much lighter and the AC is much more better!<br/>\nI suggest any lvl 12+ people go to the RiverVale area hunt though goblines<br/>\nand get that armor! + is looks so cool!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAre you?
