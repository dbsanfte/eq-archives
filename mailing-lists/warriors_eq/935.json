On Bertoxxolus banded tunic used to be 25p and now its about 18p  all other banded prices have eroded similarily because there is more banded available.  Prices on ringmail are barely above what the store will buy the pieces for.  I am outfitted in alot of ringmail at an average price per piece of only 6p.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust be patient those prices will come down....and then you will be mad cause you can&#39;t make any money selling it because everyone sells it so cheap.<br/>\n<br/>\nBael<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: John Cynkar &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ref145@...\">ref145@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Wednesday, May 26, 1999 7:39 PM<br/>\n    Subject: [warriors_eq] Armor<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Want to know something hard to find.  Medium Bronze.  I am a lvl 13 warrior half elf.  More medium bronze should be added to the game.  Hmmm, 25p or less for each piece of small bronze, except for the breast plate, 45p.  Also easy to get.  Medium bronze, 60p for each piece, probally 60p+ for tunic.  I am sorry, but at my lvl, that money is hard to come by, but not as hard as the armor.  What really drives me up the wall is when I see lvl 7 guys with full medium bronze, their excuse, either someone gave it to them, or they have been reselling armor ( A lvl 7 with lots of medium Bronze told me he had made 300p offa reselling, and had 1000p coming from a friend, so he could start Smithing.)  Jeez.<br/>\n     <br/>\n            Dubas, of the 13th rank.  Mithaniel Marr.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
