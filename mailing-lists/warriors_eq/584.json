When I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-708129416\">I&#39;m quite sure.  This is how I tested it.  I challenged someone to a duel, they accepted.  I let them hit me without turning on autoattack myself.  When I reposted I would swing the weapon I had in my primary weapon slot.  I treid with 3 different weapons in my hand, first a demon claw....each time I reposted I would swing it, doing between 2 points and 12 points of damage, when I hit.  I tried with my BBC, each time I reposted I would swing the BBC, I did between 24 and 43 (being my max last level when I tested) each time I was able to hit.  I then tried it with a tiny dagger, and sure enough it came up and said hit by non melee for 1 point of damage, which is the normal thing the tiny dagger says.<br/>\n<br/>\n(btw, in one particular round the guy I was dualing got a double attack, both of which I was able to reposte, and I got lucky and actually hit back on both attacks for over 60 points of damage.....not bad for not even turning on my attack, heh)<br/>\n<br/>\nI was really hoping it would be like you said, turning back their damage cuz monsters that are yellow to me typically hit in the high 60s, and some of the reds I fight hit for low 80s, hell, even greens can hit for 40 nowdays.<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw, it was me who posted the info on reposte late last week, I did this test over the weekend helping a 20th lvl warrior buddy test to see if he could do more damage with dual wield or 2h slash....which really wasn&#39;t a fair test since he had only been working on 2h slash for a few lvls and was far from being max so he obviously did more damage dual wielding.<br/>\n<br/>\nand one more thing, if any of you are on veeshan and ever want to test stuff out give Salr a tell, I&#39;m always interested in testing stuff out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slu@...\">slu@...</a>&gt; 5.24.99 6:02:49 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slu@...\">slu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHold on a sec.  Are you sure that your riposte damage is correlated to *your* weapon damage & not the creatures attack (i.e. you are turning its attack back on it)?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome folks posted some research on here a couple of days ago & it didn&#39;t look like the riposte damage was the same as their weapon damage.  It looked like you&#39;d get both your normal swings & a riposte (dual wield) between taunts (measurement of a turn).  Can anyone bear this out?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, this changes the dynamic of your 1h vs 2h argument.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to start a fight here...just curious how this thing works<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ** Original Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Now about 1hs vs 2hs Re: Rangers and warriors<br/>\n&gt; ** Original Sender: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ** Original Date: Mon, 24 May 1999 16:03:25 -0500<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ** Original Message follows... <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Correct, but you only get a single attack of your primary weapon, you do not get a chance for a dual or double attack on a reposte....to my knowledge.  So I can see getting to a point where 2h slash may surpass 1h slash, even against red mobs, because you may be able to get several reposte hits in one round.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; David Rogers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:derogers334@...\">derogers334@...</a>&gt; 5.24.99 3:42:07 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: David Rogers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:derogers334@...\">derogers334@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- Jason Coan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reposte is a counter attack.
