See<br/>\n&gt; below.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Monks and Warriors have similar, but not exactly the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; same AC.  Warriors are always (with proper<br/>\n&gt; equipment)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; approximately 10-30 points higher on AC for each<br/>\n&gt; &gt; given level.  This may seem insignificant, however,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; EQ uses these sorts of tiny differentials as the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; basis for damage calculations.  Given the way AC<br/>\n&gt; &gt; advances (3-5 point increase purely on level alone)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there are easy ways for EQ to &#39;normalize&#39; the AC vs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Offense to determine relative damage levels for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enemies of similar level.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ok, if AC is all that matters, why do a pair of<br/>\n&gt; characters at equal level and Defensive skills have<br/>\n&gt; such vast differences?  One a Ranger in full banded,<br/>\n&gt; the other a Warrior/Paladin/ShadowKnight in full<br/>\n&gt; plate; the Rangers consistently take more damage from<br/>\n&gt; fights than their heavily armored fellow tanks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Still don&#39;t like that test?  Try this one: take *your*<br/>\n&gt; WAR/PAL/SDK and get a full suit of plate to match the<br/>\n&gt; full suit of banded you&#39;re so proud of.  Go fight a<br/>\n&gt; few blue mobs in your banded armor and note the<br/>\n&gt; strength of the blows that connect against you; how<br/>\n&gt; much single shots tend to do, how many low damage<br/>\n&gt; shots you receive, and how much total damage you take<br/>\n&gt; over the fight.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now put on the plate and try another few fights<br/>\n&gt; against similar mobs (level and race).  You should<br/>\n&gt; notice fewer shots dealing maximum damage against you,<br/>\n&gt; more shots doing low damage (2-10 where before it<br/>\n&gt; would have been 40-60 on each connect), and less total<br/>\n&gt; damage at the end of the fight.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You think you&#39;ve found some secret uber-combo (ala<br/>\n&gt; Tekken or something, up-up-down-left-right left and<br/>\n&gt; right punch together to produce the MegaFireball) or<br/>\n&gt; something; this game has shown no instances of such<br/>\n&gt; imbalances.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you truly think they managed to get all the way<br/>\n&gt; through four phases of beta and the past 4-6 months of<br/>\n&gt; final and never notice that plate, as you are<br/>\n&gt; alledging, is useless?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thinking you&#39;ve found some hidden truth; that banded<br/>\n&gt; is marginally (5% or less) effective than Plate but<br/>\n&gt; has a fraction of the weight ... folly.  Sheer folly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Plate matters in a fight.  I&#39;ll take plate armored<br/>\n&gt; tanks over those in banded seven days a week and the<br/>\n&gt; rest of the month too.  I have watched the performance<br/>\n&gt; of Rangers (since they *can&#39;t* have better than<br/>\n&gt; banded) higher than my level for months now; they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; stuck in banded while I&#39;m in plate, and I take less<br/>\n&gt; damage when tanking.  I&#39;ve watched warriors who aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; plate armored yet, and I take less damage than they<br/>\n&gt; when tanking.  And I only have an 80 AGI, so it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But hey, whatever you want to do.  If you&#39;re in my<br/>\n&gt; group though, I won&#39;t appreciate the higher percentage<br/>\n&gt; of the healers&#39; mana you&#39;ll be taking to recover from<br/>\n&gt; the greater damage you&#39;ll be taking.
