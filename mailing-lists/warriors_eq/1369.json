A surprise benefit I found last<br/>\nnight:  I can slam creatures that are immune to normal weapons.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>\ndo this before when wielding only one combine sword (and I don&#39;t have any<br/>\nmagical bracers, wristbands, or gloves).  I notice every so often I will hit<br/>\nfor 14 as well (combines are 6*2 + 1 supposedly, but I do get an extra now<br/>\nand then).  The biggest reason I decided to purchase is combine longswords<br/>\nis the return value.  I paid 54.3 plat for each of them,  and I can come<br/>\nclose to getting that back by selling to another player.  No other magical<br/>\nweapon has a higher return (unless you get them yourself).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAngarth, Warrior of the 18th Tier<br/>\n&quot;Periissem ni periisem&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tPatricia Halas[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tThursday, June 24, 1999 1:06 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Magical Weapon<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Patricia Halas &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am currently in HH collecting extra ringmail to sell in Halas so I can <br/>\n&gt; have enough money to buy a combine longsword but it is getting so boring.<br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; have nevered seen that named gnoll fellow even though I spend most of my <br/>\n&gt; time hunting gnolls.
