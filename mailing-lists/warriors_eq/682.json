When I go to town to sell, or to buy food and water, I always pick up an extra 40 beers.  I&#39;ve noticed that your alcohol tolerance will go up from drinking just 1 beer.....it doesn&#39;t happen every time, but it does happen.  Once my int gets back to normal I&#39;ll drink another.  If we kill a big monster, or win an over whealming fight, I&#39;ll pass a beer to everybody in the group :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m hoping that once my tolerance gets high enough, I&#39;ll be able to drink 2 beers to get the str and sta bounus WITHOUT swaying.....only about 20 now, but slowly going up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody else played around with this?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slu@...\">slu@...</a>&gt; 5.24.99 9:45:32 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slu@...\">slu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all,<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the vein of discussing mystery skills; how the devil does alcohol tolerance work?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me (mine is in mid twenties) that I can just drink more (and gain the extra str & sta & lower int) without the twirls.  If you drink more (with greater tolerance) do you keep getting more str & sta or is there a cap?  If so why bother drinking a ton of booze (especially if you don&#39;t get drunk!)?  Does the lowered int influence the rate you improve skills (I haven&#39;t noticed any difference so far)?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would seem that at high levels this might be handy thing for warriors to have (if you can keep the extra str & sta longer).  Anyone have experience with this?<br/>\n<br/>\nRob Wilbarg aka Flair on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\nJoin a new list today!<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
