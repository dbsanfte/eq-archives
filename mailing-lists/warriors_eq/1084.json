Most high level magicians can create them.<br/>\nDamage 7 delay 26 i believe.  I have been able to keep one in the bank for<br/>\nquit some time.  As soon as you log out with it in your inventory tho, it is<br/>\ngone forever.  At least until you get a mage to make you another one.<br/>\nAnyway, the morale of the story great weapon, but summoned, so find yourself<br/>\na mage to adventure with.  This weapon and a barbed leather whip with cause<br/>\nsome very good damage together.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Dyvim Kincaid<br/>\nStormriders of Cazic Thule<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Tom Swift [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, June 09, 1999 9:14 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Rune Sword<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I would greatly appreciate any info.
