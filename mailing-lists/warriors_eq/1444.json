Now either i was unluckly or i am way under equipped (lvl 30, pgt<br/>\n&gt; + dirk, bronze armour) but i was whipped...i actually got the warlord to<br/>\n&gt; run, and chased him a bit...but the elite was hitting me still, and i<br/>\n&gt; just managed to zone without killing either with only 2 hps left.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; so my question is this...should i have killed the elite first, which is<br/>\n&gt; a green crit? or was staying on the warlord the best thing?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i guess it might depend on my ultimate goal...and my goal then was to<br/>\n&gt; just kill the damn warlord...as i had to goto work in 5 mins...if i had<br/>\n&gt; more time, maybe i should have killed elite, zoned to rest and gone back<br/>\n&gt; for warlord...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But im getting off my question here...if solo, should you take out the<br/>\n&gt; hardest crit first or weakest?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dandrak, Karana (lvl 30)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCampaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nDiscuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
