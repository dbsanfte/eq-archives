Now that doesn&#39;t entirely<br/>\nwork in an online RPG, but Verant&#39;s solution is the next best thing.  Any<br/>\nquest or unique item should not be allowed to be possessed in multiple<br/>\nquantities by a single player.  This way if someone wants to camp the BBC<br/>\nbecause they have it and found out how valuable it is, they can.  But they<br/>\nmust sell theirs before getting another.  It simply removes the<br/>\n&quot;profitability&quot; for camping items from some players.  I think the dwarven<br/>\ntunic should be a lore item as well as the dwarven axes.  I have just come<br/>\nfrom there and people I saw camping these items day after day.  Now I am in<br/>\nthe commonlands or North Ro and these same people are selling multiples of<br/>\nthose items.  They built and inventory of unique items and are now selling<br/>\nthem.  2 of those people were warriors and not mages, which saddens me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think dual PGTs should be allowed any more than a ranger could have<br/>\ndual Ebony Blades or dual Oaken Scimitars.  I don&#39;t particularly like the<br/>\nwhole economy of unique magic weapons and items either.  Making them lore<br/>\nitems and ineligble for trading and selling will go along way to reducing<br/>\ncamping and letting people get these items on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only reason some of these items are so expensive is because high level<br/>\npeople will simply camp these easy to kill NPCs and prevent others from<br/>\nobtaining them.  I watched one group of mages in Crushbone who would watch<br/>\nfor escaping mobs like Crush, the warlord, darish, royal guard, etc.  and<br/>\nwould cast invis on it.  They either knew where the mobs flee to or they<br/>\nwere using some magic to see invisible.  But they would wait till the mob<br/>\nregenerated more than half its hit points and then kill it.  They stole<br/>\nthese kills in the most dishonorable way for pure profit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, now I am ranting and will get off my soapbox. But I do feel pretty<br/>\nstrongly about this topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nBael<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeff Auman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff.auman@...\">jeff.auman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, June 10, 1999 8:20 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [warriors_eq] EQ&#39;Lizer Article<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Jeff Auman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff.auman@...\">jeff.auman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Jim Ramsay wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Those of you dreaming<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of dual wielding Polished Granite Tomahawks can forget it, they are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; pending Lore items now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sorry, this should read:  Those of you who just got two PGT&#39;s, you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;now screwed.
