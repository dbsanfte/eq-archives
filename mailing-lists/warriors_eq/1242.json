Anyone else think this is slightly unfair for<br/>\n&gt;gameplay?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No.  Comparing classes soloing is a waste of time.  The game is not geared<br/>\nfor solo play at higher levels.  Eventually every class will not be able to<br/>\nsolo effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We had kills stolen many many times and nothing frustrates you more than<br/>\n </span></blockquote>bleeding<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;from a mob that is stolen from you in mid fight. We tried getting<br/>\n </span></blockquote>spellcasters into<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;our group, but at our level, most were doing better playing solo. From all<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of this I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;gathered that two things need to be done.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the example you gave, the solo wizards weren&#39;t really solo.  They were<br/>\nletting your group tank for a bit of the damage.  Once your group had<br/>\ndamaged it enough, the wizard would then start blasting and kill-steal it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;One, if Verant wants to give groups a better advantage than solos, then by<br/>\n </span></blockquote>all means<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;allow group damage to overcome the &#39;single greatest damage dealer gets the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>kill&#39;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;rule. Or bump it up somehow. It doesn&#39;t have to be much but for god sakes<br/>\n </span></blockquote>... people<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;having fun as a team should be rewarded for their organization and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>coordination. It<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;requires effort and patience to play well as a team. It requires nearly<br/>\n </span></blockquote>nothing to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;play well alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.  The GROUP that does the most damage should get the kill, not the<br/>\nperson who does the most damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Two, wizzies need to be toned down on solo just a little. I have nothing<br/>\n </span></blockquote>against<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;powerful wizards. I have EVERYTHING against solos who steal other people&#39;s<br/>\n </span></blockquote>kills in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;mid battle. Or even if they are grouped for that matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As you said, these Wizzes were high levels, 20+.  If they want to farm lower<br/>\ncreatures that give them no experience, that is a camping problem, not a<br/>\nproblem with wizards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
