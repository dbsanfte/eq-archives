I&#39;m 24th, will be<br/>\n25th tonight (reposte woohoo), Dark Elf warrior.  I&#39;ve been playing since<br/>\nphase 2 and concider myself to be one of the better warriors of the land,<br/>\nnot due to my level or my equipment, but because I&#39;ve been playing for a<br/>\nwhile and know the role of a warrior in a party.  I protect my healer with<br/>\nmy life, and will sacrifice myself to ensure the remainder of my party has a<br/>\nfew moments to escape....when necessary.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for weapons, my BBC is my primary weapon, but I also keep my 1h<br/>\nslashing/dual wield skills up by using dual Barbed Leather Whips.  I also<br/>\nuse archery, mainly for fetching monsters, but also use it when I get to<br/>\nhurt to tank, I&#39;ll just back up and fire off arrows until I either get<br/>\nhealed or the critter is dead.  Archery is a very underrated skill, I&#39;ve<br/>\nfinally got my skill up to mid 80s and with the bow I have I can hit for up<br/>\nto 12 damage, nothing major, but when you are hurt you can still dish out a<br/>\nlittle damage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for the rest of my equipment, I have a Blackend Iron Crown, Grotesque<br/>\nmask, Spiked Collar, Rusty Spiked Pads, Barbed Arms, Blackend Bracers,<br/>\nBlackend Gloves, Dwarven Tunic, Black Iron Girdle, Blackend legplates,<br/>\nBlackend Boots, 2 ony earrings, 2 bands of flesh.  Just a couple pieces<br/>\nshort of a full set of blackend, can&#39;t wait, should have those by the end of<br/>\nthe weekend :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Salr D&#39;Taynkk<br/>\n&gt; Dark Warrior of The Kith<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
