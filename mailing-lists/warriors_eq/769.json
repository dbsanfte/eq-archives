The problem I have is that solusek is the server witht he <br/>\nmost european players i think.<br/>\nIm gona have to check how many players are on early morning.<br/>\nMaby i should take a day off from work heheh.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have any news on any new servers opening?<br/>\nSince I play about 6-7 h a day I feel i have a good chance of gettin big <br/>\npretty fast, and not worry about people camping spots....hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nvashi, ranting as usual<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Mifsud, Michael&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Mifsud@...\">Michael.Mifsud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hmm try this time 3 to 4am.  I live in Japan and when I get home from work<br/>\n&gt;Monday night and I login to EQ its aprox 4am or 4:30am Monday morning in <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;USA (PST).  Number of people on my server is aprox 250 to 350.  The whole<br/>\n&gt;place is dead.  I went to najena to kill some TT and me and my partner (who<br/>\n&gt;lives in Denmark) were the only ones in there.  Two people! unbelievable.<br/>\n&gt;About an hour later one other lower level person showed up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I bet that the Tomahawk will be camped very lightly (I wont go so far to <br/>\n&gt;say<br/>\n&gt;it WONT be camped at all).  The only people who may be camping it will most<br/>\n&gt;likely be Japanese or MAYBE some Europeans (thou in Europe it will be <br/>\n&gt;aprox.<br/>\n&gt;early afternoon, like 1pm or so).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If there Japanese you wont have any sharing problems, but please EXPLAIN to<br/>\n&gt;them you want to share the spawn.  For some reason (until you explain the<br/>\n&gt;idea to them, and it helps if you speak Japanese) the concept of kill<br/>\n&gt;stealing and alternating kills doesn&#39;t occur to them.  No idea why.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In my experience when its explained to them they never do it again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well hope that helps, maybe.  Good luck getting the Tomi.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: \tNick Morgowicz[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nomorgow@...\">nomorgow@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: \tTuesday, May 25, 1999 1:15 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Polished Granite Tomahawk<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Nick Morgowicz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nomorgow@...\">nomorgow@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This seems to be the most camped weapon that i&#39;ve ever seen.
