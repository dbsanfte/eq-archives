The inital post made by Wayne started<br/>\nout saying &quot;Warriors suck...&quot;  and continued to degrade the class from<br/>\nthere.  He happened to use a cleric to back up his points on why warriors<br/>\nsucked.  I felt it was my duty to defend a class that I put hard work into<br/>\nand, I might add, I play QUITE well.  Comparing warriors to clerics is like<br/>\ncomparing apples to oranges, there is no comparison.   Oh yeah and John, you<br/>\nDID say that you can take as well as a warrior....here is your exact words. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My cleric can<br/>\n&gt; take just as good as a warrior, my ac is damn high and my buffs add to<br/>\n&gt; that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>You might have meant &#39;tank&#39; and fat fingered, but in the context that you<br/>\npresented there it does seem like you were saying your cleric can take<br/>\n(damage) as good as a warrior.  Even if you said tank I still would disagree<br/>\nwith you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t think anyone is reading this list because they moved to another<br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tZwanenburg, John[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, July 13, 1999 12:47 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRE: [warriors_eq] Why I don&#39;t play a Warrior<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Zwanenburg, John&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jynxx,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gee did we hit a nerve there or what? Last time i checked the amount of<br/>\n&gt; people actually using this board was less than 5. And yeah i know its a<br/>\n&gt; warriors discussion board but oh whats this? Even tho we are talking about<br/>\n&gt; clerics AND warriors, we are discussing something!!! Isnt that the point?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh and Brian jones, i didnt say that I could take as much damage, i said i<br/>\n&gt; could tank just as well. My cleric isnt skimping out on HP but he isnt a<br/>\n&gt; troll warrior. I ususally tank for my group. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh and Jynxx, Ive taken damage from level 30ish mobs with both my warrior<br/>\n&gt; and cleric and yeah i can last.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If your pissed, flame me back, i couldnt care less. If you dont want to<br/>\n&gt; discuss this then fine. That doesnt bother me either, but this is a<br/>\n&gt; discussion board and yes our topic right now does include warriors. Oh and<br/>\n&gt; one last time for the record. My cleric is far better than my warrior ever<br/>\n&gt; was.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (BTW: My warrior is level 43 and my cleric is level 34)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rayne<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: \tJynxx[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jynxx@...\">jynxx@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: \tTuesday, July 13, 1999 1:21 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Why I don&#39;t play a Warrior<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jynxx&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jynxx@...\">jynxx@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ok...clerics heal. Blah blah blah....who cares? This is a board for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; WARRIORS, not clerics. I am sorry if I am offending anyone by saying<br/>\n&gt; this,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but please keep your cleric opinions to yourselves. If I wanted to hear<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about the virtues of playing a cleric vs. playing a warrior I would have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; joined a cleric board. Last time I looked the list was called<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &#39;Warriors_eq&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and had nothing to do with Clerics. If you have fun playing a cleric out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there, be down...have all the fun you want. Just don&#39;t tell me that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do anything because I am a warrior because even with all your heals you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t be half as vital in a group as I am. Without a warrior to save<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; arse from getting hit by that 31st level mob you&#39;d be dead in 7 seconds<br/>\n&gt; &gt; flat...well maybe 10 if you got a heal in there. Bottom line: Don&#39;t come<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my board telling me I suck, cause it&#39;s gonna tick me (and a lot of other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; GOOD warriors) off really bad.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tyveris,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Blue Samurai of the Butterfly Rank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Clancy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcashio3@...\">tcashio3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 13, 1999 10:39 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Why I don&#39;t play a Warrior<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Clancy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcashio3@...\">tcashio3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Umm...  whoever says this about clerics is stupid as hell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At lvl 31 I group consistantly with a cleric.  This class is amazing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you think all they do is heal, you are very very wrong.  Their dd&#39;s do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stun<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (amazing for rogues) and they can heal better than any other class.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; want<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to see your two druids heal you to full from 1 bar of life<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also if all you fight is yellows and reds you need to rethink your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; leveling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; process.  Whites and blues are excellent to fight if you are in groups<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; handle large numbers well.  Before you say all clerics do is heal,<br/>\n&gt; play<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or play with a good one.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.
