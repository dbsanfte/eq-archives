The only<br/>\nrealistic targets (since Wood Elf guards are very high level) are the elves<br/>\non the Island of Erollsi.  If you raise Indigo you lower Wood/High elf and<br/>\nvice a versa.  These two sides are mutually exclusive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Dungeons:<br/>\n&gt; Najena - easy enough, kinda tough for you &quot;good&quot; people to get to because<br/>\n&gt; you got to run thru Nektulos with wondering guards everywhere.....and to<br/>\n&gt; my knowledge there is no way to raise your faction standing with DEs other<br/>\n&gt; than to ruin your faction standing with halflings.<br/>\n&gt; Solsek Eye - easy enough for darks, same story as najena for you &#39;good&#39;<br/>\n&gt; types<br/>\n&gt; Befallen - nutral teritory<br/>\n&gt; Runnyeye - depending on which direction you are coming from.....you might<br/>\n&gt; have to stop in HH and kill some orcs, then run the long way thru HH into<br/>\n&gt; the karanas, back into beholders maze, then whala, or do like me and just<br/>\n&gt; run thru munchkin town<br/>\n&gt; Guk - in troll land, pretty easy to get to for &quot;good&quot; people but nowhere<br/>\n&gt; close for non casters to be bound, and nowhere close for &quot;good&quot; people to<br/>\n&gt; sell, very easy for us evil types with Troll town just around the<br/>\n&gt; corner....again, no way for &quot;good&quot; people to raise their faction with<br/>\n&gt; Trolls<br/>\n&gt; Cazic Thule - same as Guk, good types have nowhere to bind and nowhere to<br/>\n&gt; sell, evil has it easy....not to mention the entrance of Cazic is patroled<br/>\n&gt; by an ogre guard.....again, no way for &quot;good&quot; people to raise their<br/>\n&gt; faction with Ogres<br/>\n&gt; Crushbone - well, we dark elves have a pact with the Crushbone orcs, so we<br/>\n&gt; take a faction hit with the dark elf warrior guild for hunting<br/>\n&gt; there....but only 2 magic items worth getting from there anyways, not to<br/>\n&gt; mention its way crouded and a long ways away from any &quot;evil&quot; starting<br/>\n&gt; town, so by the time you get there you are probably to high lvl to fight<br/>\n&gt; there....see foot note<br/>\n&gt; Mistmoore - nutral ground, a little tricky for us darks to get to, but not<br/>\n&gt; too bad, and we can be bound anywhere in greater feydark.....see foot note<br/>\n&gt; Unrest - nutral ground, a little tricky for us darks to get to....see foot<br/>\n&gt; note<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; footnote:  even tho we can be bound in close proxcimity to Crushbone,<br/>\n&gt; Mistmoore, and Unrest, there is nowhere on that entire island for us to<br/>\n&gt; sell or bank......however, by the time you are ready to fight in mistmoore<br/>\n&gt; you are probably going to have a high lvl wiz, who can group gate you back<br/>\n&gt; to nektulos for banking/selling needs, or since there are sooooo many<br/>\n&gt; &quot;good&quot; people compared to &quot;evil&quot; people, you are probably going to have a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;good&quot; person in your group who can go to town and sell for you.  And<br/>\n&gt; again, there is no real reason for us to need to fight in Crushbone or<br/>\n&gt; Unrest (ogres and trolls can&#39;t wear the small bronze, and us small dark<br/>\n&gt; elves don&#39;t have the raw strenght to wear bronze due to its weight)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, everybody seems to forget the one big advantage of being evil.....we<br/>\n&gt; can kill any NPCs we want with out having to worry about faction hits,<br/>\n&gt; except either in HH or Rivervale (easiest connections to the Western part<br/>\n&gt; of the world.  You good types can only kill Nektulos guards (all troll and<br/>\n&gt; ogre guards are 50+)  And some NPCs have some pretty good loot.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So to sum up.....evil isn&#39;t any harder to play than good, but it does<br/>\n&gt; force you to know more about the way the world works.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Salr D&#39;Taynkk<br/>\n&gt; Dark Warrior of The Kith<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Kelly Pruett &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pruett@...\">pruett@...</a>&gt; 5.21.99 1:28:23 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Kelly Pruett &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pruett@...\">pruett@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Which may explain why they all kill you on sight. You dark elves should<br/>\n&gt; crawn back in the scrawny dark holes you crawled out of before you taste<br/>\n&gt; another human blade.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Faderic<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OOC: Actually if it weren&#39;t so damned hard to play DE maybe it would be a<br/>\n&gt; nicer race. Seems to me that Barbs, Ogres, and Trolls got a tremendous<br/>\n&gt; warrior advantage in this game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jason Coan wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ya know why?  because humans, stat-wise, pretty much suck.  ie, and DE<br/>\n&gt; has base int of 99, human has 100 as max......DE warriors are almost as<br/>\n&gt; smart as human casters, haha, and I always remind them of this when I see<br/>\n&gt; them :)  (assuming its day time and they are not more than 5 steps away so<br/>\n&gt; they can see me).  And thats just an example of their pathetic<br/>\n&gt; inteligence, the rest of their stats are equally unimpressive.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
