AC is the second half, and the<br/>\n&gt; lesser half, of the armor system in Everquest.  The<br/>\n&gt; first half is damage absorption.  The armor sequence<br/>\n&gt; is:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Naked &gt; Cloth &gt; Patchwork &gt; Leather &gt; Ringmail &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Chainmail &gt; Banded &gt; Plate<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Each level of armor absorbs more damage than the<br/>\n&gt; levels before it.  If you doubt, try it.  Fight<br/>\n&gt; something on your level naked and see how badly you<br/>\n&gt; get hit; every shot will come in at max damage.  Put<br/>\n&gt; your armor back on and see shots hitting for 2, 5,<br/>\n&gt; etc...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Look at Rangers, who can&#39;t wear better than banded,<br/>\n&gt; fighting along side a Warrior.  Ranger in full banded,<br/>\n&gt; dual wielding; gets hammered and has to be healed much<br/>\n&gt; more often than the dual wielding Warrior in full<br/>\n&gt; plate.  Warrior takes less damage per shot.  Put the<br/>\n&gt; Warrior in banded and watch him start taking damage<br/>\n&gt; like the Ranger, needing more heals.  PLATE IS WORTH<br/>\n&gt; IT.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Plate is a requirement to be an effective tank past<br/>\n&gt; 20ish.  Now you have to make some concessions for good<br/>\n&gt; buffs (I still wear *my* Spiked Collar for the +3<br/>\n&gt; Strength; but it&#39;s just a collar), but you want to be<br/>\n&gt; in mostly plate.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ahhh thanks!! i didnt know this at all...i thought it was all based on AC...<br/>\ni shall def take your advice and switch to bronze arms again...also the one<br/>\nslot i forgot was the belt...ive currently got the blackened girdle with<br/>\nplus 5 stam...is it better to go for the bronze one then?<br/>\n<br/>\nand ill be on the lookout for erollisi bracer and bracer of battle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; collar of undead prot =&gt; Spiked Collar (+3 STR)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - ive got a spiked collar but went in favour of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; undead one...with better AC<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Personal taste.  I value, right now, stat enhancement<br/>\n&gt; over saves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; blackened helm =&gt; Bronze Helm or B.Iron Crown<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- sorry i menat B iron crown, not blackened helm<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stick with the Crown then; +5 STR is sweet and is<br/>\n&gt; worth taking the Chainmail hit on the head for.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; barbed arms =&gt; Bronze Arms   --- my barbed arms<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are only 1 ac less than bronze, but give +2 dex<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; See above comments about plate vs chain (which is what<br/>\n&gt; barbed armor is equalivalent to).  +2 Dex isn&#39;t worth<br/>\n&gt; the plate armor value at 30th level.  Get Dex rings if<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re looking for Dex.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; lizardscale cloak =&gt; Bronze Cloak --- lizard is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; same Ac as bronze but lighter and plus 5 dex<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; See above comments about plate.  +5 Dex is much better<br/>\n&gt; than +2 for Barbed Arms, but it&#39;s still kinda grey.<br/>\n&gt; You might want to stick with this one, maybe.  It<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t protect as well as plate though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My 25th Paladin is set up like this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PG Tomahawk<br/>\n&gt; SB Shield<br/>\n&gt; Bronze Helm<br/>\n&gt; +2 AGI Onyx Earrings (2)<br/>\n&gt; +7 DEX Grotesque Mask<br/>\n&gt; +3 STR Spiked Collar<br/>\n&gt; +3 STR, +10 Magic BS Mantle<br/>\n&gt; Bronze Arms<br/>\n&gt; +3 DEX, +1 STR Bracer of Battle<br/>\n&gt; +5 STR Bracer of Erollsi<br/>\n&gt; Bronze Gauntlets<br/>\n&gt; +2 STR Rings (2)<br/>\n&gt; Bronze Breastplate<br/>\n&gt; Bronze Cloak<br/>\n&gt; Bronze Girdle<br/>\n&gt; Bronze Legs<br/>\n&gt; Bronze Boots<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m currently looking for Dwarven Workboots and a<br/>\n&gt; Blackened Iron Crown.  Workboots are a rare drop, but<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m patient (and willing to pay well); problem with<br/>\n&gt; the BI Crown is I *hate* Runnyeye (very dangerous<br/>\n&gt; dungeon, imo); and the KS Wizards who show up with a<br/>\n&gt; BI Crown aren&#39;t interested in selling.  Every BI Crown<br/>\n&gt; I see is for trade only in exchange for caster items.<br/>\n&gt; GRRRRRRRR.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m going to trade my Onyx Earrings for Gold-Amber (+3<br/>\n&gt; STR each), and my +2 STR Rings for Gold-Onyx (+5 DEX<br/>\n&gt; each).  If I could just find someone who works Gold<br/>\n&gt; ....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My current &#39;buff&#39; set up is +16 STR, +4 AGI (which I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; going to dump for more STR and DEX), and +10 DEX.  I<br/>\n&gt; also have a Savant&#39;s Cap, two +2 INT rings and a BI<br/>\n&gt; Medallion; I can be +10 INT when I&#39;m training skills,<br/>\n&gt; which comes in hand when you&#39;re naturally 60 INT.  If<br/>\n&gt; I can get the Workboots, BI Crown and switch my rings<br/>\n&gt; and earrings like I want, my buffs will look like<br/>\n&gt; this: +26 STR, +25 DEX.  That would put STR at 136 and<br/>\n&gt; DEX at 115.<br/>\n&gt; ===<br/>\n&gt; :D<br/>\n&gt;        Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n&gt; -No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&gt; &quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\n&gt; believe it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; First Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\n----- Daniel Leavy  MM Helpdesk NY -----<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dan@...\">dan@...</a><br/>\nTel: +01 (212) 271-9817 ext. 239 / Fax: +01 (212) 753-5252<br/>\nWeb: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.micromuse.com\">http://www.micromuse.com</a><br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
