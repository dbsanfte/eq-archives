I&#39;d like to be able to <br/>\npetition the gm for a group switch, like an evil gnome necro getting added <br/>\nto the troll, dark elf and ogre team.  I think that would be wonderful and <br/>\nadd a lot to the roleplay possibilities.  It would allow you to be a spy or <br/>\ntraitor to your race, more fun stuff than just a strait race war.  If anyone <br/>\nhas any input into that type of thing we should send it in to management.<br/>\n<br/>\nArathorne, Solsek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Zwanenburg, John&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [warriors_eq] Race war server.<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 17 Jun 1999 11:32:27 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Zwanenburg, John&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hey gang,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just thought id let you know that when the new race war sever comes up<br/>\n&gt;myself and a very good friend are starting a guild. For those of you who<br/>\n&gt;dont know the race war server is sort of like the PvP server Rallos Zek but<br/>\n&gt;you cant just walk up and kill anyone. The Races are divided into teams  <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;only other teams can kill you. This is how the teams are made up so far:<br/>\n&gt;Trolls, Ogres, Dark Elves (Probably Lizard Men too when they get added)<br/>\n&gt;Barbarians, Humans, Erudites,<br/>\n&gt;Wood Elves, High Elves, Half Elves.<br/>\n&gt;Dwarves, Gnomes, Halflings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now this is going to be way better than Rallos zek cause you wont have some<br/>\n&gt;person of your own race killing you. makes more sense this way.<br/>\n&gt;The guild we are going to start is going to be called The Dark and is only<br/>\n&gt;going to be made up of the team of Trolls, Ogres, and Dark Elves. This <br/>\n&gt;Guild<br/>\n&gt;will attempt to bring misery and pain to those who follow the light. Both <br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt;friend and i are roleplayers and enjoy the feeling of playing the bad guy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So right now i am asking you if anyone wants to join us when the new server<br/>\n&gt;comes out. We can always use Warriors, but we are also looking for other<br/>\n&gt;classes too they are: Shamans, Rogues, Enchanters, Clerics In particular. I<br/>\n&gt;am starting a Necro to be the Guild leader and My friend as Co leader will<br/>\n&gt;be a wizard. We would like to get as many people as possible and if you <br/>\n&gt;want<br/>\n&gt;to be a warrior thats fine! Heck thats GREAT! We just need people.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you want more info on our guild or want to inquire about joining email <br/>\n&gt;me<br/>\n&gt;at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a> during the week or <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zbitnew@...\">zbitnew@...</a> during the<br/>\n&gt;weekend.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks guys and i hope you all join me!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lothaniel/Rayne T&#39;kazz<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: \tBilly Barnett[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sigurd@...\">sigurd@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: \tWednesday, June 16, 1999 6:35 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] You want to know how weak warriors!

I was a 12th warrior at the time with two rangers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cleric if I remeber correctly and the three tanks coundn&#39;t outdamage <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 13th<br/>\n&gt; &gt; druid. It wasn&#39;t until the cleric starting using expulse undead that we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ever got<br/>\n&gt; &gt; experience. There may have been an undocumented fix in a patch since, <br/>\n&gt;but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that experience I believe that the experience went to the single PC that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; did the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most damage not the group.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just my 2cp. Hope it helps,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Surtur<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; PS. I still haven&#39;t gotten a response on where to look for guild links <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; E&#39;ci.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please email me with info if you have it please.

Thats<br/>\n&gt; &gt; why,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; really, only higher level wizards can steal kill.  This is not the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; case??<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How many communities do you think join ONElist each week?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; More than 5,000!
