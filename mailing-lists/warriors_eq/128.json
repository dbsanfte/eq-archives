And ya, 20 is a bit to low, good group of mid to high 20s is good.

Got a pair of mino axes, which are nice, but heavy and<br/>\n&gt; slow.  Seen the stats on the Barbed Leather Whip and it looks perfect.<br/>\n&gt; I know it&#39;s from befallen, but most likely in an area I can not get to.<br/>\n&gt; Is it possible to find these weapons for sale inside this zone by higher<br/>\n&gt; levels just selling off there loot for weight?  If so what is a fair<br/>\n&gt; price for one? Also what are some other good dualing weapons? heard of a<br/>\n&gt; crystaline sword that sounds just sweet, but no idea where that one<br/>\n&gt; comes from.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bashlor the Big Dumb Barb Warrior of Bertox<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know ONElist has over 300 Star Wars lists?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join one today!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
