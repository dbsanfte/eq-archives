Warriors are already the best in the game for defense. It&#39;s just the<br/>\noffensive part of it that gets me. Since when were warriors only tanks? In<br/>\nalmost any other RPG I&#39;ve ever played, warriors kicked arse on the same<br/>\nlevel with just about any other class. Lets look at console RPGs for a sec.<br/>\nFinal Fantasy VII is a perfect example. Sure summons and spells did about<br/>\n9999 damage at high levels, but you also had special ATTACKS (called limit<br/>\nbreaks) that did comparable damage, if not the same. Not to mention that a<br/>\nregular attck did about half that damage anyways. But in EQ we don&#39;t even<br/>\nget HALF of the damage casters get. A caster comes in and hits a mob for,<br/>\nwhat, 1200? Does any warrior here do 600 damage in the same amount of time?<br/>\n500? Hell even 300? that&#39;s not even 1/4 the damage a caster can do. It<br/>\nreminds me of playing AD & D in a tournament where I was the only fighter<br/>\namong 10 other Wizards. They always came in and blasted everything with<br/>\nspells and all I did was take the hits. But guess what? When we got to some<br/>\nDrow or something I was the one killing everything since their spells didn&#39;t<br/>\nwork as good all of a sudden. But even then I could do comparable damage.<br/>\nLets say they cast Fireball...good spell in AD&D. 6d6 +1/level damage. So a<br/>\ncaster of 20th level can do 56 points of damage with one fireball to a LARGE<br/>\ngroup. But with my +3 Vorpal weapon and girdle of storm giant strength, I&#39;d<br/>\nkick his arse in damage. 2 attacks per round my damage all total is 46 per<br/>\nround. That breaks down like this: +3 Vorpal Sword is 1d8+3, then my storm<br/>\ngiant strentgh (24) adds +12 to damage, making maximum damage 23 per attack,<br/>\ntwice a round. That&#39;s not including the random effects of the vorpal weapon.<br/>\nAnytime I get a critical strike (20 on a d20) it automatically chops off the<br/>\nopponents head, killing him instantly. I&#39;m not trying to compare the virtues<br/>\nof AD&D to EQ, because the last thing the world needs is someone trying to<br/>\nclone the rules again. What I am doing is showing an example that the game<br/>\nCAN be balanced for each class. The damage a caster gets can blow up an<br/>\nentire group (i&#39;ve seen it take out over 30 monsters) whereas a fighter is<br/>\nfor one-on-one melee combat, but they both can do about the same damage PER<br/>\nMONSTER at the same level. Maybe I am just rambling....<br/>\n<br/>\nJynxx</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
