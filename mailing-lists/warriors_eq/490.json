Get the regular newbie mobs like skells and stuff.<br/>\n&gt; As <br/>\n&gt; you are a warrior wack white and yellow stuff in the beginning. Just <br/>\n&gt; remember to stay close to the guards.<br/>\n&gt; When you feel a bit more sure about yerself follow the steady stream of <br/>\n&gt; people to the island in the middle of the swamp (its kinda hard to find in<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; the beginning)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are plenty of froglocks there to bash. Bet keep in mind that they<br/>\n&gt; help <br/>\n&gt; eachother and the situation can easily get outofhand.<br/>\n&gt; there are several different frogloks and some are harder the others. If I <br/>\n&gt; remember it correctly its froglok, froglok fishermen, froglok foragers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They also have armor sometimes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At level 7 as sw, prolly level 5 or 6 as warrior you can starta a team and<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; pull some orcs from the zone just opposite the town.<br/>\n&gt; Sorry I dont remember the name but its realy easy to find.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; well thats all I can come up with atm.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; well there is guk dungeon too but I dont know if its worth going there<br/>\n&gt; when <br/>\n&gt; you start up, there is some realy NASTY stuff inthere and trains can be <br/>\n&gt; painfull at times.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Not a good guide but I hope it will give you some poiters and ideas.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Vashi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Bryan Hinkel&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bjhinkel@...\">bjhinkel@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hail Great and learned warriors.
