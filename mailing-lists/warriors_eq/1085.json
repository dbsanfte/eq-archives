To bad its also a summoned item.  Most high level magicians can create them.  Damage 7 delay 26 i believe.  I have been able to keep one in the bank for quit some time.  As soon as you log out with it in your inventory tho, it is gone forever.  At least until you get a mage to make you another one.  Anyway, the morale of the story great weapon, but summoned, so find yourself a mage to adventure with.  This weapon and a barbed leather whip with cause some very good damage together.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    ~Dyvim Kincaid<br/>\n    Stormriders of Cazic Thule<br/>\n        -----Original Message-----<br/>\n        From: Tom Swift [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>]<br/>\n        Sent: Wednesday, June 09, 1999 9:14 AM<br/>\n        To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n        Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Rune Sword<br/>\n        <br/>\n        <br/>\n        <br/>\n        I would greatly appreciate any info.

I was in such a state of shock to find it gone, that I forgot the stats and went a little &quot;nuts&quot;.  I will find out for you, and get back on this.
