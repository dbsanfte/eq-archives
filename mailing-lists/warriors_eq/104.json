Kill stealing is a legitimate problem in the game, but it seems to me that there are a lot of people just itching to say HEY, YOU STOLE MY KILL....dunno why, but thats what it seems like to me.  A prime example happened to me last night, we were in Cazic Thule, fighting a 34th or 35th lvl Zealot.  After a long and hard fight, we killed it, then some guy comes running up to our party and says &quot;hey ass holes, that was our zealot&quot;.  A) never even saw this guy until the zealot was running, B) he was 25th lvl, no way in hell he could have even hurt the zealot.  He hung around for a few minutes bitching about people who steal kills, while in groupsay we were all like &quot;wtf is this guy talking about&quot;, ignored him and he eventually left.....ya see, the world is full of idiots....just like real life :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSalr D&#39;Taynkk<br/>\nDark Warrior of The Kith<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Kelly Pruett &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pruett@...\">pruett@...</a>&gt; 5.17.99 8:48:39 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: Kelly Pruett &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pruett@...\">pruett@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n1.) Was I ethically wrong to take the loot?<br/>\n2.) Does the game only allow the majority damage dealer to take the<br/>\nloot, or the final swinger?<br/>\n3.)
