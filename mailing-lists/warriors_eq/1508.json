The ranger did the pulling.  Paladin<br/>\ntanked.  Cleric healed.  Druid was able to provide healing or burning as<br/>\nneeded, and kept us all SoWed.  Wizard burned.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe druid is my favorite class to add to a group.  At higher levels their<br/>\nutility spells are exceptional.  They are 80% effective as a cleric in<br/>\nhealing, and 70% as good as wizard for burning.  Instead of having 2<br/>\nwizards, or 2 clerics a druid can be whatever a group needs at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrior to this my best group consisted of 2 clerics, 1 wizard and 3 tanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nBael<br/>\nTier&#39;dal Warrior<br/>\nArm of Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Trent Carroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trent@...\">trent@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, July 20, 1999 11:07 AM<br/>\nSubject: [warriors_eq] best grouping<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Trent Carroll&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trent@...\">trent@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn your experience what has been the best group make-up that you have been a<br/>\npart of?  If possible give a little input on why it was the best group<br/>\nmake-up.  I&#39;m concerned here with character classes, not level.  Interested<br/>\nin group sizes anywhere between 2 and 6.  Of particular interest to me is<br/>\nwhat it&#39;s like to group with an enchanter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve mostly played in very small groups.  I usually play with one other<br/>\nperson in my group.  A cleric was nice to group with in the pre-teens since<br/>\nhe did comparable melee damage and could keep me healed up.  In the teens I<br/>\nbegan grouping with a magician.  He used a water elemental for a pet which<br/>\nis supposed to be about the equivalent of an equal level troll warrior.  I<br/>\nwould let the elemental tank for me and I would stand at that perfect<br/>\ndistance where the mob attacks the elemental and not me, yet I could still<br/>\nget my hits in.  Since the elemental regains HP at about 10 points per round<br/>\nas opposed to my two it meant less down time.  At level 12 the magician had<br/>\na DD spell that did 90+ damage, very nice when it was needed to finish<br/>\nsomething off quick.  He could also summon bandages so I get healed up to<br/>\n50% for free.  As a two man team the magician was much better than the<br/>\ncleric because we could dish out much more damage in less time, and with the<br/>\npet taking much of the damage healing was not really necessary.  As an added<br/>\nbonus the pet could play the part of sacrificial lamb while we zoned when<br/>\nthings got nasty.<br/>\n<br/>\nKindrael<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCongrats to GROW TO GIVE winners, ZENtertainment & ROTInews!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nCheck out ONElistï¿½s new program, FRIENDS & FAMILY.
