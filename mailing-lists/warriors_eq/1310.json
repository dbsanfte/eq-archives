I am just a<br/>\npoor<br/>\n&gt; barbarian princess that lost her combine longsword (long story, don&#39;t<br/>\nask!)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No offense, but I think that&#39;s the problem.  The developers seem to have<br/>\nfelt<br/>\n&gt; that everyone who plays a warrior is a beginner or someone who doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant<br/>\n&gt; to be forced to ever make a decision or use player skill more than<br/>\nmeasuring<br/>\n&gt; what to attack, when to attack and when and how to try to run and hide<br/>\n(all<br/>\n&gt; of which requires patience and common sense more than anything else; two<br/>\n&gt; qualities I don&#39;t necessarily associate with my idea of a fantastic<br/>\nmedieval<br/>\n&gt; warrior who wants to kill gnolls, minotaurs, mammoths and dragons but<br/>\n&gt; nevermind that).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think we should be given far more to work with.  Really, how many hours<br/>\n(or<br/>\n&gt; minutes) did it take everyone to master the EQ &quot;melee system&quot;?  Given<br/>\n&gt; hundreds of hours to practice, I really don&#39;t think that there&#39;s too many<br/>\n&gt; levels of complexity out there which all of us couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nable<br/>\n&gt; to readily master without having to think too much and assuming we weren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; hit with all of our choices at 1st level (which could be intimidating).  I<br/>\n&gt; like playing a warrior in RPGs but not because it&#39;s the simplest or<br/>\neasiest<br/>\n&gt; class, although it too-often is.  I can&#39;t stand EQ warriors primarily<br/>\nbecause<br/>\n&gt; whether or not they can talk the talk, they can&#39;t walk the walk, but<br/>\n&gt; additionally because there&#39;s no special player skill involved when playing<br/>\n&gt; one; they have no flexibility in fights and few options other than sit<br/>\nthere<br/>\n&gt; and die or not (while swinging for 1/4th - 1/10th the damage of some other<br/>\n&gt; classes).  That&#39;s just not my definition of &quot;warrior.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW, RPing a simpleton or a crude, ignorant savage is another matter<br/>\nentirely<br/>\n&gt; which should have nothing to do with game mechanics or the combat style<br/>\n&gt; requirements of a high ranking swordsman.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Got an opinion?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Make it count!
