Maybe a Verant employee will join the list if we keep giving<br/>\nthem good ideas<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile your at it make sure you mention the adding of Dragoon to DE warriors<br/>\nof level 45 plus and Sir to Paladins who do the Test of Truth Quest :).<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to keep harping on this point, but Verant will do nothing if we all<br/>\ndont feedback.  They will do something if more than one person hits the<br/>\nfeedback button.  I know this from personal experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tJynxx[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jynxx@...\">Jynxx@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tWednesday, May 26, 1999 5:11 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Camping, a solution<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jynxx&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jynxx@...\">Jynxx@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s what we need! A random item spawn.....I&#39;ll even take it one step<br/>\n&gt; further:<br/>\n&gt; Lets say that said sword is on a level 45 person...so we&#39;ll call that a<br/>\n&gt; &#39;level 45 item&#39; it can then spawn to any level 45+ NPC in all of the zone,<br/>\n&gt; or even norrath. That would make people have to travel A LOT to find items<br/>\n&gt; they want, and would completely prevent camping for items altogether. That<br/>\n&gt; way if you really wanted an item bad enough, your group had to go search<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; it...not just sit sround and wait for it....that to me is not even<br/>\n&gt; role-playing.<br/>\n&gt; Just my 2 cents.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tyveris<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
