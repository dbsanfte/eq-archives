There<br/>\n&gt;is less of an XP result difference between a 20 and 24 grouped pair<br/>\n&gt;than between a 6 and 10 grouped pair.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWith more than 17 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n...ONElist is THE place where the world talks!<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
