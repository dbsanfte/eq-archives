My cleric can<br/>\ntake just as good as a warrior, my ac is damn high and my buffs add to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus with my divine aura i am always the LAST party member to flee, i tell<br/>\neveryone i party with that i will die so they can run. Divine aura lets any<br/>\ncleric do this. But that all depends on the player themselves<br/>\n<br/>\nDont knock a class till you play with the people who play it best.<br/>\n<br/>\nRayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tClancy[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcashio3@...\">tcashio3@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, July 13, 1999 11:39 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Why I don&#39;t play a Warrior<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Clancy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcashio3@...\">tcashio3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Umm...  whoever says this about clerics is stupid as hell<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At lvl 31 I group consistantly with a cleric.  This class is amazing.  If<br/>\n&gt; you think all they do is heal, you are very very wrong.  Their dd&#39;s do<br/>\n&gt; stun<br/>\n&gt; (amazing for rogues) and they can heal better than any other class.  I<br/>\n&gt; want<br/>\n&gt; to see your two druids heal you to full from 1 bar of life<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also if all you fight is yellows and reds you need to rethink your<br/>\n&gt; leveling<br/>\n&gt; process.  Whites and blues are excellent to fight if you are in groups<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; handle large numbers well.  Before you say all clerics do is heal, play<br/>\n&gt; one,<br/>\n&gt; or play with a good one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.  <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.
