I think it should be TOTALLY<br/>\n&gt; random unless<br/>\n&gt; a quest is attached to that item.  So the executioner axe is on a level 45<br/>\n&gt; mob in a dungeon.  That means the executioner axe could appear on<br/>\n&gt; ANY level<br/>\n&gt; 45 mob in the game (within reason, necromancers wielding it in Najena<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t make sense).  Probably add the restriction that it also must be a<br/>\n&gt; dungeon mob.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only reason I dont like your idea is simply, people will camp at all 4<br/>\n&gt; spots.  People WILL spend obscene amounts of time trying to get that item.<br/>\n&gt; For a solid week easy I saw the same people over and over again<br/>\n&gt; waiting for<br/>\n&gt; the Tomahawks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think your solution just spreads camping.  There are people with lots of<br/>\n&gt; time, people WILL spend days at a spot waiting for an item if<br/>\n&gt; they know that<br/>\n&gt; SOMETIME the item WILL appear here then it WILL be camped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: \tJames Wofford[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:James.Wofford@...\">James.Wofford@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: \tWednesday, May 26, 1999 5:41 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Camping, a solution<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: James Wofford &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:James.Wofford@...\">James.Wofford@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You bring up a valid point.  But the reason for random spawn is to make<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; game more enjoyable to people as a whole.  Also, the spawn would have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; completely random in time.  I Just think the spawn should be on<br/>\n&gt; maybe 3 or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different types of mobs, all around the same level, all<br/>\n&gt; spawning in 3 or 4<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different zones, and all spawning at different random intervals.  This<br/>\n&gt; &gt; increases the chances the items will be around, and makes it a<br/>\n&gt; little more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; difficult to camp it.  Also, there should be more of a chance that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; item<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is not actually on the mob since there will be more appearing<br/>\n&gt; more often.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For instance, you want a rubicite breastplate.  For those of us who know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what and where it comes from, its pretty easy to wait for the spawn to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; appear.  Then get together poeple and whack it.  (dont get me wrong, its<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an easy task to kill... just to wait for it.) On the other hand, if that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; same creature spawned in 3 or 4 different zones, and only spawned at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; random<br/>\n&gt; &gt; intervals...  The campers would either have to spend obscene amounts of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sitting on one area hopping to get lucky.  Or they would just have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; travel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; back and forth to the 3 or 4 different zones to get their kill.<br/>\n&gt;  This also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; increases the chance that the spawn will appear when they just left the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; zone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they were waiting in and give someone else a chance at it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
