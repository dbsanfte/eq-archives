This assumes the<br/>\nmultiple mobs (defined as those which are extra, that<br/>\nyou&#39;re not designating as your primary target) are not<br/>\nof a threat level insufficient to cause any sort of<br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe logic is simple; test it yourself.  If you target<br/>\nthe &#39;most dangerous&#39; (and usually the longest-to-kill)<br/>\nmob first, you will have the 2nd, 3rd, etc... mobs<br/>\nstill around during the time you kill the<br/>\nlongest-to-kill, then the next-longest-to-kill, and so<br/>\nforth.  During all of this time they&#39;re dealing damage<br/>\nto you.  Kill in order of shortest-to-kill, to get rid<br/>\nof the damage they&#39;ll deal to you, enabling you to<br/>\nmore quickly concentrate the battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, a lot of rules change if you have<br/>\nsufficient spellcasting backup to flat out nuke-kill<br/>\n(in an extremely short time) a few of the multiple<br/>\nmobs.  Since I&#39;m a tank, and play from a tank<br/>\nperspective, that&#39;s just an oddity situation; plan for<br/>\nthe tank and be pleasantly surprised if spellcasting<br/>\nhelps.  Much less likely to get into a jam that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
