When you give him the fangs (one by one or one each of the<br/>\ngive slots ie: not stacked) he gives you xp and moonstones.  You can sell<br/>\nthe moonstones or take them to the bartender in the back room of Fish&#39;s Ale<br/>\nand give to him in exchange for BB Stout (an illegal gnoll brew.)  Then sell<br/>\nthe BB Stouts for money - I usually drink one for the heck of it or<br/>\nsometimes carry some back to BB incase I need to offer someone a reward for<br/>\nhelping me or whatever.  It&#39;s not that far out of your way when you make a<br/>\nbank run to hit the bakery and fish&#39;s ale first.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I do this as often as I can and one day the bar keep says&quot; &quot;oh oh<br/>\nrunning low... can you take this note to the brewmaster and he will give you<br/>\nsome more BB Stout to bring back...&quot;  So, I take the note and srcibble down<br/>\nthe name of the brewmaster: Gnasher Furrgut.  Ok, turns out that another<br/>\nquest has the head of Gnasher as a quest item and most monks are out there<br/>\ntrying to slay Gnasher.  Finally, I come up from BB after some hard fighting<br/>\nand see Gnasher running past so I run after him and get close enough to hail<br/>\nhim and he stops and talks.  I give him the note and sure enough he gives me<br/>\nsome real big bottles of BB Stout.<br/>\n<br/>\nCool I think now what? Hmm I guess I shall kill him and get his head too.<br/>\nSo I unsheath my trusty short sword and give him a few whacks which gets him<br/>\npretty mad.  I glance over to my hp and ruh roh!  Still below 50% from the<br/>\nearlier fights and Gnasher does me in and I drop a level!  Dang!  I owe<br/>\nGnasher one now!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo are quests worth it?  This one gives you xp, cash and some depth of<br/>\ncharacter (ie makes the game a bit more interesting) beyond bashing gnolls<br/>\nall day long.  So far it&#39;s the best one I have found and you can do it while<br/>\nyou are doing your normal power leveling thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSnyak.<br/>\nWarrior level 10 (no you can&#39;t count the number of time you make a level<br/>\nother wise I&#39;d be level 40)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tJason Coan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, May 18, 1999 9:41 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [warriors_eq] (no subject)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t5.  never messed much with quest, yet to see or hear of a<br/>\nlow level quest that is actually worth the time and effort.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
