However,<br/>\ngroups can (when functioning properly and working together) fight more<br/>\ncontinually, more efficiently, and take on more and larger foes; ending<br/>\nup in better XP and loot for the group as a whole.  A warrior has<br/>\ndifficulty, sometimes, soloing a white monster; and will have to sit<br/>\nafterwards.  In a group, the warrior takes the monster with ease and<br/>\nhas very little downtime following the encounter.<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup xp is divided by taking the total levels in the group and<br/>\ndividing the XP for the encounter by them.  Each character then takes<br/>\none share per level they own; higher levels take more shares than lower<br/>\nlevels.  There are also some unknown tweak factors or somesuch in<br/>\neffect behind the scenes that make grouping work better between<br/>\ndisparate level characters at higher levels (like 20+, etc...).  There<br/>\nis less of an XP result difference between a 20 and 24 grouped pair<br/>\nthan between a 6 and 10 grouped pair.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
