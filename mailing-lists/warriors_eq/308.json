This is me in a nutshell ... except you forgot a couple of parts...<br/>\n<br/>\n- Compiles a full blown notebook of EQ info printed from the web with a huge<br/>\nstck of paper on the company high speed laser printer. Take home and think about<br/>\ndoing another one to reference at work ...<br/>\n- Talk 3 people at work into playing EQ. They become just as addicted as me. We<br/>\nall milk each other though the bleary eyed first hour of work, dinking caffeine<br/>\nto help restore a seriousack of sleep.<br/>\n- Talk several customers (mostly techies) into playing EQ while I&#39;m installing<br/>\ntheir new equipment at their site.<br/>\n- Seriously consider a second account for &quot;those times when I just don&#39;t want to<br/>\nbe myself ... but have help from myself&quot;<br/>\n- Actually start dreaming of those female PC&#39;s from EQ. (Hey ... is it just me<br/>\nor do some of them look damn good?)<br/>\n- Put off every errand I&#39;ve had to do for the last month until after Christmas<br/>\nsometime .... if I&#39;m not busy.<br/>\n- Started going home for lunch so I can make a quick plat or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are pathetic then I am too....<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faderic<br/>\n<br/>\nschlaban yocksovik wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;schlaban yocksovik&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anonymaste@...\">anonymaste@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hmm,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lets look into the life och chris(my real name) and see what his alst 24h<br/>\n&gt; was like.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yesterday same time as now roughly 16:30<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; leave work 30 min early, go home, check icq, send msg to friends<br/>\n&gt; &quot;loging on Vashi on solusek ro&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; play for 3h<br/>\n&gt; get killed by a griff for the first time, karanas was no fun today.<br/>\n&gt; and humans look funny in banded armor<br/>\n&gt; call for pizza, sit in safe spot, run down to pizza place(2min).<br/>\n&gt; Eat pizza while wackin scarabs in N Ro.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gf calls, talk 5 min, distracted by party members wanting to go,<br/>\n&gt; partymember laughs at a humans butt in chainmail<br/>\n&gt; gf hangs up askin me to call when the computer is turned off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Spends 10 min healing after dorn got pulled by someone.<br/>\n&gt; Tries to light a smoke buy realize that I should have bought more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; check the time, damn 1:00 time to go to bed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wake up 30 min late, dreamin of clashing weapons and ugly humans in<br/>\n&gt; chainmail.<br/>\n&gt; run down to work, buy a sandwich on the way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; spend 90% of work time reading this newsgroup and every post on eqvault and<br/>\n&gt; stratics, checks maps for now hunting areas.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; write 50 lines of code that wont work<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; AAAHHHRRRRGGGGG I thought i was safe from the computer gaming addiction when<br/>\n&gt; I gave up muds 6 months ago and now Im back in it again.
