Just some questions. I heard that there are two centaurs in the<br/>\n&gt; Centaur Village in South Karana at 200, -2400 that offer Blue Plate or<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Crafted&quot;, and that it is Warrior Only armor. Does anyone know what items<br/>\n&gt; you need to give and what the stats are? Also any magic on it? Any info<br/>\n&gt; appreciated!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jynxx<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed, the Centaur brothers offer *8* intriguing mini-quests to provide<br/>\noutstanding warrior-only armor.  Someone tipped me off to their<br/>\nexistance as someone has to you, and I whole-heartedly encourage each of<br/>\nyou to go down to SK, take the time to have a lengthy conversation (and<br/>\nget all the details on the quests) for yourselves.  Each of the armors<br/>\nhas two main components needed to be made.  A somewhat rare, somewhat<br/>\nrandom, no-drop item found on a mostly random level 35+ mob in a certain<br/>\narea, and a rare gem (or gems).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are no magical enchantments on the armors I&#39;ve acquired<br/>\n(breastplate and helm).  The gems for the items range from Ruby<br/>\n(vendor-available, cost 130PP and up depending on charisma), to<br/>\nSapphire, the game&#39;s rarest gem.  The clues left by the Brothers are<br/>\nvery clear and easy-to-follow in all but one case.  Doing the quests...<br/>\nnot easy. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDalkin Orcslayer<br/>\n<br/>\nPS&gt; The breastplate is the same blue color as the Mithril armor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n-Jeff Auman<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jauman@...\">jauman@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
