If a party of two<br/>\nkills a monster, you get X + P (P = Party Experience Addition), divided by<br/>\ntwo (half of that experience for each of you). The bigger your party, the<br/>\nbigger that P is - the Party Experience Addition is larger for three people<br/>\nthen for then for two, and larger for four people then for three, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk,clarification then.  Say for example my 34th level warrior and my bard<br/>\nfriend Mikal level 25<br/>\nare grouping.  We kill something that we both get exp for.  According to the<br/>\nabove the exp gained would be exactly the same for mikal(or me) if he was<br/>\ngrouped with someone closer to his level.  In the past ppl were really<br/>\nworried they wouldnt get much(or any) exp if they grouped with someone<br/>\nhigher level then they.. reasoning that the higher level would &quot;suck all the<br/>\nexp&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to this, it seems we can dismiss this notion.  Eh?  Am I flawed in<br/>\nthis thinking?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
