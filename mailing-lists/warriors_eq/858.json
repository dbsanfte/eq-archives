And the digest mode is just about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;useless, as everyone who RE:&#39;s keeps including the full text from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;previous poster, resulting in literally 100&#39;s of lines of text per email.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Is it really necessary to include the full body of the 10 previous responses<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to a post in an post that doesn&#39;t even address the subject anymore?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sorry for the criticism, I do get a lot out of this list and hope to be able<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to contribute to it as I level up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Definite agreement there.  What really irks me is when someone quotes a whole <br/>\n&gt; digest in their post.  Cut-and-paste is NOT a difficult process, people.  90% <br/>\n&gt; of the time these digests I get are too big to be read online and I have to <br/>\n&gt; download them.  Of course then I often don&#39;t have the time to go back and <br/>\n&gt; read it or I just forget its there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But onto other warrior-related topics:  I have a story that led to a <br/>\n&gt; particularly interesting problem.  Currently I am an 8th lvl warrior on <br/>\n&gt; Cazic-Thule who adventures around the Freeport environs: Desert of Ro, <br/>\n&gt; Commonlands, et al.  One day in the desert this nasty little dark elf <br/>\n&gt; shadowknight has hanging around and this guy is a known kill-stealer and a <br/>\n&gt; real jerk (anyone who frequents the desert *might* know who I&#39;m t/*alking <br/>\n&gt; about).  He was hanging around our party making rude gestures at us and <br/>\n&gt; calling us really nasty names.  Then he seemed to go away.  A little while <br/>\n&gt; later I spotted him fighting a giant spider so I figured I&#39;d teach him a <br/>\n&gt; little lesson.  I ran over and attacked it myself, and he starts telling me <br/>\n&gt; to back off.  Of course it didn&#39;t matter much because he easily defeated it <br/>\n&gt; quickly thereafter.  &quot;Oh well,&quot; I thought, &quot;His comeuppance shall be had <br/>\n&gt; another day.&quot;  I then ran over to attack an orc.  Well this little pest <br/>\n&gt; followed me over and killed off the orc I was fighting, then told me that was <br/>\n&gt; my punishment for trying to steal his kill.  This got me really angry.  I <br/>\n&gt; wanted to challenge him to a duel but he was one level higher than I and had <br/>\n&gt; some really good armor to boot so I figured I would lose.  I took a <br/>\n&gt; screenshot of him using foul language and sent a petition, but I was told by <br/>\n&gt; a GM to just work it out myself.  Some verbal tennis was had between my party <br/>\n&gt; and this dark elf, but other than shooting off a few tart zingers we were <br/>\n&gt; pretty much up a creek with this guy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What is one to do in a situation like this?  Has anyone else ever come across <br/>\n&gt; this kind of thing?  What did you do about it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; With more than 17 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ....ONElist is THE place where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;** --------- End Original Message ----------- **<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
