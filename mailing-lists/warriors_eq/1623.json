I have had 0 success.  Can you please explain to me in detail how<br/>\nto make a weapon hotkey so I can change between my 1hs/2hs weapons faster.<br/>\nAs well as make hotkeys for my jboots and guise.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the web page is great, I just have a few suggestions.  The always<br/>\ntaunt thing imho is incorrect.  If you continually are taunting, the mob<br/>\nwill be mad at you sure.  But when the wizard hits him with a DD that really<br/>\npisses him off, you won&#39;t be able to taunt hard enough to get him off your<br/>\nnuker.  So I suggest only taunting every now and then.  You should be doing<br/>\nenough damage that you are pissing that mob off to begin with without the<br/>\ntaunt.  Then when someone does get him agitated and he turns to them, you<br/>\ncan easily use taunt to turn him back to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the difference between 1hs and 2hs damage ammounts will be pretty<br/>\nsignificant at the lower levels.  When you reach higher levels, duel<br/>\nwielding 1hs&#39;s can be of a significant advantage when you have close to 10<br/>\ndamage weapons that proc effects and are fairly fast.  Specially with<br/>\ncelerity of swift like the wind =)  I still almost continually use 2hs<br/>\nmyself though as my primary weapon.  Haven&#39;t found my Ykeshas yet =)<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that great page.  Good information and keep those youngin&#39;s in<br/>\nline.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaks<br/>\nWarrior 48 season<br/>\nStormriders<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tPatricia Halas [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tTuesday, November 30, 1999 9:19 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Warriors@onelist.com\">EQ-Warriors@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[warriors_eq] Warriors Rule, all others Drool !!<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Patricia Halas&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEverquest is the greatest game on the Planet and needs NO changes!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone cares, I have posted a page on how I fight on the web @<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/eqdynasty/warrior.html\">http://members.xoom.com/eqdynasty/warrior.html</a> - &#39;tis only my humble<br/>\nopinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Honor and of The Dynasty Guild and Rallos Zek;<br/>\n<br/>\nPatricia Bryan of Halas<br/>\nPrincess of the Bryan Dynasty<br/>\nDynasty Guild Administrative Officer<br/>\nBarbarian Warrior of the 30th Rank<br/>\n<br/>\nurl: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/eqdynasty\">http://members.xoom.com/eqdynasty</a><br/>\n     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/eqdynasty/patricia.html\">http://members.xoom.com/eqdynasty/patricia.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
