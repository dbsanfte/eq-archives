They added a ring for high<br/>\n&gt; level<br/>\n&gt; players only. When you got to a spot you liked you &quot;turned&quot; the ring.<br/>\n&gt; After that<br/>\n&gt; you could go anywhere ... then again &quot;turn&quot; the ring and ....  poof, you<br/>\n&gt; were<br/>\n&gt; back at your bound ring spot. It was SUCH a cool item.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, I think the Verant guys want to keep people separated for<br/>\n&gt; some<br/>\n&gt; reason in this game (zone server reasons maybe??)  There does need to be a<br/>\n&gt; way<br/>\n&gt; to stay somewhere though ... maybe they could balance it with a high cost<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; something.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Faderic<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Um, which part did you think was funny?  The ultimate weapon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or the boots?  :)  I really, seriously would like a magic item for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warriors to be able to gate back to their bound spot.  Or at least<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give a spell to a wizard that allows you to gate them back (they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are still not able to bind you anywhere but a city).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
