After a lot of great<br/>\n&gt;hunting, I returned to Halas to drop coin and loot, and decided to stop<br/>\n&gt;at the Warrior guild to be sure that they would train him.  Thuxtis had<br/>\n&gt;recently made 14th level and was eagery looking forward to the magical<br/>\n&gt;15th.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So there I am at the guild (and yes they will train gnmoes), I just<br/>\n&gt;happened to look down the list of skills to train and I see:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dual Wield<br/>\n&gt;No Charge<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Huh? Thuxtis rubs his eyes and looks again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dual Wield<br/>\n&gt;No Charge<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well, You don&#39;t have to tell Thuxtis three times, so i reach up and<br/>\n&gt;click on it, then press the practice button.  &quot;Your Skill in Dual Wield<br/>\n&gt;has Gone up&quot;. Awesome... practice, practice, practice, practice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How did this little gem of a change slip through?  My friend Ramkota<br/>\n&gt;informed me this morning that at 13th he could practice it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So the Moral of the story is for all you 13-14 level warriors (and it<br/>\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t hurt for the 12th to try as well), grab a SOW and RUN to the<br/>\n&gt;nearest guild to grab this skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;*****************************************************<br/>\n&gt;* Okay, who put a stop Payment on my Reality check? *<br/>\n&gt;*****************************************************<br/>\n&gt;* <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Castle/5225\">http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Castle/5225</a>  *<br/>\n&gt;* Scott M Parrish                <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sparrish@...\">sparrish@...</a> *<br/>\n&gt;*****************************************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Have you entered ONElist&#39;s &quot;Grow to Give&quot; program?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Deadline is June 19.
