Some of you may not want to see this, but at gameznet.com/eq there is a new post about the success at duel wielding and double attack.  With all these updates you guys would nonstop 4 hit attack.  Now, I see how as of right now the warrior are worse than the SKs, pallys, and rangers.  But if you do much to the warriors you guys will be able to blow us away.  I&#39;m a troll SK and my guys is mainly a warrior with a few spells.  If you do all these things you people have listed to the warrior class then warriors will be a super class, be reasonable.  Ask for some small changes.  Not letting their skills increase at 6 a lvl and go up to 300 AND ask for weapon specialization.  A warrior would outdamage a gd WIZARD!  You people are crazy if you except them to make that kind of change.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
