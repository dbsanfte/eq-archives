They said that they would be implementing some<br/>\nnew zones before the expansion as well, and with the expansion comes a whole<br/>\nbunch of stuff. Lizardmen race ( which i think the stats are gonna be<br/>\nsomething like this STR - high STA med AGI way high DEX way high INT Below<br/>\nav WIS below av CHA way low) I just hope that this new race is gonna be more<br/>\nthan just another race of ogres and trolls, i mean if it is then thats<br/>\nboring, 3 races and each of them can only pkc 3 classes....BORING. I think<br/>\nthe class break down of the new race will be something like<br/>\nthis..........1.Warrior 2. Rogue 3. Shaman 4. Shadow Knight Now of course i<br/>\ncould be way wrong about the stats and they might be a really smart bunch of<br/>\nreptiles and they may be the evil version of the high elfs or something ( Uh<br/>\nhuh yeah right, who ever heard of a smart lizard....=) ) But regardless its<br/>\ngonna be cool to have a continent where the only race is an evil<br/>\nrace....thatll make it good for us Dark Elves to go exploring and not worry<br/>\nabout getting KOS. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you guys think about the prospect of a new race? Think they&#39;ll be<br/>\nsmart? like the Dark elves? Or big and powerfull like the Trolls and<br/>\nogres...or more of an evil Halfing style, quick and agile...like i think..<br/>\n<br/>\nLemme know what ya think.<br/>\nJohn Zwanenburg<br/>\nTips Support/Support Sipt<br/>\nTel: (613) 998-2745<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tKelly Pruett[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pruett@...\">pruett@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, June 01, 1999 10:46 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] CAMPING<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Kelly Pruett &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pruett@...\">pruett@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Actually I didn&#39;t know this. :-)  It&#39;s good to hear.
