Could be that fireball<br/>\nis about as annoying to the giant as a bic lighter!  And think of this, how<br/>\nmuch damage can a pen knife do to you?  Think you could be killed by one?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, we can look at EQ as a fantasy setting, or we can make it realistic.<br/>\nIf you want absolute realism, then yes, there is now way a single man with a<br/>\nsword would be likely to kill a giant.  In fact, to use your argument,<br/>\ngiants should be killing everyone with just on stomp, period.  Not the 2 or<br/>\nthree it takes to kill me.  We would also have to do away with that romantic<br/>\nimage of the Knight in shining armor slaying the Dragon with a single blow<br/>\nfrom his sword or lance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to agree that they should probably  have damage modifiers for HUGE<br/>\nmobs that would reduce the base damage inflicted.  These should be applied<br/>\nto both physical weapons and spells though.  Let&#39;s assume that base damage<br/>\nis against med to large creatures.  Of course, the reverse should hold true,<br/>\nthat smaller creature would receive more damage (all those elves, hobbits,<br/>\ngnomes and dwarves beware!).  This would make dragons and giants even<br/>\ntougher then they are now, while making the combat with creatures of similar<br/>\nsize more realistic.  I&#39;ve seen what a broad sward can do, And like I said,<br/>\nwhether your head is cut off or you&#39;re reduced to ashes, your just as dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nLefGrebo<br/>\n<br/>\nBarb Warrior of Halas (Mith Marr)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Tom Swift [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 10, 1999 2:53 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Petition or Melee vs. Caster damage<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Tom Swift&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This arguement still doesn&#39;t make sense to me in a realm <br/>\n&gt; where some of the<br/>\n&gt; opponents are taller than houses.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t care how big your axe is, you aren&#39;t going to be able <br/>\n&gt; to do the<br/>\n&gt; damage that a caster can to some creatures, like a hill giant.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You argument just doesn&#39;t make sense when you apply it to the <br/>\n&gt; setting in EQ.<br/>\n&gt; Sure I can hack someone&#39;s head off in a single swipe and a <br/>\n&gt; mage could blast<br/>\n&gt; them to ashes.

Here it <br/>\n&gt; is again in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;plain text!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I think the difference between melee combatants and casters <br/>\n&gt; magic should be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;thus:  Melee fighters should be able to do just as much <br/>\n&gt; damage, if not<br/>\n&gt; more,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;whereas a caster may strike from a distance, and strike <br/>\n&gt; multiple targets<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with area effect spells.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am the president of a national group that fights with live <br/>\n&gt; steel weapons.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve been fighting with long swords, 2-handed swords, axes <br/>\n&gt; and maces for 10<br/>\n&gt; &gt;years, and I am very comfortable with just how devastating <br/>\n&gt; these weapons<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;be.  No matter if you are struck by lightning or are cut in <br/>\n&gt; 2 by a large<br/>\n&gt; &gt;axe, you are just as dead!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So perhaps the direction we need to seek, and the difference <br/>\n&gt; between these<br/>\n&gt; 2<br/>\n&gt; &gt;types of characters. melee and caster, is not how much <br/>\n&gt; damage they do, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;how.  A caster should be able to reach far away, and strike multiple<br/>\n&gt; &gt;targets, while the great warrior should only be able to strike at one<br/>\n&gt; target<br/>\n&gt; &gt;at a time, but be able to mow them down like wheat.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Oh, and if anyone is interested in an organization that <br/>\n&gt; allow you to wear<br/>\n&gt; &gt;armor and swing a real blade ( and trust me, it will give <br/>\n&gt; you a whole new<br/>\n&gt; &gt;perspective on your RPGing!) check out our website!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;www.adrianempire.org&#92;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;=======================================================<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This email message is for the sole use of the intended <br/>\n&gt; recipient(s) and may<br/>\n&gt; contain confidential and privileged information.
