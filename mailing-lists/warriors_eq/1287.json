I was ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1541695398\">Hey Gang,<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a couple of things to ask right now. Last night i was in lake rathe<br/>\nwith my cleric hoping to score some bronze plate from some drybones. I was<br/>\nin a duo with a level 17 Necromancer and it was going really sweet. During<br/>\nthe day time we would head over to the Aviak treehouse near Jonah Brucker<br/>\nand slaughter birds and when night would approach wed go back to the Karana<br/>\nZone area and take out skels. OK so we started off in day time having a<br/>\nblast killing aviaks every 1 minute cause they spawn so damn fast there and<br/>\nwere earning exp like no tomorrow. THen night comes along and we head over<br/>\nto the undead area. We start off killing a few skeletons gaining some exp<br/>\nbut not too much and wait around for the first drybones to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter about 5 minutes Voila there he is. I call him over with expulse undead<br/>\nfor 91 damage and then the necro sends in his pet to tank and i back off<br/>\nhitting it 5 more times all for 91 damage while the necro is using his DoT<br/>\nspells like heat blood heart flutter and clingin darkness. The thing was at<br/>\nabout 1/4 of health left when another skel spawns and starts attacking it<br/>\ntoo. Now this didnt bother me at all at first. I gave it one more Expulse<br/>\nundead giving the killing blow and what do i see? NO EXP and the corpse<br/>\ndissapears. I rub my eyes and check again,...nope nothing. So i scroll back<br/>\nup seeing if that other skeleton had perhaps got the killing blow which<br/>\nwould make sense. But no, i haad indeed got the blow in. Infact the Normal<br/>\nskele had only hit the drybones once and it was for 16 damage. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo why the heck did we not get to loot the corpse and get no exp?<br/>\n<br/>\nOk next up. After killing a couple more drybones and actually getting some<br/>\nbronze day time came again and we headed back to our aviak killing grounds,.<br/>\nWhen we arrived we saw two Rangers there and decided to let them have it. No<br/>\nbiggie we said we can go kill Jonah Brucker for kicks. (and water --- those<br/>\nwho know who Jonah is will know what im talking about ) so we get there and<br/>\nsure enough Good ol Jonah is there waiting. He cons blue to me (level 17<br/>\ncleric) and he is a monk. I know this because he uses strike. On average he<br/>\nhits for about 20 damage max on me. My necro friend was afk for one second<br/>\nwhile i was engaging Jonah, who i can normally kill with no problems. I<br/>\ncall him out and he runs up to me with a dagger in hand. Odd i think to<br/>\nmyself, must be a rare weapon or something. All of a sudden i see my heatlth<br/>\nbegin to plummet as Jonah is peircing me for 36 and always, ALWAYS getting<br/>\ndouble attack in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldnt belive it, i could not even heal myself. When i died he latched<br/>\nonto my necro friend who then suffered the same fate. Well we were bound on<br/>\nthe same spot that we died on so we memed our spells and then killed him. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy was a monk that conned blue to me kicking my ass with a rusty dagger?<br/>\nThats what his dagger was by the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk next up. We decide Jonah sucks and decide to explore a little bit before<br/>\nheading back over to the undead spawn spot. We pass near the barbarian<br/>\nvillage and my friend gets to close. Three of them latch on to him and he<br/>\nhas to engage them. I come along to help and see that they all con blue to<br/>\nme so we start fighting away and eventually win. No biggie, no factions go<br/>\nup or down or anything. We rest and med up and explore some more. We come<br/>\nacross another inlet that has two human guards wearing plate with no<br/>\nweapons. They con indifferent and blue to me but i keep my distance just to<br/>\nbe safe. All of a sudden one of the two guards comes runnning up to me and<br/>\nstartsto fight me, first attack i dodged so i say oh well no where to run to<br/>\nso may as well kill the guard. Then it hits me.....The guard punches me<br/>\nPUNCHES me twice (double attack) for 98 damage! HOLY #&$%! Run i yell to my<br/>\nbuddy and he casts invis on himself as i watch myself die.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone explain this to me. Why is a guard that cons blue to a level 17<br/>\ncleric hitting me for more than a sand giant would? Just curious.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well i shouldnt complain, i died twice last night in lake rathe but in 3<br/>\nhours there i made 4 bubbles of exp (after dying even! ) I suggest you all<br/>\ngo there at around level 17 it rocks. Aside from the crap that goes on<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways let me know if anyone can explain this stuff to me<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nRayneT&#39;Kazz</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
