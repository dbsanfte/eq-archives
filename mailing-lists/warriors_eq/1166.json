When most hybrid-magic user classes get to that level they can <br/>\neither root, or get a pet that will engage the creature while he or she <br/>\ncasts (wherein they usually don&#39;t need long because they deal out the most <br/>\ndamage).  I am a lev 17 warrior and blue cons can take me down to 1/3 hp, it <br/>\nthen takes me a half hour to heal back up.  While I have a cleric who is <br/>\ntaking on white cons with little problem.  I have to agree that warriors are <br/>\nnecessary, but only to the level before casters come into their own. And fyi <br/>\nI have a fellow mate who is a level 18 wiz with all his points put into int <br/>\nand he has only 100 less hp than I have. Another overlooked characteristic <br/>\nis that casters can hit magic only creatures from the begining, while <br/>\nwarriors have to run around for weeks trying to save up the money for a <br/>\nspecial weapon (wich are way overpriced), and most of the time we end up <br/>\nrunning from green con&#39;s because we can&#39;t hit them.  I only use my warrior <br/>\nnow to get money and equipment for other characters and roleplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nArathorne, Solsek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Zwanenburg, John&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Warriors vs Wizards<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 11 Jun 1999 10:53:18 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Zwanenburg, John&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I whole heartedly agree with you wayne.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The game is about balance. Some people are saying that a group of really<br/>\n&gt;high levels do not need warriors. I say thats BS my friends always want my<br/>\n&gt;warrior in their group. Not just becuase im company mind you. Because they<br/>\n&gt;are spell casters. If im not there, the MOB would latch onto them and<br/>\n&gt;interrupt their casting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sure we could beg verant for one more skill .... critical hit , which is a<br/>\n&gt;very good idea. And i like the idea of it being like ripsote and parry.<br/>\n&gt;Makes more sense. But the fact of the matter is this: We are there to<br/>\n&gt;prevent our spellcasting buddies from being hit by creatures so that THEY<br/>\n&gt;can dish out the damage. I have never had anyone complain to me and say <br/>\n&gt;look<br/>\n&gt;man we dont want you in the group anymore cause you doont dish out the most<br/>\n&gt;damage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Every group needs a good strong warrior.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;John<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: \tWayne Sheppard[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: \tFriday, June 11, 1999 10:26 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Warriors vs Wizards<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Many of the Warriors here have complained that they cannot do damage as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fast<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as a Wizard.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now all of you real life ninjas and steel sword swinging fools just calm<br/>\n&gt; &gt; down.
