According to the folks at EQ, the higher levels get more of the XP, this is to encourage people to stay with their same level and to dissuade tanks in ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-999247858\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; I hope you kind sirs will pardon the unspeakable ignorance of a young lad<br/>\n&gt; such as myself. I have seven questions:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 4. How is experience divided in a group?  Is it the same amout as solo,<br/>\n&gt; split<br/>\n&gt; into shares, or is there more total experience given out?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>According to the folks at EQ, the higher levels get more of the XP, this is<br/>\nto encourage people to stay with their same level and to dissuade &quot;tanks&quot; in<br/>\nthe traditional style (i.e. the 31st level warrior standing there taking all<br/>\nthe hits while the 5th level warrior hits for all the XP.) According to<br/>\nthem, the gap between levels gets longer the higher level you are, so that a<br/>\n25th and a 32nd level can get about the same xp, but between an 11th and a<br/>\n5thm the 11th would get ALL of the xp. That&#39;s the scheme as far as I know<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 6. Are there any quests to become non-PvP?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok, as far as I have heard.......no. If you are on any server other than the<br/>\nPvP server, YOU made the choice to be PvP or Non PvP. I don&#39;t know how it is<br/>\nfor all races, but in order for me to become PvP I have to give a Priest Of<br/>\nDiscord the Lore Book that I started with. As I was not ready to get my arse<br/>\nkicked in by everyone who could PvP, I put the book in my vault until I am<br/>\nready to give it to him.....if ever. Players who made the choice to PvP have<br/>\na red name instead of a blue one like everyone else. And to my knowledge, if<br/>\nyou chose to be PvP no amount of questing will change that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You have my deepest gratitude in advance for any information.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rocjaw,<br/>\n&gt; Son of Halas<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hope I helped a little bit =]<br/>\n<br/>\nTyveris,<br/>\nAspiring Samurai</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
