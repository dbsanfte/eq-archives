(Wish I could have started my first character that way). To make a long story short, I was killed, and when I was brought back, my Rune Sword was gone.  In it&#39;s place, was my beginners short sword, that I had previously destroyed.  My question is:  Is the Rune Sword a Lore item?  I had a Wisp Stone in my inventory, which is a Lore item. I realize that it would disappear in the event that I logged off.  But in this case, I had died.  Upon resurrection, you can imagine my dismay to find my Rune Sword gone, and the beginners sword back in my inventory.  Was this a glitch?  Should I petition a GM?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Thanks,<br/>\n    Leri</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
