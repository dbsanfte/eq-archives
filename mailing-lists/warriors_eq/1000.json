I have no idea how<br/>\nmany people it killed, it defiantly killed everyone who was at the Orc camp.<br/>\nMy partner and I managed to dodge the giant 3 times, he got us on the 4th<br/>\ncircuit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThats just rude, you dont KITE something like a giant, especially when it<br/>\nresides in a low level zone.  I dont mind dieing because of a fight that I<br/>\nstarted, but to be kited is just frustrating.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
