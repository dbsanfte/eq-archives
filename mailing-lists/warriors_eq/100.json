If<br/>\nyou join a fight in progress, you may inflict more damage and get the kill<br/>\nand thus the other guy does not get the xp from the fight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I do is target the mob and then target the other guy.  Assess if he<br/>\nneeds help by looking at the difference in hp - this may be the 2nd or 3rd<br/>\nmob he has been fighting and even though it&#39;s a scrawny, he maybe low on hp<br/>\nand would like some help.<br/>\n<br/>\nBB is where some people go for loot - others go there for the high MD.<br/>\nThere are usually lots of kills laying around free for anyone to loot.  And<br/>\neven some dead guards and elites just laying there waiting for the looters<br/>\ntime to expire.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone gets so bad with insults, I just go: &quot;don&#39;t make me /ignore you!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSnyak.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tschlaban yocksovik [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anonymaste@...\">anonymaste@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tMonday, May 17, 1999 9:02 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [warriors_eq] A question on kill<br/>\nstealing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;schlaban yocksovik&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anonymaste@...\">anonymaste@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\twell if you saw the person that was hackin the mob die and<br/>\nyou took over its <br/>\n\t\tyour kill.<br/>\n\t\tAnd as far as im concerned, bb is a special case.<br/>\n\t\tThe trains in there are worse then any other area I have<br/>\never seen.<br/>\n\t\tThere are so many mobs there that if one gets killed or<br/>\nstolen its often not <br/>\n\t\tdone with evil intentions but done to help someone.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tYes most damage always count.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tDepending on class I would come up with a nifty comment.<br/>\n\t\tingame insults always work<br/>\n\t\tooc insults though is something I realy dont like.<br/>\n\t\tI would have just insulted him for being <br/>\n\t\tshort/skinny/tall/ugly/weak/archmage wannabee, just<br/>\nanything.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\ttake care<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tVashi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt;From: Kelly Pruett &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pruett@...\">pruett@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n\t\t&gt;<br/>\n\t\t&gt;Hi all,<br/>\n\t\t&gt;I&#39;ve been a roleplayer and a mudder for years now. I&#39;ve<br/>\n </span></blockquote>come to EQ like<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt;most of us, with a lot of experience in multiplayer gaming.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now, I&#39;m<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt;fairly new to EQ (level 8) but I thought I had a good<br/>\n </span></blockquote>understanding of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt;it, and it&#39;s unwritten rules, until now.<br/>\n\t\t&gt;<br/>\n\t\t&gt;The other night I was in BlackBurrow in a small group of 3.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Two of us<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt;were at the bottom level, and I was up top, returning from<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a town run. I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt;saw a gnoll guardsman kill someone, so I ran up to take<br/>\n </span></blockquote>charge of it.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt;There was nobody else around it. After a few hits it fled<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to the lower<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt;level with me chasing it every step, hacking and kicking.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Upon reaching<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt;the lower level, there was a mini train already down there,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but both me,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt;and the members of my group, were working on the gnoll<br/>\n </span></blockquote>guardsman I had<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt;chased down.
