About 3 to 5 ogres<br/>\nof various sizes and classes. Probably random like the bandits. I did encounter<br/>\none hill giant there once. He was crossing the small mountain between the ogre<br/>\ncamp and a remote shop that I like to sell loot to. If I remember correctly it<br/>\nonly took him three hits to pound me into the ground.
