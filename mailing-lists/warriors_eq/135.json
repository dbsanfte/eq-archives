Hopefully soon I will have enougth plat to afford<br/>\n&gt; my <br/>\n&gt; dream weapon of a combine long sword (I have 10 plat now).<br/>\n&gt;    Any good suggestions for hunting in and around Freeport?  Didn&#39;t like <br/>\n&gt; befallen to much since I don&#39;t have a magic weapon yet.  Kind of a bummer <br/>\n&gt; when you have to run from a skel that cons blue since I can&#39;t hit him.<br/>\n&gt;    Haven&#39;t been down to see Troll Town yet.
