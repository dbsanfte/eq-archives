Again, on the<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxx<br/>\n&gt; &gt;server.  I left Neriak at level 3, and traveled to the land of Faydwer.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;got an invis, and ran to CB cave, hopping to raise my faction enough to<br/>\n&gt; allow<br/>\n&gt; &gt;me into the city.  Alas, I am now level 12, and I have recently been<br/>\n&gt; informed<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that I can NEVER change the faction with the elves.  Somewhat upset, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;arranged for an invis to the dwarven lands, in hopes of acceptance there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;But, as the time for my departure drew near, I ambandoned leaving,<br/>\n&gt; refusing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to belive nothing could be done.  So, I decided to start a petition of<br/>\n&gt; sorts<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to help change this.  So, what I propose is that they allow me to change<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;faction standings, just make it take a while.  I know humans are not<br/>\n&gt; looked<br/>\n&gt; &gt;upon as the greatest of friends to the elves, so let&#39;s say that it takes<br/>\n&gt; 200<br/>\n&gt; &gt;orc kills for them to go from one fac level to the next.  So, make if 400<br/>\n&gt; &gt;orcs for me to go from one to the next.  Or maybe more like 600.  Make it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hard, but not impossable.  Anyway, I ask you to sent them feedback asking<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this, because I would like to be able to walk outside without a guard<br/>\n&gt; walking<br/>\n&gt; &gt;by and killing me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;They both have communities at ONElist.
