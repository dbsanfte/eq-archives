It is wonderful to change camera view just to watch as the <br/>\ntwo swords fly.  Attack, Attack, Attack, Attack, Bash, Attack, Attack, <br/>\nAttack, Attack, Attack, Attack, Bash!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, will have to see how good I am with my 2H Sword once I max out the <br/>\nskill.  Like I said it works well now (24 to 25 a hit - with double attack <br/>\nup to 50 per round), but I still think my two longswords rule.  Saving cash <br/>\nnow to buy a second combine longsword.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing; talking to a 21 level warrior last night, the BBC is to him <br/>\nthe best weapon he has seen.  Of course it is a 2H weapon, so 2H Slashing is <br/>\nimportant to keep up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all my opinion as a level 15 Barbarian Warrior Princess.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of Rellos Zek;<br/>\n<br/>\nPatty of Halas<br/>\nusername: Patricia<br/>\nserver: Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
