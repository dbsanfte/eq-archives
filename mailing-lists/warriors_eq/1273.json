Listen<br/>\n&gt; to this!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Kelly Pruett &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pruett@...\">pruett@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can feel the pain that both of you are having. The group of five that I<br/>\n&gt; play with<br/>\n&gt; just came from CB after killing everything in there but Dvinn many, many<br/>\n&gt; times. My<br/>\n&gt; experiences were as follows:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1.) High levels constantly camped the eqipment mobs. We were there for a<br/>\n&gt; reason, to<br/>\n&gt; get our Cleric ONE screaming mace (needs two items). In order to do that<br/>\n&gt; we had to<br/>\n&gt; log on at odd times just to get the two items we needed. At times there<br/>\n&gt; were<br/>\n&gt; multiple groups from the SAME guild, camping the mobs nearly a weekend at<br/>\n&gt; a time. It<br/>\n&gt; took the better part of three weeks to get TWO items.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2.) Most all of the solo high level campers were spellcasters. I can<br/>\n&gt; recall 2<br/>\n&gt; wizzies, 2 necros, and a mage. All level 20+ since they had 2 names but<br/>\n&gt; other than<br/>\n&gt; that, they were anon so we could not determine level. Why were they there?<br/>\n&gt; I have no<br/>\n&gt; idea. They all played solo, and they all dealt more damage than any<br/>\n&gt; grouped party<br/>\n&gt; without a spellcaster, thus winning the kill.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3.) At the time we had a group of 5 characters: a lvl 15 pally, a lvl 15<br/>\n&gt; warrior, a<br/>\n&gt; lvl 14 warrior, a lvl 15 thief, a lvl 14 cleric. While we wre there, there<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; levels even went up to further add to our damage dealing power. Despite<br/>\n&gt; this, at no<br/>\n&gt; time were we able to get a kill when ANY other party contained a wizard.<br/>\n&gt; Even if<br/>\n&gt; they were solo wizards only one or two levels above us. Typical scenario<br/>\n&gt; ... we have<br/>\n&gt; the spawn, we attack and damage the mob to about 3/4 or 1/2 damage when<br/>\n&gt; *fzzzzt* a<br/>\n&gt; spellcaster nukes the mob, trains it to him and then finishes with a few<br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; spells. We would always chase,but we could never get the kill when this<br/>\n&gt; happened.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4.) A solo spellcaster can fry a mob in about 30 to 45 seconds with 5 or 6<br/>\n&gt; strong<br/>\n&gt; spells, followed by about a 5 minute &#39;meditation enhanced&#39; downtime. A<br/>\n&gt; solo warrior<br/>\n&gt; can kill a mob in about 1 to 3 minutes with many, many hits, followed by<br/>\n&gt; up to 15<br/>\n&gt; minutes of pure butt sitting. Anyone else think this is slightly unfair<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; gameplay?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We had kills stolen many many times and nothing frustrates you more than<br/>\n&gt; bleeding<br/>\n&gt; from a mob that is stolen from you in mid fight. We tried getting<br/>\n&gt; spellcasters into<br/>\n&gt; our group, but at our level, most were doing better playing solo. From all<br/>\n&gt; of this I<br/>\n&gt; gathered that two things need to be done.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One, if Verant wants to give groups a better advantage than solos, then by<br/>\n&gt; all means<br/>\n&gt; allow group damage to overcome the &#39;single greatest damage dealer gets the<br/>\n&gt; kill&#39;<br/>\n&gt; rule. Or bump it up somehow. It doesn&#39;t have to be much but for god sakes<br/>\n&gt; ... people<br/>\n&gt; having fun as a team should be rewarded for their organization and<br/>\n&gt; coordination. It<br/>\n&gt; requires effort and patience to play well as a team. It requires nearly<br/>\n&gt; nothing to<br/>\n&gt; play well alone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Two, wizzies need to be toned down on solo just a little. I have nothing<br/>\n&gt; against<br/>\n&gt; powerful wizards. I have EVERYTHING against solos who steal other people&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; kills in<br/>\n&gt; mid battle. Or even if they are grouped for that matter.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can anyone think of a GOOD way to prevent these type of activities? I<br/>\n&gt; cannot. We&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; discussed it in our group many times but could not come up with much. Any<br/>\n&gt; input on<br/>\n&gt; this post, or the two previous, would be great to hear. Maybe it will<br/>\n&gt; cheer me up<br/>\n&gt; some.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Rosmorte<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; P.S.- By the way, great tip on the kill stealing Druid. Thanks for that<br/>\n&gt; tactical<br/>\n&gt; advice Surtur.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sigurd@...\">sigurd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sigurd@...\">sigurd@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know how frustrating this is. I was 12 or 13 at the Chessboard in<br/>\n&gt; butcherblock<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with about 3 other people,  one cleric and 2 other hybrids . A 13th<br/>\n&gt; druid showed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up and was able to outdamage us and was clearly using us as his tanks<br/>\n&gt; while<br/>\n&gt; &gt; taking all of the experience. We asked him if he wanted to alternate<br/>\n&gt; kills, or a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; number of other solutions that would benefit us both. But he clearly<br/>\n&gt; wanted to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get every kill he could grab from us, while he took no damage from them.<br/>\n&gt; He even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; told us he would leave when he reached 14 so he could get his next rank<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spells.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So we decided that the next king would get it&#39;s attention and no-one<br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; attack it, so when he started blasting it would go for him. He tried<br/>\n&gt; training it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on us and we just kept fleeing from it so it was focused on him. Then he<br/>\n&gt; trained<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it on someone on the otherside of the board and stole the kill from<br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If verant is encouraging us to work to gether, the code needs to be<br/>\n&gt; changed so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that the experience goes to the Group that does the most damage, not the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; individual who does the most. This allowed this druid to steal them from<br/>\n&gt; us and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; use my party as his shield. If we as a group were the determining factor<br/>\n&gt; in who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gets the xp, then he would not have been able to do this. This would<br/>\n&gt; also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; encourage players to form larger groups to overcome problems like this<br/>\n&gt; on our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; own and not have to petition them. In this situation we could of<br/>\n&gt; outdamage him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and taken the kills that were ours and he would have gotten frustrated<br/>\n&gt; and left,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or worked on getting a lerger group on his own that would have forced us<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; leave. I&#39;m sure there could be abuses with this rule change, so please<br/>\n&gt; let me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know what they are.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Surtur<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 16th warrior, E&#39;ci server.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jeff Lynch wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Jeff Lynch &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jlynch13@...\">jlynch13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I play a 38th halfling warrior on Povar...

He spawned and I<br/>\n&gt; attacked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him... low and behold a wizzie... AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE.... ran into<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; room, and started blasting him!
