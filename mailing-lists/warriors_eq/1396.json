I would love to get <br/>\nmy Dark Elf in there and do that.  Right now, all guards from the boat to the <br/>\nfront gates of Kaladim regard me warmly, and after that, it&#39;s KOS all the way <br/>\nto the zone to Greater Faydark.  Is there another thing that needs killing to <br/>\nmake the dwarves around there like me?  I lost over 1 bubble and level 14 <br/>\nbecause I thought that the dwarves liked me, then one just killed me.  No <br/>\nchance to run far enough away, so I had to go back to Faydwer from the South <br/>\nGate of Freeport.  Got there, tried to use /corpse, but it was too far away, <br/>\ngot closer and the dwarf killed me again.  Back in Freeport.  Took the boat <br/>\nagain, got the first body back.  Got an invis, used /corpse command over and <br/>\nover to drag it.  Accidentally right clicked corpse.  Became visable, killed <br/>\nagain.  One more time on the boat, and I finally got my stuff back.  So, if <br/>\nthere is any way that I can give the dwarf the belts without being by it, I <br/>\nwould really, really appreciate the info.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
