I am also trying to get into touch with the writter of the letter to<br/>\nenlist his help.  I have only almost attained level 31.  But in the time I<br/>\nhave played, and having interaction with some other players (warriors and<br/>\nmonk) I am a firm believer in the warrior is/will be not worth having in a<br/>\ngroup of high level players.  Sure, he will always be able to tank, but<br/>\nother than that, he will have no participation in a group.  The proverbial<br/>\npunching bag.  Every skill we have is shared with a hybrid group.  We get<br/>\nnothing special at all.  I do not want to be a cry baby, but this just seems<br/>\nunfair to me.  Something to make the warrior stand out as the class that you<br/>\nneed to have when in physical combat would be nice.  I mean isnt that the<br/>\ntrue calling of a warrior?  Many of the ideas you have submitted to me so<br/>\nfar are really good.  And I will put together a complete list of everything<br/>\nwe come up with.  I will not send this to verant until we get enough to make<br/>\na good selection from.  Then when I send it to them, it will be &quot;this is<br/>\nsome of the options that we have come up with... what do you think&quot; type<br/>\nattitude.  They should listen to us, they listen to everyone else.  Why<br/>\nalienate one class when they are bending over backwards for others?<br/>\n<br/>\nDyvim Kincaid<br/>\nStormriders of Cazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 10, 1999 1:06 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Cut and Paste form EQ&#39;Lizer<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What Verant needs to do and I think trys to do is provide<br/>\n&gt; distinction among<br/>\n&gt; the classes without having any one class over-shadow all of the others.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Although my experience is minimal compared to your (my level 13 and your<br/>\n&gt; level 43 (44?)), I would support your petition to ensure that the warrior<br/>\n&gt; class is made to be distictive and the one true melee combat class.� If<br/>\n&gt; Verant has erred somewhere by allowing all of the &quot;add-on&quot; things of the<br/>\n&gt; hybrid classes to cause these classes to compete with or go<br/>\n&gt; further than the<br/>\n&gt; warriors in the higher levels, then they need to do something to fix it.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d hate to spend all my time getting to where you are and end up feeling<br/>\n&gt; like it was just not worth it.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Snyak<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: James Wofford [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:James.Wofford@...\">James.Wofford@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 10, 1999 1:28 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Cut and Paste form EQ&#39;Lizer<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am not actually board with my character, just tired of waiting for the<br/>\n&gt; goodies to come when they are actually no where to be found.� They will<br/>\n&gt; never get to us, and we are outweighed even in a group setting by other<br/>\n&gt; melee classes.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; I am not so concerned about the magic using/healing/gating part<br/>\n&gt; of this as I<br/>\n&gt; am the fact that the masters of physical combat (warriors) are<br/>\n&gt; anything but<br/>\n&gt; that.� Healing never has been IMO a part of what a warrior can do.� But a<br/>\n&gt; warrior is supposed to be the master or armed combat.� When we cap out at<br/>\n&gt; skill level 200 and others can go beyond that as well as do more<br/>\n&gt; damage than<br/>\n&gt; us warrior, something is definitely wrong.� I think we should start a<br/>\n&gt; pettition to verant to try to even things out a bit more.� The suggestions<br/>\n&gt; in this post on EQ`Lizer for modifying the Warrior class are well thought<br/>\n&gt; and not too much to ask.�<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; If anyone else is at all interested in starting a pettition, I will get<br/>\n&gt; things going.� Just let me know and I can get things rolling on<br/>\n&gt; it....� Even<br/>\n&gt; if you dont respond to me on this, I will get things going anyways.�<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Elena Glenn [ mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:braveheart@...\">braveheart@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:braveheart@...\">braveheart@...</a>&gt; ]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 10, 1999 11:27 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [warriors_eq] Cut and Paste form EQ&#39;Lizer<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; James....I also am getting a little bored with my level 19 Barbarian<br/>\n&gt; Warrior.� One of the reasons, I guess, that I started the Bard.�<br/>\n&gt; I do think<br/>\n&gt; that Verant has overlooked us slightly.� When I played Realm, the<br/>\n&gt; warrior on<br/>\n&gt; there could buy mana and cast spells.� Agreed, they didn&#39;t work as well as<br/>\n&gt; the mages did, but we still could have the basics.� I would like to see<br/>\n&gt; Verant come up with another plan.� Perhaps some sort of magic skill, so at<br/>\n&gt; the very least, we could gate and cast healing on ourselves.�<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Leri<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
