Im a warrior and<br/>\nwe all know that at my level if I dont have a partner I may as well logout.<br/>\nCatch 22.<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately I have real-life friends to fall back on, but that means<br/>\nrestarting my character or playing two characters.  Either way its a pain.<br/>\nOh well, back to level 1 for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Morix@...\">Morix@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Morix@...\">Morix@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tFriday, May 28, 1999 6:21 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Farming and stuff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Morix@...\">Morix@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Someone else said:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I hate it when people get twinked out like you.  Its people like you that<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; cause the camping &gt;problem.  Your guildmates camped for their items, which<br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have a problem with, the &gt;continued FARMING to get items for <br/>\n&gt; guildmates, blah.  I&#39;ve never had a single magic item &gt;given to me, I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; been <br/>\n&gt; there beside my guild buds working to get my items the whole &gt;game......ok<br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; shut up now<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yeah, and I bet you also had to walk to school barefoot in the snow uphill<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; both ways, right?  Look, regarding this whole &quot;twinking&quot; thing (a name I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; not heard before I read this list), I think the ones complaining are the<br/>\n&gt; ones <br/>\n&gt; who don&#39;t really understand the spirit of the game.  They are the ones who<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t realize forming parties and guilds is encouraged, and that while <br/>\n&gt; remaining solo might be fun sometimes, it just plain won&#39;t be as effective<br/>\n&gt; as <br/>\n&gt; being part of a group.  So then we have these soloists running about<br/>\n&gt; whining <br/>\n&gt; about &quot;farmers&quot;.  My response to that is thus: big fat hairy deal.<br/>\n&gt; Norrath <br/>\n&gt; is huge and up 24 hrs. a day.  Go find some uninhabited area and start<br/>\n&gt; your <br/>\n&gt; own farm.  I have zero sympathy for someone whining about how he can&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; a <br/>\n&gt; tomahawk axe.  Go and kill-steal one.  If they were farming (and being<br/>\n&gt; rude <br/>\n&gt; about it to boot), then they deserve to have a few kills stolen anyway.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;                       Free Games, Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt;             Gamesville - World&#39;s Biggest Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;                 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
