The extent of the change in<br/>\nrelation to what has been proposed is another thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure other classes will gripe after the warrior class is looked at<br/>\nand changed, but that is the nature of change. Once one things change<br/>\nyou have to look and see how it has affected other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust MHO,<br/>\n<br/>\nAz<br/>\n<br/>\nClancy AKA Bob wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;   If they actually did that to the warrior class, let them advance 6 a<br/>\n&gt; lvl, there would be no stopping them.  Some of you may not want to see<br/>\n&gt; this, but at gameznet.com/eq there is a new post about the success at<br/>\n&gt; duel wielding and double attack.  With all these updates you guys<br/>\n&gt; would nonstop 4 hit attack.  Now, I see how as of right now the<br/>\n&gt; warrior are worse than the SKs, pallys, and rangers.  But if you do<br/>\n&gt; much to the warriors you guys will be able to blow us away.  I&#39;m a<br/>\n&gt; troll SK and my guys is mainly a warrior with a few spells.  If you do<br/>\n&gt; all these things you people have listed to the warrior class then<br/>\n&gt; warriors will be a super class, be reasonable.  Ask for some small<br/>\n&gt; changes.  Not letting their skills increase at 6 a lvl and go up to<br/>\n&gt; 300 AND ask for weapon specialization.  A warrior would outdamage a gd<br/>\n&gt; WIZARD!  You people are crazy if you except them to make that kind of<br/>\n&gt; change. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
