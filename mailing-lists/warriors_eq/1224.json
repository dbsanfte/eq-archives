A sword swing could be a critical strike, or maybe a kick could be, or<br/>\neven a bash could be a critical strike.  Any attack can be used to deliver<br/>\ncritical damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond point.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Having the abilities go up like parry and dodge would make it too powerful<br/>\nI believe. They go up without the need to use them.  &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing you are doing by making this an invoked skill is giving<br/>\nwarriors another key to tap repeatedly in combat.  You are forcing warriors<br/>\nto choose between most likely doing 11 damage with a kick or maybe getting a<br/>\ncritical hit.  I don&#39;t agree.  Warriors can and should use everything at<br/>\ntheir disposal, slash and kick or bash, and at the same time be looking for<br/>\nan opportunity to strike a critical hit.  A critical hit is not something<br/>\nyou just decided to do, you take an opportunity. Your suggestion indicates<br/>\nthat parry/dodge is a random part of combat.  I argue that it is indeed a<br/>\nskill, one which I wish was successful more often.  It isn&#39;t random because<br/>\na warrior will endeavor to parry and dodge all attacks, and not just<br/>\nrandomly manage to avoid them.  I speak from real life experience on this<br/>\none not just about the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see where you are going with the critical hit thing, but in the context of<br/>\nEQ the usefulness of the skill would be much hampered by your &quot;invoked&quot;<br/>\nmethod.  The average gamers style of play is to pick an attack and keep<br/>\nusing it.  I for one, would simply max out my critical hit skill in party<br/>\nfighting against yellow and red mobs.  Then I would use the skill at every<br/>\nopportunity.  My dark elf warrior would likely max the skill in a single<br/>\nlevel, and be very successful using it.  I fear that barbarians, ogres and<br/>\ntrolls would be at a disadvantage here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am solidly convinced that the parry/dodge method is the right way to go,<br/>\nand let EQ check when to use the skill and check its success.  Then critical<br/>\nhit won&#39;t just become a replacement for kick/bash but instead become the<br/>\nreal enhancement to our class we all think is needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jones, Brian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, June 14, 1999 11:50 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [warriors_eq] Warriors vs Hybrids<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What I mean by &#39;knowing&#39; is that as a master of melee, I will be able to<br/>\n&gt;&#39;set up&#39; my opponent for a critical strike.

The assumption being that the kick of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; bash could potentiall be the critical hit. As a warrior you are going to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; always try and do the most damage you can.  With &quot;critical hit&quot; skill it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; depends on how skilled you are is how often you succeed.  Kicking an orc<br/>\n&gt;&gt; in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the gonads qualifies as a critical hit. Also, you said that you would<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &quot;know&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; when the right time for a critical hit is.....how could you know that?  I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; am<br/>\n&gt;&gt; not sure what you mean by this.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Just to reiterate. I think the critical hit skill should be checked<br/>\n&gt;&gt; automatically against each and every strike.  The percentage chance for a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; critical hit is proportionate to the skill level.  It would be something<br/>\n&gt;&gt; like dodge/parry/riposte I think, though I am not sure how those checks<br/>\n&gt;&gt; are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; calculated.  The damage caused by this strike should be based on the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; weapon<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you are using, perhaps the damage rating x 2.  So a longsword would be 12<br/>\n&gt;&gt; points (6 dmg?) and a 2 handed sword would be 24 (12 dmg).

They not only get some minor healing spells,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; but<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; also are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; able to do root spells, direct damage spells, so they can kick,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; attack,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and cast<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; spells doing more damage than us. They also get spells that are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; useful<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; entire party like camoflage and SOW allowing the party to travel<br/>\n </span></blockquote>more<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; safely.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ok boy i seem like a flamer but again. If you want spells play a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ranger<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; warriors should not have spells. and as ranger spell damage. Look at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; spells<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; level 9 - Flame lick (uhm more like lame lick) it does a whole WOPPING<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 5<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   points of damage. Boy that sure deals a lot<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Level 15 - Lighting. At level 15 it is a slower spell to cast it does<br/>\n&gt;&gt; do<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;    25 points of damage MAX. And it burns through mana quickly<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; And we do get spells beyond this. As for camoflage well yes rangers<br/>\n&gt;&gt; should<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be able to cast this spell seeing they are one of the best at knowing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lands<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Changes:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; - I like the idea of eliminating the skill cap of 200 and giving us<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bonus in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; combat related skills.

After all Verant stated that they hybrids<br/>\n </span></blockquote>gave<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; up<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; something to get those spells and extra abilities. I don&#39;t see a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; problem<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dual Wield because many of us grew up with D&D&#39;s image of rangers<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wielding two<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; swords. If paladins appear to be struggling at later levels they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; might<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; get<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Double Attack to allow them to keep up with the rangers.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I do not agree with this at all. Let rangers have double attack sure<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; seems unfair but Rangers do not have the all might god spell casting<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ability of a pure spell caster. Look at rangers for a second and what<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; levels they get spells at. This is what gets annoying to me when<br/>\n </span></blockquote>people<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; do<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this. Rangers have druid type damage spells. Rangers get the spells<br/>\n </span></blockquote>way<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; later when mob&#39;s end up being tougher to begin with. You people keep<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; blowing this spell stuff WAY out of the water.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -It&#39;s been stated that at higher levels that the casters are doing<br/>\n </span></blockquote>so<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; much<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; damage that we cannot Taunt the Mobs off of them. So I think that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Taunt<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; should<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; be boosted at higher levels causing the Mobs to pay more attention<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; us<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and do<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; our job of keeping thier attention while the caster burn them.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That is the casters fault.. think about it for a second it seems like<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; keep jumping to conclusions. You have 500 hit points. Someone casts a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; spell on you and hits you for 100 points of damage. And another thing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; hitting you for 40 points a round max. The person hitting you for 40<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; points says some naughty words at you. Who would you kill first? No<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; question I would kill the thing that is hitting me harder first. ITS<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; CALLED ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE. Taunt does work i have used it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; successfully<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; many of times. The part it seems to be going wrong is your dumb wizard<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; keeps casting 1 spell right after another. And i think that would piss<br/>\n&gt;&gt; me<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; off a little bit more then someone saying a few bad words about my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; mother.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -I also really like the critical hit skill. It should be innate like<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Parry and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dodge. It would help us more of an asset to a party instead of a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; spell<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; casting<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; warrior that can track like the rangers are now. They just seem to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; many of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the same advantages we have and sacrificed nothing to get thier<br/>\n&gt;&gt; spells<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; tracking and other abilites.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Now this is something that SHOULD be done... maybe not a critical hit.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; How<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about this just think about it before you start flaming<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Warriors are the masters of fighting melee combat. They SHOULD know<br/>\n&gt;&gt; their<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; enemy and SHOULD know vital points of striking are. How about a random<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Vital Hit where it would come out of the blue sort of like the mob<br/>\n </span></blockquote>made<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mistake in an attempted hit at you but you dodge or miss because your<br/>\n&gt;&gt; read<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that attack and you used this to your KEEN ability and hit them in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; open vital spot maybe for 1.5 to 2 times the normal damage. Even<br/>\n&gt;&gt; better..<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it doesnt start at level 1 or lvl 20. Maybe around level 25 or so you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; start to become a more knowledgable warrior being through the years<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; many fights. You become more masterable at fighting and you train in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; this<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; skill with your leader and the better you raise in the skill the more<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; often this vital hit will appear. The good points about this are it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; will<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not WACK the balance out of the game. Warriors WILL indeed be the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; masters<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of fighting with this tactic. Warriors would be wanted WAY more by<br/>\n&gt;&gt; groups<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; because of this nice little ability. I think everyone would not mind<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; due to the fact that it is not a HUGE ability but it is something that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; will distinguish your warrior from ANY other class. Now all of you are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; probably saying ONLY 1.5 to 2X DAMAGE?!!?! LAME. well if you say this<br/>\n&gt;&gt; then<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you most likly arent thinking so let me explain why only that much.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I carry a nice 2 handed sword. (shows nice weapon)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I hit for a maximum of 25 dmg lets say.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 1.5X that would be about 43 dmg in 1 swing? wow i like that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 2X dmg that would be 50 DMG in 1 swing with only a 2h sword. NICE<br/>\n&gt;&gt; damage<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; but not WAY out of control.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The damage could vary on armor the mob is wearing seeing as yes that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; would<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; soak up some damage.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I would love to hear anyones flames or cheers for this idea.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KLAEN<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Deadline is June 19.
