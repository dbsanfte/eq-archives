In <br/>\nprevious lives I have been a Paladin, a Wizard, and a Monk (not here in <br/>\nNorrath, but another world/MUD).  There is no better way to experience the <br/>\nworld that is Norrath than as a warrior deep in the heart of battle.  I have <br/>\nno need to role-play, as I live my role every time my group goes out on a <br/>\nhunt.  With 500+ hitpoints, two long swords (one combine, the other fine <br/>\nsteel), and no fear of death, I can think of no better true killing machine <br/>\non the battlefield.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sure magic users have powerful magic spells that cause a great deal of <br/>\ndamage in one shot, but it is warrior that must maintain the fight while the <br/>\nmagic users rest to regain mana or run like frightened rabbits to zone when <br/>\nthey get hit a couple of times.  A good fight for me is my group geting <br/>\njumped by five of six MoBs, each capable of killing any one of the magic <br/>\nusers with ease.  I wade into the front and just start hacking and taunting <br/>\nuntil everything is dead in front of me.  Oh sure, I might be down to 5 hit <br/>\npoints (yes it happens), but the group will always remain alive.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One day I will lead the attack on that silly dragon camped in Sol B.  No <br/>\nother class can truly call themselves a tank, and no other class would be <br/>\nstupid enough to led an attack on the dragon and expect to live.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of Rallos Zek;<br/>\n<br/>\nPatty of Halas<br/>\nusername: Patricia<br/>\nserver: Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\nOOC: I played most classes/races during beta and finally selected a <br/>\nbarbarian warrior.  Role-playing is the best part of this game.  While <br/>\non-line and waiting for something to happen I usually never stay in one <br/>\nplace and I am always talking, waiting for something to happen.  Drives my <br/>\ngroup crazy, but they view me as a blood crazy Amazon and expect me to <br/>\nthirst for death and battle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
