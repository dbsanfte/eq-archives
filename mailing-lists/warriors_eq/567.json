The economy in EQ is<br/>\nbeing blown by people who &quot;farm&quot; equipment to sell for cheap prices just to<br/>\nfarther themselves a tiny amount.  IMO this sucks.  I remember when you<br/>\ncould sell a mino axe for 10pp.  Now I see them sold for 4pp and laf at how<br/>\nrediculous this is.  I also realize this is due to the ease of gaining a<br/>\nmino axe now.  But for things like a BBC, SBH, or Tomahawk, why drive the<br/>\nprice down and ruin the worth of the item.  Half the fun in the game is<br/>\ngoing and getting something for yourself.  Buying items is definitely a part<br/>\nof the game, and should remain an available option.  But when you get people<br/>\ncamping items just to sell them for profit, it becomes very anoying.  I have<br/>\ntried to get a BBC for about a month before I gave up because of campers and<br/>\nkill stealers.  Hard to express the anger you feel when you sit killing and<br/>\nwaiting for 3 plus hours only to have another group move in and steal the<br/>\nkill to gain what you have been patiently waiting for.<br/>\n<br/>\nIm off the track here.  The point is, why drive the cost of something down?<br/>\nYou should want to keep the items worth something until the majority of<br/>\npeople in the game can get them for themselves.  Otherwise you will see lvl<br/>\n3 and 4 characters running around with weapons that are level 15 or 20.  And<br/>\nthey only paid 4plat for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my opinion I guess...<br/>\n<br/>\nDyvim Kincaid<br/>\nStormriders of Cazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Nick Morgowicz [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nomorgow@...\">nomorgow@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 24, 1999 2:12 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Polished Granite Tomahawk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Nick Morgowicz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nomorgow@...\">nomorgow@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 24 May 1999, Clancy Cashion wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Clancy Cashion&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcashio3@...\">tcashio3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When someone has to camp an item for days to get it, why would<br/>\n&gt; they sell it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for a 20p?

I&#39;m sure someone knows of a<br/>\n&gt; system out there to get the tomahawk, like how i said i got the chitin<br/>\n&gt; shield, and also the BBC. It would only take a very short time to get the<br/>\n&gt; item if we knew the system, *hopefully* forcing the price of these items<br/>\n&gt; down.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nick<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
