FAQ: Q.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-338801432\">Hail to tee!<br/>\nI am a human warrior of the 20th level.  Read this and you&#39;ll know everthing <br/>\nthat is going on.  I&#39;ve don some mathimatical calculations.<br/>\n<br/>\nFAQ:<br/>\nQ. Whats going on?<br/>\nA. They upgraded the warrior. We get a Critical Hit attack, SV Magic boost <br/>\n(and probably others),an HP &quot;buff&quot; and I&#39;ve found that I am hitting alot <br/>\nharder, quicker and more damage then before.<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;ve done some calculating with some math operation I&#39;ve learned in <br/>\ncalculess last year.<br/>\nIf you Duel weild on faster weapons, IE. anything dealy:30 and down you&#39;ll <br/>\nscore more critical hits.  I&#39;ve found that on average from every 2-5 battle <br/>\nI can dish about 2 critical hits.  When I ahd my 1st critical hit, it was <br/>\nfor 18 points of damage and it&#39;s rising, currently I see that I am hitting <br/>\nfor 32 points.  I have noticed that it&#39;s not going up any more.  So my <br/>\nhypothisis is that every level your CH goes up 2 poitns everytime it does it <br/>\nand MAX&#39;s out of 10 points per level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI current duel weild a PGT (right) and a combine Long Sword (left). I have <br/>\nnoticed with an ratio of 6/26 - 6/28 my average hits per 5 seconds is a <br/>\nratio of dmg to dealy- 46/47 (including double attacks/duel weilds) that <br/>\nstat can be calculated to 1 weapon witch would be a 2.304 on the weapon <br/>\ndmg:dealy ricter scale.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone noticed the speed, we&#39;re hitting alot harder and alot faster then <br/>\nbefore.  before I think my hp was 600 at lvl 20 and I&#39;ve noticed that it&#39;s <br/>\n603 with no buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone could get to the guild soon and see what they cahnged that wiuld <br/>\nbe great, couse currently I am zoned in Unrest.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour best bet would switch to 1h slashing couse if you look at the table <br/>\nbelow.. you&#39;ll seee what I mean on your chances to CH.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDelay:           CH %<br/>\n_______________________<br/>\n50               3.45%<br/>\n45               6.63%<br/>\n40               8.39%<br/>\n35               9.92%<br/>\n30               12.00%<br/>\n25               15.65%<br/>\n20               23.003%<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see (done by: delay/60[move the . of 2 the the left]) would give <br/>\nyour %.  Lower the delay and more hits per weapon, moer CH your going to get <br/>\nin. so for an average of 1-4CH per battle you you weild 2 weapon of a deal <br/>\nof 30 and down and a skill over 90 at the lvl of 20.<br/>\n<br/>\n=P thnc for reading, hope you understand!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nDealan Strongbear &lt;Combine&gt; - Rainkeeper - Karana Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
