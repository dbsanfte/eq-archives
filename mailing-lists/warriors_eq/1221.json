The magic you get more than makes up for<br/>\nany deficiency.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did the same as you and now find myself playing the ranger more and more,<br/>\nit is easier to level because I only have to stop and rest after 3 or 4<br/>\nfights with blues.  I fight, expend mana on heals, and fight over and over<br/>\ntill mana is gone, then I cast invisble on myself and rest till mana is<br/>\nrestored and repeat.  I made level 16 in about 2/3rds the playing time it<br/>\ntook to do the same with my warrior.  and I am comparing in game time<br/>\n(/played) not real life time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have hit the wall I did with my warrior, except this time it is level<br/>\n16 and not 14.  Oasis isn&#39;t the hunting ground it used to be on Bertox, and<br/>\nI never cared for boring croc hunting anyway.  I am right now touring<br/>\nAntonica looking for a new temporary home.  Looks like Highpass will be it<br/>\nfor awhile. Excellent loot and experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nProblem is the orc end is so camped with people looking for halberds it is<br/>\nhard to get any of the orcs. Wizard item farmers tend to steal kills from<br/>\nall but large groups.  Gnolls are good fun though...love smacking those<br/>\ndoggies around with my shiny brass halberd<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Patricia Halas &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, June 14, 1999 7:47 AM<br/>\nSubject: [warriors_eq] Petition<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Patricia Halas &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So far I have to agree with everything on the board.
