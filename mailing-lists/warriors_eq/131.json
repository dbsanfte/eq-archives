Hopefully soon I will have enougth plat to afford my <br/>\ndream weapon of a combine long sword (I have 10 plat now).<br/>\n   Any good suggestions for hunting in and around Freeport?  Didn&#39;t like <br/>\nbefallen to much since I don&#39;t have a magic weapon yet.  Kind of a bummer <br/>\nwhen you have to run from a skel that cons blue since I can&#39;t hit him.<br/>\n   Haven&#39;t been down to see Troll Town yet.  Wonder if it is worth the trip?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of Rellos Zek;<br/>\n<br/>\nPatty of Halas<br/>\nusername: Patricia<br/>\nserver: Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
