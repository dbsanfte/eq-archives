Here it is again in<br/>\nplain text!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the difference between melee combatants and casters magic should be<br/>\nthus:  Melee fighters should be able to do just as much damage, if not more,<br/>\nwhereas a caster may strike from a distance, and strike multiple targets<br/>\nwith area effect spells.<br/>\n <br/>\nI am the president of a national group that fights with live steel weapons.<br/>\nI&#39;ve been fighting with long swords, 2-handed swords, axes and maces for 10<br/>\nyears, and I am very comfortable with just how devastating these weapons can<br/>\nbe.  No matter if you are struck by lightning or are cut in 2 by a large<br/>\naxe, you are just as dead!<br/>\n <br/>\nSo perhaps the direction we need to seek, and the difference between these 2<br/>\ntypes of characters. melee and caster, is not how much damage they do, but<br/>\nhow.  A caster should be able to reach far away, and strike multiple<br/>\ntargets, while the great warrior should only be able to strike at one target<br/>\nat a time, but be able to mow them down like wheat.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, and if anyone is interested in an organization that allow you to wear<br/>\narmor and swing a real blade ( and trust me, it will give you a whole new<br/>\nperspective on your RPGing!) check out our website!<br/>\n <br/>\nwww.adrianempire.org&#92;<br/>\n<br/>\n=======================================================<br/>\nThis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.
