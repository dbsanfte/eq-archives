Once again, I will<br/>\n&gt;draw from my experience in wielding broad swords in real life.  After about<br/>\n&gt;3 to 5 minutes of constant fighting, in 100 lbs. of armor guess what, you<br/>\n&gt;are wiped out and need to rest a bit.  Just like the mage has to rest while<br/>\n&gt;dealing out those spells, we warriors should need to rest after fighting in<br/>\n&gt;all that armor and swinging that 3 to 5 lbs. sword around, 9 lbs. in the<br/>\n&gt;case of great swords.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Once again, your real life experiences have no bearing on EQ, a fantasy<br/>\nrole-playing game.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you need a rest every 3-5 minutes because your stamina is much lower<br/>\nthan that of a troll or barbarian.  Maybe if you spent your whole life<br/>\ntraining to be a warrior, you would have greater stamina.  EQ Warriors can<br/>\nfight longer than your 3-5 minutes because they exercise instead of playing<br/>\nvideo games.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
