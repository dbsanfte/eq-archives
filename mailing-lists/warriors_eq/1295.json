Apparently there is some kind of glitch in timming with<br/>\nDoT spells.  (You said the necro was using clinging darkness and such)  What<br/>\nhappened was the DB was killed by poison (or something like that) instead of<br/>\nby you or the necro or his pet.  This has happened to my group many times so<br/>\nwe pettitioned it.  Like I said, they gave me about the same answer I am<br/>\npassing on to you.  Nothing you can do about it except only cast the DoTs in<br/>\nthe beginning of the fight, then DD after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nDyvim Kincaid<br/>\nStormriders of Cazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Zwanenburg, John [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 16, 1999 11:30 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Warriors vs Hybrids<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Zwanenburg, John&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hey Gang,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just a couple of things to ask right now. Last night i was in lake rathe<br/>\n&gt; with my cleric hoping to score some bronze plate from some drybones. I was<br/>\n&gt; in a duo with a level 17 Necromancer and it was going really sweet. During<br/>\n&gt; the day time we would head over to the Aviak treehouse near Jonah Brucker<br/>\n&gt; and slaughter birds and when night would approach wed go back to<br/>\n&gt; the Karana<br/>\n&gt; Zone area and take out skels. OK so we started off in day time having a<br/>\n&gt; blast killing aviaks every 1 minute cause they spawn so damn fast<br/>\n&gt; there and<br/>\n&gt; were earning exp like no tomorrow. THen night comes along and we head over<br/>\n&gt; to the undead area. We start off killing a few skeletons gaining some exp<br/>\n&gt; but not too much and wait around for the first drybones to come.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After about 5 minutes Voila there he is. I call him over with<br/>\n&gt; expulse undead<br/>\n&gt; for 91 damage and then the necro sends in his pet to tank and i back off<br/>\n&gt; hitting it 5 more times all for 91 damage while the necro is using his DoT<br/>\n&gt; spells like heat blood heart flutter and clingin darkness. The<br/>\n&gt; thing was at<br/>\n&gt; about 1/4 of health left when another skel spawns and starts attacking it<br/>\n&gt; too. Now this didnt bother me at all at first. I gave it one more Expulse<br/>\n&gt; undead giving the killing blow and what do i see? NO EXP and the corpse<br/>\n&gt; dissapears. I rub my eyes and check again,...nope nothing. So i<br/>\n&gt; scroll back<br/>\n&gt; up seeing if that other skeleton had perhaps got the killing blow which<br/>\n&gt; would make sense. But no, i haad indeed got the blow in. Infact the Normal<br/>\n&gt; skele had only hit the drybones once and it was for 16 damage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So why the heck did we not get to loot the corpse and get no exp?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok next up. After killing a couple more drybones and actually getting some<br/>\n&gt; bronze day time came again and we headed back to our aviak<br/>\n&gt; killing grounds,.<br/>\n&gt; When we arrived we saw two Rangers there and decided to let them<br/>\n&gt; have it. No<br/>\n&gt; biggie we said we can go kill Jonah Brucker for kicks. (and water<br/>\n&gt; --- those<br/>\n&gt; who know who Jonah is will know what im talking about ) so we get<br/>\n&gt; there and<br/>\n&gt; sure enough Good ol Jonah is there waiting. He cons blue to me (level 17<br/>\n&gt; cleric) and he is a monk. I know this because he uses strike. On<br/>\n&gt; average he<br/>\n&gt; hits for about 20 damage max on me. My necro friend was afk for one second<br/>\n&gt; while i was engaging Jonah, who i can normally kill with no problems. I<br/>\n&gt; call him out and he runs up to me with a dagger in hand. Odd i think to<br/>\n&gt; myself, must be a rare weapon or something. All of a sudden i see<br/>\n&gt; my heatlth<br/>\n&gt; begin to plummet as Jonah is peircing me for 36 and always, ALWAYS getting<br/>\n&gt; double attack in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I couldnt belive it, i could not even heal myself. When i died he latched<br/>\n&gt; onto my necro friend who then suffered the same fate. Well we<br/>\n&gt; were bound on<br/>\n&gt; the same spot that we died on so we memed our spells and then killed him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why was a monk that conned blue to me kicking my ass with a rusty dagger?<br/>\n&gt; Thats what his dagger was by the way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok next up. We decide Jonah sucks and decide to explore a little<br/>\n&gt; bit before<br/>\n&gt; heading back over to the undead spawn spot. We pass near the barbarian<br/>\n&gt; village and my friend gets to close. Three of them latch on to him and he<br/>\n&gt; has to engage them. I come along to help and see that they all con blue to<br/>\n&gt; me so we start fighting away and eventually win. No biggie, no factions go<br/>\n&gt; up or down or anything. We rest and med up and explore some more. We come<br/>\n&gt; across another inlet that has two human guards wearing plate with no<br/>\n&gt; weapons. They con indifferent and blue to me but i keep my<br/>\n&gt; distance just to<br/>\n&gt; be safe. All of a sudden one of the two guards comes runnning up to me and<br/>\n&gt; startsto fight me, first attack i dodged so i say oh well no<br/>\n&gt; where to run to<br/>\n&gt; so may as well kill the guard. Then it hits me.....The guard punches me<br/>\n&gt; PUNCHES me twice (double attack) for 98 damage! HOLY #&$%! Run i<br/>\n&gt; yell to my<br/>\n&gt; buddy and he casts invis on himself as i watch myself die.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Someone explain this to me. Why is a guard that cons blue to a level 17<br/>\n&gt; cleric hitting me for more than a sand giant would? Just curious.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh well i shouldnt complain, i died twice last night in lake<br/>\n&gt; rathe but in 3<br/>\n&gt; hours there i made 4 bubbles of exp (after dying even! ) I suggest you all<br/>\n&gt; go there at around level 17 it rocks. Aside from the crap that goes on<br/>\n&gt; there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyways let me know if anyone can explain this stuff to me<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; RayneT&#39;Kazz<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Got an opinion?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Make it count!
