The GZ answer explains<br/>\nhow the total amount of EXP is awarded for a kill.<br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent levels still get different percentages of experience based upon<br/>\ntheir level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to modify Bruener&#39;s example in light of GZ&#39;s answer and combine it<br/>\nwith your scenario:<br/>\n<br/>\nMob exp: 1000<br/>\ntotal lvls in group 59 (34 + 25)<br/>\nGroup EXP bonus 100 (10% I&#39;m making this amount up since I don&#39;t really know<br/>\nwhat it is)<br/>\nEXP/level = 1100/59 = 18.64<br/>\n<br/>\nThoren (34 warrior) gets 634 exp (18.64 * 34)<br/>\nMikal (25 Bard) gets 466 exp (18.64 * 25)<br/>\n<br/>\nKindrael<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.  I&#39;ve seen an experiment that someone ran to see if the human race got<br/>\nany exp breaks/bonuses.  They did not.  A human warrior had to kill 14<br/>\nfirebeetles to level from 2 to 3.  A dwarf warrior had to kill 14<br/>\nfirebeetles as well.  A Human hybrid had to kill 22 Firebeetles as did dwarf<br/>\nhybrids.  There is no exp bonus for being human.  There is one for being a<br/>\nwarrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
