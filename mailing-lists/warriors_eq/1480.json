This may seem insignificant, however,<br/>\n&gt; EQ uses these sorts of tiny differentials as the<br/>\n&gt; basis for damage calculations.  Given the way AC<br/>\n&gt; advances (3-5 point increase purely on level alone)<br/>\n&gt; there are easy ways for EQ to &#39;normalize&#39; the AC vs.<br/>\n&gt; Offense to determine relative damage levels for<br/>\n&gt; enemies of similar level.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok, if AC is all that matters, why do a pair of<br/>\ncharacters at equal level and Defensive skills have<br/>\nsuch vast differences?  One a Ranger in full banded,<br/>\nthe other a Warrior/Paladin/ShadowKnight in full<br/>\nplate; the Rangers consistently take more damage from<br/>\nfights than their heavily armored fellow tanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill don&#39;t like that test?  Try this one: take *your*<br/>\nWAR/PAL/SDK and get a full suit of plate to match the<br/>\nfull suit of banded you&#39;re so proud of.  Go fight a<br/>\nfew blue mobs in your banded armor and note the<br/>\nstrength of the blows that connect against you; how<br/>\nmuch single shots tend to do, how many low damage<br/>\nshots you receive, and how much total damage you take<br/>\nover the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow put on the plate and try another few fights<br/>\nagainst similar mobs (level and race).  You should<br/>\nnotice fewer shots dealing maximum damage against you,<br/>\nmore shots doing low damage (2-10 where before it<br/>\nwould have been 40-60 on each connect), and less total<br/>\ndamage at the end of the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou think you&#39;ve found some secret uber-combo (ala<br/>\nTekken or something, up-up-down-left-right left and<br/>\nright punch together to produce the MegaFireball) or<br/>\nsomething; this game has shown no instances of such<br/>\nimbalances.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you truly think they managed to get all the way<br/>\nthrough four phases of beta and the past 4-6 months of<br/>\nfinal and never notice that plate, as you are<br/>\nalledging, is useless?<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking you&#39;ve found some hidden truth; that banded<br/>\nis marginally (5% or less) effective than Plate but<br/>\nhas a fraction of the weight ... folly.  Sheer folly.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlate matters in a fight.  I&#39;ll take plate armored<br/>\ntanks over those in banded seven days a week and the<br/>\nrest of the month too.  I have watched the performance<br/>\nof Rangers (since they *can&#39;t* have better than<br/>\nbanded) higher than my level for months now; they&#39;re<br/>\nstuck in banded while I&#39;m in plate, and I take less<br/>\ndamage when tanking.  I&#39;ve watched warriors who aren&#39;t<br/>\nplate armored yet, and I take less damage than they<br/>\nwhen tanking.  And I only have an 80 AGI, so it&#39;s not<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut hey, whatever you want to do.  If you&#39;re in my<br/>\ngroup though, I won&#39;t appreciate the higher percentage<br/>\nof the healers&#39; mana you&#39;ll be taking to recover from<br/>\nthe greater damage you&#39;ll be taking.
