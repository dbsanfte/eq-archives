By what you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1946068498\">Mages have a limit at what they can do though.  Sure they can hit with a<br/>\nspell for 1200 damage, but they have mana that will eventually run out.  By<br/>\nwhat you are suggesting,  a warrior could keep swinging and swinging for<br/>\n1200 damage per attack without losing that ability after prolonged use (did<br/>\nthat make sense)?  The critical strike is probably a good solution, as well<br/>\nas the specialization skill - but in no way should a warrior be able to do<br/>\nas much damage as a caster.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tObergfell, Steven[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SObergfell@...\">SObergfell@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tThursday, June 10, 1999 4:37 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Petition or Melee vs. Caster damage<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Obergfell, Steven&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SObergfell@...\">SObergfell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry, that last email was just too hard to read!!!  Here it is again in<br/>\n&gt; plain text!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the difference between melee combatants and casters magic should<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; thus:  Melee fighters should be able to do just as much damage, if not<br/>\n&gt; more,<br/>\n&gt; whereas a caster may strike from a distance, and strike multiple targets<br/>\n&gt; with area effect spells.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I am the president of a national group that fights with live steel<br/>\n&gt; weapons.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been fighting with long swords, 2-handed swords, axes and maces for<br/>\n&gt; 10<br/>\n&gt; years, and I am very comfortable with just how devastating these weapons<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; be.  No matter if you are struck by lightning or are cut in 2 by a large<br/>\n&gt; axe, you are just as dead!<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; So perhaps the direction we need to seek, and the difference between these<br/>\n&gt; 2<br/>\n&gt; types of characters. melee and caster, is not how much damage they do, but<br/>\n&gt; how.  A caster should be able to reach far away, and strike multiple<br/>\n&gt; targets, while the great warrior should only be able to strike at one<br/>\n&gt; target<br/>\n&gt; at a time, but be able to mow them down like wheat.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Oh, and if anyone is interested in an organization that allow you to wear<br/>\n&gt; armor and swing a real blade ( and trust me, it will give you a whole new<br/>\n&gt; perspective on your RPGing!) check out our website!<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; www.adrianempire.org&#92;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; =======================================================<br/>\n&gt; This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and<br/>\n&gt; may contain confidential and privileged information.
