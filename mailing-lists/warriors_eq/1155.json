I have been playing with that character more than my warrior because I<br/>\nwanted to compare capabilities at the same level.  My ranger uses a 2 handed<br/>\ndwarven axe (great weapon by the way, 14 damage 43 delay), and sometimes a 1<br/>\nhanded dwarven axe.  He is at level 15.  I can solo any blue, many yellows<br/>\nand i have even soloed a few red orc slavers.  In comparison my warrior,<br/>\nlevel 16 is beaten to the point of 10 minute resting after a fight by most<br/>\nblues. He runs from anything that is yellow or red.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a group the ranger meets all the same party needs as a warrior plus he<br/>\n </span></blockquote>provides his own healing and buffing.  My 16th level warrior is about to get<br/>\na fine steel 2 handed sword and work up his 2hs skill to a comparable level<br/>\nas the ranger.  We will see how that goes.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The warrior formerly known as Bael<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now one of those weenie wood elf rangers, Aelyn. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
