This impacted ALL classes &amp; not just warriors. To\nbe honest in 5 hours of Howling Stones last night Ididn&#39;t notice the difference\n(i.e. with my Bloodpoint &amp; werewolf form I still saw plenty of agro).<br>\n3) Warriors were only &quot;useless&quot; the first 6 months of the games existence...I\nknow I experienced it first hand (same armor, weapons &amp; hps as everyone\nelse with zero distinguishing skills) .&nbsp; These days with decent warr specific\narmor &amp; weapons we tank very well at most levels.<br>\n4) The idea that warriors don&#39;t contribute significant offensive damage is\nan old idea.&nbsp; With the uber hps high level MOBs the damage we contribute\nover time is quite significant.<br>\n5) Raising the defensive caps for the other classes actually makes them stronger\nin the groups I play in.&nbsp; That means my groups survive more. I kind of like\nthat.<br>\n6) The mid 30s-40s is a tough spot for warriors.&nbsp; Mostly because the other\ntank classes (Rangers/SKs in particular) have similar agro capability to\nourselves at this point but little experience in the value of their role\nin a group.&nbsp; By the mid 40s very few Rangers, SKs &amp; Pallies are actively\ntrying wrest agro away from a warrior...at least if they have any brains.<br>\n<br>\nregards<br>\n<br>\nFlair Shieldrender<br>\n54 Champion Fennin Ro<br>\n<br>\nJames Wofford wrote:<br>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote type=\"cite\"><pre>sigh..
