Do you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-694663588\">Wow, this email list still lives!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got a question for you.  Do you use a site to see what items are<br/>\navailable?  Which one?  How could it be better?  Do you care about news on<br/>\nan items site, or just the items?  Would it need quests listed for quest for<br/>\nitems, entirely, or just starting point?  List of Mob it comes from?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy reason for asking:  I&#39;m thinking about making one, and if I do, I want it<br/>\nto be THE items site to go to.  I&#39;ve actually already got the database<br/>\ndesigned, I just need to work on inputting info and designing the site<br/>\nlayout.  I could have a preview(not all items) up in 2 days or less if I get<br/>\nenough response.<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, October 17, 1999 5:24 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] One hand or two?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Matt-<br/>\n  I have a 30th level barbarian warrior on Veeshan. I can only tell you what<br/>\nI&#39;ve chosen<br/>\n  Max out 1hs, 2hs, taunt, kick, slam/bash  and I am working on archery<br/>\n(this has helped me take down runners).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Some have said take up piercing. When you get duel attack and duel weild<br/>\nonly for the fact that a piercing weapon is faster and will help max these<br/>\nskills out.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I find that 1hs with duel weild is more effective in certain circumstances<br/>\nand then 2hs in another. 1hs gives you speed of attack. 2hs is good for<br/>\ngreatest impact (recently got a crit hit of 100.. now that was sweet). If<br/>\nyou use a 2hs or 1hs will also depend on your group make up. I do carry all<br/>\nmy weapons with me so at times will switch depending on the circumstance.<br/>\n<br/>\n  All my reading and such have said to keep both maxed out. Some reasons are<br/>\nthe performance of the weapon others for the variety of weapons you can use.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t work on my 2hs until I was at the 28th level and it was very<br/>\npainful to max it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Az<br/>\n<br/>\n  Matthew Horne wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n      G&#39;day my name is Kalroth.. a level 7 dwarf warrior on the solusek ro<br/>\nserverMy question is whether one hand or two hand slash is better for a<br/>\nwarrior Hope you can help me , thanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
