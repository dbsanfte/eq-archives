I am level 5 now and am hanging around with a high elf wizard and a wood elf ranger (Both level 8).  We can do some serious damage, but it is tough to know what I should be working on since no one else seems to match my race/class.  ANY info you can give would be good.  Also, what armor can I use?  I haven&#39;t found any near Kelethin of Felwithe that is compatible with me.  Oh well, not much near those cities can really put the hurt on me anyway, unless I got grouped up on by some Orc Centurions, even they don&#39;t usually stand a chance when I fight the one&#39;s that con white to me (or yellow sometimes) and I get the alone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nXangor</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
