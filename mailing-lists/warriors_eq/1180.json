Short of the fact that warriors <br/>\n&gt; are needed in<br/>\n&gt; high level groups.  Let me backtrack a little bit.  Warriors <br/>\n&gt; at the lower<br/>\n&gt; levels are far superior to hybrid classes in general.  But at <br/>\n&gt; the higer<br/>\n&gt; levels, the hybrids have gained so many abilities and extras that the<br/>\n&gt; warrior is overshadowed by the attributes of a hybrid.  Also, <br/>\n&gt; a hybrid can<br/>\n&gt; fulfill the same role that a warrior can at those higher <br/>\n&gt; levels just as well<br/>\n&gt; as a warrior can.  A warrior also has very little ability at <br/>\n&gt; higher levels<br/>\n&gt; to use his taunt, bue to lack of damage inflicted to a mob.  <br/>\n&gt; I find this<br/>\n&gt; happeneing to me at level 30 already.  How bad will this be <br/>\n&gt; at level 40?<br/>\n&gt; The lack of a warrior being able to get a mob off the casters <br/>\n&gt; will make his<br/>\n&gt; worth in the battle less.  Therefore groups will be more <br/>\n&gt; inclined to chose a<br/>\n&gt; hybrid class as their tank.  This will cause a loss of people actually<br/>\n&gt; playing warriors in the game, leading to the downfall of the <br/>\n&gt; class as a<br/>\n&gt; whole.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for wizards/warrior argument.  Warriors are not supposed <br/>\n&gt; to do the damage<br/>\n&gt; a wizard can do.  we are there as the shield so they can lay <br/>\n&gt; down the damage<br/>\n&gt; at will....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you get into a good group that is working well together.  <br/>\n&gt; Where everyone<br/>\n&gt; in the group knows there place in the group organization.  <br/>\n&gt; Wizards become<br/>\n&gt; the secondary source of damage, not the primary.  If they <br/>\n&gt; nuke to soon, they<br/>\n&gt; are mobbed, they have to hold their spells in check until the <br/>\n&gt; right time to<br/>\n&gt; burn down the mob.  Yes, they do put some small burns into <br/>\n&gt; the middle of the<br/>\n&gt; battle, but they shouldnt let loose the great damage spells <br/>\n&gt; until late in<br/>\n&gt; the battle.  This is the true place where warriors shine.  <br/>\n&gt; But even at that,<br/>\n&gt; by the time the battle nears where its time for the wizards power, the<br/>\n&gt; warrior has done little except take alot of damage.  IMO we <br/>\n&gt; should be able<br/>\n&gt; to help with some of the beginning portion of battles more <br/>\n&gt; than what we do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am thinking that the majority of us agree on the critical <br/>\n&gt; hit issue.  How<br/>\n&gt; do we feel about the specialization skills?  Also, remember <br/>\n&gt; that we cap all<br/>\n&gt; of our skills (that didnt cap earlier) at 200.  Some of the <br/>\n&gt; hybrid classes<br/>\n&gt; continue to be able to gain in skills past that.  I feel we <br/>\n&gt; should be able<br/>\n&gt; to remove that cap on our skill and continue to progress in <br/>\n&gt; them.  We are<br/>\n&gt; warriors, we never stop learning our art.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dyvim Kincaid<br/>\n&gt; Stormriders of Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Zwanenburg, John [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, June 11, 1999 8:53 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Warriors vs Wizards<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Zwanenburg, John&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I whole heartedly agree with you wayne.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The game is about balance. Some people are saying that a <br/>\n&gt; group of really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; high levels do not need warriors. I say thats BS my friends <br/>\n&gt; always want my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warrior in their group. Not just becuase im company mind <br/>\n&gt; you. Because they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are spell casters. If im not there, the MOB would latch <br/>\n&gt; onto them and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interrupt their casting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sure we could beg verant for one more skill .... critical <br/>\n&gt; hit , which is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very good idea. And i like the idea of it being like <br/>\n&gt; ripsote and parry.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Makes more sense. But the fact of the matter is this: We <br/>\n&gt; are there to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; prevent our spellcasting buddies from being hit by <br/>\n&gt; creatures so that THEY<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can dish out the damage. I have never had anyone complain to me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and say look<br/>\n&gt; &gt; man we dont want you in the group anymore cause you doont dish<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out the most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Every group needs a good strong warrior.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; John<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: \tWayne Sheppard[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: \tFriday, June 11, 1999 10:26 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Warriors vs Wizards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many of the Warriors here have complained that they <br/>\n&gt; cannot do damage as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fast<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as a Wizard.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now all of you real life ninjas and steel sword swinging <br/>\n&gt; fools just calm<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; down.
