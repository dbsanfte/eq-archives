I can only tell you<br/>\nwhat I&#39;ve chosen<br/>\nMax out 1hs, 2hs, taunt, kick, slam/bash  and I am working on archery<br/>\n(this has helped me take down runners).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome have said take up piercing. When you get duel attack and duel weild<br/>\nonly for the fact that a piercing weapon is faster and will help max<br/>\nthese skills out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that 1hs with duel weild is more effective in certain<br/>\ncircumstances and then 2hs in another. 1hs gives you speed of attack.<br/>\n2hs is good for greatest impact (recently got a crit hit of 100.. now<br/>\nthat was sweet). If you use a 2hs or 1hs will also depend on your group<br/>\nmake up. I do carry all my weapons with me so at times will switch<br/>\ndepending on the circumstance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll my reading and such have said to keep both maxed out. Some reasons<br/>\nare the performance of the weapon others for the variety of weapons you<br/>\ncan use. I didn&#39;t work on my 2hs until I was at the 28th level and it<br/>\nwas very painful to max it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nAz<br/>\n<br/>\nMatthew Horne wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;   G&#39;day my name is Kalroth.. a level 7 dwarf warrior on the solusek ro<br/>\n&gt; serverMy question is whether one hand or two hand slash is better for<br/>\n&gt; a warrior Hope you can help me , thanks </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
