I&#39;m still getting used to it&#39;s lingo and such-forth but I&#39;m <br/>\nhaving a few questions/help/input thats on my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Now, I need a magical sword, so that I can kill Wisp&#39;s... I&#39;m thinking <br/>\nabout investing into a &#39;Combined 2H Sword&#39;.  I&#39;ve herd they can very from <br/>\n75pp - 120pp.  I&#39;m wondering where I can get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S Where is the best place to hunt wisp&#39;s. (I&#39;ve herd they offer good money <br/>\ndrops)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  For a lvl 10, I have RingMail tunic, RingMail pants & RingMail sleeve&#39;s. <br/>\n  I&#39;ve switched to RingMail couse I&#39;ve found there a little bit less then <br/>\nBanded Mail and you get the same AC but a little more weight.  I&#39;ve also <br/>\nnoticed that with RingMail that monsters tend to miss a bit more and I dodge <br/>\nmore quicker then Banded Mail.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  When I reach lvl 12, What does perry skill do?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  I was wondering, I have a Kite Shield and one Mino Battle Axe.  When I <br/>\nget dule wielding, I&#39;ll buy another Mino Battle Axe... Is there some way I <br/>\ncan contact a lvl35+ Enchanter and he/she could make my Mino Battle Axe <br/>\nmagical somehow OR even make the delay better?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  Ok, I&#39;m having trouble with some quest&#39;s... What are good ones that <br/>\noffer good money, Experience Points & and a all around good item?<br/>\n<br/>\n                          Thanks for reading my newbie questions!<br/>\n                                        Dean Boyle<br/>\n<br/>\nServer: Karana<br/>\nName: Dealan &lt;The Light of Norrath&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
