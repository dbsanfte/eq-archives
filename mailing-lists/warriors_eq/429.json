I have maxed both dual wield and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; double attack at 80 each.  I seem to be having trouble effectively<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hunting.  Anything that cons white to me is always a tough fight that can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; go either way, so I usually end up sticking to blue critters.  However<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some blue critters are just to tough to solo.  Lava basilisks are a no-no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because of Stone Breath, fire elementals have some kind of damage shield<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which causes me damage each time I hit so they are a no-no also.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lavastorm being my preferred hunting area right now.  I tried crocs in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Oasis, but it is to crowded when I play (8pm-10pm) for me to even find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything to kill.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I guess I am at that awkward level and was looking for advice from other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warriors on how they got fro 15 to 16.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bael<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Warrior of the 15th Order<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Indigo Brotherhood of the Tier&#39;dal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  bringing the world together.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
