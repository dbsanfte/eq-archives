<br/>\n&gt; Lets look into the life och chris(my real name) and see what his alst 24h <br/>\n&gt; was like.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yesterday same time as now roughly 16:30<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; leave work 30 min early, go home, check icq, send msg to friends<br/>\n&gt; &quot;loging on Vashi on solusek ro&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; play for 3h<br/>\n&gt; get killed by a griff for the first time, karanas was no fun today.<br/>\n&gt; and humans look funny in banded armor<br/>\n&gt; call for pizza, sit in safe spot, run down to pizza place(2min).<br/>\n&gt; Eat pizza while wackin scarabs in N Ro.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gf calls, talk 5 min, distracted by party members wanting to go,<br/>\n&gt; partymember laughs at a humans butt in chainmail<br/>\n&gt; gf hangs up askin me to call when the computer is turned off.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Spends 10 min healing after dorn got pulled by someone.<br/>\n&gt; Tries to light a smoke buy realize that I should have bought more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; check the time, damn 1:00 time to go to bed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wake up 30 min late, dreamin of clashing weapons and ugly humans in <br/>\n&gt; chainmail.<br/>\n&gt; run down to work, buy a sandwich on the way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; spend 90% of work time reading this newsgroup and every post on eqvault<br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; stratics, checks maps for now hunting areas.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; write 50 lines of code that wont work<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; AAAHHHRRRRGGGGG I thought i was safe from the computer gaming addiction<br/>\n&gt; when <br/>\n&gt; I gave up muds 6 months ago and now Im back in it again. Just as bad as it<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; was then, if not worse.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Id better log on to EQ again, atleast I can be productive there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Vashi, man Im pathetic<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; oh and sorry for my spelling.
