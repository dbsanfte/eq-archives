As a player who runs both a warrior (level 8)<br/>\n&gt; and a cleric (level 12) I see advantages in both classes. First and<br/>\n&gt; foremost, there are a LOT of critters that resist root. And if your<br/>\n&gt; group is targeting creatures above the spell cap (ie, 6 levels or more<br/>\n&gt; above you) they will automatically resist root or ensnare or whatever<br/>\n&gt; spell you are using. And when root fails, you are praying for a tank to<br/>\n&gt; take some of the abuse else you are toast.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For those sports fans, a football analogy I think works best. Warriors,<br/>\n&gt; Paladins, and Monks (and perhaps some of the other hybrid melee classes<br/>\n&gt; but I prefer to use the 3 mentioned) are like offensive lineman. They<br/>\n&gt; are engaging the creature to let the other offensive players do their<br/>\n&gt; work. A caster can&#39;t cast if he&#39;s being pounded on, plain and simple.<br/>\n&gt; *Sometimes* channel MIGHT let you get a spell of but more often than<br/>\n&gt; not they need to be disengaged. So the tank is critical to<br/>\n&gt; accomplishing this. The benefits are two-fold. First the tank is doing<br/>\n&gt; some decent damage on his own, keeping the critters attention and the<br/>\n&gt; casters are unleashing their power trying to get the guy down in the<br/>\n&gt; most efficient manner possible.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The point being, all of these classes have value in a group. Group<br/>\n&gt; being the operative word. Warriors are designed to be able to handle a<br/>\n&gt; great deal of abuse in a melee. I seriously doubt any high level<br/>\n&gt; players will tell you that tanks are of no value. Without them, the<br/>\n&gt; rest of the members of the group have a much harder time doing their<br/>\n&gt; job.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And the point about the cleric being able to take on whites vs blue I<br/>\n&gt; find to be absolutely false. Clerics don&#39;t have the offensive power or<br/>\n&gt; mana to play the root n shoot game. *Maybe* against some undead but<br/>\n&gt; again root is an unstable spell. Maybe my opinion on that will change<br/>\n&gt; once I advance in levels but that&#39;s how I see it for now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dasan, level 7 barbarian Warrior<br/>\n&gt; Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- mark mark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:markerob@...\">markerob@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: mark mark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:markerob@...\">markerob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I believe that warriors are necessary in a group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only to the high teen-low <br/>\n&gt; &gt; twenties.  When most hybrid-magic user classes get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to that level they can <br/>\n&gt; &gt; either root, or get a pet that will engage the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; creature while he or she <br/>\n&gt; &gt; casts (wherein they usually don&#39;t need long because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they deal out the most <br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage).  I am a lev 17 warrior and blue cons can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; take me down to 1/3 hp, it <br/>\n&gt; &gt; then takes me a half hour to heal back up.  While I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have a cleric who is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; taking on white cons with little problem.  I have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; agree that warriors are <br/>\n&gt; &gt; necessary, but only to the level before casters come<br/>\n&gt; &gt; into their own. And fyi <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have a fellow mate who is a level 18 wiz with all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; his points put into int <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and he has only 100 less hp than I have. Another<br/>\n&gt; &gt; overlooked characteristic <br/>\n&gt; &gt; is that casters can hit magic only creatures from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the begining, while <br/>\n&gt; &gt; warriors have to run around for weeks trying to save<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up the money for a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; special weapon (wich are way overpriced), and most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the time we end up <br/>\n&gt; &gt; running from green con&#39;s because we can&#39;t hit them. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I only use my warrior <br/>\n&gt; &gt; now to get money and equipment for other characters<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and roleplay.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Arathorne, Solsek Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members? <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
