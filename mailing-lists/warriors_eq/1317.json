Bards work well too.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say no one will group with you?  Well, try asking.  I was on with my<br/>\ncleric (level 12) tonight for several hours and could not find a tank to<br/>\ngroup with me.  I saw one warrior that was my level that was soloing.  I old<br/>\nhim we should group up, but he said he preferred to solo so he wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nto share the loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was also a higher-up group that was asking for a tank for over an<br/>\nhour.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy does no one want to group?  Instead of grouping, you want faster hp<br/>\nregen.  This will make it easier to solo and reduce the need for a healer in<br/>\nthe group.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerdant wanted a game where complementary classes could work together to<br/>\nperform better.  I don&#39;t think Verdant will ever make it easier for a class<br/>\nto solo.  If anything, other classes might be altered to reduce their solo<br/>\ncapability.<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Date: Thu, 17 Jun 1999 11:23:55 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;John Cynkar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ref145@...\">ref145@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: This would help a bit...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Personally, i feel that warriors should have a sleeping ability, but not<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to the extent that all goes black.
