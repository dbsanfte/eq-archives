Your skills will advance it may take a couple levels but<br/>\nthey&#39;ll eventually get maxed out.  If I were to go by your strategy of<br/>\ngetting my self killed so my skills would be maxed out per level, I&#39;d still<br/>\nbe 25 working on my reposte skill, I&#39;m almost 28th, so don&#39;t expect<br/>\neverytime that you get a new skill that you will have it maxed out by the<br/>\ntime you make your next level.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;As far as factions are concerned.....one of the biggest advantages of being<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;evil&quot; is that you can kill any good NPC you want to, and some of the good<br/>\nNPCs drop really nice loot.
