It would be much <br/>\nmore beneficial if I could hit a creature more often at skill level 50 <br/>\ninstead of waiting until level 200 for that same chance to hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Allow Warriors to advance 6 points in Combat Skills per level instead of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>just 5. At &gt;any given level they would be 20% better at melee combat than the <br/>\nhybrids. <br/>\n<br/>\nNice idea, but I feel that&#39;s unfair to non-warriors.  Again, to get better at <br/>\nmelee combat than the other classes, see my suggestion above.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;A unique skill that no other class has.
