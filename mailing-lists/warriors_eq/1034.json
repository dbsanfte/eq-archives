You will never be able to effectively (meaning use it at your<br/>\n&gt; level of experience) use it until you attain the level at which you could<br/>\n&gt; have possibly acquired the item.  This is some newer code implemented to<br/>\n&gt; help reduce twinking.  You are just not skilled enough in the art to use<br/>\n&gt; this powerful a weapon.
