On multiple Mobs I use Painbringer and a<br/>\n&gt; Shield of the Slain Unicorn.  This combo causes AE<br/>\n&gt; dmg to all mobs to make sure that all focus on me,<br/>\n&gt; and the shield (due to my decent agility) adds 14 AC<br/>\n&gt; to reduce the amount of DMG I take.  The Monk and<br/>\n&gt; casters in our group deal out plenty of damage<br/>\n&gt; without the Mobs beating them to death.  If fighting<br/>\n&gt; multiple opponents who use damage shields, I use<br/>\n&gt; Fleshripper.  Again the AE of the weapon keeps the<br/>\n&gt; Mobs on me while I take significantly less dmg due<br/>\n&gt; to swinging fewer times while still dishing out<br/>\n&gt; excellent dmg.  Finally, if we are fighting a single<br/>\n&gt; Mob, I use the Executioner&#39;s Axe due to it&#39;s massive<br/>\n&gt; Dmg and the haste effect.  I have even been known to<br/>\n&gt; wield BullSmasher due to it&#39;s traditional Dwarven<br/>\n&gt; appeal (not to mention the tremendous dmg delay<br/>\n&gt; ratio). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hendall<br/>\n&gt; 42nd Dwarven Warrior<br/>\n&gt; Eci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; P.S. I believe the Ykesha effect is DD rather than<br/>\n&gt; AE.  Once I get one, I plan to use the Ykesha and<br/>\n&gt; Painbringer for the significant non-melee dmg.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 18 Oct 1999 16:37:18 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;shaner&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shaner@...\">shaner@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: items site?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well Dual Wielding is good from 13-20. After that 2h<br/>\n&gt; Weapons inflict MUCH more damage. Dual Wield really<br/>\n&gt; doesnt go off alot until lvl 38+, and by that time<br/>\n&gt; you should have an Executionars Axe (DAM 25 DELAY 50<br/>\n&gt; procs for Haste). With the exe axe my average slash<br/>\n&gt; is around 65 and i have had up to 81 normal and 142<br/>\n&gt; crits. However seems almost all the lvl 45+ warriors<br/>\n&gt; on my server  without fearplane blades are switching<br/>\n&gt; over to DW Short Swords of Ykesha (DAM 8 DELAY 24<br/>\n&gt; procs for 79-point Ykesha AE spell). Ykesha swords<br/>\n&gt; are hard to come by though, as they are found on the<br/>\n&gt; Ghould Lord (lvl 53) in Lower Guk. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nochtero D&#39;Ebonfury<br/>\n&gt; 35th Dark Elf Warrior<br/>\n&gt; Cazic-Thule </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
