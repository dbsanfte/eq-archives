IF they DID do that it wouldnt be with a<br/>\nwarrior and that makes sense to me, it would most probably be a monk thing<br/>\nseeing as how they are much faster and agile. But what verant should do as<br/>\nyou said is increase the damage that we go, and consistency that we hit at.<br/>\nI mean cmon, a level 37 warrior should not miss more that once per round<br/>\ndont you think? like you said we are trained in combat therefore we shouldnt<br/>\nmiss, and should do more damage. But i think the more multiple attacks is<br/>\nasking a bit much. The least Verant could do is increase tha damage we do on<br/>\na higher basis per level with some kind of weapon mastery skill. <br/>\n<br/>\nExample:<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant creates a type of specializatsion thing like casters get except<br/>\nwarriors get to pick from 1h , 2h shlashing, blunt and peircinfg. Say we get<br/>\nit at level 20, sounds fair, at that level we are becoming mighty warriors. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we go to our trainer and pracitse that specialization. THe more it goes<br/>\nup the better bonus we get while using that weapon class. (Like the bonus a<br/>\nrogue gets for using a peircing weapon but better.) Then as well after level<br/>\n20 we could get our damage up like 5 pts a level or something....<br/>\n<br/>\nwell something like that anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tJynxx[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jynxx@...\">Jynxx@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tThursday, June 10, 1999 3:30 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Petition<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ��&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt; &lt;META content=&quot;text/html; charset=unicode&quot;<br/>\n&gt; http-equiv=Content-Type&gt; &lt;META content=&quot;MSHTML 5.00.2614.3401&quot;<br/>\n&gt; name=GENERATOR&gt; &lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;BODY bgColor=#ffffff&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT<br/>\n&gt; size=2&gt;Ok...sorry...should have added on to that. The critical hit is<br/>\n&gt; nice, although I can definetly see monks getting that as well since they<br/>\n&gt; pretty much are supposed to know all the nerve points and such on a body.<br/>\n&gt; Also....let&#39;s try this on for size. Warriors need to get a BIG bonus on<br/>\n&gt; damage, not just every other round or so. We are fighting machines. Why,<br/>\n&gt; if I am level 45, should I not be able to be trained so well that I attack<br/>\n&gt; 6 times in one round? I know my sword, I know my enemy, and I know where<br/>\n&gt; to hit and how many times. I think we should get more attacks, more<br/>\n&gt; damage, AND critical hits. We should at least be on damage somewhat<br/>\n&gt; compareable to a spell caster. People are going to argue....&quot;But they use<br/>\n&gt; magic! How can a sword stroke compare to the Art?&quot; Well...when I take my<br/>\n&gt; 2-handed sword and chop off someone&#39;s head before you even get one<br/>\n&gt; syllable of a spell out of your mouth, the argument will be over. Lets<br/>\n&gt; face it...an object is an object. Sure a lightning strike MIGHT hurt more<br/>\n&gt; than getting hit with a double bladed axe right in your groin, but I<br/>\n&gt; personally have never been struck by either so who am I to say? It just<br/>\n&gt; seems to me that I should be able to hurt someone with a physical weapon<br/>\n&gt; actually hitting them just as much as someone hurling balls of fire at<br/>\n&gt; them. Grrrr.....this point is getting frustrating.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Jynxx&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
