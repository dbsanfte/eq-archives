Yeah they are<br/>\n&gt; making a whole new island south of faydwer area...the new race of lizardmen<br/>\n&gt; are going to be on that continent. So thats a bonus, Plus ive read that<br/>\n&gt; verant is also adding about 16-20 new zones on the existing world...im not<br/>\n&gt; sure where but thats what is going to happen, lets just hope they arent<br/>\n&gt; newbie areas =)<br/>\n&gt; John Zwanenburg<br/>\n&gt; Tips Support/Support Sipt<br/>\n&gt; Tel: (613) 998-2745<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: \tKelly Pruett[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pruett@...\">pruett@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: \tTuesday, June 01, 1999 9:57 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] CAMPING<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Kelly Pruett &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pruett@...\">pruett@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is it just me or do we need more areas in the game ... a couple of new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; zones<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t hurt. It MIGHT help with camping but then again ... it might not.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in Befallen the other night and I swear I couldn&#39;t see a single skelton<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; first floor and a half. (If you&#39;ve never been there it&#39;s like wall to wall<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skeletons.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, I hear you brother .... hopefully someone at Verant will notice<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; attempt to fix the situation in some way. Something like a high level mob<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spawn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on top of a camping group would suit me just fine.  :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Faderic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Mifsud, Michael&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Mifsud, Michael&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Mifsud@...\">Michael.Mifsud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmmm I am really starting to hate campers.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I use to take camping with a grain of salt and just move on.  This is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; now<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; becoming IMPOSSIBLE for me at my level to do.  Let me recite a little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; story.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I login on Saturday starting out in lake rathe, camped.  Not to fussed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; since<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I can not pull the aviaks anyway, only CASTERS can.  Whats up with that?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I moved on to the Egret Aviaks, CAMPED.  hmmm no problem lets try HH,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; both<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ends camped. sigh, oh well im near Neriak I can head home to stock up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; try out lesser faydark and Mistmoore.  On the boat I get, I arrive in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mistmoore for the first time, thought the place was pretty cool.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Learned<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the easier areas pretty quick and start pulling for my group.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wow this is going pretty well.  Hmmm zone went from 2 groups to 5<br/>\n&gt; &gt; groups.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One group SIITING on the gargoyle spawn, another group hogging THE whole<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; graveyard, and the third, this is the best, the third camping the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; CORRIDOR<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; between the easy side of Mistmoore to the hard side of Mistmoore.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mean<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; C&#39;MON.  Thats just RUDE.  Everytime we tried to pull some tuffer mobs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through the corridor their mages pets went berserk and they effectively<br/>\n&gt; &gt; took<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all the kills.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SIGH<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I remember when lake rathe was empty.  I remember when HH was empty.  Is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just because most people on the server are my level ?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; People just DONT understand that a spawn can only support SO many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; groups.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, a word of warning, NEVER take a caster to the Aviaks In Lake Rathe,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wont leave.  I know a few of my friends who I didn&#39;t see until they made<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level 25.  They just would not leave that easy xp area.  I hate it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ARGH!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ahhh I feel much better now, thanks for listening.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will be starting a new character on MM just to see if its a little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; WAY behind the pack.
