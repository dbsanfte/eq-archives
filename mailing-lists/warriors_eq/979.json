As I was <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; putting my stuff away I was think about the good times I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>has with my guild<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; mates hunting frogs in the dungeon.  I had never been to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Guk and it was a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; lot of fun.  Well mostly fun, that one train that wiped<br/>\n </span></blockquote>out the entire<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; party <br/>\n\t\t&gt; was no fun, especially the walk back from the high pass.<br/>\n\t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; So now I was along in the swamps and backing my stuff.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Darn backpacks<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; were <br/>\n\t\t&gt; heavy and as I put them all one I realized I was<br/>\n </span></blockquote>encumbered now the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; &quot;Spirit <br/>\n\t\t&gt; of the Bear&quot; had left me (141/130).  Time to go sell.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe there is a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; spot <br/>\n\t\t&gt; in South Ro I could sell, if not there I knew I could sell<br/>\n </span></blockquote>at the inn in <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; Oasis.

An easy trot saw a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>couple of frogs and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; an <br/>\n\t\t&gt; alligator or two, but nothing that looked worth hunting.<br/>\n\t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; Once I zoned to South Ro I decided to look around a bit to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>see what was <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; around.  Just a bunch of Orcs, had to kill a couple just<br/>\n </span></blockquote>because, but<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; didn&#39;t <br/>\n\t\t&gt; get any experience.

Time to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; sell my loot and get to killing crocodiles.<br/>\n\t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; As I was crossing the desert I came across a couple of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Troll and a dark<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; elf <br/>\n\t\t&gt; killing dervishes.  Stopped to check things out for a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>second and to see<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; what <br/>\n\t\t&gt; the camp looked like.  As I was checking things out I saw<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a skeleton <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; standing out in front of the tents all by himself.  Well,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>figured I would <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; get closer and check him out, might be some good<br/>\n </span></blockquote>experience for me on the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; way to Oasis.

Pissing off Rallos Zek is never a good<br/>\n </span></blockquote>idea.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; So I ran as fast as I can, past ghouls, giant spiders,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sand giants and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; orcs. <br/>\n\t\t&gt;   Finally I was back in the desert of South Ro, hugging<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the wall, and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; looking for my body.<br/>\n\t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; Running south to the dervish tents, I suddenly heard the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sound no one<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; wants <br/>\n\t\t&gt; to hear.  Even the bravest warrior blanches in fear when<br/>\n </span></blockquote>she hears the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; pounding footsteps of a giant behind her.<br/>\n\t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; A sand giant hits you for 96 points<br/>\n\t\t&gt; A sand giant hits you for 87 points<br/>\n\t\t&gt; You are stunned...<br/>\n\t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; Well that hurt.  Once I found myself back in the Pass I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>decided that was <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; enough for the day.
