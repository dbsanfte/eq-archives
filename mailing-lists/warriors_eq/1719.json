I learned alot of what I needed to<br/>\n&gt; know about warrioring from that board.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I indeed was part of the great warrior sitout (I think the first<br/>\n&gt; sitout). I remember Fitty, Ruatha & all the other Stratics guys egging<br/>\n&gt; all the warriors on to particpate (things really were hard on early<br/>\n&gt; warriors).   I was laughing when over your story about bronze...I myself<br/>\n&gt; did not get full bronze until lvl 24 (?) if I remember right.  Heck I<br/>\n&gt; used dual Mino Axes until lvl 18 (then had to get a combine long sword<br/>\n&gt; to kill undead in Unrest).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW another great warrior weapon to add to the &quot;uber&quot; list you mentioned<br/>\n&gt; is the bloodpoint 10/21 procs an 80 pt hp txf & is not lore (drops in<br/>\n&gt; Howling Stones).  I have 1 of these at the moment & with werwolf form<br/>\n&gt; see 8-9 procs a fight.
