No way should we be able to cause the damage high level magic users can, but do we do enough as we are now?  This survey is intended to gather a consensus from this mailing list to submit as feedback to Verant.  If enough of us agree on the same thing Verant will look into the issues and make adjustments as they have for other classes.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDo we need to ask Verant to change anything about the Warrior class?  If yes (or undecided) what would you like to see?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI will compile the results and post them to list next week.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of Rallos Zek\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPatty Halas\r<br/>\nBarbarian Warrior Princess\r<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\nPossible answers are:<br/>\n<br/>\no better defense<br/>\no better warrior-only armor<br/>\no better warrior-only weapons<br/>\no a high level magic item that allows warriors to heal themselves<br/>\no allowing combat and defense skills rise above the current cap of 200 (say to 240 or so)<br/>\no Critical Hit during melee<br/>\no Once a day Battle Cry<br/>\no Increase bind wound from 50% to 75% for warriors<br/>\no None of the above<br/>\no Something different (please email your remarks to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>)<br/>\n               <br/>\n<br/>\nTo vote, please visit the following web page:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/surveycenter/warriors_eq\">http://www.onelist.com/surveycenter/warriors_eq</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nwarriors_eq Owner</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
