Do you<br/>\n&gt; use a site to see what items are available?  Which one?  How could it<br/>\n&gt; be better?  Do you care about news on an items site, or just the<br/>\n&gt; items?  Would it need quests listed for quest for items, entirely, or<br/>\n&gt; just starting point?  List of Mob it comes from?My reason for asking:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m thinking about making one, and if I do, I want it to be THE items<br/>\n&gt; site to go to.  I&#39;ve actually already got the database designed, I<br/>\n&gt; just need to work on inputting info and designing the site layout.  I<br/>\n&gt; could have a preview(not all items) up in 2 days or less if I get<br/>\n&gt; enough response.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;      From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;      Sent: Sunday, October 17, 1999 5:24 AM<br/>\n&gt;      To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;      Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] One hand or two?<br/>\n&gt;      Matt-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      I have a 30th level barbarian warrior on Veeshan. I can only<br/>\n&gt;      tell you what I&#39;ve chosen<br/>\n&gt;      Max out 1hs, 2hs, taunt, kick, slam/bash  and I am working<br/>\n&gt;      on archery (this has helped me take down runners).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Some have said take up piercing. When you get duel attack<br/>\n&gt;      and duel weild only for the fact that a piercing weapon is<br/>\n&gt;      faster and will help max these skills out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      I find that 1hs with duel weild is more effective in certain<br/>\n&gt;      circumstances and then 2hs in another. 1hs gives you speed<br/>\n&gt;      of attack. 2hs is good for greatest impact (recently got a<br/>\n&gt;      crit hit of 100.. now that was sweet). If you use a 2hs or<br/>\n&gt;      1hs will also depend on your group make up. I do carry all<br/>\n&gt;      my weapons with me so at times will switch depending on the<br/>\n&gt;      circumstance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      All my reading and such have said to keep both maxed out.<br/>\n&gt;      Some reasons are the performance of the weapon others for<br/>\n&gt;      the variety of weapons you can use. I didn&#39;t work on my 2hs<br/>\n&gt;      until I was at the 28th level and it was very painful to max<br/>\n&gt;      it out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Good luck!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Az<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Matthew Horne wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;   G&#39;day my name is Kalroth.. a level 7 dwarf warrior on<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; the solusek ro serverMy question is whether one hand or<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; two hand slash is better for a warrior Hope you can help<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; me , thanks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
