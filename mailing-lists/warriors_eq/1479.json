Was a good group.  But he was level 35 almost<br/>\nevery time we killed him.  He coned white to another lvl 35 warrior in my<br/>\ngroup.  He did con yellow a few times to him as well.  I think we got him<br/>\nabout 5 or 6 times total. Also, is there a spell that is similiar to harm<br/>\ntouch that has an a one time popper?  Every time we would get him, he would<br/>\nimmediately pop off this ability that would take the lvl 35 warrior to 2<br/>\nbubbles of health.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not doubting you, but just stating what I have seen.  I was also told<br/>\nhe wasa a shadow night by others and just passing it along.  If I am wrong,<br/>\nit is good to know so I dont pass along bunk info anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Dyvim Kincaid<br/>\nWarrior of Cazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kevin Koen [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:big_k69@...\">big_k69@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, July 15, 1999 1:48 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [warriors_eq] what should i be looking for now?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Kevin Koen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:big_k69@...\">big_k69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ALSO the AVATAR of FEAR is not a shadowknight.... but he does has some<br/>\n&gt; awesome dmg spells. and he will Fear u everychance  he gets...,make sure<br/>\n&gt; someone in your group has stun or a stun spell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: James Wofford &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:James.Wofford@...\">James.Wofford@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: RE: [warriors_eq] what should i be looking for now?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Wed, 14 Jul 1999 11:04:16 -0600<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: James Wofford &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:James.Wofford@...\">James.Wofford@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I wouldnt start heading to Solusek A until around 25 and up.  Maybe even<br/>\n&gt; &gt;higher. I didnt go anyway there until level 30.  Solusek B is much more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dangerous.  I just set foot inside at level 30 and the first thing I saw<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;red.  May have been bad luck to see a powerful Goblin right off<br/>\n&gt; the bat, or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;maybe that is the way the whole place is.  Do not know, I didnt go any<br/>\n&gt; &gt;farther.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;As for the demon claw.  You should (I would think) depending on<br/>\n&gt; the server<br/>\n&gt; &gt;your on, and how many high level characters are on the server be able to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;pick on up for around 200 - 300 plat.  The shouldnt be for trade only<br/>\n&gt; &gt;items,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and they can be obtained around level 32 on your own with a<br/>\n&gt; group.  Though<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you DEFINITELY better have 2 clerics and someone at least around<br/>\n&gt; level 35.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The mob is a level 35 SK and has a 800point harm touch from what I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;heard.  He never got me with the touch.  He also smacks ya<br/>\n&gt; around a little<br/>\n&gt; &gt;harder and alot faster than a Sand Giant.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Dyvim Kincaid<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Warrior of Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: David Rogers [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:derogers334@...\">derogers334@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 14, 1999 9:58 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [warriors_eq] what should i be looking for now?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: David Rogers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:derogers334@...\">derogers334@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- James Wofford &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:James.Wofford@...\">James.Wofford@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as weapons are concerned.
