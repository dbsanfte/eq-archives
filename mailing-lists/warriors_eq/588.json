I typed feedback<br/>\nfor this, since I think its a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt then occurred to me, why cant Dark Elf warriors get a similar title.  Why<br/>\ncant we get Dragoon added to our names when we hit level 45 (or whatever<br/>\nlevel the Dragoons are).  Either get it automatically, IF we want it or<br/>\nperform a quest to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI already wrote feedback on this, if anyone else thinks its a good idea,<br/>\ncould I ask you all to write some feed back :) ?<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
