I<br/>\nkept my 1H blunt up as well, but then I look through a list of 1h blunts<br/>\navailable and found out they sucked or a warrior couldn&#39;t use them.  They&#39;re<br/>\nare some very nice Piercing weapons however.  Dual wielding one of these<br/>\nwith a 1H slash can be very nasty.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.-- since you are playing a Dark Elf (my race preference), if I ever see<br/>\nyou grouping with or helping out any races besides the Evil Triad, I will<br/>\nhunt you down and kill you.
