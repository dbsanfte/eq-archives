I can not believe<br/>\n&gt;that all of the unique items in the game have been found<br/>\n&gt;already.  There are new items popping up on EQ&#39;Lizer every<br/>\n&gt;day that I have never heard of.  And with the game being<br/>\n&gt;dynamic, you could find the &#39;ultimate sword&#39; on a high level<br/>\n&gt;mob that used to carry something else.  Personally I would<br/>\n&gt;like to see a pair of boots that have the power to gate you<br/>\n&gt;back to your bound spot by tapping your heels together<br/>\n&gt;and shouting &quot;Theres no place like home&quot;  3 times :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: \tMifsud, Michael[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Mifsud@...\">Michael.Mifsud@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: \tTuesday, May 25, 1999 1:25 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: \tTom Swift; &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Rangers and warriors<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Mifsud, Michael&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Mifsud@...\">Michael.Mifsud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bah!  All those people who talk about uniqueness have not played high<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enough<br/>\n&gt; &gt; levels to compare.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A warrior IS unique, but it does not kick in until much later.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have not played until level 50, but I did here Brad quote that a human<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warrior (or was it barbarian warrior, not sure) gets something like <br/>\n&gt;3000hp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at level 50.  3000!!!  That will be a HELL of a lot more than ANY other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class.  Its not just a couple hundred hp, its a lot more.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Basically what makes us unique is we can take punishment like no other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class.  We can also dish out continuous damage.  but we are NOT the mob<br/>\n&gt; &gt; killers, wizards are.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My ONLY whine is the &quot;warriors are the only class that can wear all <br/>\n&gt;armour<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the game&quot;.  This is just dishonest.  Certain kinds of magic plate can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worn by ALL other classes.  This I REALLY wish they would change.  I <br/>\n&gt;think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the only classes that should be able to wear plate are Warriors, <br/>\n&gt;Paladins<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and SK&#39;s.  I also think the BEST plate in the game should be ONLY <br/>\n&gt;wearable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by Warriors.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Its not like we have a lot of weapon choices, we have 1 ultimate weapon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which is unattainable until atleast level 40 or so, its also an axe.  So<br/>\n&gt; &gt; atleast give us some warrior only armour.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; O.K. ill shutup now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slu@...\">slu@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slu@...\">slu@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: \tTuesday, May 25, 1999 5:14 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: \tTom Swift; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Rangers and warriors<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slu@...\">slu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yup & the gap seems to get worse the higher in levels you go.  Not <br/>\n&gt;only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rangers, but Paladins & especially Monks seem to greatly diminish the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; role<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the warrior at levels 25+.  Eventually the other classes have <br/>\n&gt;similar<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (within a couple of 100 hps) stats and much more diversity in terms of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; healing & hth damage capability.  Mind you that my opinion is based on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; talking with high level players (who have tried to convince me to dump<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; warrior) & from reading on the eqstratics site.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is an interesting thread on the eqstratics board (warriors)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; regarding the perceived lack of differentiation (or all out weakness) <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our class at higher levels.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What does the rest of the list think?  Anyone have direct experience<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; playing these classes at level 30+ & can compare HTH damage &<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; effectiveness against critters?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rob Wilbarg  aka Flair in Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ** Original Subject: [warriors_eq] Rangers and warriors<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ** Original Sender: &quot;Tom Swift&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ** Original Date: Mon, 24 May 1999 12:26:45 -0400<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ** Original Message follows...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This past week I decided to take a break from my level 15 dark elf<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; warrior.  I was abit frustrated.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I started a half-elf warrior in Kelethin.  It is insanely easy to <br/>\n&gt;play<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there.  I made level 5 in about 3.5 hours.  Then I stopped and tried a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wood elf ranger.  Has anyone else played a ranger?  I imagine it is <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; most poorly balanced of all the hybrids.  After 4 hours I reached <br/>\n&gt;level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 5<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and got kick.  I am now 12-18 hours into the character and almost <br/>\n&gt;level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 9.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am just as capable as an equivalent warrior.  Next level I gain an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; array<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of spells which will boost my combat effectiveness and allow me to <br/>\n&gt;heal.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Part of the easy success is the plethora of low level orcs available a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stone&#39;s throw from Kelethin.  With my tracking ability I am never at a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; loss for targets and I can engage blue con orcs in rapid succession or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even 2 at a time. I can even engage and successfully beat yellow con<br/>\n&gt; &gt; orcs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more than 50% of the time and almost always can kill orcs that con <br/>\n&gt;even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me without trouble. So far it seems that I get as many hit points now <br/>\n&gt;as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my warrior did.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My point is, with a ranger class as powerful a combatant as it is I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little necessity for the pure warrior.  I am going to play through to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level 15 I think, just to see a more even comparison.  My concern is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from a game mechanics perspective though as I have no doubt my playing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a dark elf was a much more rewarding experience.  Has anyone else<br/>\n&gt; &gt; noticed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that the warrior just is not different enough from the hybrid fighter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; classes?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bael                                                    Aelyn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Warrior of the 15th Order      or              Ranger of the 8th <br/>\n&gt;Rank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Indigo Brotherhood                                Humble Servant of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tunare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still undecided<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;** --------- End Original Message ----------- **<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist has over 150,000 e-mail communities from which to chose!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations to &quot;M-K-ROSES,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life!<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
