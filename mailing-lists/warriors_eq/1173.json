A","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1829757835\">Your points are well taken. But consider this:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt *is* a fantasy setting. Or we wouldn&#39;t be running around fighting ghouls<br/>\nwith magic swords you know?  A single sword swipe would end our lives and<br/>\nthere would be no *respawn*<br/>\n<br/>\nA mage will do more damage to a giant in a shorter amount of time due to the<br/>\neconomies of scale.  Imagine what the skin on a creature the size of a hill<br/>\ngiant must be like.  It has to contain literally tons of internal organs and<br/>\nfluids. That means that it is going to be significantly stronger than human<br/>\nflesh.  Probably more like a heavy leather, much like an elephant.<br/>\nTherefore your sword slashing simply isn&#39;t going to be as effective, and you<br/>\nwon&#39;t be deftly slashing through tendons and throats and disabling your<br/>\nopponent in 20 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, back to fantasy setting now.  We aren&#39;t using katanas in EQ.  The<br/>\nweapons of a warrior are not precision weapons.  A 2 handed sword is<br/>\ndesigned for a heavy over the shoulder strike.  A blow to an unarmored<br/>\nopponent (in reality) is fatal. But it isn&#39;t for slashing tendons.  A<br/>\nlongsword is a slashing weapon, but it is a bit unwieldy for precision<br/>\nstrikes.  Forget about real uses of real weapons though, this is fantasy<br/>\nremember?  You can imagine what you will, but in EQ there are rules of the<br/>\nworld, so you won&#39;t be running up a giant&#39;s back and sticking your sword in<br/>\nhis eye.  I don&#39;t know a game that will let you do that. &quot;Thief&quot; comes close<br/>\nbut still isn&#39;t what you are talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe warrior is a hack&#39;n&#39;slash &quot;Conan&quot; type.  We aren&#39;t knights...those are<br/>\npaladins in this game.  We aren&#39;t ninjas, samurai or any other sword<br/>\nwielding supermen.  We stand toe to toe with our opponents and trade blows.<br/>\nIf we are faster, stronger, more skilled we win.  If we are not, we lose.<br/>\nSome things are just so big and hit so hard, that we can&#39;t possibly melee<br/>\nwith them until we are so skilled the creature offers no experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe warrior excels in a full party with a cleric.  Try it and you will see.<br/>\n3 and 4 person parties aren&#39;t the same, because you will often be the<br/>\nprimary target of high level mobs and take alot of damage.  But a full party<br/>\nwith 2 warriors and 1 cleric plus other assorted baggage is a group that can<br/>\ntake much higher level mobs without losing members.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said before the EQ is about grouping and balance.  Warriors deal alot of<br/>\ndamage slowly and consistently.  In the same time warriors absorb alot of<br/>\nattacks.  Remember when mages get hit in melee they always take damage,<br/>\nwhile warriors are dodging and parrying. If a mage loses his tank, he is<br/>\nmost likely dead. He won&#39;t be able to cast his high damage spells because<br/>\nthey take to long to cast, he will have to resort to small damage attacks<br/>\nbecause they cast faster and won&#39;t get interrupted.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery class has advantages and disadvantages. The warrior class is just<br/>\nlacking in unique advantages.  We get all the really good combat skills many<br/>\nlevels ahead of all the hybrids.  We just need something to set us apart in<br/>\nmelee.  I will reiterate that a critical hit skill is the most likely way to<br/>\ndo this.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant will never give warriors and kind of consistent massive damage<br/>\ninducing ability.  But I think the critical hit solution will satisfy your<br/>\nbelief that you should be able to quickly slash a tendon and do heavy<br/>\ndamage.  You just aren&#39;t going to be able to do it every round, or count on<br/>\nits success.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
