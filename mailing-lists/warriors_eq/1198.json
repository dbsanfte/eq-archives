Why?  Because it builds an illusion that you, the player, are really in the game (artificial immersion).  His examples of RL sword play just illustrate the pragmatic limitations of swinging a sword (and getting pooped as a result). <br/>\n<br/>\nI think EQ is justified in exaggerating these limitations in order to propagate the illusion that we are like Conan the barbarian.  This illusion is what makes ROLE PLAYING work.  Ask any old D&D player (ever heard of Gary Gygax?  people used to quote him like this &quot;Brad&quot; feller).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game gets too cartoonish (and mechanical) when these things get too far apart though.  I think the jist of this thread was that there needs to be a balance between the 2, strict RL principles & pure fantasy through discussions regarding Stamina etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be nice to see this conversation continue down this path rather than see discussions regarding one persons physical prowess (or perceived prowess)<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ** Original Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Digest Number 60<br/>\n&gt; ** Original Sender: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ** Original Date: Fri, 11 Jun 1999 15:43:27 -0400<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ** Original Message follows... <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Date: Fri, 11 Jun 1999 09:32:11 -0700<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: &quot;Obergfell, Steven&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SObergfell@...\">SObergfell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Petition or Melee vs. Caster damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;But the Warrior does have a limiting factor: Stamina.  Once again, I will<br/>\n&gt; &gt;draw from my experience in wielding broad swords in real life.  After about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;3 to 5 minutes of constant fighting, in 100 lbs. of armor guess what, you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;are wiped out and need to rest a bit.  Just like the mage has to rest while<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dealing out those spells, we warriors should need to rest after fighting in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;all that armor and swinging that 3 to 5 lbs. sword around, 9 lbs. in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;case of great swords.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once again, your real life experiences have no bearing on EQ, a fantasy<br/>\n&gt; role-playing game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe you need a rest every 3-5 minutes because your stamina is much lower<br/>\n&gt; than that of a troll or barbarian.  Maybe if you spent your whole life<br/>\n&gt; training to be a warrior, you would have greater stamina.  EQ Warriors can<br/>\n&gt; fight longer than your 3-5 minutes because they exercise instead of playing<br/>\n&gt; video games.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wayne<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;** --------- End Original Message ----------- **<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
