It has<br/>\nnothing to do with who Pansa is or what he has done, they simply refuse to<br/>\naccept that a dark elf, a Tier&#39;dal, any servant of Hatred can possibly be<br/>\ngood.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor reference, those of you who are familiar with Drizzit Do&#39;Urden.  He was<br/>\na level20+ fighter/level 20+ ranger.  He was at least level 20 before he<br/>\ncame to live aboveground, and likely another 15 levels before he was<br/>\naccepted by even a small percent of the population in an isolated area.  He<br/>\naccepted that in some areas he would never ever be accepted because of his<br/>\nrace and what it represents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI for one believe that Pansa should be able to achieve acceptance in a city<br/>\nlike Freeport where there is a &quot;melting pot&quot; of races and religions.<br/>\nHowever, he should never be accepted into the city of the wood elves.  It<br/>\ngoes against the principles of the game for one, and on another note the<br/>\nFeir&#39;dal and Tier&#39;dal are ancient enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my opinion.  In fact I play a rogue dark elf warrior.  I chose my deity<br/>\nas Agnostic initially, though I roleplayed a follower of Innoruuk up to<br/>\nabout level 13 or so.  I then met a high elf by the name of Rahl who with<br/>\nhis group risked their lives to aid me in a nearly lost cause.  This had a<br/>\nprofound impact on the development of my character. Now Bael is unsure of<br/>\nhis path, and falls back and forth between his &quot;natural&quot; heritage and his<br/>\nnew uncertain &quot;path of light&quot; which he has embarked on.  I had somewhat<br/>\nplanned that the character would at some point come to this realization.  It<br/>\nisn&#39;t in me to roleplay the superior and self-centered kind of race the dark<br/>\nelf is.  I can&#39;t stand by and watch someone die when I know I could help.<br/>\nThe end result is an excellent roleplay which is alot of fun.  In general to<br/>\nmany of the dark races just become the shining pinnacle of goodness of their<br/>\nraces.  I do love trolls though....a better group of roleplayers you will be<br/>\nhard pressed to find. Ok I am babbling again...shutting up now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBael<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mallachyte@...\">Mallachyte@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mallachyte@...\">Mallachyte@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, June 16, 1999 4:14 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [warriors_eq] Factions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mallachyte@...\">Mallachyte@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In a message dated 6/15/99 11:58:04 PM Pacific Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Mifsud@...\">Michael.Mifsud@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; Must every DE be a Drizzt? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Be a who?
