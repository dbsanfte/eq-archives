(You<br/>\nknow where they are already I am sure.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as strentgh goes, with my warrior 128 STR and a BBC I can hit for max<br/>\nof 50 at level 32.  The STR bonuses do not kick in until after level 20.<br/>\nAnd even then I do not believe they are fully applicable until level 25.<br/>\nWhen I was grouped with a High Elf Paladin of equivelant level with only a<br/>\n100 STR he could hit for approximately 44 or so.  So I do not thing STR<br/>\nplays that great of a role in damage.  Its more for carrying<br/>\nitems/armor/loot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Davis, Chad (cdavis) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cdavis@...\">cdavis@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 13, 1999 4:31 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [warriors_eq] Warriors do not suck<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Davis, Chad (cdavis)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cdavis@...\">cdavis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2 questions for the knowledgable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone have a good list of Warrior weapons and where to find<br/>\n&gt; them?
