How else can a Warrior steal kills from a Caster???� Anyway, I<br/>\n&gt; currently only have ringmail and some banded for armor and what I really<br/>\n&gt; want is plate.� Bronze plate I hear is fairly reasonable, though heavy,<br/>\n&gt; which shouldn&#39;t be a problem with my high Strength.� Does anyone know<br/>\n&gt; where the best place to acquire Medium sized Bronze plate is?� I&#39;ve got my<br/>\n&gt; weapons, and now I need to beef up my armor.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Odhinn MacDoughl<br/>\n&gt; Skald, Hand of Tyr<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
