Seems to me that Barbs, Ogres, and Trolls got a tremendous<br/>\n&gt; warrior advantage in this game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jason Coan wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ya know why?  because humans, stat-wise, pretty much suck.  ie, and DE<br/>\n&gt; has base int of 99, human has 100 as max......DE warriors are almost as<br/>\n&gt; smart as human casters, haha, and I always remind them of this when I see<br/>\n&gt; them :)  (assuming its day time and they are not more than 5 steps away so<br/>\n&gt; they can see me).  And thats just an example of their pathetic<br/>\n&gt; inteligence, the rest of their stats are equally unimpressive.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
