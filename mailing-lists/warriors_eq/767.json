I live in Japan and when I get home from work<br/>\nMonday night and I login to EQ its aprox 4am or 4:30am Monday morning in the<br/>\nUSA (PST).  Number of people on my server is aprox 250 to 350.  The whole<br/>\nplace is dead.  I went to najena to kill some TT and me and my partner (who<br/>\nlives in Denmark) were the only ones in there.  Two people! unbelievable.<br/>\nAbout an hour later one other lower level person showed up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bet that the Tomahawk will be camped very lightly (I wont go so far to say<br/>\nit WONT be camped at all).  The only people who may be camping it will most<br/>\nlikely be Japanese or MAYBE some Europeans (thou in Europe it will be aprox.<br/>\nearly afternoon, like 1pm or so).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there Japanese you wont have any sharing problems, but please EXPLAIN to<br/>\nthem you want to share the spawn.  For some reason (until you explain the<br/>\nidea to them, and it helps if you speak Japanese) the concept of kill<br/>\nstealing and alternating kills doesn&#39;t occur to them.  No idea why.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience when its explained to them they never do it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell hope that helps, maybe.  Good luck getting the Tomi.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tNick Morgowicz[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nomorgow@...\">nomorgow@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, May 25, 1999 1:15 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Polished Granite Tomahawk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Nick Morgowicz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nomorgow@...\">nomorgow@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This seems to be the most camped weapon that i&#39;ve ever seen.
