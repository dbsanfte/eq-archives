Right now I do <br/>\nabout 24 each hand and since I am already maxed my level out in duel weild, <br/>\ndouble attack and 1h slashing, I duel and double attack almost every hit. so <br/>\nthast about 44-48 dmg per round.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always herd at high levels that you not only hit for 12 (sometimes 13) <br/>\nbut more... I&#39;ve never seen this happen to me, when will I start hitting for <br/>\nmore?  Whast going on with this area?<br/>\n<br/>\ndouble combine long swords are great, but I need some advise...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think when I hit lvl 20, I&#39;m going to upgrade my weaponry.<br/>\nDo I go for some PGT&#39;s or shold I try and go for some Painbringers or should <br/>\nI even go for soem gnoulbanes? (BTW I am going to duel weild and want 2x the <br/>\nweapon)<br/>\n<br/>\nat lvl 20, what will be the idle and most level area weapon can I even get?? <br/>\n             Thnx for your time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDealan<br/>\nOf the 17th level<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
