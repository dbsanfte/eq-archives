Then if you can find one other level 4 or 5<br/>\nchar, go for normal froglocks or a weak froglock fisherman....oonce you hit<br/>\n5 you can probably solo them as well as the occasion swamp alligator, once<br/>\non level 6 head to guk but dont go in too deep, stik the the larger froglock<br/>\ntads and sentinels....good exp for you and the occasional woven/netted<br/>\narmor, (which sells great to any monks or spell casters. Oh you can get<br/>\nnetted off the small froglock tads as well.) then once you hit 10 id suggest<br/>\nmaking your way to the south desert of ro, find a group and kill dercishes<br/>\nand orcs, at around 13-15 go for the oasis and kill crocs, caimans, and the<br/>\noccasional Deepwater caiman....just watch out for the giants,<br/>\n...........after that the rest is up to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nlemme know if you need any more advise...i have a troll SK so i know the<br/>\narea very very well.<br/>\nJohn Zwanenburg<br/>\nTips Support/Support Sipt<br/>\nTel: (613) 998-2745<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tBryan Hinkel[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bjhinkel@...\">bjhinkel@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tWednesday, May 19, 1999 9:54 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Playing a Troll Warrior<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Bryan Hinkel&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bjhinkel@...\">bjhinkel@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hail Great and learned warriors.  I have decided to start playing a Troll <br/>\n&gt; Warrior and would like some advice.  All I know now is to grab the first<br/>\n&gt; two <br/>\n&gt; handed sword I can find and start killing everything in site.
