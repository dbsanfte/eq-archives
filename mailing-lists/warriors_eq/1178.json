Now that <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t entirely<br/>\n&gt; work in an online RPG, but Verant&#39;s solution is the next best <br/>\n&gt; thing.  Any<br/>\n&gt; quest or unique item should not be allowed to be possessed in multiple<br/>\n&gt; quantities by a single player.  This way if someone wants to <br/>\n&gt; camp the BBC<br/>\n&gt; because they have it and found out how valuable it is, they <br/>\n&gt; can.  But they<br/>\n&gt; must sell theirs before getting another.  It simply removes the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;profitability&quot; for camping items from some players.  I think <br/>\n&gt; the dwarven<br/>\n&gt; tunic should be a lore item as well as the dwarven axes.  I <br/>\n&gt; have just come<br/>\n&gt; from there and people I saw camping these items day after <br/>\n&gt; day.  Now I am in<br/>\n&gt; the commonlands or North Ro and these same people are selling <br/>\n&gt; multiples of<br/>\n&gt; those items.  They built and inventory of unique items and <br/>\n&gt; are now selling<br/>\n&gt; them.  2 of those people were warriors and not mages, which <br/>\n&gt; saddens me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think dual PGTs should be allowed any more than a <br/>\n&gt; ranger could have<br/>\n&gt; dual Ebony Blades or dual Oaken Scimitars.  I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; particularly like the<br/>\n&gt; whole economy of unique magic weapons and items either.  <br/>\n&gt; Making them lore<br/>\n&gt; items and ineligble for trading and selling will go along way <br/>\n&gt; to reducing<br/>\n&gt; camping and letting people get these items on their own.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The only reason some of these items are so expensive is <br/>\n&gt; because high level<br/>\n&gt; people will simply camp these easy to kill NPCs and prevent <br/>\n&gt; others from<br/>\n&gt; obtaining them.  I watched one group of mages in Crushbone <br/>\n&gt; who would watch<br/>\n&gt; for escaping mobs like Crush, the warlord, darish, royal <br/>\n&gt; guard, etc.  and<br/>\n&gt; would cast invis on it.  They either knew where the mobs flee <br/>\n&gt; to or they<br/>\n&gt; were using some magic to see invisible.  But they would wait <br/>\n&gt; till the mob<br/>\n&gt; regenerated more than half its hit points and then kill it.  <br/>\n&gt; They stole<br/>\n&gt; these kills in the most dishonorable way for pure profit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ok, now I am ranting and will get off my soapbox. But I do feel pretty<br/>\n&gt; strongly about this topic.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bael<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jeff Auman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff.auman@...\">jeff.auman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thursday, June 10, 1999 8:20 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] EQ&#39;Lizer Article<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Jeff Auman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff.auman@...\">jeff.auman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jim Ramsay wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Those of you dreaming<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of dual wielding Polished Granite Tomahawks can forget it, they are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; pending Lore items now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sorry, this should read:  Those of you who just got two PGT&#39;s, you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &gt;now screwed.
