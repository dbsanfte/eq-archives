Most warriors recommend working up both 1h-s and<br/>\n2h-s; you may want to also work, at your preference,<br/>\n1h-b, 2h-b and/or pierce.<br/>\n<br/>\n6th - 10th, work on upgrading to leather/rawhide<br/>\narmor, with the odd piece that&#39;s low-level magical. <br/>\nBy 10th you should be able to have a minotaur axe<br/>\n(1h-s) and/or a FS weapon(s) for your first two or<br/>\nthree weapon skill preferences.<br/>\n<br/>\n11th - 15th, start collecting banded and magical<br/>\narmor, work away from any rusty weapons, and start<br/>\nworking on combine and/or magical weapons in your<br/>\nprefered slots.<br/>\n<br/>\n16th - plus, it varies.  You&#39;ll start working<br/>\nexclusively with groups, or spending a lot of time<br/>\nbegging for heals.  You&#39;ll be hanging out in areas<br/>\nwhere money and/or valuable or useful item drops start<br/>\nto happen with greater frequency.  By this point you<br/>\nneed at least one magical weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook over the warrior skill progression and note which<br/>\nyou&#39;ll be interested in; decide if you like kick or<br/>\nbash, if you like dual wield vs 1h/shield vs 2h. <br/>\nAdvance and item yourself accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
