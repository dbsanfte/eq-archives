I am just a poor <br/>\nbarbarian princess that lost her combine longsword (long story, don&#39;t ask!)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo offense, but I think that&#39;s the problem.  The developers seem to have felt <br/>\nthat everyone who plays a warrior is a beginner or someone who doesn&#39;t want <br/>\nto be forced to ever make a decision or use player skill more than measuring <br/>\nwhat to attack, when to attack and when and how to try to run and hide (all <br/>\nof which requires patience and common sense more than anything else; two <br/>\nqualities I don&#39;t necessarily associate with my idea of a fantastic medieval <br/>\nwarrior who wants to kill gnolls, minotaurs, mammoths and dragons but <br/>\nnevermind that).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we should be given far more to work with.  Really, how many hours (or <br/>\nminutes) did it take everyone to master the EQ &quot;melee system&quot;?  Given <br/>\nhundreds of hours to practice, I really don&#39;t think that there&#39;s too many <br/>\nlevels of complexity out there which all of us couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t be able <br/>\nto readily master without having to think too much and assuming we weren&#39;t <br/>\nhit with all of our choices at 1st level (which could be intimidating).  I <br/>\nlike playing a warrior in RPGs but not because it&#39;s the simplest or easiest <br/>\nclass, although it too-often is.  I can&#39;t stand EQ warriors primarily because <br/>\nwhether or not they can talk the talk, they can&#39;t walk the walk, but <br/>\nadditionally because there&#39;s no special player skill involved when playing <br/>\none; they have no flexibility in fights and few options other than sit there <br/>\nand die or not (while swinging for 1/4th - 1/10th the damage of some other <br/>\nclasses).  That&#39;s just not my definition of &quot;warrior.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, RPing a simpleton or a crude, ignorant savage is another matter entirely <br/>\nwhich should have nothing to do with game mechanics or the combat style <br/>\nrequirements of a high ranking swordsman.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
