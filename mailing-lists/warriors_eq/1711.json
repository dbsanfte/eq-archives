This impacted ALL classes &amp; \n          not just warriors. To be honest in 5 hours of Howling Stones last \n          night Ididn&#39;t notice the difference (i.e. with my Bloodpoint &amp; \n          werewolf form I still saw plenty of agro).<br>3) Warriors were only \n          &quot;useless&quot; the first 6 months of the games existence...I know I \n          experienced it first hand (same armor, weapons &amp; hps as everyone \n          else with zero distinguishing skills) .&nbsp; These days with decent \n          warr specific armor &amp; weapons we tank very well at most \n          levels.<br>4) The idea that warriors don&#39;t contribute significant \n          offensive damage is an old idea.&nbsp; With the uber hps high level \n          MOBs the damage we contribute over time is quite significant.<br>5) \n          Raising the defensive caps for the other classes actually makes them \n          stronger in the groups I play in.&nbsp; That means my groups survive \n          more. I kind of like that.<br>6) The mid 30s-40s is a tough spot for \n          warriors.&nbsp; Mostly because the other tank classes (Rangers/SKs in \n          particular) have similar agro capability to ourselves at this point \n          but little experience in the value of their role in a group.&nbsp; By \n          the mid 40s very few Rangers, SKs &amp; Pallies are actively trying \n          wrest agro away from a warrior...at least if they have any \n          brains.<br><br>regards<br><br>Flair Shieldrender<br>54 Champion Fennin \n          Ro<br><br>James Wofford wrote:<br>\n          <blockquote type=\"cite\"\n><pre>sigh..
