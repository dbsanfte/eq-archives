","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-473114260\">Bah!  All those people who talk about uniqueness have not played high enough<br/>\nlevels to compare.<br/>\n<br/>\nA warrior IS unique, but it does not kick in until much later.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not played until level 50, but I did here Brad quote that a human<br/>\nwarrior (or was it barbarian warrior, not sure) gets something like 3000hp<br/>\nat level 50.  3000!!!  That will be a HELL of a lot more than ANY other<br/>\nclass.  Its not just a couple hundred hp, its a lot more.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically what makes us unique is we can take punishment like no other<br/>\nclass.  We can also dish out continuous damage.  but we are NOT the mob<br/>\nkillers, wizards are.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ONLY whine is the &quot;warriors are the only class that can wear all armour<br/>\nin the game&quot;.  This is just dishonest.  Certain kinds of magic plate can be<br/>\nworn by ALL other classes.  This I REALLY wish they would change.  I think<br/>\nthe only classes that should be able to wear plate are Warriors, Paladins<br/>\nand SK&#39;s.  I also think the BEST plate in the game should be ONLY wearable<br/>\nby Warriors.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIts not like we have a lot of weapon choices, we have 1 ultimate weapon<br/>\nwhich is unattainable until atleast level 40 or so, its also an axe.  So<br/>\natleast give us some warrior only armour.  <br/>\n<br/>\nO.K. ill shutup now.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slu@...\">slu@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slu@...\">slu@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, May 25, 1999 5:14 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \tTom Swift; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Rangers and warriors<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slu@...\">slu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tom<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yup & the gap seems to get worse the higher in levels you go.  Not only<br/>\n&gt; Rangers, but Paladins & especially Monks seem to greatly diminish the role<br/>\n&gt; of the warrior at levels 25+.  Eventually the other classes have similar<br/>\n&gt; (within a couple of 100 hps) stats and much more diversity in terms of<br/>\n&gt; healing & hth damage capability.  Mind you that my opinion is based on<br/>\n&gt; talking with high level players (who have tried to convince me to dump my<br/>\n&gt; warrior) & from reading on the eqstratics site.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is an interesting thread on the eqstratics board (warriors)<br/>\n&gt; regarding the perceived lack of differentiation (or all out weakness) of<br/>\n&gt; our class at higher levels.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What does the rest of the list think?  Anyone have direct experience<br/>\n&gt; playing these classes at level 30+ & can compare HTH damage &<br/>\n&gt; effectiveness against critters?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rob Wilbarg  aka Flair in Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ** Original Subject: [warriors_eq] Rangers and warriors<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ** Original Sender: &quot;Tom Swift&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ** Original Date: Mon, 24 May 1999 12:26:45 -0400<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ** Original Message follows... <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This past week I decided to take a break from my level 15 dark elf<br/>\n&gt; warrior.  I was abit frustrated.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I started a half-elf warrior in Kelethin.  It is insanely easy to play<br/>\n&gt; there.  I made level 5 in about 3.5 hours.  Then I stopped and tried a<br/>\n&gt; wood elf ranger.  Has anyone else played a ranger?  I imagine it is the<br/>\n&gt; most poorly balanced of all the hybrids.  After 4 hours I reached level 5<br/>\n&gt; and got kick.  I am now 12-18 hours into the character and almost level 9.<br/>\n&gt; I am just as capable as an equivalent warrior.  Next level I gain an array<br/>\n&gt; of spells which will boost my combat effectiveness and allow me to heal.<br/>\n&gt; Part of the easy success is the plethora of low level orcs available a<br/>\n&gt; stone&#39;s throw from Kelethin.  With my tracking ability I am never at a<br/>\n&gt; loss for targets and I can engage blue con orcs in rapid succession or<br/>\n&gt; even 2 at a time. I can even engage and successfully beat yellow con orcs<br/>\n&gt; more than 50% of the time and almost always can kill orcs that con even to<br/>\n&gt; me without trouble. So far it seems that I get as many hit points now as<br/>\n&gt; my warrior did.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; My point is, with a ranger class as powerful a combatant as it is I see<br/>\n&gt; little necessity for the pure warrior.  I am going to play through to<br/>\n&gt; level 15 I think, just to see a more even comparison.  My concern is only<br/>\n&gt; from a game mechanics perspective though as I have no doubt my playing as<br/>\n&gt; a dark elf was a much more rewarding experience.  Has anyone else noticed<br/>\n&gt; that the warrior just is not different enough from the hybrid fighter<br/>\n&gt; classes?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bael                                                    Aelyn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Warrior of the 15th Order      or              Ranger of the 8th Rank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Indigo Brotherhood                                Humble Servant of<br/>\n&gt; Tunare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; still undecided<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;** --------- End Original Message ----------- **<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members? <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
