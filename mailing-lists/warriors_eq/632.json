I don&#39;t know how it<br/>\n&gt;is on all of your servers, but I play on Solusek Ro, and I&#39;m disgusted<br/>\n&gt;with the players and people on the server.  People charging 100 to over<br/>\n&gt;200 plat for a rare item.  In beta, an item rarely went over 20 plat, and<br/>\n&gt;if it did, by that time, you were in your mid twenties in level and could<br/>\n&gt;get it without a problem or could afford to pay for it. I am a level 19<br/>\n&gt;warrior and also have a level 19 druid, and i do NOT have 100 to 200 plat<br/>\n&gt;to spend on anything but the things to keep my character advancing.<br/>\n&gt;Spells for my druid and armor for my warrior.  Those people who do have<br/>\n&gt;that cash at early levels must have a LOT of time on their hands.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I got my char to almost level 20 in 6 days and 20 some hours.  This isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;that spectaular, but i fight to get experience and i fight well. I work<br/>\n&gt;full time and am also a full time student at a university. I do not have<br/>\n&gt;the time to run around and kill wisps or whatever people with big bank<br/>\n&gt;accounts do. The reason why i want to share the spawn information with you<br/>\n&gt;guys is because I hope you will help me in lowering the disgusting<br/>\n&gt;inflated prices of the game. Give items to players or sell them for cheap.<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s what I and some good members of my guild do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for reading and hopefully someone knows the info for the tomahawk.<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d really love to get one or two for my dual wield.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Nick<br/>\n&gt;Frizzan on Solusek Ro (Bloodstone Templars)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;See homepage for details.<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
