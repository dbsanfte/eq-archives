Some of you may not want to &gt;see this,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;but at gameznet.com/eq there is a new post about the &gt;success at duel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wielding and double attack.  With all these updates &gt;you guys<br/>\n&gt; would nonstop<br/>\n&gt; &gt;4 hit attack. Now, I see how as of right now &gt;the warrior are worse than<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the SKs, pallys, and rangers.  But if you &gt;do much to the<br/>\n&gt; warriors you guys<br/>\n&gt; &gt;will be able to blow us away.  I&#39;m &gt;a troll SK and my guys is mainly a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;warrior with a few spells.  If you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;do all these things you people have listed to the warrior class then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;warriors will be a super class, be reasonable.  Ask for some small<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;changes.  Not letting their skills increase at 6 a lvl and go<br/>\n&gt; up to &gt;300<br/>\n&gt; &gt;AND ask for weapon specialization.  A warrior would outdamage a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;gd WIZARD!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  You people are crazy if you except them to make that &gt;kind of change.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hehehehehehehe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hummm let&#39;s see.  If I hit 4 times in one round for, oh let&#39;s go<br/>\n&gt; for broke,<br/>\n&gt; say 25 points each [some super magic 1H sword from h*#l] = 100 points.<br/>\n&gt; Wizard with comet spell, one turn = 1500 points.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Geez, all we are asking for is wpn specialization and skill cap<br/>\n&gt; at 250 or so<br/>\n&gt; like the other classes already have in their unique skills.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Patricia of Halas<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; note: Verant has already made many changes early on in other classes.  Us<br/>\n&gt; warriors only waited until now to ask for a couple of small additions.<br/>\n&gt; Warriors will always have to group at higher levels, tis the<br/>\n&gt; nature of being<br/>\n&gt; a tank.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Attention ONElist list owners.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out the new &quot;DEFAULT MODERATED STATUS&quot; option.
