I could force my opponent to<br/>\nmake a mistake which would allow me to stab in the heart, or the neck, or<br/>\nstrike a severe blow to the head.  I could also use it at a time when I most<br/>\nneeded it, instead of relying on randomness to decide my fate.  A warriors<br/>\nskill should not be base on chance, but on actual usage, just like the<br/>\nrogues backstabbing skill.  Also trying to strike for a critcal hit would<br/>\nrender other attacks useless for the round (kick and bash).  Not only would<br/>\nthis be a balance issue, but more realistic in my opinion.  Have you ever<br/>\nseen to guys sword fighting and watch one guy kick at the same time he is<br/>\ntrying to stick him? :)    The damage x 2 is a little low however, in my<br/>\nopinion.  By using the skill level/2 algorithm,  you would actually be doing<br/>\nmore damage at the proper level.  At level 20, with your skill maxed at 100<br/>\n(the same level *5 + 5 formula) you would be doing a 50 point critical<br/>\nstrike.  At level 40, you would be doing a 100 point critical strike.  100<br/>\npoints against something that has 1500 is not that much.  Having the<br/>\nabilities go up like parry and dodge would make it too powerful I believe.<br/>\nThey go up without the need to use them.  By making it a skill that has to<br/>\nbe invoked, you are ensuring the user will use it when he knows he can fight<br/>\nthe creature and win.  I am still not maxed out in bash because the little 1<br/>\n- 7 points of damage I do isn&#39;t enough....I need the solid 11 I get with my<br/>\nkick : ).  No matter how they decide (and if they decide) to do it, I think<br/>\nit will help the warriors tremendously.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tTom Swift[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tMonday, June 14, 1999 10:26 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Warriors vs Hybrids<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Tom Swift&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The only point I would disagree on is that critical hit should be an<br/>\n&gt; automatic skill like dodge/parry.  The assumption being that the kick of<br/>\n&gt; bash could potentiall be the critical hit. As a warrior you are going to<br/>\n&gt; always try and do the most damage you can.  With &quot;critical hit&quot; skill it<br/>\n&gt; depends on how skilled you are is how often you succeed.  Kicking an orc<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; the gonads qualifies as a critical hit. Also, you said that you would<br/>\n&gt; &quot;know&quot;<br/>\n&gt; when the right time for a critical hit is.....how could you know that?  I<br/>\n&gt; am<br/>\n&gt; not sure what you mean by this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just to reiterate. I think the critical hit skill should be checked<br/>\n&gt; automatically against each and every strike.  The percentage chance for a<br/>\n&gt; critical hit is proportionate to the skill level.  It would be something<br/>\n&gt; like dodge/parry/riposte I think, though I am not sure how those checks<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; calculated.  The damage caused by this strike should be based on the<br/>\n&gt; weapon<br/>\n&gt; you are using, perhaps the damage rating x 2.  So a longsword would be 12<br/>\n&gt; points (6 dmg?) and a 2 handed sword would be 24 (12 dmg).  The end result<br/>\n&gt; of this skill is that warriors become the masters of melee.  We still will<br/>\n&gt; never do as much damage per round as a mage of the same level, but we will<br/>\n&gt; be more desirable as a melee class than the hybrids.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now that I have finally thought of a complete solution I am going to<br/>\n&gt; submit<br/>\n&gt; this is as feedback just to dispute all the proposals I don&#39;t agree with.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; will still participate in our petition of course, once we all agree on a<br/>\n&gt; solution.

I don&#39;t understand why<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;were negative about his entire post though...seems to me you were picking<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;apart, but that is just my opinion.  I do have a couple of points.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Taunt:  In my experience I have found that taunt works TOO well.  I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;taunted so much that a mob has stayed on me no matter what anyone else<br/>\n&gt; did,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;including the wizards high damage spell.  If taunt doesn&#39;t seem to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;working in your party, something is not right.  One thing.  The person<br/>\n&gt; doing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the fetching is usually at the top of the list.  If the wizard fetches<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;then hits it for a high damaged spell, its going to be tough to get it<br/>\n&gt; off<br/>\n&gt; &gt;him.  I suggest letting the warrior go out with a bow and pull something.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Even if you miss the creature will still come after you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Critical strike:  I actually sent in a feedback on this skill.  Here are<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;points I made<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1)  Make it a skill the player has to invoked.  The reasoning behind<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this is you will see an opportunity when you can hit the creature for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;more damage.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2)  Make it recyclable, akin to the rogues backstab.  You would not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;be able to critcally hit and kick or bash in the same round.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;            3)  Make it start at level 20, and only work with the first<br/>\n&gt; &gt;weapon skill that reaches the point of &#39;master&#39;.  This would resemble a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;specialization in that weapons category.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;            4) Damage:  Make damage akin to the rogues backstab,<br/>\n&gt; something<br/>\n&gt; &gt;like the skill divided by 2.  So that at level 20 you would get 20 points<br/>\n&gt; &gt;into critical strike.  On a successful strike, you would cause 10 points<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;damage.  When your skill is 60, you would be doing 30 damage for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;successful strike.  If peope think this is too much, start the skill at 1<br/>\n&gt; &gt;point instead of 20.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This one skill would go long in making the warrior more viable with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hybrid classes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Angarth, Warrior of the 17th Tier<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Periissem ni periisem&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: Andrew Palmer[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:apalmer@...\">apalmer@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Reply To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Friday, June 11, 1999 10:00 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Warriors vs Hybrids<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: Andrew Palmer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:apalmer@...\">apalmer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I would like to start this off by saying that this is not against you<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; all.

I don&#39;t have much of an issue<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; warriors vs wizards. They traded hps, ac, and melee ability for high<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dealing spells. However it appears I agree with many of you that is<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; hybrids that appear to have a distinct advantage over us. The hybrid<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that has<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the most advantage appears to be the ranger. For various reasons I<br/>\n&gt; find<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unable to group with the people I normally play with. I am unable to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; solo many<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mobs even in the blue and green range, and really I have more fun in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; groups. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have been traveling to many zones shouting that I am looking for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; group, but to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; no avail. It appears to me that many groups are prefering rangers<br/>\n&gt; over<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; warriors,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and after I read the post on EQ&#39;Lizer I began to realize why.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Advantages Warriors get over Rangers:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; - We get Dual Wield and Double Attack at 2 levels lower than Rangers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; but after<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a few levels they are back on par with us in the damage dealing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; department. So<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as Wayne Sheppard wrote, &quot;the Warrior has no skill advantage over the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; hybrids.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Your wrong on this 2 levels no.. Yes rangers get duel weild and double<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; attack but duel weild comes at level 17 and Double Attack Comes at<br/>\n&gt; level<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 20. I really never have had a problem with a ranger having this ability<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; let them have it more fun in the game. Not like rangers are master<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; casters.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -Warriors get more hit points. This only appears to be true for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; larger races<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and rangers easily overcome this by being able to heal themselves,<br/>\n&gt; thus<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; actually<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; taking more pressure off of the cleric to heal them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hrm well I have no idea what parties everyone travels with but the<br/>\n&gt; parties<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; i am with people buff me up also. So in turn yes i STILL do end up with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more Hit points<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -Berserker Frenzy. As it has been stated before, I see no real<br/>\n&gt; advantage<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; getting a strength boost and a dex penalty when I am close to dying.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rather not get hit more often when I am low on hp. It makes us die<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; much<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; quicker.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This i can agree with most of the time when you hit frenzy mode you are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; basically dead anyways<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Advantages Rangers have over Warriors:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -Rangers get foraging. Not much of advantage in combat, but they can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; help keep<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the party supplied with food without any mana cost. They can also<br/>\n&gt; carry<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; loot since they don&#39;t have to carry lots of food. They just forage on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; demand.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If you want foraging become a wood elf warrior. ALL wood elfs i belive<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have the foraging skill I know for fact wood elf warriors have forage.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -Rangers get Hiding and Sneak. This allows the rangers to live longer<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; because<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; they can avoid more of the deadlier Mobs that would target a warrior.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Again wood elf warriors have this also<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -Rangers get the very useful skill of Tracking. This is a great<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; advantage to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; groups because the rangers make the best fetches. They party can heal<br/>\n&gt; up<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rest adn stay organized while the rangers are out searching for prey.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This means<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the party spends less down time and can fight more.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Rangers should have tracking they are a ranger. And yes they can heal<br/>\n&gt; up<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; but their healing isnt the best in the game it only cuts downtime by a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -Rangers cast spells. They not only get some minor healing spells,<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; also are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; able to do root spells, direct damage spells, so they can kick,<br/>\n&gt; attack,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and cast<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; spells doing more damage than us. They also get spells that are<br/>\n&gt; useful<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; entire party like camoflage and SOW allowing the party to travel more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; safely.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ok boy i seem like a flamer but again. If you want spells play a ranger<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; warriors should not have spells. and as ranger spell damage. Look at<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; spells<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; level 9 - Flame lick (uhm more like lame lick) it does a whole WOPPING<br/>\n&gt; 5<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   points of damage. Boy that sure deals a lot<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Level 15 - Lighting. At level 15 it is a slower spell to cast it does<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    25 points of damage MAX. And it burns through mana quickly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; And we do get spells beyond this. As for camoflage well yes rangers<br/>\n&gt; should<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; be able to cast this spell seeing they are one of the best at knowing<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lands<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Changes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; - I like the idea of eliminating the skill cap of 200 and giving us a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bonus in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; combat related skills. I think it was 5*lvl +10 instead of 5*lvl +5.<br/>\n&gt; Or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; could eliminate the bonus the hybrids get, so they only get 5*lvl.<br/>\n&gt; This<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; allow a warrior of equal level to show a slight advantage over our<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; hybrid<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; brothers.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I dont think the cap should be eliminated but should be raised much of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that like the monk.. maybe the cap topping off at 240 or something<br/>\n&gt; where<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in the end they will deal more damage but not as much as a pure caster.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; - To make it more apparent that warriors excell at combat I think<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rangers should<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not get Double Attack. After all Verant stated that they hybrids gave<br/>\n&gt; up<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; something to get those spells and extra abilities. I don&#39;t see a<br/>\n&gt; problem<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dual Wield because many of us grew up with D&D&#39;s image of rangers<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wielding two<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; swords. If paladins appear to be struggling at later levels they<br/>\n&gt; might<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Double Attack to allow them to keep up with the rangers.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I do not agree with this at all. Let rangers have double attack sure it<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; seems unfair but Rangers do not have the all might god spell casting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ability of a pure spell caster. Look at rangers for a second and what<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; levels they get spells at. This is what gets annoying to me when people<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; this. Rangers have druid type damage spells. Rangers get the spells way<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; later when mob&#39;s end up being tougher to begin with. You people keep<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; blowing this spell stuff WAY out of the water.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -It&#39;s been stated that at higher levels that the casters are doing so<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; much<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; damage that we cannot Taunt the Mobs off of them. So I think that<br/>\n&gt; Taunt<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; should<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; be boosted at higher levels causing the Mobs to pay more attention to<br/>\n&gt; us<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; our job of keeping thier attention while the caster burn them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; That is the casters fault.. think about it for a second it seems like<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; keep jumping to conclusions. You have 500 hit points. Someone casts a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; spell on you and hits you for 100 points of damage. And another thing<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; hitting you for 40 points a round max. The person hitting you for 40<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; points says some naughty words at you. Who would you kill first? No<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; question I would kill the thing that is hitting me harder first. ITS<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; CALLED ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE. Taunt does work i have used it<br/>\n&gt; successfully<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; many of times. The part it seems to be going wrong is your dumb wizard<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; keeps casting 1 spell right after another. And i think that would piss<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; off a little bit more then someone saying a few bad words about my<br/>\n&gt; mother.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -I also really like the critical hit skill. It should be innate like<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Parry and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dodge. It would help us more of an asset to a party instead of a<br/>\n&gt; spell<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; casting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; warrior that can track like the rangers are now. They just seem to<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; many of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the same advantages we have and sacrificed nothing to get thier<br/>\n&gt; spells<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; tracking and other abilites.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Now this is something that SHOULD be done... maybe not a critical hit.<br/>\n&gt; How<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about this just think about it before you start flaming<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Warriors are the masters of fighting melee combat. They SHOULD know<br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; enemy and SHOULD know vital points of striking are. How about a random<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Vital Hit where it would come out of the blue sort of like the mob made<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mistake in an attempted hit at you but you dodge or miss because your<br/>\n&gt; read<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that attack and you used this to your KEEN ability and hit them in this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; open vital spot maybe for 1.5 to 2 times the normal damage. Even<br/>\n&gt; better..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; it doesnt start at level 1 or lvl 20. Maybe around level 25 or so you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; start to become a more knowledgable warrior being through the years and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; many fights. You become more masterable at fighting and you train in<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; skill with your leader and the better you raise in the skill the more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; often this vital hit will appear. The good points about this are it<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not WACK the balance out of the game. Warriors WILL indeed be the<br/>\n&gt; masters<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of fighting with this tactic. Warriors would be wanted WAY more by<br/>\n&gt; groups<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; because of this nice little ability. I think everyone would not mind it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; due to the fact that it is not a HUGE ability but it is something that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; will distinguish your warrior from ANY other class. Now all of you are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; probably saying ONLY 1.5 to 2X DAMAGE?!!?! LAME. well if you say this<br/>\n&gt; then<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you most likly arent thinking so let me explain why only that much.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I carry a nice 2 handed sword. (shows nice weapon)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I hit for a maximum of 25 dmg lets say.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 1.5X that would be about 43 dmg in 1 swing? wow i like that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 2X dmg that would be 50 DMG in 1 swing with only a 2h sword. NICE<br/>\n&gt; damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; but not WAY out of control.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The damage could vary on armor the mob is wearing seeing as yes that<br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; soak up some damage.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I would love to hear anyones flames or cheers for this idea.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; KLAEN<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Deadline is June 19.
