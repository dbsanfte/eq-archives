Geez, what do you expect?  What<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This just leads to more in-game crap.  This kind of<br/>\n&gt;thing almost makes me wish +PVP was the required<br/>\n&gt;setting (almost, but not quite; because reality in<br/>\n&gt;other games proves people will just use PC Killing as<br/>\n&gt;a source of amusement and bullying, and not a serious<br/>\n&gt;in-game mechanism).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have no problem with someone camping to obtain an<br/>\n&gt;item.  Key word here, *one*.  They show up, wait their<br/>\n&gt;turn, get their item, move on.  In this fashion, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;like an amusement park ride, everyone takes a turn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Camping to get multiples is just lame.  Very, very,<br/>\n&gt;very, very lame.  It takes away the fun in a very<br/>\n&gt;serious way.  I can&#39;t compete for the commonly<br/>\n&gt;mentioned items because the hard-core &#39;see if I let<br/>\n&gt;you get one before I and my friends kill-steal it away<br/>\n&gt;from you while we laugh&#39; groups are determined to set<br/>\n&gt;up and hold the spot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m probably going to have to pay plat for items I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;like my character to have, which really takes a lot of<br/>\n&gt;the fun out of it.  A lot of the fun.  It would be<br/>\n&gt;*fun* to go adventuring, fight through the dungeon,<br/>\n&gt;find the spot/npc everyone rumors as the source of a<br/>\n&gt;mighty item, and then defeat him/her/it in battle for<br/>\n&gt;a great reward.  That would be *fun*.  But strolling<br/>\n&gt;through the dungeon that people are keeping cleared,<br/>\n&gt;finding a huge crowd anxiously waiting for the npc to<br/>\n&gt;arrive; that&#39;s *not fun*.  Especially when they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;rude and irritated that I dare have the nerve to want<br/>\n&gt;to come and get an item for myself, which is what the<br/>\n&gt;response almost always is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Worse, it&#39;s certainly not fun to buy it.  I probably<br/>\n&gt;will, but it&#39;s not going to be the same at all.  Not<br/>\n&gt;at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;One of two things needs to happen; Uber monster spawns<br/>\n&gt;need to be instituted (like SGs in NRo and Oasis, or<br/>\n&gt;the Mino Hero in Steamfont) that will make farmers pay<br/>\n&gt;with XP and blood for their patches, or hard coded<br/>\n&gt;&#39;lore&#39; item limits.  And if this makes it hard to get<br/>\n&gt;a paired set of PG Tomahawks, tough.  We tried it the<br/>\n&gt;nice way, and it&#39;s not working; so you&#39;ll just have to<br/>\n&gt;use one PGT and one of something else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;===<br/>\n&gt;:D<br/>\n&gt;       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n&gt;-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&gt;&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\n&gt;believe it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;First Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n&gt;_________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today.<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
