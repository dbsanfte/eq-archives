This class is amazing.  If<br/>\nyou think all they do is heal, you are very very wrong.  Their dd&#39;s do stun<br/>\n(amazing for rogues) and they can heal better than any other class.  I want<br/>\nto see your two druids heal you to full from 1 bar of life<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if all you fight is yellows and reds you need to rethink your leveling<br/>\nprocess.  Whites and blues are excellent to fight if you are in groups that<br/>\nhandle large numbers well.  Before you say all clerics do is heal, play one,<br/>\nor play with a good one.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
