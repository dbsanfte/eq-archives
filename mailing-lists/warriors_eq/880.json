I have never hit for more<br/>\n&gt; than that even with my skill maxxed.  I max all my weapons skills at every<br/>\n&gt; level so far.  Within minutes of reaching level 10 I started hitting for<br/>\n&gt; 25.<br/>\n&gt; I am not complaining of course.   However, if this is a damage bonus based<br/>\n&gt; on level I am disturbed because we are talking about a ranger not a<br/>\n&gt; warrior.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My max damage on my warrior hasn&#39;t changed at all up to level 15. Still<br/>\n&gt; hit<br/>\n&gt; for a max of 17 with a mino axe, 11 with a combine scimitar and 8 with a<br/>\n&gt; tentacle whip.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jeff Auman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff.auman@...\">jeff.auman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thursday, May 27, 1999 6:10 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Updated: Rangers and Warriors<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Jeff Auman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff.auman@...\">jeff.auman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Tom Swift wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This might have something to do with the patch this week so I am going<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to log in as my warrior tonight and experiment.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This is the fact.  My Fine steel 2 handed sword has a damage of 12 and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; delay of 43.  I normally hit for 21 damage with it.  2 days ago I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bought a purity belt boosting my str from 80 to 82.  I did not notice<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; any damage change.  Last night within minutes of levelling up to 10 I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; started hitting for max damage of 25.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Any one know anything about this?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Interesting, but I think your base assumption might be wrong.  The two<br/>\n&gt; &gt;weapons I use had a base damage of 8 and 6. (Mino axe, and tomahawk).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I had a max damage of 17 and 13 (2xbase + 1) on each respectively.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;If you are hitting for 25, I would think this fits right in line<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with the 2xbase +1 formula.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am more curious as to why you weren&#39;t hitting for max potential<br/>\n&gt; &gt;previously.  Were you burdened?  Perhaps at only 80 STR you had a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;penalty?  Perhaps a bug was fixed and you now are hitting for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;correct damage.  The most likely thing though I can think of is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was your weapon skill for the 2H slash maxed for your level?  When<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve been practicing recently, I almost never hit for max with my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2H slash, but it is significantly below max (like 20 out of 95).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Btw, I&#39;m an 18th Barbarian warrior, STR of 120.  So perhaps the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;comparison isn&#39;t quite fair.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-Jeff<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-Jeff Auman<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jauman@...\">jauman@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Are you?
