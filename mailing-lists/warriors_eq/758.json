He conned red to me at level 20.  He<br/>\nhas a harm touch of 350hp. He always comes with an entourage when pulled.  I<br/>\nwas in a level 25 party when we killed him, and our lead tank (a ranger)<br/>\nnearly died in the battle (he had a slither of red left).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I am VERY interested in the SoW ring.  Only item that does the same<br/>\nthing this ring you mentioned does, that I know off, are the journey man<br/>\nboots.  Looking at getting these with a level 30 party. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tDean Boyle[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gino_14@...\">gino_14@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tWednesday, May 26, 1999 4:45 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Armor<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Dean Boyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gino_14@...\">gino_14@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure couse I&#39;m getting a few from some Guild Members but If ican <br/>\n&gt; recall he&#39;s hunting some tuff little critters in Unrest at lvl 13<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
