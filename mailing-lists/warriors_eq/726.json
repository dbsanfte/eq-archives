So lets concider where all you would have to go to look for this item<br/>\n<br/>\nKaranas- could be any of the griffins or giants<br/>\noasis-could be one of the spectres or giants<br/>\ns ro-could be on one of the giants<br/>\ne commons-could be on a griffin<br/>\nw commons-could be on a giant or griffin<br/>\ncazic thule-could be on any number of monsters there<br/>\nmistmoore-could be on any number of monsters there<br/>\nsoulsekB-could be on any number of monsters there<br/>\nbefallen-it could conceivably spawn on commander windstream<br/>\n<br/>\nso would it make since to go to all these places to look for a particular item, or would you just find a pretty safe place to camp and wait to see what item spawned on one of the creatures that you are camping?  I would think your odds of finding &quot;random&quot; items like this would be equal if you camped one spot, or if you traveled to various zones.  Doesn&#39;t seem like this would promote adventuring.  And it would take FOREVER to actually get an item you want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Jynxx&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jynxx@...\">Jynxx@...</a>&gt; 5.25.99 3:11:43 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Jynxx&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jynxx@...\">Jynxx@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYES!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\nThat&#39;s what we need! A random item spawn.....I&#39;ll even take it one step<br/>\nfurther:<br/>\nLets say that said sword is on a level 45 person...so we&#39;ll call that a<br/>\n&#39;level 45 item&#39; it can then spawn to any level 45+ NPC in all of the zone,<br/>\nor even norrath. That would make people have to travel A LOT to find items<br/>\nthey want, and would completely prevent camping for items altogether. That<br/>\nway if you really wanted an item bad enough, your group had to go search for<br/>\nit...not just sit sround and wait for it....that to me is not even<br/>\nrole-playing.<br/>\nJust my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nTyveris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking to expand your world?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\nONElist has over 150,000 e-mail communities from which to chose!<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
