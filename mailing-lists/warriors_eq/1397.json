If you can give him belts & shoulderpads it certainly will help your faction.  Perhaps your mage friends (if you&#39;ve got them) might be willing to root the fellow or use some other creative magical solution to save your bacon (I have no idea how high a level he is either).  This solution is a pure brainstorm on my part.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well I suppose this will be all trial and error and in many ways that is what makes the game fun.  Imagine how happy you&#39;ll be if it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ** Original Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] kos<br/>\n&gt; ** Original Sender: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mallachyte@...\">Mallachyte@...</a><br/>\n&gt; ** Original Date: Tue, 29 Jun 1999 16:05:01 EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ** Original Message follows... <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mallachyte@...\">Mallachyte@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you becove visable when you give the dwarf the belts?  I would love to get <br/>\n&gt; my Dark Elf in there and do that.  Right now, all guards from the boat to the <br/>\n&gt; front gates of Kaladim regard me warmly, and after that, it&#39;s KOS all the way <br/>\n&gt; to the zone to Greater Faydark.  Is there another thing that needs killing to <br/>\n&gt; make the dwarves around there like me?  I lost over 1 bubble and level 14 <br/>\n&gt; because I thought that the dwarves liked me, then one just killed me.  No <br/>\n&gt; chance to run far enough away, so I had to go back to Faydwer from the South <br/>\n&gt; Gate of Freeport.  Got there, tried to use /corpse, but it was too far away, <br/>\n&gt; got closer and the dwarf killed me again.  Back in Freeport.  Took the boat <br/>\n&gt; again, got the first body back.  Got an invis, used /corpse command over and <br/>\n&gt; over to drag it.  Accidentally right clicked corpse.  Became visable, killed <br/>\n&gt; again.  One more time on the boat, and I finally got my stuff back.  So, if <br/>\n&gt; there is any way that I can give the dwarf the belts without being by it, I <br/>\n&gt; would really, really appreciate the info.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;** --------- End Original Message ----------- **<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
