I am level 21 and they are blue to white to me.  My friend, a<br/>\nlevel 30 ranger was helping me raise my 2handed skill (I just got a BBC)<br/>\nwith the TT.  He would draw them out (they are green to him) and take all<br/>\nthe blows.  They would consistently reduce him to one bubble and myself to<br/>\nhalf my hit points. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe day before they were a piece of cake, now there killing machines.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey seem to have changed the linking also with the bonecracker.  It used to<br/>\nbe you could pull the BC and the two necros would not come (as long as they<br/>\nwere green to the puller).  Now they all come no matter what.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND finally blind spell pulling no longer works either.  If you target a<br/>\nmob, then run to another room (i.e. the mob cant see you) you could cast a<br/>\nspell and the mob would come running.  This no longer works.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I would share that with you all.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
