And at 8, you can play<br/>\nyour lute to enhance the healing process.<br/>\n�<br/>\nSo, I hope that piques your interest in bards -<br/>\n�<br/>\nSnyak.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Elena Glenn [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:braveheart@...\">braveheart@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 09, 1999 3:19 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [warriors_eq] Wood Elf Bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have recently started a Wood Elf Bard character, and I was wondering if<br/>\nanyone had any hints on playing her.� I am level 2, and have bought the<br/>\nfirst two spells.� I bought a mandolin and a lute, and have no idea how to<br/>\nuse them.� Perhaps this comes at a later level?� Any ideas would be greatly<br/>\nappreciated.<br/>\n�<br/>\nLeri<br/>\nXegony Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
