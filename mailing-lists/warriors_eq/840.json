All the items that i<br/>\nhave obtained, I have gotten them with my guildmates at my side during<br/>\nbattle. It is people like that, those twinked level 13 chars, that make me<br/>\nSO frustrated because i cannot even get a goddamn tomahawk axe. I&#39;m level<br/>\ntwenty now, and have been trying with my group to get a tomahawk axe since<br/>\nlevel 17. Back then i needed the group to be able to kill the gnoll.  Now<br/>\ni am able to do it solo if i was ever given the chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been reading all the ideas for what verant should do, and this is<br/>\nwhat i think.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake all items LORE, so you can only have on in your possesion and in<br/>\nbank.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake all rare items level specific. If the monster is more than lets say 4<br/>\nlevels above you and your party, you cannot obtain or use the specific<br/>\nitem.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake all rare items class specidifc, similar to LORE. No offense to<br/>\ncasters, but i&#39;m sick and itred of casters getting warrior only items<br/>\nSPECIFICALLY to sell them to us. Bullshit.<br/>\n<br/>\nNick</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
