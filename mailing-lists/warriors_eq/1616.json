And<br/>\nwhether or not your looking for some specific kinds of loot.  But my<br/>\nfavorite place of all time from all my levels was Cazic Thule.  Nothing like<br/>\npulling from the maze to your waiting group for the slaughter.  XP was very<br/>\ngood, and the downtown was non existent providing you had a well rounded<br/>\ngroup with casters that know what they are doing.  You could non-stop pull 2<br/>\nto 4 bluw/white/yellow out of the maze and just haul in the loot/xp.  Its<br/>\nalso imho one of the best zones to hunt in cause its outdoors which allows<br/>\nSoW to be used.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if I had to put together a where to hunt for what levels list it would<br/>\nlook something like this.<br/>\n<br/>\n1-5 Definitely Everfrost Peaks.  The loot for low levels is the best in the<br/>\ngame.  Plus there is absolutely NO shortage of things to kill.<br/>\n6 to 12 Misty Thicket.  Good xp, relatively safe, lots to kill.  I wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthat fond of the loot tho.<br/>\n13 to 15 Beholders Maze.  Good xp, good loot.  Downside is its very<br/>\ndangerous.<br/>\n16 to 22 Unrest.  Great loot, good xp.  Bad side again is trains, and very<br/>\ndangerous.<br/>\n22 to 35 definitely Cazic Thule.  Cant beat the xp or the loot of this place<br/>\nfor this level.<br/>\n36 and up.  This is a toss up.  I think I preferred solb due to the ease of<br/>\nescape if you get into trouble.  The loot is hands down some of the best in<br/>\nthe game.  Xp can be made pretty non stop here as well if you get into the<br/>\nright groups.  My second choice would be lower guk of course.  This place is<br/>\ngreat loot again, great xp as well.  But very dangerous cause your usually<br/>\ndeep in the dungeon when things go bad with no way or chance in hell or<br/>\nrunning to a zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor stories, yeah I have lots =)  I don&#39;t typically share them tho... would<br/>\ntake a lot of effort for me to write them down in an entertaining fashion.<br/>\nAnd since I am probably one of the worlds worse writters......  I might take<br/>\nsome time someday to see what I can do for you tho =)<br/>\n<br/>\nDaks<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tMark Davis [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mdavis@...\">mdavis@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tTuesday, November 23, 1999 11:26 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRE: [warriors_eq] Greetings<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Mark Davis&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mdavis@...\">mdavis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDaks,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the reply. Im sorry to hear that the list is really slow, but Im<br/>\nnot surprised.  With so many people, like yourself, achieving the upper<br/>\nlevels information is abundant in-game.  I guess what Im most interested in<br/>\nis hearing from people like yourself who might have a story, a suggestion, a<br/>\npitfall to avoid, a strategy, a nice area to hunt, etc etc.  As a 47th<br/>\nWarrior I imagine you have seen just about all there is to see and do across<br/>\nNorrath.  Id love to share your adventures, what suggestions you might have<br/>\nfor those higher level hunts and adventures.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for the reply,<br/>\n<br/>\nThoren & Co.<br/>\nThe Norrath Adventuring Co.<br/>\nRathe<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
