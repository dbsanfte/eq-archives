For example, Im level 16 wielding either a Dwarven 2Hand Axe<br/>\n(best 2hander up until SBH you can get it off Lord Darish in Crushbone) or a<br/>\nCombine LongSword and Tentacle Whip. Most of the time, I hit for 28, 29, 30<br/>\nwith the Dwarven 2Hander, but occasionally, I hit for somewhere in the range of<br/>\n1-10. Personally I think that sucks. Now, what if Verant were to give Warriors<br/>\na minumum amount of damage they could do? For example, this Dwarven 2Hander is<br/>\n14dmg 43delay. It would be nice if we could never hit for below 14 with this<br/>\nitem. Also, a Combine LS is 6dmg 28delay, so we could never hit for below 6<br/>\nwith the Combine LS.<br/>\n<br/>\n     I think this is a reasonable idea and in some cases would be better than<br/>\n5-10 damage extra. Just think, NEVER hitting for 1 damage again. I personally<br/>\nthink in a realistic sense, a big Barbarian Warrior with 130STR wielding a huge<br/>\nDwarven 2Hander hitting something for 1 damage is kind of pitiful. What do you<br/>\nall think?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Gaidal Cain<br/>\nMedieval Bulldozer<br/>\nBarbarian Warrior of the 16th Tier, Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
