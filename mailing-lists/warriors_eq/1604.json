Im sorry to hear that the list is really slow, but Im<br/>\nnot surprised.  With so many people, like yourself, achieving the upper<br/>\nlevels information is abundant in-game.  I guess what Im most interested in<br/>\nis hearing from people like yourself who might have a story, a suggestion, a<br/>\npitfall to avoid, a strategy, a nice area to hunt, etc etc.  As a 47th<br/>\nWarrior I imagine you have seen just about all there is to see and do across<br/>\nNorrath.  Id love to share your adventures, what suggestions you might have<br/>\nfor those higher level hunts and adventures.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for the reply,<br/>\n<br/>\nThoren & Co.<br/>\nThe Norrath Adventuring Co.<br/>\nRathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
