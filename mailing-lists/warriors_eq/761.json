I am the main person doing this and Ill try to cut out one line<br/>\nnon-sensical posts completely out.  I will also begin to trim the giant<br/>\nemails as well.  I will also check to see if someone has answered the<br/>\nquestion or made a comment I was going to make from now on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the main reason you will see lots of posts from me in a row is that<br/>\nI live in a different time zone.  When you guys are asleep im at work<br/>\nreading the list.  Therefore when you wake up in the morning you will see<br/>\nlots of emails from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThats not an excuse but one of the reasons why you will see a lot of emails<br/>\nfrom me in one chunk and then none for a 24 hour stint.  Ill try and cut<br/>\nback, but I really like this list and perhaps I get to excited when replying<br/>\n:)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
