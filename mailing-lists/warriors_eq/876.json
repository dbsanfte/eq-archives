A small suit can cost from 300p to 350p.  Also, I bought a Symbol of loyalty to Vox Bracer for 20p!  I found out that is twice as good as a Steel Plate one.  Nonetheless, I am selling it because in a while it will probally be common.  People have offered 400p and more for it!  Talk about profit.  I have just gotten dual wield, what should I use, I am thinking of buying two combine LS&#39;s, to replace my Dwarven 2H axe.  Should I?  Also, could two Tentacle whips be better than two combine LS&#39;s?  Well, Can anyone tell me what 1H slashing weapons I should get, I have about 400p now. )<br/>\n<br/>\n    Dubas,<br/>\nMithaniel Marr.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
