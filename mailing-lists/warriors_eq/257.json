I know at level one theres<br/>\nnot much difference between the standard stamina and a bumped up stamina,<br/>\nbut as the levels progress theres a BIG difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample compare your vanilla troll warrior and vanilla barbarian warrior.<br/>\nAt level 20 the troll will have aprox 780hp at level 22 the barbarian will<br/>\nhave aprox 666hp.  Im taking this information from 2 people I know.  So<br/>\nobviously the higher natural stamina does really affect hp over time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo has anyone figured out a ration? Or any word from Verant how it actually<br/>\nworks?  At the moment all we have (which is fine) is that more stamina =<br/>\nmore hp at HIGHER levels.  The higher the levels become the greater the<br/>\ndivergence.<br/>\n<br/>\nWonder if people would mind telling us there stamina, level and hp?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy character has a stamina of 75 and at level 18 she has exactly 500hp.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
