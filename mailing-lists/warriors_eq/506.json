I nearly always start with Jade","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1652710071\">I ALWAYS have two characters in every RPG game I have ever played Solomani<br/>\nthe Knight and jade (or Jayde or Jaade) the duelist.<br/>\n<br/>\nI nearly always start with Jade but end up switching to solomani for a the<br/>\nlong haul.  I also always end up liking solomani better.<br/>\n<br/>\nReasons I like to play a female, being a guy;<br/>\n<br/>\n1) They look good and are nice to watch.<br/>\n2) I find it easier RPG&#39;ing a female then a male, maybe its because I am<br/>\nimitating what I have seen and not reflecting what I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso when I play a male the real me tends to come out a LOT more than with a<br/>\nfemale.  This isn&#39;t always bad but it can be if you are playing an evil<br/>\nmale.  Its easier to RPG when you are forced to think about everything you<br/>\nsay and do, I see the character graphic as prism that distorts the light of<br/>\nmy personality. Sounds weird, but thats what 15 years of RPG does to ya ;).<br/>\n<br/>\n3) My fianc� plays the character (its a shared character) no where near as<br/>\nmuch as me, but she does play Jaade.  This adds to the multiple<br/>\npersonality/erratic nature idea I like to do with Jaade.  I think (as does<br/>\nmy fianc�) its kind of weird for her to play a male (but O.K. for me to play<br/>\na female ... go figure).  We usually never tell our in game companions we<br/>\nhave switched so dont assume its a guy steering Jaade if you ever meet her.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) ITS A FANTASY game.  Its not real.  Dont assume because guys play girls<br/>\nthat suddenly there transvestites or anything.  Pickup any comic book, all<br/>\nthe female based ones are written and drawn by guys, are they &quot;gay&quot; as well?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tJason Coan[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tThursday, May 20, 1999 5:59 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Good to see...good to see<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Speaking of women.....There is one big question I have.....why do guys<br/>\n&gt; play girl characters....some say they are role playing.....do they also<br/>\n&gt; dress up in womens close and role play women in real life?  or is &quot;role<br/>\n&gt; playing&quot; a female the first step towards role playing a real life female?<br/>\n&gt; I know there are a lot of legitimate female players, but I&#39;d bet a large<br/>\n&gt; sum of money that most of the female characters are being driven by<br/>\n&gt; guys.....call me homophobic if you will, but I think its weird.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a>&gt; 5.19.99 12:47:10 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a> <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hail,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It was good to see another of the female gender with a passion for<br/>\n&gt; slashin an bashing!<br/>\n&gt; Currently on a mission to get my four bubbles for dual attack and dual<br/>\n&gt; weild *snickers*.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *grumbles*<br/>\n&gt; gotta take care of some RL stuff so I can hunt.. hunt..hunt<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Azlana, Barbarian Warrior of Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What was YOUR favorite part?!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; Tell other Star Wars fans at ONElist!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
