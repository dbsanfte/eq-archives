I guess you really can&#39;t fight ignorance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are quite a few reasons to play a female character, although admittedly <br/>\nthey are all matters of taste.  First off, many of the female figures look <br/>\nmuch better than the male ones (I say that partly because I&#39;m a guy who likes <br/>\nthe look of a woman).  Secondly, who&#39;s to say that females can&#39;t be just as <br/>\nmuch an action/adventure hero as much as a male?  Myself and several friends <br/>\nof mine all have female characters in our rosters because sometimes one gets <br/>\ntired of running all male characters all the time.  Female characters should <br/>\nhave the chance to represent just like anybody else.  Thirdly, the decision <br/>\nto play a female is no different from any other character generation choice.  <br/>\nWhy did you decide to play that dark elf, or human, or barbarian?  Why did <br/>\nyou decide to play that warrior, or enchanter, or shadowknight?  Because you <br/>\nthought you&#39;d try something new, right?  Does playing a wizard mean that you, <br/>\nin real life, practice magic spells?  Of course not.  Does playing an orge <br/>\nmean, in real life, you wish you were an 8-foot tall ugly and monsterous <br/>\nhumanoid?  I certainly hope not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; I know there are a lot of legitimate female players, but I&#39;d bet a large<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; sum of money that most of the female characters are being driven by<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; guys.....call me homophobic if you will, but I think its weird.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well of course!  Duh!  I bet that most of the players in Norrath are male, <br/>\nperiod, regardless of what they play!  In general, computer games and <br/>\nrole-playing games have much more of a draw for men than they do for women.  <br/>\nEver go to a game store with open space for gaming?  How many women do you <br/>\nsee hanging out compared to the guys?<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, be aware that I&#39;m not attempting to change your opinion.  You play <br/>\nwhat you like to play and that&#39;s great.  I just think you should be more <br/>\nopen-minded and relax.  It is just a game, after all.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
