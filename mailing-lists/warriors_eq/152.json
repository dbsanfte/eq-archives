Assess if he<br/>\n&gt; needs help by looking at the difference in hp - this may be the 2nd or 3rd<br/>\n&gt; mob he has been fighting and even though it&#39;s a scrawny, he maybe low on<br/>\n&gt; hp<br/>\n&gt; and would like some help.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BB is where some people go for loot - others go there for the high MD.<br/>\n&gt; There are usually lots of kills laying around free for anyone to loot.<br/>\n&gt; And<br/>\n&gt; even some dead guards and elites just laying there waiting for the looters<br/>\n&gt; time to expire.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If someone gets so bad with insults, I just go: &quot;don&#39;t make me /ignore<br/>\n&gt; you!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Snyak.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; \t\tFrom:\tschlaban yocksovik [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anonymaste@...\">anonymaste@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; \t\tSent:\tMonday, May 17, 1999 9:02 AM<br/>\n&gt; \t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; \t\tSubject:\tRe: [warriors_eq] A question on kill<br/>\n&gt; stealing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tFrom: &quot;schlaban yocksovik&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anonymaste@...\">anonymaste@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\twell if you saw the person that was hackin the mob die and<br/>\n&gt; you took over its <br/>\n&gt; \t\tyour kill.<br/>\n&gt; \t\tAnd as far as im concerned, bb is a special case.<br/>\n&gt; \t\tThe trains in there are worse then any other area I have<br/>\n&gt; ever seen.<br/>\n&gt; \t\tThere are so many mobs there that if one gets killed or<br/>\n&gt; stolen its often not <br/>\n&gt; \t\tdone with evil intentions but done to help someone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tYes most damage always count.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tDepending on class I would come up with a nifty comment.<br/>\n&gt; \t\tingame insults always work<br/>\n&gt; \t\tooc insults though is something I realy dont like.<br/>\n&gt; \t\tI would have just insulted him for being <br/>\n&gt; \t\tshort/skinny/tall/ugly/weak/archmage wannabee, just<br/>\n&gt; anything.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\ttake care<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tVashi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;From: Kelly Pruett &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pruett@...\">pruett@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;I&#39;ve been a roleplayer and a mudder for years now. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; come to EQ like<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;most of us, with a lot of experience in multiplayer gaming.<br/>\n&gt; Now, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;fairly new to EQ (level 8) but I thought I had a good<br/>\n&gt; understanding of<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;it, and it&#39;s unwritten rules, until now.<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;The other night I was in BlackBurrow in a small group of 3.<br/>\n&gt; Two of us<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;were at the bottom level, and I was up top, returning from<br/>\n&gt; a town run. I<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;saw a gnoll guardsman kill someone, so I ran up to take<br/>\n&gt; charge of it.<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;There was nobody else around it. After a few hits it fled<br/>\n&gt; to the lower<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;level with me chasing it every step, hacking and kicking.<br/>\n&gt; Upon reaching<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;the lower level, there was a mini train already down there,<br/>\n&gt; but both me,<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;and the members of my group, were working on the gnoll<br/>\n&gt; guardsman I had<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;chased down. Towards the end of the fight, a fighter type<br/>\n&gt; of some sort<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;walked up and took the final swing on the guardsman.<br/>\n&gt; Thinking I had done<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;it ( I had to scroll back to look afterward) I bent over<br/>\n&gt; and looted the<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;corpse.<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;The fighter started complaining at once that I was a kill<br/>\n&gt; stealer and I<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;took his loot. I explained to him that I had chased the<br/>\n&gt; monster down,<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;and had done the most damage, and therefore the computer<br/>\n&gt; LET me take my<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;kill. He respnded that HE had chased the monster down from<br/>\n&gt; the top (I<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;never even saw anyone up top but myself) and had made the<br/>\n&gt; kill therefore<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;it wasn&#39;t mine to take. I didn&#39;t feel like the argument was<br/>\n&gt; worth it so<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;I gave up and tried to trade him the loot. He would not<br/>\n&gt; accept, but<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;instead complained to me via tells that he couldn&#39;t believe<br/>\n&gt; I did that.<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;My questions are:<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;1.) Was I ethically wrong to take the loot?<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;2.) Does the game only allow the majority damage dealer to<br/>\n&gt; take the<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;loot, or the final swinger?<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;3.) How would you guys deal with this situation?<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;Thanks for any advice ....<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;-Faderic of Qeynos (Ellorisi Marr server)<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;Congratulations to &quot;Trail Rider,&quot; our latest ONElist of the<br/>\n&gt; Week.<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is<br/>\n&gt; changing YOUR life!<br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; \t\tONElist:  bringing the world together.<br/>\n&gt; \t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; \t\tJoin a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; \t\tFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members? <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
