Now here&#39;s my addition to the hotkey discussion. Socials. I use<br/>\nemotes and socials a lot, so I decided to try something. On your main EQ<br/>\nscreen (without pushing F10) there are some menus on the lower right. The<br/>\none to look at is &#39;socials&#39;. The menu is filled with all kinds of boring<br/>\nsocials &#39;afk&#39; is one, &#39;hail&#39; and &#39;wave&#39; are others. Well what I did was<br/>\nerase them and write my own. If you edit your socials, you can add about 6<br/>\nlines of commands like a macro. I use it to hail a traveller in a different<br/>\nway, by introducing myself. So the edited social looks like this:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hail<br/>\n&gt; /say I am Jynxx, officer to the Council Of Grey.<br/>\n&gt; /say If there is anything I can do to assist you, just ask!<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then I name that something like &#39;intro&#39; and make a hotkey for it. By editing<br/>\nsocials you can do anything that you can command to do. Just for another<br/>\nexample, I have one that tells me who in my guild is online. I have it so<br/>\nthat it reads:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; /who council of grey all<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have that bound to Hotkey 3 Page 1. I just thought I&#39;d share with you guys<br/>\nwhat I think is a great use for hotkeys, especially if you roleplay a lot.<br/>\nTo me that&#39;s what this list is about, and I have definetly gained a wealth<br/>\nof knowledge from all of you.
