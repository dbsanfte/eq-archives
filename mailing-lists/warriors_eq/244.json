I am a<br/>\n&gt; little over a bubble away from� 16 and my skills are now 65 for dual wield<br/>\n&gt; and 72 for double attack.� My rate of advancement has slowed considerably,<br/>\n&gt; I am wondering if I should expect to max these at 80 before I hit 16 or if<br/>\n&gt; that is uncommon.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; If I can max them I will likely get myself killed right before i level up<br/>\n&gt; in order to buy some more time at 15.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; By the way I am using a combine scimitar and tentacle whip against magical<br/>\n&gt; opponents and dual mino axes against non-magical opponents.� My max damage<br/>\n&gt; per round is 79, that is double attacks on both weapons with max<br/>\n&gt; damage(17) and a max damage kick (11).� <br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; And in reference to others questions about faction.� It is easy enough to<br/>\n&gt; gain enough faction for the Commonlands vendors to deal with you, just<br/>\n&gt; kill orcs by the dozens.� I kill every orc I see, pawns, centurions and so<br/>\n&gt; on.� You can get Freeport residents to deal with you by completing the orc<br/>\n&gt; slashed belt quest repeatedly.� If you do that tho you faction with the<br/>\n&gt; Paladins in North Freeport will get worse.� It is up to you whether West<br/>\n&gt; and east freeport are more important to you then North Freeport<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Bael<br/>\n&gt; 15th Order<br/>\n&gt; Indigo Brotherhood<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
