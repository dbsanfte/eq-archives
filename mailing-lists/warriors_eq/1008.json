First the bad news:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere we were... camping the Undead ruin in East Commons - why we have no<br/>\nclue (no loot and no xp either.)  Then the 2 ghouls spawn so we ooc for some<br/>\nhelp and a dwarvin pallidin or maybe cleric joins the party.  We melee the<br/>\nghouls and in the midst of combat this pallidin/cleric loots the first<br/>\nghoul.  We kill the second one and the cleric immediately says &quot;got to go&quot;<br/>\nand disbands.  Not 5 minutes later he is auctioning off a bronze sword.  I<br/>\ngive him a tell and he confirms it was off the ghoul.  Talk about an a-hole.<br/>\nHis name is &quot;gander&quot; and it was on the Innoruuk server.  If a hill giant is<br/>\never chasing you, be sure to run right up to &#39;gander&#39; and ask for a heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the good part:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere we were... formed a party and we head off to camp the dervs in North<br/>\nRo.  When we get the camp by the mountains, we see another group working it.<br/>\nSo, we ask them if we can have a turn and wait for our turn.  Things are<br/>\nworking good each crew taking turns and actually glad for the rest and heal<br/>\ntime between turns.  So then the other group leaves for food and drink and<br/>\nto sell stuff.  Turns out there was another guy hanging out there and he is<br/>\nlike a 15 or so cleric (we are 10&#39;s and 12&#39;s warrior, bard and pallie.)  He<br/>\nasks us if he can help by lulling so we can pull dervs out one by one.  Wow!<br/>\nSure thing!  So he does and casts heals and such as we need it.  We take<br/>\nsome turns with him but mostly he says he just wants to help us.  So this<br/>\ngoes on for long enough for us to fill loots 2 times and run to sell and<br/>\ncome back.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally he says he has to go help his guild mate and we work the camp for a<br/>\nwhile.  Eventually, we get a 3 spawn and they all con yellow to our highest<br/>\nparty member.  So we give our friend a tell and he is kind enough to come<br/>\nback and help us!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo for all the bad times you have in Norrath - hang in there because you are<br/>\nbound to hit some good times as well!  This guy&#39;s name was Badin and he is a<br/>\nmember of the Legends guild.  And he truly makes them Legendary!<br/>\n<br/>\nSnyak <br/>\nWarrior of the 12th Level<br/>\nQeynos, Antonica 53226  currently visiting Freeport<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n&quot;The opinions expressed herein are my own and do not <br/>\nnecessarily reflect those of my Guild nor my Deity.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tMifsud, Michael [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Mifsud@...\">Michael.Mifsud@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tSunday, June 06, 1999 10:09 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [warriors_eq] From the diary of a<br/>\nwarrior princess<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Mifsud, Michael&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Mifsud@...\">Michael.Mifsud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWant to here REALLY rude?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tOn the weekend someone in West Commons decided to kill a<br/>\nhill giant, so he<br/>\n\t\tor she KITIE&#39;d the hill giant around the zone border.  I<br/>\nhave no idea how<br/>\n\t\tmany people it killed, it defiantly killed everyone who was<br/>\nat the Orc camp.<br/>\n\t\tMy partner and I managed to dodge the giant 3 times, he got<br/>\nus on the 4th<br/>\n\t\tcircuit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThats just rude, you dont KITE something like a giant,<br/>\nespecially when it<br/>\n\t\tresides in a low level zone.  I dont mind dieing because of<br/>\na fight that I<br/>\n\t\tstarted, but to be kited is just frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n\t\tHow has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n\t\tShare your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n\t\tFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
