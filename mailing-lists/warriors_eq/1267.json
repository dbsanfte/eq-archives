Warriors are already the best in the game for defense. It&#39;s just the<br/>\n&gt; offensive part of it that gets me. Since when were warriors only tanks? In<br/>\n&gt; almost any other RPG I&#39;ve ever played, warriors kicked arse on the same<br/>\n&gt; level with just about any other class. Lets look at console RPGs for a<br/>\n&gt; sec.<br/>\n&gt; Final Fantasy VII is a perfect example. Sure summons and spells did about<br/>\n&gt; 9999 damage at high levels, but you also had special ATTACKS (called limit<br/>\n&gt; breaks) that did comparable damage, if not the same. Not to mention that a<br/>\n&gt; regular attck did about half that damage anyways. But in EQ we don&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; get HALF of the damage casters get. A caster comes in and hits a mob for,<br/>\n&gt; what, 1200? Does any warrior here do 600 damage in the same amount of<br/>\n&gt; time?<br/>\n&gt; 500? Hell even 300? that&#39;s not even 1/4 the damage a caster can do. It<br/>\n&gt; reminds me of playing AD & D in a tournament where I was the only fighter<br/>\n&gt; among 10 other Wizards. They always came in and blasted everything with<br/>\n&gt; spells and all I did was take the hits. But guess what? When we got to<br/>\n&gt; some<br/>\n&gt; Drow or something I was the one killing everything since their spells<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; work as good all of a sudden. But even then I could do comparable damage.<br/>\n&gt; Lets say they cast Fireball...good spell in AD&D. 6d6 +1/level damage. So<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; caster of 20th level can do 56 points of damage with one fireball to a<br/>\n&gt; LARGE<br/>\n&gt; group. But with my +3 Vorpal weapon and girdle of storm giant strength,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; kick his arse in damage. 2 attacks per round my damage all total is 46 per<br/>\n&gt; round. That breaks down like this: +3 Vorpal Sword is 1d8+3, then my storm<br/>\n&gt; giant strentgh (24) adds +12 to damage, making maximum damage 23 per<br/>\n&gt; attack,<br/>\n&gt; twice a round. That&#39;s not including the random effects of the vorpal<br/>\n&gt; weapon.<br/>\n&gt; Anytime I get a critical strike (20 on a d20) it automatically chops off<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; opponents head, killing him instantly. I&#39;m not trying to compare the<br/>\n&gt; virtues<br/>\n&gt; of AD&D to EQ, because the last thing the world needs is someone trying to<br/>\n&gt; clone the rules again. What I am doing is showing an example that the game<br/>\n&gt; CAN be balanced for each class. The damage a caster gets can blow up an<br/>\n&gt; entire group (i&#39;ve seen it take out over 30 monsters) whereas a fighter is<br/>\n&gt; for one-on-one melee combat, but they both can do about the same damage<br/>\n&gt; PER<br/>\n&gt; MONSTER at the same level. Maybe I am just rambling....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jynxx<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
