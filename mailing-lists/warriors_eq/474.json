I suggest adding Gambling. Think about it,<br/>\ngambling has been around for centuries in one form or another. Players could<br/>\ngather around an NPC to play against the house or Players could carry a (EQ<br/>\ntheme) Deck or cup of dice to play against other chars at any time or place.<br/>\nThey already have something that is close to what would be needed and that<br/>\nis the trade screen. Players could place the bets in a slot, click ok, and<br/>\nthen the dice would throw or a card is drawn and whoever wins would<br/>\nautomaticaly win the bet. If they wanted to take it further, they could<br/>\nimplement gambling as a skill, making the chances greater for the higher<br/>\nskill ya have(not sure about all the implications there though)<br/>\nI have been tossing around this idead since beta and I think it would be<br/>\ngreat to draw us together for drinks(if you are drunk maybe gambling skill<br/>\nis affected some way) and get us telling stories and maybe even make (or<br/>\nlose) a few plat.<br/>\nWhat do ya think? <br/>\n<br/>\n=======================================================<br/>\nThis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.
