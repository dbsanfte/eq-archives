I will not argue that point.  I will not argue the point<br/>\nthat we should not be mammoth damage inflicters like a caster as well.  The<br/>\nmages and wizards are the true damage inflicters.  But the warriors are<br/>\nstill caught way low on the damage stick as far as I am concerned.  As far<br/>\nas what we want, lets look more towards what we need.  If we are not<br/>\ndemanding, but reasonable in our requests to Verant, we will get farther in<br/>\nnegotaitions.  Ever heard the addage you can get a horse to travel farther<br/>\nwith a carrot in his face than a whip at his back?  Askinf for more damage,<br/>\nmore attacks, critical hits, and everything else is ok.  But we we need to<br/>\ncompromise a little.  We can submit a list, have that list rated as to the<br/>\nimportance to what we as a group feel should come first, as well as the<br/>\nreasons why.  This shows unity, thought and the ability to present things in<br/>\nan intelligent light.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimply asking to do mad amounts of damage is in my mind absurd.  The big<br/>\ndamage is ment for the casters, not the warriors.  The warriors are there to<br/>\ntake the damage, and allow the casters to actually kill the creature.  Yes,<br/>\nI know it is nice to kill creatures.  But face it, we all knew when we<br/>\ncreated this character we had no way to heal, no way to do anything with<br/>\nmagic at all.  And in EQ magic is the name of the game.  So we need to<br/>\nsettle to be a group player.  And not be the almighty slayer of beasts.<br/>\nThat doesnt mean that our role should be unimportant in combat damage tho.<br/>\nYes, we do need to be able to influct more damage.  And that is our goal for<br/>\nthe most part I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if I sound like I am rambling, things are comming out of the mind<br/>\nfaster than I can formulate good responses.<br/>\nI will take alot of time in writing the letter to Verant tho.<br/>\n<br/>\nDyvim Kincaid<br/>\nStormriders of Cazic Thule.<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Tom Swift [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, June 10, 1999 2:23 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Petition<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I agree and disagree.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There is no way a warrior is going to do as much damage per round as a<br/>\nspellcaster on certains kinds of creatures.  How exactly are you going to do<br/>\nthe kind of damage attainable with a fireball against a creature like a hill<br/>\ngiant with something like a sword?  You&#39;re only chance is to achieve some<br/>\nkind of critical hit to a sensitive part of the giant...maybe a sword thrust<br/>\nto the gonads or something.  Regardless, I propose the critical hit skill so<br/>\nthat a warrior can add more to a group, and have comparable survivability<br/>\nsoloing.  Also, I think critical hits should be used like parry/dodge and<br/>\nnot like kick/bash, Simply because the assumption is you are ALWAYS trying<br/>\nto do the most damage possible.  With kick/bash you are making a choice of<br/>\nattack. Kick for more damage or bash to stun.  Not that I see any high level<br/>\nwarriors bashing...but the option is there.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Warriors will never be able to out damage a mage. However, the warrior<br/>\nshould be able to last a lot longer in physical combat.  I do see that<br/>\ntaking effect in the mid-teen levels, and I can only assume it gets better.<br/>\nBut the hybrids can take nearly as much melee punishment and deal out nearly<br/>\nas much melee damage, and supplement combat with spells.  The warrior is<br/>\noutclassed in every respect by a hybrid at a comparable level, in the<br/>\nmid-teens.  Clerics are very powerful in every game I have played but are<br/>\nalways not very popular classes to play. Not sure why this is, but in EQ the<br/>\n1-10 levels are tough on a cleric.  But after that I see them really<br/>\nromping.  It seems to me most clerics I have seen group out of convenience<br/>\nrather then necessity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Jynxx &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jynxx@...\">Jynxx@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Thursday, June 10, 1999 3:33 PM<br/>\n    Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Petition<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    ��<br/>\n    Ok...sorry....should have added on to that. The critical hit is nice,<br/>\nalthough I can definetly see monks getting that as well since they pretty<br/>\nmuch are supposed to know all the nerve points and such on a body.<br/>\nAlso....let&#39;s try this on for size. Warriors need to get a BIG bonus on<br/>\ndamage, not just every other round or so. We are fighting machines. Why, if<br/>\nI am level 45, should I not be able to be trained so well that I attack 6<br/>\ntimes in one round? I know my sword, I know my enemy, and I know where to<br/>\nhit and how many times. I think we should get more attacks, more damage, AND<br/>\ncritical hits. We should at least be on damage somewhat compareable to a<br/>\nspell caster. People are going to argue....&quot;But they use magic! How can a<br/>\nsword stroke compare to the Art?&quot; Well...when I take my 2-handed sword and<br/>\nchop off someone&#39;s head before you even get one syllable of a spell out of<br/>\nyour mouth, the argument will be over. Lets face it...an object is an<br/>\nobject. Sure a lightning strike MIGHT hurt more than getting hit with a<br/>\ndouble bladed axe right in your groin, but I personally have never been<br/>\nstruck by either so who am I to say? It just seems to me that I should be<br/>\nable to hurt someone with a physical weapon actually hitting them just as<br/>\nmuch as someone hurling balls of fire at them. Grrrr.....this point is<br/>\ngetting frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Jynxx</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
