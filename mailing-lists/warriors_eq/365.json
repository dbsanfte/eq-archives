I too have troubles finding a good area to<br/>\nfight in at this lvl. But what I do is now is fight in<br/>\nHighhold. Usually there are enough groups around to<br/>\ntake care of possible trains, and soloing is not too<br/>\ndifficult. The loot is good as in Lavastorm.<br/>\n- If you are willing to Travel farther into oasis<br/>\nthere are usually less people at the 2nd pillar. <br/>\n<br/>\nXraxex<br/>\nWarrior of the 17th Order<br/>\nIndigo Brotherhood of the Tier&#39;dal<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Tom Swift  wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am a bit lost as to where I should be hunting<br/>\n&gt; right now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have reached level 15, I am almost 16.
