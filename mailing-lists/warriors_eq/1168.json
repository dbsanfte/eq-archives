Warriors at the lower levels","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-563177695\">I am in agreement as well.... Short of the fact that warriors are needed in<br/>\nhigh level groups.  Let me backtrack a little bit.  Warriors at the lower<br/>\nlevels are far superior to hybrid classes in general.  But at the higer<br/>\nlevels, the hybrids have gained so many abilities and extras that the<br/>\nwarrior is overshadowed by the attributes of a hybrid.  Also, a hybrid can<br/>\nfulfill the same role that a warrior can at those higher levels just as well<br/>\nas a warrior can.  A warrior also has very little ability at higher levels<br/>\nto use his taunt, bue to lack of damage inflicted to a mob.  I find this<br/>\nhappeneing to me at level 30 already.  How bad will this be at level 40?<br/>\nThe lack of a warrior being able to get a mob off the casters will make his<br/>\nworth in the battle less.  Therefore groups will be more inclined to chose a<br/>\nhybrid class as their tank.  This will cause a loss of people actually<br/>\nplaying warriors in the game, leading to the downfall of the class as a<br/>\nwhole.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for wizards/warrior argument.  Warriors are not supposed to do the damage<br/>\na wizard can do.  we are there as the shield so they can lay down the damage<br/>\nat will....<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get into a good group that is working well together.  Where everyone<br/>\nin the group knows there place in the group organization.  Wizards become<br/>\nthe secondary source of damage, not the primary.  If they nuke to soon, they<br/>\nare mobbed, they have to hold their spells in check until the right time to<br/>\nburn down the mob.  Yes, they do put some small burns into the middle of the<br/>\nbattle, but they shouldnt let loose the great damage spells until late in<br/>\nthe battle.  This is the true place where warriors shine.  But even at that,<br/>\nby the time the battle nears where its time for the wizards power, the<br/>\nwarrior has done little except take alot of damage.  IMO we should be able<br/>\nto help with some of the beginning portion of battles more than what we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking that the majority of us agree on the critical hit issue.  How<br/>\ndo we feel about the specialization skills?  Also, remember that we cap all<br/>\nof our skills (that didnt cap earlier) at 200.  Some of the hybrid classes<br/>\ncontinue to be able to gain in skills past that.  I feel we should be able<br/>\nto remove that cap on our skill and continue to progress in them.  We are<br/>\nwarriors, we never stop learning our art.<br/>\n<br/>\nDyvim Kincaid<br/>\nStormriders of Cazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Zwanenburg, John [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, June 11, 1999 8:53 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Warriors vs Wizards<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Zwanenburg, John&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I whole heartedly agree with you wayne.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The game is about balance. Some people are saying that a group of really<br/>\n&gt; high levels do not need warriors. I say thats BS my friends always want my<br/>\n&gt; warrior in their group. Not just becuase im company mind you. Because they<br/>\n&gt; are spell casters. If im not there, the MOB would latch onto them and<br/>\n&gt; interrupt their casting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sure we could beg verant for one more skill .... critical hit , which is a<br/>\n&gt; very good idea. And i like the idea of it being like ripsote and parry.<br/>\n&gt; Makes more sense. But the fact of the matter is this: We are there to<br/>\n&gt; prevent our spellcasting buddies from being hit by creatures so that THEY<br/>\n&gt; can dish out the damage. I have never had anyone complain to me<br/>\n&gt; and say look<br/>\n&gt; man we dont want you in the group anymore cause you doont dish<br/>\n&gt; out the most<br/>\n&gt; damage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Every group needs a good strong warrior.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; John<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: \tWayne Sheppard[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: \tFriday, June 11, 1999 10:26 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Warriors vs Wizards<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Many of the Warriors here have complained that they cannot do damage as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fast<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as a Wizard.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now all of you real life ninjas and steel sword swinging fools just calm<br/>\n&gt; &gt; down.
