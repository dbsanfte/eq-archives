I don&#39;t know about you but very rarely will<br/>\nVerant give out this kind of information, if at all.  And someone saying<br/>\n&#39;because Verant said so&#39; without saying where he heard that is like someone<br/>\ntelling you &#39;My friend is a GM and he is going to ban you&#39;.   No, most of<br/>\nthe time if a player tells what he has found in his experience within the<br/>\ngame I will tend to listen to them more.  Its when they start saying &#39;I<br/>\nheard from Verant&#39; or &#39;Brad is my brother and he said&#39; is when I usually<br/>\ndon&#39;t even listen to their argument at all.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Savej@...\">Savej@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Savej@...\">Savej@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, July 20, 1999 5:44 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Armor & Absorption is all AC.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Savej@...\">Savej@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;I have direct confirmation from Verant that armor type is the Damage<br/>\n&gt; Absorption constant.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; Point:  Anyone can state this.  Now give us facts.  What everyone has<br/>\n&gt; said<br/>\n&gt;  for this thread is only conjecture.  And the one thing I have found<br/>\n&gt; constant<br/>\n&gt;  in EQ is that conjecture = assume (and you know the saying about assume).<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you can&#39;t accept what a poster is calling a fact based on your<br/>\n&gt; assessment <br/>\n&gt; of the poster than you&#39;re wasting everyone&#39;s time by filling a post asking<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; him for more.  Also note that the &quot;because Verant said so&quot; point wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; his <br/>\n&gt; only argument.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as the invisible, theoretical damage modifiers go, I&#39;m curious as<br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; why so few people are defending their existance so vehemently.
