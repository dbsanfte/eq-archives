Something like a high level mob spawn<br/>\non top of a camping group would suit me just fine.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faderic<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Mifsud, Michael&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Mifsud, Michael&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Mifsud@...\">Michael.Mifsud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hmmm I am really starting to hate campers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I use to take camping with a grain of salt and just move on.  This is now<br/>\n&gt; becoming IMPOSSIBLE for me at my level to do.  Let me recite a little story.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I login on Saturday starting out in lake rathe, camped.  Not to fussed since<br/>\n&gt; I can not pull the aviaks anyway, only CASTERS can.  Whats up with that?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I moved on to the Egret Aviaks, CAMPED.  hmmm no problem lets try HH, both<br/>\n&gt; ends camped. sigh, oh well im near Neriak I can head home to stock up and<br/>\n&gt; try out lesser faydark and Mistmoore.  On the boat I get, I arrive in<br/>\n&gt; Mistmoore for the first time, thought the place was pretty cool.  Learned<br/>\n&gt; the easier areas pretty quick and start pulling for my group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wow this is going pretty well.  Hmmm zone went from 2 groups to 5 groups.<br/>\n&gt; One group SIITING on the gargoyle spawn, another group hogging THE whole<br/>\n&gt; graveyard, and the third, this is the best, the third camping the CORRIDOR<br/>\n&gt; between the easy side of Mistmoore to the hard side of Mistmoore.  I mean<br/>\n&gt; C&#39;MON.  Thats just RUDE.  Everytime we tried to pull some tuffer mobs<br/>\n&gt; through the corridor their mages pets went berserk and they effectively took<br/>\n&gt; all the kills.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; SIGH<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I remember when lake rathe was empty.  I remember when HH was empty.  Is it<br/>\n&gt; just because most people on the server are my level ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; People just DONT understand that a spawn can only support SO many groups.<br/>\n&gt; Oh, a word of warning, NEVER take a caster to the Aviaks In Lake Rathe, they<br/>\n&gt; wont leave.  I know a few of my friends who I didn&#39;t see until they made<br/>\n&gt; level 25.  They just would not leave that easy xp area.  I hate it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ARGH!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ahhh I feel much better now, thanks for listening.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will be starting a new character on MM just to see if its a little better<br/>\n&gt; WAY behind the pack.
