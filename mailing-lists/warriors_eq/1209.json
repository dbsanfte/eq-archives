Now he has no mana for any heals.   So after 6 rounds of<br/>\n100 damage (assuming no resists which is unlikely) the cleric only has his<br/>\npiddly 17 max weapon damage while the Warrior can still hit for up to 60<br/>\nevery round.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Date: Fri, 11 Jun 1999 16:11:39 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Zwanenburg, John&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Warriors vs Wizards<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Doc,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree with you on all but your last scentence. Clerics are seriously<br/>\n&gt; underestimated. Belive me when i tell you that my friend who is a level 37<br/>\n&gt; cleric can solo a sand giant and i cannot with my level 37 warrior. Plain<br/>\n&gt; and simple. And to say they dont have firepower well thats not true<br/>\n </span></blockquote>either.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Take MY cleric for example. Level 16, ac of 390, hp at 360, attack is 302.<br/>\n&gt; Not bad...not bad at all. I can tank for some time without worrying about<br/>\n&gt; dying at all. (Not to mention healing spells AND divine aura, an<br/>\n&gt; invulnerability spell) Ok so now there i go tanking away doing around 17<br/>\n&gt; damage with my FS morning star. Not bad. Then i start to cast without<br/>\n&gt; getting interrupted which is not hard to do at all. I can cast my Smite in<br/>\n&gt; between rounds. And it does 78 damage. Boom there you have it, each other<br/>\n&gt; round i am doing 100 damage. where as a level 16 warrior would do about 60<br/>\n&gt; at most. But thats not his role, all im saying is that i think clerics are<br/>\n&gt; the best solo class in the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; just my 2 cents </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
