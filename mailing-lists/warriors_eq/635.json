Does anyone know? the funny thing is that the necklace <br/>\nis a LORE item so I guess it is part of some quest too<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone got any leads on this?<br/>\n<br/>\nVashi, Eternal warriors<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well I have seen other monsters fighting monsters but only when<br/>\n&gt;someone has charmed them (probably what happened with the<br/>\n&gt;grizzly fighting the hill giant,  and the lions attack anything that<br/>\n&gt;is bi-pedal :)  ).   This was beyond unpredictable.  Ghanex just<br/>\n&gt;stands there and summons his pets.

Who knows?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; They<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could have broken the spell that entraped them, or they could just have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gotten pissed off at him. I see monsters fighting monsters all the time. <br/>\n&gt;A<br/>\n&gt; &gt; griz was fighting a hill giant the other day in W. Karana, and in the <br/>\n&gt;same<br/>\n&gt; &gt; day I saw a lion take out one of the two farmers. All I&#39;m saying is, <br/>\n&gt;they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; made the monsters AI very unpredictable, and that is the result.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tyveris,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Aspiring Samurai<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; See homepage for details.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;How many communities do you think join ONElist each day?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;More than 1,000!
