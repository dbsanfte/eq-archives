There are some","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1185471319\">I completely agree with you. I hate this type of play from people who, by simply<br/>\nmoving on, could make the game a lot better for everyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some great ideas in this thread. I have a couple of thoughts on the<br/>\nsubject also:<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, there are currently no level restrictions in this game. Why? Nothing<br/>\nticks me off more than to see a low level character running around in full<br/>\nbanded with some awesome weapon ... it practically SCREAMS of twinking. On any<br/>\nother game you play of this type there is usually a level restriction. Something<br/>\nlike, not being able to hold or use the weapon unless you are that level, or not<br/>\nbeing able to save it when you log off or die. Please, please, please .... get<br/>\nthis into Everquest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, how about some sort of flag for an ultra rare item. If you have one ...<br/>\nyou cannot have another (unless you lose/sell the first). It may not fix<br/>\neverything, but if a small group is camping for objects ... they WILL eventually<br/>\nhave to leave to get rid of them because they wouldn&#39;t be able to hold more.<br/>\nThis would limit those people running around and grabbing 5 rare items during<br/>\none super farming session ... just to sell  them off. It&#39;s not so much the<br/>\nfarming that would be helped, it would be the reduction of the lines at the camp<br/>\nsites.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two cents on the subject...<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faderic<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTom Swift wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Tom Swift&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A solution to camping shouldn&#39;t be to complicated.<br/>\n&gt; A high level magic weapon spawning on a unique NPC cannot spawn if the item<br/>\n&gt; exists in the &quot;spawn area&quot; AND the item must be initiated by a quest.<br/>\n&gt; Unique NPCs should also spawn in a random location in the zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Farming is the main problem....I think. I have no respect for farmers.  If<br/>\n&gt; they won&#39;t take turns on rare spawn item I will kill-steal it.  I am a<br/>\n&gt; dark-elf after all.  I don&#39;t necessarily like doing this, but when a group<br/>\n&gt; has been farming a spot for days and refuses to share the spawns there isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; really any option.  So when the creature spawns....my group attacks it.  We<br/>\n&gt; try to get it first and then accuse them of kill-stealing...which is true<br/>\n&gt; depending on your perspective.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just think that farmers ruin the spirit of the game.  I never camp a rare<br/>\n&gt; spawn item for more than an hour or 2 spawns whichever comes first.  I<br/>\n&gt; respect those who camp a spot so they can have that awesome weapon they<br/>\n&gt; really want but can&#39;t afford....but I depise those who camp a spot so they<br/>\n&gt; can sell the items.  It just isn&#39;t in the spirit of the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just my opinion.  I know some of you won&#39;t approve of my method of dealing<br/>\n&gt; with farmers, and you are entitled to that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist has over 150,000 e-mail communities from which to chose!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
