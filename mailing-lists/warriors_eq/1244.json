It has merit, but in<br/>\npractice it isn&#39;t really tactically or strategically useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve played a little shadowknight and a little paladin and experimented with<br/>\nthese once a day abilities.  What I proposed earlier was similiar to the<br/>\nshadowknight&#39;s ability and I was looking for feedback.  After thinking about<br/>\nit I realize that this kind of ability would do nothing to enhance the<br/>\noverall melee effectiveness of the warrior class.<br/>\n<br/>\nLay Hands or Harm Touch are last ditch &quot;save my ass&quot; abilities.  They can<br/>\narguably be used strategically to take on a higher level mob that a party<br/>\nmight not otherwise be able to kill, but it is usually a last ditch attempt<br/>\nto finish a battle alive.  Without having significant duration attached to<br/>\nit the Battle Cry becomes another last ditch attempt to save the day, when<br/>\neverything goes sour.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow this isn&#39;t a bad idea. However I think that what the majority of us are<br/>\nlooking for is a way to enhance the long term combat effectiveness of the<br/>\nwarrior and to increase the average damage a warrior does per round over<br/>\nthat of a hybrid.  The Battle Cry you propose does not accomplish that.  In<br/>\na standard melee against a chasm minotaur with my paladin friend, I want to<br/>\nbe the one who dealt more melee damage at the end of the fight.  I don&#39;t<br/>\ncare if the wizard zapped it for the most damage, I just want to be the one<br/>\nto deal the single highest melee damage over all the rangers, paladins,<br/>\nshadowknights, and so on.  Right now all I do is suck up damage during a<br/>\nfight, and then suck up mana in heals after the fight.  The hybrids all have<br/>\nsome form of self healing, giving them an overall advantage so why should we<br/>\nshare melee ability with them? Shouldn&#39;t we be stronger?  But now I am<br/>\nranting....<br/>\n<br/>\nThe skill enhancement I agree with.....why should warriors be capped in<br/>\nweapons skills?  That is all we are about.  We should always continue to<br/>\ngrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Wayne Sheppard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, June 14, 1999 5:46 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [warriors_eq] Digest Number 63<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t want Warriors to get Critical Strike, at least not as it has been<br/>\n&gt;presented on this list.

A sword swing could be a critical strike, or maybe a kick could be,<br/>\n&gt;or<br/>\n&gt;&gt;even a bash could be a critical strike.  Any attack can be used to deliver<br/>\n&gt;&gt;critical damage.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Second point.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;Having the abilities go up like parry and dodge would make it too<br/>\n </span></blockquote>powerful<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I believe. They go up without the need to use them.  &quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;The only thing you are doing by making this an invoked skill is giving<br/>\n&gt;&gt;warriors another key to tap repeatedly in combat.  You are forcing<br/>\n </span></blockquote>warriors<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;to choose between most likely doing 11 damage with a kick or maybe getting<br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;critical hit.  I don&#39;t agree.  Warriors can and should use everything at<br/>\n&gt;&gt;their disposal, slash and kick or bash, and at the same time be looking<br/>\n </span></blockquote>for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;an opportunity to strike a critical hit.  A critical hit is not something<br/>\n&gt;&gt;you just decided to do, you take an opportunity. Your suggestion indicates<br/>\n&gt;&gt;that parry/dodge is a random part of combat.  I argue that it is indeed a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;skill, one which I wish was successful more often.  It isn&#39;t random<br/>\n </span></blockquote>because<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt;a warrior will endeavor to parry and dodge all attacks, and not just<br/>\n&gt;&gt;randomly manage to avoid them.  I speak from real life experience on this<br/>\n&gt;&gt;one not just about the game.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I see where you are going with the critical hit thing, but in the context<br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;EQ the usefulness of the skill would be much hampered by your &quot;invoked&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;method.  The average gamers style of play is to pick an attack and keep<br/>\n&gt;&gt;using it.  I for one, would simply max out my critical hit skill in party<br/>\n&gt;&gt;fighting against yellow and red mobs.  Then I would use the skill at every<br/>\n&gt;&gt;opportunity.  My dark elf warrior would likely max the skill in a single<br/>\n&gt;&gt;level, and be very successful using it.  I fear that barbarians, ogres and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;trolls would be at a disadvantage here.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I am solidly convinced that the parry/dodge method is the right way to go,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and let EQ check when to use the skill and check its success.  Then<br/>\n&gt;critical<br/>\n&gt;&gt;hit won&#39;t just become a replacement for kick/bash but instead become the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;real enhancement to our class we all think is needed.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Looking for a new hobby?
