Belive me when i tell you that my<br/>\n&gt; friend who is a level 37<br/>\n&gt; cleric can solo a sand giant and i cannot with my<br/>\n&gt; level 37 warrior. Plain<br/>\n&gt; and simple. And to say they dont have firepower well<br/>\n&gt; thats not true either.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Take MY cleric for example. Level 16, ac of 390, hp<br/>\n&gt; at 360, attack is 302.<br/>\n&gt; Not bad...not bad at all. I can tank for some time<br/>\n&gt; without worrying about<br/>\n&gt; dying at all. (Not to mention healing spells AND<br/>\n&gt; divine aura, an<br/>\n&gt; invulnerability spell) Ok so now there i go tanking<br/>\n&gt; away doing around 17<br/>\n&gt; damage with my FS morning star. Not bad. Then i<br/>\n&gt; start to cast without<br/>\n&gt; getting interrupted which is not hard to do at all.<br/>\n&gt; I can cast my Smite in<br/>\n&gt; between rounds. And it does 78 damage. Boom there<br/>\n&gt; you have it, each other<br/>\n&gt; round i am doing 100 damage. where as a level 16<br/>\n&gt; warrior would do about 60<br/>\n&gt; at most. But thats not his role, all im saying is<br/>\n&gt; that i think clerics are<br/>\n&gt; the best solo class in the game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; just my 2 cents<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
