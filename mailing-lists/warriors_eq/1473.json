AC is the second half, and the lesser half, of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the armor system in Everquest.  The first half is damage absorption.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;According to Verant, AC _is_ everything.  There is no &#39;intrinsic&#39; damage<br/>\n&gt;absorption element for different armors.  Rather, their relative damage<br/>\n&gt;absorption and protective effects are stored in the AC value.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Each level of armor absorbs more damage than the levels before it.  If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you doubt, try it.  Fight something on your level naked and see how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; badly you get hit; every shot will come in at max damage.  Put your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; armor back on and see shots hitting for 2, 5, etc...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This analysis is just plain... well... half-baked.  The reason you begin<br/>\n&gt;to get savaged without armor is because your AC has dropped by some<br/>\n&gt;obscene value.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The difference here is not the &#39;type&#39; of armor, but the AC difference.<br/>\n&gt;Thus, if you could find cloth-looking armor with a better AC than plate,<br/>\n&gt;it would behoove you to wear it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is why you see bare-sleeved high level players... They&#39;re wearing<br/>\n&gt;cloth-looking armor with _higher_ AC than either Plate or Rubicite.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; PLATE IS WORTH IT.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;AC equivalents to Plate are worth just as much as Plate itself.  You only<br/>\n&gt;need the AC of Plate, not the &#39;look&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just going to do two examples:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lizardscale cloak vs. Bronze Cloak<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would _definitely_ use the Lizardscale Cloak.  It is Plate with stat<br/>\n&gt;modifiers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Another common item that _is_ better than Plate would be the Thick Leather<br/>\n&gt;Apron, which is both lighter and has equivalent or better AC than a Plate<br/>\n&gt;Girdle.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just some thoughts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Drew<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
