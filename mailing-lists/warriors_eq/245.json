Your skills will advance it may take a couple levels but<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;ll eventually get maxed out.  If I were to go by your strategy of<br/>\n&gt; getting my self killed so my skills would be maxed out per level, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; still be 25 working on my reposte skill, I&#39;m almost 28th, so don&#39;t expect<br/>\n&gt; everytime that you get a new skill that you will have it maxed out by the<br/>\n&gt; time you make your next level.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as factions are concerned.....one of the biggest advantages of<br/>\n&gt; being &quot;evil&quot; is that you can kill any good NPC you want to, and some of<br/>\n&gt; the good NPCs drop really nice loot.  Personally I can&#39;t wait till I get<br/>\n&gt; high 40s and I can walk into freeport and whoop up on some guards (with a<br/>\n&gt; good evil party of course) :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Salr D&#39;Taynkk<br/>\n&gt; Dark Warrior of The Kith<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Tom Swift&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>&gt; 5.18.99 12:10:55 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am Bael, a warrior of the 15th Order and a dark elf.  At the start of<br/>\n&gt; this level I put 20 points each into dual wield and double attack. I am a<br/>\n&gt; little over a bubble away from  16 and my skills are now 65 for dual wield<br/>\n&gt; and 72 for double attack.  My rate of advancement has slowed considerably,<br/>\n&gt; I am wondering if I should expect to max these at 80 before I hit 16 or if<br/>\n&gt; that is uncommon.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I can max them I will likely get myself killed right before i level up<br/>\n&gt; in order to buy some more time at 15.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; By the way I am using a combine scimitar and tentacle whip against magical<br/>\n&gt; opponents and dual mino axes against non-magical opponents.  My max damage<br/>\n&gt; per round is 79, that is double attacks on both weapons with max<br/>\n&gt; damage(17) and a max damage kick (11).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And in reference to others questions about faction.  It is easy enough to<br/>\n&gt; gain enough faction for the Commonlands vendors to deal with you, just<br/>\n&gt; kill orcs by the dozens.  I kill every orc I see, pawns, centurions and so<br/>\n&gt; on.  You can get Freeport residents to deal with you by completing the orc<br/>\n&gt; slashed belt quest repeatedly.  If you do that tho you faction with the<br/>\n&gt; Paladins in North Freeport will get worse.  It is up to you whether West<br/>\n&gt; and east freeport are more important to you then North Freeport<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bael<br/>\n&gt; 15th Order<br/>\n&gt; Indigo Brotherhood<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
