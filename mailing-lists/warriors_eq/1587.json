So it is the situation in which you would use dual wield in order to get more attacks and a better chance to hit and do damage.  Against other mobs though 2 handed is better.  Currently I have a BIBS (Blackened Iron Bastard Sword) and I am level 22.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hit for about 46 max damage per swing, and when I get double attack I often hit for a total of 70+ damage per round.  Throw in a kick for another 20 and it is not unusual for me to deal 100 damage per round.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor 1 hand slashing I have a PGT and a Obsidian scimitar.  I hit for an average of 14 damage per hit, with dual wield and double attack in same round I do around 40+ damage with a kick for 20 I can do 60+ per round.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOver time there isn&#39;t much difference between 1 handed and 2 handed, when you calculate in misses over the long term they are equally effective.  Until you obtain 1hs weapons that have a  damage rating of 10 or higher.<br/>\n<br/>\nBael<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Matthew Horne <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, October 17, 1999 7:02 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [warriors_eq] One hand or two?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  G&#39;day my name is Kalroth.. a level 7 dwarf warrior on the solusek ro server<br/>\n  My question is whether one hand or two hand slash is better for a warrior<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hope you can help me , thanks </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
