I<br/>\nfind them in melee much weaker then warriors and it took me longer to get to<br/>\n15 then it did with my warrior (using /played time).  Not much longer but<br/>\nlonger.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ability to track down foes, root them, arrow and burn them is a great<br/>\nability.  My warrior heart is satisfied with the fact that they get all, bar<br/>\none, warrior skill.  I believe I will stick with this ranger.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTom did you solo any orcs?  Just curious since I find soloing outdoor stuff<br/>\nwith the ranger quite easy.  Normally can reduce a yellow to 50% hp before<br/>\nengaging with them hand-to-hand (or hand-to-talon or paw or well you get the<br/>\ndrift).<br/>\n<br/>\nMahlyn<br/>\nRanger of the 15th Season.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tTom Swift[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, June 15, 1999 12:34 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Petition<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Tom Swift&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Careful...rangers are equivalent combatants to warriors, even though some<br/>\n&gt; skills lag a few levels behind.  The magic you get more than makes up for<br/>\n&gt; any deficiency.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I did the same as you and now find myself playing the ranger more and<br/>\n&gt; more,<br/>\n&gt; it is easier to level because I only have to stop and rest after 3 or 4<br/>\n&gt; fights with blues.  I fight, expend mana on heals, and fight over and over<br/>\n&gt; till mana is gone, then I cast invisble on myself and rest till mana is<br/>\n&gt; restored and repeat.  I made level 16 in about 2/3rds the playing time it<br/>\n&gt; took to do the same with my warrior.  and I am comparing in game time<br/>\n&gt; (/played) not real life time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now I have hit the wall I did with my warrior, except this time it is<br/>\n&gt; level<br/>\n&gt; 16 and not 14.  Oasis isn&#39;t the hunting ground it used to be on Bertox,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; I never cared for boring croc hunting anyway.  I am right now touring<br/>\n&gt; Antonica looking for a new temporary home.  Looks like Highpass will be it<br/>\n&gt; for awhile. Excellent loot and experience.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Problem is the orc end is so camped with people looking for halberds it is<br/>\n&gt; hard to get any of the orcs. Wizard item farmers tend to steal kills from<br/>\n&gt; all but large groups.  Gnolls are good fun though...love smacking those<br/>\n&gt; doggies around with my shiny brass halberd<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Patricia Halas &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Monday, June 14, 1999 7:47 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [warriors_eq] Petition<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Patricia Halas &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patty_halas@...\">patty_halas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So far I have to agree with everything on the board.  I am playing a<br/>\n&gt; Ranger<br/>\n&gt; &gt;now (not forever!  Just to see how she would do), and find myslef kicking<br/>\n&gt; &gt;butt.  Once I get up to 15 or 16 I will compare my Ranger&#39;s abilities<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my Barbarian Warrior.  Nevertheless, I agree 100% with taking away the<br/>\n&gt; skill<br/>\n&gt; &gt;cap from Warriors.  No reason a Warrior shouldn&#39;t be better at melee than<br/>\n&gt; &gt;anyone else.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Let&#39;s do this.
