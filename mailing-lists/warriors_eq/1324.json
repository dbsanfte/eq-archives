There were 6 of us. A<br/>\n&gt;level 49 cleric. Level 43 warrior (Me) Level 47 Wizard, level 47 Rogue,<br/>\n&gt;level 49 necro and a level 45 Ranger. We decided why the heck not give him <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;try even tho he conned red to everyone in the party. Well it was quite the<br/>\n&gt;battle. By far the craziest i have ever seen. In the end only the Necro and<br/>\n&gt;the wizard were left but somehow they managed to pull it off. I tried my<br/>\n&gt;best to stay in melee with him and was doing quite well untill the cleric<br/>\n&gt;had a fizzle. But then it was ouch time. As soon as i went, the Rogue was<br/>\n&gt;next and followed by the Ranger. The cleric somehow managed to stay alive<br/>\n&gt;for a while longer but couldnt handle the beating. When i finally made it<br/>\n&gt;back the necro was at 1 quarter life and the wozard half. Talk about your<br/>\n&gt;kick ass battle, Ill never forget it. When my friend who was just watching<br/>\n&gt;sends me the screens, would any one like them?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lothaniel/Rayne<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: \tTuesday, June 15, 1999 8:27 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Warriors vs Hybrids<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I wrote an e-mail to one of those guys from PPI - the ones who do the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; great<br/>\n&gt; &gt; analysis works of classs (see eq-stratis cleric for a sampling of their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; work). I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; told him of the things I have been reading here such as a critical <br/>\n&gt;strike<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he didn&#39;t think would be accepted), increase what bind wound could do ( <br/>\n&gt;he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; agreed that it should go up to 70-80%), increased skill cap (no comment<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him) and unique warrior skill (again  no comment from him). His idea was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the warrior&#39;s  defensives skill be increased some how. That would make <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warrior harder to hit and therefore less damage and less down time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am going to try to get him to join this mailing list since I feel he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give great insight. He did say that they were not going to be writing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything<br/>\n&gt; &gt; soon but said something about how a warrior could be tweeked to make a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warrior<br/>\n&gt; &gt; awsome.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Azlana<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Got an opinion?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Make it count!
