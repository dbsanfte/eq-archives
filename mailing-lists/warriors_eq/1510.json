From my experience it <br/>\nonly kicks in when my hp&#39;s are really low,, just before that point where I <br/>\nneed to run; however usually by the time it kicks in I am only a hit or two <br/>\nfrom the point where I can no longer run... well that is unless I am very, <br/>\nvery close to a zone, which dosn&#39;t happen very often.  So the only realistic <br/>\nuse I can think of is a reminder that I need to evaluate my situation and <br/>\nthink about getting out of there while I can, if possible.  My hits don&#39;t <br/>\nseem to change much when I enter berzerker either, can&#39;t say that for the <br/>\nmobs though.  They hit me twice as hard with almost every hit when they get <br/>\ndown to one bubble, very annoying to loose one bubble of hp for most of the <br/>\nfight and then two bubbles while you are just finishing them off.  Hey, If <br/>\nthere is any stradegy to using it please let me know,,,,, I really want to, <br/>\nbut can&#39;t figure out how......need every bit of help I can get  8)<br/>\n<br/>\nArathorne, Solsek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
