It&#39;s very<br/>\ninexpensive to buy an Elm bow from another fletcher,<br/>\nshould cost you 5-6pp.  Pick Hemp string for more<br/>\ndamage, Silk string for more speed (lower delay);<br/>\nefficiency ratios for either work out the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way I found to work archery up is to hang out<br/>\nwhere other groups are fighting mobs that&#39;re blue+ to<br/>\nyou; and shoot into their fights.  I&#39;ve never had<br/>\nanyone mind; there&#39;s no way an archer will killsteal<br/>\nlike this, and it helps make the fight easier for the<br/>\ngroup tanking it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPulling is much easier with a bow, let me tell you.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
