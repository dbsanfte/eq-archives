We<br/>\nwaited and waited and killed spider after spider, but no giant heart spider<br/>\nhad spawned...i finally thought to myself that maybe it was because i had<br/>\nthe chitin shell sheild already equipped so after we killed the spawn i ran<br/>\noff to a different room to heal up. Well when the next spider spawned it WAS<br/>\nthe Giant heart spider and we then got the sheild. So i say that the code<br/>\ncould be working in two ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. No one can hang around the spot that the MOB spawns.<br/>\n2. No one that has the item that the MOB drops can hang around where the MOB<br/>\nspawns.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps you figure it out.<br/>\nJohn Zwanenburg<br/>\nTips Support/Support Sipt<br/>\nTel: (613) 998-2745<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tTom Swift[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tThursday, June 03, 1999 1:40 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Camping<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I have it on good authoriry that anti-camping code was implemented in the<br/>\n&gt; last patch and I need some help to confirm it.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; There is a detection zone around spawn points which EQ checks before<br/>\n&gt; spawning a creature.  If the area is camped the spawn will be delayed, so<br/>\n&gt; a creature will spawn...just not as often.  If the special item the NPC<br/>\n&gt; carries is present in the zone then the NPC will not spawn with it.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I have been trying to get a shiny brass shield for the last 2 weeks or so.<br/>\n&gt; The trainer never seems to have...I have heard this as well from people<br/>\n&gt; who are camping the spot to twink guild mates.  Oddly enough there is<br/>\n&gt; almost always a shiny shield within striking distance of the trainers<br/>\n&gt; spawn point.  I have heard others on this list mention that they could not<br/>\n&gt; get a BBC no matter how long they waited....I am wondering if they had<br/>\n&gt; another BBC in the group they were camping with?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; This code is a good start for reducing camping.  Because it was done<br/>\n&gt; quietly there is not a big &quot;Hoopla&quot; of campers complaining, they are<br/>\n&gt; simply not seeing anything spawn.  This could also explain the rumors that<br/>\n&gt; the Tommy no longer spawns.  because almost always the campers there have<br/>\n&gt; 3+ tommys in the group.  It is going to be a long time before word gets<br/>\n&gt; around though so you aren&#39;t going to see some of the popularly camped<br/>\n&gt; items for awhile.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Anyone who can offer information confirming or denying this rumor won&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt; rewarded.  But I am sure they will earn the admiration and gratitude of<br/>\n&gt; the rest of the people on this list.....well maybe just the gratitude at<br/>\n&gt; least.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Bael<br/>\n&gt; Warrior of the 16th Order<br/>\n&gt; Indigo Brotherhood<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
