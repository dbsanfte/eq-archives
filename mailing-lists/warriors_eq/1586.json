I found it much easier to get items and such once I joined<br/>\nmy guild because of the level mix, but before I joined I had to really<br/>\nplan out what I could afford, where to hunt, etc. Some things like<br/>\nbronze can be bought by going to zones where the upper level folk go and<br/>\njust hang out because some times they are getting a little overweight<br/>\nand don&#39;t want to leave their hunting spot. Things like that should also<br/>\nbe mentioned. Prices for bronze items oyi.. if you are getting large<br/>\nseems to be lower but that medium will be a higher prices since it can<br/>\nbe worn by more races.  Small sizes are of course cheaper. I&#39;m not a<br/>\ngood one for attaining prices from since most of my armor has been gifts<br/>\n(crafted *drools* all from trades and my char&#39;s wedding gifts)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTrent Carroll wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  Excellent, just the type of info was looking for.  How would I<br/>\n&gt; determine level base for items?  Would it be level they could be/have<br/>\n&gt; been purchased at.  Average pricing I can definitely do.  I could<br/>\n&gt; allow people to submit how much they paid for an item and on what<br/>\n&gt; server so that you can even get an average for the server you play<br/>\n&gt; on.  Would something similar for level work?  Let people input what<br/>\n&gt; level they obtained an item at and create an average?Everyone out<br/>\n&gt; there:  What would your dream site for items be?
