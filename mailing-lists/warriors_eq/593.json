Batlle Axe <br/>\ncouse it does a wooping 8dmg/35delay and with my secondary wepon I&#39;ll prob. <br/>\nuse a Fine Steel Long Sword OR a barbed whip OR a combine long sword.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S Could someone please tellme the specs. on the Fine Stell Long Sword, <br/>\nCombine Long Sword and Barbed Whip?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  How do you check my skill in sta. and how do I get that skill up.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S I also found that using kick often in a row draws your sta. down, but if <br/>\nyou use bash is dosn&#39;t seem to bring sta. down as much as kick.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve just got Perry skill and put 3 skill points into it.  Is this <br/>\nautomatic and I&#39;ve never seen it been used.  Is this skill even working and <br/>\nis the skill going up?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve just gotten Blacken Armor and replaced it with my banded and ringmail <br/>\narmor!  Man, the weight is so much lighter and the AC is much more better!  <br/>\nI suggest any lvl 12+ people go to the RiverVale area hunt though goblines <br/>\nand get that armor! + is looks so cool!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
