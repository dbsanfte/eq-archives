If you say so.  I call Paladins &#39;self-filling tanks&#39;,<br/>\nbecause they are just that.  They&#39;re not really effective until they<br/>\nget Meditate at 12th, but once there they can do a solo fight that<br/>\ndrags them down to 1 bar of HP; and be back in another fight in 7-10<br/>\nmins.  For a corresponding warrior, it would be 13-18 mins, or more.<br/>\n<br/>\nLay On Hands is the Panic Button; you can push it to get out of jail,<br/>\nor at least, have more time to either finish off the mob or run for<br/>\nsafety. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the spells being 9 levels behind, so?  Paladins are<br/>\nfighter/healers, while Clerics are healer/fighters.  Clerics can be<br/>\nmini-tanks up until about 9th or 10th; but Paladins can tank all the<br/>\nway to 50.  The ability to tank and still have a reserve to compliment<br/>\nthe party&#39;s cleric is useful.  Past 10th, Clerics are 80%+ casters for<br/>\nall realistic intents and purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladins don&#39;t get Kick; but at 6th they get bash which I personally<br/>\nlike much better.  Kick won&#39;t interrupt casting, while Bash will.  I<br/>\nstopped using Kick with my Troll Warrior when I got Bash (which let my<br/>\nSlam start being much more effective)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re fixated on Dual Wield (which I think you might be, since you<br/>\nmentioned Rangers; and they&#39;re the only hybrid, that I recall, that<br/>\ngets Dual Wield); that might explain why you like Warriors and Rangers<br/>\nthe most.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think the jury&#39;s still out on Dual Wield, and on melee in<br/>\ngeneral.  The further up you go, the more the offensive and debuff<br/>\nspellcasters really carry the fight to the mobs; the tanks are just<br/>\nthere to do what their name says.  If this is proven out, then Dueal<br/>\nWield or no, the tanks are just there to soak damage.  If this is not<br/>\nproven, then Dual Wield still has to debate against the endless fighter<br/>\narguements of Dual Wield vs 2H Weapons (which is one of those semantic<br/>\narguements, IMO; stats bear each out)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor grouping, I&#39;d prefer to have pure tank in the tank slot, any day of<br/>\nthe week; with a Paladin fighting alongside him.  (my ideal 6man group<br/>\nis 2 Warriors, 1 Paladin, 1 Cleric, 1 Wizard, 1 Bard; haven&#39;t assembled<br/>\nit yet, but it sounds fun!) For soloing, however, the Paladin is more<br/>\nefficient than the Warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
