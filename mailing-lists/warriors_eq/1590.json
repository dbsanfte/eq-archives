I am a proud<br/>\nwarrior of the 40th season on the Quellious plane.  I have seen much, and<br/>\nknow many of the things young warriors can use to get started.  I havent<br/>\nmuch time to devote to doing a site myself, but I can help with some<br/>\nsubmitions.  Much of what was stated concerning best prices, best equipment<br/>\nfor the warriors level, and other such information as well as a true<br/>\n&quot;handbook&quot; for the warrior would be a great assest to the warrior community.<br/>\nI have looked through every class specific site i can find, and only one<br/>\nwarrior site have i seen.  Would be good to have a little competition to get<br/>\nmore information out to us all.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaks<br/>\nStormriders of Quellious<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Trent Carroll [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trent@...\">trent@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, October 17, 1999 10:16 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [warriors_eq] items site?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Wow, this email list still lives!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve got a question for you.  Do you use a site to see what items are<br/>\navailable?  Which one?  How could it be better?  Do you care about news on<br/>\nan items site, or just the items?  Would it need quests listed for quest for<br/>\nitems, entirely, or just starting point?  List of Mob it comes from?<br/>\n<br/>\n  My reason for asking:  I&#39;m thinking about making one, and if I do, I want<br/>\nit to be THE items site to go to.  I&#39;ve actually already got the database<br/>\ndesigned, I just need to work on inputting info and designing the site<br/>\nlayout.  I could have a preview(not all items) up in 2 days or less if I get<br/>\nenough response.<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a>]<br/>\n    Sent: Sunday, October 17, 1999 5:24 AM<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n    Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] One hand or two?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Matt-<br/>\n    I have a 30th level barbarian warrior on Veeshan. I can only tell you<br/>\nwhat I&#39;ve chosen<br/>\n    Max out 1hs, 2hs, taunt, kick, slam/bash  and I am working on archery<br/>\n(this has helped me take down runners).<br/>\n<br/>\n    Some have said take up piercing. When you get duel attack and duel weild<br/>\nonly for the fact that a piercing weapon is faster and will help max these<br/>\nskills out.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I find that 1hs with duel weild is more effective in certain<br/>\ncircumstances and then 2hs in another. 1hs gives you speed of attack. 2hs is<br/>\ngood for greatest impact (recently got a crit hit of 100.. now that was<br/>\nsweet). If you use a 2hs or 1hs will also depend on your group make up. I do<br/>\ncarry all my weapons with me so at times will switch depending on the<br/>\ncircumstance.<br/>\n<br/>\n    All my reading and such have said to keep both maxed out. Some reasons<br/>\nare the performance of the weapon others for the variety of weapons you can<br/>\nuse. I didn&#39;t work on my 2hs until I was at the 28th level and it was very<br/>\npainful to max it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n    Az<br/>\n<br/>\n    Matthew Horne wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n        G&#39;day my name is Kalroth.. a level 7 dwarf warrior on the solusek ro<br/>\nserverMy question is whether one hand or two hand slash is better for a<br/>\nwarrior Hope you can help me , thanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
