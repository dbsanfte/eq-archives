Every battle consists of many decisions that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>may affect the outcome.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yes, I can just see all these vital decisions you make.  Should I cast the <br/>\nweaker DD or the stronger DD?  Should I heal my party members when they get <br/>\ninjured?  Oh the choices...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Next I will normally assist one of the tanks for a few rounds.  It is my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>job<br/>\nto monitor everyone&#39;s HP and heal them up when needed.  If I heal too much<br/>\ntoo soon, I will draw all the critters onto me.  So I must carefully judge<br/>\nwhen and how much to heal.  There is also a choice of who to heal.  Should I<br/>\nheal Tank-A who is it half health but only has one critter on him, or should<br/>\nI heal Tank-B who is at three-quarters health but has three critters on him?<br/>\nMaybe I should wait a few rounds or do I need to heal right now?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also the mark of a good warrior who can judge when to help out a party <br/>\nmember.  If I&#39;m in the middle of combat and I notice my friend losing health <br/>\nat an egregeous rate, I will usually try to jump in an taunt it away.  This <br/>\nis very similar to judging who needs healing and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As soon as I have used some mana, I have another choice.  Should I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>meditate<br/>\nright away or should I continue swinging my staff?  Will I need mana for an<br/>\nextra heal or should I do some immediate damage with combat?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a cleric your job is the cast healing spells.  That is what people expect <br/>\nfrom you.  Nuff said.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Then I have to deal with runners.  Should I Root a runner so a tank can<br/>\n </span></blockquote>finish him off or do I need to finish him myself with Direct Damage?  Can I<br/>\nafford the mana for this or should I chase the runner down myself to finish<br/>\nhim off with combat?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh please.  If you have a monster on the run he&#39;s no longer a threat to <br/>\nanybody so long as he doesn&#39;t get away.  Let the warriors chase it down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Also I must decide when to tank.  Clerics can wear good armor and have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>decent HPs.  I might need to tank a few rounds to save a Wizard or give a<br/>\nWarrior a break.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a particular monster is wiping the floor with your warrior friend, tanking <br/>\nfor him may not be the best idea.  Besides, in this situation, why are you <br/>\nnot healing him, cleric?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Then I think about it from the Warriors point of view.  The Warrior did<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kick, Kick, Kick, Taunt, Kick, Kick, Kick, Taunt, the cleric is getting<br/>\nattacked, switch targets, Kick, Kick, Kick, Taunt, Kick, Kick, Kick, Taunt,<br/>\nrunner rooted by cleric, chase runner down, switch targets, Kick, Kick,<br/>\nKick, Taunt.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne could apply that to any class.  For example: all the cleric does is pull, <br/>\nDD, DD, Heal, Heal, Heal, Heal, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Playing a Warrior doesn&#39;t compare to a Cleric.  As a Warrior, I feel so<br/>\n </span></blockquote>useless.  If the battle is going bad, there is nothing I can do but hope the<br/>\nRandom Number Generator starts falling our way.  All I can do is soak up<br/>\ndamage like a sponge, do more combat damage than everyone else and Taunt<br/>\ncritters off the spellcasters.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the battle is going bad as a cleric, what are you going to do about it?  A <br/>\nbad battle sucks for everyone.  And quite frankly, what so wrong with doing <br/>\nmore combat damage?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A Warrior can learn everything there is to know about his class in one <br/>\n </span></blockquote>day.<br/>\nGaining new levels never changes the strategy a Warrior.  Sure they get dual<br/>\nwield and double attack, but this only increased damage and does nothing to<br/>\nadd new combat choices.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWholly incorrect.  I wonder exactly how high in level you played that warrior <br/>\nto.  I&#39;m thinking not very high.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A Cleric takes a long time to master.  I feel there is much more for me <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\nlearn as a Cleric.  And every 5 levels I get a new set of spells that need<br/>\nto learn to use.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be learning new tricks all the way up to<br/>\nlevel 50 (if I ever get that far).&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in other words getting new spells are the only reason why you feel so <br/>\nstrategic in combat?  Do you honestly think warriors keep the same weapons <br/>\nand armor from levels 1-50?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t misunderstand me.  Tanks are a very needed part of a party.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Spellcasters need Warriors up front to take the blows and deal out the<br/>\ndamage.  Warriors are just not my style.  The limited options during combat<br/>\nare not what I am looking for.  For many of you, the Warrior is perfect.<br/>\nBeing able to stand toe to toe with a critter and doing damage with a sword<br/>\nis exactly what many people want.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs opposed to standing in the back of the party and cast heal spells til the <br/>\ncows come home.  Wheee!  By the way, the options for a warrior are no more <br/>\nlimiting than for a cleric, you just put more thought and care into writing <br/>\nyour post to make it seem that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Verant&#39;s improvements:<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bezerker Frenzy - happens automatically when low on HP&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is already in place, and actually I wish it was something they&#39;d take <br/>\naway.  It does not help me as a warrior.  On the contrary, it hinders me.  My <br/>\nAGI goes down, which makes it more difficult to hit AND to run away.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;More HPs - Lets us take more damage&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A pointless improvement, IMHO.  If I&#39;m solo I already have to spend a very <br/>\nlong time sitting and waiting for my health to come back.  Last thing I need <br/>\nis to have to wait LONGER.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;More Magic Resistance - Better against spellcasters&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is useful, but otherwise dull.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Critical Hits - Randomly more damage&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again useful, but dull.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;These improvements do make Warriors a better class.  But nothing there <br/>\n </span></blockquote>makes<br/>\nme want to play them.  I would consider playing a Warrior if there were more<br/>\nactive skills.  I need a skill that I can choose when to use it, so that it<br/>\nmay make a difference in combat.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy idea was to make Kick and Slam/Bash non-mutually exclusive.  That would <br/>\nhelp a lot, IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Give Warriors something to think about in combat.  Make it so that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>experienced, skillful Warrior can be better than any newbie Warrior.  Give<br/>\nthem some abilities that would take skill to use effectively.  Knowing when<br/>\nto switch Fighting Styles or use Battle Cry would be something an<br/>\nexperienced Warrior could learn to do well.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, had to played a warrior to higher levels to might not think this way.  <br/>\nThen again, considering you have the tenacity to come to a warrior forum and <br/>\nrip our favorite class apart, you might just be stubborn enough to badmouth <br/>\nthe warrior no matter how good you did.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
