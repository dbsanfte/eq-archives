(Not that i enjoy<br/>\ncalling myself names or anything)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my warrior and some friends i attempted to solo a blue sand giant. I<br/>\nhad a cleric of the same level with me and a magician as well ( all level<br/>\n37.) SO i begin the fight and it starts going bad right away. There i am<br/>\nhitting him and seeing his Hp bar drain waaaay slow. I figure i can stand<br/>\nhere and take his punishment maybe 1 minute longer. So my friends step in<br/>\nand heal me up and we take it together quite easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk Then the cleric acts all tough and decides he wants some 1 on 1 action<br/>\nwith a giant for kicks. Ok we say. I stand back with the magician as the<br/>\ncleric proceeds to root / wrath and hit the giant to death. He finished off<br/>\nthe battle with about 1/8th life left mind you but he did kill the damn<br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere you have it. A cleric at level 37 takes on the giant, a warrior of<br/>\nsame level WITH buffs cannot. Not much else can be said. Oh sure i know its<br/>\nlike comparing apples and oranges but hell, doesnt it kinda make you mad.<br/>\nSure he&#39;s got spells but we are WARRIORS the so called masters of combat and<br/>\ndefense. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that troll warrior had it right. This is why ive pretty much put my<br/>\nwarrior on the shelf and been playing with a cleric char. Get this. At level<br/>\n16 with my warrior i would never ever partied solo. never. with my cleric i<br/>\nususally play solo. I get levels faster, cause i can take creatures that con<br/>\neven to me with my cleric. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell thats my 2 cents, take it or leave it but im pretty sure that we all<br/>\nagree that warriors need something from verant to distinguish us from the<br/>\nrest of the classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nLothaniel T&#39;Kazz <br/>\nMighty Tier&#39;dal Warrior of the 37th Rank.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tJames Wofford[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:James.Wofford@...\">James.Wofford@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tThursday, June 10, 1999 2:27 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Cut and Paste form EQ&#39;Lizer<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am not actually board with my character, just tired of waiting for the<br/>\n&gt; goodies to come when they are actually no where to be found.  They will<br/>\n&gt; never get to us, and we are outweighed even in a group setting by other<br/>\n&gt; melee classes.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I am not so concerned about the magic using/healing/gating part of this as<br/>\n&gt; I am the fact that the masters of physical combat (warriors) are anything<br/>\n&gt; but that.  Healing never has been IMO a part of what a warrior can do.<br/>\n&gt; But a warrior is supposed to be the master or armed combat.  When we cap<br/>\n&gt; out at skill level 200 and others can go beyond that as well as do more<br/>\n&gt; damage than us warrior, something is definitely wrong.  I think we should<br/>\n&gt; start a pettition to verant to try to even things out a bit more.  The<br/>\n&gt; suggestions in this post on EQ`Lizer for modifying the Warrior class are<br/>\n&gt; well thought and not too much to ask. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; If anyone else is at all interested in starting a pettition, I will get<br/>\n&gt; things going.  Just let me know and I can get things rolling on it....<br/>\n&gt; Even if you dont respond to me on this, I will get things going anyways.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; \tFrom: Elena Glenn [ mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:braveheart@...\">braveheart@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; \tSent: Thursday, June 10, 1999 11:27 AM<br/>\n&gt; \tTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; \tSubject: [warriors_eq] Cut and Paste form EQ&#39;Lizer<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tJames....I also am getting a little bored with my level 19 Barbarian<br/>\n&gt; Warrior.  One of the reasons, I guess, that I started the Bard.  I do<br/>\n&gt; think that Verant has overlooked us slightly.  When I played Realm, the<br/>\n&gt; warrior on there could buy mana and cast spells.  Agreed, they didn&#39;t work<br/>\n&gt; as well as the mages did, but we still could have the basics.  I would<br/>\n&gt; like to see Verant come up with another plan.  Perhaps some sort of magic<br/>\n&gt; skill, so at the very least, we could gate and cast healing on ourselves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t <br/>\n&gt; \tLeri<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
