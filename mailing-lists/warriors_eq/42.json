So <br/>\nfar I have seen nothing but &quot;Great&quot; information on the list and only hope it <br/>\ngets better.  Keep getting the word out, tell your friends or post on <br/>\nwarrior message boards.  The more information we get the better.  Warriors <br/>\nare the best class, we just have to work a little harder to keep up with the <br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a level 11 barbarian warrior princess (some might say an Amazon!) <br/>\ncurrently hunting in Clan Crushbone on Bristlebane.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have added the links found in warriors_eq email to onelist.com.  You can <br/>\nview or add your own links by going to www.onelist.com, signing in, and <br/>\nclicking on the warriors_eq list.  Here you will find a bunch of options, <br/>\none of them being &quot;bookmarks.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I plan to us two combine long swords when I get to level 15.  <br/>\nNot because I know any better, but because it looks so cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of Rallos Zek;<br/>\n<br/>\nPatty of Halas<br/>\nusername: Patricia<br/>\nserver: Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
