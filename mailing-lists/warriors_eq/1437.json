Now either i was unluckly or i am way under equipped (lvl 30, pgt<br/>\n+ dirk, bronze armour) but i was whipped...i actually got the warlord to<br/>\nrun, and chased him a bit...but the elite was hitting me still, and i<br/>\njust managed to zone without killing either with only 2 hps left.<br/>\n<br/>\nso my question is this...should i have killed the elite first, which is<br/>\na green crit? or was staying on the warlord the best thing?<br/>\n<br/>\ni guess it might depend on my ultimate goal...and my goal then was to<br/>\njust kill the damn warlord...as i had to goto work in 5 mins...if i had<br/>\nmore time, maybe i should have killed elite, zoned to rest and gone back<br/>\nfor warlord...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut im getting off my question here...if solo, should you take out the<br/>\nhardest crit first or weakest?<br/>\n<br/>\nDandrak, Karana (lvl 30)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
