If you know<br/>\n&gt;the stats on it, they suck, and I could care less about the lifetap effect.<br/>\n&gt;The replacement weapon must do magic damage.  What is a decent piercing or<br/>\n&gt;1h slashing weapon for 200plat or less.  I would be willing to switch to a<br/>\n&gt;1h blunt weapon but would prefer not to.  Due to my race I will most likely<br/>\n&gt;be purchasing in the commonlands, Oasis, or Ro.  I will not be traveling to<br/>\n&gt;any of the other continents.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How much do blackened boots go for BTW?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kindrael<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!
