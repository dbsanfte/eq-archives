They will<br/>\nnever get to us, and we are outweighed even in a group setting by other<br/>\nmelee classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not so concerned about the magic using/healing/gating part of this as I<br/>\nam the fact that the masters of physical combat (warriors) are anything but<br/>\nthat.  Healing never has been IMO a part of what a warrior can do.  But a<br/>\nwarrior is supposed to be the master or armed combat.  When we cap out at<br/>\nskill level 200 and others can go beyond that as well as do more damage than<br/>\nus warrior, something is definitely wrong.  I think we should start a<br/>\npettition to verant to try to even things out a bit more.  The suggestions<br/>\nin this post on EQ`Lizer for modifying the Warrior class are well thought<br/>\nand not too much to ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone else is at all interested in starting a pettition, I will get<br/>\nthings going.  Just let me know and I can get things rolling on it....  Even<br/>\nif you dont respond to me on this, I will get things going anyways.<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Elena Glenn [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:braveheart@...\">braveheart@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, June 10, 1999 11:27 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [warriors_eq] Cut and Paste form EQ&#39;Lizer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  James....I also am getting a little bored with my level 19 Barbarian<br/>\nWarrior.  One of the reasons, I guess, that I started the Bard.  I do think<br/>\nthat Verant has overlooked us slightly.  When I played Realm, the warrior on<br/>\nthere could buy mana and cast spells.  Agreed, they didn&#39;t work as well as<br/>\nthe mages did, but we still could have the basics.  I would like to see<br/>\nVerant come up with another plan.  Perhaps some sort of magic skill, so at<br/>\nthe very least, we could gate and cast healing on ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Leri</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
