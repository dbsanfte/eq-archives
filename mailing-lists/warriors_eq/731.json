Remember, the problem with camping is the &#39;farmers&#39;.  If<br/>\nyou rnot sure that Tommy&#39;s gonna show up anytime soon, chances are you ar<br/>\negoing to get bored and move on.  By randomizing the loot, you actually<br/>\nremove the desire to just sit and wait.  Of course, if you want to sit for 4<br/>\ndays waiting for that one time the Tommy shows up, be my guest, but I would<br/>\ncall that a bit obsessive-compulsive .<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat randomizing loot will do is make it unproductive to try and go and get<br/>\nsuch and such item.  The game becomes less of a pursuit of gaining items,<br/>\nand more of a pursuit of gaining adventures.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jason Coan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 25, 1999 3:38 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [warriors_eq] Camping, a solution<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou do of course realize that there would be no way to hunt for the<br/>\nparticular item you are looking for, right?  ie, a 35th lvl item, one that a<br/>\n35th lvl monster drops, ie rubicite bracers.  So lets concider where all you<br/>\nwould have to go to look for this item<br/>\n<br/>\nKaranas- could be any of the griffins or giants<br/>\noasis-could be one of the spectres or giants<br/>\ns ro-could be on one of the giants<br/>\ne commons-could be on a griffin<br/>\nw commons-could be on a giant or griffin<br/>\ncazic thule-could be on any number of monsters there<br/>\nmistmoore-could be on any number of monsters there<br/>\nsoulsekB-could be on any number of monsters there<br/>\nbefallen-it could conceivably spawn on commander windstream<br/>\n<br/>\nso would it make since to go to all these places to look for a particular<br/>\nitem, or would you just find a pretty safe place to camp and wait to see<br/>\nwhat item spawned on one of the creatures that you are camping?  I would<br/>\nthink your odds of finding &quot;random&quot; items like this would be equal if you<br/>\ncamped one spot, or if you traveled to various zones.  Doesn&#39;t seem like<br/>\nthis would promote adventuring.  And it would take FOREVER to actually get<br/>\nan item you want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Jynxx&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jynxx@...\">Jynxx@...</a>&gt; 5.25.99 3:11:43 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Jynxx&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jynxx@...\">Jynxx@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYES!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\nThat&#39;s what we need! A random item spawn.....I&#39;ll even take it one step<br/>\nfurther:<br/>\nLets say that said sword is on a level 45 person...so we&#39;ll call that a<br/>\n&#39;level 45 item&#39; it can then spawn to any level 45+ NPC in all of the zone,<br/>\nor even norrath. That would make people have to travel A LOT to find items<br/>\nthey want, and would completely prevent camping for items altogether. That<br/>\nway if you really wanted an item bad enough, your group had to go search for<br/>\nit...not just sit sround and wait for it....that to me is not even<br/>\nrole-playing.<br/>\nJust my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nTyveris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking to expand your world?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\nONElist has over 150,000 e-mail communities from which to chose!<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n                      Free Games, Cash Prizes!<br/>\n            Gamesville - World&#39;s Biggest Game Show Site!<br/>\n                <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n<br/>\n=======================================================<br/>\nThis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.
