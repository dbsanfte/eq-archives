If you can get some sort of weapon that does magic damage you can<br/>\nstart taking out wisps around level 8 if you have a partner.  I fight these<br/>\nin the commonlands.  If you can&#39;t afford a weapon that does magic damage,<br/>\nfind a magician and pay him to conjure up a dagger for you.  I took my necro<br/>\nand a friends mage at level 8 and we have been killing wisps as our primary<br/>\nstaple.  They usually drop at least a gold, they also drop lightstones(8<br/>\ngold) and greater lightstones(3.6).  As level 8 characters we pulled at<br/>\nleast 40 plat in five ours of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 12-?, grouped<br/>\nIn Southern Ro there are a few Derv camps.  There&#39;s also some in North Ro<br/>\nand West commonlands.  Dervs range from about level 9 to 14, so you will<br/>\nwant to be grouped.  They drop some change around maybe a gold or so.  They<br/>\nalso drop rings pretty often which can be sold for about two gold a piece.<br/>\n75% when they have weapons they are bronze weapons which sell for 2-4 plat<br/>\neach.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 12 solo<br/>\nThere are some Lizardman warriors and mystics which spawn outside of the<br/>\nTemple of Cazic Thule.  The carry some loose change.  Their tails sell for 4<br/>\ngold, I believe.  They also drop bronze weapons and mystic dolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nKindrael</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
