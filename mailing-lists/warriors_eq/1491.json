I love <br/>\ndual wield but evryone keeps telling me I should buy a Blackened Iron <br/>\nbastard sword.  Sure i thinbk that weapon is great, but i like going fast.  <br/>\nAnyone have an opinion on what i should choose?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, i ran into a player whom decided to make a warrior instead of use his <br/>\nlvl 27 paladin or something like that.  He tought me how dex and agl was the <br/>\nway to go for him instead of str.  So he put all his points into those <br/>\ninstead of str.  I am thinking of only getting items that increse agl and <br/>\ndex, so i can be an excellent tank. sure the str might not be up, but you <br/>\nwill be fast and very hard to hit.  This is just what he told me and I <br/>\nthought it was neat..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDubas of the 19th rank.<br/>\nMith. Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
