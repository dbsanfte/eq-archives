You<br/>\nwill be able to get 1 PGT, or 1 Painbringer, but not two of each.  Also<br/>\nGhoulsbane is Paladin only so you won&#39;t be able to even get one of those.<br/>\nStart working on your piercing right now and get a Dragoon Dirk, they are<br/>\nbetter than a combine longsword.  I was able to take out Dvinn with a level<br/>\n19 enchanter and get my Dragoon Dirk instead of buying it (I was level 20)<br/>\nbut you can buy one for around 20 plat.  At level 21 I haven&#39;t seen my<br/>\nstrength bonus yet.  I have been hitting for the occasional 14 since level<br/>\n17 though with a combine longsword.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may need to check your numbers though.  I have a 110 in Double attack<br/>\nand dual wield.  I double attack maybe 75-80% of the time and dual wield<br/>\nhappens maybe 30%, so 44-48 dmg per round is probably not correct.   You<br/>\nreally should spend the money now for another combine weapon though.  You<br/>\ncan solo scarecrows at your level with two magical weapons.  Also if you<br/>\nplay a large race the magical slam is one of the best skills a warrior can<br/>\nhave.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngarth Bladedancer, Warrior of the 21st Tier<br/>\n&quot;Periissem ni periisem&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tDean Boyle[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gino_14@...\">gino_14@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tWednesday, July 14, 1999 8:15 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] What weapons to use??<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Dean Boyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gino_14@...\">gino_14@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hail to thee, I am of the 17th level and right now i duel Weild a Combine <br/>\n&gt; Long Sword and a Fine Steel Long sword (both same stats).  Right now I do <br/>\n&gt; about 24 each hand and since I am already maxed my level out in duel<br/>\n&gt; weild, <br/>\n&gt; double attack and 1h slashing, I duel and double attack almost every hit.<br/>\n&gt; so <br/>\n&gt; thast about 44-48 dmg per round.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve always herd at high levels that you not only hit for 12 (sometimes<br/>\n&gt; 13) <br/>\n&gt; but more... I&#39;ve never seen this happen to me, when will I start hitting<br/>\n&gt; for <br/>\n&gt; more?  Whast going on with this area?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; double combine long swords are great, but I need some advise...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think when I hit lvl 20, I&#39;m going to upgrade my weaponry.<br/>\n&gt; Do I go for some PGT&#39;s or shold I try and go for some Painbringers or<br/>\n&gt; should <br/>\n&gt; I even go for soem gnoulbanes? (BTW I am going to duel weild and want 2x<br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; weapon)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; at lvl 20, what will be the idle and most level area weapon can I even<br/>\n&gt; get?? <br/>\n&gt;              Thnx for your time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dealan<br/>\n&gt; Of the 17th level<br/>\n&gt; Karana<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; See homepage for details, including our weekly drawing!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
