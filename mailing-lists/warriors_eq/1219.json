The assumption being that the kick of<br/>\nbash could potentiall be the critical hit. As a warrior you are going to<br/>\nalways try and do the most damage you can.  With &quot;critical hit&quot; skill it<br/>\ndepends on how skilled you are is how often you succeed.  Kicking an orc in<br/>\nthe gonads qualifies as a critical hit. Also, you said that you would &quot;know&quot;<br/>\nwhen the right time for a critical hit is.....how could you know that?  I am<br/>\nnot sure what you mean by this.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to reiterate. I think the critical hit skill should be checked<br/>\nautomatically against each and every strike.  The percentage chance for a<br/>\ncritical hit is proportionate to the skill level.  It would be something<br/>\nlike dodge/parry/riposte I think, though I am not sure how those checks are<br/>\ncalculated.  The damage caused by this strike should be based on the weapon<br/>\nyou are using, perhaps the damage rating x 2.  So a longsword would be 12<br/>\npoints (6 dmg?) and a 2 handed sword would be 24 (12 dmg).  The end result<br/>\nof this skill is that warriors become the masters of melee.  We still will<br/>\nnever do as much damage per round as a mage of the same level, but we will<br/>\nbe more desirable as a melee class than the hybrids.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I have finally thought of a complete solution I am going to submit<br/>\nthis is as feedback just to dispute all the proposals I don&#39;t agree with.  I<br/>\nwill still participate in our petition of course, once we all agree on a<br/>\nsolution.

Here are<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;points I made<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1)  Make it a skill the player has to invoked.  The reasoning behind<br/>\n&gt;this is you will see an opportunity when you can hit the creature for<br/>\n&gt;more damage.<br/>\n&gt; 2)  Make it recyclable, akin to the rogues backstab.  You would not<br/>\n&gt;be able to critcally hit and kick or bash in the same round.<br/>\n&gt;            3)  Make it start at level 20, and only work with the first<br/>\n&gt;weapon skill that reaches the point of &#39;master&#39;.  This would resemble a<br/>\n&gt;specialization in that weapons category.<br/>\n&gt;            4) Damage:  Make damage akin to the rogues backstab,  something<br/>\n&gt;like the skill divided by 2.  So that at level 20 you would get 20 points<br/>\n&gt;into critical strike.  On a successful strike, you would cause 10 points of<br/>\n&gt;damage.  When your skill is 60, you would be doing 30 damage for a<br/>\n&gt;successful strike.  If peope think this is too much, start the skill at 1<br/>\n&gt;point instead of 20.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This one skill would go long in making the warrior more viable with the<br/>\n&gt;hybrid classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Angarth, Warrior of the 17th Tier<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Periissem ni periisem&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Andrew Palmer[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:apalmer@...\">apalmer@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Reply To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Friday, June 11, 1999 10:00 PM<br/>\n&gt;&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Warriors vs Hybrids<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Andrew Palmer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:apalmer@...\">apalmer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I would like to start this off by saying that this is not against you at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; all.

I don&#39;t have much of an issue<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; warriors vs wizards. They traded hps, ac, and melee ability for high<br/>\n&gt;&gt; damage<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; dealing spells. However it appears I agree with many of you that is is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; hybrids that appear to have a distinct advantage over us. The hybrid<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that has<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the most advantage appears to be the ranger. For various reasons I find<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I am<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; unable to group with the people I normally play with. I am unable to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; solo many<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mobs even in the blue and green range, and really I have more fun in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; groups. I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; have been traveling to many zones shouting that I am looking for a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; group, but to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; no avail. It appears to me that many groups are prefering rangers over<br/>\n&gt;&gt; warriors,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and after I read the post on EQ&#39;Lizer I began to realize why.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Advantages Warriors get over Rangers:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; - We get Dual Wield and Double Attack at 2 levels lower than Rangers,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; but after<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a few levels they are back on par with us in the damage dealing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; department. So<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; as Wayne Sheppard wrote, &quot;the Warrior has no skill advantage over the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; hybrids.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Your wrong on this 2 levels no.. Yes rangers get duel weild and double<br/>\n&gt;&gt; attack but duel weild comes at level 17 and Double Attack Comes at level<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 20. I really never have had a problem with a ranger having this ability<br/>\n&gt;&gt; let them have it more fun in the game. Not like rangers are master<br/>\n&gt;&gt; casters.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -Warriors get more hit points. This only appears to be true for the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; larger races<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and rangers easily overcome this by being able to heal themselves, thus<br/>\n&gt;&gt; actually<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; taking more pressure off of the cleric to heal them.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hrm well I have no idea what parties everyone travels with but the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>parties<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; i am with people buff me up also.

I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; would<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rather not get hit more often when I am low on hp. It makes us die that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; much<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; quicker.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; This i can agree with most of the time when you hit frenzy mode you are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; basically dead anyways<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Advantages Rangers have over Warriors:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -Rangers get foraging. Not much of advantage in combat, but they can<br/>\n&gt;&gt; help keep<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the party supplied with food without any mana cost. They can also carry<br/>\n&gt;&gt; more<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; loot since they don&#39;t have to carry lots of food. They just forage on<br/>\n&gt;&gt; demand.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; If you want foraging become a wood elf warrior. ALL wood elfs i belive<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have the foraging skill I know for fact wood elf warriors have forage.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -Rangers get Hiding and Sneak. This allows the rangers to live longer<br/>\n&gt;&gt; because<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; they can avoid more of the deadlier Mobs that would target a warrior.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Again wood elf warriors have this also<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -Rangers get the very useful skill of Tracking. This is a great<br/>\n&gt;&gt; advantage to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; groups because the rangers make the best fetches. They party can heal<br/>\n </span></blockquote>up<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rest adn stay organized while the rangers are out searching for prey.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; This means<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the party spends less down time and can fight more.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Rangers should have tracking they are a ranger. And yes they can heal up<br/>\n&gt;&gt; but their healing isnt the best in the game it only cuts downtime by a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; bit.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -Rangers cast spells. They not only get some minor healing spells, but<br/>\n&gt;&gt; also are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; able to do root spells, direct damage spells, so they can kick, attack,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and cast<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; spells doing more damage than us. They also get spells that are useful<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; entire party like camoflage and SOW allowing the party to travel more<br/>\n&gt;&gt; safely.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Ok boy i seem like a flamer but again. If you want spells play a ranger<br/>\n&gt;&gt; warriors should not have spells. and as ranger spell damage. Look at the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; spells<br/>\n&gt;&gt; level 9 - Flame lick (uhm more like lame lick) it does a whole WOPPING 5<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   points of damage. Boy that sure deals a lot<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Level 15 - Lighting. At level 15 it is a slower spell to cast it does do<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    25 points of damage MAX. And it burns through mana quickly<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; And we do get spells beyond this. As for camoflage well yes rangers<br/>\n </span></blockquote>should<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; be able to cast this spell seeing they are one of the best at knowing the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; lands<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Changes:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; - I like the idea of eliminating the skill cap of 200 and giving us a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; bonus in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; combat related skills.
