Oh,<br/>\n&gt;and yes, I have a very good clue about game balance.  Right now, it is out<br/>\n&gt;of balance, otherwise we would have warriors being able to solo just as<br/>\n&gt;easily as Mages, Necros, Rangers and the like.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And you still don&#39;t understand.  EQ was not designed for solo play.<br/>\nEventually every class will have to group to be effective.  Some classes<br/>\nlike the warrior end up not being able to solo at an earlier level.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t argue for enhanced solo capabilities.  Brad wanted a game where people<br/>\nbenefited from working together.  He wanted to make solo play hard, if not<br/>\nimpossible, especially at higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
