Ever thought of a trade skill? You are at a good point<br/>\nnow to be able to support most any of them. I won&#39;t get into those here.<br/>\n<br/>\nTip one:<br/>\nBind Wound - get it, use it ... it will save you many minutes of sitting on<br/>\nyour butt later as you get higher and higer amounts of hit points. It will<br/>\nonly get you up to half life, but that&#39;s a long way when you zoned out with<br/>\na sliver of red and you have no healer type with you. It will also reduce<br/>\nthe bitching you will receive from your group members for always having to<br/>\nwait on your slow healing rate (when in actuality you have twice their hit<br/>\npoints). A few points will really jump start this skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nTip two:<br/>\nAlcohol Tolerance - It helps reduce the negative effects of alcohol. Since<br/>\nalcohol will pump your strength and stamina (? I think), then this will<br/>\nsignificantly help you in fights. The downside of alchol, reduced agility<br/>\nand the wobble/vision things are supposed to be much reduced, or even not<br/>\npresent as your skill gets higher. I have not done much with this skill but<br/>\nthere was a post to this group a while back. Maybe someone can repost it. I<br/>\nthink the sender included what benefits he saw at different levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nTip three:<br/>\nAny other skill that is used heavily that you may not have already trained<br/>\nup in, including; swimming, sense direction, and secondary weapon skills<br/>\nthat you might need for emergencies.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nRosmorte (aka Faderic)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Greetings,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, just turned 18 *tee heee legal*. I haven&#39;t trained in any skill<br/>\n&gt; since my duals... Next specialty comes at 25.. going to save 20 training<br/>\n&gt; points for that. Any other suggestions as to what I should put my<br/>\n&gt; training points into?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; OH! btw.. can anyone tell me anything about permafrost can&#39;t find a map<br/>\n&gt; for the life of me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Azlana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
