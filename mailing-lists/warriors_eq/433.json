You can&#39;t see JACK in the dark and none of your stats<br/>\nare particularly great but then if you grouped with an ogre warrior from first<br/>\nfight through till you hit level 30 he would probably still be on level 25 or<br/>\nso.  its a BIG deal at higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nschlaban yocksovik wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;schlaban yocksovik&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anonymaste@...\">anonymaste@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; HI.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was wondering if anyone know what class is the fastest to advance levels<br/>\n&gt; in.<br/>\n&gt; I know erudites for example get less xp then other races.<br/>\n&gt; How about darkelves? they get more or less xp?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And also, does the god you worship affect xp?<br/>\n&gt; I know it affects the overall diff, on the game but does it affect xp?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Would be logical that if you decide to worship the prince of hate, wich will<br/>\n&gt; increase the game diff alot, you should get more xp, is this how it works?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know some of you dont want this info...so if anyone knows the answer,<br/>\n&gt; tag the mail with spoiler hehe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; thanx<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Vashi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
