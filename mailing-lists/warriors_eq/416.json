The giant heart<br/>\nspider, which dropped the shield, wasn&#39;t that bad, but was a very rare<br/>\nspawn.  The majority of the time a large heart spider spawns, and is much<br/>\ntougher than the giant which has the shield.  We had a couple really close<br/>\ncalls with it.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend trying it unles you have a party that<br/>\ncan heal and you&#39;re pretty high up there in levels because of the mobs of<br/>\nspiders and the intensity of the poison.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to ya<br/>\n<br/>\nNick</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
