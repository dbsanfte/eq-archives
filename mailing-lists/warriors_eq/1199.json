Again, on the Bertoxx <br/>\nserver.  I left Neriak at level 3, and traveled to the land of Faydwer.  I <br/>\ngot an invis, and ran to CB cave, hopping to raise my faction enough to allow <br/>\nme into the city.  Alas, I am now level 12, and I have recently been informed <br/>\nthat I can NEVER change the faction with the elves.  Somewhat upset, I <br/>\narranged for an invis to the dwarven lands, in hopes of acceptance there.  <br/>\nBut, as the time for my departure drew near, I ambandoned leaving, refusing <br/>\nto belive nothing could be done.  So, I decided to start a petition of sorts <br/>\nto help change this.  So, what I propose is that they allow me to change my <br/>\nfaction standings, just make it take a while.  I know humans are not looked <br/>\nupon as the greatest of friends to the elves, so let&#39;s say that it takes 200 <br/>\norc kills for them to go from one fac level to the next.  So, make if 400 <br/>\norcs for me to go from one to the next.  Or maybe more like 600.  Make it <br/>\nhard, but not impossable.  Anyway, I ask you to sent them feedback asking for <br/>\nthis, because I would like to be able to walk outside without a guard walking <br/>\nby and killing me.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
