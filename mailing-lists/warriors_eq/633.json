It is insanely easy to play <br/>\n&gt;there.  I made level 5 in about 3.5 hours.  Then I stopped and tried a wood <br/>\n&gt;elf ranger.  Has anyone else played a ranger?  I imagine it is the most <br/>\n&gt;poorly balanced of all the hybrids.  After 4 hours I reached level 5 and <br/>\n&gt;got kick.  I am now 12-18 hours into the character and almost level 9.  I <br/>\n&gt;am just as capable as an equivalent warrior.  Next level I gain an array of <br/>\n&gt;spells which will boost my combat effectiveness and allow me to heal.  Part <br/>\n&gt;of the easy success is the plethora of low level orcs available a stone&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;throw from Kelethin.  With my tracking ability I am never at a loss for <br/>\n&gt;targets and I can engage blue con orcs in rapid succession or even 2 at a <br/>\n&gt;time. I can even engage and successfully beat yellow con orcs more than 50% <br/>\n&gt;of the time and almost always can kill orcs that con even to me without <br/>\n&gt;trouble. So far it seems that I get as many hit points now as my warrior <br/>\n&gt;did.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My point is, with a ranger class as powerful a combatant as it is I see <br/>\n&gt;little necessity for the pure warrior.  I am going to play through to level <br/>\n&gt;15 I think, just to see a more even comparison.  My concern is only from a <br/>\n&gt;game mechanics perspective though as I have no doubt my playing as a dark <br/>\n&gt;elf was a much more rewarding experience.  Has anyone else noticed that the <br/>\n&gt;warrior just is not different enough from the hybrid fighter classes?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bael                                                    Aelyn<br/>\n&gt;Warrior of the 15th Order      or              Ranger of the 8th Rank<br/>\n&gt;Indigo Brotherhood                                Humble Servant of Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;still undecided<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
