I&#39;ve had an interesting experience while being partied with a friend<br/>\nwho plays a rogue. Most of the group has problems with the tough mobs and will<br/>\ndie if it starts attacking the party .... except for the rogue.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an example. While doing the screaming mace quest we were camped in the<br/>\ntower of Crushbone waiting for Emperor Crush to arrive. Assured that Ambassador<br/>\nDvinn was at the zone killing newbies, we continued to wait without any concern.<br/>\nSuddenly Crush spawns ... no problem, we begin the whacking. Then, about 3 or 4<br/>\nseconds later, Dvinn spawns. Wham Wham Wham, one down ... etc until 5 party<br/>\nmembers were dead, none even made it past the throne.<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept for the rogue who sat there plain as day, probably messing herself from<br/>\nthe fear. He never touched her, and in fact conned to her as indifferent I<br/>\nbelieve. She was able to do corpse retrievals for some of us as we all waited at<br/>\nthe zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoooooo, I think as long as the mob is dubious or auto-attack toward everyone in<br/>\nyour group, then yes, he will kill the whole group. I guess it pays to take a<br/>\ndark elf or rogue along with you at times.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Rosmorte (aka Faderic)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTom Swift wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Tom Swift&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As a side note.  If one of your group is engaged on combat by and<br/>\n&gt; mob...named or not....then once your party member is dead the mob will come<br/>\n&gt; after the next closest party member and so on till all are dead or zoned, or<br/>\n&gt; you kill the mob.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When a giant attacks a party member...first thing I do is DISBAND! Same goes<br/>\n&gt; for anything that can wipe out the whole party.  We disband and then regroup<br/>\n&gt; when the danger is passed. Then the whole party doesn&#39;t have to run to zone<br/>\n&gt; to regroup which can save considerable time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This can upset some people so it is best to make sure everyone understands<br/>\n&gt; before it happens.  To many people die becuase giants can destroy a party<br/>\n&gt; before anyone realizes the trouble.  90+  damage per hit makes short work of<br/>\n&gt; most players especially after being stunned.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
