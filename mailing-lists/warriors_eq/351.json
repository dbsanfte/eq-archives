Personally I chose to power level from 12 to 20 killing gators in oasis, didn&#39;t make a dime, actually lost money due to having to buy food and water.  But once I hit 20, I went to some better places where the money is great.  Now I&#39;m 28th lvl and have more money than I know what to do with.  In fact I just bought a 250pp bow, spent 100pp for a SBH for a buddy of mine, spent antother 100pp equiping a buddy who lost his body and GMs refused to help, and I&#39;m still sitting on enough for a couple pieces of real plate, and looking to spend another 400-500pp on a couple tommys.  My point is, at 14th lvl, I know of nowhere to go make GREAT money, so if you can just bear to be poor for another 6 levels (which go fast killing gators), you&#39;ll be strong enough to go fight stuff that dropps several plat at a time....at which point you&#39;ll be quickly equip yourself then wonder &quot;where to I spend all this money?&quot; :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a>&gt; 5.19.99 12:53:01 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Greetings,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Currently 14th level Barbarian Warrior.
