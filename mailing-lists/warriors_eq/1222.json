I prefer swords, but got the Halberd because it was easier.  Befallen was plagued by newbies falling down the well and starting nasty trains of necromancers and I am unfamiliar with Runnyeye. It is completely empty most of the time, and no place to explore without a full party and guide.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you know the details of getting the blackened iron bastard sword and are willing to become part of party to obtain it, I will give you my share of the loot obtained on the trip.  I have others I can recruit for the trip so we could have a full party.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nBael<br/>\nWarrior of the Indigo Brotherhood<br/>\nArm of Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
