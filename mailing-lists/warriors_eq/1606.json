Constant killing in the blue region<br/>\nand little downtime.  Dont get me wrong, I find great satisfaction in<br/>\nsoloing a yellow or red, or even one in a group but the time it takes to do<br/>\nthis and the long rest after cant justify the extra bit of exp you would<br/>\nrecieve.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the upper level warriors of this list will agree, after 15 or so, it<br/>\nalmost becomes compltely neccesary to group with atleast one other<br/>\nnon-warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got a question for my fellow warriors out there.  Has anyone actually<br/>\nfigured out how expierence is split in a group?  I&#39;ve heard tons of theories<br/>\nbut not found proof of any.  One theory is that each monster has a certain<br/>\namt of exp and it is split based on the levels and members of the group.<br/>\nAnother is that it doesnt really matter how many ppl you have in the group,<br/>\nyou get a % of the exp based on the exp the monster gives irregardless of<br/>\nthe players in your group. And we&#39;ve all heard that rumor that a 6th party<br/>\nmember gives bonus exp(I think brad discussed this not too long ago as a<br/>\nmyth)<br/>\nSo, my question is.. has anyone discovered anything concrete?<br/>\n<br/>\nThoren & Co.<br/>\nThe Norrath Adventuring Co.<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeremy Cobb [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeremy@...\">jeremy@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 23, 1999 2:52 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [warriors_eq] Greetings<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Jeremy Cobb &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeremy@...\">jeremy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIm not high level but I have a pretty good story.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne Friday night at about 3am est I was out wondering around the East<br/>\nCommons looking for something to do.  There were only about 15 people in the<br/>\nzone.  I came across an orc camp and decided to kill orcs. I was in need of<br/>\nslashed belts and figured this would be cool with noone else here.  At lvl<br/>\n14 I can take just about anything in the zone and I wanted to see if I could<br/>\nclear the camp of 4 orc spawns.  3 of 4 spawns were blue to me but seeing<br/>\nthat I have close to 500 hp&#39;s I wasnt worried.  The battle was very close.<br/>\nI had forgotten how many hp&#39;s the orcs had and when theres 4 on you your<br/>\nhp&#39;s go down quick.  I killed the last one with about half a bub of health<br/>\nleft and sat down to an unexpected long  rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nA bard strolls into camp and askes if id like to join him so I could heal<br/>\nquicker.  I said hell yeah!  From that point on we would take turns killing<br/>\nthe orcs (ungrouped) and then join again when I needed healing.  I was there<br/>\nin case he got into trouble (he was lvl 11) and he was there to get rid of<br/>\nmy downtime.  We had it down to such a science that we were doing both camps<br/>\nat the same time.  When ever he pulled to many he would run them around in a<br/>\nbig circle as I took em off him 1 by 1.  Also , he didnt want the belts so<br/>\nhe gave then to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe finally called it quits at about 6am.  I had made lvl 15 plus a bub.  Had<br/>\nabout 25pp in cash, and 4 backpacks full of belts.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was one of the most enjoyable times I have had in 7 months.<br/>\n<br/>\nBruener<br/>\n16th lvl Dwarf Warrior<br/>\n&quot;Clan Stormhammer&quot;<br/>\nRodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mark Davis [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mdavis@...\">mdavis@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 23, 1999 1:26 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [warriors_eq] Greetings<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Mark Davis&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mdavis@...\">mdavis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDaks,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the reply. Im sorry to hear that the list is really slow, but Im<br/>\nnot surprised.  With so many people, like yourself, achieving the upper<br/>\nlevels information is abundant in-game.  I guess what Im most interested in<br/>\nis hearing from people like yourself who might have a story, a suggestion, a<br/>\npitfall to avoid, a strategy, a nice area to hunt, etc etc.  As a 47th<br/>\nWarrior I imagine you have seen just about all there is to see and do across<br/>\nNorrath.  Id love to share your adventures, what suggestions you might have<br/>\nfor those higher level hunts and adventures.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for the reply,<br/>\n<br/>\nThoren & Co.<br/>\nThe Norrath Adventuring Co.<br/>\nRathe<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
