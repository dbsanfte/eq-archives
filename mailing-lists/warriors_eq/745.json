We require a cleric to be<br/>\nreally usefull.  And at later levels we need a wizard to do the majority of<br/>\nthe damage.  BUT at the same time, wizards need us to keep the monsters off<br/>\nof them so they can cast their spells.  All in all I gotta give verant 2<br/>\nthumbs up on their design, the classes are pretty well balanced, no one<br/>\nclass is really any more powerfull than any other class (due to each classes<br/>\nweaknesses), every group pretty much relies upon 3 things, a tank, a cleric,<br/>\nand a wizard.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the PvP server, well, wizards defintially have some advantages<br/>\nthere....but thats another story I don&#39;t care to get into.<br/>\n<br/>\nas for us being weak offensivly....well thats debatable, at least when<br/>\ntalking about group play non pvp.  Sure we don&#39;t actually dish out the<br/>\ndamage, but we make it possible for the casters to be able to dish out the<br/>\ndamage, so looking at it that way, we have tremendous offensive powers.  As<br/>\nthey say, a good defense is the best offense, and NO BODY can match a<br/>\nwarriors defensive tanking power :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Savej@...\">Savej@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Savej@...\">Savej@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 25, 1999 6:54 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Camping, a solution<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Savej@...\">Savej@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In RPGs, my heart and soul has always fit that of a warrior.  But, having<br/>\n&gt; played a warrior to level 12 on Zek, and having suffered<br/>\n&gt; countless setbacks<br/>\n&gt; there, mostly but not exclusively involving PKs (one time 2<br/>\n&gt; yellow wizards<br/>\n&gt; wiped my level 11&#39;s full hps out in less than ten seconds after rooting),<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that warriors are, more than anyone<br/>\n&gt; else, forced<br/>\n&gt; to wear and use the juiciest items to obtain xp while at the same<br/>\n&gt; being the<br/>\n&gt; most vulnerable (after we&#39;ve used our hps to get xp, non-hiders<br/>\n&gt; are out of<br/>\n&gt; options without spell-casting bodyguards) and least<br/>\n&gt; dangerous/flexible/useful<br/>\n&gt; of the classes.  Furthermore, if/when we do get an advantage against an<br/>\n&gt; enemy, we&#39;re really bad at actually finishing them off (escaping<br/>\n&gt; from us with<br/>\n&gt; impunity is a big option).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard some very encouraging things from some of you more successful<br/>\n&gt; folks contradicting my conclusions and I&#39;d like to hear more.  I&#39;m not so<br/>\n&gt; much concerned with the PKers as I am concerned that a party of<br/>\n&gt; four wizards,<br/>\n&gt; a magician and a necro might just be slowed down by a warrior tank (best<br/>\n&gt; defense = good offense + we seem to suck at offense more than<br/>\n&gt; most casters<br/>\n&gt; w/pets suck at defense, etc.)  Many other classes could fit into<br/>\n&gt; that group<br/>\n&gt; and be less of a drag, I think...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not at all interested in theories or how things look on paper<br/>\n&gt; from people<br/>\n&gt; who&#39;ve farted around like I have to 12th or even 16th level.  I am more<br/>\n&gt; interested in hearing how things are actually working/not working<br/>\n&gt; for us in<br/>\n&gt; the grand scheme of things before I can seriously committ to<br/>\n&gt; trying to make<br/>\n&gt; my warrior work in this game and on RZ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -A disgruntled former barb<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  bringing the world together.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
