Sol-a is a difficult zone.  Folks try it one time<br/>\nand probably don&#39;t have a lot of success so they take a course of less<br/>\nresistence.  First time I went there, I fell into the lava and died - ran<br/>\noff the ramp trying to run to the zone because we were swamped by gobs.<br/>\nSpent the next hour+ doing CR.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the average level on Inny is prolly higher than 30 - so the places for<br/>\n30&#39;s are less populated than mid 40 to mid 50.<br/>\n<br/>\nOld world places for 30:<br/>\n<br/>\nHighkeep Pickclaws (although you will be among the older folks there)<br/>\nCazic Thule (with a good group - this place is great)<br/>\nUnrest (a good group in the basement torture chamber or ghost room)<br/>\nRunnyeye (not well frequented but a good group there can get exp)<br/>\n<br/>\nKunark:<br/>\nLake of Ill Omen (I think you will be among the older folks here)<br/>\nFrontier Mountains<br/>\n<br/>\nScars of Vellious:<br/>\nIceclad Ocen (Cougar camps - might be a touch low fo rhere but in a group<br/>\nshould do fine)<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n(The Pantheon)<br/>\nTroubador, somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\nP.s. oh yeah, my warrior is level 15, parked in Firona Vie, holding some<br/>\nextra stuff for me - dont think he will ever see much fighting but he was my<br/>\nfirst regular char.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Pool [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpool10550@...\">jpool10550@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 18, 2001 7:39 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@egroups.com\">warriors_eq@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [warriors_eq] Re: Where to be lvl 31<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWent back to up to SolA after patch and still same deal.
