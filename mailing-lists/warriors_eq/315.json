That may be true at first, but at later levels you get to the point where you have to have a healer of some type in your group, or you will die.  And at that point the troll regen is almost pointless.  If you want brute str Ogre is the way to go.  Their str, sta, dex, and agil are much better than Trolls, not to mention ogres have the most points to distribute.  You can easily get your dex and agil above 90 and still have your str and sta WELL above 100.  Ogres are also smarter and wiser than Trolls, so they also make better SKs and shamans....with one exception....trolls regen rate works very nicely with the canabalize spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSalr D&#39;Taynkk<br/>\nDark Warrior of The Kith<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;Zwanenburg, John&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>&gt;  5/19  9:22a &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Zwanenburg, John&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ZWANENJ@...\">ZWANENJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEyebeebad,<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing as how you are a troll (good choice) your hp are gonna go up faster<br/>\nthan all other races which is a bonus cause you want haveto wait around so<br/>\nlong, my advise to you is to kill rats, decaying skels, syoung water<br/>\nmocasins untill level 4 or so. Then if you can find one other level 4 or 5<br/>\nchar, go for normal froglocks or a weak froglock fisherman....oonce you hit<br/>\n5 you can probably solo them as well as the occasion swamp alligator, once<br/>\non level 6 head to guk but dont go in too deep, stik the the larger froglock<br/>\ntads and sentinels....good exp for you and the occasional woven/netted<br/>\narmor, (which sells great to any monks or spell casters. Oh you can get<br/>\nnetted off the small froglock tads as well.) then once you hit 10 id suggest<br/>\nmaking your way to the south desert of ro, find a group and kill dercishes<br/>\nand orcs, at around 13-15 go for the oasis and kill crocs, caimans, and the<br/>\noccasional Deepwater caiman....just watch out for the giants,<br/>\n...........after that the rest is up to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nlemme know if you need any more advise...i have a troll SK so i know the<br/>\narea very very well.<br/>\nJohn Zwanenburg<br/>\nTips Support/Support Sipt<br/>\nTel: (613) 998-2745<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tBryan Hinkel[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bjhinkel@...\">bjhinkel@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tWednesday, May 19, 1999 9:54 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Playing a Troll Warrior<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Bryan Hinkel&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bjhinkel@...\">bjhinkel@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hail Great and learned warriors.  I have decided to start playing a Troll <br/>\n&gt; Warrior and would like some advice.  All I know now is to grab the first<br/>\n&gt; two <br/>\n&gt; handed sword I can find and start killing everything in site.
