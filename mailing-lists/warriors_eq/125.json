Blackburrow and Paw are<br/>\n\ta little below our level except for the few spawns<br/>\n\tof Commanders, Captains, and the Rex brothers<br/>\n\tbut the trains associated with these dungeons <br/>\n\tand the amount of people camping in them are<br/>\n\ta huge deterrant.  We have been thinking about <br/>\n\ttackling the minotaurs in the Beholder Maze or<br/>\n\tmaybe even a trip down to Upper Guk.  Any<br/>\n\tadvice would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAngarth,  Warrior of the Wolf,  15 Tier<br/>\n\t&quot;Periissem ni Periisem&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
