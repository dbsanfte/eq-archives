At the start of this level I put 20 points each into dual wield and double attack. I am a little over a bubble away from  16 and my skills are now 65 for dual wield and 72 for double attack.  My rate of advancement has slowed considerably, I am wondering if I should expect to max these at 80 before I hit 16 or if that is uncommon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I can max them I will likely get myself killed right before i level up in order to buy some more time at 15.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way I am using a combine scimitar and tentacle whip against magical opponents and dual mino axes against non-magical opponents.  My max damage per round is 79, that is double attacks on both weapons with max damage(17) and a max damage kick (11).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in reference to others questions about faction.  It is easy enough to gain enough faction for the Commonlands vendors to deal with you, just kill orcs by the dozens.  I kill every orc I see, pawns, centurions and so on.  You can get Freeport residents to deal with you by completing the orc slashed belt quest repeatedly.  If you do that tho you faction with the Paladins in North Freeport will get worse.  It is up to you whether West and east freeport are more important to you then North Freeport<br/>\n<br/>\nBael<br/>\n15th Order<br/>\nIndigo Brotherhood</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
