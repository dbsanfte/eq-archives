But when you get into higher level mobs, you HAVE to<br/>\n&gt; have nukers of comparable levels.  Otherwise even getting healed and<br/>\n&gt; whacking away like mad on the mobs will still not bring you close enough to<br/>\n&gt; winning the battle.  Normally this is because other mobs join the fray, and<br/>\n&gt; you have to take the mob out fast, and move on to the next.  You can take it<br/>\n&gt; down semi quick with 3 tanks, but then the creature runs, and you have to<br/>\n&gt; chase it.  If you dont he grabs 3 friends and now your hosed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2 tank (warrior/hybrid - at least one warrior.)<br/>\n&gt; 2 healer (cleric/shaman/druid at least one cleric.)<br/>\n&gt; 2 nuker (any 2 nukers will do... but nice to have a necro/wiz combination.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Only way to have it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have had the opportunity to operate in this type of group.  We have been<br/>\n&gt; able to take down things that would have detroyed groups 2 levels higher<br/>\n&gt; than we were.  Why?  Because of teamwork and knowing the roles that each<br/>\n&gt; play in the group.  Never had a better feeling than taking out a zealot, 3<br/>\n&gt; fans, a couple heralds and a few defenders/warders all at once.  Then<br/>\n&gt; immediately following that up with a stone golemn.  Was a great night, we<br/>\n&gt; worked well together.

But a full party with 2 warriors and 1<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cleric plus other assorted baggage is a group that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can take much higher level mobs without losing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; members.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Right on the money; here&#39;s a very graphic example of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In Unrest, grouped (16s-19s) with three tanks, two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; clerics and a wizard, we cleaned up *anything* we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could pull from the first two floors of the house (up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to and including Carrion Ghouls and Skeleton Monks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and the occasional Barbed Bone Skeleton - all red to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all of us).  Grouped (16s-19s) with only 1 tank (me),<br/>\n&gt; &gt; two clerics, two wizards and one shaman, we could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *not* take Skeleton Monks or Barbed Bone Skeletons<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because the Wizards were dead weight then (resists),<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the Clerics didn&#39;t have enough healing to keep me up,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I didn&#39;t have the firepower alone to take them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; down before everyone was OOM and it was still at half<br/>\n&gt; &gt; life, laughing at us.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Those who think they can hunt without tanks are right,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if they&#39;re willing to *only* hunt blues and whites.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If they want to hunt &#39;up level&#39; from themselves, in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yellows and reds, they have to have tanks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My prefered party always has three tanks, period.  My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most fun ripping and shredding party would be four<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tanks and two clerics (but my friend&#39;s a wizard, and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t just throw him away like that).  But with three<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tanks and a pair of clerics, you can use the 6th slot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as a wildcard to fill with a bard or wizard or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whatever.  Enchanters go especially well, their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; debuffs make fights a lot easier.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ===<br/>\n&gt; &gt; :D<br/>\n&gt; &gt;        Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; believe it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; First Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist has over 165,000 e-mail communities from which to choose!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
