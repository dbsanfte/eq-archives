<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809897720">16th level warrior full banded and a pair of Mino axes.  Don&#39;t mind the<br/>
weight 133 str in current gear.  Wondering what weapons I should be<br/>
looking to upgrade to.  Keep hearing about combine weapons, but besides<br/>
being magical and 1 delay better than steel they don&#39;t seem that great.<br/>
What&#39;s the best 1HS weapon to get for dual for warriors?<br/>
