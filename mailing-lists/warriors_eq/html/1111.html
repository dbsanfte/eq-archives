From the small window mode, select the button on the right labeled combat (also<br/>
try abilities). It should be a button listed in that menu. Left click and hold<br/>
on it until you &#39;pick it up&#39;. Place it in one of your empty hot slots on the<br/>
left side of the screen.<br/>
<br/>
To use it, click on the person you want to use it on (or click on your name to<br/>
use it on yourself). Get close to the person. Have bandages in ANY inventory<br/>
slot. Click on bind wound key.<br/>
<br/>
The better your skill is, the more damage you can heal. However, the biggest<br/>
limitation is that you can only heal someone up to half of their hit point<br/>
level. After that, they will have to heal normally. You also will not get<br/>
success if the person already has over half of their hit points left.<br/>
<br/>
If you do not have the button listed (which I don&#39;t think is possible. Every<br/>
warrior starts with it.) then you will need to train it at least once. If it<br/>
does not go up, try putting two more trains in it until it does &#39;work&#39;.<br/>
