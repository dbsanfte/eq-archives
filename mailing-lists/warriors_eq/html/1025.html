<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118302359">I remember the bandit you refer to.  He was blue and all his lackeys were<br/>
green when we came across him accidentally one day.  Our druid decided to<br/>
pull him, he was reduced to a bar of health before he zoned (he cast<br/>
lightening consistently).<br/>
<br/>
We came back this time, myself, (warrior) a wizard and the druid.  We buffed<br/>
to max and I equip my duel trusty scimitars (always use these against spell<br/>
casters).  We decide to fight in the camp hoping the greens wont help and if<br/>
they do and the tide turns against us we can easily zone with SOW. <br/>
<br/>
The named npc managed to get one spell off at me, I interrupted the rest of<br/>
them.  We made quick work of him.  We then decided to kill the greens just<br/>
because we could.<br/>
