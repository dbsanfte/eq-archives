<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378068651">The chemistry of the game is set to balance a group out.  Warriors were ment<br/>
to take damage.  I will not argue that point.  I will not argue the point<br/>
that we should not be mammoth damage inflicters like a caster as well.  The<br/>
mages and wizards are the true damage inflicters.  But the warriors are<br/>
still caught way low on the damage stick as far as I am concerned.  As far<br/>
as what we want, lets look more towards what we need.  If we are not<br/>
demanding, but reasonable in our requests to Verant, we will get farther in<br/>
negotaitions.  Ever heard the addage you can get a horse to travel farther<br/>
with a carrot in his face than a whip at his back?  Askinf for more damage,<br/>
more attacks, critical hits, and everything else is ok.  But we we need to<br/>
compromise a little.  We can submit a list, have that list rated as to the<br/>
importance to what we as a group feel should come first, as well as the<br/>
reasons why.  This shows unity, thought and the ability to present things in<br/>
an intelligent light.<br/>
<br/>
Simply asking to do mad amounts of damage is in my mind absurd.  The big<br/>
damage is ment for the casters, not the warriors.  The warriors are there to<br/>
take the damage, and allow the casters to actually kill the creature.  Yes,<br/>
I know it is nice to kill creatures.  But face it, we all knew when we<br/>
created this character we had no way to heal, no way to do anything with<br/>
magic at all.  And in EQ magic is the name of the game.  So we need to<br/>
settle to be a group player.  And not be the almighty slayer of beasts.<br/>
That doesnt mean that our role should be unimportant in combat damage tho.<br/>
Yes, we do need to be able to influct more damage.  And that is our goal for<br/>
the most part I think.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I sound like I am rambling, things are comming out of the mind<br/>
faster than I can formulate good responses.<br/>
I will take alot of time in writing the letter to Verant tho.<br/>

  I agree and disagree.<br/>
<br/>
  There is no way a warrior is going to do as much damage per round as a<br/>
spellcaster on certains kinds of creatures.  How exactly are you going to do<br/>
the kind of damage attainable with a fireball against a creature like a hill<br/>
giant with something like a sword?  You&#39;re only chance is to achieve some<br/>
kind of critical hit to a sensitive part of the giant...maybe a sword thrust<br/>
to the gonads or something.  Regardless, I propose the critical hit skill so<br/>
that a warrior can add more to a group, and have comparable survivability<br/>
soloing.  Also, I think critical hits should be used like parry/dodge and<br/>
not like kick/bash, Simply because the assumption is you are ALWAYS trying<br/>
to do the most damage possible.  With kick/bash you are making a choice of<br/>
attack. Kick for more damage or bash to stun.  Not that I see any high level<br/>
warriors bashing...but the option is there.<br/>
<br/>
  Warriors will never be able to out damage a mage. However, the warrior<br/>
should be able to last a lot longer in physical combat.  I do see that<br/>
taking effect in the mid-teen levels, and I can only assume it gets better.<br/>
But the hybrids can take nearly as much melee punishment and deal out nearly<br/>
as much melee damage, and supplement combat with spells.  The warrior is<br/>
outclassed in every respect by a hybrid at a comparable level, in the<br/>
mid-teens.  Clerics are very powerful in every game I have played but are<br/>
always not very popular classes to play. Not sure why this is, but in EQ the<br/>
1-10 levels are tough on a cleric.  But after that I see them really<br/>
romping.  It seems to me most clerics I have seen group out of convenience<br/>
rather then necessity.<br/>

    Ok...sorry....should have added on to that. The critical hit is nice,<br/>
although I can definetly see monks getting that as well since they pretty<br/>
much are supposed to know all the nerve points and such on a body.<br/>
Also....let&#39;s try this on for size. Warriors need to get a BIG bonus on<br/>
damage, not just every other round or so. We are fighting machines. Why, if<br/>
I am level 45, should I not be able to be trained so well that I attack 6<br/>
times in one round? I know my sword, I know my enemy, and I know where to<br/>
hit and how many times. I think we should get more attacks, more damage, AND<br/>
critical hits. We should at least be on damage somewhat compareable to a<br/>
spell caster. People are going to argue....&quot;But they use magic! How can a<br/>
sword stroke compare to the Art?&quot; Well...when I take my 2-handed sword and<br/>
chop off someone&#39;s head before you even get one syllable of a spell out of<br/>
your mouth, the argument will be over. Lets face it...an object is an<br/>
object. Sure a lightning strike MIGHT hurt more than getting hit with a<br/>
double bladed axe right in your groin, but I personally have never been<br/>
struck by either so who am I to say? It just seems to me that I should be<br/>
able to hurt someone with a physical weapon actually hitting them just as<br/>
much as someone hurling balls of fire at them. Grrrr.....this point is<br/>
getting frustrating.<br/>
