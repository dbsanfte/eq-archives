&lt;&lt; My question is what skills/weapons should I actively pursue more than<br/>
 others?? I&#39;ve guessed so far just from things I&#39;ve read on the net.<br/>
 Should I ever put more than one practice in a weapon?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My advice:  <br/>
			never put more than one practice into a melee weapon <br/>
skill<br/>
              learn to use a bow and learn to fletch (both expensive and time <br/>
consuming but worth it) - archery requires investments of bunches of practice <br/>
points, fletching requires time (something to do while resting) and money <br/>
(lots of botched arrows) but the bows you&#39;ll eventually be making will rock <br/>
(much better than any store-bought).<br/>
              fairly soon it should no trouble for you to get another melee <br/>
weapon skill maxed; 2HS is probably a great bet especially until you get dual <br/>
wield; I have little experience with blunts<br/>
			tailoring is a waste of time (fun the first time you <br/>
put your outfit together, but store-bought leather/rawhide is significantly <br/>
better and you&#39;ll be wearing ring mail/chain soon enough; although people <br/>
made a profit off the skill in the past when it was a novelty, I seriously <br/>
doubt anyone will make much more from it)</div>
