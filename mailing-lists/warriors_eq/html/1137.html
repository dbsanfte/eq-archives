<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560175519">Ok...sorry...should have added on to that. The critical hit is nice, although I can definetly see monks getting that as well since they pretty much are supposed to know all the nerve points and such on a body. Also....let&#39;s try this on for size. Warriors need to get a BIG bonus on damage, not just every other round or so. We are fighting machines. Why, if I am level 45, should I not be able to be trained so well that I attack 6 times in one round? I know my sword, I know my enemy, and I know where to hit and how many times. I think we should get more attacks, more damage, AND critical hits. We should at least be on damage somewhat compareable to a spell caster. People are going to argue....&quot;But they use magic! How can a sword stroke compare to the Art?&quot; Well...when I take my 2-handed sword and chop off someone&#39;s head before you even get one syllable of a spell out of your mouth, the argument will be over. Lets face it...an object is an object. Sure a lightning strike MIGHT hurt more than getting hit with a double bladed axe right in your groin, but I personally have never been struck by either so who am I to say? It just seems to me that I should be able to hurt someone with a physical weapon actually hitting them just as much as someone hurling balls of fire at them. Grrrr.....this point is getting frustrating.<br/>
