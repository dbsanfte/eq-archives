Actually Dvinn isn&#39;t that powerful (unless something has changed in the last patch with his new dagger) and people in the 18-20 lvl range have a field day with him (my estimate is he is 20 or 21 based on cons I&#39;ve heard).  I play CB an awful lot so I relate this from my own exp.<br/>
<br/>
The fact is that a mage will outdamage a warrior every day of the week on a creature he is equipped/able to hit (is it within 4 levels for non-fizzles for wizs?), is standing still & has a tank on them.  The difference in levels doesn&#39;t matter as long as the wiz can hit it.  Whether this right or wrong this is how the game is set up (i&#39;d be inclined to say its still wrong too). You would think that higher level chars would be able to inflict greater damage on dark green cons than someone attacking a yellow or red... <br/>
<br/>
However, if you took the same wiz (Mr 18), pitted him against a mid-twenties critter (ala a skeletal monk or something), guess who wins?  The warrior (lvl 36?) because all his (the wizs) spells fizzle while the warrior still hits. So the warrior has a relative advantage over a wizard in &quot;the blind spot&quot; between where the wizards ability ends (i.e. things he can&#39;t hit) & your own capacity to kill (in this case probably creatures of level 22-34).  This of course means you can only outgun people at least 5 or so levels below you as a warrior.<br/>
<br/>
But when I&#39;m camping the CB castle I just let Dvinn & Crush kill solo wizards (oh this is fun to watch).  If there is a team of wizards I just leave.  I absolutely hate the KSing &*(&##&#39;s!!!<br/>

&gt; I play a 38th halfling warrior on Povar... I have some dam good equipment <br/>
&gt; and am one of the higher warriors on the server... But something happened to <br/>
&gt; me yesterday that I think highlights the warrior classes weakness... I <br/>
&gt; decided I wanted to get that new dragoon&#39;s dirk from Dvinn in Crushbone... <br/>
&gt; So I went there, camped in his room, for those of you that dont know, Dvinn <br/>
&gt; is about a 25th level DE that is very tough.... He spawned and I attacked <br/>
&gt; him... low and behold a wizzie... AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE.... ran into the <br/>
&gt; room, and started blasting him!  Guess what? AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE STOLE <br/>
&gt; DVINN FROM A 38TH LEVEL WARRIOR!!!!!  Do I need to say ANYTHING else? btw I <br/>
&gt; was using a zweildahander.... This was the most embarassing thing that has <br/>
&gt; ever happened to me... I&#39;m sitting there in almost full rubicite, all these <br/>
&gt; cool items, everyone is looking at me... and then i have the thing stolen <br/>
&gt; from me by ONE, not a group, but ONE 18th level wizzie......grumbles <br/>
&gt; something about warriors suck and I am ready to cancel my account...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
