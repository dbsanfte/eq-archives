<div id="ygrps-yiv-611711360">Hmm try this time 3 to 4am.  I live in Japan and when I get home from work<br/>
Monday night and I login to EQ its aprox 4am or 4:30am Monday morning in the<br/>
USA (PST).  Number of people on my server is aprox 250 to 350.  The whole<br/>
place is dead.  I went to najena to kill some TT and me and my partner (who<br/>
lives in Denmark) were the only ones in there.  Two people! unbelievable.<br/>
About an hour later one other lower level person showed up.<br/>
<br/>
I bet that the Tomahawk will be camped very lightly (I wont go so far to say<br/>
it WONT be camped at all).  The only people who may be camping it will most<br/>
likely be Japanese or MAYBE some Europeans (thou in Europe it will be aprox.<br/>
early afternoon, like 1pm or so).  <br/>
<br/>
If there Japanese you wont have any sharing problems, but please EXPLAIN to<br/>
them you want to share the spawn.  For some reason (until you explain the<br/>
idea to them, and it helps if you speak Japanese) the concept of kill<br/>
stealing and alternating kills doesn&#39;t occur to them.  No idea why.  <br/>
<br/>
In my experience when its explained to them they never do it again.<br/>
<br/>
Well hope that helps, maybe.  Good luck getting the Tomi.<br/>

&gt; This seems to be the most camped weapon that i&#39;ve ever seen.  No matter<br/>
&gt; what time i goto Highpass, there&#39;s always at least one group just sitting<br/>
&gt; there waiting for endless hours for the gnoll to spawn. <br/>
