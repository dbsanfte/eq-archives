end up dying and losing it all. I&#39;m just under a bubb with him now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that sounds like a great plan. Too bad you get on *so* late at night<br/>
though! If you wouldn&#39;t mind, I&#39;ll bring an enchantress friend along.<br/>
She&#39;s going to be Frizzan&#39;s wife eventually. Hehe ;) She was level 21<br/>
yesterday, but with the exp formula, a few levels is just a percentage or<br/>
two differnce with split. <br/>
<br/>
We were talking about going to lake rathe to get another friend some small<br/>
bronze, but we must outfit the tank first and formost :)<br/>

Nooooo problem about the armor. Good friends always come before the just<br/>
met friends. I&#39;d do the same thing :)<br/>
