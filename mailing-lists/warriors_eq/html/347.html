Know of one such a person and it&#39;s nothing weird. It just seems that if a woman is afraid or scared to go to a certain place or whatever it seems more acceptable than if a man said he&#39;s afraid. So I think it is to allow more acceptance of one&#39;s fears in the game. *chuckles* Me, I don&#39;t like going to new places (once I know the area .. watch out) and the guys I hunt with know that and are patient with me. After they see that I&#39;m comfortable then they keep sending me out to fetch since I have<br/>
the most HP out of them all. Go figya.<br/>

&gt; Speaking of women.....There is one big question I have.....why do guys play girl characters....some say they are role playing.....do they also dress up in womens close and role play women in real life?  or is &quot;role playing&quot; a female the first step towards role playing a real life female? I know there are a lot of legitimate female players, but I&#39;d bet a large sum of money that most of the female characters are being driven by guys.....call me homophobic if you will, but I think its weird.<br/>
