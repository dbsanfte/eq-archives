 </span></blockquote>yep yep...need better bow!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; +1 str earrings =&gt; Gold-Amber (+3 STR)  - these would be cool )<br/>
&gt; &gt; collar of undead prot =&gt; Spiked Collar (+3 STR)  - ive got a spiked<br/>
&gt; collar but went in favour of the undead one...with better AC<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; blackened helm =&gt; Bronze Helm or B.Iron Crown  --- sorry i menat B iron<br/>
&gt; crown, not blackened helm<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; grotesque mask<br/>
&gt; &gt; BS mantle<br/>
&gt; &gt; bronze tunic<br/>
&gt; &gt; barbed arms =&gt; Bronze Arms   --- my barbed arms are only 1 ac less than<br/>
&gt; bronze, but give +2 dex<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; bronze bracers =&gt; Bracers of Battle  --- yeah ill have to look for<br/>
&gt; these...was also thinking of erollisi bracer<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; lizardscale cloak =&gt; Bronze Cloak --- lizard is same Ac as bronze but<br/>
&gt; lighter and plus 5 dex<br/>
&gt; &gt; bronze pants<br/>
&gt; &gt; blackened boots =&gt; Bronze or Dwarven Work Boots  --- dwarven boots would<br/>
&gt; be real cool...but they are so sought after and rare...i prefer the black<br/>
&gt; ones over bronze as i can kick magic with them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; +5 agi rings<br/>
&gt; &gt; jboots =&gt; Or just wear these all the time.  - -- i just leave these in<br/>
&gt; an inventory slot as i dont need to wear them for the sow effect..only ac<br/>
&gt; 1<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Question about the Journeyman&#39;s Boots.  Do they<br/>
&gt; enhance your speed just by wearing them, or do you<br/>
&gt; have to burn a SOW charge out of them to get a speed<br/>
&gt; increase?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>they just need to be in a main inventory slot, then you right click on them<br/>
to get the sow...and they have unlimited charges...sow can only be cast<br/>
outdoors and lasts 20 mins...but you can cast on the move as well...<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Go all bronze on your character and start working on<br/>
&gt; Rubicite or Mithril/Silvered Plate.  Any items you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; wearing that are chain equalivalent are holding you<br/>
&gt; back; plate is a requirement to do really, really well<br/>
&gt; at higher levels in melee.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yeah would love to go for rubi...mithril or silvered...just they are all so<br/>
camped...<br/>
<br/>
i also only have about 300pp in the bank...i think this is way below what<br/>
most seem to have at level 30!! so im also trying to find a good place to<br/>
sit for hours and just gather plat and not worry about exp.<br/>
<br/>
thanks again<br/>
