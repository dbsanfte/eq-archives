<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-276246604">There is supposed to be a new patch today, which I haven&#39;t played.  In the<br/>
list of things included on EQVault.  It says nothing about warrior upgrade,<br/>
though Rogues finally get make and apply poison.<br/>
<br/>
I did read of a quest that will be implemented that will allow characters to<br/>
change servers.  Not in the new patch that I know of.<br/>
