<div id="ygrps-yiv-275003332">Mistmoore is a lvl 20-50 zone, it has dark elf rogues, casters, gargolyes and<br/>
vampires. Mistmoore is some of the best exp i&#39;ve gotten plus ok loot.however, on<br/>
a certain mob there is a shield called the crested mistmoore shield(rare spawn)<br/>
i dont know the stats off hand but its worth around 400p. other then that, the<br/>
rogues drop raw-hide, bronze and FS weapons, and gargoyles have eyes that sell<br/>
for 6p to vendors. fyi if your 20 a caster can drop u in 2 spells :) force shock<br/>
is nothing to mess with<br/>

&gt; Hey all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was just wondering if any of you had any cool info on Mistmoore. Ive never<br/>
&gt; been there and was thinking about venturing over there. i hear there are a<br/>
&gt; lot of good mid to high range MOBS there. Is this place usualy packed? Any<br/>
&gt; good magical items to be found in here? Any info would be much appreciated<br/>
&gt; before i make the long walk over there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
