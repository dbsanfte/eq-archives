But the act of killing the orcs of get the belts ups your faction with the<br/>
Paladins, so it matches or goes up faster than it drops doing the belt<br/>
quest.<br/>

Subject: [warriors_eq] Question about skill advancement.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am Bael, a warrior of the 15th Order and a dark elf. At the start of this<br/>
level I put 20 points each into dual wield and double attack. I am a little<br/>
over a bubble away from 16 and my skills are now 65 for dual wield and 72<br/>
for double attack. My rate of advancement has slowed considerably, I am<br/>
wondering if I should expect to max these at 80 before I hit 16 or if that<br/>
is uncommon.<br/>
<br/>
If I can max them I will likely get myself killed right before i level up in<br/>
order to buy some more time at 15.<br/>
<br/>
By the way I am using a combine scimitar and tentacle whip against magical<br/>
opponents and dual mino axes against non-magical opponents. My max damage<br/>
per round is 79, that is double attacks on both weapons with max damage(17)<br/>
and a max damage kick (11).<br/>
<br/>
And in reference to others questions about faction. It is easy enough to<br/>
gain enough faction for the Commonlands vendors to deal with you, just kill<br/>
orcs by the dozens. I kill every orc I see, pawns, centurions and so on.<br/>
You can get Freeport residents to deal with you by completing the orc<br/>
slashed belt quest repeatedly. If you do that tho you faction with the<br/>
Paladins in North Freeport will get worse. It is up to you whether West and<br/>
east freeport are more important to you then North Freeport<br/>
