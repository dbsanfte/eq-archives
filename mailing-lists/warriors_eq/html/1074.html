<br/>
The fastest way to level is to group - however, I keep having to make <br/>
friends over and over.  I only play one or two hours a night five nights a <br/>
week.  I appears everyone around my rank (16th, almost 17 I hope) must play <br/>
24/7!  One day they are 16, the next time I log on they are 22!  Oh well, <br/>
such is life.<br/>
<br/>
Guess I will have to start over on the new server as a puny Gnome Wizard or <br/>
a Tree Hugging Wood Elf Druid.  Just kidding, there is still no better life <br/>
that being a barbarian warrior.  Just venting.<br/>
<br/>
For the Honor and Glory of Rallos Zek;<br/>
