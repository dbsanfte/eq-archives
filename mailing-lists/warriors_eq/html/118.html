<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036359580">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I am a level 13 warrior (Flair) that hangs in Crush Bone alot and this happens all the time.  After awhile you learn to just start ignoring people after politely telling your side of the story.  The thing is if you aren&#39;t trying to actively kill steal & you occasionally do it by accident I think you are ok.<br/>
<br/>
For example, last night when I piled onto a slaver no one was tackling...the thing I didn&#39;t know was that a mage had already rooted it and was waiting for his tank to back him up.  Did I kill steal?  Yes.  Did I mean to? No.  After a lengthy discuission between me & the mage (windu) we worked it out.  The thing is we both work the same area regularly & we loosely know of each other and have been through this drill a zillion times so we had the patience to talk it out.<br/>
<br/>
In short as Jimmney Cricket would say &quot;Let your conscience be your guide&quot;.  If you do not actively seek to kill steal then I wouldn&#39;t sweat it.  I&#39;d apologize when when you screw up but if they refuse to listen & throw a tantrum, walk away and add a new candidate to your ignore list. If you work the same area for a period of time people will learn boundries anyway (and with it respect)<br/>

Good Hunting!!! <br/>

&gt; &gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve been a roleplayer and a mudder for years now. I&#39;ve come to EQ like<br/>
&gt; &gt;most of us, with a lot of experience in multiplayer gaming. Now, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;fairly new to EQ (level 8) but I thought I had a good understanding of<br/>
&gt; &gt;it, and it&#39;s unwritten rules, until now.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The other night I was in BlackBurrow in a small group of 3. Two of us<br/>
&gt; &gt;were at the bottom level, and I was up top, returning from a town run. I<br/>
&gt; &gt;saw a gnoll guardsman kill someone, so I ran up to take charge of it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;There was nobody else around it. After a few hits it fled to the lower<br/>
&gt; &gt;level with me chasing it every step, hacking and kicking. Upon reaching<br/>
&gt; &gt;the lower level, there was a mini train already down there, but both me,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and the members of my group, were working on the gnoll guardsman I had<br/>
&gt; &gt;chased down. Towards the end of the fight, a fighter type of some sort<br/>
&gt; &gt;walked up and took the final swing on the guardsman. Thinking I had done<br/>
&gt; &gt;it ( I had to scroll back to look afterward) I bent over and looted the<br/>
&gt; &gt;corpse.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The fighter started complaining at once that I was a kill stealer and I<br/>
&gt; &gt;took his loot. I explained to him that I had chased the monster down,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and had done the most damage, and therefore the computer LET me take my<br/>
&gt; &gt;kill. He respnded that HE had chased the monster down from the top (I<br/>
&gt; &gt;never even saw anyone up top but myself) and had made the kill therefore<br/>
&gt; &gt;it wasn&#39;t mine to take. I didn&#39;t feel like the argument was worth it so<br/>
&gt; &gt;I gave up and tried to trade him the loot. He would not accept, but<br/>
&gt; &gt;instead complained to me via tells that he couldn&#39;t believe I did that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My questions are:<br/>
&gt; &gt;1.) Was I ethically wrong to take the loot?<br/>
&gt; &gt;2.) Does the game only allow the majority damage dealer to take the<br/>
&gt; &gt;loot, or the final swinger?<br/>
&gt; &gt;3.) How would you guys deal with this situation?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks for any advice ....<br/>
