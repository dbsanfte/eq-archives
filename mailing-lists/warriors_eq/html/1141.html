I agree with what you are saying but i seriously doubt that verant would add<br/>
anythig like 6 attacks per round. IF they DID do that it wouldnt be with a<br/>
warrior and that makes sense to me, it would most probably be a monk thing<br/>
seeing as how they are much faster and agile. But what verant should do as<br/>
you said is increase the damage that we go, and consistency that we hit at.<br/>
I mean cmon, a level 37 warrior should not miss more that once per round<br/>
dont you think? like you said we are trained in combat therefore we shouldnt<br/>
miss, and should do more damage. But i think the more multiple attacks is<br/>
asking a bit much. The least Verant could do is increase tha damage we do on<br/>
a higher basis per level with some kind of weapon mastery skill. <br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
<br/>
Verant creates a type of specializatsion thing like casters get except<br/>
warriors get to pick from 1h , 2h shlashing, blunt and peircinfg. Say we get<br/>
it at level 20, sounds fair, at that level we are becoming mighty warriors. <br/>
<br/>
So we go to our trainer and pracitse that specialization. THe more it goes<br/>
up the better bonus we get while using that weapon class. (Like the bonus a<br/>
rogue gets for using a peircing weapon but better.) Then as well after level<br/>
20 we could get our damage up like 5 pts a level or something....<br/>
<br/>
well something like that anyway.<br/>

&gt; size=2&gt;Ok...sorry...should have added on to that. The critical hit is<br/>
&gt; nice, although I can definetly see monks getting that as well since they<br/>
&gt; pretty much are supposed to know all the nerve points and such on a body.<br/>
&gt; Also....let&#39;s try this on for size. Warriors need to get a BIG bonus on<br/>
&gt; damage, not just every other round or so. We are fighting machines. Why,<br/>
&gt; if I am level 45, should I not be able to be trained so well that I attack<br/>
&gt; 6 times in one round? I know my sword, I know my enemy, and I know where<br/>
&gt; to hit and how many times. I think we should get more attacks, more<br/>
&gt; damage, AND critical hits. We should at least be on damage somewhat<br/>
&gt; compareable to a spell caster. People are going to argue....&quot;But they use<br/>
&gt; magic! How can a sword stroke compare to the Art?&quot; Well...when I take my<br/>
&gt; 2-handed sword and chop off someone&#39;s head before you even get one<br/>
&gt; syllable of a spell out of your mouth, the argument will be over. Lets<br/>
&gt; face it...an object is an object. Sure a lightning strike MIGHT hurt more<br/>
&gt; than getting hit with a double bladed axe right in your groin, but I<br/>
&gt; personally have never been struck by either so who am I to say? It just<br/>
&gt; seems to me that I should be able to hurt someone with a physical weapon<br/>
&gt; actually hitting them just as much as someone hurling balls of fire at<br/>
&gt; them. Grrrr.....this point is getting frustrating.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>
