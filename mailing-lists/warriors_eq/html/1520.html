<b>Subject:</b> Crafted Armor Question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244750810">Many of the rare items required for the pieces of crafted armor are no-drop no-trade.  I know the armor itself is lore.  Is the armor also no-trade no-drop?  Does anybody actually have some they can examine to answer this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>
