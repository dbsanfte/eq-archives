<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291720853">I dont know the exact timing/anti spawn info for the tomahawk, I do know<br/>
that its only once every 4 to 6  hours that the mucktail spawns with it.<br/>
<br/>
I went to that site once and once only, the line was unbelievable.  Players<br/>
also become REALLY bitchy about high return sites like this one.  Whining<br/>
about loot and to many people, well maybe if you didn&#39;t camp it 24/7 it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be so bad.  sigh.<br/>
<br/>
HH and unrest are the worst places to get anything, there filled with greedy<br/>
players.<br/>
<br/>
I got a lucky loot in unrest, we killed a skeleton knight and I got the<br/>
blood stained tunic, I thought GREAT I can sell this for about 40pp.<br/>
Another player in the party said its worth 250pp, and he wanted to buy it -<br/>
250pp!!!  I was then told that I was not allowed to loot anything anymore -<br/>
What the hell?  I can understand not looting anymore skeletons knights, but<br/>
not looting anymore fullstop?  This from someone decked out in all magic<br/>
armour which he had bought.  Needless to say I disbanded and went home to<br/>
Neriak.  Atleast DE dont screw DE.<br/>
<br/>
ANYWAY we appreciate the info you shared here.  Would you mind sharing the<br/>
BBC/gos robe info?  Friends of mine camped the Gos robe for 3 days and got<br/>
nothing, id like to help them out.<br/>

&gt; This seems to be the most camped weapon that i&#39;ve ever seen.  No matter<br/>
&gt; what time i goto Highpass, there&#39;s always at least one group just sitting<br/>
&gt; there waiting for endless hours for the gnoll to spawn. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My question is this:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone know the anticamp and timing of the gnoll that carries the<br/>
&gt; weapon?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some people don&#39;t believe that there is an anticamp for weapons, and those<br/>
&gt; who don&#39;t, let me give you an example to prove that there is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; CHITIN SHIELD<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some talk was going on about getting the chitin shield and that you had to<br/>
&gt; kill a giant heart spider to get it, which is located in Guk.  I went to<br/>
&gt; Guk over four separate occasions for many many hours, each and every time<br/>
&gt; being unsuccessful.  One kind person posted a respawn list of what would<br/>
&gt; come next, but even that proved to be wrong.  A guildmate of mine and I<br/>
&gt; had an idea though.  He had recently figured out the anticamp spot and<br/>
&gt; timer for getting the BBC and Gossimer robe, so we decided to experiment.<br/>
&gt; We did figure it out, and this is how it goes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kill everything inside the room where the giant heart spider is supposed<br/>
&gt; to spawn. DO NOT LOOT ANYTHING UNTIL EVERYTHING IS DEAD.  When everything<br/>
&gt; is dead, loot quick, and run out of the room and go behind the corridor.<br/>
&gt; The little hall outside of the room has a darker floor, then there is a<br/>
&gt; lower lighter floor, and another darker one nearer the water. Have your<br/>
&gt; party all stand on the darker floor there and wait for 16 minutes after<br/>
&gt; the person who looted the giant heart or the large or whatever was<br/>
&gt; spawned. If you want to give it an extra minute, you can do so.  If<br/>
&gt; everyone followed the rules, when you all run in, there should be another<br/>
&gt; giant heart spider with the chitin shield again for you. I have tested<br/>
&gt; this and successfully done it on three occasions, so it DOES work.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Back to the tomahawk discussion and one more thing.. I don&#39;t know how it<br/>
&gt; is on all of your servers, but I play on Solusek Ro, and I&#39;m disgusted<br/>
&gt; with the players and people on the server.  People charging 100 to over<br/>
&gt; 200 plat for a rare item.  In beta, an item rarely went over 20 plat, and<br/>
&gt; if it did, by that time, you were in your mid twenties in level and could<br/>
&gt; get it without a problem or could afford to pay for it. I am a level 19<br/>
&gt; warrior and also have a level 19 druid, and i do NOT have 100 to 200 plat<br/>
&gt; to spend on anything but the things to keep my character advancing.<br/>
&gt; Spells for my druid and armor for my warrior.  Those people who do have<br/>
&gt; that cash at early levels must have a LOT of time on their hands.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I got my char to almost level 20 in 6 days and 20 some hours.  This isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; that spectaular, but i fight to get experience and i fight well. I work<br/>
&gt; full time and am also a full time student at a university. I do not have<br/>
&gt; the time to run around and kill wisps or whatever people with big bank<br/>
&gt; accounts do. The reason why i want to share the spawn information with you<br/>
&gt; guys is because I hope you will help me in lowering the disgusting<br/>
&gt; inflated prices of the game. Give items to players or sell them for cheap.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s what I and some good members of my guild do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for reading and hopefully someone knows the info for the tomahawk.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d really love to get one or two for my dual wield.<br/>
