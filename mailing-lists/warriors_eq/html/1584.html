<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064888111">Okay,<br/>
<br/>
If I would have my dream site for equiptment and such<br/>
<br/>
Level based - what equiptment armor/weapons =&gt; someone who is wondering<br/>
what to get at each level(s) could go there and see.<br/>
Stat impoving - say I want to know how to up my stats for str, agi, dex,<br/>
sta what weapons/armor/jewelry/misc - where/who/how to get plus some<br/>
explinations about how each stat improvement can improve warrior&#39;s<br/>
performance.<br/>
Quest based - items that can only be gotten through quests<br/>
Purchasable items - average pricing<br/>
Player Trade/purchased - price should pay for these<br/>
<br/>
That site I like for the message board. Get good tips and such from<br/>
there.<br/>

&gt;      So does the site have everything you need?  Are the items<br/>
&gt;      arranged in a good order?  As far as items goes could it be<br/>
&gt;      better?<br/>
