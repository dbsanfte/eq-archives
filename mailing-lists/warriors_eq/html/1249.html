<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542023759">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I wrote an e-mail to one of those guys from PPI - the ones who do the great<br/>
analysis works of classs (see eq-stratis cleric for a sampling of their work). I<br/>
told him of the things I have been reading here such as a critical strike (which<br/>
he didn&#39;t think would be accepted), increase what bind wound could do ( he<br/>
agreed that it should go up to 70-80%), increased skill cap (no comment from<br/>
him) and unique warrior skill (again  no comment from him). His idea was to have<br/>
the warrior&#39;s  defensives skill be increased some how. That would make the<br/>
warrior harder to hit and therefore less damage and less down time.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to try to get him to join this mailing list since I feel he could<br/>
give great insight. He did say that they were not going to be writing anything<br/>
soon but said something about how a warrior could be tweeked to make a warrior<br/>
awsome.<br/>
