<b>Subject:</b> warrior upgrade in new patch <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-371234383">The warrior upgrade is in the new patch.<br/>
<br/>
1) Critical Strike happens about one in 60 hits for around double damage<br/>
2) More HP.  talked to a level 24 Troll warrior he got 34 more HP overnight.<br/>
My level 14 Dark Elf Warrior went from 401 to 399 (yes I lost two hp)<br/>
3) Magic resistance.  I think you gain one magic resistance for every two<br/>
levels.</div>
