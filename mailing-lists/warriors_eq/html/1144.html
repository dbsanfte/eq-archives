<div id="ygrps-yiv-459182187">I really dont agree with this at all.. Why should we be able to gate when<br/>
rangers, bards, rouges (cant remember what others) cant? Those are not<br/>
viable solutions. This isnt a flame im just simply stating that those<br/>
cannot fit this game.. What they really need is a weapon specialization<br/>
like how mages can specialize in magic we can specialize in 1h slash or 2h<br/>
slash. What that could do is improve the delay time of the swing. Cause<br/>
more damage by a bit. I think that would improve warrios a LOT more then<br/>
spells and im sure everyone in the game of any class would not mind it at<br/>
all.<br/>

&gt; James....I also am getting a little bored with my level 19 Barbarian Warrior.  One of the reasons, I guess, that I started the Bard.  I do think that Verant has overlooked us slightly.  When I played Realm, the warrior on there could buy mana and cast spells.  Agreed, they didn&#39;t work as well as the mages did, but we still could have the basics.  I would like to see Verant come up with another plan.  Perhaps some sort of magic skill, so at the very least, we could gate and cast healing on ourselves.  <br/>
