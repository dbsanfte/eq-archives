<div id="ygrps-yiv-738035597">Hi I am new to this list. My char name is Sanerien on the Innoruuk servrer.<br/>
Just wanted you to know I am out here.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. does any one know any stats on blood stone rings? Do they work or do<br/>
they need to be enchanted to work? Also I am looking for a good quality 2<br/>
hand slashing weapon for a level 8 char. Where can I get one for a good<br/>
price? and what sugestion do you give that I should get, but so you know I<br/>
have my heart set on a 2 hand slashing so pleas dont try to convince me<br/>
other wise. :P~~~</div>
