<div id="ygrps-yiv-819246037">You&#39;d be surprised how quickly you get your health back if you party with a<br/>
cleric.  They can heal you up in no time.  Bards work well too.<br/>
<br/>
You say no one will group with you?  Well, try asking.  I was on with my<br/>
cleric (level 12) tonight for several hours and could not find a tank to<br/>
group with me.  I saw one warrior that was my level that was soloing.  I old<br/>
him we should group up, but he said he preferred to solo so he wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
to share the loot.<br/>
<br/>
There was also a higher-up group that was asking for a tank for over an<br/>
hour.<br/>
<br/>
Why does no one want to group?  Instead of grouping, you want faster hp<br/>
regen.  This will make it easier to solo and reduce the need for a healer in<br/>
the group.<br/>
<br/>
Verdant wanted a game where complementary classes could work together to<br/>
perform better.  I don&#39;t think Verdant will ever make it easier for a class<br/>
to solo.  If anything, other classes might be altered to reduce their solo<br/>
capability.<br/>

&gt; Personally, i feel that warriors should have a sleeping ability, but not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to the extent that all goes black.  It should be just like medditate,  exit<br/>
when you want, and you can still type, just you can&#39;t see what is going on.<br/>
So, a mediate for warriors is the one thing that will help a lot, well thats<br/>
what i think.  It just takes me too long to get back all that health...<br/>
