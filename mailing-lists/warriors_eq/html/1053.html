<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712612078">Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
	I know that ive asked this once before but i am gonna ask again, (<br/>
ive got a bad memory) I was wondering if any of you knew about the quest<br/>
involving the hammer peices found in Befallen (2 are found on the elf<br/>
skeleton and the other is fond on Gynok) What i need to know is whom to give<br/>
these peices to in the clerics guild. Anyone have an idea? Oh im talking<br/>
about the Dark Elf clerics guild by the way.<br/>
<br/>
	Thanks</div>
