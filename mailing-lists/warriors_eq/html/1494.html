<b>Subject:</b> Dual Wield curiosity question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-825785934">I&#39;ll start off with the coment that *should* my character do this .. it<br/>
would be for RP reasons ;)  So skip any damage and delay analysis ...<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone tried dual-wield with two 1-H Blunts?  Does it work?<br/>
<br/>
(i.e. Can it be done .. not is it the best set up).<br/>

(who thinks she would be Swishswish if she dual wields slashing)<br/>

- current quest - find a spit, cut down on that kill to eat time ratio<br/>
thing, its really annoying her.</div>
