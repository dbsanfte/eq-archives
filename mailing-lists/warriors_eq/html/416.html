&gt; I am about to hit lvl 13 and was thinkin about trying for the chitin shield.<br/>
&gt; I I get together a strong group do we have a shot?<br/>
&gt; To get to the Spider(s) do you go into the water from the room with the two<br/>
&gt; frogs that spawn that is close to the entrance?  The one where the big croc<br/>
&gt; hangs out?  I&#39;ve seen some spiders over that way, but I was only level 8 and<br/>
&gt; it looked KINDA dangerous!  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sean, I was there yesterday or the day beofre with my level 17 warrior, a<br/>
level 19 cleric, and 20 druid, and we were able to do it.  The giant heart<br/>
spider, which dropped the shield, wasn&#39;t that bad, but was a very rare<br/>
spawn.  The majority of the time a large heart spider spawns, and is much<br/>
tougher than the giant which has the shield.  We had a couple really close<br/>
calls with it.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend trying it unles you have a party that<br/>
can heal and you&#39;re pretty high up there in levels because of the mobs of<br/>
spiders and the intensity of the poison.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to ya<br/>
