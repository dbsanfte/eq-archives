 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve actually been waiting on getting the armor from you before i fought<br/>
anymore hehe. I&#39;m camped outside of Neriak with Frizzan, and started<br/>
character number 3. A dark elf wizzie named Veldrin. I gave him my old old<br/>
runed totem staff which i used with my druid before killing LJ to get the<br/>
Crooked Staff. That in combinaion with the Theourmatgist&#39;s Robe (dunno how<br/>
it&#39;s spelled) and i&#39;m going pretty good. Those of you who have tried<br/>
wizards know how much you die :)  I&#39;m level 6, almost 7, in 16 hours.<br/>
Going good. <br/>
<br/>
About IRC, nope.. There&#39;s too much to do in the office today for me to<br/>
