<b>Subject:</b> AC is all that matters. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561916808"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; *grin* You can disagree all you like, but that&#39;s not going to change<br/>
&gt;&gt; the game.<br/>
&gt; Fair enough; I firmly believe you&#39;re incorrect.  See below. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*laugh*  Firmly believe away, but please only do so after reading the rest<br/>
of this article.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ok, if AC is all that matters, why do a pair of characters at equal<br/>
&gt; level and Defensive skills have such vast differences?  One a Ranger in<br/>
&gt; full banded, the other a Warrior/Paladin/ShadowKnight in full plate; the<br/>
&gt; Rangers consistently take more damage from fights than their heavily<br/>
&gt; armored fellow tanks. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok... have you actually looked at the AC advantage that Plate provides<br/>
over Banded?  Have you actually _asked_ a Ranger in full Banded his AC and<br/>
then compared it to yours (assuming in full Plate)? <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the numbers.  Armor sets add the following amount to your &#39;base&#39; AC<br/>
from level/agility/defense skill.  (Note that there are some modifying<br/>
effects. e.g., Armor provides more AC for characters with high (90+) <br/>
Agility.) <br/>
<br/>
Full Plate: 110 AC<br/>
Full Banded: 77 AC<br/>
<br/>
AC differential: 33 AC (not including modifying effects)<br/>
<br/>
That is where the difference in damage arises, not from the type of armor. <br/>
<br/>
If you were to replace all of these Plate pieces with Magical Leather<br/>
Armor that totalled up to 110AC you would receive the _exact_ same<br/>
protection as if you had Plate on (level and skill being equal).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Still don&#39;t like that test?  Try this one: take *your* WAR/PAL/SDK and<br/>
&gt; get a full suit of plate to match the full suit of banded you&#39;re so<br/>
&gt; proud of.  Go fight a few blue mobs in your banded armor and note the<br/>
&gt; strength of the blows that connect against you; how much single shots<br/>
&gt; tend to do, how many low damage shots you receive, and how much total<br/>
&gt; damage you take over the fight. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As noted above, your test is flawed because there is a serious AC<br/>
difference between the Banded and Plate.  And I have tested both Plate and<br/>
Plate equivalents looking for differences.  My Paladin, Warrior, and SK<br/>
all maximize AC per slot resulting in the greatest protection.<br/>
<br/>
Admittedly, I do prefer the look of Steel Plate, but I will sacrifice it<br/>
in favor of better equipment (higher AC/stat enhancers) if the advantage<br/>
is significant enough.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from AC differences, appearance of armor matters only for personal<br/>
aethestics.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now put on the plate and try another few fights against similar mobs<br/>
&gt; (level and race).  You should notice fewer shots dealing maximum damage<br/>
&gt; against you, more shots doing low damage (2-10 where before it would<br/>
&gt; have been 40-60 on each connect), and less total damage at the end of<br/>
&gt; the fight. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As is _very_ correct, given that you&#39;re wearing 33 AC more.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You think you&#39;ve found some secret uber-combo (ala Tekken or something,<br/>
&gt; up-up-down-left-right left and right punch together to produce the<br/>
&gt; MegaFireball) or something; this game has shown no instances of such<br/>
&gt; imbalances.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whoa... whoa... whoa... nice shooting Tex... <br/>
<br/>
What ultra-secret combo am I trying to reveal?  I&#39;m just saying that<br/>
AC is the deciding factor in determining protection during melee combat.  <br/>
<br/>
When did knowledge of the game you&#39;re playing become some cheat code?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you truly think they managed to get all the way through four phases<br/>
&gt; of beta and the past 4-6 months of final and never notice that plate, as<br/>
&gt; you are alledging, is useless? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Plate is _not_ useless.  It provides the most AC per piece available of<br/>
any armor that can be bought from standard NPC merchants.  Therefore it is<br/>
the best protection you can get without adventuring.  But that is _not_<br/>
because it is (insert angel choir here) Plate. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Thinking you&#39;ve found some hidden truth; that banded is marginally (5%<br/>
&gt; or less) effective than Plate but has a fraction of the weight ...<br/>
&gt; folly.  Sheer folly. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*vast confusion*  Where, in any of my mail, have I stated that Banded is<br/>
equivalent to Plate?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Plate matters in a fight.  I&#39;ll take plate armored tanks over those in<br/>
&gt; banded seven days a week and the rest of the month too.  I have watched<br/>
&gt; the performance of Rangers (since they *can&#39;t* have better than banded)<br/>
&gt; higher than my level for months now; they&#39;re stuck in banded while I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; in plate, and I take less damage when tanking.  I&#39;ve watched warriors<br/>
&gt; who aren&#39;t plate armored yet, and I take less damage than they when<br/>
&gt; tanking. And I only have an 80 AGI, so it&#39;s not that. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No... AC matters in a fight.  I would take a L30 Warrior in full Azure<br/>
over a L30 Warrior in full Steel Plate any day of the week.  Why?  Because<br/>
Azure has a higher AC per piece and therefore provides more protection<br/>
than Plate. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, Azure looks like Cloth armor.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But hey, whatever you want to do.  If you&#39;re in my group though, I won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; appreciate the higher percentage of the healers&#39; mana you&#39;ll be taking<br/>
&gt; to recover from the greater damage you&#39;ll be taking.  I suspect they<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t either. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*grin* You won&#39;t have to &quot;not appreciate it&quot;, because I won&#39;t be taking<br/>
the damage. <br/>
<br/>
AC matters.  Style (appearance) matters.  Choose which one matters more.<br/>
<br/>
In a fight, I know which one I would choose.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
