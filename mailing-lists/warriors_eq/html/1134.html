<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475070114">There are a couple of things that could be added to the warrior that may<br/>
help.  The critical strike is one of them,  somewhat akin to the backstab.<br/>
It should require a button, and should require a recycle time and render<br/>
kick and bash/slam inoperative.  Another option would be to lower the<br/>
recycle time of bash/slam and kick, and also changing so that you can kick<br/>
and bash/slam in the same round.  Another idea that has come up would be to<br/>
have a triple attack.   This would be nice, but it would have to be very<br/>
late in levels, maybe around 40.  Right now after level 15 the warrior only<br/>
has two levels to look for where they actually gain something: level 25 -<br/>
disarm, and 35 - riposte (if I am wrong on these please correct me:)  ).<br/>
There should be an additional skill at 20 and 30.  How about Bind Severe<br/>
Wounds that let you heal more and up to 75% of your total health (would use<br/>
the same skill as bind wounds, would just replace it).   How about a Sleep<br/>
skill?  Yes you heard me, Sleep.  Doubles your healing rate but turns your<br/>
screen blank for that period of time, kind of like you get when you are<br/>
blinded.  Would put us in more danger than the spell hurler that is<br/>
meditating.  These are just some suggestions that I have heard and thought<br/>
of myself.  Maybe if we got enough together and sent them to Verant as a<br/>
petition, they might listen.  They seem to be listening to alot of what<br/>
other players are saying.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; My thinking is that Verant has only balanced the classes up to a certain<br/>
&gt; level, say lvl 25 or so.<br/>
&gt; In this level range, the classes seem more balanced to me. <br/>
&gt; After that point they haven&#39;t put alot of thought into balancing the<br/>
&gt; warrior<br/>
&gt; class, or adding any sort of bonuses.<br/>
&gt; Hopefully if we will see Verant put in something soon.<br/>
&gt; Otherwise you are going to start seeing more and more people drop their<br/>
&gt; warriors for rangers or monks.<br/>

&gt; &gt; (I am in agreement with alot of what this post says.  I have never seen<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone put together so much detail concerning the downers of a warrior.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; too have been waiting for the levels when we start to shine as a group<br/>
&gt; &gt; member.  Not just a punchin bag that is expendable because if things go<br/>
&gt; &gt; very<br/>
&gt; &gt; wrong, we stand and take the death while everyone else can get away.<br/>
&gt; For a<br/>
&gt; &gt; long time now I have had discussions concerning specialization in a<br/>
&gt; weapon<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill or two.  This is mentioned again in this post, I would like to<br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt; &gt; everyones opinions on this.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Dyvim Kincaid<br/>
&gt; &gt; Stormriders of Cazic Thule.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Warrior&#39;s STINK.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Okay I&#39;ve sat down and written this little thingie over the past few<br/>
&gt; weeks,<br/>
&gt; &gt; in places it repeats itself, you may even find it<br/>
&gt; &gt; incoherant in places. And hell I&#39;m to lazy to load it up in a real word<br/>
&gt; &gt; processor to run a spell check (go notepad!). But<br/>
&gt; &gt; take it as it is, I think it still has something important to say:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I play a level 46 troll warrior in EverQuest. In most every game I play<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; always a warrior and fairly happy with the role<br/>
&gt; &gt; and abilities warriors are given in most games, wether it be an online<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; offline game. Now when I was making my troll<br/>
&gt; &gt; warrior I did a little research and heard things like this:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; - Warriors get more hitpoints than any other class.<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Warriors at high levels do more damage than any other melee class.<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Warriors have the best selection of magic and mundane weapons and<br/>
&gt; armor.<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Warriors are the most skilled at weapon-to-weapon combat.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now some of these are things people take for granted about the<br/>
&gt; sterotypical<br/>
&gt; &gt; role of a warrior others are conclusions that can<br/>
&gt; &gt; be made after reading comments made by Verant about warriors (wish I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; cliped the quotes to put here).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So for the first few levels I was pretty happy with the warrior, with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; trolls regeneration you can quickly get out of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; lower levels. My first observation of an imbalance was that all other<br/>
&gt; melee<br/>
&gt; &gt; classes were advancing just as fast in weapon<br/>
&gt; &gt; skills, with 5 additional points of offense and weapon skill each level.<br/>
&gt; So<br/>
&gt; &gt; that a level 10 Shadow Knight and a level 10<br/>
&gt; &gt; Warrior would both have the same weapon and offense skills (assuming<br/>
&gt; &gt; they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; using the same type of weapon). So I&#39;m saying<br/>
&gt; &gt; to myself what&#39;s the point of a warrior? Our melee skills are not<br/>
&gt; &gt; outshining<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So life goes on, now I&#39;m around level 20 or so and still I haven&#39;t found<br/>
&gt; &gt; any<br/>
&gt; &gt; equipment that puts warriors above others, our<br/>
&gt; &gt; skills are still on par with anyone else. So what about the duel wield,<br/>
&gt; &gt; double attack issue? Well by this level rangers get<br/>
&gt; &gt; them both, monks get them both (with a higher skill level than any<br/>
&gt; class),<br/>
&gt; &gt; thieves get them both. And so well warriors get<br/>
&gt; &gt; them both. So again I begin to question the point of warriors.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So now I start comparing hitpoints. Well rangers don&#39;t have as many<br/>
&gt; &gt; hitpoints.. but they can buff themselves and heal<br/>
&gt; &gt; themselves.. monks don&#39;t have as many hitpoints but they can mend<br/>
&gt; &gt; themselves<br/>
&gt; &gt; (and don&#39;t tell me, oh but if it fails they get<br/>
&gt; &gt; hurt bad, cuz I group regularly with a monk since level 37 and I have<br/>
&gt; yet<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; see him fail a mend)... ShadowKnights don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; &gt; as many hitpoints but they have HP drains... Paladin&#39;s don&#39;t have as<br/>
&gt; many<br/>
&gt; &gt; hitpoints but they can buff, heal and lay hands..<br/>
&gt; &gt; So in the end I actually end up having LESS hitpoints than most any<br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; &gt; melee class because after buffs and considering<br/>
&gt; &gt; healing and life drains the other melee classes (except rogues) have<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt; HP<br/>
&gt; &gt; than me. But being a troll with a high stanima<br/>
&gt; &gt; I get a few extra hitpoints here and there which add up to around 150<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt; HP over other melee classes (at level 46 mind<br/>
&gt; &gt; you). At level 46 this accounts for maybe two additional hits from a<br/>
&gt; &gt; monster<br/>
&gt; &gt; worth XP. So a warrior&#39;s benefit is not in<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s hitpoints.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So what about armor, they can wear most anything right, so they should<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; extra high AC? Well not quiet, even tho rangers<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t wear plate, they can wear most magical versions of it, and they<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; AC buffs. Paladins, ShadowKnights, Bards can all<br/>
&gt; &gt; wear plate also (man the acoustics of playing an instrument in full<br/>
&gt; &gt; platemail must be odd). And of course these classes ALSO<br/>
&gt; &gt; have AC buffs! Then there are monks, well they can&#39;t wear much armor..<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; the lighter they are the more AC they get! So<br/>
&gt; &gt; again I&#39;m left out saying, well what&#39;s a warrior good for?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So someone tells me, well most melee classes skills cap at level 30 and<br/>
&gt; &gt; warriors keep on going. Well level 30 rolls around,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and other melee classes keep right up with me. So maybe it&#39;s level 35<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; cap, nope. Well maybe they cap at level 40 and<br/>
&gt; &gt; warriors can goto above 200. Well level 40 rolls around and yes other<br/>
&gt; melee<br/>
&gt; &gt; classes do cap at 200, well warriors do ALSO!<br/>
&gt; &gt; UGH. I&#39;ve held out so long waiting for some benefit of warriors to shine<br/>
&gt; &gt; through, kept getting told at higher levels you<br/>
&gt; &gt; really shine! Well I&#39;m at the higher levels and if anything WARRIORS are<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; WORST melee class beyond level 40 (gauging my<br/>
&gt; &gt; experience with grouping with high level Rangers, Monks and<br/>
&gt; ShadowKnights).<br/>
&gt; &gt; In fact Monks don&#39;t cap at 40! They can go<br/>
&gt; &gt; above 200! But my Parry, Riposte, Pierce, 1h Slash, 2h slash, taunt,<br/>
&gt; bash,<br/>
&gt; &gt; ALL of them maxed at 200!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So then there is the allure of the Executioner&#39;s Axe. A warrior&#39;s dream<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapon, the only warrior only weapon known of (well<br/>
&gt; &gt; recently found a warrior only shield/weapon combo item but it ain&#39;t a<br/>
&gt; dream<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapon by far) and it is a good item (assuming<br/>
&gt; &gt; haste goes off often enough). But you can&#39;t get it till you are in your<br/>
&gt; &gt; 40&#39;s, the monster with it rarely has it, rarely<br/>
&gt; &gt; spawns, is deep in a dungeon and has a nice assortment of guards. And<br/>
&gt; now<br/>
&gt; &gt; that I finally have the weapon, I find out it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; TERRIBLLY handicapped! The haste on it only lasts 10 seconds which at<br/>
&gt; most<br/>
&gt; &gt; allows for 3 or 4 swings! And the damage range<br/>
&gt; &gt; is so large it&#39;s a hopeless weapon as you never know if you&#39;ll get a<br/>
&gt; &gt; hundred<br/>
&gt; &gt; 9 damage hits or a hundred 80 damage hits! I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; gone complete fights without doing more than 100HP in damage! With upto<br/>
&gt; 12<br/>
&gt; &gt; misses in a row! In 4 duels, 2 using<br/>
&gt; &gt; Executioners Axe, 2 using Painbringer and Shield of The Slain Unicorn.<br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; with Executioners Axe were a 50/50 chance that<br/>
&gt; &gt; if we had gone to death who would of won (mind you I was dueling a<br/>
&gt; &gt; ShadowKnight who was using buffs but NOT using his other<br/>
&gt; &gt; spells and was 4 levels below me). Using the sword and shield combo I<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; the clear winner. Not to mention the fact a<br/>
&gt; &gt; class should NOT be defined by a SINGLE weapon they can&#39;t get until<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; almost level 50!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And on a side note why do warriors seem to have to wait LAST to get a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;superweapon&quot;? I&#39;ve found (or friends have) caster,<br/>
&gt; &gt; ranger, paladin &quot;superweapons&quot; and know where an SK one is that we can<br/>
&gt; kill<br/>
&gt; &gt; the monster with it but it rarely has the item is<br/>
&gt; &gt; the problem. Man I&#39;m so fed up. And of course if I had my choice I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; much<br/>
&gt; &gt; rather duel wield 2 Ebony Blades as they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; better than Painbringer (which btw is a lore, nodrop item so forget duel<br/>
&gt; &gt; wielding the only nice warrior weapon I&#39;ve ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; seen).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So now that I&#39;ve disproved about every advantaged you&#39;d figure warriors<br/>
&gt; &gt; would have here some other general ranting:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; On top of all this Monk&#39;s NEVER die if they know how to use Fiegn Death<br/>
&gt; &gt; (the<br/>
&gt; &gt; monk I group with has died twice from level<br/>
&gt; &gt; 37 to 49, while I have died 8 times between level 45 and 46 alone).<br/>
&gt; Shadow<br/>
&gt; &gt; Knights have Feign Death (as a spell) and<br/>
&gt; &gt; invisibility! Rangers get similiar abilities (though generally outdoors<br/>
&gt; &gt; only). So most classes have ways to avoid being<br/>
&gt; &gt; attacked or ways of getting out of being attacked. Except warriors. So<br/>
&gt; &gt; since<br/>
&gt; &gt; we can&#39;t avoid fights and we can&#39;t get out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; a fight the everything over level 18 is aggressive rule REALLY screws<br/>
&gt; &gt; warriors over as we have to fight through EVERYTHING to<br/>
&gt; &gt; get to anything.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Okay then I&#39;ve finally found something I can solo for XP when my friends<br/>
&gt; &gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; not around to group with me. Well in general<br/>
&gt; &gt; those monsters will run away and are deep in dungeons, and warrior&#39;s<br/>
&gt; CANNOT<br/>
&gt; &gt; handle runners! Rangers get ensnares and roots<br/>
&gt; &gt; (and Ebony Blades), SKs get darknesses, or heck they have mana to burn<br/>
&gt; &gt; things up with. Even a monk can chase things down<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill it and if anyone else attacks they just fiegn death! UGH UGH UGH<br/>
&gt; UGH<br/>
&gt; &gt; UGH. SO WHAT IS THE POINT OF WARRIORS?!?!?!? Can<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone tell me?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Please? And don&#39;t say it&#39;s a low XP table. The XP tables in Everquest<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; SO<br/>
&gt; &gt; messed up it&#39;s not even funny. They&#39;re messed<br/>
&gt; &gt; up to the point that a monk gets almost 2 levels to my 1 level and the<br/>
&gt; Monk<br/>
&gt; &gt; is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much more powerful than I<br/>
&gt; &gt; am, not to mention they RARELY die.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We are not the lords of battle in any stretch of the mind in the world<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Norrath. Look at the original four things I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; stated. Well I&#39;ve disproved them all. Heck even worse other melee<br/>
&gt; classes<br/>
&gt; &gt; spells still improve (and they get new ones) past<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 40 so that means their buffs get better, but my skills are all<br/>
&gt; parked<br/>
&gt; &gt; at 200 (well offense and defense goto 210)! And<br/>
&gt; &gt; well monks they might not have as high ATK as me, but hell they&#39;re still<br/>
&gt; &gt; getting quadruple (!!!!!) punches for over 50 damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; a hit and kicks over 80 damage! WTF! THIS MAKES NO SENSE. Assuming I got<br/>
&gt; &gt; MAX<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage in a single round using a Gigiantic<br/>
&gt; &gt; Zweihander I would do 130 damage in 3.9 seconds, or with an Ashenwood<br/>
&gt; Spear<br/>
&gt; &gt; and Polished Granite Tomahawk I would do 104<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage in 2.4 seconds. But of course I&#39;ve never gotten anywhere NEAR max<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage. Now compare this to a Monks max damage,<br/>
&gt; &gt; 200+ damage just with punches in approximately 3.0 seconds! This just<br/>
&gt; &gt; really<br/>
&gt; &gt; sucks.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And of course there are the past few patches. I see things changing for<br/>
&gt; &gt; other classes making them MORE powerful and here I<br/>
&gt; &gt; sit being SCREWED over ROYALLY. But warriors can wear platemail! Well<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; &gt; other melee classes can wear various forms of<br/>
&gt; &gt; magic platemail (mithril, silvered, rubicite, pick your poison) so that<br/>
&gt; &gt; discussion is null and void. So in the end I cannot<br/>
&gt; &gt; think of a single advantage warriors have over ANY other class AT ALL.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thank<br/>
&gt; &gt; you Verant for setting me up for the fall. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t expect warriors to rule the earth at level 50, and I NEVER expect<br/>
&gt; &gt; them EVER to be a heavy solo class beyond the early<br/>
&gt; &gt; levels, but hey at least let us be the kings of melee combat or share<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; title with monks. And with less mana now spent<br/>
&gt; &gt; when a spell fizzles and spell specilization (in or on it&#39;s way) you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; made<br/>
&gt; &gt; every casting class just that much more<br/>
&gt; &gt; powerful.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; They could double the ammount of damage a warrior could dish out and it<br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t seriously disrupt things (I&#39;m not saying<br/>
&gt; &gt; this is a viable solution, just that if it was done we&#39;d be the lords of<br/>
&gt; &gt; battle but still couldn&#39;t solo). Hell at level 40<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t even solo a GREEN Cyclops, yet my monk friend albeit with some<br/>
&gt; &gt; difficulty can at least solo a BLUE griffon). If I<br/>
&gt; &gt; did twice the damage sure I could solo it but then when it ran away I<br/>
&gt; still<br/>
&gt; &gt; would not be able to finish it due to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; tons of other monsters that would join in (not to mention the poor<br/>
&gt; &gt; prediction code which makes it so hard to chase things).<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks Verant. Damnit I&#39;m so pissed. Why couldn&#39;t you at least let our<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapon skills goto 255? Why is a ranger just as<br/>
&gt; &gt; good at me in melee combat and have spells? Why do monks just completely<br/>
&gt; &gt; kick my ass? And in a monk vs warrior duel at high<br/>
&gt; &gt; levels the time it would take would be over 5 mintues (or I should say<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; time it would take me to kill a monk would be over<br/>
&gt; &gt; 5 minutes, although a monk could prolly kill me in less than 5 minutes)<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; length so a monk would end up getting more than 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; mend during the fight making his HP total far outweigh any warriors.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The only thing I got going for me is being a troll with high regen and<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; extra strength and stanima. But this doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; ammount to much considering we can do NO QUESTS (Verant WHERE THE HELL<br/>
&gt; ARE<br/>
&gt; &gt; THE TROLL QUESTS IN GROBB?), I can&#39;t get good<br/>
&gt; &gt; faction with other places enough to do quests. And everything under the<br/>
&gt; sun<br/>
&gt; &gt; hates me. The whole faction system is so dumb<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the end the only people it hurts are evil races. Bleh well now I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; off<br/>
&gt; &gt; the topic of why warriors get SCREWED, why trolls<br/>
&gt; &gt; get screwed is a whole different topic. So goodday to those who&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; bothered<br/>
&gt; &gt; to read this from start to finish. If I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; overlooked something significant let me know. I&#39;d love to know my<br/>
&gt; character<br/>
&gt; &gt; is worth something. Warriors from level 42<br/>
&gt; &gt; onward GET NOTHING. Oh and our flaunted taunt skill, well the farther<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; teammates move above level 40 the more worthless<br/>
&gt; &gt; the skill becomes to the point now I can rarely taunt anything off<br/>
&gt; anyone.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And why when I use a 2 handed weapon does taunt<br/>
&gt; &gt; work ALOT less than when I use 2 one handed weapons? Damnit Verant I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; fed up, will you quit tweaking every class into<br/>
&gt; &gt; superhuman beings and pay attention to warriors for a BRIEF second to<br/>
&gt; come<br/>
&gt; &gt; up with something besides &quot;Beserking Frenzy&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Beserking Frenzy? This is supposed to be something good? Please Verant,<br/>
&gt; &gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; it says &quot;You have entered a beserking frenzy&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; that&#39;s my cue to zone cuz I&#39;m going to die if I stick around. I guess<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; not fair to complain so much about my class<br/>
&gt; &gt; without a suggestion or two to make warriors a more viable class to<br/>
&gt; play.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If<br/>
&gt; &gt; I were to rebalance the warrior class I would<br/>
&gt; &gt; do 2 simple things.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 1) Let our weapon skills goto 255. This includes 1h slash, 2h slash,<br/>
&gt; &gt; piercing, 1h blunt, 2h blunt and offense maybe even<br/>
&gt; &gt; riposte and or parry. Perhaps not even all the way upto 255 but<br/>
&gt; somewhere<br/>
&gt; &gt; above other melee classes and enough that it<br/>
&gt; &gt; makes a noticable differance in combat.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2) Allow a warrior to specialize in 1 or 2 forms of weapons (for<br/>
&gt; instance<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1h<br/>
&gt; &gt; and 2h slash, or piercing and 1h blunt). Your<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill in specilization reduces your weapon delay, not by tons. But lets<br/>
&gt; say<br/>
&gt; &gt; you have a 1h slash specilization of 200,<br/>
&gt; &gt; any 1h slash weapon you wield would be swung 10 percent faster than it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; given delay, maybe even only 5 percent but<br/>
&gt; &gt; something slightly faster.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Some other things I&#39;d consider doing:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 1) Let our defensive skills go up higher than 210 also.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2) Let us have access to ALL weapon and armor except the class specific<br/>
&gt; &gt; items (robes, monk headbands, bard instruments).<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3) Make gate potions more available and more reliable (I&#39;ve used a gate<br/>
&gt; &gt; potions in which it tells me the zone is loading<br/>
&gt; &gt; only to find myself a few minutes later standing right where I was when<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; drank the potion and then promptly killed)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Even if you did all of these things you are not significantly changing<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; balance of the game at all as the warrior&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; biggest weaknesses are still it&#39;s down fall, we can&#39;t get out of a tight<br/>
&gt; &gt; situation, and we can&#39;t heal ourselves. At most<br/>
&gt; &gt; this enables us to keep up with Monks damage wise and also to pull our<br/>
&gt; &gt; selves apart from melee classes and MAYBE be the best<br/>
&gt; &gt; melee class. And at least be considered a viable member of a group.<br/>
