<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081629259"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; AC IS NOT EVERYTHING!  AC is the second half, and the lesser half, of<br/>
&gt;&gt; the armor system in Everquest.  The first half is damage absorption. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;According to Verant, AC _is_ everything.  There is no &#39;intrinsic&#39; damage<br/>
&gt;absorption element for different armors.  Rather, their relative damage<br/>
&gt;absorption and protective effects are stored in the AC value.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes as a matter of fact there is.  Regular leather, studded leather, and <br/>
reinforced leather (I believe) all have ths same stats in AC and weight, but <br/>
have incresingly higher damage absorption values.  Otherwise, what would be <br/>
the point of studded and reinforced leather?</div>
