First, from some comments you made I can see you&#39;re<br/>
another player who doesn&#39;t understand the Everquest<br/>
armor system.<br/>
<br/>
AC IS NOT EVERYTHING!  AC is the second half, and the<br/>
lesser half, of the armor system in Everquest.  The<br/>
first half is damage absorption.  The armor sequence<br/>
is:<br/>
<br/>
Naked &gt; Cloth &gt; Patchwork &gt; Leather &gt; Ringmail &gt;<br/>
Chainmail &gt; Banded &gt; Plate<br/>
<br/>
Each level of armor absorbs more damage than the<br/>
levels before it.  If you doubt, try it.  Fight<br/>
something on your level naked and see how badly you<br/>
get hit; every shot will come in at max damage.  Put<br/>
your armor back on and see shots hitting for 2, 5,<br/>
etc... <br/>
<br/>
Look at Rangers, who can&#39;t wear better than banded,<br/>
fighting along side a Warrior.  Ranger in full banded,<br/>
dual wielding; gets hammered and has to be healed much<br/>
more often than the dual wielding Warrior in full<br/>
plate.  Warrior takes less damage per shot.  Put the<br/>
Warrior in banded and watch him start taking damage<br/>
like the Ranger, needing more heals.  PLATE IS WORTH<br/>
IT.<br/>
<br/>
Plate is a requirement to be an effective tank past<br/>
20ish.  Now you have to make some concessions for good<br/>
buffs (I still wear *my* Spiked Collar for the +3<br/>
Strength; but it&#39;s just a collar), but you want to be<br/>
in mostly plate.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; collar of undead prot =&gt; Spiked Collar (+3 STR) <br/>
&gt; - ive got a spiked collar but went in favour of the<br/>
&gt; undead one...with better AC<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personal taste.  I value, right now, stat enhancement<br/>
over saves.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; blackened helm =&gt; Bronze Helm or B.Iron Crown <br/>
&gt; --- sorry i menat B iron crown, not blackened helm<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Stick with the Crown then; +5 STR is sweet and is<br/>
worth taking the Chainmail hit on the head for.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; barbed arms =&gt; Bronze Arms   --- my barbed arms<br/>
&gt; are only 1 ac less than bronze, but give +2 dex<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See above comments about plate vs chain (which is what<br/>
barbed armor is equalivalent to).  +2 Dex isn&#39;t worth<br/>
the plate armor value at 30th level.  Get Dex rings if<br/>
you&#39;re looking for Dex.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; lizardscale cloak =&gt; Bronze Cloak --- lizard is<br/>
&gt; same Ac as bronze but lighter and plus 5 dex<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See above comments about plate.  +5 Dex is much better<br/>
than +2 for Barbed Arms, but it&#39;s still kinda grey. <br/>
You might want to stick with this one, maybe.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t protect as well as plate though.<br/>
<br/>
My 25th Paladin is set up like this:<br/>
<br/>
PG Tomahawk<br/>
SB Shield<br/>
Bronze Helm<br/>
+2 AGI Onyx Earrings (2)<br/>
+7 DEX Grotesque Mask<br/>
+3 STR Spiked Collar<br/>
+3 STR, +10 Magic BS Mantle<br/>
Bronze Arms<br/>
+3 DEX, +1 STR Bracer of Battle<br/>
+5 STR Bracer of Erollsi<br/>
Bronze Gauntlets<br/>
+2 STR Rings (2)<br/>
Bronze Breastplate<br/>
Bronze Cloak<br/>
Bronze Girdle<br/>
Bronze Legs<br/>
Bronze Boots<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently looking for Dwarven Workboots and a<br/>
Blackened Iron Crown.  Workboots are a rare drop, but<br/>
I&#39;m patient (and willing to pay well); problem with<br/>
the BI Crown is I *hate* Runnyeye (very dangerous<br/>
dungeon, imo); and the KS Wizards who show up with a<br/>
BI Crown aren&#39;t interested in selling.  Every BI Crown<br/>
I see is for trade only in exchange for caster items. <br/>
GRRRRRRRR.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to trade my Onyx Earrings for Gold-Amber (+3<br/>
STR each), and my +2 STR Rings for Gold-Onyx (+5 DEX<br/>
each).  If I could just find someone who works Gold<br/>
....<br/>
<br/>
My current &#39;buff&#39; set up is +16 STR, +4 AGI (which I&#39;m<br/>
going to dump for more STR and DEX), and +10 DEX.  I<br/>
also have a Savant&#39;s Cap, two +2 INT rings and a BI<br/>
Medallion; I can be +10 INT when I&#39;m training skills,<br/>
which comes in hand when you&#39;re naturally 60 INT.  If<br/>
I can get the Workboots, BI Crown and switch my rings<br/>
and earrings like I want, my buffs will look like<br/>
this: +26 STR, +25 DEX.  That would put STR at 136 and<br/>
DEX at 115.<br/>
