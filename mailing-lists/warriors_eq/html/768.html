<div id="ygrps-yiv-719483190">Well Im doin exacly what you didnt like but I know no other way, hehe<br/>
I too live in another time zone and I like helping out.<br/>
so thats why I sometimes write about 20 mails in a row,<br/>
Wich, when thinkin about it, is realy stupid.<br/>
<br/>
Ill try to do it a different way.<br/>
<br/>
Have the title of the mail read &quot;Vashis words of wisdom&quot; hehe<br/>
<br/>
take care.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Im sorry.  I am the main person doing this and Ill try to cut out one line<br/>
&gt;non-sensical posts completely out.  I will also begin to trim the giant<br/>
&gt;emails as well.  I will also check to see if someone has answered the<br/>
&gt;question or made a comment I was going to make from now on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think the main reason you will see lots of posts from me in a row is that<br/>
&gt;I live in a different time zone.  When you guys are asleep im at work<br/>
&gt;reading the list.  Therefore when you wake up in the morning you will see<br/>
&gt;lots of emails from me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thats not an excuse but one of the reasons why you will see a lot of emails<br/>
&gt;from me in one chunk and then none for a 24 hour stint.  Ill try and cut<br/>
&gt;back, but I really like this list and perhaps I get to excited when <br/>
&gt;replying<br/>
&gt;:)<br/>
