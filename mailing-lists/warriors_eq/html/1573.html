platinum is quite silly, although I disagree with your last sentence.  You <br/>
payed the $50 for the game, right?  You&#39;re paying the $9 per month to play <br/>
it, right?  If your reasoning for not buying the stuff from eBay is that what <br/>
you buy doesn&#39;t exist, then forking over cash to Verant for the same thing <br/>
would be hypocritical.</div>
