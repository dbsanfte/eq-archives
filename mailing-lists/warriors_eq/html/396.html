<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431869251">15-16 Blackburrow.  Killing guardsmen still gives you some exps and you<br/>
can take elites or commanders one on one, or group for rooms full of<br/>
them. Lots of people here, but if you know the zone well, there are<br/>
plenty of gnolls for all.  Also a good place to bash gnolls and alot<br/>
less crowed, is PAW.  hard to find solo commanders here, or nobles, but<br/>
get 1-2 others of your level and kill rex, or nobles or commanders for<br/>
really nice exps/time spent averages.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a bit lost as to where I should be hunting right now.<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; I have reached level 15, I am almost 16.� I have maxed both dual wield<br/>
&gt; and double attack at 80 each.� I seem to be having trouble effectively<br/>
&gt; hunting.� Anything that cons white to me is always a tough fight that<br/>
&gt; can go either way, so I usually end up sticking to blue critters.�<br/>
&gt; However some blue critters are just to tough to solo.� Lava basilisks<br/>
&gt; are a no-no because of Stone Breath, fire elementals have some kind of<br/>
&gt; damage shield which causes me damage each time I hit so they are a<br/>
&gt; no-no also.�� Lavastorm being my preferred hunting area right now.� I<br/>
&gt; tried crocs in Oasis, but it is to crowded when I play (8pm-10pm) for<br/>
&gt; me to even find anything to kill.<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; I guess I am at that awkward level and was looking for advice from<br/>
&gt; other warriors on how they got fro 15 to 16.<br/>
