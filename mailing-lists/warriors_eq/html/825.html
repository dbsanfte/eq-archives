&gt;<br/>
&gt;Got to agree with a previous poster about the huge amounts of mail that come<br/>
&gt;in on this list, it gets a bit much.  And the digest mode is just about<br/>
&gt;useless, as everyone who RE:&#39;s keeps including the full text from the<br/>
&gt;previous poster, resulting in literally 100&#39;s of lines of text per email.<br/>
&gt;Is it really necessary to include the full body of the 10 previous responses<br/>
&gt;to a post in an post that doesn&#39;t even address the subject anymore?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry for the criticism, I do get a lot out of this list and hope to be able<br/>
&gt;to contribute to it as I level up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Definite agreement there.  What really irks me is when someone quotes a whole <br/>
digest in their post.  Cut-and-paste is NOT a difficult process, people.  90% <br/>
of the time these digests I get are too big to be read online and I have to <br/>
download them.  Of course then I often don&#39;t have the time to go back and <br/>
read it or I just forget its there.<br/>
<br/>
But onto other warrior-related topics:  I have a story that led to a <br/>
particularly interesting problem.  Currently I am an 8th lvl warrior on <br/>
Cazic-Thule who adventures around the Freeport environs: Desert of Ro, <br/>
Commonlands, et al.  One day in the desert this nasty little dark elf <br/>
shadowknight has hanging around and this guy is a known kill-stealer and a <br/>
real jerk (anyone who frequents the desert *might* know who I&#39;m t/*alking <br/>
about).  He was hanging around our party making rude gestures at us and <br/>
calling us really nasty names.  Then he seemed to go away.  A little while <br/>
later I spotted him fighting a giant spider so I figured I&#39;d teach him a <br/>
little lesson.  I ran over and attacked it myself, and he starts telling me <br/>
to back off.  Of course it didn&#39;t matter much because he easily defeated it <br/>
quickly thereafter.  &quot;Oh well,&quot; I thought, &quot;His comeuppance shall be had <br/>
another day.&quot;  I then ran over to attack an orc.  Well this little pest <br/>
followed me over and killed off the orc I was fighting, then told me that was <br/>
my punishment for trying to steal his kill.  This got me really angry.  I <br/>
wanted to challenge him to a duel but he was one level higher than I and had <br/>
some really good armor to boot so I figured I would lose.  I took a <br/>
screenshot of him using foul language and sent a petition, but I was told by <br/>
a GM to just work it out myself.  Some verbal tennis was had between my party <br/>
and this dark elf, but other than shooting off a few tart zingers we were <br/>
pretty much up a creek with this guy.<br/>
<br/>
What is one to do in a situation like this?  Has anyone else ever come across <br/>
this kind of thing?  What did you do about it?</div>
