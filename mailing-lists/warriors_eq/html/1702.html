<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025996255">sigh..  Things are not as bad as you guys think.<br/>
<br/>
Warriors CAN still tank better then paladins and sks.  We were never meant<br/>
to be the ultimate damage dealers.  It has just evolved to everyone thinking<br/>
we have to dish mad damage to keep the critter on us to do our job.  The<br/>
only thing they have hosed us with is the ability to taunt in higher level<br/>
situations.  And to top that off, they remove the taunt to our proccing<br/>
weapons.<br/>
<br/>
No one has the amount of HP we have, no one has the AC we have.  No one can<br/>
eat damage and stay live like we do.<br/>
<br/>
Find a group where people play their classes instead of just go kill things<br/>
and you will see what I mean.  If the ranger is getting his ass kicked<br/>
because he is outdamaging us, then he is not doing his job and is putting<br/>
the whole group in danger because the cleric is spending their mana to keep<br/>
him alive.  Remember, a 600mana rez is alot more mana efficient then 3 comps<br/>
and a bunch of smaller heals to keep that ranger kicking.  If the paladin or<br/>
sk is tanking, then they are not doing their job because they are not taking<br/>
the damage as well as a warrior.  It is all about how you play your class,<br/>
not what abilities you have or dont have.<br/>

&gt; Is it just me being negative again, or did this<br/>
&gt; latest patch make Warriors an even more useless<br/>
&gt; comodity in a group now? Go get your Shadow<br/>
&gt; Knights and Paladins all, Warriors don&#39;t mean<br/>
&gt; shit in this game now...<br/>
