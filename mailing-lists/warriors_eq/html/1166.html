<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-492410243">I believe that warriors are necessary in a group only to the high teen-low <br/>
twenties.  When most hybrid-magic user classes get to that level they can <br/>
either root, or get a pet that will engage the creature while he or she <br/>
casts (wherein they usually don&#39;t need long because they deal out the most <br/>
damage).  I am a lev 17 warrior and blue cons can take me down to 1/3 hp, it <br/>
then takes me a half hour to heal back up.  While I have a cleric who is <br/>
taking on white cons with little problem.  I have to agree that warriors are <br/>
necessary, but only to the level before casters come into their own. And fyi <br/>
I have a fellow mate who is a level 18 wiz with all his points put into int <br/>
and he has only 100 less hp than I have. Another overlooked characteristic <br/>
is that casters can hit magic only creatures from the begining, while <br/>
warriors have to run around for weeks trying to save up the money for a <br/>
special weapon (wich are way overpriced), and most of the time we end up <br/>
running from green con&#39;s because we can&#39;t hit them.  I only use my warrior <br/>
now to get money and equipment for other characters and roleplay.<br/>

&gt;I whole heartedly agree with you wayne.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The game is about balance. Some people are saying that a group of really<br/>
&gt;high levels do not need warriors. I say thats BS my friends always want my<br/>
&gt;warrior in their group. Not just becuase im company mind you. Because they<br/>
&gt;are spell casters. If im not there, the MOB would latch onto them and<br/>
&gt;interrupt their casting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sure we could beg verant for one more skill .... critical hit , which is a<br/>
&gt;very good idea. And i like the idea of it being like ripsote and parry.<br/>
&gt;Makes more sense. But the fact of the matter is this: We are there to<br/>
&gt;prevent our spellcasting buddies from being hit by creatures so that THEY<br/>
&gt;can dish out the damage. I have never had anyone complain to me and say <br/>
&gt;look<br/>
&gt;man we dont want you in the group anymore cause you doont dish out the most<br/>
&gt;damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Every group needs a good strong warrior.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Many of the Warriors here have complained that they cannot do damage as<br/>
&gt; &gt; fast<br/>
&gt; &gt; as a Wizard.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now all of you real life ninjas and steel sword swinging fools just calm<br/>
&gt; &gt; down.  Read carefully.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Warriors get to wear platemail and have many more hps than a Wizard.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Warriors also have a higher Offense, Defense, and Weapon skills.  This <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt; &gt; means that a Warrior can stand toe to toe against an NPC.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now lets make a Warrior have the same ability to deal damage as a <br/>
&gt;Wizard.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now we would have a class that has the best armor, the highest combat<br/>
&gt; &gt; skills, the most hp&#39;s AND the ability to deal the most damage.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Why would anyone want to play a Wizard if a Warrior could do as much<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; AND be able to take blows in melee?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wayne<br/>
&gt; &gt; PS - When someone says that a Warrior should be able to deal as much<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; as fast as a Wizard I immediately realize this person doesn&#39;t have a <br/>
&gt;clue<br/>
&gt; &gt; about game balance.<br/>
