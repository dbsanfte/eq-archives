<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570709638">Noting in Crushbone will attack a Dark Elf.  I have strolled threw there on<br/>
many an occasion with Jaade.  The Dwarven Bandits and the two Ogres will<br/>
also NOT attack a Dark Elf.  As long as she didn&#39;t attacked D&#39;Vinn she will<br/>
be fine.  D&#39;Vinn conned amiable to me.<br/>
<br/>
Warn your friend that if she continues to kill Crushbone orcs, she will come<br/>
home to Neriak one day and have not home - which means no training either.<br/>

&gt; Will a mob kill your whole party if it is attacked by just one individual?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes and no. I&#39;ve had an interesting experience while being partied with a<br/>
&gt; friend<br/>
&gt; who plays a rogue. Most of the group has problems with the tough mobs and<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; die if it starts attacking the party .... except for the rogue.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s an example. While doing the screaming mace quest we were camped in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; tower of Crushbone waiting for Emperor Crush to arrive. Assured that<br/>
&gt; Ambassador<br/>
&gt; Dvinn was at the zone killing newbies, we continued to wait without any<br/>
&gt; concern.<br/>
&gt; Suddenly Crush spawns ... no problem, we begin the whacking. Then, about 3<br/>
&gt; or 4<br/>
&gt; seconds later, Dvinn spawns. Wham Wham Wham, one down ... etc until 5<br/>
&gt; party<br/>
&gt; members were dead, none even made it past the throne.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Except for the rogue who sat there plain as day, probably messing herself<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; the fear. He never touched her, and in fact conned to her as indifferent I<br/>
&gt; believe. She was able to do corpse retrievals for some of us as we all<br/>
&gt; waited at<br/>
&gt; the zone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Soooooo, I think as long as the mob is dubious or auto-attack toward<br/>
&gt; everyone in<br/>
&gt; your group, then yes, he will kill the whole group. I guess it pays to<br/>
&gt; take a<br/>
&gt; dark elf or rogue along with you at times.<br/>

&gt; &gt; As a side note.  If one of your group is engaged on combat by and<br/>
&gt; &gt; mob...named or not....then once your party member is dead the mob will<br/>
&gt; come<br/>
&gt; &gt; after the next closest party member and so on till all are dead or<br/>
&gt; zoned, or<br/>
&gt; &gt; you kill the mob.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; When a giant attacks a party member...first thing I do is DISBAND! Same<br/>
&gt; goes<br/>
&gt; &gt; for anything that can wipe out the whole party.  We disband and then<br/>
&gt; regroup<br/>
&gt; &gt; when the danger is passed. Then the whole party doesn&#39;t have to run to<br/>
&gt; zone<br/>
&gt; &gt; to regroup which can save considerable time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This can upset some people so it is best to make sure everyone<br/>
&gt; understands<br/>
&gt; &gt; before it happens.  To many people die becuase giants can destroy a<br/>
&gt; party<br/>
&gt; &gt; before anyone realizes the trouble.  90+  damage per hit makes short<br/>
&gt; work of<br/>
&gt; &gt; most players especially after being stunned.<br/>
