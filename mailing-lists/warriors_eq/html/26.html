<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065996545">I cant really offer an opinion on the Weapon side beyond try getting a<br/>
couple of long swords or scimitars to dual weild.  Dual wield REALLY drinks<br/>
your stamina at first.  Mino axes do more damage but they also weigh a lot<br/>
more.<br/>
As far as skills and training points go<br/>
check this page.. they have a few player guides up and its still being<br/>
constructed<br/>

<br/>
the warrior guide is up at least and it might help you on a few points.<br/>

&gt; Hi all. I&#39;ve trolled this list a little and you guys all seem to give<br/>
&gt; great advice. I was wondering if you could guide a first time EQ player<br/>
&gt; on his future...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a level 7 human warrior in Qeynos:<br/>
&gt; Max 1H-Slash for my level<br/>
&gt; Max Kick for my level<br/>
&gt; Max Sense Direction for my level<br/>
&gt; 30+ Offense<br/>
&gt; 20+ Defense<br/>
&gt; 10 or so Bash<br/>
&gt; 1 in 1H-Bashing<br/>
&gt; 1 in 2H-Slashing (No weapon yet)<br/>
&gt; 0 in Hand-to-Hand<br/>
&gt; 3 in Bind Wounds (I never use it)<br/>
&gt; 30+ Fishing<br/>
&gt; 10+ Tailoring (Great combo with the fishing. I make money for the<br/>
&gt; patterns)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My question is what skills/weapons should I actively pursue more than<br/>
&gt; others?? I&#39;ve guessed so far just from things I&#39;ve read on the net.<br/>
&gt; Should I ever put more than one practice in a weapon??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance for replies,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
