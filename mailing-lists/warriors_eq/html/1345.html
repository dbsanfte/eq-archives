<div id="ygrps-yiv-786664641">This is not really a warrior question, but you guys might know how to do it. <br/>
  I have an enchanter friend who would like to enchant ore in order to make <br/>
magical armor.  We have looked forever trying to find the spell to enchant <br/>
ore but can&#39;t.  I&#39;m sure you guys can understand the importance of magical <br/>
armor.  Anyway we want to make it to sell cheap to other players.  If anyone <br/>
has played around with this or knows anything about it please tell.<br/>
