&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hail, I&#39;m a 21st level Barbarian Warrior on Rallos Zek.� Currently I dual<br/>
&gt; wield polished granite tomahawk axes (don&#39;t ask about how long it took me,<br/>
&gt; or how many fools try to take them away) and can safely say they kick so<br/>
&gt; much ass. How else can a Warrior steal kills from a Caster???� Anyway, I<br/>
&gt; currently only have ringmail and some banded for armor and what I really<br/>
&gt; want is plate.� Bronze plate I hear is fairly reasonable, though heavy,<br/>
&gt; which shouldn&#39;t be a problem with my high Strength.� Does anyone know<br/>
&gt; where the best place to acquire Medium sized Bronze plate is?� I&#39;ve got my<br/>
&gt; weapons, and now I need to beef up my armor.<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
