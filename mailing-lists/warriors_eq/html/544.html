<div id="ygrps-yiv-494473768">This seems to be the most camped weapon that i&#39;ve ever seen.  No matter<br/>
what time i goto Highpass, there&#39;s always at least one group just sitting<br/>
there waiting for endless hours for the gnoll to spawn. <br/>
<br/>
My question is this:<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know the anticamp and timing of the gnoll that carries the<br/>
weapon?<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t believe that there is an anticamp for weapons, and those<br/>
who don&#39;t, let me give you an example to prove that there is.<br/>
<br/>
CHITIN SHIELD<br/>
<br/>
Some talk was going on about getting the chitin shield and that you had to<br/>
kill a giant heart spider to get it, which is located in Guk.  I went to<br/>
Guk over four separate occasions for many many hours, each and every time<br/>
being unsuccessful.  One kind person posted a respawn list of what would<br/>
come next, but even that proved to be wrong.  A guildmate of mine and I<br/>
had an idea though.  He had recently figured out the anticamp spot and<br/>
timer for getting the BBC and Gossimer robe, so we decided to experiment.<br/>
We did figure it out, and this is how it goes.<br/>
<br/>
Kill everything inside the room where the giant heart spider is supposed<br/>
to spawn. DO NOT LOOT ANYTHING UNTIL EVERYTHING IS DEAD.  When everything<br/>
is dead, loot quick, and run out of the room and go behind the corridor.<br/>
The little hall outside of the room has a darker floor, then there is a<br/>
lower lighter floor, and another darker one nearer the water. Have your<br/>
party all stand on the darker floor there and wait for 16 minutes after<br/>
the person who looted the giant heart or the large or whatever was<br/>
spawned. If you want to give it an extra minute, you can do so.  If<br/>
everyone followed the rules, when you all run in, there should be another<br/>
giant heart spider with the chitin shield again for you. I have tested<br/>
this and successfully done it on three occasions, so it DOES work.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the tomahawk discussion and one more thing.. I don&#39;t know how it<br/>
is on all of your servers, but I play on Solusek Ro, and I&#39;m disgusted<br/>
with the players and people on the server.  People charging 100 to over<br/>
200 plat for a rare item.  In beta, an item rarely went over 20 plat, and<br/>
if it did, by that time, you were in your mid twenties in level and could<br/>
get it without a problem or could afford to pay for it. I am a level 19<br/>
warrior and also have a level 19 druid, and i do NOT have 100 to 200 plat<br/>
to spend on anything but the things to keep my character advancing.<br/>
Spells for my druid and armor for my warrior.  Those people who do have<br/>
that cash at early levels must have a LOT of time on their hands.<br/>
<br/>
I got my char to almost level 20 in 6 days and 20 some hours.  This isn&#39;t<br/>
that spectaular, but i fight to get experience and i fight well. I work<br/>
full time and am also a full time student at a university. I do not have<br/>
the time to run around and kill wisps or whatever people with big bank<br/>
accounts do. The reason why i want to share the spawn information with you<br/>
guys is because I hope you will help me in lowering the disgusting<br/>
inflated prices of the game. Give items to players or sell them for cheap.<br/>
It&#39;s what I and some good members of my guild do.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading and hopefully someone knows the info for the tomahawk.<br/>
I&#39;d really love to get one or two for my dual wield.<br/>
