Studded is identical to Leather but can be created by trade skills.  That<br/>
is the advantage to Studded (slight or negligable as it seems).<br/>
<br/>
Reinforced Leather (I believe) has a higher AC and thus is _better_ than<br/>
both normal and Studded Leather.<br/>
<br/>
I have direct confirmation from Verant that AC is the Damage Absorption<br/>
constant.  There are no other values for damage absorption hidden.  <br/>
<br/>
To maximize damage absorption, maximize AC.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just the way it is.<br/>
