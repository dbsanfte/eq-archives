 </span></blockquote>Uh ... ok.  If you say so.  I call Paladins &#39;self-filling tanks&#39;,<br/>
because they are just that.  They&#39;re not really effective until they<br/>
get Meditate at 12th, but once there they can do a solo fight that<br/>
drags them down to 1 bar of HP; and be back in another fight in 7-10<br/>
mins.  For a corresponding warrior, it would be 13-18 mins, or more.<br/>
<br/>
Lay On Hands is the Panic Button; you can push it to get out of jail,<br/>
or at least, have more time to either finish off the mob or run for<br/>
safety. <br/>
<br/>
As for the spells being 9 levels behind, so?  Paladins are<br/>
fighter/healers, while Clerics are healer/fighters.  Clerics can be<br/>
mini-tanks up until about 9th or 10th; but Paladins can tank all the<br/>
way to 50.  The ability to tank and still have a reserve to compliment<br/>
the party&#39;s cleric is useful.  Past 10th, Clerics are 80%+ casters for<br/>
all realistic intents and purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Paladins don&#39;t get Kick; but at 6th they get bash which I personally<br/>
like much better.  Kick won&#39;t interrupt casting, while Bash will.  I<br/>
stopped using Kick with my Troll Warrior when I got Bash (which let my<br/>
Slam start being much more effective)<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re fixated on Dual Wield (which I think you might be, since you<br/>
mentioned Rangers; and they&#39;re the only hybrid, that I recall, that<br/>
gets Dual Wield); that might explain why you like Warriors and Rangers<br/>
the most.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think the jury&#39;s still out on Dual Wield, and on melee in<br/>
general.  The further up you go, the more the offensive and debuff<br/>
spellcasters really carry the fight to the mobs; the tanks are just<br/>
there to do what their name says.  If this is proven out, then Dueal<br/>
Wield or no, the tanks are just there to soak damage.  If this is not<br/>
proven, then Dual Wield still has to debate against the endless fighter<br/>
arguements of Dual Wield vs 2H Weapons (which is one of those semantic<br/>
arguements, IMO; stats bear each out)<br/>
<br/>
For grouping, I&#39;d prefer to have pure tank in the tank slot, any day of<br/>
the week; with a Paladin fighting alongside him.  (my ideal 6man group<br/>
is 2 Warriors, 1 Paladin, 1 Cleric, 1 Wizard, 1 Bard; haven&#39;t assembled<br/>
it yet, but it sounds fun!) For soloing, however, the Paladin is more<br/>
efficient than the Warrior.<br/>
