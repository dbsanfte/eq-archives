<div id="ygrps-yiv-873938769">I agree with you there. I have an amazing hunting ground, two of them<br/>
actually but now one is totally camped out so i may as well tell the rest of<br/>
you where my first one was. Actually this is no BIG secret but still it isnt<br/>
easy to get to. In lake rathe there are tons of camping spots that are<br/>
usually open for the taking because its hard to navigate in this zone. My<br/>
favorite spot is the large staircase where 3 aviak guards spawn. They spawn<br/>
every 2-3 minutes so if you want to do this make sure you are with at least<br/>
two other level 21ish people. No you say why is this good looting? well on<br/>
average the aviaks drop anywhere from 6 gold to 1 or 2 plat cash, plus words<br/>
and pages, plus bronze weapons and even some armor. This can really add up<br/>
big time when 3 aviaks spawn 3 minutes apart. so lets say you get the<br/>
average 6 gold every loot. no more no less. no weapons or items either. Go<br/>
there for one hour, in a group of 3 you will loot 20 times about. Thats 12<br/>
plat in an hour, not bad considering they usually have stuff along with<br/>
cash.<br/>
<br/>
There, now you know my OLD hunting spot. its still good and i still go there<br/>
from time to time. Just not as frequently as i used to.<br/>

&gt; Actually it wasn&#39;t bragging I told you that it wasn&#39;t hard to get money<br/>
&gt; for a BloodClaw after level 20 and I play on E&#39;ci so I&#39;m not even on your<br/>
&gt; server. You asked me where my hunting ground was so I wasn&#39;t bragging. The<br/>
&gt; reason for not telling you is because once people learn of this it will be<br/>
&gt; pointless and too crowded to even attempt to hunt there. Bottom line is<br/>
&gt; explore and you&#39;ll find good hunting grounds.<br/>
