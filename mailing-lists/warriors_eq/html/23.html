<div id="ygrps-yiv-157909805">Just signed up on the list, thought I&#39;d take a minute to introduce myself :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Salr D&#39;Taynkk, Dark Warrior of The Kith, Veeshan.  I&#39;m 24th, will be 25th tonight (reposte woohoo), Dark Elf warrior.  I&#39;ve been playing since phase 2 and concider myself to be one of the better warriors of the land, not due to my level or my equipment, but because I&#39;ve been playing for a while and know the role of a warrior in a party.  I protect my healer with my life, and will sacrifice myself to ensure the remainder of my party has a few moments to escape....when necessary.  <br/>
<br/>
As for weapons, my BBC is my primary weapon, but I also keep my 1h slashing/dual wield skills up by using dual Barbed Leather Whips.  I also use archery, mainly for fetching monsters, but also use it when I get to hurt to tank, I&#39;ll just back up and fire off arrows until I either get healed or the critter is dead.  Archery is a very underrated skill, I&#39;ve finally got my skill up to mid 80s and with the bow I have I can hit for up to 12 damage, nothing major, but when you are hurt you can still dish out a little damage.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the rest of my equipment, I have a Blackend Iron Crown, Grotesque mask, Spiked Collar, Rusty Spiked Pads, Barbed Arms, Blackend Bracers, Blackend Gloves, Dwarven Tunic, Black Iron Girdle, Blackend legplates, Blackend Boots, 2 ony earrings, 2 bands of flesh.  Just a couple pieces short of a full set of blackend, can&#39;t wait, should have those by the end of the weekend :)<br/>
