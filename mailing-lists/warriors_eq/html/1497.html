<div id="ygrps-yiv-801966130"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;More HPs - Lets us take more damage&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;A pointless improvement, IMHO.  If I&#39;m solo I already have to spend a very<br/>
&gt;&gt;long time sitting and waiting for my health to come back.  Last thing I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>need<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;is to have to wait LONGER.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Would you rather wait LONGER for more HPs to regen or would you prefer<br/>
&gt;death?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well gee, if I had the choose so blindly of course I would take the wait <br/>
time.  However, your question doesn&#39;t really address what I&#39;m talking about.  <br/>
More often than not, the reason a monster would beat me down is NOT because I <br/>
didn&#39;t have enough hit points to stand up to it, but because I miss my attack <br/>
over and over.  Having extra HP only means I get to hang out a little longer <br/>
while the creature that&#39;s too tough for me to beat makes my demise that much <br/>
more painful.  This directly relates to 2 of the 3 warrior improvements ideas <br/>
I came up with that I think would be much more useful:<br/>
<br/>
1: Increased chance of hitting with an attack (increased over the hybrids <br/>
anyway).<br/>
2: Remove or change Berzerker Frenzy.  It is not a help, it&#39;s a hinderance.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll reiterate my other one, even though it doesn&#39;t relate to the above.<br/>
<br/>
3: Make Kick and Bash/Slam non-mutaually exclusive.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If you are wounded to a point where you are waiting longer, you would have<br/>
&gt;been dead without those extra HPs.  Extra HPs also allow you to fight longer<br/>
&gt;before having to run.  I don&#39;t see how anyone could think this is a<br/>
&gt;pointless improvement.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like I said, with Berzerker Frenzy working the way it does, running is rarely <br/>
an option.  Then again, you might know that had to actually played a warrior <br/>
for a decent amount of time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If every warrior got 1000 HPs per level, would it still be pointless?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If we over-exaggerated every question like that, would this debate be <br/>
pointless?</div>
