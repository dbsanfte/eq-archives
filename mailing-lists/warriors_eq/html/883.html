&gt; should I use, I am thinking of buying two combine<br/>
&gt; LS&#39;s, to replace my Dwarven 2H axe.  Should I? <br/>
&gt; Also, could two Tentacle whips be better than two<br/>
&gt; combine LS&#39;s?  Well, Can anyone tell me what 1H<br/>
&gt; slashing weapons I should get, I have about 400p<br/>
&gt; now. )<br/>
