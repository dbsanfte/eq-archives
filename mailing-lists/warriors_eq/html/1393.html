<br/>
I have not done this with a warrior, but I see no reason why it could not be<br/>
done.  If you can get some sort of weapon that does magic damage you can<br/>
start taking out wisps around level 8 if you have a partner.  I fight these<br/>
in the commonlands.  If you can&#39;t afford a weapon that does magic damage,<br/>
find a magician and pay him to conjure up a dagger for you.  I took my necro<br/>
and a friends mage at level 8 and we have been killing wisps as our primary<br/>
staple.  They usually drop at least a gold, they also drop lightstones(8<br/>
gold) and greater lightstones(3.6).  As level 8 characters we pulled at<br/>
least 40 plat in five ours of play.<br/>
<br/>
Level 12-?, grouped<br/>
In Southern Ro there are a few Derv camps.  There&#39;s also some in North Ro<br/>
and West commonlands.  Dervs range from about level 9 to 14, so you will<br/>
want to be grouped.  They drop some change around maybe a gold or so.  They<br/>
also drop rings pretty often which can be sold for about two gold a piece.<br/>
75% when they have weapons they are bronze weapons which sell for 2-4 plat<br/>
each.<br/>
<br/>
Level 12 solo<br/>
There are some Lizardman warriors and mystics which spawn outside of the<br/>
Temple of Cazic Thule.  The carry some loose change.  Their tails sell for 4<br/>
gold, I believe.  They also drop bronze weapons and mystic dolls.<br/>
