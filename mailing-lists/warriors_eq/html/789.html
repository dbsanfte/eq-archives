<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067704102">Actually I noticed that killing a certain creature in butcherblock raised<br/>
faction with one of the wood elf guilds but didn&#39;t effect my Indigo<br/>
Brotherhood faction at all.  I really should have written it down because<br/>
now I cannot recall.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else knows what it might be please post it to the list.  I would<br/>
like to be able to adventure with a wood elf friend of mine, but I have yet<br/>
to make the trip to the island because soloing will be virtually impossible.<br/>
<br/>
Also, does anyone know what I can do with the ogre head of Zarchoomi or<br/>
Corfunk from Butcherblock.  I killed them both last night and tried giving<br/>
one of the heads to a dwarf in Kaladim that was looking for the head of a<br/>
Mudtoe ogre.  No luck.<br/>

&gt;Being an Agnostic DE warrior (I also tested it as the warlord), here is my<br/>
&gt;KOS list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Freeport - Neutral, come and go as I please (no buying/selling).<br/>
&gt;&gt; Dwarf city - (KOS)<br/>
&gt;&gt; Wood elf tree houses - WHY would you even WANT to go here :) (KOS)<br/>
&gt;&gt; High elf city - KOS<br/>
&gt;&gt; Gnome city - Neutral, come and go as i please (no buying/selling).<br/>
&gt;&gt; High Hold - Neutral, come and go as i please (I can buy/sell).<br/>
&gt;&gt; eurodite city - Neutral, come and go as i please (I can buy/sell).<br/>
&gt;      Qeynos - Neutral, come and go as i please (One vendor to buy/sell).<br/>
&gt;      Halas - KOS<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The ONLY way to raise Indigo brotherhood faction is to kill elves.  The<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;realistic targets (since Wood Elf guards are very high level) are the elves<br/>
&gt;on the Island of Erollsi.  If you raise Indigo you lower Wood/High elf and<br/>
&gt;vice a versa.  These two sides are mutually exclusive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Dungeons:<br/>
&gt;&gt; Najena - easy enough, kinda tough for you &quot;good&quot; people to get to because<br/>
&gt;&gt; you got to run thru Nektulos with wondering guards everywhere.....and to<br/>
&gt;&gt; my knowledge there is no way to raise your faction standing with DEs<br/>
 </span></blockquote>other<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; than to ruin your faction standing with halflings.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Solsek Eye - easy enough for darks, same story as najena for you &#39;good&#39;<br/>
&gt;&gt; types<br/>
&gt;&gt; Befallen - nutral teritory<br/>
&gt;&gt; Runnyeye - depending on which direction you are coming from.....you might<br/>
&gt;&gt; have to stop in HH and kill some orcs, then run the long way thru HH into<br/>
&gt;&gt; the karanas, back into beholders maze, then whala, or do like me and just<br/>
&gt;&gt; run thru munchkin town<br/>
&gt;&gt; Guk - in troll land, pretty easy to get to for &quot;good&quot; people but nowhere<br/>
&gt;&gt; close for non casters to be bound, and nowhere close for &quot;good&quot; people to<br/>
&gt;&gt; sell, very easy for us evil types with Troll town just around the<br/>
&gt;&gt; corner....again, no way for &quot;good&quot; people to raise their faction with<br/>
&gt;&gt; Trolls<br/>
&gt;&gt; Cazic Thule - same as Guk, good types have nowhere to bind and nowhere to<br/>
&gt;&gt; sell, evil has it easy....not to mention the entrance of Cazic is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>patroled<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; by an ogre guard.....again, no way for &quot;good&quot; people to raise their<br/>
&gt;&gt; faction with Ogres<br/>
&gt;&gt; Crushbone - well, we dark elves have a pact with the Crushbone orcs, so<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; take a faction hit with the dark elf warrior guild for hunting<br/>
&gt;&gt; there....but only 2 magic items worth getting from there anyways, not to<br/>
&gt;&gt; mention its way crouded and a long ways away from any &quot;evil&quot; starting<br/>
&gt;&gt; town, so by the time you get there you are probably to high lvl to fight<br/>
&gt;&gt; there....see foot note<br/>
&gt;&gt; Mistmoore - nutral ground, a little tricky for us darks to get to, but<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; too bad, and we can be bound anywhere in greater feydark.....see foot<br/>
 </span></blockquote>note<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Unrest - nutral ground, a little tricky for us darks to get to....see<br/>
 </span></blockquote>foot<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; note<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; footnote:  even tho we can be bound in close proxcimity to Crushbone,<br/>
&gt;&gt; Mistmoore, and Unrest, there is nowhere on that entire island for us to<br/>
&gt;&gt; sell or bank......however, by the time you are ready to fight in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>mistmoore<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; you are probably going to have a high lvl wiz, who can group gate you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>back<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; to nektulos for banking/selling needs, or since there are sooooo many<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;good&quot; people compared to &quot;evil&quot; people, you are probably going to have a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;good&quot; person in your group who can go to town and sell for you.  And<br/>
&gt;&gt; again, there is no real reason for us to need to fight in Crushbone or<br/>
&gt;&gt; Unrest (ogres and trolls can&#39;t wear the small bronze, and us small dark<br/>
&gt;&gt; elves don&#39;t have the raw strenght to wear bronze due to its weight)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Also, everybody seems to forget the one big advantage of being<br/>
 </span></blockquote>evil.....we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; can kill any NPCs we want with out having to worry about faction hits,<br/>
&gt;&gt; except either in HH or Rivervale (easiest connections to the Western part<br/>
&gt;&gt; of the world.  You good types can only kill Nektulos guards (all troll<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; ogre guards are 50+)  And some NPCs have some pretty good loot.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; So to sum up.....evil isn&#39;t any harder to play than good, but it does<br/>
&gt;&gt; force you to know more about the way the world works.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Which may explain why they all kill you on sight. You dark elves should<br/>
&gt;&gt; crawn back in the scrawny dark holes you crawled out of before you taste<br/>
&gt;&gt; another human blade.<br/>

&gt;&gt; OOC: Actually if it weren&#39;t so damned hard to play DE maybe it would be a<br/>
&gt;&gt; nicer race. Seems to me that Barbs, Ogres, and Trolls got a tremendous<br/>
&gt;&gt; warrior advantage in this game.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; ya know why?  because humans, stat-wise, pretty much suck.  ie, and DE<br/>
&gt;&gt; has base int of 99, human has 100 as max......DE warriors are almost as<br/>
&gt;&gt; smart as human casters, haha, and I always remind them of this when I see<br/>
&gt;&gt; them :)  (assuming its day time and they are not more than 5 steps away<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; they can see me).  And thats just an example of their pathetic<br/>
&gt;&gt; inteligence, the rest of their stats are equally unimpressive.<br/>
