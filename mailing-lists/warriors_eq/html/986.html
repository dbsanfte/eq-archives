I can pretty much confirm this new code ... ill give you my example.<br/>
<br/>
About 3 weeks ago or so i went to guk and got the chitin shell sheild, the<br/>
giant heart spider took no time at all to spawn...just last week i had gone<br/>
to guk with a friend in my guild who also wanted a chitin shell sheild. We<br/>
waited and waited and killed spider after spider, but no giant heart spider<br/>
had spawned...i finally thought to myself that maybe it was because i had<br/>
the chitin shell sheild already equipped so after we killed the spawn i ran<br/>
off to a different room to heal up. Well when the next spider spawned it WAS<br/>
the Giant heart spider and we then got the sheild. So i say that the code<br/>
could be working in two ways.<br/>
<br/>
1. No one can hang around the spot that the MOB spawns.<br/>
2. No one that has the item that the MOB drops can hang around where the MOB<br/>
spawns.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps you figure it out.<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I have it on good authoriry that anti-camping code was implemented in the<br/>
&gt; last patch and I need some help to confirm it.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; There is a detection zone around spawn points which EQ checks before<br/>
&gt; spawning a creature.  If the area is camped the spawn will be delayed, so<br/>
&gt; a creature will spawn...just not as often.  If the special item the NPC<br/>
&gt; carries is present in the zone then the NPC will not spawn with it.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I have been trying to get a shiny brass shield for the last 2 weeks or so.<br/>
&gt; The trainer never seems to have...I have heard this as well from people<br/>
&gt; who are camping the spot to twink guild mates.  Oddly enough there is<br/>
&gt; almost always a shiny shield within striking distance of the trainers<br/>
&gt; spawn point.  I have heard others on this list mention that they could not<br/>
&gt; get a BBC no matter how long they waited....I am wondering if they had<br/>
&gt; another BBC in the group they were camping with?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; This code is a good start for reducing camping.  Because it was done<br/>
&gt; quietly there is not a big &quot;Hoopla&quot; of campers complaining, they are<br/>
&gt; simply not seeing anything spawn.  This could also explain the rumors that<br/>
&gt; the Tommy no longer spawns.  because almost always the campers there have<br/>
&gt; 3+ tommys in the group.  It is going to be a long time before word gets<br/>
&gt; around though so you aren&#39;t going to see some of the popularly camped<br/>
&gt; items for awhile.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Anyone who can offer information confirming or denying this rumor won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; rewarded.  But I am sure they will earn the admiration and gratitude of<br/>
&gt; the rest of the people on this list.....well maybe just the gratitude at<br/>
&gt; least.<br/>
