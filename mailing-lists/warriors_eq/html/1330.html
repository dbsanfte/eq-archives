<div id="ygrps-yiv-59294966">I have seen the Pirahna in RV lake and can kill them easily (at level 13<br/>
blues) one at a time but I have seen swarms of them 3 and 4 at a time. And I<br/>
have seen dead bodies on the bottom of the lake of players who I knew were<br/>
higher than me.  I have yet to see the named one...<br/>
<br/>
Also, was told that this ruby is not a gem stone ruby but one only useful<br/>
for the RV quest.  <br/>

		Hrm,<br/>
<br/>
		Thats odd. Crappy too. I feel like emailing the guys over at<br/>
EQ&#39;lizer and<br/>
		asking them where the heck they got the ruby from in<br/>
innothule swamp.<br/>
<br/>
		The only mob that i have heard of that drops a ruby is the<br/>
fish called<br/>
		Chomper or something of the like in the rivervale lake.<br/>
Someone posted that<br/>
		a few weeks ago on this list. Im not sure how hard of a mob<br/>
he is but i can<br/>
		imagine killing a fish isnt too too easy. Especially one<br/>
that drops rubies.<br/>
<br/>
		Anyway if someone finds out what drops this ruby in<br/>
Innothule be sure to let<br/>
		me know.<br/>
<br/>
		Thanks<br/>
<br/>
