<b>Subject:</b> Armor AC and Absorbtion test conducted... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605255428">In my experience the only real effect on damage absorbtion is AC.<br/>
I did some experimenting on the same character.  I got my AC to 384 without<br/>
buffs using a mix of bronze plate and banded, and agility bonus.  On average<br/>
hits I took were less than 10 points, about 1 in 5 hits would be up near the<br/>
max of what the creature could do.  50 for darkbones, 40 for ghouls and so<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
I then switch to my magical armor which includes alot of leather items and<br/>
ringmail that give stat bonuses.  I then got myself buffed by a druid and<br/>
managed an AC of 383.  There was no significant difference in the amount of<br/>
damage I took.  An average hit does minimal damage....and 1 out of 5 hits<br/>
does heavy damage.<br/>
<br/>
Once I was in plate and banded and one I was in Leather and Ringmail.  With<br/>
the same AC there is no appriecable difference in damage absorbtion.<br/>
<br/>
This won&#39;t finish this arguement but at least it adds some fact to it.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Point being 4 people said that armor type does make a difference in damage<br/>
&gt;received, one person said it doesn&#39;t and that he has direct confirmation<br/>
&gt;from Verant that it doesn&#39;t.  I don&#39;t know about you but very rarely will<br/>
&gt;Verant give out this kind of information, if at all.  And someone saying<br/>
&gt;&#39;because Verant said so&#39; without saying where he heard that is like someone<br/>
&gt;telling you &#39;My friend is a GM and he is going to ban you&#39;.   No, most of<br/>
&gt;the time if a player tells what he has found in his experience within the<br/>
&gt;game I will tend to listen to them more.  Its when they start saying &#39;I<br/>
&gt;heard from Verant&#39; or &#39;Brad is my brother and he said&#39; is when I usually<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t even listen to their argument at all.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;I have direct confirmation from Verant that armor type is the Damage<br/>
&gt;&gt; Absorption constant.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; Point:  Anyone can state this.  Now give us facts.  What everyone has<br/>
&gt;&gt; said<br/>
&gt;&gt;  for this thread is only conjecture.  And the one thing I have found<br/>
&gt;&gt; constant<br/>
&gt;&gt;  in EQ is that conjecture = assume (and you know the saying about<br/>
 </span></blockquote>assume).<br/>

&gt;&gt; If you can&#39;t accept what a poster is calling a fact based on your<br/>
&gt;&gt; assessment<br/>
&gt;&gt; of the poster than you&#39;re wasting everyone&#39;s time by filling a post<br/>

&gt;&gt; him for more.  Also note that the &quot;because Verant said so&quot; point wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; his<br/>
&gt;&gt; only argument.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; As far as the invisible, theoretical damage modifiers go, I&#39;m curious as<br/>
&gt;&gt; to<br/>
&gt;&gt; why so few people are defending their existance so vehemently.  I&#39;m also<br/>
&gt;&gt; curious as to what &quot;facts&quot; could possibly be brought to bear to prove or<br/>
&gt;&gt; disprove its existance other than the conjecture of very<br/>
&gt;&gt; experienced/methodical/intelligent players and the gospel of Verant.<br/>
