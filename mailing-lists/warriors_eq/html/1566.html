<div id="ygrps-yiv-111558039">That is EQ economics.  The only way items are consumed is if someone quits the game without selling off their goods or giving them away.<br/>
<br/>
As a server ages the supply of powerful items increases at a faster rate than the population.  The rules of supply and demand dictate that the prices must come down.<br/>

    Yeah, on mithaniel Marr Server, any more than 200p is considered a rip.  But other servers have their prices.  I can&#39;t say I am too happy about the prices dropping so much either.</div>
