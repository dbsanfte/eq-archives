<b>Subject:</b> Wisps <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193470135">Hello all...I play a Barbarian Warrior on the Xenogy server.  I have a question about the wisps at Erud&#39;s crossing.  Can a level 13 warrior and a level 15 shaman take them alone?  I have hunted with a party for zombie sailors at the sunken ship, but heard everyone say to avoid the wisps.  Any feedback would be appreciated.  Thanks <br/>
