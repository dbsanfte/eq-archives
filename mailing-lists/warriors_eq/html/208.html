<b>Subject:</b> Question about dual wield <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-625154120">Hail, I am an 11th level barbarian that has used a two handed sword since<br/>
approx. level 4.  Should I switch now to a one handed sword and gain one<br/>
handed slash skill so that I can dual wield at 15?  Or should I stick with<br/>
my two handed sword and put all my training into dual attack when I reach<br/>
15?  Thanks for any advice,<br/>
<br/>
