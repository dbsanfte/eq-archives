<div id="ygrps-yiv-238672752">As a side note.  If one of your group is engaged on combat by and<br/>
mob...named or not....then once your party member is dead the mob will come<br/>
after the next closest party member and so on till all are dead or zoned, or<br/>
you kill the mob.<br/>
<br/>
When a giant attacks a party member...first thing I do is DISBAND! Same goes<br/>
for anything that can wipe out the whole party.  We disband and then regroup<br/>
when the danger is passed. Then the whole party doesn&#39;t have to run to zone<br/>
to regroup which can save considerable time.<br/>
<br/>
This can upset some people so it is best to make sure everyone understands<br/>
before it happens.  To many people die becuase giants can destroy a party<br/>
before anyone realizes the trouble.  90+  damage per hit makes short work of<br/>
most players especially after being stunned.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hail Norrath!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This weekend has been probably the worst as<br/>
&gt; far as death is concerned, but it was the most<br/>
&gt; hilarious.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Friday Eve:<br/>
&gt; My party, which consists of a Wizard, Enchantress,<br/>
&gt; and myself, a warrior, were headed for the Beholder<br/>
&gt; Maze to fight minotaurs and muddite elders. On the<br/>
&gt; way through East Karana, we came across a bandit<br/>
&gt; camp with a named NPC.  Besides the one with the<br/>
&gt; name there were 6 others, two conning blue and the<br/>
&gt; rest green.  The enchantress charms one of the<br/>
&gt; bandits and the rest come after us, except for the<br/>
&gt; named NPC.  We finish off the bandits rather quickly<br/>
&gt; then attack the last one (I will give out the name to<br/>
&gt; those who ask).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well after a very short fight we remove his items and<br/>
&gt; find a staff segment and a key, both lore items.  Great,<br/>
&gt; they must be part of a quest!  After healing a little<br/>
&gt; and regenerating mana, we decided to kill him again so<br/>
&gt; that each of us can have a key and staff segment.  We<br/>
&gt; recover two bronze weapons in the process and go off<br/>
&gt; on our merry way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Saturday Eve:<br/>
&gt; We found out what to do with the key, but not until one<br/>
&gt; of our party membes gives it to the wrong person.  No<br/>
&gt; problem, we&#39;ll just go get another one.  So back to the<br/>
&gt; bandit camp.  Besides two bandits there is a brigand<br/>
&gt; (never seen one there before) and the named NPC. Our<br/>
&gt; enchantress charms one of the spell casting bandits and<br/>
&gt; guess what?  All of them come, and we dispatch them<br/>
&gt; without a problem leaving only the named NPC.  Our<br/>
&gt; enchantress says &#39;Now (the named NPC)&#39;.  I take out my<br/>
&gt; trusty bow and whack!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; a (named NPC) says hit for 9 non melee damage.<br/>
&gt; A (named NPC) begins to cast a spell<br/>
&gt; Your body convulsves as lightning arcs through your body.<br/>
&gt; A (named NPC) begins to cast a spell<br/>
&gt; Your skin combusts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By this time he has come into melee range.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A (named NPC) hits you for 28 damage.<br/>
&gt; A (named NPC) hits you for 15 damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To see the least, he killed me and the Enchantress.  The<br/>
&gt; wizard was able to escape to the zone.  One of the named<br/>
&gt; NPC spells took away 2 bubbles of my health, which is<br/>
&gt; almost 200 hit points.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After we regroup, we find out that our Wizard had expended<br/>
&gt; all his mana on the previous fight and wasn&#39;t able to tell us<br/>
&gt; before I engaged with the named NPC.  Thus, we both died.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now we go back for our revenge.  We initiate combat with the<br/>
&gt; bandits, but this time the named NPC decides to join in!  (he<br/>
&gt; never has done this before).  Well this time the wizard and<br/>
&gt; myself die while the enchantress escapes.  I get the message<br/>
&gt; &#39;Welcome to Level 15!&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have we learned our lesson yet?  Not yet!  We go back for the<br/>
&gt; third time.  There is only the named NPC and two bandits.<br/>
&gt; Shouldn&#39;t be a problem.  This time our Enchantress charms<br/>
&gt; the named NPC and we quickly dispatch the remaining bandits.<br/>
&gt; Think we got our revenge?  We did, until a griffawn comes<br/>
&gt; up behind the enchantress and attacks.  Well the named NPC<br/>
&gt; is still charmed so he starts hitting the griffawn along with<br/>
&gt; myself.  About half way through the battle the charm wears off.<br/>
&gt; One second the enchantress has a full bar of health, the next<br/>
&gt; second she is lying on the ground dead.  The wizards health<br/>
&gt; goes from full to half before another spell casting bandit spawns.<br/>
&gt; I watch in horrow as my hit points dwindle away to half while still<br/>
&gt; fighting the griffawn.  About this time the wizard is trying to gate<br/>
&gt; while being hit hard by both the named NPC and the other bandit.<br/>
&gt; I watch his health go down to one bubble then turn and start<br/>
&gt;running,<br/>
&gt; the griffawn on my heels.  I make it to the gorge and turn to finish<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; the griffawn with two bubbles of health.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Whew that was close!  It was a good thing I didn&#39;t attack either<br/>
&gt;bandit.<br/>
&gt; Wrong!!  Doesn&#39;t matter if I attacked them or not, here they come<br/>
&gt;over<br/>
&gt; the hill.  Suffice to say I died yet again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have decided to give the bandits a WIDE berth anytime we are<br/>
&gt; traveling through East Karana.<br/>
