<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398797481">YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
That&#39;s what we need! A random item spawn.....I&#39;ll even take it one step<br/>
further:<br/>
Lets say that said sword is on a level 45 person...so we&#39;ll call that a<br/>
&#39;level 45 item&#39; it can then spawn to any level 45+ NPC in all of the zone,<br/>
or even norrath. That would make people have to travel A LOT to find items<br/>
they want, and would completely prevent camping for items altogether. That<br/>
way if you really wanted an item bad enough, your group had to go search for<br/>
it...not just sit sround and wait for it....that to me is not even<br/>
role-playing.<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>
