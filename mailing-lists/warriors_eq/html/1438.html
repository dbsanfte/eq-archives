&gt; <br/>
&gt; That isn&#39;t the point John Zwanenburg.  The inital post made by Wayne<br/>
&gt; started<br/>
&gt; out saying &quot;Warriors suck...&quot;  and continued to degrade the class from<br/>
&gt; there.  He happened to use a cleric to back up his points on why warriors<br/>
&gt; sucked.  I felt it was my duty to defend a class that I put hard work into<br/>
&gt; and, I might add, I play QUITE well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know that he was trashing the warrior class, i however am not trashing the<br/>
class at all<br/>
I have played a warrior, probably longer than you ( not that it matters) and<br/>
have found a class<br/>
that i prefer and was stating the differences between them. And yes i can<br/>
believe you when you <br/>
say that you play the class quite well because i for one felt i played it<br/>
very good as well.<br/>
<br/>
That all depends on the player once again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Comparing warriors to clerics is like<br/>
&gt; comparing apples to oranges, there is no comparison.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, if you cant compare two classes then what can you compare? There will<br/>
always be comparison.<br/>
And believe it or not probably the only few classes you COULD compare would<br/>
be<br/>
wars vs clerics<br/>
wars vs pallys<br/>
wars vs SKs<br/>
wars vs monks<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Oh yeah and John, you<br/>
&gt; DID say that you can take as well as a warrior....here is your exact<br/>
&gt; words. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My cleric can<br/>
&gt; &gt; take just as good as a warrior, my ac is damn high and my buffs add to<br/>
&gt; &gt; that.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; You might have meant &#39;tank&#39; and fat fingered, but in the context that you<br/>
&gt; presented there it does seem like you were saying your cleric can take<br/>
&gt; (damage) as good as a warrior.  Even if you said tank I still would<br/>
&gt; disagree<br/>
&gt; with you.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did happen to have a typo there, it happens sometimes. Its not feasible<br/>
for me to state i can take as much<br/>
damage as a warrior can take, but i can TANK as good as them. i can dodge,<br/>
(quite often surprisingly) and my ac<br/>
isnt anything to skoff at. My ac is the same as any warrior of my level.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And I don&#39;t think anyone is reading this list because they moved to<br/>
&gt; another<br/>
&gt; one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh well, their loss i guess.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Gee did we hit a nerve there or what? Last time i checked the amount of<br/>
&gt; &gt; people actually using this board was less than 5. And yeah i know its a<br/>
&gt; &gt; warriors discussion board but oh whats this? Even tho we are talking<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; clerics AND warriors, we are discussing something!!! Isnt that the<br/>
&gt; point?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh and Brian jones, i didnt say that I could take as much damage, i said<br/>
&gt; i<br/>
&gt; &gt; could tank just as well. My cleric isnt skimping out on HP but he isnt a<br/>
&gt; &gt; troll warrior. I ususally tank for my group. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh and Jynxx, Ive taken damage from level 30ish mobs with both my<br/>
&gt; warrior<br/>
&gt; &gt; and cleric and yeah i can last.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If your pissed, flame me back, i couldnt care less. If you dont want to<br/>
&gt; &gt; discuss this then fine. That doesnt bother me either, but this is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; discussion board and yes our topic right now does include warriors. Oh<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; one last time for the record. My cleric is far better than my warrior<br/>
&gt; ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; was.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; (BTW: My warrior is level 43 and my cleric is level 34)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok...clerics heal. Blah blah blah....who cares? This is a board for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; WARRIORS, not clerics. I am sorry if I am offending anyone by saying<br/>
&gt; &gt; this,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but please keep your cleric opinions to yourselves. If I wanted to<br/>
&gt; hear<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about the virtues of playing a cleric vs. playing a warrior I would<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; joined a cleric board. Last time I looked the list was called<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Warriors_eq&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and had nothing to do with Clerics. If you have fun playing a cleric<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there, be down...have all the fun you want. Just don&#39;t tell me that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; do anything because I am a warrior because even with all your heals<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t be half as vital in a group as I am. Without a warrior to<br/>
&gt; save<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; arse from getting hit by that 31st level mob you&#39;d be dead in 7<br/>
&gt; seconds<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; flat...well maybe 10 if you got a heal in there. Bottom line: Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; come<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my board telling me I suck, cause it&#39;s gonna tick me (and a lot of<br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; GOOD warriors) off really bad.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Umm...  whoever says this about clerics is stupid as hell<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At lvl 31 I group consistantly with a cleric.  This class is<br/>
&gt; amazing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you think all they do is heal, you are very very wrong.  Their dd&#39;s<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stun<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (amazing for rogues) and they can heal better than any other class.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; want<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to see your two druids heal you to full from 1 bar of life<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also if all you fight is yellows and reds you need to rethink your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; leveling<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; process.  Whites and blues are excellent to fight if you are in<br/>
&gt; groups<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; handle large numbers well.  Before you say all clerics do is heal,<br/>
&gt; &gt; play<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; one,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or play with a good one.<br/>
