<div id="ygrps-yiv-139523413">From everything I have seen, you need groups that know how to work as a<br/>
group, and with each other. Dragons used to take 3 groups working in waves,<br/>
but that seems to have gone up to at least 5 now. One person has to<br/>
coordinate the groups, make sure they are all doing what they should be<br/>
doing. Say 5 groups, A-E we will call them. Group A takes point and attacks.<br/>
Group B should be all buffed up and ready to step in. Group C needs to be<br/>
buffed with casters medding up. D and E are reserves at this point, tossing<br/>
out heals as needed. Rotate the groups to next position as a group gets beat<br/>
down. If everyone goes in at once, I highly doubt anyone will stand a chance<br/>
of surviving. Nagafen casts an area affect fear spell that will send<br/>
everyone running off into the dungeon, so be prepared to deal with that.<br/>
<br/>
PoF and PoH are completely different. PoF I have heard, stay near the edges<br/>
until you all get comfortable there. Once you go over a hill or two into the<br/>
meaty areas, it is very easy to get in over your head. Again, mulitple<br/>
groups working together is the key here. I would suggest an expedition<br/>
leader there, who calls targets and such. All it takes in one person who<br/>
decides on his own to pull something to ruin everyone&#39;s day. And in these<br/>
areas, it doesn&#39;t just mean the one death then corpse drag out, it will very<br/>
likely include multiple deaths getting your corpses.<br/>
<br/>
These areas were designed such that a single group doesn&#39;t stand much of a<br/>
chance there. Using ooc or shout is prolly the best way to communicate<br/>
(guildchat would be even better, if you can get that many people of the<br/>
appropiate level together from your guild).<br/>

&gt; Subject: Information plz.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone on this list have practical information concerning a way to do<br/>
&gt; Nagafen, PoH, PoF, and Vox?  We have been the first groups on Quellious to<br/>
&gt; break into PoH and PoF.  Unfortunately, both have been marginally<br/>
&gt; successful.  PoH isnt so difficult when you look at how ugly PoF is.<br/>
