<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541695398">Hey Gang,<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of things to ask right now. Last night i was in lake rathe<br/>
with my cleric hoping to score some bronze plate from some drybones. I was<br/>
in a duo with a level 17 Necromancer and it was going really sweet. During<br/>
the day time we would head over to the Aviak treehouse near Jonah Brucker<br/>
and slaughter birds and when night would approach wed go back to the Karana<br/>
Zone area and take out skels. OK so we started off in day time having a<br/>
blast killing aviaks every 1 minute cause they spawn so damn fast there and<br/>
were earning exp like no tomorrow. THen night comes along and we head over<br/>
to the undead area. We start off killing a few skeletons gaining some exp<br/>
but not too much and wait around for the first drybones to come.<br/>
<br/>
After about 5 minutes Voila there he is. I call him over with expulse undead<br/>
for 91 damage and then the necro sends in his pet to tank and i back off<br/>
hitting it 5 more times all for 91 damage while the necro is using his DoT<br/>
spells like heat blood heart flutter and clingin darkness. The thing was at<br/>
about 1/4 of health left when another skel spawns and starts attacking it<br/>
too. Now this didnt bother me at all at first. I gave it one more Expulse<br/>
undead giving the killing blow and what do i see? NO EXP and the corpse<br/>
dissapears. I rub my eyes and check again,...nope nothing. So i scroll back<br/>
up seeing if that other skeleton had perhaps got the killing blow which<br/>
would make sense. But no, i haad indeed got the blow in. Infact the Normal<br/>
skele had only hit the drybones once and it was for 16 damage. <br/>
<br/>
So why the heck did we not get to loot the corpse and get no exp?<br/>
<br/>
Ok next up. After killing a couple more drybones and actually getting some<br/>
bronze day time came again and we headed back to our aviak killing grounds,.<br/>
When we arrived we saw two Rangers there and decided to let them have it. No<br/>
biggie we said we can go kill Jonah Brucker for kicks. (and water --- those<br/>
who know who Jonah is will know what im talking about ) so we get there and<br/>
sure enough Good ol Jonah is there waiting. He cons blue to me (level 17<br/>
cleric) and he is a monk. I know this because he uses strike. On average he<br/>
hits for about 20 damage max on me. My necro friend was afk for one second<br/>
while i was engaging Jonah, who i can normally kill with no problems. I<br/>
call him out and he runs up to me with a dagger in hand. Odd i think to<br/>
myself, must be a rare weapon or something. All of a sudden i see my heatlth<br/>
begin to plummet as Jonah is peircing me for 36 and always, ALWAYS getting<br/>
double attack in.<br/>
<br/>
I couldnt belive it, i could not even heal myself. When i died he latched<br/>
onto my necro friend who then suffered the same fate. Well we were bound on<br/>
the same spot that we died on so we memed our spells and then killed him. <br/>
<br/>
Why was a monk that conned blue to me kicking my ass with a rusty dagger?<br/>
Thats what his dagger was by the way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok next up. We decide Jonah sucks and decide to explore a little bit before<br/>
heading back over to the undead spawn spot. We pass near the barbarian<br/>
village and my friend gets to close. Three of them latch on to him and he<br/>
has to engage them. I come along to help and see that they all con blue to<br/>
me so we start fighting away and eventually win. No biggie, no factions go<br/>
up or down or anything. We rest and med up and explore some more. We come<br/>
across another inlet that has two human guards wearing plate with no<br/>
weapons. They con indifferent and blue to me but i keep my distance just to<br/>
be safe. All of a sudden one of the two guards comes runnning up to me and<br/>
startsto fight me, first attack i dodged so i say oh well no where to run to<br/>
so may as well kill the guard. Then it hits me.....The guard punches me<br/>
PUNCHES me twice (double attack) for 98 damage! HOLY #&$%! Run i yell to my<br/>
buddy and he casts invis on himself as i watch myself die.<br/>
<br/>
Someone explain this to me. Why is a guard that cons blue to a level 17<br/>
cleric hitting me for more than a sand giant would? Just curious.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well i shouldnt complain, i died twice last night in lake rathe but in 3<br/>
hours there i made 4 bubbles of exp (after dying even! ) I suggest you all<br/>
go there at around level 17 it rocks. Aside from the crap that goes on<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways let me know if anyone can explain this stuff to me<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
