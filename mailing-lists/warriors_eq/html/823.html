<br/>
Got to agree with a previous poster about the huge amounts of mail that come<br/>
in on this list, it gets a bit much.  And the digest mode is just about<br/>
useless, as everyone who RE:&#39;s keeps including the full text from the<br/>
previous poster, resulting in literally 100&#39;s of lines of text per email.<br/>
Is it really necessary to include the full body of the 10 previous responses<br/>
to a post in an post that doesn&#39;t even address the subject anymore?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the criticism, I do get a lot out of this list and hope to be able<br/>
to contribute to it as I level up.<br/>
<br/>
BTW I have a Bard friend who has his Alcohol Tolerance up to 50ish.  He can<br/>
no longer get drunk :(  and to make things worse as AT goes up you not only<br/>
stop getting stupid, but you loose the buff as well.  So all effects of<br/>
Alcohol are mitigated.<br/>
