    All I really know about making things such as that are that you need:<br/>
    A forge<br/>
    Flasks of Water<br/>
    Sheets Of Metal (or metal bits, depending on size of item)<br/>
    And the mold for the item.<br/>
    As far as I was able to discern, you can&#39;t make weapons just yet....only mundane items and armor, making the smithing skill pretty worthless. <br/>
    Just my 2 cents ;-}~<br/>
