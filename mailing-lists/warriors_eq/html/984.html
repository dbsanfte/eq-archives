<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813200268">So I finally made it to my body in the desert of South Ro.  This time I got <br/>
a troll shaman to cast SoW on me before I left the oasis and was able to <br/>
easily get to my body.  Once there I saw the two Trolls who had tried to <br/>
help me when I was jumped by the dry bones skeleton the first time.  They <br/>
had been guarding my body, killing dervishes, and just having a good time <br/>
being trolls.<br/>
<br/>
Well I talked to the trolls for a bit (their common isn�t that good, one can <br/>
see their intelligence isn�t that high).  I learned then that all Trolls are <br/>
not that bad.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I finished getting dressed, cut a slice of bread to feed my hungry <br/>
stomach, drank some water and off I went.  I decided to run like the wind <br/>
back to the oasis and kill some crocodiles.<br/>
<br/>
Once in the oasis area, I realized I still had three full backpacks dragging <br/>
me down.  I have sold my stuff at the inn in Oasis before, so I decided to <br/>
risk it one more time.<br/>
<br/>
I climbed up the hill overlooking the inn and looked around for errant <br/>
giants.  Everything looked ok so in I ran to lighten my load.<br/>
<br/>
Well anyone reading this can guess the rest.  At least I sold all my extra <br/>
loot before a sand giant ripped the roof off the inn and slammed his fist <br/>
into my head.  I really need to get some giant repellant as soon as I can <br/>
find some.<br/>
<br/>
I have decided that I hate giants more than griffons, and one day I will <br/>
lead a hunt to destroy every giant in the world of Norrath!!<br/>

For the Honor and Glory of Rallos Zek;<br/>
