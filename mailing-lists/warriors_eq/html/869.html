<div id="ygrps-yiv-771017890">Good advice from the others so far. Here is how I sometimes deal with em.<br/>
<br/>
First ... in character or not, kill stealing is kill stealing. I hate it and most<br/>
other players do too. I happened to be in the snake pit in BB one night and there<br/>
were four people there. Three of us had been rotating kills for about 30 minutes<br/>
or so. The fourth one came in ... a female human paladin. She proceeded to take<br/>
all snakes she could, including jumping in on our fights and looting the corpses.<br/>
It was annoying to say the least. When questioned about it she replied, &quot;Sorry<br/>
... gotta make level.&quot; Okay, excuse me for being rude here but what the hell?<br/>
Like the rest of us DON&#39;T have to make level?<br/>
<br/>
The three originals ended up grouping and taking every single kill and loot for<br/>
about 45 minutes until she left. It was fun and we laughed at her the whole time<br/>
during group chat. Not to mention we made some good exp even though grouped, and<br/>
some moderate loot also.<br/>
<br/>
Moral of this story: When it&#39;s only one person annoying you ... form an anti-jerk<br/>
group with the sole purpose of driving them away. It works because your group<br/>
will always do more damage, thus getting the exp, AND the loot.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting,<br/>

&gt; particularly interesting problem.  Currently I am an 8th lvl warrior on<br/>
&gt; Cazic-Thule who adventures around the Freeport environs: Desert of Ro,<br/>
&gt; Commonlands, et al.  One day in the desert this nasty little dark elf<br/>
&gt; shadowknight has hanging around and this guy is a known kill-stealer and a<br/>
&gt; real jerk (anyone who frequents the desert *might* know who I&#39;m t/*alking<br/>
&gt; about).  He was hanging around our party making rude gestures at us and<br/>
&gt; calling us really nasty names.  Then he seemed to go away.  A little while<br/>
&gt; later I spotted him fighting a giant spider so I figured I&#39;d teach him a<br/>
&gt; little lesson.  I ran over and attacked it myself, and he starts telling me<br/>
&gt; to back off.  Of course it didn&#39;t matter much because he easily defeated it<br/>
&gt; quickly thereafter.  &quot;Oh well,&quot; I thought, &quot;His comeuppance shall be had<br/>
&gt; another day.&quot;  I then ran over to attack an orc.  Well this little pest<br/>
&gt; followed me over and killed off the orc I was fighting, then told me that was<br/>
&gt; my punishment for trying to steal his kill.  This got me really angry.  I<br/>
&gt; wanted to challenge him to a duel but he was one level higher than I and had<br/>
&gt; some really good armor to boot so I figured I would lose.  I took a<br/>
&gt; screenshot of him using foul language and sent a petition, but I was told by<br/>
&gt; a GM to just work it out myself.  Some verbal tennis was had between my party<br/>
&gt; and this dark elf, but other than shooting off a few tart zingers we were<br/>
&gt; pretty much up a creek with this guy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What is one to do in a situation like this?  Has anyone else ever come across<br/>
&gt; this kind of thing?  What did you do about it?<br/>
