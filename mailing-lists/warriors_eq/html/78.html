<div id="ygrps-yiv-699130626">Hmm I hear all this talk about platina....what is it and why dont I have <br/>
any?<br/>
<br/>
heh nah what I realy want to know is if anyone of you know of any decet cash <br/>
areas?<br/>
<br/>
I realised I was a power player, problem is I dont have any power.<br/>
Im a level 10 barbarian and atm northern Ro is where I spend my days.<br/>
Cash there aint that good. Once in a while a madman walks in with a bronze <br/>
wep and that is _realy_ good cash for me.<br/>
But that happens very rarely.<br/>
<br/>
I need cash to get myself a decent set of armor. Mobs are chewing me up and <br/>
spittin me out in pices.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can help me with this here problem.<br/>
