     What does everyone think about possibly giving Warriors a MINIMUM amount<br/>
of damage done? For example, Im level 16 wielding either a Dwarven 2Hand Axe<br/>
(best 2hander up until SBH you can get it off Lord Darish in Crushbone) or a<br/>
Combine LongSword and Tentacle Whip. Most of the time, I hit for 28, 29, 30<br/>
with the Dwarven 2Hander, but occasionally, I hit for somewhere in the range of<br/>
1-10. Personally I think that sucks. Now, what if Verant were to give Warriors<br/>
a minumum amount of damage they could do? For example, this Dwarven 2Hander is<br/>
14dmg 43delay. It would be nice if we could never hit for below 14 with this<br/>
item. Also, a Combine LS is 6dmg 28delay, so we could never hit for below 6<br/>
with the Combine LS.<br/>
<br/>
     I think this is a reasonable idea and in some cases would be better than<br/>
5-10 damage extra. Just think, NEVER hitting for 1 damage again. I personally<br/>
think in a realistic sense, a big Barbarian Warrior with 130STR wielding a huge<br/>
Dwarven 2Hander hitting something for 1 damage is kind of pitiful. What do you<br/>
all think?<br/>
