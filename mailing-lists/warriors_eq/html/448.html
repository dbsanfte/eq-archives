<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351955293">ya know why?  because humans, stat-wise, pretty much suck.  ie, and DE has base int of 99, human has 100 as max......DE warriors are almost as smart as human casters, haha, and I always remind them of this when I see them :)  (assuming its day time and they are not more than 5 steps away so they can see me).  And thats just an example of their pathetic inteligence, the rest of their stats are equally unimpressive.<br/>

&gt; HI.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if anyone know what class is the fastest to advance levels<br/>
&gt; in.<br/>
&gt; I know erudites for example get less xp then other races.<br/>
&gt; How about darkelves? they get more or less xp?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And also, does the god you worship affect xp?<br/>
&gt; I know it affects the overall diff, on the game but does it affect xp?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Would be logical that if you decide to worship the prince of hate, wich will<br/>
&gt; increase the game diff alot, you should get more xp, is this how it works?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know some of you dont want this info...so if anyone knows the answer,<br/>
&gt; tag the mail with spoiler hehe<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thanx<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Vashi<br/>
