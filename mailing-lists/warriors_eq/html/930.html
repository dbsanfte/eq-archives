<div id="ygrps-yiv-492804413">Yup a bad thing, but you can still find areas to work in.  I refuse to camp <br/>
for a lore item or whatever, but my friends and I will frequently camp <br/>
around a spawn area and Kill Kill Kill.<br/>
<br/>
You can find us loitering around the Drevs in West Commons, the second <br/>
pillar in Oasis, or the Orcs in HH.  You just have to work out a deal with <br/>
the groups already there.<br/>
<br/>
Most groups will share.  I find it also handy to give other groups a helping <br/>
hand (if they will let me).  Gives me practice using my 2H sword, and since <br/>
they are blasting away with magic there is no way I will get the experience. <br/>
  Then the next Orc pops up and my group destroys him and we get the <br/>
experience/loot.<br/>
<br/>
Groups that work together have fun and a chance to share the <br/>
experience/loot.  Groups that spend there time stealing others kills are <br/>
probably not happy in the long run and are better off ignored.<br/>
<br/>
Just my lowly opinion.<br/>
<br/>
For the Honor and Glory of Rallos Zek;<br/>
