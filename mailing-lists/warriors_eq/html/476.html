<b>Subject:</b> Dual Weild and weapons used - need advice <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739176072">Greeting,<br/>
<br/>
Finally made it to 15 *does a jig*.<br/>
<br/>
Advice needed.<br/>
<br/>
Have a Mino Axe and a bastard sword. both 8dmg and 32/35.<br/>
<br/>
Keep this combination of weapons?<br/>
If not, which should I switch?<br/>
Does it matter which is in my primary had?<br/>
<br/>
Trying to save most of my monies for some banded armor so maybe some<br/>
advice on what to get now and what to get later?<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that this dual wield takes a lot of stamina. Any magical item<br/>
to help that out? Or is it something I shouldn&#39;t worry about?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
*hugs*<br/>
