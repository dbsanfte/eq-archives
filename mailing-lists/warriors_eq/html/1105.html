<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302505849">I don&#39;t know if everyone knows about this but I&#39;ll post it just in case.<br/>
<br/>
Drosco in the Qeynos aquiducts has a +5 to char medal on him,and he is an <br/>
easy kill. Prob lev 8 or so. It is a lore item though, so you will not be <br/>
able to get more than one. It is better to enter the sewers in the pool near <br/>
the qeynos bank, that is closer to his spawn.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a nesting rat down there that has a gold necklace +3 to <br/>
charisma. I don&#39;t know what quest it is related to, but it is not a lore <br/>
item so you could prob get more than one (not sure), anyway the rat is a <br/>
very easy kill.  Prob lev 4-6.  If anyone knows what quest this is for send <br/>
me a post,  curious.....<br/>
<br/>
Just for everyones information.....<br/>
