<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419776828">I&#39;ve learned that named NPCs and guards do not follow the same rules as<br/>
players.  An example I shared with people a while ago is the NPC bandit<br/>
named Tallus.  Friday night we mopped the floor with him 3 times with no<br/>
problems.  We went back Saturday night and out of 6 tries, at least two of<br/>
my group of 3 died, and once all 3 of us got it.  Is there some kind of<br/>
logic that if you kill something often that the next time it comes back it<br/>
will be pissed?  Strange<br/>

&gt; Hey Gang,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just a couple of things to ask right now. Last night i was in lake rathe<br/>
&gt; with my cleric hoping to score some bronze plate from some drybones. I was<br/>
&gt; in a duo with a level 17 Necromancer and it was going really sweet. During<br/>
&gt; the day time we would head over to the Aviak treehouse near Jonah Brucker<br/>
&gt; and slaughter birds and when night would approach wed go back to the<br/>
&gt; Karana<br/>
&gt; Zone area and take out skels. OK so we started off in day time having a<br/>
&gt; blast killing aviaks every 1 minute cause they spawn so damn fast there<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; were earning exp like no tomorrow. THen night comes along and we head over<br/>
&gt; to the undead area. We start off killing a few skeletons gaining some exp<br/>
&gt; but not too much and wait around for the first drybones to come.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After about 5 minutes Voila there he is. I call him over with expulse<br/>
&gt; undead<br/>
&gt; for 91 damage and then the necro sends in his pet to tank and i back off<br/>
&gt; hitting it 5 more times all for 91 damage while the necro is using his DoT<br/>
&gt; spells like heat blood heart flutter and clingin darkness. The thing was<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; about 1/4 of health left when another skel spawns and starts attacking it<br/>
&gt; too. Now this didnt bother me at all at first. I gave it one more Expulse<br/>
&gt; undead giving the killing blow and what do i see? NO EXP and the corpse<br/>
&gt; dissapears. I rub my eyes and check again,...nope nothing. So i scroll<br/>
&gt; back<br/>
&gt; up seeing if that other skeleton had perhaps got the killing blow which<br/>
&gt; would make sense. But no, i haad indeed got the blow in. Infact the Normal<br/>
&gt; skele had only hit the drybones once and it was for 16 damage. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So why the heck did we not get to loot the corpse and get no exp?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok next up. After killing a couple more drybones and actually getting some<br/>
&gt; bronze day time came again and we headed back to our aviak killing<br/>
&gt; grounds,.<br/>
&gt; When we arrived we saw two Rangers there and decided to let them have it.<br/>
&gt; No<br/>
&gt; biggie we said we can go kill Jonah Brucker for kicks. (and water ---<br/>
&gt; those<br/>
&gt; who know who Jonah is will know what im talking about ) so we get there<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; sure enough Good ol Jonah is there waiting. He cons blue to me (level 17<br/>
&gt; cleric) and he is a monk. I know this because he uses strike. On average<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; hits for about 20 damage max on me. My necro friend was afk for one second<br/>
&gt; while i was engaging Jonah, who i can normally kill with no problems. I<br/>
&gt; call him out and he runs up to me with a dagger in hand. Odd i think to<br/>
&gt; myself, must be a rare weapon or something. All of a sudden i see my<br/>
&gt; heatlth<br/>
&gt; begin to plummet as Jonah is peircing me for 36 and always, ALWAYS getting<br/>
&gt; double attack in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I couldnt belive it, i could not even heal myself. When i died he latched<br/>
&gt; onto my necro friend who then suffered the same fate. Well we were bound<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; the same spot that we died on so we memed our spells and then killed him. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why was a monk that conned blue to me kicking my ass with a rusty dagger?<br/>
&gt; Thats what his dagger was by the way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok next up. We decide Jonah sucks and decide to explore a little bit<br/>
&gt; before<br/>
&gt; heading back over to the undead spawn spot. We pass near the barbarian<br/>
&gt; village and my friend gets to close. Three of them latch on to him and he<br/>
&gt; has to engage them. I come along to help and see that they all con blue to<br/>
&gt; me so we start fighting away and eventually win. No biggie, no factions go<br/>
&gt; up or down or anything. We rest and med up and explore some more. We come<br/>
&gt; across another inlet that has two human guards wearing plate with no<br/>
&gt; weapons. They con indifferent and blue to me but i keep my distance just<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; be safe. All of a sudden one of the two guards comes runnning up to me and<br/>
&gt; startsto fight me, first attack i dodged so i say oh well no where to run<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; so may as well kill the guard. Then it hits me.....The guard punches me<br/>
&gt; PUNCHES me twice (double attack) for 98 damage! HOLY #&$%! Run i yell to<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; buddy and he casts invis on himself as i watch myself die.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Someone explain this to me. Why is a guard that cons blue to a level 17<br/>
&gt; cleric hitting me for more than a sand giant would? Just curious.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh well i shouldnt complain, i died twice last night in lake rathe but in<br/>
&gt; 3<br/>
&gt; hours there i made 4 bubbles of exp (after dying even! ) I suggest you all<br/>
&gt; go there at around level 17 it rocks. Aside from the crap that goes on<br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyways let me know if anyone can explain this stuff to me<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
