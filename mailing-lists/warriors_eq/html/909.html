You got the right idea with your longswords, thats what i was using up<br/>
untill i could afford to buy myself a whip and a Tommy. But as far as the 2h<br/>
slashing goes im not that partial to the BBC..IMO its not all that good, the<br/>
minus really blows ... I just use a combine 2 hander right now, but i dont<br/>
even use it that much, i much rather the speed and damage i am gettting with<br/>
my 2 1h Slashing weapons. But thats just My opinion.<br/>

&gt; I have maxed out 1H Slashing and have 2H Slashing, Double Attack, and Dual<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wield all in the High 50s.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am using a combine longsword and a fine steel longsword for my dual<br/>
&gt; wield, <br/>
&gt; and a fine steel 2H sword to build up my 2H skill.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve tried mino axes and such, but I just don&#39;t like the delay/damage<br/>
&gt; ratio. <br/>
&gt;   2H Slashing is ok for the damage, and with double attack getting better<br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; get plenty of hits in during an attack - HOWEVER, nothing I have seen by<br/>
&gt; any <br/>
&gt; warrior deals death as plentiful as my two long swords with dual wield and<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; double attack.  It is wonderful to change camera view just to watch as the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; two swords fly.  Attack, Attack, Attack, Attack, Bash, Attack, Attack, <br/>
&gt; Attack, Attack, Attack, Attack, Bash!!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh well, will have to see how good I am with my 2H Sword once I max out<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; skill.  Like I said it works well now (24 to 25 a hit - with double attack<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; up to 50 per round), but I still think my two longswords rule.  Saving<br/>
&gt; cash <br/>
&gt; now to buy a second combine longsword.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One last thing; talking to a 21 level warrior last night, the BBC is to<br/>
&gt; him <br/>
&gt; the best weapon he has seen.  Of course it is a 2H weapon, so 2H Slashing<br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; important to keep up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is all my opinion as a level 15 Barbarian Warrior Princess.<br/>
