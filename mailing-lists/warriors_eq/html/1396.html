<div id="ygrps-yiv-511489896">Do you becove visable when you give the dwarf the belts?  I would love to get <br/>
my Dark Elf in there and do that.  Right now, all guards from the boat to the <br/>
front gates of Kaladim regard me warmly, and after that, it&#39;s KOS all the way <br/>
to the zone to Greater Faydark.  Is there another thing that needs killing to <br/>
make the dwarves around there like me?  I lost over 1 bubble and level 14 <br/>
because I thought that the dwarves liked me, then one just killed me.  No <br/>
chance to run far enough away, so I had to go back to Faydwer from the South <br/>
Gate of Freeport.  Got there, tried to use /corpse, but it was too far away, <br/>
got closer and the dwarf killed me again.  Back in Freeport.  Took the boat <br/>
again, got the first body back.  Got an invis, used /corpse command over and <br/>
over to drag it.  Accidentally right clicked corpse.  Became visable, killed <br/>
again.  One more time on the boat, and I finally got my stuff back.  So, if <br/>
there is any way that I can give the dwarf the belts without being by it, I <br/>
would really, really appreciate the info.</div>
