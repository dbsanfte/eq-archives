<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296428326">Any evil races out there who&#39;s successfully changed their faction with the human guards around Freeport? I&#39;ve been killing orcs left and right but guards and innkeeps still threatening to me. <br/>
<br/>
I was hopping to at least be to a point where I can walk in and hope on boat if I needed to. Of course I&#39;d probably have to deal with guards in other continents.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
