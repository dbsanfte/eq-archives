<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411368490">look guys Im learning.<br/>
Got a few compents to a few things.<br/>
Mostly just ranting and stupid compents about nothing realy.<br/>
And , bah I dont know.<br/>
<br/>
Billy Barnett:  Warriorguilds in faydwer<br/>
<br/>
You can kelethin. Just train through the window.<br/>
I think it is still possible, before you could bank through the<br/>
window too but they moved the banker witht the new patch I think, they might <br/>
have done the<br/>
same witht the warrior trainer<br/>
In Ak&#39;anon its easier but dangerous, I got stuck there once and had to kill <br/>
myself to<br/>
get out (no gm was on). just walk up to one of the robot guides and say <br/>
where warrior guild<br/>
<br/>
when you get there take a right and then its behind one of the doors.<br/>
But dont fall in the hole thats in the area.....its a pain to get up (read <br/>
impossible)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
David Rogers: running through runneyey<br/>
<br/>
I havent times it but I think more then 30 seconds through is slow.<br/>
Im probably gona go back to qey soon And I can time it then hehee<br/>
If you are going to qey you will go riverval,runnyeye,beholders maze, <br/>
karanas<br/>
beholders maze is easy too. If you take it easy. all I have encountered <br/>
there<br/>
are the easier for of minos and lesser mudites. The path from runny zone to <br/>
karana zone<br/>
isnt realy crowded. just keep the wall on the left side at all times and you <br/>
will get<br/>
to karanas pretty fast.<br/>
I read lots of posts saying that it can take several hours to travel from <br/>
free to qey.<br/>
Thats only if you run the water ways I think.<br/>
I always run the path(done the trip 10+ times and I have gotten killed <br/>
one(stupidity)).<br/>
If you do it once and you know the way its not that hard. then its &quot;only&quot; <br/>
the<br/>
griffs,giants,eyes and bandits that can psuh you around heheeh.<br/>
<br/>
good luck<br/>
<br/>
Dubas:   Bronze armor.<br/>
<br/>
There shouldnt be more bronze in the game IMHO.<br/>
Bronze wasnt made for level 13 players. Im 15 and Im 1 piece away from full <br/>
banded.<br/>
I guess there are server differances but 40pp for nice armor?  I think thats <br/>
a decent prize.<br/>
Personaly Im just gona get a bronze helmet for now so I dont have to go <br/>
around lookin like a fool.<br/>
<br/>
Some people will always take the easy route, when I strted playing the char <br/>
I play now I saw a level 7<br/>
warrior un full STEEL plate, no no stinkin bronze.....but how fun is it for <br/>
him the next 20 or so<br/>
levels when he cante upgrade anything and he wont get to earn anything <br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
but the problem remains...if someone would give me the best armor in the <br/>
game would I say no?<br/>
hehe hell no, Id take it and wear it all day.<br/>
<br/>
what do I want to say with this?  I have no idea.</div>
