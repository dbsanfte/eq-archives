<div id="ygrps-yiv-615069028">The best group I have eer been in was one consiting of<br/>
2tanks (2 true warriors)<br/>
2healers (cleric/druid)<br/>
2nukers (enchanter/wizard)<br/>
We were all level 24 to 26 playing in Cazic Thule.  A well balanced group<br/>
can take multiple reds/yellow/blues/greens.  The best thing about this kind<br/>
of group is the tanks can distribute tha damage very well between them<br/>
(providing they know what they are doing.)  And their is a cleric to help<br/>
tank as well.  The clerics would alternate acting as a 3rd tank while one<br/>
would just sit back heal/dd.  When he was out of mana, that cleric would<br/>
take the place of the first tanking and then he would take over as healer.<br/>
the mages.. Well they just blew things up efficiently.  Rarely did we (the<br/>
warriors) have to try to pull something off the nukers cause they burned to<br/>
fast.  Its a good feeling to get 3 levels in 2 days with this kind of group<br/>
WITHOUT powerleveling or being lame.  The bottom line was downtime was VERY<br/>
minimal and we could take very large groups of critters NON-stop.  As for<br/>
grouping with the Enchanters... You havent played a group until you group<br/>
with higher level enchanters.  Their debuff/charms are simply INCREDIBLE.<br/>
If I were to pull absolutely too many mobs, he would just charm one and turn<br/>
it from 10vs6 to 9vs7.  As well as slow up the attackers so they are acting<br/>
half as fast.  Less attacks equals less damage to tanks equals less mana<br/>
used by clerics equals more life for the tanks equals more damage they can<br/>
inflict equals less mana used by the mages.  Sorry for the run on sentance,<br/>
but you get the picture.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps you a bit.<br/>

&gt; In your experience what has been the best group make-up that you<br/>
&gt; have been a<br/>
&gt; part of?  If possible give a little input on why it was the best group<br/>
&gt; make-up.  I&#39;m concerned here with character classes, not level.<br/>
&gt; Interested<br/>
&gt; in group sizes anywhere between 2 and 6.  Of particular interest to me is<br/>
&gt; what it&#39;s like to group with an enchanter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve mostly played in very small groups.  I usually play with one other<br/>
&gt; person in my group.  A cleric was nice to group with in the<br/>
&gt; pre-teens since<br/>
&gt; he did comparable melee damage and could keep me healed up.  In<br/>
&gt; the teens I<br/>
&gt; began grouping with a magician.  He used a water elemental for a pet which<br/>
&gt; is supposed to be about the equivalent of an equal level troll warrior.  I<br/>
&gt; would let the elemental tank for me and I would stand at that perfect<br/>
&gt; distance where the mob attacks the elemental and not me, yet I could still<br/>
&gt; get my hits in.  Since the elemental regains HP at about 10<br/>
&gt; points per round<br/>
&gt; as opposed to my two it meant less down time.  At level 12 the<br/>
&gt; magician had<br/>
&gt; a DD spell that did 90+ damage, very nice when it was needed to finish<br/>
&gt; something off quick.  He could also summon bandages so I get healed up to<br/>
&gt; 50% for free.  As a two man team the magician was much better than the<br/>
&gt; cleric because we could dish out much more damage in less time,<br/>
&gt; and with the<br/>
&gt; pet taking much of the damage healing was not really necessary.<br/>
&gt; As an added<br/>
&gt; bonus the pet could play the part of sacrificial lamb while we zoned when<br/>
&gt; things got nasty.<br/>
