<div id="ygrps-yiv-475227849">The letter that I posted was not my writing, I read it from the EQ&#39;Lizer<br/>
site.  I am also trying to get into touch with the writter of the letter to<br/>
enlist his help.  I have only almost attained level 31.  But in the time I<br/>
have played, and having interaction with some other players (warriors and<br/>
monk) I am a firm believer in the warrior is/will be not worth having in a<br/>
group of high level players.  Sure, he will always be able to tank, but<br/>
other than that, he will have no participation in a group.  The proverbial<br/>
punching bag.  Every skill we have is shared with a hybrid group.  We get<br/>
nothing special at all.  I do not want to be a cry baby, but this just seems<br/>
unfair to me.  Something to make the warrior stand out as the class that you<br/>
need to have when in physical combat would be nice.  I mean isnt that the<br/>
true calling of a warrior?  Many of the ideas you have submitted to me so<br/>
far are really good.  And I will put together a complete list of everything<br/>
we come up with.  I will not send this to verant until we get enough to make<br/>
a good selection from.  Then when I send it to them, it will be &quot;this is<br/>
some of the options that we have come up with... what do you think&quot; type<br/>
attitude.  They should listen to us, they listen to everyone else.  Why<br/>
alienate one class when they are bending over backwards for others?<br/>

&gt; What Verant needs to do and I think trys to do is provide<br/>
&gt; distinction among<br/>
&gt; the classes without having any one class over-shadow all of the others.<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; Although my experience is minimal compared to your (my level 13 and your<br/>
&gt; level 43 (44?)), I would support your petition to ensure that the warrior<br/>
&gt; class is made to be distictive and the one true melee combat class.� If<br/>
&gt; Verant has erred somewhere by allowing all of the &quot;add-on&quot; things of the<br/>
&gt; hybrid classes to cause these classes to compete with or go<br/>
&gt; further than the<br/>
&gt; warriors in the higher levels, then they need to do something to fix it.<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d hate to spend all my time getting to where you are and end up feeling<br/>
&gt; like it was just not worth it.<br/>

&gt; I am not actually board with my character, just tired of waiting for the<br/>
&gt; goodies to come when they are actually no where to be found.� They will<br/>
&gt; never get to us, and we are outweighed even in a group setting by other<br/>
&gt; melee classes.<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; I am not so concerned about the magic using/healing/gating part<br/>
&gt; of this as I<br/>
&gt; am the fact that the masters of physical combat (warriors) are<br/>
&gt; anything but<br/>
&gt; that.� Healing never has been IMO a part of what a warrior can do.� But a<br/>
&gt; warrior is supposed to be the master or armed combat.� When we cap out at<br/>
&gt; skill level 200 and others can go beyond that as well as do more<br/>
&gt; damage than<br/>
&gt; us warrior, something is definitely wrong.� I think we should start a<br/>
&gt; pettition to verant to try to even things out a bit more.� The suggestions<br/>
&gt; in this post on EQ`Lizer for modifying the Warrior class are well thought<br/>
&gt; and not too much to ask.�<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; If anyone else is at all interested in starting a pettition, I will get<br/>
&gt; things going.� Just let me know and I can get things rolling on<br/>
&gt; it....� Even<br/>
&gt; if you dont respond to me on this, I will get things going anyways.�<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; James....I also am getting a little bored with my level 19 Barbarian<br/>
&gt; Warrior.� One of the reasons, I guess, that I started the Bard.�<br/>
&gt; I do think<br/>
&gt; that Verant has overlooked us slightly.� When I played Realm, the<br/>
&gt; warrior on<br/>
&gt; there could buy mana and cast spells.� Agreed, they didn&#39;t work as well as<br/>
&gt; the mages did, but we still could have the basics.� I would like to see<br/>
&gt; Verant come up with another plan.� Perhaps some sort of magic skill, so at<br/>
&gt; the very least, we could gate and cast healing on ourselves.�<br/>
