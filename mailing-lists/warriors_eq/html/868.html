<div id="ygrps-yiv-567039832">Let me tell you how to handle kill stealing.  Some of you may not agree with<br/>
my method but hey we all choose to handle situations in different ways.  I<br/>
have a Character that has the spell Fear.   When I am playing with my main<br/>
character and someone steals my kill: 1st) I ignore it the first time giving<br/>
them the benefit of the doubt. 2nd time)  I politely ask the individual to<br/>
stop. 3rd time)  I ask them OOC to stop...again politely.  4th time)  If the<br/>
individual continues to do so usually by the 4th time he/she has become<br/>
rather rude. So......I log off.  I log on my Character with the Fear spell.<br/>
I find this individual.  Each and EVERY time he/she engages and enemy I cast<br/>
Fear upon that enemy.  The NPC turns and high tales it away.  My offender<br/>
then has to chase the enemy down if he/she is a warrior or make sure that<br/>
the NPC does not get out of the range of their spells if they are a Caster.<br/>
After a couple of minutes I let them know who I am and tell them that I will<br/>
kindly leave them alone if they leave me alone.  I know some of you will<br/>
look down upon this method and I fully understand your veiw.  This usually<br/>
takes care of my problem Kill stealers that I am unfortunate enough to run<br/>
across.  I even have had one instance Where a fighter continuously stole<br/>
kills from me after he had agreed not to do so again.  So I logged my Fear<br/>
character back on and followed this poor sap for 2 hours and watched him<br/>
chase down each and EVERY kill that he got.  I usually play for about 12<br/>
stints so when I play I have plenty of time to do this if the need arises.<br/>
He finally emoted his character begging me on bended knee to leave him<br/>
alone.  Revenge DOES work sometimes even if it is not my preferred method of<br/>
handling a problem.<br/>

&gt;no offence but this was pretty stooopid.<br/>
&gt;I dont want to start a flame war, but this is an eaven larger problem then<br/>
&gt;farming. I have been stolen from several times, what do I do.<br/>
&gt;If its done more then once I usualy give 1 ooc msg and leave it at that.<br/>
&gt;Man it is afterall a game,,,,eaven if I spend about 6h online everyday. The<br/>
&gt;only thing this post did was to send shivers down my spine.<br/>
