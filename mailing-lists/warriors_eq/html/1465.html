<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019352172">As stated before, there is more to playing a warrior than<br/>
attack/kick/bash/taunt,  just as there is more to playing a cleric than<br/>
heal/root/damage/heal.  If you want to make suggestions to improve the<br/>
warrior class, thats good.  But please stop with the drivel about there is<br/>
nothing to playing a warrior.  Most people who play a warrior past the<br/>
newbie stages will disagree with you (otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be playing the<br/>
warrior anymore).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; When it comes down to a battle, the Warrior&#39;s job is to choose the correct<br/>
&gt; critter to attack/kick/bash/taunt.  Thats about it.  A good Warrior will<br/>
&gt; make the best choices here.  A good Warrior will switch targets many times<br/>
&gt; in a battle, distributing his attacks and taunts to keep the spellcasters<br/>
&gt; free from attack.  Some of the best Warriors will switch armor/weapons<br/>
&gt; based<br/>
&gt; on what monster they are fighting.  Some go even as far to switch a shield<br/>
&gt; in and out in the middle of battle depending if they are getting hit or<br/>
&gt; not.<br/>
