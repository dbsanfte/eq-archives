<div id="ygrps-yiv-394303586">Please read my other post, I know THIS is an old post but I feel that RUDE<br/>
camping is unacceptable, and no there is no where else for some of us to go.<br/>
I like playing with my American friends, but we never seem to get anything<br/>
done, then again when I am playing during US weekdays its GREAT, stuff is<br/>
empty, then again finding even a PARTNER can be difficult.  Im a warrior and<br/>
we all know that at my level if I dont have a partner I may as well logout.<br/>
Catch 22.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately I have real-life friends to fall back on, but that means<br/>
restarting my character or playing two characters.  Either way its a pain.<br/>
Oh well, back to level 1 for me.<br/>

&gt; Someone else said:<br/>
&gt; &gt;I hate it when people get twinked out like you.  Its people like you that<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; cause the camping &gt;problem.  Your guildmates camped for their items, which<br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have a problem with, the &gt;continued FARMING to get items for <br/>
&gt; guildmates, blah.  I&#39;ve never had a single magic item &gt;given to me, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been <br/>
&gt; there beside my guild buds working to get my items the whole &gt;game......ok<br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; shut up now<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yeah, and I bet you also had to walk to school barefoot in the snow uphill<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; both ways, right?  Look, regarding this whole &quot;twinking&quot; thing (a name I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; not heard before I read this list), I think the ones complaining are the<br/>
&gt; ones <br/>
&gt; who don&#39;t really understand the spirit of the game.  They are the ones who<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t realize forming parties and guilds is encouraged, and that while <br/>
&gt; remaining solo might be fun sometimes, it just plain won&#39;t be as effective<br/>
&gt; as <br/>
&gt; being part of a group.  So then we have these soloists running about<br/>
&gt; whining <br/>
&gt; about &quot;farmers&quot;.  My response to that is thus: big fat hairy deal.<br/>
&gt; Norrath <br/>
&gt; is huge and up 24 hrs. a day.  Go find some uninhabited area and start<br/>
&gt; your <br/>
&gt; own farm.  I have zero sympathy for someone whining about how he can&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; tomahawk axe.  Go and kill-steal one.  If they were farming (and being<br/>
&gt; rude <br/>
&gt; about it to boot), then they deserve to have a few kills stolen anyway.<br/>
