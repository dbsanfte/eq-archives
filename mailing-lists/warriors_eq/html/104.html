<b>Subject:</b> Re: A question on kill stealing. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-543217455">1)  If you chased him down and did the most damage, you should take the loot<br/>
2)  the party that does the most damage gets the xp and the loot, doesn&#39;t matter who gets the killing blow.<br/>
3)  Depending on my mood, I would have either told him to F off, or just ignored him and continued my hunting.  Kill stealing is a legitimate problem in the game, but it seems to me that there are a lot of people just itching to say HEY, YOU STOLE MY KILL....dunno why, but thats what it seems like to me.  A prime example happened to me last night, we were in Cazic Thule, fighting a 34th or 35th lvl Zealot.  After a long and hard fight, we killed it, then some guy comes running up to our party and says &quot;hey ass holes, that was our zealot&quot;.  A) never even saw this guy until the zealot was running, B) he was 25th lvl, no way in hell he could have even hurt the zealot.  He hung around for a few minutes bitching about people who steal kills, while in groupsay we were all like &quot;wtf is this guy talking about&quot;, ignored him and he eventually left.....ya see, the world is full of idiots....just like real life :)<br/>

1.) Was I ethically wrong to take the loot?<br/>
2.) Does the game only allow the majority damage dealer to take the<br/>
loot, or the final swinger?<br/>
3.) How would you guys deal with this situation?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advice ....<br/>
