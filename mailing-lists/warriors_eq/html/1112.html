<div id="ygrps-yiv-626809941">I have recently started a Wood Elf Bard character, and I was wondering if anyone had any hints on playing her.  I am level 2, and have bought the first two spells.  I bought a mandolin and a lute, and have no idea how to use them.  Perhaps this comes at a later level?  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
