<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646151320"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;If they actually did that to the warrior class, let them advance 6 a &gt;lvl, <br/>
&gt;there would be no stopping them.  Some of you may not want to &gt;see this, <br/>
&gt;but at gameznet.com/eq there is a new post about the &gt;success at duel <br/>
&gt;wielding and double attack.  With all these updates &gt;you guys would nonstop <br/>
&gt;4 hit attack. Now, I see how as of right now &gt;the warrior are worse than <br/>
&gt;the SKs, pallys, and rangers.  But if you &gt;do much to the warriors you guys <br/>
&gt;will be able to blow us away.  I&#39;m &gt;a troll SK and my guys is mainly a <br/>
&gt;warrior with a few spells.  If you<br/>
&gt;do all these things you people have listed to the warrior class then <br/>
&gt; &gt;warriors will be a super class, be reasonable.  Ask for some small <br/>
&gt; &gt;changes.  Not letting their skills increase at 6 a lvl and go up to &gt;300 <br/>
&gt;AND ask for weapon specialization.  A warrior would outdamage a &gt;gd WIZARD! <br/>
&gt;  You people are crazy if you except them to make that &gt;kind of change.<br/>

Hummm let&#39;s see.  If I hit 4 times in one round for, oh let&#39;s go for broke, <br/>
say 25 points each [some super magic 1H sword from h*#l] = 100 points.  <br/>
Wizard with comet spell, one turn = 1500 points.<br/>
<br/>
Geez, all we are asking for is wpn specialization and skill cap at 250 or so <br/>
like the other classes already have in their unique skills.<br/>

note: Verant has already made many changes early on in other classes.  Us <br/>
warriors only waited until now to ask for a couple of small additions.  <br/>
Warriors will always have to group at higher levels, tis the nature of being <br/>
a tank.</div>
