&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;More HPs - Lets us take more damage&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

&gt;A pointless improvement, IMHO.  If I&#39;m solo I already have to spend a very<br/>
&gt;long time sitting and waiting for my health to come back.  Last thing I<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would you rather wait LONGER for more HPs to regen or would you prefer<br/>
death?<br/>
<br/>
If you are wounded to a point where you are waiting longer, you would have<br/>
been dead without those extra HPs.  Extra HPs also allow you to fight longer<br/>
before having to run.  I don&#39;t see how anyone could think this is a<br/>
pointless improvement.<br/>
<br/>
If every warrior got 1000 HPs per level, would it still be pointless?<br/>
