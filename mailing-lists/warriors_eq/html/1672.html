<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744875238"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">Thanks for help, i have done the hill gaint in RM and killed the rangers in 
<br>EC along with gaurd Reskin and the other at west end of zone, and killed 
<br>gaurds in WC, i dont recommend doing any of those for exp, not bad exp and 
<br>good loot but i think there has to be better. I also tried OT and not much 
<br>exp although everything conned usually yellow or red not sure why exp bad. 
<br>The place i did get good exp was CT that place rocks just tired of being 
<br>there. I am about to leave for SolA never been there, i can report back to 
<br>you if you want? 31 Warrior</font></font></html></div>
