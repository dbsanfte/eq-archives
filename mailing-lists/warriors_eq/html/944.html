<div id="ygrps-yiv-858044516">I noticed something curious yesterday.  My level 23rd character has a bbc, I<br/>
never use it, but I dont want to give it away either.  I started another<br/>
warrior and gave her the BBC.  I wanted to keep both my 1hslash and 2hslash<br/>
nice and high with this character.<br/>
<br/>
After 2 levels my 2hand slash NEVER went up.  I did put a practice point in<br/>
it as well, seems odd.  New programming for powerful items?</div>
