<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725086669">I confirmed that Orcs in Crushbone Castle do not effect Neriak factions.<br/>
<br/>
I know a few people argued this point, and I finally got back to check it out.  I killed the Prophet, Emperor Crush, emissaries, orcales and legionaires in Crush castle without one negative faction adjustment to the Indigo Brotherhood.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to settle that old argument.<br/>
