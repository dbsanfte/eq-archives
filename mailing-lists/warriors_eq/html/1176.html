<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892722810">My argument are based on real life, not fantasy.  You still have not<br/>
addressed the biggest point.  Whether our head is cut off, or you get fried<br/>
by a lightning strike, your just as dead.<br/>
<br/>
Now, let&#39;s talk fantasy, in most fantasy novels the mighty wizard isn&#39;t<br/>
sitting around frying one creature, he&#39;s unleashed on an army of critters.<br/>
This is where the mage should shine, his ability to strike at a distance at<br/>
many targets, doing significant damage.  A fireball should hot everything in<br/>
an area, not just one creature.  The warrior should be able, at high levels<br/>
to work his way thru an army, one opponent at a time.  But, when that blade<br/>
slices and dices, the end effect is the same as their spell, bad for whoever<br/>
is one the receiving end.  <br/>
<br/>
Why play a wizard, because no matter who good a warrior is, he can be<br/>
overrun by alot of opponents, the Wizard can attack these mobs of creatures,<br/>
soften them up, or cause them to run, buying the warrior time.<br/>
<br/>
And what of the fantasy of the mighty Knight slaying the dragon with Lance<br/>
and sword?  Can&#39;t happen here can it?  <br/>
<br/>
What you are arguing for is an artificial set of rules in the name of game<br/>
balance.  I say that there are many ways to balance out the different<br/>
classes, while preserving both the realistic and fantasy feel of Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, my opinion may differ from yours, but it is not wrong. That<br/>
statement is just darn impolite and provocative, and it goes to hinder<br/>
intellectual debate, rather then encourage the free exchange of ideas.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think those kind of statements have a place here, but that is just my<br/>
opinion.<br/>

&gt; You are wrong  Your experiences with live steel weapons does <br/>
&gt; not relate to a<br/>
&gt; fantasy game.  You have no valid comparison to what damage a <br/>
&gt; sword should do<br/>
&gt; versus a magical spell.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Melee fighters should be able to do just as much damage, if <br/>
&gt; not more [than<br/>
&gt; a caster]&quot;<br/>
&gt; This would be totally imbalanced.  If a warrior could could <br/>
&gt; do that much<br/>
&gt; damage, and wear the best armor in the game, and have the <br/>
&gt; most hp&#39;s, why<br/>
&gt; would anyone play anything else?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Warriors do less damage than a wizard BECAUSE they can stay in a fight<br/>
&gt; longer with the monster due to his greater hp&#39;s and armor.  <br/>
&gt; Over time, a<br/>
&gt; Warrior will do more damage that the Wizard.  But it would <br/>
&gt; wreck the game if<br/>
&gt; Warriors could deal damage as fast as Wizards.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Re: Petition or Melee vs. Caster damage<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Sorry, that last email was just too hard to read!!!  Here <br/>
&gt; it is again in<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; plain text!<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I think the difference between melee combatants and <br/>
&gt; casters magic should<br/>
&gt; &gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; thus:  Melee fighters should be able to do just as much <br/>
&gt; damage, if not<br/>
&gt; &gt;more,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; whereas a caster may strike from a distance, and strike <br/>
&gt; multiple targets<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; with area effect spells.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I am the president of a national group that fights with live steel<br/>
&gt; &gt;weapons.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;ve been fighting with long swords, 2-handed swords, axes <br/>
&gt; and maces for<br/>
&gt; &gt;10<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; years, and I am very comfortable with just how devastating <br/>
&gt; these weapons<br/>
&gt; &gt;can<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; be.  No matter if you are struck by lightning or are cut <br/>
&gt; in 2 by a large<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; axe, you are just as dead!<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; So perhaps the direction we need to seek, and the <br/>
&gt; difference between<br/>
&gt; these<br/>
&gt; &gt;2<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; types of characters. melee and caster, is not how much <br/>
&gt; damage they do,<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; how.  A caster should be able to reach far away, and <br/>
&gt; strike multiple<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; targets, while the great warrior should only be able to <br/>
&gt; strike at one<br/>
&gt; &gt;target<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; at a time, but be able to mow them down like wheat.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Oh, and if anyone is interested in an organization that <br/>
&gt; allow you to wear<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; armor and swing a real blade ( and trust me, it will give <br/>
&gt; you a whole new<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; perspective on your RPGing!) check out our website!<br/>
