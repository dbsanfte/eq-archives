<div id="ygrps-yiv-289837400">Does anyone on this list have practical information concerning a way to do<br/>
Nagafen, PoH, PoF, and Vox?  We have been the first groups on Quellious to<br/>
break into PoH and PoF.  Unfortunately, both have been marginally<br/>
successful.  PoH isnt so difficult when you look at how ugly PoF is.  Also,<br/>
we are planning on Raiding Lord Nagafen this weekend, and would really love<br/>
to have some information from those who have done it before on some of the<br/>
best tactics on how to accomplish this.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has some tactics they could pass along on all of these raids, I<br/>
would be most grateful.<br/>
