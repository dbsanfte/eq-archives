<br/>
First of all, to answer the question of a full suit of bronze.  A small suit <br/>
can cost from 300p to 350p.  Also, I bought a Symbol of loyalty to Vox <br/>
Bracer for 20p!  I found out that is twice as good as a Steel Plate one.  <br/>
Nonetheless, I am selling it because in a while it will probally be common.  <br/>
People have offered 400p and more for it!  Talk about profit.  I have just <br/>
gotten dual wield, what should I use, I am thinking of buying two combine <br/>
LS&#39;s, to replace my Dwarven 2H axe.  Should I?  Also, could two Tentacle <br/>
whips be better than two combine LS&#39;s?  Well, Can anyone tell me what 1H <br/>
slashing weapons I should get, I have about 400p now. )<br/>
