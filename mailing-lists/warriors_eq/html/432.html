<div id="ygrps-yiv-942169866">HI.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone know what class is the fastest to advance levels <br/>
in.<br/>
I know erudites for example get less xp then other races.<br/>
How about darkelves? they get more or less xp?<br/>
<br/>
And also, does the god you worship affect xp?<br/>
I know it affects the overall diff, on the game but does it affect xp?<br/>
<br/>
Would be logical that if you decide to worship the prince of hate, wich will <br/>
increase the game diff alot, you should get more xp, is this how it works?<br/>
<br/>
I know some of you dont want this info...so if anyone knows the answer,<br/>
tag the mail with spoiler hehe<br/>
<br/>
thanx<br/>
