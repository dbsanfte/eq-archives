<div id="ygrps-yiv-999247858"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I hope you kind sirs will pardon the unspeakable ignorance of a young lad<br/>
&gt; such as myself. I have seven questions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 4. How is experience divided in a group?  Is it the same amout as solo,<br/>
&gt; split<br/>
&gt; into shares, or is there more total experience given out?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>According to the folks at EQ, the higher levels get more of the XP, this is<br/>
to encourage people to stay with their same level and to dissuade &quot;tanks&quot; in<br/>
the traditional style (i.e. the 31st level warrior standing there taking all<br/>
the hits while the 5th level warrior hits for all the XP.) According to<br/>
them, the gap between levels gets longer the higher level you are, so that a<br/>
25th and a 32nd level can get about the same xp, but between an 11th and a<br/>
5thm the 11th would get ALL of the xp. That&#39;s the scheme as far as I know<br/>
it.<br/>

&gt; 6. Are there any quests to become non-PvP?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, as far as I have heard.......no. If you are on any server other than the<br/>
PvP server, YOU made the choice to be PvP or Non PvP. I don&#39;t know how it is<br/>
for all races, but in order for me to become PvP I have to give a Priest Of<br/>
Discord the Lore Book that I started with. As I was not ready to get my arse<br/>
kicked in by everyone who could PvP, I put the book in my vault until I am<br/>
ready to give it to him.....if ever. Players who made the choice to PvP have<br/>
a red name instead of a blue one like everyone else. And to my knowledge, if<br/>
you chose to be PvP no amount of questing will change that.<br/>
