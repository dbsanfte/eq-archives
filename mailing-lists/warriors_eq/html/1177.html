<div id="ygrps-yiv-61515584">You ignore the main difference between the two, one can only strike agfainst<br/>
a single opponent, while the other works against groups of opponents.  Oh,<br/>
and yes, I have a very good clue about game balance.  Right now, it is out<br/>
of balance, otherwise we would have warriors being able to solo just as<br/>
easily as Mages, Necros, Rangers and the like.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many of the Warriors here have complained that they cannot do <br/>
&gt; damage as fast<br/>
&gt; as a Wizard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now all of you real life ninjas and steel sword swinging <br/>
&gt; fools just calm<br/>
&gt; down.  Read carefully.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Warriors get to wear platemail and have many more hps than a Wizard.<br/>
&gt; Warriors also have a higher Offense, Defense, and Weapon <br/>
&gt; skills.  This all<br/>
&gt; means that a Warrior can stand toe to toe against an NPC.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now lets make a Warrior have the same ability to deal damage <br/>
&gt; as a Wizard.<br/>
&gt; Now we would have a class that has the best armor, the highest combat<br/>
&gt; skills, the most hp&#39;s AND the ability to deal the most damage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why would anyone want to play a Wizard if a Warrior could do <br/>
&gt; as much damage<br/>
&gt; AND be able to take blows in melee?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wayne<br/>
&gt; PS - When someone says that a Warrior should be able to deal <br/>
&gt; as much damage<br/>
&gt; as fast as a Wizard I immediately realize this person doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; have a clue<br/>
&gt; about game balance.<br/>
