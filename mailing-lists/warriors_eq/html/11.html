<br/>
I am a lvl 16 Barbarian warrior, and here are my advises:<br/>
<br/>
You should decide already now wether you want use a 2h weapon or a 1h<br/>
weapon. Personally I went for the 1H.<br/>
<br/>
This will make you a bit less effective untill you reach about lvl 15, when<br/>
you get dual wield and doubble attack. This will from there on be pretty<br/>
much the same, if not better than a 2h weapon.<br/>
Since you are a Human warrior, you cannot use bash, and 2 1H weapons or a 2H<br/>
weapon and bash due to that you will need a shield. Therefor you should keep<br/>
on using Kick. Bash never will hit it for you, if you dont decide to use a<br/>
shield and a 1h sword, who I havent seen any warrior over lvl 15 use.<br/>
Also keep Taunt and Sense heading maxed, these are two good skills to use in<br/>
the future. A warrior who cannot taunt the beast whacking the wizard to<br/>
pieces are no warrior at all and will loose.<br/>
Bind Wounds is expensive to work up, but I have now learned it is a very<br/>
usefull skill and should be worked on. (have a magician summon bandages for<br/>
you)<br/>
<br/>
It is also recommended that you have a primary weapon skill, and a<br/>
secoundary. At later levels if you find an awesome weapon you be sure you<br/>
can use it! I would personally recommend working 1h slash as primary, and 2h<br/>
slash as secoundary.<br/>
<br/>
You never need to put more than one skill point in any skill, but some<br/>
skills can be a pain in the ass to work when they are under 10 skill. I have<br/>
never put more than 9 in a skill, and I now have almost maxed out Doubble<br/>
attack and dual wield at lvl 16 (soon 17).<br/>
<br/>
A place for you to hunt now at lvl 7 and all the way up to lvl 15 or 16 is<br/>
BlackBurrow.<br/>
I did it up to lvl 16 there.<br/>
<br/>
At last I would like to tell you all about a messageboard for Warriors.<br/>
