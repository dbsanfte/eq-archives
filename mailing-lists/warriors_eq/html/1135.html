<div id="ygrps-yiv-612091184">What Verant needs to do and I think trys to do is provide distinction among<br/>
the classes without having any one class over-shadow all of the others.<br/>
�<br/>
Although my experience is minimal compared to your (my level 13 and your<br/>
level 43 (44?)), I would support your petition to ensure that the warrior<br/>
class is made to be distictive and the one true melee combat class.� If<br/>
Verant has erred somewhere by allowing all of the &quot;add-on&quot; things of the<br/>
hybrid classes to cause these classes to compete with or go further than the<br/>
warriors in the higher levels, then they need to do something to fix it.<br/>
�<br/>
I&#39;d hate to spend all my time getting to where you are and end up feeling<br/>
like it was just not worth it.<br/>

I am not actually board with my character, just tired of waiting for the<br/>
goodies to come when they are actually no where to be found.� They will<br/>
never get to us, and we are outweighed even in a group setting by other<br/>
melee classes.<br/>
�<br/>
I am not so concerned about the magic using/healing/gating part of this as I<br/>
am the fact that the masters of physical combat (warriors) are anything but<br/>
that.� Healing never has been IMO a part of what a warrior can do.� But a<br/>
warrior is supposed to be the master or armed combat.� When we cap out at<br/>
skill level 200 and others can go beyond that as well as do more damage than<br/>
us warrior, something is definitely wrong.� I think we should start a<br/>
pettition to verant to try to even things out a bit more.� The suggestions<br/>
in this post on EQ`Lizer for modifying the Warrior class are well thought<br/>
and not too much to ask.�<br/>
�<br/>
If anyone else is at all interested in starting a pettition, I will get<br/>
things going.� Just let me know and I can get things rolling on it....� Even<br/>
if you dont respond to me on this, I will get things going anyways.� <br/>

James....I also am getting a little bored with my level 19 Barbarian<br/>
Warrior.� One of the reasons, I guess, that I started the Bard.� I do think<br/>
that Verant has overlooked us slightly.� When I played Realm, the warrior on<br/>
there could buy mana and cast spells.� Agreed, they didn&#39;t work as well as<br/>
the mages did, but we still could have the basics.� I would like to see<br/>
Verant come up with another plan.� Perhaps some sort of magic skill, so at<br/>
the very least, we could gate and cast healing on ourselves.� <br/>
