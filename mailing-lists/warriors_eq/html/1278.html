<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330141572">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
There is a new survey for the warriors_eq community. <br/>
<br/>
Warriors Forever<br/>
<br/>
In reading recent posts to this list, I think it is safe to assume that most of us agree that Warriors are Tanks and should be the true masters of melee in Norrath.  No way should we be able to cause the damage high level magic users can, but do we do enough as we are now?  This survey is intended to gather a consensus from this mailing list to submit as feedback to Verant.  If enough of us agree on the same thing Verant will look into the issues and make adjustments as they have for other classes.<br/>
<br/>
Do we need to ask Verant to change anything about the Warrior class?  If yes (or undecided) what would you like to see?<br/>
<br/>
I will compile the results and post them to list next week.<br/>
