This is taken from Archmage Answers on the official EQ site.  This answer is<br/>
from the Archmage Geoffrey Zatkin (GZ) himself<br/>
<br/>
Q: Is it true that I get more experience when I party?<br/>
<br/>
A: Yes. If you kill a monster solo, you get X experience. If a party of two<br/>
kills a monster, you get X + P (P = Party Experience Addition), divided by<br/>
two (half of that experience for each of you). The bigger your party, the<br/>
bigger that P is - the Party Experience Addition is larger for three people<br/>
then for then for two, and larger for four people then for three, etc.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, pets do NOT count towards P (2 players and 2 pets still<br/>
count as a party of 2).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link.  There&#39;s some other very cool questions there.<br/>
