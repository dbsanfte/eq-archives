&gt; &gt; I hate it when people get twinked out like you.  Its people like you that cause the camping problem.  Your guildmates camped for their items, which I don&#39;t have a problem with, the continued FARMING to get items for guildmates, blah.  I&#39;ve never had a single magic item given to me, I&#39;ve been there beside my guild buds working to get my items the whole game......ok I shut up now<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I totally and wholeheartedly agree with you Jason.  All the items that i<br/>
&gt; have obtained, I have gotten them with my guildmates at my side during<br/>
&gt; battle. It is people like that, those twinked level 13 chars, that make me<br/>
&gt; SO frustrated because i cannot even get a goddamn tomahawk axe. I&#39;m level<br/>
&gt; twenty now, and have been trying with my group to get a tomahawk axe since<br/>
&gt; level 17. Back then i needed the group to be able to kill the gnoll.  Now<br/>
&gt; i am able to do it solo if i was ever given the chance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been reading all the ideas for what verant should do, and this is<br/>
&gt; what i think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Make all items LORE, so you can only have on in your possesion and in<br/>
&gt; bank.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Make all rare items level specific. If the monster is more than lets say 4<br/>
&gt; levels above you and your party, you cannot obtain or use the specific<br/>
&gt; item.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Make all rare items class specidifc, similar to LORE. No offense to<br/>
&gt; casters, but i&#39;m sick and itred of casters getting warrior only items<br/>
&gt; SPECIFICALLY to sell them to us. Bullshit.<br/>
