OK this is a quest designed for evil characters so all you goodie twoshoes<br/>
may as well forget about it.<br/>
<br/>
1. Ok first off you have to go to the necro/SK guild in Neriak and talk to<br/>
the head SK (Ive forgotten his name but he is pretty easy to pick out.) You<br/>
have to talk to him and he&#39;ll give you the quest to go kill the paladin in<br/>
the lavastorm mountains.<br/>
<br/>
2. once you kill the paladin and return his prayer book to the guild leader,<br/>
he will ask you to take a note to a member in the West commonlands, Gix.<br/>
<br/>
3. Give gix the note and hell ask you to fetch him the hammer peices from<br/>
befallen. The first two are located on the elf skeleton at the beginning of<br/>
level 3 (level 16-20 ) and the third is located on the Commander mummy in<br/>
Befallen. He is a REALLY rare spawn ( I still havent seen him ) and he drops<br/>
the thrid peice, bring them to gix and Voila you get the thex mallet.</div>
