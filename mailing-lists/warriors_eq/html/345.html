<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311108299">Speaking of women.....There is one big question I have.....why do guys play girl characters....some say they are role playing.....do they also dress up in womens close and role play women in real life?  or is &quot;role playing&quot; a female the first step towards role playing a real life female? I know there are a lot of legitimate female players, but I&#39;d bet a large sum of money that most of the female characters are being driven by guys.....call me homophobic if you will, but I think its weird.<br/>
