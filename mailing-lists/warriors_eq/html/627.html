<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567546664">I played a paladin, and they have not got the raw power of the warrior BUT<br/>
that LOH was very nice, and I could actually solo stuff a lot more.  The<br/>
paladin is a good self-sufficient fighter, with the ranger probably an<br/>
equal, there lack of spells being made up for by there forage ability (i.e.<br/>
self-sufficient).<br/>
<br/>
ALSO that 9 levels behind thing is a misnomer.  If a level 20 paladin casts<br/>
courage on himself it will be BETTER than a level 15 cleric casting the same<br/>
spell.  Sure the paladin is casting a level 1 spell, but its cast at a level<br/>
20 ability.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Paladin.....they ARE a joke, their healing ability<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a joke, their buffing ability is a joke, because<br/>
&gt; &gt; their heals and buffs are 9 levels behind, the only<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing they have going for them is their lay hands,<br/>
&gt; &gt; which can be very good, but I dont&#39; think it makes<br/>
&gt; &gt; up for their lack of melee ability.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Uh ... ok.  If you say so.  I call Paladins &#39;self-filling tanks&#39;,<br/>
&gt; because they are just that.  They&#39;re not really effective until they<br/>
&gt; get Meditate at 12th, but once there they can do a solo fight that<br/>
&gt; drags them down to 1 bar of HP; and be back in another fight in 7-10<br/>
&gt; mins.  For a corresponding warrior, it would be 13-18 mins, or more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lay On Hands is the Panic Button; you can push it to get out of jail,<br/>
&gt; or at least, have more time to either finish off the mob or run for<br/>
&gt; safety. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for the spells being 9 levels behind, so?  Paladins are<br/>
&gt; fighter/healers, while Clerics are healer/fighters.  Clerics can be<br/>
&gt; mini-tanks up until about 9th or 10th; but Paladins can tank all the<br/>
&gt; way to 50.  The ability to tank and still have a reserve to compliment<br/>
&gt; the party&#39;s cleric is useful.  Past 10th, Clerics are 80%+ casters for<br/>
&gt; all realistic intents and purposes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Paladins don&#39;t get Kick; but at 6th they get bash which I personally<br/>
&gt; like much better.  Kick won&#39;t interrupt casting, while Bash will.  I<br/>
&gt; stopped using Kick with my Troll Warrior when I got Bash (which let my<br/>
&gt; Slam start being much more effective)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re fixated on Dual Wield (which I think you might be, since you<br/>
&gt; mentioned Rangers; and they&#39;re the only hybrid, that I recall, that<br/>
&gt; gets Dual Wield); that might explain why you like Warriors and Rangers<br/>
&gt; the most.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Personally, I think the jury&#39;s still out on Dual Wield, and on melee in<br/>
&gt; general.  The further up you go, the more the offensive and debuff<br/>
&gt; spellcasters really carry the fight to the mobs; the tanks are just<br/>
&gt; there to do what their name says.  If this is proven out, then Dueal<br/>
&gt; Wield or no, the tanks are just there to soak damage.  If this is not<br/>
&gt; proven, then Dual Wield still has to debate against the endless fighter<br/>
&gt; arguements of Dual Wield vs 2H Weapons (which is one of those semantic<br/>
&gt; arguements, IMO; stats bear each out)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For grouping, I&#39;d prefer to have pure tank in the tank slot, any day of<br/>
&gt; the week; with a Paladin fighting alongside him.  (my ideal 6man group<br/>
&gt; is 2 Warriors, 1 Paladin, 1 Cleric, 1 Wizard, 1 Bard; haven&#39;t assembled<br/>
&gt; it yet, but it sounds fun!) For soloing, however, the Paladin is more<br/>
&gt; efficient than the Warrior.<br/>
