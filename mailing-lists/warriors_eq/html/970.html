massive item-farmers (those who camp for long periods<br/>
to get multiple drops of a cool item, like Shiny Brass<br/>
Shield, etc...).<br/>
<br/>
1st - 5th, work on getting patchwork and the rusty<br/>
weapons that correspond to the skills you want to work<br/>
up.  Most warriors recommend working up both 1h-s and<br/>
2h-s; you may want to also work, at your preference,<br/>
1h-b, 2h-b and/or pierce.<br/>
<br/>
6th - 10th, work on upgrading to leather/rawhide<br/>
armor, with the odd piece that&#39;s low-level magical. <br/>
By 10th you should be able to have a minotaur axe<br/>
(1h-s) and/or a FS weapon(s) for your first two or<br/>
three weapon skill preferences.<br/>
<br/>
11th - 15th, start collecting banded and magical<br/>
armor, work away from any rusty weapons, and start<br/>
working on combine and/or magical weapons in your<br/>
prefered slots.<br/>
<br/>
16th - plus, it varies.  You&#39;ll start working<br/>
exclusively with groups, or spending a lot of time<br/>
begging for heals.  You&#39;ll be hanging out in areas<br/>
where money and/or valuable or useful item drops start<br/>
to happen with greater frequency.  By this point you<br/>
need at least one magical weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Look over the warrior skill progression and note which<br/>
you&#39;ll be interested in; decide if you like kick or<br/>
bash, if you like dual wield vs 1h/shield vs 2h. <br/>
Advance and item yourself accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
