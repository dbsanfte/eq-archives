<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764883763">You are wrong  Your experiences with live steel weapons does not relate to a<br/>
fantasy game.  You have no valid comparison to what damage a sword should do<br/>
versus a magical spell.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Melee fighters should be able to do just as much damage, if not more [than<br/>
a caster]&quot;<br/>
This would be totally imbalanced.  If a warrior could could do that much<br/>
damage, and wear the best armor in the game, and have the most hp&#39;s, why<br/>
would anyone play anything else?<br/>
<br/>
Warriors do less damage than a wizard BECAUSE they can stay in a fight<br/>
longer with the monster due to his greater hp&#39;s and armor.  Over time, a<br/>
Warrior will do more damage that the Wizard.  But it would wreck the game if<br/>
Warriors could deal damage as fast as Wizards.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Sorry, that last email was just too hard to read!!!  Here it is again in<br/>
&gt;&gt; plain text!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I think the difference between melee combatants and casters magic should<br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;&gt; thus:  Melee fighters should be able to do just as much damage, if not<br/>
&gt;more,<br/>
&gt;&gt; whereas a caster may strike from a distance, and strike multiple targets<br/>
&gt;&gt; with area effect spells.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I am the president of a national group that fights with live steel<br/>
&gt;weapons.<br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve been fighting with long swords, 2-handed swords, axes and maces for<br/>
&gt;10<br/>
&gt;&gt; years, and I am very comfortable with just how devastating these weapons<br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt;&gt; be.  No matter if you are struck by lightning or are cut in 2 by a large<br/>
&gt;&gt; axe, you are just as dead!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; So perhaps the direction we need to seek, and the difference between<br/>
 </span></blockquote>these<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2<br/>
&gt;&gt; types of characters. melee and caster, is not how much damage they do,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; how.  A caster should be able to reach far away, and strike multiple<br/>
&gt;&gt; targets, while the great warrior should only be able to strike at one<br/>
&gt;target<br/>
&gt;&gt; at a time, but be able to mow them down like wheat.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Oh, and if anyone is interested in an organization that allow you to wear<br/>
&gt;&gt; armor and swing a real blade ( and trust me, it will give you a whole new<br/>
&gt;&gt; perspective on your RPGing!) check out our website!<br/>
