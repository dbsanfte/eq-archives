<b>Subject:</b> Re: Ad&D and EQ - Argument on Warriors <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580151855">One flaw in that. Rangers (as well as paladins) COULD wear plate. Rangers<br/>
just could not cast spells in plate mail. For all intents and purposes the<br/>
ranger was EXACTLY the same as a fighter, except a few VERY minor things.<br/>
They get 1d8 hit die instead of 1d10 like a fighter, yet they still get the<br/>
constitution bonus. They still get the strength bonus, but were limited in<br/>
weapon specialization. They got the same number of attacks per round, except<br/>
at higher levels and even then it was only a half-attack (every other<br/>
round). Look closely at any AD&D table except experience. They group<br/>
Fighters, Rangers and Paladins all into one group, subclassed the<br/>
&#39;fighter-type&#39;. But I am not trying to argue the fact of rangers vs.<br/>
warriors vs. paladins..... Just warriors vs. damage of other classes. maybe<br/>
just having some really sweet warrior only weapons would be better than<br/>
adding new skills? I mean a warriors strength is his weapon, and warriors<br/>
are supposed to have the greatest variety of weapons, right? Oh well, I<br/>
guess it&#39;s becoming a moot point. I am starting to get very opinionated (too<br/>
late hehe) about this subject, mainly because I like to solo sometimes and<br/>
at 10th level I really couldn&#39;t do that anymore because monsters were<br/>
hitting me for twice as much damage as I was hitting them for, and twice as<br/>
fast. Ok, I am done....sorry for the mindless banter    ;-}~<br/>
