<b>Subject:</b> Weapons for sale and Trade on Bertox <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577071521">I have the following items which might be of interest to warriors on Bertox<br/>
<br/>
1 2-handed dwarven axe - Damage of 14 and Delay of 43 non-magical<br/>
1 Shiny Brass Halberd - Damage 16 and Delay of 48 magical<br/>
<br/>
I am looking to trade the shiny brass halberd for a blackened iron bastard sword<br/>
<br/>
I am also willing to entertain a trade for a BBC.  I prefer swords, but got the Halberd because it was easier.  Befallen was plagued by newbies falling down the well and starting nasty trains of necromancers and I am unfamiliar with Runnyeye. It is completely empty most of the time, and no place to explore without a full party and guide.<br/>
<br/>
If you know the details of getting the blackened iron bastard sword and are willing to become part of party to obtain it, I will give you my share of the loot obtained on the trip.  I have others I can recruit for the trip so we could have a full party.<br/>
