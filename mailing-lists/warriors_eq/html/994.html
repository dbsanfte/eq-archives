<div id="ygrps-yiv-435428347">I feel for ya Patty... anyone who has ever died the quick death of a giants fist<br/>
will tell you .... it isn&#39;t fun.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a story for you:<br/>
My group and I had been pretty weary from the many Dervish camps so we decided<br/>
to have a little adventure in Befallen. As we entered, we noticed that the non<br/>
undead had come out in droves to battle the skeletons for the evening. That&#39;s<br/>
never good.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I enjoy watching evil forces fall from a mighty sword swing, I never<br/>
long to see mass hysteria going on in tight dungeon passageways. We decided to<br/>
venture much deeper into that vile place than ever before, simply to try it, and<br/>
to get away from the crowds. We came upon a door at the end of the stairwell<br/>
that could not be opened. The holder of the key must have been killed and looted<br/>
already so even though we had a key for upper area of this dungeon ... we made<br/>
an unwise choice and slid though the door as another party was leaving.<br/>
<br/>
Our party was ill equipped to handle what we found there. Ice and Dry Bone<br/>
Skeletons attacked us very quickly and through a lot of luck, and some<br/>
assistance we were able to defend ourselves .... just barely. My of us had to<br/>
stop and rest afterward. Thus the problem began.<br/>
<br/>
Someone (we don&#39;t even remember who it was) said .. let&#39;s head out of here and<br/>
kill some more Dervish. So most of us got up and left through the door someone<br/>
had just opened. Our cleric, being very low on mana, was unaware we had left<br/>
since he was deep into his meditation. The door shut and almost immediately an<br/>
ice skeleton set upon him. We thought he was doomed. We screamed for help and in<br/>
the meantime, our paladin performed a miracle. Placing his hands upon the door,<br/>
he performed a laying of hands on the cleric (trapped in the other room), thus<br/>
saving his life while help quickly intervened.<br/>
<br/>
The party was very battle weary afterward so we decided to head out of Befallen.<br/>
As we were getting ready to leave the mouth of the dungeon, a necromancer ran<br/>
out and cast a spell, then ran back behind us. Unsure what she was doing we<br/>
peered outside, only to find out .... she was pulling a hill giant right to the<br/>
entrance. The end result of this was NOT a pretty picture. Many people died. My<br/>
party was extremely upset with this arrogant and back stabbing necro. Many vain<br/>
attempts were made to contact her but ... we never saw her again.<br/>
<br/>
The moral of this story is that giants ALWAYS seem to show up at the worst<br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
OOC: What the hell was this all about? I mean, playing in character for a necro<br/>
is one thing. But destroying our party and several other people just for the fun<br/>
of it?? And then she camped afterwards so we couldn&#39;t even question her on it.<br/>
*Grrrrr* Makes me want to put a Mino upside her skull. There are times I REALLY<br/>
wish I played on Rallos Zek.<br/>
