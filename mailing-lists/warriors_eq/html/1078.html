<div id="ygrps-yiv-593687687">Tom, I am ashamed to say that the sword was a gift from a dear friend, and I just equipped it and walked out to battle when I was killed.  I was in such a state of shock to find it gone, that I forgot the stats and went a little &quot;nuts&quot;.  I will find out for you, and get back on this.  But I still want to know, &quot;WHAT HAPPENED TO MY SWORD&quot;?  LOL<br/>
