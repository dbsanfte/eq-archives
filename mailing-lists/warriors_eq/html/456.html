<div id="ygrps-yiv-428826825">Yes, the women in the game look nice (a leftover from a large male programming<br/>
staff maybe?) But we like the real ones better. The only reason why we might<br/>
dream about the ones from the game are the fact that, like you, they are<br/>
willing to fight by our side in battle ... not fight over who takes the trash<br/>
out.<br/>
