<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868673539">Well Dual Wielding is good from 13-20. After that 2h Weapons inflict MUCH more damage. Dual Wield really doesnt go off alot until lvl 38+, and by that time you should have an Executionars Axe (DAM 25 DELAY 50 procs for Haste). With the exe axe my average slash is around 65 and i have had up to 81 normal and 142 crits. However seems almost all the lvl 45+ warriors on my server  without fearplane blades are switching over to DW Short Swords of Ykesha (DAM 8 DELAY 24 procs for 79-point Ykesha AE spell). Ykesha swords are hard to come by though, as they are found on the Ghould Lord (lvl 53) in Lower Guk. <br/>

  If anyone would make a true warrior only site, I would be willing to help by submitting anything i have for knowledge and information.  I am a proud warrior of the 40th season on the Quellious plane.  I have seen much, and know many of the things young warriors can use to get started.  I havent much time to devote to doing a site myself, but I can help with some submitions.  Much of what was stated concerning best prices, best equipment for the warriors level, and other such information as well as a true &quot;handbook&quot; for the warrior would be a great assest to the warrior community.  I have looked through every class specific site i can find, and only one warrior site have i seen.  Would be good to have a little competition to get more information out to us all.<br/>

    Wow, this email list still lives!<br/>
     <br/>
    I&#39;ve got a question for you.  Do you use a site to see what items are available?  Which one?  How could it be better?  Do you care about news on an items site, or just the items?  Would it need quests listed for quest for items, entirely, or just starting point?  List of Mob it comes from?<br/>
     <br/>
    My reason for asking:  I&#39;m thinking about making one, and if I do, I want it to be THE items site to go to.  I&#39;ve actually already got the database designed, I just need to work on inputting info and designing the site layout.  I could have a preview(not all items) up in 2 days or less if I get enough response.<br/>

      Matt- <br/>
      I have a 30th level barbarian warrior on Veeshan. I can only tell you what I&#39;ve chosen <br/>
      Max out 1hs, 2hs, taunt, kick, slam/bash  and I am working on archery (this has helped me take down runners). <br/>
<br/>
      Some have said take up piercing. When you get duel attack and duel weild only for the fact that a piercing weapon is faster and will help max these skills out. <br/>
<br/>
      I find that 1hs with duel weild is more effective in certain circumstances and then 2hs in another. 1hs gives you speed of attack. 2hs is good for greatest impact (recently got a crit hit of 100.. now that was sweet). If you use a 2hs or 1hs will also depend on your group make up. I do carry all my weapons with me so at times will switch depending on the circumstance. <br/>
<br/>
      All my reading and such have said to keep both maxed out. Some reasons are the performance of the weapon others for the variety of weapons you can use. I didn&#39;t work on my 2hs until I was at the 28th level and it was very painful to max it out. <br/>
<br/>
      Good luck! <br/>
