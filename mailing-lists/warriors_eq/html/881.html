we all want this sword yes i know....with a damage of 35 nd speed of 45 it<br/>
is by far the best weapon i have seen...oh and whats this? it cast<br/>
Inferno?Hmmm gee i think i want this sword, problem is i have no clue, nor<br/>
has anyone ive run into .... where you find this thing. MY guess is that its<br/>
somewhere in the bottom of solusek b dungeon. Which makes damn good sense to<br/>
me...seeing as how its the hardest dungeopn in the game. Heh Anyone on sol<br/>
ro wanna group with me and take a trip to Solusek Dungeon B with me? Heh im<br/>
level 34 now ... so im not THAT scared...well ok maybe a little...<br/>
