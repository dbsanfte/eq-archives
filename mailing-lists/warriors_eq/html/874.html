<b>Subject:</b> Heard about a quest... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-765202030">I am sure if any of you have traveled to Crushbone you have encoutered<br/>
death incarnate (Dvinn) at some point. I have obtained his weapon-an<br/>
ornate dagger dmg 3 delay 20-and i heard that it is part of a quest,<br/>
maybe in Rivervale???, in which you get a hat that gives you charisma<br/>
+10 when you are wearing it. Anyone have any info on this quest? Any<br/>
help would be most appreciated. Thanks in advance.<br/>
