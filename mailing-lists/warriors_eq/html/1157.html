<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363753473">Ok....time for the quote of the day:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Making the warrior a huge damage dealing machine was never the intent of<br/>
Verant and isn&#39;t in the spirit of EQ&#39;s balanced group oriented world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ummm......what game have YOU been playing??!? Balanced? Group Oriented? I<br/>
really think not. The game gives a HUGE advantage to casters and a gigantic<br/>
disadvantage to the true warrior. But I will concede the point that a<br/>
warrior has a little less of an advantage against something like a hill<br/>
giant, BUT only in terms of damage. And maybe not even that....by the time<br/>
the caster gets off his fireball, I could have sliced the giants ankles and<br/>
been done stabbing him in the throat while he was helpless on the ground. I<br/>
think that the first thing you forgot was that EQ is a ROLE-PLAYING game.<br/>
You have to use your imagination. I am saying that before you tell me that I<br/>
can&#39;t cut his ankles or stab him in his throat or even run around him and<br/>
fight him at all. I am using my imagination in the fight. Ok...anyways, back<br/>
to the point. In terms of one-on-one damage I am saying that the two should<br/>
be at the LEAST comparable. You telling me that a warrior is no match for a<br/>
caster at bringing down a hill giant just doesn&#39;t sit right with me. That is<br/>
like saying that a sword is no match for a gun. It depends on how you use<br/>
it. Sure you could stand across the room and shoot me 6 times before I even<br/>
got near you, but in the same sense I could creep up on you and cut your<br/>
hand off before you even drew that precious gun of yours. So in terms of<br/>
damage, yes maybe some of the casters spells should have more of an effect<br/>
on some creatures. But it all depends on where we, as warriors, stick our<br/>
swords. If the giant is 20&#39; taller than me...chances are I am about 200%<br/>
faster than him. I just have to know where to hit him to take him out.<br/>
<br/>
    Personal Note. I am only going this route because I have studied<br/>
Kinjitsu (Japanese swordfighting) and Karate for some time now, and I know<br/>
that no matter how big an opponent is he can be taken down. I don&#39;t care if<br/>
he is literally as big as a house....if his tendons get cut, he falls like<br/>
any man one-tenth his size. But remember this is just my opinion, I am not<br/>
trying to flame anyone or any point of view. In fact I think this is very<br/>
healthy to the development of the game. No one ever succeeded at anything<br/>
with everyone telling them that they are right all the time. Am I right?<br/>
(Sorry...bad pun hehe)<br/>
