&gt; Why would you want the price of the item to go down?  The economy in EQ is<br/>
&gt; being blown by people who &quot;farm&quot; equipment to sell for cheap prices just to<br/>
&gt; farther themselves a tiny amount.  IMO this sucks.  I remember when you<br/>

I&#39;m at level 19 and i have very little spare cash.  I do not die very<br/>
often and do not understand how people can flaunt 200pp for items when<br/>
i&#39;ve never even seen that much money before. My guess is that the people<br/>
who have all this money either have no lives, playing all day long, dying<br/>
a lot, and camping item spots to pay for other item spots. All this<br/>
inflation is bullshit and once we start, as a group, helping one another<br/>
out, it will all phase down.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>SBH spawns about every 2 or 2 and a half hours on the Shralok there, and<br/>
as long as you have a high level wizard or two in your group, you can<br/>
outgun the people. Is that worth 125pp or whatever it&#39;s going for? I&#39;m<br/>
sorry, but i can&#39;t make 125pp in 2 and a half hours. Nor can i make 125pp<br/>
in a week. I&#39;ve never made that much money, so i don&#39;t know how long it<br/>
would take.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; tried to get a BBC for about a month before I gave up because of campers and<br/>
&gt; kill stealers.  Hard to express the anger you feel when you sit killing and<br/>
&gt; waiting for 3 plus hours only to have another group move in and steal the<br/>
&gt; kill to gain what you have been patiently waiting for.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Shadowknight that spawns with the BBC spawns every 30 minutes and<br/>
everyone has to be in the main room to avoid the anticamp. If there is a<br/>
group there doing it wrong, explain it to them, and if you do it right,<br/>
they will be gone in half an hour with a BBC in their possesion and you<br/>
can wait your half an hour to get one too. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Im off the track here.  The point is, why drive the cost of something down?<br/>
&gt; You should want to keep the items worth something until the majority of<br/>
&gt; people in the game can get them for themselves.  Otherwise you will see lvl<br/>
&gt; 3 and 4 characters running around with weapons that are level 15 or 20.  And<br/>
&gt; they only paid 4plat for it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And this is exactly my point. I, at level 19, can get a majority of the<br/>
good weapons in the game with a good party if given the chance. Everyone<br/>
would get a chance if we figured out the system for these items. The price<br/>
should not be for the people who spend 24 hours a day, 7 days a week<br/>
playing. It should be something that the people who only have a couple<br/>
hours a day to play can attain too. <br/>
<br/>
My opinion.<br/>
