Warriors Suck....<br/>
<br/>
...but not for the reasons you may think.  Warriors have their place in<br/>
Everquest, but I do not play one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How to play a Warrior:<br/>
1.  Hot key Kick/Bash<br/>
Everyone should know about this one.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Hot key Assist<br/>
It is so important for everyone to attack the same monster.  Eliminating a<br/>
damage source helps so much.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Hot key Taunt<br/>
This is vitally important for getting monsters off of spellcasters or other<br/>
weakened tanks.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about all there is to playing a Warrior.  Once you master Taunt and<br/>
Assist you have become the best Warrior you will be.  Battles are about<br/>
targeting the correct opponent (targeting spellcasters first, using<br/>
/assist...) and keeping critters off the spellcasters (Taunt).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to be a better player than that.  I want to be able to do something<br/>
that saves the entire party.  I want people to remember me and want my<br/>
skills in the group.  As a Warrior, I can be known as a great Taunter, one<br/>
who keeps the spellcasters free to cast.  That&#39;s about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I play a Cleric mainly now.  Every battle consists of many decisions that<br/>
may affect the outcome.<br/>
<br/>
The first decision happens when the puller returns.  Did he bring too many?<br/>
Should I Root one?  Or should I Fear one of the critters away?  Is it<br/>
important for me to start casting Direct Damage (on a spellcaster for<br/>
example) or should I conserve mana for Heals?<br/>
<br/>
Next I will normally assist one of the tanks for a few rounds.  It is my job<br/>
to monitor everyone&#39;s HP and heal them up when needed.  If I heal too much<br/>
too soon, I will draw all the critters onto me.  So I must carefully judge<br/>
when and how much to heal.  There is also a choice of who to heal.  Should I<br/>
heal Tank-A who is it half health but only has one critter on him, or should<br/>
I heal Tank-B who is at three-quarters health but has three critters on him?<br/>
Maybe I should wait a few rounds or do I need to heal right now?<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I have used some mana, I have another choice.  Should I meditate<br/>
right away or should I continue swinging my staff?  Will I need mana for an<br/>
extra heal or should I do some immediate damage with combat?<br/>
<br/>
Then I have to deal with runners.  Should I Root a runner so a tank can<br/>
finish him off or do I need to finish him myself with Direct Damage?  Can I<br/>
afford the mana for this or should I chase the runner down myself to finish<br/>
him off with combat?<br/>
<br/>
Also I must decide when to tank.  Clerics can wear good armor and have<br/>
decent HPs.  I might need to tank a few rounds to save a Wizard or give a<br/>
Warrior a break.<br/>
<br/>
After a big battle where I made several important decisions that saved the<br/>
day for us I realize how important those choices I had to make were.  Having<br/>
learned to be an effective Cleric made a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
Then I think about it from the Warriors point of view.  The Warrior did<br/>
Kick, Kick, Kick, Taunt, Kick, Kick, Kick, Taunt, the cleric is getting<br/>
attacked, switch targets, Kick, Kick, Kick, Taunt, Kick, Kick, Kick, Taunt,<br/>
runner rooted by cleric, chase runner down, switch targets, Kick, Kick,<br/>
Kick, Taunt.<br/>
<br/>
Playing a Warrior doesn&#39;t compare to a Cleric.  As a Warrior, I feel so<br/>
useless.  If the battle is going bad, there is nothing I can do but hope the<br/>
Random Number Generator starts falling our way.  All I can do is soak up<br/>
damage like a sponge, do more combat damage than everyone else and Taunt<br/>
critters off the spellcasters.<br/>
<br/>
A Warrior can learn everything there is to know about his class in one day.<br/>
Gaining new levels never changes the strategy a Warrior.  Sure they get dual<br/>
wield and double attack, but this only increased damage and does nothing to<br/>
add new combat choices.<br/>
<br/>
A Cleric takes a long time to master.  I feel there is much more for me to<br/>
learn as a Cleric.  And every 5 levels I get a new set of spells that need<br/>
to learn to use.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be learning new tricks all the way up to<br/>
level 50 (if I ever get that far).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t misunderstand me.  Tanks are a very needed part of a party.<br/>
Spellcasters need Warriors up front to take the blows and deal out the<br/>
damage.  Warriors are just not my style.  The limited options during combat<br/>
are not what I am looking for.  For many of you, the Warrior is perfect.<br/>
Being able to stand toe to toe with a critter and doing damage with a sword<br/>
is exactly what many people want.<br/>
<br/>
Verant&#39;s improvements:<br/>
Bezerker Frenzy - happens automatically when low on HP<br/>
More HPs - Lets us take more damage<br/>
More Magic Resistance - Better against spellcasters<br/>
Critical Hits - Randomly more damage<br/>
<br/>
These improvements do make Warriors a better class.  But nothing there makes<br/>
me want to play them.  I would consider playing a Warrior if there were more<br/>
active skills.  I need a skill that I can choose when to use it, so that it<br/>
may make a difference in combat.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve suggested in the past a Battle Cry skill.  This skill, usable once per<br/>
day, would increase the AC and Attack Speed of everyone in the party for 30<br/>
seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Another option would be Fighting Styles.  Give us an Offensive fighting<br/>
style.  This would increase damage or Attacking plus a taunt bonus while<br/>
sacrificing AC and Defense.  And we would also want a Defensive fighting<br/>
style.  This would boost AC, dodge, and defense with a sacrifice to<br/>
Attacking and damage.  It would be very cool if these Fighting Styles could<br/>
only be learned through a quest designed for around levels 15-20.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Give Warriors something to think about in combat.  Make it so that<br/>
experienced, skillful Warrior can be better than any newbie Warrior.  Give<br/>
them some abilities that would take skill to use effectively.  Knowing when<br/>
to switch Fighting Styles or use Battle Cry would be something an<br/>
experienced Warrior could learn to do well.<br/>
