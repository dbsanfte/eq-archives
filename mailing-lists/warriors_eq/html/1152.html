<div id="ygrps-yiv-564148568">Depends on the size of the fireball now doesn&#39;t it?  Could be that fireball<br/>
is about as annoying to the giant as a bic lighter!  And think of this, how<br/>
much damage can a pen knife do to you?  Think you could be killed by one?<br/>
<br/>
Now, we can look at EQ as a fantasy setting, or we can make it realistic.<br/>
If you want absolute realism, then yes, there is now way a single man with a<br/>
sword would be likely to kill a giant.  In fact, to use your argument,<br/>
giants should be killing everyone with just on stomp, period.  Not the 2 or<br/>
three it takes to kill me.  We would also have to do away with that romantic<br/>
image of the Knight in shining armor slaying the Dragon with a single blow<br/>
from his sword or lance.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to agree that they should probably  have damage modifiers for HUGE<br/>
mobs that would reduce the base damage inflicted.  These should be applied<br/>
to both physical weapons and spells though.  Let&#39;s assume that base damage<br/>
is against med to large creatures.  Of course, the reverse should hold true,<br/>
that smaller creature would receive more damage (all those elves, hobbits,<br/>
gnomes and dwarves beware!).  This would make dragons and giants even<br/>
tougher then they are now, while making the combat with creatures of similar<br/>
size more realistic.  I&#39;ve seen what a broad sward can do, And like I said,<br/>
whether your head is cut off or you&#39;re reduced to ashes, your just as dead.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; This arguement still doesn&#39;t make sense to me in a realm <br/>
&gt; where some of the<br/>
&gt; opponents are taller than houses.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t care how big your axe is, you aren&#39;t going to be able <br/>
&gt; to do the<br/>
&gt; damage that a caster can to some creatures, like a hill giant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You argument just doesn&#39;t make sense when you apply it to the <br/>
&gt; setting in EQ.<br/>
&gt; Sure I can hack someone&#39;s head off in a single swipe and a <br/>
&gt; mage could blast<br/>
&gt; them to ashes. However, that same sword swipe will be nothing <br/>
&gt; more than an<br/>
&gt; annoyance to a giant, where that same fireball from the mage will do<br/>
&gt; devastating damage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Making the warrior a huge damage dealing machine was never <br/>
&gt; the intent of<br/>
&gt; Verant and isn&#39;t in the spirit of EQ&#39;s balanced group oriented world.<br/>
&gt; Verant needs to allow us to have an advantage of the other <br/>
&gt; melee/caster<br/>
&gt; hybrids is the main point of our discussion I think.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Sorry, that last email was just too hard to read!!!  Here it <br/>
&gt; is again in<br/>
&gt; &gt;plain text!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I think the difference between melee combatants and casters <br/>
&gt; magic should be<br/>
&gt; &gt;thus:  Melee fighters should be able to do just as much <br/>
&gt; damage, if not<br/>
&gt; more,<br/>
&gt; &gt;whereas a caster may strike from a distance, and strike <br/>
&gt; multiple targets<br/>
&gt; &gt;with area effect spells.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am the president of a national group that fights with live <br/>
&gt; steel weapons.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve been fighting with long swords, 2-handed swords, axes <br/>
&gt; and maces for 10<br/>
&gt; &gt;years, and I am very comfortable with just how devastating <br/>
&gt; these weapons<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt;be.  No matter if you are struck by lightning or are cut in <br/>
&gt; 2 by a large<br/>
&gt; &gt;axe, you are just as dead!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So perhaps the direction we need to seek, and the difference <br/>
&gt; between these<br/>
&gt; 2<br/>
&gt; &gt;types of characters. melee and caster, is not how much <br/>
&gt; damage they do, but<br/>
&gt; &gt;how.  A caster should be able to reach far away, and strike multiple<br/>
&gt; &gt;targets, while the great warrior should only be able to strike at one<br/>
&gt; target<br/>
&gt; &gt;at a time, but be able to mow them down like wheat.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Oh, and if anyone is interested in an organization that <br/>
&gt; allow you to wear<br/>
&gt; &gt;armor and swing a real blade ( and trust me, it will give <br/>
&gt; you a whole new<br/>
&gt; &gt;perspective on your RPGing!) check out our website!<br/>
