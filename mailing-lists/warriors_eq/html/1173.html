<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829757835">Your points are well taken. But consider this:<br/>
<br/>
It *is* a fantasy setting. Or we wouldn&#39;t be running around fighting ghouls<br/>
with magic swords you know?  A single sword swipe would end our lives and<br/>
there would be no *respawn*<br/>
<br/>
A mage will do more damage to a giant in a shorter amount of time due to the<br/>
economies of scale.  Imagine what the skin on a creature the size of a hill<br/>
giant must be like.  It has to contain literally tons of internal organs and<br/>
fluids. That means that it is going to be significantly stronger than human<br/>
flesh.  Probably more like a heavy leather, much like an elephant.<br/>
Therefore your sword slashing simply isn&#39;t going to be as effective, and you<br/>
won&#39;t be deftly slashing through tendons and throats and disabling your<br/>
opponent in 20 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, back to fantasy setting now.  We aren&#39;t using katanas in EQ.  The<br/>
weapons of a warrior are not precision weapons.  A 2 handed sword is<br/>
designed for a heavy over the shoulder strike.  A blow to an unarmored<br/>
opponent (in reality) is fatal. But it isn&#39;t for slashing tendons.  A<br/>
longsword is a slashing weapon, but it is a bit unwieldy for precision<br/>
strikes.  Forget about real uses of real weapons though, this is fantasy<br/>
remember?  You can imagine what you will, but in EQ there are rules of the<br/>
world, so you won&#39;t be running up a giant&#39;s back and sticking your sword in<br/>
his eye.  I don&#39;t know a game that will let you do that. &quot;Thief&quot; comes close<br/>
but still isn&#39;t what you are talking about.<br/>
<br/>
The warrior is a hack&#39;n&#39;slash &quot;Conan&quot; type.  We aren&#39;t knights...those are<br/>
paladins in this game.  We aren&#39;t ninjas, samurai or any other sword<br/>
wielding supermen.  We stand toe to toe with our opponents and trade blows.<br/>
If we are faster, stronger, more skilled we win.  If we are not, we lose.<br/>
Some things are just so big and hit so hard, that we can&#39;t possibly melee<br/>
with them until we are so skilled the creature offers no experience.<br/>
<br/>
The warrior excels in a full party with a cleric.  Try it and you will see.<br/>
3 and 4 person parties aren&#39;t the same, because you will often be the<br/>
primary target of high level mobs and take alot of damage.  But a full party<br/>
with 2 warriors and 1 cleric plus other assorted baggage is a group that can<br/>
take much higher level mobs without losing members.<br/>
<br/>
I said before the EQ is about grouping and balance.  Warriors deal alot of<br/>
damage slowly and consistently.  In the same time warriors absorb alot of<br/>
attacks.  Remember when mages get hit in melee they always take damage,<br/>
while warriors are dodging and parrying. If a mage loses his tank, he is<br/>
most likely dead. He won&#39;t be able to cast his high damage spells because<br/>
they take to long to cast, he will have to resort to small damage attacks<br/>
because they cast faster and won&#39;t get interrupted.<br/>
<br/>
Every class has advantages and disadvantages. The warrior class is just<br/>
lacking in unique advantages.  We get all the really good combat skills many<br/>
levels ahead of all the hybrids.  We just need something to set us apart in<br/>
melee.  I will reiterate that a critical hit skill is the most likely way to<br/>
do this.<br/>
<br/>
Verant will never give warriors and kind of consistent massive damage<br/>
inducing ability.  But I think the critical hit solution will satisfy your<br/>
belief that you should be able to quickly slash a tendon and do heavy<br/>
damage.  You just aren&#39;t going to be able to do it every round, or count on<br/>
its success.</div>
