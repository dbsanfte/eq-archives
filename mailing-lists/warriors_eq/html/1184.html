&gt;&gt; The warrior excels in a full party with a cleric. <br/>
&gt;&gt; Try it and you will see. 3 and 4 person parties<br/>
&gt;&gt; aren&#39;t the same, because you will often be the<br/>
&gt;&gt; primary target of high level mobs and take alot of<br/>
&gt;&gt; damage.  But a full party with 2 warriors and 1<br/>
&gt;&gt; cleric plus other assorted baggage is a group that<br/>
&gt;&gt; can take much higher level mobs without losing<br/>
&gt;&gt; members.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Right on the money; here&#39;s a very graphic example of<br/>
&gt;this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In Unrest, grouped (16s-19s) with three tanks, two<br/>
&gt;clerics and a wizard, we cleaned up *anything* we<br/>
&gt;could pull from the first two floors of the house (up<br/>
&gt;to and including Carrion Ghouls and Skeleton Monks,<br/>
&gt;and the occasional Barbed Bone Skeleton - all red to<br/>
&gt;all of us).  Grouped (16s-19s) with only 1 tank (me),<br/>
&gt;two clerics, two wizards and one shaman, we could<br/>
&gt;*not* take Skeleton Monks or Barbed Bone Skeletons<br/>
&gt;because the Wizards were dead weight then (resists),<br/>
&gt;the Clerics didn&#39;t have enough healing to keep me up,<br/>
&gt;and I didn&#39;t have the firepower alone to take them<br/>
&gt;down before everyone was OOM and it was still at half<br/>
&gt;life, laughing at us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Those who think they can hunt without tanks are right,<br/>
&gt;if they&#39;re willing to *only* hunt blues and whites. <br/>
&gt;If they want to hunt &#39;up level&#39; from themselves, in<br/>
&gt;yellows and reds, they have to have tanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My prefered party always has three tanks, period.  My<br/>
&gt;most fun ripping and shredding party would be four<br/>
&gt;tanks and two clerics (but my friend&#39;s a wizard, and I<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t just throw him away like that).  But with three<br/>
&gt;tanks and a pair of clerics, you can use the 6th slot<br/>
&gt;as a wildcard to fill with a bard or wizard or<br/>
&gt;whatever.  Enchanters go especially well, their<br/>
&gt;debuffs make fights a lot easier.<br/>
