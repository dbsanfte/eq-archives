<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000826919">Ok, I am new to the warrior list, though I have been raising a stink over on <br/>
the Vault&#39;s boards about warriors. I believe there are some issues that need <br/>
to be discussed. I also believe that petitioning for changes with out a <br/>
dialog is not going to be successful.<br/>
<br/>
First some technical thoughts. We all have seen that skills go from 0-255, <br/>
which equals one byte. I believe that raising the skill cap would be a <br/>
non-trivial task on Verant&#39;s park, requiring a write (or at least a <br/>
recompile) and altering all the player records on all the servers. I would <br/>
think they are doing this for the expansion pack, since the level limits are <br/>
supposed to be increased from 50 to a rumored 75 or 100.<br/>
<br/>
I also think I know why they capped combat skills where they did. I have <br/>
noticed that my attack skill was at 510 at 21st level. At a guess (and if <br/>
someone could confirm this I would appreciate it) that Attack caps at 999 or <br/>
1000. Again there may be technical issues that prevent that from being <br/>
easily changed. I predict that there will be some MAJOR server upgrades (and <br/>
probably associated down time) before the expansion pack comes out.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who did not see this on EQVault, this is supposedly an <br/>
email that Brad sent on warriors:<br/>
<br/>
********************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Recently I e-mailed Brad McQuaid about the Warrior class. I asked him if he <br/>
was listening to everyone about the warrior class, whether or not they were <br/>
going to make changes to it, and what he thought were their strengths and <br/>
weaknesses. This is what he had to say:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I personally feel warriors are in good shape, but we&#39;ve been thinking about <br/>
adding weapon specialization, probably a warrior-only skill. It will take us <br/>
some time to get that implemented and there are some things we need to <br/>
finish first that have higher priority.<br/>
<br/>
Do keep in mind these tidbits about the warrior that not everyone is aware <br/>
of:<br/>
<br/>
1. They get more hit points than anyone else<br/>
2. They have access to more weapons than anyone else<br/>
3. They have more freedom to wear items than anyone else<br/>
4. They have more special class-only weapons and items than anyone else<br/>
5. They have higher skill caps than anyone else.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*********************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Now I have debated the merits of the warrior abilities and advantages <br/>
endlessly and think we all know that these boil down to a fair plain <br/>
character class. A couple of comment from me (and any comments from you all <br/>
would be appreciated).<br/>
<br/>
The ability to wear more times seem to be the saving grace over rangers for <br/>
warriors before rubicite is available. I have an AC around 470 with mostly <br/>
bronze armor. For now rangers cant compete with that.<br/>
<br/>
I am now 22nd level and I have yet to get my first &quot;special class-only&quot; <br/>
weapon or item. Nor has a 26th level warrior friend of mine and we have <br/>
fairly good connections. If there are more warrior only items I would love <br/>
to see and better yet get them. (Brings up a question: are there any good <br/>
warrior web sites out there?)<br/>
<br/>
As to the skill caps I have only just now started to look at these in the <br/>
bigger sense of what effect they have on attack. I can tell you this, I <br/>
compared my self at 21st (barbarian warrior) to a 21st level wood elf ranger <br/>
and I had an attack that was 45 points higher (510 VS 465). I wonder how <br/>
much of our feeling that we are not masters of combat comes from the fact <br/>
that the default setting for battle messages. We see our misses but not <br/>
others. We only see their hits.<br/>
<br/>
And a thought about battle spam. In a six partly group with 2 or more tanks <br/>
it is just about impossible to tell how you are doing. What do you think of <br/>
having the text color for your battle messages being a different color? Say <br/>
purple or something.<br/>
