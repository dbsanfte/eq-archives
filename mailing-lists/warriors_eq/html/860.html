<div id="ygrps-yiv-354327762">I don&#39;t know if you all do something like this already or not, but I&#39;ll give <br/>
it a shot.  What I, in my callow youth, have discovered, is that when I am <br/>
without a healer and I take a fletching kit and arrow components along to <br/>
make arrows while I sit to heal, I don&#39;t mind the waiting as much.  You may <br/>
be wealthy enough to afford arrows from the store, but I prefer the lovingly <br/>
handcrafted and economical arrows of my own making.  Just thought you might <br/>
be interested in my solitary original tidbit.<br/>
