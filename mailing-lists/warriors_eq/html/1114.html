I wouldn&#39;t make a bow, unless you&#39;re going to fletch<br/>
your skill up into the 70s-80s; the bow you can make<br/>
at sub40s would be a Hickory bow, and it has *nothing*<br/>
on the Elm bows at the next level.  It&#39;s very<br/>
inexpensive to buy an Elm bow from another fletcher,<br/>
should cost you 5-6pp.  Pick Hemp string for more<br/>
damage, Silk string for more speed (lower delay);<br/>
efficiency ratios for either work out the same.<br/>
<br/>
The best way I found to work archery up is to hang out<br/>
where other groups are fighting mobs that&#39;re blue+ to<br/>
you; and shoot into their fights.  I&#39;ve never had<br/>
anyone mind; there&#39;s no way an archer will killsteal<br/>
like this, and it helps make the fight easier for the<br/>
group tanking it.<br/>
<br/>
Pulling is much easier with a bow, let me tell you.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
