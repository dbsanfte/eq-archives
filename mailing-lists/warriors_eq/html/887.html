<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-110794636">OK the third piece is found on the Commander (Commander Wynd or something).<br/>
RARE spawn maybe MAYBE once a week.  He spawns near the throne room.  He<br/>
carries the final piece that allows you to combine and you DO not get the<br/>
blued hammer, you get some mallet, which is one damage/delay less than the<br/>
summoned hammer but is +10 to magic resistance.<br/>
<br/>
We took him down with a full party of level 20&#39;s.  Sapped all the healers<br/>
and casters mana and our paladin had to use LOH.  We won in the end but both<br/>
our wizards died.  I would say his 25 to 28th level, only because he<br/>
resisted the wizards spells about 40% of the time.<br/>
