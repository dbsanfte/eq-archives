<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455615188">Yes thers no difference now, but the differences wont kick in until higher<br/>
levels.  At level 50 I believe a warrior could wipe the floor with a ranger,<br/>
especially a warrior who has some fast weapons for high interrupts or a big<br/>
bash/slam skill.<br/>
<br/>
The difference is not evident until much higher levels.<br/>
<br/>
Also, how many wood elf rangers are there? 100? 200? 400? there as common as<br/>
dirt, and I bet you now a wizard would MUCH prefer a warrior to a ranger as<br/>
a partner.  Warriors are MUCH more valuable to a party than a ranger in a<br/>
dungeon for example.<br/>
<br/>
Also Faydar is a whole, and Faydark is the worst of the worst places on<br/>
norrath. My suggestion is play the class that suites your personality,<br/>
otherwise you will get bored.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; This past week I decided to take a break from my level 15 dark elf<br/>
&gt; warrior.� I was abit frustrated.<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; I started a half-elf warrior in Kelethin.� It is insanely easy to play<br/>
&gt; there.� I made level 5 in about 3.5 hours.� Then I stopped and tried a<br/>
&gt; wood elf ranger.� Has anyone else played a ranger?� I imagine it is the<br/>
&gt; most poorly balanced of all the hybrids.� After 4 hours I reached level 5<br/>
&gt; and got kick.� I am now 12-18 hours into the character and almost level<br/>
&gt; 9.� I am just as capable as an equivalent warrior.� Next level I gain an<br/>
&gt; array of spells which will boost my combat effectiveness and allow me to<br/>
&gt; heal.� Part of the easy success is the plethora of low level orcs<br/>
&gt; available a stone&#39;s throw from Kelethin.� With my tracking ability I am<br/>
&gt; never at a loss for targets and I can engage blue con orcs in rapid<br/>
&gt; succession or even 2 at a time. I can even engage and successfully beat<br/>
&gt; yellow con orcs more than 50% of the time and almost always can kill orcs<br/>
&gt; that con even to me without trouble. So far it seems that I get as many<br/>
&gt; hit points now as my warrior did.<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; My point is, with a ranger class as powerful a combatant as it is I see<br/>
&gt; little necessity for the pure warrior.� I am going to play through to<br/>
&gt; level 15 I think, just to see a more even comparison.� My concern is only<br/>
&gt; from a game mechanics perspective though as I have no doubt my playing as<br/>
&gt; a dark elf was a much more rewarding experience.� Has anyone else noticed<br/>
&gt; that the warrior just is not different enough from the hybrid fighter<br/>
&gt; classes?<br/>
