<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963698408">My solution for these magical items is to have them given out<br/>
only as a reward for a certain quest.  Of couse that means the<br/>
quests would have to be very difficult and actually work :)  When<br/>
I was designing an RPG along, long, long time ago, my co-designer<br/>
and myself came up with a way to make sure that someone didn&#39;t<br/>
complete the quest twice.  There is a boolean flag for each quest<br/>
attached to the character with a true or false vale.  The true meant<br/>
that you completed the quest.  After you completed the quest then<br/>
you were flagged and couldn&#39;t get the item again.  But what if you<br/>
wanted to get one for a friend?  Well this could be accomplished in<br/>
EQ with the party leader.  Whoever was the inviter would be <br/>
considered the party leader and would get the item upon succesful<br/>
completion of the quest.  Then your friend would invite and become<br/>
the party leader and could do the quest again, getting the same <br/>
item.  There could be alot more checks added to see if the quest <br/>
was in progress, how many characters in the party has the same <br/>
quest in progress, etc, etc.  Killing something to get a great <br/>
weapon just doesn&#39;t seem appropriate.  <br/>

&gt; YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s what we need! A random item spawn.....I&#39;ll even take it one step<br/>
&gt; further:<br/>
&gt; Lets say that said sword is on a level 45 person...so we&#39;ll call that a<br/>
&gt; &#39;level 45 item&#39; it can then spawn to any level 45+ NPC in all of the zone,<br/>
&gt; or even norrath. That would make people have to travel A LOT to find items<br/>
&gt; they want, and would completely prevent camping for items altogether. That<br/>
&gt; way if you really wanted an item bad enough, your group had to go search<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; it...not just sit sround and wait for it....that to me is not even<br/>
&gt; role-playing.<br/>
&gt; Just my 2 cents.<br/>
