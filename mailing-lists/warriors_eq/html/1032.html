<div id="ygrps-yiv-225653781">Whole heartedly agree.  I role-play everytime I pull my sword out.<br/>
Everytime I save the wizards ass.  Everytime I zone with 1 hp (that WAS<br/>
close).<br/>
<br/>
Wizards ..pfft ... no honour there, what honour is there in killing from<br/>
afar?  I like to see my opponents scowling, angry, pitiful face.  I like to<br/>
see the hypnotic dance of my scimitars or the angry hurricane that is the<br/>
Bone Bladed Claymore.<br/>

&gt;   There is nothing better than life as a barbarian warrior in Norrath! In <br/>
&gt; previous lives I have been a Paladin, a Wizard, and a Monk (not here in <br/>
&gt; Norrath, but another world/MUD).  There is no better way to experience the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; world that is Norrath than as a warrior deep in the heart of battle.  I<br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; no need to role-play, as I live my role every time my group goes out on a <br/>
&gt; hunt.  With 500+ hitpoints, two long swords (one combine, the other fine <br/>
&gt; steel), and no fear of death, I can think of no better true killing<br/>
&gt; machine <br/>
&gt; on the battlefield.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Sure magic users have powerful magic spells that cause a great deal of <br/>
&gt; damage in one shot, but it is warrior that must maintain the fight while<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; magic users rest to regain mana or run like frightened rabbits to zone<br/>
&gt; when <br/>
&gt; they get hit a couple of times.  A good fight for me is my group geting <br/>
&gt; jumped by five of six MoBs, each capable of killing any one of the magic <br/>
&gt; users with ease.  I wade into the front and just start hacking and<br/>
&gt; taunting <br/>
&gt; until everything is dead in front of me.  Oh sure, I might be down to 5<br/>
&gt; hit <br/>
&gt; points (yes it happens), but the group will always remain alive.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   One day I will lead the attack on that silly dragon camped in Sol B.  No<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; other class can truly call themselves a tank, and no other class would be <br/>
&gt; stupid enough to led an attack on the dragon and expect to live.<br/>

&gt; OOC: I played most classes/races during beta and finally selected a <br/>
&gt; barbarian warrior.  Role-playing is the best part of this game.  While <br/>
&gt; on-line and waiting for something to happen I usually never stay in one <br/>
&gt; place and I am always talking, waiting for something to happen.  Drives my<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; group crazy, but they view me as a blood crazy Amazon and expect me to <br/>
&gt; thirst for death and battle.<br/>
