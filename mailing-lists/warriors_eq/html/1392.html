<div id="ygrps-yiv-355449447">At a guess I would say it is gargoly island in the Ocean of Tears (with a <br/>
high enough group). I am not sure which one that is as I have only seen <br/>
comments about it, but it is not one the boat stops at.<br/>
<br/>
Then again I have made about 60 plat in 2 nights in Perma... travel see the <br/>
world, get by with a shiny brass halbred.<br/>
