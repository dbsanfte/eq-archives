<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493254902">Ok one horror story and one honor story.  First the bad news:<br/>
<br/>
There we were... camping the Undead ruin in East Commons - why we have no<br/>
clue (no loot and no xp either.)  Then the 2 ghouls spawn so we ooc for some<br/>
help and a dwarvin pallidin or maybe cleric joins the party.  We melee the<br/>
ghouls and in the midst of combat this pallidin/cleric loots the first<br/>
ghoul.  We kill the second one and the cleric immediately says &quot;got to go&quot;<br/>
and disbands.  Not 5 minutes later he is auctioning off a bronze sword.  I<br/>
give him a tell and he confirms it was off the ghoul.  Talk about an a-hole.<br/>
His name is &quot;gander&quot; and it was on the Innoruuk server.  If a hill giant is<br/>
ever chasing you, be sure to run right up to &#39;gander&#39; and ask for a heal.<br/>
<br/>
Now the good part:<br/>
<br/>
There we were... formed a party and we head off to camp the dervs in North<br/>
Ro.  When we get the camp by the mountains, we see another group working it.<br/>
So, we ask them if we can have a turn and wait for our turn.  Things are<br/>
working good each crew taking turns and actually glad for the rest and heal<br/>
time between turns.  So then the other group leaves for food and drink and<br/>
to sell stuff.  Turns out there was another guy hanging out there and he is<br/>
like a 15 or so cleric (we are 10&#39;s and 12&#39;s warrior, bard and pallie.)  He<br/>
asks us if he can help by lulling so we can pull dervs out one by one.  Wow!<br/>
Sure thing!  So he does and casts heals and such as we need it.  We take<br/>
some turns with him but mostly he says he just wants to help us.  So this<br/>
goes on for long enough for us to fill loots 2 times and run to sell and<br/>
come back.<br/>
<br/>
Finally he says he has to go help his guild mate and we work the camp for a<br/>
while.  Eventually, we get a 3 spawn and they all con yellow to our highest<br/>
party member.  So we give our friend a tell and he is kind enough to come<br/>
back and help us!  <br/>
<br/>
So for all the bad times you have in Norrath - hang in there because you are<br/>
bound to hit some good times as well!  This guy&#39;s name was Badin and he is a<br/>
member of the Legends guild.  And he truly makes them Legendary!<br/>

		Want to here REALLY rude?<br/>
<br/>
		On the weekend someone in West Commons decided to kill a<br/>
hill giant, so he<br/>
		or she KITIE&#39;d the hill giant around the zone border.  I<br/>
have no idea how<br/>
		many people it killed, it defiantly killed everyone who was<br/>
at the Orc camp.<br/>
		My partner and I managed to dodge the giant 3 times, he got<br/>
us on the 4th<br/>
		circuit.<br/>
<br/>
		Thats just rude, you dont KITE something like a giant,<br/>
especially when it<br/>
		resides in a low level zone.  I dont mind dieing because of<br/>
a fight that I<br/>
		started, but to be kited is just frustrating.<br/>
