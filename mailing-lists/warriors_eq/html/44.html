<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920416974">I am a wood elven fighter and I was wondering how much a full suit of <br/>
blackened armor weighs, as I can only hold 85 lbs. without penalty.  Would I <br/>
be able to use the armor?  Also, I see a lot of people in different places, <br/>
does anyone hunt Feydwer that could give some advise on where to hunt to a <br/>
lvl 9?</div>
