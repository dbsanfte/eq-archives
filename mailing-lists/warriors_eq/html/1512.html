<div id="ygrps-yiv-761587772">Actually if you see the berzerker frenzy message it is too late to run then.<br/>
I really haven&#39;t noticed anything special about it, except that it raises<br/>
strength and lowers agility.  But thats it.  It takes experience to know<br/>
when to run.  As a general rule if I get below half a full bar of health and<br/>
the creature isn&#39;t close to the same (in a solo situation) then I will turn<br/>
and start running.  That leaves enough hit points to hopefully make it to a<br/>
safe spot.  Berzerker frenzy is like giving a caster 20 extra hit points<br/>
when they get down to 35% of health :)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; hey guys,,, need some advise with this.<br/>
&gt; I would like to know if I&#39;m using berzerker right.  From my experience it <br/>
&gt; only kicks in when my hp&#39;s are really low,, just before that point where I<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; need to run; however usually by the time it kicks in I am only a hit or<br/>
&gt; two <br/>
&gt; from the point where I can no longer run... well that is unless I am very,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; very close to a zone, which dosn&#39;t happen very often.  So the only<br/>
&gt; realistic <br/>
&gt; use I can think of is a reminder that I need to evaluate my situation and <br/>
&gt; think about getting out of there while I can, if possible.  My hits don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; seem to change much when I enter berzerker either, can&#39;t say that for the <br/>
&gt; mobs though.  They hit me twice as hard with almost every hit when they<br/>
&gt; get <br/>
&gt; down to one bubble, very annoying to loose one bubble of hp for most of<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; fight and then two bubbles while you are just finishing them off.  Hey, If<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; there is any stradegy to using it please let me know,,,,, I really want<br/>
&gt; to, <br/>
&gt; but can&#39;t figure out how......need every bit of help I can get  8)<br/>
