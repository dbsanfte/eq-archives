<div id="ygrps-yiv-915339718">Verant changed the level at which a warrior can train dual wield to level 13<br/>
about 2 weeks ago.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think they had published the information. As they did with most<br/>
other class changes.<br/>

&gt;I am Thuxtis the Mighty, a Gnome Warrior who recently arrived in Halas<br/>
&gt;for some cold weather adventuring with his guild.  After a lot of great<br/>
&gt;hunting, I returned to Halas to drop coin and loot, and decided to stop<br/>
&gt;at the Warrior guild to be sure that they would train him.  Thuxtis had<br/>
&gt;recently made 14th level and was eagery looking forward to the magical<br/>
&gt;15th.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So there I am at the guild (and yes they will train gnmoes), I just<br/>
&gt;happened to look down the list of skills to train and I see:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dual Wield<br/>
&gt;No Charge<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Huh? Thuxtis rubs his eyes and looks again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dual Wield<br/>
&gt;No Charge<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, You don&#39;t have to tell Thuxtis three times, so i reach up and<br/>
&gt;click on it, then press the practice button.  &quot;Your Skill in Dual Wield<br/>
&gt;has Gone up&quot;. Awesome... practice, practice, practice, practice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How did this little gem of a change slip through?  My friend Ramkota<br/>
&gt;informed me this morning that at 13th he could practice it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So the Moral of the story is for all you 13-14 level warriors (and it<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t hurt for the 12th to try as well), grab a SOW and RUN to the<br/>
&gt;nearest guild to grab this skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
