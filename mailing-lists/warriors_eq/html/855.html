&gt; This might have something to do with the patch this week so I am going<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is the fact.  My Fine steel 2 handed sword has a damage of 12 and<br/>
&gt; delay of 43.  I normally hit for 21 damage with it.  2 days ago I<br/>
&gt; bought a purity belt boosting my str from 80 to 82.  I did not notice<br/>
&gt; any damage change.  Last night within minutes of levelling up to 10 I<br/>
&gt; started hitting for max damage of 25.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any one know anything about this?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interesting, but I think your base assumption might be wrong.  The two <br/>
weapons I use had a base damage of 8 and 6. (Mino axe, and tomahawk).<br/>
I had a max damage of 17 and 13 (2xbase + 1) on each respectively.<br/>
If you are hitting for 25, I would think this fits right in line<br/>
with the 2xbase +1 formula.<br/>
<br/>
I am more curious as to why you weren&#39;t hitting for max potential<br/>
previously.  Were you burdened?  Perhaps at only 80 STR you had a<br/>
penalty?  Perhaps a bug was fixed and you now are hitting for the<br/>
correct damage.  The most likely thing though I can think of is<br/>
was your weapon skill for the 2H slash maxed for your level?  When<br/>
I&#39;ve been practicing recently, I almost never hit for max with my<br/>
2H slash, but it is significantly below max (like 20 out of 95).<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I&#39;m an 18th Barbarian warrior, STR of 120.  So perhaps the<br/>
comparison isn&#39;t quite fair.<br/>
