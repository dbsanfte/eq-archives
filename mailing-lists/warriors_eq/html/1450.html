<b>Subject:</b> Freeport Vendor Faction <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-322491607">I recently killedd a few human pcs in the Freeport arena and was wondering if there was anything i could do to raise faction with the Coalition of Trade Folk (freeport vendors) I am starting to run low on milk and haven&#39;t found anything that raises faction with the Trade Folk.  Any information would be much appreciated<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Jason</div>
