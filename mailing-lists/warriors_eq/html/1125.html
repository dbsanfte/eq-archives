<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147829589">James....I also am getting a little bored with my level 19 Barbarian Warrior.  One of the reasons, I guess, that I started the Bard.  I do think that Verant has overlooked us slightly.  When I played Realm, the warrior on there could buy mana and cast spells.  Agreed, they didn&#39;t work as well as the mages did, but we still could have the basics.  I would like to see Verant come up with another plan.  Perhaps some sort of magic skill, so at the very least, we could gate and cast healing on ourselves.  <br/>
