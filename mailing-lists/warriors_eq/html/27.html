<div id="ygrps-yiv-602382360">The Tenticle Whip is a nice low level magic weapon, but its far from being the best, just wait a few levels, hunt around in Najena for a while, then you&#39;ll find a really awsome 1h slash weapon.....the Barbed Leather Whip, damage 7 delay 27 :)<br/>

	Well i wouldnt go so far as to say its awesome for EXP....it has its<br/>
ups and downs, ups being places like the snake pits...which are good for exp<br/>
around level 9 or 10, but Bb also has THE WORST trains i have ever seen,<br/>
they can get pretty nasty at times. i guess im just used to Befallen, in my<br/>
opinion its the best dungeon to go to before you hit level 20 or so. After<br/>
that people should go check out Najena. you can get possibly the BEST 1h<br/>
slashing weapon i have seen there. The tentacle whip. Its speed is amazing<br/>
and damage is killer as well, pus its magical.<br/>
