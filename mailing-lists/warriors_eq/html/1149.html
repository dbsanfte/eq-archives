<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645580088">Sorry, that last email was just too hard to read!!!  Here it is again in<br/>
plain text!<br/>

I think the difference between melee combatants and casters magic should be<br/>
thus:  Melee fighters should be able to do just as much damage, if not more,<br/>
whereas a caster may strike from a distance, and strike multiple targets<br/>
with area effect spells.<br/>
 <br/>
I am the president of a national group that fights with live steel weapons.<br/>
I&#39;ve been fighting with long swords, 2-handed swords, axes and maces for 10<br/>
years, and I am very comfortable with just how devastating these weapons can<br/>
be.  No matter if you are struck by lightning or are cut in 2 by a large<br/>
axe, you are just as dead!<br/>
 <br/>
So perhaps the direction we need to seek, and the difference between these 2<br/>
types of characters. melee and caster, is not how much damage they do, but<br/>
how.  A caster should be able to reach far away, and strike multiple<br/>
targets, while the great warrior should only be able to strike at one target<br/>
at a time, but be able to mow them down like wheat.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and if anyone is interested in an organization that allow you to wear<br/>
armor and swing a real blade ( and trust me, it will give you a whole new<br/>
perspective on your RPGing!) check out our website!<br/>
