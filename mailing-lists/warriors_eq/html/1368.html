<b>Subject:</b> Brad on warriors <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-789229519">This is an excerpt from a post from EQ Vauly from Brad. It has not yet been <br/>
&quot;prooven&quot; do be Brads, but I have have no reason to doubt it, except for the <br/>
fact that it was posted very early for CA time.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the excerpt:<br/>
: Certain classes (warriors) were not at all thought out.<br/>
<br/>
You know, I&#39;m going to change my position on this, after some long <br/>
discussions with the GMs, my dev team, and after careful consideration of <br/>
the various emails and posts I&#39;ve read. There will be some significant <br/>
improvements made to warriors soon. But not well thought out? Hrm. As the <br/>
game progressed through beta and through release, we&#39;ve been tweaking and <br/>
balancing, and sometimes classes need to be re-balanced a bit. But I think <br/>
we always make a concerted effort to think things out.<br/>
<br/>
*****************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Funny I remember saying I thought may have been balance early in beta and <br/>
not looked at since :)<br/>
<br/>
It is in a thread called: As soon as I dump my stuff to my guildmemebers I <br/>
cancle my account (or something like that).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the news.<br/>
