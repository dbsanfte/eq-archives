  to make&nbsp;level 15 before getting dual wield and I remember the days when 
  no one wanted a warrior when there were other melee classes around.&nbsp; I&#39;ve 
  also played a ranger, SK, druid, necro and shaman.&nbsp; I can appreciate my 
  place in a group, I know how important a good tank is to a group&#39;s

  roughly), an EBW (7/21..boring but easy camp in Mistmore with a good group) or 
  if you can scrouge the bucks a Wurmslayer (25/40..5-6kpp).&nbsp; I&#39;m 
  unfamiliar with a great deal of Velious so I&#39;ll let others suggest weapons 
  from there.&nbsp; If you wish to outagro other tank classes you are going to 
  need to pursue dual wield as a way of life combined with a haste item of some

  (AC 7 &amp; 8 respectively &amp; cheap to obtain).&nbsp; Also from Mistmore 
  you may wish to try for an HBC (AC10) if you can get a strong group of mid 30s

  I&#39;ve also thought about the cougar claw earrings...I&#39;ll have to see what comes

      <div><font face="Arial" size="2">I am pretty comfortable in a group with my 
      warrior at level 36.&nbsp; I&#39;ve known my role in a group all along.&nbsp; 
      I started grouping almost exclusively at around level 15, though I can 
      still solo a bit if I pick my locations carefully. Currently I am doing 
      soloing in Lower Guk live side if I can&#39;t get a group.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
      really am trying to get in on Lord or Frenzy (Ha! good luck). My exec axe 
      is not as effective for me as it was at 30.&nbsp; Soloing it doesn&#39;t swing 
      often enough to do the damage fast enough.&nbsp; I think I am 
      underequipped in 1hs also using a enamelled black mace and a obsidian 
      scimitar.&nbsp; Perhaps its just because it seems everyone I group with 
      has better weapons then I do.</font></div>

        Re: [warriors_eq] Latest Patch</div>
        <div><br></div>Ok I have a couple of insights into this from a high 
        level warrior perspective:.<br><br>1) My warrior at 54 still tanks very 
        well with the 58/59 Pallies &amp; SKs I play with.&nbsp; The SK can 
        still outagro me but thats always been true.&nbsp; Its not even close 
        how much better I can take damage when I can actually draw agro.<br>2) 
        They didn&#39;t eliminate the the proc agro effect...they reduced it (right 
        in patch message). This impacted ALL classes &amp; not just warriors. To 
        be honest in 5 hours of Howling Stones last night Ididn&#39;t notice the 
        difference (i.e. with my Bloodpoint &amp; werewolf form I still saw 
        plenty of agro).<br>3) Warriors were only &quot;useless&quot; the first 6 months 
        of the games existence...I know I experienced it first hand (same armor, 
        weapons &amp; hps as everyone else with zero distinguishing skills) 
        .&nbsp; These days with decent warr specific armor &amp; weapons we tank 
        very well at most levels.<br>4) The idea that warriors don&#39;t contribute 
        significant offensive damage is an old idea.&nbsp; With the uber hps 
        high level MOBs the damage we contribute over time is quite 
        significant.<br>5) Raising the defensive caps for the other classes 
        actually makes them stronger in the groups I play in.&nbsp; That means 
        my groups survive more. I kind of like that.<br>6) The mid 30s-40s is a 
        tough spot for warriors.&nbsp; Mostly because the other tank classes 
        (Rangers/SKs in particular) have similar agro capability to ourselves at 
        this point but little experience in the value of their role in a 
        group.&nbsp; By the mid 40s very few Rangers, SKs &amp; Pallies are 
        actively trying wrest agro away from a warrior...at least if they have 
        any brains.<br><br>regards<br><br>Flair Shieldrender<br>54 Champion
