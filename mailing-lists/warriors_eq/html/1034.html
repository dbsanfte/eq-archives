<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930660528">Oh just to clarify the problem was solved - I have a buggy character, it<br/>
didn&#39;t show skill updates.  When I logged out then back in my 2hand slash<br/>
jumped (i.e. it was going up but didn&#39;t report it) from 1 to 23.  This is<br/>
true regarding the BBC at level 14 the max damage I can do is 29. This is<br/>
still better than a steel 2hand sword.  I also have no problem maxing my<br/>
2hand slash skill either with 75 int.<br/>

&gt; It is very unproductive to use higher levels weapons as a low level<br/>
&gt; character.  You will never be able to effectively (meaning use it at your<br/>
&gt; level of experience) use it until you attain the level at which you could<br/>
&gt; have possibly acquired the item.  This is some newer code implemented to<br/>
&gt; help reduce twinking.  You are just not skilled enough in the art to use<br/>
&gt; this powerful a weapon.  Do not get me wrong, you will be able to use it,<br/>
&gt; just not as well as you should be able to.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Same here....2 handed would not go up at all at low level.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; finally dumped<br/>
&gt; &gt; 10 points into it and it made a world of difference.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have heard that it is counter productive to be using high level magic<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapons at lower levels though.  Something about not being able to max<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapon skills at each level. Of course I haven&#39;t confirmed this.....but<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have read it at least twice on 2 mail lists.<br/>
