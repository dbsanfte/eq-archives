<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542765861">My max damage since obtaining the sword was 21.  I have never hit for more<br/>
than that even with my skill maxxed.  I max all my weapons skills at every<br/>
level so far.  Within minutes of reaching level 10 I started hitting for 25.<br/>
I am not complaining of course.   However, if this is a damage bonus based<br/>
on level I am disturbed because we are talking about a ranger not a warrior.<br/>
<br/>
My max damage on my warrior hasn&#39;t changed at all up to level 15. Still hit<br/>
for a max of 17 with a mino axe, 11 with a combine scimitar and 8 with a<br/>
tentacle whip.<br/>

&gt;&gt; This might have something to do with the patch this week so I am going<br/>
&gt;&gt; to log in as my warrior tonight and experiment.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; This is the fact.  My Fine steel 2 handed sword has a damage of 12 and<br/>
&gt;&gt; delay of 43.  I normally hit for 21 damage with it.  2 days ago I<br/>
&gt;&gt; bought a purity belt boosting my str from 80 to 82.  I did not notice<br/>
&gt;&gt; any damage change.  Last night within minutes of levelling up to 10 I<br/>
&gt;&gt; started hitting for max damage of 25.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Any one know anything about this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Interesting, but I think your base assumption might be wrong.  The two<br/>
&gt;weapons I use had a base damage of 8 and 6. (Mino axe, and tomahawk).<br/>
&gt;I had a max damage of 17 and 13 (2xbase + 1) on each respectively.<br/>
&gt;If you are hitting for 25, I would think this fits right in line<br/>
&gt;with the 2xbase +1 formula.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am more curious as to why you weren&#39;t hitting for max potential<br/>
&gt;previously.  Were you burdened?  Perhaps at only 80 STR you had a<br/>
&gt;penalty?  Perhaps a bug was fixed and you now are hitting for the<br/>
&gt;correct damage.  The most likely thing though I can think of is<br/>
&gt;was your weapon skill for the 2H slash maxed for your level?  When<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been practicing recently, I almost never hit for max with my<br/>
&gt;2H slash, but it is significantly below max (like 20 out of 95).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Btw, I&#39;m an 18th Barbarian warrior, STR of 120.  So perhaps the<br/>
&gt;comparison isn&#39;t quite fair.<br/>
