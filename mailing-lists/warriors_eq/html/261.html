with<br/>
my store bought bow, even if you miss you get the faction shift.  Two<br/>
levels<br/>
huh?  What is the real life time you spent then? aprox?<br/>

Aprox 18 hours rl time, from  barely level 17 to almost level 20, with side<br/>
trips to Befallen and Najena. Lost 19 twice due to dying. Once an orc<br/>
fanatic rooted then it and three others walked over to the casters and did<br/>
them in before returning for me, the casters were unable to bring them back<br/>
to me. The shiny brass halberd (16 dam 48 delay, hits magic) was well worth<br/>
the time invested.<br/>
