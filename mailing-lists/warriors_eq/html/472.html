<div id="ygrps-yiv-673920829">The only tasting I do concerning humans is when I taste their still pumping blood before finishing them with a stab thru their corrupted heart.<br/>
<br/>
ooc:  I have no problems being DE, or any evil race for that matter.  Hrm...lets see, places where an evil person can&#39;t go<br/>
Freeport - well after enough orc killing, you can enter city, but no need to go into city anways, if ya want to catch the boat, go thru the underground tunnels.<br/>
Dwarf city - no need to go there<br/>
Wood elf tree houses - no need to go there<br/>
High elf city - no need to go there<br/>
Gnome city - no need to go there<br/>
High Hold - again, kill a few HH orcs and the guards like you<br/>
Qenos - kill a few gnolls in BB and no problem, but again if you want to go to the docks, you take the underground<br/>
eurodite city - no need to go there<br/>
various NPCs on docks - all city docks that have NPCs that are indifferent or dubious to ALL race/classes.....NPCs on non-city docks are killable by any group thats strong enough to be fighting on that respective island.<br/>
Rivervale - dunno what I killed to make them like me, but I can pass thru with no problems.<br/>
<br/>
Dungeons:<br/>
Najena - easy enough, kinda tough for you &quot;good&quot; people to get to because you got to run thru Nektulos with wondering guards everywhere.....and to my knowledge there is no way to raise your faction standing with DEs other than to ruin your faction standing with halflings.<br/>
Solsek Eye - easy enough for darks, same story as najena for you &#39;good&#39; types<br/>
Befallen - nutral teritory<br/>
Runnyeye - depending on which direction you are coming from.....you might have to stop in HH and kill some orcs, then run the long way thru HH into the karanas, back into beholders maze, then whala, or do like me and just run thru munchkin town<br/>
Guk - in troll land, pretty easy to get to for &quot;good&quot; people but nowhere close for non casters to be bound, and nowhere close for &quot;good&quot; people to sell, very easy for us evil types with Troll town just around the corner....again, no way for &quot;good&quot; people to raise their faction with Trolls<br/>
Cazic Thule - same as Guk, good types have nowhere to bind and nowhere to sell, evil has it easy....not to mention the entrance of Cazic is patroled by an ogre guard.....again, no way for &quot;good&quot; people to raise their faction with Ogres<br/>
Crushbone - well, we dark elves have a pact with the Crushbone orcs, so we take a faction hit with the dark elf warrior guild for hunting there....but only 2 magic items worth getting from there anyways, not to mention its way crouded and a long ways away from any &quot;evil&quot; starting town, so by the time you get there you are probably to high lvl to fight there....see foot note<br/>
Mistmoore - nutral ground, a little tricky for us darks to get to, but not too bad, and we can be bound anywhere in greater feydark.....see foot note<br/>
Unrest - nutral ground, a little tricky for us darks to get to....see foot note<br/>
<br/>
footnote:  even tho we can be bound in close proxcimity to Crushbone, Mistmoore, and Unrest, there is nowhere on that entire island for us to sell or bank......however, by the time you are ready to fight in mistmoore you are probably going to have a high lvl wiz, who can group gate you back to nektulos for banking/selling needs, or since there are sooooo many &quot;good&quot; people compared to &quot;evil&quot; people, you are probably going to have a &quot;good&quot; person in your group who can go to town and sell for you.  And again, there is no real reason for us to need to fight in Crushbone or Unrest (ogres and trolls can&#39;t wear the small bronze, and us small dark elves don&#39;t have the raw strenght to wear bronze due to its weight)<br/>
<br/>
Also, everybody seems to forget the one big advantage of being evil.....we can kill any NPCs we want with out having to worry about faction hits, except either in HH or Rivervale (easiest connections to the Western part of the world.  You good types can only kill Nektulos guards (all troll and ogre guards are 50+)  And some NPCs have some pretty good loot.<br/>
<br/>
So to sum up.....evil isn&#39;t any harder to play than good, but it does force you to know more about the way the world works.<br/>

Which may explain why they all kill you on sight. You dark elves should crawn back in the scrawny dark holes you crawled out of before you taste another human blade.<br/>

OOC: Actually if it weren&#39;t so damned hard to play DE maybe it would be a nicer race. Seems to me that Barbs, Ogres, and Trolls got a tremendous warrior advantage in this game.<br/>

&gt; ya know why?  because humans, stat-wise, pretty much suck.  ie, and DE has base int of 99, human has 100 as max......DE warriors are almost as smart as human casters, haha, and I always remind them of this when I see them :)  (assuming its day time and they are not more than 5 steps away so they can see me).  And thats just an example of their pathetic inteligence, the rest of their stats are equally unimpressive.<br/>
