<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047117513">Hmmm... Areas to hunt...  Well... depends on your level of course.  And<br/>
whether or not your looking for some specific kinds of loot.  But my<br/>
favorite place of all time from all my levels was Cazic Thule.  Nothing like<br/>
pulling from the maze to your waiting group for the slaughter.  XP was very<br/>
good, and the downtown was non existent providing you had a well rounded<br/>
group with casters that know what they are doing.  You could non-stop pull 2<br/>
to 4 bluw/white/yellow out of the maze and just haul in the loot/xp.  Its<br/>
also imho one of the best zones to hunt in cause its outdoors which allows<br/>
SoW to be used.<br/>
<br/>
So if I had to put together a where to hunt for what levels list it would<br/>
look something like this.<br/>
<br/>
1-5 Definitely Everfrost Peaks.  The loot for low levels is the best in the<br/>
game.  Plus there is absolutely NO shortage of things to kill.<br/>
6 to 12 Misty Thicket.  Good xp, relatively safe, lots to kill.  I wasn&#39;t<br/>
that fond of the loot tho.<br/>
13 to 15 Beholders Maze.  Good xp, good loot.  Downside is its very<br/>
dangerous.<br/>
16 to 22 Unrest.  Great loot, good xp.  Bad side again is trains, and very<br/>
dangerous.<br/>
22 to 35 definitely Cazic Thule.  Cant beat the xp or the loot of this place<br/>
for this level.<br/>
36 and up.  This is a toss up.  I think I preferred solb due to the ease of<br/>
escape if you get into trouble.  The loot is hands down some of the best in<br/>
the game.  Xp can be made pretty non stop here as well if you get into the<br/>
right groups.  My second choice would be lower guk of course.  This place is<br/>
great loot again, great xp as well.  But very dangerous cause your usually<br/>
deep in the dungeon when things go bad with no way or chance in hell or<br/>
running to a zone.<br/>
<br/>
For stories, yeah I have lots =)  I don&#39;t typically share them tho... would<br/>
take a lot of effort for me to write them down in an entertaining fashion.<br/>
And since I am probably one of the worlds worse writters......  I might take<br/>
some time someday to see what I can do for you tho =)<br/>

Thanks for the reply. Im sorry to hear that the list is really slow, but Im<br/>
not surprised.  With so many people, like yourself, achieving the upper<br/>
levels information is abundant in-game.  I guess what Im most interested in<br/>
is hearing from people like yourself who might have a story, a suggestion, a<br/>
pitfall to avoid, a strategy, a nice area to hunt, etc etc.  As a 47th<br/>
Warrior I imagine you have seen just about all there is to see and do across<br/>
Norrath.  Id love to share your adventures, what suggestions you might have<br/>
for those higher level hunts and adventures.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the reply,<br/>
