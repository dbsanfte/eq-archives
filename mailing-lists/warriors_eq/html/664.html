<div id="ygrps-yiv-951046172">Well my only gripe is after delving in Paw for a couple of hours<br/>
with my enchanter, wizard, and druid friend, they all can gate<br/>
while I have to make the long trek back to Qeynos on foot.  Of<br/>
course when they get to be level 29 and 30 they get group gate :)<br/>

&gt; I saw a unique way to do that in another game. They added a ring for high<br/>
&gt; level<br/>
&gt; players only. When you got to a spot you liked you &quot;turned&quot; the ring.<br/>
&gt; After that<br/>
&gt; you could go anywhere ... then again &quot;turn&quot; the ring and ....  poof, you<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; back at your bound ring spot. It was SUCH a cool item.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, I think the Verant guys want to keep people separated for<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; reason in this game (zone server reasons maybe??)  There does need to be a<br/>
&gt; way<br/>
&gt; to stay somewhere though ... maybe they could balance it with a high cost<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; something.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Um, which part did you think was funny?  The ultimate weapon<br/>
&gt; &gt; or the boots?  :)  I really, seriously would like a magic item for<br/>
&gt; &gt; warriors to be able to gate back to their bound spot.  Or at least<br/>
&gt; &gt; give a spell to a wizard that allows you to gate them back (they<br/>
&gt; &gt; are still not able to bind you anywhere but a city).<br/>
