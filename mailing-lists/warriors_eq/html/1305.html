<div id="ygrps-yiv-738394790">In the experience with the Druid I wrote about earlier it didn&#39;t appear that<br/>
group damage counted. I was a 12th warrior at the time with two rangers and a<br/>
cleric if I remeber correctly and the three tanks coundn&#39;t outdamage that 13th<br/>
druid. It wasn&#39;t until the cleric starting using expulse undead that we ever got<br/>
experience. There may have been an undocumented fix in a patch since, but from<br/>
that experience I believe that the experience went to the single PC that did the<br/>
most damage not the group.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2cp. Hope it helps,<br/>

PS. I still haven&#39;t gotten a response on where to look for guild links for E&#39;ci.<br/>
Please email me with info if you have it please. Thanks all.<br/>

&gt; I thought it WAS group damage vs. everyone else.  i.e. allt he group damage<br/>
&gt; was added up together then compared to the steal killers total.  Thats why,<br/>
&gt; really, only higher level wizards can steal kill.  This is not the case?? </span></blockquote></div>
