<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-593866116">With a recent patch the blackened iron bastard sword, or bibs, was changed from its ratio.  It used to be 16 46.  It has been changed to 20 46.  You can imagine the difficulty in getting a sword like this.  It is off an extremely rare spawn in runnyeye.</div>
