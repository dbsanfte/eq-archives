<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652710071">I ALWAYS have two characters in every RPG game I have ever played Solomani<br/>
the Knight and jade (or Jayde or Jaade) the duelist.<br/>
<br/>
I nearly always start with Jade but end up switching to solomani for a the<br/>
long haul.  I also always end up liking solomani better.<br/>
<br/>
Reasons I like to play a female, being a guy;<br/>
<br/>
1) They look good and are nice to watch.<br/>
2) I find it easier RPG&#39;ing a female then a male, maybe its because I am<br/>
imitating what I have seen and not reflecting what I am.<br/>
<br/>
Also when I play a male the real me tends to come out a LOT more than with a<br/>
female.  This isn&#39;t always bad but it can be if you are playing an evil<br/>
male.  Its easier to RPG when you are forced to think about everything you<br/>
say and do, I see the character graphic as prism that distorts the light of<br/>
my personality. Sounds weird, but thats what 15 years of RPG does to ya ;).<br/>
<br/>
3) My fianc� plays the character (its a shared character) no where near as<br/>
much as me, but she does play Jaade.  This adds to the multiple<br/>
personality/erratic nature idea I like to do with Jaade.  I think (as does<br/>
my fianc�) its kind of weird for her to play a male (but O.K. for me to play<br/>
a female ... go figure).  We usually never tell our in game companions we<br/>
have switched so dont assume its a guy steering Jaade if you ever meet her.<br/>
<br/>
4) ITS A FANTASY game.  Its not real.  Dont assume because guys play girls<br/>
that suddenly there transvestites or anything.  Pickup any comic book, all<br/>
the female based ones are written and drawn by guys, are they &quot;gay&quot; as well?<br/>

&gt; Speaking of women.....There is one big question I have.....why do guys<br/>
&gt; play girl characters....some say they are role playing.....do they also<br/>
&gt; dress up in womens close and role play women in real life?  or is &quot;role<br/>
&gt; playing&quot; a female the first step towards role playing a real life female?<br/>
&gt; I know there are a lot of legitimate female players, but I&#39;d bet a large<br/>
&gt; sum of money that most of the female characters are being driven by<br/>
&gt; guys.....call me homophobic if you will, but I think its weird.<br/>
