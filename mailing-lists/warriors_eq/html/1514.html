<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-979526794">Point being 4 people said that armor type does make a difference in damage<br/>
received, one person said it doesn&#39;t and that he has direct confirmation<br/>
from Verant that it doesn&#39;t.  I don&#39;t know about you but very rarely will<br/>
Verant give out this kind of information, if at all.  And someone saying<br/>
&#39;because Verant said so&#39; without saying where he heard that is like someone<br/>
telling you &#39;My friend is a GM and he is going to ban you&#39;.   No, most of<br/>
the time if a player tells what he has found in his experience within the<br/>
game I will tend to listen to them more.  Its when they start saying &#39;I<br/>
heard from Verant&#39; or &#39;Brad is my brother and he said&#39; is when I usually<br/>
don&#39;t even listen to their argument at all.   <br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;I have direct confirmation from Verant that armor type is the Damage<br/>
&gt; Absorption constant.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; Point:  Anyone can state this.  Now give us facts.  What everyone has<br/>
&gt; said<br/>
&gt;  for this thread is only conjecture.  And the one thing I have found<br/>
&gt; constant<br/>
&gt;  in EQ is that conjecture = assume (and you know the saying about assume).<br/>
&gt;   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you can&#39;t accept what a poster is calling a fact based on your<br/>
&gt; assessment <br/>
&gt; of the poster than you&#39;re wasting everyone&#39;s time by filling a post asking<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; him for more.  Also note that the &quot;because Verant said so&quot; point wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; his <br/>
&gt; only argument.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as the invisible, theoretical damage modifiers go, I&#39;m curious as<br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; why so few people are defending their existance so vehemently.  I&#39;m also <br/>
&gt; curious as to what &quot;facts&quot; could possibly be brought to bear to prove or <br/>
&gt; disprove its existance other than the conjecture of very <br/>
&gt; experienced/methodical/intelligent players and the gospel of Verant.<br/>
