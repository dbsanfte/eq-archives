&gt; When someone has to camp an item for days to get it, why would they sell it<br/>
&gt; for a 20p?  That would hardly be worth anything<br/>

system out there to get the tomahawk, like how i said i got the chitin<br/>
shield, and also the BBC. It would only take a very short time to get the<br/>
item if we knew the system, *hopefully* forcing the price of these items<br/>
down.<br/>
