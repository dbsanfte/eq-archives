<div id="ygrps-yiv-210382192">A full group below 24 can get large bronze so long as you have a 24th level<br/>
wizard with you. There is a &#39;rare&#39; NPC that spawns with the creature who<br/>
drops the large bronze (a 26th or 27th level cleric instead of a 22nd or so<br/>
level warrior). This makes the fight very dangerous (a 22nd level paladin,<br/>
2 24th level warriors, a 24th level ranger, and a 24th level wizard managed<br/>
the fight). She also seems to be spawning more often as of late, or at<br/>
least was when I finished getting my full set of large bronze at level 24.<br/>
I started camping that spot at level 21 or 22, now I have to go back to<br/>
that zone at 26 to take out a few more special NPC&#39;s there. Large bronze is<br/>
also very heavy, a full set, a BBC, and a ash bow tip the scales at about<br/>
138. This doesn&#39;t leave me much room to carry alot of loot.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Only small bronze armor is dropped by DBs.  You have to go to another<br/>

for large bronze.  And you have to have a pretty good group of 24 to 25th<br/>
lvl players to get it.<br/>
