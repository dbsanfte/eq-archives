<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865900514">In beta I made the same mistake, then when I hit 18th a friend of mine gave me a BBC, it took about 6 levels, but I finally got my 2h skill up.  So yes, I&#39;d continue to work on your 2h skill, the sooner you start the better.  And yes, you will have a hard time raising it, BUT as long as you are in a good party you&#39;ll be ok, if in a small party or solo you probabaly want to stick with what you are good at.<br/>

I am interested to hear others opinions on this.  And what do you think of<br/>
trying to get my 2hs skill of 14 up to 80 on my 15th level DE warrior?<br/>
Worth working on?  Or will I have a hard time increasing skill?</div>
