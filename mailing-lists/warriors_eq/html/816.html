<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032362947">At level 15 I am just getting into the daul weild/double attack mode, but<br/>
Tom&#39;s info looks very appropriate.  My primary reason for looking to switch<br/>
from longsword primary and mino axe secondary isn&#39;t speed or damage its<br/>
STAMINA.  There is a current thread running on this topic - be sure you<br/>
check it out.  Mino axes are HEAVY, and weilding two weapons already takes a<br/>
lot of stamina.  Combine this with the fact that the length of your fights<br/>
increases with the level of the MOB and you run into quite a few situations<br/>
where you are runnng too low on mana.<br/>
Last weekend I was soloing some orcs in the south part of Oasis while I was<br/>
waiting for some friends to come so we could hunt some crocs.  I engaged a<br/>
lone orc and pulled him down to the beach.  While I was fighting this orc<br/>
(and doing pretty well - he was conning blue) I heard the DREADED sound of<br/>
an approaching giant (You know the sound if you&#39;ve heard it! It&#39;s one of the<br/>
few things that gives me an adrenaline rush EVERY time in EQ!).  Not wanting<br/>
to be squished like a bug, I tried to take myself and the orc closer to the<br/>
zone boundary - without getting into the ocean - and I got a LITTLE too<br/>
close to the OTHER orc that was in the camp.  To make a long story short I<br/>
managed to avoid the Giant, but I couldn&#39;t flee the orcs without running<br/>
into the giant.  I killed off the first orc and still had around half my<br/>
health...I ran out of stamina before I ran out of health with the second<br/>
orc, and I was pretty damn confused!  You see I was SWINGING, but I wasn&#39;t<br/>
HITTING anything.  I checked SEVERAL timesto make sure I was still in attack<br/>
mode and properly targeted (you guys know that feeling??) and then FINALLY<br/>
realized I was just plain ol&#39; tuckered out.  Anyway it came down to the last<br/>
couple of blows, and I DID die...but I learned a lesson too.  Mino axes are<br/>
pretty cool (and I love the way they look - 2 axes is even cooler!), but<br/>
swords are much less demanding on your stamina.<br/>
Right now I am trying to see if I can improve my Piercing skill (I think its<br/>
around 20, lol!) by sticking a Fine Steel Rapier in my secondary weapon<br/>
slot.  I&#39;ll let you all know how that works!<br/>
Thanks fer your time...sorry if I rambled!<br/>

You missed the recent discussion on that very topic.<br/>
<br/>
Keep your 2 hander for dealing with blue creatures....keep your skill up.<br/>
As far as 1hs, use the longsword in your primary slot and the mino in your<br/>
secondary.  There may be a case for getting 2 swords for speed. I am not<br/>
sure you are getting the most out of dual wield with one fast and one slow<br/>
weapon.<br/>
<br/>
My current combo is primary: tentacle whip secondary: combine scimitar.   My<br/>
friends call me Ginsu :)<br/>

&gt;hey there..<br/>
&gt; I just got dual weild. I am thinking of changing from a FS two-handed<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sword to two 1H/weapons. Do you think that a magic combine long sword and a<br/>
mino axe would make a good combination? Which one should I use as a primary<br/>
weapon? Any ideas or suggestions would be helpful! Thanks in advance!<br/>
