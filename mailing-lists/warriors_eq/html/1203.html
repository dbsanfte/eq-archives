<div id="ygrps-yiv-98365780">i have seen all that everyone has said and in some cases i think being a <br/>
ranger has it&#39;s advantages. and yes i believe that warriors need more skills <br/>
not just any skills but useful skills. berserker frenzy has little effect <br/>
when fighting anything at all. usually by the time berserker frenzy kicks in <br/>
it&#39;s way too late and i am well on my way to dying. But being a warrior has <br/>
it&#39;s advantages. when a group member is being attacked and needs help they do <br/>
not call the ranger for help they call me to pull it off them. i can&#39;t tell <br/>
you how many times i have been saved or saved others simply by having a <br/>
little more hp than everyone else. there is an excitement in holding a weapon <br/>
in my hand and brutally attacking my enemies. there is a glory in fighting to <br/>
the death and winning with only 10 hp left. we are the ones who take all the <br/>
abuse and get screwed in the loot orders. but it is our calling. if you like <br/>
rangers well then be a ranger but don&#39;t complain about being a warrior. we <br/>
are a special breed and we should never look downcast on our class but we <br/>
should fight with a pride in knowing who we are. of course thats just my <br/>
opinion i do not mean to anger anyone by this i am just proud and happy to be <br/>
a warrior. the game is what you make of it. goodluck to you all in your <br/>
quests and many battles you face<br/>
