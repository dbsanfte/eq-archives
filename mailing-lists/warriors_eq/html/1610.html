<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277755932">If you kill a monster solo, you get X experience. If a party of two<br/>
kills a monster, you get X + P (P = Party Experience Addition), divided by<br/>
two (half of that experience for each of you). The bigger your party, the<br/>
bigger that P is - the Party Experience Addition is larger for three people<br/>
then for then for two, and larger for four people then for three, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Ok,clarification then.  Say for example my 34th level warrior and my bard<br/>
friend Mikal level 25<br/>
are grouping.  We kill something that we both get exp for.  According to the<br/>
above the exp gained would be exactly the same for mikal(or me) if he was<br/>
grouped with someone closer to his level.  In the past ppl were really<br/>
worried they wouldnt get much(or any) exp if they grouped with someone<br/>
higher level then they.. reasoning that the higher level would &quot;suck all the<br/>
exp&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
According to this, it seems we can dismiss this notion.  Eh?  Am I flawed in<br/>
this thinking?</div>
