<div id="ygrps-yiv-310060296">I am sorry to say but I agree with Verant&#39;s decision on this point and I<br/>
also submitted feedback on it before it was implemented.<br/>
<br/>
These items are supposed to be somewhat unique.  Now that doesn&#39;t entirely<br/>
work in an online RPG, but Verant&#39;s solution is the next best thing.  Any<br/>
quest or unique item should not be allowed to be possessed in multiple<br/>
quantities by a single player.  This way if someone wants to camp the BBC<br/>
because they have it and found out how valuable it is, they can.  But they<br/>
must sell theirs before getting another.  It simply removes the<br/>
&quot;profitability&quot; for camping items from some players.  I think the dwarven<br/>
tunic should be a lore item as well as the dwarven axes.  I have just come<br/>
from there and people I saw camping these items day after day.  Now I am in<br/>
the commonlands or North Ro and these same people are selling multiples of<br/>
those items.  They built and inventory of unique items and are now selling<br/>
them.  2 of those people were warriors and not mages, which saddens me.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think dual PGTs should be allowed any more than a ranger could have<br/>
dual Ebony Blades or dual Oaken Scimitars.  I don&#39;t particularly like the<br/>
whole economy of unique magic weapons and items either.  Making them lore<br/>
items and ineligble for trading and selling will go along way to reducing<br/>
camping and letting people get these items on their own.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason some of these items are so expensive is because high level<br/>
people will simply camp these easy to kill NPCs and prevent others from<br/>
obtaining them.  I watched one group of mages in Crushbone who would watch<br/>
for escaping mobs like Crush, the warlord, darish, royal guard, etc.  and<br/>
would cast invis on it.  They either knew where the mobs flee to or they<br/>
were using some magic to see invisible.  But they would wait till the mob<br/>
regenerated more than half its hit points and then kill it.  They stole<br/>
these kills in the most dishonorable way for pure profit.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, now I am ranting and will get off my soapbox. But I do feel pretty<br/>
strongly about this topic.<br/>

&gt;Sorry, this should read:  Those of you who just got two PGT&#39;s, you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;now screwed.  Thanks Verant.<br/>
