<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225699079">Ok...clerics heal. Blah blah blah....who cares? This is a board for<br/>
WARRIORS, not clerics. I am sorry if I am offending anyone by saying this,<br/>
but please keep your cleric opinions to yourselves. If I wanted to hear<br/>
about the virtues of playing a cleric vs. playing a warrior I would have<br/>
joined a cleric board. Last time I looked the list was called &#39;Warriors_eq&#39;<br/>
and had nothing to do with Clerics. If you have fun playing a cleric out<br/>
there, be down...have all the fun you want. Just don&#39;t tell me that I don&#39;t<br/>
do anything because I am a warrior because even with all your heals you<br/>
couldn&#39;t be half as vital in a group as I am. Without a warrior to save your<br/>
arse from getting hit by that 31st level mob you&#39;d be dead in 7 seconds<br/>
flat...well maybe 10 if you got a heal in there. Bottom line: Don&#39;t come to<br/>
my board telling me I suck, cause it&#39;s gonna tick me (and a lot of other<br/>
GOOD warriors) off really bad.<br/>

&gt; Umm...  whoever says this about clerics is stupid as hell<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At lvl 31 I group consistantly with a cleric.  This class is amazing.  If<br/>
&gt; you think all they do is heal, you are very very wrong.  Their dd&#39;s do<br/>
stun<br/>
&gt; (amazing for rogues) and they can heal better than any other class.  I<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; to see your two druids heal you to full from 1 bar of life<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also if all you fight is yellows and reds you need to rethink your<br/>
leveling<br/>
&gt; process.  Whites and blues are excellent to fight if you are in groups<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; handle large numbers well.  Before you say all clerics do is heal, play<br/>
one,<br/>
&gt; or play with a good one.<br/>
