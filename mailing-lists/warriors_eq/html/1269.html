&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wrote an e-mail to one of those guys from PPI - the ones who do the<br/>
&gt; great<br/>
&gt; analysis works of classs (see eq-stratis cleric for a sampling of their<br/>
&gt; work). I<br/>
&gt; told him of the things I have been reading here such as a critical strike<br/>
&gt; (which<br/>
&gt; he didn&#39;t think would be accepted), increase what bind wound could do ( he<br/>
&gt; agreed that it should go up to 70-80%), increased skill cap (no comment<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; him) and unique warrior skill (again  no comment from him). His idea was<br/>
&gt; to have<br/>
&gt; the warrior&#39;s  defensives skill be increased some how. That would make the<br/>
&gt; warrior harder to hit and therefore less damage and less down time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am going to try to get him to join this mailing list since I feel he<br/>
&gt; could<br/>
&gt; give great insight. He did say that they were not going to be writing<br/>
&gt; anything<br/>
&gt; soon but said something about how a warrior could be tweeked to make a<br/>
&gt; warrior<br/>
&gt; awsome.<br/>
