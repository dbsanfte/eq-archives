<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946068498">Mages have a limit at what they can do though.  Sure they can hit with a<br/>
spell for 1200 damage, but they have mana that will eventually run out.  By<br/>
what you are suggesting,  a warrior could keep swinging and swinging for<br/>
1200 damage per attack without losing that ability after prolonged use (did<br/>
that make sense)?  The critical strike is probably a good solution, as well<br/>
as the specialization skill - but in no way should a warrior be able to do<br/>
as much damage as a caster.<br/>

&gt; Sorry, that last email was just too hard to read!!!  Here it is again in<br/>
&gt; plain text!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the difference between melee combatants and casters magic should<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; thus:  Melee fighters should be able to do just as much damage, if not<br/>
&gt; more,<br/>
&gt; whereas a caster may strike from a distance, and strike multiple targets<br/>
&gt; with area effect spells.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I am the president of a national group that fights with live steel<br/>
&gt; weapons.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been fighting with long swords, 2-handed swords, axes and maces for<br/>
&gt; 10<br/>
&gt; years, and I am very comfortable with just how devastating these weapons<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; be.  No matter if you are struck by lightning or are cut in 2 by a large<br/>
&gt; axe, you are just as dead!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; So perhaps the direction we need to seek, and the difference between these<br/>
&gt; 2<br/>
&gt; types of characters. melee and caster, is not how much damage they do, but<br/>
&gt; how.  A caster should be able to reach far away, and strike multiple<br/>
&gt; targets, while the great warrior should only be able to strike at one<br/>
&gt; target<br/>
&gt; at a time, but be able to mow them down like wheat.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Oh, and if anyone is interested in an organization that allow you to wear<br/>
&gt; armor and swing a real blade ( and trust me, it will give you a whole new<br/>
&gt; perspective on your RPGing!) check out our website!<br/>
