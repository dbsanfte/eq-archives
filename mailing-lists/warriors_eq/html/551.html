You have to remember the AI that they have on these things. Who knows? They<br/>
could have broken the spell that entraped them, or they could just have<br/>
gotten pissed off at him. I see monsters fighting monsters all the time. A<br/>
griz was fighting a hill giant the other day in W. Karana, and in the same<br/>
day I saw a lion take out one of the two farmers. All I&#39;m saying is, they<br/>
made the monsters AI very unpredictable, and that is the result.<br/>
