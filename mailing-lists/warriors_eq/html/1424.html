<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-186507734">Geez - this is the silliest email I have read in a long time.<br/>
<br/>
A cleric wouldn&#39;t stand and fight a griffin while the rest of his party ran <br/>
to the zone.  Only a true warrior with a heart of stone would freely give <br/>
his life for the protection of others.<br/>
<br/>
Kill everything that is attacking your spellcasters, and die if necessary to <br/>
protect your friends.<br/>
<br/>
A warrior is not just a killer, or a tank - he the living example of honor <br/>
and justice.</div>
