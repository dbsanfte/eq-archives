<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422581501">I would like to get responses on what is your Sta. and HP&#39;s per lvl as a <br/>
warrior and what race you chose.<br/>
<br/>
I am a Ogre Sta. 142 and get 31 to 33 HP&#39;s a lvl<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking about going to the next new server and starting over but ill <br/>
test alot of the warrior race/stats out to see what will give the best <br/>
benefit.<br/>
<br/>
Also if you go Agnostic as a Troll or  Oger how hard is it to get into Good <br/>
Citys / Areas.<br/>
