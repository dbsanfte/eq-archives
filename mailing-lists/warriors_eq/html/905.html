<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359327039">You ALWAYS want that Polished Granite Tomahawk in your hand.  Gives<br/>
invulenrability and beserker strength . . . how can a mino axe compare?<br/>
And with stats of 6 26 it is the best weapon you will have until lvl 30&#39;ish<br/>
unless you go 2h weapons.  STAY WITH THE PGT.  They can be bought for around<br/>
300p if you people don&#39;t have one you need them.</div>
