<div id="ygrps-yiv-391073644">Is it just me or do we need more areas in the game ... a couple of new zones<br/>
wouldn&#39;t hurt. It MIGHT help with camping but then again ... it might not. I was<br/>
in Befallen the other night and I swear I couldn&#39;t see a single skelton for the<br/>
first floor and a half. (If you&#39;ve never been there it&#39;s like wall to wall<br/>
skeletons.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hear you brother .... hopefully someone at Verant will notice and<br/>
attempt to fix the situation in some way. Something like a high level mob spawn<br/>
on top of a camping group would suit me just fine.  :)<br/>

&gt; Hmmm I am really starting to hate campers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I use to take camping with a grain of salt and just move on.  This is now<br/>
&gt; becoming IMPOSSIBLE for me at my level to do.  Let me recite a little story.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I login on Saturday starting out in lake rathe, camped.  Not to fussed since<br/>
&gt; I can not pull the aviaks anyway, only CASTERS can.  Whats up with that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I moved on to the Egret Aviaks, CAMPED.  hmmm no problem lets try HH, both<br/>
&gt; ends camped. sigh, oh well im near Neriak I can head home to stock up and<br/>
&gt; try out lesser faydark and Mistmoore.  On the boat I get, I arrive in<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore for the first time, thought the place was pretty cool.  Learned<br/>
&gt; the easier areas pretty quick and start pulling for my group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wow this is going pretty well.  Hmmm zone went from 2 groups to 5 groups.<br/>
&gt; One group SIITING on the gargoyle spawn, another group hogging THE whole<br/>
&gt; graveyard, and the third, this is the best, the third camping the CORRIDOR<br/>
&gt; between the easy side of Mistmoore to the hard side of Mistmoore.  I mean<br/>
&gt; C&#39;MON.  Thats just RUDE.  Everytime we tried to pull some tuffer mobs<br/>
&gt; through the corridor their mages pets went berserk and they effectively took<br/>
&gt; all the kills.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; SIGH<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I remember when lake rathe was empty.  I remember when HH was empty.  Is it<br/>
&gt; just because most people on the server are my level ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People just DONT understand that a spawn can only support SO many groups.<br/>
&gt; Oh, a word of warning, NEVER take a caster to the Aviaks In Lake Rathe, they<br/>
&gt; wont leave.  I know a few of my friends who I didn&#39;t see until they made<br/>
&gt; level 25.  They just would not leave that easy xp area.  I hate it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ARGH!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ahhh I feel much better now, thanks for listening.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will be starting a new character on MM just to see if its a little better<br/>
&gt; WAY behind the pack.  Lets hope it is.<br/>
