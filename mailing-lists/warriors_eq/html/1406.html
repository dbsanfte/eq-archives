<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646756539">If you are planning on going dual wield, try and keep your piercing up.  I<br/>
kept my 1H blunt up as well, but then I look through a list of 1h blunts<br/>
available and found out they sucked or a warrior couldn&#39;t use them.  They&#39;re<br/>
are some very nice Piercing weapons however.  Dual wielding one of these<br/>
with a 1H slash can be very nasty.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.-- since you are playing a Dark Elf (my race preference), if I ever see<br/>
you grouping with or helping out any races besides the Evil Triad, I will<br/>
hunt you down and kill you.  Otherwise, welcome to the Dark Side of EQ.<br/>
