<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752175062">I&#39;m trying to figure this out myself.  When I go to town to sell, or to buy food and water, I always pick up an extra 40 beers.  I&#39;ve noticed that your alcohol tolerance will go up from drinking just 1 beer.....it doesn&#39;t happen every time, but it does happen.  Once my int gets back to normal I&#39;ll drink another.  If we kill a big monster, or win an over whealming fight, I&#39;ll pass a beer to everybody in the group :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping that once my tolerance gets high enough, I&#39;ll be able to drink 2 beers to get the str and sta bounus WITHOUT swaying.....only about 20 now, but slowly going up.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody else played around with this?<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
In the vein of discussing mystery skills; how the devil does alcohol tolerance work?<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me (mine is in mid twenties) that I can just drink more (and gain the extra str & sta & lower int) without the twirls.  If you drink more (with greater tolerance) do you keep getting more str & sta or is there a cap?  If so why bother drinking a ton of booze (especially if you don&#39;t get drunk!)?  Does the lowered int influence the rate you improve skills (I haven&#39;t noticed any difference so far)?<br/>
<br/>
It would seem that at high levels this might be handy thing for warriors to have (if you can keep the extra str & sta longer).  Anyone have experience with this?<br/>
