Sometimes you have to wait but usually you don&#39;t have to wait too long.  Two<br/>
nights ago, some guy shouts &quot;help!  I give 12pp to anyone who can find me<br/>
and lead me back to qeynos&quot; So, I figure hmm piece of cake and set out<br/>
looking for him.  He gives me a loc and I go there to look for him and it<br/>
turns out to be the middle of the West Karanas bandit camp. I know that<br/>
place pretty well so I did not run right in and die or anything but took<br/>
note of this prankster&#39;s name.  Last night I am on with my other char and<br/>
see him in South Qeynos shouting about something and I give him a /tell:<br/>
&quot;help I am lost ill give you a plat to show me the bank...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, he bites on it and while I go about my business, he runs around<br/>
looking for me.  &quot;where are you?&quot;  &quot;I see mermaids&quot;  &quot;do you see me? I am at<br/>
mermaids inn now - did you go inside?&quot;  &quot;now I see a pond whr r u?&quot;  &quot;hey<br/>
stand still so I can find u...&quot; After 5 or 10 min of wasting his time, I go<br/>
&quot;nm, found it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So moral of the story is: take names and kick butt later if necessary.<br/>
Sometimes you need to be creative, otherwise just /ignore.<br/>

<br/>
		But onto other warrior-related topics:  I have a story that<br/>
led to a <br/>
		particularly interesting problem....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
		What is one to do in a situation like this?  Has anyone else<br/>
ever come across <br/>
		this kind of thing?  What did you do about it?<br/>
<br/>
