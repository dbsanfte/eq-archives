<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-652301456">You chesed the thing down, doing the majority of the damage, and then he walked up and made the final whack then started complaining cause you took the loot...sounds to me like he was being a crybaby about the whole deal and being totaly unfair. You did the majority of the damage, then he walked up and killed it. I think he was hoping to loot something without really working for it. And then you say he proceeded to send you tells saying &quot;I cant belive you did that&quot;? The next time something ike that happens, just tell them to leave you alone. If they keep it up just /ignore them. <br/>
