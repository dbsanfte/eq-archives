<div id="ygrps-yiv-98373833">Uhmm - Fippy is the low level npc in nq - of that I am certain!  Now Flippy<br/>
is probably the one you speak of and I have seen Verant play other tricks<br/>
with similar names to entice you into fights way over your head.  GM&#39;s can<br/>
take over NPC&#39;s and play them against players - not sure what their policy<br/>
is but they have the power.  I have heard that they will do this to break up<br/>
farmers who are not sharing spawns at camp sites.<br/>
<br/>
You can hail Gnasher Gnoll as well and talk to him.  He is part of 2 quests<br/>
out of Qeynos. And much lower level than the uber Gnolls in BB.<br/>
<br/>
There is another named gnoll who lives on the farm in West Karana.  His name<br/>
is Furball Miller.  You can talk to him too.  (Hint: just don&#39;t blindly<br/>
follow him into the corn fields.)  Also talking to his parents you get his<br/>
sad tale.  He is adopted.  I think this is some unfinished quest as he has<br/>
relations back in BlackBurrow or Split Paw.<br/>
<br/>
In South Qeynos there is a quest to kill Trumpy Irontoe - an obnoxious short<br/>
guy.  In QH, you will see a Crumpy Irontoe who is much higher level.  I<br/>
think Verant wants to fool you into trying to kill him thinking its Trumpy<br/>
(low level) when really it&#39;s Crumpy (high level) and you will get your butt<br/>
kicked (unless of course you are high level.)<br/>
<br/>
Moral of the story: con everything and read the words as well as look at the<br/>
colors.<br/>

		Just a quick note on your revenge list of<br/>
		Fippy<br/>
		Fippy<br/>
		Fippy<br/>
		i hope you are aware that there is a FLIPPY Darkpaw and a<br/>
Fippy Darkpaw.<br/>
		the first being the infamous newbie killer in qeynos whom i<br/>
kill everytime i <br/>
		go back there...(i am lvl 24 warrior now) &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
		and the second being a GM of verant who spawns himself up<br/>
top of <br/>
		blackburrow. Fippy is lvl 17, and if u catch him in a good<br/>
mood and hail him <br/>
		speaking Gnoll he will actually talk to...<br/>
		i was told this by a apprentice gm one day and i didn&#39;t<br/>
believe him... so i <br/>
		went and waited in BB after paying 5pp to learn Gnoll..<br/>
		1day went by and no Fippy<br/>
		2day and no Fippy<br/>
		and on the 3rd day i just happened to be at the right place<br/>
and the right <br/>
		time...FIPPY SPAWNED. then after a short conversation he<br/>
proceeded to kick <br/>
		my butt...<br/>
		Moral of the Story<br/>
		I have no clue but it was neat talking to him..<br/>
