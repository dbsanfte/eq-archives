<div id="ygrps-yiv-404261936">Damn I feel cool now, scored me a Demon Claw this weekend.  What is a Demon Claw, well its a really nice, really cool looking, magic 1h slashing weapon that the Avitar of Fear carries.  The AoF is high, real high, 30s, 38 or so, but his claw kicks butt.  Damage is only 5, but speed is 19, yes 19, I swing it about 6 or 8 times in the time it takes me to swing my BBC just twice.  In some fights I swear the thing swings almost continusouly.  Needless to say, this weapon has restored my faith in dual wielding.</div>
