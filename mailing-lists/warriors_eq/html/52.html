&gt; Just signed up on the list, thought I&#39;d take a minute to introduce myself<br/>
:)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m Salr D&#39;Taynkk, Dark Warrior of The Kith, Veeshan.  I&#39;m 24th, will be<br/>
25th tonight (reposte woohoo), Dark Elf warrior.  I&#39;ve been playing since<br/>
phase 2 and concider myself to be one of the better warriors of the land,<br/>
not due to my level or my equipment, but because I&#39;ve been playing for a<br/>
while and know the role of a warrior in a party.  I protect my healer with<br/>
my life, and will sacrifice myself to ensure the remainder of my party has a<br/>
few moments to escape....when necessary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for weapons, my BBC is my primary weapon, but I also keep my 1h<br/>
slashing/dual wield skills up by using dual Barbed Leather Whips.  I also<br/>
use archery, mainly for fetching monsters, but also use it when I get to<br/>
hurt to tank, I&#39;ll just back up and fire off arrows until I either get<br/>
healed or the critter is dead.  Archery is a very underrated skill, I&#39;ve<br/>
finally got my skill up to mid 80s and with the bow I have I can hit for up<br/>
to 12 damage, nothing major, but when you are hurt you can still dish out a<br/>
little damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for the rest of my equipment, I have a Blackend Iron Crown, Grotesque<br/>
mask, Spiked Collar, Rusty Spiked Pads, Barbed Arms, Blackend Bracers,<br/>
Blackend Gloves, Dwarven Tunic, Black Iron Girdle, Blackend legplates,<br/>
Blackend Boots, 2 ony earrings, 2 bands of flesh.  Just a couple pieces<br/>
short of a full set of blackend, can&#39;t wait, should have those by the end of<br/>
the weekend :)<br/>
