<b>Subject:</b> RE: berzerker <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-984237888">hey guys,,, need some advise with this.<br/>
I would like to know if I&#39;m using berzerker right.  From my experience it <br/>
only kicks in when my hp&#39;s are really low,, just before that point where I <br/>
need to run; however usually by the time it kicks in I am only a hit or two <br/>
from the point where I can no longer run... well that is unless I am very, <br/>
very close to a zone, which dosn&#39;t happen very often.  So the only realistic <br/>
use I can think of is a reminder that I need to evaluate my situation and <br/>
think about getting out of there while I can, if possible.  My hits don&#39;t <br/>
seem to change much when I enter berzerker either, can&#39;t say that for the <br/>
mobs though.  They hit me twice as hard with almost every hit when they get <br/>
down to one bubble, very annoying to loose one bubble of hp for most of the <br/>
fight and then two bubbles while you are just finishing them off.  Hey, If <br/>
there is any stradegy to using it please let me know,,,,, I really want to, <br/>
but can&#39;t figure out how......need every bit of help I can get  8)<br/>
