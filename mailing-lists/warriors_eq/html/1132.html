<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108178823">Ok here is the prime example of how we warriors suck. (Not that i enjoy<br/>
calling myself names or anything)<br/>
<br/>
With my warrior and some friends i attempted to solo a blue sand giant. I<br/>
had a cleric of the same level with me and a magician as well ( all level<br/>
37.) SO i begin the fight and it starts going bad right away. There i am<br/>
hitting him and seeing his Hp bar drain waaaay slow. I figure i can stand<br/>
here and take his punishment maybe 1 minute longer. So my friends step in<br/>
and heal me up and we take it together quite easily.<br/>
<br/>
Ok Then the cleric acts all tough and decides he wants some 1 on 1 action<br/>
with a giant for kicks. Ok we say. I stand back with the magician as the<br/>
cleric proceeds to root / wrath and hit the giant to death. He finished off<br/>
the battle with about 1/8th life left mind you but he did kill the damn<br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
There you have it. A cleric at level 37 takes on the giant, a warrior of<br/>
same level WITH buffs cannot. Not much else can be said. Oh sure i know its<br/>
like comparing apples and oranges but hell, doesnt it kinda make you mad.<br/>
Sure he&#39;s got spells but we are WARRIORS the so called masters of combat and<br/>
defense. <br/>
<br/>
I think that troll warrior had it right. This is why ive pretty much put my<br/>
warrior on the shelf and been playing with a cleric char. Get this. At level<br/>
16 with my warrior i would never ever partied solo. never. with my cleric i<br/>
ususally play solo. I get levels faster, cause i can take creatures that con<br/>
even to me with my cleric. <br/>
<br/>
Well thats my 2 cents, take it or leave it but im pretty sure that we all<br/>
agree that warriors need something from verant to distinguish us from the<br/>
rest of the classes.<br/>

&gt; I am not actually board with my character, just tired of waiting for the<br/>
&gt; goodies to come when they are actually no where to be found.  They will<br/>
&gt; never get to us, and we are outweighed even in a group setting by other<br/>
&gt; melee classes.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I am not so concerned about the magic using/healing/gating part of this as<br/>
&gt; I am the fact that the masters of physical combat (warriors) are anything<br/>
&gt; but that.  Healing never has been IMO a part of what a warrior can do.<br/>
&gt; But a warrior is supposed to be the master or armed combat.  When we cap<br/>
&gt; out at skill level 200 and others can go beyond that as well as do more<br/>
&gt; damage than us warrior, something is definitely wrong.  I think we should<br/>
&gt; start a pettition to verant to try to even things out a bit more.  The<br/>
&gt; suggestions in this post on EQ`Lizer for modifying the Warrior class are<br/>
&gt; well thought and not too much to ask. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; If anyone else is at all interested in starting a pettition, I will get<br/>
&gt; things going.  Just let me know and I can get things rolling on it....<br/>
&gt; Even if you dont respond to me on this, I will get things going anyways.  <br/>

&gt; 	James....I also am getting a little bored with my level 19 Barbarian<br/>
&gt; Warrior.  One of the reasons, I guess, that I started the Bard.  I do<br/>
&gt; think that Verant has overlooked us slightly.  When I played Realm, the<br/>
&gt; warrior on there could buy mana and cast spells.  Agreed, they didn&#39;t work<br/>
&gt; as well as the mages did, but we still could have the basics.  I would<br/>
&gt; like to see Verant come up with another plan.  Perhaps some sort of magic<br/>
&gt; skill, so at the very least, we could gate and cast healing on ourselves.<br/>
