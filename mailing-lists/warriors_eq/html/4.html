<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653615003">Hello fellow warriors.<br/>
I have a quick question. I am a lvl 13 warrior,with a mino axe working out of Freeport. I will be getting dual wield at 15 and would like to find a magic one-handed slashing weapon as my primary and my mino as my secondary. The problem is i never hear magic weapons being auctioned and the ones the trader has in North Ro cave are well over 200 plat. Ant tips or suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>
