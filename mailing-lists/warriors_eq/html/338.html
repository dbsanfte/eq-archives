<b>Subject:</b> On Guk, Innothule & Netted & Woven Armor <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013977540">I posted tis awhile ago to another EQ list I was on, and I thought you guys<br/>
might appreciate it.<br/>
Enjoy.<br/>
I originally took my lvl 11 monk to Innothule and Guk to try and get some<br/>
netted, woven and/or Mesh armor, and here&#39;s what I found.<br/>
Lvl 11 is BAD for getting this stuff.  You&#39;re too high to get any experience<br/>
chasing froglocks in Innothule, and too low level to find much to hunt in<br/>
Guk.  Innothule is a newbie/low lvl character area for the trolls...mobs<br/>
range from lvl 1 (the usual newbies stuff plus froglock tads) to lvl 8<br/>
(froglock foragers, kobold hunters and bull &#39;gators).  Its tuff in the lvl<br/>
7-9 range, though because the hunters seem to travel in packs, and the<br/>
foragers and gators will swarm you as well.  I&#39;ve been killed TWICE by<br/>
groups of these with a lvl 11 (albiet unarmored) MONK (travelling to get my<br/>
corpse in Guk...you will have to do that a LOT if you attempt Guk at lvl<br/>
11!).<br/>
I started a troll with the intent of getting some magical armor for my Monk,<br/>
but fell in love with roleplaying Grukklukk.  Warriors may be the least<br/>
exiting characters to play (I certainly think that point is VERY<br/>
debateable!), but roleplaying a TROLL basher is really a blast (if you&#39;re<br/>
into that kinda thing!), and trolls make VERY formidable warriors!<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve learned quite a bit about finding netted and woven stuff, and<br/>
I&#39;d love to share that knowledge with all of the Brothers.<br/>
Netted is very easy to find...you will get a piece of netted at least an<br/>
average of once in every 10 froglocks that you kill in Innothule (the swamp,<br/>
not Guk!).  This DOES include the froglock tadpoles (level 1 critters,<br/>
imagine THAT!), as well as the regular froglocks and the Frogie Fisherman.<br/>
As has been noted before, the Kobold hunters and Froglock Foragers (around<br/>
lvls 7-8) MAY have woven on them, but it is VERY infrequent.  I think I only<br/>
picked up one piece of woven that way, the other THREE I found were in Guk.<br/>
Hunt what you can in Innothule, but watch out for the Troll Bashers (Guards)<br/>
and NPCs...there are quite a few in Innothule!Bottom line: if you see a Tad<br/>
and you DON&#39;T kill it, you just night have missed those Netted gloves you&#39;ve<br/>
been lookin for...kill &#39;em ALL!<br/>
Moving onto Guk.  Guk, even Upper Guk, is a pretty high level dungeon.  The<br/>
Froglock guards right outside of Guk, are prolly around lvl 7-9 (they give<br/>
netted when they cough up armor, but it doesn&#39;t appear to be very often).<br/>
Once inside Guk you will find an upgraded form of the Froglock Tad spawning<br/>
in the first chamber...these frogs are around lvl 6 or so and seem to give<br/>
netted armor.  You will also find Sentries and (sometimes) apprentices<br/>
fairly close to the entrance to the dungeon.  These guys will always con<br/>
green or blue to a lvl 10.  The Sentries seem to give netted, while the<br/>
Apprentices are the easiest frogs in Guk that I have found that will<br/>
SOMETIMES yeild woven (got 2 pieces of woven that way).<br/>
The biggest problem that you will find with all of these frogs that are near<br/>
the entrance is that they will run away when you start bashin them.  All of<br/>
the froglocks do this, even the ones that con black or higher!  Try and kill<br/>
them before they cross the bridge.  If you can&#39;t kill them before they get<br/>
to the bridge its probably a good idea to let them go, the risk of falling<br/>
off the water into the bridge and/or running into a high level mob on the<br/>
other side is just NOT worth it (unless maybe you are lvl 16 or higher!).<br/>
Fear not, that injured frog will be back...but he MAY bring along a higher<br/>
level Sentinel or Warrior with him.  Be absolutely sure that you /con<br/>
ANYTHING that comes across that bridge!!  If your injured quarry comes back<br/>
they will have regained some health...try and kill them before they can<br/>
retreat past the bridge this time!<br/>
There is a pretty large differnce between the (few) mobs you will find on<br/>
the entrance side of the bridge and the ones on the other side.  There will<br/>
be a few easy kills right across the bridge, but there are lvl 16-20 mobs<br/>
VERY close, so be careful!<br/>
I&#39;ve been killed numerous times (both my troll and my monk) by<br/>
Warriors,Shaman, WitchDoctors, Novices and various Ton Frogs (if it is ANY<br/>
kind of Ton, its pretty high level!) that come training across the bridge<br/>
chasing higher level characters.  <br/>
BTW I died TWICE in like an hour from a Monk training and fiegning nasty<br/>
frogs into us low levels by the entrance...NOT a very fun experience!<br/>
Crossing the rickety bridge is very dangerous.  Proceed with EXTREME caution<br/>
unless you are in the lvl 16 range...and even then you MUST choose your<br/>
targets carefully, and you really should be in a group.<br/>
I&#39;ve killed afew of the mobs that are around lvl 15-16, mostly through<br/>
desperation, sometimes by shear luck, and I haven&#39;t found any mesh on any of<br/>
them yet.  From what I understand you can get mesh from frogs that are lvl<br/>
15 or greater, and I certainly haven&#39;t killed many of those.<br/>
Just some thoughts, and some rambling, from one who&#39;s been there.  I hope it<br/>
helps!<br/>

Bristlebane and have questions or want to group up!  Both characters are lvl<br/>
11 rt now)</div>
