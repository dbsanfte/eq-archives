<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a play style decision, not a numbers one.  I&#39;m speaking only to<br/>
the numbers.  Minute for minute, Warriors can&#39;t solo as efficiently as<br/>
other classes can.  Verdant does heavily encourage grouping, so once<br/>
you find even one other person to group with, you are enabled to begin<br/>
ignoring certain disadvantages of one class or the other; but sometimes<br/>
you&#39;re knocking around alone, and Warriors have a tougher time doing<br/>
that than other classes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Paladins don&#39;t have the HP of a warrior, so they<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They&#39;re not so far behind. I&#39;ve heard the number 25% less mentioned a<br/>
few times; if true, it&#39;s significant, but not massively so.  25% of 100<br/>
is only 25, which isn&#39;t very much from a high level mob.  25% of 1000<br/>
is 250, which is a larger number (but still the same fraction); but,<br/>
again, 250 isn&#39;t so terribly much when considered against the damage<br/>
output of a high level mob.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; can&#39;t tank as long.  They don&#39;t have their<br/>
&gt; dodge/parry/reposte are several levels behind a<br/>
&gt; warrior, meaning they never get those skills as high<br/>
&gt; as a warrior of the same level.  Add that in with<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, here I disagree.  My Dwarven Paladin (my main character) received<br/>
Dodge at 10; by 12 and since then (currently 15th), it&#39;s been level<br/>
capped.  That was from a skill score of *1*, up to the level cap<br/>
(5+(12*5)=65 at 12th).  Only 2 levels, not so long.  The Paladin had to<br/>
wait longer to get it, but now the Paladin is just as good with it as<br/>
the Troll Warrior I also run (though the Troll&#39;s lower in level).  I&#39;ve<br/>
had a much harder time keeping skills level capped with the Troll than<br/>
with the Dwarf; though the Dwarf does have about 20 or so more points<br/>
of Int (could be a bit more, I&#39;d have to check).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; their lesser HP and there is a huge difference.  Ok,<br/>
&gt; so the paladin can help heal himself after a<br/>
&gt; fight.....whooptee, if he were a fighter he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have so much to be healed anyways.  not like a 25<br/>
&gt; point heal at 25th lvl is going to do much anyways.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, if you say so.  With the Paladin, the heals do make a difference<br/>
in downtime.  The reason my other character is a Troll Warrior is for<br/>
regen; one of my main goals in EQ is to minimize downtime between<br/>
&#39;action&#39;.  Whether grouped or solo, both characters have something they<br/>
can use without looking to anyone else to reduce their downtime.  If I<br/>
knew I always had a healer available, I&#39;d play an Ogre instead of a<br/>
Troll; but because you can&#39;t always depend on having a heal present, I<br/>
play with Regen when I go Warrior.<br/>
<br/>
Warriors would be better off if bandages weren&#39;t so *damn* expensive,<br/>
IMO.  Bandages should go for 1sp each; they&#39;re just rags that&#39;ve been<br/>
washed and sterilized in hot water, after all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve found kick to be almost as good as bash, you&#39;d<br/>
&gt; be suprised at how often a 15 point kick will<br/>
&gt; disrupt a caster.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kick does more damage, but has a markedly lower percentage chance to<br/>
disrupt the casting.  Bash will far more often interrupt the spell. <br/>
Vs. NPC wizards, for example, this is damn critical.  I use kick with<br/>
my Troll to finish off fleeing opponents when they&#39;re almost dead; but<br/>
use Slam most all the time for the stun chance.  After having been<br/>
stunned all the time by everything *I* fight, it&#39;s nice to watch a mob<br/>
stand there for a few seconds while you whack on it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; EXACTLY warriors tank, paladins attempt to tank. <br/>
&gt; The damage either deals is minimal, both are in the<br/>
&gt; party for one reason....to keep the casters alive<br/>
&gt; long enough to kill the mobs.  So what would be<br/>
&gt; better, a tank that can absorb all the damage with<br/>
&gt; fewer heals required by the cleric, or a semi-tank<br/>
&gt; that requires more heals from the cleric, thus more<br/>
&gt; of a chance the monster will jump the cleric?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re looking for a &quot;X class is the best, period&quot; answer in this<br/>
debate, I seriously doubt you&#39;ll find it.  Verdant has done a pretty<br/>
good job of balancing the classes; there really isn&#39;t any one perfect,<br/>
or &#39;best&#39; class.  Warriors have pros and cons, as do the warrior<br/>
subclasses, as do the Mages, as do the mage subclasses.  Each has a<br/>
style of play that&#39;s either slightly or massively different from the<br/>
other.  It comes down to personal preference and available resources.<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<br/>
Warriors have to pair with a Cleric (or any mage subclass with healing<br/>
spells, or even a Paladin, who also has healing); because otherwise the<br/>
downtime after fights will catch up with them.  Even pairing with other<br/>
Warriors, or with Wizards/Magicians won&#39;t work around this; Warriors<br/>
will have to have a healer present to counteract their innate<br/>
disadvantage of requiring healing at the higher levels.  SKs are in<br/>
this boat too; they get tricks, but no heals; and so need the healing<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Paladins can self-heal, which enables a Paladin to fairly efficiently<br/>
team without a healer present.  After my favorite pairing<br/>
(Paladin/Wizard), my next most favorite pairing is (Paladin/Warrior);<br/>
because we&#39;re both solid melee combatants, and the Paladin can keep<br/>
both topped off.<br/>
<br/>
But again, it&#39;s just a matter of style and resources present.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2 tanks, why do you need a paladin?  More than 2<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See above; Paladin acts as second mini-cleric.  Just as 2 warriors help<br/>
spread the tanking between themselves (reducing the danger and overall<br/>
HP load that would be more onerous to a single tank), a Paladin helps<br/>
spread the healing load on the single cleric, yet doesn&#39;t force the<br/>
party to have a second guy (second cleric) standing around waiting for<br/>
the tanks to drop.  A Paladin can swing with the warriors and then step<br/>
back to heal, then step back in.  It splits the difference between a<br/>
3rd tank and a cleric nicely, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I like having tanks/fighters along; any full group I formed up<br/>
would preferably have 3 fighter classes present, and *at least* 1<br/>
Warrior.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But to sum up, paladins sacrifice so much melee<br/>
&gt; ability for so little casting ability which<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m confused where you&#39;re getting this &#39;sacrifice so much melee<br/>
ability&#39; thing from?  Paladin combat skills are level with Warriors&#39;. <br/>
The only main difference is at which point a particular skill shows up<br/>
(no kick or dual wield, and everything else 3-5 levels after the<br/>
Warrior receives it), and the lower hps.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s ok to not like a particular class; I hate rogues and druids, for<br/>
example.  But there&#39;s a difference between simply disliking a class for<br/>
astetic or personal opinion reasons, and the class flat out being<br/>
inferior.  No class in EQ is flat out inferior.  Each is simply tuned<br/>
in a certain way.  You find what best suits your own natural<br/>
inclinations as a player, and off ya go!<br/>
