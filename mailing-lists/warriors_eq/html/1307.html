<div id="ygrps-yiv-649038400">Two things :<br/>
<br/>
Kill any crushbone orc (even in Greater Faydark) and you&#39;ll loose faction <br/>
towards the Indigo Brotherhood.<br/>
<br/>
Warriors I guess are not meant to be the most powerful at higher levels. If <br/>
you try to play an hybrid, you&#39;ll see that warrior always are better than <br/>
them, and level faster, before they get most of their spells, their <br/>
warrior&#39;s skills and items. Then they are rewarded for their patience.<br/>
I mean, paladins, rangers and shadow knights have to start with one attack <br/>
only, like the non-melee class and only have more hitpoints than these class <br/>
(still less than warriors). They get all their warriors skill 4-6 levels <br/>
later than warriors and it IS a big deal, at early levels, which are longer <br/>
than the warriors ones (XP penalty). Believe me it&#39;s very hard to see those <br/>
warriors wielding two weapons when you can&#39;t, just because you still have 4 <br/>
levels to go, or because you will NEVER be able two (dual wield is so cool).<br/>
Now I know that warriors get in this depression when they see hybrids <br/>
getting better than them but it has to be this way. No warrior should be <br/>
each time better than a paladin wearing full plate and wielding a holy <br/>
sword, with lay hands and spells (the paladin should be IMHO). They pay a <br/>
high price before getting this far and I bet many decide to stop because <br/>
they are just underpowered at low levels. Their lay hands save them. <br/>
Tracking is the skill that make rangers valuable. And shadow knights, well, <br/>
they get the most screwed, power wise.<br/>
Hybrids are also played because of roleplay but they have to get this edge <br/>
on warriors on later levels. And I think Verrant wanted this to be. Now I <br/>
agree that once a warriors got all his skills early and only look for some <br/>
items from here to there, life is not as fun as it can be for a ranger... <br/>
Speaking about it I think that warriors should have WAY more items to seek, <br/>
and maybe not only weapons. On the other hand, there might be more to <br/>
discover yet. ;-)<br/>
While I&#39;m at it (getting long) I think that monks are so overpowered it&#39;s <br/>
not even funny. They can&#39;t wear armor but they don&#39;t need it as they get it <br/>
naturally, from levels, and even if it&#39;s lower than warrior&#39;s they also get <br/>
block. They get their fighting powers before warriors (dual wield from <br/>
start, grrr) and have these awesome special attacks. Ok the class is very <br/>
specialised (no way I&#39;ll play as a monk), ok it gets very boring at high <br/>
levels (yeah, more than warriors IMO) but hey, they are the masters of <br/>
combat, no contest.<br/>
<br/>
One last comment : I don&#39;t think that warrior should have a higher minimum <br/>
damage, they deal 1 damage when their attack is too low against the <br/>
opponents defense or when they fail their throw, no one wants a warriors to <br/>
deal 20 or so damage against a red mob, each time (not that it matters at <br/>
high levels, but it does early on). But yes, they can use an upgrade, and <br/>
one which would not unbalance the game, I see it mainly in many items, but <br/>
also in some skills improvement, maybe (bind wounds, etc.). Also I think <br/>
that attack and defense are caped at (level+1)x5 for warriors and they are <br/>
at levelx5 for the other class. I know some of you are gonna say &quot;oh yeah, <br/>
like 5 points are gonna make a big difference&quot;, it doesn&#39;t make a big <br/>
difference on each hit, but this is permanent, at all levels, and adds up to <br/>
great benefits.<br/>
<br/>
Please excuse my poor gramar and spelling, as English is not my first <br/>
language...<br/>
