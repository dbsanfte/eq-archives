<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179322711">West Karanas has 2 bandit camps - nasty unless you have the fire power. Your<br/>
party should.  We can take 2 bandits with a warrior#10 &lt;mailto:warrior@10&gt; ,<br/>
palidin#10 &lt;mailto:palidin@10&gt; , rogue#13 &lt;mailto:roguge@13&gt; ? maybe 14 and<br/>
its fun.  We also did 3 and it was exciting.  Sometimes there will be 5<br/>
bandits in the camp but usually there is a pair outside the camp.  They vary<br/>
too - smetimes fighters sometimes spell casters.  Some times good loot<br/>
otherwise good fun.  <br/>
<br/>
Also there is a brigand out there that requires a real gang to beat through<br/>
his full set of chain.  And ogres that I have not yet seen and scarecrows<br/>
but also not sure how they&#39;d con to your group and not sure if you could get<br/>
them one by one or if they swarm.  They are over our heads.<br/>
<br/>
If you hug the south shore and zone into N Karanas, you can hunt some good<br/>
stuff there but watch for the Gryfawns - unless you can take them.   That<br/>
might be one of those spot where everything is either too high to fite or<br/>
too low for xp.  A group of us 10&#39;s go there and hunt very carefully and<br/>
zone if we get in over our heads.<br/>
