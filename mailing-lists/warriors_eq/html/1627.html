<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363138013">Yep that&#39;s right. SHIFT + 2 will take you to the second &#39;page&#39; of hotkeys<br/>
for example. Now here&#39;s my addition to the hotkey discussion. Socials. I use<br/>
emotes and socials a lot, so I decided to try something. On your main EQ<br/>
screen (without pushing F10) there are some menus on the lower right. The<br/>
one to look at is &#39;socials&#39;. The menu is filled with all kinds of boring<br/>
socials &#39;afk&#39; is one, &#39;hail&#39; and &#39;wave&#39; are others. Well what I did was<br/>
erase them and write my own. If you edit your socials, you can add about 6<br/>
lines of commands like a macro. I use it to hail a traveller in a different<br/>
way, by introducing myself. So the edited social looks like this:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hail<br/>
&gt; /say I am Jynxx, officer to the Council Of Grey.<br/>
&gt; /say If there is anything I can do to assist you, just ask!<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then I name that something like &#39;intro&#39; and make a hotkey for it. By editing<br/>
socials you can do anything that you can command to do. Just for another<br/>
example, I have one that tells me who in my guild is online. I have it so<br/>
that it reads:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; /who council of grey all<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have that bound to Hotkey 3 Page 1. I just thought I&#39;d share with you guys<br/>
what I think is a great use for hotkeys, especially if you roleplay a lot.<br/>
To me that&#39;s what this list is about, and I have definetly gained a wealth<br/>
of knowledge from all of you. Thanks!<br/>

&gt; verify that I understood this correctly:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can switch between the 6 sets of hotkeys by pressing SHIFT + the number<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the set I want?<br/>
