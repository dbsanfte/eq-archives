(Lvl * 5) + 5.  Example, level 5 level cap would be (5 *5) + 5 = 30. <br/>
Some skills that are &#39;secondary&#39; or some such for a class might level<br/>
cap lower (like combat skills for mage classes, etc...).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>XP does not increase per monster when grouped vs. soloing.  However,<br/>
groups can (when functioning properly and working together) fight more<br/>
continually, more efficiently, and take on more and larger foes; ending<br/>
up in better XP and loot for the group as a whole.  A warrior has<br/>
difficulty, sometimes, soloing a white monster; and will have to sit<br/>
afterwards.  In a group, the warrior takes the monster with ease and<br/>
has very little downtime following the encounter.<br/>
<br/>
Group xp is divided by taking the total levels in the group and<br/>
dividing the XP for the encounter by them.  Each character then takes<br/>
one share per level they own; higher levels take more shares than lower<br/>
levels.  There are also some unknown tweak factors or somesuch in<br/>
effect behind the scenes that make grouping work better between<br/>
disparate level characters at higher levels (like 20+, etc...).  There<br/>
is less of an XP result difference between a 20 and 24 grouped pair<br/>
than between a 6 and 10 grouped pair.<br/>
