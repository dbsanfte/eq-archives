<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464116616">Hi all Ive been using duel wield and double attcak for a week or so because<br/>
of lack of funds (I seem to be spending it all on booze and broad&#39;s in<br/>
Halas).. I use a Mino Axe and a FS-longsword Ive been using the sword in my<br/>
right hand with good results yesterday I died and when I got my stuff back<br/>
the sword defalted to the left hand and the axe to the right so I decided to<br/>
try it like that WOW what a Differance I hit harder with my Right and faster<br/>
with my left now it is taking 25% LESS time to kill the same stuff as<br/>
before....Try it and let me know if it works for you.....Lilabn Lvl 16<br/>
