&gt;&gt; Then beat us to it.  Geez, what do you expect?  What<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This just leads to more in-game crap.  This kind of<br/>
&gt;thing almost makes me wish +PVP was the required<br/>
&gt;setting (almost, but not quite; because reality in<br/>
&gt;other games proves people will just use PC Killing as<br/>
&gt;a source of amusement and bullying, and not a serious<br/>
&gt;in-game mechanism).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have no problem with someone camping to obtain an<br/>
&gt;item.  Key word here, *one*.  They show up, wait their<br/>
&gt;turn, get their item, move on.  In this fashion, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;like an amusement park ride, everyone takes a turn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Camping to get multiples is just lame.  Very, very,<br/>
&gt;very, very lame.  It takes away the fun in a very<br/>
&gt;serious way.  I can&#39;t compete for the commonly<br/>
&gt;mentioned items because the hard-core &#39;see if I let<br/>
&gt;you get one before I and my friends kill-steal it away<br/>
&gt;from you while we laugh&#39; groups are determined to set<br/>
&gt;up and hold the spot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m probably going to have to pay plat for items I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;like my character to have, which really takes a lot of<br/>
&gt;the fun out of it.  A lot of the fun.  It would be<br/>
&gt;*fun* to go adventuring, fight through the dungeon,<br/>
&gt;find the spot/npc everyone rumors as the source of a<br/>
&gt;mighty item, and then defeat him/her/it in battle for<br/>
&gt;a great reward.  That would be *fun*.  But strolling<br/>
&gt;through the dungeon that people are keeping cleared,<br/>
&gt;finding a huge crowd anxiously waiting for the npc to<br/>
&gt;arrive; that&#39;s *not fun*.  Especially when they&#39;re<br/>
&gt;rude and irritated that I dare have the nerve to want<br/>
&gt;to come and get an item for myself, which is what the<br/>
&gt;response almost always is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Worse, it&#39;s certainly not fun to buy it.  I probably<br/>
&gt;will, but it&#39;s not going to be the same at all.  Not<br/>
&gt;at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One of two things needs to happen; Uber monster spawns<br/>
&gt;need to be instituted (like SGs in NRo and Oasis, or<br/>
&gt;the Mino Hero in Steamfont) that will make farmers pay<br/>
&gt;with XP and blood for their patches, or hard coded<br/>
&gt;&#39;lore&#39; item limits.  And if this makes it hard to get<br/>
&gt;a paired set of PG Tomahawks, tough.  We tried it the<br/>
&gt;nice way, and it&#39;s not working; so you&#39;ll just have to<br/>
&gt;use one PGT and one of something else.<br/>
