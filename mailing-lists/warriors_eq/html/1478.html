game.  <br/>

Monks and Warriors have similar, but not exactly the same AC.  Warriors<br/>
are always (with proper equipment) approximately 10-30 points higher on AC<br/>
for each given level.  This may seem insignificant, however, EQ uses these<br/>
sorts of tiny differentials as the basis for damage calculations.  Given<br/>
the way AC advances (3-5 point increase purely on level alone) there are<br/>
easy ways for EQ to &#39;normalize&#39; the AC vs. Offense to determine relative<br/>
damage levels for enemies of similar level.<br/>
<br/>
Monks are _not_ as good tanks as Warriors because of this difference.<br/>
<br/>
As for Studded, that is merely the trade skill version of Leather Armor.<br/>
There is nothing &#39;better&#39; about it.  I think its nice to have Studded<br/>
because it looks nice when you examine someone.  But there is no<br/>
additional advantage over Leather.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>
