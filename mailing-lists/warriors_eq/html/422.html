<div id="ygrps-yiv-965907832">Personally I don&#39;t care to pick the game apart in that much detail....takes some of the fun out of it knowing every extact number that goes into every equation for everything.  <br/>
<br/>
All I care to know about xp is that at 28th lvl I can group with 34th lvl guys and my bar moves as much as their bar so I&#39;m getting good xp still.<br/>

For all of you interested in the math, the lack of importance between levels<br/>
in groups for high level characters makes sense:<br/>
Take the 2 cases mentioned, the first with a lvl 20 and a lvl 24.<br/>
The lower lvl char is getting 20/44 = 45.5% of the exp, the higher char<br/>
24/44 = 54.5%.<br/>
In the second case, a lvl 6 with a lvl 10 we get:<br/>
6/16 = 37.5% for the lower lvl char and <br/>
10/16 = 62.5% for the higher lvl char<br/>
So if you look at these numers it makes a LOT of sense that the difference<br/>
in levels isn&#39;t as significant as you get into the mid 20&#39;s and higher.<br/>
I apologize if this is boring for some of you...I thought it was interesting<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  There are also some unknown tweak factors or somesuch in<br/>
&gt;effect behind the scenes that make grouping work better between<br/>
&gt;disparate level characters at higher levels (like 20 , etc...).  There<br/>
&gt;is less of an XP result difference between a 20 and 24 grouped pair<br/>
&gt;than between a 6 and 10 grouped pair.<br/>
