<div id="ygrps-yiv-96187413">These are your problems:<br/>
- Don&#39;t solo as a warrior, the downtime is too long<br/>
- Stay with 1hd weapons, you got the dual wield skill for a reason<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; For reference. You may recall that I had started a ranger about 3 weeks<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ago.  I have been playing with that character more than my warrior because I<br/>
wanted to compare capabilities at the same level.  My ranger uses a 2 handed<br/>
dwarven axe (great weapon by the way, 14 damage 43 delay), and sometimes a 1<br/>
handed dwarven axe.  He is at level 15.  I can solo any blue, many yellows<br/>
and i have even soloed a few red orc slavers.  In comparison my warrior,<br/>
level 16 is beaten to the point of 10 minute resting after a fight by most<br/>
blues. He runs from anything that is yellow or red.<br/>

a fine steel 2 handed sword and work up his 2hs skill to a comparable level<br/>
as the ranger.  We will see how that goes.<br/>
