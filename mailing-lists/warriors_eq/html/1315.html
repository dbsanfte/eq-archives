<div id="ygrps-yiv-971963076">This sounds great,, but.....<br/>
I&#39;d like to see an extra dimention added to it.  I&#39;d like to be able to <br/>
petition the gm for a group switch, like an evil gnome necro getting added <br/>
to the troll, dark elf and ogre team.  I think that would be wonderful and <br/>
add a lot to the roleplay possibilities.  It would allow you to be a spy or <br/>
traitor to your race, more fun stuff than just a strait race war.  If anyone <br/>
has any input into that type of thing we should send it in to management.<br/>

&gt;Hey gang,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just thought id let you know that when the new race war sever comes up<br/>
&gt;myself and a very good friend are starting a guild. For those of you who<br/>
&gt;dont know the race war server is sort of like the PvP server Rallos Zek but<br/>
&gt;you cant just walk up and kill anyone. The Races are divided into teams  <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;only other teams can kill you. This is how the teams are made up so far:<br/>
&gt;Trolls, Ogres, Dark Elves (Probably Lizard Men too when they get added)<br/>
&gt;Barbarians, Humans, Erudites,<br/>
&gt;Wood Elves, High Elves, Half Elves.<br/>
&gt;Dwarves, Gnomes, Halflings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now this is going to be way better than Rallos zek cause you wont have some<br/>
&gt;person of your own race killing you. makes more sense this way.<br/>
&gt;The guild we are going to start is going to be called The Dark and is only<br/>
&gt;going to be made up of the team of Trolls, Ogres, and Dark Elves. This <br/>
&gt;Guild<br/>
&gt;will attempt to bring misery and pain to those who follow the light. Both <br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt;friend and i are roleplayers and enjoy the feeling of playing the bad guy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So right now i am asking you if anyone wants to join us when the new server<br/>
&gt;comes out. We can always use Warriors, but we are also looking for other<br/>
&gt;classes too they are: Shamans, Rogues, Enchanters, Clerics In particular. I<br/>
&gt;am starting a Necro to be the Guild leader and My friend as Co leader will<br/>
&gt;be a wizard. We would like to get as many people as possible and if you <br/>
&gt;want<br/>
&gt;to be a warrior thats fine! Heck thats GREAT! We just need people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you want more info on our guild or want to inquire about joining email <br/>
&gt;me<br/>
&gt;at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ZWANENJ@...">ZWANENJ@...</a> during the week or <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:zbitnew@...">zbitnew@...</a> during the<br/>
&gt;weekend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks guys and i hope you all join me!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lothaniel/Rayne T&#39;kazz<br/>

&gt; &gt; In the experience with the Druid I wrote about earlier it didn&#39;t appear<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; group damage counted. I was a 12th warrior at the time with two rangers<br/>
&gt; &gt; and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; cleric if I remeber correctly and the three tanks coundn&#39;t outdamage <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; 13th<br/>
&gt; &gt; druid. It wasn&#39;t until the cleric starting using expulse undead that we<br/>
&gt; &gt; ever got<br/>
&gt; &gt; experience. There may have been an undocumented fix in a patch since, <br/>
&gt;but<br/>
&gt; &gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt; that experience I believe that the experience went to the single PC that<br/>
&gt; &gt; did the<br/>
&gt; &gt; most damage not the group.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just my 2cp. Hope it helps,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Surtur<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; PS. I still haven&#39;t gotten a response on where to look for guild links <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt; E&#39;ci.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Please email me with info if you have it please. Thanks all.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought it WAS group damage vs. everyone else.  i.e. allt he group<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was added up together then compared to the steal killers total.  Thats<br/>
&gt; &gt; why,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; really, only higher level wizards can steal kill.  This is not the<br/>
&gt; &gt; case??<br/>
