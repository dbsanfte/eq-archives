<b>Subject:</b> Re: Why I don&#39;t play a Warrior <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-631883461">Hello again,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve stirred up many people on this list and elsewhere.  Some people<br/>
understand my views while others want me lynched.  I want to clarify my<br/>
initial statement.<br/>
<br/>
As a class, Warriors are great.  I think they are a vital part of a group.<br/>
They normally do much better at their job than any hybrid can.  I definitely<br/>
want a warrior tanking for me.<br/>
<br/>
But to play a Warrior, they are lacking for me, for my style of play.  I<br/>
don&#39;t expect everyone to agree with me.  In fact, for many of you, Warriors<br/>
are exactly what you are looking for.  I wasn&#39;t comparing Warriors vs<br/>
Clerics in their effectiveness, I think they are both very important.  I<br/>
just like the decisions I have to make as a Cleric as opposed to a Warrior.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I used a Cleric in my comparisons was that I play a Cleric<br/>
the most.  I want to play a Warrior too.  That is the reason I am subscribed<br/>
to this list.<br/>
<br/>
I assume that many of you did not read my full message.  The last couple of<br/>
paragraphs were some suggested improvements to the class that I felt would<br/>
make the Warrior more enjoyable for me.  Let me show them to you again:<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;ve suggested in the past a Battle Cry skill.  This skill, usable once per<br/>
day, would increase the AC and Attack Speed of everyone in the party for 30<br/>
seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Another option would be Fighting Styles.  Give us an Offensive fighting<br/>
style.  This would increase damage or Attacking plus a taunt bonus while<br/>
sacrificing AC and Defense.  And we would also want a Defensive fighting<br/>
style.  This would boost AC, dodge, and defense with a sacrifice to<br/>
Attacking and damage.  It would be very cool if these Fighting Styles could<br/>
only be learned through a quest designed for around levels 15-20.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Give Warriors something to think about in combat.  Make it so that<br/>
experienced, skillful Warrior can be better than any newbie Warrior.  Give<br/>
them some abilities that would take skill to use effectively.  Knowing when<br/>
to switch Fighting Styles or use Battle Cry would be something an<br/>
experienced Warrior could learn to do well.<br/>

<br/>
Many of you stated your feelings about Warriors.  Some felt that the Warrior<br/>
should be the group leader, the best puller, responsible for directing<br/>
combat and retreats, and guarding the party while resting.  Many of you<br/>
stated how a Warrior could sacrifice himself to save the party.  I don&#39;t<br/>
consider these functions part of the Warrior&#39;s domain only.  Any good EQ<br/>
player can do this, with many different classes.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes down to a battle, the Warrior&#39;s job is to choose the correct<br/>
critter to attack/kick/bash/taunt.  Thats about it.  A good Warrior will<br/>
make the best choices here.  A good Warrior will switch targets many times<br/>
in a battle, distributing his attacks and taunts to keep the spellcasters<br/>
free from attack.  Some of the best Warriors will switch armor/weapons based<br/>
on what monster they are fighting.  Some go even as far to switch a shield<br/>
in and out in the middle of battle depending if they are getting hit or not.<br/>
<br/>
A few Warriors even say there is a weapon range effect.  Each weapon has a<br/>
different range where it is more likely to hit for max damage.  They adjust<br/>
their distance from the monster to try and get max damage.<br/>
<br/>
A poor Cleric is one that uses up all his mana for direct damage.  An<br/>
average Cleric is one who only heals.  A good Cleric has many more options<br/>
available for the group.  It is choosing between the many options I have<br/>
that make the Cleric a better choice for me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get to play EQ as much as many of you do.  I am unable to keep<br/>
grouping with a good group as they will pass me up in levels.  So I have<br/>
ended up grouping with many poor, mediocre, and average players.<br/>
<br/>
These are my observations:<br/>
It is much easier to be an average/good Warrior than it is to be an<br/>
average/good Cleric.  The learning curve for Clerics is just steeper than<br/>
Warriors.<br/>
<br/>
A poor Cleric is much more harmful to a party than a poor Warrior.  I&#39;d much<br/>
rather be a Cleric and group with a poor Warrior, than be a Warrior and<br/>
group with a poor Cleric.<br/>
<br/>
Average players will recognize the work of a good Cleric (compared to a poor<br/>
cleric).  Average players hardly notice the work of a good Warrior (compared<br/>
to a good warrior).  Many players wouldn&#39;t even realize that a Warrior has<br/>
been taunting correctly to keep the critters off of a spellcaster.<br/>
