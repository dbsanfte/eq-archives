&gt; &lt;&lt; I picked a warrior so I wouldn&#39;t have to think to much... I am just a<br/>
poor<br/>
&gt; barbarian princess that lost her combine longsword (long story, don&#39;t<br/>
ask!)&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No offense, but I think that&#39;s the problem.  The developers seem to have<br/>
felt<br/>
&gt; that everyone who plays a warrior is a beginner or someone who doesn&#39;t<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; to be forced to ever make a decision or use player skill more than<br/>
measuring<br/>
&gt; what to attack, when to attack and when and how to try to run and hide<br/>
(all<br/>
&gt; of which requires patience and common sense more than anything else; two<br/>
&gt; qualities I don&#39;t necessarily associate with my idea of a fantastic<br/>
medieval<br/>
&gt; warrior who wants to kill gnolls, minotaurs, mammoths and dragons but<br/>
&gt; nevermind that).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think we should be given far more to work with.  Really, how many hours<br/>
(or<br/>
&gt; minutes) did it take everyone to master the EQ &quot;melee system&quot;?  Given<br/>
&gt; hundreds of hours to practice, I really don&#39;t think that there&#39;s too many<br/>
&gt; levels of complexity out there which all of us couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
able<br/>
&gt; to readily master without having to think too much and assuming we weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; hit with all of our choices at 1st level (which could be intimidating).  I<br/>
&gt; like playing a warrior in RPGs but not because it&#39;s the simplest or<br/>
easiest<br/>
&gt; class, although it too-often is.  I can&#39;t stand EQ warriors primarily<br/>
because<br/>
&gt; whether or not they can talk the talk, they can&#39;t walk the walk, but<br/>
&gt; additionally because there&#39;s no special player skill involved when playing<br/>
&gt; one; they have no flexibility in fights and few options other than sit<br/>
there<br/>
&gt; and die or not (while swinging for 1/4th - 1/10th the damage of some other<br/>
&gt; classes).  That&#39;s just not my definition of &quot;warrior.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW, RPing a simpleton or a crude, ignorant savage is another matter<br/>
entirely<br/>
&gt; which should have nothing to do with game mechanics or the combat style<br/>
&gt; requirements of a high ranking swordsman.<br/>
