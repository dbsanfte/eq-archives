Ahh, how do you have any clue what kind of shape I&#39;m in?  Your really living<br/>
in a fantasy world.  Just so you know, I&#39;m 6 foot 4, weigh in around 255.  I<br/>
exercise regularly, and consider myself in good shape.  I regularly play<br/>
basketball ( full court), put in about 20 miles a week in road work.  I went<br/>
to school on a football scholarship (Athlete), and as I said I&#39;ve been<br/>
fighting in 100lbs of armor with 5 lbs swords for about 10 years. No, I have<br/>
not trained all my life, and I&#39;m not a Troll, though I have been compared to<br/>
a barbarian on the field :).  Whilke I need a rest every 5  minutes or so of<br/>
srenuaous activity in armor, I do tend to wear all day, and fight all day,<br/>
just not continueously.  Oh, if anyone&#39;s interested, there will be a large<br/>
Invitational Atournement for this kind of martial art (Medival<br/>
swordsmanship) in Vegas next October.  Look for it as an Xtreme game.<br/>
<br/>
Now, let&#39;s look at this in a purely historical context.  The Norman knights,<br/>
who did train all their lives, could usually last between 10 and 15 minutes<br/>
in the heat of battle before having to withdraw.  This is documented very<br/>
well at the Battle of Hastings 1066AD.  Of course, mounted knights faired<br/>
much better.  The thing to remember is that in a day long battle (they<br/>
actually only lasted a few hours)  The fighting was not fast and furious,<br/>
but consisted of a series of pushes and withdrawals.  In between, everyone<br/>
rested.<br/>
<br/>
So Wayne, why don&#39;t you tear yourself away from the screen, go outside and<br/>
try some of these things for yourself.  ya know, the stuff in the computer<br/>
is supposed to simulate what is happening out here.<br/>

&gt; &gt;But the Warrior does have a limiting factor: Stamina.  Once <br/>
&gt; again, I will<br/>
&gt; &gt;draw from my experience in wielding broad swords in real <br/>
&gt; life.  After about<br/>
&gt; &gt;3 to 5 minutes of constant fighting, in 100 lbs. of armor <br/>
&gt; guess what, you<br/>
&gt; &gt;are wiped out and need to rest a bit.  Just like the mage <br/>
&gt; has to rest while<br/>
&gt; &gt;dealing out those spells, we warriors should need to rest <br/>
&gt; after fighting in<br/>
&gt; &gt;all that armor and swinging that 3 to 5 lbs. sword around, 9 <br/>
&gt; lbs. in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;case of great swords.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once again, your real life experiences have no bearing on EQ, <br/>
&gt; a fantasy<br/>
&gt; role-playing game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe you need a rest every 3-5 minutes because your stamina <br/>
&gt; is much lower<br/>
&gt; than that of a troll or barbarian.  Maybe if you spent your whole life<br/>
&gt; training to be a warrior, you would have greater stamina.  EQ <br/>
&gt; Warriors can<br/>
&gt; fight longer than your 3-5 minutes because they exercise <br/>
&gt; instead of playing<br/>
&gt; video games.<br/>
