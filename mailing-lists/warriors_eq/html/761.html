<div id="ygrps-yiv-258468911">Im sorry.  I am the main person doing this and Ill try to cut out one line<br/>
non-sensical posts completely out.  I will also begin to trim the giant<br/>
emails as well.  I will also check to see if someone has answered the<br/>
question or made a comment I was going to make from now on.<br/>
<br/>
I think the main reason you will see lots of posts from me in a row is that<br/>
I live in a different time zone.  When you guys are asleep im at work<br/>
reading the list.  Therefore when you wake up in the morning you will see<br/>
lots of emails from me.<br/>
<br/>
Thats not an excuse but one of the reasons why you will see a lot of emails<br/>
from me in one chunk and then none for a 24 hour stint.  Ill try and cut<br/>
back, but I really like this list and perhaps I get to excited when replying<br/>
