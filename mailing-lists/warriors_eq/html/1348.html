I didnt start training my 2hs until level 25 or 26 i think.  I put 20 points<br/>
to it right off the bat... Capped it at level 30, and that was with<br/>
maintaining my 1hs cap as well.<br/>

  I have used one handed slash all my characters life.  I am currently lvl<br/>
16, and having a hard time building up two handed slash.  I tried last level<br/>
with no ranks in it, then I tried again with 5 ranks in it.  Do I have to<br/>
wait to level again so I can train 5 more ranks in it?</div>
