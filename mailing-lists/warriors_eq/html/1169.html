<div id="ygrps-yiv-1046185682">Very well thought out.  I am in complete agreement with every point you have<br/>
made.  This message is going straight to the top of my important message<br/>
pile.  Once we can get ourselves agreeable to these points or modifications<br/>
of them, (yes we will have people who disagree) then we can start gathering<br/>
support for them from the main web pages.  And people not on this list.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lets compare the Warrior vs the Hybrid classes (Paladin, Ranger, and<br/>
&gt; Shadowknight)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How a Warrior should be better than the hybrids:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Warriors should have a small percentage more hp&#39;s that the hybrids.  But<br/>
&gt; hp&#39;s should be a primary result of race and stamina.  A Wood Elf<br/>
&gt; or Dark Elf<br/>
&gt; Warrior should have LESS hp&#39;s than a Dwarven Paladin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Warriors should have a slight melee advantage over hybrids.  Apparently<br/>
&gt; this isn&#39;t so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Warriors should have one combat skill that is not obtainable by the<br/>
&gt; hybrids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How did Verant try to balance the Warrior but failed:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - They gave hybrids an EXP penalty.  In theory this should have<br/>
&gt; worked.  If<br/>
&gt; you play a Warrior and a Paladin each for 100 hours, then the Warrior will<br/>
&gt; be at a higher level than the Paladin and therefore more powerful.  This<br/>
&gt; does work, but most people don&#39;t understand or don&#39;t care.  Plus there are<br/>
&gt; too many level-based restrictions like who you can group with,<br/>
&gt; what monsters<br/>
&gt; give you experience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Warriors get combat skills at a lower level than hybrids.  This<br/>
&gt; does give<br/>
&gt; Warriors a combat advantage when they have the skill and the<br/>
&gt; hybrids don&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; At levels 1-4, a warrior can kick, while no other hybrid can.  At levels<br/>
&gt; 13-16 Warriors can dual wield while no other hybrid can.  At levels 15-19,<br/>
&gt; Warriors can double attack, while no other hybrid can.  The same goes for<br/>
&gt; Parry from 10-16.  These earlier skills do give Warriors a combat<br/>
&gt; advantage.<br/>
&gt; But at level 20, the hybrids catch up with the Warrior in the skills<br/>
&gt; department.  At higher levels, the Warrior has no skill advantage over the<br/>
&gt; hybrids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Warriors have access to the best melee races - Trolls, Ogres, and<br/>
&gt; Barbarians.  The stat bonuses these races have give the Warrior a<br/>
&gt; significant advantage over weaker races.  But the two evil races,<br/>
&gt; Ogres and<br/>
&gt; Trolls, have significant penalties that cancel out their stat bonus.<br/>
&gt; Barbarians are a good choice, but some people can&#39;t deal without night<br/>
&gt; vision.  But the better race selection does nothing to those who choose to<br/>
&gt; play a dark elf or wood elf, who probably made a poor race choice for a<br/>
&gt; warrior.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Berzerker Frenzy.  Not something to depend on.  Most of the time we want<br/>
&gt; to be healed before we get down to the Frenzy level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Verant also screwed up by giving Rangers both dual wield and double<br/>
&gt; attack.  Only Warriors should get both skills  (I&#39;m not considering Rogues<br/>
&gt; here, only hybrids).  It was good that Paladins and SKs didn&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; dual-wield.  Rangers getting both skills was a mistake IMHO.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Higher Skill Cap.  It was always rumored that Warriors didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have a skill<br/>
&gt; cap on their combat skills.  This lead many of us to believe that a high<br/>
&gt; level Warrior would have a decent combat advantage over the hybrids.<br/>
&gt; Apparently this rumor is false, and we have the same combat cap.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What can be done to fix Warriors:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Warriors should have a higher skill cap, either lvl *6 +5 or lvl *5 +10<br/>
&gt; instead of the hybrid lvl *5 +5 cap.  Warriors should also not be<br/>
&gt; capped at<br/>
&gt; 200 like the hybrids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Give Warriors a warrior-only skill.  The Monk has several special moves.<br/>
&gt; Give the Warrior something to use that is a little better than<br/>
&gt; Kick or Bash.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Give Warriors a once-per-day skill.  We need a Berserk or<br/>
&gt; Battle Cry skill<br/>
&gt; that would give us a significant short-duration combat boost.  It<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; be based on how low our hp&#39;s are, but instead usable when we want.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What should not be done:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Warriors don&#39;t need anything that makes soloing easier.  If<br/>
&gt; anything, the<br/>
&gt; ability of other classes to solo should be reduced.  EQ is a<br/>
&gt; group oriented<br/>
&gt; game and should remain that way.  If you want to play solo, Might<br/>
&gt; & Magic 7<br/>
&gt; was just released.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Warriors don&#39;t need any magic.  We shouldn&#39;t have spells that<br/>
&gt; make us heal<br/>
&gt; or gate or anything.  Warriors are as far away from spellcasters as<br/>
&gt; possible.  If you want the ability to cast spells, play a hybrid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How do we get these changes:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Don&#39;t ask for things totally ridiculous.  When people ask for huge<br/>
&gt; unbalancing changes, it makes them look like they haven&#39;t thought it out<br/>
&gt; very carefully.  Verant is much more likely to pay attention to our<br/>
&gt; suggestions if they are well thought out AND reasonable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Once we come up with a reasonable set of changes, get as many Warriors<br/>
&gt; behind it as we can.  Currently we have 100 people asking for 100<br/>
&gt; different<br/>
&gt; changes ranging from critical hits to healing to gating to wizard-like<br/>
&gt; damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Warriors only need a few small changes to become the dominate melee class<br/>
&gt; they should be.  There is an excellent article here<br/>
