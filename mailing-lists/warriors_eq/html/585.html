<div id="ygrps-yiv-245671291">Actually, good races can sell very close to Cazic Thule. Not a lot of<br/>
people know the Rathe Mountain zone well, but vendors are located there,<br/>
both good and evil, plus at least one that will sell to both.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As a reminder, you can get FS weapons in cazic thule, they are better than<br/>
 </span></blockquote>regular weapons, and players will sell real cheap because any of the &quot;good&quot;<br/>
races and the casters can&#39;t sell anywhere near by.  FS sells for 4 pp at<br/>
stores, so you can offer that and!<br/>
 have your choice of weapons.&lt;</div>
