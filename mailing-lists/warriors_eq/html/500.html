&gt;&gt;Wasn&#39;t the kith also the name of the Dark Force in starwars? I remember it<br/>
&gt;&gt;being mentioned in Empire??  Its a nice sounding name.<br/>

Just thought I&#39;d help ya out there.<br/>

    Ok, now my question. Is there a SWORD that is relatively as good as the<br/>
Tommy? (Polished Granite Tomahawk)....I know I may be being traditional in<br/>
the RP sense, but it seems like the best weapons for warriors are axes, and<br/>
I usually think of them as having swords. And now that I am on the subject,<br/>
why not a Katana? IMHO those are the fastest most damaging weapons IRL (my<br/>
opinion is based on my knowledge of Kinjitsu). I really don&#39;t want to waste<br/>
my time suggesting it because, like some other people, I am a &quot;hard-core<br/>
gamer&quot; and played in and/or tested a lot of online games and I know that<br/>
suggestions are very rarely taken into context. Maybe if everyone came up<br/>
with some good ideas and we all signed them like a petition and sent it in,<br/>
then they might listen? Well, that is my idea. I want a Katana. Maybe two.<br/>
Anyone want to see anything else in the game?<br/>
