<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620589700">Some have already been brought up...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; 1) Specialization for weapons like magic users get. Can only specialize in<br/>
&gt; one weapon over the skill of 50 - increased speed, more damage, more<br/>
&gt; attack with that weapon, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) Critical Strike - operates much like backstab does for rogue. It has a<br/>
&gt; recycle time, must use it to raise in level. Does triple damage when<br/>
&gt; successful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) Sleep - This would be the equivalent to magic users meditate spell. You<br/>
&gt; heal at a faster rate, but your entire screen is blacked out (ala blindess<br/>
&gt; spell).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4) Triple attack. At level 30 you get a chance for a third hit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any of these would be a warrior only skill, and I doubt if it would change<br/>
&gt; the balance of the game any, only making the warriors more than just a<br/>
&gt; damage-taker.<br/>
