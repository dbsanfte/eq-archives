<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731556531">I can definately sympathize with your plight, my<br/>
brother.  I too have troubles finding a good area to<br/>
fight in at this lvl. But what I do is now is fight in<br/>
Highhold. Usually there are enough groups around to<br/>
take care of possible trains, and soloing is not too<br/>
difficult. The loot is good as in Lavastorm.<br/>
- If you are willing to Travel farther into oasis<br/>
there are usually less people at the 2nd pillar. <br/>

&gt; I have reached level 15, I am almost 16.  I have<br/>
&gt; maxed both dual wield and double attack at 80 each. <br/>
&gt; I seem to be having trouble effectively hunting. <br/>
&gt; Anything that cons white to me is always a tough<br/>
&gt; fight that can go either way, so I usually end up<br/>
&gt; sticking to blue critters.  However some blue<br/>
&gt; critters are just to tough to solo.  Lava basilisks<br/>
&gt; are a no-no because of Stone Breath, fire elementals<br/>
&gt; have some kind of damage shield which causes me<br/>
&gt; damage each time I hit so they are a no-no also.  <br/>
&gt; Lavastorm being my preferred hunting area right now.<br/>
&gt;  I tried crocs in Oasis, but it is to crowded when I<br/>
&gt; play (8pm-10pm) for me to even find anything to<br/>
&gt; kill.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess I am at that awkward level and was looking<br/>
&gt; for advice from other warriors on how they got fro<br/>
&gt; 15 to 16.<br/>
