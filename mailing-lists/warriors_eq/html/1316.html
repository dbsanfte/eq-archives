I hate PVP, but the race war server sounds quite<br/>
intriguing.  I&#39;m looking forward to really bonding<br/>
with my &#39;Troll Budders an smashin&#39; da hummies an da<br/>
stunties an da pointie ears gud&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
In PVP, people won&#39;t often work together like you&#39;d<br/>
think they would; you&#39;re not any less likely to be<br/>
PK&#39;d as a low level Troll as with a low level human. <br/>
But on race war, we can band together and fight as<br/>
one.  That just sounds like a lot of roleplaying fun!<br/>
