&gt; you have to gang up to camp.  Sorry that you&#39;re a loner.  My guild needs to be equipped too you know.   None of my members are below 18th level, so it&#39;s not bad twinking, we just want a piece of the pie and camping an area is the only way to do it.  If you want a specific item and can&#39;t find buddies to help you camp, raise money and buy it.  Logistically, raising enough money for a item takes just as much time, plus you get xp.  That&#39;s how a player driven economy works.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry, but i think that&#39;s bullshit.  Show me where i can make 125pp, or<br/>
whatever the going rate for a tomahawk, in 3hrs or whenever he spawns. I&#39;m<br/>
level 20 and usually fight in halfway decent cash areas, but between the<br/>
group, in 3 hours, we usually make only about 8 to 10 plat each. Get your<br/>
guild OUT of the area and go hunt in dungeons and do shit like you&#39;re<br/>
supposed to do. I&#39;m in the Bloodstone Templars, on the Solusek Ro server,<br/>
and we do not camp shit for our lower members.  If we find anyone<br/>
partaking in such dishonorable activities, they risk getting kicked from<br/>
the guild. We DO, however, enjoy going together as a group to obtain the<br/>
items and move on. Why can&#39;t your guild be noble and do the same? <br/>
