<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-761200911">Correct me if Im wrong, and I usually am.<br/>
But what I hear is that warriors get lots more hp,s at higher levs, past 20 <br/>
I belive,<br/>
<br/>
And can rangers wear all types of armor? have same stamina?Might be true <br/>
that ragers kick warrior but at this level.<br/>
What interests me though is what it is like at higher levels.<br/>
<br/>
I play a warrior cus I want to be the fat ass barbarian standing in full <br/>
plate in the front line suckin it all up.<br/>
I want to feel the steel slice through my arms and get beaten to a bloody <br/>
pulp, I want to be the guys that keeps the mobs from walkin all over the <br/>
party, I want to be the one that dies first but did a damn good job trying <br/>
to protect his friends.<br/>
<br/>
If this is possible with a ranger in the same extent as with a warrior,<br/>
then I might change.<br/>

&gt;This past week I decided to take a break from my level 15 dark elf warrior. <br/>
&gt;  I was abit frustrated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I started a half-elf warrior in Kelethin.  It is insanely easy to play <br/>
&gt;there.  I made level 5 in about 3.5 hours.  Then I stopped and tried a wood <br/>
&gt;elf ranger.  Has anyone else played a ranger?  I imagine it is the most <br/>
&gt;poorly balanced of all the hybrids.  After 4 hours I reached level 5 and <br/>
&gt;got kick.  I am now 12-18 hours into the character and almost level 9.  I <br/>
&gt;am just as capable as an equivalent warrior.  Next level I gain an array of <br/>
&gt;spells which will boost my combat effectiveness and allow me to heal.  Part <br/>
&gt;of the easy success is the plethora of low level orcs available a stone&#39;s <br/>
&gt;throw from Kelethin.  With my tracking ability I am never at a loss for <br/>
&gt;targets and I can engage blue con orcs in rapid succession or even 2 at a <br/>
&gt;time. I can even engage and successfully beat yellow con orcs more than 50% <br/>
&gt;of the time and almost always can kill orcs that con even to me without <br/>
&gt;trouble. So far it seems that I get as many hit points now as my warrior <br/>
&gt;did.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My point is, with a ranger class as powerful a combatant as it is I see <br/>
&gt;little necessity for the pure warrior.  I am going to play through to level <br/>
&gt;15 I think, just to see a more even comparison.  My concern is only from a <br/>
&gt;game mechanics perspective though as I have no doubt my playing as a dark <br/>
&gt;elf was a much more rewarding experience.  Has anyone else noticed that the <br/>
&gt;warrior just is not different enough from the hybrid fighter classes?<br/>
