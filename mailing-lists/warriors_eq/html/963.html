<div id="ygrps-yiv-957539600">There is nothing better than life as a barbarian warrior in Norrath! In <br/>
previous lives I have been a Paladin, a Wizard, and a Monk (not here in <br/>
Norrath, but another world/MUD).  There is no better way to experience the <br/>
world that is Norrath than as a warrior deep in the heart of battle.  I have <br/>
no need to role-play, as I live my role every time my group goes out on a <br/>
hunt.  With 500+ hitpoints, two long swords (one combine, the other fine <br/>
steel), and no fear of death, I can think of no better true killing machine <br/>
on the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
  Sure magic users have powerful magic spells that cause a great deal of <br/>
damage in one shot, but it is warrior that must maintain the fight while the <br/>
magic users rest to regain mana or run like frightened rabbits to zone when <br/>
they get hit a couple of times.  A good fight for me is my group geting <br/>
jumped by five of six MoBs, each capable of killing any one of the magic <br/>
users with ease.  I wade into the front and just start hacking and taunting <br/>
until everything is dead in front of me.  Oh sure, I might be down to 5 hit <br/>
points (yes it happens), but the group will always remain alive.<br/>
<br/>
  One day I will lead the attack on that silly dragon camped in Sol B.  No <br/>
other class can truly call themselves a tank, and no other class would be <br/>
stupid enough to led an attack on the dragon and expect to live.<br/>
<br/>

OOC: I played most classes/races during beta and finally selected a <br/>
barbarian warrior.  Role-playing is the best part of this game.  While <br/>
on-line and waiting for something to happen I usually never stay in one <br/>
place and I am always talking, waiting for something to happen.  Drives my <br/>
group crazy, but they view me as a blood crazy Amazon and expect me to <br/>
thirst for death and battle.<br/>
