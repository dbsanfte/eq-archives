<div id="ygrps-yiv-378036151">Personally, i feel that warriors should have a sleeping ability, but not to the extent that all goes black.  It should be just like medditate,  exit when you want, and you can still type, just you can&#39;t see what is going on.  So, a mediate for warriors is the one thing that will help a lot, well thats what i think.  It just takes me too long to get back all that health...<br/>
