<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-619129318">Hi all. I&#39;ve trolled this list a little and you guys all seem to give<br/>
great advice. I was wondering if you could guide a first time EQ player<br/>
on his future...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a level 7 human warrior in Qeynos:<br/>
Max 1H-Slash for my level<br/>
Max Kick for my level<br/>
Max Sense Direction for my level<br/>
30+ Offense<br/>
20+ Defense<br/>
10 or so Bash<br/>
1 in 1H-Bashing<br/>
1 in 2H-Slashing (No weapon yet)<br/>
0 in Hand-to-Hand<br/>
3 in Bind Wounds (I never use it)<br/>
30+ Fishing<br/>
10+ Tailoring (Great combo with the fishing. I make money for the<br/>
patterns)<br/>
<br/>
My question is what skills/weapons should I actively pursue more than<br/>
others?? I&#39;ve guessed so far just from things I&#39;ve read on the net.<br/>
Should I ever put more than one practice in a weapon??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for replies,<br/>
<br/>
