<div id="ygrps-yiv-90213501">Hail!  I am Odhinn MacDoughl, 21st level Barbarian Warrior on the worst =<br/>
server to be a Warrior on, Rallos Zek.  I&#39;ve been seeing ye all chat =<br/>
about the polished granite tomahawks, and I&#39;m here to answer.<br/>
<br/>
1.)  Acquisition:   Gexnor (sp) Mucktail in Highpass, who respawns from =<br/>
half an hour to once a day, carries the tomahawk, but only rarely.  =<br/>
Other times he carries the Cracked Darkwood Shield or other useless =<br/>
items.  Mucktail is always camped.  I waited a week to get my first =<br/>
tommy, and decided to just pay for my second.  I paid 200pp, a =<br/>
reasonable price considering I could level and do other things while =<br/>
some bum waited around for Mucky to come back.<br/>
<br/>
2.) Utilization:   As ye may have inferred above, I have two Tommys.  =<br/>
And god I love them.  The damage isn&#39;t great per hit, but you get alot =<br/>
of hits (6 damage, 26 delay).  It is, of course, a magic item.  But the =<br/>
best best best feature is that it casts Berserker Strength, which has =<br/>
saved my arse more times than I care to admit.  In long melees, it may =<br/>
cast several times, in most melees it will cast just once.  But what it =<br/>
does is amazing for warriors.  +20 STR, -10 AGI, and a little thing =<br/>
called a Magic Shield.  That&#39;s right, a 50-150point Invulnerability to =<br/>
attacks, just like them damn magic users get.  You get this a couple of =<br/>
times in a battle, and you, my friend, are on top of the world, cuz all =<br/>
the enemy damage gets soaked.<br/>
<br/>
So, Tommy&#39;s are A.) Expensive B.) Kickass.   I love &#39;em ;)<br/>
