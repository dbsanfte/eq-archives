<div id="ygrps-yiv-284897608">Hi all, I am a new to this list so if this has been discussed before please <br/>
forgive me.<br/>
I am a lvl 24 woodelf warrior. Beginning to think I&#39;m the only woodelf <br/>
warrior :) I have been kos since the beginning by the Darven City Guards. <br/>
After oh 12-15 kills I left, made my way to Freeport and other places to do <br/>
my levelling. I have swam around to get to unrest but some named npc still <br/>
found me by dags cauldron and whacked me. I now WANT to go home. I want to <br/>
go to mistmoore. Is it something I said, did, didn&#39;t do? They always say <br/>
something like I&#39;m not a believer?? Of What? Can I raise factions? How?<br/>
Really sorry for all the questions but I want to go to my homeland and can <br/>
not, safely anyway. I&#39;m a woodelf for crying out loud, not a dark race.<br/>
Any and all help is greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Tan the homeless woodelf.</div>
