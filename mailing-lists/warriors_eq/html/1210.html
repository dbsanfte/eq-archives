<div id="ygrps-yiv-92021154">I play a 38th halfling warrior on Povar... I have some dam good equipment <br/>
and am one of the higher warriors on the server... But something happened to <br/>
me yesterday that I think highlights the warrior classes weakness... I <br/>
decided I wanted to get that new dragoon&#39;s dirk from Dvinn in Crushbone... <br/>
So I went there, camped in his room, for those of you that dont know, Dvinn <br/>
is about a 25th level DE that is very tough.... He spawned and I attacked <br/>
him... low and behold a wizzie... AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE.... ran into the <br/>
room, and started blasting him!  Guess what? AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE STOLE <br/>
DVINN FROM A 38TH LEVEL WARRIOR!!!!!  Do I need to say ANYTHING else? btw I <br/>
was using a zweildahander.... This was the most embarassing thing that has <br/>
ever happened to me... I&#39;m sitting there in almost full rubicite, all these <br/>
cool items, everyone is looking at me... and then i have the thing stolen <br/>
from me by ONE, not a group, but ONE 18th level wizzie......grumbles <br/>
something about warriors suck and I am ready to cancel my account...<br/>
