&gt; Hey all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was just wondering if any of you had any cool info on Mistmoore. Ive never<br/>
&gt; been there and was thinking about venturing over there. i hear there are a<br/>
&gt; lot of good mid to high range MOBS there. Is this place usualy packed? Any<br/>
&gt; good magical items to be found in here? Any info would be much appreciated<br/>
&gt; before i make the long walk over there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
