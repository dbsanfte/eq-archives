<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Want to know something hard to find.  Medium Bronze.  I am a lvl 13 warrior half elf.  More medium bronze should be added to the game.  Hmmm, 25p or less for each piece of small bronze, except for the breast plate, 45p.  Also easy to get.  Medium bronze, 60p for each piece, probally 60p+ for tunic.  I am sorry, but at my lvl, that money is hard to come by, but not as hard as the armor.  What really drives me up the wall is when I see lvl 7 guys with full medium bronze, their excuse, either someone gave it to them, or they have been reselling armor ( A lvl 7 with lots of medium Bronze told me he had made 300p offa reselling, and had 1000p coming from a friend, so he could start Smithing.)  Jeez.<br/>
