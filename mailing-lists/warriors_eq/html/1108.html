<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644148713">In the future please mark *spoiler* before you give out the information<br/>
for these lore items.  Some people just don&#39;t want to know where to<br/>
get these things :)<br/>
<br/>
Now to answer your question about Drosco.  <br/>
<br/>
Warning *spoiler*.....scroll down to find out what quest Drosco is <br/>
connected to.<br/>

Seems like ol&#39; Drosco was a member of the Bloodsabers<br/>
(the group in the sewers that worships Bertox).  One of the<br/>
NPCs in the Shrine of Bertox in the sewers will tell you that<br/>
Drosco has been leading the guards to the Shrine and that<br/>
he must be killed.  I believe you return the letter or the <br/>
amulet to the NPC to solve the quest.  Note that this will<br/>
only work for evil aligned characters.  If you are good, you<br/>
will have NO chance to make it to the Shrine.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t know if everyone knows about this but I&#39;ll post it just in case.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Drosco in the Qeynos aquiducts has a +5 to char medal on him,and he is an <br/>
&gt; easy kill. Prob lev 8 or so. It is a lore item though, so you will not be <br/>
&gt; able to get more than one. It is better to enter the sewers in the pool<br/>
&gt; near <br/>
&gt; the qeynos bank, that is closer to his spawn.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is also a nesting rat down there that has a gold necklace +3 to <br/>
&gt; charisma. I don&#39;t know what quest it is related to, but it is not a lore <br/>
&gt; item so you could prob get more than one (not sure), anyway the rat is a <br/>
&gt; very easy kill.  Prob lev 4-6.  If anyone knows what quest this is for<br/>
&gt; send <br/>
&gt; me a post,  curious.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just for everyones information.....<br/>
