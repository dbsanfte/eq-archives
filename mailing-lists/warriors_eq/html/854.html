<div id="ygrps-yiv-156922340">I achieved level 10 with my Ranger last night and found something quite disturbing.<br/>
I gained a +4 damage bonus.  Very odd as I never got one up to level 15 with my warrior, who by all accounts should be the recipient of any damage bonuses.<br/>
<br/>
This might have something to do with the patch this week so I am going to log in as my warrior tonight and experiment.<br/>
<br/>
This is the fact.  My Fine steel 2 handed sword has a damage of 12 and delay of 43.  I normally hit for 21 damage with it.  2 days ago I bought a purity belt boosting my str from 80 to 82.  I did not notice any damage change.  Last night within minutes of levelling up to 10 I started hitting for max damage of 25.  <br/>
<br/>
Any one know anything about this?</div>
