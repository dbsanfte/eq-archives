absorption element for different armors.  Rather, their relative damage<br/>
absorption and protective effects are stored in the AC value.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This analysis is just plain... well... half-baked.  The reason you begin<br/>
to get savaged without armor is because your AC has dropped by some<br/>
obscene value.<br/>
<br/>
The difference here is not the &#39;type&#39; of armor, but the AC difference.<br/>
Thus, if you could find cloth-looking armor with a better AC than plate,<br/>
it would behoove you to wear it.<br/>
<br/>
This is why you see bare-sleeved high level players... They&#39;re wearing<br/>
cloth-looking armor with _higher_ AC than either Plate or Rubicite.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; PLATE IS WORTH IT. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>AC equivalents to Plate are worth just as much as Plate itself.  You only<br/>
need the AC of Plate, not the &#39;look&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Just going to do two examples:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lizardscale cloak vs. Bronze Cloak<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would _definitely_ use the Lizardscale Cloak.  It is Plate with stat<br/>
modifiers.<br/>
<br/>
Another common item that _is_ better than Plate would be the Thick Leather<br/>
Apron, which is both lighter and has equivalent or better AC than a Plate<br/>
Girdle.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts.<br/>
