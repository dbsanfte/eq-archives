<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313787329">Hail Norrath!<br/>
<br/>
	This weekend has been probably the worst as<br/>
	far as death is concerned, but it was the most<br/>
	hilarious.<br/>
<br/>
	Friday Eve:<br/>
	My party, which consists of a Wizard, Enchantress,<br/>
	and myself, a warrior, were headed for the Beholder<br/>
	Maze to fight minotaurs and muddite elders. On the<br/>
	way through East Karana, we came across a bandit<br/>
	camp with a named NPC.  Besides the one with the<br/>
	name there were 6 others, two conning blue and the<br/>
	rest green.  The enchantress charms one of the <br/>
	bandits and the rest come after us, except for the<br/>
	named NPC.  We finish off the bandits rather quickly<br/>
	then attack the last one (I will give out the name to<br/>
	those who ask).  <br/>
<br/>
	Well after a very short fight we remove his items and<br/>
	find a staff segment and a key, both lore items.  Great,<br/>
	they must be part of a quest!  After healing a little <br/>
	and regenerating mana, we decided to kill him again so<br/>
	that each of us can have a key and staff segment.  We<br/>
	recover two bronze weapons in the process and go off<br/>
	on our merry way.<br/>
<br/>
	Saturday Eve:  <br/>
	We found out what to do with the key, but not until one<br/>
	of our party membes gives it to the wrong person.  No<br/>
	problem, we&#39;ll just go get another one.  So back to the<br/>
	bandit camp.  Besides two bandits there is a brigand<br/>
	(never seen one there before) and the named NPC. Our<br/>
	enchantress charms one of the spell casting bandits and<br/>
	guess what?  All of them come, and we dispatch them <br/>
	without a problem leaving only the named NPC.  Our <br/>
	enchantress says &#39;Now (the named NPC)&#39;.  I take out my<br/>
	trusty bow and whack! <br/>
<br/>
	a (named NPC) says hit for 9 non melee damage.<br/>
	A (named NPC) begins to cast a spell<br/>
	Your body convulsves as lightning arcs through your body.<br/>
	A (named NPC) begins to cast a spell<br/>
	Your skin combusts.<br/>
<br/>
	By this time he has come into melee range.<br/>
<br/>
	A (named NPC) hits you for 28 damage.<br/>
	A (named NPC) hits you for 15 damage.<br/>
<br/>
	To see the least, he killed me and the Enchantress.  The<br/>
	wizard was able to escape to the zone.  One of the named <br/>
	NPC spells took away 2 bubbles of my health, which is <br/>
	almost 200 hit points.  <br/>
<br/>
	After we regroup, we find out that our Wizard had expended <br/>
	all his mana on the previous fight and wasn&#39;t able to tell us<br/>
	before I engaged with the named NPC.  Thus, we both died.<br/>
<br/>
	Now we go back for our revenge.  We initiate combat with the<br/>
	bandits, but this time the named NPC decides to join in!  (he<br/>
	never has done this before).  Well this time the wizard and <br/>
	myself die while the enchantress escapes.  I get the message<br/>
	&#39;Welcome to Level 15!&#39;   <br/>
<br/>
	Have we learned our lesson yet?  Not yet!  We go back for the<br/>
	third time.  There is only the named NPC and two bandits. <br/>
	Shouldn&#39;t be a problem.  This time our Enchantress charms<br/>
	the named NPC and we quickly dispatch the remaining bandits.<br/>
	Think we got our revenge?  We did, until a griffawn comes <br/>
	up behind the enchantress and attacks.  Well the named NPC <br/>
	is still charmed so he starts hitting the griffawn along with<br/>
	myself.  About half way through the battle the charm wears off.<br/>
	One second the enchantress has a full bar of health, the next<br/>
	second she is lying on the ground dead.  The wizards health <br/>
	goes from full to half before another spell casting bandit spawns.<br/>
	I watch in horrow as my hit points dwindle away to half while still<br/>
	fighting the griffawn.  About this time the wizard is trying to gate<br/>
	while being hit hard by both the named NPC and the other bandit.<br/>
	I watch his health go down to one bubble then turn and start<br/>
running,<br/>
	the griffawn on my heels.  I make it to the gorge and turn to finish<br/>
<br/>
	the griffawn with two bubbles of health.<br/>
<br/>
	Whew that was close!  It was a good thing I didn&#39;t attack either<br/>
bandit.<br/>
	Wrong!!  Doesn&#39;t matter if I attacked them or not, here they come<br/>
over <br/>
	the hill.  Suffice to say I died yet again.<br/>
<br/>
	We have decided to give the bandits a WIDE berth anytime we are <br/>
	traveling through East Karana.<br/>
