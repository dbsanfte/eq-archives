<div id="ygrps-yiv-201338167">I have to disagree about the damage absobtion. Monks and warriors can have <br/>
similar AC, but the monk will take more damage from the same mob becuase he <br/>
dose not have the DR (damage reduction) that a warrior has. 2nd is studded <br/>
leather, which has the same stats (visible that is AC and wieght) as regular <br/>
lether bit has better DR than regular leather.<br/>

&gt; &gt; AC IS NOT EVERYTHING!  AC is the second half, and the lesser half, of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the armor system in Everquest.  The first half is damage absorption.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;According to Verant, AC _is_ everything.  There is no &#39;intrinsic&#39; damage<br/>
&gt;absorption element for different armors.  Rather, their relative damage<br/>
&gt;absorption and protective effects are stored in the AC value.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Each level of armor absorbs more damage than the levels before it.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt; you doubt, try it.  Fight something on your level naked and see how<br/>
&gt; &gt; badly you get hit; every shot will come in at max damage.  Put your<br/>
&gt; &gt; armor back on and see shots hitting for 2, 5, etc...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This analysis is just plain... well... half-baked.  The reason you begin<br/>
&gt;to get savaged without armor is because your AC has dropped by some<br/>
&gt;obscene value.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The difference here is not the &#39;type&#39; of armor, but the AC difference.<br/>
&gt;Thus, if you could find cloth-looking armor with a better AC than plate,<br/>
&gt;it would behoove you to wear it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is why you see bare-sleeved high level players... They&#39;re wearing<br/>
&gt;cloth-looking armor with _higher_ AC than either Plate or Rubicite.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; PLATE IS WORTH IT.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;AC equivalents to Plate are worth just as much as Plate itself.  You only<br/>
&gt;need the AC of Plate, not the &#39;look&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just going to do two examples:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; lizardscale cloak vs. Bronze Cloak<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would _definitely_ use the Lizardscale Cloak.  It is Plate with stat<br/>
&gt;modifiers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Another common item that _is_ better than Plate would be the Thick Leather<br/>
&gt;Apron, which is both lighter and has equivalent or better AC than a Plate<br/>
&gt;Girdle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just some thoughts.<br/>
