<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-496277683">I am going back to North Ro now that I have finally reached the 12th Rank <br/>
of Barbarian Warrior.  Hopefully soon I will have enougth plat to afford my <br/>
dream weapon of a combine long sword (I have 10 plat now).<br/>
   Any good suggestions for hunting in and around Freeport?  Didn&#39;t like <br/>
befallen to much since I don&#39;t have a magic weapon yet.  Kind of a bummer <br/>
when you have to run from a skel that cons blue since I can&#39;t hit him.<br/>
   Haven&#39;t been down to see Troll Town yet.  Wonder if it is worth the trip?<br/>
<br/>
For the Honor and Glory of Rellos Zek;<br/>
