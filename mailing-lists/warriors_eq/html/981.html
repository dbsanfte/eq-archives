<b>Subject:</b> Surprise at the Barbarians Warrior Guild. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-531458260">I am Thuxtis the Mighty, a Gnome Warrior who recently arrived in Halas<br/>
for some cold weather adventuring with his guild.  After a lot of great<br/>
hunting, I returned to Halas to drop coin and loot, and decided to stop<br/>
at the Warrior guild to be sure that they would train him.  Thuxtis had<br/>
recently made 14th level and was eagery looking forward to the magical<br/>
15th.<br/>
<br/>
So there I am at the guild (and yes they will train gnmoes), I just<br/>
happened to look down the list of skills to train and I see:<br/>
<br/>
Dual Wield<br/>
No Charge<br/>
<br/>
Huh? Thuxtis rubs his eyes and looks again.<br/>
<br/>
Dual Wield<br/>
No Charge<br/>
<br/>
Well, You don&#39;t have to tell Thuxtis three times, so i reach up and<br/>
click on it, then press the practice button.  &quot;Your Skill in Dual Wield<br/>
has Gone up&quot;. Awesome... practice, practice, practice, practice.<br/>
<br/>
How did this little gem of a change slip through?  My friend Ramkota<br/>
informed me this morning that at 13th he could practice it.  <br/>
<br/>
So the Moral of the story is for all you 13-14 level warriors (and it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t hurt for the 12th to try as well), grab a SOW and RUN to the<br/>
nearest guild to grab this skill.<br/>
