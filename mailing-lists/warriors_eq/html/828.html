<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185471319">I completely agree with you. I hate this type of play from people who, by simply<br/>
moving on, could make the game a lot better for everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
There are some great ideas in this thread. I have a couple of thoughts on the<br/>
subject also:<br/>
<br/>
First, there are currently no level restrictions in this game. Why? Nothing<br/>
ticks me off more than to see a low level character running around in full<br/>
banded with some awesome weapon ... it practically SCREAMS of twinking. On any<br/>
other game you play of this type there is usually a level restriction. Something<br/>
like, not being able to hold or use the weapon unless you are that level, or not<br/>
being able to save it when you log off or die. Please, please, please .... get<br/>
this into Everquest.<br/>
<br/>
Second, how about some sort of flag for an ultra rare item. If you have one ...<br/>
you cannot have another (unless you lose/sell the first). It may not fix<br/>
everything, but if a small group is camping for objects ... they WILL eventually<br/>
have to leave to get rid of them because they wouldn&#39;t be able to hold more.<br/>
This would limit those people running around and grabbing 5 rare items during<br/>
one super farming session ... just to sell  them off. It&#39;s not so much the<br/>
farming that would be helped, it would be the reduction of the lines at the camp<br/>
sites.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents on the subject...<br/>

&gt; A solution to camping shouldn&#39;t be to complicated.<br/>
&gt; A high level magic weapon spawning on a unique NPC cannot spawn if the item<br/>
&gt; exists in the &quot;spawn area&quot; AND the item must be initiated by a quest.<br/>
&gt; Unique NPCs should also spawn in a random location in the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Farming is the main problem....I think. I have no respect for farmers.  If<br/>
&gt; they won&#39;t take turns on rare spawn item I will kill-steal it.  I am a<br/>
&gt; dark-elf after all.  I don&#39;t necessarily like doing this, but when a group<br/>
&gt; has been farming a spot for days and refuses to share the spawns there isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really any option.  So when the creature spawns....my group attacks it.  We<br/>
&gt; try to get it first and then accuse them of kill-stealing...which is true<br/>
&gt; depending on your perspective.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just think that farmers ruin the spirit of the game.  I never camp a rare<br/>
&gt; spawn item for more than an hour or 2 spawns whichever comes first.  I<br/>
&gt; respect those who camp a spot so they can have that awesome weapon they<br/>
&gt; really want but can&#39;t afford....but I depise those who camp a spot so they<br/>
&gt; can sell the items.  It just isn&#39;t in the spirit of the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just my opinion.  I know some of you won&#39;t approve of my method of dealing<br/>
&gt; with farmers, and you are entitled to that.<br/>
