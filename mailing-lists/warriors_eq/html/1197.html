<div id="ygrps-yiv-822040281">Thats what I said.  The warriors can do two things better than any other<br/>
class:  be a sponge, and die.  A ranger, paladin, and shadowknight can dish<br/>
out just as much damage, at higher levels.  <br/>

&gt; A sponge only absorbs damage. You can dish it out. No, you can&#39;t hit<br/>
&gt; for 1100 in one shot but there&#39;s a point to that. Yes, you should be<br/>
&gt; able to absorb more punishment than any other class, and you can. And<br/>
&gt; yes, you can deal out a fair amount of damage, arguably the best of the<br/>
&gt; melee classes. (Though yes that gap narrows at higher levels)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually, I&#39;m going to leave this thread alone from here on out. I see<br/>
&gt; this thread in every friggin mail list related to class. The wizards<br/>
&gt; think they are getting ripped, warriors too, enchanters, mages and<br/>
&gt; bards...well bards may have a point. Everyone complains about their<br/>
&gt; class and how another class is better.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The point of these lists, if I&#39;m not mistaken is to exchange strategies<br/>
&gt; and means of development, NOT whine about your desires for the class.<br/>
&gt; That is not to say that such discussion shouldn&#39;t happen. I just don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think it should be in this forum. I get tired of reading notes from<br/>
&gt; each of the class lists that I subscribe to and 1/2 of the content<br/>
&gt; contains complaints about the class and how everyone needs to petition<br/>
&gt; verant. (The cleric list seems to be the exception, they seem quite<br/>
&gt; happy with their class. Uh oh, that must mean they are overbalanced!<br/>
&gt; &lt;sg&gt;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;dismounts the soapbox&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Wait until you get your warrior past the newbie<br/>
&gt; &gt; stages (somewhere around<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 20).  At level 15, I can already see a<br/>
&gt; &gt; difference, even in a group,<br/>
&gt; &gt; that lets me know that I am one thing only:  a<br/>
&gt; &gt; sponge.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; Angarth,  Sponge of the 15th Tier<br/>
