making a whole new island south of faydwer area...the new race of lizardmen<br/>

&gt; Is it just me or do we need more areas in the game ... a couple of new<br/>
&gt; zones<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t hurt. It MIGHT help with camping but then again ... it might not.<br/>
&gt; I was<br/>
&gt; in Befallen the other night and I swear I couldn&#39;t see a single skelton<br/>
&gt; for the<br/>
&gt; first floor and a half. (If you&#39;ve never been there it&#39;s like wall to wall<br/>
&gt; skeletons.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I hear you brother .... hopefully someone at Verant will notice<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; attempt to fix the situation in some way. Something like a high level mob<br/>
&gt; spawn<br/>
&gt; on top of a camping group would suit me just fine.  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hmmm I am really starting to hate campers.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I use to take camping with a grain of salt and just move on.  This is<br/>
&gt; now<br/>
&gt; &gt; becoming IMPOSSIBLE for me at my level to do.  Let me recite a little<br/>
&gt; story.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I login on Saturday starting out in lake rathe, camped.  Not to fussed<br/>
&gt; since<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can not pull the aviaks anyway, only CASTERS can.  Whats up with that?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I moved on to the Egret Aviaks, CAMPED.  hmmm no problem lets try HH,<br/>
&gt; both<br/>
&gt; &gt; ends camped. sigh, oh well im near Neriak I can head home to stock up<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; try out lesser faydark and Mistmoore.  On the boat I get, I arrive in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mistmoore for the first time, thought the place was pretty cool.<br/>
&gt; Learned<br/>
&gt; &gt; the easier areas pretty quick and start pulling for my group.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wow this is going pretty well.  Hmmm zone went from 2 groups to 5<br/>
&gt; groups.<br/>
&gt; &gt; One group SIITING on the gargoyle spawn, another group hogging THE whole<br/>
&gt; &gt; graveyard, and the third, this is the best, the third camping the<br/>
&gt; CORRIDOR<br/>
&gt; &gt; between the easy side of Mistmoore to the hard side of Mistmoore.  I<br/>
&gt; mean<br/>
&gt; &gt; C&#39;MON.  Thats just RUDE.  Everytime we tried to pull some tuffer mobs<br/>
&gt; &gt; through the corridor their mages pets went berserk and they effectively<br/>
&gt; took<br/>
&gt; &gt; all the kills.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; SIGH<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I remember when lake rathe was empty.  I remember when HH was empty.  Is<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; just because most people on the server are my level ?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; People just DONT understand that a spawn can only support SO many<br/>
&gt; groups.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh, a word of warning, NEVER take a caster to the Aviaks In Lake Rathe,<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; wont leave.  I know a few of my friends who I didn&#39;t see until they made<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 25.  They just would not leave that easy xp area.  I hate it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ARGH!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ahhh I feel much better now, thanks for listening.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I will be starting a new character on MM just to see if its a little<br/>
&gt; better<br/>
&gt; &gt; WAY behind the pack.  Lets hope it is.<br/>
