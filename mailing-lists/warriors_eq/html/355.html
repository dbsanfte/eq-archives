&gt; Hey vash,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You are on sol ro right? what would you say about a full set of bronze<br/>
&gt; plate? And no this isnt a joke...ive got 3 sets...one im using, one in bank<br/>
&gt; and other extra on my char....i get them off stuff i kill....and i dont need<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heya, I&#39;m a level 18 drow warrior on Sol. Ro, and I also have a level 19<br/>
druid char.  I could really use a set of bronze plate if you were<br/>
willing to sell it for a reasonable price. If you remember back in the<br/>
late teens in level, cash is sorta tight.  I also played in beta on The<br/>
Rathe server as a druid and got my char up to 19 in p4.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much!<br/>
<br/>
