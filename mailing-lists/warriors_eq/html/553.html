&gt;&gt;&gt;Uh ... ok.  If you say so.  I call Paladins &#39;self-filling tanks&#39;,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;because they are just that.  They&#39;re not really effective until they<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;get Meditate at 12th, but once there they can do a solo fight that<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;drags them down to 1 bar of HP; and be back in another fight in 7-10<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;mins.  For a corresponding warrior, it would be 13-18 mins, or more.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The game isn&#39;t based upon solo play, and after about 20th lvl you basically can&#39;t solo.  So whats it matter if a 12th lvl paladin has a few minutes quicker recovery at LOW level.  I never fought solo past about 9 anyways.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Lay On Hands is the Panic Button; you can push it to get out of jail,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;or at least, have more time to either finish off the mob or run for<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;safety. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with you there.  But at high 20s anybody can go get a pair of Jboots and have a continual free non-class specific get outta jail free card.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;As for the spells being 9 levels behind, so?  Paladins are<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;fighter/healers, while Clerics are healer/fighters.  Clerics can be<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;mini-tanks up until about 9th or 10th; but Paladins can tank all the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;way to 50.  The ability to tank and still have a reserve to compliment<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;the party&#39;s cleric is useful.  Past 10th, Clerics are 80%+ casters for<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;all realistic intents and purposes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Paladins don&#39;t have the HP of a warrior, so they can&#39;t tank as long.  They don&#39;t have their dodge/parry/reposte are several levels behind a warrior, meaning they never get those skills as high as a warrior of the same level.  Add that in with their lesser HP and there is a huge difference.  Ok, so the paladin can help heal himself after a fight.....whooptee, if he were a fighter he wouldn&#39;t have so much to be healed anyways.  not like a 25 point heal at 25th lvl is going to do much anyways.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Paladins don&#39;t get Kick; but at 6th they get bash which I personally<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;like much better.  Kick won&#39;t interrupt casting, while Bash will.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;stopped using Kick with my Troll Warrior when I got Bash (which let my<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Slam start being much more effective)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found kick to be almost as good as bash, you&#39;d be suprised at how often a 15 point kick will disrupt a caster.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;If you&#39;re fixated on Dual Wield (which I think you might be, since you<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;mentioned Rangers; and they&#39;re the only hybrid, that I recall, that<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;gets Dual Wield); that might explain why you like Warriors and Rangers<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;the most.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not fixated on dual wield.  I&#39;m maxed on both my 1h slash and 2h slash, depending on the toughness of the monster I&#39;m fighting I&#39;ll switch.  Being able to use both is a tremenous advantage, IMO.  Dual wield fast weapons when fighting yellow or reds, wield hard hitting 2h when whites or blues.  And of course being able to use both means you have access to more of the good weapons.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Personally, I think the jury&#39;s still out on Dual Wield, and on melee in<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;general.  The further up you go, the more the offensive and debuff<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;spellcasters really carry the fight to the mobs; the tanks are just<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;there to do what their name says.  If this is proven out, then Dueal<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Wield or no, the tanks are just there to soak damage.  If this is not<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;proven, then Dual Wield still has to debate against the endless fighter<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;arguements of Dual Wield vs 2H Weapons (which is one of those semantic<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;arguements, IMO; stats bear each out)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>EXACTALLY warriors tank, paladins attempt to tank.  The damage either deals is minimal, both are in the party for one reason....to keep the casters alive long enough to kill the mobs.  So what would be better, a tank that can absorb all the damage with fewer heals required by the cleric, or a semi-tank that requires more heals from the cleric, thus more of a chance the monster will jump the cleric?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;For grouping, I&#39;d prefer to have pure tank in the tank slot, any day of<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;the week; with a Paladin fighting alongside him.  (my ideal 6man group<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;is 2 Warriors, 1 Paladin, 1 Cleric, 1 Wizard, 1 Bard; haven&#39;t assembled<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;it yet, but it sounds fun!) For soloing, however, the Paladin is more<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;efficient than the Warrior.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>2 tanks, why do you need a paladin?  More than 2 fighter types in a party is over kill.  Try to hook up with 2 warriors, cleric, shaman, 2 wizards.  Warriors tank, cleric buffs and heals, shaman buffs debuffs and provides backup heals if needed, wizards nuke....works great.<br/>
<br/>
btw, I&#39;ve only seen 2 shamans that were worth a crap.....they actually use their buff debuff spells well, all the rest I&#39;ve seen spend all their mana on their little frost spell....SHAMANS ARE NOT NUKERS.....bah.....but thats another story....<br/>
<br/>
But to sum up, paladins sacrifice so much melee ability for so little casting ability which completly overlays the clerics role.  Sure, at lower levels the paladin may be better solo, but A)  he levels slower than a warrior, and B) after about 20th lvl you arn&#39;t going to be soloing much of anything anyways.<br/>
