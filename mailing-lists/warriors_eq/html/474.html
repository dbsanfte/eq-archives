What we need is a reason to congregate in a tavern and tell stories that<br/>
would also benifit out character. I suggest adding Gambling. Think about it,<br/>
gambling has been around for centuries in one form or another. Players could<br/>
gather around an NPC to play against the house or Players could carry a (EQ<br/>
theme) Deck or cup of dice to play against other chars at any time or place.<br/>
They already have something that is close to what would be needed and that<br/>
is the trade screen. Players could place the bets in a slot, click ok, and<br/>
then the dice would throw or a card is drawn and whoever wins would<br/>
automaticaly win the bet. If they wanted to take it further, they could<br/>
implement gambling as a skill, making the chances greater for the higher<br/>
skill ya have(not sure about all the implications there though)<br/>
I have been tossing around this idead since beta and I think it would be<br/>
great to draw us together for drinks(if you are drunk maybe gambling skill<br/>
is affected some way) and get us telling stories and maybe even make (or<br/>
lose) a few plat.<br/>
What do ya think? <br/>
