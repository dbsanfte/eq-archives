&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a bit lost as to where I should be hunting right now.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I have reached level 15, I am almost 16.  I have maxed both dual wield and<br/>
&gt; double attack at 80 each.  I seem to be having trouble effectively<br/>
&gt; hunting.  Anything that cons white to me is always a tough fight that can<br/>
&gt; go either way, so I usually end up sticking to blue critters.  However<br/>
&gt; some blue critters are just to tough to solo.  Lava basilisks are a no-no<br/>
&gt; because of Stone Breath, fire elementals have some kind of damage shield<br/>
&gt; which causes me damage each time I hit so they are a no-no also.<br/>
&gt; Lavastorm being my preferred hunting area right now.  I tried crocs in<br/>
&gt; Oasis, but it is to crowded when I play (8pm-10pm) for me to even find<br/>
&gt; anything to kill.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I guess I am at that awkward level and was looking for advice from other<br/>
&gt; warriors on how they got fro 15 to 16.<br/>
