<div id="ygrps-yiv-430779845">Just to make it clear, im not taking sides here, just wanted to add<br/>
my 2c.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Paladins don&#39;t have the HP of a warrior, so they<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They&#39;re not so far behind. I&#39;ve heard the number 25% less mentioned a<br/>
&gt; few times; if true, it&#39;s significant, but not massively so.  25% of 100<br/>
&gt; is only 25, which isn&#39;t very much from a high level mob.  25% of 1000<br/>
&gt; is 250, which is a larger number (but still the same fraction); but,<br/>
&gt; again, 250 isn&#39;t so terribly much when considered against the damage<br/>
&gt; output of a high level mob.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think its bigger difference than you think, and as the levels go higher<br/>
the divergence is greater, it may start at 25% but it the gap DOES get<br/>
bigger.  Example compare my level 21 DE Warrior to my friends level 30 WE<br/>
ranger;<br/>
<br/>
I have 630hp (aprox) he has aprox 750 (with buff 800 and something).  Theres<br/>
a 9 Level difference between us and I am not that far behind.  This gap just<br/>
keeps getting bigger the higher I get.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Warriors would be better off if bandages weren&#39;t so *damn* expensive,<br/>
&gt; IMO.  Bandages should go for 1sp each; they&#39;re just rags that&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; washed and sterilized in hot water, after all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Agreed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Examples:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Warriors have to pair with a Cleric (or any mage subclass with healing<br/>
&gt; spells, or even a Paladin, who also has healing); because otherwise the<br/>
&gt; downtime after fights will catch up with them.  Even pairing with other<br/>
&gt; Warriors, or with Wizards/Magicians won&#39;t work around this; Warriors<br/>
&gt; will have to have a healer present to counteract their innate<br/>
&gt; disadvantage of requiring healing at the higher levels.  SKs are in<br/>
&gt; this boat too; they get tricks, but no heals; and so need the healing<br/>
&gt; too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is not the case for me.  Since level 12 I have consistently been<br/>
pairing with a wizard friend, my down time is nearly non-existent because I<br/>
just keep the mobs attention while the wizard blasts.  I am his &quot;pet&quot;<br/>
effectively :)  Warrior and Wizard are a VERY good combo.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; But to sum up, paladins sacrifice so much melee<br/>
&gt; &gt; ability for so little casting ability which<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m confused where you&#39;re getting this &#39;sacrifice so much melee<br/>
&gt; ability&#39; thing from?  Paladin combat skills are level with Warriors&#39;. <br/>
&gt; The only main difference is at which point a particular skill shows up<br/>
&gt; (no kick or dual wield, and everything else 3-5 levels after the<br/>
&gt; Warrior receives it), and the lower hps.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Paladin combat skills even maxed are 5 points less than a warrior, their not<br/>
equal in the martial skills.  I dont know how much of a difference 5 points<br/>
is, but my 12th level warrior was a MUCH stronger fighter than my 12th level<br/>
Paladin.  Then again that just maybe my perception (and bias).</div>
