<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061773125">Ouch.. if he warrior class can be looked at seriously and improved then<br/>
the petiton has served it&#39;s purpose. The extent of the change in<br/>
relation to what has been proposed is another thing.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure other classes will gripe after the warrior class is looked at<br/>
and changed, but that is the nature of change. Once one things change<br/>
you have to look and see how it has affected other things.<br/>

Just MHO,<br/>

&gt; warrior are worse than the SKs, pallys, and rangers.  But if you do<br/>
&gt; much to the warriors you guys will be able to blow us away.  I&#39;m a<br/>
&gt; troll SK and my guys is mainly a warrior with a few spells.  If you do<br/>
&gt; all these things you people have listed to the warrior class then<br/>
&gt; warriors will be a super class, be reasonable.  Ask for some small<br/>
&gt; changes.  Not letting their skills increase at 6 a lvl and go up to<br/>
&gt; 300 AND ask for weapon specialization.  A warrior would outdamage a gd<br/>
&gt; WIZARD!  You people are crazy if you except them to make that kind of<br/>
&gt; change. </span></blockquote></div>
