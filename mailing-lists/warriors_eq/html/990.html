Crushbone is the home to the Crushbone Orcs &lt;../beastiary/orc.html&gt; . This<br/>
zone is located in Greater Faydark &lt;greaterfay.html&gt; . If you are coming<br/>
from Felwithe &lt;felwithe.html&gt;  you can hug the zone edge to the right. When<br/>
you see the fires in the distance you will realize you have come to the<br/>
entrance to Crushbone. This dungeon is designed for characters 5-15 with the<br/>
castle area holding some mobs to please characters in the low 20&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
There are several major portions of this zone. The front area(near the<br/>
entrance) is designed for lower level characters and contains mostly low<br/>
level monsters(5-8). Up on top of the hill you can find some monsters in the<br/>
8-12 level range. To the left of the entrance and over the bridge you will<br/>
see what looks like a small hill. Beyond that hill leads to the mine area.<br/>
The monsters back here range in the 8-10 level range. If you were to turn<br/>
right at the entrance and follow the wall you would be led to Crushbone<br/>
Castle. This contains the meaty monsters. You will find many mobs level 8-15<br/>
inside of the castle. You will also find most of the name NPC&#39;s at the<br/>
castle area. The emporer and the ambassador are by far the highest level<br/>
mobs at Crushbone(levels 18 and 19ish). <br/>
<br/>
Crushbone is the originating point of at least two different quests. These<br/>
are the Crushbone Belts/Shoulderpads Quest &lt;../quest/crushbelts.html&gt;  and<br/>
the Screaming Mace Quest &lt;../quest/screamingmace.html&gt; . There are several<br/>
good magic items to be found in this zone as well.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;end clip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To get there would be quite a chore for you - I&#39;d think - how well can you<br/>
swim?<br/>
<br/>
There is a secret way to get under the city of Freeport and I think you can<br/>
get onto the docks there.  The dock guards seem to be indifferent to many<br/>
kinds of travelers.  Take the boat across and sneak thru or around some<br/>
other cities.  If hummies no like you, I bet the elffies no gonna like u<br/>
much either.<br/>
