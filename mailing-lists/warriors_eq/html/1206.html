You know me as Aelyn the ranger but I also have a dark elf warrior.<br/>
Faction is very tough to improve. I have killed enough orcs to allow myself<br/>
freedom to move around in freeport.<br/>
<br/>
But what you are trying to overcome is not simply faction, it is racial<br/>
hatred.  It is noble of you to try and overcome the basic mistrust and<br/>
hatred that the Feir&#39;dal have for the Tier&#39;dal, but I know of no way you<br/>
could reverse that basic hatred all wood elves have for dark elves.<br/>
