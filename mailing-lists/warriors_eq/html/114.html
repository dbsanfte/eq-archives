<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071980006">Barb Warrior looking up at 20th from close range, looking to upgrade<br/>
dualign weapons.  Got a pair of mino axes, which are nice, but heavy and<br/>
slow.  Seen the stats on the Barbed Leather Whip and it looks perfect.<br/>
I know it&#39;s from befallen, but most likely in an area I can not get to.<br/>
Is it possible to find these weapons for sale inside this zone by higher<br/>
levels just selling off there loot for weight?  If so what is a fair<br/>
price for one? Also what are some other good dualing weapons? heard of a<br/>
crystaline sword that sounds just sweet, but no idea where that one<br/>
comes from.<br/>
