<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235018451">No.  I am trying to get into Kelethin.  The Wood Elf city.  Getting into the <br/>
human towns is easy.  I just need to get some people together and slay one of <br/>
those stupid Paladins.  I have no use for them anyway.  Then, the corrupt <br/>
guards will like me, and I&#39;ll have no problems.  Dwarves are already on <br/>
pretty good terms with me, if I go kill some goblins, it&#39;ll get beter.  But <br/>
right now, I want to become friendly with the elves, and the game is <br/>
programmed to not let me do that.</div>
