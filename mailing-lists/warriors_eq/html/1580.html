I have a 30th level barbarian warrior on Veeshan. I can only tell you<br/>
what I&#39;ve chosen<br/>
Max out 1hs, 2hs, taunt, kick, slam/bash  and I am working on archery<br/>
(this has helped me take down runners).<br/>
<br/>
Some have said take up piercing. When you get duel attack and duel weild<br/>
only for the fact that a piercing weapon is faster and will help max<br/>
these skills out.<br/>
<br/>
I find that 1hs with duel weild is more effective in certain<br/>
circumstances and then 2hs in another. 1hs gives you speed of attack.<br/>
2hs is good for greatest impact (recently got a crit hit of 100.. now<br/>
that was sweet). If you use a 2hs or 1hs will also depend on your group<br/>
make up. I do carry all my weapons with me so at times will switch<br/>
depending on the circumstance.<br/>
<br/>
All my reading and such have said to keep both maxed out. Some reasons<br/>
are the performance of the weapon others for the variety of weapons you<br/>
can use. I didn&#39;t work on my 2hs until I was at the 28th level and it<br/>
was very painful to max it out.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
