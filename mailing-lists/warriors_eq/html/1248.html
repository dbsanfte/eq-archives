<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008621539">I agree with you whole heartedly,<br/>
<br/>
warriors are not masters of magic, thats the wizards role. Thus they can<br/>
dish out the damage from spells, Warrior CAN dish out damage but they use<br/>
more mundane forms of it. If warriors could dish out damage as much as a<br/>
wizard i know I would quit playing EQ. Thats the reason i stopped playing<br/>
diablo, cause not only could the warrior kill things in one slice with his<br/>
sword but he could also cast every spell the mage could....talk about far<br/>
fetched.<br/>

&gt; No matter what you say warriors have one problem and only one flaw as far<br/>
&gt; as I&#39;m concerned, and that is the fact that other Hybrids can melee as<br/>
&gt; good as them. Warriors should be the king of melee, period. Wizard&#39;s<br/>
&gt; should be able to do more damage then a warrior and for good reason.<br/>
&gt; Wizard&#39;s can&#39;t take damage yet warriors can. One person stated warriors<br/>
&gt; should be able to do more damage or at least equal well if Verant did that<br/>
&gt; everybody would 1) quit the game 2) play a warrior. The game would be so<br/>
&gt; out of whacked if Verant did that. All I think is that warriors should be<br/>
&gt; doing 5-10 more damage in melee over hybrids.<br/>
