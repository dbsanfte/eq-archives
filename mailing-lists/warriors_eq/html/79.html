<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963809750">hmmm cutthroats are good, they have bronze sometimes, but you need a party<br/>
at your level.  The places become better for cash the higher you are.<br/>
<br/>
You could also try the Gorge of King Xorbb, minotaurs there, a full party of<br/>
level 10 may be able to take down a gorge, with luck perhaps a chasm.  They<br/>
generally drop gold, sometimes plat and sometimes they drop axes which you<br/>
can sell to PC&#39;s<br/>
