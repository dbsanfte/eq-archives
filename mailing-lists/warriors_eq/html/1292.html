<b>Subject:</b> weapon specialization <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427546577">One question I forgot to ask, but I am getting a lot of email in support of <br/>
is &quot;weapon specialization.&quot;  That is allowing a warrior to specialize in one <br/>
weapon skill (i.e. 1H slashing for my combine longsword!).  I have gotten a <br/>
lot of responses so far to the survey, as I said I will post the final <br/>
responses to the survey next week (probably Monday morning).<br/>

Feel free to email me directly at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:patty_halas@...">patty_halas@...</a> with any <br/>
comments/suggestions.  This is a serious issue and although I am having fun <br/>
roleplaying a ranger, she is nothing like my blood thirsty fearless <br/>
barbarian warrior princess!<br/>

By the way, buy or make arrows, use bows - nothing is more fun than shooting <br/>
an Orc in the back when he is trying to flee.  &quot;Death to everything!&quot;<br/>
