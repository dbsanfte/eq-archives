<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337325476">2 questions for the knowledgable.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have a good list of Warrior weapons and where to find them?  (ie) mob<br/>
name and zone?<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking of traveling a bit with my troll and want to go somewhere<br/>
to have a chance at a good item.<br/>
I am level 19<br/>
<br/>
Also: What damage difference between say... an Ogre strength of 135 and a<br/>
Human strength of 100 make in terms<br/>
of damage with weapons?</div>
