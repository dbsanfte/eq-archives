<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251319491">This was my response to the latest petition update:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Remove the Cap on Combat Skills (offense, defense, 1H slash, kick, dual <br/>
 </span></blockquote>wield, &gt;parry, etc.) which comes into effect around level 40. <br/>
<br/>
Instead of raising the cap (something that won&#39;t affect most warriors <br/>
anyway), how about increasing the chance to hit a creature?  It would be much <br/>
more beneficial if I could hit a creature more often at skill level 50 <br/>
instead of waiting until level 200 for that same chance to hit.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Allow Warriors to advance 6 points in Combat Skills per level instead of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>just 5. At &gt;any given level they would be 20% better at melee combat than the <br/>
hybrids. <br/>
<br/>
Nice idea, but I feel that&#39;s unfair to non-warriors.  Again, to get better at <br/>
melee combat than the other classes, see my suggestion above.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;A unique skill that no other class has. Many players are in favor of Weapon <br/>
&gt;Specialization (reduced delay and increased damage). Use the same rules as <br/>
&gt;specialization for Spell Casters. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m surprised something like this wasn&#39;t implemented in the beginning anyway. <br/>
 However, I fear it might be too broad to allow one to specialize in all 1H <br/>
Slashing or all 2H Blunt.<br/>
<br/>
Something else that would work well would be either a permanent immunity or <br/>
increased percentage chance to resist going into a berzerker frenzy in <br/>
combat.  Either that or the ability to stun monsters like they can stun us.</div>
