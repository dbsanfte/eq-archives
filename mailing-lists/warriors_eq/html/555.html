<b>Subject:</b> Now about 1hs vs 2hs Re: Rangers and warriors <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-126194989">You make some good points.  I will admit that when I started I was focused<br/>
on dual wield...I realized my mistake  at 12th level but by that time it was<br/>
to late to work on my 2 handed slashing skill.  My ranger alternates between<br/>
a fine steel 2 handed sword and a mino axe/shiny brass shield combo.  I am<br/>
keeping both skills maxxed at every level.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion on the 1hs vs 2hs is this.  Warriors need both.  For blue mobs<br/>
the only way to fly is 2 handed with double attack at higher levels.  You<br/>
hit very often for high damage, and with double attack you are a devastating<br/>
hack&#39;n&#39;slash machine.  For higher level mobs that con yellow or red, the 1<br/>
handed weapons shine because of their speed.  You are not going to hit high<br/>
level mobs as much, so having 50% more swings gives you a better chance to<br/>
do damage, even if you do less damage...some is better than none.<br/>
<br/>
I am interested to hear others opinions on this.  And what do you think of<br/>
trying to get my 2hs skill of 14 up to 80 on my 15th level DE warrior?<br/>
Worth working on?  Or will I have a hard time increasing skill?<br/>

&gt;&gt; Paladin.....they ARE a joke, their healing ability<br/>
&gt;&gt; is a joke, their buffing ability is a joke, because<br/>
&gt;&gt; their heals and buffs are 9 levels behind, the only<br/>
&gt;&gt; thing they have going for them is their lay hands,<br/>
&gt;&gt; which can be very good, but I dont&#39; think it makes<br/>
&gt;&gt; up for their lack of melee ability.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Uh ... ok.  If you say so.  I call Paladins &#39;self-filling tanks&#39;,<br/>
&gt;because they are just that.  They&#39;re not really effective until they<br/>
&gt;get Meditate at 12th, but once there they can do a solo fight that<br/>
&gt;drags them down to 1 bar of HP; and be back in another fight in 7-10<br/>
&gt;mins.  For a corresponding warrior, it would be 13-18 mins, or more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lay On Hands is the Panic Button; you can push it to get out of jail,<br/>
&gt;or at least, have more time to either finish off the mob or run for<br/>
&gt;safety.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As for the spells being 9 levels behind, so?  Paladins are<br/>
&gt;fighter/healers, while Clerics are healer/fighters.  Clerics can be<br/>
&gt;mini-tanks up until about 9th or 10th; but Paladins can tank all the<br/>
&gt;way to 50.  The ability to tank and still have a reserve to compliment<br/>
&gt;the party&#39;s cleric is useful.  Past 10th, Clerics are 80%+ casters for<br/>
&gt;all realistic intents and purposes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Paladins don&#39;t get Kick; but at 6th they get bash which I personally<br/>
&gt;like much better.  Kick won&#39;t interrupt casting, while Bash will.  I<br/>
&gt;stopped using Kick with my Troll Warrior when I got Bash (which let my<br/>
&gt;Slam start being much more effective)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you&#39;re fixated on Dual Wield (which I think you might be, since you<br/>
&gt;mentioned Rangers; and they&#39;re the only hybrid, that I recall, that<br/>
&gt;gets Dual Wield); that might explain why you like Warriors and Rangers<br/>
&gt;the most.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Personally, I think the jury&#39;s still out on Dual Wield, and on melee in<br/>
&gt;general.  The further up you go, the more the offensive and debuff<br/>
&gt;spellcasters really carry the fight to the mobs; the tanks are just<br/>
&gt;there to do what their name says.  If this is proven out, then Dueal<br/>
&gt;Wield or no, the tanks are just there to soak damage.  If this is not<br/>
&gt;proven, then Dual Wield still has to debate against the endless fighter<br/>
&gt;arguements of Dual Wield vs 2H Weapons (which is one of those semantic<br/>
&gt;arguements, IMO; stats bear each out)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For grouping, I&#39;d prefer to have pure tank in the tank slot, any day of<br/>
&gt;the week; with a Paladin fighting alongside him.  (my ideal 6man group<br/>
&gt;is 2 Warriors, 1 Paladin, 1 Cleric, 1 Wizard, 1 Bard; haven&#39;t assembled<br/>
&gt;it yet, but it sounds fun!) For soloing, however, the Paladin is more<br/>
&gt;efficient than the Warrior.<br/>
