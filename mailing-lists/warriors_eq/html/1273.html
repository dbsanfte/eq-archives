<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083546247">I thought it WAS group damage vs. everyone else.  i.e. allt he group damage<br/>
was added up together then compared to the steal killers total.  Thats why,<br/>
really, only higher level wizards can steal kill.  This is not the case??<br/>

&gt; I can feel the pain that both of you are having. The group of five that I<br/>
&gt; play with<br/>
&gt; just came from CB after killing everything in there but Dvinn many, many<br/>
&gt; times. My<br/>
&gt; experiences were as follows:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.) High levels constantly camped the eqipment mobs. We were there for a<br/>
&gt; reason, to<br/>
&gt; get our Cleric ONE screaming mace (needs two items). In order to do that<br/>
&gt; we had to<br/>
&gt; log on at odd times just to get the two items we needed. At times there<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; multiple groups from the SAME guild, camping the mobs nearly a weekend at<br/>
&gt; a time. It<br/>
&gt; took the better part of three weeks to get TWO items.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.) Most all of the solo high level campers were spellcasters. I can<br/>
&gt; recall 2<br/>
&gt; wizzies, 2 necros, and a mage. All level 20+ since they had 2 names but<br/>
&gt; other than<br/>
&gt; that, they were anon so we could not determine level. Why were they there?<br/>
&gt; I have no<br/>
&gt; idea. They all played solo, and they all dealt more damage than any<br/>
&gt; grouped party<br/>
&gt; without a spellcaster, thus winning the kill.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3.) At the time we had a group of 5 characters: a lvl 15 pally, a lvl 15<br/>
&gt; warrior, a<br/>
&gt; lvl 14 warrior, a lvl 15 thief, a lvl 14 cleric. While we wre there, there<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; levels even went up to further add to our damage dealing power. Despite<br/>
&gt; this, at no<br/>
&gt; time were we able to get a kill when ANY other party contained a wizard.<br/>
&gt; Even if<br/>
&gt; they were solo wizards only one or two levels above us. Typical scenario<br/>
&gt; ... we have<br/>
&gt; the spawn, we attack and damage the mob to about 3/4 or 1/2 damage when<br/>
&gt; *fzzzzt* a<br/>
&gt; spellcaster nukes the mob, trains it to him and then finishes with a few<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; spells. We would always chase,but we could never get the kill when this<br/>
&gt; happened.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4.) A solo spellcaster can fry a mob in about 30 to 45 seconds with 5 or 6<br/>
&gt; strong<br/>
&gt; spells, followed by about a 5 minute &#39;meditation enhanced&#39; downtime. A<br/>
&gt; solo warrior<br/>
&gt; can kill a mob in about 1 to 3 minutes with many, many hits, followed by<br/>
&gt; up to 15<br/>
&gt; minutes of pure butt sitting. Anyone else think this is slightly unfair<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; gameplay?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We had kills stolen many many times and nothing frustrates you more than<br/>
&gt; bleeding<br/>
&gt; from a mob that is stolen from you in mid fight. We tried getting<br/>
&gt; spellcasters into<br/>
&gt; our group, but at our level, most were doing better playing solo. From all<br/>
&gt; of this I<br/>
&gt; gathered that two things need to be done.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One, if Verant wants to give groups a better advantage than solos, then by<br/>
&gt; all means<br/>
&gt; allow group damage to overcome the &#39;single greatest damage dealer gets the<br/>
&gt; kill&#39;<br/>
&gt; rule. Or bump it up somehow. It doesn&#39;t have to be much but for god sakes<br/>
&gt; ... people<br/>
&gt; having fun as a team should be rewarded for their organization and<br/>
&gt; coordination. It<br/>
&gt; requires effort and patience to play well as a team. It requires nearly<br/>
&gt; nothing to<br/>
&gt; play well alone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Two, wizzies need to be toned down on solo just a little. I have nothing<br/>
&gt; against<br/>
&gt; powerful wizards. I have EVERYTHING against solos who steal other people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; kills in<br/>
&gt; mid battle. Or even if they are grouped for that matter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can anyone think of a GOOD way to prevent these type of activities? I<br/>
&gt; cannot. We&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; discussed it in our group many times but could not come up with much. Any<br/>
&gt; input on<br/>
&gt; this post, or the two previous, would be great to hear. Maybe it will<br/>
&gt; cheer me up<br/>
&gt; some.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; P.S.- By the way, great tip on the kill stealing Druid. Thanks for that<br/>
&gt; tactical<br/>
&gt; advice Surtur.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I know how frustrating this is. I was 12 or 13 at the Chessboard in<br/>
&gt; butcherblock<br/>
&gt; &gt; with about 3 other people,  one cleric and 2 other hybrids . A 13th<br/>
&gt; druid showed<br/>
&gt; &gt; up and was able to outdamage us and was clearly using us as his tanks<br/>
&gt; while<br/>
&gt; &gt; taking all of the experience. We asked him if he wanted to alternate<br/>
&gt; kills, or a<br/>
&gt; &gt; number of other solutions that would benefit us both. But he clearly<br/>
&gt; wanted to<br/>
&gt; &gt; get every kill he could grab from us, while he took no damage from them.<br/>
&gt; He even<br/>
&gt; &gt; told us he would leave when he reached 14 so he could get his next rank<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; spells.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So we decided that the next king would get it&#39;s attention and no-one<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; attack it, so when he started blasting it would go for him. He tried<br/>
&gt; training it<br/>
&gt; &gt; on us and we just kept fleeing from it so it was focused on him. Then he<br/>
&gt; trained<br/>
&gt; &gt; it on someone on the otherside of the board and stole the kill from<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If verant is encouraging us to work to gether, the code needs to be<br/>
&gt; changed so<br/>
&gt; &gt; that the experience goes to the Group that does the most damage, not the<br/>
&gt; &gt; individual who does the most. This allowed this druid to steal them from<br/>
&gt; us and<br/>
&gt; &gt; use my party as his shield. If we as a group were the determining factor<br/>
&gt; in who<br/>
&gt; &gt; gets the xp, then he would not have been able to do this. This would<br/>
&gt; also<br/>
&gt; &gt; encourage players to form larger groups to overcome problems like this<br/>
&gt; on our<br/>
&gt; &gt; own and not have to petition them. In this situation we could of<br/>
&gt; outdamage him<br/>
&gt; &gt; and taken the kills that were ours and he would have gotten frustrated<br/>
&gt; and left,<br/>
&gt; &gt; or worked on getting a lerger group on his own that would have forced us<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; leave. I&#39;m sure there could be abuses with this rule change, so please<br/>
&gt; let me<br/>
&gt; &gt; know what they are.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I play a 38th halfling warrior on Povar... I have some dam good<br/>
&gt; equipment<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and am one of the higher warriors on the server... But something<br/>
&gt; happened to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; me yesterday that I think highlights the warrior classes weakness... I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; decided I wanted to get that new dragoon&#39;s dirk from Dvinn in<br/>
&gt; Crushbone...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So I went there, camped in his room, for those of you that dont know,<br/>
&gt; Dvinn<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is about a 25th level DE that is very tough.... He spawned and I<br/>
&gt; attacked<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; him... low and behold a wizzie... AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE.... ran into<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; room, and started blasting him!  Guess what? AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE<br/>
&gt; STOLE<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; DVINN FROM A 38TH LEVEL WARRIOR!!!!!  Do I need to say ANYTHING else?<br/>
&gt; btw I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was using a zweildahander.... This was the most embarassing thing that<br/>
&gt; has<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ever happened to me... I&#39;m sitting there in almost full rubicite, all<br/>
&gt; these<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cool items, everyone is looking at me... and then i have the thing<br/>
&gt; stolen<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from me by ONE, not a group, but ONE 18th level wizzie......grumbles<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; something about warriors suck and I am ready to cancel my account...<br/>
