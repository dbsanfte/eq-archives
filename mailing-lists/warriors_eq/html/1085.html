<div id="ygrps-yiv-804479756">I did not log out with it though, I was killed, and upon resurrection it was gone.  My starting sword that I had destroyed was back in my inventory.  Does this sound right to you?  Thanks<br/>

    The rune sword is actually a very good one handed slashing weapon.  To bad its also a summoned item.  Most high level magicians can create them.  Damage 7 delay 26 i believe.  I have been able to keep one in the bank for quit some time.  As soon as you log out with it in your inventory tho, it is gone forever.  At least until you get a mage to make you another one.  Anyway, the morale of the story great weapon, but summoned, so find yourself a mage to adventure with.  This weapon and a barbed leather whip with cause some very good damage together.<br/>

        I would greatly appreciate any info.  I am not happy with my current weapons, and the weapons that I want are far out of my reach.<br/>

            Tom, I am ashamed to say that the sword was a gift from a dear friend, and I just equipped it and walked out to battle when I was killed.  I was in such a state of shock to find it gone, that I forgot the stats and went a little &quot;nuts&quot;.  I will find out for you, and get back on this.  But I still want to know, &quot;WHAT HAPPENED TO MY SWORD&quot;?  LOL<br/>
