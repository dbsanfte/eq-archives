<b>Subject:</b> What to do w/ Sense Heading <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200810410"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;With my natural drow intelligence being 99, it only takes me about 30<br/>
&gt;seconds of pressing the sense heading button to max it out for a level.<br/>
&gt;What *I* do when i sit and rest, is read the forgotten realm series of<br/>
&gt;books. From level 1 to level 20, what my character is now, I&#39;ve went<br/>
&gt;through 3 books :) It&#39;s cool to read how Verant took the characters from<br/>
&gt;the books and how their natural races have been complimented by their<br/>
&gt;corresponding cities.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s the best way to handle the skill of Sense Heading:  First under <br/>
Options goto Keyboard and find the User Defined 6 slot.  Get rid of <br/>
whatever&#39;s there and make it Keypad 8.  Now, go back to your Abilities list, <br/>
and hotkey Sense Heading onto the last hotkey box on the left-hand side of <br/>
your screen.  Now, whenever you walk forward (assuming you use the keypad for <br/>
control), you will automatically practice Sense Heading at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Sense Heading while Fishing?  You bet!  When you fish, take a seat next to an <br/>
NPC (presumably another fisher).  As you are fishing, practice Beg on the <br/>
NPC, and Sense Heading all at the same time.</div>
