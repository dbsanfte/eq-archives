<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922546954">OK.  You rmaking some sense.  Let&#39;s try and put together a reasonable offer.<br/>
<br/>
1) Critical Hit as a Warrior only skill (maybe add Monk)<br/>
<br/>
2) Remove skill caps for warrior on the following skills:  Offense, Defense,<br/>
Dual weild, Dble attack.<br/>
<br/>
3) add specialization in weapons forms (1-handed slash, 2- handed slash,<br/>
archery, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
4) Add a once a day ability Battle Cry (As a barbarian I really like this)<br/>
That temporarily enhances  fighting abilities.<br/>
<br/>
5) Increase the effects of strength on damage and stamina on healing, but<br/>
not drastically.  Since these are primary attributes for a warrior this<br/>
should help us out in being more effective in the early stages of combat and<br/>
get us off our butts a little faster afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
what do you think?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am in agreement as well.... Short of the fact that warriors <br/>
&gt; are needed in<br/>
&gt; high level groups.  Let me backtrack a little bit.  Warriors <br/>
&gt; at the lower<br/>
&gt; levels are far superior to hybrid classes in general.  But at <br/>
&gt; the higer<br/>
&gt; levels, the hybrids have gained so many abilities and extras that the<br/>
&gt; warrior is overshadowed by the attributes of a hybrid.  Also, <br/>
&gt; a hybrid can<br/>
&gt; fulfill the same role that a warrior can at those higher <br/>
&gt; levels just as well<br/>
&gt; as a warrior can.  A warrior also has very little ability at <br/>
&gt; higher levels<br/>
&gt; to use his taunt, bue to lack of damage inflicted to a mob.  <br/>
&gt; I find this<br/>
&gt; happeneing to me at level 30 already.  How bad will this be <br/>
&gt; at level 40?<br/>
&gt; The lack of a warrior being able to get a mob off the casters <br/>
&gt; will make his<br/>
&gt; worth in the battle less.  Therefore groups will be more <br/>
&gt; inclined to chose a<br/>
&gt; hybrid class as their tank.  This will cause a loss of people actually<br/>
&gt; playing warriors in the game, leading to the downfall of the <br/>
&gt; class as a<br/>
&gt; whole.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for wizards/warrior argument.  Warriors are not supposed <br/>
&gt; to do the damage<br/>
&gt; a wizard can do.  we are there as the shield so they can lay <br/>
&gt; down the damage<br/>
&gt; at will....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you get into a good group that is working well together.  <br/>
&gt; Where everyone<br/>
&gt; in the group knows there place in the group organization.  <br/>
&gt; Wizards become<br/>
&gt; the secondary source of damage, not the primary.  If they <br/>
&gt; nuke to soon, they<br/>
&gt; are mobbed, they have to hold their spells in check until the <br/>
&gt; right time to<br/>
&gt; burn down the mob.  Yes, they do put some small burns into <br/>
&gt; the middle of the<br/>
&gt; battle, but they shouldnt let loose the great damage spells <br/>
&gt; until late in<br/>
&gt; the battle.  This is the true place where warriors shine.  <br/>
&gt; But even at that,<br/>
&gt; by the time the battle nears where its time for the wizards power, the<br/>
&gt; warrior has done little except take alot of damage.  IMO we <br/>
&gt; should be able<br/>
&gt; to help with some of the beginning portion of battles more <br/>
&gt; than what we do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am thinking that the majority of us agree on the critical <br/>
&gt; hit issue.  How<br/>
&gt; do we feel about the specialization skills?  Also, remember <br/>
&gt; that we cap all<br/>
&gt; of our skills (that didnt cap earlier) at 200.  Some of the <br/>
&gt; hybrid classes<br/>
&gt; continue to be able to gain in skills past that.  I feel we <br/>
&gt; should be able<br/>
&gt; to remove that cap on our skill and continue to progress in <br/>
&gt; them.  We are<br/>
&gt; warriors, we never stop learning our art.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I whole heartedly agree with you wayne.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The game is about balance. Some people are saying that a <br/>
&gt; group of really<br/>
&gt; &gt; high levels do not need warriors. I say thats BS my friends <br/>
&gt; always want my<br/>
&gt; &gt; warrior in their group. Not just becuase im company mind <br/>
&gt; you. Because they<br/>
&gt; &gt; are spell casters. If im not there, the MOB would latch <br/>
&gt; onto them and<br/>
&gt; &gt; interrupt their casting.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sure we could beg verant for one more skill .... critical <br/>
&gt; hit , which is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; very good idea. And i like the idea of it being like <br/>
&gt; ripsote and parry.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Makes more sense. But the fact of the matter is this: We <br/>
&gt; are there to<br/>
&gt; &gt; prevent our spellcasting buddies from being hit by <br/>
&gt; creatures so that THEY<br/>
&gt; &gt; can dish out the damage. I have never had anyone complain to me<br/>
&gt; &gt; and say look<br/>
&gt; &gt; man we dont want you in the group anymore cause you doont dish<br/>
&gt; &gt; out the most<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Every group needs a good strong warrior.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Many of the Warriors here have complained that they <br/>
&gt; cannot do damage as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fast<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as a Wizard.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now all of you real life ninjas and steel sword swinging <br/>
&gt; fools just calm<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; down.  Read carefully.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Warriors get to wear platemail and have many more hps <br/>
&gt; than a Wizard.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Warriors also have a higher Offense, Defense, and Weapon<br/>
&gt; &gt; skills.  This all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; means that a Warrior can stand toe to toe against an NPC.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now lets make a Warrior have the same ability to deal damage as<br/>
&gt; &gt; a Wizard.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now we would have a class that has the best armor, the <br/>
&gt; highest combat<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; skills, the most hp&#39;s AND the ability to deal the most damage.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why would anyone want to play a Wizard if a Warrior could <br/>
&gt; do as much<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; AND be able to take blows in melee?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Wayne<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; PS - When someone says that a Warrior should be able to <br/>
&gt; deal as much<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as fast as a Wizard I immediately realize this person doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a clue<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about game balance.<br/>
