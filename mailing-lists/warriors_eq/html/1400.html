&gt; I really don&#39;t know if the guy will ace you or not when you initiate a trade...I would con him & be ready to beat feet if it doesn&#39;t work.  If you can give him belts & shoulderpads it certainly will help your faction.  Perhaps your mage friends (if you&#39;ve got them) might be willing to root the fellow or use some other creative magical solution to save your bacon (I have no idea how high a level he is either).  This solution is a pure brainstorm on my part.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh well I suppose this will be all trial and error and in many ways that is what makes the game fun.  Imagine how happy you&#39;ll be if it works.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Do you becove visable when you give the dwarf the belts?  I would love to get <br/>
&gt; &gt; my Dark Elf in there and do that.  Right now, all guards from the boat to the <br/>
&gt; &gt; front gates of Kaladim regard me warmly, and after that, it&#39;s KOS all the way <br/>
&gt; &gt; to the zone to Greater Faydark.  Is there another thing that needs killing to <br/>
&gt; &gt; make the dwarves around there like me?  I lost over 1 bubble and level 14 <br/>
&gt; &gt; because I thought that the dwarves liked me, then one just killed me.  No <br/>
&gt; &gt; chance to run far enough away, so I had to go back to Faydwer from the South <br/>
&gt; &gt; Gate of Freeport.  Got there, tried to use /corpse, but it was too far away, <br/>
&gt; &gt; got closer and the dwarf killed me again.  Back in Freeport.  Took the boat <br/>
&gt; &gt; again, got the first body back.  Got an invis, used /corpse command over and <br/>
&gt; &gt; over to drag it.  Accidentally right clicked corpse.  Became visable, killed <br/>
&gt; &gt; again.  One more time on the boat, and I finally got my stuff back.  So, if <br/>
&gt; &gt; there is any way that I can give the dwarf the belts without being by it, I <br/>
&gt; &gt; would really, really appreciate the info.<br/>
