&gt; OK.  You rmaking some sense.  Let&#39;s try and put together a<br/>
&gt; reasonable offer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Critical Hit as a Warrior only skill (maybe add Monk)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really like this one.  We need to really define this skill.  Maybe we can<br/>
come up with some kind of frequency, damage, and such that we can &quot;suggest&quot;<br/>
to Verant as what we feel would be nice.  Lets keep it reasonable, we dont<br/>
wanna ask to be superhuman.  i.e. instant death on success.<br/>
I was thinking it could do a int or wiz check of some sort, concidering the<br/>
critical hit would be from lerning where and how to hit for maximum<br/>
efficiency.  Also, all of our int and wizdoms should be relatively low to<br/>
minumize the actuall sucess of this skill.  That way it does not get out of<br/>
hand.  Maybe a 200point strike on sucess would be enough damage as well.<br/>
modified by strength and level of course.<br/>

&gt; 2) Remove skill caps for warrior on the following skills:<br/>
&gt; Offense, Defense,<br/>
&gt; Dual weild, Dble attack.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is probably one of the more important addition i would like to see.<br/>
But I would also like to see the removal of all weapon skill caps as well.<br/>
The way it is now, we cap at 200 on all weapon skills.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 3) add specialization in weapons forms (1-handed slash, 2- handed slash,<br/>
&gt; archery, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is my second in line for preference of what to add.  I think that<br/>
specialization similiar to the magic specialization would be great.  the<br/>
benefits to specialization would be attack delay reduction, and minor damage<br/>
increase.  maybe just double the strength modifier.  more input would be<br/>
great on this.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 4) Add a once a day ability Battle Cry (As a barbarian I really like this)<br/>
&gt; That temporarily enhances  fighting abilities.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds pretty neat, tho i think this would be asking for too much.<br/>
Although it doesnt hurt to add it in.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 5) Increase the effects of strength on damage and stamina on healing, but<br/>
&gt; not drastically.  Since these are primary attributes for a warrior this<br/>
&gt; should help us out in being more effective in the early stages of<br/>
&gt; combat and get us off our butts a little faster afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Instead of this, I read someone put a skill called sleep.  this would<br/>
effectively double our rate of regeneration, but we would be blinded by a<br/>
black screen.  I would also say we would have to have some kind of negative<br/>
to a skill like this other than just being blind.  Maybe it takes us<br/>
something like 5 rounds to come out of a sleep or something.  This would<br/>
make the use of it dangerous, tho with a group watching your back, it would<br/>
be beneficial.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; what do you think?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think we are getting much closer to something we can present as a<br/>
pettition.  lets just firm things up with solid definitions and a solid<br/>
order as to what we would like to see implemented, and we are there.  Good<br/>
work guys.<br/>
<br/>
I also think we have thought about this very logically and tried to keep<br/>
most of the requests within a balanced boundry of game play.<br/>
