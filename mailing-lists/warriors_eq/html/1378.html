<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906005440">I have a couple hunting grounds although some of them aren&#39;t really well known and I don&#39;t plan on telling anybody. On a very good day I can rake in 200pp but that&#39;s my best day and that&#39;s a full 8 hours of game time. It really isn&#39;t hard to gain money past level 20.</div>
