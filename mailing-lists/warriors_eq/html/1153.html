We have all been sold a bunch of lies regarding our class and I for one will never play this class again unless they repair it.  Add to this the fact that Verant has made the better 1h slashing weapons in the game Lore items further decreases our power.  Camping is a mage problem and the warriors get punished for it.  Those of you dreaming of dual wielding Polished Granite Tomahawks can forget it, they are pending Lore items now.<br/>
