<div id="ygrps-yiv-699901487">in beta I dueled many wizards.  Simply put, if they use root, warrior dies, unless you get real lucky and resist a lot.  In many of the duels, since they were just for fun and mainly with friends, they agreed not to use root.  The results were rather surprising.  If they tried to use their big damage spells I would usually win due to a couple resists and couple interupts, and just smackin the hell outta them with my GZ.  BUT if the wiz would use lower level lightning spells they would win becuase they cast so fast I didn&#39;t inturupt much, and even if I resisted a few, there were a few more on the way.<br/>

Ever compared an equal level warrior and wiz?<br/>
<br/>
If the wiz unloads on the warrior using his meanest spells then sit and<br/>
meds, the warrior will do about the same amount of damage as the wiz takes<br/>
to unload then med.<br/>

&gt; Who cares what damage a warrior does at 35+<br/>
&gt; That is not our role......suck it up...all of the damage.<br/>
&gt; That is what you are here for.<br/>
&gt; Try doin more damage then a wiz or a mate.....I think not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Warriors ar not the ones to dish out the damage....at lower levels yea but<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; at higer levels we just keep em occupied.<br/>
&gt; IMHO<br/>

&gt; &gt;Yup & the gap seems to get worse the higher in levels you go.  Not only <br/>
&gt; &gt;Rangers, but Paladins & especially Monks seem to greatly diminish the<br/>
&gt; role <br/>
&gt; &gt;of the warrior at levels 25+.  Eventually the other classes have similar <br/>
&gt; &gt;(within a couple of 100 hps) stats and much more diversity in terms of <br/>
&gt; &gt;healing & hth damage capability.  Mind you that my opinion is based on <br/>
&gt; &gt;talking with high level players (who have tried to convince me to dump my<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;warrior) & from reading on the eqstratics site.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;There is an interesting thread on the eqstratics board (warriors)<br/>
&gt; regarding <br/>
&gt; &gt;the perceived lack of differentiation (or all out weakness) of our class<br/>
&gt; at <br/>
&gt; &gt;higher levels.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;What does the rest of the list think?  Anyone have direct experience <br/>
&gt; &gt;playing these classes at level 30+ & can compare HTH damage &<br/>
&gt; effectiveness <br/>
&gt; &gt;against critters?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This past week I decided to take a break from my level 15 dark elf <br/>
&gt; &gt;warrior.  I was abit frustrated.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I started a half-elf warrior in Kelethin.  It is insanely easy to play<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;there.  I made level 5 in about 3.5 hours.  Then I stopped and tried a<br/>
&gt; wood <br/>
&gt; &gt;elf ranger.  Has anyone else played a ranger?  I imagine it is the most <br/>
&gt; &gt;poorly balanced of all the hybrids.  After 4 hours I reached level 5 and <br/>
&gt; &gt;got kick.  I am now 12-18 hours into the character and almost level 9.  I<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;am just as capable as an equivalent warrior.  Next level I gain an array<br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; &gt;spells which will boost my combat effectiveness and allow me to heal.<br/>
&gt; Part <br/>
&gt; &gt;of the easy success is the plethora of low level orcs available a stone&#39;s<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;throw from Kelethin.  With my tracking ability I am never at a loss for <br/>
&gt; &gt;targets and I can engage blue con orcs in rapid succession or even 2 at a<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;time. I can even engage and successfully beat yellow con orcs more than<br/>
&gt; 50% <br/>
&gt; &gt;of the time and almost always can kill orcs that con even to me without <br/>
&gt; &gt;trouble. So far it seems that I get as many hit points now as my warrior <br/>
&gt; &gt;did.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My point is, with a ranger class as powerful a combatant as it is I<br/>
&gt; see <br/>
&gt; &gt;little necessity for the pure warrior.  I am going to play through to<br/>
&gt; level <br/>
&gt; &gt;15 I think, just to see a more even comparison.  My concern is only from<br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt;game mechanics perspective though as I have no doubt my playing as a dark<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;elf was a much more rewarding experience.  Has anyone else noticed that<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt;warrior just is not different enough from the hybrid fighter classes?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; still undecided<br/>
