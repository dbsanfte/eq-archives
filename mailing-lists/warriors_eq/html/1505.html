&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;More HPs - Lets us take more damage&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;A pointless improvement, IMHO.  If I&#39;m solo I already have to spend a<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;is to have to wait LONGER.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Would you rather wait LONGER for more HPs to regen or would you prefer<br/>
&gt;&gt;death?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well gee, if I had the choose so blindly of course I would take the wait<br/>
&gt;time.  However, your question doesn&#39;t really address what I&#39;m talking<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
My point is that More HPs is not a &quot;pointless improvement&quot;.  More HPs save<br/>
you from dying.  I know I&#39;ve zoned with less that 20 HPs many many times.<br/>
And there have been many times when I died just short of the zone.  If I had<br/>
just a few more HPs, I could have made it.<br/>
<br/>
More HPs is something many Warriors have demanded.  They felt insulted when<br/>
a hybrid with the same race and STA can have the same HPs as a Warrior.<br/>
This is something that should have been in the game from day 1.  To say that<br/>
more HPs are pointless and only makes you wait longer to regen them is<br/>
ridiculous.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I came up with that I think would be much more useful:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only reason I didn&#39;t comment on your other suggestions is because I<br/>
agreed with them for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;1: Increased chance of hitting with an attack (increased over the hybrids<br/>
&gt;anyway).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed.  Make the cap on Off/Def   6*lvl+5   or   5*lvl +10<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2: Remove or change Berzerker Frenzy.  It is not a help, it&#39;s a hinderance.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed.  Make it an active skill usable once a day or something.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;ll reiterate my other one, even though it doesn&#39;t relate to the above.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3: Make Kick and Bash/Slam non-mutaually exclusive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like it the way it is.  Soemtimes is it better to kick.  Othertimes you<br/>
want to bash (for the stun).  Being able to do both at the same time would<br/>
eliminate a choice.<br/>
