<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047365554">I tried to increase my skill in piercing by fighting greens, but never saw a<br/>
gain. But then I didn&#39;t see a gain against blues or higher levels, so I think I<br/>
need to put more points in. I&#39;d like to see if it works. I thought I saw<br/>
somewhere that you only gain skill against blue mobs or higher. That is what I<br/>
notice when I raise my 1H and 2H slashing skills, as well as offense and<br/>
defense, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The reason you occasionally get experience from greens and occasionally have a<br/>
blue that cleans your clock is because there appears to be a gradient in the<br/>
different colors. When you con a mob, look at the text. The greens I got<br/>
experience from said they were &quot;risky&quot; instead of the usual &quot;looks like an easy<br/>
opponent&quot; text.<br/>
<br/>
A question I have for my fellow Barbarians who travel to Faydwer is: Have any of<br/>
you been able to find warrior training on the continent? I was able to get the<br/>
dwarven guards to view me as amiable by killing CB orcs, but I never could get<br/>
the Stormguard Hall Warriors guild NPC&#39;s to talk to me. They woudl say Felwithe<br/>
does not have a warriors guild and the Kelethin warriors guild you cannot get<br/>
into since it doesn&#39;t have double doors. I was never able to get inside a single<br/>
door building in Kelethin even by ducking. I never tried getting into Ak&#39;Anon to<br/>
see if they had a guild I could get into. It is such a pain to have to hop the<br/>
boat back to Freeport just to train for new skills. I wish the Warriors guild in<br/>
Kelethin had double doors on it instead of the Rangers Guild. All the large<br/>
races cannot be rangers so what is the point? Is anyone else out there<br/>
experiencing the sam difficulties? Did I not kill enough orcs? I also cannot<br/>
turn in the belts to help boost the faction rating that way either.<br/>

&gt; Your skills increase each time you use them no matter what the level of your<br/>
&gt; opponent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can stand over a spawn spot and swing away at rats and snakes for hours<br/>
&gt; to build a new wep skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Experience points are tied the level of the opponent though.  But they are<br/>
&gt; tied to other factors as well.  I can swear that I have killed stuff that<br/>
&gt; conned green (lower than blue) and have gotten xp from it.  Why? I have no<br/>
&gt; clue - maybe because you get a quota for each kind of mob in a zone?  Or<br/>
&gt; something.  I&#39;ll max out on killing young lions which are/were blue and then<br/>
&gt; have to slay a pesky bear which is green and get xp off the bear but not the<br/>
&gt; young lion, go figure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As a rule, when I solo, I try not to attack yellows (&#39;...quite a gamble...&#39;)<br/>
&gt; or whites (&#39;...looks like an even fight...&#39;) and of course not reds.  I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; rather take more easy kills than suffer the heal time between long melee&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; But I wonder if the gain in xp is worth it?<br/>
