<b>Subject:</b> RE: Why I don&#39;t play a Warrior <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058588310">I totally agree with you,<br/>
<br/>
I play a cleric now more than my warrior, not because i find the warrior<br/>
class dull, but because i find the cleric class the most interesting to play<br/>
(especially if you are like me and you roleplay,  being a dark elf cleric<br/>
makes is really fun)<br/>
<br/>
When whoever said that when a cleric is fighting a grif and their party is<br/>
dying would cower and run is obviously grouping with a COWARD! My cleric can<br/>
take just as good as a warrior, my ac is damn high and my buffs add to that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Plus with my divine aura i am always the LAST party member to flee, i tell<br/>
everyone i party with that i will die so they can run. Divine aura lets any<br/>
cleric do this. But that all depends on the player themselves<br/>
<br/>
Dont knock a class till you play with the people who play it best.<br/>

&gt; Umm...  whoever says this about clerics is stupid as hell<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At lvl 31 I group consistantly with a cleric.  This class is amazing.  If<br/>
&gt; you think all they do is heal, you are very very wrong.  Their dd&#39;s do<br/>
&gt; stun<br/>
&gt; (amazing for rogues) and they can heal better than any other class.  I<br/>
&gt; want<br/>
&gt; to see your two druids heal you to full from 1 bar of life<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also if all you fight is yellows and reds you need to rethink your<br/>
&gt; leveling<br/>
&gt; process.  Whites and blues are excellent to fight if you are in groups<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; handle large numbers well.  Before you say all clerics do is heal, play<br/>
&gt; one,<br/>
&gt; or play with a good one.<br/>
