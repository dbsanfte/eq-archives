<div id="ygrps-yiv-226463971">Wow THE Kailyn?  The same fellow from the old eq.stratics board?  The<br/>
guy who discovered the STA/HP formula & the Agi/AC formulas? If so its<br/>
darn good to hear from you again.  I learned alot of what I needed to<br/>
know about warrioring from that board.<br/>
<br/>
I indeed was part of the great warrior sitout (I think the first<br/>
sitout). I remember Fitty, Ruatha & all the other Stratics guys egging<br/>
all the warriors on to particpate (things really were hard on early<br/>
warriors).   I was laughing when over your story about bronze...I myself<br/>
did not get full bronze until lvl 24 (?) if I remember right.  Heck I<br/>
used dual Mino Axes until lvl 18 (then had to get a combine long sword<br/>
to kill undead in Unrest).<br/>
<br/>
BTW another great warrior weapon to add to the &quot;uber&quot; list you mentioned<br/>
is the bloodpoint 10/21 procs an 80 pt hp txf & is not lore (drops in<br/>
Howling Stones).  I have 1 of these at the moment & with werwolf form<br/>
see 8-9 procs a fight.  My goal in life (other than get to lvl 56 &<br/>
riposte) is to obtain another.<br/>
<br/>
Good to hear from you bro<br/>
