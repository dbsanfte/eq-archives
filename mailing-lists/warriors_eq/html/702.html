<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142123346">Well put great warrior.  This is the best and only reason to be the single <br/>
best tank in Norrath!  But I don&#39;t want full plate mail.  I intend to keep <br/>
my leather bear hat &#39;cause it looks so much better than a plate helm.  Wish <br/>
everquest would make a plate mail bear hat :o)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Correct me if Im wrong, and I usually am.<br/>
&gt;But what I hear is that warriors get lots more hp,s at higher levs, past 20<br/>
&gt;I belive,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And can rangers wear all types of armor? have same stamina?Might be true<br/>
&gt;that ragers kick warrior but at this level.<br/>
&gt;What interests me though is what it is like at higher levels.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I play a warrior cus I want to be the fat ass barbarian standing in full<br/>
&gt;plate in the front line suckin it all up.<br/>
&gt;I want to feel the steel slice through my arms and get beaten to a bloody<br/>
&gt;pulp, I want to be the guys that keeps the mobs from walkin all over the<br/>
&gt;party, I want to be the one that dies first but did a damn good job trying<br/>
&gt;to protect his friends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If this is possible with a ranger in the same extent as with a warrior,<br/>
&gt;then I might change.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
