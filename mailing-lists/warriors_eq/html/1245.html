<div id="ygrps-yiv-678768468">Posting this only because of the positive response to my accidental post earlier.<br/>
This is my weekend recap of last week. For the most part in character, which most of these recaps are.<br/>
<br/>
There are some gaps because you don&#39;t know my travelling companions and previous adventures. If you are interested in specific points just email me and I will gladly fill you in, use email though. I dont want to spam the list with unrelated crap.<br/>

Arriving at the docks in Freeport I found myself once again bound for adventure.  Soleman would be excited to know that I had finally arrived bringing with me the items he so deperately needed. I hired a messenger and off he went to find and tell my dwarven friend to meet me in Freeport&#39;s Bank. I also sent a messenger to the Oasis of Marr to inform Tasser of my arrival.<br/>
 <br/>
After meeting Soleman and equipping him with the shiny brass shield and fine steel morningstar, I set off to Oasis.  I spent a bit of time deciding whether to purchase a 2 handed combine sword or a longsword. After much debate I settled on the longsword.  I haggled the price a bit with gypsy and save a few plat by influencing him with my medallion.  Just as I slid my new longsword into my scabbard I waas run through by a sand giant.  The gypsy did nothing but watch as the sand giant pierced me again.  I ran from the fiend, as fast as I could but was run down halfway to the docks.  My corpse falling to a bloody heap on the hot desert sand.  <br/>
 <br/>
*BOINK* Arriving at the Freeport bank thanks to the grace of Tunare, I set out for Oasis again.  Once I had retrieved my belongings I met Tasser and we started hunting crocs.  After a particularly invigorating battle with an orcish priest another sand giant came to the coast.  I entertained thoughts of casting a spell of invisibility on the giant.  But I am not so sure the giant would see the mirth, and it would most certainly result in a few deaths of adventurers under its invisible feet.  Tasser begged me not to do it, and so I relented.  No mischief right then. Tasser and I were caught in a horrible lagmire.  Though we survived, Tasser decided to end his adventuring for the evening. With few caiman&#39;s about I decided Oasis was not for me.  I set out for the dungeon of Befallen.<br/>
 <br/>
My trip to Befallen was uneventful.  Except for a quick stop to assist a group of barbarians in beating down that horrible dark elf Dorn.  I arrived at Befallen refreshed and ready for adventure.  Inside I quickly joined with a group that was setting out for the third level of Befallen, the lair of the troll shadowknight.  I eagerly joined this band for I was eager to obtain the sword this fallen knight is rumored to hold, the bone bladed claymore.  For about an hour we laid waste to the necromancers and undead that inhabitted the lower level.  As it sometimes happens, some members needed to leave.  As we discussed who was to leave and who was going to stay, the group got a little spread out.  It was then that bad luck hit.  A foolhardy human fell into the well that leads from level one to level three.  In his panic he ran around blindly causing many of the dungeons denizens to pursue him.  He ran up to our group and asked for help. But it was to late, the vicious spells of the necromancers were rapidly bleeding his health away and he died.  His followers dispersed among our group and attacked us all.  Standing together as one, we may have had a chance against the three necromancers and pets, with 2 greater skeletons and an ice boned skeleton. Divided we fell.  I fought hard and long.  It was now that I discovered that my most powerful magic was worthless, I could not cast lightning in the dungeon!  I cast Burst of Fire spells till my mana was exhausted and fought hard swinging my dwarven axe with precision and force.  In the end a single necromancer&#39;s pet remained, but the spells of Heat Blood, Clinging Darkness and Infectious Cloud were taking their toll on me.  With my mana exhausted, I was finally defeated.  My body left within the deepest recesses of Befallen. Death by stupidity!  A foolish human cost the lives of 6 brave and hardy adventurers.<br/>
<br/>
*Boink* I arrive in Freeport thanks to the grace of Tunare.  Running as fast as I can I return to Befallen.  I met up with the rest of the victims and we decide to tempt fate.  Since no one lived to loot the corpses of those we had killed we would try to use the well to get to our bodies. We all used our spells to offer what protection we could, I even destroyed a skeleton and took its rusty longsword.  In we leaped, unfortunately the necromancers had replaced those we had killed.  Not faint of heart, we lept to the fray and overcame the necros.  It was at this point that poor judgement and panic set in.  Being here on the third level with nothing but your skivvies has a way of getting to some people.  Particularly when all of your expensive and protective armor and weapons are right around the corner.  Our fine organization broke up and each ran for their own corpse. (scroll up and read the part about the battle again, except this time some of us had not yet gotten equiiped.)  Unfortunately another group had come down and looted all the corpses we left behind, so everything had returned by the time we got there.  The second group shared our fate, they were unable to turn back the swarm of undead and necros and were killed. <br/>
 <br/>
*BOINK* I arrived in Freeport thanks to the good graces of Tunare (she must be getting tired of this, I know I am).  A refreshing jog returned me to the horror that is Befallen.  This time there were 10 adventurers.  Our second attempt down the well made for more success, until yet again every one broke down and panicked trying to loot their own corpses instead of working together.  10 more dead adventurers.<br/>
 <br/>
*BOINK* Tunare punishes me for annoying her by sending ferocious waves of lag to plague my return journey to Befallen. One of the powerful demi-gods (GM) was on hand to survey the dungeon, a dark elf named Cyric.  His comment was &quot;There has been alot of deaths in this zone&quot; and then he was gone.  In the time I was away some of the group who had managed to make their way close to the door to level three had retrieved their things and left us to fend for ourselves.  Only one of my group remained, Mukruk the troll warrior.  Even bare-handed he was a fearsome foe.  Tiring of barehanded combat with undead myself, I had stopped in Freeport&#39;s bank to retrieve a fine steel 2 handed sword, legionnaire bracers, and dervish rings.  At least I had a few more ac and decent weapon.  Mukruk and I recruited some others who were still trying to breech level 3, and a few honorable adventurers to assist.  By this time we were about the only people in Befallen, so the dungeon was full of undead and nasty necros.  We fought our way to the door to level 3 and attacked the necromancer guarding door.  Suddenly the door opened, and to my horror the elf skeleton and an ice boned skeleton came out.  We quickly dispatched the necromancer, and turned on the skeletons.  I chose to fight the ice-boned with Atherion while Mukruk fought the elf skeleton with another two adventurers who had committed to help us.  I ran out of mana long before the ice boned was dead, but Atherion finally managed to dispatch it, and then a ghoul attacked.  We were all hurt and exhausted, Ironwolf a dwarf paladin broke and ran. Mukruk fought to his last breath beating futilely on the ghoul with his bare hands giving his life to buy us some more time to kill it. The ghoul nearly dead ran off, and we gave chase. It would not do to have it return while we were resting or engaged with something else.  We ran  up the stairs to level 2 in pursuit and opened the door to find......a mummy and greater skeleton.  Since I had little to lose and Atherion was as badly hurt as I was, I yelled &quot;Run!&quot; Alas, Atherion was to badly injured to run and he staggered away but was quickly brought down.  I ran as fast as I could and escaped from the clutches of Befallen for the first time all night.  Atherion returned from Queynos, and again we set forth.  This time we drove down to the level 3 door with an Ogre in tow.  He had fallen through the floor where the human shadowknight is on level two.  We managed to drive all the way to each of our bodies one at a time and as we recovered a body our group became stronger.  We had finally bested Befallen!  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
OOC:  What a night!  I died the first time in Befallen fighting the skeleton pet that would have made me level 16.  By the time I had gotten my corpse I was down almost 2 bubbles.  That final thrust into befallen got me back up to about a bubble and a half to 16.  In the end it was the most excitement I had in awhile, and I oddly enjoyed it.  Imagine 10 bare ass players attacking level 3 of Befallen!  We would have done it to, except everyone was to eager to get their corpse.  My plan in the end was proven.  Work slowly to one corpse at a time and grow in strength till all are recovered.  Panicking and running for your corpse just gets the whole group killed.<br/>
<br/>
So tonight I start all over again at the same point I started off yesterday.<br/>
I must have the BBC.  I want it. I have earned it. Don&#39;t ya think?</div>
