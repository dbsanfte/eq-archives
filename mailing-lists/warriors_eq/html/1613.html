I think a combination of the two is more accurate.  The GZ answer explains<br/>
how the total amount of EXP is awarded for a kill.<br/>
<br/>
Different levels still get different percentages of experience based upon<br/>
their level.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to modify Bruener&#39;s example in light of GZ&#39;s answer and combine it<br/>
with your scenario:<br/>
<br/>
Mob exp: 1000<br/>
total lvls in group 59 (34 + 25)<br/>
Group EXP bonus 100 (10% I&#39;m making this amount up since I don&#39;t really know<br/>
what it is)<br/>
EXP/level = 1100/59 = 18.64<br/>
<br/>
Thoren (34 warrior) gets 634 exp (18.64 * 34)<br/>
Mikal (25 Bard) gets 466 exp (18.64 * 25)<br/>
<br/>
Kindrael<br/>
<br/>
PS.  I&#39;ve seen an experiment that someone ran to see if the human race got<br/>
any exp breaks/bonuses.  They did not.  A human warrior had to kill 14<br/>
firebeetles to level from 2 to 3.  A dwarf warrior had to kill 14<br/>
firebeetles as well.  A Human hybrid had to kill 22 Firebeetles as did dwarf<br/>
hybrids.  There is no exp bonus for being human.  There is one for being a<br/>
warrior.<br/>
