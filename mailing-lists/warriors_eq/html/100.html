BB is a mad house sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
The situation you may want to watch out for is &quot;helping&quot; someone kill a mob<br/>
when the person you are trying to &quot;help&quot; wants to do it solo for the xp.  If<br/>
you join a fight in progress, you may inflict more damage and get the kill<br/>
and thus the other guy does not get the xp from the fight.  <br/>
<br/>
What I do is target the mob and then target the other guy.  Assess if he<br/>
needs help by looking at the difference in hp - this may be the 2nd or 3rd<br/>
mob he has been fighting and even though it&#39;s a scrawny, he maybe low on hp<br/>
and would like some help.<br/>
<br/>
BB is where some people go for loot - others go there for the high MD.<br/>
There are usually lots of kills laying around free for anyone to loot.  And<br/>
even some dead guards and elites just laying there waiting for the looters<br/>
time to expire.<br/>
<br/>
If someone gets so bad with insults, I just go: &quot;don&#39;t make me /ignore you!&quot;<br/>

		well if you saw the person that was hackin the mob die and<br/>
you took over its <br/>
		your kill.<br/>
		And as far as im concerned, bb is a special case.<br/>
		The trains in there are worse then any other area I have<br/>
ever seen.<br/>
		There are so many mobs there that if one gets killed or<br/>
stolen its often not <br/>
		done with evil intentions but done to help someone.<br/>
<br/>
		Yes most damage always count.<br/>
<br/>
		Depending on class I would come up with a nifty comment.<br/>
		ingame insults always work<br/>
		ooc insults though is something I realy dont like.<br/>
		I would have just insulted him for being <br/>
		short/skinny/tall/ugly/weak/archmage wannabee, just<br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
		take care<br/>

		&gt;Hi all,<br/>
		&gt;I&#39;ve been a roleplayer and a mudder for years now. I&#39;ve<br/>
 </span></blockquote>come to EQ like<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;most of us, with a lot of experience in multiplayer gaming.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now, I&#39;m<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;fairly new to EQ (level 8) but I thought I had a good<br/>
 </span></blockquote>understanding of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;it, and it&#39;s unwritten rules, until now.<br/>
		&gt;<br/>
		&gt;The other night I was in BlackBurrow in a small group of 3.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Two of us<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;were at the bottom level, and I was up top, returning from<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a town run. I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;saw a gnoll guardsman kill someone, so I ran up to take<br/>
 </span></blockquote>charge of it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;There was nobody else around it. After a few hits it fled<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to the lower<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;level with me chasing it every step, hacking and kicking.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Upon reaching<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;the lower level, there was a mini train already down there,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but both me,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;and the members of my group, were working on the gnoll<br/>
 </span></blockquote>guardsman I had<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;chased down. Towards the end of the fight, a fighter type<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of some sort<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;walked up and took the final swing on the guardsman.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thinking I had done<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;it ( I had to scroll back to look afterward) I bent over<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and looted the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;corpse.<br/>
		&gt;<br/>
		&gt;The fighter started complaining at once that I was a kill<br/>
 </span></blockquote>stealer and I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;took his loot. I explained to him that I had chased the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>monster down,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;and had done the most damage, and therefore the computer<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LET me take my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;kill. He respnded that HE had chased the monster down from<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the top (I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;never even saw anyone up top but myself) and had made the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>kill therefore<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;it wasn&#39;t mine to take. I didn&#39;t feel like the argument was<br/>
 </span></blockquote>worth it so<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;I gave up and tried to trade him the loot. He would not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>accept, but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;instead complained to me via tells that he couldn&#39;t believe<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did that.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;<br/>
		&gt;My questions are:<br/>
		&gt;1.) Was I ethically wrong to take the loot?<br/>
		&gt;2.) Does the game only allow the majority damage dealer to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>take the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;loot, or the final swinger?<br/>
		&gt;3.) How would you guys deal with this situation?<br/>
		&gt;<br/>
		&gt;Thanks for any advice ....<br/>
