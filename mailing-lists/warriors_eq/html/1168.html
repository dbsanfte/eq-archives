<div id="ygrps-yiv-563177695">I am in agreement as well.... Short of the fact that warriors are needed in<br/>
high level groups.  Let me backtrack a little bit.  Warriors at the lower<br/>
levels are far superior to hybrid classes in general.  But at the higer<br/>
levels, the hybrids have gained so many abilities and extras that the<br/>
warrior is overshadowed by the attributes of a hybrid.  Also, a hybrid can<br/>
fulfill the same role that a warrior can at those higher levels just as well<br/>
as a warrior can.  A warrior also has very little ability at higher levels<br/>
to use his taunt, bue to lack of damage inflicted to a mob.  I find this<br/>
happeneing to me at level 30 already.  How bad will this be at level 40?<br/>
The lack of a warrior being able to get a mob off the casters will make his<br/>
worth in the battle less.  Therefore groups will be more inclined to chose a<br/>
hybrid class as their tank.  This will cause a loss of people actually<br/>
playing warriors in the game, leading to the downfall of the class as a<br/>
whole.<br/>
<br/>
As for wizards/warrior argument.  Warriors are not supposed to do the damage<br/>
a wizard can do.  we are there as the shield so they can lay down the damage<br/>
at will....<br/>
<br/>
If you get into a good group that is working well together.  Where everyone<br/>
in the group knows there place in the group organization.  Wizards become<br/>
the secondary source of damage, not the primary.  If they nuke to soon, they<br/>
are mobbed, they have to hold their spells in check until the right time to<br/>
burn down the mob.  Yes, they do put some small burns into the middle of the<br/>
battle, but they shouldnt let loose the great damage spells until late in<br/>
the battle.  This is the true place where warriors shine.  But even at that,<br/>
by the time the battle nears where its time for the wizards power, the<br/>
warrior has done little except take alot of damage.  IMO we should be able<br/>
to help with some of the beginning portion of battles more than what we do.<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking that the majority of us agree on the critical hit issue.  How<br/>
do we feel about the specialization skills?  Also, remember that we cap all<br/>
of our skills (that didnt cap earlier) at 200.  Some of the hybrid classes<br/>
continue to be able to gain in skills past that.  I feel we should be able<br/>
to remove that cap on our skill and continue to progress in them.  We are<br/>
warriors, we never stop learning our art.<br/>

&gt; I whole heartedly agree with you wayne.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The game is about balance. Some people are saying that a group of really<br/>
&gt; high levels do not need warriors. I say thats BS my friends always want my<br/>
&gt; warrior in their group. Not just becuase im company mind you. Because they<br/>
&gt; are spell casters. If im not there, the MOB would latch onto them and<br/>
&gt; interrupt their casting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sure we could beg verant for one more skill .... critical hit , which is a<br/>
&gt; very good idea. And i like the idea of it being like ripsote and parry.<br/>
&gt; Makes more sense. But the fact of the matter is this: We are there to<br/>
&gt; prevent our spellcasting buddies from being hit by creatures so that THEY<br/>
&gt; can dish out the damage. I have never had anyone complain to me<br/>
&gt; and say look<br/>
&gt; man we dont want you in the group anymore cause you doont dish<br/>
&gt; out the most<br/>
&gt; damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Every group needs a good strong warrior.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Many of the Warriors here have complained that they cannot do damage as<br/>
&gt; &gt; fast<br/>
&gt; &gt; as a Wizard.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now all of you real life ninjas and steel sword swinging fools just calm<br/>
&gt; &gt; down.  Read carefully.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Warriors get to wear platemail and have many more hps than a Wizard.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Warriors also have a higher Offense, Defense, and Weapon<br/>
&gt; skills.  This all<br/>
&gt; &gt; means that a Warrior can stand toe to toe against an NPC.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now lets make a Warrior have the same ability to deal damage as<br/>
&gt; a Wizard.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now we would have a class that has the best armor, the highest combat<br/>
&gt; &gt; skills, the most hp&#39;s AND the ability to deal the most damage.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Why would anyone want to play a Wizard if a Warrior could do as much<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; AND be able to take blows in melee?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wayne<br/>
&gt; &gt; PS - When someone says that a Warrior should be able to deal as much<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; as fast as a Wizard I immediately realize this person doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have a clue<br/>
&gt; &gt; about game balance.<br/>
