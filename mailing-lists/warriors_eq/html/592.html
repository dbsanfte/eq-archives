<b>Subject:</b> Duel Weild & Sta. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379663">When I get Duel Weild I&#39;m prob. going to go with the best Mino. Batlle Axe <br/>
couse it does a wooping 8dmg/35delay and with my secondary wepon I&#39;ll prob. <br/>
use a Fine Steel Long Sword OR a barbed whip OR a combine long sword.<br/>
<br/>
P.S Could someone please tellme the specs. on the Fine Stell Long Sword, <br/>
Combine Long Sword and Barbed Whip?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  How do you cheack my skill in sta. and how do I get that skill up.<br/>
<br/>
P.S I also found that using kick often in a row draws your sta. down, but if <br/>
you use bash is dosn&#39;t seem to bring sta. down as much as kick.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve just got Perry skill and put 3 skill points into it.  Is this <br/>
automatic and I&#39;ve never seen it been used.  Is this skill even working and <br/>
is the skill going up?<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve just gotten Blacken Armor and replaced it with my banded and ringmail <br/>
armor!  Man, the weight is so much lighter and the AC is much more better!  <br/>
I suggest any lvl 12+ people go to the RiverVale area hunt though goblines <br/>
and get that armor! + is looks so cool!</div>
