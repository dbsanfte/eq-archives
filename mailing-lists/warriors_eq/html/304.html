&gt; Eat pizza while wackin scarabs in N Ro.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gf calls, talk 5 min, distracted by party members wanting to go,<br/>
&gt; partymember laughs at a humans butt in chainmail<br/>
&gt; gf hangs up askin me to call when the computer is turned off.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; chainmail.<br/>
&gt; run down to work, buy a sandwich on the way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
