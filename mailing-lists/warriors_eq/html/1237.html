<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514994742">HEY, don&#39;t cancle... think about it.. when you look at GM&#39;s what do you <br/>
see... lvl 50&#39;s ..ShodowKnights,Paladians and what..huh Warriors!  There&#39;s <br/>
go to be something at lvl 35+ about warriors, we&#39;re strong, skilled and can <br/>
take the dmg, we&#39;re perfict tankers in groups and witht he right items we <br/>
can take out shit hard and fast!<br/>
<br/>
One problem with warriors!!!  We MUST, I REPEAT MUST, have the best item we <br/>
can get at our leves, why.. couse we lack the skill of spells...with the <br/>
right items we&#39;re powerfull...<br/>
<br/>
I can kill steall from a lvl 18-20 wiizie and I&#39;m only lvl 15, why couse I <br/>
have steel plaited pants and magical steel plated boots, Bloodstained tunic <br/>
and arms, one Bracer O&#39; Battle, other a +dex bracelete, two +STG rights, <br/>
Steel Green Plated helm, one combined LS and in the other hand a FS LS...<br/>
<br/>
NOT trying to brag but with the right and best items we can do damge!!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t quite my friend, EQ made the warriors class one of the best! you&#39;ll <br/>
see!<br/>

I play a 38th halfling warrior on Povar... I have some dam good equipment<br/>
and am one of the higher warriors on the server... But something happened to<br/>
me yesterday that I think highlights the warrior classes weakness... I<br/>
decided I wanted to get that new dragoon&#39;s dirk from Dvinn in Crushbone...<br/>
So I went there, camped in his room, for those of you that dont know, Dvinn<br/>
is about a 25th level DE that is very tough.... He spawned and I attacked<br/>
him... low and behold a wizzie... AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE.... ran into the<br/>
room, and started blasting him!  Guess what? AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE STOLE<br/>
DVINN FROM A 38TH LEVEL WARRIOR!!!!!  Do I need to say ANYTHING else? btw I<br/>
was using a zweildahander.... This was the most embarassing thing that has<br/>
ever happened to me... I&#39;m sitting there in almost full rubicite, all these<br/>
cool items, everyone is looking at me... and then i have the thing stolen<br/>
from me by ONE, not a group, but ONE 18th level wizzie......grumbles<br/>
something about warriors suck and I am ready to cancel my account...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Eogun on Povar<br/>
