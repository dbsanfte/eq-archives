<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952833067">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
In the vein of discussing mystery skills; how the devil does alcohol tolerance work?<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me (mine is in mid twenties) that I can just drink more (and gain the extra str & sta & lower int) without the twirls.  If you drink more (with greater tolerance) do you keep getting more str & sta or is there a cap?  If so why bother drinking a ton of booze (especially if you don&#39;t get drunk!)?  Does the lowered int influence the rate you improve skills (I haven&#39;t noticed any difference so far)?<br/>
<br/>
It would seem that at high levels this might be handy thing for warriors to have (if you can keep the extra str & sta longer).  Anyone have experience with this?<br/>
