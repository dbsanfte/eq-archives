<div id="ygrps-yiv-653564216">I have used one handed slash all my characters life.  I am currently lvl 16, and having a hard time building up two handed slash.  I tried last level with no ranks in it, then I tried again with 5 ranks in it.  Do I have to wait to level again so I can train 5 more ranks in it?</div>
