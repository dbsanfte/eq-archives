When i hit 17 i found myself looking to get cash as well. But i didnt want<br/>
to skimp out on exp either. I was sick and tired of befallen so i decided to<br/>
go test my luck at Lake Rathe. Well lets just say i was there for a long<br/>
long time and still am. During the day look for the occasional gnoll<br/>
embalmer or high shaman (Shamans have runed totem staffs while embalmers<br/>
carry magic skulls and crysknives ) Or hunt any of the aviaks you see, the<br/>
drop bronze weapons and cash or words for research, all sell for a few gold<br/>
or plat. At night the undead come out and they are somewhat tough so get in<br/>
a group and kill the drybones for small bronze. <br/>
<br/>
Thats what i did around your level.<br/>

&gt; I am currently in HH collecting extra ringmail to sell in Halas so I can <br/>
&gt; have enough money to buy a combine longsword but it is getting so boring.<br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; have nevered seen that named gnoll fellow even though I spend most of my <br/>
&gt; time hunting gnolls.  At any rate, it there a better place for a level 17 <br/>
&gt; Warrior to get herself a magic weapon then HH (or saving up plat for a <br/>
&gt; combine sword).<br/>
