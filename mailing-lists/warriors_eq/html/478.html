<div id="ygrps-yiv-561567404">I&#39;m going the big two handed sword route myself (a shiny brass halberd is<br/>
my weapon now), but what I have heard from a source I trust (my guild<br/>
leader who was a warrior like I was in beta) is to put the faster weapon in<br/>
your main hand. The 2nd attack goes based on when the first one does. The<br/>
more often the first one swings, the more often the 2nd does also. Spirit<br/>
of the bear, a shaman spell, though others may get it also, will keep your<br/>
stamina up.<br/>

If not, which should I switch?<br/>
Does it matter which is in my primary had?&lt;</div>
