<div id="ygrps-yiv-166258072">Warriors are not solo&#39;ers, plain and simple.  We require a cleric to be<br/>
really usefull.  And at later levels we need a wizard to do the majority of<br/>
the damage.  BUT at the same time, wizards need us to keep the monsters off<br/>
of them so they can cast their spells.  All in all I gotta give verant 2<br/>
thumbs up on their design, the classes are pretty well balanced, no one<br/>
class is really any more powerfull than any other class (due to each classes<br/>
weaknesses), every group pretty much relies upon 3 things, a tank, a cleric,<br/>
and a wizard.<br/>
<br/>
As for the PvP server, well, wizards defintially have some advantages<br/>
there....but thats another story I don&#39;t care to get into.<br/>
<br/>
as for us being weak offensivly....well thats debatable, at least when<br/>
talking about group play non pvp.  Sure we don&#39;t actually dish out the<br/>
damage, but we make it possible for the casters to be able to dish out the<br/>
damage, so looking at it that way, we have tremendous offensive powers.  As<br/>
they say, a good defense is the best offense, and NO BODY can match a<br/>
warriors defensive tanking power :)<br/>

&gt; In RPGs, my heart and soul has always fit that of a warrior.  But, having<br/>
&gt; played a warrior to level 12 on Zek, and having suffered<br/>
&gt; countless setbacks<br/>
&gt; there, mostly but not exclusively involving PKs (one time 2<br/>
&gt; yellow wizards<br/>
&gt; wiped my level 11&#39;s full hps out in less than ten seconds after rooting),<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that warriors are, more than anyone<br/>
&gt; else, forced<br/>
&gt; to wear and use the juiciest items to obtain xp while at the same<br/>
&gt; being the<br/>
&gt; most vulnerable (after we&#39;ve used our hps to get xp, non-hiders<br/>
&gt; are out of<br/>
&gt; options without spell-casting bodyguards) and least<br/>
&gt; dangerous/flexible/useful<br/>
&gt; of the classes.  Furthermore, if/when we do get an advantage against an<br/>
&gt; enemy, we&#39;re really bad at actually finishing them off (escaping<br/>
&gt; from us with<br/>
&gt; impunity is a big option).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard some very encouraging things from some of you more successful<br/>
&gt; folks contradicting my conclusions and I&#39;d like to hear more.  I&#39;m not so<br/>
&gt; much concerned with the PKers as I am concerned that a party of<br/>
&gt; four wizards,<br/>
&gt; a magician and a necro might just be slowed down by a warrior tank (best<br/>
&gt; defense = good offense + we seem to suck at offense more than<br/>
&gt; most casters<br/>
&gt; w/pets suck at defense, etc.)  Many other classes could fit into<br/>
&gt; that group<br/>
&gt; and be less of a drag, I think...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not at all interested in theories or how things look on paper<br/>
&gt; from people<br/>
&gt; who&#39;ve farted around like I have to 12th or even 16th level.  I am more<br/>
&gt; interested in hearing how things are actually working/not working<br/>
&gt; for us in<br/>
&gt; the grand scheme of things before I can seriously committ to<br/>
&gt; trying to make<br/>
&gt; my warrior work in this game and on RZ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
