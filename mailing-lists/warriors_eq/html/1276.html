<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353531359">I&#39;ve grouped with twinked warriors like that (I am 26, he was 23). Full<br/>
small bronze, demonclaw, granite tommy, and thick leather apron (I<br/>
understand small bronze is easier to get than large bronze). Want to know<br/>
something? He though he was in invulnerable. He couldn&#39;t play a warrior at<br/>
all (before I grabbed pulling duties from him he did a pull while all the<br/>
casters and the healer were OOM). Tanking is an art form. That&#39;s why these<br/>
high level wizards have to get good stuff for their own or a friend&#39;s<br/>
warrior. People don&#39;t know how to play warriors. If you want to take out<br/>
one monster, yes a warrior is not the way to go. A shaman buddy who is the<br/>
same level as me can kite an aviak avocet (level 28 or 29). This takes him<br/>
about 40 minutes and is in his words, boring. I wouyld prolly last oh maybe<br/>
30 seconds and if lucky have the avocet down a quarter health before I was<br/>
dead. I have seen very few good items come off a solo monster, and every<br/>
good item I have gotten has come off something red to me with a blue or two<br/>
in the area. Why do I think tanking is an art form? The people in your<br/>
party have to trust you, especially healers. Once that healer starts<br/>
casting on you, the monsters are going to go to him/her. If all they are<br/>
doing is healing, pulling them off with a few whacks of your weapon and<br/>
three or four taunts is not that hard. Mages cannot go all out without<br/>
rooting first, and if that root fails early or gets resisted, watch  him<br/>
run. There is no way a 28 or even a 32 wizard could take out the groups two<br/>
26 th level tanks and a 26 th level shaman can take out. We take 3 lizard<br/>
defenders out of the maze in cazic thule and are all beat down maybe half<br/>
at the end of the battle (regen has become my most favorite buff, even<br/>
above SoW). A 26th level wizard tries one defender, whoops, a little resist<br/>
or a fizzle, and there we are saving his behind. A guildmate was with a<br/>
group (17-20) hunting a SBH and along comes a 32nd level wizard (from a big<br/>
time power levelling guild on our server). This guy says I get the SBH when<br/>
it spawns, I need it for my paladin, or you guys won&#39;t get anything. If I<br/>
had been there. I woulda said ok, lets take a 20 minute break from hunting<br/>
and see how much spawns and whether or not he has to run. When some high<br/>
level wizard comes in and starts to kill steal for a rare item, don&#39;t tank<br/>
for him. Back off and watch him die. It&#39;s almost as much fun as watching<br/>
dwarf paladins die (one combo I have seen over and over again solo and<br/>
fail). Again I don&#39;t know about over level 35, but from around 16 or 17 on<br/>
to where I am now at 26, tanks are needed. I see calls often in CT &#39;looking<br/>
for a 30ish tank for throne room&#39;. Why do they need that? Multiple<br/>
gorrillas that need taking out that the wizards just can&#39;t do (the wizards<br/>
are 32 or so and the gorrillas around 25). My recomendations for good<br/>
groups in that range is 2 tanks (hybrids are ok), one bard or rogue (they<br/>
both bring unigue skills and tactics with), a shaman (yeah clerics heal<br/>
more, but the buffs from shamans are so great for melee), and a wizard or<br/>
an enchanter. If you haven&#39;t hunted with an enchanter over level 20, you<br/>
have no idea what you are missing. Pull multiple blues with an enchanter of<br/>
that level with you, and instantly (one spell), you are fighting one less.<br/>
Then when the rest are dead, go back and finish off the one that the<br/>
enchanter took care of (it ain&#39;t dead, but it won&#39;t hurt you). In groups<br/>
similar to these I made the full level from cracking 25 and getting riposte<br/>
to 26 in under 12 hours of playing time, and even more important, didn&#39;t<br/>
die once in that span of time in Cazic-Thule.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Damn, Green steels plate helm, and steels pants an such.  The only things<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have been able to get at lvl 16 are full bronze, Bs mantle, some ohter<br/>
stuff, and 2 combine LS&#39;s.  And I still have to rest forever from even a<br/>
green Desert madman.  Personally, I k!<br/>
now a lot of people at low lvls with Dark Reavers and steel plate. <br/>
Personally it makes me sick, they either bring up some excuse like being a<br/>
smith ( and nowadays they don&#39;t earn jack), or they get things from a<br/>
friend, hehe.<br/>
