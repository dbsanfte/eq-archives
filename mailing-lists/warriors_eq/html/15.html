My male human warrior is Snyak - bound at Qeynos on Innorruk. I made level 9<br/>
last night - woo hoo!  Twice actually - too many stupid deaths: Holly got me<br/>
when I was not looking, that dang Gnoll Commander in Black Burrow that hangs<br/>
out on the far side of the river on the left once you get down by the rock<br/>
and the first bridge.  One time I tried to drag him back to a wizard friend<br/>
for an ambush but got dizzy and he whacked me good.  Next time, I came back<br/>
with more friends - a wizard and a druid and we tried to gang him.  We had<br/>
him too and then 2 more of his GS buds showed up and we were ded meat at<br/>
that point.<br/>
But he is gonna pay for that because I am coming back with all my friends<br/>
and we are gonna hand him a full can of KickButt(tm)!<br/>
So, even at level 8 I have been finding it harder and harder to get xp -<br/>
solo or in partys.  I have been doing either BB (for loot) or West Karanas<br/>
(for xp).  Are the aqueducts any good for low 9&#39;s?  I kinda really hate<br/>
mazes and tunnels - I still get lost going to the bank!  Or is it time to<br/>
venture forth?  I have been to N Karanas (hate gryfawns with a passion!) and<br/>
S Karanas near Split Paw one time but MD seemed low then.<br/>
One of my goals is to try to catch a cleric friend who is at level 14 (he<br/>
got a real job so he can&#39;t play EQ all day long no more :-)  But I am up for<br/>
adventure as well.  And I have spent some time helping others and that&#39;s fun<br/>
too.  <br/>
Any thoughts?</div>
