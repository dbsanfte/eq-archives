<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543487858">Hail, I&#39;m a 21st level Barbarian Warrior on Rallos Zek.  Currently I dual wield polished granite tomahawk axes (don&#39;t ask about how long it took me, or how many fools try to take them away) and can safely say they kick so much ass. How else can a Warrior steal kills from a Caster???  Anyway, I currently only have ringmail and some banded for armor and what I really want is plate.  Bronze plate I hear is fairly reasonable, though heavy, which shouldn&#39;t be a problem with my high Strength.  Does anyone know where the best place to acquire Medium sized Bronze plate is?  I&#39;ve got my weapons, and now I need to beef up my armor.<br/>
