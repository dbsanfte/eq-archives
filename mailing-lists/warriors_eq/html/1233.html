<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263016191">Actually I am level 16.  The main reason I didn&#39;t venture into Blackburrow<br/>
was because I was already down on experience, had no friends with me, and<br/>
didn&#39;t know my way around.  I killed Gnasher who was chasing some<br/>
unfortunate and buffed some of the newbies.  I even gave out some of the<br/>
rusty and worn weapons I had acquired in my Karanas travels.<br/>
<br/>
I &#39;d like to hunt in East Karanas but I will wait for some friends to join<br/>
me.  I don&#39;t want to die alone in a strange land, a wood elf far from home.<br/>

I enjoy reading everything - if I don&#39;t like it the delete key is close by.<br/>

Funny to hear that you did not go into BlackBurrow. There is a wide variety<br/>
of levels in there but generally its good for 6 - 10&#39;s I&#39;d say (your other<br/>
stuff implies that you are quite a bit higher than 10 - esp if you are<br/>
killing Gryfawns in EK.) The elites (which are pretty hard but under 15 I<br/>
think) stay buried pretty deep. And the trains are pretty easy to avoid.<br/>
Some groups will make it their business to stop trains. That is they wait<br/>
for the train and attack it for the kicks. It&#39;s a great place for groups -<br/>
even 8, 9, 10&#39;s grouped have a great time in there. And it&#39;s the first<br/>
really good (for that level) place to get loot.<br/>
<br/>
The worst part of BB is that it is buggy if you die in there. I have died<br/>
down on the second level (lower) and come back to not be able to find my<br/>
corpse. Even the bard says it points to a wall and there is nothing on the<br/>
other side of the wall. So, I start asking in /ooc and someone tells me<br/>
they see it on the first level (upper.) Sometimes the guy who dies cannot<br/>
see his own corpse but the guy standing right next to him can. And then<br/>
sometimes it gets overlayed by terrain textures and if you are lucky - there<br/>
will be the toe of a boot or something sticking out that you can click on to<br/>
loot. Other times you die and your corpse will be on the bottom of the<br/>
water - even though you died on land.<br/>

I died alot this weekend. Bad luck, incompetence of others, various other<br/>
reasons.<br/>
<br/>
I also travelled through the Karanas, North, south, and east. I also checked<br/>
out Queynos hill, Surefall glades and Blackburrow. Didn&#39;t really wander<br/>
black burrow at all. Fear of trains and other recent deaths made me choose<br/>
not to stay. I found the Karanas to be full of excellent prey.<br/>
