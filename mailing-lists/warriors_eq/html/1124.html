<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892181575">(I am in agreement with alot of what this post says.  I have never seen<br/>
anyone put together so much detail concerning the downers of a warrior.  I<br/>
too have been waiting for the levels when we start to shine as a group<br/>
member.  Not just a punchin bag that is expendable because if things go very<br/>
wrong, we stand and take the death while everyone else can get away.  For a<br/>
long time now I have had discussions concerning specialization in a weapon<br/>
skill or two.  This is mentioned again in this post, I would like to know<br/>
everyones opinions on this.)<br/>

Warrior&#39;s STINK.<br/>
<br/>
Okay I&#39;ve sat down and written this little thingie over the past few weeks,<br/>
in places it repeats itself, you may even find it<br/>
incoherant in places. And hell I&#39;m to lazy to load it up in a real word<br/>
processor to run a spell check (go notepad!). But<br/>
take it as it is, I think it still has something important to say:<br/>
<br/>
I play a level 46 troll warrior in EverQuest. In most every game I play I&#39;m<br/>
always a warrior and fairly happy with the role<br/>
and abilities warriors are given in most games, wether it be an online or<br/>
offline game. Now when I was making my troll<br/>
warrior I did a little research and heard things like this:<br/>
<br/>
- Warriors get more hitpoints than any other class.<br/>
- Warriors at high levels do more damage than any other melee class.<br/>
- Warriors have the best selection of magic and mundane weapons and armor.<br/>
- Warriors are the most skilled at weapon-to-weapon combat.<br/>
<br/>
Now some of these are things people take for granted about the sterotypical<br/>
role of a warrior others are conclusions that can<br/>
be made after reading comments made by Verant about warriors (wish I&#39;d<br/>
cliped the quotes to put here).<br/>
<br/>
So for the first few levels I was pretty happy with the warrior, with a<br/>
trolls regeneration you can quickly get out of the<br/>
lower levels. My first observation of an imbalance was that all other melee<br/>
classes were advancing just as fast in weapon<br/>
skills, with 5 additional points of offense and weapon skill each level. So<br/>
that a level 10 Shadow Knight and a level 10<br/>
Warrior would both have the same weapon and offense skills (assuming they&#39;re<br/>
using the same type of weapon). So I&#39;m saying<br/>
to myself what&#39;s the point of a warrior? Our melee skills are not outshining<br/>
anyone.<br/>
<br/>
So life goes on, now I&#39;m around level 20 or so and still I haven&#39;t found any<br/>
equipment that puts warriors above others, our<br/>
skills are still on par with anyone else. So what about the duel wield,<br/>
double attack issue? Well by this level rangers get<br/>
them both, monks get them both (with a higher skill level than any class),<br/>
thieves get them both. And so well warriors get<br/>
them both. So again I begin to question the point of warriors.<br/>
<br/>
So now I start comparing hitpoints. Well rangers don&#39;t have as many<br/>
hitpoints.. but they can buff themselves and heal<br/>
themselves.. monks don&#39;t have as many hitpoints but they can mend themselves<br/>
(and don&#39;t tell me, oh but if it fails they get<br/>
hurt bad, cuz I group regularly with a monk since level 37 and I have yet to<br/>
see him fail a mend)... ShadowKnights don&#39;t have<br/>
as many hitpoints but they have HP drains... Paladin&#39;s don&#39;t have as many<br/>
hitpoints but they can buff, heal and lay hands..<br/>
So in the end I actually end up having LESS hitpoints than most any other<br/>
melee class because after buffs and considering<br/>
healing and life drains the other melee classes (except rogues) have more HP<br/>
than me. But being a troll with a high stanima<br/>
I get a few extra hitpoints here and there which add up to around 150 more<br/>
HP over other melee classes (at level 46 mind<br/>
you). At level 46 this accounts for maybe two additional hits from a monster<br/>
worth XP. So a warrior&#39;s benefit is not in<br/>
it&#39;s hitpoints.<br/>
<br/>
So what about armor, they can wear most anything right, so they should have<br/>
extra high AC? Well not quiet, even tho rangers<br/>
can&#39;t wear plate, they can wear most magical versions of it, and they have<br/>
AC buffs. Paladins, ShadowKnights, Bards can all<br/>
wear plate also (man the acoustics of playing an instrument in full<br/>
platemail must be odd). And of course these classes ALSO<br/>
have AC buffs! Then there are monks, well they can&#39;t wear much armor.. but<br/>
the lighter they are the more AC they get! So<br/>
again I&#39;m left out saying, well what&#39;s a warrior good for?<br/>
<br/>
So someone tells me, well most melee classes skills cap at level 30 and<br/>
warriors keep on going. Well level 30 rolls around,<br/>
and other melee classes keep right up with me. So maybe it&#39;s level 35 they<br/>
cap, nope. Well maybe they cap at level 40 and<br/>
warriors can goto above 200. Well level 40 rolls around and yes other melee<br/>
classes do cap at 200, well warriors do ALSO!<br/>
UGH. I&#39;ve held out so long waiting for some benefit of warriors to shine<br/>
through, kept getting told at higher levels you<br/>
really shine! Well I&#39;m at the higher levels and if anything WARRIORS are the<br/>
WORST melee class beyond level 40 (gauging my<br/>
experience with grouping with high level Rangers, Monks and ShadowKnights).<br/>
In fact Monks don&#39;t cap at 40! They can go<br/>
above 200! But my Parry, Riposte, Pierce, 1h Slash, 2h slash, taunt, bash,<br/>
ALL of them maxed at 200!<br/>
<br/>
So then there is the allure of the Executioner&#39;s Axe. A warrior&#39;s dream<br/>
weapon, the only warrior only weapon known of (well<br/>
recently found a warrior only shield/weapon combo item but it ain&#39;t a dream<br/>
weapon by far) and it is a good item (assuming<br/>
haste goes off often enough). But you can&#39;t get it till you are in your<br/>
40&#39;s, the monster with it rarely has it, rarely<br/>
spawns, is deep in a dungeon and has a nice assortment of guards. And now<br/>
that I finally have the weapon, I find out it is<br/>
TERRIBLLY handicapped! The haste on it only lasts 10 seconds which at most<br/>
allows for 3 or 4 swings! And the damage range<br/>
is so large it&#39;s a hopeless weapon as you never know if you&#39;ll get a hundred<br/>
9 damage hits or a hundred 80 damage hits! I&#39;ve<br/>
gone complete fights without doing more than 100HP in damage! With upto 12<br/>
misses in a row! In 4 duels, 2 using<br/>
Executioners Axe, 2 using Painbringer and Shield of The Slain Unicorn. The 2<br/>
with Executioners Axe were a 50/50 chance that<br/>
if we had gone to death who would of won (mind you I was dueling a<br/>
ShadowKnight who was using buffs but NOT using his other<br/>
spells and was 4 levels below me). Using the sword and shield combo I was<br/>
the clear winner. Not to mention the fact a<br/>
class should NOT be defined by a SINGLE weapon they can&#39;t get until they&#39;re<br/>
almost level 50!<br/>
<br/>
And on a side note why do warriors seem to have to wait LAST to get a<br/>
&quot;superweapon&quot;? I&#39;ve found (or friends have) caster,<br/>
ranger, paladin &quot;superweapons&quot; and know where an SK one is that we can kill<br/>
the monster with it but it rarely has the item is<br/>
the problem. Man I&#39;m so fed up. And of course if I had my choice I&#39;d much<br/>
rather duel wield 2 Ebony Blades as they&#39;re<br/>
better than Painbringer (which btw is a lore, nodrop item so forget duel<br/>
wielding the only nice warrior weapon I&#39;ve ever<br/>
seen).<br/>
<br/>
So now that I&#39;ve disproved about every advantaged you&#39;d figure warriors<br/>
would have here some other general ranting:<br/>
<br/>
On top of all this Monk&#39;s NEVER die if they know how to use Fiegn Death (the<br/>
monk I group with has died twice from level<br/>
37 to 49, while I have died 8 times between level 45 and 46 alone). Shadow<br/>
Knights have Feign Death (as a spell) and<br/>
invisibility! Rangers get similiar abilities (though generally outdoors<br/>
only). So most classes have ways to avoid being<br/>
attacked or ways of getting out of being attacked. Except warriors. So since<br/>
we can&#39;t avoid fights and we can&#39;t get out of<br/>
a fight the everything over level 18 is aggressive rule REALLY screws<br/>
warriors over as we have to fight through EVERYTHING to<br/>
get to anything.<br/>
<br/>
Okay then I&#39;ve finally found something I can solo for XP when my friends are<br/>
not around to group with me. Well in general<br/>
those monsters will run away and are deep in dungeons, and warrior&#39;s CANNOT<br/>
handle runners! Rangers get ensnares and roots<br/>
(and Ebony Blades), SKs get darknesses, or heck they have mana to burn<br/>
things up with. Even a monk can chase things down<br/>
kill it and if anyone else attacks they just fiegn death! UGH UGH UGH UGH<br/>
UGH. SO WHAT IS THE POINT OF WARRIORS?!?!?!? Can<br/>
anyone tell me?<br/>
<br/>
Please? And don&#39;t say it&#39;s a low XP table. The XP tables in Everquest are SO<br/>
messed up it&#39;s not even funny. They&#39;re messed<br/>
up to the point that a monk gets almost 2 levels to my 1 level and the Monk<br/>
is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much more powerful than I<br/>
am, not to mention they RARELY die.<br/>
<br/>
We are not the lords of battle in any stretch of the mind in the world of<br/>
Norrath. Look at the original four things I&#39;ve<br/>
stated. Well I&#39;ve disproved them all. Heck even worse other melee classes<br/>
spells still improve (and they get new ones) past<br/>
level 40 so that means their buffs get better, but my skills are all parked<br/>
at 200 (well offense and defense goto 210)! And<br/>
well monks they might not have as high ATK as me, but hell they&#39;re still<br/>
getting quadruple (!!!!!) punches for over 50 damage<br/>
a hit and kicks over 80 damage! WTF! THIS MAKES NO SENSE. Assuming I got MAX<br/>
damage in a single round using a Gigiantic<br/>
Zweihander I would do 130 damage in 3.9 seconds, or with an Ashenwood Spear<br/>
and Polished Granite Tomahawk I would do 104<br/>
damage in 2.4 seconds. But of course I&#39;ve never gotten anywhere NEAR max<br/>
damage. Now compare this to a Monks max damage,<br/>
200+ damage just with punches in approximately 3.0 seconds! This just really<br/>
sucks.<br/>
<br/>
And of course there are the past few patches. I see things changing for<br/>
other classes making them MORE powerful and here I<br/>
sit being SCREWED over ROYALLY. But warriors can wear platemail! Well all<br/>
other melee classes can wear various forms of<br/>
magic platemail (mithril, silvered, rubicite, pick your poison) so that<br/>
discussion is null and void. So in the end I cannot<br/>
think of a single advantage warriors have over ANY other class AT ALL. Thank<br/>
you Verant for setting me up for the fall. I<br/>
didn&#39;t expect warriors to rule the earth at level 50, and I NEVER expect<br/>
them EVER to be a heavy solo class beyond the early<br/>
levels, but hey at least let us be the kings of melee combat or share the<br/>
title with monks. And with less mana now spent<br/>
when a spell fizzles and spell specilization (in or on it&#39;s way) you&#39;ve made<br/>
every casting class just that much more<br/>
powerful.<br/>
<br/>
They could double the ammount of damage a warrior could dish out and it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t seriously disrupt things (I&#39;m not saying<br/>
this is a viable solution, just that if it was done we&#39;d be the lords of<br/>
battle but still couldn&#39;t solo). Hell at level 40<br/>
I can&#39;t even solo a GREEN Cyclops, yet my monk friend albeit with some<br/>
difficulty can at least solo a BLUE griffon). If I<br/>
did twice the damage sure I could solo it but then when it ran away I still<br/>
would not be able to finish it due to the<br/>
tons of other monsters that would join in (not to mention the poor<br/>
prediction code which makes it so hard to chase things).<br/>
Thanks Verant. Damnit I&#39;m so pissed. Why couldn&#39;t you at least let our<br/>
weapon skills goto 255? Why is a ranger just as<br/>
good at me in melee combat and have spells? Why do monks just completely<br/>
kick my ass? And in a monk vs warrior duel at high<br/>
levels the time it would take would be over 5 mintues (or I should say the<br/>
time it would take me to kill a monk would be over<br/>
5 minutes, although a monk could prolly kill me in less than 5 minutes) in<br/>
length so a monk would end up getting more than 1<br/>
mend during the fight making his HP total far outweigh any warriors.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I got going for me is being a troll with high regen and some<br/>
extra strength and stanima. But this doesn&#39;t<br/>
ammount to much considering we can do NO QUESTS (Verant WHERE THE HELL ARE<br/>
THE TROLL QUESTS IN GROBB?), I can&#39;t get good<br/>
faction with other places enough to do quests. And everything under the sun<br/>
hates me. The whole faction system is so dumb<br/>
in the end the only people it hurts are evil races. Bleh well now I&#39;m off<br/>
the topic of why warriors get SCREWED, why trolls<br/>
get screwed is a whole different topic. So goodday to those who&#39;ve bothered<br/>
to read this from start to finish. If I&#39;ve<br/>
overlooked something significant let me know. I&#39;d love to know my character<br/>
is worth something. Warriors from level 42<br/>
onward GET NOTHING. Oh and our flaunted taunt skill, well the farther your<br/>
teammates move above level 40 the more worthless<br/>
the skill becomes to the point now I can rarely taunt anything off anyone.<br/>
And why when I use a 2 handed weapon does taunt<br/>
work ALOT less than when I use 2 one handed weapons? Damnit Verant I&#39;m so<br/>
fed up, will you quit tweaking every class into<br/>
superhuman beings and pay attention to warriors for a BRIEF second to come<br/>
up with something besides &quot;Beserking Frenzy&quot;.<br/>
Beserking Frenzy? This is supposed to be something good? Please Verant, when<br/>
it says &quot;You have entered a beserking frenzy&quot;<br/>
that&#39;s my cue to zone cuz I&#39;m going to die if I stick around. I guess it&#39;s<br/>
not fair to complain so much about my class<br/>
without a suggestion or two to make warriors a more viable class to play. If<br/>
I were to rebalance the warrior class I would<br/>
do 2 simple things.<br/>
<br/>
1) Let our weapon skills goto 255. This includes 1h slash, 2h slash,<br/>
piercing, 1h blunt, 2h blunt and offense maybe even<br/>
riposte and or parry. Perhaps not even all the way upto 255 but somewhere<br/>
above other melee classes and enough that it<br/>
makes a noticable differance in combat.<br/>
2) Allow a warrior to specialize in 1 or 2 forms of weapons (for instance 1h<br/>
and 2h slash, or piercing and 1h blunt). Your<br/>
skill in specilization reduces your weapon delay, not by tons. But lets say<br/>
you have a 1h slash specilization of 200,<br/>
any 1h slash weapon you wield would be swung 10 percent faster than it&#39;s<br/>
given delay, maybe even only 5 percent but<br/>
something slightly faster.<br/>
<br/>
Some other things I&#39;d consider doing:<br/>
<br/>
1) Let our defensive skills go up higher than 210 also.<br/>
2) Let us have access to ALL weapon and armor except the class specific<br/>
items (robes, monk headbands, bard instruments).<br/>
3) Make gate potions more available and more reliable (I&#39;ve used a gate<br/>
potions in which it tells me the zone is loading<br/>
only to find myself a few minutes later standing right where I was when I<br/>
drank the potion and then promptly killed)<br/>
<br/>
Even if you did all of these things you are not significantly changing the<br/>
balance of the game at all as the warrior&#39;s<br/>
biggest weaknesses are still it&#39;s down fall, we can&#39;t get out of a tight<br/>
situation, and we can&#39;t heal ourselves. At most<br/>
this enables us to keep up with Monks damage wise and also to pull our<br/>
selves apart from melee classes and MAYBE be the best<br/>
melee class. And at least be considered a viable member of a group.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One helluva pissed off troll warrior.</div>
