&gt; few stats as well cant recall them off hand). If all 3 hit(3 waves of 56<br/>
&gt; each) its 164 points a proc and on my warrior I usually resist near all of<br/>
&gt; it.  The aoe is very small and if your in a group w/o an enchanter there is<br/>
&gt; really no reason not to use it IMO(Unless you have better which isn&#39;t too<br/>
&gt; tough its not that good). But with Garu I can proc 7 to 10 times on a exp<br/>
&gt; mob. (10x 164= 1640dmg, not too bad).  This is coming from a player who&#39;s<br/>
&gt; main is a 55 enchanter so I am suppose to hate aoe weapons.  Does anyone<br/>
&gt; know of anyother AOE weapons with a halfway all right proc?  I would love to<br/>
&gt; have one for my off hand as well as main for those times when no Enchanter<br/>
&gt; is around and for single pulls.<br/>

&gt; Wow THE Kailyn?  The same fellow from the old eq.stratics board?  The<br/>
&gt; guy who discovered the STA/HP formula & the Agi/AC formulas? If so its<br/>
&gt; darn good to hear from you again.  I learned alot of what I needed to<br/>
&gt; know about warrioring from that board.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I indeed was part of the great warrior sitout (I think the first<br/>
&gt; sitout). I remember Fitty, Ruatha & all the other Stratics guys egging<br/>
&gt; all the warriors on to particpate (things really were hard on early<br/>
&gt; warriors).   I was laughing when over your story about bronze...I myself<br/>
&gt; did not get full bronze until lvl 24 (?) if I remember right.  Heck I<br/>
&gt; used dual Mino Axes until lvl 18 (then had to get a combine long sword<br/>
&gt; to kill undead in Unrest).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW another great warrior weapon to add to the &quot;uber&quot; list you mentioned<br/>
&gt; is the bloodpoint 10/21 procs an 80 pt hp txf & is not lore (drops in<br/>
&gt; Howling Stones).  I have 1 of these at the moment & with werwolf form<br/>
&gt; see 8-9 procs a fight.  My goal in life (other than get to lvl 56 &<br/>
&gt; riposte) is to obtain another.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good to hear from you bro<br/>
