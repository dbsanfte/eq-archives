<div id="ygrps-yiv-838170977">I woulf love to have a katana.  Think about duel wielding a katana/ wakizashi <br/>
combo.  Slice and dice.  And think about how awesome your character would <br/>
look in Samurai armor.  I&#39;d defenatly vote for katanas and all other things <br/>
oriental to be added to EQ.  My only problem is I keep trying to capitalize <br/>
the word katana, as it will be my name when I go into pro wrestling.</div>
