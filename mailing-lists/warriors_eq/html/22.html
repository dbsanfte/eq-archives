<b>Subject:</b> Are there ANY half-elf warriors besides me? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969111370">Just wondering if there are any half-elf warriors out there.  I am level 5 now and am hanging around with a high elf wizard and a wood elf ranger (Both level 8).  We can do some serious damage, but it is tough to know what I should be working on since no one else seems to match my race/class.  ANY info you can give would be good.  Also, what armor can I use?  I haven&#39;t found any near Kelethin of Felwithe that is compatible with me.  Oh well, not much near those cities can really put the hurt on me anyway, unless I got grouped up on by some Orc Centurions, even they don&#39;t usually stand a chance when I fight the one&#39;s that con white to me (or yellow sometimes) and I get the alone.  <br/>
