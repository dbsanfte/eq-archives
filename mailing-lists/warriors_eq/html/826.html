<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197013296">I have read lots of posts about kill stealing, people not standing in line <br/>
on camp sites, blablabla,<br/>
<br/>
Personaly I always play a nice guy. I try to get along with most people and <br/>
U usually do it pretty well.<br/>
If people are idiots I just dont bother with em.<br/>
I usually dont camp for items cus its often faster getting the muny to buy <br/>
it of the player that camped it and you get xp doing it.<br/>
<br/>
But this is a differet thing, I think.<br/>
How did this guy start off?<br/>
Did he do it in character or ooc?<br/>
Since the guy is a darkelf he should/could steal as much as he wanted too, <br/>
since darkelves don show any respect for anyone.<br/>
BUT, if you are a troll and/or he was talkin ooc stuff to you,<br/>
its a whole different thing.<br/>
<br/>
to sum it up, evil chars can do pretty much whatever they want as log as <br/>
they do it in character, ooc badmouthing is stupid and I dont think that <br/>
players that do that should play eq, thats what quake is for.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, and thats important<br/>

&gt;Commonlands, et al.  One day in the desert this nasty little dark elf<br/>
&gt;shadowknight has hanging around and this guy is a known kill-stealer and a<br/>
&gt;real jerk (anyone who frequents the desert *might* know who I&#39;m t/*alking<br/>
&gt;about).  He was hanging around our party making rude gestures at us </span></blockquote></div>
