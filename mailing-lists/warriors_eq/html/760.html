<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213103729">I see your point but I disagree.  I think it should be TOTALLY random unless<br/>
a quest is attached to that item.  So the executioner axe is on a level 45<br/>
mob in a dungeon.  That means the executioner axe could appear on ANY level<br/>
45 mob in the game (within reason, necromancers wielding it in Najena<br/>
doesn&#39;t make sense).  Probably add the restriction that it also must be a<br/>
dungeon mob.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I dont like your idea is simply, people will camp at all 4<br/>
spots.  People WILL spend obscene amounts of time trying to get that item.<br/>
For a solid week easy I saw the same people over and over again waiting for<br/>
the Tomahawks. <br/>
<br/>
I think your solution just spreads camping.  There are people with lots of<br/>
time, people WILL spend days at a spot waiting for an item if they know that<br/>
SOMETIME the item WILL appear here then it WILL be camped.<br/>

&gt; You bring up a valid point.  But the reason for random spawn is to make<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; game more enjoyable to people as a whole.  Also, the spawn would have to<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; completely random in time.  I Just think the spawn should be on maybe 3 or<br/>
&gt; 4<br/>
&gt; different types of mobs, all around the same level, all spawning in 3 or 4<br/>
&gt; different zones, and all spawning at different random intervals.  This<br/>
&gt; increases the chances the items will be around, and makes it a little more<br/>
&gt; difficult to camp it.  Also, there should be more of a chance that the<br/>
&gt; item<br/>
&gt; is not actually on the mob since there will be more appearing more often.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For instance, you want a rubicite breastplate.  For those of us who know<br/>
&gt; what and where it comes from, its pretty easy to wait for the spawn to<br/>
&gt; appear.  Then get together poeple and whack it.  (dont get me wrong, its<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; an easy task to kill... just to wait for it.) On the other hand, if that<br/>
&gt; same creature spawned in 3 or 4 different zones, and only spawned at<br/>
&gt; random<br/>
&gt; intervals...  The campers would either have to spend obscene amounts of<br/>
&gt; time<br/>
&gt; sitting on one area hopping to get lucky.  Or they would just have to<br/>
&gt; travel<br/>
&gt; back and forth to the 3 or 4 different zones to get their kill.  This also<br/>
&gt; increases the chance that the spawn will appear when they just left the<br/>
&gt; zone<br/>
&gt; they were waiting in and give someone else a chance at it.<br/>
