<div id="ygrps-yiv-722846071">Hi warriors,<br/>
<br/>
I also sent this email to eq-warriors, so skip it if you already got this. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the class and wondering how to best increase the dual wield skill. My guess is that the fastest weapon would increase the skill faster, would it hit or not. Is that right or not? Maybe the test is made after each hit from the main weapon? In this case the delay of the second one wouldn&#39;t matter but I guess this could be abused so only the second wepon&#39;s delay should matter.<br/>
<br/>
As you guessed I&#39;m not yet level 13. I&#39;m also wondering if using a weapon I&#39;m not proficient with (like piercing which is fast) will matter or not, for dual wield skill increasing purposes (I think that anyway the mino axe is not the best choice to increase the skill, with a 37 delay).<br/>
<br/>
Another point, I rolled a troll and chose to put all my points in STR, STA and AGI and have base STR 120, STA 120, AGI 110. What do you think of my choice? Was that wise or will I need more strength being a large race?<br/>
<br/>
And, finally, I didn&#39;t purchase alcoohol yet, how do I use it? I guess I right-click on a beer to drink it? Is that it? Does it work on stackable drinks? (don&#39;t wanna drink 20 beers at once)<br/>
