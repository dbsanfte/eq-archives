<div id="ygrps-yiv-200089135">I never help unless I am asked to OR the person is most definitely losing OR<br/>
after the person has done more than 50% damage to the beast.  Then I go hell<br/>
for leather, and pull out so I dont get the last swing.<br/>
<br/>
I also like using my bow to help someone without inflicting the majority of<br/>
damage.<br/>

&gt; BB is a mad house sometimes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The situation you may want to watch out for is &quot;helping&quot; someone kill a<br/>
&gt; mob<br/>
&gt; when the person you are trying to &quot;help&quot; wants to do it solo for the xp.<br/>
&gt; If<br/>
&gt; you join a fight in progress, you may inflict more damage and get the kill<br/>
&gt; and thus the other guy does not get the xp from the fight.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I do is target the mob and then target the other guy.  Assess if he<br/>
&gt; needs help by looking at the difference in hp - this may be the 2nd or 3rd<br/>
&gt; mob he has been fighting and even though it&#39;s a scrawny, he maybe low on<br/>
&gt; hp<br/>
&gt; and would like some help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BB is where some people go for loot - others go there for the high MD.<br/>
&gt; There are usually lots of kills laying around free for anyone to loot.<br/>
&gt; And<br/>
&gt; even some dead guards and elites just laying there waiting for the looters<br/>
&gt; time to expire.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If someone gets so bad with insults, I just go: &quot;don&#39;t make me /ignore<br/>
&gt; you!&quot;<br/>

&gt; 		well if you saw the person that was hackin the mob die and<br/>
&gt; you took over its <br/>
&gt; 		your kill.<br/>
&gt; 		And as far as im concerned, bb is a special case.<br/>
&gt; 		The trains in there are worse then any other area I have<br/>
&gt; ever seen.<br/>
&gt; 		There are so many mobs there that if one gets killed or<br/>
&gt; stolen its often not <br/>
&gt; 		done with evil intentions but done to help someone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		Yes most damage always count.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		Depending on class I would come up with a nifty comment.<br/>
&gt; 		ingame insults always work<br/>
&gt; 		ooc insults though is something I realy dont like.<br/>
&gt; 		I would have just insulted him for being <br/>
&gt; 		short/skinny/tall/ugly/weak/archmage wannabee, just<br/>
&gt; anything.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		take care<br/>

&gt; 		&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;I&#39;ve been a roleplayer and a mudder for years now. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; come to EQ like<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;most of us, with a lot of experience in multiplayer gaming.<br/>
&gt; Now, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;fairly new to EQ (level 8) but I thought I had a good<br/>
&gt; understanding of<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;it, and it&#39;s unwritten rules, until now.<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;The other night I was in BlackBurrow in a small group of 3.<br/>
&gt; Two of us<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;were at the bottom level, and I was up top, returning from<br/>
&gt; a town run. I<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;saw a gnoll guardsman kill someone, so I ran up to take<br/>
&gt; charge of it.<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;There was nobody else around it. After a few hits it fled<br/>
&gt; to the lower<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;level with me chasing it every step, hacking and kicking.<br/>
&gt; Upon reaching<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;the lower level, there was a mini train already down there,<br/>
&gt; but both me,<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;and the members of my group, were working on the gnoll<br/>
&gt; guardsman I had<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;chased down. Towards the end of the fight, a fighter type<br/>
&gt; of some sort<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;walked up and took the final swing on the guardsman.<br/>
&gt; Thinking I had done<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;it ( I had to scroll back to look afterward) I bent over<br/>
&gt; and looted the<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;corpse.<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;The fighter started complaining at once that I was a kill<br/>
&gt; stealer and I<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;took his loot. I explained to him that I had chased the<br/>
&gt; monster down,<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;and had done the most damage, and therefore the computer<br/>
&gt; LET me take my<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;kill. He respnded that HE had chased the monster down from<br/>
&gt; the top (I<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;never even saw anyone up top but myself) and had made the<br/>
&gt; kill therefore<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;it wasn&#39;t mine to take. I didn&#39;t feel like the argument was<br/>
&gt; worth it so<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;I gave up and tried to trade him the loot. He would not<br/>
&gt; accept, but<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;instead complained to me via tells that he couldn&#39;t believe<br/>
&gt; I did that.<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;My questions are:<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;1.) Was I ethically wrong to take the loot?<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;2.) Does the game only allow the majority damage dealer to<br/>
&gt; take the<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;loot, or the final swinger?<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;3.) How would you guys deal with this situation?<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;Thanks for any advice ....<br/>
