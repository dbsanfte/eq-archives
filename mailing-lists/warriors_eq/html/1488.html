&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; *grin* You can disagree all you like, but that&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to change the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fair enough; I firmly believe you&#39;re incorrect.  See<br/>
&gt; below.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Monks and Warriors have similar, but not exactly the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same AC.  Warriors are always (with proper<br/>
&gt; equipment)<br/>
&gt; &gt; approximately 10-30 points higher on AC for each<br/>
&gt; &gt; given level.  This may seem insignificant, however,<br/>
&gt; &gt; EQ uses these sorts of tiny differentials as the<br/>
&gt; &gt; basis for damage calculations.  Given the way AC<br/>
&gt; &gt; advances (3-5 point increase purely on level alone)<br/>
&gt; &gt; there are easy ways for EQ to &#39;normalize&#39; the AC vs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Offense to determine relative damage levels for<br/>
&gt; &gt; enemies of similar level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, if AC is all that matters, why do a pair of<br/>
&gt; characters at equal level and Defensive skills have<br/>
&gt; such vast differences?  One a Ranger in full banded,<br/>
&gt; the other a Warrior/Paladin/ShadowKnight in full<br/>
&gt; plate; the Rangers consistently take more damage from<br/>
&gt; fights than their heavily armored fellow tanks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Still don&#39;t like that test?  Try this one: take *your*<br/>
&gt; WAR/PAL/SDK and get a full suit of plate to match the<br/>
&gt; full suit of banded you&#39;re so proud of.  Go fight a<br/>
&gt; few blue mobs in your banded armor and note the<br/>
&gt; strength of the blows that connect against you; how<br/>
&gt; much single shots tend to do, how many low damage<br/>
&gt; shots you receive, and how much total damage you take<br/>
&gt; over the fight.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now put on the plate and try another few fights<br/>
&gt; against similar mobs (level and race).  You should<br/>
&gt; notice fewer shots dealing maximum damage against you,<br/>
&gt; more shots doing low damage (2-10 where before it<br/>
&gt; would have been 40-60 on each connect), and less total<br/>
&gt; damage at the end of the fight.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You think you&#39;ve found some secret uber-combo (ala<br/>
&gt; Tekken or something, up-up-down-left-right left and<br/>
&gt; right punch together to produce the MegaFireball) or<br/>
&gt; something; this game has shown no instances of such<br/>
&gt; imbalances.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you truly think they managed to get all the way<br/>
&gt; through four phases of beta and the past 4-6 months of<br/>
&gt; final and never notice that plate, as you are<br/>
&gt; alledging, is useless?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thinking you&#39;ve found some hidden truth; that banded<br/>
&gt; is marginally (5% or less) effective than Plate but<br/>
&gt; has a fraction of the weight ... folly.  Sheer folly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Plate matters in a fight.  I&#39;ll take plate armored<br/>
&gt; tanks over those in banded seven days a week and the<br/>
&gt; rest of the month too.  I have watched the performance<br/>
&gt; of Rangers (since they *can&#39;t* have better than<br/>
&gt; banded) higher than my level for months now; they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; stuck in banded while I&#39;m in plate, and I take less<br/>
&gt; damage when tanking.  I&#39;ve watched warriors who aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; plate armored yet, and I take less damage than they<br/>
&gt; when tanking.  And I only have an 80 AGI, so it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But hey, whatever you want to do.  If you&#39;re in my<br/>
&gt; group though, I won&#39;t appreciate the higher percentage<br/>
&gt; of the healers&#39; mana you&#39;ll be taking to recover from<br/>
&gt; the greater damage you&#39;ll be taking.  I suspect they<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t either.<br/>
