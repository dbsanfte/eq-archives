<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095242568">&lt;&lt; I picked a warrior so I wouldn&#39;t have to think to much... I am just a poor <br/>
barbarian princess that lost her combine longsword (long story, don&#39;t ask!)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No offense, but I think that&#39;s the problem.  The developers seem to have felt <br/>
that everyone who plays a warrior is a beginner or someone who doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to be forced to ever make a decision or use player skill more than measuring <br/>
what to attack, when to attack and when and how to try to run and hide (all <br/>
of which requires patience and common sense more than anything else; two <br/>
qualities I don&#39;t necessarily associate with my idea of a fantastic medieval <br/>
warrior who wants to kill gnolls, minotaurs, mammoths and dragons but <br/>
nevermind that).<br/>
<br/>
I think we should be given far more to work with.  Really, how many hours (or <br/>
minutes) did it take everyone to master the EQ &quot;melee system&quot;?  Given <br/>
hundreds of hours to practice, I really don&#39;t think that there&#39;s too many <br/>
levels of complexity out there which all of us couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t be able <br/>
to readily master without having to think too much and assuming we weren&#39;t <br/>
hit with all of our choices at 1st level (which could be intimidating).  I <br/>
like playing a warrior in RPGs but not because it&#39;s the simplest or easiest <br/>
class, although it too-often is.  I can&#39;t stand EQ warriors primarily because <br/>
whether or not they can talk the talk, they can&#39;t walk the walk, but <br/>
additionally because there&#39;s no special player skill involved when playing <br/>
one; they have no flexibility in fights and few options other than sit there <br/>
and die or not (while swinging for 1/4th - 1/10th the damage of some other <br/>
classes).  That&#39;s just not my definition of &quot;warrior.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
BTW, RPing a simpleton or a crude, ignorant savage is another matter entirely <br/>
which should have nothing to do with game mechanics or the combat style <br/>
requirements of a high ranking swordsman.</div>
