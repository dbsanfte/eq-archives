<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079722995">This seems like a common thing latley... I too have been heckeld about<br/>
taking others loot when I did all the killing.. Sometimes people run and<br/>
zone and because they started the battle think they should get the<br/>
rewards...  But after you do all the work and kill it, do the most<br/>
damage yes you should get the rewards not the coward that fled and has<br/>
nothing better to do than complain about looseing a few silver.....<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a wimp with nothing better to do...<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve been a roleplayer and a mudder for years now. I&#39;ve come to EQ<br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt;most of us, with a lot of experience in multiplayer gaming. Now, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;fairly new to EQ (level 8) but I thought I had a good understanding<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt;it, and it&#39;s unwritten rules, until now.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The other night I was in BlackBurrow in a small group of 3. Two of us<br/>
&gt; &gt;were at the bottom level, and I was up top, returning from a town<br/>
&gt; run. I<br/>
&gt; &gt;saw a gnoll guardsman kill someone, so I ran up to take charge of it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;There was nobody else around it. After a few hits it fled to the<br/>
&gt; lower<br/>
&gt; &gt;level with me chasing it every step, hacking and kicking. Upon<br/>
&gt; reaching<br/>
&gt; &gt;the lower level, there was a mini train already down there, but both<br/>
&gt; me,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and the members of my group, were working on the gnoll guardsman I<br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; &gt;chased down. Towards the end of the fight, a fighter type of some<br/>
&gt; sort<br/>
&gt; &gt;walked up and took the final swing on the guardsman. Thinking I had<br/>
&gt; done<br/>
&gt; &gt;it ( I had to scroll back to look afterward) I bent over and looted<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;corpse.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The fighter started complaining at once that I was a kill stealer and<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt;took his loot. I explained to him that I had chased the monster down,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and had done the most damage, and therefore the computer LET me take<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt;kill. He respnded that HE had chased the monster down from the top (I<br/>
&gt; &gt;never even saw anyone up top but myself) and had made the kill<br/>
&gt; therefore<br/>
&gt; &gt;it wasn&#39;t mine to take. I didn&#39;t feel like the argument was worth it<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt;I gave up and tried to trade him the loot. He would not accept, but<br/>
&gt; &gt;instead complained to me via tells that he couldn&#39;t believe I did<br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My questions are:<br/>
&gt; &gt;1.) Was I ethically wrong to take the loot?<br/>
&gt; &gt;2.) Does the game only allow the majority damage dealer to take the<br/>
&gt; &gt;loot, or the final swinger?<br/>
&gt; &gt;3.) How would you guys deal with this situation?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks for any advice ....<br/>
