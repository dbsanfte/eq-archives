<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975652130">I switched servers to Rodcet Nife recently, and am having trouble finding<br/>
groups.  Before on Vallen it was no trouble finding people to group with,<br/>
but everyone seems distant on here.  I only switched to play with my Bro in<br/>
law, he is gonna help me when he makes his way to Halas.  But I need to get<br/>
up past 7 to get to him.  Any suggestions?  I played a lvl 14 shaman before,<br/>
and never had trouble getting into a group, but things seem so different on<br/>
here.  Only people lvl 3-4 wanna group, and they die to quick in BB.....<br/>
<br/>
Any help appreciated, thanks!</div>
