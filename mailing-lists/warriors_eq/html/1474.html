<b>Subject:</b> My weapon setup, should i change it? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083651114">At lvl 19 i dual wield a PGT and a Bladed thulian Claw (demon claw). I love dual wield but evryone keeps telling me I should buy a Blackened Iron bastard sword.  Sure i thinbk that weapon is great, but i like going fast.  Anyone have an opinion on what i should choose?<br/>
<br/>
Also, i ran into a player whom decided to make a warrior instead of use his lvl 27 paladin or something like that.  He tought me how dex and agl was the way to go for him instead of str.  So he put all his points into those instead of str.  I am thinking of only getting items that increse agl and dex, so i can be an excellent tank. sure the str might not be up, but you will be fast and very hard to hit.  This is just what he told me and I thought it was neat..<br/>
