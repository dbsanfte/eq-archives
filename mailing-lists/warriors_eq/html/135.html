geez i dont know what you would be fighting at level 12 that needs a magical<br/>
weapon to hit it, only stuff that cant be hit by a normal weapon in befallen<br/>
are elf skeletongs, ghouls, and iced bone skels, other than that you should<br/>
consider fighting there, creatures like mummies, greater skells, and necros<br/>
are abundant and easy to take out. Also in befallen you can stick on level<br/>
one and constantly kill skeleton lrodd who is about level 12 or 13. Other<br/>
than that you can try to make it to lava strom witha group and fight drakes<br/>
and basilisks....they are good exp and loot. if you want to adventure more<br/>
take the trip down the the innothule swamp area, lots of frogs down there as<br/>
well as lizardmen, both of these give so so loot.<br/>
<br/>
Or if you are in a strong group head to the Oasis of marr. start killing<br/>
Crocs, Caimans and if you are feeling lucky try a deepwater caiman. they<br/>
dont give good loot but are great Exp<br/>

&gt;    I am going back to North Ro now that I have finally reached the 12th<br/>
&gt; Rank <br/>
&gt; of Barbarian Warrior.  Hopefully soon I will have enougth plat to afford<br/>
&gt; my <br/>
&gt; dream weapon of a combine long sword (I have 10 plat now).<br/>
&gt;    Any good suggestions for hunting in and around Freeport?  Didn&#39;t like <br/>
&gt; befallen to much since I don&#39;t have a magic weapon yet.  Kind of a bummer <br/>
&gt; when you have to run from a skel that cons blue since I can&#39;t hit him.<br/>
&gt;    Haven&#39;t been down to see Troll Town yet.  Wonder if it is worth the<br/>
&gt; trip?<br/>
