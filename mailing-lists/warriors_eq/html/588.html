<b>Subject:</b> A good idea, Dark Elves especially please read. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-311373590">I saw a good idea posted on the eqvault board regarding Paladins who do the<br/>
knight of truth quest getting a sir added to there name.  I typed feedback<br/>
for this, since I think its a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
It then occurred to me, why cant Dark Elf warriors get a similar title.  Why<br/>
cant we get Dragoon added to our names when we hit level 45 (or whatever<br/>
level the Dragoons are).  Either get it automatically, IF we want it or<br/>
perform a quest to get it.<br/>
<br/>
I already wrote feedback on this, if anyone else thinks its a good idea,<br/>
could I ask you all to write some feed back :) ?<br/>
<br/>
thanks.</div>
