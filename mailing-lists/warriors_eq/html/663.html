I saw a unique way to do that in another game. They added a ring for high level<br/>
players only. When you got to a spot you liked you &quot;turned&quot; the ring. After that<br/>
you could go anywhere ... then again &quot;turn&quot; the ring and ....  poof, you were<br/>
back at your bound ring spot. It was SUCH a cool item.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I think the Verant guys want to keep people separated for some<br/>
reason in this game (zone server reasons maybe??)  There does need to be a way<br/>
to stay somewhere though ... maybe they could balance it with a high cost or<br/>
something.<br/>

&gt; Um, which part did you think was funny?  The ultimate weapon<br/>
&gt; or the boots?  :)  I really, seriously would like a magic item for<br/>
&gt; warriors to be able to gate back to their bound spot.  Or at least<br/>
&gt; give a spell to a wizard that allows you to gate them back (they<br/>
&gt; are still not able to bind you anywhere but a city).<br/>
