<div id="ygrps-yiv-362988545">I have just gotten a sheild called  the chitin shell sheild, it is very very<br/>
hard to get but it is the best sheild i have seen in the game thus far....it<br/>
has 15 AC as well as plus 10 to resist poison...plus it only wieghs 4<br/>
pounds...to get this sheild you have to travel to the dungeon of Guk located<br/>
in innothule swamp....once inside you have to kill a beast called a Giant<br/>
heart spider, this spider is about level 18-21 so be prepared...i was with 5<br/>
level 16 chars and we took it out...but seeing as how you are level 11 id be<br/>
very carefull....<br/>

&gt; Does anyone know if there is an item out there that will raise your<br/>
&gt; ability to resist poisen...   I am a loley lvl 11 Warrior and it seems<br/>
&gt; that I take the worst damage from creatures that can poisen like<br/>
&gt; Rattlesnakes and Asps...  any advice would be great...<br/>
