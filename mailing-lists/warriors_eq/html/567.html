<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068613204">Why would you want the price of the item to go down?  The economy in EQ is<br/>
being blown by people who &quot;farm&quot; equipment to sell for cheap prices just to<br/>
farther themselves a tiny amount.  IMO this sucks.  I remember when you<br/>
could sell a mino axe for 10pp.  Now I see them sold for 4pp and laf at how<br/>
rediculous this is.  I also realize this is due to the ease of gaining a<br/>
mino axe now.  But for things like a BBC, SBH, or Tomahawk, why drive the<br/>
price down and ruin the worth of the item.  Half the fun in the game is<br/>
going and getting something for yourself.  Buying items is definitely a part<br/>
of the game, and should remain an available option.  But when you get people<br/>
camping items just to sell them for profit, it becomes very anoying.  I have<br/>
tried to get a BBC for about a month before I gave up because of campers and<br/>
kill stealers.  Hard to express the anger you feel when you sit killing and<br/>
waiting for 3 plus hours only to have another group move in and steal the<br/>
kill to gain what you have been patiently waiting for.<br/>
<br/>
Im off the track here.  The point is, why drive the cost of something down?<br/>
You should want to keep the items worth something until the majority of<br/>
people in the game can get them for themselves.  Otherwise you will see lvl<br/>
3 and 4 characters running around with weapons that are level 15 or 20.  And<br/>
they only paid 4plat for it.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion I guess...<br/>

&gt; &gt; When someone has to camp an item for days to get it, why would<br/>
&gt; they sell it<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a 20p?  That would hardly be worth anything<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to get at.  I&#39;m sure someone knows of a<br/>
&gt; system out there to get the tomahawk, like how i said i got the chitin<br/>
&gt; shield, and also the BBC. It would only take a very short time to get the<br/>
&gt; item if we knew the system, *hopefully* forcing the price of these items<br/>
&gt; down.<br/>
