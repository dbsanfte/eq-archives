Its cus you japanese are so obsessed with total world domination heheeheh.<br/>
just jokin.<br/>
I play on solusek ro and I get home at around 5 CET,<br/>
+1 GMT and at that time its usually around 400 -450 people on.<br/>
sometimes more. The problem I have is that solusek is the server witht he <br/>
most european players i think.<br/>
Im gona have to check how many players are on early morning.<br/>
Maby i should take a day off from work heheh.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any news on any new servers opening?<br/>
Since I play about 6-7 h a day I feel i have a good chance of gettin big <br/>
pretty fast, and not worry about people camping spots....hehe<br/>
<br/>
vashi, ranting as usual<br/>

&gt;Hmm try this time 3 to 4am.  I live in Japan and when I get home from work<br/>
&gt;Monday night and I login to EQ its aprox 4am or 4:30am Monday morning in <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;USA (PST).  Number of people on my server is aprox 250 to 350.  The whole<br/>
&gt;place is dead.  I went to najena to kill some TT and me and my partner (who<br/>
&gt;lives in Denmark) were the only ones in there.  Two people! unbelievable.<br/>
&gt;About an hour later one other lower level person showed up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I bet that the Tomahawk will be camped very lightly (I wont go so far to <br/>
&gt;say<br/>
&gt;it WONT be camped at all).  The only people who may be camping it will most<br/>
&gt;likely be Japanese or MAYBE some Europeans (thou in Europe it will be <br/>
&gt;aprox.<br/>
&gt;early afternoon, like 1pm or so).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If there Japanese you wont have any sharing problems, but please EXPLAIN to<br/>
&gt;them you want to share the spawn.  For some reason (until you explain the<br/>
&gt;idea to them, and it helps if you speak Japanese) the concept of kill<br/>
&gt;stealing and alternating kills doesn&#39;t occur to them.  No idea why.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In my experience when its explained to them they never do it again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well hope that helps, maybe.  Good luck getting the Tomi.<br/>

&gt; &gt; This seems to be the most camped weapon that i&#39;ve ever seen.  No matter<br/>
&gt; &gt; what time i goto Highpass, there&#39;s always at least one group just <br/>
&gt;sitting<br/>
&gt; &gt; there waiting for endless hours for the gnoll to spawn.<br/>
