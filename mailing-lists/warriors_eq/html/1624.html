<b>Subject:</b> making hotkeys <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-191966342">You can make a hotkey out of just about anything.<br/>
<br/>
You can not make a hot key out of a weapon, but you can make a hot key out<br/>
of a backpack slot.  You must then, always keep your weapons in this<br/>
specific slot.  I had my first experiment with this using a bard character a<br/>
few days back.  hotkeyed a backpack slot and my Melee1 and Melee2 slots.<br/>
It&#39;s works pretty well.  Sometimes looting can cause a minor problem though.<br/>
Most of the time it&#39;s OK though.  These don&#39;t act like regular hot keys,<br/>
where you can just click 3 or 4 to make them work.  They act like inventory<br/>
slots.  You click on a weapon to pick it up, and then drop it in one of your<br/>
other &quot;Hot Slots&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.  If someone has an even better way that I overlooked I&#39;m<br/>
all ears.</div>
