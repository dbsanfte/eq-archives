<div id="ygrps-yiv-561243549">I don&#39;t want Warriors to get Critical Strike, at least not as it has been<br/>
presented on this list.  While we could use a combat boost, I&#39;d rather we go<br/>
another way.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want another skill that works all the time without any strategy as<br/>
to when to use it.  I&#39;d rather be able to have a skill that I can use when I<br/>
want to.  I want to be able to choose to use my skill to change the outcome<br/>
of a battle<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want another skill to replace kick/bash.  We will then just use the<br/>
most effecient skill all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m proposing again my Battle Cry.  For 20 seconds, you get Double Attack<br/>
Speed, +25 STR and +25 AC.  What would be even better is if EVERYONE in your<br/>
group gained the benefits of the Battle Cry.  Something this powerful would<br/>
be limited to once per day, just like Lay Hands.<br/>
<br/>
I also believe that the Warriors should have a general combat boost, maybe<br/>
6*lvl+5 for the combat skills.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;You missed my point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Have you ever seen to guys sword fighting and watch one guy kick at the<br/>
&gt;same time he is trying to stick him? :)    &quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The critical strike should be attached to an attack, and not in place of<br/>
&gt;one.  A sword swing could be a critical strike, or maybe a kick could be,<br/>

&gt;critical damage.<br/>

&gt;Second point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Having the abilities go up like parry and dodge would make it too powerful<br/>
&gt;I believe. They go up without the need to use them.  &quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only thing you are doing by making this an invoked skill is giving<br/>
&gt;warriors another key to tap repeatedly in combat.  You are forcing warriors<br/>
&gt;to choose between most likely doing 11 damage with a kick or maybe getting<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;critical hit.  I don&#39;t agree.  Warriors can and should use everything at<br/>
&gt;their disposal, slash and kick or bash, and at the same time be looking for<br/>
&gt;an opportunity to strike a critical hit.  A critical hit is not something<br/>
&gt;you just decided to do, you take an opportunity. Your suggestion indicates<br/>
&gt;that parry/dodge is a random part of combat.  I argue that it is indeed a<br/>
&gt;skill, one which I wish was successful more often.  It isn&#39;t random because<br/>
&gt;a warrior will endeavor to parry and dodge all attacks, and not just<br/>
&gt;randomly manage to avoid them.  I speak from real life experience on this<br/>
&gt;one not just about the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I see where you are going with the critical hit thing, but in the context<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;EQ the usefulness of the skill would be much hampered by your &quot;invoked&quot;<br/>
&gt;method.  The average gamers style of play is to pick an attack and keep<br/>
&gt;using it.  I for one, would simply max out my critical hit skill in party<br/>
&gt;fighting against yellow and red mobs.  Then I would use the skill at every<br/>
&gt;opportunity.  My dark elf warrior would likely max the skill in a single<br/>
&gt;level, and be very successful using it.  I fear that barbarians, ogres and<br/>
&gt;trolls would be at a disadvantage here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am solidly convinced that the parry/dodge method is the right way to go,<br/>
&gt;and let EQ check when to use the skill and check its success.  Then<br/>
