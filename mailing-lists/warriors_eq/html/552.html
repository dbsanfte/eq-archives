<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590642950">Well I have seen other monsters fighting monsters but only when<br/>
someone has charmed them (probably what happened with the <br/>
grizzly fighting the hill giant,  and the lions attack anything that<br/>
is bi-pedal :)  ).   This was beyond unpredictable.  Ghanex just <br/>
stands there and summons his pets.  I never seen a pet turn <br/>
on its owner before.<br/>

&gt; In regards to Ghanex&#39;s zombies attacking him....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You have to remember the AI that they have on these things. Who knows?<br/>
&gt; They<br/>
&gt; could have broken the spell that entraped them, or they could just have<br/>
&gt; gotten pissed off at him. I see monsters fighting monsters all the time. A<br/>
&gt; griz was fighting a hill giant the other day in W. Karana, and in the same<br/>
&gt; day I saw a lion take out one of the two farmers. All I&#39;m saying is, they<br/>
&gt; made the monsters AI very unpredictable, and that is the result.<br/>
