<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919888364">Hail to thee, I am of the 17th level and right now i duel Weild a Combine <br/>
Long Sword and a Fine Steel Long sword (both same stats).  Right now I do <br/>
about 24 each hand and since I am already maxed my level out in duel weild, <br/>
double attack and 1h slashing, I duel and double attack almost every hit. so <br/>
thast about 44-48 dmg per round.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always herd at high levels that you not only hit for 12 (sometimes 13) <br/>
but more... I&#39;ve never seen this happen to me, when will I start hitting for <br/>
more?  Whast going on with this area?<br/>
<br/>
double combine long swords are great, but I need some advise...<br/>
<br/>
I think when I hit lvl 20, I&#39;m going to upgrade my weaponry.<br/>
Do I go for some PGT&#39;s or shold I try and go for some Painbringers or should <br/>
I even go for soem gnoulbanes? (BTW I am going to duel weild and want 2x the <br/>
weapon)<br/>
<br/>
at lvl 20, what will be the idle and most level area weapon can I even get?? <br/>
             Thnx for your time.<br/>
