<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490584257">I&#39;ve been thinking about your Battle Cry idea.  It has merit, but in<br/>
practice it isn&#39;t really tactically or strategically useful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve played a little shadowknight and a little paladin and experimented with<br/>
these once a day abilities.  What I proposed earlier was similiar to the<br/>
shadowknight&#39;s ability and I was looking for feedback.  After thinking about<br/>
it I realize that this kind of ability would do nothing to enhance the<br/>
overall melee effectiveness of the warrior class.<br/>
<br/>
Lay Hands or Harm Touch are last ditch &quot;save my ass&quot; abilities.  They can<br/>
arguably be used strategically to take on a higher level mob that a party<br/>
might not otherwise be able to kill, but it is usually a last ditch attempt<br/>
to finish a battle alive.  Without having significant duration attached to<br/>
it the Battle Cry becomes another last ditch attempt to save the day, when<br/>
everything goes sour.<br/>
<br/>
Now this isn&#39;t a bad idea. However I think that what the majority of us are<br/>
looking for is a way to enhance the long term combat effectiveness of the<br/>
warrior and to increase the average damage a warrior does per round over<br/>
that of a hybrid.  The Battle Cry you propose does not accomplish that.  In<br/>
a standard melee against a chasm minotaur with my paladin friend, I want to<br/>
be the one who dealt more melee damage at the end of the fight.  I don&#39;t<br/>
care if the wizard zapped it for the most damage, I just want to be the one<br/>
to deal the single highest melee damage over all the rangers, paladins,<br/>
shadowknights, and so on.  Right now all I do is suck up damage during a<br/>
fight, and then suck up mana in heals after the fight.  The hybrids all have<br/>
some form of self healing, giving them an overall advantage so why should we<br/>
share melee ability with them? Shouldn&#39;t we be stronger?  But now I am<br/>
ranting....<br/>
<br/>
The skill enhancement I agree with.....why should warriors be capped in<br/>
weapons skills?  That is all we are about.  We should always continue to<br/>
grow.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m proposing again my Battle Cry.  For 20 seconds, you get Double Attack<br/>

&gt;I also believe that the Warriors should have a general combat boost, maybe<br/>
&gt;6*lvl+5 for the combat skills.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;You missed my point.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;Have you ever seen to guys sword fighting and watch one guy kick at the<br/>
&gt;&gt;same time he is trying to stick him? :)    &quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The critical strike should be attached to an attack, and not in place of<br/>
&gt;&gt;one.  A sword swing could be a critical strike, or maybe a kick could be,<br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;&gt;even a bash could be a critical strike.  Any attack can be used to deliver<br/>
&gt;&gt;critical damage.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Second point.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;Having the abilities go up like parry and dodge would make it too<br/>

&gt;&gt;The only thing you are doing by making this an invoked skill is giving<br/>

&gt;a<br/>

&gt;&gt;their disposal, slash and kick or bash, and at the same time be looking<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;an opportunity to strike a critical hit.  A critical hit is not something<br/>
&gt;&gt;you just decided to do, you take an opportunity. Your suggestion indicates<br/>
&gt;&gt;that parry/dodge is a random part of combat.  I argue that it is indeed a<br/>
&gt;&gt;skill, one which I wish was successful more often.  It isn&#39;t random<br/>
 </span></blockquote>because<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;a warrior will endeavor to parry and dodge all attacks, and not just<br/>
&gt;&gt;randomly manage to avoid them.  I speak from real life experience on this<br/>
&gt;&gt;one not just about the game.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I see where you are going with the critical hit thing, but in the context<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;&gt;EQ the usefulness of the skill would be much hampered by your &quot;invoked&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;method.  The average gamers style of play is to pick an attack and keep<br/>
&gt;&gt;using it.  I for one, would simply max out my critical hit skill in party<br/>
&gt;&gt;fighting against yellow and red mobs.  Then I would use the skill at every<br/>
&gt;&gt;opportunity.  My dark elf warrior would likely max the skill in a single<br/>
&gt;&gt;level, and be very successful using it.  I fear that barbarians, ogres and<br/>
&gt;&gt;trolls would be at a disadvantage here.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I am solidly convinced that the parry/dodge method is the right way to go,<br/>
&gt;&gt;and let EQ check when to use the skill and check its success.  Then<br/>
&gt;critical<br/>
&gt;&gt;hit won&#39;t just become a replacement for kick/bash but instead become the<br/>
&gt;&gt;real enhancement to our class we all think is needed.<br/>
