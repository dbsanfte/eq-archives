<b>Subject:</b> RE: Why I don&#39;t play a Warrior <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-787683159">That isn&#39;t the point John Zwanenburg.  The inital post made by Wayne started<br/>
out saying &quot;Warriors suck...&quot;  and continued to degrade the class from<br/>
there.  He happened to use a cleric to back up his points on why warriors<br/>
sucked.  I felt it was my duty to defend a class that I put hard work into<br/>
and, I might add, I play QUITE well.  Comparing warriors to clerics is like<br/>
comparing apples to oranges, there is no comparison.   Oh yeah and John, you<br/>
DID say that you can take as well as a warrior....here is your exact words. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My cleric can<br/>
&gt; take just as good as a warrior, my ac is damn high and my buffs add to<br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>You might have meant &#39;tank&#39; and fat fingered, but in the context that you<br/>
presented there it does seem like you were saying your cleric can take<br/>
(damage) as good as a warrior.  Even if you said tank I still would disagree<br/>
with you.  <br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t think anyone is reading this list because they moved to another<br/>
one.<br/>

&gt; Gee did we hit a nerve there or what? Last time i checked the amount of<br/>
&gt; people actually using this board was less than 5. And yeah i know its a<br/>
&gt; warriors discussion board but oh whats this? Even tho we are talking about<br/>
&gt; clerics AND warriors, we are discussing something!!! Isnt that the point?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh and Brian jones, i didnt say that I could take as much damage, i said i<br/>
&gt; could tank just as well. My cleric isnt skimping out on HP but he isnt a<br/>
&gt; troll warrior. I ususally tank for my group. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh and Jynxx, Ive taken damage from level 30ish mobs with both my warrior<br/>
&gt; and cleric and yeah i can last.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If your pissed, flame me back, i couldnt care less. If you dont want to<br/>
&gt; discuss this then fine. That doesnt bother me either, but this is a<br/>
&gt; discussion board and yes our topic right now does include warriors. Oh and<br/>
&gt; one last time for the record. My cleric is far better than my warrior ever<br/>
&gt; was.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (BTW: My warrior is level 43 and my cleric is level 34)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ok...clerics heal. Blah blah blah....who cares? This is a board for<br/>
&gt; &gt; WARRIORS, not clerics. I am sorry if I am offending anyone by saying<br/>
&gt; this,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but please keep your cleric opinions to yourselves. If I wanted to hear<br/>
&gt; &gt; about the virtues of playing a cleric vs. playing a warrior I would have<br/>
&gt; &gt; joined a cleric board. Last time I looked the list was called<br/>
&gt; &gt; &#39;Warriors_eq&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and had nothing to do with Clerics. If you have fun playing a cleric out<br/>
&gt; &gt; there, be down...have all the fun you want. Just don&#39;t tell me that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; do anything because I am a warrior because even with all your heals you<br/>
&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t be half as vital in a group as I am. Without a warrior to save<br/>
&gt; &gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; arse from getting hit by that 31st level mob you&#39;d be dead in 7 seconds<br/>
&gt; &gt; flat...well maybe 10 if you got a heal in there. Bottom line: Don&#39;t come<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; my board telling me I suck, cause it&#39;s gonna tick me (and a lot of other<br/>
&gt; &gt; GOOD warriors) off really bad.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Umm...  whoever says this about clerics is stupid as hell<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; At lvl 31 I group consistantly with a cleric.  This class is amazing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you think all they do is heal, you are very very wrong.  Their dd&#39;s do<br/>
&gt; &gt; stun<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (amazing for rogues) and they can heal better than any other class.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; want<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to see your two druids heal you to full from 1 bar of life<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also if all you fight is yellows and reds you need to rethink your<br/>
&gt; &gt; leveling<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; process.  Whites and blues are excellent to fight if you are in groups<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; handle large numbers well.  Before you say all clerics do is heal,<br/>
&gt; play<br/>
&gt; &gt; one,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or play with a good one.<br/>
