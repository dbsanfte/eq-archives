<div id="ygrps-yiv-947818633">Ok what I have personally experienced goes like this.  The experience is<br/>
boken up into lvls.  You take the exp gained by a mob and divide it by the<br/>
total lvls in the group (example: Mob exp: 1000; total lvls in group 40;<br/>
1000/40 = 25; so each lvl is worth 25 exp&#39;s; so a lvl 10 would get 250<br/>
exp&#39;s.) So the person with more lvls would get more exp because it takes<br/>
more exp to lvl.  This theory is in no way concrete.<br/>
<br/>
I read a posting by either Brad or John that as long as theres one other<br/>
person with you then you get a 10% exp bonus.  The bonus doesnt increase<br/>
with more members.  SO it would mean that it is more efficient just having a<br/>
partner then a whole group.<br/>

Nice story!  Thats what it is all about. Constant killing in the blue region<br/>
and little downtime.  Dont get me wrong, I find great satisfaction in<br/>
soloing a yellow or red, or even one in a group but the time it takes to do<br/>
this and the long rest after cant justify the extra bit of exp you would<br/>
recieve.<br/>
<br/>
I think the upper level warriors of this list will agree, after 15 or so, it<br/>
almost becomes compltely neccesary to group with atleast one other<br/>
non-warrior.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a question for my fellow warriors out there.  Has anyone actually<br/>
figured out how expierence is split in a group?  I&#39;ve heard tons of theories<br/>
but not found proof of any.  One theory is that each monster has a certain<br/>
amt of exp and it is split based on the levels and members of the group.<br/>
Another is that it doesnt really matter how many ppl you have in the group,<br/>
you get a % of the exp based on the exp the monster gives irregardless of<br/>
the players in your group. And we&#39;ve all heard that rumor that a 6th party<br/>
member gives bonus exp(I think brad discussed this not too long ago as a<br/>
myth)<br/>
So, my question is.. has anyone discovered anything concrete?<br/>

Im not high level but I have a pretty good story.<br/>
<br/>
One Friday night at about 3am est I was out wondering around the East<br/>
Commons looking for something to do.  There were only about 15 people in the<br/>
zone.  I came across an orc camp and decided to kill orcs. I was in need of<br/>
slashed belts and figured this would be cool with noone else here.  At lvl<br/>
14 I can take just about anything in the zone and I wanted to see if I could<br/>
clear the camp of 4 orc spawns.  3 of 4 spawns were blue to me but seeing<br/>
that I have close to 500 hp&#39;s I wasnt worried.  The battle was very close.<br/>
I had forgotten how many hp&#39;s the orcs had and when theres 4 on you your<br/>
hp&#39;s go down quick.  I killed the last one with about half a bub of health<br/>
left and sat down to an unexpected long  rest.<br/>
<br/>
A bard strolls into camp and askes if id like to join him so I could heal<br/>
quicker.  I said hell yeah!  From that point on we would take turns killing<br/>
the orcs (ungrouped) and then join again when I needed healing.  I was there<br/>
in case he got into trouble (he was lvl 11) and he was there to get rid of<br/>
my downtime.  We had it down to such a science that we were doing both camps<br/>
at the same time.  When ever he pulled to many he would run them around in a<br/>
big circle as I took em off him 1 by 1.  Also , he didnt want the belts so<br/>
he gave then to me.<br/>
<br/>
We finally called it quits at about 6am.  I had made lvl 15 plus a bub.  Had<br/>
about 25pp in cash, and 4 backpacks full of belts.<br/>
<br/>
It was one of the most enjoyable times I have had in 7 months.<br/>

Thanks for the reply. Im sorry to hear that the list is really slow, but Im<br/>
not surprised.  With so many people, like yourself, achieving the upper<br/>
levels information is abundant in-game.  I guess what Im most interested in<br/>
is hearing from people like yourself who might have a story, a suggestion, a<br/>
pitfall to avoid, a strategy, a nice area to hunt, etc etc.  As a 47th<br/>
Warrior I imagine you have seen just about all there is to see and do across<br/>
Norrath.  Id love to share your adventures, what suggestions you might have<br/>
for those higher level hunts and adventures.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the reply,<br/>
