<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372051857">Can anyone provide any information concerning this place.  I spent a few<br/>
hours there last night and had a very very good time.  I am concerned about<br/>
pitfalls/traps and things like that.  I have explored a good portion of the<br/>
upper floor around where the ice goblin is in the block of ice.  Beyond<br/>
that, I know nothing of it.  If you have any information (no spoilers)<br/>
concerning the existance of pitfalls/traps and such, please let me know.<br/>
Would hate to get a corpse stuck somewhere that I can not get to.<br/>
