 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have to read somewhere, go look.  All NPC<br/>
merchants have set stock they&#39;re selling (ore, spells,<br/>
armor, whatever); and then, at the bottom, they&#39;ll<br/>
have whatever people have sold to them.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
how long these other items stay in the inventory<br/>
before disappearing, or if they&#39;ll ever disappear<br/>
(until sold), but they&#39;re there.  You can test this<br/>
yourself; walk up to a merchant w/o something, sell it<br/>
to him/her, then talk to them again, and you&#39;ll see it<br/>
in their for-sale inventory.  This is why most<br/>
merchants in North Ro and Freeport have Cutthroat<br/>
rings for sale, etc...<br/>
