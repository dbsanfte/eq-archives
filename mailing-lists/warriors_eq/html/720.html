<div id="ygrps-yiv-175268167">Jiya.....I don&#39;t get the emails from this list as one big email, I get them<br/>
as they come, that way I can read them all individually and remember them.<br/>
BUT...i am having a problem with this. People who send about 30+ emails in<br/>
20 minutes....I check my mail about 2-3 times a day.....there is no need for<br/>
people to send a whole letter saying &quot;LOL me too!&quot; or &quot;Wow...&quot; and that&#39;s<br/>
it. I&#39;ll say on average I get about 200+ emails a day just from this list<br/>
alone. I don&#39;t want to un-subscribe from this list because it&#39;s EXTREMELY<br/>
helpful, and I love the discussions we get into. BUT....when I see the same<br/>
name come up on my screen 47 times in a row......I figured, why can&#39;t that<br/>
person just say what he had to say in one letter? Or even 10, I don&#39;t care!<br/>
But 47??!? It&#39;s extremely frustrating to check your email before you go to<br/>
work and you have 159 messages in your box, plus the 30 left over from last<br/>
night that you were too tired to read.<br/>
    Ok, all I am saying is this.....could we please trim it a little bit? I<br/>
am not flaming anyone, and everyone on this list has given excellent<br/>
feedback and contributed to this list. So I am not trying to bitch, I just<br/>
wish it were a little less =]<br/>
