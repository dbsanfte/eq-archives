<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120328254">I feel it&#39;s unfair that my group takes all the damage from an NPC and a higher level spell caster (not in the group) zaps it 3 times and gets the experience. That&#39;s a bunch of bull! It sucks even more when he does it 6 more times. I know this falls on the line of steal killing but I just thought it is a little unfair that spell casters can cause so much damage. I know it all evens out with warriors getting the hps and being able to take the hits and all. It just seems that you can be a spell caster and just wander around blasting others hard work and getting the (un)experience. <br/>
<br/>
This is just one warrior&#39;s thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone share my option or frustrations?<br/>
