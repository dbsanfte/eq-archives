<b>Subject:</b> Weapons - IMO a level 15 Warrior <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059462598">I have maxed out 1H Slashing and have 2H Slashing, Double Attack, and Dual <br/>
Wield all in the High 50s.<br/>
<br/>
I am using a combine longsword and a fine steel longsword for my dual wield, <br/>
and a fine steel 2H sword to build up my 2H skill.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried mino axes and such, but I just don&#39;t like the delay/damage ratio. <br/>
  2H Slashing is ok for the damage, and with double attack getting better I <br/>
get plenty of hits in during an attack - HOWEVER, nothing I have seen by any <br/>
warrior deals death as plentiful as my two long swords with dual wield and <br/>
double attack.  It is wonderful to change camera view just to watch as the <br/>
two swords fly.  Attack, Attack, Attack, Attack, Bash, Attack, Attack, <br/>
Attack, Attack, Attack, Attack, Bash!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, will have to see how good I am with my 2H Sword once I max out the <br/>
skill.  Like I said it works well now (24 to 25 a hit - with double attack <br/>
up to 50 per round), but I still think my two longswords rule.  Saving cash <br/>
now to buy a second combine longsword.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing; talking to a 21 level warrior last night, the BBC is to him <br/>
the best weapon he has seen.  Of course it is a 2H weapon, so 2H Slashing is <br/>
important to keep up.<br/>
<br/>
This is all my opinion as a level 15 Barbarian Warrior Princess.<br/>
