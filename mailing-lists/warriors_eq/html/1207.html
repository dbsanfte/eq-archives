<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429504243">Actually it all depends how you look at it. About the only class that really isn&#39;t balanced are the rogues. Spell Casters have a big hope in the fact that they can take stuff down quickly but I&#39;ve played a warrior and a Necromancer and I&#39;m telling you warriors can level the fastest of all classes. I do agree with the idea that Spell Casters should do more damage then a warrior it&#39;s the way every RPG has always been at least through the games I&#39;ve played. However I think warriors should be the king of melee which currently they are no better then a SK, Paladin, or a Ranger. Anyway I think a 5-10 damage increase in combat would make a huge diffrence if only for warriors.</div>
