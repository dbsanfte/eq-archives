<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710115153">Umm...  whoever says this about clerics is stupid as hell<br/>
<br/>
At lvl 31 I group consistantly with a cleric.  This class is amazing.  If<br/>
you think all they do is heal, you are very very wrong.  Their dd&#39;s do stun<br/>
(amazing for rogues) and they can heal better than any other class.  I want<br/>
to see your two druids heal you to full from 1 bar of life<br/>
<br/>
Also if all you fight is yellows and reds you need to rethink your leveling<br/>
process.  Whites and blues are excellent to fight if you are in groups that<br/>
handle large numbers well.  Before you say all clerics do is heal, play one,<br/>
or play with a good one.</div>
