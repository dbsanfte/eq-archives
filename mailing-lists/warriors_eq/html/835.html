<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362351281">I know this has been reported, but I want to confirm it. Last night I<br/>
trained and Dual Wield is available at 13th level instead of 15th level!<br/>
<br/>
Seeing as I just hit 12th level, I am excited about the change. (Although it<br/>
kinda takes away from the excitement of the Fine Steel Two-Handed Sword I<br/>
bought right before training.)<br/>
