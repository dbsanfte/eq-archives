&gt; I see your point but I disagree.  I think it should be TOTALLY<br/>
&gt; random unless<br/>
&gt; a quest is attached to that item.  So the executioner axe is on a level 45<br/>
&gt; mob in a dungeon.  That means the executioner axe could appear on<br/>
&gt; ANY level<br/>
&gt; 45 mob in the game (within reason, necromancers wielding it in Najena<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t make sense).  Probably add the restriction that it also must be a<br/>
&gt; dungeon mob.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only reason I dont like your idea is simply, people will camp at all 4<br/>
&gt; spots.  People WILL spend obscene amounts of time trying to get that item.<br/>
&gt; For a solid week easy I saw the same people over and over again<br/>
&gt; waiting for<br/>
&gt; the Tomahawks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think your solution just spreads camping.  There are people with lots of<br/>
&gt; time, people WILL spend days at a spot waiting for an item if<br/>
&gt; they know that<br/>
&gt; SOMETIME the item WILL appear here then it WILL be camped.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You bring up a valid point.  But the reason for random spawn is to make<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; game more enjoyable to people as a whole.  Also, the spawn would have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; completely random in time.  I Just think the spawn should be on<br/>
&gt; maybe 3 or<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4<br/>
&gt; &gt; different types of mobs, all around the same level, all<br/>
&gt; spawning in 3 or 4<br/>
&gt; &gt; different zones, and all spawning at different random intervals.  This<br/>
&gt; &gt; increases the chances the items will be around, and makes it a<br/>
&gt; little more<br/>
&gt; &gt; difficult to camp it.  Also, there should be more of a chance that the<br/>
&gt; &gt; item<br/>
&gt; &gt; is not actually on the mob since there will be more appearing<br/>
&gt; more often.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For instance, you want a rubicite breastplate.  For those of us who know<br/>
&gt; &gt; what and where it comes from, its pretty easy to wait for the spawn to<br/>
&gt; &gt; appear.  Then get together poeple and whack it.  (dont get me wrong, its<br/>
&gt; &gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; an easy task to kill... just to wait for it.) On the other hand, if that<br/>
&gt; &gt; same creature spawned in 3 or 4 different zones, and only spawned at<br/>
&gt; &gt; random<br/>
&gt; &gt; intervals...  The campers would either have to spend obscene amounts of<br/>
&gt; &gt; time<br/>
&gt; &gt; sitting on one area hopping to get lucky.  Or they would just have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; travel<br/>
&gt; &gt; back and forth to the 3 or 4 different zones to get their kill.<br/>
&gt;  This also<br/>
&gt; &gt; increases the chance that the spawn will appear when they just left the<br/>
&gt; &gt; zone<br/>
&gt; &gt; they were waiting in and give someone else a chance at it.<br/>
