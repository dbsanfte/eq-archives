him and i power level really good with my guild so im guessing by the end of<br/>
next week ill be level 24. Frostan is like level 19 right? Hrm we could play<br/>
together with those two if you want to Oh and about that armor , sorry man i<br/>

&gt; &gt; yeah i was really really sick the last week plus my pc was having<br/>
&gt; problems<br/>
&gt; &gt; but i got it all worked out now! So you finallygot yerself a Tommy eh?<br/>
&gt; Good<br/>
&gt; &gt; stuff, great weapon. So where abouts are you fighting now? You gonna be<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; IRC at all today?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve actually been waiting on getting the armor from you before i fought<br/>
&gt; anymore hehe. I&#39;m camped outside of Neriak with Frizzan, and started<br/>
&gt; character number 3. A dark elf wizzie named Veldrin. I gave him my old old<br/>
&gt; runed totem staff which i used with my druid before killing LJ to get the<br/>
&gt; Crooked Staff. That in combinaion with the Theourmatgist&#39;s Robe (dunno how<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s spelled) and i&#39;m going pretty good. Those of you who have tried<br/>
&gt; wizards know how much you die :)  I&#39;m level 6, almost 7, in 16 hours.<br/>
&gt; Going good. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; About IRC, nope.. There&#39;s too much to do in the office today for me to<br/>
&gt; even sneak on :(  I will be on eq from 6pm to 10 or 10:30pm eastern<br/>
&gt; tonight for sure tho.  Hopefully we can get together and roleplay some ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Talk to ya soon,<br/>
