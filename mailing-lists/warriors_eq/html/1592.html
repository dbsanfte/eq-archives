<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930057236">The best advice has been to keep all your skills up.  I regularly use multiple weapons dependant on the situation.  On multiple Mobs I use Painbringer and a Shield of the Slain Unicorn.  This combo causes AE dmg to all mobs to make sure that all focus on me, and the shield (due to my decent agility) adds 14 AC to reduce the amount of DMG I take.  The Monk and casters in our group deal out plenty of damage without the Mobs beating them to death.  If fighting multiple opponents who use damage shields, I use Fleshripper.  Again the AE of the weapon keeps the Mobs on me while I take significantly less dmg due to swinging fewer times while still dishing out excellent dmg.  Finally, if we are fighting a single Mob, I use the Executioner&#39;s Axe due to it&#39;s massive Dmg and the haste effect.  I have even been known to wield BullSmasher due to it&#39;s traditional Dwarven appeal (not to mention the tremendous dmg delay ratio). <br/>

P.S. I believe the Ykesha effect is DD rather than AE.  Once I get one, I plan to use the Ykesha and Painbringer for the significant non-melee dmg.<br/>

Well Dual Wielding is good from 13-20. After that 2h Weapons inflict MUCH more damage. Dual Wield really doesnt go off alot until lvl 38+, and by that time you should have an Executionars Axe (DAM 25 DELAY 50 procs for Haste). With the exe axe my average slash is around 65 and i have had up to 81 normal and 142 crits. However seems almost all the lvl 45+ warriors on my server  without fearplane blades are switching over to DW Short Swords of Ykesha (DAM 8 DELAY 24 procs for 79-point Ykesha AE spell). Ykesha swords are hard to come by though, as they are found on the Ghould Lord (lvl 53) in Lower Guk. <br/>
