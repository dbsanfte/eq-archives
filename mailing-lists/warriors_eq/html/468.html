OOC: Actually if it weren&#39;t so damned hard to play DE maybe it would be a nicer race. Seems to me that Barbs, Ogres, and Trolls got a tremendous warrior advantage in this game.<br/>

&gt; ya know why?  because humans, stat-wise, pretty much suck.  ie, and DE has base int of 99, human has 100 as max......DE warriors are almost as smart as human casters, haha, and I always remind them of this when I see them :)  (assuming its day time and they are not more than 5 steps away so they can see me).  And thats just an example of their pathetic inteligence, the rest of their stats are equally unimpressive.<br/>
