<div><font size="2">I&#39;ve been using icetooth&#39;s claws main hand and a SSoY off 
hand, since 41 or so, I&#39;m at 45 now and it seems to work fine. I have a Jarsanth 
Battle Sword I use occasionally, but I generally just like the faster 1hs&#39;s 
better. Yak procs still turn the giants around on me about half the time they go 
off, kiting with a druid friend. I&#39;m using a mithril BP, and a mix of stats 
related gear, pushing my dex and agi, and str very high, for a wood elf. Again, 
talking about GD frost giants, they hit successfully maybe 15% of the time, 
Shardwurms maybe 30%. Smarter critters like certain orcs in the EW Ry&#39;gorr fort 
hit considerably more often, and hard, so that&#39;s when you thank the healers.

  Lower Guk live side if I can&#39;t get a group.&nbsp;&nbsp; I really am trying to 
  get in on Lord or Frenzy (Ha! good luck). My exec axe is not as effective for 
  me as it was at 30.&nbsp; Soloing it doesn&#39;t swing often enough to do the 
  damage fast enough.&nbsp; I think I am underequipped in 1hs also using a 
  enamelled black mace and a obsidian scimitar.&nbsp; Perhaps its just because 
  it seems everyone I group with has better weapons then I do.</font></div>

    <div><br></div>Ok I have a couple of insights into this from a high level 
    warrior perspective:.<br><br>1) My warrior at 54 still tanks very well with 
    the 58/59 Pallies &amp; SKs I play with.&nbsp; The SK can still outagro me 
    but thats always been true.&nbsp; Its not even close how much better I can 
    take damage when I can actually draw agro.<br>2) They didn&#39;t eliminate the 
    the proc agro effect...they reduced it (right in patch message). This 
    impacted ALL classes &amp; not just warriors. To be honest in 5 hours of 
    Howling Stones last night Ididn&#39;t notice the difference (i.e. with my 
    Bloodpoint &amp; werewolf form I still saw plenty of agro).<br>3) Warriors 
    were only &quot;useless&quot; the first 6 months of the games existence...I know I 
    experienced it first hand (same armor, weapons &amp; hps as everyone else 
    with zero distinguishing skills) .&nbsp; These days with decent warr 
    specific armor &amp; weapons we tank very well at most levels.<br>4) The 
    idea that warriors don&#39;t contribute significant offensive damage is an old 
    idea.&nbsp; With the uber hps high level MOBs the damage we contribute over 
    time is quite significant.<br>5) Raising the defensive caps for the other 
    classes actually makes them stronger in the groups I play in.&nbsp; That 
    means my groups survive more. I kind of like that.<br>6) The mid 30s-40s is 
    a tough spot for warriors.&nbsp; Mostly because the other tank classes 
    (Rangers/SKs in particular) have similar agro capability to ourselves at 
    this point but little experience in the value of their role in a 
    group.&nbsp; By the mid 40s very few Rangers, SKs &amp; Pallies are actively 
    trying wrest agro away from a warrior...at least if they have any 
    brains.<br><br>regards<br><br>Flair Shieldrender<br>54 Champion Fennin

If the ranger is getting his ass kicked<br>because he is outdamaging us, then he is not doing his job and is putting<br>the whole group in danger because the cleric is spending their mana to keep !
him alive.  Remember, a 600mana rez is alot more mana efficient then 3 comps<br>and a bunch of smaller heals to keep that ranger kicking.  If the paladin or<br>sk is tanking, then they are not doing their job because they are not taking<br>the damage as well as a warrior.  It is all about how you play your class,<br>not what abilities you have or dont have.<br><br>Daks<br>Warlord of Rallos Zek<br>Stormrider of Quellious<br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>From: Tom Swift [<a rel="nofollow" class="ygrps-yiv-1024779957moz-txt-link-freetext" target="_blank" href="mailto:tswift@...">mailto:tswift@...</a>]<br>Sent: Thursday, February 22, 2001 8:21 AM<br>To: <a rel="nofollow" class="ygrps-yiv-1024779957moz-txt-link-abbreviated" target="_blank" href="mailto:warriors_eq@yahoogroups.com">warriors_eq@yahoogroups.com</a><br>Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Latest Patch<br><br><br>Not to mention rangers!!<br><br>SoW at 30<br>Offense and weapons skills upgraded to match warrior.<br><br>WTF?
