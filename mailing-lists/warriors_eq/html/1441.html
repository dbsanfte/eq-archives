fastest-to-kill to longest-to-kill.  This assumes the<br/>
multiple mobs (defined as those which are extra, that<br/>
you&#39;re not designating as your primary target) are not<br/>
of a threat level insufficient to cause any sort of<br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
The logic is simple; test it yourself.  If you target<br/>
the &#39;most dangerous&#39; (and usually the longest-to-kill)<br/>
mob first, you will have the 2nd, 3rd, etc... mobs<br/>
still around during the time you kill the<br/>
longest-to-kill, then the next-longest-to-kill, and so<br/>
forth.  During all of this time they&#39;re dealing damage<br/>
to you.  Kill in order of shortest-to-kill, to get rid<br/>
of the damage they&#39;ll deal to you, enabling you to<br/>
more quickly concentrate the battle.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, a lot of rules change if you have<br/>
sufficient spellcasting backup to flat out nuke-kill<br/>
(in an extremely short time) a few of the multiple<br/>
mobs.  Since I&#39;m a tank, and play from a tank<br/>
perspective, that&#39;s just an oddity situation; plan for<br/>
the tank and be pleasantly surprised if spellcasting<br/>
helps.  Much less likely to get into a jam that way.<br/>
