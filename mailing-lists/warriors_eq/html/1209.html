<div id="ygrps-yiv-487247625">Just want to point out, a 16th level cleric can cast Smite 6 times before he<br/>
is out of mana.  Now he has no mana for any heals.   So after 6 rounds of<br/>
100 damage (assuming no resists which is unlikely) the cleric only has his<br/>
piddly 17 max weapon damage while the Warrior can still hit for up to 60<br/>
every round.<br/>

&gt; I agree with you on all but your last scentence. Clerics are seriously<br/>
&gt; underestimated. Belive me when i tell you that my friend who is a level 37<br/>
&gt; cleric can solo a sand giant and i cannot with my level 37 warrior. Plain<br/>
&gt; and simple. And to say they dont have firepower well thats not true<br/>
 </span></blockquote>either.<br/>

&gt; Take MY cleric for example. Level 16, ac of 390, hp at 360, attack is 302.<br/>
&gt; Not bad...not bad at all. I can tank for some time without worrying about<br/>
&gt; dying at all. (Not to mention healing spells AND divine aura, an<br/>
&gt; invulnerability spell) Ok so now there i go tanking away doing around 17<br/>
&gt; damage with my FS morning star. Not bad. Then i start to cast without<br/>
&gt; getting interrupted which is not hard to do at all. I can cast my Smite in<br/>
&gt; between rounds. And it does 78 damage. Boom there you have it, each other<br/>
&gt; round i am doing 100 damage. where as a level 16 warrior would do about 60<br/>
&gt; at most. But thats not his role, all im saying is that i think clerics are<br/>
&gt; the best solo class in the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; just my 2 cents </span></blockquote></div>
