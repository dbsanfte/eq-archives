Another good technique is:<br/>
<br/>
/shout can anyone take an Elite off my back at the runnyeye zone border?<br/>

Personally I would take out the weakest first just because he can still hit<br/>
you hard. If he hits you consistantly then no matter if he is weak or not<br/>
you&#39;re still getting whupped. If he is green to you then take him out of the<br/>
situation altogether and then concentrate on the warlord.<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; i tried to solo the warlord goblin in Runnyeye, however i pulled 1 elite<br/>
&gt; with him as well...thanks to my jboots i got to the zone without damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i then proceeded to beat up on the warlord as he was my original target.<br/>
&gt; but of course i was getting whacked by both elite and warlord at same<br/>
&gt; time. Now either i was unluckly or i am way under equipped (lvl 30, pgt<br/>
&gt; + dirk, bronze armour) but i was whipped...i actually got the warlord to<br/>
&gt; run, and chased him a bit...but the elite was hitting me still, and i<br/>
&gt; just managed to zone without killing either with only 2 hps left.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; so my question is this...should i have killed the elite first, which is<br/>
&gt; a green crit? or was staying on the warlord the best thing?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i guess it might depend on my ultimate goal...and my goal then was to<br/>
&gt; just kill the damn warlord...as i had to goto work in 5 mins...if i had<br/>
&gt; more time, maybe i should have killed elite, zoned to rest and gone back<br/>
&gt; for warlord...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But im getting off my question here...if solo, should you take out the<br/>
&gt; hardest crit first or weakest?<br/>
