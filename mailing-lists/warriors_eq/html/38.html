<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983752858">I hunt from Qeynos and just went through 7 and 8 - my longest levels so far.<br/>
<br/>
There is an old Qeynos warrior saying: &quot;West Karanas for xp; Black Burrow<br/>
for loot.&quot; (Well, it&#39;s 2 weeks old anyways :-)<br/>
<br/>
At Lev 7 you should be ok in BB as long as you stay smart (do not go into<br/>
the tree on the top floor!)  You have to kill whatever you attack - if you<br/>
let one run away, he comes back with 3 or 4 of his pals!  If you run with 3<br/>
or 4 chasing you, you have formed a &quot;train&quot; and the top floor dudes don&#39;t<br/>
like it when someone drags a train up top and then zones.   Also, if you<br/>
attack the &quot;caboose&quot; of a train, you stand a good chance that the whole<br/>
train will turn on you.  And then there are kill and loot stealers and<br/>
whiners - the PC are almost as bad as the NPC at times but if you learn your<br/>
way around and pick the correct fights - the loot is good.  You should be<br/>
able to get some 2 h weps in BB after a short bit of work.<br/>
<br/>
Out on the Karanas, stay away from the bandits and scarecrows and anything<br/>
else that cons red to you.   You can build great xp on bears without any<br/>
hassle from Cros or Holly.  Then work the young cats and by late 8 you<br/>
should be able to solo on some of the big cats - con everything and read the<br/>
writing as well as looking at the color.  Use the ruined cat pelts to make<br/>
patchwork armor.  Sell the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and good hunting,<br/>
<br/>

		I cant really offer an opinion on the Weapon side beyond try<br/>
getting a<br/>
		couple of long swords or scimitars to dual weild.  Dual<br/>
wield REALLY drinks<br/>
		your stamina at first.  Mino axes do more damage but they<br/>
also weigh a lot<br/>
		more.<br/>
		As far as skills and training points go<br/>
		check this page.. they have a few player guides up and its<br/>
still being<br/>
		constructed<br/>
		www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Cove/1261<br/>
<br/>
		the warrior guide is up at least and it might help you on a<br/>
few points.<br/>
