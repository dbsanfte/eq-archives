	Monday, 19th of February, in the Year 3174<br/>
<br/>
	I heard a voice beckon me, whispering my name as I traveled through<br/>
the commonlands of the West.  It was a hollow voice of dissolution, tinged<br/>
with menace that penetrated my soul.  I closed my eyes and concentrated,<br/>
listening to the call.  Breaking into a run, I traversed the grassy knolls<br/>
of the land until the burning sands that covered the south replaced the<br/>
greenery.<br/>
<br/>
	The voice still called to me, leading me eastward along the deserts<br/>
edge.  A lake passed by on my left as well as a few small cottages, but I<br/>
did not stop.  I concentrated on the voice, with my eyes focused on the<br/>
rising dunes in front of me.  That fact alone prevented me from dying under<br/>
the boot of a marauding hill giant!  From whence he came I know not, nor was<br/>
I about to hail him and ask where he was bound!  I turned quickly to the<br/>
south and scampered up the sandy dunes as far as I could.  The luck of the<br/>
gods were with me that eve, for the giant ignored me and continued on his<br/>
westerly trek, no doubt looking for something to eat.<br/>
<br/>
	The sun was just setting, leaving the entire land in darkening<br/>
shadows.  When I crested the next dune, I saw a faint light emitting from a<br/>
cavern in the sand.  As I approached the lighted tunnel, the beckoning voice<br/>
echoing in my mind grew fainter until it was just a whisper.  Cadavers<br/>
littered the sand surrounding the entrance to the tunnel, grotesque<br/>
reminders of the ever-present dangers in this hot, foreign land.<br/>
<br/>
	I ducked into the tunnel and followed the winding passage until I<br/>
came to an open chamber.  The cloying scent of decay permeated the vast<br/>
chamber, hanging like a thick blanket of fog over the marshy bleakness of<br/>
the Innothule swamp.  I heard screams bellowing forth from the depths below,<br/>
followed by maniacal laughing and rotted moans of despair.  I offered a<br/>
silent pray to Rellos Zek, then hefted my two huge battle-axes against my<br/>
shoulder, and proceeded down the stairs.  <br/>
<br/>
	Other incorporeal chanting joined the voice that first beckoned me,<br/>
the cacophony trying to drive me mad at the same time luring me deeper into<br/>
the depths of the sepulcher. I tried some of the doors in the first chamber,<br/>
finding one door that was locked with no apparent entry.  There were other<br/>
people in the tomb, thank Rellos, so I asked one of them and was directed to<br/>
a small room where a Paladin of Evil tarried.  I entered the room and found<br/>
the culprit, a dark elf with a heart as black as its ebony skin!  After a<br/>
very short fight (his abilities was no match for a warrior of my stature!) I<br/>
was able to find a key on his decapitated corpse.  Sure enough, the key<br/>
unlocked the door and allowed me access to the nether regions of the tomb.<br/>
<br/>
	I came to a whole in the wall with a broken circular stairway<br/>
leading down to another chamber.  I descended the stairway, using the<br/>
guidance of Rellos Zek to block out the vexatious clamor that filled my head<br/>
and direct my feet to the right path.  As I entered the circular chamber, I<br/>
noticed bloodied spikes placed at strategic places around the edges,<br/>
obviously to catch the unwary adventurer falling from the pathway above.<br/>
The rotten stench here was stronger,  no longer cloying, but rather more<br/>
akin to the actual trolls that inhabit the wicked city of Grobb.  Another<br/>
tunnel continued to my right, so I turned and started traveling down the<br/>
passage.  As I walked by a closed door, I heard the sounds of battle coming<br/>
from within.  I pressed my ear to the wooden door, listening to the<br/>
conflict.  I slowly opened the door....<br/>
<br/>
	....and was immediately beset by an evil magic-user that could<br/>
control the undead!  My mind reeled in horror as I watched the casters pet<br/>
come after me with wicked talons.  I quicky initiated combat, throwing in<br/>
kicks wherever the opportunity revealed itself, trying to kill the<br/>
necromancer before he could do much harm.  In between my precise slashes and<br/>
hard kicks, he was able to cast a noxious cloud that pervaded my mouth and<br/>
nostrils, then slowly oozed down my throat to leave a nauseating feeling in<br/>
the pit of my stomach. I kept my bile from rising and continued to fight,<br/>
finally dispatching the evil caster.  His skeletal familiar continued to<br/>
rake at my armor with sharp talons, each stroke causing a loud, metallic<br/>
streak to echo off the walls of the mausoleum.  Just as my mighty axe fell<br/>
the skeleton, another one took its place, this one more powerful.  I had<br/>
read in the annals of the great library in Erudin about a skeleton made from<br/>
the remains of a large creature, known as a greater skeleton.  It took me<br/>
some time to finish off the incarnate of evil, but alas, with many wounds,<br/>
the skeleton collapsed into a harmless pile of bones.<br/>
<br/>
	I must rest.  I write this account of my experience while I sit in<br/>
this forlorn tomb. I still feel the ill effects of the dreaded poisonous<br/>
vapor the necromancer blew in my face.  It weakens my legs, my arms. I feel<br/>
my insides churn with the rotted touch of Bertoxxulous.  My strength is<br/>
ebbing as I collapse on a nearby rock, my breathing becoming shallower by<br/>
the minute.  Footsteps.  Many footsteps.  The pain is almost unbearable.  I<br/>
hear maniacal laughter behind me.  Footsteps closer now. My vision is<br/>
blurred.  A figure dressed in robes approaching.  He?  She? - carries a<br/>
staff.  Another dread necromancer coming to claim my soul?  A smaller figure<br/>
is next to the taller robed figure.  Also in robes.  A skeleton behind him.<br/>
They come for me.  Doomed am I to walk the halls of this crypt in an undead<br/>
state.  Another figure approaches.  Small like the first, but dressed....I<br/>
can not tell.  Too weak.  Too weak....<br/>
