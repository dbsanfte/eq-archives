<div id="ygrps-yiv-276576409">Actually it wasn&#39;t bragging I told you that it wasn&#39;t hard to get money for a BloodClaw after level 20 and I play on E&#39;ci so I&#39;m not even on your server. You asked me where my hunting ground was so I wasn&#39;t bragging. The reason for not telling you is because once people learn of this it will be pointless and too crowded to even attempt to hunt there. Bottom line is explore and you&#39;ll find good hunting grounds.</div>
