<b>Subject:</b> Re: level 20+ warriors? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-226558161">I play a 31st level warrior on Povar and here is what I have found...<br/>
using my BBC at level 20 I was doing max of 35 per hit.... At 30 I have been <br/>
hitting 45... Looks something like 1 extra damage per level... and my <br/>
strength is 104 (halflling)...<br/>
<br/>
I also know a 40th troll SK with a giant zweildhander... dam 18 delay 39... <br/>
and he hits for 65 at max.... not sure what his strength is though :(<br/>
