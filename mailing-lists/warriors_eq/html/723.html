<div id="ygrps-yiv-282463">Excellent point. However ... I&#39;ve played many many muds and other online games. It<br/>
will never happen. What I usually end up doing is this ... get the less sought<br/>
after item. I mean after all, what are we talking about here? Something that will<br/>
give a few more damage over an extremely long fight. So either,<br/>
A.) Sit and camp and be happy, or pay a high price that takes a month to save for<br/>
and be happy.<br/>
<br/>
OR<br/>
<br/>
B.) Do with something &#39;not as good&#39; but easily obtained. And be moderately happy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve taken plan B many, many times simply because it&#39;s easier and I enjoy the game<br/>
more. If, by chance I come upon a great situation in which I can obtain a valuable<br/>
item, I do it. Otherwise, just have fun.<br/>
<br/>
I remember a mud once where a particular item had a mob that required over 20<br/>
people coordinating an attack against it just to win. Imagine the nightmare of<br/>
trying to establish who gets looting on that. Screw that. I&#39;m out for fun ... not<br/>
frustration.<br/>
