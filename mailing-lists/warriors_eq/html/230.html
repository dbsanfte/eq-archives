<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-463141605">I hope you kind sirs will pardon the unspeakable ignorance of a young lad <br/>
such as myself. I have seven questions:<br/>
<br/>
1. How do you know when you are maxed at a skill?<br/>
<br/>
2. Where are Najena and Befallen?<br/>
<br/>
3. What should a level six Barbarian be doing with his limited amounts of <br/>
time?<br/>
<br/>
4. How is experience divided in a group?  Is it the same amout as solo, split <br/>
into shares, or is there more total experience given out?<br/>
<br/>
5. Are there any items I can get on Tunare to raise my intelligence?<br/>
<br/>
6. Are there any quests to become non-PvP?<br/>
<br/>
You have my deepest gratitude in advance for any information.<br/>
<br/>
