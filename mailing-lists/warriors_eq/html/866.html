don&#39;t have a problem with, the &gt;continued FARMING to get items for <br/>
guildmates, blah.  I&#39;ve never had a single magic item &gt;given to me, I&#39;ve been <br/>
there beside my guild buds working to get my items the whole &gt;game......ok I <br/>
shut up now<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and I bet you also had to walk to school barefoot in the snow uphill <br/>
both ways, right?  Look, regarding this whole &quot;twinking&quot; thing (a name I&#39;d <br/>
not heard before I read this list), I think the ones complaining are the ones <br/>
who don&#39;t really understand the spirit of the game.  They are the ones who <br/>
don&#39;t realize forming parties and guilds is encouraged, and that while <br/>
remaining solo might be fun sometimes, it just plain won&#39;t be as effective as <br/>
being part of a group.  So then we have these soloists running about whining <br/>
about &quot;farmers&quot;.  My response to that is thus: big fat hairy deal.  Norrath <br/>
is huge and up 24 hrs. a day.  Go find some uninhabited area and start your <br/>
own farm.  I have zero sympathy for someone whining about how he can&#39;t get a <br/>
tomahawk axe.  Go and kill-steal one.  If they were farming (and being rude <br/>
about it to boot), then they deserve to have a few kills stolen anyway.</div>
