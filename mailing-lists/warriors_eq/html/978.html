<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825520753">Interesting day you had Patty.   Sorry it ended in such agony.  I do<br/>
have a suggestion however....I try to make it a point to never log out<br/>
for the night without getting my corpse.  I have heard too many <br/>
horror stories of people that came back for their corpse and it wasn&#39;t<br/>
there anymore (the Xegony crash comes to mind, don&#39;t know how<br/>
corpses are handled when the server crashes but I really wouldn&#39;t<br/>
want to chance it).<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Got up this morning camped just outside of the entrance to Guk.  As I was <br/>
&gt; putting my stuff away I was think about the good times I has with my guild<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; mates hunting frogs in the dungeon.  I had never been to Guk and it was a <br/>
&gt; lot of fun.  Well mostly fun, that one train that wiped out the entire<br/>
&gt; party <br/>
&gt; was no fun, especially the walk back from the high pass.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So now I was along in the swamps and backing my stuff.  Darn backpacks<br/>
&gt; were <br/>
&gt; heavy and as I put them all one I realized I was encumbered now the<br/>
&gt; &quot;Spirit <br/>
&gt; of the Bear&quot; had left me (141/130).  Time to go sell.  Maybe there is a<br/>
&gt; spot <br/>
&gt; in South Ro I could sell, if not there I knew I could sell at the inn in <br/>
&gt; Oasis.  Oasis would be good.  There I could get some experience killing <br/>
&gt; crocodiles and caimans.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So adjusting my backpacks I started off running around the side of the<br/>
&gt; swamp <br/>
&gt; to the pass leading to South Ro.  An easy trot saw a couple of frogs and<br/>
&gt; an <br/>
&gt; alligator or two, but nothing that looked worth hunting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once I zoned to South Ro I decided to look around a bit to see what was <br/>
&gt; around.  Just a bunch of Orcs, had to kill a couple just because, but<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; get any experience.  It was also kind of fun to walk straight through the <br/>
&gt; Orc camps since they were too scared of me to do anything.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Well enough of this&quot; I thought and turned to go into the desert.  Time to<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; sell my loot and get to killing crocodiles.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As I was crossing the desert I came across a couple of Troll and a dark<br/>
&gt; elf <br/>
&gt; killing dervishes.  Stopped to check things out for a second and to see<br/>
&gt; what <br/>
&gt; the camp looked like.  As I was checking things out I saw a skeleton <br/>
&gt; standing out in front of the tents all by himself.  Well, figured I would <br/>
&gt; get closer and check him out, might be some good experience for me on the <br/>
&gt; way to Oasis.  Big mistake, wasn&#39;t just any skeleton but a dry bone<br/>
&gt; skeleton <br/>
&gt; that didn&#39;t like barbarians.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The trolls jumped in to help me, but even with my dual long swords flying <br/>
&gt; and the trolls beating on the skeleton, I soon found myself laying on my <br/>
&gt; back again wondering why I ever got so close to the skeleton.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well soon after that I found myself back in the high hold pass naked<br/>
&gt; except <br/>
&gt; for my kilt.  As I was standing up I got a message from Rallos Zek, the<br/>
&gt; once <br/>
&gt; I was hoping not to here - &quot;You have failed me once again young barbarian,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; no longer can you claim the 16th Rank of warrior, you have lost a level<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; are now 15 again.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Drat and darn, not only did I lose a level, had a long walk ahead of me,<br/>
&gt; but <br/>
&gt; all my spare stuff from the bank vault was on my body.  Oh well, back to<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; battle, now I really had to go back to Oasis as soon as possible to make <br/>
&gt; 16th Rank again.  Pissing off Rallos Zek is never a good idea.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I ran as fast as I can, past ghouls, giant spiders, sand giants and<br/>
&gt; orcs. <br/>
&gt;   Finally I was back in the desert of South Ro, hugging the wall, and <br/>
&gt; looking for my body.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Running south to the dervish tents, I suddenly heard the sound no one<br/>
&gt; wants <br/>
&gt; to hear.  Even the bravest warrior blanches in fear when she hears the <br/>
&gt; pounding footsteps of a giant behind her.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A sand giant hits you for 96 points<br/>
&gt; A sand giant hits you for 87 points<br/>
&gt; You are stunned...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well that hurt.  Once I found myself back in the Pass I decided that was <br/>
&gt; enough for the day.  Looking around I found myself a nice flat rock to<br/>
&gt; rest <br/>
&gt; on and lay down to camp.  Good thing I am a barbarian and the chill air<br/>
&gt; this <br/>
&gt; high didn&#39;t bother me.  Guess I will go get my body later tonight.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
