	&gt;I really hope they are evil and xenophobic like the lizards in CT.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I dont know about hating everyone, but im sure they are going to be another<br/>
evil race...if they hated everyone who would they team up with on the new<br/>
server that is coming out.. ( the race war server) i think verant has no<br/>
intention of putting up a bank in CT for them as well...People asked about<br/>
getting a bank in Crush for the Evil races but to no avail.<br/>

got aliens vs predator as well....man that game rocks....gotta love playing<br/>
