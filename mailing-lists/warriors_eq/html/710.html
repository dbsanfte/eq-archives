<div id="ygrps-yiv-397362749">Could you also fill me in on how weilding works?  How it&#39;s used, also as <br/>
shown below, I;ve noticed that you said something thats it better to have a <br/>
faster weapon in primary and also how come when i see people with duel <br/>
weilding I only seem em&#39; using there primary wepon, does it not show you use <br/>
both or is there something i have to do? I should be expecting lvl 15 around <br/>
this sun. so PELASE tell me everything I need to know and what wepon you <br/>

(I&#39;m going by memory here so these stats may be a little off)<br/>
<br/>
FS long sword 5 28<br/>
Combine long sword same as FS<br/>
Barbed Whip 7 28<br/>
<br/>
There is no sta skill, this is one of your character stats.<br/>
<br/>
If you think kicking is tough on your stamina, try it with 2 minos :)<br/>
<br/>
Parry will go up, if you only put 3 points into it, it will take it a little <br/>
while before it starts to go up.<br/>
<br/>
Banded is far better than blackend or ring.  Blackend is lower AC and much <br/>
heavier than ringmail.....but it does look cool :)  which is why I&#39;ve a got <br/>
a full set myself :)<br/>
<br/>
ps.  to me, the point of dual wielding it to get a large number of attacks.  <br/>
Wielding a weapon with the delay of a good 2h sword kinda defeats the <br/>
purpose.  Not to mention that your dual attack is based in part on the speed <br/>
of your primary weapon.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, the mino is a GREAT weapon for <br/>
1h slash, but when you hit 15th and get double attack and dual wield there <br/>
are much better weapons to be used, IMO<br/>

   When I get Duel Weild I&#39;m prob. going to go with the best Mino. Batlle <br/>
Axe<br/>
couse it does a wooping 8dmg/35delay and with my secondary wepon I&#39;ll prob.<br/>
use a Fine Steel Long Sword OR a barbed whip OR a combine long sword.<br/>
<br/>
P.S Could someone please tellme the specs. on the Fine Stell Long Sword,<br/>
Combine Long Sword and Barbed Whip?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   How do you cheack my skill in sta. and how do I get that skill up.<br/>
<br/>
P.S I also found that using kick often in a row draws your sta. down, but if<br/>
you use bash is dosn&#39;t seem to bring sta. down as much as kick.<br/>
<br/>
   I&#39;ve just got Perry skill and put 3 skill points into it.  Is this<br/>
automatic and I&#39;ve never seen it been used.  Is this skill even working and<br/>
is the skill going up?<br/>
<br/>
   I&#39;ve just gotten Blacken Armor and replaced it with my banded and <br/>
ringmail<br/>
armor!  Man, the weight is so much lighter and the AC is much more better!<br/>
I suggest any lvl 12+ people go to the RiverVale area hunt though goblines<br/>
and get that armor! + is looks so cool!<br/>
