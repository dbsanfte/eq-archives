<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279686160">9/22 yeah that&#39;s right but its not an Area effect proc.  I know there is a<br/>
no drop one that procs word of pain.  Been a while since I have cast that<br/>

&gt; Wow THE Kailyn?  The same fellow from the old eq.stratics board?  The<br/>
&gt; guy who discovered the STA/HP formula & the Agi/AC formulas? If so its<br/>
&gt; darn good to hear from you again.  I learned alot of what I needed to<br/>
&gt; know about warrioring from that board.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I indeed was part of the great warrior sitout (I think the first<br/>
&gt; sitout). I remember Fitty, Ruatha & all the other Stratics guys egging<br/>
&gt; all the warriors on to particpate (things really were hard on early<br/>
&gt; warriors).   I was laughing when over your story about bronze...I myself<br/>
&gt; did not get full bronze until lvl 24 (?) if I remember right.  Heck I<br/>
&gt; used dual Mino Axes until lvl 18 (then had to get a combine long sword<br/>
&gt; to kill undead in Unrest).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW another great warrior weapon to add to the &quot;uber&quot; list you mentioned<br/>
&gt; is the bloodpoint 10/21 procs an 80 pt hp txf & is not lore (drops in<br/>
&gt; Howling Stones).  I have 1 of these at the moment & with werwolf form<br/>
&gt; see 8-9 procs a fight.  My goal in life (other than get to lvl 56 &<br/>
&gt; riposte) is to obtain another.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good to hear from you bro<br/>
