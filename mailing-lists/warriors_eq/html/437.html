<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557571944">You filthy dark elf, stay out of me homeland!  Karg is a local hero <br/>
and you shouldn&#39;t be messing with him.  You may get Tundra Jack<br/>
and Iceberg in the deal if you know what I mean.  Watch your slimmy<br/>
back!<br/>

OOC -  His name is Karg Icebear and he roams the frozen plains <br/>
of Everfrost.  I see him every so often by Tundra Jacks Tower on the <br/>
Northside of the plains.  Last time I saw him he was just wearing a <br/>
kilt, so I don&#39;t know if he just was killed or what.<br/>

&gt; Heya, i just saw this latest addition to gameznet and it looked very<br/>
&gt; interesting.  With 18dmg, 39 delay, and glowing like a greater<br/>
&gt; lighstone, this two handed sword is calling to be my replacement for the<br/>
&gt; AGI stealing BBC. Thing is though, the website only said it would be<br/>
&gt; found on a roaming barbarian in everfrost. Does anyone know which<br/>
&gt; barbarian has it?  My drow warrior is already KOS there, so it&#39;s no big<br/>
&gt; deal if i kill a few barbarians :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To John - I didn&#39;t catch you on last eve.  Hopefully tonight after work<br/>
&gt; we can get together and share stories.  I was in Guk and Cazic but I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; go anywhere really :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
