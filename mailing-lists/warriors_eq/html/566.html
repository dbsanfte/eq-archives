<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1.  You also need to throw weight into that<br/>
&gt; equation.  Because even tho a mino axe has a better<br/>
&gt; ratio than a FS sword, but after about 3 mobs your<br/>
&gt; stamina is shot, which lowers your stats, including<br/>
&gt; your attack ability.  Try the same thing with 2 FS<br/>
&gt; long swords and you&#39;ll still have plenty of stamina.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a good point, one I&#39;ve not considered.  I haven&#39;t yet had any<br/>
problems with either of my characters yet in the Stamina department<br/>
(Dwarven Paladin and Troll Warrior); I only have Stamina problems when<br/>
I&#39;m fleeing across zones, jumping to stay ahead of them.  But it&#39;s an<br/>
excellent point; the Mino axe is *heavy*.<br/>
<br/>
Weight also impacts your possible lootage potential; lighter &#39;carry&#39;<br/>
gear/weapons = more loot to take back!  This has got to be a good<br/>
thing, neh?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2.  That would depend on what you are fighting, and<br/>
&gt; you must also calculate in the reposte skill.  When<br/>
&gt; you can reposte for 10 points with a 1h slash or 44<br/>
&gt; points with a 2h slash, bit of a difference there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know nothing about Riposte; neither of my characters have it, and no<br/>
one on any of the boards/lists/sites I read has said anything about it.<br/>
 Anyone have info re: Riposte?  I&#39;d love to hear it.<br/>
