&gt; Frosty is level 19, yup. Everytime i gain a bit of exp with him, I always<br/>
&gt; end up dying and losing it all. I&#39;m just under a bubb with him now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hrm we could play together with those two if you want to. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yeah, that sounds like a great plan. Too bad you get on *so* late at night<br/>
