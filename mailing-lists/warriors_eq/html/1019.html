<br/>
Yes and no. I&#39;ve had an interesting experience while being partied with a friend<br/>
who plays a rogue. Most of the group has problems with the tough mobs and will<br/>
die if it starts attacking the party .... except for the rogue.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an example. While doing the screaming mace quest we were camped in the<br/>
tower of Crushbone waiting for Emperor Crush to arrive. Assured that Ambassador<br/>
Dvinn was at the zone killing newbies, we continued to wait without any concern.<br/>
Suddenly Crush spawns ... no problem, we begin the whacking. Then, about 3 or 4<br/>
seconds later, Dvinn spawns. Wham Wham Wham, one down ... etc until 5 party<br/>
members were dead, none even made it past the throne.<br/>
<br/>
Except for the rogue who sat there plain as day, probably messing herself from<br/>
the fear. He never touched her, and in fact conned to her as indifferent I<br/>
believe. She was able to do corpse retrievals for some of us as we all waited at<br/>
the zone.<br/>
<br/>
Soooooo, I think as long as the mob is dubious or auto-attack toward everyone in<br/>
your group, then yes, he will kill the whole group. I guess it pays to take a<br/>
dark elf or rogue along with you at times.<br/>

&gt; As a side note.  If one of your group is engaged on combat by and<br/>
&gt; mob...named or not....then once your party member is dead the mob will come<br/>
&gt; after the next closest party member and so on till all are dead or zoned, or<br/>
&gt; you kill the mob.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When a giant attacks a party member...first thing I do is DISBAND! Same goes<br/>
&gt; for anything that can wipe out the whole party.  We disband and then regroup<br/>
&gt; when the danger is passed. Then the whole party doesn&#39;t have to run to zone<br/>
&gt; to regroup which can save considerable time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This can upset some people so it is best to make sure everyone understands<br/>
&gt; before it happens.  To many people die becuase giants can destroy a party<br/>
&gt; before anyone realizes the trouble.  90+  damage per hit makes short work of<br/>
&gt; most players especially after being stunned.<br/>
