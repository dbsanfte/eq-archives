<div id="ygrps-yiv-451529638"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I play a Cleric mainly now.  Every battle consists of many decisions that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>may affect the outcome.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes, I can just see all these vital decisions you make.  Should I cast the <br/>
weaker DD or the stronger DD?  Should I heal my party members when they get <br/>
injured?  Oh the choices...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Next I will normally assist one of the tanks for a few rounds.  It is my <br/>
 </span></blockquote>job<br/>
to monitor everyone&#39;s HP and heal them up when needed.  If I heal too much<br/>
too soon, I will draw all the critters onto me.  So I must carefully judge<br/>
when and how much to heal.  There is also a choice of who to heal.  Should I<br/>
heal Tank-A who is it half health but only has one critter on him, or should<br/>
I heal Tank-B who is at three-quarters health but has three critters on him?<br/>
Maybe I should wait a few rounds or do I need to heal right now?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
It is also the mark of a good warrior who can judge when to help out a party <br/>
member.  If I&#39;m in the middle of combat and I notice my friend losing health <br/>
at an egregeous rate, I will usually try to jump in an taunt it away.  This <br/>
is very similar to judging who needs healing and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As soon as I have used some mana, I have another choice.  Should I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>meditate<br/>
right away or should I continue swinging my staff?  Will I need mana for an<br/>
extra heal or should I do some immediate damage with combat?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
As a cleric your job is the cast healing spells.  That is what people expect <br/>
from you.  Nuff said.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Then I have to deal with runners.  Should I Root a runner so a tank can<br/>
 </span></blockquote>finish him off or do I need to finish him myself with Direct Damage?  Can I<br/>
afford the mana for this or should I chase the runner down myself to finish<br/>
him off with combat?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh please.  If you have a monster on the run he&#39;s no longer a threat to <br/>
anybody so long as he doesn&#39;t get away.  Let the warriors chase it down.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Also I must decide when to tank.  Clerics can wear good armor and have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>decent HPs.  I might need to tank a few rounds to save a Wizard or give a<br/>
Warrior a break.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
If a particular monster is wiping the floor with your warrior friend, tanking <br/>
for him may not be the best idea.  Besides, in this situation, why are you <br/>
not healing him, cleric?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Then I think about it from the Warriors point of view.  The Warrior did<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kick, Kick, Kick, Taunt, Kick, Kick, Kick, Taunt, the cleric is getting<br/>
attacked, switch targets, Kick, Kick, Kick, Taunt, Kick, Kick, Kick, Taunt,<br/>
runner rooted by cleric, chase runner down, switch targets, Kick, Kick,<br/>
Kick, Taunt.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
One could apply that to any class.  For example: all the cleric does is pull, <br/>
DD, DD, Heal, Heal, Heal, Heal, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Playing a Warrior doesn&#39;t compare to a Cleric.  As a Warrior, I feel so<br/>
 </span></blockquote>useless.  If the battle is going bad, there is nothing I can do but hope the<br/>
Random Number Generator starts falling our way.  All I can do is soak up<br/>
damage like a sponge, do more combat damage than everyone else and Taunt<br/>
critters off the spellcasters.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
If the battle is going bad as a cleric, what are you going to do about it?  A <br/>
bad battle sucks for everyone.  And quite frankly, what so wrong with doing <br/>
more combat damage?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A Warrior can learn everything there is to know about his class in one <br/>
 </span></blockquote>day.<br/>
Gaining new levels never changes the strategy a Warrior.  Sure they get dual<br/>
wield and double attack, but this only increased damage and does nothing to<br/>
add new combat choices.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Wholly incorrect.  I wonder exactly how high in level you played that warrior <br/>
to.  I&#39;m thinking not very high.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A Cleric takes a long time to master.  I feel there is much more for me <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
learn as a Cleric.  And every 5 levels I get a new set of spells that need<br/>
to learn to use.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be learning new tricks all the way up to<br/>
level 50 (if I ever get that far).&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
So in other words getting new spells are the only reason why you feel so <br/>
strategic in combat?  Do you honestly think warriors keep the same weapons <br/>
and armor from levels 1-50?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t misunderstand me.  Tanks are a very needed part of a party.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Spellcasters need Warriors up front to take the blows and deal out the<br/>
damage.  Warriors are just not my style.  The limited options during combat<br/>
are not what I am looking for.  For many of you, the Warrior is perfect.<br/>
Being able to stand toe to toe with a critter and doing damage with a sword<br/>
is exactly what many people want.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
As opposed to standing in the back of the party and cast heal spells til the <br/>
cows come home.  Wheee!  By the way, the options for a warrior are no more <br/>
limiting than for a cleric, you just put more thought and care into writing <br/>
your post to make it seem that way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Verant&#39;s improvements:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bezerker Frenzy - happens automatically when low on HP&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This is already in place, and actually I wish it was something they&#39;d take <br/>
away.  It does not help me as a warrior.  On the contrary, it hinders me.  My <br/>
AGI goes down, which makes it more difficult to hit AND to run away.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;More HPs - Lets us take more damage&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A pointless improvement, IMHO.  If I&#39;m solo I already have to spend a very <br/>
long time sitting and waiting for my health to come back.  Last thing I need <br/>
is to have to wait LONGER.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;More Magic Resistance - Better against spellcasters&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is useful, but otherwise dull.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Critical Hits - Randomly more damage&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again useful, but dull.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;These improvements do make Warriors a better class.  But nothing there <br/>
 </span></blockquote>makes<br/>
me want to play them.  I would consider playing a Warrior if there were more<br/>
active skills.  I need a skill that I can choose when to use it, so that it<br/>
may make a difference in combat.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
My idea was to make Kick and Slam/Bash non-mutually exclusive.  That would <br/>
help a lot, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Give Warriors something to think about in combat.  Make it so that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>experienced, skillful Warrior can be better than any newbie Warrior.  Give<br/>
them some abilities that would take skill to use effectively.  Knowing when<br/>
to switch Fighting Styles or use Battle Cry would be something an<br/>
experienced Warrior could learn to do well.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Again, had to played a warrior to higher levels to might not think this way.  <br/>
Then again, considering you have the tenacity to come to a warrior forum and <br/>
rip our favorite class apart, you might just be stubborn enough to badmouth <br/>
the warrior no matter how good you did.</div>
