<b>Subject:</b> Possible changes to the Warrior class I&#39;d like to see considered.. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533584107">1) Increase of max skill per level from (5xlvl)+5 to (6xlvl)+5<br/>
This would give a Warrior a 1 point advantage in weapon skills at level 1,<br/>
scaling<br/>
up to a 40 point advantage in weapons skills at level 40 when compared to<br/>
the<br/>
hybrid classes.  Not a lot, but enough to make a decent difference.<br/>
If the current skill caps remain the same (level 40) then a Warrior would<br/>
cap at 245, compared to a Hybrid at 205.<br/>
<br/>
2) If the above (1) is not acceptable, then increase the skill cap for a<br/>
Warriors<br/>
weapon skills to level 50.   This would do nothing for the Warrior at levels<br/>
lower<br/>
than 50, so I&#39;m not really to enthusiastic abot this idea, but hey, better<br/>
than nothing.<br/>
This would have hybrids capping at level 40 with a 205 skill, and Warriors<br/>
at level<br/>
50 with a 255.  But up to level 41 they would be equal as they are now.  I<br/>
realize<br/>
Minks are the masters at hand to hand... but not with 2 Handed Swords... in<br/>
the<br/>
above two items, I&#39;m only talking about the weapon skills, and not Hand to<br/>
Hand,<br/>
Offense, Defense, Parry, Dodge, etc...<br/>
<br/>
3) Start Warriors with &#39;Bind Wound&#39; at a default level of 50, that can not<br/>
be increased<br/>
untill attaining level 10.  Similar to the way the racial special abilities<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
4) If the above (3) is not acceptable, then raise the bind wound limit from<br/>
50% hits to<br/>
75% hits or more.  This would make the skill more usefull, and make the<br/>
bandages<br/>
worth the over 7sp they cost. Though this would not aid Warrior&#39;s themselves<br/>
in any<br/>
way as a class, it may make the skill usefull enough for more Warrior&#39;s to<br/>
adopt.<br/>
<br/>
5) Weapon Specialization.  Done like the magic users specialization skills.<br/>
You would<br/>
have one specialization skill for each class of weapon (1HS/2HS/1HB, etc..),<br/>
and it<br/>
would decrease the delay of the weapon, not by a lot, maybe 5-10 points at<br/>
most.<br/>
However, the first skill to get to 51 (see where this is looking like the<br/>
mage skill?) would<br/>
then become your &quot;Preferred Weapon&quot; and attacks with that weapon would cause<br/>
more<br/>
damage.  Again, nothing unbalancing, maybe 10-20 points at most.  Some may<br/>
think these<br/>
numbers are high, but remember that if this was introduced, it would<br/>
probably be a 30th +<br/>
level skill, and these numbers are the max on a scale.<br/>
<br/>
6) Thinking about something I heard earlier about Warriors having problems<br/>
catching fleeing<br/>
foes, while a mage can Root and finish it off... How about a game-wide<br/>
(*all* classes) skill<br/>
of Sprint? It would drain stamina pretty quickly, so it would not be a<br/>
prolonged thing.  You<br/>
could base speed on the Dex stat (which would be good for Monks and Rogues)<br/>
or have it<br/>
a set speed for all.  The better plan I think though would be like<br/>
swimming... the higher the<br/>
skill, the faster the sprint, up to a maximum velocity of approximately 3/4<br/>
that of a Spirit of<br/>
Wolf endowed character.  This would serve to purposes... to catch fleeing<br/>
opponents, and to<br/>
give yourself a little adrenalin induced start when forced to flee yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts... If anyone has any input, I&#39;d like to hear it...</div>
