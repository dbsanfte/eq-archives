<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378637009">If you play out of Qeynos, you can talk to Capt Tillian of the city guards<br/>
(on the top floor of Grounds of Fate) and he will tell you that he hate<br/>
gnolls and you should bring him gnoll fangs which you can get off gnolls in<br/>
BlackBurrow.  When you give him the fangs (one by one or one each of the<br/>
give slots ie: not stacked) he gives you xp and moonstones.  You can sell<br/>
the moonstones or take them to the bartender in the back room of Fish&#39;s Ale<br/>
and give to him in exchange for BB Stout (an illegal gnoll brew.)  Then sell<br/>
the BB Stouts for money - I usually drink one for the heck of it or<br/>
sometimes carry some back to BB incase I need to offer someone a reward for<br/>
helping me or whatever.  It&#39;s not that far out of your way when you make a<br/>
bank run to hit the bakery and fish&#39;s ale first.<br/>
<br/>
So, I do this as often as I can and one day the bar keep says&quot; &quot;oh oh<br/>
running low... can you take this note to the brewmaster and he will give you<br/>
some more BB Stout to bring back...&quot;  So, I take the note and srcibble down<br/>
the name of the brewmaster: Gnasher Furrgut.  Ok, turns out that another<br/>
quest has the head of Gnasher as a quest item and most monks are out there<br/>
trying to slay Gnasher.  Finally, I come up from BB after some hard fighting<br/>
and see Gnasher running past so I run after him and get close enough to hail<br/>
him and he stops and talks.  I give him the note and sure enough he gives me<br/>
some real big bottles of BB Stout.<br/>
<br/>
Cool I think now what? Hmm I guess I shall kill him and get his head too.<br/>
So I unsheath my trusty short sword and give him a few whacks which gets him<br/>
pretty mad.  I glance over to my hp and ruh roh!  Still below 50% from the<br/>
earlier fights and Gnasher does me in and I drop a level!  Dang!  I owe<br/>
Gnasher one now!!<br/>
<br/>
So are quests worth it?  This one gives you xp, cash and some depth of<br/>
character (ie makes the game a bit more interesting) beyond bashing gnolls<br/>
all day long.  So far it&#39;s the best one I have found and you can do it while<br/>
you are doing your normal power leveling thing.<br/>
<br/>

Snyak.<br/>
Warrior level 10 (no you can&#39;t count the number of time you make a level<br/>
other wise I&#39;d be level 40)<br/>

		5.  never messed much with quest, yet to see or hear of a<br/>
low level quest that is actually worth the time and effort.</div>
