<div id="ygrps-yiv-695561823">You will never be accepted by wood elves.<br/>
<br/>
They have a racial hatred much like the ethnic situation in Bosnia.  It has<br/>
nothing to do with who Pansa is or what he has done, they simply refuse to<br/>
accept that a dark elf, a Tier&#39;dal, any servant of Hatred can possibly be<br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
For reference, those of you who are familiar with Drizzit Do&#39;Urden.  He was<br/>
a level20+ fighter/level 20+ ranger.  He was at least level 20 before he<br/>
came to live aboveground, and likely another 15 levels before he was<br/>
accepted by even a small percent of the population in an isolated area.  He<br/>
accepted that in some areas he would never ever be accepted because of his<br/>
race and what it represents.<br/>
<br/>
I for one believe that Pansa should be able to achieve acceptance in a city<br/>
like Freeport where there is a &quot;melting pot&quot; of races and religions.<br/>
However, he should never be accepted into the city of the wood elves.  It<br/>
goes against the principles of the game for one, and on another note the<br/>
Feir&#39;dal and Tier&#39;dal are ancient enemies.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion.  In fact I play a rogue dark elf warrior.  I chose my deity<br/>
as Agnostic initially, though I roleplayed a follower of Innoruuk up to<br/>
about level 13 or so.  I then met a high elf by the name of Rahl who with<br/>
his group risked their lives to aid me in a nearly lost cause.  This had a<br/>
profound impact on the development of my character. Now Bael is unsure of<br/>
his path, and falls back and forth between his &quot;natural&quot; heritage and his<br/>
new uncertain &quot;path of light&quot; which he has embarked on.  I had somewhat<br/>
planned that the character would at some point come to this realization.  It<br/>
isn&#39;t in me to roleplay the superior and self-centered kind of race the dark<br/>
elf is.  I can&#39;t stand by and watch someone die when I know I could help.<br/>
The end result is an excellent roleplay which is alot of fun.  In general to<br/>
many of the dark races just become the shining pinnacle of goodness of their<br/>
races.  I do love trolls though....a better group of roleplayers you will be<br/>
hard pressed to find. Ok I am babbling again...shutting up now.<br/>
