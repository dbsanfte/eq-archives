<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040854920">I gotta disagree.  Remember, the problem with camping is the &#39;farmers&#39;.  If<br/>
you rnot sure that Tommy&#39;s gonna show up anytime soon, chances are you ar<br/>
egoing to get bored and move on.  By randomizing the loot, you actually<br/>
remove the desire to just sit and wait.  Of course, if you want to sit for 4<br/>
days waiting for that one time the Tommy shows up, be my guest, but I would<br/>
call that a bit obsessive-compulsive .<br/>
<br/>
What randomizing loot will do is make it unproductive to try and go and get<br/>
such and such item.  The game becomes less of a pursuit of gaining items,<br/>
and more of a pursuit of gaining adventures.<br/>

You do of course realize that there would be no way to hunt for the<br/>
particular item you are looking for, right?  ie, a 35th lvl item, one that a<br/>
35th lvl monster drops, ie rubicite bracers.  So lets concider where all you<br/>
would have to go to look for this item<br/>
<br/>
Karanas- could be any of the griffins or giants<br/>
oasis-could be one of the spectres or giants<br/>
s ro-could be on one of the giants<br/>
e commons-could be on a griffin<br/>
w commons-could be on a giant or griffin<br/>
cazic thule-could be on any number of monsters there<br/>
mistmoore-could be on any number of monsters there<br/>
soulsekB-could be on any number of monsters there<br/>
befallen-it could conceivably spawn on commander windstream<br/>
<br/>
so would it make since to go to all these places to look for a particular<br/>
item, or would you just find a pretty safe place to camp and wait to see<br/>
what item spawned on one of the creatures that you are camping?  I would<br/>
think your odds of finding &quot;random&quot; items like this would be equal if you<br/>
camped one spot, or if you traveled to various zones.  Doesn&#39;t seem like<br/>
this would promote adventuring.  And it would take FOREVER to actually get<br/>
an item you want.<br/>

YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
That&#39;s what we need! A random item spawn.....I&#39;ll even take it one step<br/>
further:<br/>
Lets say that said sword is on a level 45 person...so we&#39;ll call that a<br/>
&#39;level 45 item&#39; it can then spawn to any level 45+ NPC in all of the zone,<br/>
or even norrath. That would make people have to travel A LOT to find items<br/>
they want, and would completely prevent camping for items altogether. That<br/>
way if you really wanted an item bad enough, your group had to go search for<br/>
it...not just sit sround and wait for it....that to me is not even<br/>
role-playing.<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>
