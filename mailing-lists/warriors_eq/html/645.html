<div id="ygrps-yiv-257040808">What is the SBH?<br/>
<br/>
and by &quot;not being in the room&quot; (ref. the TSK with the BBC) what exactly do<br/>
you mean?  Not in the SK room? not anywhere in that WHOLE room (as in dont<br/>
go through the secret door?)<br/>
<br/>
And what if someone falls down the well, does that screw up the spawn?<br/>
<br/>
thanks, my friends camped that place for 3 days just trying to get a BBC and<br/>
a Gos robe with no luck.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Why would you want the price of the item to go down?  The economy in EQ<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; being blown by people who &quot;farm&quot; equipment to sell for cheap prices just<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; farther themselves a tiny amount.  IMO this sucks.  I remember when you<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just because I know there are many people like me who cannot afford them.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m at level 19 and i have very little spare cash.  I do not die very<br/>
&gt; often and do not understand how people can flaunt 200pp for items when<br/>
&gt; i&#39;ve never even seen that much money before. My guess is that the people<br/>
&gt; who have all this money either have no lives, playing all day long, dying<br/>
&gt; a lot, and camping item spots to pay for other item spots. All this<br/>
&gt; inflation is bullshit and once we start, as a group, helping one another<br/>
&gt; out, it will all phase down.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; mino axe now.  But for things like a BBC, SBH, or Tomahawk, why drive<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; price down and ruin the worth of the item.  Half the fun in the game is<br/>
&gt; &gt; going and getting something for yourself.  Buying items is definitely a<br/>
&gt; part<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SBH spawns about every 2 or 2 and a half hours on the Shralok there, and<br/>
&gt; as long as you have a high level wizard or two in your group, you can<br/>
&gt; outgun the people. Is that worth 125pp or whatever it&#39;s going for? I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sorry, but i can&#39;t make 125pp in 2 and a half hours. Nor can i make 125pp<br/>
&gt; in a week. I&#39;ve never made that much money, so i don&#39;t know how long it<br/>
&gt; would take.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; tried to get a BBC for about a month before I gave up because of campers<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill stealers.  Hard to express the anger you feel when you sit killing<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; waiting for 3 plus hours only to have another group move in and steal<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill to gain what you have been patiently waiting for.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Shadowknight that spawns with the BBC spawns every 30 minutes and<br/>
&gt; everyone has to be in the main room to avoid the anticamp. If there is a<br/>
&gt; group there doing it wrong, explain it to them, and if you do it right,<br/>
&gt; they will be gone in half an hour with a BBC in their possesion and you<br/>
&gt; can wait your half an hour to get one too. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Im off the track here.  The point is, why drive the cost of something<br/>
&gt; down?<br/>
&gt; &gt; You should want to keep the items worth something until the majority of<br/>
&gt; &gt; people in the game can get them for themselves.  Otherwise you will see<br/>
&gt; lvl<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3 and 4 characters running around with weapons that are level 15 or 20.<br/>
&gt; And<br/>
&gt; &gt; they only paid 4plat for it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And this is exactly my point. I, at level 19, can get a majority of the<br/>
&gt; good weapons in the game with a good party if given the chance. Everyone<br/>
&gt; would get a chance if we figured out the system for these items. The price<br/>
&gt; should not be for the people who spend 24 hours a day, 7 days a week<br/>
&gt; playing. It should be something that the people who only have a couple<br/>
&gt; hours a day to play can attain too. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My opinion.<br/>
