<div id="ygrps-yiv-816548449">Thats pretty interesting.. thats kind of the theory that I had as well.  I<br/>
dont imagine Verant would care to explain how exp actually works.  I can<br/>
tell ya this much.  I will always take a large group over a small one.  Id<br/>
much rather have minimal exp gain then maximum exp gain followed by a death<br/>
with exp loss and time.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Thanks for the info<br/>
