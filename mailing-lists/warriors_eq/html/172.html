<div id="ygrps-yiv-801516297">Okies here&#39;s tha deal. I am AGM of a guild called COG (Council Of Grey) and<br/>
many of you who have played NwN will remember us. I want to start a faction<br/>
of COG in EQ, so if anyone is interested, just reply to this email. We<br/>
currently have a COG faction in 4 online games, and another possible once it<br/>
opens. We are a neutral guild believing in balance of everything. Therefore<br/>
all races are accepted, and all classes. We have our own web-based message<br/>
board, as well as an email mailing list. Let me know,<br/>
