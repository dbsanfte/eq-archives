<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729075906">Hmm, at low levels your starting stuff always comes back - even if you<br/>
destroyed it before you died.� Easy way to get free food when starting a new<br/>
char - die the run out and loot your corpse if you had any stuff.� So maybe<br/>
there is some kind of bug with summoned items and very low levels.� I know i<br/>
have died with a dimensional pocket and logged off.� When I came back the<br/>
next day and looted my corpse - I still had my dimensional pocket and the<br/>
stuff that was in it.� So, its not really logging off but camping that<br/>
clears summoned items.<br/>

I did not log out with it though, I was killed, and upon resurrection it was<br/>
gone.� My starting sword that I had destroyed was back in my inventory.�<br/>
Does this sound right to you?� Thanks<br/>

The rune sword is actually a very good one handed slashing weapon.� To bad<br/>
its also a summoned item.� Most high level magicians can create them.�<br/>
Damage 7 delay 26 i believe.��I have been able to keep one in the bank for<br/>
quit some time.� As soon as you log out with it in your inventory tho, it is<br/>
gone forever.� At least until you get a mage to make you another one.�<br/>
Anyway, the morale of the story great weapon, but summoned, so find yourself<br/>
a mage to adventure with.� This weapon and a barbed leather whip with cause<br/>
some very good damage together.<br/>

I would greatly appreciate any info.� I am not happy with my current<br/>
weapons, and the weapons that I want are far out of my reach.<br/>

Tom, I am ashamed to say that the sword was a gift from a dear friend, and I<br/>
just equipped it and walked out to battle when I was killed.� I was in such<br/>
a state of shock to find it gone, that I forgot the stats and went a little<br/>
&quot;nuts&quot;.� I will find out for you, and get back on this.� But I still want to<br/>
know, &quot;WHAT HAPPENED TO MY SWORD&quot;?� LOL<br/>
