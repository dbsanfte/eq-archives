&gt; Jiya guys. Just some questions. I heard that there are two centaurs in the<br/>
&gt; Centaur Village in South Karana at 200, -2400 that offer Blue Plate or<br/>
&gt; &quot;Crafted&quot;, and that it is Warrior Only armor. Does anyone know what items<br/>
&gt; you need to give and what the stats are? Also any magic on it? Any info<br/>
&gt; appreciated!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Indeed, the Centaur brothers offer *8* intriguing mini-quests to provide<br/>
outstanding warrior-only armor.  Someone tipped me off to their<br/>
existance as someone has to you, and I whole-heartedly encourage each of<br/>
you to go down to SK, take the time to have a lengthy conversation (and<br/>
get all the details on the quests) for yourselves.  Each of the armors<br/>
has two main components needed to be made.  A somewhat rare, somewhat<br/>
random, no-drop item found on a mostly random level 35+ mob in a certain<br/>
area, and a rare gem (or gems).  <br/>
<br/>
There are no magical enchantments on the armors I&#39;ve acquired<br/>
(breastplate and helm).  The gems for the items range from Ruby<br/>
(vendor-available, cost 130PP and up depending on charisma), to<br/>
Sapphire, the game&#39;s rarest gem.  The clues left by the Brothers are<br/>
very clear and easy-to-follow in all but one case.  Doing the quests...<br/>
not easy. :)<br/>
