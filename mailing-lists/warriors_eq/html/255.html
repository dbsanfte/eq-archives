&gt; &gt; 3. What should a level six Barbarian be doing with his limited amounts of<br/>
&gt; &gt; time?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Scrawny gnolls at entrance of BB three gen spots pretty easy picking.. will get<br/>
you to 8 easy.. painfully but easy.. there is a guard that wanders at the base<br/>
of the entrance.<br/>
<br/>
When you get in a group go inside BB and stay on the top level. If you go at<br/>
night watch out for that first step oyi... there is a big hole in the middle<br/>
and water and this buggar in the water too (ouch!) fell in it the first time I<br/>
went there.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t mind the dungeon atmosphere BB is great exp... I prefer the plains<br/>
so can&#39;t tell you much more...<br/>
<br/>
On the plains hunt some  larges spiders, and in a group some polar bears (some<br/>
you will be able to handle on your own) Just stay close to Brandl ( i think<br/>
thats how you spell his name) when you hunt alone.. pull them in and you will<br/>
be able to run if you get in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Later on the plains you can get in a group 8/9 ish.. start going for orcs<br/>
troopers... lepoards.. giant spiders.. just watch out for ice bone skeletons  (<br/>
you will need a magical weapon so just run ),  shamans and mounts.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m level 14 and have been doing mammoth calfs alone and in groups ..<br/>
started them n groups when was 11. and can handle sharmans and mounts with one<br/>
other person (love the bash skill for disrupting spells - it seems to work<br/>
better than kicking got it to 70 currently). I must say having a sharman to<br/>
give you SOW and heal you is wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
