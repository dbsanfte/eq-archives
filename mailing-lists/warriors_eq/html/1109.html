<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941172564">I have been to Mistmoore.  In fact, I have been all through the castle.  But<br/>
I was invis and invis to undead.  Some of the horrors that can be found in<br/>
there is pretty amazing.  I  ant wait till I have a group that can handle<br/>
that exploring that place.  The first and only time time I was there, I was<br/>
level21 or 22... cant remember.  We stayed outside, right next to the zone.<br/>
but even then, it got very ugly very fast.  Suffice to say i was full health<br/>
(somewhere around 710hp) and died in less than 5 seconds flat.  Even with a<br/>
full group at my back, they didnt have time to cast a single heal i got hit<br/>
so hard and fast.  I cant remember what hit me, a deathly usher or herald i<br/>
think.  something like that.  regardless, the time we spent there before<br/>
that was very very good for xp and loot.  you just have to be very careful,<br/>
know when to zone, and always use your different camera angles to watch for<br/>
other incomming mobs.  I actually plan to head back there very soon now that<br/>
I am much higher level and able to handle a little more than 2 casts from<br/>
one of those nasties.  The shield you mentioned comes from there as well,<br/>
called the Mistmoore Shield I believe.  Bugged shield as well, when you zone<br/>
to certain zones, or store it in the bank, it just disappears.  it is a<br/>
known bug, and apparently they are working on it.  just no resolve as of<br/>
yet.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that gives you the info your looking for.<br/>

&gt; I havent traveled to mistmoore myself but I have seen a cool shield that<br/>
&gt; comes from there. And there is other stuff in there just not exactly sure<br/>
&gt; of what... make sure you are at least lvl 20 and have a party for it is<br/>
&gt; not that easy<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was just wondering if any of you had any cool info on<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore. Ive never<br/>
&gt; &gt; been there and was thinking about venturing over there. i hear<br/>
&gt; there are a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lot of good mid to high range MOBS there. Is this place usualy<br/>
&gt; packed? Any<br/>
&gt; &gt; good magical items to be found in here? Any info would be much<br/>
&gt; appreciated<br/>
&gt; &gt; before i make the long walk over there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>
