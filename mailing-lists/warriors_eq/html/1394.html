<div id="ygrps-yiv-512669378">Now the treants in S karana you can make that much cash, maybe in a good<br/>
group you can do it at 20, but they range up to 26 or 27. That&#39;s the best<br/>
hunting spot I&#39;ve found in the mid 20&#39;s (pretty good up to 30 also). And<br/>
even there I might make 100 pp in 6-8 hours. You take negative faction hits<br/>
against Qeynos guards (guess they&#39;re all tree-huggers) so be warned.<br/>

200pp but that&#39;s my best day and that&#39;s a full 8 hours of game time. It<br/>
really isn&#39;t hard to gain money past!<br/>
