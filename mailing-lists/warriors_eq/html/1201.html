<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087059120">I must say i that is an ok formula.. but in unrest i will tell you this we<br/>
had a constant stream of items comming with this formula.<br/>
<br/>
2 tanks (1 ranger 1 warrior)<br/>
3 clerics <br/>
1 paladin<br/>
<br/>
screw the nukers when you are fighting undead clerics and paladins own<br/>
them.<br/>

&gt; Yes, 3 tanks is nice.  But when you get into higher level mobs, you HAVE to<br/>
&gt; have nukers of comparable levels.  Otherwise even getting healed and<br/>
&gt; whacking away like mad on the mobs will still not bring you close enough to<br/>
&gt; winning the battle.  Normally this is because other mobs join the fray, and<br/>
&gt; you have to take the mob out fast, and move on to the next.  You can take it<br/>
&gt; down semi quick with 3 tanks, but then the creature runs, and you have to<br/>
&gt; chase it.  If you dont he grabs 3 friends and now your hosed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2 tank (warrior/hybrid - at least one warrior.)<br/>
&gt; 2 healer (cleric/shaman/druid at least one cleric.)<br/>
&gt; 2 nuker (any 2 nukers will do... but nice to have a necro/wiz combination.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Only way to have it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have had the opportunity to operate in this type of group.  We have been<br/>
&gt; able to take down things that would have detroyed groups 2 levels higher<br/>
&gt; than we were.  Why?  Because of teamwork and knowing the roles that each<br/>
&gt; play in the group.  Never had a better feeling than taking out a zealot, 3<br/>
&gt; fans, a couple heralds and a few defenders/warders all at once.  Then<br/>
&gt; immediately following that up with a stone golemn.  Was a great night, we<br/>
&gt; worked well together.  Just my 2 copper.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The warrior excels in a full party with a cleric.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Try it and you will see. 3 and 4 person parties<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; aren&#39;t the same, because you will often be the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; primary target of high level mobs and take alot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; damage.  But a full party with 2 warriors and 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cleric plus other assorted baggage is a group that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; can take much higher level mobs without losing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; members.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Right on the money; here&#39;s a very graphic example of<br/>
&gt; &gt; this.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In Unrest, grouped (16s-19s) with three tanks, two<br/>
&gt; &gt; clerics and a wizard, we cleaned up *anything* we<br/>
&gt; &gt; could pull from the first two floors of the house (up<br/>
&gt; &gt; to and including Carrion Ghouls and Skeleton Monks,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the occasional Barbed Bone Skeleton - all red to<br/>
&gt; &gt; all of us).  Grouped (16s-19s) with only 1 tank (me),<br/>
&gt; &gt; two clerics, two wizards and one shaman, we could<br/>
&gt; &gt; *not* take Skeleton Monks or Barbed Bone Skeletons<br/>
&gt; &gt; because the Wizards were dead weight then (resists),<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Clerics didn&#39;t have enough healing to keep me up,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I didn&#39;t have the firepower alone to take them<br/>
&gt; &gt; down before everyone was OOM and it was still at half<br/>
&gt; &gt; life, laughing at us.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Those who think they can hunt without tanks are right,<br/>
&gt; &gt; if they&#39;re willing to *only* hunt blues and whites.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If they want to hunt &#39;up level&#39; from themselves, in<br/>
&gt; &gt; yellows and reds, they have to have tanks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My prefered party always has three tanks, period.  My<br/>
&gt; &gt; most fun ripping and shredding party would be four<br/>
&gt; &gt; tanks and two clerics (but my friend&#39;s a wizard, and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t just throw him away like that).  But with three<br/>
&gt; &gt; tanks and a pair of clerics, you can use the 6th slot<br/>
&gt; &gt; as a wildcard to fill with a bard or wizard or<br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever.  Enchanters go especially well, their<br/>
&gt; &gt; debuffs make fights a lot easier.<br/>
