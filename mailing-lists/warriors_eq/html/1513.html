<b>Subject:</b> Re: Armor & Absorption is all AC. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952482063">&lt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have direct confirmation from Verant that armor type is the Damage<br/>
Absorption constant.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Point:  Anyone can state this.  Now give us facts.  What everyone has said<br/>
 for this thread is only conjecture.  And the one thing I have found constant<br/>
 in EQ is that conjecture = assume (and you know the saying about assume).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you can&#39;t accept what a poster is calling a fact based on your assessment <br/>
of the poster than you&#39;re wasting everyone&#39;s time by filling a post asking <br/>
him for more.  Also note that the &quot;because Verant said so&quot; point wasn&#39;t his <br/>
only argument.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the invisible, theoretical damage modifiers go, I&#39;m curious as to <br/>
why so few people are defending their existance so vehemently.  I&#39;m also <br/>
curious as to what &quot;facts&quot; could possibly be brought to bear to prove or <br/>
disprove its existance other than the conjecture of very <br/>
experienced/methodical/intelligent players and the gospel of Verant.</div>
