<div id="ygrps-yiv-656396353">Your int is probably 99 like mine, I maxed double attack before 16 but was 2<br/>
points of maxing duel wield.  Maxed them both within about 20 minutes of<br/>
level 16.<br/>

Did you say you would kill yourself? WHY?<br/>

&gt; Subject: 	[warriors_eq] Question about skill advancement.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; I am Bael, a warrior of the 15th Order and a dark elf.� At the start of<br/>
&gt; this level I put 20 points each into dual wield and double attack. I am a<br/>
&gt; little over a bubble away from� 16 and my skills are now 65 for dual wield<br/>
&gt; and 72 for double attack.� My rate of advancement has slowed considerably,<br/>
&gt; I am wondering if I should expect to max these at 80 before I hit 16 or if<br/>
&gt; that is uncommon.<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; If I can max them I will likely get myself killed right before i level up<br/>
&gt; in order to buy some more time at 15.<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; By the way I am using a combine scimitar and tentacle whip against magical<br/>
&gt; opponents and dual mino axes against non-magical opponents.� My max damage<br/>
&gt; per round is 79, that is double attacks on both weapons with max<br/>
&gt; damage(17) and a max damage kick (11).� <br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; And in reference to others questions about faction.� It is easy enough to<br/>
&gt; gain enough faction for the Commonlands vendors to deal with you, just<br/>
&gt; kill orcs by the dozens.� I kill every orc I see, pawns, centurions and so<br/>
&gt; on.� You can get Freeport residents to deal with you by completing the orc<br/>
&gt; slashed belt quest repeatedly.� If you do that tho you faction with the<br/>
&gt; Paladins in North Freeport will get worse.� It is up to you whether West<br/>
&gt; and east freeport are more important to you then North Freeport<br/>
