<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040274851"><html><head></head>Ok I have a couple of insights into this from a high level warrior perspective:.<br>
<br>
1) My warrior at 54 still tanks very well with the 58/59 Pallies &amp; SKs
I play with.&nbsp; The SK can still outagro me but thats always been true.&nbsp; Its
not even close how much better I can take damage when I can actually draw
agro.<br>
2) They didn&#39;t eliminate the the proc agro effect...they reduced it (right
in patch message). This impacted ALL classes &amp; not just warriors. To
be honest in 5 hours of Howling Stones last night Ididn&#39;t notice the difference
(i.e. with my Bloodpoint &amp; werewolf form I still saw plenty of agro).<br>
3) Warriors were only &quot;useless&quot; the first 6 months of the games existence...I
know I experienced it first hand (same armor, weapons &amp; hps as everyone
else with zero distinguishing skills) .&nbsp; These days with decent warr specific
armor &amp; weapons we tank very well at most levels.<br>
4) The idea that warriors don&#39;t contribute significant offensive damage is
an old idea.&nbsp; With the uber hps high level MOBs the damage we contribute
over time is quite significant.<br>
5) Raising the defensive caps for the other classes actually makes them stronger
in the groups I play in.&nbsp; That means my groups survive more. I kind of like
that.<br>
6) The mid 30s-40s is a tough spot for warriors.&nbsp; Mostly because the other
tank classes (Rangers/SKs in particular) have similar agro capability to
ourselves at this point but little experience in the value of their role
in a group.&nbsp; By the mid 40s very few Rangers, SKs &amp; Pallies are actively
trying wrest agro away from a warrior...at least if they have any brains.<br>

him alive.  Remember, a 600mana rez is alot more mana efficient then 3 comps<br>and a bunch of smaller heals to keep that ranger kicking.
