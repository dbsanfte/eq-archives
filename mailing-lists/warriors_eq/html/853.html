&gt; I would have to agree that the  ultimate &#39;weapon&#39; for warriors <br/>
&gt; is the Executioner Axe - that we know of!  I can not believe <br/>
&gt; that all of the unique items in the game have been found <br/>
&gt; already.  There are new items popping up on EQ&#39;Lizer every<br/>
&gt; day that I have never heard of.  And with the game being <br/>
&gt; dynamic, you could find the &#39;ultimate sword&#39; on a high level<br/>
&gt; mob that used to carry something else.  Personally I would <br/>
&gt; like to see a pair of boots that have the power to gate you <br/>
&gt; back to your bound spot by tapping your heels together<br/>
&gt; and shouting &quot;Theres no place like home&quot;  3 times :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Bah!  All those people who talk about uniqueness have not played high<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough<br/>
&gt; &gt; levels to compare.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; A warrior IS unique, but it does not kick in until much later.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have not played until level 50, but I did here Brad quote that a human<br/>
&gt; &gt; warrior (or was it barbarian warrior, not sure) gets something like 3000hp<br/>
&gt; &gt; at level 50.  3000!!!  That will be a HELL of a lot more than ANY other<br/>
&gt; &gt; class.  Its not just a couple hundred hp, its a lot more.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Basically what makes us unique is we can take punishment like no other<br/>
&gt; &gt; class.  We can also dish out continuous damage.  but we are NOT the mob<br/>
&gt; &gt; killers, wizards are.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My ONLY whine is the &quot;warriors are the only class that can wear all armour<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the game&quot;.  This is just dishonest.  Certain kinds of magic plate can<br/>
&gt; &gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; worn by ALL other classes.  This I REALLY wish they would change.  I think<br/>
&gt; &gt; the only classes that should be able to wear plate are Warriors, Paladins<br/>
&gt; &gt; and SK&#39;s.  I also think the BEST plate in the game should be ONLY wearable<br/>
&gt; &gt; by Warriors.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Its not like we have a lot of weapon choices, we have 1 ultimate weapon<br/>
&gt; &gt; which is unattainable until atleast level 40 or so, its also an axe.  So<br/>
&gt; &gt; atleast give us some warrior only armour.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; O.K. ill shutup now.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Tom<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yup & the gap seems to get worse the higher in levels you go.  Not only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Rangers, but Paladins & especially Monks seem to greatly diminish the<br/>
&gt; &gt; role<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the warrior at levels 25+.  Eventually the other classes have similar<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (within a couple of 100 hps) stats and much more diversity in terms of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; healing & hth damage capability.  Mind you that my opinion is based on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; talking with high level players (who have tried to convince me to dump<br/>
&gt; &gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; warrior) & from reading on the eqstratics site.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; There is an interesting thread on the eqstratics board (warriors)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; regarding the perceived lack of differentiation (or all out weakness) of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our class at higher levels.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What does the rest of the list think?  Anyone have direct experience<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; playing these classes at level 30+ & can compare HTH damage &<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; effectiveness against critters?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This past week I decided to take a break from my level 15 dark elf<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; warrior.  I was abit frustrated.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I started a half-elf warrior in Kelethin.  It is insanely easy to play<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there.  I made level 5 in about 3.5 hours.  Then I stopped and tried a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wood elf ranger.  Has anyone else played a ranger?  I imagine it is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; most poorly balanced of all the hybrids.  After 4 hours I reached level<br/>
&gt; &gt; 5<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and got kick.  I am now 12-18 hours into the character and almost level<br/>
&gt; &gt; 9.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am just as capable as an equivalent warrior.  Next level I gain an<br/>
&gt; &gt; array<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of spells which will boost my combat effectiveness and allow me to heal.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Part of the easy success is the plethora of low level orcs available a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stone&#39;s throw from Kelethin.  With my tracking ability I am never at a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; loss for targets and I can engage blue con orcs in rapid succession or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; even 2 at a time. I can even engage and successfully beat yellow con<br/>
&gt; &gt; orcs<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; more than 50% of the time and almost always can kill orcs that con even<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; me without trouble. So far it seems that I get as many hit points now as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my warrior did.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My point is, with a ranger class as powerful a combatant as it is I<br/>
&gt; &gt; see<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; little necessity for the pure warrior.  I am going to play through to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; level 15 I think, just to see a more even comparison.  My concern is<br/>
&gt; &gt; only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from a game mechanics perspective though as I have no doubt my playing<br/>
&gt; &gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a dark elf was a much more rewarding experience.  Has anyone else<br/>
&gt; &gt; noticed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that the warrior just is not different enough from the hybrid fighter<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; classes?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bael                                                    Aelyn<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Warrior of the 15th Order      or              Ranger of the 8th Rank<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Indigo Brotherhood                                Humble Servant of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Tunare<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still undecided<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
