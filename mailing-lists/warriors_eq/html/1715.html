feel bad about the low str.&nbsp; Like I said before my Gnome warrior does just 
fine.&nbsp; One thing I would try and do is get a faster weapon in your main 
hand but that will come.&nbsp; Wait till mid to high 40s and go to Karnors try 
and get a Jade Mace (9/18) or wait till about 51 or so and try and get a 
lamenation 9/19 some stats as well.&nbsp; But those weapons you have are much 
better than what I had at your lvl when I played my rogue, the warrior had great 
gear from lvl 6 or so.&nbsp; So enjoy your DE warrior and dont worry about the 
str.</span></font></div>

    <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Unless you are having problems carrying your 
    gear you really don&#39;t need treeweave. Get yourself a BEBP or Crafted BP and 
    then trade that sucker. That should be good plat. </font><font face="Arial"
 size="2">At 36th I would head over to Iceclad and camp snow cougars (they 
    still should be good XP) for the cougar claw earrings. I am thinking about 
    getting Kailyn one. I do really like the resist, though from the 3 AC/ 8 
    disease resistance earrings I have. Golden topaz??</font></div>

      <div><font face="Arial" size="2">I&nbsp;am pretty comfortable in a group with 
      my warrior at level 36.&nbsp; I&#39;ve known my role in a group all 
      along.&nbsp; I started grouping almost exclusively at around level 15, 
      though I can still solo a bit if I pick my locations carefully. Currently 
      I am doing soloing in Lower Guk live side if I can&#39;t get a 
      group.&nbsp;&nbsp; I really am trying to get in on Lord or Frenzy (Ha! 
      good luck). My exec axe is not as effective for me as it was at 30.&nbsp; 
      Soloing it doesn&#39;t swing often enough to do the damage fast enough.&nbsp; 
      I think I am underequipped in 1hs also using a enamelled black mace and a 
      obsidian scimitar.&nbsp; Perhaps its just because it seems everyone I 
      group with has better weapons then I do.</font></div>

        <div>3) Warriors were only &quot;useless&quot; the first 6 months of the games 
        existence...I know I experienced it first hand (same armor, weapons 
        &amp; hps as everyone else with zero distinguishing skills) .&nbsp; 
        These days with decent warr specific armor &amp; weapons we tank very 
        well at most levels.</div></blockquote></blockquote>
    <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh boy do I remember those days. Before 
    Crafted. Heck beserk did not even get added to the game before I hit 16th. 
    Those were the days the rangers were king. I even remember having the same 
    skill caps for O and D too. I was so dreading having to camp Rubi or buy 
    steel armor. 500 plat is a heck of a lot for a warrior. I think I was in a 
    bronze BP til 35th or so.</font></div>

        <div>4) The idea that warriors don&#39;t contribute significant offensive 
        damage is an old idea.&nbsp; With the uber hps high level MOBs the 
        damage we contribute over time is quite 
    significant.</div></blockquote></blockquote>
    <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Not to mention they have completely monty 
    hauled the weapons we use to keep all melee types significant. I wish they 
    had fixed the combat system instead. Do you remember when the 10/21 Spined 
    dragon Claws were one of the best weapons in the game. I can now get the as 
    good or better Lamentation (9/19 6 str/stm 20 HP) on a much easier camp (LOL 
    if you can camp the draco-lich). And what is the new spear from SoV? 
    13/20??!!</font></div>

        <div>5) Raising the defensive caps for the other classes actually makes 
        them stronger in the groups I play in.&nbsp; That means my groups 
        survive more. I kind of like that.<br>6) The mid 30s-40s is a tough spot 
        for warriors.&nbsp; Mostly because the other tank classes (Rangers/SKs 
        in particular) have similar agro capability to ourselves at this point 
        but little experience in the value of their role in a group.&nbsp; By 
        the mid 40s very few Rangers, SKs &amp; Pallies are actively trying 
        wrest agro away from a warrior...at least if they have any 
        brains.<br><br>regards<br><br>Flair Shieldrender<br>54 Champion Fennin
