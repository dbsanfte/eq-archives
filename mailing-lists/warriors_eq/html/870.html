<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-493399799">Wish I had read this yesterday!  I had the same experience in Crushbone last night.  Having just gotten the dual wield ability I added a second mino axe and proceeded to &quot;Ginsu&quot; (good name) the Orc Legionaires & Oracles in the castle.  Unfortunately I too ran out of stamina (I have 90+ sta) & was unable to flee when a bunch of the critters buddies showed up.  <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say I had to aplogize to my group a little for getting myself (& a couple of them) killed through this mistake (I mean hey aside from swimming I&#39;ve never even *seen* my sta bar move before).<br/>
<br/>
Question: If the weapon is faster but lighter doesn&#39;t it still wear down stamina (i.e. more swings burning more juice)?  Does this mean no matter what you equip you are still screwed for Sta?<br/>
<br/>
BTW:  You have not truely lived until you have been made into a tent peg by a giant!!<br/>

&gt; At level 15 I am just getting into the daul weild/double attack mode, but<br/>
&gt; Tom&#39;s info looks very appropriate.  My primary reason for looking to switch<br/>
&gt; from longsword primary and mino axe secondary isn&#39;t speed or damage its<br/>
&gt; STAMINA.  There is a current thread running on this topic - be sure you<br/>
&gt; check it out.  Mino axes are HEAVY, and weilding two weapons already takes a<br/>
&gt; lot of stamina.  Combine this with the fact that the length of your fights<br/>
&gt; increases with the level of the MOB and you run into quite a few situations<br/>
&gt; where you are runnng too low on mana.<br/>
&gt; Last weekend I was soloing some orcs in the south part of Oasis while I was<br/>
&gt; waiting for some friends to come so we could hunt some crocs.  I engaged a<br/>
&gt; lone orc and pulled him down to the beach.  While I was fighting this orc<br/>
&gt; (and doing pretty well - he was conning blue) I heard the DREADED sound of<br/>
&gt; an approaching giant (You know the sound if you&#39;ve heard it! It&#39;s one of the<br/>
&gt; few things that gives me an adrenaline rush EVERY time in EQ!).  Not wanting<br/>
&gt; to be squished like a bug, I tried to take myself and the orc closer to the<br/>
&gt; zone boundary - without getting into the ocean - and I got a LITTLE too<br/>
&gt; close to the OTHER orc that was in the camp.  To make a long story short I<br/>
&gt; managed to avoid the Giant, but I couldn&#39;t flee the orcs without running<br/>
&gt; into the giant.  I killed off the first orc and still had around half my<br/>
&gt; health...I ran out of stamina before I ran out of health with the second<br/>
&gt; orc, and I was pretty damn confused!  You see I was SWINGING, but I wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; HITTING anything.  I checked SEVERAL timesto make sure I was still in attack<br/>
&gt; mode and properly targeted (you guys know that feeling??) and then FINALLY<br/>
&gt; realized I was just plain ol&#39; tuckered out.  Anyway it came down to the last<br/>
&gt; couple of blows, and I DID die...but I learned a lesson too.  Mino axes are<br/>
&gt; pretty cool (and I love the way they look - 2 axes is even cooler!), but<br/>
&gt; swords are much less demanding on your stamina.<br/>
&gt; Right now I am trying to see if I can improve my Piercing skill (I think its<br/>
&gt; around 20, lol!) by sticking a Fine Steel Rapier in my secondary weapon<br/>
&gt; slot.  I&#39;ll let you all know how that works!<br/>
&gt; Thanks fer your time...sorry if I rambled!<br/>

&gt; You missed the recent discussion on that very topic.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Keep your 2 hander for dealing with blue creatures....keep your skill up.<br/>
&gt; As far as 1hs, use the longsword in your primary slot and the mino in your<br/>
&gt; secondary.  There may be a case for getting 2 swords for speed. I am not<br/>
&gt; sure you are getting the most out of dual wield with one fast and one slow<br/>
&gt; weapon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My current combo is primary: tentacle whip secondary: combine scimitar.   My<br/>
&gt; friends call me Ginsu :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;hey there..<br/>
&gt; &gt; I just got dual weild. I am thinking of changing from a FS two-handed<br/>
&gt; sword to two 1H/weapons. Do you think that a magic combine long sword and a<br/>
&gt; mino axe would make a good combination? Which one should I use as a primary<br/>
&gt; weapon? Any ideas or suggestions would be helpful! Thanks in advance!<br/>
