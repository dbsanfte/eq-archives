<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107616721">Hmmm I am really starting to hate campers.<br/>
<br/>
I use to take camping with a grain of salt and just move on.  This is now<br/>
becoming IMPOSSIBLE for me at my level to do.  Let me recite a little story.<br/>
<br/>
I login on Saturday starting out in lake rathe, camped.  Not to fussed since<br/>
I can not pull the aviaks anyway, only CASTERS can.  Whats up with that?<br/>
<br/>
I moved on to the Egret Aviaks, CAMPED.  hmmm no problem lets try HH, both<br/>
ends camped. sigh, oh well im near Neriak I can head home to stock up and<br/>
try out lesser faydark and Mistmoore.  On the boat I get, I arrive in<br/>
Mistmoore for the first time, thought the place was pretty cool.  Learned<br/>
the easier areas pretty quick and start pulling for my group.<br/>
<br/>
Wow this is going pretty well.  Hmmm zone went from 2 groups to 5 groups.<br/>
One group SIITING on the gargoyle spawn, another group hogging THE whole<br/>
graveyard, and the third, this is the best, the third camping the CORRIDOR<br/>
between the easy side of Mistmoore to the hard side of Mistmoore.  I mean<br/>
C&#39;MON.  Thats just RUDE.  Everytime we tried to pull some tuffer mobs<br/>
through the corridor their mages pets went berserk and they effectively took<br/>
all the kills.<br/>
<br/>
SIGH<br/>
<br/>
I remember when lake rathe was empty.  I remember when HH was empty.  Is it<br/>
just because most people on the server are my level ?<br/>
<br/>
People just DONT understand that a spawn can only support SO many groups.<br/>
Oh, a word of warning, NEVER take a caster to the Aviaks In Lake Rathe, they<br/>
wont leave.  I know a few of my friends who I didn&#39;t see until they made<br/>
level 25.  They just would not leave that easy xp area.  I hate it.<br/>
<br/>
ARGH!<br/>
<br/>
ahhh I feel much better now, thanks for listening.<br/>
<br/>
I will be starting a new character on MM just to see if its a little better<br/>
WAY behind the pack.  Lets hope it is.</div>
