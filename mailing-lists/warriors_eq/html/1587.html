<div id="ygrps-yiv-612365404">You definitely need to keep both skills maxxed.<br/>
<br/>
When fighting mobs who are red to you, you will find you miss often.  So it is the situation in which you would use dual wield in order to get more attacks and a better chance to hit and do damage.  Against other mobs though 2 handed is better.  Currently I have a BIBS (Blackened Iron Bastard Sword) and I am level 22.<br/>
<br/>
I hit for about 46 max damage per swing, and when I get double attack I often hit for a total of 70+ damage per round.  Throw in a kick for another 20 and it is not unusual for me to deal 100 damage per round.<br/>
<br/>
For 1 hand slashing I have a PGT and a Obsidian scimitar.  I hit for an average of 14 damage per hit, with dual wield and double attack in same round I do around 40+ damage with a kick for 20 I can do 60+ per round.  <br/>
<br/>
Over time there isn&#39;t much difference between 1 handed and 2 handed, when you calculate in misses over the long term they are equally effective.  Until you obtain 1hs weapons that have a  damage rating of 10 or higher.<br/>
