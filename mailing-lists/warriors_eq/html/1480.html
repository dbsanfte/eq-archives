&gt; *grin* You can disagree all you like, but that&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; going to change the game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fair enough; I firmly believe you&#39;re incorrect.  See<br/>
below.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Monks and Warriors have similar, but not exactly the<br/>
&gt; same AC.  Warriors are always (with proper<br/>
 </span></blockquote>equipment)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; approximately 10-30 points higher on AC for each<br/>
&gt; given level.  This may seem insignificant, however,<br/>
&gt; EQ uses these sorts of tiny differentials as the<br/>
&gt; basis for damage calculations.  Given the way AC<br/>
&gt; advances (3-5 point increase purely on level alone)<br/>
&gt; there are easy ways for EQ to &#39;normalize&#39; the AC vs.<br/>
&gt; Offense to determine relative damage levels for<br/>
&gt; enemies of similar level.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, if AC is all that matters, why do a pair of<br/>
characters at equal level and Defensive skills have<br/>
such vast differences?  One a Ranger in full banded,<br/>
the other a Warrior/Paladin/ShadowKnight in full<br/>
plate; the Rangers consistently take more damage from<br/>
fights than their heavily armored fellow tanks.<br/>
<br/>
Still don&#39;t like that test?  Try this one: take *your*<br/>
WAR/PAL/SDK and get a full suit of plate to match the<br/>
full suit of banded you&#39;re so proud of.  Go fight a<br/>
few blue mobs in your banded armor and note the<br/>
strength of the blows that connect against you; how<br/>
much single shots tend to do, how many low damage<br/>
shots you receive, and how much total damage you take<br/>
over the fight.<br/>
<br/>
Now put on the plate and try another few fights<br/>
against similar mobs (level and race).  You should<br/>
notice fewer shots dealing maximum damage against you,<br/>
more shots doing low damage (2-10 where before it<br/>
would have been 40-60 on each connect), and less total<br/>
damage at the end of the fight.<br/>
<br/>
You think you&#39;ve found some secret uber-combo (ala<br/>
Tekken or something, up-up-down-left-right left and<br/>
right punch together to produce the MegaFireball) or<br/>
something; this game has shown no instances of such<br/>
imbalances.<br/>
<br/>
Do you truly think they managed to get all the way<br/>
through four phases of beta and the past 4-6 months of<br/>
final and never notice that plate, as you are<br/>
alledging, is useless?<br/>
<br/>
Thinking you&#39;ve found some hidden truth; that banded<br/>
is marginally (5% or less) effective than Plate but<br/>
has a fraction of the weight ... folly.  Sheer folly.<br/>
<br/>
Plate matters in a fight.  I&#39;ll take plate armored<br/>
tanks over those in banded seven days a week and the<br/>
rest of the month too.  I have watched the performance<br/>
of Rangers (since they *can&#39;t* have better than<br/>
banded) higher than my level for months now; they&#39;re<br/>
stuck in banded while I&#39;m in plate, and I take less<br/>
damage when tanking.  I&#39;ve watched warriors who aren&#39;t<br/>
plate armored yet, and I take less damage than they<br/>
when tanking.  And I only have an 80 AGI, so it&#39;s not<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
But hey, whatever you want to do.  If you&#39;re in my<br/>
group though, I won&#39;t appreciate the higher percentage<br/>
of the healers&#39; mana you&#39;ll be taking to recover from<br/>
the greater damage you&#39;ll be taking.  I suspect they<br/>
won&#39;t either.<br/>
