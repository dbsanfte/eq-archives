<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210186220">Are you sure they she sells them. I&#39;ve never been able to buy them (don&#39;t need<br/>
to anyway) and when I sell items, she is one of my favorites because my selling<br/>
price to her tends to be higher. I would be intrested to find out SHE actually<br/>
sold them. If so I would have bought one looooongg ago instead of fighting the<br/>
gnoll commander for mine. Or was that the gnoll elites ... don&#39;t remember. One<br/>
of the two of them had it spawn occasionally. But mine was only like AC+3 and<br/>
STR+2(or +3 .... damn I can&#39;t remember crap today). I will check later. I would<br/>
be glad to steer new warriors to her shop if she sells them though.<br/>
