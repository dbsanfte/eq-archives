<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016571005">The zone is South Ro.  I remember when those orcs scared the hell out of me<br/>
my first trip to inothule and ferrot, they were red, then yellow, then blue<br/>
and now REALLY green.  Just for fun I run straight through the camps now :).<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; well I havent played a troll warrior but I am playing a barbarian warrior <br/>
&gt; and I have played a troll SW.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; bash bash bash. bashin es whad trolls do an they reeeli gud tu.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I dont know about any warrior quests but check out the SW guildmaster, he <br/>
&gt; might know.<br/>
&gt; Go out in the swamp and stay close to the guards in the beginning.<br/>
&gt; remember that water moccasins are poisenus and kinda annoying, there are <br/>
&gt; better things to kill. Get the regular newbie mobs like skells and stuff.<br/>
&gt; As <br/>
&gt; you are a warrior wack white and yellow stuff in the beginning. Just <br/>
&gt; remember to stay close to the guards.<br/>
&gt; When you feel a bit more sure about yerself follow the steady stream of <br/>
&gt; people to the island in the middle of the swamp (its kinda hard to find in<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the beginning)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are plenty of froglocks there to bash. Bet keep in mind that they<br/>
&gt; help <br/>
&gt; eachother and the situation can easily get outofhand.<br/>
&gt; there are several different frogloks and some are harder the others. If I <br/>
&gt; remember it correctly its froglok, froglok fishermen, froglok foragers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They also have armor sometimes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At level 7 as sw, prolly level 5 or 6 as warrior you can starta a team and<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; pull some orcs from the zone just opposite the town.<br/>
&gt; Sorry I dont remember the name but its realy easy to find.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; well thats all I can come up with atm.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; well there is guk dungeon too but I dont know if its worth going there<br/>
&gt; when <br/>
&gt; you start up, there is some realy NASTY stuff inthere and trains can be <br/>
&gt; painfull at times.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not a good guide but I hope it will give you some poiters and ideas.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hail Great and learned warriors.  I have decided to start playing a Troll<br/>
&gt; &gt;Warrior and would like some advice.  All I know now is to grab the first <br/>
&gt; &gt;two<br/>
&gt; &gt;handed sword I can find and start killing everything in site.  Any<br/>
&gt; &gt;suggestions on how to play the largest evil killing machine in Norrath?<br/>
