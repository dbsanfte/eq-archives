<div id="ygrps-yiv-200843319">The armor is not no-drop, it is only Lore, meaning you can only have one of <br/>
each piece (except the bracers, I am assuming).<br/>
<br/>
Also the quest has just been available since one of the more recent patches, <br/>
about a week and a half.  Talking to many of the druids who live in South <br/>
Karana, this is what they have said between rounds of kiting.<br/>
