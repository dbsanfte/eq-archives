<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218791467">I read on anothjer mailing list that the crit hit system wasn&#39;t THAT great but that it was an improvement. In levels 1-5 he critically hit somewhere in the range of 5-7 times. I am also sure the added HPs will help too.  <br/>
<br/>
Am I just not recieving emails anymore or has the traffic on here REALLY slowed down a lot? Also whats the going prices on PGT&#39;s now and runed falchions? I love my combine scimitars altho now I am test driving a tentacle whip at the Oasis.<br/>

As I understand it there is a critical hit system in place now.</div>
