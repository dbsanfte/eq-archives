Hi all,<br/>
i tried to solo the warlord goblin in Runnyeye, however i pulled 1 elite<br/>
with him as well...thanks to my jboots i got to the zone without damage.<br/>
<br/>
i then proceeded to beat up on the warlord as he was my original target.<br/>
but of course i was getting whacked by both elite and warlord at same<br/>
time. Now either i was unluckly or i am way under equipped (lvl 30, pgt<br/>
+ dirk, bronze armour) but i was whipped...i actually got the warlord to<br/>
run, and chased him a bit...but the elite was hitting me still, and i<br/>
just managed to zone without killing either with only 2 hps left.<br/>
<br/>
so my question is this...should i have killed the elite first, which is<br/>
a green crit? or was staying on the warlord the best thing?<br/>
<br/>
i guess it might depend on my ultimate goal...and my goal then was to<br/>
just kill the damn warlord...as i had to goto work in 5 mins...if i had<br/>
more time, maybe i should have killed elite, zoned to rest and gone back<br/>
for warlord...<br/>
<br/>
But im getting off my question here...if solo, should you take out the<br/>
hardest crit first or weakest?<br/>
