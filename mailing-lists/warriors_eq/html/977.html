<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118726505">Got up this morning camped just outside of the entrance to Guk.  As I was <br/>
putting my stuff away I was think about the good times I has with my guild <br/>
mates hunting frogs in the dungeon.  I had never been to Guk and it was a <br/>
lot of fun.  Well mostly fun, that one train that wiped out the entire party <br/>
was no fun, especially the walk back from the high pass.<br/>
<br/>
So now I was along in the swamps and backing my stuff.  Darn backpacks were <br/>
heavy and as I put them all one I realized I was encumbered now the �Spirit <br/>
of the Bear� had left me (141/130).  Time to go sell.  Maybe there is a spot <br/>
in South Ro I could sell, if not there I knew I could sell at the inn in <br/>
Oasis.  Oasis would be good.  There I could get some experience killing <br/>
crocodiles and caimans.<br/>
<br/>
So adjusting my backpacks I started off running around the side of the swamp <br/>
to the pass leading to South Ro.  An easy trot saw a couple of frogs and an <br/>
alligator or two, but nothing that looked worth hunting.<br/>
<br/>
Once I zoned to South Ro I decided to look around a bit to see what was <br/>
around.  Just a bunch of Orcs, had to kill a couple just because, but didn�t <br/>
get any experience.  It was also kind of fun to walk straight through the <br/>
Orc camps since they were too scared of me to do anything.<br/>
<br/>
�Well enough of this� I thought and turned to go into the desert.  Time to <br/>
sell my loot and get to killing crocodiles.<br/>
<br/>
As I was crossing the desert I came across a couple of Troll and a dark elf <br/>
killing dervishes.  Stopped to check things out for a second and to see what <br/>
the camp looked like.  As I was checking things out I saw a skeleton <br/>
standing out in front of the tents all by himself.  Well, figured I would <br/>
get closer and check him out, might be some good experience for me on the <br/>
way to Oasis.  Big mistake, wasn�t just any skeleton but a dry bone skeleton <br/>
that didn�t like barbarians.<br/>
<br/>
The trolls jumped in to help me, but even with my dual long swords flying <br/>
and the trolls beating on the skeleton, I soon found myself laying on my <br/>
back again wondering why I ever got so close to the skeleton.<br/>
<br/>
Well soon after that I found myself back in the high hold pass naked except <br/>
for my kilt.  As I was standing up I got a message from Rallos Zek, the once <br/>
I was hoping not to here � �You have failed me once again young barbarian, <br/>
no longer can you claim the 16th Rank of warrior, you have lost a level and <br/>
are now 15 again.�<br/>
<br/>
Drat and darn, not only did I lose a level, had a long walk ahead of me, but <br/>
all my spare stuff from the bank vault was on my body.  Oh well, back to the <br/>
battle, now I really had to go back to Oasis as soon as possible to make <br/>
16th Rank again.  Pissing off Rallos Zek is never a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
So I ran as fast as I can, past ghouls, giant spiders, sand giants and orcs. <br/>
  Finally I was back in the desert of South Ro, hugging the wall, and <br/>
looking for my body.<br/>
<br/>
Running south to the dervish tents, I suddenly heard the sound no one wants <br/>
to hear.  Even the bravest warrior blanches in fear when she hears the <br/>
pounding footsteps of a giant behind her.<br/>
<br/>
A sand giant hits you for 96 points<br/>
A sand giant hits you for 87 points<br/>
You are stunned�<br/>
<br/>
Well that hurt.  Once I found myself back in the Pass I decided that was <br/>
enough for the day.  Looking around I found myself a nice flat rock to rest <br/>
on and lay down to camp.  Good thing I am a barbarian and the chill air this <br/>
high didn�t bother me.  Guess I will go get my body later tonight.<br/>
<br/>
For the Honor and Glory of Rallos Zek;<br/>
