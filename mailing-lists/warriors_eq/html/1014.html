<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957995108">I am to be questing for an Oaken Scimitar for a Ranger friend.<br/>
<br/>
I have NO idea where to find this item.  I don&#39;t know what zone I can find<br/>
it or on what mob.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone provide any info?<br/>
<br/>
I am also after a shiny brass halberd for myself.  I know it is supposed to<br/>
be in Highpass Hold, but I don&#39;t know what carries it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d really hate to go looking on spoiler pages for this info because I<br/>
always find out more than I want to know.  I really just want to know where<br/>
I am supposed to be looking for it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
