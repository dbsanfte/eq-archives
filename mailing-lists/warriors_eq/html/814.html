<div id="ygrps-yiv-687008462">Grukklukk still having NO problems wit them blues...me still able to take<br/>
them whites most of the time without any problems.  At this lvl (15) I can<br/>
solo a Dervish Thug (cons white) and need no help 9 out of 10 times.  Now<br/>
them Derv Mojo Casters...them a different story!  I can still take them once<br/>
in a while, but I usually need some helps right at the end of the fight.<br/>
BTW, I took a rather unique approach when I started this troll....put my<br/>
pints into DEX...and it does seem to work!  I figured with my high base STR<br/>
I would already do quite a bit of damage, so I was looking for a way to<br/>
increase the frequency of my HITS.<br/>
Works for me!<br/>

I think the end result to this argument is that the warrior will not be able<br/>
to level without a group at higher levels.<br/>
<br/>
Is that what everyone else gets out of it?  We can take tons of damage but<br/>
simply can&#39;t dish out enough compared to mages.  I know that alot of blues<br/>
start to give warriors trouble in the level 15 range....although we can kill<br/>
them they hit alot more often than blues did at lower levels.  Sometimes I<br/>
get lucky and can kill it with only losing a single bubble of health, other<br/>
times I am down to one or two bubbles and I have to go &quot;buttdown&quot; for 15<br/>
minutes or so before I can get back into action. I assume that as I get<br/>
higher in level it will only get worse.  Any comments?<br/>
<br/>
Also, is there a magic item that gives any kind of regen ability? Like a<br/>
ring of regeneration that would allow me to rest up hit points like a troll.<br/>
Or as if a bard was playing their regen song. I know about the bark potions<br/>
but at my current level they are to expensive for practical use.<br/>

&gt;very true, warriors become damage absorbtion machines.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BUT, even tho I don&#39;t do near the over all damage, its still nice to see me<br/>

&gt;Who cares what damage a warrior does at 35+<br/>
&gt;That is not our role......suck it up...all of the damage.<br/>
&gt;That is what you are here for.<br/>
&gt;Try doin more damage then a wiz or a mate.....I think not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Warriors ar not the ones to dish out the damage....at lower levels yea but<br/>
&gt;at higer levels we just keep em occupied.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Yup & the gap seems to get worse the higher in levels you go.  Not only<br/>
&gt;&gt;Rangers, but Paladins & especially Monks seem to greatly diminish the role<br/>
&gt;&gt;of the warrior at levels 25+.  Eventually the other classes have similar<br/>
&gt;&gt;(within a couple of 100 hps) stats and much more diversity in terms of<br/>
&gt;&gt;healing & hth damage capability.  Mind you that my opinion is based on<br/>
&gt;&gt;talking with high level players (who have tried to convince me to dump my<br/>
&gt;&gt;warrior) & from reading on the eqstratics site.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;There is an interesting thread on the eqstratics board (warriors)<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; This past week I decided to take a break from my level 15 dark elf<br/>
&gt;&gt;warrior.  I was abit frustrated.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I started a half-elf warrior in Kelethin.  It is insanely easy to play<br/>
&gt;&gt;there.  I made level 5 in about 3.5 hours.  Then I stopped and tried a<br/>

&gt;&gt;poorly balanced of all the hybrids.  After 4 hours I reached level 5 and<br/>
&gt;&gt;got kick.  I am now 12-18 hours into the character and almost level 9.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt;am just as capable as an equivalent warrior.  Next level I gain an array<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; My point is, with a ranger class as powerful a combatant as it is I see<br/>
