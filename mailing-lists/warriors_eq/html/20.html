<div id="ygrps-yiv-821958916">BB is an AWSOME place for EXPS if you nkow how to work it.  I was a solo<br/>
warrior there from 8th to 16th and did that in about a week.  Just learn<br/>
where everything is, and I mean everything, know what gnolls pop where.<br/>
then just run around kill the ones that con blue all day long. there are<br/>
so many of them that before you even know it you&#39;ll be about to level.  <br/>

&gt; My male human warrior is Snyak - bound at Qeynos on Innorruk. I made<br/>
&gt; level 9<br/>
&gt; last night - woo hoo!  Twice actually - too many stupid deaths: Holly<br/>
&gt; got me<br/>
&gt; when I was not looking, that dang Gnoll Commander in Black Burrow that<br/>
&gt; hangs<br/>
&gt; out on the far side of the river on the left once you get down by the<br/>
&gt; rock<br/>
&gt; and the first bridge.  One time I tried to drag him back to a wizard<br/>
&gt; friend<br/>
&gt; for an ambush but got dizzy and he whacked me good.  Next time, I came<br/>
&gt; back<br/>
&gt; with more friends - a wizard and a druid and we tried to gang him.  We<br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; him too and then 2 more of his GS buds showed up and we were ded meat<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; that point.<br/>
&gt; But he is gonna pay for that because I am coming back with all my<br/>
&gt; friends<br/>
&gt; and we are gonna hand him a full can of KickButt(tm)!<br/>
&gt; So, even at level 8 I have been finding it harder and harder to get xp<br/>
&gt; -<br/>
&gt; solo or in partys.  I have been doing either BB (for loot) or West<br/>
&gt; Karanas<br/>
&gt; (for xp).  Are the aqueducts any good for low 9&#39;s?  I kinda really<br/>
&gt; hate<br/>
&gt; mazes and tunnels - I still get lost going to the bank!  Or is it time<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; venture forth?  I have been to N Karanas (hate gryfawns with a<br/>
&gt; passion!) and<br/>
&gt; S Karanas near Split Paw one time but MD seemed low then.<br/>
&gt; One of my goals is to try to catch a cleric friend who is at level 14<br/>
&gt; (he<br/>
&gt; got a real job so he can&#39;t play EQ all day long no more :-)  But I am<br/>
&gt; up for<br/>
&gt; adventure as well.  And I have spent some time helping others and<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s fun<br/>
&gt; too.  <br/>
&gt; Any thoughts?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
