<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104762488">Well I may as well tell you now luckily I&#39;ve gotten up to level 29 and my hunting ground is only good for one more level maybe two. Personally I&#39;m kind of confused why somebody would tell it all over a mailing list. Anyway the Treeants in South Karana is my hunting ground well was. The only problem is the good races can&#39;t there because they become kos by all Qeynos guards, the treefolk, some other treefolk, and druids. However they do gain good faction with the evil druids.</div>
