<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121766272">Don&#39;t get your self killed for the sake of getting your skills maxed out for that level.  Your skills will advance it may take a couple levels but they&#39;ll eventually get maxed out.  If I were to go by your strategy of getting my self killed so my skills would be maxed out per level, I&#39;d still be 25 working on my reposte skill, I&#39;m almost 28th, so don&#39;t expect everytime that you get a new skill that you will have it maxed out by the time you make your next level.<br/>

As far as factions are concerned.....one of the biggest advantages of being &quot;evil&quot; is that you can kill any good NPC you want to, and some of the good NPCs drop really nice loot.  Personally I can&#39;t wait till I get high 40s and I can walk into freeport and whoop up on some guards (with a good evil party of course) :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am Bael, a warrior of the 15th Order and a dark elf.  At the start of this level I put 20 points each into dual wield and double attack. I am a little over a bubble away from  16 and my skills are now 65 for dual wield and 72 for double attack.  My rate of advancement has slowed considerably, I am wondering if I should expect to max these at 80 before I hit 16 or if that is uncommon.<br/>
<br/>
If I can max them I will likely get myself killed right before i level up in order to buy some more time at 15.<br/>
<br/>
By the way I am using a combine scimitar and tentacle whip against magical opponents and dual mino axes against non-magical opponents.  My max damage per round is 79, that is double attacks on both weapons with max damage(17) and a max damage kick (11).  <br/>

And in reference to others questions about faction.  It is easy enough to gain enough faction for the Commonlands vendors to deal with you, just kill orcs by the dozens.  I kill every orc I see, pawns, centurions and so on.  You can get Freeport residents to deal with you by completing the orc slashed belt quest repeatedly.  If you do that tho you faction with the Paladins in North Freeport will get worse.  It is up to you whether West and east freeport are more important to you then North Freeport<br/>
