<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142165621">Killing something 4 levels above you is not hard. Any good group can do it.<br/>
 Also, now that I&#39;m 22nd level, often the groups I&#39;m in (and if you hit 20<br/>
and don&#39;t group all the time, you are wasting your time IMHO) vary in level<br/>
by more than 4 levels. I&#39;ve killed giant skels (level 22-25) with a group<br/>
all at or below 20. When I got my SBH, no one in the group was above 20 and<br/>
the orc that drops it is at least 24th. Brad has always said that twinking<br/>
catches up to you, and I believe it. A friend had a 17th level halfling<br/>
warrior and decided to pass all his gear on to a wood elf ranger he wanted<br/>
to try (full set of ring, mino axe, tentacle whip). He had the hardest time<br/>
judging what to kill and he was levelling so fast his skills didn&#39;t stay<br/>
up. <br/>
<br/>
There a very few items I would pay for that could be found as loot. Find<br/>
out where they are located, go there, and get in a group. The only money<br/>
I&#39;ve spent since level 13 when I bought a regular battle axe (at the time I<br/>
made 13 very few FS weapons were being found on CT) the only cash I&#39;ve<br/>
spent was about 80pp for most of a set of banded and 6pp for snakeskin<br/>
gloves (no matter how often I&#39;ve been in Paw, I never find snakeskin). Been<br/>
kicking a fair amount into guild so I have about 90pp at level 22 (money<br/>
really isn&#39;t that important to me) and am trying to meet a fletcher I know<br/>
who will sell me a shaped ash bow for 60pp. If evil races could fletch easy<br/>
I&#39;d be making my own by now, but hey, Verant all plays good races (in beta<br/>
I can remember 2 GM&#39;s who were regularly evil) and us ogres and trolls get<br/>
screwed (try to smith as one sometime). May spend a few spare plats on some<br/>
bronze from some guild mates who have been hunting Najena heavy, or may<br/>
just go join them and take it from the dead body of the captain.<br/>

levels above you and your party, you cannot obtain or use the specific<br/>
item.<br/>
