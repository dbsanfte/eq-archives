<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150251745">Best group combo so far for me.<br/>
<br/>
1 warrior<br/>
1 ranger<br/>
1 paladin<br/>
1 cleric<br/>
1 druid<br/>
1 wizard<br/>
<br/>
I did main duty as the primary tank.  The ranger did the pulling.  Paladin<br/>
tanked.  Cleric healed.  Druid was able to provide healing or burning as<br/>
needed, and kept us all SoWed.  Wizard burned.<br/>
<br/>
The druid is my favorite class to add to a group.  At higher levels their<br/>
utility spells are exceptional.  They are 80% effective as a cleric in<br/>
healing, and 70% as good as wizard for burning.  Instead of having 2<br/>
wizards, or 2 clerics a druid can be whatever a group needs at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to this my best group consisted of 2 clerics, 1 wizard and 3 tanks.<br/>

In your experience what has been the best group make-up that you have been a<br/>
part of?  If possible give a little input on why it was the best group<br/>
make-up.  I&#39;m concerned here with character classes, not level.  Interested<br/>
in group sizes anywhere between 2 and 6.  Of particular interest to me is<br/>
what it&#39;s like to group with an enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve mostly played in very small groups.  I usually play with one other<br/>
person in my group.  A cleric was nice to group with in the pre-teens since<br/>
he did comparable melee damage and could keep me healed up.  In the teens I<br/>
began grouping with a magician.  He used a water elemental for a pet which<br/>
is supposed to be about the equivalent of an equal level troll warrior.  I<br/>
would let the elemental tank for me and I would stand at that perfect<br/>
distance where the mob attacks the elemental and not me, yet I could still<br/>
get my hits in.  Since the elemental regains HP at about 10 points per round<br/>
as opposed to my two it meant less down time.  At level 12 the magician had<br/>
a DD spell that did 90+ damage, very nice when it was needed to finish<br/>
something off quick.  He could also summon bandages so I get healed up to<br/>
50% for free.  As a two man team the magician was much better than the<br/>
cleric because we could dish out much more damage in less time, and with the<br/>
pet taking much of the damage healing was not really necessary.  As an added<br/>
bonus the pet could play the part of sacrificial lamb while we zoned when<br/>
things got nasty.<br/>
