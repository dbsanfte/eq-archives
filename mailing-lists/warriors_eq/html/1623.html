<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948403877">Patty, I have tried for about 48 levels to put hotkeys to my weapons like<br/>
you have.  I have had 0 success.  Can you please explain to me in detail how<br/>
to make a weapon hotkey so I can change between my 1hs/2hs weapons faster.<br/>
As well as make hotkeys for my jboots and guise.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the web page is great, I just have a few suggestions.  The always<br/>
taunt thing imho is incorrect.  If you continually are taunting, the mob<br/>
will be mad at you sure.  But when the wizard hits him with a DD that really<br/>
pisses him off, you won&#39;t be able to taunt hard enough to get him off your<br/>
nuker.  So I suggest only taunting every now and then.  You should be doing<br/>
enough damage that you are pissing that mob off to begin with without the<br/>
taunt.  Then when someone does get him agitated and he turns to them, you<br/>
can easily use taunt to turn him back to you.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the difference between 1hs and 2hs damage ammounts will be pretty<br/>
significant at the lower levels.  When you reach higher levels, duel<br/>
wielding 1hs&#39;s can be of a significant advantage when you have close to 10<br/>
damage weapons that proc effects and are fairly fast.  Specially with<br/>
celerity of swift like the wind =)  I still almost continually use 2hs<br/>
myself though as my primary weapon.  Haven&#39;t found my Ykeshas yet =)<br/>
<br/>
Other than that great page.  Good information and keep those youngin&#39;s in<br/>
line.<br/>
