                     EverQuest Producer Brad McQuaid recently posted an<br/>
update to the Anti-Camping situation on our General<br/>
                     Board. Here&#39;s what he had to say in this update: <br/>
<br/>
                          We&#39;ve decided what we&#39;re going to do, at least<br/>
short term, about some of the camping problems.<br/>
<br/>
                          First, though, I want to thank everyone for all<br/>
the feedback and ideas -- I read through all the<br/>
                          posts and emails that I received and the vast<br/>
majority were not only civil but well thought out. <br/>
<br/>
                          I&#39;ve decided, at least at this point, to not<br/>
pursue the no-item load idea. I think perhaps such as<br/>
                          drastic change this far into release would cause<br/>
more confusion and even harm than it might<br/>
                          solve. I didn&#39;t do a scientific analysis, but it<br/>
seemed that at least half of the people posted,<br/>
                          perhaps more, were against the no-item load<br/>
idea. Perhaps if we&#39;d implemented it in beta it<br/>
                          would have worked better... but as I&#39;ve posted<br/>
in the recent past, we are often at a point now<br/>
                          where changes to solve or address one problem<br/>
create other problems. This is true both<br/>
                          because EverQuest is a very large and complex<br/>
game, and also because people tend to prefer<br/>
                          the status quo, even though often they will<br/>
complain about it. <br/>
<br/>
                          What many of you do seem to want is something<br/>
we&#39;ve been slowly implementing, mostly with<br/>
                          newer items, as of late. These are the &#39;lore&#39;<br/>
items, of which you can only possess one at a time.<br/>
                          Our first plan to help with the camping problem<br/>
is to go through and make a great many of the<br/>
                          existing items (for example, the BBC) lore<br/>
items. These items will soon appear as &#39;pending lore&#39;<br/>
                          items or some such, to indicate to owners that<br/>
they should trade/sell/destroy all but one of<br/>
                          these items in their inventory if they own more<br/>
than one. Then, a week or so after they appear as<br/>
                          &#39;pending lore&#39;, they will become lore items. It<br/>
is important that you only have one of these items<br/>
                          at that time, in that the server will remove any<br/>
duplicates. We will give plenty of warning in the<br/>
                          news file that displays when you enter the game. <br/>
<br/>
                          I think this will help, and will be less of a<br/>
sweeping change than my earlier proposal. It won&#39;t<br/>
                          solve the &#39;problem&#39;, but I think the situation<br/>
will improve. If a player, regardless of level, is<br/>
                          harvesting an item, he will have to trade or<br/>
sell the item before obtaining another, which typically<br/>
                          means leaving the area, giving others the<br/>
opportunity to go after it. <br/>
<br/>
                          Our minds are pretty made up in terms of going<br/>
forward with items changing to lore items, but<br/>
                          please, let&#39;s continue the camping debate -- it<br/>
can only make the game better.</div>
