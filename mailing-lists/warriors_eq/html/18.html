<div id="ygrps-yiv-151864028">Hi james, i have a level 14 warrior dark elf, but i have ventured all over<br/>
Norrath. Ive been to qeynos and i must say that that area has spots for<br/>
cash, or spots for exp, but its hard to find one with both. Being level 9 it<br/>
would be good to group with another level 9 char and go to the sewers, as<br/>
there is lots of smugglers and thugs there. Good exp and so so cash. To be<br/>
honest im not partial to BB at all...actually i think its a rather poor<br/>
dungeon compared to all others i have seen ( befallen, Najena being the<br/>
best.) wait till you are level 12 or so then go for Gnoll Guardsmen and the<br/>
occasional Elite. that will be nice exp, dont know about cash. Then when you<br/>
hit level 14 or so go up to the everfrost and permafrost zones, go hunt ice<br/>
goblins in a group of 3 people. Its amazing for loot and for exp trust me on<br/>
this one. If you are up for adventuring, make your way across the Continent<br/>
and head for the Freeport areas, lots of good places for both loot and EXP<br/>
here. Such as The desert of Ro, Befallen, West commons, many orc camps and<br/>
Dirvish camps all throught those areas. Give it a try!<br/>
