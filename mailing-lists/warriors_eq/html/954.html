<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915004292">Nope, the same thing happened to me on a rusty 2-H I had when I was low level. I<br/>
had to jump start the skill with about 6 or 8 points before it even started<br/>
advancing. Not sure why though.<br/>

&gt; I noticed something curious yesterday.  My level 23rd character has a bbc, I<br/>
&gt; never use it, but I dont want to give it away either.  I started another<br/>
&gt; warrior and gave her the BBC.  I wanted to keep both my 1hslash and 2hslash<br/>
&gt; nice and high with this character.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After 2 levels my 2hand slash NEVER went up.  I did put a practice point in<br/>
&gt; it as well, seems odd.  New programming for powerful items? </span></blockquote></div>
