<div id="ygrps-yiv-516131145">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
Well, I have decided to learn how to fletch and take up Archery...<br/>
Fletching is to say the least boring but I have my skill up to 21 now<br/>
*yawns*. From what I have read, at 35 points I should be able to make a<br/>
bow *grins*, but until then what do I buy to practice my skill with. The<br/>
arrows I have made so far have a 50, 100, 125 range on them.<br/>
<br/>
I figure while getting my strenght back after battling the critters,<br/>
fletching would be a good pass time. *shrugs* and archery will help me<br/>
pull from a distance.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice is appreciated,<br/>
<br/>
