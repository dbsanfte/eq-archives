<b>Subject:</b> Re: AC is all that matters. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-224253768">Jiya guyz. First let me say that I am really happy to be seeing actual<br/>
discussion on this list rather than flames. Now to add my Quarter after<br/>
buying two dime candies and three penny candies, let me state this: It DOES<br/>
matter what kind of armor you have on, *BUT* it is also the AC that matters.<br/>
Here&#39;s an example. When I started my ranger I was wearing mostly patchwork<br/>
armor, then I moved up to leather. Take a leather gorget as the example. AC<br/>
3. A studded leather gorget is the SAME AC value, but adds +1 STA and +1<br/>
STR. Watch your AC when you switch them. It will drop by about 5 points.<br/>
Mine went from 210 to 205 at level 9 even though they both had the same AC.<br/>
I gave up the +&#39;s for the higher AC since, at level 9, STR doesn&#39;t count for<br/>
diddly squat except for weight allowance. Don&#39;t belive me, try it yourself.<br/>
Take something that has the same AC value but is of a different material and<br/>
watch your AC drop.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; *grin* You can disagree all you like, but that&#39;s not going to change<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the game.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Fair enough; I firmly believe you&#39;re incorrect.  See below.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *laugh*  Firmly believe away, but please only do so after reading the rest<br/>
&gt; of this article.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ok, if AC is all that matters, why do a pair of characters at equal<br/>
&gt; &gt; level and Defensive skills have such vast differences?  One a Ranger in<br/>
&gt; &gt; full banded, the other a Warrior/Paladin/ShadowKnight in full plate; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rangers consistently take more damage from fights than their heavily<br/>
&gt; &gt; armored fellow tanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok... have you actually looked at the AC advantage that Plate provides<br/>
&gt; over Banded?  Have you actually _asked_ a Ranger in full Banded his AC and<br/>
&gt; then compared it to yours (assuming in full Plate)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s the numbers.  Armor sets add the following amount to your &#39;base&#39; AC<br/>
&gt; from level/agility/defense skill.  (Note that there are some modifying<br/>
&gt; effects. e.g., Armor provides more AC for characters with high (90+)<br/>
&gt; Agility.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Full Plate: 110 AC<br/>
&gt; Full Banded: 77 AC<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; AC differential: 33 AC (not including modifying effects)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That is where the difference in damage arises, not from the type of armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you were to replace all of these Plate pieces with Magical Leather<br/>
&gt; Armor that totalled up to 110AC you would receive the _exact_ same<br/>
&gt; protection as if you had Plate on (level and skill being equal).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Still don&#39;t like that test?  Try this one: take *your* WAR/PAL/SDK and<br/>
&gt; &gt; get a full suit of plate to match the full suit of banded you&#39;re so<br/>
&gt; &gt; proud of.  Go fight a few blue mobs in your banded armor and note the<br/>
&gt; &gt; strength of the blows that connect against you; how much single shots<br/>
&gt; &gt; tend to do, how many low damage shots you receive, and how much total<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage you take over the fight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As noted above, your test is flawed because there is a serious AC<br/>
&gt; difference between the Banded and Plate.  And I have tested both Plate and<br/>
&gt; Plate equivalents looking for differences.  My Paladin, Warrior, and SK<br/>
&gt; all maximize AC per slot resulting in the greatest protection.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Admittedly, I do prefer the look of Steel Plate, but I will sacrifice it<br/>
&gt; in favor of better equipment (higher AC/stat enhancers) if the advantage<br/>
&gt; is significant enough.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Aside from AC differences, appearance of armor matters only for personal<br/>
&gt; aethestics.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now put on the plate and try another few fights against similar mobs<br/>
&gt; &gt; (level and race).  You should notice fewer shots dealing maximum damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; against you, more shots doing low damage (2-10 where before it would<br/>
&gt; &gt; have been 40-60 on each connect), and less total damage at the end of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the fight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As is _very_ correct, given that you&#39;re wearing 33 AC more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You think you&#39;ve found some secret uber-combo (ala Tekken or something,<br/>
&gt; &gt; up-up-down-left-right left and right punch together to produce the<br/>
&gt; &gt; MegaFireball) or something; this game has shown no instances of such<br/>
&gt; &gt; imbalances.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Whoa... whoa... whoa... nice shooting Tex...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What ultra-secret combo am I trying to reveal?  I&#39;m just saying that<br/>
&gt; AC is the deciding factor in determining protection during melee combat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When did knowledge of the game you&#39;re playing become some cheat code?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Do you truly think they managed to get all the way through four phases<br/>
&gt; &gt; of beta and the past 4-6 months of final and never notice that plate, as<br/>
&gt; &gt; you are alledging, is useless?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Plate is _not_ useless.  It provides the most AC per piece available of<br/>
&gt; any armor that can be bought from standard NPC merchants.  Therefore it is<br/>
&gt; the best protection you can get without adventuring.  But that is _not_<br/>
&gt; because it is (insert angel choir here) Plate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thinking you&#39;ve found some hidden truth; that banded is marginally (5%<br/>
&gt; &gt; or less) effective than Plate but has a fraction of the weight ...<br/>
&gt; &gt; folly.  Sheer folly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *vast confusion*  Where, in any of my mail, have I stated that Banded is<br/>
&gt; equivalent to Plate?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Plate matters in a fight.  I&#39;ll take plate armored tanks over those in<br/>
&gt; &gt; banded seven days a week and the rest of the month too.  I have watched<br/>
&gt; &gt; the performance of Rangers (since they *can&#39;t* have better than banded)<br/>
&gt; &gt; higher than my level for months now; they&#39;re stuck in banded while I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; in plate, and I take less damage when tanking.  I&#39;ve watched warriors<br/>
&gt; &gt; who aren&#39;t plate armored yet, and I take less damage than they when<br/>
&gt; &gt; tanking. And I only have an 80 AGI, so it&#39;s not that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No... AC matters in a fight.  I would take a L30 Warrior in full Azure<br/>
&gt; over a L30 Warrior in full Steel Plate any day of the week.  Why?  Because<br/>
&gt; Azure has a higher AC per piece and therefore provides more protection<br/>
&gt; than Plate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW, Azure looks like Cloth armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But hey, whatever you want to do.  If you&#39;re in my group though, I won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; appreciate the higher percentage of the healers&#39; mana you&#39;ll be taking<br/>
&gt; &gt; to recover from the greater damage you&#39;ll be taking.  I suspect they<br/>
&gt; &gt; won&#39;t either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *grin* You won&#39;t have to &quot;not appreciate it&quot;, because I won&#39;t be taking<br/>
&gt; the damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; AC matters.  Style (appearance) matters.  Choose which one matters more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In a fight, I know which one I would choose.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope this helps,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
