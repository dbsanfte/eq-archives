<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-382754558">I have a shiny brass halberd and I am wondering when I might start seeing<br/>
max damage hits.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently level 16 with a strength of 85.  My max hit with the weapon<br/>
is only 29.<br/>
<br/>
As I understand the damage formula it is ([weapon damage]*2)+something<br/>
<br/>
That means I should have at least seen a hit for 32..the weapons damage<br/>
rating is 16.<br/>
