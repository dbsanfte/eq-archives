<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048228212">The place to get enchant silver is Neriak I beleive.  I also think that is<br/>
the only place to get the spell, so get a DE that you trust to go buy it for<br/>
him unless you or he is a DE of course.<br/>
<br/>
As far as making magical armro goes, I only know of bracers that can be made<br/>
at the moment.  And they have an AC of 0, but some other magical bonuses to<br/>
int and wiz i think...  Cant remember exactly.<br/>

&gt; This is not really a warrior question, but you guys might know<br/>
&gt; how to do it.<br/>
&gt;   I have an enchanter friend who would like to enchant ore in<br/>
&gt; order to make<br/>
&gt; magical armor.  We have looked forever trying to find the spell<br/>
&gt; to enchant<br/>
&gt; ore but can&#39;t.  I&#39;m sure you guys can understand the importance<br/>
&gt; of magical<br/>
&gt; armor.  Anyway we want to make it to sell cheap to other players.<br/>
&gt;  If anyone<br/>
&gt; has played around with this or knows anything about it please tell.<br/>
