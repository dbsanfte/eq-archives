Rogues have backstab  - no one else.  Bards have their songs, no one -else.<br/>
Warriors are basically damage takers, thats it.  Why even give them dual<br/>
wield if it doesn&#39;t help that much?<br/>

&gt; These are your problems:<br/>
&gt; - Don&#39;t solo as a warrior, the downtime is too long<br/>
&gt; - Stay with 1hd weapons, you got the dual wield skill for a reason<br/>

&gt; &gt; For reference. You may recall that I had started a ranger about 3 weeks<br/>
&gt; ago.  I have been playing with that character more than my warrior because<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; wanted to compare capabilities at the same level.  My ranger uses a 2<br/>
&gt; handed<br/>
&gt; dwarven axe (great weapon by the way, 14 damage 43 delay), and sometimes a<br/>
&gt; 1<br/>
&gt; handed dwarven axe.  He is at level 15.  I can solo any blue, many yellows<br/>
&gt; and i have even soloed a few red orc slavers.  In comparison my warrior,<br/>
&gt; level 16 is beaten to the point of 10 minute resting after a fight by most<br/>
&gt; blues. He runs from anything that is yellow or red.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In a group the ranger meets all the same party needs as a warrior plus<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; provides his own healing and buffing.  My 16th level warrior is about to<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; a fine steel 2 handed sword and work up his 2hs skill to a comparable<br/>
&gt; level<br/>
&gt; as the ranger.  We will see how that goes.<br/>
