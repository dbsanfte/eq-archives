<div id="ygrps-yiv-941560678">Where you planning on going after Cazic?  Where is a place tankers are<br/>
needed?  I see the people fighting the Sand Giants but I don&#39;t suspect that<br/>
tankers are needed.  Most of the people fighting it keep the sand giant<br/>
non-mobile or have pets that keep the thing busy while they wail on it with<br/>
magic.<br/>
<br/>
What is good place for us tankers to go 30+?  I personally am a troll shadow<br/>
knight, but play it mostly like a Warrior =P.  With my halberd, blackened<br/>
iron crown, blackened iron breastplate and banded I make a great tank.<br/>
Hopefully getting store plate soon . . . but anyway...  Since you are<br/>
bragging about your lvl (jk) =).  Where is a good place that tanks are<br/>
needed to lvl up<br/>
