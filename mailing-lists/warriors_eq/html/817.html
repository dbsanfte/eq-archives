&gt; If you&#39;re on Solusek, give me a tell. Frizzan is my name, one bub from<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm, I worked the night on-call shift this past week, and the cool<br/>
opportunity to play throughout the night around my work.  As such, I<br/>
spent the entire time working on getting a Tomahawk.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
following this discussion closely, and would like to comment.<br/>
<br/>
First however, I think this is my first post to this group, so<br/>
I&#39;d like to introduce myself.  I also play on Solusek Ro, under<br/>
the name Dalkin, an 18th lvl Barbarian Warrior.  I infrequently play<br/>
an Erudite Wizard named Fural, but he&#39;s still 5th?, maybe 4th.  Not<br/>
much anyhow :)<br/>
<br/>
I must have spent close to 24 hrs working on getting a Tomahawk.<br/>
One of the things that made the questing a little less annoying<br/>
was the fact that my attitude of sharing the spawn point with other<br/>
groups or individuals has made my character quite a few friends.<br/>
<br/>
For instance:  Last night, THREE times, in about 30 minutes, a<br/>
named Mucktail NPC spawned, which gave a shield.  After the first<br/>
two, a character asked if he could get the next shield bearer.<br/>
Since our group had recently acquired two, we agreed.  In the course<br/>
of fighting however, the third spawned and our group killed him.<br/>
I insisted, and eventually convinced the rest of our group, that<br/>
we broke OUR word to share, and we gave the guy the shield.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we gave up the chance to sell it or use it, but only by<br/>
demonstrating good play can we expect others to do so.  I guarantee<br/>
you that Elf will speak highly of me. :)<br/>
<br/>
So, I was one of those who camped for quite a while to get the<br/>
Tomahawk, and don&#39;t feel it improper.  I managed to get 3 levels<br/>
and 150+ PP in the course of my time, it&#39;s not like the only thing<br/>
good that came of my experience was the single weapon.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point, now that I&#39;m rambling :), is that if you actively<br/>
encourage others to share, and show them the benefits, you might be<br/>
much more likely to be shared with in the future.  I hear from<br/>
my guildmates that they are annoyed with so-and-so, some &quot;farmer&quot;<br/>
or whatnot.  I don&#39;t want a name like that for myself, so I don&#39;t<br/>
do it.<br/>
<br/>
And lastly, since I&#39;m intimately familiar with the crowd up in<br/>
Highpass these days :), I&#39;ve found most people are:<br/>
<br/>
a) working to get a few items for themselves of co-party members<br/>
b) amenable to sharing the spawn point if you are also<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and look me up online if you get a chance!<br/>
