<div id="ygrps-yiv-809362899">I have done Upper Guk at level 13.  If you have a strong group it is<br/>
possible...but beware of other parties of solo players.  Once you cross the<br/>
bridge you are in a &quot;hub&quot; room.  Fleeing creatures will run into a room<br/>
populated with Tuk warriors and Gaz warriors.  If you do not follow them<br/>
they will come back and sometimes bring these warriors out.  I&#39;ve died in<br/>
Upper Guk a few times due to the follies of others in the dungeon.  If a PC<br/>
or froglock blocks the bridge there is no escape from the trains. You will<br/>
die deeper inside than you would prefer.  The upside is that most froglocks<br/>
do not KOS until you killed a couple dozen and your faction with them is<br/>
bad.  So you can often walk right down and pick up your stuff.<br/>
<br/>
The most dangerous part is the water under the bridge.  Some of the trains<br/>
will occassionally drop Ton warriors and Gaz warriors into the water.  I<br/>
almost always see one or more there.  If you fall off the bridge into the<br/>
water you will very likely die unless you are a good swimmer.  I&#39;d advise<br/>
using a mage to draw anything out of the water and kill it before you start<br/>
hunting across the bridge.  And remember don&#39;t panic!  Falling in the water<br/>
is only a death sentence if you panic.  If you can&#39;t solo whatever is in<br/>
there just swim out and get to dry ground before you die.  It is much easier<br/>
to get to your corpse<br/>
 if it isn&#39;t in the water.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you see anything fleeing from the entrance over the bridge while<br/>
you are hunting on the otherside...kill it.  Doesn&#39;t matter if it is yours<br/>
or not, if you don&#39;t take the kill it may bring back a train.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm....looking back that all kind of rambles.  It will make more sense when<br/>
you actually get to Guk and look around.<br/>
