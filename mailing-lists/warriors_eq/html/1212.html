<b>Subject:</b> Looking for a guild list <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037205568">Like the message says, I am looking for a web site that lists guilds by server.<br/>
<br/>
Since I have been having trouble finding groups on my own, I would like to find a<br/>
guild to join. I figure this will allow me to find people who will want to group with<br/>
me because of my allegience.<br/>
<br/>
Or if any one has any good suggestions on guilds on E&#39;ci let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone,<br/>
Surtur</div>
