<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095106147">By the 21st level you can easily afoord a BloodClaw and he probably isn&#39;t twinked. It&#39;s really not hard to gain money you just can&#39;t gain experience then. Actually spellcasters have it bad well priests because of the expensiveness of there spells plus every once in awhile a good spellcaster weapon comes along like Observer Staff and you get it for 1000pp whil at level 24 your spells cost around 24pp a piece. If you can&#39;t afford a BloodClaw by level 21 you need to rethink your hunting grounds.</div>
