<b>Subject:</b> Selling:SHORT SWORD OF YKESHA <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-756631012">I&#39;m currently selling a Short Sword of Ykesha on eBay, and I knew that people who want this Incredible sword would want to see it! The sword is available on the Prexus server and I&#39;m able to deliver it almost anywhere! The bid ends on the 29th, and here is the address to the bid:<br/>

<br/>
Please come by and at least take a look if you are on the Prexus server! This sword is usable by Warriors and all races too. The sword does a random 75+ direct damaging spell, is found in the hardest creature in Lower Guk, and is the best 1hs weapon outside the planes. For any questions at all, contact me at:<br/>
