<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939555588">If anyone would make a true warrior only site, I would be willing to help by<br/>
submitting anything i have for knowledge and information.  I am a proud<br/>
warrior of the 40th season on the Quellious plane.  I have seen much, and<br/>
know many of the things young warriors can use to get started.  I havent<br/>
much time to devote to doing a site myself, but I can help with some<br/>
submitions.  Much of what was stated concerning best prices, best equipment<br/>
for the warriors level, and other such information as well as a true<br/>
&quot;handbook&quot; for the warrior would be a great assest to the warrior community.<br/>
I have looked through every class specific site i can find, and only one<br/>
warrior site have i seen.  Would be good to have a little competition to get<br/>
more information out to us all.<br/>

  Wow, this email list still lives!<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve got a question for you.  Do you use a site to see what items are<br/>
available?  Which one?  How could it be better?  Do you care about news on<br/>
an items site, or just the items?  Would it need quests listed for quest for<br/>
items, entirely, or just starting point?  List of Mob it comes from?<br/>
<br/>
  My reason for asking:  I&#39;m thinking about making one, and if I do, I want<br/>
it to be THE items site to go to.  I&#39;ve actually already got the database<br/>
designed, I just need to work on inputting info and designing the site<br/>
layout.  I could have a preview(not all items) up in 2 days or less if I get<br/>
enough response.<br/>

    I have a 30th level barbarian warrior on Veeshan. I can only tell you<br/>
what I&#39;ve chosen<br/>
    Max out 1hs, 2hs, taunt, kick, slam/bash  and I am working on archery<br/>
(this has helped me take down runners).<br/>
<br/>
    Some have said take up piercing. When you get duel attack and duel weild<br/>
only for the fact that a piercing weapon is faster and will help max these<br/>
skills out.<br/>
<br/>
    I find that 1hs with duel weild is more effective in certain<br/>
circumstances and then 2hs in another. 1hs gives you speed of attack. 2hs is<br/>
good for greatest impact (recently got a crit hit of 100.. now that was<br/>
sweet). If you use a 2hs or 1hs will also depend on your group make up. I do<br/>
carry all my weapons with me so at times will switch depending on the<br/>
circumstance.<br/>
<br/>
    All my reading and such have said to keep both maxed out. Some reasons<br/>
are the performance of the weapon others for the variety of weapons you can<br/>
use. I didn&#39;t work on my 2hs until I was at the 28th level and it was very<br/>
painful to max it out.<br/>
<br/>
    Good luck!<br/>
