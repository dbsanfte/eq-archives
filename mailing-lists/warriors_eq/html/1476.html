<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193516948">Ok i must correct u on this one. the mob that drops the demon claws is the <br/>
Avatar of Fear in cazic thule dungeon...he drops the Bladed Thulian Claws ( <br/>
formerly known as demon claws) and the much prized Rubicite breast <br/>
plate...with the effect of rubicite aura...which dbl&#39;s your regen <br/>
rate....both sitting and standing...Avatar is exactly lvl 38....and he hits <br/>
as hard as 102....which is harder than a SG...( that part u are correct on) <br/>
and he is very fast....but he has one weakness....He can easily be nuked <br/>
with DD spells and if u keep him turning he will hit for less dmg and less <br/>
often....<br/>
just watch out for the Lizard Cenobite which is his right hand lizard and <br/>
the cenobite doesn&#39;t play either he is lvl 36mob...<br/>

&gt;I wouldnt start heading to Solusek A until around 25 and up.  Maybe even<br/>
&gt;higher. I didnt go anyway there until level 30.  Solusek B is much more<br/>
&gt;dangerous.  I just set foot inside at level 30 and the first thing I saw <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;red.  May have been bad luck to see a powerful Goblin right off the bat, or<br/>
&gt;maybe that is the way the whole place is.  Do not know, I didnt go any<br/>
&gt;farther.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As for the demon claw.  You should (I would think) depending on the server<br/>
&gt;your on, and how many high level characters are on the server be able to<br/>
&gt;pick on up for around 200 - 300 plat.  The shouldnt be for trade only <br/>
&gt;items,<br/>
&gt;and they can be obtained around level 32 on your own with a group.  Though<br/>
&gt;you DEFINITELY better have 2 clerics and someone at least around level 35.<br/>
&gt;The mob is a level 35 SK and has a 800point harm touch from what I have<br/>
&gt;heard.  He never got me with the touch.  He also smacks ya around a little<br/>
&gt;harder and alot faster than a Sand Giant.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as weapons are concerned.  Try to get<br/>

&gt; &gt; What are Demon Claws usually seen going for, or are<br/>
&gt; &gt; they also in the -trade only- area (which I hate)?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Another good money pit is solusek a.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What levels can start working SolusekA, and when can<br/>
&gt; &gt; they reasonably expect to switch into SolusekB?<br/>
