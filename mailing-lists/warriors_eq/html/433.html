<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802732030">Human Warriors require less experience to advance levels than any other<br/>
class race combination.  You can&#39;t see JACK in the dark and none of your stats<br/>
are particularly great but then if you grouped with an ogre warrior from first<br/>
fight through till you hit level 30 he would probably still be on level 25 or<br/>
so.  its a BIG deal at higher levels.<br/>

&gt; HI.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if anyone know what class is the fastest to advance levels<br/>
&gt; in.<br/>
&gt; I know erudites for example get less xp then other races.<br/>
&gt; How about darkelves? they get more or less xp?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And also, does the god you worship affect xp?<br/>
&gt; I know it affects the overall diff, on the game but does it affect xp?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Would be logical that if you decide to worship the prince of hate, wich will<br/>
&gt; increase the game diff alot, you should get more xp, is this how it works?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know some of you dont want this info...so if anyone knows the answer,<br/>
&gt; tag the mail with spoiler hehe<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thanx<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Vashi<br/>
