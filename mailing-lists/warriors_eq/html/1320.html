<br/>
	The final recommendation from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> (128 members) is two <br/>
enhancements for the warrior class:<br/>
<br/>
	1) Increase the cap on combat abilities (1H slashing, 2H slashing, dodge, <br/>
parry, riposte, dual wield, double attack) from 200 to 255.<br/>
<br/>
	2) Allow weapon skill specialization along the same lines as magic users.  <br/>
This would allow a warrior to specialize in one type of weapon for reduced <br/>
delay and increased damage.<br/>

large number of people with the same suggested improvements they may just <br/>
make it happen.<br/>
