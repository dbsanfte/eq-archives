<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957011999">LOL same here, im sad arent I?<br/>
<br/>
What makes it worse is, basically, my pass times ARE games. Im a hard-core<br/>
game player have been ever since 1987.  <br/>
<br/>
What makes it EVEN worse is my fiancï¿½ encourages me to play, she likes to<br/>
watch and when not watching or im asleep she actually plays my character.  I<br/>
suggested that she should get an account and we could play together she said<br/>
no for two reasons, EQ is addictive and she wont get any work done if she<br/>
gets into it, and she prefers to play my high level character in relatively<br/>
safe zones where she is effectively a goddess and the whole zone couldn&#39;t<br/>
kill her :)<br/>
<br/>
I actually had to start going to the gym again (after a 3 year break) and<br/>
bike riding JUST so I get out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
How many other &quot;hard core&quot; game players are there?<br/>
<br/>
Whats worse is that I will  be moving to the USA within the next year and<br/>
have even MORE access to games and betas - sigh. <br/>
