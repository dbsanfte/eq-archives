&gt;You ignore the main difference between the two, one can only strike<br/>

&gt;and yes, I have a very good clue about game balance.  Right now, it is out<br/>
&gt;of balance, otherwise we would have warriors being able to solo just as<br/>
&gt;easily as Mages, Necros, Rangers and the like.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And you still don&#39;t understand.  EQ was not designed for solo play.<br/>
Eventually every class will have to group to be effective.  Some classes<br/>
like the warrior end up not being able to solo at an earlier level.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t argue for enhanced solo capabilities.  Brad wanted a game where people<br/>
benefited from working together.  He wanted to make solo play hard, if not<br/>
impossible, especially at higher levels.<br/>
