<b>Subject:</b> Warriors vs Hybrids <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-506788973">Lets compare the Warrior vs the Hybrid classes (Paladin, Ranger, and<br/>
Shadowknight)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How a Warrior should be better than the hybrids:<br/>
<br/>
- Warriors should have a small percentage more hp&#39;s that the hybrids.  But<br/>
hp&#39;s should be a primary result of race and stamina.  A Wood Elf or Dark Elf<br/>
Warrior should have LESS hp&#39;s than a Dwarven Paladin.<br/>
<br/>
- Warriors should have a slight melee advantage over hybrids.  Apparently<br/>
this isn&#39;t so.<br/>
<br/>
- Warriors should have one combat skill that is not obtainable by the<br/>
hybrids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How did Verant try to balance the Warrior but failed:<br/>
<br/>
- They gave hybrids an EXP penalty.  In theory this should have worked.  If<br/>
you play a Warrior and a Paladin each for 100 hours, then the Warrior will<br/>
be at a higher level than the Paladin and therefore more powerful.  This<br/>
does work, but most people don&#39;t understand or don&#39;t care.  Plus there are<br/>
too many level-based restrictions like who you can group with, what monsters<br/>
give you experience.<br/>
<br/>
- Warriors get combat skills at a lower level than hybrids.  This does give<br/>
Warriors a combat advantage when they have the skill and the hybrids don&#39;t.<br/>
At levels 1-4, a warrior can kick, while no other hybrid can.  At levels<br/>
13-16 Warriors can dual wield while no other hybrid can.  At levels 15-19,<br/>
Warriors can double attack, while no other hybrid can.  The same goes for<br/>
Parry from 10-16.  These earlier skills do give Warriors a combat advantage.<br/>
But at level 20, the hybrids catch up with the Warrior in the skills<br/>
department.  At higher levels, the Warrior has no skill advantage over the<br/>
hybrids.<br/>
<br/>
- Warriors have access to the best melee races - Trolls, Ogres, and<br/>
Barbarians.  The stat bonuses these races have give the Warrior a<br/>
significant advantage over weaker races.  But the two evil races, Ogres and<br/>
Trolls, have significant penalties that cancel out their stat bonus.<br/>
Barbarians are a good choice, but some people can&#39;t deal without night<br/>
vision.  But the better race selection does nothing to those who choose to<br/>
play a dark elf or wood elf, who probably made a poor race choice for a<br/>
warrior.<br/>
<br/>
- Berzerker Frenzy.  Not something to depend on.  Most of the time we want<br/>
to be healed before we get down to the Frenzy level.<br/>
<br/>
- Verant also screwed up by giving Rangers both dual wield and double<br/>
attack.  Only Warriors should get both skills  (I&#39;m not considering Rogues<br/>
here, only hybrids).  It was good that Paladins and SKs didn&#39;t get<br/>
dual-wield.  Rangers getting both skills was a mistake IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
- Higher Skill Cap.  It was always rumored that Warriors didn&#39;t have a skill<br/>
cap on their combat skills.  This lead many of us to believe that a high<br/>
level Warrior would have a decent combat advantage over the hybrids.<br/>
Apparently this rumor is false, and we have the same combat cap.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What can be done to fix Warriors:<br/>
<br/>
- Warriors should have a higher skill cap, either lvl *6 +5 or lvl *5 +10<br/>
instead of the hybrid lvl *5 +5 cap.  Warriors should also not be capped at<br/>
200 like the hybrids.<br/>
<br/>
- Give Warriors a warrior-only skill.  The Monk has several special moves.<br/>
Give the Warrior something to use that is a little better than Kick or Bash.<br/>
<br/>
- Give Warriors a once-per-day skill.  We need a Berserk or Battle Cry skill<br/>
that would give us a significant short-duration combat boost.  It shouldn&#39;t<br/>
be based on how low our hp&#39;s are, but instead usable when we want.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What should not be done:<br/>
<br/>
- Warriors don&#39;t need anything that makes soloing easier.  If anything, the<br/>
ability of other classes to solo should be reduced.  EQ is a group oriented<br/>
game and should remain that way.  If you want to play solo, Might & Magic 7<br/>
was just released.<br/>
<br/>
- Warriors don&#39;t need any magic.  We shouldn&#39;t have spells that make us heal<br/>
or gate or anything.  Warriors are as far away from spellcasters as<br/>
possible.  If you want the ability to cast spells, play a hybrid.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do we get these changes:<br/>
<br/>
- Don&#39;t ask for things totally ridiculous.  When people ask for huge<br/>
unbalancing changes, it makes them look like they haven&#39;t thought it out<br/>
very carefully.  Verant is much more likely to pay attention to our<br/>
suggestions if they are well thought out AND reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
- Once we come up with a reasonable set of changes, get as many Warriors<br/>
behind it as we can.  Currently we have 100 people asking for 100 different<br/>
changes ranging from critical hits to healing to gating to wizard-like<br/>
damage.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Warriors only need a few small changes to become the dominate melee class<br/>
they should be.  There is an excellent article here<br/>
