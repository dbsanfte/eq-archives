thing almost makes me wish +PVP was the required<br/>
setting (almost, but not quite; because reality in<br/>
other games proves people will just use PC Killing as<br/>
a source of amusement and bullying, and not a serious<br/>
in-game mechanism).<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem with someone camping to obtain an<br/>
item.  Key word here, *one*.  They show up, wait their<br/>
turn, get their item, move on.  In this fashion, it&#39;s<br/>
like an amusement park ride, everyone takes a turn.<br/>
<br/>
Camping to get multiples is just lame.  Very, very,<br/>
very, very lame.  It takes away the fun in a very<br/>
serious way.  I can&#39;t compete for the commonly<br/>
mentioned items because the hard-core &#39;see if I let<br/>
you get one before I and my friends kill-steal it away<br/>
from you while we laugh&#39; groups are determined to set<br/>
up and hold the spot.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m probably going to have to pay plat for items I&#39;d<br/>
like my character to have, which really takes a lot of<br/>
the fun out of it.  A lot of the fun.  It would be<br/>
*fun* to go adventuring, fight through the dungeon,<br/>
find the spot/npc everyone rumors as the source of a<br/>
mighty item, and then defeat him/her/it in battle for<br/>
a great reward.  That would be *fun*.  But strolling<br/>
through the dungeon that people are keeping cleared,<br/>
finding a huge crowd anxiously waiting for the npc to<br/>
arrive; that&#39;s *not fun*.  Especially when they&#39;re<br/>
rude and irritated that I dare have the nerve to want<br/>
to come and get an item for myself, which is what the<br/>
response almost always is.<br/>
<br/>
Worse, it&#39;s certainly not fun to buy it.  I probably<br/>
will, but it&#39;s not going to be the same at all.  Not<br/>
at all.<br/>
<br/>
One of two things needs to happen; Uber monster spawns<br/>
need to be instituted (like SGs in NRo and Oasis, or<br/>
the Mino Hero in Steamfont) that will make farmers pay<br/>
with XP and blood for their patches, or hard coded<br/>
&#39;lore&#39; item limits.  And if this makes it hard to get<br/>
a paired set of PG Tomahawks, tough.  We tried it the<br/>
nice way, and it&#39;s not working; so you&#39;ll just have to<br/>
use one PGT and one of something else.<br/>
