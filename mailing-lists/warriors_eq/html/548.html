<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031566210">Rangers are the only half breed that I&#39;m even close to being impressed with.<br/>
<br/>
SK blow, their offensive spells are so far behind that they are almost pointless, they don&#39;t have the melee ability of a true warrior either, the ONLY thing they have going for them is the occasional harm touch, which they never seem to have when needed.  <br/>
<br/>
Paladin.....they ARE a joke, their healing ability is a joke, their buffing ability is a joke, because their heals and buffs are 9 levels behind, the only thing they have going for them is their lay hands, which can be very good, but I dont&#39; think it makes up for their lack of melee ability.<br/>
<br/>
Rangers on the other hand, well, they get some OK buffs, nothing great, their thorn series of spells is good for a tank, their heals are a joke tho, was fighting with one last night, he was close to 30th lvl, and his heal was doing 25 points.....with close to 1000 hp, a 25 point heal??   but they do get dual wield, and kick, which no other half breed get, and of couse double attack.  As a wood elf, you get hide, forage, and tracking which are 3 very nice skills to have<br/>
<br/>
If I were going to play a half breed it would be ranger.  But no class can match the raw tanking ability of a true warrior.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This past week I decided to take a break from my level 15 dark elf warrior.  I was abit frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
I started a half-elf warrior in Kelethin.  It is insanely easy to play there.  I made level 5 in about 3.5 hours.  Then I stopped and tried a wood elf ranger.  Has anyone else played a ranger?  I imagine it is the most poorly balanced of all the hybrids.  After 4 hours I reached level 5 and got kick.  I am now 12-18 hours into the character and almost level 9.  I am just as capable as an equivalent warrior.  Next level I gain an array of spells which will boost my combat effectiveness and allow me to heal.  Part of the easy success is the plethora of low level orcs available a stone&#39;s throw from Kelethin.  With my tracking ability I am never at a loss for targets and I can engage blue con orcs in rapid succession or even 2 at a time. I can even engage and successfully beat yellow con orcs more than 50% of the time and almost always can kill orcs that con even to me without trouble. So far it seems that I get as many hit points now as my warrior did.<br/>
<br/>
My point is, with a ranger class as powerful a combatant as it is I see little necessity for the pure warrior.  I am going to play through to level 15 I think, just to see a more even comparison.  My concern is only from a game mechanics perspective though as I have no doubt my playing as a dark elf was a much more rewarding experience.  Has anyone else noticed that the warrior just is not different enough from the hybrid fighter classes?<br/>
