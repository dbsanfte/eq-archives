<br/>
I really have to agree with you here, places that were formerly void of<br/>
players...and i mean like 1-5 other players in the zone are now abundant<br/>
with would be campers. Lets look at lake rather, with lothaniel i could go<br/>
there with a group and be the ONLY plyers in that zone, it was great, now<br/>
when i go there with my cleric, there are at least 15 people in the zone. Ok<br/>
15 people isnt that much but they are usually cmping out where all the good<br/>
stuff is. I suppose thise thing is bound to happen, i mean everyone is<br/>
gaining levels and there are only so many areas to hunt in right? Well im<br/>
fine with that not much can be done, ill just go to solusek where its barren<br/>
and test my luck out there. Heck id rather have a little more people in the<br/>
dungeon to help me if i needed it ! hehe.<br/>
