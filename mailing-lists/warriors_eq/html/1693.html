<b>Subject:</b> RE: [warriors_eq] Re: What zones got exp increase? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-162592409">John Pool asked:<br/>
	&quot;I never did find a list of the zone that got exp. increase. Anyone <br/>
	know what the are?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Zone Experience <br/>
<br/>
As of the next patch, you will receive additional experience (per kill) in<br/>
the following zones: <br/>
<br/>
*	Droga increased by 12% <br/>
*	Nurga increased by 12% <br/>
*	Solusek&#39;s Eye (Sol A) increased by 13% <br/>
*	Najena increased by 13% <br/>
*	Befallen increased by 13% <br/>
*	Paw increased by 13% <br/>
*	Permafrost increased by 13% <br/>
*	Kaesora increased by 18% <br/>
*	Qeynos Catacombs increased by 20% <br/>
*	Runnyeye increased by 20% <br/>
*	Kerra Ridge increased by 20% <br/>
*	The Hole increased by 25% <br/>
<br/>
Grouping Bonus <br/>
<br/>
Following the next patch, the group bonus will be as follows: <br/>
<br/>
*	2 person group - 2% total bonus. <br/>
*	3 person group - 6% total bonus. <br/>
*	4 person group - 10% total bonus. <br/>
*	5 person group - 14% total bonus. <br/>
*	6 person group - 20% total bonus. <br/>
<br/>
This bonus is applied to the total experience reward for killing a creature<br/>
prior to distributing it to the group. <br/>
<br/>
Many people have pointed out that when killing in a group you get less<br/>
experience per kill. This is of course true, but what is often missed is<br/>
that you can kill many more creatures, and creatures of a higher level when<br/>
in that group. For instance, a good two-person group should be able to kill<br/>
things of a higher level over twice as fast as a solo person should. Now,<br/>
we&#39;re going to give them even more of a bonus for doing so, and make it<br/>
easier for people to find pickup groups on the basis of getting higher<br/>
scaled bonus. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, we very well may decide to revamp and/or readjust NPC populations<br/>
and/or experience multipliers in the future in order to ensure that groups<br/>
adventuring there find them worthwhile. <br/>
<br/>
Experience Penalties <br/>
<br/>
Effectively class based experience penalties will be removed, although race<br/>
penalties will remain. <br/>
<br/>
Summary <br/>
<br/>
*	The changes that we are making in the next patch should have a<br/>
profound impact upon the game: <br/>
*	Classes no longer have a true class-based experience penalty, making<br/>
it easier for people to play the class that they want to play, rather than<br/>
the class that they feel compelled to play due to faster advancement. <br/>
*	Race based penalties are no longer shared with the group, and in<br/>
truth are not severe enough to greatly impact the advancement speed of any<br/>
particular race. Even the race with the worst penalty will level no slower<br/>
than a human monk does now, and in truth will level faster due to the other<br/>
changes that went in. <br/>
*	The grouping bonus increase, in addition to the other changes, makes<br/>
grouping much more efficient, without reducing the current efficiency of<br/>
soloing for those who prefer that route. <br/>
*	Experience modifiers turned up in the other zones should encourage<br/>
people to spread out, have more fun, and allow those staying behind in other<br/>
areas to have more fun themselves since the area is less crowded. <br/>
*	All players, assuming that they have an experience penalty, or ever<br/>
group with anyone who does, will level faster. <br/>
