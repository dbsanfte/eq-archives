<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571633376">Wouldnt surprise me if monsters have faction standings amongst eachother.<br/>
Sounds logical<br/>
But the weirdest fight I ever saw. faction or not, and they wernt charmed. <br/>
Was a fight between the 2 priest brothers near the zone border in karanas. <br/>
on of them has a realy nice necklace too that gives CHA +10 I belive, I know <br/>
I got a faction hit from it but I dested that character after and I dont <br/>
know how bad it was. Does anyone know? the funny thing is that the necklace <br/>
is a LORE item so I guess it is part of some quest too<br/>
<br/>
Anyone got any leads on this?<br/>

&gt;Well I have seen other monsters fighting monsters but only when<br/>
&gt;someone has charmed them (probably what happened with the<br/>
&gt;grizzly fighting the hill giant,  and the lions attack anything that<br/>
&gt;is bi-pedal :)  ).   This was beyond unpredictable.  Ghanex just<br/>
&gt;stands there and summons his pets.  I never seen a pet turn<br/>
&gt;on its owner before.<br/>

&gt; &gt; In regards to Ghanex&#39;s zombies attacking him....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You have to remember the AI that they have on these things. Who knows?<br/>
&gt; &gt; They<br/>
&gt; &gt; could have broken the spell that entraped them, or they could just have<br/>
&gt; &gt; gotten pissed off at him. I see monsters fighting monsters all the time. <br/>
&gt;A<br/>
&gt; &gt; griz was fighting a hill giant the other day in W. Karana, and in the <br/>
&gt;same<br/>
&gt; &gt; day I saw a lion take out one of the two farmers. All I&#39;m saying is, <br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt; &gt; made the monsters AI very unpredictable, and that is the result.<br/>
