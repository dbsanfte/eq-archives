<div id="ygrps-yiv-461907870">THANK GOD, I think pulling monsters is lame...if you can&#39;t fight in the<br/>
area, then you shouldn&#39;t be there....which in turn will help promote group<br/>
play, rather than having a high level puller fetch a single monster at a<br/>
time.<br/>

&gt; They seem to have made the Tentacle Terrors way more aggressive<br/>
&gt; and stronger<br/>
&gt; as well.  I am level 21 and they are blue to white to me.  My friend, a<br/>
&gt; level 30 ranger was helping me raise my 2handed skill (I just got a BBC)<br/>
&gt; with the TT.  He would draw them out (they are green to him) and take all<br/>
&gt; the blows.  They would consistently reduce him to one bubble and myself to<br/>
&gt; half my hit points.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The day before they were a piece of cake, now there killing machines.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They seem to have changed the linking also with the bonecracker.<br/>
&gt; It used to<br/>
&gt; be you could pull the BC and the two necros would not come (as<br/>
&gt; long as they<br/>
&gt; were green to the puller).  Now they all come no matter what.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; AND finally blind spell pulling no longer works either.  If you target a<br/>
&gt; mob, then run to another room (i.e. the mob cant see you) you could cast a<br/>
&gt; spell and the mob would come running.  This no longer works.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just thought I would share that with you all.<br/>
