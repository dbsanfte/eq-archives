&gt;  &gt; playing&quot; a female the first step towards role playing a real life female?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah so according to you any guy that plays a female character is either gay or <br/>
a transvestite?  I guess you really can&#39;t fight ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
There are quite a few reasons to play a female character, although admittedly <br/>
they are all matters of taste.  First off, many of the female figures look <br/>
much better than the male ones (I say that partly because I&#39;m a guy who likes <br/>
the look of a woman).  Secondly, who&#39;s to say that females can&#39;t be just as <br/>
much an action/adventure hero as much as a male?  Myself and several friends <br/>
of mine all have female characters in our rosters because sometimes one gets <br/>
tired of running all male characters all the time.  Female characters should <br/>
have the chance to represent just like anybody else.  Thirdly, the decision <br/>
to play a female is no different from any other character generation choice.  <br/>
Why did you decide to play that dark elf, or human, or barbarian?  Why did <br/>
you decide to play that warrior, or enchanter, or shadowknight?  Because you <br/>
thought you&#39;d try something new, right?  Does playing a wizard mean that you, <br/>
in real life, practice magic spells?  Of course not.  Does playing an orge <br/>
mean, in real life, you wish you were an 8-foot tall ugly and monsterous <br/>
humanoid?  I certainly hope not.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  &gt; I know there are a lot of legitimate female players, but I&#39;d bet a large<br/>
&gt;  &gt; sum of money that most of the female characters are being driven by<br/>
&gt;  &gt; guys.....call me homophobic if you will, but I think its weird.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well of course!  Duh!  I bet that most of the players in Norrath are male, <br/>
period, regardless of what they play!  In general, computer games and <br/>
role-playing games have much more of a draw for men than they do for women.  <br/>
Ever go to a game store with open space for gaming?  How many women do you <br/>
see hanging out compared to the guys?<br/>
<br/>
Finally, be aware that I&#39;m not attempting to change your opinion.  You play <br/>
what you like to play and that&#39;s great.  I just think you should be more <br/>
open-minded and relax.  It is just a game, after all.</div>
