<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158263577"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Personally, i feel that warriors should have a sleeping ability, but not to <br/>
&gt;the extent that all goes black.  It should be just like medditate,  exit <br/>
&gt;when you want, and you can still type, just you can&#39;t see what is going on. <br/>
&gt;  So, a mediate for warriors is the one thing that will help a lot, well <br/>
&gt;thats what i think.  It just takes me too long to get back all that <br/>
&gt;health...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please forget about that sleep skill. There&#39;s no point in it. Why would <br/>
sleep be warrior only skill? Why would you be able to chat while sleeping? <br/>
The downtime is here for a reason, when you want to cut it down, team with <br/>
priests classes.<br/>
