<div id="ygrps-yiv-750011616">NPCs on the major ports are indifferent to all classes all races, island ports, on the other hand, the NPCs there play by the faction rules, but won&#39;t get on the boat unless provoked.<br/>
<br/>
So from commons or ro, zone into freeport, look around, you&#39;ll find an entrace into the underground.  Find your way thru the underground, there are even some guilds and various other vendors that will buy/sell/train evil types.  One of the passages will lead to water, from there you can swim to the dock.  You will run across a couple different NPCs once you make it to the water, CON them and watch out for the wondering guard that comes close to the dock.  You will be safe once you get to the end of the dock.....then enjoy the wait.  Get on the boat.....then enjoy the wait.  Once you get to Butcher Block you will need to jump off the dock and swim around the wall, either side.  Whala, you are in Butcher Block.  Getting thru BB is easy since the guards don&#39;t move around.  Beware Greater Feydark, guards walk all over the place.  I don&#39;t know about gnome land, never been there.  To get back, walk backwards :)<br/>
On a related note, the only place to be bound safely is in Greater Feydark, preferably REAL close to one of the zone lines.<br/>

In actuality I am curious myself.  I have raised my faction sufficiently<br/>
that I can wander around Freeport, right up until I ran across an NPC high<br/>
elf by the name of Lady Faye.   She was blue to me so I wasn&#39;t afraid of<br/>
dying, I just zoned out of Freeport because I was afraid guards would jump<br/>
in.  Moral of the story is that elves KOS dark elves.  Since Feydwer is the<br/>
elvish home, it will be problematic at best.  Are dark elves KOS to dwarves?<br/>
I think it is the dwarven city that the docks are at.  I am very interested<br/>
in touring crushbone because I believe dark elves are not KOS by those orcs.<br/>

&gt;I have a Dark Elf Shadow Knight in Neriak and am interested in traveling to<br/>
&gt;Feydwer.  How do I get him there without getting killed by guards?<br/>
