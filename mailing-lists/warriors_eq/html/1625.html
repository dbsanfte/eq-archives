<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585416570">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
My wonderful warrior has been camped for a very long time now (my bard took<br/>
over!) but I guess I am still on the list here ;p<br/>
<br/>
Here is a clip from the Bards FAQ - we use hot keys and swap weps A LOT!<br/>
<br/>
Q: What are &quot;Hotkeys&quot; and how do I create them?<br/>
A: You&#39;ll notice that in the lower left side of the screen you have 6 empty<br/>
boxes with the number &quot;1&quot; and two arrows above it.  This is the &quot;hotkey&quot;<br/>
box.  Initially, hotkeys default to the numbers 1-6 on your keyboard, but<br/>
you can reconfigure that through the options settings.  Songs, spells, the<br/>
spellbook, socials, and inventory boxes can all be made &quot;hotkeys&quot;. To create<br/>
a &quot;hotkey&quot;, LEFT click on the box/spell/icon you want and HOLD it down.<br/>
After a second, the box will magically &quot;lift up&quot; and attach itself to your<br/>
pointer.  Simply &quot;drop&quot; the new box onto the appropriate hotkey slot, and<br/>
blammo! Instant hotkey.  Now, whenever you press the associated hotkey<br/>
button, you will activate the song/spell or action in that slot.  Inventory<br/>
boxes do NOT &quot;activate&quot;, putting them in your hotkey bank is simply to avoid<br/>
having to open your inventory to swap items in combat.<br/>
Q: Why would I want to swap items in combat?!<br/>
A: Well, not just in combat, but by placing inventory slots (General<br/>
inventory slots, or worn/wielded slots will work.  Bag slots will NOT) into<br/>
your hotkey bank, you can grab (for example) your sword and swap it with an<br/>
instrument in order to heal faster, run faster or whatever.  PRACTICE THIS<br/>
MANEUVER!!!  You *WILL* drop your weapon or instrument at least once, and<br/>
more likely several times, so practice practice practice!  And if you *do*<br/>
accidentally drop something, don&#39;t panic, just back up, grab the item and<br/>
run like crazy.<br/>
<br/>
Let me try to add - what you want on a hot key palette - you have 6 that you<br/>
can select by shift-1, shift-2, etc. - is your weapon slots 1 and 2 and 2<br/>
main inventory slots.  To get them there, bag your weps, open inventory so<br/>
you can see main slots, right click and hold on an empty main slot - it<br/>
should &quot;pop loose&quot; so you have it on your cursor.  Key shift-1 to bring up<br/>
your hot key pallette and drop the inv slot onto the place on the pallette<br/>
where you want it.  Do this for 3 main inv slots and your melee wep 1 and<br/>
melee wep 2 slots.  So you should have:<br/>
<br/>
[inv slot1]   [melee 1]<br/>
[inv slot 2]  [melee 2]<br/>
[inv slot 3]  [            ]<br/>
[              ]  [            ]<br/>
[              ]  [            ]<br/>
<br/>
Now you can put weps in your slots: 2hs in melee1, 1hs in inv 1, 1hb in inv<br/>
2. To switch, click on 2hs - click on 1hs - click on melee1 - click on 1hb -<br/>
click on melee 2.  And you can figure out how to reverse process.  TIP: look<br/>
at the mouse pointer - not the wep - place tip of mouse pointer in center of<br/>
boxes before clicking.  Practice with some rustys or some fs crap weps<br/>
before swapping your BIBS, Yaks and Waks ;p<br/>

		You can make a hotkey out of just about anything.<br/>
<br/>
		You can not make a hot key out of a weapon, but you can make<br/>
a hot key out<br/>
		of a backpack slot.  You must then, always keep your weapons<br/>
in this<br/>
		specific slot.  I had my first experiment with this using a<br/>
bard character a<br/>
		few days back.  hotkeyed a backpack slot and my Melee1 and<br/>
Melee2 slots.<br/>
		It&#39;s works pretty well.  Sometimes looting can cause a minor<br/>
problem though.<br/>
		Most of the time it&#39;s OK though.  These don&#39;t act like<br/>
regular hot keys,<br/>
		where you can just click 3 or 4 to make them work.  They act<br/>
like inventory<br/>
		slots.  You click on a weapon to pick it up, and then drop<br/>
it in one of your<br/>
		other &quot;Hot Slots&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
		Hope this helps.  If someone has an even better way that I<br/>
overlooked I&#39;m<br/>
		all ears.<br/>
