<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942932752">I asked the same question, theres no really good Warrior only swords.  Im<br/>
not an axe type of person so I wont be using any kind of axe (with the<br/>
exception of exec if I get it, ever).<br/>
<br/>
I dont think they should introduce a katana unless its in context.  i.e.<br/>
theres a Japanese/Asian style race in the game, and they make them.  I hated<br/>
how in UO they had katanas in a European setting with no explanation why<br/>
they existed.  Maybe they could make the Lizard Men in the expansion Asiatic<br/>
and that place would be a good source for Asian weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Id love to have Jaade make a harrowing trip to the Continent of the<br/>
lizardman just so she can get a katana and a wakazashi.<br/>
<br/>
O.K. you know what you have to do, start a petition AND hit /feedback.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the clarification there, so does kith have any meaning/context?<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;Wasn&#39;t the kith also the name of the Dark Force in starwars? I remember<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;being mentioned in Empire??  Its a nice sounding name.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nopers...it&#39;s the SITH. Those are the term for Jedi who use the Dark Side.<br/>
&gt; Just thought I&#39;d help ya out there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Ok, now my question. Is there a SWORD that is relatively as good as<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; Tommy? (Polished Granite Tomahawk)....I know I may be being traditional in<br/>
&gt; the RP sense, but it seems like the best weapons for warriors are axes,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; I usually think of them as having swords. And now that I am on the<br/>
&gt; subject,<br/>
&gt; why not a Katana? IMHO those are the fastest most damaging weapons IRL (my<br/>
&gt; opinion is based on my knowledge of Kinjitsu). I really don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; waste<br/>
&gt; my time suggesting it because, like some other people, I am a &quot;hard-core<br/>
&gt; gamer&quot; and played in and/or tested a lot of online games and I know that<br/>
&gt; suggestions are very rarely taken into context. Maybe if everyone came up<br/>
&gt; with some good ideas and we all signed them like a petition and sent it<br/>
&gt; in,<br/>
&gt; then they might listen? Well, that is my idea. I want a Katana. Maybe two.<br/>
&gt; Anyone want to see anything else in the game?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tyveris,<br/>
&gt; Aspiring Samauri<br/>
&gt; (with no Katana)<br/>
