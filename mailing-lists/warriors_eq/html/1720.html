  <div><tt>Wow THE Kailyn?&nbsp; The same fellow from the old eq.stratics 
  board?&nbsp; The<br>guy who discovered the STA/HP formula &amp; the Agi/AC 
  formulas? If so its<br>darn good to hear from you again.&nbsp; I learned alot 
  of what I needed to<br>know about warrioring from that 
board.</tt></div></blockquote>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Erm... Never thought of myself as THE Kailyn, but 
yeah its me. I did do the AC/Agi and Stm/HP though, I had help, especially with 
the second. I got lucky and someone else saw the pattern in the data and I am 
the one who got the credit. And if you ever catch Kailyn on Povar, she is a 
woman.</font></div>

  <div><tt>I indeed was part of the great warrior sitout (I think the 
  first<br>sitout). I remember Fitty, Ruatha &amp; all the other Stratics guys 
  egging<br>all the warriors on to particpate (things really were hard on 
  early<br>warriors).&nbsp;&nbsp; I was laughing when over your story about 
  bronze...I myself<br>did not get full bronze until lvl 24 (?) if I remember 
  right.&nbsp; Heck I<br>used dual Mino Axes until lvl 18 (then had to get a 
  combine long sword<br>to kill undead in Unrest).</tt></div></blockquote>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Yeah that was the first sit out. I was not over at 
Stratics yet.&nbsp;I was on one of the other baords. I can&#39;t remember the name 
of but they are dead (atleast to me) due to really bad software. I jumped over 
to Stratics well after that. I actaully have a piercing skill because a friend 
of mine got me a pair of Crys Knives (4/20???) magic for Unrest. I was &quot;Ruatha&quot; 
swapping them with my Mino axes when fighting magical mobs. Ahh the good old 
days. </font></div>

  <div><tt>BTW another great warrior weapon to add to the &quot;uber&quot; list you 
  mentioned<br>is the bloodpoint 10/21 procs an 80 pt hp txf &amp; is not lore 
  (drops in<br>Howling Stones).&nbsp; I have 1 of these at the moment &amp; with 
  werwolf form<br>see 8-9 procs a fight.&nbsp; My goal in life (other than get 
  to lvl 56 &amp;<br>riposte) is to obtain another.</tt></div></blockquote>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Actually it was more of my point that weapons have 
gone completely insane in the upgrades to the game. I mean 9/25 was a good 
weapon when I got my whip from Hate. Now it is so much garbage...</font></div>
