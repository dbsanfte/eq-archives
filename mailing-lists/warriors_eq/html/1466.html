&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can do the orc belt quest.  Trade deathfist slashed belts to the<br/>
&gt; captain of the freeport militia. He can be found on the porch in the back<br/>
&gt; of the militia house in east freeport.  Downside to this is that it lowers<br/>
&gt; faction with the knights of truth paladins.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; There is another npc who takes the orc belts in the warrior guild in<br/>
&gt; freeport.  Not sure of the faction adjustments when you trade them to him,<br/>
&gt; but I do know that there is no negative faction adjustment.  I am pretty<br/>
&gt; sure he adjusts merchant faction, but give it a try to be sure.  I think<br/>
&gt; that it is more beneficial to trade 4 belts at once instead of one at a<br/>
&gt; time.  Maybe someone else can clarify this point.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	I recently killedd a few human pcs in the Freeport arena and was<br/>
&gt; wondering if there was anything i could do to raise faction with the<br/>
&gt; Coalition of Trade Folk (freeport vendors) I am starting to run low on<br/>
&gt; milk and haven&#39;t found anything that raises faction with the Trade Folk.<br/>
&gt; Any information would be much appreciated<br/>
&gt; 	 <br/>
&gt; 	Thanks, Jason<br/>
