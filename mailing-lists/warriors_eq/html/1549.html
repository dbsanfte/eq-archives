<div id="ygrps-yiv-338801432">Hail to tee!<br/>
I am a human warrior of the 20th level.  Read this and you&#39;ll know everthing <br/>
that is going on.  I&#39;ve don some mathimatical calculations.<br/>
<br/>
FAQ:<br/>
Q. Whats going on?<br/>
A. They upgraded the warrior. We get a Critical Hit attack, SV Magic boost <br/>
(and probably others),an HP &quot;buff&quot; and I&#39;ve found that I am hitting alot <br/>
harder, quicker and more damage then before.<br/>
<br/>
_____________________________________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;ve done some calculating with some math operation I&#39;ve learned in <br/>
calculess last year.<br/>
If you Duel weild on faster weapons, IE. anything dealy:30 and down you&#39;ll <br/>
score more critical hits.  I&#39;ve found that on average from every 2-5 battle <br/>
I can dish about 2 critical hits.  When I ahd my 1st critical hit, it was <br/>
for 18 points of damage and it&#39;s rising, currently I see that I am hitting <br/>
for 32 points.  I have noticed that it&#39;s not going up any more.  So my <br/>
hypothisis is that every level your CH goes up 2 poitns everytime it does it <br/>
and MAX&#39;s out of 10 points per level.<br/>
<br/>
I current duel weild a PGT (right) and a combine Long Sword (left). I have <br/>
noticed with an ratio of 6/26 - 6/28 my average hits per 5 seconds is a <br/>
ratio of dmg to dealy- 46/47 (including double attacks/duel weilds) that <br/>
stat can be calculated to 1 weapon witch would be a 2.304 on the weapon <br/>
dmg:dealy ricter scale.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone noticed the speed, we&#39;re hitting alot harder and alot faster then <br/>
before.  before I think my hp was 600 at lvl 20 and I&#39;ve noticed that it&#39;s <br/>
603 with no buffs.<br/>
<br/>
If someone could get to the guild soon and see what they cahnged that wiuld <br/>
be great, couse currently I am zoned in Unrest.<br/>
<br/>
Your best bet would switch to 1h slashing couse if you look at the table <br/>
below.. you&#39;ll seee what I mean on your chances to CH.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Delay:           CH %<br/>
_______________________<br/>
50               3.45%<br/>
45               6.63%<br/>
40               8.39%<br/>
35               9.92%<br/>
30               12.00%<br/>
25               15.65%<br/>
20               23.003%<br/>
<br/>
As you can see (done by: delay/60[move the . of 2 the the left]) would give <br/>
your %.  Lower the delay and more hits per weapon, moer CH your going to get <br/>
in. so for an average of 1-4CH per battle you you weild 2 weapon of a deal <br/>
of 30 and down and a skill over 90 at the lvl of 20.<br/>
<br/>
=P thnc for reading, hope you understand!!!<br/>
