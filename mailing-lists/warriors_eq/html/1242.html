 </span></blockquote>warrior<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;can kill a mob in about 1 to 3 minutes with many, many hits, followed by up<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;minutes of pure butt sitting. Anyone else think this is slightly unfair for<br/>
&gt;gameplay?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.  Comparing classes soloing is a waste of time.  The game is not geared<br/>
for solo play at higher levels.  Eventually every class will not be able to<br/>
solo effectively.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We had kills stolen many many times and nothing frustrates you more than<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bleeding<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;from a mob that is stolen from you in mid fight. We tried getting<br/>
 </span></blockquote>spellcasters into<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;our group, but at our level, most were doing better playing solo. From all<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of this I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;gathered that two things need to be done.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the example you gave, the solo wizards weren&#39;t really solo.  They were<br/>
letting your group tank for a bit of the damage.  Once your group had<br/>
damaged it enough, the wizard would then start blasting and kill-steal it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;One, if Verant wants to give groups a better advantage than solos, then by<br/>
 </span></blockquote>all means<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;allow group damage to overcome the &#39;single greatest damage dealer gets the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>kill&#39;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;rule. Or bump it up somehow. It doesn&#39;t have to be much but for god sakes<br/>
 </span></blockquote>... people<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;having fun as a team should be rewarded for their organization and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>coordination. It<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;requires effort and patience to play well as a team. It requires nearly<br/>
 </span></blockquote>nothing to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;play well alone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed.  The GROUP that does the most damage should get the kill, not the<br/>
person who does the most damage.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Two, wizzies need to be toned down on solo just a little. I have nothing<br/>
 </span></blockquote>against<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;powerful wizards. I have EVERYTHING against solos who steal other people&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>kills in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;mid battle. Or even if they are grouped for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As you said, these Wizzes were high levels, 20+.  If they want to farm lower<br/>
creatures that give them no experience, that is a camping problem, not a<br/>
problem with wizards.<br/>
