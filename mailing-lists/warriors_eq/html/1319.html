<div id="ygrps-yiv-102908688">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see anything posted about the warrior strike this weekend. It<br/>
was posted on a few boards and a few guilds boards. It&#39;s mainly to sho<br/>
Verant that the warriors feel strongly about our position on our need to<br/>
have our class looked at.<br/>
<br/>
I  will be participating in the strike for at least one day if not both.<br/>
