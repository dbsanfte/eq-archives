<div id="ygrps-yiv-392789124">I have killed high elf paladins in Innothule swamp (level 15-18) and I have<br/>
never gotten an increase in faction with the Indigo Brotherhood. In Rathe<br/>
Mountains north of the entrance from the ferroot, there is a wood elf (may<br/>
be high but think wood) guard who is level 19-21. There are NPC&#39;s in the<br/>
area who will call him when they see an ogre, but not sure if they will<br/>
come if you attack him.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The ONLY way to raise Indigo brotherhood faction is to kill elves.  The<br/>
only<br/>
realistic targets (since Wood Elf guards are very high level) are the elves<br/>
on the Island of Erollsi.  If you raise Indigo you lower Wood/High elf and<br/>
vice a versa.  These two sides are mutually exclusive.<br/>
