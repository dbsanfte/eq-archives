&gt; Ahh, understand I risk losing my equipment if the world crashes while I am <br/>
&gt; camping and my body is left in the open desert (or at the inn in Oasis as it <br/>
&gt; is now), but I must trust in the will of my lord and protector Rallos Zek.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I was a young warrior of the 5th Rank I fell down the hole on the top <br/>
&gt; level of black burrow and was forced to leave my body and all my brand new <br/>
&gt; patchwork armor.  No problem, Rallos Zek gave me the power to start anew and <br/>
&gt; rebuild my weath until I now have half banded and half ring mail, a combine <br/>
&gt; long sword, a fine steel long sword and a fine steel 2H sword.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SH** - It is going to take a whole lot longer to get that stuff back if I <br/>
&gt; lose it.  Better recover my body at lunch.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; btw: Will someone please help me get painbringer?  tehehehe, ok, I know a <br/>
&gt; 16th rank warrior wont last long in Sol B, but I will tag along :)<br/>
