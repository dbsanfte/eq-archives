&gt; Try it and you will see. 3 and 4 person parties<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t the same, because you will often be the<br/>
&gt; primary target of high level mobs and take alot of<br/>
&gt; damage.  But a full party with 2 warriors and 1<br/>
&gt; cleric plus other assorted baggage is a group that<br/>
&gt; can take much higher level mobs without losing<br/>
&gt; members.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right on the money; here&#39;s a very graphic example of<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
In Unrest, grouped (16s-19s) with three tanks, two<br/>
clerics and a wizard, we cleaned up *anything* we<br/>
could pull from the first two floors of the house (up<br/>
to and including Carrion Ghouls and Skeleton Monks,<br/>
and the occasional Barbed Bone Skeleton - all red to<br/>
all of us).  Grouped (16s-19s) with only 1 tank (me),<br/>
two clerics, two wizards and one shaman, we could<br/>
*not* take Skeleton Monks or Barbed Bone Skeletons<br/>
because the Wizards were dead weight then (resists),<br/>
the Clerics didn&#39;t have enough healing to keep me up,<br/>
and I didn&#39;t have the firepower alone to take them<br/>
down before everyone was OOM and it was still at half<br/>
life, laughing at us.<br/>
<br/>
Those who think they can hunt without tanks are right,<br/>
if they&#39;re willing to *only* hunt blues and whites. <br/>
If they want to hunt &#39;up level&#39; from themselves, in<br/>
yellows and reds, they have to have tanks.<br/>
<br/>
My prefered party always has three tanks, period.  My<br/>
most fun ripping and shredding party would be four<br/>
tanks and two clerics (but my friend&#39;s a wizard, and I<br/>
can&#39;t just throw him away like that).  But with three<br/>
tanks and a pair of clerics, you can use the 6th slot<br/>
as a wildcard to fill with a bard or wizard or<br/>
whatever.  Enchanters go especially well, their<br/>
debuffs make fights a lot easier.<br/>
