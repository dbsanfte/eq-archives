<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691775997">My understanding is that a warrior is supposed to have the least amount of<br/>
exp required per level.  I haven&#39;t seen numbers on a monk or ran my own<br/>
controlled experiment to compare, but it seemed like the monk required a<br/>
significant amount more exp last time I ran one.  Don&#39;t quote me on that<br/>
though.<br/>
