<b>Subject:</b> weapons upgrade? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984438965">I have a level 14 Tier&#39;dal warrior named Stilette on Innoruuk.<br/>
<br/>
Her current weapon setup is:<br/>
Right hand Dragoon Dirk (Lore, magic)<br/>
Left hand Tentacle Whip (magic)<br/>
<br/>
I would like to upgrade the tentacle whip to something else.  If you know<br/>
the stats on it, they suck, and I could care less about the lifetap effect.<br/>
The replacement weapon must do magic damage.  What is a decent piercing or<br/>
1h slashing weapon for 200plat or less.  I would be willing to switch to a<br/>
1h blunt weapon but would prefer not to.  Due to my race I will most likely<br/>
be purchasing in the commonlands, Oasis, or Ro.  I will not be traveling to<br/>
any of the other continents.<br/>
<br/>
How much do blackened boots go for BTW?<br/>
