<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759258540">I have a bow with 100 range....I did pull.  What we found ironic was<br/>
the fact that we were able to take them with no problems Friday<br/>
night but got our butts kicked many times Saturday night.  Same <br/>
group, same bandits, same tactics (except for the no mana fiasco).<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d just ike to say... &quot;Suck&#39;s to be you&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Teh..Ahh...huhh...<br/>
&gt; Hail!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well nice trying BUT you should have got a Ceric or at least a bard in<br/>
&gt; there <br/>
&gt; to also healp heal and tank!  I to hunt in E karana for EXP, I fond the<br/>
&gt; crag <br/>
&gt; spiders,Carrion Spiders, Gorge Hounds and high LVL lions give away great <br/>
&gt; EXP!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now... Here&#39;s a little secret I&#39;ve found when huting down a bandit camp<br/>
&gt; wiht <br/>
&gt; 3 or LESS peple in the party.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, what you want is a nice long bow (range 100) with some class 2 arrows,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; all tanks must have these.<br/>
&gt; Now,  when there is all bandits and special NPC in the middle there, go as<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; far as posible with the spell casters and take your &quot;long bow&#39;s and aim at<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; one!  when using a bow at long range this tends to make that one bandit<br/>
&gt; come <br/>
&gt; after you whil the rest stay&#39;s put.  Now as they chase you, get your spell<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; casters pummling with some fire while they get the HP down to about 75-85%<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; thats should be enough damage for the bandit to keep on the spell<br/>
&gt; caster... <br/>
&gt; Run NOW (spell caster(s)),  while he&#39;s running, you take the bandit out <br/>
&gt; right behind him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thus, doing this repeatedly for about 3x then you should be safe taking<br/>
&gt; out <br/>
&gt; the rest in full melee combate mode!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a side note.  If one of your group is engaged on combat by and<br/>
&gt; mob...named or not....then once your party member is dead the mob will<br/>
&gt; come<br/>
&gt; after the next closest party member and so on till all are dead or zoned,<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; you kill the mob.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When a giant attacks a party member...first thing I do is DISBAND! Same<br/>
&gt; goes<br/>
&gt; for anything that can wipe out the whole party.  We disband and then<br/>
&gt; regroup<br/>
&gt; when the danger is passed. Then the whole party doesn&#39;t have to run to<br/>
&gt; zone<br/>
&gt; to regroup which can save considerable time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This can upset some people so it is best to make sure everyone understands<br/>
&gt; before it happens.  To many people die becuase giants can destroy a party<br/>
&gt; before anyone realizes the trouble.  90+  damage per hit makes short work<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; most players especially after being stunned.<br/>

&gt;  &gt; Hail Norrath!<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; This weekend has been probably the worst as<br/>
&gt;  &gt; far as death is concerned, but it was the most<br/>
&gt;  &gt; hilarious.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Friday Eve:<br/>
&gt;  &gt; My party, which consists of a Wizard, Enchantress,<br/>
&gt;  &gt; and myself, a warrior, were headed for the Beholder<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Maze to fight minotaurs and muddite elders. On the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; way through East Karana, we came across a bandit<br/>
&gt;  &gt; camp with a named NPC.  Besides the one with the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; name there were 6 others, two conning blue and the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; rest green.  The enchantress charms one of the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; bandits and the rest come after us, except for the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; named NPC.  We finish off the bandits rather quickly<br/>
&gt;  &gt; then attack the last one (I will give out the name to<br/>
&gt;  &gt; those who ask).<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Well after a very short fight we remove his items and<br/>
&gt;  &gt; find a staff segment and a key, both lore items.  Great,<br/>
&gt;  &gt; they must be part of a quest!  After healing a little<br/>
&gt;  &gt; and regenerating mana, we decided to kill him again so<br/>
&gt;  &gt; that each of us can have a key and staff segment.  We<br/>
&gt;  &gt; recover two bronze weapons in the process and go off<br/>
&gt;  &gt; on our merry way.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Saturday Eve:<br/>
&gt;  &gt; We found out what to do with the key, but not until one<br/>
&gt;  &gt; of our party membes gives it to the wrong person.  No<br/>
&gt;  &gt; problem, we&#39;ll just go get another one.  So back to the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; bandit camp.  Besides two bandits there is a brigand<br/>
&gt;  &gt; (never seen one there before) and the named NPC. Our<br/>
&gt;  &gt; enchantress charms one of the spell casting bandits and<br/>
&gt;  &gt; guess what?  All of them come, and we dispatch them<br/>
&gt;  &gt; without a problem leaving only the named NPC.  Our<br/>
&gt;  &gt; enchantress says &#39;Now (the named NPC)&#39;.  I take out my<br/>
&gt;  &gt; trusty bow and whack!<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; a (named NPC) says hit for 9 non melee damage.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; A (named NPC) begins to cast a spell<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Your body convulsves as lightning arcs through your body.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; A (named NPC) begins to cast a spell<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Your skin combusts.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; By this time he has come into melee range.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; A (named NPC) hits you for 28 damage.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; A (named NPC) hits you for 15 damage.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; To see the least, he killed me and the Enchantress.  The<br/>
&gt;  &gt; wizard was able to escape to the zone.  One of the named<br/>
&gt;  &gt; NPC spells took away 2 bubbles of my health, which is<br/>
&gt;  &gt; almost 200 hit points.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; After we regroup, we find out that our Wizard had expended<br/>
&gt;  &gt; all his mana on the previous fight and wasn&#39;t able to tell us<br/>
&gt;  &gt; before I engaged with the named NPC.  Thus, we both died.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Now we go back for our revenge.  We initiate combat with the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; bandits, but this time the named NPC decides to join in!  (he<br/>
&gt;  &gt; never has done this before).  Well this time the wizard and<br/>
&gt;  &gt; myself die while the enchantress escapes.  I get the message<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &#39;Welcome to Level 15!&#39;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Have we learned our lesson yet?  Not yet!  We go back for the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; third time.  There is only the named NPC and two bandits.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Shouldn&#39;t be a problem.  This time our Enchantress charms<br/>
&gt;  &gt; the named NPC and we quickly dispatch the remaining bandits.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Think we got our revenge?  We did, until a griffawn comes<br/>
&gt;  &gt; up behind the enchantress and attacks.  Well the named NPC<br/>
&gt;  &gt; is still charmed so he starts hitting the griffawn along with<br/>
&gt;  &gt; myself.  About half way through the battle the charm wears off.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; One second the enchantress has a full bar of health, the next<br/>
&gt;  &gt; second she is lying on the ground dead.  The wizards health<br/>
&gt;  &gt; goes from full to half before another spell casting bandit spawns.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; I watch in horrow as my hit points dwindle away to half while still<br/>
&gt;  &gt; fighting the griffawn.  About this time the wizard is trying to gate<br/>
&gt;  &gt; while being hit hard by both the named NPC and the other bandit.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; I watch his health go down to one bubble then turn and start<br/>
&gt;  &gt;running,<br/>
&gt;  &gt; the griffawn on my heels.  I make it to the gorge and turn to finish<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; the griffawn with two bubbles of health.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Whew that was close!  It was a good thing I didn&#39;t attack either<br/>
&gt;  &gt;bandit.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Wrong!!  Doesn&#39;t matter if I attacked them or not, here they come<br/>
&gt;  &gt;over<br/>
&gt;  &gt; the hill.  Suffice to say I died yet again.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; We have decided to give the bandits a WIDE berth anytime we are<br/>
&gt;  &gt; traveling through East Karana.<br/>
