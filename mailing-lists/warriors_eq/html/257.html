<b>Subject:</b> Stamina question?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343469404">Has anyone figured out how stamina affects hp??  I know at level one theres<br/>
not much difference between the standard stamina and a bumped up stamina,<br/>
but as the levels progress theres a BIG difference.<br/>
<br/>
Example compare your vanilla troll warrior and vanilla barbarian warrior.<br/>
At level 20 the troll will have aprox 780hp at level 22 the barbarian will<br/>
have aprox 666hp.  Im taking this information from 2 people I know.  So<br/>
obviously the higher natural stamina does really affect hp over time.<br/>
<br/>
So has anyone figured out a ration? Or any word from Verant how it actually<br/>
works?  At the moment all we have (which is fine) is that more stamina =<br/>
more hp at HIGHER levels.  The higher the levels become the greater the<br/>
divergence.<br/>
<br/>
Wonder if people would mind telling us there stamina, level and hp?<br/>
<br/>
My character has a stamina of 75 and at level 18 she has exactly 500hp.</div>
