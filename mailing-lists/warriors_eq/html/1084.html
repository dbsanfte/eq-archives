<div id="ygrps-yiv-978666498">The rune sword is actually a very good one handed slashing weapon.  To bad<br/>
its also a summoned item.  Most high level magicians can create them.<br/>
Damage 7 delay 26 i believe.  I have been able to keep one in the bank for<br/>
quit some time.  As soon as you log out with it in your inventory tho, it is<br/>
gone forever.  At least until you get a mage to make you another one.<br/>
Anyway, the morale of the story great weapon, but summoned, so find yourself<br/>
a mage to adventure with.  This weapon and a barbed leather whip with cause<br/>
some very good damage together.<br/>

  I would greatly appreciate any info.  I am not happy with my current<br/>
weapons, and the weapons that I want are far out of my reach.<br/>

    Tom, I am ashamed to say that the sword was a gift from a dear friend,<br/>
and I just equipped it and walked out to battle when I was killed.  I was in<br/>
such a state of shock to find it gone, that I forgot the stats and went a<br/>
little &quot;nuts&quot;.  I will find out for you, and get back on this.  But I still<br/>
want to know, &quot;WHAT HAPPENED TO MY SWORD&quot;?  LOL<br/>
<br/>
