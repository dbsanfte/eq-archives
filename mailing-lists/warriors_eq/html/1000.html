<br/>
On the weekend someone in West Commons decided to kill a hill giant, so he<br/>
or she KITIE&#39;d the hill giant around the zone border.  I have no idea how<br/>
many people it killed, it defiantly killed everyone who was at the Orc camp.<br/>
My partner and I managed to dodge the giant 3 times, he got us on the 4th<br/>
circuit.<br/>
<br/>
Thats just rude, you dont KITE something like a giant, especially when it<br/>
resides in a low level zone.  I dont mind dieing because of a fight that I<br/>
started, but to be kited is just frustrating.</div>
