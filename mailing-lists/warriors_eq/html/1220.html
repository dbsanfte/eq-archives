<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066571000">I can feel the pain that both of you are having. The group of five that I play with<br/>
just came from CB after killing everything in there but Dvinn many, many times. My<br/>
experiences were as follows:<br/>
<br/>
1.) High levels constantly camped the eqipment mobs. We were there for a reason, to<br/>
get our Cleric ONE screaming mace (needs two items). In order to do that we had to<br/>
log on at odd times just to get the two items we needed. At times there were<br/>
multiple groups from the SAME guild, camping the mobs nearly a weekend at a time. It<br/>
took the better part of three weeks to get TWO items.<br/>
<br/>
2.) Most all of the solo high level campers were spellcasters. I can recall 2<br/>
wizzies, 2 necros, and a mage. All level 20+ since they had 2 names but other than<br/>
that, they were anon so we could not determine level. Why were they there? I have no<br/>
idea. They all played solo, and they all dealt more damage than any grouped party<br/>
without a spellcaster, thus winning the kill.<br/>
<br/>
3.) At the time we had a group of 5 characters: a lvl 15 pally, a lvl 15 warrior, a<br/>
lvl 14 warrior, a lvl 15 thief, a lvl 14 cleric. While we wre there, there the<br/>
levels even went up to further add to our damage dealing power. Despite this, at no<br/>
time were we able to get a kill when ANY other party contained a wizard. Even if<br/>
they were solo wizards only one or two levels above us. Typical scenario ... we have<br/>
the spawn, we attack and damage the mob to about 3/4 or 1/2 damage when *fzzzzt* a<br/>
spellcaster nukes the mob, trains it to him and then finishes with a few more<br/>
spells. We would always chase,but we could never get the kill when this happened.<br/>
<br/>
4.) A solo spellcaster can fry a mob in about 30 to 45 seconds with 5 or 6 strong<br/>
spells, followed by about a 5 minute &#39;meditation enhanced&#39; downtime. A solo warrior<br/>
can kill a mob in about 1 to 3 minutes with many, many hits, followed by up to 15<br/>
minutes of pure butt sitting. Anyone else think this is slightly unfair for<br/>
gameplay?<br/>
<br/>
We had kills stolen many many times and nothing frustrates you more than bleeding<br/>
from a mob that is stolen from you in mid fight. We tried getting spellcasters into<br/>
our group, but at our level, most were doing better playing solo. From all of this I<br/>
gathered that two things need to be done.<br/>
<br/>
One, if Verant wants to give groups a better advantage than solos, then by all means<br/>
allow group damage to overcome the &#39;single greatest damage dealer gets the kill&#39;<br/>
rule. Or bump it up somehow. It doesn&#39;t have to be much but for god sakes ... people<br/>
having fun as a team should be rewarded for their organization and coordination. It<br/>
requires effort and patience to play well as a team. It requires nearly nothing to<br/>
play well alone.<br/>
<br/>
Two, wizzies need to be toned down on solo just a little. I have nothing against<br/>
powerful wizards. I have EVERYTHING against solos who steal other people&#39;s kills in<br/>
mid battle. Or even if they are grouped for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone think of a GOOD way to prevent these type of activities? I cannot. We&#39;ve<br/>
discussed it in our group many times but could not come up with much. Any input on<br/>
this post, or the two previous, would be great to hear. Maybe it will cheer me up<br/>
some.<br/>

P.S.- By the way, great tip on the kill stealing Druid. Thanks for that tactical<br/>
advice Surtur.<br/>

&gt; I know how frustrating this is. I was 12 or 13 at the Chessboard in butcherblock<br/>
&gt; with about 3 other people,  one cleric and 2 other hybrids . A 13th druid showed<br/>
&gt; up and was able to outdamage us and was clearly using us as his tanks while<br/>
&gt; taking all of the experience. We asked him if he wanted to alternate kills, or a<br/>
&gt; number of other solutions that would benefit us both. But he clearly wanted to<br/>
&gt; get every kill he could grab from us, while he took no damage from them. He even<br/>
&gt; told us he would leave when he reached 14 so he could get his next rank of<br/>
&gt; spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So we decided that the next king would get it&#39;s attention and no-one would<br/>
&gt; attack it, so when he started blasting it would go for him. He tried training it<br/>
&gt; on us and we just kept fleeing from it so it was focused on him. Then he trained<br/>
&gt; it on someone on the otherside of the board and stole the kill from them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If verant is encouraging us to work to gether, the code needs to be changed so<br/>
&gt; that the experience goes to the Group that does the most damage, not the<br/>
&gt; individual who does the most. This allowed this druid to steal them from us and<br/>
&gt; use my party as his shield. If we as a group were the determining factor in who<br/>
&gt; gets the xp, then he would not have been able to do this. This would also<br/>
&gt; encourage players to form larger groups to overcome problems like this on our<br/>
&gt; own and not have to petition them. In this situation we could of outdamage him<br/>
&gt; and taken the kills that were ours and he would have gotten frustrated and left,<br/>
&gt; or worked on getting a lerger group on his own that would have forced us to<br/>
&gt; leave. I&#39;m sure there could be abuses with this rule change, so please let me<br/>
&gt; know what they are.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I play a 38th halfling warrior on Povar... I have some dam good equipment<br/>
&gt; &gt; and am one of the higher warriors on the server... But something happened to<br/>
&gt; &gt; me yesterday that I think highlights the warrior classes weakness... I<br/>
&gt; &gt; decided I wanted to get that new dragoon&#39;s dirk from Dvinn in Crushbone...<br/>
&gt; &gt; So I went there, camped in his room, for those of you that dont know, Dvinn<br/>
&gt; &gt; is about a 25th level DE that is very tough.... He spawned and I attacked<br/>
&gt; &gt; him... low and behold a wizzie... AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE.... ran into the<br/>
&gt; &gt; room, and started blasting him!  Guess what? AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE STOLE<br/>
&gt; &gt; DVINN FROM A 38TH LEVEL WARRIOR!!!!!  Do I need to say ANYTHING else? btw I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was using a zweildahander.... This was the most embarassing thing that has<br/>
&gt; &gt; ever happened to me... I&#39;m sitting there in almost full rubicite, all these<br/>
&gt; &gt; cool items, everyone is looking at me... and then i have the thing stolen<br/>
&gt; &gt; from me by ONE, not a group, but ONE 18th level wizzie......grumbles<br/>
&gt; &gt; something about warriors suck and I am ready to cancel my account...<br/>
