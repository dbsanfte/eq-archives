<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-681414995">Head toCazic Thule for cash.  I know it is probably heavily populated, but<br/>
you can get alot of FS weapons from the defenders and sentinels which should<br/>
still give you experiece as well.  The warders will carry FS also.  Just get<br/>
yourself with a cleric and pull ones and twos from the tunnels and &quot;try&quot; to<br/>
get the ones that have FS.  I have made over 100 plat a night in that place<br/>
with just a few hours worth of work.  And that was during crowded time<br/>
periods.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the temple at th end of the maze is a GREAT place for cash/exp.  But<br/>
you should have a pretty good group to go into that area.  Definitely have a<br/>
well rounded group i.e. 2 healer/2tank/2nuker.  You will gain xp and cash<br/>
very fast in that area.<br/>
<br/>
As far as weapons are concerned.  Try to get yourself a demons claw and<br/>
tentacle whip.  The PGT is nice, but the knock to your agi is terrible when<br/>
the bezerker strength goes off.  The VERY low speed/damage on these items<br/>
allows for non-stop attacks.  For armor...  I would recommend saving your<br/>
cash for Steel plate until you can get into some rubi/mithril/silvered.  I<br/>
had similiar problems with people constantly camping the rubicite so i<br/>
decided while they were sitting there gaining nothing but wasting a tone of<br/>
time.  I would just spend my time reaping cash/xp from the lizards and buy<br/>
my armor.  Also get as much bronze as you can in the mean time wihthout<br/>
spend alot of time/money doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Another good money pit is solusek a.  You should be able to go there with a<br/>
well balanced group and get around pretty well.  Be wary of the traps and<br/>
get mobbed by hordes thoug.  Everytime I head to a place like that i have a<br/>
druid or wiz that can group gate or succor us out in an emergency (they<br/>
always happen *grin).<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; elm recurve bow  =&gt; Ash or Oak as you like it set<br/>
&gt; &gt; up.  ---<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; yep yep...need better bow!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; +1 str earrings =&gt; Gold-Amber (+3 STR)  - these would be cool )<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; collar of undead prot =&gt; Spiked Collar (+3 STR)  - ive got a spiked<br/>
&gt; &gt; collar but went in favour of the undead one...with better AC<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; blackened helm =&gt; Bronze Helm or B.Iron Crown  --- sorry i<br/>
&gt; menat B iron<br/>
&gt; &gt; crown, not blackened helm<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; grotesque mask<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; BS mantle<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bronze tunic<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; barbed arms =&gt; Bronze Arms   --- my barbed arms are only 1 ac<br/>
&gt; less than<br/>
&gt; &gt; bronze, but give +2 dex<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bronze bracers =&gt; Bracers of Battle  --- yeah ill have to look for<br/>
&gt; &gt; these...was also thinking of erollisi bracer<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lizardscale cloak =&gt; Bronze Cloak --- lizard is same Ac as bronze but<br/>
&gt; &gt; lighter and plus 5 dex<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bronze pants<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; blackened boots =&gt; Bronze or Dwarven Work Boots  --- dwarven<br/>
&gt; boots would<br/>
&gt; &gt; be real cool...but they are so sought after and rare...i prefer<br/>
&gt; the black<br/>
&gt; &gt; ones over bronze as i can kick magic with them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; +5 agi rings<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; jboots =&gt; Or just wear these all the time.  - -- i just leave these in<br/>
&gt; &gt; an inventory slot as i dont need to wear them for the sow<br/>
&gt; effect..only ac<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Question about the Journeyman&#39;s Boots.  Do they<br/>
&gt; &gt; enhance your speed just by wearing them, or do you<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to burn a SOW charge out of them to get a speed<br/>
&gt; &gt; increase?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; they just need to be in a main inventory slot, then you right<br/>
&gt; click on them<br/>
&gt; to get the sow...and they have unlimited charges...sow can only be cast<br/>
&gt; outdoors and lasts 20 mins...but you can cast on the move as well...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Go all bronze on your character and start working on<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rubicite or Mithril/Silvered Plate.  Any items you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; wearing that are chain equalivalent are holding you<br/>
&gt; &gt; back; plate is a requirement to do really, really well<br/>
&gt; &gt; at higher levels in melee.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; yeah would love to go for rubi...mithril or silvered...just they<br/>
&gt; are all so<br/>
&gt; camped...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i also only have about 300pp in the bank...i think this is way below what<br/>
&gt; most seem to have at level 30!! so im also trying to find a good place to<br/>
&gt; sit for hours and just gather plat and not worry about exp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thanks again<br/>
