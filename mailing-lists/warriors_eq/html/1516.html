<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185326831">Jiya guys. Just some questions. I heard that there are two centaurs in the<br/>
Centaur Village in South Karana at 200, -2400 that offer Blue Plate or<br/>
&quot;Crafted&quot;, and that it is Warrior Only armor. Does anyone know what items<br/>
you need to give and what the stats are? Also any magic on it? Any info<br/>
appreciated!<br/>
