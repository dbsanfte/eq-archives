At lvl 19 i dual wield a PGT and a Bladed thulian Claw (demon claw). I love <br/>
dual wield but evryone keeps telling me I should buy a Blackened Iron <br/>
bastard sword.  Sure i thinbk that weapon is great, but i like going fast.  <br/>
Anyone have an opinion on what i should choose?<br/>
<br/>
Also, i ran into a player whom decided to make a warrior instead of use his <br/>
lvl 27 paladin or something like that.  He tought me how dex and agl was the <br/>
way to go for him instead of str.  So he put all his points into those <br/>
instead of str.  I am thinking of only getting items that increse agl and <br/>
dex, so i can be an excellent tank. sure the str might not be up, but you <br/>
will be fast and very hard to hit.  This is just what he told me and I <br/>
thought it was neat..<br/>
