<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230181629">Sure ... I have suggestions. But the question is what do you WANT to put the<br/>
skill points into. Ever thought of a trade skill? You are at a good point<br/>
now to be able to support most any of them. I won&#39;t get into those here.<br/>
<br/>
Tip one:<br/>
Bind Wound - get it, use it ... it will save you many minutes of sitting on<br/>
your butt later as you get higher and higer amounts of hit points. It will<br/>
only get you up to half life, but that&#39;s a long way when you zoned out with<br/>
a sliver of red and you have no healer type with you. It will also reduce<br/>
the bitching you will receive from your group members for always having to<br/>
wait on your slow healing rate (when in actuality you have twice their hit<br/>
points). A few points will really jump start this skill.<br/>
<br/>
Tip two:<br/>
Alcohol Tolerance - It helps reduce the negative effects of alcohol. Since<br/>
alcohol will pump your strength and stamina (? I think), then this will<br/>
significantly help you in fights. The downside of alchol, reduced agility<br/>
and the wobble/vision things are supposed to be much reduced, or even not<br/>
present as your skill gets higher. I have not done much with this skill but<br/>
there was a post to this group a while back. Maybe someone can repost it. I<br/>
think the sender included what benefits he saw at different levels.<br/>
<br/>
Tip three:<br/>
Any other skill that is used heavily that you may not have already trained<br/>
up in, including; swimming, sense direction, and secondary weapon skills<br/>
that you might need for emergencies.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
Rosmorte (aka Faderic)<br/>

&gt; Greetings,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, just turned 18 *tee heee legal*. I haven&#39;t trained in any skill<br/>
&gt; since my duals... Next specialty comes at 25.. going to save 20 training<br/>
&gt; points for that. Any other suggestions as to what I should put my<br/>
&gt; training points into?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; OH! btw.. can anyone tell me anything about permafrost can&#39;t find a map<br/>
&gt; for the life of me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
