<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129698724">hmmm I agree and disagree.<br/>
<br/>
I mean I use to hold to the same idea (and I even suggested it last night -<br/>
lets just fight IN the room with the bonecracker and 2 necros, if we die we<br/>
die, but atleast we tried).  I always thought that the traditional dungeon<br/>
crawl, that is go from room to room exterminating the enemy, is the best<br/>
way.  BUT EQ doesn&#39;t allow that, things RESPAWN, so your back is never even<br/>
marginally safe. <br/>
<br/>
Then I thought about it logically why do humans and demi-humans dominate the<br/>
world of Norrath and not orcs or goblins who seem to exist in profusion as<br/>
well, and are physically tuffer than us (we use weapons to hurt them and<br/>
wear armour, there natural strength and thick skin is good enough)?<br/>
<br/>
It occurred to me its because we are smarter than them.  If &quot;pulling&quot; can<br/>
neutralize part of the enemy attack then I think its a good thing,  I think<br/>
its a good thing because it demonstrates WHY we rule the planet - we are<br/>
smart (comparatively speaking).  Its also a solid tactical move, minimize<br/>
the enemies ability to attack you, have them come one at a time or have them<br/>
strung out.<br/>
<br/>
So you have never pulled? or never been in a party that has?<br/>

&gt; THANK GOD, I think pulling monsters is lame...if you can&#39;t fight in the<br/>
&gt; area, then you shouldn&#39;t be there....which in turn will help promote group<br/>
&gt; play, rather than having a high level puller fetch a single monster at a<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>

&gt; &gt; They seem to have made the Tentacle Terrors way more aggressive<br/>
&gt; &gt; and stronger<br/>
&gt; &gt; as well.  I am level 21 and they are blue to white to me.  My friend, a<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 30 ranger was helping me raise my 2handed skill (I just got a BBC)<br/>
&gt; &gt; with the TT.  He would draw them out (they are green to him) and take<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; &gt; the blows.  They would consistently reduce him to one bubble and myself<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; half my hit points.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The day before they were a piece of cake, now there killing machines.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; They seem to have changed the linking also with the bonecracker.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It used to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be you could pull the BC and the two necros would not come (as<br/>
&gt; &gt; long as they<br/>
&gt; &gt; were green to the puller).  Now they all come no matter what.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; AND finally blind spell pulling no longer works either.  If you target a<br/>
&gt; &gt; mob, then run to another room (i.e. the mob cant see you) you could cast<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; spell and the mob would come running.  This no longer works.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just thought I would share that with you all.<br/>
