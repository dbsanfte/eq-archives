<div id="ygrps-yiv-654528177">I never leave a corpse out over night - just because!  Only once have I had<br/>
to do that with my bard char and the evil gnoll who caused that painfull<br/>
death and the 6 that followed in unsuccessful retrieval attempts.  It was<br/>
the named dark gnoll dude from SplitPaw - and someday he will pay and pay<br/>
dearly!<br/>

		Interesting day you had Patty.   Sorry it ended in such<br/>
agony.  I do<br/>
		have a suggestion however....I try to make it a point to<br/>
never log out<br/>
		for the night without getting my corpse.  I have heard too<br/>
many <br/>
		horror stories of people that came back for their corpse and<br/>
it wasn&#39;t<br/>
		there anymore (the Xegony crash comes to mind, don&#39;t know<br/>
how<br/>
		corpses are handled when the server crashes but I really<br/>
wouldn&#39;t<br/>
		want to chance it).<br/>

		&gt; Got up this morning camped just outside of the entrance to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Guk.  As I was <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; putting my stuff away I was think about the good times I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>has with my guild<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; <br/>
		&gt; mates hunting frogs in the dungeon.  I had never been to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Guk and it was a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; lot of fun.  Well mostly fun, that one train that wiped<br/>
 </span></blockquote>out the entire<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; party <br/>
		&gt; was no fun, especially the walk back from the high pass.<br/>
		&gt; <br/>
		&gt; So now I was along in the swamps and backing my stuff.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Darn backpacks<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; were <br/>
		&gt; heavy and as I put them all one I realized I was<br/>
 </span></blockquote>encumbered now the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; &quot;Spirit <br/>
		&gt; of the Bear&quot; had left me (141/130).  Time to go sell.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe there is a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; spot <br/>
		&gt; in South Ro I could sell, if not there I knew I could sell<br/>
 </span></blockquote>at the inn in <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; Oasis.  Oasis would be good.  There I could get some<br/>
 </span></blockquote>experience killing <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; crocodiles and caimans.<br/>
		&gt; <br/>
		&gt; So adjusting my backpacks I started off running around the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>side of the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; swamp <br/>
		&gt; to the pass leading to South Ro.  An easy trot saw a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>couple of frogs and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; an <br/>
		&gt; alligator or two, but nothing that looked worth hunting.<br/>
		&gt; <br/>
		&gt; Once I zoned to South Ro I decided to look around a bit to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>see what was <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; around.  Just a bunch of Orcs, had to kill a couple just<br/>
 </span></blockquote>because, but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; didn&#39;t <br/>
		&gt; get any experience.  It was also kind of fun to walk<br/>
 </span></blockquote>straight through the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; Orc camps since they were too scared of me to do anything.<br/>
		&gt; <br/>
		&gt; &quot;Well enough of this&quot; I thought and turned to go into the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>desert.  Time to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; <br/>
		&gt; sell my loot and get to killing crocodiles.<br/>
		&gt; <br/>
		&gt; As I was crossing the desert I came across a couple of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Troll and a dark<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; elf <br/>
		&gt; killing dervishes.  Stopped to check things out for a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>second and to see<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; what <br/>
		&gt; the camp looked like.  As I was checking things out I saw<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a skeleton <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; standing out in front of the tents all by himself.  Well,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>figured I would <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; get closer and check him out, might be some good<br/>
 </span></blockquote>experience for me on the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; way to Oasis.  Big mistake, wasn&#39;t just any skeleton but a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>dry bone<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; skeleton <br/>
		&gt; that didn&#39;t like barbarians.<br/>
		&gt; <br/>
		&gt; The trolls jumped in to help me, but even with my dual<br/>
 </span></blockquote>long swords flying <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; and the trolls beating on the skeleton, I soon found<br/>
 </span></blockquote>myself laying on my <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; back again wondering why I ever got so close to the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>skeleton.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; <br/>
		&gt; Well soon after that I found myself back in the high hold<br/>
 </span></blockquote>pass naked<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; except <br/>
		&gt; for my kilt.  As I was standing up I got a message from<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rallos Zek, the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; once <br/>
		&gt; I was hoping not to here - &quot;You have failed me once again<br/>
 </span></blockquote>young barbarian,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; <br/>
		&gt; no longer can you claim the 16th Rank of warrior, you have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lost a level<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; and <br/>
		&gt; are now 15 again.&quot;<br/>
		&gt; <br/>
		&gt; Drat and darn, not only did I lose a level, had a long<br/>
 </span></blockquote>walk ahead of me,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; but <br/>
		&gt; all my spare stuff from the bank vault was on my body.  Oh<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well, back to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; the <br/>
		&gt; battle, now I really had to go back to Oasis as soon as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>possible to make <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; 16th Rank again.  Pissing off Rallos Zek is never a good<br/>
 </span></blockquote>idea.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; <br/>
		&gt; So I ran as fast as I can, past ghouls, giant spiders,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sand giants and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; orcs. <br/>
		&gt;   Finally I was back in the desert of South Ro, hugging<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the wall, and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; looking for my body.<br/>
		&gt; <br/>
		&gt; Running south to the dervish tents, I suddenly heard the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sound no one<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; wants <br/>
		&gt; to hear.  Even the bravest warrior blanches in fear when<br/>
 </span></blockquote>she hears the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; pounding footsteps of a giant behind her.<br/>
		&gt; <br/>
		&gt; A sand giant hits you for 96 points<br/>
		&gt; A sand giant hits you for 87 points<br/>
		&gt; You are stunned...<br/>
		&gt; <br/>
		&gt; Well that hurt.  Once I found myself back in the Pass I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>decided that was <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; enough for the day.  Looking around I found myself a nice<br/>
 </span></blockquote>flat rock to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; rest <br/>
		&gt; on and lay down to camp.  Good thing I am a barbarian and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the chill air<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; this <br/>
		&gt; high didn&#39;t bother me.  Guess I will go get my body later<br/>
 </span></blockquote>tonight.<br/>
