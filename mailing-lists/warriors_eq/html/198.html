<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484350795">heh, I started a Wood Elf warrior last night to make arrows for my DE, since there is nowhere for darks to buy fletching materials....got him up to 5th in about 3 hours, without a single twinked item on him.....but anyways......<br/>
<br/>
1.  At the various gypsy camps<br/>
<br/>
2.  I&#39;ve had many warriors with many types of armor, I may be wrong, but I&#39;ve never noticed between ring, chain, or banded, other than weight.<br/>
<br/>
3.  parry is blocking an attack<br/>
<br/>
4.  To my knowledge enchanters can not put perminant enchantments on items other than bars of copper, silver, gold, plat.<br/>
<br/>
5.  never messed much with quest, yet to see or hear of a low level quest that is actually worth the time and effort.<br/>

Hail All !<br/>
Not To brag - I&#39;m a Human, Warrior(lvl 10) and I just got this game about <br/>
one month ago.  I&#39;m still getting used to it&#39;s lingo and such-forth but I&#39;m <br/>
having a few questions/help/input thats on my mind.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.  Now, I need a magical sword, so that I can kill Wisp&#39;s... I&#39;m thinking <br/>
about investing into a &#39;Combined 2H Sword&#39;.  I&#39;ve herd they can very from <br/>
75pp - 120pp.  I&#39;m wondering where I can get it.<br/>
<br/>
P.S Where is the best place to hunt wisp&#39;s. (I&#39;ve herd they offer good money <br/>
drops)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.  For a lvl 10, I have RingMail tunic, RingMail pants & RingMail sleeve&#39;s. <br/>
  I&#39;ve switched to RingMail couse I&#39;ve found there a little bit less then <br/>
Banded Mail and you get the same AC but a little more weight.  I&#39;ve also <br/>
noticed that with RingMail that monsters tend to miss a bit more and I dodge <br/>
more quicker then Banded Mail.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3.  When I reach lvl 12, What does perry skill do?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4.  I was wondering, I have a Kite Shield and one Mino Battle Axe.  When I <br/>
get dule wielding, I&#39;ll buy another Mino Battle Axe... Is there some way I <br/>
can contact a lvl35+ Enchanter and he/she could make my Mino Battle Axe <br/>
magical somehow OR even make the delay better?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5.  Ok, I&#39;m having trouble with some quest&#39;s... What are good ones that <br/>
offer good money, Experience Points & and a all around good item?<br/>
<br/>
                          Thanks for reading my newbie questions!<br/>
