<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733309333">All I really know about making things such as that are that you need:<br/>
A forge<br/>
Flasks of Water<br/>
Sheets Of Metal (or metal bits, depending on size of item)<br/>
And the mold for the item.<br/>
As far as I was able to discern, you can&#39;t make weapons just yet....only mundane items and armor, making the smithing skill pretty worthless. <br/>
Just my 2 cents ;-}~<br/>
