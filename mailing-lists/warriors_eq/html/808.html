<div id="ygrps-yiv-19428553">A solution to camping shouldn&#39;t be to complicated.<br/>
A high level magic weapon spawning on a unique NPC cannot spawn if the item<br/>
exists in the &quot;spawn area&quot; AND the item must be initiated by a quest.<br/>
Unique NPCs should also spawn in a random location in the zone.<br/>
<br/>
Farming is the main problem....I think. I have no respect for farmers.  If<br/>
they won&#39;t take turns on rare spawn item I will kill-steal it.  I am a<br/>
dark-elf after all.  I don&#39;t necessarily like doing this, but when a group<br/>
has been farming a spot for days and refuses to share the spawns there isn&#39;t<br/>
really any option.  So when the creature spawns....my group attacks it.  We<br/>
try to get it first and then accuse them of kill-stealing...which is true<br/>
depending on your perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I just think that farmers ruin the spirit of the game.  I never camp a rare<br/>
spawn item for more than an hour or 2 spawns whichever comes first.  I<br/>
respect those who camp a spot so they can have that awesome weapon they<br/>
really want but can&#39;t afford....but I depise those who camp a spot so they<br/>
can sell the items.  It just isn&#39;t in the spirit of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion.  I know some of you won&#39;t approve of my method of dealing<br/>
with farmers, and you are entitled to that.</div>
