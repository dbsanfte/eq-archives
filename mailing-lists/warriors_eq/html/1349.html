<b>Subject:</b> Petition update <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284500295">The petition has been updated as follows.<br/>
<br/>
1.  6 points per level instead of 5.  Some people thought 7 was too high.  6<br/>
allows combat skill to cap at about 300.  Slightly higher than 255, but<br/>
allowing 6 per level allows warrior to be better in melee combat before<br/>
Level 41 when the skill cap would supposedly no longer be in effect<br/>
<br/>
2.  Added that there needed to be a skill unique to warriors only.  Weapon<br/>
Specialization was the suggested ability.<br/>
