<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-238403586">Excellent, just the type of info was looking for.  How would I determine<br/>
level base for items?  Would it be level they could be/have been purchased<br/>
at.  Average pricing I can definitely do.  I could allow people to submit<br/>
how much they paid for an item and on what server so that you can even get<br/>
an average for the server you play on.  Would something similar for level<br/>
work?  Let people input what level they obtained an item at and create an<br/>
average?<br/>
<br/>
Everyone out there:  What would your dream site for items be?  What would<br/>
you want it to contain?<br/>
<br/>

  Okay,<br/>
  If I would have my dream site for equiptment and such<br/>
<br/>
  Level based - what equiptment armor/weapons =&gt; someone who is wondering<br/>
what to get at each level(s) could go there and see.<br/>
  Stat impoving - say I want to know how to up my stats for str, agi, dex,<br/>
sta what weapons/armor/jewelry/misc - where/who/how to get plus some<br/>
explinations about how each stat improvement can improve warrior&#39;s<br/>
performance.<br/>
  Quest based - items that can only be gotten through quests<br/>
  Purchasable items - average pricing<br/>
  Player Trade/purchased - price should pay for these<br/>
<br/>
  That site I like for the message board. Get good tips and such from there.<br/>

      So does the site have everything you need?  Are the items arranged in<br/>
a good order?  As far as items goes could it be better?</div>
