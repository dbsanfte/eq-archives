<div id="ygrps-yiv-340935407">Yes, the scarecrows are not bad xp, but it is actually slower than with a<br/>
half descent group in Unrest.  If you can get a group in unrest killing yard<br/>
trash, which is in abundance, you can level much faster.  You can even take<br/>
some of the lower level house items depending on if you can get some of it<br/>
in ones and twos.  Soloing is not the way of life for a warrior, they are<br/>
meant to be the meat of a group.  You will come to rely on your group more<br/>
than anything else very soon when there is almost nothing you can solo and<br/>
still get xp.<br/>
<br/>
But yes, the scarecrows were left out of places you can get xp at an ok rate<br/>
and solo.<br/>

Just thought I would share this.  I&#39;ve notice that not too many folks hunt<br/>
the scarecrows at the Miller farm in West Karana.  While the money is not<br/>
that great, the ep is pretty good, and there is usually no one there so you<br/>
have them all to yourself.  There are 4 that spawn in the fields of the<br/>
Miller farm.  It is rather safe hunting, as the scarecrows do not help each<br/>
other (no trains) and there is nothing in the area that is dangerous to you.<br/>
I have never seen a Hill giant at the farm, and at 18th lvl that is the only<br/>
wandering mob in the zone you really have to watch for.  Soloing for a<br/>
warrior is really tough, but I was able to gain some good ep, in a<br/>
reasonable time, in relative safety while solo in these fields.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to fight 2 in a row before having to rest.  Just make sure you<br/>
have lots of bandages!<br/>
