<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139841480">Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering if any of you had any cool info on Mistmoore. Ive never<br/>
been there and was thinking about venturing over there. i hear there are a<br/>
lot of good mid to high range MOBS there. Is this place usualy packed? Any<br/>
good magical items to be found in here? Any info would be much appreciated<br/>
before i make the long walk over there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
