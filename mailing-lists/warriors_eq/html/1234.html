<div id="ygrps-yiv-876555017">No bother at all, I actually found it a nice<br/>
change from the normal subjects here. Most of the<br/>
reason I play the game is for adventure and fun<br/>
.... not to figure out what weapon does the most<br/>
damage.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the nice break from warrior drizzle.<br/>

&gt;      adventures<br/>
&gt;       I died alot this weekend. Bad luck,<br/>
&gt;      incompetence of others, various other<br/>
&gt;      reasons. I only made a net result of<br/>
&gt;      half bubble all weekend.  I did get my<br/>
&gt;      shiny brass halberd.  After twice<br/>
&gt;      getting the kill for the halberd<br/>
&gt;      stolen from me, I ended up buying a<br/>
&gt;      halberd from the kill-stealing wiz for<br/>
&gt;      100p.  An excellent price.  I could<br/>
&gt;      make a hefty profit selling it.  But I<br/>
&gt;      am keeping it :) I also travelled<br/>
&gt;      through the Karanas, North, south, and<br/>
&gt;      east. I also checked out Queynos hill,<br/>
&gt;      Surefall glades and Blackburrow.<br/>
&gt;      Didn&#39;t really wander black burrow at<br/>
&gt;      all. Fear of trains and other recent<br/>
&gt;      deaths made me choose not to stay.  I<br/>
&gt;      found the Karanas to be full of<br/>
&gt;      excellent prey. I may get bound to<br/>
&gt;      Queynos and do some hunting there.<br/>
&gt;      Unfortunately the zone to Highpass<br/>
&gt;      from East Karanas is about 10 minutes<br/>
&gt;      long.  Most zones have those tunnels,<br/>
&gt;      this one makes the tunnel from Ro to<br/>
&gt;      East commons look short. So binding in<br/>
&gt;      Highpass is an option, but the East<br/>
&gt;      Karanas is dangerous. Alot of things<br/>
&gt;      there that will kill you dead.<br/>
&gt;      Cyclops, hill giants, high level<br/>
&gt;      gnolls, griffons and more.  I killed a<br/>
&gt;      griffawn, a lower level griffon while<br/>
&gt;      I was there....oh that felt so good.<br/>
&gt;      It was a close fight and I nearly died<br/>
&gt;      but it was oh so worth it.   Can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;      wait till I can kill a full size<br/>
&gt;      griffon. North Karanas I think had<br/>
&gt;      centaurs....which are pretty cool.<br/>
&gt;      They are indifferent to me, but I<br/>
&gt;      attacked one to see what kind of loot<br/>
&gt;      and how tought they  were.  This one<br/>
&gt;      was a centaur foal and a low blue to<br/>
&gt;      me.  I ended up zoning...the whole<br/>
&gt;      time I was running it was shooting<br/>
&gt;      arrows at me!  Oh now that was no<br/>
&gt;      fun.  I also killed a scarecrow...now<br/>
&gt;      those are very cool looking.  They do<br/>
&gt;      require magic to damage though....like<br/>
&gt;      a wisp. I partied last night in<br/>
&gt;      Lavastorm.....it was kind of nice to<br/>
&gt;      return. That is where I made all the<br/>
&gt;      exp back that I lost over the<br/>
&gt;      weekend.  I didn&#39;t check my loot yet<br/>
&gt;      but it was fun.  Also hit Najena.  Man<br/>
&gt;      that place has changed. I could walk<br/>
&gt;      unmolested all the way to the big sign<br/>
&gt;      inside that says NAJENA.  The terrors<br/>
&gt;      were camped as bad as anywhere else.<br/>
&gt;      Explored a bit more than we have<br/>
&gt;      before and found a room full of dark<br/>
&gt;      boned skeletons. Quite unpleasant<br/>
&gt;      creatures I can tell you.  Also fought<br/>
&gt;      some cool opponents like a dark elf<br/>
&gt;      magician NPC.  She was a bitch because<br/>
&gt;      she had a tough pet.  We lost someone<br/>
&gt;      on that fight and she was blue to us<br/>
&gt;      all.<br/>
