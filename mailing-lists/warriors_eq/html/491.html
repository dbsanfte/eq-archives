<b>Subject:</b> Squad Ring.. secret abilities? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-401337950">Hmmm I did this quest when I was a paladin and thought the ring was rather<br/>
useless, one heal of 80hp and then you need to go back to riverdale to<br/>
recharge it? bah!<br/>
<br/>
BUT I heard the rumour that it also has another ability, it reduces tick<br/>
time from 5 secs to 2.5 secs.  If this is true then this is a MUST have ring<br/>
for all warriors.  Can anyone please test it and confirm this?<br/>
<br/>
I deleted the character that had done the quest and now I am a DE so its<br/>
difficult and time consuming for me to test it.  Thanks.</div>
