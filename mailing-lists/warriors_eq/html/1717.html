<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728761170">Personally I think the Skyfire sword is really underrated sword (10/22 and a<br/>
few stats as well cant recall them off hand). If all 3 hit(3 waves of 56<br/>
each) its 164 points a proc and on my warrior I usually resist near all of<br/>
it.  The aoe is very small and if your in a group w/o an enchanter there is<br/>
really no reason not to use it IMO(Unless you have better which isn&#39;t too<br/>
tough its not that good). But with Garu I can proc 7 to 10 times on a exp<br/>
mob. (10x 164= 1640dmg, not too bad).  This is coming from a player who&#39;s<br/>
main is a 55 enchanter so I am suppose to hate aoe weapons.  Does anyone<br/>
know of anyother AOE weapons with a halfway all right proc?  I would love to<br/>
have one for my off hand as well as main for those times when no Enchanter<br/>
is around and for single pulls.<br/>

Wow THE Kailyn?  The same fellow from the old eq.stratics board?  The<br/>
guy who discovered the STA/HP formula & the Agi/AC formulas? If so its<br/>
darn good to hear from you again.  I learned alot of what I needed to<br/>
know about warrioring from that board.<br/>
<br/>
I indeed was part of the great warrior sitout (I think the first<br/>
sitout). I remember Fitty, Ruatha & all the other Stratics guys egging<br/>
all the warriors on to particpate (things really were hard on early<br/>
warriors).   I was laughing when over your story about bronze...I myself<br/>
did not get full bronze until lvl 24 (?) if I remember right.  Heck I<br/>
used dual Mino Axes until lvl 18 (then had to get a combine long sword<br/>
to kill undead in Unrest).<br/>
<br/>
BTW another great warrior weapon to add to the &quot;uber&quot; list you mentioned<br/>
is the bloodpoint 10/21 procs an 80 pt hp txf & is not lore (drops in<br/>
Howling Stones).  I have 1 of these at the moment & with werwolf form<br/>
see 8-9 procs a fight.  My goal in life (other than get to lvl 56 &<br/>
riposte) is to obtain another.<br/>
<br/>
Good to hear from you bro<br/>
