&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Uh ... ok.  If you say so.  I call Paladins &#39;self-filling tanks&#39;,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;because they are just that.  They&#39;re not really effective until they<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;get Meditate at 12th, but once there they can do a solo fight that<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;drags them down to 1 bar of HP; and be back in another fight in 7-10<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;mins.  For a corresponding warrior, it would be 13-18 mins, or more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The game isn&#39;t based upon solo play, and after about 20th lvl you<br/>
&gt; basically can&#39;t solo.  So whats it matter if a 12th lvl paladin has a few<br/>
&gt; minutes quicker recovery at LOW level.  I never fought solo past about 9<br/>
&gt; anyways.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Lay On Hands is the Panic Button; you can push it to get out of jail,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;or at least, have more time to either finish off the mob or run for<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;safety. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree with you there.  But at high 20s anybody can go get a pair of<br/>
&gt; Jboots and have a continual free non-class specific get outta jail free<br/>
&gt; card.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;As for the spells being 9 levels behind, so?  Paladins are<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;fighter/healers, while Clerics are healer/fighters.  Clerics can be<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;mini-tanks up until about 9th or 10th; but Paladins can tank all the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;way to 50.  The ability to tank and still have a reserve to compliment<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the party&#39;s cleric is useful.  Past 10th, Clerics are 80%+ casters for<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;all realistic intents and purposes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Paladins don&#39;t have the HP of a warrior, so they can&#39;t tank as long.  They<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have their dodge/parry/reposte are several levels behind a warrior,<br/>
&gt; meaning they never get those skills as high as a warrior of the same<br/>
&gt; level.  Add that in with their lesser HP and there is a huge difference.<br/>
&gt; Ok, so the paladin can help heal himself after a fight.....whooptee, if he<br/>
&gt; were a fighter he wouldn&#39;t have so much to be healed anyways.  not like a<br/>
&gt; 25 point heal at 25th lvl is going to do much anyways.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Paladins don&#39;t get Kick; but at 6th they get bash which I personally<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;like much better.  Kick won&#39;t interrupt casting, while Bash will.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;stopped using Kick with my Troll Warrior when I got Bash (which let my<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Slam start being much more effective)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve found kick to be almost as good as bash, you&#39;d be suprised at how<br/>
&gt; often a 15 point kick will disrupt a caster.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;If you&#39;re fixated on Dual Wield (which I think you might be, since you<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;mentioned Rangers; and they&#39;re the only hybrid, that I recall, that<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;gets Dual Wield); that might explain why you like Warriors and Rangers<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the most.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not fixated on dual wield.  I&#39;m maxed on both my 1h slash and 2h<br/>
&gt; slash, depending on the toughness of the monster I&#39;m fighting I&#39;ll switch.<br/>
&gt; Being able to use both is a tremenous advantage, IMO.  Dual wield fast<br/>
&gt; weapons when fighting yellow or reds, wield hard hitting 2h when whites or<br/>
&gt; blues.  And of course being able to use both means you have access to more<br/>
&gt; of the good weapons.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Personally, I think the jury&#39;s still out on Dual Wield, and on melee in<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;general.  The further up you go, the more the offensive and debuff<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;spellcasters really carry the fight to the mobs; the tanks are just<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;there to do what their name says.  If this is proven out, then Dueal<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Wield or no, the tanks are just there to soak damage.  If this is not<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;proven, then Dual Wield still has to debate against the endless fighter<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;arguements of Dual Wield vs 2H Weapons (which is one of those semantic<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;arguements, IMO; stats bear each out)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; EXACTALLY warriors tank, paladins attempt to tank.  The damage either<br/>
&gt; deals is minimal, both are in the party for one reason....to keep the<br/>
&gt; casters alive long enough to kill the mobs.  So what would be better, a<br/>
&gt; tank that can absorb all the damage with fewer heals required by the<br/>
&gt; cleric, or a semi-tank that requires more heals from the cleric, thus more<br/>
&gt; of a chance the monster will jump the cleric?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;For grouping, I&#39;d prefer to have pure tank in the tank slot, any day of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the week; with a Paladin fighting alongside him.  (my ideal 6man group<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;is 2 Warriors, 1 Paladin, 1 Cleric, 1 Wizard, 1 Bard; haven&#39;t assembled<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;it yet, but it sounds fun!) For soloing, however, the Paladin is more<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;efficient than the Warrior.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2 tanks, why do you need a paladin?  More than 2 fighter types in a party<br/>
&gt; is over kill.  Try to hook up with 2 warriors, cleric, shaman, 2 wizards.<br/>
&gt; Warriors tank, cleric buffs and heals, shaman buffs debuffs and provides<br/>
&gt; backup heals if needed, wizards nuke....works great.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; btw, I&#39;ve only seen 2 shamans that were worth a crap.....they actually use<br/>
&gt; their buff debuff spells well, all the rest I&#39;ve seen spend all their mana<br/>
&gt; on their little frost spell....SHAMANS ARE NOT NUKERS.....bah.....but<br/>
&gt; thats another story....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But to sum up, paladins sacrifice so much melee ability for so little<br/>
&gt; casting ability which completly overlays the clerics role.  Sure, at lower<br/>
&gt; levels the paladin may be better solo, but A)  he levels slower than a<br/>
&gt; warrior, and B) after about 20th lvl you arn&#39;t going to be soloing much of<br/>
&gt; anything anyways.<br/>
