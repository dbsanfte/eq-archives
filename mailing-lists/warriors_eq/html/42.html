<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213156200">As of 6:12 pm Eastern Time we have 116 subscribers to this email list.  So <br/>
far I have seen nothing but &quot;Great&quot; information on the list and only hope it <br/>
gets better.  Keep getting the word out, tell your friends or post on <br/>
warrior message boards.  The more information we get the better.  Warriors <br/>
are the best class, we just have to work a little harder to keep up with the <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
I am a level 11 barbarian warrior princess (some might say an Amazon!) <br/>
currently hunting in Clan Crushbone on Bristlebane.<br/>
<br/>
I have added the links found in warriors_eq email to onelist.com.  You can <br/>
view or add your own links by going to www.onelist.com, signing in, and <br/>
clicking on the warriors_eq list.  Here you will find a bunch of options, <br/>
one of them being &quot;bookmarks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I plan to us two combine long swords when I get to level 15.  <br/>
Not because I know any better, but because it looks so cool.<br/>
<br/>
For the Honor and Glory of Rallos Zek;<br/>
