<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023371109">You don&#39;t have to worry about getting stuck in dungeons either.  Barbarians<br/>
do.  You can enter every building in Norrath.  Barbarians can not enter ANY<br/>
of the buildings in Kelethin that have a single door - we are too wide.<br/>
Hmmm...the game has been out 4 months and we are just finding out about the<br/>
centaur armor.  Could it be possible someone else makes armor for the little<br/>
people and big people?  Nah, Verant would never do that!   Lets just whine<br/>
about not getting the blue plate armor - we are doomed to where bronze or<br/>
steel plate the rest of our lives when the bigger people gets the cool blue<br/>
stuff.   Sorry for the sarcasm - its early Monday and I have to work all<br/>
week :)   It DOES make sense that it is only for medium races, however.  I<br/>
doubt if any of the centaurs are the size of a dwarf or gnome or halfling.<br/>
I think trolls and ogres would have a better argument.  Have you seen the<br/>
centaur that creates the armor??  Huge.  But then again they are evil, so<br/>
they gives a good reason why its not available to them.<br/>

&gt; Yeah, Once again us dwarven warriors get to bend over and take it. We<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; slam, and now we don&#39;t get this new armor either. But, hey, we do have a<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; cool jump animation! We do that awesome tuck-and-roll when we jump! WOW!<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; worth something isn&#39;t it? Isn&#39;t it? *Laughs bitterly*<br/>
