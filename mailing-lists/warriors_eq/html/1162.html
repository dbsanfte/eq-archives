<b>Subject:</b> Warriors vs Wizards <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-819524518">Many of the Warriors here have complained that they cannot do damage as fast<br/>
as a Wizard.<br/>
<br/>
THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO.<br/>
<br/>
Now all of you real life ninjas and steel sword swinging fools just calm<br/>
down.  Read carefully.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Warriors get to wear platemail and have many more hps than a Wizard.<br/>
Warriors also have a higher Offense, Defense, and Weapon skills.  This all<br/>
means that a Warrior can stand toe to toe against an NPC.<br/>
<br/>
Now lets make a Warrior have the same ability to deal damage as a Wizard.<br/>
Now we would have a class that has the best armor, the highest combat<br/>
skills, the most hp&#39;s AND the ability to deal the most damage.<br/>
<br/>
Why would anyone want to play a Wizard if a Warrior could do as much damage<br/>
AND be able to take blows in melee?<br/>
<br/>

PS - When someone says that a Warrior should be able to deal as much damage<br/>
as fast as a Wizard I immediately realize this person doesn&#39;t have a clue<br/>
about game balance.</div>
