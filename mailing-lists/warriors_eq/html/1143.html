There is no way a warrior is going to do as much damage per round as a spellcaster on certains kinds of creatures.  How exactly are you going to do the kind of damage attainable with a fireball against a creature like a hill giant with something like a sword?  You&#39;re only chance is to achieve some kind of critical hit to a sensitive part of the giant...maybe a sword thrust to the gonads or something.  Regardless, I propose the critical hit skill so that a warrior can add more to a group, and have comparable survivability soloing.  Also, I think critical hits should be used like parry/dodge and not like kick/bash, Simply because the assumption is you are ALWAYS trying to do the most damage possible.  With kick/bash you are making a choice of attack. Kick for more damage or bash to stun.  Not that I see any high level warriors bashing...but the option is there.<br/>

Warriors will never be able to out damage a mage. However, the warrior should be able to last a lot longer in physical combat.  I do see that taking effect in the mid-teen levels, and I can only assume it gets better.  But the hybrids can take nearly as much melee punishment and deal out nearly as much melee damage, and supplement combat with spells.  The warrior is outclassed in every respect by a hybrid at a comparable level, in the mid-teens.  Clerics are very powerful in every game I have played but are always not very popular classes to play. Not sure why this is, but in EQ the 1-10 levels are tough on a cleric.  But after that I see them really romping.  It seems to me most clerics I have seen group out of convenience rather then necessity.<br/>

    Ok...sorry....should have added on to that. The critical hit is nice, although I can definetly see monks getting that as well since they pretty much are supposed to know all the nerve points and such on a body. Also....let&#39;s try this on for size. Warriors need to get a BIG bonus on damage, not just every other round or so. We are fighting machines. Why, if I am level 45, should I not be able to be trained so well that I attack 6 times in one round? I know my sword, I know my enemy, and I know where to hit and how many times. I think we should get more attacks, more damage, AND critical hits. We should at least be on damage somewhat compareable to a spell caster. People are going to argue....&quot;But they use magic! How can a sword stroke compare to the Art?&quot; Well...when I take my 2-handed sword and chop off someone&#39;s head before you even get one syllable of a spell out of your mouth, the argument will be over. Lets face it...an object is an object. Sure a lightning strike MIGHT hurt more than getting hit with a double bladed axe right in your groin, but I personally have never been struck by either so who am I to say? It just seems to me that I should be able to hurt someone with a physical weapon actually hitting them just as much as someone hurling balls of fire at them. Grrrr.....this point is getting frustrating.<br/>
