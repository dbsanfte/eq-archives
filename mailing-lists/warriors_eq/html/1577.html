Humm, ova past few days o hunting me thinks dere be certain places peoples can<br/>
safely hunts.<br/>
<br/>
Fer da under twenty crowd da corriodor leadin in up to the fire room be<br/>
safe.,Jes member that if it runs ta corner an<br/>
goes poof it&#39;ll reappear at top o ladder an start goin down an proally bring<br/>
some friends back.. On way ta fire room in<br/>
the corridor one spawns at zone wall, two at area where ya turn, one at bottom<br/>
of ladder, at top of ladder, in an alcove<br/>
jes near ladder top an one straight down ta fire room.<br/>
Mix of under 20 an lil ova 20 can pull ta fire room, or do flag room. In fire<br/>
room two spawn, slowly but they spawn.<br/>
From fire room to flag room three spawn on the way there. No memba place<br/>
exactly. In flag room three spawn up front,<br/>
Two to left archway an one to right archway. Through archway in back two spawn<br/>
there. To tunnel ta right one spawns<br/>
near there usually a caster, but not always. Through tunnel on right by gate<br/>
three spawn, one usually a caster.<br/>
<br/>
Through archway to left is a door. Two spawn in that room an at bout 20 they be<br/>
blue. Either they be regular gobbies<br/>
or one be caster.<br/>
Through double doors to right is another good place fer 20 or lil over. Now me<br/>
say lil over because if you have to run ya<br/>
gotta go through the flag room if ya get in trouble. Two spawn there.<br/>
From that room there is a door that leads to the achiologist (proally spellin<br/>
wrong) Three spawn afore you get to<br/>
archiologist. Usually got evoker or a diviner amongst the three. The<br/>
archiologist room. One spawns to the right, Three<br/>
on stage, one on bridge. Under bridge be two that spawn that ya can see, Under<br/>
bridge to left usually three that<br/>
spawn. The archiologist room hard to clear. Is obtainable with mix of low/mid<br/>
20&#39;s but because of the one ta three<br/>
casters is dangerous.Spawinin from what m can see happens in threes in the<br/>
room. Archiologist will spawn on stage<br/>
near a pedistal lookin thing.<br/>
<br/>
Now instead o going ta the door if you go down hallway there be preacher room.<br/>
Two spawn against wall, Three on<br/>
stage (preacher in middle). Three spawn behind the stage. Again there be<br/>
casters that spawn.<br/>
<br/>
From the flag room go through the right tunnel through the gate to end of that<br/>
area an ta left be a movin boulder. That<br/>
be alchemist area. Ya gotta fight ya way through an is tough. Most everythin<br/>
blue ta me at 24. If ya not careful ya be<br/>
in spot where three near gate will come through gate. Total of bout 5-6 spawn<br/>
behind gate. Usually a preist an caster<br/>
among dem.<br/>
<br/>
Critter Observations:<br/>
Regular gobbies - hee hee no problem.<br/>
Diviners - ouchers! even if they green they hurt. Kill off one of first<br/>
Preist an prelates will heal everythin around dem so get them too or ya gonna<br/>
have tough battle.<br/>
Wizards - kinda same as Diviners<br/>
Preacher an Archiologist blue ta me at 24. Preacher will heal itself (wot a<br/>
pain).<br/>
<br/>
Is really not bad, jes gotta know where ta hunt fer the level ya at. One thing<br/>
me thinks when ya hunt there is that it<br/>
not very crowded hunting place. Ya gotta keep in mind the route ya gonna run<br/>
through ta zone. Ya may have an area<br/>
clear but when ya go ta run ya gonna have lotsa critters ta run through. So it<br/>
may be borin ta do the flag room, but if<br/>
ya get in trouble there fewer critter ta run past ta go ta zone. M&#39;thinks dat<br/>
be the key ta huntin there tho *shrugs*<br/>
<br/>
Well, that all me can member bout that area.<br/>
<br/>
Me sure someone can add mores stuff to dis... But me thought at least gives<br/>
folks idea about place an where ta hunt<br/>
in dere.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Can anyone provide any information concerning this place.  I spent a few<br/>
&gt; hours there last night and had a very very good time.  I am concerned about<br/>
&gt; pitfalls/traps and things like that.  I have explored a good portion of the<br/>
&gt; upper floor around where the ice goblin is in the block of ice.  Beyond<br/>
&gt; that, I know nothing of it.  If you have any information (no spoilers)<br/>
&gt; concerning the existance of pitfalls/traps and such, please let me know.<br/>
&gt; Would hate to get a corpse stuck somewhere that I can not get to.<br/>
