<div id="ygrps-yiv-253935252">FYI:  I sent a letter to Brad this morning with the results of the petition.<br/>
Overall there were over 1600 votes.  Roughly 1400 For and 200 Against.  Even<br/>
if Verant doesn&#39;t like the petition.  I think there is plenty in the<br/>
comments for them to see what people are wanting or not wanting.<br/>
<br/>
There were a lot of monks complaining that if this was done warriors would<br/>
be better than them and wah, wah, wah.  Anyway, hope everything turns out<br/>
well.<br/>

&gt; &gt;If they actually did that to the warrior class, let them advance<br/>
&gt; 6 a &gt;lvl,<br/>
&gt; &gt;there would be no stopping them.  Some of you may not want to &gt;see this,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but at gameznet.com/eq there is a new post about the &gt;success at duel<br/>
&gt; &gt;wielding and double attack.  With all these updates &gt;you guys<br/>
&gt; would nonstop<br/>
&gt; &gt;4 hit attack. Now, I see how as of right now &gt;the warrior are worse than<br/>
&gt; &gt;the SKs, pallys, and rangers.  But if you &gt;do much to the<br/>
&gt; warriors you guys<br/>
&gt; &gt;will be able to blow us away.  I&#39;m &gt;a troll SK and my guys is mainly a<br/>
&gt; &gt;warrior with a few spells.  If you<br/>
&gt; &gt;do all these things you people have listed to the warrior class then<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;warriors will be a super class, be reasonable.  Ask for some small<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;changes.  Not letting their skills increase at 6 a lvl and go<br/>
&gt; up to &gt;300<br/>
&gt; &gt;AND ask for weapon specialization.  A warrior would outdamage a<br/>
&gt; &gt;gd WIZARD!<br/>
&gt; &gt;  You people are crazy if you except them to make that &gt;kind of change.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; hehehehehehehe<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hummm let&#39;s see.  If I hit 4 times in one round for, oh let&#39;s go<br/>
&gt; for broke,<br/>
&gt; say 25 points each [some super magic 1H sword from h*#l] = 100 points.<br/>
&gt; Wizard with comet spell, one turn = 1500 points.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Geez, all we are asking for is wpn specialization and skill cap<br/>
&gt; at 250 or so<br/>
&gt; like the other classes already have in their unique skills.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; note: Verant has already made many changes early on in other classes.  Us<br/>
&gt; warriors only waited until now to ask for a couple of small additions.<br/>
&gt; Warriors will always have to group at higher levels, tis the<br/>
&gt; nature of being<br/>
&gt; a tank.<br/>
