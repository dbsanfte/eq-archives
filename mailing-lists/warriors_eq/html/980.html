<br/>
Really sorry to hear about that...i know how that feels all to well, The<br/>
other day My guild was killing sand giants in the oasis and i was in the<br/>
background watching with my cleric and throwing in the occasional heal..when<br/>
all of a sudden a second giant decided to jump in and help his brother.<br/>
needless to say my senses were knocked out of me and strewn all across the<br/>
Dunes. Sigh there is nothing more embarassing than having a giant sneak up<br/>
on you!<br/>
