&gt; &gt; My opinion on the 1hs vs 2hs is this.  Warriors need<br/>
&gt; &gt; both.  For blue mobs the only way to fly is 2 handed<br/>
&gt; &gt; with double attack at higher levels.  You hit very<br/>
&gt; &gt; often for high damage, and with double attack you are<br/>
&gt; &gt; a devastating hack&#39;n&#39;slash machine.  For higher level<br/>
&gt; &gt; mobs that con yellow or red, the 1 handed weapons<br/>
&gt; &gt; shine because of their speed.  You are not going to<br/>
&gt; &gt; hit high level mobs as much, so having 50% more<br/>
&gt; &gt; swings gives you a better chance to do damage, even<br/>
&gt; &gt; if you do less damage...some is better than none.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I see three main points to focus on when considering the weapons and<br/>
&gt;associated weapons skills.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(1) High base weapon damage isn&#39;t important, nor is low base weapon<br/>
&gt;delay.  What is important is the ratio betwen them; divide weapon base<br/>
&gt;damage by the delay and you get a (I round to three decimal places)<br/>
&gt;..xxx number that you can use to compare the weapons with.  So one<br/>
&gt;should consider the ratio, not the high base or low delay.  In the<br/>
&gt;ratio number, a higher weapon is more efficient than a lower number.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you&#39;re wondering, the number indicates the efficiency of the weapon<br/>
&gt;over time.  I don&#39;t have my notes with me (they&#39;re at home, and I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;feel like plowing through the sites to recover the data again), for a<br/>
&gt;1H-Slash weapon, a number in the .220 - .270 range is good.  For a<br/>
&gt;2H-Slash weapon, the best have numbers over .300.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(2) However, this number holds theory to reality only if every hit<br/>
&gt;connects; which all Warriors and hybrid warriors know isn&#39;t true.  When<br/>
&gt;misses are factored, the number&#39;s reality changes somewhat.  Now, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;hard to work up theory from the abstract randomness of combat in EQ;<br/>
&gt;but I personally ascribe to the theory of more chances to swing equals<br/>
&gt;more chances to hit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d rather swing three or four times (double attack/dual<br/>
&gt;wield/(bash/kick)) than one or two times (double attack/(bash/kick)).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, I feel there is some credence to the situational modifiers that<br/>
&gt;have been put forth with regards to the 2H-Slash vs Dual Wield<br/>
&gt;arguement; meaning this.  Against tough monsters (yellow/red), go Dual<br/>
&gt;Wield to maximize hit chances; and against easy monsters (blue/white),<br/>
&gt;go 2H-Slash to maximize damage.  In yellow/red, you have lower hit<br/>
&gt;chances, but more swings to even it out.  Against blue/white, you have<br/>
&gt;fewer swings, but higher hit chances, so it evens out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The other situational modifer that seems logical is grouping vs.<br/>
&gt;soloing.  When soloing, I&#39;d tend to follow the above paragraph only.<br/>
&gt;When grouping, the arguement of going 2H-Slash seems to have great<br/>
&gt;weight; you can afford misses in tough fights when grouping, because of<br/>
&gt;healer and caster support.  However, I ultimately reject this; and<br/>
&gt;advoctate following the above paragraph exclusively for all weapon<br/>
&gt;selections.  What makes sense for successful solo weapon selection<br/>
&gt;would make sense for group weapon selection as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(3) Slots for enhancement.  Because of magically enchanted items in<br/>
&gt;EverQuest, each slot you can place something on your character is a<br/>
&gt;potential buff slot.  Therefore, it tracks to maximize slot use for not<br/>
&gt;only factors like weight, AC, damage/delay ratio and others; but also<br/>
&gt;for the buff potential one receives from the slot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To put it plainly; except in the case of very buff 2H weapons, you<br/>
&gt;often receive a better total effect, or a better range of effect, from<br/>
&gt;the 2 hand slots (2 weapons, or weapon and shield) than from a single<br/>
&gt;2H weapon.  With low to mid level moderate buffs this isn&#39;t so much of<br/>
&gt;a factor; but when you start talking about rare magic item buff<br/>
&gt;potential, it becomes a significant thing to be considered.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Having said all that, however, my Troll Warrior is keeping both<br/>
&gt;1H-Slash and 2H-Slash up (I&#39;m working up 2H right now, because it took<br/>
&gt;a little while to get ahold of a 2H weapon); so I have my options open<br/>
&gt;for whatever may come my way.  I include the possibility of expansions<br/>
&gt;and new items being introduced that might change the equations.  What&#39;s<br/>
&gt;true now might change with a single patch or expansion pack.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just some thoughts.<br/>
