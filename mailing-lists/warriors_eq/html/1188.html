&gt;Subject: Re: Warriors vs Wizards<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I believe that warriors are necessary in a group only to the high teen-low<br/>
&gt;twenties.  When most hybrid-magic user classes get to that level they can<br/>
&gt;either root, or get a pet that will engage the creature while he or she<br/>
&gt;casts (wherein they usually don&#39;t need long because they deal out the most<br/>
&gt;damage).  I am a lev 17 warrior and blue cons can take me down to 1/3 hp,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you mistaken or just flat out lying?  It does not take close to 30<br/>
minutes for a lvl 17 warrior to heal up.  And if you grouped with a healer,<br/>
you wouldn&#39;t have to wait.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be offensive, but warriors cannot solo due to the time it<br/>
takes to recover hp&#39;s.  This is part of the design of the game.  The higher<br/>
level you get, the harder it will be to solo.  Some classes will be able to<br/>
solo longer than other classes, but eventually, every class will be forced<br/>
to solo.<br/>
<br/>
And if you are only level 17, how do you know what is necessary in groups<br/>
above the mid-20&#39;s?  Many people on this list state that a warrior or two is<br/>
a needed part of a high level group.<br/>
