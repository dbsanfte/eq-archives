<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550733385">Now I&#39;m 33, and at 32 I hit for 53 max... still have yet to see more <br/>
then that with this dam BBC that I have to get rid of... hehe<br/>
<br/>
    As for warrior... well at 33 I have 930 or so hps... not sure exactly, <br/>
hehe... and well warriors are good with a group, but if you cant find a <br/>
group you might as well log off :( or camp something super easy.<br/>
    At this level, warriors are more equipment dependant then any other <br/>
class, maybe tied with Rogues.  So to be a good warrior, you have to have <br/>
the best stuff you can get at your level, otherwise your usefulness to a <br/>
group is limited.<br/>
