<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409855346">u will never see a barbed whip for 50p, becuase of its rareness and stats dont expect to pay no less then a 100p.. the polished grantie tomahawk is better 6dm 26delay and casts beserker strenght which gives you +20str and a damage sheild but it gives u -10ag. You can find those in Highold<br/>
from a NPC gnoll named grenix he is only 22-23.<br/>

&gt; Barbed Leather Whip is from Najena, not Befallen.  And ya, 20 is a bit to low, good group of mid to high 20s is good.  Barbed whips are rather rare, but I have seen a couple people selling them, in the 50pp range, but neither of these people were in Najena when they were selling them.<br/>

&gt; Barb Warrior looking up at 20th from close range, looking to upgrade<br/>
&gt; dualign weapons.  Got a pair of mino axes, which are nice, but heavy and<br/>
&gt; slow.  Seen the stats on the Barbed Leather Whip and it looks perfect.<br/>
&gt; I know it&#39;s from befallen, but most likely in an area I can not get to.<br/>
&gt; Is it possible to find these weapons for sale inside this zone by higher<br/>
&gt; levels just selling off there loot for weight?  If so what is a fair<br/>
&gt; price for one? Also what are some other good dualing weapons? heard of a<br/>
&gt; crystaline sword that sounds just sweet, but no idea where that one<br/>
&gt; comes from.<br/>
