<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-375443300">ROFL!!! This is me in a nutshell ... except you forgot a couple of parts...<br/>
<br/>
- Compiles a full blown notebook of EQ info printed from the web with a huge<br/>
stck of paper on the company high speed laser printer. Take home and think about<br/>
doing another one to reference at work ...<br/>
- Talk 3 people at work into playing EQ. They become just as addicted as me. We<br/>
all milk each other though the bleary eyed first hour of work, dinking caffeine<br/>
to help restore a seriousack of sleep.<br/>
- Talk several customers (mostly techies) into playing EQ while I&#39;m installing<br/>
their new equipment at their site.<br/>
- Seriously consider a second account for &quot;those times when I just don&#39;t want to<br/>
be myself ... but have help from myself&quot;<br/>
- Actually start dreaming of those female PC&#39;s from EQ. (Hey ... is it just me<br/>
or do some of them look damn good?)<br/>
- Put off every errand I&#39;ve had to do for the last month until after Christmas<br/>
sometime .... if I&#39;m not busy.<br/>
- Started going home for lunch so I can make a quick plat or two.<br/>
<br/>
If you are pathetic then I am too....<br/>
