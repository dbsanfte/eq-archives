<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445582042">What is the difference between Slam and Bash?  I have been bashing everyone <br/>
like crazy trying to get it up to the same level as my kick, and now I find <br/>
out that I might be wasting my time.  I am a Barbarian Princess, so slamming <br/>
people around is right in my league, but just what is the difference?<br/>
