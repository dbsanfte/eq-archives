<br/>
The game is about balance. Some people are saying that a group of really<br/>
high levels do not need warriors. I say thats BS my friends always want my<br/>
warrior in their group. Not just becuase im company mind you. Because they<br/>
are spell casters. If im not there, the MOB would latch onto them and<br/>
interrupt their casting. <br/>
<br/>
Sure we could beg verant for one more skill .... critical hit , which is a<br/>
very good idea. And i like the idea of it being like ripsote and parry.<br/>
Makes more sense. But the fact of the matter is this: We are there to<br/>
prevent our spellcasting buddies from being hit by creatures so that THEY<br/>
can dish out the damage. I have never had anyone complain to me and say look<br/>
man we dont want you in the group anymore cause you doont dish out the most<br/>
damage. <br/>
<br/>
Every group needs a good strong warrior.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many of the Warriors here have complained that they cannot do damage as<br/>
&gt; fast<br/>
&gt; as a Wizard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now all of you real life ninjas and steel sword swinging fools just calm<br/>
&gt; down.  Read carefully.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Warriors get to wear platemail and have many more hps than a Wizard.<br/>
&gt; Warriors also have a higher Offense, Defense, and Weapon skills.  This all<br/>
&gt; means that a Warrior can stand toe to toe against an NPC.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now lets make a Warrior have the same ability to deal damage as a Wizard.<br/>
&gt; Now we would have a class that has the best armor, the highest combat<br/>
&gt; skills, the most hp&#39;s AND the ability to deal the most damage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why would anyone want to play a Wizard if a Warrior could do as much<br/>
&gt; damage<br/>
&gt; AND be able to take blows in melee?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wayne<br/>
&gt; PS - When someone says that a Warrior should be able to deal as much<br/>
&gt; damage<br/>
&gt; as fast as a Wizard I immediately realize this person doesn&#39;t have a clue<br/>
&gt; about game balance.<br/>
