<div id="ygrps-yiv-657924506">In RPGs, my heart and soul has always fit that of a warrior.  But, having <br/>
played a warrior to level 12 on Zek, and having suffered countless setbacks <br/>
there, mostly but not exclusively involving PKs (one time 2 yellow wizards <br/>
wiped my level 11&#39;s full hps out in less than ten seconds after rooting), <br/>
I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that warriors are, more than anyone else, forced <br/>
to wear and use the juiciest items to obtain xp while at the same being the <br/>
most vulnerable (after we&#39;ve used our hps to get xp, non-hiders are out of <br/>
options without spell-casting bodyguards) and least dangerous/flexible/useful <br/>
of the classes.  Furthermore, if/when we do get an advantage against an <br/>
enemy, we&#39;re really bad at actually finishing them off (escaping from us with <br/>
impunity is a big option).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard some very encouraging things from some of you more successful <br/>
folks contradicting my conclusions and I&#39;d like to hear more.  I&#39;m not so <br/>
much concerned with the PKers as I am concerned that a party of four wizards, <br/>
a magician and a necro might just be slowed down by a warrior tank (best <br/>
defense = good offense + we seem to suck at offense more than most casters <br/>
w/pets suck at defense, etc.)  Many other classes could fit into that group <br/>
and be less of a drag, I think...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not at all interested in theories or how things look on paper from people <br/>
who&#39;ve farted around like I have to 12th or even 16th level.  I am more <br/>
interested in hearing how things are actually working/not working for us in <br/>
the grand scheme of things before I can seriously committ to trying to make <br/>
my warrior work in this game and on RZ.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
