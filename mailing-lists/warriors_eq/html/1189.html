&gt;<br/>
&gt;But the Warrior does have a limiting factor: Stamina.  Once again, I will<br/>
&gt;draw from my experience in wielding broad swords in real life.  After about<br/>
&gt;3 to 5 minutes of constant fighting, in 100 lbs. of armor guess what, you<br/>
&gt;are wiped out and need to rest a bit.  Just like the mage has to rest while<br/>
&gt;dealing out those spells, we warriors should need to rest after fighting in<br/>
&gt;all that armor and swinging that 3 to 5 lbs. sword around, 9 lbs. in the<br/>
&gt;case of great swords.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Once again, your real life experiences have no bearing on EQ, a fantasy<br/>
role-playing game.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you need a rest every 3-5 minutes because your stamina is much lower<br/>
than that of a troll or barbarian.  Maybe if you spent your whole life<br/>
training to be a warrior, you would have greater stamina.  EQ Warriors can<br/>
fight longer than your 3-5 minutes because they exercise instead of playing<br/>
video games.<br/>
