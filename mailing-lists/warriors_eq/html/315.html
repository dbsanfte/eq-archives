<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787712069">People often think that the troll regen rate makes the the ultimate warrior.  That may be true at first, but at later levels you get to the point where you have to have a healer of some type in your group, or you will die.  And at that point the troll regen is almost pointless.  If you want brute str Ogre is the way to go.  Their str, sta, dex, and agil are much better than Trolls, not to mention ogres have the most points to distribute.  You can easily get your dex and agil above 90 and still have your str and sta WELL above 100.  Ogres are also smarter and wiser than Trolls, so they also make better SKs and shamans....with one exception....trolls regen rate works very nicely with the canabalize spell.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents :)<br/>

Seeing as how you are a troll (good choice) your hp are gonna go up faster<br/>
than all other races which is a bonus cause you want haveto wait around so<br/>
long, my advise to you is to kill rats, decaying skels, syoung water<br/>
mocasins untill level 4 or so. Then if you can find one other level 4 or 5<br/>
char, go for normal froglocks or a weak froglock fisherman....oonce you hit<br/>
5 you can probably solo them as well as the occasion swamp alligator, once<br/>
on level 6 head to guk but dont go in too deep, stik the the larger froglock<br/>
tads and sentinels....good exp for you and the occasional woven/netted<br/>
armor, (which sells great to any monks or spell casters. Oh you can get<br/>
netted off the small froglock tads as well.) then once you hit 10 id suggest<br/>
making your way to the south desert of ro, find a group and kill dercishes<br/>
and orcs, at around 13-15 go for the oasis and kill crocs, caimans, and the<br/>
occasional Deepwater caiman....just watch out for the giants,<br/>
...........after that the rest is up to you.<br/>
<br/>
lemme know if you need any more advise...i have a troll SK so i know the<br/>
area very very well.<br/>

&gt; Hail Great and learned warriors.  I have decided to start playing a Troll <br/>
&gt; Warrior and would like some advice.  All I know now is to grab the first<br/>
&gt; two <br/>
&gt; handed sword I can find and start killing everything in site.  Any <br/>
&gt; suggestions on how to play the largest evil killing machine in Norrath?<br/>
