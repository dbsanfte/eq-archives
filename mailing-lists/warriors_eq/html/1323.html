<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527285182">Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share with you a sweet kill me and my friends got last night.<br/>
We were in Mistmoore and out came the lord himself. There were 6 of us. A<br/>
level 49 cleric. Level 43 warrior (Me) Level 47 Wizard, level 47 Rogue,<br/>
level 49 necro and a level 45 Ranger. We decided why the heck not give him a<br/>
try even tho he conned red to everyone in the party. Well it was quite the<br/>
battle. By far the craziest i have ever seen. In the end only the Necro and<br/>
the wizard were left but somehow they managed to pull it off. I tried my<br/>
best to stay in melee with him and was doing quite well untill the cleric<br/>
had a fizzle. But then it was ouch time. As soon as i went, the Rogue was<br/>
next and followed by the Ranger. The cleric somehow managed to stay alive<br/>
for a while longer but couldnt handle the beating. When i finally made it<br/>
back the necro was at 1 quarter life and the wozard half. Talk about your<br/>
kick ass battle, Ill never forget it. When my friend who was just watching<br/>
sends me the screens, would any one like them?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wrote an e-mail to one of those guys from PPI - the ones who do the<br/>
&gt; great<br/>
&gt; analysis works of classs (see eq-stratis cleric for a sampling of their<br/>
&gt; work). I<br/>
&gt; told him of the things I have been reading here such as a critical strike<br/>
&gt; (which<br/>
&gt; he didn&#39;t think would be accepted), increase what bind wound could do ( he<br/>
&gt; agreed that it should go up to 70-80%), increased skill cap (no comment<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; him) and unique warrior skill (again  no comment from him). His idea was<br/>
&gt; to have<br/>
&gt; the warrior&#39;s  defensives skill be increased some how. That would make the<br/>
&gt; warrior harder to hit and therefore less damage and less down time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am going to try to get him to join this mailing list since I feel he<br/>
&gt; could<br/>
&gt; give great insight. He did say that they were not going to be writing<br/>
&gt; anything<br/>
&gt; soon but said something about how a warrior could be tweeked to make a<br/>
&gt; warrior<br/>
&gt; awsome.<br/>
