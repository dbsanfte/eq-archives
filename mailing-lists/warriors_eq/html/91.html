<b>Subject:</b> A question on kill stealing. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088889191">Hi all,<br/>
I&#39;ve been a roleplayer and a mudder for years now. I&#39;ve come to EQ like<br/>
most of us, with a lot of experience in multiplayer gaming. Now, I&#39;m<br/>
fairly new to EQ (level 8) but I thought I had a good understanding of<br/>
it, and it&#39;s unwritten rules, until now.<br/>
<br/>
The other night I was in BlackBurrow in a small group of 3. Two of us<br/>
were at the bottom level, and I was up top, returning from a town run. I<br/>
saw a gnoll guardsman kill someone, so I ran up to take charge of it.<br/>
There was nobody else around it. After a few hits it fled to the lower<br/>
level with me chasing it every step, hacking and kicking. Upon reaching<br/>
the lower level, there was a mini train already down there, but both me,<br/>
and the members of my group, were working on the gnoll guardsman I had<br/>
chased down. Towards the end of the fight, a fighter type of some sort<br/>
walked up and took the final swing on the guardsman. Thinking I had done<br/>
it ( I had to scroll back to look afterward) I bent over and looted the<br/>
corpse.<br/>
<br/>
The fighter started complaining at once that I was a kill stealer and I<br/>
took his loot. I explained to him that I had chased the monster down,<br/>
and had done the most damage, and therefore the computer LET me take my<br/>
kill. He respnded that HE had chased the monster down from the top (I<br/>
never even saw anyone up top but myself) and had made the kill therefore<br/>
it wasn&#39;t mine to take. I didn&#39;t feel like the argument was worth it so<br/>
I gave up and tried to trade him the loot. He would not accept, but<br/>
instead complained to me via tells that he couldn&#39;t believe I did that.<br/>
<br/>
My questions are:<br/>
1.) Was I ethically wrong to take the loot?<br/>
2.) Does the game only allow the majority damage dealer to take the<br/>
loot, or the final swinger?<br/>
3.) How would you guys deal with this situation?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advice ....<br/>
