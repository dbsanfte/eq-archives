<div id="ygrps-yiv-749999835">All the Bloodstained armour (tunic, mantle and gloves) can be looted off the<br/>
Skeletal Knight who resides in unrest.  He conned red to me at level 20.  He<br/>
has a harm touch of 350hp. He always comes with an entourage when pulled.  I<br/>
was in a level 25 party when we killed him, and our lead tank (a ranger)<br/>
nearly died in the battle (he had a slither of red left).<br/>
<br/>
But I am VERY interested in the SoW ring.  Only item that does the same<br/>
thing this ring you mentioned does, that I know off, are the journey man<br/>
boots.  Looking at getting these with a level 30 party. <br/>
