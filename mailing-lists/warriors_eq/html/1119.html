I have a 2nd char level 7 bard and really enjoy the differences from the<br/>
warrior.� Probably best to check out some bard web pages to get familiar<br/>
with how they do things.� They have very unique skills and it took me a<br/>
while to get an understanding of how they work.<br/>

�<br/>
The bard&#39;s songs are their &#39;spells&#39; or magic.� Most all songs are &#39;sung&#39; -<br/>
that is you scribe them, memorize them and then you can &#39;play&#39; them.� If you<br/>
do not have an instrument equipped, you will be &#39;singing&#39; them.� Some songs<br/>
are enhanced by the use of an instrument and require a specific instrument.�<br/>
Some songs you can only scribe if you have sufficient experience (level) and<br/>
some instruments you can only play when you reach a given level.<br/>
�<br/>
The first instrument you can use is the drum.� Ask around and see if you can<br/>
trade someone your lute or mandolin for a drum.� In any case sell to another<br/>
bard either the lute or mandolin - they are both string instruments and you<br/>
need only one - not both.<br/>
�<br/>
Level 4 gets you the Lyssiera&#39;s Locating song and you can help people find<br/>
lost corpses.� There is not as big a market as you&#39;d expect for helping<br/>
people find corpses.�The newbies who lose their corpses have no money and<br/>
the higher level players who do - often do it in really tough�places in<br/>
zones you have never been too!� That can be quite an adventure - especially<br/>
if you are only level 4.<br/>
�<br/>
Level 5 is a great level to reach.� At 5, you can sing and play with the<br/>
drum Selo&#39;s Accellerando and feel quite invulerable as you can out run most<br/>
anything.� This is great for exploring.<br/>
�<br/>
At 6, you get the song that can heal the whole party. And at 8, you can play<br/>
your lute to enhance the healing process.<br/>
�<br/>
So, I hope that piques your interest in bards -<br/>
�<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I have recently started a Wood Elf Bard character, and I was wondering if<br/>
anyone had any hints on playing her.� I am level 2, and have bought the<br/>
first two spells.� I bought a mandolin and a lute, and have no idea how to<br/>
use them.� Perhaps this comes at a later level?� Any ideas would be greatly<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
