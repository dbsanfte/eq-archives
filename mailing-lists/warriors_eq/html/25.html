<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938762098">Half-elf should wear &quot;medium&quot; size armor - I think.� I got mine by hunting<br/>
for lions with a group of friends (hard to do solo with no armor.)� You save<br/>
the &quot;ruined&quot; lion pelts (and sell the high quality ones) and then find a<br/>
tailor to make you some patch work leather armor.� One of my friends<br/>
developed tailoring skill but sometimes others will offer to make some for<br/>
gp.<br/>

I am not familiar with your part of the world since I spend my time near<br/>
Qeynos and the West Karanas (lion country).� Have you travelled that far?<br/>
�<br/>
Hopefully, soon I will have some patch work to sell :) as I am thinking it<br/>
is getting to be time for some banded for me &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Subject: [warriors_eq] Are there ANY half-elf warriors besides me?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if there are any half-elf warriors out there.� I am level 5<br/>
now and am hanging around with a high elf wizard and a wood elf ranger (Both<br/>
level 8).� We can do some serious damage, but it is tough to know what I<br/>
should be working on since no one else seems to match my race/class.� ANY<br/>
info you can give would be good.� Also, what armor can I use?� I haven&#39;t<br/>
found any near Kelethin of Felwithe that is compatible with me.� Oh well,<br/>
not much near those cities can really put the hurt on me anyway, unless I<br/>
got grouped up on by some Orc Centurions, even they don&#39;t usually stand a<br/>
chance when I fight the one&#39;s that con white to me (or yellow sometimes) and<br/>
I get the alone.� <br/>
