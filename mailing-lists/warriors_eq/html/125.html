<br/>
	I am currently in a party of 4 (average Level 14)<br/>
	and was wondering a nice place to go for <br/>
	experience and loot.  Blackburrow and Paw are<br/>
	a little below our level except for the few spawns<br/>
	of Commanders, Captains, and the Rex brothers<br/>
	but the trains associated with these dungeons <br/>
	and the amount of people camping in them are<br/>
	a huge deterrant.  We have been thinking about <br/>
	tackling the minotaurs in the Beholder Maze or<br/>
	maybe even a trip down to Upper Guk.  Any<br/>
	advice would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
