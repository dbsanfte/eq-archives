<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021978177">Your skills increase each time you use them no matter what the level of your<br/>
opponent.<br/>
<br/>
You can stand over a spawn spot and swing away at rats and snakes for hours<br/>
to build a new wep skill.<br/>
<br/>
Experience points are tied the level of the opponent though.  But they are<br/>
tied to other factors as well.  I can swear that I have killed stuff that<br/>
conned green (lower than blue) and have gotten xp from it.  Why? I have no<br/>
clue - maybe because you get a quota for each kind of mob in a zone?  Or<br/>
something.  I&#39;ll max out on killing young lions which are/were blue and then<br/>
have to slay a pesky bear which is green and get xp off the bear but not the<br/>
young lion, go figure.<br/>
<br/>
As a rule, when I solo, I try not to attack yellows (&#39;...quite a gamble...&#39;)<br/>
or whites (&#39;...looks like an even fight...&#39;) and of course not reds.  I&#39;d<br/>
rather take more easy kills than suffer the heal time between long melee&#39;s.<br/>
But I wonder if the gain in xp is worth it?<br/>
