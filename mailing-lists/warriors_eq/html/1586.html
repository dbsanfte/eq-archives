<br/>
Well, I think if you go on the basis of a person who just entered EQ and<br/>
didn&#39;t have a guild or anyone else assisting... what would actually be<br/>
attainable. I found it much easier to get items and such once I joined<br/>
my guild because of the level mix, but before I joined I had to really<br/>
plan out what I could afford, where to hunt, etc. Some things like<br/>
bronze can be bought by going to zones where the upper level folk go and<br/>
just hang out because some times they are getting a little overweight<br/>
and don&#39;t want to leave their hunting spot. Things like that should also<br/>
be mentioned. Prices for bronze items oyi.. if you are getting large<br/>
seems to be lower but that medium will be a higher prices since it can<br/>
be worn by more races.  Small sizes are of course cheaper. I&#39;m not a<br/>
good one for attaining prices from since most of my armor has been gifts<br/>
(crafted *drools* all from trades and my char&#39;s wedding gifts)<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;      Okay,<br/>

&gt;      If I would have my dream site for equiptment and such<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Level based - what equiptment armor/weapons =&gt; someone who<br/>
&gt;      is wondering what to get at each level(s) could go there and<br/>
&gt;      see.<br/>
&gt;      Stat impoving - say I want to know how to up my stats for<br/>
&gt;      str, agi, dex, sta what weapons/armor/jewelry/misc -<br/>
&gt;      where/who/how to get plus some explinations about how each<br/>
&gt;      stat improvement can improve warrior&#39;s performance.<br/>
&gt;      Quest based - items that can only be gotten through quests<br/>
&gt;      Purchasable items - average pricing<br/>
&gt;      Player Trade/purchased - price should pay for these<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      That site I like for the message board. Get good tips and<br/>
&gt;      such from there.<br/>

&gt;     &gt;      So does the site have everything you need?  Are<br/>
&gt;     &gt;      the items arranged in a good order?  As far as<br/>
&gt;     &gt;      items goes could it be better?<br/>
