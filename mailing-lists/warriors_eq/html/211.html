<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675221167">Not planning on getting myself killed every level.....I was wondering if I<br/>
should expect to max out my dual wield and double attack at this level.<br/>
Some other inquiries have revealed that I am actually ahead of most warriors<br/>
at my level, probably due to the fact that my intelligence is 100 and I gain<br/>
skill points in nearly every fight I engage in.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I noticed is that I gain skills faster solo than I do in a<br/>
group.  I thought it might have to do with the adjustments made to exp gain<br/>
in a group.....may be skill advancement is somehow tied to exp gain?<br/>

&gt;Don&#39;t get your self killed for the sake of getting your skills maxed out<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for that level.  Your skills will advance it may take a couple levels but<br/>
they&#39;ll eventually get maxed out.  If I were to go by your strategy of<br/>
getting my self killed so my skills would be maxed out per level, I&#39;d still<br/>
be 25 working on my reposte skill, I&#39;m almost 28th, so don&#39;t expect<br/>
everytime that you get a new skill that you will have it maxed out by the<br/>
time you make your next level.<br/>

&gt;As far as factions are concerned.....one of the biggest advantages of being<br/>

NPCs drop really nice loot.  Personally I can&#39;t wait till I get high 40s and<br/>
I can walk into freeport and whoop up on some guards (with a good evil party<br/>
of course) :)<br/>

&gt;I am Bael, a warrior of the 15th Order and a dark elf.  At the start of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this level I put 20 points each into dual wield and double attack. I am a<br/>
little over a bubble away from  16 and my skills are now 65 for dual wield<br/>
and 72 for double attack.  My rate of advancement has slowed considerably, I<br/>
am wondering if I should expect to max these at 80 before I hit 16 or if<br/>
that is uncommon.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;If I can max them I will likely get myself killed right before i level up<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in order to buy some more time at 15.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;By the way I am using a combine scimitar and tentacle whip against magical<br/>
 </span></blockquote>opponents and dual mino axes against non-magical opponents.  My max damage<br/>
per round is 79, that is double attacks on both weapons with max damage(17)<br/>
and a max damage kick (11).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;And in reference to others questions about faction.  It is easy enough to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>gain enough faction for the Commonlands vendors to deal with you, just kill<br/>
orcs by the dozens.  I kill every orc I see, pawns, centurions and so on.<br/>
You can get Freeport residents to deal with you by completing the orc<br/>
slashed belt quest repeatedly.  If you do that tho you faction with the<br/>
Paladins in North Freeport will get worse.  It is up to you whether West and<br/>
east freeport are more important to you then North Freeport<br/>
