<b>Subject:</b> anyone on Sol ro server <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061180234">Heya anyone one the Solusek Ro server at all? If so wanna group up with a<br/>
level 29 warrior? If noone is that high i also have a level 12 cleric on the<br/>
server...lemme know im always looking for groups to join. Oh and I just got<br/>
the most amazing sheild for my cleric....it was really really hard to get<br/>
tho.<br/>
<br/>
The sheild is the chitin shell sheild and can be found in the dungeon of<br/>
Guk. You have to kill a Giant Heart spider to get it which is a rare spawn.<br/>
Every 4 spawns or so a giant will spawn so its not that long of a wait, only<br/>
probelm is he is around levl 20. I was in a group of 5 level 15&#39;s and myself<br/>
and we took it on succesfully 4 times. The stats on the sheild are 15 AC ,<br/>
10 resist to poison and it only weighs 4 pounds!!! if you are around level<br/>
20 or so i reccomend going to get it it can be sold for a great price ! plus<br/>
the smaller heart spiders all give great loot! Anyhow, anyone on Sol Ro who<br/>
wants to group up from time to time lemme know. <br/>
<br/>
My warrior is Lothaniel T&#39;Kazz and my cleric is Rayne T&#39;kazz.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; This seems like a common thing latley... I too have been heckeld about<br/>
&gt; taking others loot when I did all the killing.. Sometimes people run and<br/>
&gt; zone and because they started the battle think they should get the<br/>
&gt; rewards...  But after you do all the work and kill it, do the most<br/>
&gt; damage yes you should get the rewards not the coward that fled and has<br/>
&gt; nothing better to do than complain about looseing a few silver.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sounds like a wimp with nothing better to do...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;ve been a roleplayer and a mudder for years now. I&#39;ve come to EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;most of us, with a lot of experience in multiplayer gaming. Now, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;fairly new to EQ (level 8) but I thought I had a good understanding<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;it, and it&#39;s unwritten rules, until now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;The other night I was in BlackBurrow in a small group of 3. Two of us<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;were at the bottom level, and I was up top, returning from a town<br/>
&gt; &gt; run. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;saw a gnoll guardsman kill someone, so I ran up to take charge of it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;There was nobody else around it. After a few hits it fled to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; lower<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;level with me chasing it every step, hacking and kicking. Upon<br/>
&gt; &gt; reaching<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the lower level, there was a mini train already down there, but both<br/>
&gt; &gt; me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;and the members of my group, were working on the gnoll guardsman I<br/>
&gt; &gt; had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;chased down. Towards the end of the fight, a fighter type of some<br/>
&gt; &gt; sort<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;walked up and took the final swing on the guardsman. Thinking I had<br/>
&gt; &gt; done<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;it ( I had to scroll back to look afterward) I bent over and looted<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;corpse.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;The fighter started complaining at once that I was a kill stealer and<br/>
&gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;took his loot. I explained to him that I had chased the monster down,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;and had done the most damage, and therefore the computer LET me take<br/>
&gt; &gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;kill. He respnded that HE had chased the monster down from the top (I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;never even saw anyone up top but myself) and had made the kill<br/>
&gt; &gt; therefore<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;it wasn&#39;t mine to take. I didn&#39;t feel like the argument was worth it<br/>
&gt; &gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I gave up and tried to trade him the loot. He would not accept, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;instead complained to me via tells that he couldn&#39;t believe I did<br/>
&gt; &gt; that.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;My questions are:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;1.) Was I ethically wrong to take the loot?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;2.) Does the game only allow the majority damage dealer to take the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;loot, or the final swinger?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;3.) How would you guys deal with this situation?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks for any advice ....<br/>
