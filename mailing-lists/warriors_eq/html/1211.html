<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483547941">I know how frustrating this is. I was 12 or 13 at the Chessboard in butcherblock<br/>
with about 3 other people,  one cleric and 2 other hybrids . A 13th druid showed<br/>
up and was able to outdamage us and was clearly using us as his tanks while<br/>
taking all of the experience. We asked him if he wanted to alternate kills, or a<br/>
number of other solutions that would benefit us both. But he clearly wanted to<br/>
get every kill he could grab from us, while he took no damage from them. He even<br/>
told us he would leave when he reached 14 so he could get his next rank of<br/>
spells.<br/>
<br/>
So we decided that the next king would get it&#39;s attention and no-one would<br/>
attack it, so when he started blasting it would go for him. He tried training it<br/>
on us and we just kept fleeing from it so it was focused on him. Then he trained<br/>
it on someone on the otherside of the board and stole the kill from them.<br/>
<br/>
If verant is encouraging us to work to gether, the code needs to be changed so<br/>
that the experience goes to the Group that does the most damage, not the<br/>
individual who does the most. This allowed this druid to steal them from us and<br/>
use my party as his shield. If we as a group were the determining factor in who<br/>
gets the xp, then he would not have been able to do this. This would also<br/>
encourage players to form larger groups to overcome problems like this on our<br/>
own and not have to petition them. In this situation we could of outdamage him<br/>
and taken the kills that were ours and he would have gotten frustrated and left,<br/>
or worked on getting a lerger group on his own that would have forced us to<br/>
leave. I&#39;m sure there could be abuses with this rule change, so please let me<br/>
know what they are.<br/>

&gt; I play a 38th halfling warrior on Povar... I have some dam good equipment<br/>
&gt; and am one of the higher warriors on the server... But something happened to<br/>
&gt; me yesterday that I think highlights the warrior classes weakness... I<br/>
&gt; decided I wanted to get that new dragoon&#39;s dirk from Dvinn in Crushbone...<br/>
&gt; So I went there, camped in his room, for those of you that dont know, Dvinn<br/>
&gt; is about a 25th level DE that is very tough.... He spawned and I attacked<br/>
&gt; him... low and behold a wizzie... AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE.... ran into the<br/>
&gt; room, and started blasting him!  Guess what? AN 18TH LEVEL WIZZIE STOLE<br/>
&gt; DVINN FROM A 38TH LEVEL WARRIOR!!!!!  Do I need to say ANYTHING else? btw I<br/>
&gt; was using a zweildahander.... This was the most embarassing thing that has<br/>
&gt; ever happened to me... I&#39;m sitting there in almost full rubicite, all these<br/>
&gt; cool items, everyone is looking at me... and then i have the thing stolen<br/>
&gt; from me by ONE, not a group, but ONE 18th level wizzie......grumbles<br/>
&gt; something about warriors suck and I am ready to cancel my account...<br/>
