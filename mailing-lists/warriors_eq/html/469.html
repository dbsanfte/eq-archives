<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673258797">There is also an ogre camp on the northeast side of the map. About 3 to 5 ogres<br/>
of various sizes and classes. Probably random like the bandits. I did encounter<br/>
one hill giant there once. He was crossing the small mountain between the ogre<br/>
camp and a remote shop that I like to sell loot to. If I remember correctly it<br/>
only took him three hits to pound me into the ground. The lesson here is to be<br/>
careful out there....<br/>
