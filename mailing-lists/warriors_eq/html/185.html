Subject: Re: A question on kill stealing.<br/>
<br/>
I never help unless I am asked to OR the person is most definitely losing<br/>
OR<br/>
after the person has done more than 50% damage to the beast.  Then I go<br/>
hell<br/>
for leather, and pull out so I dont get the last swing.<br/>
<br/>
I also like using my bow to help someone without inflicting the majority of<br/>
damage.<br/>

Another good thing a bow is for is getting faction bumps. As an ogre<br/>
warrior (level 20 CT server) it may be more important for me<br/>
than for most of you. In just two levels of camping on the orcs in HighPass<br/>
(maybe 18 hours total time), the guards and citizens<br/>
of High Pass are now amiable to me, a huge improvement from the glowering<br/>
they stared at. Every time another group was<br/>
fighting an orc, I would simply drop a bow shot into it. This gave me<br/>
positive faction with every kill that was done, and I haven&#39;t<br/>
met a person yet who gets angry at 10 damage going into a level 16-20 mob.<br/>
