&gt; The best advice has been to keep all your skills up.<br/>
&gt;  I regularly use multiple weapons dependant on the<br/>
&gt; situation.  On multiple Mobs I use Painbringer and a<br/>
&gt; Shield of the Slain Unicorn.  This combo causes AE<br/>
&gt; dmg to all mobs to make sure that all focus on me,<br/>
&gt; and the shield (due to my decent agility) adds 14 AC<br/>
&gt; to reduce the amount of DMG I take.  The Monk and<br/>
&gt; casters in our group deal out plenty of damage<br/>
&gt; without the Mobs beating them to death.  If fighting<br/>
&gt; multiple opponents who use damage shields, I use<br/>
&gt; Fleshripper.  Again the AE of the weapon keeps the<br/>
&gt; Mobs on me while I take significantly less dmg due<br/>
&gt; to swinging fewer times while still dishing out<br/>
&gt; excellent dmg.  Finally, if we are fighting a single<br/>
&gt; Mob, I use the Executioner&#39;s Axe due to it&#39;s massive<br/>
&gt; Dmg and the haste effect.  I have even been known to<br/>
&gt; wield BullSmasher due to it&#39;s traditional Dwarven<br/>
&gt; appeal (not to mention the tremendous dmg delay<br/>
&gt; ratio). <br/>

&gt; P.S. I believe the Ykesha effect is DD rather than<br/>
&gt; AE.  Once I get one, I plan to use the Ykesha and<br/>
&gt; Painbringer for the significant non-melee dmg.<br/>

&gt; Well Dual Wielding is good from 13-20. After that 2h<br/>
&gt; Weapons inflict MUCH more damage. Dual Wield really<br/>
&gt; doesnt go off alot until lvl 38+, and by that time<br/>
&gt; you should have an Executionars Axe (DAM 25 DELAY 50<br/>
&gt; procs for Haste). With the exe axe my average slash<br/>
&gt; is around 65 and i have had up to 81 normal and 142<br/>
&gt; crits. However seems almost all the lvl 45+ warriors<br/>
&gt; on my server  without fearplane blades are switching<br/>
&gt; over to DW Short Swords of Ykesha (DAM 8 DELAY 24<br/>
&gt; procs for 79-point Ykesha AE spell). Ykesha swords<br/>
&gt; are hard to come by though, as they are found on the<br/>
&gt; Ghould Lord (lvl 53) in Lower Guk. <br/>
