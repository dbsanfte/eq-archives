<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054401198">They seem to have made the Tentacle Terrors way more aggressive and stronger<br/>
as well.  I am level 21 and they are blue to white to me.  My friend, a<br/>
level 30 ranger was helping me raise my 2handed skill (I just got a BBC)<br/>
with the TT.  He would draw them out (they are green to him) and take all<br/>
the blows.  They would consistently reduce him to one bubble and myself to<br/>
half my hit points. <br/>
<br/>
The day before they were a piece of cake, now there killing machines.<br/>
<br/>
They seem to have changed the linking also with the bonecracker.  It used to<br/>
be you could pull the BC and the two necros would not come (as long as they<br/>
were green to the puller).  Now they all come no matter what.<br/>
<br/>
AND finally blind spell pulling no longer works either.  If you target a<br/>
mob, then run to another room (i.e. the mob cant see you) you could cast a<br/>
spell and the mob would come running.  This no longer works.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would share that with you all.</div>
