<br/>
FS long sword 5 28<br/>
Combine long sword same as FS<br/>
Barbed Whip 7 28 <br/>
<br/>
There is no sta skill, this is one of your character stats.<br/>
<br/>
If you think kicking is tough on your stamina, try it with 2 minos :)<br/>
<br/>
Parry will go up, if you only put 3 points into it, it will take it a little while before it starts to go up.<br/>
<br/>
Banded is far better than blackend or ring.  Blackend is lower AC and much heavier than ringmail.....but it does look cool :)  which is why I&#39;ve a got a full set myself :)<br/>
<br/>
ps.  to me, the point of dual wielding it to get a large number of attacks.  Wielding a weapon with the delay of a good 2h sword kinda defeats the purpose.  Not to mention that your dual attack is based in part on the speed of your primary weapon.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, the mino is a GREAT weapon for 1h slash, but when you hit 15th and get double attack and dual wield there are much better weapons to be used, IMO<br/>

  When I get Duel Weild I&#39;m prob. going to go with the best Mino. Batlle Axe <br/>
couse it does a wooping 8dmg/35delay and with my secondary wepon I&#39;ll prob. <br/>
use a Fine Steel Long Sword OR a barbed whip OR a combine long sword.<br/>
<br/>
P.S Could someone please tellme the specs. on the Fine Stell Long Sword, <br/>
Combine Long Sword and Barbed Whip?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  How do you cheack my skill in sta. and how do I get that skill up.<br/>
<br/>
P.S I also found that using kick often in a row draws your sta. down, but if <br/>
you use bash is dosn&#39;t seem to bring sta. down as much as kick.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve just got Perry skill and put 3 skill points into it.  Is this <br/>
automatic and I&#39;ve never seen it been used.  Is this skill even working and <br/>
is the skill going up?<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve just gotten Blacken Armor and replaced it with my banded and ringmail <br/>
armor!  Man, the weight is so much lighter and the AC is much more better!  <br/>
I suggest any lvl 12+ people go to the RiverVale area hunt though goblines <br/>
and get that armor! + is looks so cool!<br/>
