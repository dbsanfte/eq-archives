 </span></blockquote>I do exactly the same thing, and I know why.  Because I don&#39;t want to take <br/>
the chance of going to bed and waking up tomorrow to find my body has <br/>
vanished because such and such time limit has expired.  It&#39;s kind of a <br/>
bugaboo as well, because sometimes when I&#39;m really tired I think, Okay just <br/>
one more monster and I&#39;m off to sleep.  Then that monster ends up killing me <br/>
and I have to spend all this time running back to my body.</div>
