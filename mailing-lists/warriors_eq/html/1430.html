<b>Subject:</b> RE: Why I don&#39;t play a Warrior <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-200092020">Thank you!   That was my point exactly.  I purposefully made generalized<br/>
statements about the cleric class to match the idiotic ones that was made<br/>
about warriors.  If you don&#39;t like playing your warrior, fine don&#39;t play<br/>
him.  But don&#39;t come to the warrior mailing list and start telling us how<br/>
better your cleric is than your warrior. <br/>

&gt; Ok...clerics heal. Blah blah blah....who cares? This is a board for<br/>
&gt; WARRIORS, not clerics. I am sorry if I am offending anyone by saying this,<br/>
&gt; but please keep your cleric opinions to yourselves. If I wanted to hear<br/>
&gt; about the virtues of playing a cleric vs. playing a warrior I would have<br/>
&gt; joined a cleric board. Last time I looked the list was called<br/>
&gt; &#39;Warriors_eq&#39;<br/>
&gt; and had nothing to do with Clerics. If you have fun playing a cleric out<br/>
&gt; there, be down...have all the fun you want. Just don&#39;t tell me that I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; do anything because I am a warrior because even with all your heals you<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t be half as vital in a group as I am. Without a warrior to save<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; arse from getting hit by that 31st level mob you&#39;d be dead in 7 seconds<br/>
&gt; flat...well maybe 10 if you got a heal in there. Bottom line: Don&#39;t come<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; my board telling me I suck, cause it&#39;s gonna tick me (and a lot of other<br/>
&gt; GOOD warriors) off really bad.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Umm...  whoever says this about clerics is stupid as hell<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; At lvl 31 I group consistantly with a cleric.  This class is amazing.<br/>
&gt; If<br/>
&gt; &gt; you think all they do is heal, you are very very wrong.  Their dd&#39;s do<br/>
&gt; stun<br/>
&gt; &gt; (amazing for rogues) and they can heal better than any other class.  I<br/>
&gt; want<br/>
&gt; &gt; to see your two druids heal you to full from 1 bar of life<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also if all you fight is yellows and reds you need to rethink your<br/>
&gt; leveling<br/>
&gt; &gt; process.  Whites and blues are excellent to fight if you are in groups<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; handle large numbers well.  Before you say all clerics do is heal, play<br/>
&gt; one,<br/>
&gt; &gt; or play with a good one.<br/>
