<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932539714">Heya, i just saw this latest addition to gameznet and it looked very<br/>
interesting.  With 18dmg, 39 delay, and glowing like a greater<br/>
lighstone, this two handed sword is calling to be my replacement for the<br/>
AGI stealing BBC. Thing is though, the website only said it would be<br/>
found on a roaming barbarian in everfrost. Does anyone know which<br/>
barbarian has it?  My drow warrior is already KOS there, so it&#39;s no big<br/>
deal if i kill a few barbarians :)<br/>
<br/>
To John - I didn&#39;t catch you on last eve.  Hopefully tonight after work<br/>
we can get together and share stories.  I was in Guk and Cazic but I&#39;ll<br/>
go anywhere really :)<br/>
<br/>
Nick</div>
