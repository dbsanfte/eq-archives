<b>Subject:</b> Ad&D and EQ - Argument on Warriors <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081264951">One thing,  in AD&D (which eq is obviously influenced by) the amount of<br/>
damage a Ranger could do was only slightly inferior to a warrior (and that<br/>
wasn&#39;t until later levels).  The penalty that AD&D used was the experience<br/>
table, and rangers got skills a little later then Fighters.  Otherwise they<br/>
were nearly identical in offensive power.<br/>
<br/>
In defensive power the fighter was superior.  He could wear plate and had<br/>
more hp.  <br/>
<br/>
Using AD&D as a reference if you buffed up the offensive power of a warrior<br/>
then you should for hybrids as well.   The defensive power should be<br/>
addressed thou.  I dislike the magic plate mail loop hole, robbing warriors<br/>
of some of their defensive power.<br/>
<br/>
When you compare the warrior to the ranger in AD&D the differences are<br/>
nearly wholly defensive power.  Fighters got one extra specialization slot<br/>
(which meant an extra attack) at later levels which in EQ terms equals the<br/>
higher attack/defense ratings as well as they get the skills a lot earlier.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I mention it is that people are bringing in their own views<br/>
of what the warrior should be like and using literature or other RPG&#39;s to<br/>
back them up (the vorpal wielding warrior comes to mind).  I think if you<br/>
take a closer look at well researched and established games the warriors<br/>
advantage over the sub classes has been defensive more then offensive</div>
