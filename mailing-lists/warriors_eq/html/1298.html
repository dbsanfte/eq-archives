<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072341294">Note: I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THIS - However I am posting this for <br/>
discussion.  I agree in weapon specialization, that is picking one weapon <br/>
skill to increase damage, etc.  Not these kinds of specialization.  I picked <br/>
a warrior so I wouldn&#39;t have to think to much, might be ok for a monk since <br/>
they are suppose to think a tad, but heck - I am just a poor barbarian <br/>
princess that lost her combine longsword (long story, don&#39;t ask!)<br/>
<br/>
Treynon on EQVaults posting board brought up a list of specialization<br/>
suggestions for Warriors:<br/>
<br/>
Monk and Warrior Specialization Skill Version 1.0<br/>
<br/>
Background:<br/>
<br/>
Monk - Human only and honed in the arts of war, this class serves as one of<br/>
the few fronts men who war against evil. However, it<br/>
comes with a severe monotonous feeling of only using his fist, special<br/>
attacks and light armor (not to include carry very little tohelp one?s AC).<br/>
<br/>
Warrior - Almost ever race have warriors in their ranks and these are the<br/>
&quot;muscle&quot; of any army. They are weapon masters and<br/>
are glorious in their shiny armor and unique weapons. Having the most hit<br/>
points (not very impressive considering a high level<br/>
wizard can toast a high level warrior quite easily) and best damage when<br/>
using a weapon of their choice.<br/>
<br/>
Nature of Specialization:<br/>
<br/>
Hybrids vs Pure Tanks - It comes to many high level characters that the<br/>
hybrids overpower the pure tanks. This is not to say that<br/>
most warriors and monks have completely no skill whatsoever but it is just a<br/>
fact.<br/>
<br/>
Casters vs Pure Tanks - In the world of LAG, tanks have a really hard time<br/>
chasing casters to take them down. Some of this new<br/>
skills will help ease this conflict as to disallow utter bullying of the<br/>
tank class.<br/>
<br/>
Specialization Skills (5 total, same as those with casters):<br/>
<br/>
Rules - All skill can reach a max of 50 but then the warrior or monk has to<br/>
decide which he or she wants to go with for the rest of<br/>
the character&#39;s development.<br/>
<br/>
Critical Hit - This skill allows warriors and monks a chance to inflict more<br/>
damage then usual in a hit (double damage). The<br/>
probability of this happening is determined by the specialization skill. At<br/>
51 points, the chances are 5% and increases every by 1%<br/>
every 10 points to a max of 90% (for future expansion levels).<br/>
<br/>
Enhanced Attack - This skill increases the attack ratings and speed of<br/>
either a monk or a warrior allowing for better hits. For<br/>
every 2 points of increase the attack rating increases by 1, and for every<br/>
50 points of increase the delay of their attack reduces by<br/>
1. At 51, the attack delay is reduced by 1 and attack rating increases by25.<br/>
Enhanced Defense - This skill increases the defense rating (AC) by 1 point<br/>
every 1 point increase in this specialization skill. At 51,<br/>
the AC increases by 50.<br/>
<br/>
Enhanced Resistance - This skill increases the all the resistance of a<br/>
warrior or monk by 1 point every 10 point increase in this<br/>
specialization skill. This helps especially when he or she is destined to go<br/>
against magic, poison or disease attacks. At 51, allresistance increases by <br/>
5.<br/>
Enhanced Recovery - This skill increases the rate of health recovery, along<br/>
side with the original recovery of that race. For every<br/>
10 points increase in this skill, the health regenerates an additional<br/>
point. However, you have to be sitting down to have this<br/>
regeneration to be effective. At 51, a warrior or monk can regenerate and an<br/>
additional 5 points.<br/>
