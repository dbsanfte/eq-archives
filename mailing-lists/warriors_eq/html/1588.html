<div id="ygrps-yiv-362262505">I must agree.  I am a warrior in her 25th season, and generally use my <br/>
langseax of wolves for my 2H weapon (normally get hits in the 40s and once a <br/>
crit of 99), but I get my 1H skills max&#39;ed out for the better weapons I hope <br/>
to get in the future.  It also seems to help my taunt when I am using dual <br/>
langseax 1H swords and taunting, that almost always gets the mob off a <br/>
caster no matter what spells he is using.<br/>
<br/>
So in closing.  Keep your 1H and 2H skills max&#39;ed along with slam/bash and <br/>
kick and keep on fighting!<br/>
