<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404397335">sean, yes you are in the right spot for killing the spiders.....<br/>
<br/>
be warned i was in a group of 6 level 15 chars...and we had a tougher time<br/>
than one would think. First off you have to kill the two spiders you see<br/>
first, yes ther eis two you just cant see the second one untill you walk<br/>
in....drawe them out to where the croc is....so no other spiders jump in on<br/>
you . when you dipsose of them, go to where they were and hang a right.<br/>
youll see a larger heart spider and a normal one. Gotta kill them both as<br/>
well. The larger doesnt give you the sheild tho, you have to sit and wait<br/>
for the next respawn which will be 2 normal hearts. then kill them, then sit<br/>
there and wait again. THE NEXT spawn will be the greater and a normal heart<br/>
spider, watch out the poison from the greater consues around 250 hp<br/>
roughly....so make sure you got some kind of healer....once you kill it,<br/>
whoever loots the body will get the shield itself.<br/>
<br/>
Once more the spawninggoes like this.<br/>
Larger/normal........./normal/normal..............greater/normal...........n<br/>
ormal/normal..........repeat.<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Oh the Giant is about level 18-21 and normal heart spiders can be from 11 to<br/>
15.<br/>

&gt; John can you help me out with this question?<br/>
&gt; I am about to hit lvl 13 and was thinkin about trying for the chitin<br/>
&gt; shield.<br/>
&gt; I I get together a strong group do we have a shot?<br/>
&gt; To get to the Spider(s) do you go into the water from the room with the<br/>
&gt; two<br/>
&gt; frogs that spawn that is close to the entrance?  The one where the big<br/>
&gt; croc<br/>
&gt; hangs out?  I&#39;ve seen some spiders over that way, but I was only level 8<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; it looked KINDA dangerous!  <br/>
