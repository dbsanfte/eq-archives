<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-98605937">Well I believe the lore item weapons you will only be able to get one.  You<br/>
will be able to get 1 PGT, or 1 Painbringer, but not two of each.  Also<br/>
Ghoulsbane is Paladin only so you won&#39;t be able to even get one of those.<br/>
Start working on your piercing right now and get a Dragoon Dirk, they are<br/>
better than a combine longsword.  I was able to take out Dvinn with a level<br/>
19 enchanter and get my Dragoon Dirk instead of buying it (I was level 20)<br/>
but you can buy one for around 20 plat.  At level 21 I haven&#39;t seen my<br/>
strength bonus yet.  I have been hitting for the occasional 14 since level<br/>
17 though with a combine longsword.<br/>
<br/>
You may need to check your numbers though.  I have a 110 in Double attack<br/>
and dual wield.  I double attack maybe 75-80% of the time and dual wield<br/>
happens maybe 30%, so 44-48 dmg per round is probably not correct.   You<br/>
really should spend the money now for another combine weapon though.  You<br/>
can solo scarecrows at your level with two magical weapons.  Also if you<br/>
play a large race the magical slam is one of the best skills a warrior can<br/>
have.<br/>

&gt; Hail to thee, I am of the 17th level and right now i duel Weild a Combine <br/>
&gt; Long Sword and a Fine Steel Long sword (both same stats).  Right now I do <br/>
&gt; about 24 each hand and since I am already maxed my level out in duel<br/>
&gt; weild, <br/>
&gt; double attack and 1h slashing, I duel and double attack almost every hit.<br/>
&gt; so <br/>
&gt; thast about 44-48 dmg per round.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve always herd at high levels that you not only hit for 12 (sometimes<br/>
&gt; 13) <br/>
&gt; but more... I&#39;ve never seen this happen to me, when will I start hitting<br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; more?  Whast going on with this area?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; double combine long swords are great, but I need some advise...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think when I hit lvl 20, I&#39;m going to upgrade my weaponry.<br/>
&gt; Do I go for some PGT&#39;s or shold I try and go for some Painbringers or<br/>
&gt; should <br/>
&gt; I even go for soem gnoulbanes? (BTW I am going to duel weild and want 2x<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; weapon)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; at lvl 20, what will be the idle and most level area weapon can I even<br/>
&gt; get?? <br/>
&gt;              Thnx for your time.<br/>
