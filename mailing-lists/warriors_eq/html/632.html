Well I wish that prices were lower too, but this comes natural cus od <br/>
supplie and demand, but Im sure you knew that heheee,<br/>
I just wish that the price was high cus it was a realy hard kill and not cus <br/>
it was very camped<br/>
I have tried to get that damn shiny brass shield for 2 days now but there is <br/>
always some idiot there stealing kills or the trainer just wont have <br/>
it....growl<br/>
Nad im not the kind of person to sit around for ages trying to get an item.. <br/>
Then its better to kill stuff for cash, and a little xp, and buy it of the <br/>
sucker that sat around for 5h trying to get it.<br/>
<br/>
just my 2 cent<br/>

&gt;Back to the tomahawk discussion and one more thing.. I don&#39;t know how it<br/>
&gt;is on all of your servers, but I play on Solusek Ro, and I&#39;m disgusted<br/>
&gt;with the players and people on the server.  People charging 100 to over<br/>
&gt;200 plat for a rare item.  In beta, an item rarely went over 20 plat, and<br/>
&gt;if it did, by that time, you were in your mid twenties in level and could<br/>
&gt;get it without a problem or could afford to pay for it. I am a level 19<br/>
&gt;warrior and also have a level 19 druid, and i do NOT have 100 to 200 plat<br/>
&gt;to spend on anything but the things to keep my character advancing.<br/>
&gt;Spells for my druid and armor for my warrior.  Those people who do have<br/>
&gt;that cash at early levels must have a LOT of time on their hands.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I got my char to almost level 20 in 6 days and 20 some hours.  This isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;that spectaular, but i fight to get experience and i fight well. I work<br/>
&gt;full time and am also a full time student at a university. I do not have<br/>
&gt;the time to run around and kill wisps or whatever people with big bank<br/>
&gt;accounts do. The reason why i want to share the spawn information with you<br/>
&gt;guys is because I hope you will help me in lowering the disgusting<br/>
&gt;inflated prices of the game. Give items to players or sell them for cheap.<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s what I and some good members of my guild do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for reading and hopefully someone knows the info for the tomahawk.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d really love to get one or two for my dual wield.<br/>
