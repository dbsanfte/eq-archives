<div id="ygrps-yiv-105231417">I really hope they are evil and xenophobic like the lizards in CT.  They<br/>
worship and evil god but hate EVERYONE.  Im sure its a racial since all the<br/>
races of norrath with maybe the exception of trolls are demi-humans (they<br/>
all look like modified humans).  I also think it would be cool if they had a<br/>
bank for them in Cazic Thule or some such.<br/>
<br/>
To make up for them being super-evil (i.e. not even dark races like them)<br/>
give them awesome attributes.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
But they do sound pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
And hey, whats wrong with Diablo2?  Im looking forward to it.  Im in a<br/>
dilemma at the moment EQ or Aliens vs. Predator, decisions, decisions.<br/>
sigh, I miss the days of being able to FINISH games.  <br/>
<br/>
Ahhh who am I kidding, I love MRPG :)</div>
