<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179397243">IMHO making the warriors defensive capabilities is just the opposite way to<br/>
go. Warriors are already the best in the game for defense. It&#39;s just the<br/>
offensive part of it that gets me. Since when were warriors only tanks? In<br/>
almost any other RPG I&#39;ve ever played, warriors kicked arse on the same<br/>
level with just about any other class. Lets look at console RPGs for a sec.<br/>
Final Fantasy VII is a perfect example. Sure summons and spells did about<br/>
9999 damage at high levels, but you also had special ATTACKS (called limit<br/>
breaks) that did comparable damage, if not the same. Not to mention that a<br/>
regular attck did about half that damage anyways. But in EQ we don&#39;t even<br/>
get HALF of the damage casters get. A caster comes in and hits a mob for,<br/>
what, 1200? Does any warrior here do 600 damage in the same amount of time?<br/>
500? Hell even 300? that&#39;s not even 1/4 the damage a caster can do. It<br/>
reminds me of playing AD & D in a tournament where I was the only fighter<br/>
among 10 other Wizards. They always came in and blasted everything with<br/>
spells and all I did was take the hits. But guess what? When we got to some<br/>
Drow or something I was the one killing everything since their spells didn&#39;t<br/>
work as good all of a sudden. But even then I could do comparable damage.<br/>
Lets say they cast Fireball...good spell in AD&D. 6d6 +1/level damage. So a<br/>
caster of 20th level can do 56 points of damage with one fireball to a LARGE<br/>
group. But with my +3 Vorpal weapon and girdle of storm giant strength, I&#39;d<br/>
kick his arse in damage. 2 attacks per round my damage all total is 46 per<br/>
round. That breaks down like this: +3 Vorpal Sword is 1d8+3, then my storm<br/>
giant strentgh (24) adds +12 to damage, making maximum damage 23 per attack,<br/>
twice a round. That&#39;s not including the random effects of the vorpal weapon.<br/>
Anytime I get a critical strike (20 on a d20) it automatically chops off the<br/>
opponents head, killing him instantly. I&#39;m not trying to compare the virtues<br/>
of AD&D to EQ, because the last thing the world needs is someone trying to<br/>
clone the rules again. What I am doing is showing an example that the game<br/>
CAN be balanced for each class. The damage a caster gets can blow up an<br/>
entire group (i&#39;ve seen it take out over 30 monsters) whereas a fighter is<br/>
for one-on-one melee combat, but they both can do about the same damage PER<br/>
MONSTER at the same level. Maybe I am just rambling....<br/>
