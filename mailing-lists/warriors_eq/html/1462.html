<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035342968">I wouldnt start heading to Solusek A until around 25 and up.  Maybe even<br/>
higher. I didnt go anyway there until level 30.  Solusek B is much more<br/>
dangerous.  I just set foot inside at level 30 and the first thing I saw was<br/>
red.  May have been bad luck to see a powerful Goblin right off the bat, or<br/>
maybe that is the way the whole place is.  Do not know, I didnt go any<br/>
farther.<br/>
<br/>
As for the demon claw.  You should (I would think) depending on the server<br/>
your on, and how many high level characters are on the server be able to<br/>
pick on up for around 200 - 300 plat.  The shouldnt be for trade only items,<br/>
and they can be obtained around level 32 on your own with a group.  Though<br/>
you DEFINITELY better have 2 clerics and someone at least around level 35.<br/>
The mob is a level 35 SK and has a 800point harm touch from what I have<br/>
heard.  He never got me with the touch.  He also smacks ya around a little<br/>
harder and alot faster than a Sand Giant.<br/>

&gt; What are Demon Claws usually seen going for, or are<br/>
&gt; they also in the -trade only- area (which I hate)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Another good money pit is solusek a.<br/>

&gt; What levels can start working SolusekA, and when can<br/>
&gt; they reasonably expect to switch into SolusekB?<br/>
