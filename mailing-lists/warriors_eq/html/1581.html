<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-694663588">Wow, this email list still lives!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a question for you.  Do you use a site to see what items are<br/>
available?  Which one?  How could it be better?  Do you care about news on<br/>
an items site, or just the items?  Would it need quests listed for quest for<br/>
items, entirely, or just starting point?  List of Mob it comes from?<br/>
<br/>
My reason for asking:  I&#39;m thinking about making one, and if I do, I want it<br/>
to be THE items site to go to.  I&#39;ve actually already got the database<br/>
designed, I just need to work on inputting info and designing the site<br/>
layout.  I could have a preview(not all items) up in 2 days or less if I get<br/>
enough response.<br/>

  I have a 30th level barbarian warrior on Veeshan. I can only tell you what<br/>
I&#39;ve chosen<br/>
  Max out 1hs, 2hs, taunt, kick, slam/bash  and I am working on archery<br/>
(this has helped me take down runners).<br/>
<br/>
  Some have said take up piercing. When you get duel attack and duel weild<br/>
only for the fact that a piercing weapon is faster and will help max these<br/>
skills out.<br/>
<br/>
  I find that 1hs with duel weild is more effective in certain circumstances<br/>
and then 2hs in another. 1hs gives you speed of attack. 2hs is good for<br/>
greatest impact (recently got a crit hit of 100.. now that was sweet). If<br/>
you use a 2hs or 1hs will also depend on your group make up. I do carry all<br/>
my weapons with me so at times will switch depending on the circumstance.<br/>
<br/>
  All my reading and such have said to keep both maxed out. Some reasons are<br/>
the performance of the weapon others for the variety of weapons you can use.<br/>
I didn&#39;t work on my 2hs until I was at the 28th level and it was very<br/>
painful to max it out.<br/>
<br/>
  Good luck!<br/>
