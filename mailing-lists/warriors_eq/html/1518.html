<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583202793">Only thing I would change out is the druid. I prefer a shaman with me.<br/>
Regen (level 24 shaman spell) is one of the most mana efficient ways to<br/>
heal people. A shaman at 24 or above can go almost OOM during the fight,<br/>
then throw regen on the tanks, and the tanks will be 80% or better by the<br/>
time the finger wagglers are FM. And I do agree with Dyvim, until you fight<br/>
with an enchanter, you have no idea of their power. They don&#39;t start coming<br/>
into their true power until level 16. With one spell, they can change the<br/>
odds in a fight. And if you fight something that has a pet, once you kill<br/>
the master, an enchanter can one shot the pet.<br/>
