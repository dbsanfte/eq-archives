<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664360921">I agree, it is kind of rediculous.  But what kind of damage you think you<br/>
would inflict if the blow you hit with was just a glancing blow?  Or maybe<br/>
you just nicked his foreharm or some other non-(too)critical extremety?  You<br/>
wouldnt be hitting a solid blow which should hit for a minimum of the weapon<br/>
damamge.  I think it is fine the way they have the damage set up.  Once you<br/>
get higher in levels, you wont get so many of those lower number damage<br/>
hits.<br/>
<br/>
OK.... Now my 2 cents on what to give to warrior class.  Last time I will<br/>
participate to this thread.  It is getting out of control, and becomes<br/>
boring when by now we have no resolution or agreements.  We do have a few<br/>
who are on the same page as to what needs to be done tho.  (Of course this<br/>
is just my opinion.)<br/>
<br/>
1.  Remove or raise skill caps.  (Or change them all together.)  Instead of<br/>
the standard level * 5 +5 = cap (I believe 200 was the skill cap<br/>
previously.)  Something more like level * 5 +10 = cap This would make a 40th<br/>
level warrior have a skill cap of 210 not 200.  All other clases will be<br/>
only 10 skill points behind.  How much difference does 10 skill points<br/>
actually make at that high of a level?  Also, raise the skill cap for<br/>
warrior to 255.  This would cap out our skills at level 49.  (Who knows what<br/>
the caps will be for above 50 levels with the expansion.)  Personally I<br/>
would be satisfied with removeal of skill cap and no bonuses to it.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Specialization.  (Just like other have mentioned have it akin to the<br/>
mage specialization skills.)  What the advantage is, at skill 51, that is<br/>
your main specialization.  The other skills cap at 50 then.  The advantage<br/>
speed up weapon use and 1.5* damage increase.  Not alot, just giving us the<br/>
ability to inflict a little more damage.  I mean think about it.  I can hit<br/>
for around 49 a slash with a BBC, time and a half on that would be 73 or 74<br/>
points.  Plenty of damage.  Warriors are not ment, never were ment, never<br/>
will be (at least in the EQ world) the main damage inflicting character of<br/>
the game.  This will allow us to more effectively hold attention of mobs and<br/>
possibly even (dare i say it?) solo a little more.  This skill should come<br/>
into play around level 22. This skill should also be checked like<br/>
parry/riposte/dodge and such so it is not an every attack damage deal.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Sleep Regeneration.  When we sit on our duffs to regen health, we should<br/>
have something like meditate for mage classes.  All it does is time and a<br/>
half our regen process.  Again, that is not alot, but it speeds up our<br/>
downtime.  Pitfall to this skill, the screen goes black, and we can not see<br/>
a thing.  We also have a 2 round penalty to &quot;wake up&quot; from our sleep.  This<br/>
is a huge negative to it, which will help promote group playing NOT soloing.<br/>
And should also make it more viable for us as a request.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Increased taunt.  At higher level taunt does not work as well as it did<br/>
as lower levels.  Why?  Because we do not cause enough damage to make the<br/>
mob turn from the mages to us.  Taunt makes the mob think we caused it<br/>
damage, if they increase the amount of damage the mob thinks we cause when<br/>
we use taunt, things will be a little better in regards to using taunt.<br/>
<br/>
These skills are not to off balancing and do not give a huge advantage to<br/>
the warriors over anyone else.  What they do is give us the ability to<br/>
possibly cause a little more more damage.  Raise our attack and defense to<br/>
places that will make us shine a bit more.  Allow us to get off our butts a<br/>
little faster.  And make us the melee class we are supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
Sned me feedback on this, and I will see that it gets into the hands of the<br/>
people who will be able to listen to our requests and possibly give us help,<br/>
or denial or our requests.  At least I am pretty sure I can get this to the<br/>
correct people =)<br/>

&gt; Long time listener, first time caller-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      What does everyone think about possibly giving Warriors a<br/>
&gt; MINIMUM amount<br/>
&gt; of damage done? For example, Im level 16 wielding either a<br/>
&gt; Dwarven 2Hand Axe<br/>
&gt; (best 2hander up until SBH you can get it off Lord Darish in<br/>
&gt; Crushbone) or a<br/>
&gt; Combine LongSword and Tentacle Whip. Most of the time, I hit for<br/>
&gt; 28, 29, 30<br/>
&gt; with the Dwarven 2Hander, but occasionally, I hit for somewhere<br/>
&gt; in the range of<br/>
&gt; 1-10. Personally I think that sucks. Now, what if Verant were to<br/>
&gt; give Warriors<br/>
&gt; a minumum amount of damage they could do? For example, this<br/>
&gt; Dwarven 2Hander is<br/>
&gt; 14dmg 43delay. It would be nice if we could never hit for below<br/>
&gt; 14 with this<br/>
&gt; item. Also, a Combine LS is 6dmg 28delay, so we could never hit<br/>
&gt; for below 6<br/>
&gt; with the Combine LS.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      I think this is a reasonable idea and in some cases would be<br/>
&gt; better than<br/>
&gt; 5-10 damage extra. Just think, NEVER hitting for 1 damage again.<br/>
&gt; I personally<br/>
&gt; think in a realistic sense, a big Barbarian Warrior with 130STR<br/>
&gt; wielding a huge<br/>
&gt; Dwarven 2Hander hitting something for 1 damage is kind of<br/>
&gt; pitiful. What do you<br/>
&gt; all think?<br/>
