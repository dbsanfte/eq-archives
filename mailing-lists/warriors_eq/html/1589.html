<div id="ygrps-yiv-280788293">Taunt is ineffective if your casters are dealing to much damage with spells.<br/>
They do large amounts of damage in a short time keeping a mobs attention.<br/>
<br/>
The reason the 2 hs is better in a group is if the wiz controls himself in<br/>
the early parts of combat you can keep a mob taunted on you the whole time<br/>
because of the damage you are dealing with your big sword.<br/>
<br/>
Then when the wizzie kicks in the heavy damage the mob takes off running.<br/>
So in the perfect combat you take all the damage...cleric only has one<br/>
person to heal...and the group moves on to the next combat faster.<br/>
<br/>
It also helps that you do the pulling as well.  Keep a bow on hand for<br/>
pulling from a distance.<br/>

&gt;I must agree.  I am a warrior in her 25th season, and generally use my<br/>
&gt;langseax of wolves for my 2H weapon (normally get hits in the 40s and once<br/>

 </span></blockquote>hope<br/>

&gt;langseax 1H swords and taunting, that almost always gets the mob off a<br/>
&gt;caster no matter what spells he is using.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So in closing.  Keep your 1H and 2H skills max&#39;ed along with slam/bash and<br/>
&gt;kick and keep on fighting!<br/>
