<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689305709">A good place to get information on weapons would be EQ`Lizer or Everlore.<br/>
Not gonna make it to easy on you and give you the site URLs *grin.  (You<br/>
know where they are already I am sure.)<br/>
<br/>
As far as strentgh goes, with my warrior 128 STR and a BBC I can hit for max<br/>
of 50 at level 32.  The STR bonuses do not kick in until after level 20.<br/>
And even then I do not believe they are fully applicable until level 25.<br/>
When I was grouped with a High Elf Paladin of equivelant level with only a<br/>
100 STR he could hit for approximately 44 or so.  So I do not thing STR<br/>
plays that great of a role in damage.  Its more for carrying<br/>
items/armor/loot.<br/>

&gt; 2 questions for the knowledgable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone have a good list of Warrior weapons and where to find<br/>
&gt; them?  (ie) mob<br/>
&gt; name and zone?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been thinking of traveling a bit with my troll and want to<br/>
&gt; go somewhere<br/>
&gt; to have a chance at a good item.<br/>
&gt; I am level 19<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also: What damage difference between say... an Ogre strength of 135 and a<br/>
&gt; Human strength of 100 make in terms<br/>
&gt; of damage with weapons?<br/>
