<div id="ygrps-yiv-509409703">Wow.  Too emotional man.  Just saying that realistically in the game, <br/>
you have to gang up to camp.  Sorry that you&#39;re a loner.  My guild needs to be equipped too you know.   None of my members are below 18th level, so it&#39;s not bad twinking, we just want a piece of the pie and camping an area is the only way to do it.  If you want a specific item and can&#39;t find buddies to help you camp, raise money and buy it.  Logistically, raising enough money for a item takes just as much time, plus you get xp.  That&#39;s how a player driven economy works.<br/>
