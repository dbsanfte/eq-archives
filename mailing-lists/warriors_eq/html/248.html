<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028991350">I spent rank 10 to 12 in feydwer (the sink hole of Norrath).  Not only is it<br/>
a wholly UNINTERESTING place the stench of leaf-eating tree-hugging wood<br/>
elves was beyond even my formidable senses to withstand.<br/>

OK assuming you can board the boat in Freeport this is how you do it.  At<br/>
the first place the ship stops STAY away from the docks.  The woman wood elf<br/>
guard will board the ship to KOS.  The only thing that saved me first time<br/>
around was the ship moved.  So stay to the left of the ship or on top of the<br/>
high deck.<br/>
<br/>
The Dwarven guards conned dubious to me, so I was able to get off at the<br/>
docks.  ALL other Dwarves conned threateningly and ALL elves were ready to<br/>
attack.  I can not really describe how to get to faydark since I do it all<br/>
by sight.  <br/>
<br/>
Once you enter faydark if you stick to the zone wall and go left you will<br/>
hit Crushbone if you stick right you will hit the other faydark entrance.<br/>
Dark elves are safe in Crushbone.  The gnomes were also neutral to me so I<br/>
could visit their city as well.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

If you are on the MM server I can actually take you there.<br/>

&gt; I have a Dark Elf Shadow Knight in Neriak and am interested in traveling<br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; Feydwer.  How do I get him there without getting killed by guards?<br/>
