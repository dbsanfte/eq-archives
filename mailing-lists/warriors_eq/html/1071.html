&gt; Just a quick note on your revenge list of<br/>
&gt; Fippy<br/>
&gt; Fippy<br/>
&gt; Fippy<br/>
&gt; i hope you are aware that there is a FLIPPY Darkpaw and a Fippy Darkpaw.<br/>
&gt; the first being the infamous newbie killer in qeynos whom i kill everytime<br/>
&gt; i <br/>
&gt; go back there...(i am lvl 24 warrior now) &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
&gt; and the second being a GM of verant who spawns himself up top of <br/>
&gt; blackburrow. Fippy is lvl 17, and if u catch him in a good mood and hail<br/>
&gt; him <br/>
&gt; speaking Gnoll he will actually talk to...<br/>
&gt; i was told this by a apprentice gm one day and i didn&#39;t believe him... so<br/>
&gt; i <br/>
&gt; went and waited in BB after paying 5pp to learn Gnoll..<br/>
&gt; 1day went by and no Fippy<br/>
&gt; 2day and no Fippy<br/>
&gt; and on the 3rd day i just happened to be at the right place and the right <br/>
&gt; time...FIPPY SPAWNED. then after a short conversation he proceeded to kick<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; my butt...<br/>
&gt; Moral of the Story<br/>
&gt; I have no clue but it was neat talking to him..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
