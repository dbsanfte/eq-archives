Thanks for the reply. Im sorry to hear that the list is really slow, but Im<br/>
not surprised.  With so many people, like yourself, achieving the upper<br/>
levels information is abundant in-game.  I guess what Im most interested in<br/>
is hearing from people like yourself who might have a story, a suggestion, a<br/>
pitfall to avoid, a strategy, a nice area to hunt, etc etc.  As a 47th<br/>
Warrior I imagine you have seen just about all there is to see and do across<br/>
Norrath.  Id love to share your adventures, what suggestions you might have<br/>
for those higher level hunts and adventures.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the reply,<br/>
