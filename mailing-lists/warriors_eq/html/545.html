<div id="ygrps-yiv-866679839">This past week I decided to take a break from my level 15 dark elf warrior.  I was abit frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
I started a half-elf warrior in Kelethin.  It is insanely easy to play there.  I made level 5 in about 3.5 hours.  Then I stopped and tried a wood elf ranger.  Has anyone else played a ranger?  I imagine it is the most poorly balanced of all the hybrids.  After 4 hours I reached level 5 and got kick.  I am now 12-18 hours into the character and almost level 9.  I am just as capable as an equivalent warrior.  Next level I gain an array of spells which will boost my combat effectiveness and allow me to heal.  Part of the easy success is the plethora of low level orcs available a stone&#39;s throw from Kelethin.  With my tracking ability I am never at a loss for targets and I can engage blue con orcs in rapid succession or even 2 at a time. I can even engage and successfully beat yellow con orcs more than 50% of the time and almost always can kill orcs that con even to me without trouble. So far it seems that I get as many hit points now as my warrior did.<br/>
<br/>
My point is, with a ranger class as powerful a combatant as it is I see little necessity for the pure warrior.  I am going to play through to level 15 I think, just to see a more even comparison.  My concern is only from a game mechanics perspective though as I have no doubt my playing as a dark elf was a much more rewarding experience.  Has anyone else noticed that the warrior just is not different enough from the hybrid fighter classes?<br/>
