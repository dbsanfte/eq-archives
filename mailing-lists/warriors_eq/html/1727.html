<div id="ygrps-yiv-781738877">Low 40&#39;s is a minimum for a warrior, if you have the save gear, 100 sv fr<br/>
and 100 sv mg UNBUFFED is the minimum anyone should walk in against Nagafen<br/>
with. It&#39;s not recommended anyone under 46 go in against Nagafen though.<br/>
Figure at 42, even with high saves, you will spend most of your time running<br/>
away from him or dead from his breath. Every level over 46  is  roughly<br/>
equivilent to +10 on the saves. Levels and proper classes are most of the<br/>
tactics needed on Nagafen/Vox. You want higher level people there so you<br/>
have fewer people which equals less lag. You need high numbers of warriors,<br/>
clerics, and wizards for a succesful kill. 6-8 warriors, same on wizards, 2<br/>
clerics for each tank group (and hopefully a bard) one for each other group,<br/>
and one or two each on enchanters and shamans for buffs. The more anything<br/>
else you add, the more people will going LD as /shout CHARGE is entered.<br/>
