<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986320905">Careful...rangers are equivalent combatants to warriors, even though some<br/>
skills lag a few levels behind.  The magic you get more than makes up for<br/>
any deficiency.<br/>
<br/>
I did the same as you and now find myself playing the ranger more and more,<br/>
it is easier to level because I only have to stop and rest after 3 or 4<br/>
fights with blues.  I fight, expend mana on heals, and fight over and over<br/>
till mana is gone, then I cast invisble on myself and rest till mana is<br/>
restored and repeat.  I made level 16 in about 2/3rds the playing time it<br/>
took to do the same with my warrior.  and I am comparing in game time<br/>
(/played) not real life time.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have hit the wall I did with my warrior, except this time it is level<br/>
16 and not 14.  Oasis isn&#39;t the hunting ground it used to be on Bertox, and<br/>
I never cared for boring croc hunting anyway.  I am right now touring<br/>
Antonica looking for a new temporary home.  Looks like Highpass will be it<br/>
for awhile. Excellent loot and experience.<br/>
<br/>
Problem is the orc end is so camped with people looking for halberds it is<br/>
hard to get any of the orcs. Wizard item farmers tend to steal kills from<br/>
all but large groups.  Gnolls are good fun though...love smacking those<br/>
doggies around with my shiny brass halberd<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;So far I have to agree with everything on the board.  I am playing a Ranger<br/>
&gt;now (not forever!  Just to see how she would do), and find myslef kicking<br/>
&gt;butt.  Once I get up to 15 or 16 I will compare my Ranger&#39;s abilities with<br/>
&gt;my Barbarian Warrior.  Nevertheless, I agree 100% with taking away the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>skill<br/>
