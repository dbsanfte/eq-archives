<div id="ygrps-yiv-510197678">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
I play on Innoruuk too.  Sol-a is a difficult zone.  Folks try it one time<br/>
and probably don&#39;t have a lot of success so they take a course of less<br/>
resistence.  First time I went there, I fell into the lava and died - ran<br/>
off the ramp trying to run to the zone because we were swamped by gobs.<br/>
Spent the next hour+ doing CR.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, the average level on Inny is prolly higher than 30 - so the places for<br/>
30&#39;s are less populated than mid 40 to mid 50.<br/>
<br/>
Old world places for 30:<br/>
<br/>
Highkeep Pickclaws (although you will be among the older folks there)<br/>
Cazic Thule (with a good group - this place is great)<br/>
Unrest (a good group in the basement torture chamber or ghost room)<br/>
Runnyeye (not well frequented but a good group there can get exp)<br/>
<br/>
Kunark:<br/>
Lake of Ill Omen (I think you will be among the older folks here)<br/>
Frontier Mountains<br/>
<br/>
Scars of Vellious:<br/>
Iceclad Ocen (Cougar camps - might be a touch low fo rhere but in a group<br/>
should do fine)<br/>
<br/>
Sylly Songsynger<br/>
(The Pantheon)<br/>
Troubador, somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>
<br/>
P.s. oh yeah, my warrior is level 15, parked in Firona Vie, holding some<br/>
extra stuff for me - dont think he will ever see much fighting but he was my<br/>
first regular char.<br/>

Went back to up to SolA after patch and still same deal. There were 2 <br/>
45s and 38lvl and me in zone, i waited a while but no one showed up. <br/>
Either the extra exp knowledge is not out or some reason Innoruuk <br/>
server just nevers has anyone in this zone.&gt;</div>
