<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-814936408">This arguement still doesn&#39;t make sense to me in a realm where some of the<br/>
opponents are taller than houses.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care how big your axe is, you aren&#39;t going to be able to do the<br/>
damage that a caster can to some creatures, like a hill giant.<br/>
<br/>
You argument just doesn&#39;t make sense when you apply it to the setting in EQ.<br/>
Sure I can hack someone&#39;s head off in a single swipe and a mage could blast<br/>
them to ashes. However, that same sword swipe will be nothing more than an<br/>
annoyance to a giant, where that same fireball from the mage will do<br/>
devastating damage.<br/>
<br/>
Making the warrior a huge damage dealing machine was never the intent of<br/>
Verant and isn&#39;t in the spirit of EQ&#39;s balanced group oriented world.<br/>
Verant needs to allow us to have an advantage of the other melee/caster<br/>
hybrids is the main point of our discussion I think.<br/>

&gt;I think the difference between melee combatants and casters magic should be<br/>

&gt;I am the president of a national group that fights with live steel weapons.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been fighting with long swords, 2-handed swords, axes and maces for 10<br/>
