<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255121620">Something changed on the last patch.<br/>
<br/>
Had another warrior stop me to tell me that dual wield is now trainable at <br/>
level 13!!  Woohoo ï¿½ went to the trainer in Freeport and now I am dealing <br/>
death with my combine lsword in one hand and a FS lsword in the other.  This <br/>
is a great skill!!!!  I was farting around trying to increase my skill by <br/>
using a rusty 2h sword.  This is so much better!!  Can&#39;t wait until I make <br/>
level 15 and get double strike.<br/>
<br/>
