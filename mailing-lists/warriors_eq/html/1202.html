<b>Subject:</b> Re: Warriors vs Hybrids <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-616753735">I have enjoyed this discussion so far. I don&#39;t have much of an issue with<br/>
warriors vs wizards. They traded hps, ac, and melee ability for high damage<br/>
dealing spells. However it appears I agree with many of you that is is the<br/>
hybrids that appear to have a distinct advantage over us. The hybrid that has<br/>
the most advantage appears to be the ranger. For various reasons I find I am<br/>
unable to group with the people I normally play with. I am unable to solo many<br/>
mobs even in the blue and green range, and really I have more fun in groups. I<br/>
have been traveling to many zones shouting that I am looking for a group, but to<br/>
no avail. It appears to me that many groups are prefering rangers over warriors,<br/>
and after I read the post on EQ&#39;Lizer I began to realize why.<br/>
<br/>
Advantages Warriors get over Rangers:<br/>
<br/>
- We get Dual Wield and Double Attack at 2 levels lower than Rangers, but after<br/>
a few levels they are back on par with us in the damage dealing department. So<br/>
as Wayne Sheppard wrote, &quot;the Warrior has no skill advantage over the hybrids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-Warriors get more hit points. This only appears to be true for the larger races<br/>
and rangers easily overcome this by being able to heal themselves, thus actually<br/>
taking more pressure off of the cleric to heal them.<br/>
<br/>
-Berserker Frenzy. As it has been stated before, I see no real advantage to<br/>
getting a strength boost and a dex penalty when I am close to dying. I would<br/>
rather not get hit more often when I am low on hp. It makes us die that much<br/>
quicker.<br/>
<br/>
Advantages Rangers have over Warriors:<br/>
<br/>
-Rangers get foraging. Not much of advantage in combat, but they can help keep<br/>
the party supplied with food without any mana cost. They can also carry more<br/>
loot since they don&#39;t have to carry lots of food. They just forage on demand.<br/>
<br/>
-Rangers get Hiding and Sneak. This allows the rangers to live longer because<br/>
they can avoid more of the deadlier Mobs that would target a warrior.<br/>
<br/>
-Rangers get the very useful skill of Tracking. This is a great advantage to<br/>
groups because the rangers make the best fetches. They party can heal up and<br/>
rest adn stay organized while the rangers are out searching for prey. This means<br/>
the party spends less down time and can fight more.<br/>
<br/>
-Rangers cast spells. They not only get some minor healing spells, but also are<br/>
able to do root spells, direct damage spells, so they can kick, attack, and cast<br/>
spells doing more damage than us. They also get spells that are useful to the<br/>
entire party like camoflage and SOW allowing the party to travel more safely.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Changes:<br/>
<br/>
- I like the idea of eliminating the skill cap of 200 and giving us a bonus in<br/>
combat related skills. I think it was 5*lvl +10 instead of 5*lvl +5.  Or they<br/>
could eliminate the bonus the hybrids get, so they only get 5*lvl. This would<br/>
allow a warrior of equal level to show a slight advantage over our hybrid<br/>
brothers.<br/>
<br/>
- To make it more apparent that warriors excell at combat I think rangers should<br/>
not get Double Attack. After all Verant stated that they hybrids gave up<br/>
something to get those spells and extra abilities. I don&#39;t see a problem with<br/>
Dual Wield because many of us grew up with D&D&#39;s image of rangers wielding two<br/>
swords. If paladins appear to be struggling at later levels they might get<br/>
Double Attack to allow them to keep up with the rangers.<br/>
<br/>
-It&#39;s been stated that at higher levels that the casters are doing so much<br/>
damage that we cannot Taunt the Mobs off of them. So I think that Taunt should<br/>
be boosted at higher levels causing the Mobs to pay more attention to us and do<br/>
our job of keeping thier attention while the caster burn them.<br/>
<br/>
-I also really like the critical hit skill. It should be innate like Parry and<br/>
Dodge. It would help us more of an asset to a party instead of a spell casting<br/>
warrior that can track like the rangers are now. They just seem to have many of<br/>
the same advantages we have and sacrificed nothing to get thier spells and<br/>
tracking and other abilites.<br/>
