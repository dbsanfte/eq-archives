<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077350875">I have to disagree here. As a player who runs both a warrior (level 8)<br/>
and a cleric (level 12) I see advantages in both classes. First and<br/>
foremost, there are a LOT of critters that resist root. And if your<br/>
group is targeting creatures above the spell cap (ie, 6 levels or more<br/>
above you) they will automatically resist root or ensnare or whatever<br/>
spell you are using. And when root fails, you are praying for a tank to<br/>
take some of the abuse else you are toast.<br/>
<br/>
For those sports fans, a football analogy I think works best. Warriors,<br/>
Paladins, and Monks (and perhaps some of the other hybrid melee classes<br/>
but I prefer to use the 3 mentioned) are like offensive lineman. They<br/>
are engaging the creature to let the other offensive players do their<br/>
work. A caster can&#39;t cast if he&#39;s being pounded on, plain and simple.<br/>
*Sometimes* channel MIGHT let you get a spell of but more often than<br/>
not they need to be disengaged. So the tank is critical to<br/>
accomplishing this. The benefits are two-fold. First the tank is doing<br/>
some decent damage on his own, keeping the critters attention and the<br/>
casters are unleashing their power trying to get the guy down in the<br/>
most efficient manner possible.<br/>
<br/>
The point being, all of these classes have value in a group. Group<br/>
being the operative word. Warriors are designed to be able to handle a<br/>
great deal of abuse in a melee. I seriously doubt any high level<br/>
players will tell you that tanks are of no value. Without them, the<br/>
rest of the members of the group have a much harder time doing their<br/>
job.<br/>
<br/>
And the point about the cleric being able to take on whites vs blue I<br/>
find to be absolutely false. Clerics don&#39;t have the offensive power or<br/>
mana to play the root n shoot game. *Maybe* against some undead but<br/>
again root is an unstable spell. Maybe my opinion on that will change<br/>
once I advance in levels but that&#39;s how I see it for now.<br/>

&gt; I believe that warriors are necessary in a group<br/>
&gt; only to the high teen-low <br/>
&gt; twenties.  When most hybrid-magic user classes get<br/>
&gt; to that level they can <br/>
&gt; either root, or get a pet that will engage the<br/>
&gt; creature while he or she <br/>
&gt; casts (wherein they usually don&#39;t need long because<br/>
&gt; they deal out the most <br/>
&gt; damage).  I am a lev 17 warrior and blue cons can<br/>
&gt; take me down to 1/3 hp, it <br/>
&gt; then takes me a half hour to heal back up.  While I<br/>
&gt; have a cleric who is <br/>
&gt; taking on white cons with little problem.  I have to<br/>
&gt; agree that warriors are <br/>
&gt; necessary, but only to the level before casters come<br/>
&gt; into their own. And fyi <br/>
&gt; I have a fellow mate who is a level 18 wiz with all<br/>
&gt; his points put into int <br/>
&gt; and he has only 100 less hp than I have. Another<br/>
&gt; overlooked characteristic <br/>
&gt; is that casters can hit magic only creatures from<br/>
&gt; the begining, while <br/>
&gt; warriors have to run around for weeks trying to save<br/>
&gt; up the money for a <br/>
&gt; special weapon (wich are way overpriced), and most<br/>
&gt; of the time we end up <br/>
&gt; running from green con&#39;s because we can&#39;t hit them. <br/>
&gt; I only use my warrior <br/>
&gt; now to get money and equipment for other characters<br/>
&gt; and roleplay.<br/>
