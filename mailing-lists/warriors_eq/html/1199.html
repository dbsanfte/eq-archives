<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-20084662">While we are on factions, I have a non-warrior related request for everyone.  <br/>
As another character, I play a Dark Elf Shadow Knight.  Again, on the Bertoxx <br/>
server.  I left Neriak at level 3, and traveled to the land of Faydwer.  I <br/>
got an invis, and ran to CB cave, hopping to raise my faction enough to allow <br/>
me into the city.  Alas, I am now level 12, and I have recently been informed <br/>
that I can NEVER change the faction with the elves.  Somewhat upset, I <br/>
arranged for an invis to the dwarven lands, in hopes of acceptance there.  <br/>
But, as the time for my departure drew near, I ambandoned leaving, refusing <br/>
to belive nothing could be done.  So, I decided to start a petition of sorts <br/>
to help change this.  So, what I propose is that they allow me to change my <br/>
faction standings, just make it take a while.  I know humans are not looked <br/>
upon as the greatest of friends to the elves, so let&#39;s say that it takes 200 <br/>
orc kills for them to go from one fac level to the next.  So, make if 400 <br/>
orcs for me to go from one to the next.  Or maybe more like 600.  Make it <br/>
hard, but not impossable.  Anyway, I ask you to sent them feedback asking for <br/>
this, because I would like to be able to walk outside without a guard walking <br/>
by and killing me.</div>
