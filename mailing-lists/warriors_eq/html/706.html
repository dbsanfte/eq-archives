<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-287852186">Its Verant that created the campers.  They have made it so that the good items only spawn once in a great while.  These items are worth having, and worth spending time to obtain.  So when I get strong enought to get any particular item I really really want, I camp the monster that drops it until I get one, and chances are that there will be someone else in my party that needs the item to, so we have to camp until they get one too, THEN we move on.<br/>
<br/>
I do admit camping is a serious problem in the game.  But mainly the problem is that there are so many guilds who FARM items for their lower level guild buddies.  By farming I mean camping getting their item, camping, camping, camping, getting their item, camping camping camping, (loop), until they have enough to give their entire guild.<br/>
<br/>
Fine example was last night in Cazic, a SK and a couple caster types were camping for rubicite gloves.  It was rather obvious when they actually got them because the SKs gloves turned red.  The gloves are the only item that this particular mob drops.  After getting his gloves he continued to camp.  Now why did he need to camp there after he got his item?  THATS where the camping problem is.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve purposed this solution to verant on their internal beta testing beta board which the general public does not have access to, but nobody from verant even bothered to reply:<br/>
<br/>
Simply make it so that the higher level items can only be looted once by any given player, perhaps twice (so they can have one for trading purposes), or 4 times for items that you can use 2 of, ie earrings, rings, bracers, 1h weapons.  <br/>

Why camp him?  Why not just see if hes there, if he isnt, move on to other<br/>
adventures.  Campers are what makes this game untolerable sometimes.  The<br/>
only camping I do anylonger is camping in with a group that I pull for.  And<br/>
thats just normal mobs, nothing that you have to wait for a spawn on.  Come<br/>
on poeple, camping ruins alot of what this game is intended to be, an<br/>
ADVENTURE.<br/>
<br/>
Camping for a little while is not as bad as the poeple who simply camp a<br/>
place to farm the item over and over again.  I can actually understand doing<br/>
it for one person who needs the item.  But doing it for money and such is<br/>
completely inappropriate IMO.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Karg Iceberg, I have heard it is One in 40 spawn.  Bring a<br/>
&gt; ranger or druid<br/>
&gt; &gt;slave to track him, that place is a maze.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Heya, i just saw this latest addition to gameznet and it looked very<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting.  With 18dmg, 39 delay, and glowing like a greater<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lighstone, this two handed sword is calling to be my<br/>
&gt; replacement for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; AGI stealing BBC. Thing is though, the website only said it would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; found on a roaming barbarian in everfrost. Does anyone know which<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; barbarian has it?  My drow warrior is already KOS there, so<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s no big<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; deal if i kill a few barbarians :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; To John - I didn&#39;t catch you on last eve.  Hopefully tonight<br/>
&gt; after work<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we can get together and share stories.  I was in Guk and<br/>
&gt; Cazic but I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; go anywhere really :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
