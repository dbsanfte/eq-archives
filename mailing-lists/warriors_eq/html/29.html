<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615799002">I am Thuxtis the Mighty, a gnomish warrior on the Rallos Zek server.<br/>
I am currently 9th level, but expect to hit 10th before the end of the<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
I chose to play a warrior because of the character I wanted to play, and<br/>
so make significant efforts to ignore the disadvantages of the class.<br/>
<br/>
At my level, it is essential to group with others, especially on the PvP<br/>
server.<br/>
I believe the XP advantages (you go up faster) actually works against<br/>
you, with<br/>
the 4 level limit for Pvp, you advance into the prime PVP fodder more<br/>
wuickly than you can amass the items you need to protect you.<br/>
<br/>
There is also the special ability that hits when you&#39;ve taken 65%<br/>
damage, whoopee.<br/>
<br/>
THings I would like to seen added to the class...<br/>
1.  Increased magic resistance.<br/>
2.  A Damage increase skill.  Similar to the other skills in<br/>
advancement, this could act as a percentage multiplier to melee damage.<br/>
3. Improved Archery.  <br/>
