<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670302364">Damn, Green steels plate helm, and steels pants an such.  The only things I have been able to get at lvl 16 are full bronze, Bs mantle, some ohter stuff, and 2 combine LS&#39;s.  And I still have to rest forever from even a green Desert madman.  Personally, I know a lot of people at low lvls with Dark Reavers and steel plate.  Personally it makes me sick, they either bring up some excuse like being a smith ( and nowadays they don&#39;t earn jack), or they get things from a friend, hehe.<br/>
