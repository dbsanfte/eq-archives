<div id="ygrps-yiv-808360330">very true, warriors become damage absorbtion machines.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, even tho I don&#39;t do near the over all damage, its still nice to see me doing some damage, even if its minute compared to what the wiz is doing :)<br/>

Who cares what damage a warrior does at 35+<br/>
That is not our role......suck it up...all of the damage.<br/>
That is what you are here for.<br/>
Try doin more damage then a wiz or a mate.....I think not.<br/>
<br/>
Warriors ar not the ones to dish out the damage....at lower levels yea but <br/>
at higer levels we just keep em occupied.<br/>
IMHO<br/>

&gt;Yup & the gap seems to get worse the higher in levels you go.  Not only <br/>
&gt;Rangers, but Paladins & especially Monks seem to greatly diminish the role <br/>
&gt;of the warrior at levels 25+.  Eventually the other classes have similar <br/>
&gt;(within a couple of 100 hps) stats and much more diversity in terms of <br/>
&gt;healing & hth damage capability.  Mind you that my opinion is based on <br/>
&gt;talking with high level players (who have tried to convince me to dump my <br/>
&gt;warrior) & from reading on the eqstratics site.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is an interesting thread on the eqstratics board (warriors) regarding <br/>
&gt;the perceived lack of differentiation (or all out weakness) of our class at <br/>
&gt;higher levels.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What does the rest of the list think?  Anyone have direct experience <br/>
&gt;playing these classes at level 30+ & can compare HTH damage & effectiveness <br/>
&gt;against critters?<br/>

&gt; &gt; This past week I decided to take a break from my level 15 dark elf <br/>
&gt;warrior.  I was abit frustrated.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I started a half-elf warrior in Kelethin.  It is insanely easy to play <br/>
&gt;there.  I made level 5 in about 3.5 hours.  Then I stopped and tried a wood <br/>
&gt;elf ranger.  Has anyone else played a ranger?  I imagine it is the most <br/>
&gt;poorly balanced of all the hybrids.  After 4 hours I reached level 5 and <br/>
&gt;got kick.  I am now 12-18 hours into the character and almost level 9.  I <br/>
&gt;am just as capable as an equivalent warrior.  Next level I gain an array of <br/>
&gt;spells which will boost my combat effectiveness and allow me to heal.  Part <br/>
&gt;of the easy success is the plethora of low level orcs available a stone&#39;s <br/>
&gt;throw from Kelethin.  With my tracking ability I am never at a loss for <br/>
&gt;targets and I can engage blue con orcs in rapid succession or even 2 at a <br/>
&gt;time. I can even engage and successfully beat yellow con orcs more than 50% <br/>
&gt;of the time and almost always can kill orcs that con even to me without <br/>
&gt;trouble. So far it seems that I get as many hit points now as my warrior <br/>
&gt;did.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My point is, with a ranger class as powerful a combatant as it is I see <br/>
&gt;little necessity for the pure warrior.  I am going to play through to level <br/>
&gt;15 I think, just to see a more even comparison.  My concern is only from a <br/>
&gt;game mechanics perspective though as I have no doubt my playing as a dark <br/>
&gt;elf was a much more rewarding experience.  Has anyone else noticed that the <br/>
&gt;warrior just is not different enough from the hybrid fighter classes?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
