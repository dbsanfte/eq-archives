<div id="ygrps-yiv-340293953">Ok here&#39;s my opinion. I started a warrior because that is my favorite class.<br/>
I like to fight monsters and such, and I love to use a sword. In pen and<br/>
paper games I am usually a ranger or a thief because in those games it&#39;s<br/>
really not about the type of character you play, but how you play them.<br/>
Anyways, let&#39;s just say I am not really too happy with the way that warriors<br/>
(especially humans) play in EQ. I never played anything else, but there was<br/>
something that was lacking. I made a ranger today and by level 3 I was<br/>
loving him. There are so many more advantages. First, being able to pick who<br/>
you fight with tracking...Then elves have stats better than humans<br/>
anyways...add to that the fact that they are EXTREMELY simalar in combat,<br/>
PLUS have spells. People are arguing that the spells they have suck, and<br/>
that they will never be more than 80% of max and blah blah blah....Who<br/>
cares??!? Warriors don&#39;t get spells at all, and if you want 100% be a mage!<br/>
Well, I am not abandoning my warrior just yet, but I will be splitting a lot<br/>
of time with my ranger to see how things even out.<br/>
