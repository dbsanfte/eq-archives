 </span></blockquote>That sounds like a great idea.  I&#39;m just a level 11 warrior and would love<br/>
to know<br/>
higher levels tales on how they got there.  Maybe we can all share a story<br/>
on<br/>
our adventures.<br/>
<br/>
That was a great story Bruener, I too was thinking to hunting in East<br/>
Commonlands.<br/>
But every time I do, it seems that I&#39;m Griffen or the big snake (drak<br/>
something or other)<br/>
bait.<br/>
<br/>
Let me ask you all this Has anyone done the Quest in Hogcaller&#39;s Inn?<br/>
You have to talk to Lady She ( elf ) give her wine ( white ) and she tells<br/>
you that someone in room two is in with the dark elfs.  Then you have to<br/>
go and find a key to get the mail from the inn keeper ( which I missed, I<br/>
just could not find the key ) You then have to kill the halfing woman<br/>
( Shintl Lowbrow ) you get her head and a note.  That that back<br/>
to the guy who started the quest ( near the forge in warrior building )<br/>
he tells you to go to Toala in the Areana.  She wants you to kill the<br/>
halfing and her drow helper.<br/>
<br/>
My question is this - who is the helper.  I hate to try to kill all the dark<br/>
elfs in the city.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok here is my story for the week.<br/>
<br/>
Walking around North Ro, I happen to get lost.  Which is something<br/>
that I do very offen.  Tears fell from my eyes when I could not see<br/>
the grasslands.  But taking a deep breath and a praying to the<br/>
Warlord, I made my way slowing around hopeing to see water or<br/>
grass.  Then by luck I happen across a Giant Desert Spider.<br/>
<br/>
An horror if ever I saw one, all those red eye and hairy legs<br/>
stills gives me the shivers as I look on one.  With a war yell<br/>
I ran to the beast.  Meaning to destory it.<br/>
<br/>
Not knowing that I was the hunted as well as the hunter, a puma<br/>
came on me and taged teamed with the spider.  Being that I&#39;m not<br/>
that brave I ran for it.  Hopeing to make it to the grasslands.<br/>
<br/>
With them hot on my tail I ran, for my life was on the line.  As<br/>
as I just made it to the grasslands I took my stand - I could not<br/>
run anymore.  With sword in hand I prayed to the Warlord for<br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
And in his kindness he send it to me, in the form of drawf.  Never<br/>
have the race looked so handsome to me.  How strong and brave<br/>
he was to help me take on these beasts.  With a few blows of his<br/>
mighty axe the spider landed at my feet.  He watched me take on<br/>
the puma, making sure that I did not need any help with it.<br/>
<br/>
After the beasts where killed and the blood lust in my eye faded,<br/>
I looked around for my friend.  Wanting to thank him, give him a<br/>
hug for saveing this poor foolish human female.  But he was<br/>
gone.<br/>
<br/>
With tears in my eyes I fell down and thanked the Warlord for his<br/>
gift and hoped that he would always watch over th drawf that aided<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone and have  a Happy Thanksgiving.<br/>
