<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032720917">well, at 14th level you have a couple choices, money, or power level up to about 20 when you can go kill monsters that have real money.  Personally I chose to power level from 12 to 20 killing gators in oasis, didn&#39;t make a dime, actually lost money due to having to buy food and water.  But once I hit 20, I went to some better places where the money is great.  Now I&#39;m 28th lvl and have more money than I know what to do with.  In fact I just bought a 250pp bow, spent 100pp for a SBH for a buddy of mine, spent antother 100pp equiping a buddy who lost his body and GMs refused to help, and I&#39;m still sitting on enough for a couple pieces of real plate, and looking to spend another 400-500pp on a couple tommys.  My point is, at 14th lvl, I know of nowhere to go make GREAT money, so if you can just bear to be poor for another 6 levels (which go fast killing gators), you&#39;ll be strong enough to go fight stuff that dropps several plat at a time....at which point you&#39;ll be quickly equip yourself then wonder &quot;where to I spend all this money?&quot; :)<br/>

Currently 14th level Barbarian Warrior. Need some ideas of where to hunt<br/>
for exp AND money. Usually hunt with a group of 4 others 12/13 range. We<br/>
are itching to travel so any ideas would be great.<br/>
