&gt; I&#39;m going the big two handed sword route myself (a shiny brass halberd is<br/>
&gt; my weapon now), but what I have heard from a source I trust (my guild<br/>
&gt; leader who was a warrior like I was in beta) is to put the faster weapon in<br/>
&gt; your main hand. The 2nd attack goes based on when the first one does. The<br/>
&gt; more often the first one swings, the more often the 2nd does also. Spirit<br/>
&gt; of the bear, a shaman spell, though others may get it also, will keep your<br/>
&gt; stamina up.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Have a Mino Axe and a bastard sword. both 8dmg and 32/35.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Keep this combination of weapons?<br/>
&gt; If not, which should I switch?<br/>
&gt; Does it matter which is in my primary had?&lt;<br/>
