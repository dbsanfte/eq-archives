<b>Subject:</b> Re: Playing a Troll Warrior <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-52856844">well I havent played a troll warrior but I am playing a barbarian warrior <br/>
and I have played a troll SW.<br/>
<br/>
bash bash bash. bashin es whad trolls do an they reeeli gud tu.<br/>
<br/>
I dont know about any warrior quests but check out the SW guildmaster, he <br/>
might know.<br/>
Go out in the swamp and stay close to the guards in the beginning.<br/>
remember that water moccasins are poisenus and kinda annoying, there are <br/>
better things to kill. Get the regular newbie mobs like skells and stuff. As <br/>
you are a warrior wack white and yellow stuff in the beginning. Just <br/>
remember to stay close to the guards.<br/>
When you feel a bit more sure about yerself follow the steady stream of <br/>
people to the island in the middle of the swamp (its kinda hard to find in <br/>
the beginning)<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of froglocks there to bash. Bet keep in mind that they help <br/>
eachother and the situation can easily get outofhand.<br/>
there are several different frogloks and some are harder the others. If I <br/>
remember it correctly its froglok, froglok fishermen, froglok foragers.<br/>
<br/>
They also have armor sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
At level 7 as sw, prolly level 5 or 6 as warrior you can starta a team and <br/>
pull some orcs from the zone just opposite the town.<br/>
Sorry I dont remember the name but its realy easy to find.<br/>
<br/>
well thats all I can come up with atm.<br/>
<br/>
well there is guk dungeon too but I dont know if its worth going there when <br/>
you start up, there is some realy NASTY stuff inthere and trains can be <br/>
painfull at times.<br/>
<br/>
Not a good guide but I hope it will give you some poiters and ideas.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hail Great and learned warriors.  I have decided to start playing a Troll<br/>
&gt;Warrior and would like some advice.  All I know now is to grab the first <br/>
&gt;two<br/>
&gt;handed sword I can find and start killing everything in site.  Any<br/>
&gt;suggestions on how to play the largest evil killing machine in Norrath?<br/>
