<div id="ygrps-yiv-20999970">I think the expansion is due out before xmas, around the time of diablo 2,<br/>
to keep all of us eqers drolling over this game and not diablo ( like THAT<br/>
was gonna happen anyways.) They said that they would be implementing some<br/>
new zones before the expansion as well, and with the expansion comes a whole<br/>
bunch of stuff. Lizardmen race ( which i think the stats are gonna be<br/>
something like this STR - high STA med AGI way high DEX way high INT Below<br/>
av WIS below av CHA way low) I just hope that this new race is gonna be more<br/>
than just another race of ogres and trolls, i mean if it is then thats<br/>
boring, 3 races and each of them can only pkc 3 classes....BORING. I think<br/>
the class break down of the new race will be something like<br/>
this..........1.Warrior 2. Rogue 3. Shaman 4. Shadow Knight Now of course i<br/>
could be way wrong about the stats and they might be a really smart bunch of<br/>
reptiles and they may be the evil version of the high elfs or something ( Uh<br/>
huh yeah right, who ever heard of a smart lizard....=) ) But regardless its<br/>
gonna be cool to have a continent where the only race is an evil<br/>
race....thatll make it good for us Dark Elves to go exploring and not worry<br/>
about getting KOS. <br/>
<br/>
What do you guys think about the prospect of a new race? Think they&#39;ll be<br/>
smart? like the Dark elves? Or big and powerfull like the Trolls and<br/>
ogres...or more of an evil Halfing style, quick and agile...like i think..<br/>
<br/>
Lemme know what ya think.<br/>

&gt; Actually I didn&#39;t know this. :-)  It&#39;s good to hear. I knew there was an<br/>
&gt; expansion in the works, but I thought that was pretty far out ... like<br/>
&gt; Christmas<br/>
&gt; maybe. Anyway, that&#39;s good news.<br/>
