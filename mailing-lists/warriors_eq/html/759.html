<div id="ygrps-yiv-391872442">Hmmm I think I like this idea better than mine, for the sole reason that<br/>
this idea is MUCH easier to implement than my quest based idea.<br/>
<br/>
O.K. everyone you know what you have to do hit /feedback<br/>
<br/>
First thing I do when I log in tonight will be mention this idea and where I<br/>
got it from.  Maybe a Verant employee will join the list if we keep giving<br/>
them good ideas<br/>
<br/>
While your at it make sure you mention the adding of Dragoon to DE warriors<br/>
of level 45 plus and Sir to Paladins who do the Test of Truth Quest :).<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to keep harping on this point, but Verant will do nothing if we all<br/>
dont feedback.  They will do something if more than one person hits the<br/>
feedback button.  I know this from personal experience.<br/>

&gt; YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s what we need! A random item spawn.....I&#39;ll even take it one step<br/>
&gt; further:<br/>
&gt; Lets say that said sword is on a level 45 person...so we&#39;ll call that a<br/>
&gt; &#39;level 45 item&#39; it can then spawn to any level 45+ NPC in all of the zone,<br/>
&gt; or even norrath. That would make people have to travel A LOT to find items<br/>
&gt; they want, and would completely prevent camping for items altogether. That<br/>
&gt; way if you really wanted an item bad enough, your group had to go search<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; it...not just sit sround and wait for it....that to me is not even<br/>
&gt; role-playing.<br/>
&gt; Just my 2 cents.<br/>
