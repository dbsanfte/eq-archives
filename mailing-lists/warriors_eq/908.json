Lets look at lake rather, with lothaniel i could go<br/>\nthere with a group and be the ONLY plyers in that zone, it was great, now<br/>\nwhen i go there with my cleric, there are at least 15 people in the zone. Ok<br/>\n15 people isnt that much but they are usually cmping out where all the good<br/>\nstuff is. I suppose thise thing is bound to happen, i mean everyone is<br/>\ngaining levels and there are only so many areas to hunt in right? Well im<br/>\nfine with that not much can be done, ill just go to solusek where its barren<br/>\nand test my luck out there. Heck id rather have a little more people in the<br/>\ndungeon to help me if i needed it ! hehe.<br/>\nJohn Zwanenburg<br/>\nTips Support/Support Sipt<br/>\nTel: (613) 998-2745</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
