While we could use a combat boost, I&#39;d rather we go<br/>\nanother way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want another skill that works all the time without any strategy as<br/>\nto when to use it.  I&#39;d rather be able to have a skill that I can use when I<br/>\nwant to.  I want to be able to choose to use my skill to change the outcome<br/>\nof a battle<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want another skill to replace kick/bash.  We will then just use the<br/>\nmost effecient skill all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m proposing again my Battle Cry.  For 20 seconds, you get Double Attack<br/>\nSpeed, +25 STR and +25 AC.  What would be even better is if EVERYONE in your<br/>\ngroup gained the benefits of the Battle Cry.  Something this powerful would<br/>\nbe limited to once per day, just like Lay Hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also believe that the Warriors should have a general combat boost, maybe<br/>\n6*lvl+5 for the combat skills.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Date: Mon, 14 Jun 1999 12:10:32 -0400<br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;Tom Swift&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Warriors vs Hybrids<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You missed my point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Have you ever seen to guys sword fighting and watch one guy kick at the<br/>\n&gt;same time he is trying to stick him? :)    &quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The critical strike should be attached to an attack, and not in place of<br/>\n&gt;one.

They go up without the need to use them.  &quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The only thing you are doing by making this an invoked skill is giving<br/>\n&gt;warriors another key to tap repeatedly in combat.

I don&#39;t agree.  Warriors can and should use everything at<br/>\n&gt;their disposal, slash and kick or bash, and at the same time be looking for<br/>\n&gt;an opportunity to strike a critical hit.  A critical hit is not something<br/>\n&gt;you just decided to do, you take an opportunity. Your suggestion indicates<br/>\n&gt;that parry/dodge is a random part of combat.  I argue that it is indeed a<br/>\n&gt;skill, one which I wish was successful more often.  It isn&#39;t random because<br/>\n&gt;a warrior will endeavor to parry and dodge all attacks, and not just<br/>\n&gt;randomly manage to avoid them.  I speak from real life experience on this<br/>\n&gt;one not just about the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I see where you are going with the critical hit thing, but in the context<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;EQ the usefulness of the skill would be much hampered by your &quot;invoked&quot;<br/>\n&gt;method.  The average gamers style of play is to pick an attack and keep<br/>\n&gt;using it.  I for one, would simply max out my critical hit skill in party<br/>\n&gt;fighting against yellow and red mobs.  Then I would use the skill at every<br/>\n&gt;opportunity.  My dark elf warrior would likely max the skill in a single<br/>\n&gt;level, and be very successful using it.  I fear that barbarians, ogres and<br/>\n&gt;trolls would be at a disadvantage here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am solidly convinced that the parry/dodge method is the right way to go,<br/>\n&gt;and let EQ check when to use the skill and check its success.
