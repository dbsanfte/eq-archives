There is no &#39;intrinsic&#39; damage<br/>\nabsorption element for different armors.  Rather, their relative damage<br/>\nabsorption and protective effects are stored in the AC value.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Each level of armor absorbs more damage than the levels before it.  If<br/>\n&gt; you doubt, try it.  Fight something on your level naked and see how<br/>\n&gt; badly you get hit; every shot will come in at max damage.  Put your<br/>\n&gt; armor back on and see shots hitting for 2, 5, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This analysis is just plain... well... half-baked.  The reason you begin<br/>\nto get savaged without armor is because your AC has dropped by some<br/>\nobscene value.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference here is not the &#39;type&#39; of armor, but the AC difference.<br/>\nThus, if you could find cloth-looking armor with a better AC than plate,<br/>\nit would behoove you to wear it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why you see bare-sleeved high level players... They&#39;re wearing<br/>\ncloth-looking armor with _higher_ AC than either Plate or Rubicite.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; PLATE IS WORTH IT. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>AC equivalents to Plate are worth just as much as Plate itself.  You only<br/>\nneed the AC of Plate, not the &#39;look&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust going to do two examples:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; lizardscale cloak vs. Bronze Cloak<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would _definitely_ use the Lizardscale Cloak.  It is Plate with stat<br/>\nmodifiers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother common item that _is_ better than Plate would be the Thick Leather<br/>\nApron, which is both lighter and has equivalent or better AC than a Plate<br/>\nGirdle.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrew</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
