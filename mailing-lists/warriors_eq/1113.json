From what I have read, at 35 points I should be able to make a<br/>\nbow *grins*, but until then what do I buy to practice my skill with. The<br/>\narrows I have made so far have a 50, 100, 125 range on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure while getting my strenght back after battling the critters,<br/>\nfletching would be a good pass time. *shrugs* and archery will help me<br/>\npull from a distance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice is appreciated,<br/>\n<br/>\nAzlana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
