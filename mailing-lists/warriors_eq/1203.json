But being a warrior has <br/>\nit&#39;s advantages. when a group member is being attacked and needs help they do <br/>\nnot call the ranger for help they call me to pull it off them. i can&#39;t tell <br/>\nyou how many times i have been saved or saved others simply by having a <br/>\nlittle more hp than everyone else. there is an excitement in holding a weapon <br/>\nin my hand and brutally attacking my enemies. there is a glory in fighting to <br/>\nthe death and winning with only 10 hp left. we are the ones who take all the <br/>\nabuse and get screwed in the loot orders. but it is our calling. if you like <br/>\nrangers well then be a ranger but don&#39;t complain about being a warrior. we <br/>\nare a special breed and we should never look downcast on our class but we <br/>\nshould fight with a pride in knowing who we are. of course thats just my <br/>\nopinion i do not mean to anger anyone by this i am just proud and happy to be <br/>\na warrior. the game is what you make of it. goodluck to you all in your <br/>\nquests and many battles you face<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                           Beretta,fennin ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
