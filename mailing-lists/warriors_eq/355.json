Ro, and I also have a level 19<br/>\ndruid char.  I could really use a set of bronze plate if you were<br/>\nwilling to sell it for a reasonable price. If you remember back in the<br/>\nlate teens in level, cash is sorta tight.  I also played in beta on The<br/>\nRathe server as a druid and got my char up to 19 in p4.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks much!<br/>\n<br/>\nNick</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
