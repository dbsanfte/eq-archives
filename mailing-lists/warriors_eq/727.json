All NPC<br/>\nmerchants have set stock they&#39;re selling (ore, spells,<br/>\narmor, whatever); and then, at the bottom, they&#39;ll<br/>\nhave whatever people have sold to them.  I don&#39;t know<br/>\nhow long these other items stay in the inventory<br/>\nbefore disappearing, or if they&#39;ll ever disappear<br/>\n(until sold), but they&#39;re there.  You can test this<br/>\nyourself; walk up to a merchant w/o something, sell it<br/>\nto him/her, then talk to them again, and you&#39;ll see it<br/>\nin their for-sale inventory.  This is why most<br/>\nmerchants in North Ro and Freeport have Cutthroat<br/>\nrings for sale, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\nAre you?
