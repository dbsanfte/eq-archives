I to hunt in E karana for EXP, I fond the crag <br/>\nspiders,Carrion Spiders, Gorge Hounds and high LVL lions give away great <br/>\nEXP!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow... Here&#39;s a little secret I&#39;ve found when huting down a bandit camp wiht <br/>\n3 or LESS peple in the party.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, what you want is a nice long bow (range 100) with some class 2 arrows, <br/>\nall tanks must have these.<br/>\nNow,  when there is all bandits and special NPC in the middle there, go as <br/>\nfar as posible with the spell casters and take your &quot;long bow&#39;s and aim at <br/>\none!  when using a bow at long range this tends to make that one bandit come <br/>\nafter you whil the rest stay&#39;s put.  Now as they chase you, get your spell <br/>\ncasters pummling with some fire while they get the HP down to about 75-85% <br/>\nthats should be enough damage for the bandit to keep on the spell caster... <br/>\nRun NOW (spell caster(s)),  while he&#39;s running, you take the bandit out <br/>\nright behind him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, doing this repeatedly for about 3x then you should be safe taking out <br/>\nthe rest in full melee combate mode!<br/>\n<br/>\nDealan&lt;The Light of Norrath&gt; - lvl 15, Karana Server<br/>\n<br/>\n----Original Message Follows----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Tom Swift&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nReply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [warriors_eq] A weekend in East Karana<br/>\nDate: Mon, 7 Jun 1999 11:39:21 -0400<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Tom Swift&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note.  If one of your group is engaged on combat by and<br/>\nmob...named or not....then once your party member is dead the mob will come<br/>\nafter the next closest party member and so on till all are dead or zoned, or<br/>\nyou kill the mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a giant attacks a party member...first thing I do is DISBAND! Same goes<br/>\nfor anything that can wipe out the whole party.  We disband and then regroup<br/>\nwhen the danger is passed. Then the whole party doesn&#39;t have to run to zone<br/>\nto regroup which can save considerable time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis can upset some people so it is best to make sure everyone understands<br/>\nbefore it happens.  To many people die becuase giants can destroy a party<br/>\nbefore anyone realizes the trouble.  90+  damage per hit makes short work of<br/>\nmost players especially after being stunned.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jones, Brian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, June 07, 1999 10:52 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [warriors_eq] A weekend in East Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;From: &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Hail Norrath!<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; This weekend has been probably the worst as<br/>\n &gt; far as death is concerned, but it was the most<br/>\n &gt; hilarious.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Friday Eve:<br/>\n &gt; My party, which consists of a Wizard, Enchantress,<br/>\n &gt; and myself, a warrior, were headed for the Beholder<br/>\n &gt; Maze to fight minotaurs and muddite elders. On the<br/>\n &gt; way through East Karana, we came across a bandit<br/>\n &gt; camp with a named NPC.  Besides the one with the<br/>\n &gt; name there were 6 others, two conning blue and the<br/>\n &gt; rest green.  The enchantress charms one of the<br/>\n &gt; bandits and the rest come after us, except for the<br/>\n &gt; named NPC.  We finish off the bandits rather quickly<br/>\n &gt; then attack the last one (I will give out the name to<br/>\n &gt; those who ask).<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Well after a very short fight we remove his items and<br/>\n &gt; find a staff segment and a key, both lore items.  Great,<br/>\n &gt; they must be part of a quest!  After healing a little<br/>\n &gt; and regenerating mana, we decided to kill him again so<br/>\n &gt; that each of us can have a key and staff segment.  We<br/>\n &gt; recover two bronze weapons in the process and go off<br/>\n &gt; on our merry way.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Saturday Eve:<br/>\n &gt; We found out what to do with the key, but not until one<br/>\n &gt; of our party membes gives it to the wrong person.  No<br/>\n &gt; problem, we&#39;ll just go get another one.  So back to the<br/>\n &gt; bandit camp.  Besides two bandits there is a brigand<br/>\n &gt; (never seen one there before) and the named NPC. Our<br/>\n &gt; enchantress charms one of the spell casting bandits and<br/>\n &gt; guess what?  All of them come, and we dispatch them<br/>\n &gt; without a problem leaving only the named NPC.  Our<br/>\n &gt; enchantress says &#39;Now (the named NPC)&#39;.  I take out my<br/>\n &gt; trusty bow and whack!<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; a (named NPC) says hit for 9 non melee damage.<br/>\n &gt; A (named NPC) begins to cast a spell<br/>\n &gt; Your body convulsves as lightning arcs through your body.<br/>\n &gt; A (named NPC) begins to cast a spell<br/>\n &gt; Your skin combusts.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; By this time he has come into melee range.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; A (named NPC) hits you for 28 damage.<br/>\n &gt; A (named NPC) hits you for 15 damage.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; To see the least, he killed me and the Enchantress.  The<br/>\n &gt; wizard was able to escape to the zone.  One of the named<br/>\n &gt; NPC spells took away 2 bubbles of my health, which is<br/>\n &gt; almost 200 hit points.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; After we regroup, we find out that our Wizard had expended<br/>\n &gt; all his mana on the previous fight and wasn&#39;t able to tell us<br/>\n &gt; before I engaged with the named NPC.  Thus, we both died.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Now we go back for our revenge.  We initiate combat with the<br/>\n &gt; bandits, but this time the named NPC decides to join in!  (he<br/>\n &gt; never has done this before).  Well this time the wizard and<br/>\n &gt; myself die while the enchantress escapes.  I get the message<br/>\n &gt; &#39;Welcome to Level 15!&#39;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Have we learned our lesson yet?  Not yet!  We go back for the<br/>\n &gt; third time.  There is only the named NPC and two bandits.<br/>\n &gt; Shouldn&#39;t be a problem.  This time our Enchantress charms<br/>\n &gt; the named NPC and we quickly dispatch the remaining bandits.<br/>\n &gt; Think we got our revenge?  We did, until a griffawn comes<br/>\n &gt; up behind the enchantress and attacks.  Well the named NPC<br/>\n &gt; is still charmed so he starts hitting the griffawn along with<br/>\n &gt; myself.  About half way through the battle the charm wears off.<br/>\n &gt; One second the enchantress has a full bar of health, the next<br/>\n &gt; second she is lying on the ground dead.  The wizards health<br/>\n &gt; goes from full to half before another spell casting bandit spawns.<br/>\n &gt; I watch in horrow as my hit points dwindle away to half while still<br/>\n &gt; fighting the griffawn.  About this time the wizard is trying to gate<br/>\n &gt; while being hit hard by both the named NPC and the other bandit.<br/>\n &gt; I watch his health go down to one bubble then turn and start<br/>\n &gt;running,<br/>\n &gt; the griffawn on my heels.  I make it to the gorge and turn to finish<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; the griffawn with two bubbles of health.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Whew that was close!  It was a good thing I didn&#39;t attack either<br/>\n &gt;bandit.<br/>\n &gt; Wrong!!  Doesn&#39;t matter if I attacked them or not, here they come<br/>\n &gt;over<br/>\n &gt; the hill.  Suffice to say I died yet again.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; We have decided to give the bandits a WIDE berth anytime we are<br/>\n &gt; traveling through East Karana.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Angarth, Warrior of the 16th, er  15th Tier<br/>\n &gt; &quot;Periissem ni periisem&quot;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n &gt;ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n &gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n &gt;For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWhere do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAt ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
