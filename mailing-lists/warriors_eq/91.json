I&#39;ve come to EQ like<br/>\nmost of us, with a lot of experience in multiplayer gaming. Now, I&#39;m<br/>\nfairly new to EQ (level 8) but I thought I had a good understanding of<br/>\nit, and it&#39;s unwritten rules, until now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other night I was in BlackBurrow in a small group of 3. Two of us<br/>\nwere at the bottom level, and I was up top, returning from a town run. I<br/>\nsaw a gnoll guardsman kill someone, so I ran up to take charge of it.<br/>\nThere was nobody else around it. After a few hits it fled to the lower<br/>\nlevel with me chasing it every step, hacking and kicking. Upon reaching<br/>\nthe lower level, there was a mini train already down there, but both me,<br/>\nand the members of my group, were working on the gnoll guardsman I had<br/>\nchased down. Towards the end of the fight, a fighter type of some sort<br/>\nwalked up and took the final swing on the guardsman. Thinking I had done<br/>\nit ( I had to scroll back to look afterward) I bent over and looted the<br/>\ncorpse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fighter started complaining at once that I was a kill stealer and I<br/>\ntook his loot. I explained to him that I had chased the monster down,<br/>\nand had done the most damage, and therefore the computer LET me take my<br/>\nkill. He respnded that HE had chased the monster down from the top (I<br/>\nnever even saw anyone up top but myself) and had made the kill therefore<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t mine to take. I didn&#39;t feel like the argument was worth it so<br/>\nI gave up and tried to trade him the loot. He would not accept, but<br/>\ninstead complained to me via tells that he couldn&#39;t believe I did that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy questions are:<br/>\n1.) Was I ethically wrong to take the loot?<br/>\n2.) Does the game only allow the majority damage dealer to take the<br/>\nloot, or the final swinger?<br/>\n3.) How would you guys deal with this situation?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any advice ....<br/>\n-Faderic of Qeynos (Ellorisi Marr server)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
