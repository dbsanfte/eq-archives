You can enter every building in Norrath.  Barbarians can not enter ANY<br/>\nof the buildings in Kelethin that have a single door - we are too wide.<br/>\nHmmm...the game has been out 4 months and we are just finding out about the<br/>\ncentaur armor.  Could it be possible someone else makes armor for the little<br/>\npeople and big people?  Nah, Verant would never do that!   Lets just whine<br/>\nabout not getting the blue plate armor - we are doomed to where bronze or<br/>\nsteel plate the rest of our lives when the bigger people gets the cool blue<br/>\nstuff.   Sorry for the sarcasm - its early Monday and I have to work all<br/>\nweek :)   It DOES make sense that it is only for medium races, however.  I<br/>\ndoubt if any of the centaurs are the size of a dwarf or gnome or halfling.<br/>\nI think trolls and ogres would have a better argument.  Have you seen the<br/>\ncentaur that creates the armor??  Huge.  But then again they are evil, so<br/>\nthey gives a good reason why its not available to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngarth Bladedancer, Warrior of the 21st Tier (Still)<br/>\n&quot;Periissem ni periisem&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tJ Eric Rowland[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gemini68@...\">gemini68@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tSaturday, July 24, 1999 7:44 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Blue Plate Mail<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: J Eric Rowland &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gemini68@...\">gemini68@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yeah, Once again us dwarven warriors get to bend over and take it.
