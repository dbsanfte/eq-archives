I&#39;ve never been able to buy them (don&#39;t need<br/>\nto anyway) and when I sell items, she is one of my favorites because my selling<br/>\nprice to her tends to be higher. I would be intrested to find out SHE actually<br/>\nsold them. If so I would have bought one looooongg ago instead of fighting the<br/>\ngnoll commander for mine. Or was that the gnoll elites ... don&#39;t remember. One<br/>\nof the two of them had it spawn occasionally. But mine was only like AC+3 and<br/>\nSTR+2(or +3 .... damn I can&#39;t remember crap today). I will check later. I would<br/>\nbe glad to steer new warriors to her shop if she sells them though.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faderic<br/>\n<br/>\nDean Boyle wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Dean Boyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gino_14@...\">gino_14@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hail!
