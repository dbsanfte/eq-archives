I have maxed both dual wield and<br/>\n&gt; double attack at 80 each.  I seem to be having trouble effectively<br/>\n&gt; hunting.  Anything that cons white to me is always a tough fight that can<br/>\n&gt; go either way, so I usually end up sticking to blue critters.  However<br/>\n&gt; some blue critters are just to tough to solo.  Lava basilisks are a no-no<br/>\n&gt; because of Stone Breath, fire elementals have some kind of damage shield<br/>\n&gt; which causes me damage each time I hit so they are a no-no also.<br/>\n&gt; Lavastorm being my preferred hunting area right now.  I tried crocs in<br/>\n&gt; Oasis, but it is to crowded when I play (8pm-10pm) for me to even find<br/>\n&gt; anything to kill.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I guess I am at that awkward level and was looking for advice from other<br/>\n&gt; warriors on how they got fro 15 to 16.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Bael<br/>\n&gt; Warrior of the 15th Order<br/>\n&gt; Indigo Brotherhood of the Tier&#39;dal<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
