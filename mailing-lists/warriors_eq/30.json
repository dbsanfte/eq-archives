There is such a thing, but it doesn&#39;t start kicking in until after about 23rd lvl or so.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Archery works pretty good, just takes forever to get your skill up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSalr D&#39;Taynkk<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Scott M Parrish &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sparrish@...\">sparrish@...</a>&gt; 5.14.99 11:26:07 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: Scott M Parrish &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sparrish@...\">sparrish@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am Thuxtis the Mighty, a gnomish warrior on the Rallos Zek server.<br/>\nI am currently 9th level, but expect to hit 10th before the end of the<br/>\nday.<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose to play a warrior because of the character I wanted to play, and<br/>\nso make significant efforts to ignore the disadvantages of the class.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt my level, it is essential to group with others, especially on the PvP<br/>\nserver.<br/>\nI believe the XP advantages (you go up faster) actually works against<br/>\nyou, with<br/>\nthe 4 level limit for Pvp, you advance into the prime PVP fodder more<br/>\nwuickly than you can amass the items you need to protect you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also the special ability that hits when you&#39;ve taken 65%<br/>\ndamage, whoopee.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHings I would like to seen added to the class...<br/>\n1.  Increased magic resistance.<br/>\n2.  A Damage increase skill.  Similar to the other skills in<br/>\nadvancement, this could act as a percentage multiplier to melee damage.<br/>\n3. Improved Archery.  <br/>\n-- <br/>\n***************************************************************<br/>\n* &quot;It is good to have an end to journey toward; but it is the *<br/>\n* journey that matters, in the end.&quot; - Ursula K.
