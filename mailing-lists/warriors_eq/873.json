From level 1 to level 20, what my character is now, I&#39;ve went<br/>\n&gt;through 3 books :) It&#39;s cool to read how Verant took the characters from<br/>\n&gt;the books and how their natural races have been complimented by their<br/>\n&gt;corresponding cities.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s the best way to handle the skill of Sense Heading:  First under <br/>\nOptions goto Keyboard and find the User Defined 6 slot.  Get rid of <br/>\nwhatever&#39;s there and make it Keypad 8.  Now, go back to your Abilities list, <br/>\nand hotkey Sense Heading onto the last hotkey box on the left-hand side of <br/>\nyour screen.  Now, whenever you walk forward (assuming you use the keypad for <br/>\ncontrol), you will automatically practice Sense Heading at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSense Heading while Fishing?  You bet!  When you fish, take a seat next to an <br/>\nNPC (presumably another fisher).  As you are fishing, practice Beg on the <br/>\nNPC, and Sense Heading all at the same time.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
