Ok first off you have to go to the necro/SK guild in Neriak and talk to<br/>\nthe head SK (Ive forgotten his name but he is pretty easy to pick out.) You<br/>\nhave to talk to him and he&#39;ll give you the quest to go kill the paladin in<br/>\nthe lavastorm mountains.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. once you kill the paladin and return his prayer book to the guild leader,<br/>\nhe will ask you to take a note to a member in the West commonlands, Gix.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Give gix the note and hell ask you to fetch him the hammer peices from<br/>\nbefallen. The first two are located on the elf skeleton at the beginning of<br/>\nlevel 3 (level 16-20 ) and the third is located on the Commander mummy in<br/>\nBefallen. He is a REALLY rare spawn ( I still havent seen him ) and he drops<br/>\nthe thrid peice, bring them to gix and Voila you get the thex mallet.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
