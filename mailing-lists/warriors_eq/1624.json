You must then, always keep your weapons in this<br/>\nspecific slot.  I had my first experiment with this using a bard character a<br/>\nfew days back.  hotkeyed a backpack slot and my Melee1 and Melee2 slots.<br/>\nIt&#39;s works pretty well.  Sometimes looting can cause a minor problem though.<br/>\nMost of the time it&#39;s OK though.  These don&#39;t act like regular hot keys,<br/>\nwhere you can just click 3 or 4 to make them work.  They act like inventory<br/>\nslots.  You click on a weapon to pick it up, and then drop it in one of your<br/>\nother &quot;Hot Slots&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.  If someone has an even better way that I overlooked I&#39;m<br/>\nall ears.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
