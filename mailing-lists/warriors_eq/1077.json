I dont&#39; recall the weight off hand. <br/>\nIt is a quest and lore item, and completing this quest gives you a 50/50 shot of getting the Brutechopper or Midnight Maul.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quest takes place in Innothule swamp and the weapon and quest is only for Ogres, Trolls, Barbarians, and Dwarves (3 Large races and one small?).<br/>\n<br/>\nI will post more details if anyone desires. I do not know if a &quot;good&quot; race can complete the quest.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
