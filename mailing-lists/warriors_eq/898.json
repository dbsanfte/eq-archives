Killing wood elves DOES not work.  The ones on Erollsi<br/>\nraise Crushbone Orc Faction.  I assume if you get this high enough the<br/>\nbrotherhood will tolerate you.   But its SILLY.  Its EXTREMELY easy to<br/>\nbecome an outcast but nigh impossible to become evil.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ONLY way I can think of are MAYBE the wood elf guards who are atleast<br/>\nlevel 40 or more.  The other way is to get the deceiver mask and do the<br/>\nIndigo Quests a million times.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tPaul Jesernig[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PWJ@...\">PWJ@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tFriday, May 28, 1999 4:44 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \tINTERNET:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Digest Number 29<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Paul Jesernig &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PWJ@...\">PWJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have killed high elf paladins in Innothule swamp (level 15-18) and I<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; never gotten an increase in faction with the Indigo Brotherhood. In Rathe<br/>\n&gt; Mountains north of the entrance from the ferroot, there is a wood elf (may<br/>\n&gt; be high but think wood) guard who is level 19-21. There are NPC&#39;s in the<br/>\n&gt; area who will call him when they see an ogre, but not sure if they will<br/>\n&gt; come if you attack him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oglug ~Hand of Chaos~ CT<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message text written by INTERNET:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The ONLY way to raise Indigo brotherhood faction is to kill elves.  The<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; realistic targets (since Wood Elf guards are very high level) are the<br/>\n&gt; elves<br/>\n&gt; on the Island of Erollsi.  If you raise Indigo you lower Wood/High elf and<br/>\n&gt; vice a versa.  These two sides are mutually exclusive.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
