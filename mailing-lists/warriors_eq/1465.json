If","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2019352172\">As stated before, there is more to playing a warrior than<br/>\nattack/kick/bash/taunt,  just as there is more to playing a cleric than<br/>\nheal/root/damage/heal.  If you want to make suggestions to improve the<br/>\nwarrior class, thats good.  But please stop with the drivel about there is<br/>\nnothing to playing a warrior.  Most people who play a warrior past the<br/>\nnewbie stages will disagree with you (otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be playing the<br/>\nwarrior anymore).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAngarth Bladedancer, Warrior of the 21st Tier<br/>\n\t&quot;Periissem ni periisem&quot;<br/>\n\t <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; When it comes down to a battle, the Warrior&#39;s job is to choose the correct<br/>\n&gt; critter to attack/kick/bash/taunt.  Thats about it.  A good Warrior will<br/>\n&gt; make the best choices here.  A good Warrior will switch targets many times<br/>\n&gt; in a battle, distributing his attacks and taunts to keep the spellcasters<br/>\n&gt; free from attack.  Some of the best Warriors will switch armor/weapons<br/>\n&gt; based<br/>\n&gt; on what monster they are fighting.  Some go even as far to switch a shield<br/>\n&gt; in and out in the middle of battle depending if they are getting hit or<br/>\n&gt; not.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
