I&#39;ve notice that not too many folks hunt<br/>\nthe scarecrows at the Miller farm in West Karana.  While the money is not<br/>\nthat great, the ep is pretty good, and there is usually no one there so you<br/>\nhave them all to yourself.  There are 4 that spawn in the fields of the<br/>\nMiller farm.  It is rather safe hunting, as the scarecrows do not help each<br/>\nother (no trains) and there is nothing in the area that is dangerous to you.<br/>\nI have never seen a Hill giant at the farm, and at 18th lvl that is the only<br/>\nwandering mob in the zone you really have to watch for.  Soloing for a<br/>\nwarrior is really tough, but I was able to gain some good ep, in a<br/>\nreasonable time, in relative safety while solo in these fields.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was able to fight 2 in a row before having to rest.  Just make sure you<br/>\nhave lots of bandages!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLefGrebo Halasson<br/>\nWarrior of Halas of the 20th Step<br/>\nThe Tower Fellowship<br/>\n<br/>\n=======================================================<br/>\nThis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.
