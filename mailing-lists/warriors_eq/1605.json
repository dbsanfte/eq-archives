There were only about 15 people in the<br/>\nzone.  I came across an orc camp and decided to kill orcs. I was in need of<br/>\nslashed belts and figured this would be cool with noone else here.  At lvl<br/>\n14 I can take just about anything in the zone and I wanted to see if I could<br/>\nclear the camp of 4 orc spawns.  3 of 4 spawns were blue to me but seeing<br/>\nthat I have close to 500 hp&#39;s I wasnt worried.  The battle was very close.<br/>\nI had forgotten how many hp&#39;s the orcs had and when theres 4 on you your<br/>\nhp&#39;s go down quick.  I killed the last one with about half a bub of health<br/>\nleft and sat down to an unexpected long  rest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA bard strolls into camp and askes if id like to join him so I could heal<br/>\nquicker.  I said hell yeah!  From that point on we would take turns killing<br/>\nthe orcs (ungrouped) and then join again when I needed healing.  I was there<br/>\nin case he got into trouble (he was lvl 11) and he was there to get rid of<br/>\nmy downtime.  We had it down to such a science that we were doing both camps<br/>\nat the same time.  When ever he pulled to many he would run them around in a<br/>\nbig circle as I took em off him 1 by 1.  Also , he didnt want the belts so<br/>\nhe gave then to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe finally called it quits at about 6am.  I had made lvl 15 plus a bub.  Had<br/>\nabout 25pp in cash, and 4 backpacks full of belts.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was one of the most enjoyable times I have had in 7 months.<br/>\n<br/>\nBruener<br/>\n16th lvl Dwarf Warrior<br/>\n&quot;Clan Stormhammer&quot;<br/>\nRodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mark Davis [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mdavis@...\">mdavis@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 23, 1999 1:26 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [warriors_eq] Greetings<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Mark Davis&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mdavis@...\">mdavis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDaks,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the reply. Im sorry to hear that the list is really slow, but Im<br/>\nnot surprised.  With so many people, like yourself, achieving the upper<br/>\nlevels information is abundant in-game.  I guess what Im most interested in<br/>\nis hearing from people like yourself who might have a story, a suggestion, a<br/>\npitfall to avoid, a strategy, a nice area to hunt, etc etc.  As a 47th<br/>\nWarrior I imagine you have seen just about all there is to see and do across<br/>\nNorrath.  Id love to share your adventures, what suggestions you might have<br/>\nfor those higher level hunts and adventures.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for the reply,<br/>\n<br/>\nThoren & Co.<br/>\nThe Norrath Adventuring Co.<br/>\nRathe<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
