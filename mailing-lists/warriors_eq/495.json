Im a hard-core<br/>\ngame player have been ever since 1987.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes it EVEN worse is my fiancï¿½ encourages me to play, she likes to<br/>\nwatch and when not watching or im asleep she actually plays my character.  I<br/>\nsuggested that she should get an account and we could play together she said<br/>\nno for two reasons, EQ is addictive and she wont get any work done if she<br/>\ngets into it, and she prefers to play my high level character in relatively<br/>\nsafe zones where she is effectively a goddess and the whole zone couldn&#39;t<br/>\nkill her :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually had to start going to the gym again (after a 3 year break) and<br/>\nbike riding JUST so I get out of the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many other &quot;hard core&quot; game players are there?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhats worse is that I will  be moving to the USA within the next year and<br/>\nhave even MORE access to games and betas - sigh. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tschlaban yocksovik[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anonymaste@...\">anonymaste@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tWednesday, May 19, 1999 11:51 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] me and me and totaly ooc (rant,ooc and<br/>\n&gt; pathetic lives)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;schlaban yocksovik&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anonymaste@...\">anonymaste@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; hmm,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lets look into the life och chris(my real name) and see what his alst 24h <br/>\n&gt; was like.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yesterday same time as now roughly 16:30<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; leave work 30 min early, go home, check icq, send msg to friends<br/>\n&gt; &quot;loging on Vashi on solusek ro&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; play for 3h<br/>\n&gt; get killed by a griff for the first time, karanas was no fun today.<br/>\n&gt; and humans look funny in banded armor<br/>\n&gt; call for pizza, sit in safe spot, run down to pizza place(2min).<br/>\n&gt; Eat pizza while wackin scarabs in N Ro.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gf calls, talk 5 min, distracted by party members wanting to go,<br/>\n&gt; partymember laughs at a humans butt in chainmail<br/>\n&gt; gf hangs up askin me to call when the computer is turned off.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Spends 10 min healing after dorn got pulled by someone.<br/>\n&gt; Tries to light a smoke buy realize that I should have bought more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; check the time, damn 1:00 time to go to bed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wake up 30 min late, dreamin of clashing weapons and ugly humans in <br/>\n&gt; chainmail.<br/>\n&gt; run down to work, buy a sandwich on the way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; spend 90% of work time reading this newsgroup and every post on eqvault<br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; stratics, checks maps for now hunting areas.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; write 50 lines of code that wont work<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; AAAHHHRRRRGGGGG I thought i was safe from the computer gaming addiction<br/>\n&gt; when <br/>\n&gt; I gave up muds 6 months ago and now Im back in it again.
