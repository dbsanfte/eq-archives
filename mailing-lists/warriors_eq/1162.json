Read carefully.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors get to wear platemail and have many more hps than a Wizard.<br/>\nWarriors also have a higher Offense, Defense, and Weapon skills.  This all<br/>\nmeans that a Warrior can stand toe to toe against an NPC.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow lets make a Warrior have the same ability to deal damage as a Wizard.<br/>\nNow we would have a class that has the best armor, the highest combat<br/>\nskills, the most hp&#39;s AND the ability to deal the most damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would anyone want to play a Wizard if a Warrior could do as much damage<br/>\nAND be able to take blows in melee?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\nPS - When someone says that a Warrior should be able to deal as much damage<br/>\nas fast as a Wizard I immediately realize this person doesn&#39;t have a clue<br/>\nabout game balance.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
