I always thought that the traditional dungeon<br/>\ncrawl, that is go from room to room exterminating the enemy, is the best<br/>\nway.  BUT EQ doesn&#39;t allow that, things RESPAWN, so your back is never even<br/>\nmarginally safe. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I thought about it logically why do humans and demi-humans dominate the<br/>\nworld of Norrath and not orcs or goblins who seem to exist in profusion as<br/>\nwell, and are physically tuffer than us (we use weapons to hurt them and<br/>\nwear armour, there natural strength and thick skin is good enough)?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt occurred to me its because we are smarter than them.  If &quot;pulling&quot; can<br/>\nneutralize part of the enemy attack then I think its a good thing,  I think<br/>\nits a good thing because it demonstrates WHY we rule the planet - we are<br/>\nsmart (comparatively speaking).  Its also a solid tactical move, minimize<br/>\nthe enemies ability to attack you, have them come one at a time or have them<br/>\nstrung out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you have never pulled? or never been in a party that has?<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tJason Coan[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:coanj@...\">coanj@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tWednesday, May 26, 1999 10:53 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Tuffer Tentacle Terrors<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:coanj@...\">coanj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; THANK GOD, I think pulling monsters is lame...if you can&#39;t fight in the<br/>\n&gt; area, then you shouldn&#39;t be there....which in turn will help promote group<br/>\n&gt; play, rather than having a high level puller fetch a single monster at a<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Mifsud, Michael [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Mifsud@...\">Michael.Mifsud@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 25, 1999 8:48 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [warriors_eq] Tuffer Tentacle Terrors<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Mifsud, Michael&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Mifsud@...\">Michael.Mifsud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; They seem to have made the Tentacle Terrors way more aggressive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and stronger<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as well.  I am level 21 and they are blue to white to me.  My friend, a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level 30 ranger was helping me raise my 2handed skill (I just got a BBC)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with the TT.  He would draw them out (they are green to him) and take<br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the blows.  They would consistently reduce him to one bubble and myself<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; half my hit points.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The day before they were a piece of cake, now there killing machines.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; They seem to have changed the linking also with the bonecracker.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It used to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be you could pull the BC and the two necros would not come (as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; long as they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were green to the puller).  Now they all come no matter what.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; AND finally blind spell pulling no longer works either.  If you target a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mob, then run to another room (i.e. the mob cant see you) you could cast<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spell and the mob would come running.  This no longer works.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just thought I would share that with you all.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Are you?
