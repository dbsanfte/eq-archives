Asps and Darkweed snakes are a <br/>\ndifferent matter all together.  They have a higher poison and if<br/>\nyou get down in hit points while poisoned, you will probably<br/>\ndie before the time the poison wears off.  I suggest not to <br/>\nfight the Asps and Darkweed snakes unless there is a <br/>\ncleric available to heal you.
