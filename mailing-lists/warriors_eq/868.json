Some of you may not agree with<br/>\nmy method but hey we all choose to handle situations in different ways.  I<br/>\nhave a Character that has the spell Fear.   When I am playing with my main<br/>\ncharacter and someone steals my kill: 1st) I ignore it the first time giving<br/>\nthem the benefit of the doubt. 2nd time)  I politely ask the individual to<br/>\nstop. 3rd time)  I ask them OOC to stop...again politely.  4th time)  If the<br/>\nindividual continues to do so usually by the 4th time he/she has become<br/>\nrather rude. So......I log off.  I log on my Character with the Fear spell.<br/>\nI find this individual.  Each and EVERY time he/she engages and enemy I cast<br/>\nFear upon that enemy.  The NPC turns and high tales it away.  My offender<br/>\nthen has to chase the enemy down if he/she is a warrior or make sure that<br/>\nthe NPC does not get out of the range of their spells if they are a Caster.<br/>\nAfter a couple of minutes I let them know who I am and tell them that I will<br/>\nkindly leave them alone if they leave me alone.  I know some of you will<br/>\nlook down upon this method and I fully understand your veiw.  This usually<br/>\ntakes care of my problem Kill stealers that I am unfortunate enough to run<br/>\nacross.  I even have had one instance Where a fighter continuously stole<br/>\nkills from me after he had agreed not to do so again.  So I logged my Fear<br/>\ncharacter back on and followed this poor sap for 2 hours and watched him<br/>\nchase down each and EVERY kill that he got.  I usually play for about 12<br/>\nstints so when I play I have plenty of time to do this if the need arises.<br/>\nHe finally emoted his character begging me on bended knee to leave him<br/>\nalone.  Revenge DOES work sometimes even if it is not my preferred method of<br/>\nhandling a problem.<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: schlaban yocksovik &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anonymaste@...\">anonymaste@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, May 28, 1999 2:14 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [warriors_eq] Armor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;schlaban yocksovik&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anonymaste@...\">anonymaste@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;no offence but this was pretty stooopid.<br/>\n&gt;I dont want to start a flame war, but this is an eaven larger problem then<br/>\n&gt;farming.
