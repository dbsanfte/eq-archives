I also think that they should be of higher intelligence<br/>\nand be able to become a lizard wizard :)  Sort of like the<br/>\nevil Palanthas lizards from Raymond E.

They said that they would be implementing some<br/>\n&gt; new zones before the expansion as well, and with the expansion comes a<br/>\n&gt; whole<br/>\n&gt; bunch of stuff. Lizardmen race ( which i think the stats are gonna be<br/>\n&gt; something like this STR - high STA med AGI way high DEX way high INT Below<br/>\n&gt; av WIS below av CHA way low) I just hope that this new race is gonna be<br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; than just another race of ogres and trolls, i mean if it is then thats<br/>\n&gt; boring, 3 races and each of them can only pkc 3 classes....BORING. I think<br/>\n&gt; the class break down of the new race will be something like<br/>\n&gt; this..........1.Warrior 2. Rogue 3. Shaman 4. Shadow Knight Now of course<br/>\n&gt; i<br/>\n&gt; could be way wrong about the stats and they might be a really smart bunch<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; reptiles and they may be the evil version of the high elfs or something (<br/>\n&gt; Uh<br/>\n&gt; huh yeah right, who ever heard of a smart lizard....=) ) But regardless<br/>\n&gt; its<br/>\n&gt; gonna be cool to have a continent where the only race is an evil<br/>\n&gt; race....thatll make it good for us Dark Elves to go exploring and not<br/>\n&gt; worry<br/>\n&gt; about getting KOS. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What do you guys think about the prospect of a new race? Think they&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt; smart? like the Dark elves? Or big and powerfull like the Trolls and<br/>\n&gt; ogres...or more of an evil Halfing style, quick and agile...like i think..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lemme know what ya think.<br/>\n&gt; John Zwanenburg<br/>\n&gt; Tips Support/Support Sipt<br/>\n&gt; Tel: (613) 998-2745<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: \tKelly Pruett[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pruett@...\">pruett@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: \tTuesday, June 01, 1999 10:46 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] CAMPING<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Kelly Pruett &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pruett@...\">pruett@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Actually I didn&#39;t know this. :-)  It&#39;s good to hear. I knew there was an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expansion in the works, but I thought that was pretty far out ... like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Christmas<br/>\n&gt; &gt; maybe.

Yeah they<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; making a whole new island south of faydwer area...the new race of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lizardmen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are going to be on that continent. So thats a bonus, Plus ive read<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; verant is also adding about 16-20 new zones on the existing world...im<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sure where but thats what is going to happen, lets just hope they<br/>\n&gt; arent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; newbie areas =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; John Zwanenburg<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tips Support/Support Sipt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tel: (613) 998-2745<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Looking for a new hobby?
