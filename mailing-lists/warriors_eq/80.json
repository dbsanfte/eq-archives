They<br/>\n&gt;generally drop gold, sometimes plat and sometimes they drop axes which you<br/>\n&gt;can sell to PC&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: \tschlaban yocksovik[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anonymaste@...\">anonymaste@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: \tMonday, May 17, 1999 4:22 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] pp gp sp cp.  why dont I have any?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;schlaban yocksovik&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anonymaste@...\">anonymaste@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hmm I hear all this talk about platina....what is it and why dont I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; any?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; heh nah what I realy want to know is if anyone of you know of any decet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cash<br/>\n&gt; &gt; areas?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I realised I was a power player, problem is I dont have any power.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Im a level 10 barbarian and atm northern Ro is where I spend my days.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cash there aint that good.
