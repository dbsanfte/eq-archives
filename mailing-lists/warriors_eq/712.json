I&#39;ve never been able to buy them<br/>\n&gt; (don&#39;t need<br/>\n&gt; to anyway) and when I sell items, she is one of my favorites because<br/>\n&gt; my selling<br/>\n&gt; price to her tends to be higher. I would be intrested to find out SHE<br/>\n&gt; actually<br/>\n&gt; sold them. If so I would have bought one looooongg ago instead of<br/>\n&gt; fighting the<br/>\n&gt; gnoll commander for mine. Or was that the gnoll elites ... don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; remember. One<br/>\n&gt; of the two of them had it spawn occasionally. But mine was only like<br/>\n&gt; AC+3 and<br/>\n&gt; STR+2(or +3 .... damn I can&#39;t remember crap today). I will check<br/>\n&gt; later. I would<br/>\n&gt; be glad to steer new warriors to her shop if she sells them though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Faderic<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dean Boyle wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Dean Boyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gino_14@...\">gino_14@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hail!
