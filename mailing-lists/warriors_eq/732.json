But, having <br/>\nplayed a warrior to level 12 on Zek, and having suffered countless setbacks <br/>\nthere, mostly but not exclusively involving PKs (one time 2 yellow wizards <br/>\nwiped my level 11&#39;s full hps out in less than ten seconds after rooting), <br/>\nI&#39;ve come to the conclusion that warriors are, more than anyone else, forced <br/>\nto wear and use the juiciest items to obtain xp while at the same being the <br/>\nmost vulnerable (after we&#39;ve used our hps to get xp, non-hiders are out of <br/>\noptions without spell-casting bodyguards) and least dangerous/flexible/useful <br/>\nof the classes.  Furthermore, if/when we do get an advantage against an <br/>\nenemy, we&#39;re really bad at actually finishing them off (escaping from us with <br/>\nimpunity is a big option).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard some very encouraging things from some of you more successful <br/>\nfolks contradicting my conclusions and I&#39;d like to hear more.  I&#39;m not so <br/>\nmuch concerned with the PKers as I am concerned that a party of four wizards, <br/>\na magician and a necro might just be slowed down by a warrior tank (best <br/>\ndefense = good offense + we seem to suck at offense more than most casters <br/>\nw/pets suck at defense, etc.)  Many other classes could fit into that group <br/>\nand be less of a drag, I think...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not at all interested in theories or how things look on paper from people <br/>\nwho&#39;ve farted around like I have to 12th or even 16th level.  I am more <br/>\ninterested in hearing how things are actually working/not working for us in <br/>\nthe grand scheme of things before I can seriously committ to trying to make <br/>\nmy warrior work in this game and on RZ.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n-A disgruntled former barb</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
