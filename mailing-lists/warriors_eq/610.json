Im<br/>\nnot an axe type of person so I wont be using any kind of axe (with the<br/>\nexception of exec if I get it, ever).<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont think they should introduce a katana unless its in context.  i.e.<br/>\ntheres a Japanese/Asian style race in the game, and they make them.  I hated<br/>\nhow in UO they had katanas in a European setting with no explanation why<br/>\nthey existed.  Maybe they could make the Lizard Men in the expansion Asiatic<br/>\nand that place would be a good source for Asian weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nId love to have Jaade make a harrowing trip to the Continent of the<br/>\nlizardman just so she can get a katana and a wakazashi.<br/>\n<br/>\nO.K. you know what you have to do, start a petition AND hit /feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the clarification there, so does kith have any meaning/context?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tJynxx[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jynxx@...\">Jynxx@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tMonday, May 24, 1999 1:02 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Question about skill advancement.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jynxx&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jynxx@...\">Jynxx@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;From: &quot;Mifsud, Michael&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Mifsud@...\">Michael.Mifsud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Wasn&#39;t the kith also the name of the Dark Force in starwars? I remember<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;being mentioned in Empire??  Its a nice sounding name.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nopers...it&#39;s the SITH. Those are the term for Jedi who use the Dark Side.<br/>\n&gt; Just thought I&#39;d help ya out there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Ok, now my question. Is there a SWORD that is relatively as good as<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; Tommy? (Polished Granite Tomahawk)....I know I may be being traditional in<br/>\n&gt; the RP sense, but it seems like the best weapons for warriors are axes,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; I usually think of them as having swords. And now that I am on the<br/>\n&gt; subject,<br/>\n&gt; why not a Katana? IMHO those are the fastest most damaging weapons IRL (my<br/>\n&gt; opinion is based on my knowledge of Kinjitsu). I really don&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; waste<br/>\n&gt; my time suggesting it because, like some other people, I am a &quot;hard-core<br/>\n&gt; gamer&quot; and played in and/or tested a lot of online games and I know that<br/>\n&gt; suggestions are very rarely taken into context. Maybe if everyone came up<br/>\n&gt; with some good ideas and we all signed them like a petition and sent it<br/>\n&gt; in,<br/>\n&gt; then they might listen? Well, that is my idea. I want a Katana. Maybe two.<br/>\n&gt; Anyone want to see anything else in the game?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tyveris,<br/>\n&gt; Aspiring Samauri<br/>\n&gt; (with no Katana)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
