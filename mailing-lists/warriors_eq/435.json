With 18dmg, 39 delay, and glowing like a greater<br/>\nlighstone, this two handed sword is calling to be my replacement for the<br/>\nAGI stealing BBC.

My drow warrior is already KOS there, so it&#39;s no big<br/>\ndeal if i kill a few barbarians :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo John - I didn&#39;t catch you on last eve.  Hopefully tonight after work<br/>\nwe can get together and share stories.  I was in Guk and Cazic but I&#39;ll<br/>\ngo anywhere really :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNick</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
