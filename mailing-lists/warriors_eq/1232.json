And the trains are pretty easy to avoid.�<br/>\nSome groups will make it their business to stop trains.� That is they wait<br/>\nfor the train and attack it for the kicks.� It&#39;s a great place for groups -<br/>\neven 8, 9, 10&#39;s grouped have a great time in there.� And it&#39;s the first<br/>\nreally good (for that level) place to get loot.<br/>\n�<br/>\nThe worst part of BB is that it is buggy if you die in there.� I have died<br/>\ndown on the second level (lower) and come back to not be able to find my<br/>\ncorpse. Even the bard says it points to a wall and there is nothing on the<br/>\nother side of the wall.� So, I start asking in /ooc and someone tells me<br/>\nthey see it on the first level (upper.)� Sometimes the guy who dies cannot<br/>\nsee his own corpse but the guy standing right next to him can.� And then<br/>\nsometimes it gets overlayed by terrain textures and if you are lucky - there<br/>\nwill be the toe of a boot or something sticking out that you can click on to<br/>\nloot.� Other times you die and your corpse will be on the bottom of the<br/>\nwater - even though you died on land.<br/>\n�<br/>\nSnyak.<br/>\n�<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tom Swift [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 14, 1999 12:04 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [warriors_eq] Week end adventures<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this was meant for my groups mailing list...didn&#39;t mean to spam.<br/>\n�<br/>\n�<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tom Swift &lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>&gt; &gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;  &lt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt; &gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, June 14, 1999 12:49 PM<br/>\nSubject: [warriors_eq] Week end adventures<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI died alot this weekend.
