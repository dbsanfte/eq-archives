I know it is probably heavily populated, but<br/>\nyou can get alot of FS weapons from the defenders and sentinels which should<br/>\nstill give you experiece as well.  The warders will carry FS also.  Just get<br/>\nyourself with a cleric and pull ones and twos from the tunnels and &quot;try&quot; to<br/>\nget the ones that have FS.  I have made over 100 plat a night in that place<br/>\nwith just a few hours worth of work.  And that was during crowded time<br/>\nperiods.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the temple at th end of the maze is a GREAT place for cash/exp.  But<br/>\nyou should have a pretty good group to go into that area.  Definitely have a<br/>\nwell rounded group i.e. 2 healer/2tank/2nuker.  You will gain xp and cash<br/>\nvery fast in that area.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as weapons are concerned.  Try to get yourself a demons claw and<br/>\ntentacle whip.  The PGT is nice, but the knock to your agi is terrible when<br/>\nthe bezerker strength goes off.  The VERY low speed/damage on these items<br/>\nallows for non-stop attacks.  For armor...  I would recommend saving your<br/>\ncash for Steel plate until you can get into some rubi/mithril/silvered.  I<br/>\nhad similiar problems with people constantly camping the rubicite so i<br/>\ndecided while they were sitting there gaining nothing but wasting a tone of<br/>\ntime.  I would just spend my time reaping cash/xp from the lizards and buy<br/>\nmy armor.  Also get as much bronze as you can in the mean time wihthout<br/>\nspend alot of time/money doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother good money pit is solusek a.  You should be able to go there with a<br/>\nwell balanced group and get around pretty well.  Be wary of the traps and<br/>\nget mobbed by hordes thoug.  Everytime I head to a place like that i have a<br/>\ndruid or wiz that can group gate or succor us out in an emergency (they<br/>\nalways happen *grin).<br/>\n<br/>\nDyvim Kincaid<br/>\nWarrior of Cazic Thule.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Dan Leavy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dan@...\">dan@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 14, 1999 9:21 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] what should i be looking for now?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Dan Leavy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dan@...\">dan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; thanks for the advice....comments below<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David Rogers wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: David Rogers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:derogers334@...\">derogers334@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- Dan Leavy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dan@...\">dan@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level 30 dwarf warrior<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; PGT<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dragoon dirk<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SBH<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; elm recurve bow  =&gt; Ash or Oak as you like it set<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up.  ---<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; yep yep...need better bow!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; +1 str earrings =&gt; Gold-Amber (+3 STR)  - these would be cool )<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; collar of undead prot =&gt; Spiked Collar (+3 STR)  - ive got a spiked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; collar but went in favour of the undead one...with better AC<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blackened helm =&gt; Bronze Helm or B.Iron Crown  --- sorry i<br/>\n&gt; menat B iron<br/>\n&gt; &gt; crown, not blackened helm<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grotesque mask<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BS mantle<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bronze tunic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; barbed arms =&gt; Bronze Arms   --- my barbed arms are only 1 ac<br/>\n&gt; less than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bronze, but give +2 dex<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bronze bracers =&gt; Bracers of Battle  --- yeah ill have to look for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; these...was also thinking of erollisi bracer<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lizardscale cloak =&gt; Bronze Cloak --- lizard is same Ac as bronze but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lighter and plus 5 dex<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bronze pants<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blackened boots =&gt; Bronze or Dwarven Work Boots  --- dwarven<br/>\n&gt; boots would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be real cool...but they are so sought after and rare...i prefer<br/>\n&gt; the black<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ones over bronze as i can kick magic with them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; +5 agi rings<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; jboots =&gt; Or just wear these all the time.  - -- i just leave these in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an inventory slot as i dont need to wear them for the sow<br/>\n&gt; effect..only ac<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Question about the Journeyman&#39;s Boots.
