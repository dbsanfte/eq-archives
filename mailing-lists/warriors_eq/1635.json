Dragons used to take 3 groups working in waves,<br/>\nbut that seems to have gone up to at least 5 now. One person has to<br/>\ncoordinate the groups, make sure they are all doing what they should be<br/>\ndoing. Say 5 groups, A-E we will call them. Group A takes point and attacks.<br/>\nGroup B should be all buffed up and ready to step in. Group C needs to be<br/>\nbuffed with casters medding up. D and E are reserves at this point, tossing<br/>\nout heals as needed. Rotate the groups to next position as a group gets beat<br/>\ndown. If everyone goes in at once, I highly doubt anyone will stand a chance<br/>\nof surviving. Nagafen casts an area affect fear spell that will send<br/>\neveryone running off into the dungeon, so be prepared to deal with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoF and PoH are completely different. PoF I have heard, stay near the edges<br/>\nuntil you all get comfortable there. Once you go over a hill or two into the<br/>\nmeaty areas, it is very easy to get in over your head. Again, mulitple<br/>\ngroups working together is the key here. I would suggest an expedition<br/>\nleader there, who calls targets and such. All it takes in one person who<br/>\ndecides on his own to pull something to ruin everyone&#39;s day. And in these<br/>\nareas, it doesn&#39;t just mean the one death then corpse drag out, it will very<br/>\nlikely include multiple deaths getting your corpses.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese areas were designed such that a single group doesn&#39;t stand much of a<br/>\nchance there. Using ooc or shout is prolly the best way to communicate<br/>\n(guildchat would be even better, if you can get that many people of the<br/>\nappropiate level together from your guild).<br/>\n<br/>\nOglug ~Hand of Chaos~, CT<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Date: Mon, 06 Dec 1999 10:08:32 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: James Wofford &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:James.Wofford@...\">James.Wofford@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Information plz.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone on this list have practical information concerning a way to do<br/>\n&gt; Nagafen, PoH, PoF, and Vox?
