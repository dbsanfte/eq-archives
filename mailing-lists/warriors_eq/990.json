This<br/>\nzone is located in Greater Faydark &lt;greaterfay.html&gt; . If you are coming<br/>\nfrom Felwithe &lt;felwithe.html&gt;  you can hug the zone edge to the right. When<br/>\nyou see the fires in the distance you will realize you have come to the<br/>\nentrance to Crushbone. This dungeon is designed for characters 5-15 with the<br/>\ncastle area holding some mobs to please characters in the low 20&#39;s. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several major portions of this zone. The front area(near the<br/>\nentrance) is designed for lower level characters and contains mostly low<br/>\nlevel monsters(5-8). Up on top of the hill you can find some monsters in the<br/>\n8-12 level range. To the left of the entrance and over the bridge you will<br/>\nsee what looks like a small hill. Beyond that hill leads to the mine area.<br/>\nThe monsters back here range in the 8-10 level range. If you were to turn<br/>\nright at the entrance and follow the wall you would be led to Crushbone<br/>\nCastle. This contains the meaty monsters. You will find many mobs level 8-15<br/>\ninside of the castle. You will also find most of the name NPC&#39;s at the<br/>\ncastle area. The emporer and the ambassador are by far the highest level<br/>\nmobs at Crushbone(levels 18 and 19ish). <br/>\n<br/>\nCrushbone is the originating point of at least two different quests. These<br/>\nare the Crushbone Belts/Shoulderpads Quest &lt;../quest/crushbelts.html&gt;  and<br/>\nthe Screaming Mace Quest &lt;../quest/screamingmace.html&gt; . There are several<br/>\ngood magic items to be found in this zone as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;end clip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get there would be quite a chore for you - I&#39;d think - how well can you<br/>\nswim?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a secret way to get under the city of Freeport and I think you can<br/>\nget onto the docks there.  The dock guards seem to be indifferent to many<br/>\nkinds of travelers.  Take the boat across and sneak thru or around some<br/>\nother cities.  If hummies no like you, I bet the elffies no gonna like u<br/>\nmuch either.<br/>\n<br/>\nSnyak<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tBryan Hinkel [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bjhinkel@...\">bjhinkel@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tThursday, June 03, 1999 2:29 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Warriors_eq@onelist.com\">Warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[warriors_eq] Great Info<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Bryan Hinkel &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bjhinkel@...\">bjhinkel@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tTanks for a da good stuff here!
