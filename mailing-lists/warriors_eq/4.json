I am a lvl 13 warrior,with a mino axe working out of Freeport. I will be getting dual wield at 15 and would like to find a magic one-handed slashing weapon as my primary and my mino as my secondary.

Ant tips or suggestions would be appreciated.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n                               Khariis\r<br/>\n                          Follower of Rallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
