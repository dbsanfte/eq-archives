(Polished Granite Tomahawk)....I know I may be being traditional in<br/>\nthe RP sense, but it seems like the best weapons for warriors are axes, and<br/>\nI usually think of them as having swords. And now that I am on the subject,<br/>\nwhy not a Katana? IMHO those are the fastest most damaging weapons IRL (my<br/>\nopinion is based on my knowledge of Kinjitsu). I really don&#39;t want to waste<br/>\nmy time suggesting it because, like some other people, I am a &quot;hard-core<br/>\ngamer&quot; and played in and/or tested a lot of online games and I know that<br/>\nsuggestions are very rarely taken into context. Maybe if everyone came up<br/>\nwith some good ideas and we all signed them like a petition and sent it in,<br/>\nthen they might listen? Well, that is my idea. I want a Katana.
