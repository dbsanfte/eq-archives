If you can get a group in unrest killing yard<br/>\ntrash, which is in abundance, you can level much faster.  You can even take<br/>\nsome of the lower level house items depending on if you can get some of it<br/>\nin ones and twos.  Soloing is not the way of life for a warrior, they are<br/>\nmeant to be the meat of a group.  You will come to rely on your group more<br/>\nthan anything else very soon when there is almost nothing you can solo and<br/>\nstill get xp.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut yes, the scarecrows were left out of places you can get xp at an ok rate<br/>\nand solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaks<br/>\nSeason 50 Quellious<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tObergfell, Steven [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SObergfell@...\">SObergfell@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tWednesday, December 15, 1999 11:34 AM<br/>\nTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject:\t[warriors_eq] Overlooked Solo hunting for lvls 18 - 20<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Obergfell, Steven&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SObergfell@...\">SObergfell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I would share this.  I&#39;ve notice that not too many folks hunt<br/>\nthe scarecrows at the Miller farm in West Karana.  While the money is not<br/>\nthat great, the ep is pretty good, and there is usually no one there so you<br/>\nhave them all to yourself.  There are 4 that spawn in the fields of the<br/>\nMiller farm.  It is rather safe hunting, as the scarecrows do not help each<br/>\nother (no trains) and there is nothing in the area that is dangerous to you.<br/>\nI have never seen a Hill giant at the farm, and at 18th lvl that is the only<br/>\nwandering mob in the zone you really have to watch for.  Soloing for a<br/>\nwarrior is really tough, but I was able to gain some good ep, in a<br/>\nreasonable time, in relative safety while solo in these fields.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was able to fight 2 in a row before having to rest.  Just make sure you<br/>\nhave lots of bandages!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLefGrebo Halasson<br/>\nWarrior of Halas of the 20th Step<br/>\nThe Tower Fellowship<br/>\n<br/>\n=======================================================<br/>\nThis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may<br/>\ncontain confidential and privileged information.
