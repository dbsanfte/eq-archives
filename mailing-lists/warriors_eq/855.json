The two <br/>\nweapons I use had a base damage of 8 and 6. (Mino axe, and tomahawk).<br/>\nI had a max damage of 17 and 13 (2xbase + 1) on each respectively.<br/>\nIf you are hitting for 25, I would think this fits right in line<br/>\nwith the 2xbase +1 formula.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am more curious as to why you weren&#39;t hitting for max potential<br/>\npreviously.  Were you burdened?  Perhaps at only 80 STR you had a<br/>\npenalty?  Perhaps a bug was fixed and you now are hitting for the<br/>\ncorrect damage.  The most likely thing though I can think of is<br/>\nwas your weapon skill for the 2H slash maxed for your level?  When<br/>\nI&#39;ve been practicing recently, I almost never hit for max with my<br/>\n2H slash, but it is significantly below max (like 20 out of 95).<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, I&#39;m an 18th Barbarian warrior, STR of 120.  So perhaps the<br/>\ncomparison isn&#39;t quite fair.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jeff<br/>\n-- <br/>\n-Jeff Auman<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jauman@...\">jauman@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
