I<br/>\n&gt; told him of the things I have been reading here such as a critical strike<br/>\n&gt; (which<br/>\n&gt; he didn&#39;t think would be accepted), increase what bind wound could do ( he<br/>\n&gt; agreed that it should go up to 70-80%), increased skill cap (no comment<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; him) and unique warrior skill (again  no comment from him). His idea was<br/>\n&gt; to have<br/>\n&gt; the warrior&#39;s  defensives skill be increased some how. That would make the<br/>\n&gt; warrior harder to hit and therefore less damage and less down time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am going to try to get him to join this mailing list since I feel he<br/>\n&gt; could<br/>\n&gt; give great insight. He did say that they were not going to be writing<br/>\n&gt; anything<br/>\n&gt; soon but said something about how a warrior could be tweeked to make a<br/>\n&gt; warrior<br/>\n&gt; awsome.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Azlana<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Got an opinion?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Make it count!
