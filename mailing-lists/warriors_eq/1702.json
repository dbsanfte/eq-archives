Things are not as bad as you guys think.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors CAN still tank better then paladins and sks.  We were never meant<br/>\nto be the ultimate damage dealers.  It has just evolved to everyone thinking<br/>\nwe have to dish mad damage to keep the critter on us to do our job.  The<br/>\nonly thing they have hosed us with is the ability to taunt in higher level<br/>\nsituations.  And to top that off, they remove the taunt to our proccing<br/>\nweapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one has the amount of HP we have, no one has the AC we have.  No one can<br/>\neat damage and stay live like we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind a group where people play their classes instead of just go kill things<br/>\nand you will see what I mean.  If the ranger is getting his ass kicked<br/>\nbecause he is outdamaging us, then he is not doing his job and is putting<br/>\nthe whole group in danger because the cleric is spending their mana to keep<br/>\nhim alive.  Remember, a 600mana rez is alot more mana efficient then 3 comps<br/>\nand a bunch of smaller heals to keep that ranger kicking.  If the paladin or<br/>\nsk is tanking, then they are not doing their job because they are not taking<br/>\nthe damage as well as a warrior.  It is all about how you play your class,<br/>\nnot what abilities you have or dont have.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaks<br/>\nWarlord of Rallos Zek<br/>\nStormrider of Quellious<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tom Swift [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 22, 2001 8:21 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@yahoogroups.com\">warriors_eq@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [warriors_eq] Latest Patch<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to mention rangers!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSoW at 30<br/>\nOffense and weapons skills upgraded to match warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nWTF?
