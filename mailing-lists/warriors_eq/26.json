I&#39;ve trolled this list a little and you guys all seem to give<br/>\n&gt; great advice. I was wondering if you could guide a first time EQ player<br/>\n&gt; on his future...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a level 7 human warrior in Qeynos:<br/>\n&gt; Max 1H-Slash for my level<br/>\n&gt; Max Kick for my level<br/>\n&gt; Max Sense Direction for my level<br/>\n&gt; 30+ Offense<br/>\n&gt; 20+ Defense<br/>\n&gt; 10 or so Bash<br/>\n&gt; 1 in 1H-Bashing<br/>\n&gt; 1 in 2H-Slashing (No weapon yet)<br/>\n&gt; 0 in Hand-to-Hand<br/>\n&gt; 3 in Bind Wounds (I never use it)<br/>\n&gt; 30+ Fishing<br/>\n&gt; 10+ Tailoring (Great combo with the fishing. I make money for the<br/>\n&gt; patterns)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My question is what skills/weapons should I actively pursue more than<br/>\n&gt; others?? I&#39;ve guessed so far just from things I&#39;ve read on the net.<br/>\n&gt; Should I ever put more than one practice in a weapon??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance for replies,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Faderic of Ellorisi Mar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to &quot;Trail Rider,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
