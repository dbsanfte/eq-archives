I am level 21 and they are blue to white to me.  My friend, a<br/>\n&gt; level 30 ranger was helping me raise my 2handed skill (I just got a BBC)<br/>\n&gt; with the TT.  He would draw them out (they are green to him) and take all<br/>\n&gt; the blows.  They would consistently reduce him to one bubble and myself to<br/>\n&gt; half my hit points.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The day before they were a piece of cake, now there killing machines.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They seem to have changed the linking also with the bonecracker.<br/>\n&gt; It used to<br/>\n&gt; be you could pull the BC and the two necros would not come (as<br/>\n&gt; long as they<br/>\n&gt; were green to the puller).  Now they all come no matter what.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; AND finally blind spell pulling no longer works either.  If you target a<br/>\n&gt; mob, then run to another room (i.e. the mob cant see you) you could cast a<br/>\n&gt; spell and the mob would come running.  This no longer works.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just thought I would share that with you all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
