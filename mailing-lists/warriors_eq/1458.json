AC is the second half, and the<br/>\nlesser half, of the armor system in Everquest.  The<br/>\nfirst half is damage absorption.  The armor sequence<br/>\nis:<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked &gt; Cloth &gt; Patchwork &gt; Leather &gt; Ringmail &gt;<br/>\nChainmail &gt; Banded &gt; Plate<br/>\n<br/>\nEach level of armor absorbs more damage than the<br/>\nlevels before it.  If you doubt, try it.  Fight<br/>\nsomething on your level naked and see how badly you<br/>\nget hit; every shot will come in at max damage.  Put<br/>\nyour armor back on and see shots hitting for 2, 5,<br/>\netc... <br/>\n<br/>\nLook at Rangers, who can&#39;t wear better than banded,<br/>\nfighting along side a Warrior.  Ranger in full banded,<br/>\ndual wielding; gets hammered and has to be healed much<br/>\nmore often than the dual wielding Warrior in full<br/>\nplate.  Warrior takes less damage per shot.  Put the<br/>\nWarrior in banded and watch him start taking damage<br/>\nlike the Ranger, needing more heals.  PLATE IS WORTH<br/>\nIT.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlate is a requirement to be an effective tank past<br/>\n20ish.  Now you have to make some concessions for good<br/>\nbuffs (I still wear *my* Spiked Collar for the +3<br/>\nStrength; but it&#39;s just a collar), but you want to be<br/>\nin mostly plate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; collar of undead prot =&gt; Spiked Collar (+3 STR) <br/>\n&gt; - ive got a spiked collar but went in favour of the<br/>\n&gt; undead one...with better AC<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Personal taste.  I value, right now, stat enhancement<br/>\nover saves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; blackened helm =&gt; Bronze Helm or B.Iron Crown <br/>\n&gt; --- sorry i menat B iron crown, not blackened helm<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Stick with the Crown then; +5 STR is sweet and is<br/>\nworth taking the Chainmail hit on the head for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; barbed arms =&gt; Bronze Arms   --- my barbed arms<br/>\n&gt; are only 1 ac less than bronze, but give +2 dex<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See above comments about plate vs chain (which is what<br/>\nbarbed armor is equalivalent to).  +2 Dex isn&#39;t worth<br/>\nthe plate armor value at 30th level.  Get Dex rings if<br/>\nyou&#39;re looking for Dex.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; lizardscale cloak =&gt; Bronze Cloak --- lizard is<br/>\n&gt; same Ac as bronze but lighter and plus 5 dex<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See above comments about plate.  +5 Dex is much better<br/>\nthan +2 for Barbed Arms, but it&#39;s still kinda grey. <br/>\nYou might want to stick with this one, maybe.  It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t protect as well as plate though.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 25th Paladin is set up like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nPG Tomahawk<br/>\nSB Shield<br/>\nBronze Helm<br/>\n+2 AGI Onyx Earrings (2)<br/>\n+7 DEX Grotesque Mask<br/>\n+3 STR Spiked Collar<br/>\n+3 STR, +10 Magic BS Mantle<br/>\nBronze Arms<br/>\n+3 DEX, +1 STR Bracer of Battle<br/>\n+5 STR Bracer of Erollsi<br/>\nBronze Gauntlets<br/>\n+2 STR Rings (2)<br/>\nBronze Breastplate<br/>\nBronze Cloak<br/>\nBronze Girdle<br/>\nBronze Legs<br/>\nBronze Boots<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m currently looking for Dwarven Workboots and a<br/>\nBlackened Iron Crown.  Workboots are a rare drop, but<br/>\nI&#39;m patient (and willing to pay well); problem with<br/>\nthe BI Crown is I *hate* Runnyeye (very dangerous<br/>\ndungeon, imo); and the KS Wizards who show up with a<br/>\nBI Crown aren&#39;t interested in selling.  Every BI Crown<br/>\nI see is for trade only in exchange for caster items. <br/>\nGRRRRRRRR.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to trade my Onyx Earrings for Gold-Amber (+3<br/>\nSTR each), and my +2 STR Rings for Gold-Onyx (+5 DEX<br/>\neach).  If I could just find someone who works Gold<br/>\n....<br/>\n<br/>\nMy current &#39;buff&#39; set up is +16 STR, +4 AGI (which I&#39;m<br/>\ngoing to dump for more STR and DEX), and +10 DEX.  I<br/>\nalso have a Savant&#39;s Cap, two +2 INT rings and a BI<br/>\nMedallion; I can be +10 INT when I&#39;m training skills,<br/>\nwhich comes in hand when you&#39;re naturally 60 INT.  If<br/>\nI can get the Workboots, BI Crown and switch my rings<br/>\nand earrings like I want, my buffs will look like<br/>\nthis: +26 STR, +25 DEX.  That would put STR at 136 and<br/>\nDEX at 115.<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
