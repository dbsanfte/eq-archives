Then I go<br/>\n&gt; hell<br/>\n&gt; for leather, and pull out so I dont get the last swing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also like using my bow to help someone without inflicting the majority<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; damage.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jaade,<br/>\n&gt; Indigo Sista Soldier.&lt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another good thing a bow is for is getting faction bumps. As an ogre<br/>\n&gt; warrior (level 20 CT server) it may be more important for me<br/>\n&gt; than for most of you. In just two levels of camping on the orcs in<br/>\n&gt; HighPass<br/>\n&gt; (maybe 18 hours total time), the guards and citizens<br/>\n&gt; of High Pass are now amiable to me, a huge improvement from the glowering<br/>\n&gt; they stared at. Every time another group was<br/>\n&gt; fighting an orc, I would simply drop a bow shot into it. This gave me<br/>\n&gt; positive faction with every kill that was done, and I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; met a person yet who gets angry at 10 damage going into a level 16-20 mob.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oglug ~Hand of Chaos~<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What was YOUR favorite part?!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Tell other Star Wars fans at ONElist!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
