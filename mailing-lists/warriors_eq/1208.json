Not a lot, but enough to make a decent difference.<br/>\nIf the current skill caps remain the same (level 40) then a Warrior would<br/>\ncap at 245, compared to a Hybrid at 205.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) If the above (1) is not acceptable, then increase the skill cap for a<br/>\nWarriors<br/>\nweapon skills to level 50.   This would do nothing for the Warrior at levels<br/>\nlower<br/>\nthan 50, so I&#39;m not really to enthusiastic abot this idea, but hey, better<br/>\nthan nothing.<br/>\nThis would have hybrids capping at level 40 with a 205 skill, and Warriors<br/>\nat level<br/>\n50 with a 255.  But up to level 41 they would be equal as they are now.  I<br/>\nrealize<br/>\nMinks are the masters at hand to hand... but not with 2 Handed Swords... in<br/>\nthe<br/>\nabove two items, I&#39;m only talking about the weapon skills, and not Hand to<br/>\nHand,<br/>\nOffense, Defense, Parry, Dodge, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Start Warriors with &#39;Bind Wound&#39; at a default level of 50, that can not<br/>\nbe increased<br/>\nuntill attaining level 10.  Similar to the way the racial special abilities<br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) If the above (3) is not acceptable, then raise the bind wound limit from<br/>\n50% hits to<br/>\n75% hits or more.  This would make the skill more usefull, and make the<br/>\nbandages<br/>\nworth the over 7sp they cost. Though this would not aid Warrior&#39;s themselves<br/>\nin any<br/>\nway as a class, it may make the skill usefull enough for more Warrior&#39;s to<br/>\nadopt.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Weapon Specialization.  Done like the magic users specialization skills.<br/>\nYou would<br/>\nhave one specialization skill for each class of weapon (1HS/2HS/1HB, etc..),<br/>\nand it<br/>\nwould decrease the delay of the weapon, not by a lot, maybe 5-10 points at<br/>\nmost.<br/>\nHowever, the first skill to get to 51 (see where this is looking like the<br/>\nmage skill?) would<br/>\nthen become your &quot;Preferred Weapon&quot; and attacks with that weapon would cause<br/>\nmore<br/>\ndamage.  Again, nothing unbalancing, maybe 10-20 points at most.  Some may<br/>\nthink these<br/>\nnumbers are high, but remember that if this was introduced, it would<br/>\nprobably be a 30th +<br/>\nlevel skill, and these numbers are the max on a scale.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Thinking about something I heard earlier about Warriors having problems<br/>\ncatching fleeing<br/>\nfoes, while a mage can Root and finish it off... How about a game-wide<br/>\n(*all* classes) skill<br/>\nof Sprint? It would drain stamina pretty quickly, so it would not be a<br/>\nprolonged thing.  You<br/>\ncould base speed on the Dex stat (which would be good for Monks and Rogues)<br/>\nor have it<br/>\na set speed for all.  The better plan I think though would be like<br/>\nswimming... the higher the<br/>\nskill, the faster the sprint, up to a maximum velocity of approximately 3/4<br/>\nthat of a Spirit of<br/>\nWolf endowed character.  This would serve to purposes... to catch fleeing<br/>\nopponents, and to<br/>\ngive yourself a little adrenalin induced start when forced to flee yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts... If anyone has any input, I&#39;d like to hear it...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
