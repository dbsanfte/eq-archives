I did the same at Misty thicket<br/>\nwith<br/>\nmy store bought bow, even if you miss you get the faction shift.  Two<br/>\nlevels<br/>\nhuh?  What is the real life time you spent then? aprox?<br/>\n<br/>\nJaade,<br/>\nIndigo Sista Soldier.&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAprox 18 hours rl time, from  barely level 17 to almost level 20, with side<br/>\ntrips to Befallen and Najena. Lost 19 twice due to dying. Once an orc<br/>\nfanatic rooted then it and three others walked over to the casters and did<br/>\nthem in before returning for me, the casters were unable to bring them back<br/>\nto me. The shiny brass halberd (16 dam 48 delay, hits magic) was well worth<br/>\nthe time invested.<br/>\n<br/>\nOglug ~Hand of Chaos~ CT</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
