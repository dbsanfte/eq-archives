I have never seen<br/>\nanyone put together so much detail concerning the downers of a warrior.  I<br/>\ntoo have been waiting for the levels when we start to shine as a group<br/>\nmember.  Not just a punchin bag that is expendable because if things go very<br/>\nwrong, we stand and take the death while everyone else can get away.  For a<br/>\nlong time now I have had discussions concerning specialization in a weapon<br/>\nskill or two.  This is mentioned again in this post, I would like to know<br/>\neveryones opinions on this.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDyvim Kincaid<br/>\nStormriders of Cazic Thule.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarrior&#39;s STINK.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay I&#39;ve sat down and written this little thingie over the past few weeks,<br/>\nin places it repeats itself, you may even find it<br/>\nincoherant in places. And hell I&#39;m to lazy to load it up in a real word<br/>\nprocessor to run a spell check (go notepad!). But<br/>\ntake it as it is, I think it still has something important to say:<br/>\n<br/>\nI play a level 46 troll warrior in EverQuest. In most every game I play I&#39;m<br/>\nalways a warrior and fairly happy with the role<br/>\nand abilities warriors are given in most games, wether it be an online or<br/>\noffline game. Now when I was making my troll<br/>\nwarrior I did a little research and heard things like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Warriors get more hitpoints than any other class.<br/>\n- Warriors at high levels do more damage than any other melee class.<br/>\n- Warriors have the best selection of magic and mundane weapons and armor.<br/>\n- Warriors are the most skilled at weapon-to-weapon combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow some of these are things people take for granted about the sterotypical<br/>\nrole of a warrior others are conclusions that can<br/>\nbe made after reading comments made by Verant about warriors (wish I&#39;d<br/>\ncliped the quotes to put here).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for the first few levels I was pretty happy with the warrior, with a<br/>\ntrolls regeneration you can quickly get out of the<br/>\nlower levels. My first observation of an imbalance was that all other melee<br/>\nclasses were advancing just as fast in weapon<br/>\nskills, with 5 additional points of offense and weapon skill each level. So<br/>\nthat a level 10 Shadow Knight and a level 10<br/>\nWarrior would both have the same weapon and offense skills (assuming they&#39;re<br/>\nusing the same type of weapon). So I&#39;m saying<br/>\nto myself what&#39;s the point of a warrior? Our melee skills are not outshining<br/>\nanyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo life goes on, now I&#39;m around level 20 or so and still I haven&#39;t found any<br/>\nequipment that puts warriors above others, our<br/>\nskills are still on par with anyone else. So what about the duel wield,<br/>\ndouble attack issue? Well by this level rangers get<br/>\nthem both, monks get them both (with a higher skill level than any class),<br/>\nthieves get them both. And so well warriors get<br/>\nthem both. So again I begin to question the point of warriors.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I start comparing hitpoints. Well rangers don&#39;t have as many<br/>\nhitpoints.. but they can buff themselves and heal<br/>\nthemselves.. monks don&#39;t have as many hitpoints but they can mend themselves<br/>\n(and don&#39;t tell me, oh but if it fails they get<br/>\nhurt bad, cuz I group regularly with a monk since level 37 and I have yet to<br/>\nsee him fail a mend)... ShadowKnights don&#39;t have<br/>\nas many hitpoints but they have HP drains... Paladin&#39;s don&#39;t have as many<br/>\nhitpoints but they can buff, heal and lay hands..<br/>\nSo in the end I actually end up having LESS hitpoints than most any other<br/>\nmelee class because after buffs and considering<br/>\nhealing and life drains the other melee classes (except rogues) have more HP<br/>\nthan me. But being a troll with a high stanima<br/>\nI get a few extra hitpoints here and there which add up to around 150 more<br/>\nHP over other melee classes (at level 46 mind<br/>\nyou). At level 46 this accounts for maybe two additional hits from a monster<br/>\nworth XP. So a warrior&#39;s benefit is not in<br/>\nit&#39;s hitpoints.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what about armor, they can wear most anything right, so they should have<br/>\nextra high AC? Well not quiet, even tho rangers<br/>\ncan&#39;t wear plate, they can wear most magical versions of it, and they have<br/>\nAC buffs. Paladins, ShadowKnights, Bards can all<br/>\nwear plate also (man the acoustics of playing an instrument in full<br/>\nplatemail must be odd). And of course these classes ALSO<br/>\nhave AC buffs! Then there are monks, well they can&#39;t wear much armor.. but<br/>\nthe lighter they are the more AC they get! So<br/>\nagain I&#39;m left out saying, well what&#39;s a warrior good for?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo someone tells me, well most melee classes skills cap at level 30 and<br/>\nwarriors keep on going. Well level 30 rolls around,<br/>\nand other melee classes keep right up with me. So maybe it&#39;s level 35 they<br/>\ncap, nope. Well maybe they cap at level 40 and<br/>\nwarriors can goto above 200. Well level 40 rolls around and yes other melee<br/>\nclasses do cap at 200, well warriors do ALSO!<br/>\nUGH. I&#39;ve held out so long waiting for some benefit of warriors to shine<br/>\nthrough, kept getting told at higher levels you<br/>\nreally shine! Well I&#39;m at the higher levels and if anything WARRIORS are the<br/>\nWORST melee class beyond level 40 (gauging my<br/>\nexperience with grouping with high level Rangers, Monks and ShadowKnights).<br/>\nIn fact Monks don&#39;t cap at 40! They can go<br/>\nabove 200! But my Parry, Riposte, Pierce, 1h Slash, 2h slash, taunt, bash,<br/>\nALL of them maxed at 200!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then there is the allure of the Executioner&#39;s Axe. A warrior&#39;s dream<br/>\nweapon, the only warrior only weapon known of (well<br/>\nrecently found a warrior only shield/weapon combo item but it ain&#39;t a dream<br/>\nweapon by far) and it is a good item (assuming<br/>\nhaste goes off often enough). But you can&#39;t get it till you are in your<br/>\n40&#39;s, the monster with it rarely has it, rarely<br/>\nspawns, is deep in a dungeon and has a nice assortment of guards. And now<br/>\nthat I finally have the weapon, I find out it is<br/>\nTERRIBLLY handicapped! The haste on it only lasts 10 seconds which at most<br/>\nallows for 3 or 4 swings! And the damage range<br/>\nis so large it&#39;s a hopeless weapon as you never know if you&#39;ll get a hundred<br/>\n9 damage hits or a hundred 80 damage hits! I&#39;ve<br/>\ngone complete fights without doing more than 100HP in damage! With upto 12<br/>\nmisses in a row! In 4 duels, 2 using<br/>\nExecutioners Axe, 2 using Painbringer and Shield of The Slain Unicorn. The 2<br/>\nwith Executioners Axe were a 50/50 chance that<br/>\nif we had gone to death who would of won (mind you I was dueling a<br/>\nShadowKnight who was using buffs but NOT using his other<br/>\nspells and was 4 levels below me). Using the sword and shield combo I was<br/>\nthe clear winner. Not to mention the fact a<br/>\nclass should NOT be defined by a SINGLE weapon they can&#39;t get until they&#39;re<br/>\nalmost level 50!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on a side note why do warriors seem to have to wait LAST to get a<br/>\n&quot;superweapon&quot;? I&#39;ve found (or friends have) caster,<br/>\nranger, paladin &quot;superweapons&quot; and know where an SK one is that we can kill<br/>\nthe monster with it but it rarely has the item is<br/>\nthe problem. Man I&#39;m so fed up. And of course if I had my choice I&#39;d much<br/>\nrather duel wield 2 Ebony Blades as they&#39;re<br/>\nbetter than Painbringer (which btw is a lore, nodrop item so forget duel<br/>\nwielding the only nice warrior weapon I&#39;ve ever<br/>\nseen).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now that I&#39;ve disproved about every advantaged you&#39;d figure warriors<br/>\nwould have here some other general ranting:<br/>\n<br/>\nOn top of all this Monk&#39;s NEVER die if they know how to use Fiegn Death (the<br/>\nmonk I group with has died twice from level<br/>\n37 to 49, while I have died 8 times between level 45 and 46 alone). Shadow<br/>\nKnights have Feign Death (as a spell) and<br/>\ninvisibility! Rangers get similiar abilities (though generally outdoors<br/>\nonly). So most classes have ways to avoid being<br/>\nattacked or ways of getting out of being attacked. Except warriors. So since<br/>\nwe can&#39;t avoid fights and we can&#39;t get out of<br/>\na fight the everything over level 18 is aggressive rule REALLY screws<br/>\nwarriors over as we have to fight through EVERYTHING to<br/>\nget to anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay then I&#39;ve finally found something I can solo for XP when my friends are<br/>\nnot around to group with me. Well in general<br/>\nthose monsters will run away and are deep in dungeons, and warrior&#39;s CANNOT<br/>\nhandle runners! Rangers get ensnares and roots<br/>\n(and Ebony Blades), SKs get darknesses, or heck they have mana to burn<br/>\nthings up with. Even a monk can chase things down<br/>\nkill it and if anyone else attacks they just fiegn death! UGH UGH UGH UGH<br/>\nUGH. SO WHAT IS THE POINT OF WARRIORS?!?!?!? Can<br/>\nanyone tell me?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease? And don&#39;t say it&#39;s a low XP table. The XP tables in Everquest are SO<br/>\nmessed up it&#39;s not even funny. They&#39;re messed<br/>\nup to the point that a monk gets almost 2 levels to my 1 level and the Monk<br/>\nis SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much more powerful than I<br/>\nam, not to mention they RARELY die.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not the lords of battle in any stretch of the mind in the world of<br/>\nNorrath. Look at the original four things I&#39;ve<br/>\nstated. Well I&#39;ve disproved them all. Heck even worse other melee classes<br/>\nspells still improve (and they get new ones) past<br/>\nlevel 40 so that means their buffs get better, but my skills are all parked<br/>\nat 200 (well offense and defense goto 210)! And<br/>\nwell monks they might not have as high ATK as me, but hell they&#39;re still<br/>\ngetting quadruple (!!!!!) punches for over 50 damage<br/>\na hit and kicks over 80 damage! WTF! THIS MAKES NO SENSE. Assuming I got MAX<br/>\ndamage in a single round using a Gigiantic<br/>\nZweihander I would do 130 damage in 3.9 seconds, or with an Ashenwood Spear<br/>\nand Polished Granite Tomahawk I would do 104<br/>\ndamage in 2.4 seconds. But of course I&#39;ve never gotten anywhere NEAR max<br/>\ndamage. Now compare this to a Monks max damage,<br/>\n200+ damage just with punches in approximately 3.0 seconds! This just really<br/>\nsucks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course there are the past few patches. I see things changing for<br/>\nother classes making them MORE powerful and here I<br/>\nsit being SCREWED over ROYALLY. But warriors can wear platemail! Well all<br/>\nother melee classes can wear various forms of<br/>\nmagic platemail (mithril, silvered, rubicite, pick your poison) so that<br/>\ndiscussion is null and void. So in the end I cannot<br/>\nthink of a single advantage warriors have over ANY other class AT ALL. Thank<br/>\nyou Verant for setting me up for the fall. I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t expect warriors to rule the earth at level 50, and I NEVER expect<br/>\nthem EVER to be a heavy solo class beyond the early<br/>\nlevels, but hey at least let us be the kings of melee combat or share the<br/>\ntitle with monks. And with less mana now spent<br/>\nwhen a spell fizzles and spell specilization (in or on it&#39;s way) you&#39;ve made<br/>\nevery casting class just that much more<br/>\npowerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey could double the ammount of damage a warrior could dish out and it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t seriously disrupt things (I&#39;m not saying<br/>\nthis is a viable solution, just that if it was done we&#39;d be the lords of<br/>\nbattle but still couldn&#39;t solo). Hell at level 40<br/>\nI can&#39;t even solo a GREEN Cyclops, yet my monk friend albeit with some<br/>\ndifficulty can at least solo a BLUE griffon). If I<br/>\ndid twice the damage sure I could solo it but then when it ran away I still<br/>\nwould not be able to finish it due to the<br/>\ntons of other monsters that would join in (not to mention the poor<br/>\nprediction code which makes it so hard to chase things).<br/>\nThanks Verant. Damnit I&#39;m so pissed. Why couldn&#39;t you at least let our<br/>\nweapon skills goto 255? Why is a ranger just as<br/>\ngood at me in melee combat and have spells? Why do monks just completely<br/>\nkick my ass? And in a monk vs warrior duel at high<br/>\nlevels the time it would take would be over 5 mintues (or I should say the<br/>\ntime it would take me to kill a monk would be over<br/>\n5 minutes, although a monk could prolly kill me in less than 5 minutes) in<br/>\nlength so a monk would end up getting more than 1<br/>\nmend during the fight making his HP total far outweigh any warriors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I got going for me is being a troll with high regen and some<br/>\nextra strength and stanima. But this doesn&#39;t<br/>\nammount to much considering we can do NO QUESTS (Verant WHERE THE HELL ARE<br/>\nTHE TROLL QUESTS IN GROBB?), I can&#39;t get good<br/>\nfaction with other places enough to do quests. And everything under the sun<br/>\nhates me. The whole faction system is so dumb<br/>\nin the end the only people it hurts are evil races. Bleh well now I&#39;m off<br/>\nthe topic of why warriors get SCREWED, why trolls<br/>\nget screwed is a whole different topic. So goodday to those who&#39;ve bothered<br/>\nto read this from start to finish. If I&#39;ve<br/>\noverlooked something significant let me know. I&#39;d love to know my character<br/>\nis worth something. Warriors from level 42<br/>\nonward GET NOTHING. Oh and our flaunted taunt skill, well the farther your<br/>\nteammates move above level 40 the more worthless<br/>\nthe skill becomes to the point now I can rarely taunt anything off anyone.<br/>\nAnd why when I use a 2 handed weapon does taunt<br/>\nwork ALOT less than when I use 2 one handed weapons? Damnit Verant I&#39;m so<br/>\nfed up, will you quit tweaking every class into<br/>\nsuperhuman beings and pay attention to warriors for a BRIEF second to come<br/>\nup with something besides &quot;Beserking Frenzy&quot;.<br/>\nBeserking Frenzy? This is supposed to be something good? Please Verant, when<br/>\nit says &quot;You have entered a beserking frenzy&quot;<br/>\nthat&#39;s my cue to zone cuz I&#39;m going to die if I stick around. I guess it&#39;s<br/>\nnot fair to complain so much about my class<br/>\nwithout a suggestion or two to make warriors a more viable class to play. If<br/>\nI were to rebalance the warrior class I would<br/>\ndo 2 simple things.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Let our weapon skills goto 255. This includes 1h slash, 2h slash,<br/>\npiercing, 1h blunt, 2h blunt and offense maybe even<br/>\nriposte and or parry. Perhaps not even all the way upto 255 but somewhere<br/>\nabove other melee classes and enough that it<br/>\nmakes a noticable differance in combat.<br/>\n2) Allow a warrior to specialize in 1 or 2 forms of weapons (for instance 1h<br/>\nand 2h slash, or piercing and 1h blunt). Your<br/>\nskill in specilization reduces your weapon delay, not by tons. But lets say<br/>\nyou have a 1h slash specilization of 200,<br/>\nany 1h slash weapon you wield would be swung 10 percent faster than it&#39;s<br/>\ngiven delay, maybe even only 5 percent but<br/>\nsomething slightly faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome other things I&#39;d consider doing:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Let our defensive skills go up higher than 210 also.<br/>\n2) Let us have access to ALL weapon and armor except the class specific<br/>\nitems (robes, monk headbands, bard instruments).<br/>\n3) Make gate potions more available and more reliable (I&#39;ve used a gate<br/>\npotions in which it tells me the zone is loading<br/>\nonly to find myself a few minutes later standing right where I was when I<br/>\ndrank the potion and then promptly killed)<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you did all of these things you are not significantly changing the<br/>\nbalance of the game at all as the warrior&#39;s<br/>\nbiggest weaknesses are still it&#39;s down fall, we can&#39;t get out of a tight<br/>\nsituation, and we can&#39;t heal ourselves. At most<br/>\nthis enables us to keep up with Monks damage wise and also to pull our<br/>\nselves apart from melee classes and MAYBE be the best<br/>\nmelee class. And at least be considered a viable member of a group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne helluva pissed off troll warrior.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
