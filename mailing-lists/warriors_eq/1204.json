I don&#39;t have much of an issue with<br/>\n&gt; warriors vs wizards. They traded hps, ac, and melee ability for high damage<br/>\n&gt; dealing spells. However it appears I agree with many of you that is is the<br/>\n&gt; hybrids that appear to have a distinct advantage over us. The hybrid that has<br/>\n&gt; the most advantage appears to be the ranger. For various reasons I find I am<br/>\n&gt; unable to group with the people I normally play with. I am unable to solo many<br/>\n&gt; mobs even in the blue and green range, and really I have more fun in groups. I<br/>\n&gt; have been traveling to many zones shouting that I am looking for a group, but to<br/>\n&gt; no avail. It appears to me that many groups are prefering rangers over warriors,<br/>\n&gt; and after I read the post on EQ&#39;Lizer I began to realize why.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Advantages Warriors get over Rangers:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - We get Dual Wield and Double Attack at 2 levels lower than Rangers, but after<br/>\n&gt; a few levels they are back on par with us in the damage dealing department. So<br/>\n&gt; as Wayne Sheppard wrote, &quot;the Warrior has no skill advantage over the hybrids.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYour wrong on this 2 levels no.. Yes rangers get duel weild and double<br/>\nattack but duel weild comes at level 17 and Double Attack Comes at level<br/>\n20. I really never have had a problem with a ranger having this ability<br/>\nlet them have it more fun in the game. Not like rangers are master<br/>\ncasters.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Warriors get more hit points. This only appears to be true for the larger races<br/>\n&gt; and rangers easily overcome this by being able to heal themselves, thus actually<br/>\n&gt; taking more pressure off of the cleric to heal them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHrm well I have no idea what parties everyone travels with but the parties<br/>\ni am with people buff me up also. So in turn yes i STILL do end up with<br/>\nmore Hit points<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Berserker Frenzy. As it has been stated before, I see no real advantage to<br/>\n&gt; getting a strength boost and a dex penalty when I am close to dying. I would<br/>\n&gt; rather not get hit more often when I am low on hp. It makes us die that much<br/>\n&gt; quicker.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis i can agree with most of the time when you hit frenzy mode you are<br/>\nbasically dead anyways<br/>\n\t<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Advantages Rangers have over Warriors:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Rangers get foraging. Not much of advantage in combat, but they can help keep<br/>\n&gt; the party supplied with food without any mana cost. They can also carry more<br/>\n&gt; loot since they don&#39;t have to carry lots of food. They just forage on demand.<br/>\n&lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want foraging become a wood elf warrior. ALL wood elfs i belive<br/>\nhave the foraging skill I know for fact wood elf warriors have forage.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Rangers get Hiding and Sneak. This allows the rangers to live longer because<br/>\n&gt; they can avoid more of the deadlier Mobs that would target a warrior.<br/>\n&lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain wood elf warriors have this also<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Rangers get the very useful skill of Tracking. This is a great advantage to<br/>\n&gt; groups because the rangers make the best fetches. They party can heal up and<br/>\n&gt; rest adn stay organized while the rangers are out searching for prey. This means<br/>\n&gt; the party spends less down time and can fight more.<br/>\n&lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>\nRangers should have tracking they are a ranger. And yes they can heal up<br/>\nbut their healing isnt the best in the game it only cuts downtime by a<br/>\nbit.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Rangers cast spells. They not only get some minor healing spells, but also are<br/>\n&gt; able to do root spells, direct damage spells, so they can kick, attack, and cast<br/>\n&gt; spells doing more damage than us. They also get spells that are useful to the<br/>\n&gt; entire party like camoflage and SOW allowing the party to travel more safely.<br/>\n&lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOk boy i seem like a flamer but again. If you want spells play a ranger<br/>\nwarriors should not have spells. and as ranger spell damage. Look at the<br/>\nspells <br/>\nlevel 9 - Flame lick (uhm more like lame lick) it does a whole WOPPING 5<br/>\n\t  points of damage. Boy that sure deals a lot<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 15 - Lighting. At level 15 it is a slower spell to cast it does do<br/>\n\t   25 points of damage MAX. And it burns through mana quickly<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we do get spells beyond this. As for camoflage well yes rangers should<br/>\nbe able to cast this spell seeing they are one of the best at knowing the<br/>\nlands<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Changes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - I like the idea of eliminating the skill cap of 200 and giving us a bonus in<br/>\n&gt; combat related skills. I think it was 5*lvl +10 instead of 5*lvl +5.  Or they<br/>\n&gt; could eliminate the bonus the hybrids get, so they only get 5*lvl. This would<br/>\n&gt; allow a warrior of equal level to show a slight advantage over our hybrid<br/>\n&gt; brothers.<br/>\nI dont think the cap should be eliminated but should be raised much of<br/>\nthat like the monk.. maybe the cap topping off at 240 or something where<br/>\nin the end they will deal more damage but not as much as a pure caster. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - To make it more apparent that warriors excell at combat I think rangers should<br/>\n&gt; not get Double Attack. After all Verant stated that they hybrids gave up<br/>\n&gt; something to get those spells and extra abilities. I don&#39;t see a problem with<br/>\n&gt; Dual Wield because many of us grew up with D&D&#39;s image of rangers wielding two<br/>\n&gt; swords. If paladins appear to be struggling at later levels they might get<br/>\n&gt; Double Attack to allow them to keep up with the rangers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not agree with this at all. Let rangers have double attack sure it is<br/>\nseems unfair but Rangers do not have the all might god spell casting<br/>\nability of a pure spell caster. Look at rangers for a second and what<br/>\nlevels they get spells at. This is what gets annoying to me when people do<br/>\nthis. Rangers have druid type damage spells. Rangers get the spells way<br/>\nlater when mob&#39;s end up being tougher to begin with. You people keep<br/>\nblowing this spell stuff WAY out of the water.<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt; -It&#39;s been stated that at higher levels that the casters are doing so much<br/>\n&gt; damage that we cannot Taunt the Mobs off of them. So I think that Taunt should<br/>\n&gt; be boosted at higher levels causing the Mobs to pay more attention to us and do<br/>\n&gt; our job of keeping thier attention while the caster burn them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is the casters fault.. think about it for a second it seems like you<br/>\nkeep jumping to conclusions. You have 500 hit points. Someone casts a<br/>\nspell on you and hits you for 100 points of damage. And another thing is<br/>\nhitting you for 40 points a round max. The person hitting you for 40<br/>\npoints says some naughty words at you. Who would you kill first? No<br/>\nquestion I would kill the thing that is hitting me harder first. ITS<br/>\nCALLED ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE. Taunt does work i have used it successfully<br/>\nmany of times. The part it seems to be going wrong is your dumb wizard<br/>\nkeeps casting 1 spell right after another. And i think that would piss me<br/>\noff a little bit more then someone saying a few bad words about my mother.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -I also really like the critical hit skill. It should be innate like Parry and<br/>\n&gt; Dodge. It would help us more of an asset to a party instead of a spell casting<br/>\n&gt; warrior that can track like the rangers are now. They just seem to have many of<br/>\n&gt; the same advantages we have and sacrificed nothing to get thier spells and<br/>\n&gt; tracking and other abilites.<br/>\nNow this is something that SHOULD be done... maybe not a critical hit. How<br/>\nabout this just think about it before you start flaming<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors are the masters of fighting melee combat. They SHOULD know their<br/>\nenemy and SHOULD know vital points of striking are. How about a random<br/>\nVital Hit where it would come out of the blue sort of like the mob made a<br/>\nmistake in an attempted hit at you but you dodge or miss because your read<br/>\nthat attack and you used this to your KEEN ability and hit them in this<br/>\nopen vital spot maybe for 1.5 to 2 times the normal damage. Even better..<br/>\nit doesnt start at level 1 or lvl 20. Maybe around level 25 or so you<br/>\nstart to become a more knowledgable warrior being through the years and<br/>\nmany fights. You become more masterable at fighting and you train in this<br/>\nskill with your leader and the better you raise in the skill the more<br/>\noften this vital hit will appear. The good points about this are it will<br/>\nnot WACK the balance out of the game. Warriors WILL indeed be the masters<br/>\nof fighting with this tactic. Warriors would be wanted WAY more by groups<br/>\nbecause of this nice little ability. I think everyone would not mind it<br/>\ndue to the fact that it is not a HUGE ability but it is something that<br/>\nwill distinguish your warrior from ANY other class. Now all of you are<br/>\nprobably saying ONLY 1.5 to 2X DAMAGE?!!?! LAME. well if you say this then<br/>\nyou most likly arent thinking so let me explain why only that much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI carry a nice 2 handed sword. (shows nice weapon)<br/>\nI hit for a maximum of 25 dmg lets say. <br/>\n<br/>\n1.5X that would be about 43 dmg in 1 swing? wow i like that <br/>\n<br/>\n2X dmg that would be 50 DMG in 1 swing with only a 2h sword. NICE damage<br/>\nbut not WAY out of control. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe damage could vary on armor the mob is wearing seeing as yes that would<br/>\nsoak up some damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to hear anyones flames or cheers for this idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKLAEN </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
