In <br/>\n&gt; previous lives I have been a Paladin, a Wizard, and a Monk (not here in <br/>\n&gt; Norrath, but another world/MUD).  There is no better way to experience the<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; world that is Norrath than as a warrior deep in the heart of battle.  I<br/>\n&gt; have <br/>\n&gt; no need to role-play, as I live my role every time my group goes out on a <br/>\n&gt; hunt.  With 500+ hitpoints, two long swords (one combine, the other fine <br/>\n&gt; steel), and no fear of death, I can think of no better true killing<br/>\n&gt; machine <br/>\n&gt; on the battlefield.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Sure magic users have powerful magic spells that cause a great deal of <br/>\n&gt; damage in one shot, but it is warrior that must maintain the fight while<br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; magic users rest to regain mana or run like frightened rabbits to zone<br/>\n&gt; when <br/>\n&gt; they get hit a couple of times.  A good fight for me is my group geting <br/>\n&gt; jumped by five of six MoBs, each capable of killing any one of the magic <br/>\n&gt; users with ease.  I wade into the front and just start hacking and<br/>\n&gt; taunting <br/>\n&gt; until everything is dead in front of me.  Oh sure, I might be down to 5<br/>\n&gt; hit <br/>\n&gt; points (yes it happens), but the group will always remain alive.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   One day I will lead the attack on that silly dragon camped in Sol B.  No<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; other class can truly call themselves a tank, and no other class would be <br/>\n&gt; stupid enough to led an attack on the dragon and expect to live.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of Rallos Zek;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Patty of Halas<br/>\n&gt; username: Patricia<br/>\n&gt; server: Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OOC: I played most classes/races during beta and finally selected a <br/>\n&gt; barbarian warrior.  Role-playing is the best part of this game.  While <br/>\n&gt; on-line and waiting for something to happen I usually never stay in one <br/>\n&gt; place and I am always talking, waiting for something to happen.  Drives my<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; group crazy, but they view me as a blood crazy Amazon and expect me to <br/>\n&gt; thirst for death and battle.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
