I was a solo<br/>\nwarrior there from 8th to 16th and did that in about a week.  Just learn<br/>\nwhere everything is, and I mean everything, know what gnolls pop where.<br/>\nthen just run around kill the ones that con blue all day long. there are<br/>\nso many of them that before you even know it you&#39;ll be about to level.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBashor, Barbarian Warrior on Bertox<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Greets!<br/>\n&gt; My male human warrior is Snyak - bound at Qeynos on Innorruk. I made<br/>\n&gt; level 9<br/>\n&gt; last night - woo hoo!  Twice actually - too many stupid deaths: Holly<br/>\n&gt; got me<br/>\n&gt; when I was not looking, that dang Gnoll Commander in Black Burrow that<br/>\n&gt; hangs<br/>\n&gt; out on the far side of the river on the left once you get down by the<br/>\n&gt; rock<br/>\n&gt; and the first bridge.  One time I tried to drag him back to a wizard<br/>\n&gt; friend<br/>\n&gt; for an ambush but got dizzy and he whacked me good.  Next time, I came<br/>\n&gt; back<br/>\n&gt; with more friends - a wizard and a druid and we tried to gang him.  We<br/>\n&gt; had<br/>\n&gt; him too and then 2 more of his GS buds showed up and we were ded meat<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; that point.<br/>\n&gt; But he is gonna pay for that because I am coming back with all my<br/>\n&gt; friends<br/>\n&gt; and we are gonna hand him a full can of KickButt(tm)!<br/>\n&gt; So, even at level 8 I have been finding it harder and harder to get xp<br/>\n&gt; -<br/>\n&gt; solo or in partys.  I have been doing either BB (for loot) or West<br/>\n&gt; Karanas<br/>\n&gt; (for xp).  Are the aqueducts any good for low 9&#39;s?  I kinda really<br/>\n&gt; hate<br/>\n&gt; mazes and tunnels - I still get lost going to the bank!  Or is it time<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; venture forth?  I have been to N Karanas (hate gryfawns with a<br/>\n&gt; passion!) and<br/>\n&gt; S Karanas near Split Paw one time but MD seemed low then.<br/>\n&gt; One of my goals is to try to catch a cleric friend who is at level 14<br/>\n&gt; (he<br/>\n&gt; got a real job so he can&#39;t play EQ all day long no more :-)  But I am<br/>\n&gt; up for<br/>\n&gt; adventure as well.  And I have spent some time helping others and<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s fun<br/>\n&gt; too.  <br/>\n&gt; Any thoughts?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Star Wars fans are using ONElist to share the fun.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
