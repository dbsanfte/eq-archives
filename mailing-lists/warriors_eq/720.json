People who send about 30+ emails in<br/>\n20 minutes....I check my mail about 2-3 times a day.....there is no need for<br/>\npeople to send a whole letter saying &quot;LOL me too!&quot; or &quot;Wow...&quot; and that&#39;s<br/>\nit. I&#39;ll say on average I get about 200+ emails a day just from this list<br/>\nalone. I don&#39;t want to un-subscribe from this list because it&#39;s EXTREMELY<br/>\nhelpful, and I love the discussions we get into. BUT....when I see the same<br/>\nname come up on my screen 47 times in a row......I figured, why can&#39;t that<br/>\nperson just say what he had to say in one letter? Or even 10, I don&#39;t care!<br/>\nBut 47??!? It&#39;s extremely frustrating to check your email before you go to<br/>\nwork and you have 159 messages in your box, plus the 30 left over from last<br/>\nnight that you were too tired to read.<br/>\n    Ok, all I am saying is this.....could we please trim it a little bit? I<br/>\nam not flaming anyone, and everyone on this list has given excellent<br/>\nfeedback and contributed to this list. So I am not trying to bitch, I just<br/>\nwish it were a little less =]<br/>\n<br/>\nTyveris</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
