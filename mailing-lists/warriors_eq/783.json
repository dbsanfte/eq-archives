But then I didn&#39;t see a gain against blues or higher levels, so I think I<br/>\nneed to put more points in. I&#39;d like to see if it works. I thought I saw<br/>\nsomewhere that you only gain skill against blue mobs or higher. That is what I<br/>\nnotice when I raise my 1H and 2H slashing skills, as well as offense and<br/>\ndefense, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason you occasionally get experience from greens and occasionally have a<br/>\nblue that cleans your clock is because there appears to be a gradient in the<br/>\ndifferent colors. When you con a mob, look at the text. The greens I got<br/>\nexperience from said they were &quot;risky&quot; instead of the usual &quot;looks like an easy<br/>\nopponent&quot; text.<br/>\n<br/>\nA question I have for my fellow Barbarians who travel to Faydwer is: Have any of<br/>\nyou been able to find warrior training on the continent? I was able to get the<br/>\ndwarven guards to view me as amiable by killing CB orcs, but I never could get<br/>\nthe Stormguard Hall Warriors guild NPC&#39;s to talk to me. They woudl say Felwithe<br/>\ndoes not have a warriors guild and the Kelethin warriors guild you cannot get<br/>\ninto since it doesn&#39;t have double doors. I was never able to get inside a single<br/>\ndoor building in Kelethin even by ducking. I never tried getting into Ak&#39;Anon to<br/>\nsee if they had a guild I could get into. It is such a pain to have to hop the<br/>\nboat back to Freeport just to train for new skills. I wish the Warriors guild in<br/>\nKelethin had double doors on it instead of the Rangers Guild. All the large<br/>\nraces cannot be rangers so what is the point? Is anyone else out there<br/>\nexperiencing the sam difficulties? Did I not kill enough orcs? I also cannot<br/>\nturn in the belts to help boost the faction rating that way either.<br/>\n<br/>\nSurtur<br/>\nBarbarian Warrior of the 15th Circle<br/>\nE&#39;ci Server<br/>\n<br/>\nJames Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your skills increase each time you use them no matter what the level of your<br/>\n&gt; opponent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can stand over a spawn spot and swing away at rats and snakes for hours<br/>\n&gt; to build a new wep skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Experience points are tied the level of the opponent though.  But they are<br/>\n&gt; tied to other factors as well.  I can swear that I have killed stuff that<br/>\n&gt; conned green (lower than blue) and have gotten xp from it.  Why? I have no<br/>\n&gt; clue - maybe because you get a quota for each kind of mob in a zone?  Or<br/>\n&gt; something.  I&#39;ll max out on killing young lions which are/were blue and then<br/>\n&gt; have to slay a pesky bear which is green and get xp off the bear but not the<br/>\n&gt; young lion, go figure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As a rule, when I solo, I try not to attack yellows (&#39;...quite a gamble...&#39;)<br/>\n&gt; or whites (&#39;...looks like an even fight...&#39;) and of course not reds.  I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; rather take more easy kills than suffer the heal time between long melee&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt; But I wonder if the gain in xp is worth it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Snyak<br/>\n&gt; Warrior of the 10th Level<br/>\n&gt; Qeynos, Antonica 53226<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The opinions expressed herein are my own and do not<br/>\n&gt; necessarily reflect those of my Guild Master nor my Diety.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                 -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;                 From:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;                 Sent:   Wednesday, May 26, 1999 3:56 AM<br/>\n&gt;                 To:     Warrior Mailing<br/>\n&gt;                 Subject:        [warriors_eq] Skill advancement<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                 From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suzkim@...\">suzkim@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                 Greetings,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                 I think this has been answered but I can&#39;t find the post.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                 Can you only increase skills on critters that con blue?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                 thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                 Az<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;                 ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt;                 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;                 Are you?
