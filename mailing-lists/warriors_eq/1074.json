I only play one or two hours a night five nights a <br/>\nweek.  I appears everyone around my rank (16th, almost 17 I hope) must play <br/>\n24/7!  One day they are 16, the next time I log on they are 22!  Oh well, <br/>\nsuch is life.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess I will have to start over on the new server as a puny Gnome Wizard or <br/>\na Tree Hugging Wood Elf Druid.  Just kidding, there is still no better life <br/>\nthat being a barbarian warrior.
