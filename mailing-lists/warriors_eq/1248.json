Thus they can<br/>\ndish out the damage from spells, Warrior CAN dish out damage but they use<br/>\nmore mundane forms of it. If warriors could dish out damage as much as a<br/>\nwizard i know I would quit playing EQ. Thats the reason i stopped playing<br/>\ndiablo, cause not only could the warrior kill things in one slice with his<br/>\nsword but he could also cast every spell the mage could....talk about far<br/>\nfetched.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tMichael Wooldirdge[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike@...\">mike@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, June 15, 1999 10:05 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [warriors_eq] Warriors<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No matter what you say warriors have one problem and only one flaw as far<br/>\n&gt; as I&#39;m concerned, and that is the fact that other Hybrids can melee as<br/>\n&gt; good as them. Warriors should be the king of melee, period. Wizard&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; should be able to do more damage then a warrior and for good reason.<br/>\n&gt; Wizard&#39;s can&#39;t take damage yet warriors can. One person stated warriors<br/>\n&gt; should be able to do more damage or at least equal well if Verant did that<br/>\n&gt; everybody would 1) quit the game 2) play a warrior. The game would be so<br/>\n&gt; out of whacked if Verant did that. All I think is that warriors should be<br/>\n&gt; doing 5-10 more damage in melee over hybrids.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
