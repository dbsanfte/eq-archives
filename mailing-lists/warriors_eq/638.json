Not only <br/>\n&gt;Rangers, but Paladins & especially Monks seem to greatly diminish the role <br/>\n&gt;of the warrior at levels 25+.  Eventually the other classes have similar <br/>\n&gt;(within a couple of 100 hps) stats and much more diversity in terms of <br/>\n&gt;healing & hth damage capability.  Mind you that my opinion is based on <br/>\n&gt;talking with high level players (who have tried to convince me to dump my <br/>\n&gt;warrior) & from reading on the eqstratics site.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There is an interesting thread on the eqstratics board (warriors) regarding <br/>\n&gt;the perceived lack of differentiation (or all out weakness) of our class at <br/>\n&gt;higher levels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What does the rest of the list think?  Anyone have direct experience <br/>\n&gt;playing these classes at level 30+ & can compare HTH damage & effectiveness <br/>\n&gt;against critters?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rob Wilbarg  aka Flair in Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ** Original Subject: [warriors_eq] Rangers and warriors<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ** Original Sender: &quot;Tom Swift&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tswift@...\">tswift@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ** Original Date: Mon, 24 May 1999 12:26:45 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ** Original Message follows...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This past week I decided to take a break from my level 15 dark elf <br/>\n&gt;warrior.  I was abit frustrated.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I started a half-elf warrior in Kelethin.  It is insanely easy to play <br/>\n&gt;there.  I made level 5 in about 3.5 hours.  Then I stopped and tried a wood <br/>\n&gt;elf ranger.  Has anyone else played a ranger?  I imagine it is the most <br/>\n&gt;poorly balanced of all the hybrids.  After 4 hours I reached level 5 and <br/>\n&gt;got kick.  I am now 12-18 hours into the character and almost level 9.  I <br/>\n&gt;am just as capable as an equivalent warrior.  Next level I gain an array of <br/>\n&gt;spells which will boost my combat effectiveness and allow me to heal.  Part <br/>\n&gt;of the easy success is the plethora of low level orcs available a stone&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;throw from Kelethin.  With my tracking ability I am never at a loss for <br/>\n&gt;targets and I can engage blue con orcs in rapid succession or even 2 at a <br/>\n&gt;time. I can even engage and successfully beat yellow con orcs more than 50% <br/>\n&gt;of the time and almost always can kill orcs that con even to me without <br/>\n&gt;trouble. So far it seems that I get as many hit points now as my warrior <br/>\n&gt;did.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My point is, with a ranger class as powerful a combatant as it is I see <br/>\n&gt;little necessity for the pure warrior.  I am going to play through to level <br/>\n&gt;15 I think, just to see a more even comparison.  My concern is only from a <br/>\n&gt;game mechanics perspective though as I have no doubt my playing as a dark <br/>\n&gt;elf was a much more rewarding experience.  Has anyone else noticed that the <br/>\n&gt;warrior just is not different enough from the hybrid fighter classes?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bael                                                    Aelyn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Warrior of the 15th Order      or              Ranger of the 8th Rank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Indigo Brotherhood                                Humble Servant of <br/>\n&gt;Tunare<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; still undecided<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;** --------- End Original Message ----------- **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
