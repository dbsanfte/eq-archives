With 18dmg, 39 delay, and glowing like a greater<br/>\n&gt;lighstone, this two handed sword is calling to be my replacement for the<br/>\n&gt;AGI stealing BBC. Thing is though, the website only said it would be<br/>\n&gt;found on a roaming barbarian in everfrost. Does anyone know which<br/>\n&gt;barbarian has it?  My drow warrior is already KOS there, so it&#39;s no big<br/>\n&gt;deal if i kill a few barbarians :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To John - I didn&#39;t catch you on last eve.  Hopefully tonight after work<br/>\n&gt;we can get together and share stories.  I was in Guk and Cazic but I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;go anywhere really :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Nick<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today.<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
