Rangers<br/>\njust could not cast spells in plate mail. For all intents and purposes the<br/>\nranger was EXACTLY the same as a fighter, except a few VERY minor things.<br/>\nThey get 1d8 hit die instead of 1d10 like a fighter, yet they still get the<br/>\nconstitution bonus. They still get the strength bonus, but were limited in<br/>\nweapon specialization. They got the same number of attacks per round, except<br/>\nat higher levels and even then it was only a half-attack (every other<br/>\nround). Look closely at any AD&D table except experience. They group<br/>\nFighters, Rangers and Paladins all into one group, subclassed the<br/>\n&#39;fighter-type&#39;. But I am not trying to argue the fact of rangers vs.<br/>\nwarriors vs. paladins..... Just warriors vs. damage of other classes. maybe<br/>\njust having some really sweet warrior only weapons would be better than<br/>\nadding new skills? I mean a warriors strength is his weapon, and warriors<br/>\nare supposed to have the greatest variety of weapons, right? Oh well, I<br/>\nguess it&#39;s becoming a moot point. I am starting to get very opinionated (too<br/>\nlate hehe) about this subject, mainly because I like to solo sometimes and<br/>\nat 10th level I really couldn&#39;t do that anymore because monsters were<br/>\nhitting me for twice as much damage as I was hitting them for, and twice as<br/>\nfast. Ok, I am done....sorry for the mindless banter    ;-}~<br/>\n<br/>\nJynxx</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
