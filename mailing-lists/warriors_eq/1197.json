You can dish it out. No, you can&#39;t hit<br/>\n&gt; for 1100 in one shot but there&#39;s a point to that. Yes, you should be<br/>\n&gt; able to absorb more punishment than any other class, and you can. And<br/>\n&gt; yes, you can deal out a fair amount of damage, arguably the best of the<br/>\n&gt; melee classes. (Though yes that gap narrows at higher levels)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Actually, I&#39;m going to leave this thread alone from here on out. I see<br/>\n&gt; this thread in every friggin mail list related to class. The wizards<br/>\n&gt; think they are getting ripped, warriors too, enchanters, mages and<br/>\n&gt; bards...well bards may have a point. Everyone complains about their<br/>\n&gt; class and how another class is better.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The point of these lists, if I&#39;m not mistaken is to exchange strategies<br/>\n&gt; and means of development, NOT whine about your desires for the class.<br/>\n&gt; That is not to say that such discussion shouldn&#39;t happen. I just don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think it should be in this forum. I get tired of reading notes from<br/>\n&gt; each of the class lists that I subscribe to and 1/2 of the content<br/>\n&gt; contains complaints about the class and how everyone needs to petition<br/>\n&gt; verant. (The cleric list seems to be the exception, they seem quite<br/>\n&gt; happy with their class. Uh oh, that must mean they are overbalanced!<br/>\n&gt; &lt;sg&gt;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;dismounts the soapbox&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wait until you get your warrior past the newbie<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stages (somewhere around<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level 20).
