However ... I&#39;ve played many many muds and other online games. It<br/>\nwill never happen. What I usually end up doing is this ... get the less sought<br/>\nafter item. I mean after all, what are we talking about here? Something that will<br/>\ngive a few more damage over an extremely long fight. So either,<br/>\nA.) Sit and camp and be happy, or pay a high price that takes a month to save for<br/>\nand be happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOR<br/>\n<br/>\nB.) Do with something &#39;not as good&#39; but easily obtained. And be moderately happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve taken plan B many, many times simply because it&#39;s easier and I enjoy the game<br/>\nmore. If, by chance I come upon a great situation in which I can obtain a valuable<br/>\nitem, I do it. Otherwise, just have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember a mud once where a particular item had a mob that required over 20<br/>\npeople coordinating an attack against it just to win. Imagine the nightmare of<br/>\ntrying to establish who gets looting on that. Screw that. I&#39;m out for fun ... not<br/>\nfrustration.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faderic<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNick Morgowicz wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; The price should not be for the people who spend 24 hours a day, 7 days a week<br/>\n&gt; playing.
