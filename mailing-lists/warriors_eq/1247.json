Warriors should be the king of melee, period. Wizard&#39;s should be able to do more damage then a warrior and for good reason. Wizard&#39;s can&#39;t take damage yet warriors can. One person stated warriors should be able to do more damage or at least equal well if Verant did that everybody would 1) quit the game 2) play a warrior. The game would be so out of whacked if Verant did that. All I think is that warriors should be doing 5-10 more damage in melee over hybrids.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
