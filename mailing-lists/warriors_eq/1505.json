More HPs save<br/>\nyou from dying.  I know I&#39;ve zoned with less that 20 HPs many many times.<br/>\nAnd there have been many times when I died just short of the zone.  If I had<br/>\njust a few more HPs, I could have made it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore HPs is something many Warriors have demanded.  They felt insulted when<br/>\na hybrid with the same race and STA can have the same HPs as a Warrior.<br/>\nThis is something that should have been in the game from day 1.  To say that<br/>\nmore HPs are pointless and only makes you wait longer to regen them is<br/>\nridiculous.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I came up with that I think would be much more useful:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The only reason I didn&#39;t comment on your other suggestions is because I<br/>\nagreed with them for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;1: Increased chance of hitting with an attack (increased over the hybrids<br/>\n&gt;anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.  Make the cap on Off/Def   6*lvl+5   or   5*lvl +10<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2: Remove or change Berzerker Frenzy.  It is not a help, it&#39;s a hinderance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.  Make it an active skill usable once a day or something.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;ll reiterate my other one, even though it doesn&#39;t relate to the above.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3: Make Kick and Bash/Slam non-mutaually exclusive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like it the way it is.  Soemtimes is it better to kick.  Othertimes you<br/>\nwant to bash (for the stun).  Being able to do both at the same time would<br/>\neliminate a choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
