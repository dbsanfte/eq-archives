Some of you may not want to &gt;see this, <br/>\n&gt;but at gameznet.com/eq there is a new post about the &gt;success at duel <br/>\n&gt;wielding and double attack.  With all these updates &gt;you guys would nonstop <br/>\n&gt;4 hit attack. Now, I see how as of right now &gt;the warrior are worse than <br/>\n&gt;the SKs, pallys, and rangers.  But if you &gt;do much to the warriors you guys <br/>\n&gt;will be able to blow us away.  I&#39;m &gt;a troll SK and my guys is mainly a <br/>\n&gt;warrior with a few spells.  If you<br/>\n&gt;do all these things you people have listed to the warrior class then <br/>\n&gt; &gt;warriors will be a super class, be reasonable.  Ask for some small <br/>\n&gt; &gt;changes.  Not letting their skills increase at 6 a lvl and go up to &gt;300 <br/>\n&gt;AND ask for weapon specialization.  A warrior would outdamage a &gt;gd WIZARD! <br/>\n&gt;  You people are crazy if you except them to make that &gt;kind of change.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hehehehehehehe<br/>\n<br/>\nHummm let&#39;s see.
