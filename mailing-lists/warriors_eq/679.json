Blackend is lower AC and much heavier than ringmail.....but it does look cool :)  which is why I&#39;ve a got a full set myself :)<br/>\n<br/>\nps.  to me, the point of dual wielding it to get a large number of attacks.  Wielding a weapon with the delay of a good 2h sword kinda defeats the purpose.  Not to mention that your dual attack is based in part on the speed of your primary weapon.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, the mino is a GREAT weapon for 1h slash, but when you hit 15th and get double attack and dual wield there are much better weapons to be used, IMO<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Dean Boyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gino_14@...\">gino_14@...</a>&gt; 5.24.99 9:35:39 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Dean Boyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gino_14@...\">gino_14@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  When I get Duel Weild I&#39;m prob. going to go with the best Mino.

Is this <br/>\nautomatic and I&#39;ve never seen it been used.  Is this skill even working and <br/>\nis the skill going up?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve just gotten Blacken Armor and replaced it with my banded and ringmail <br/>\narmor!  Man, the weight is so much lighter and the AC is much more better!  <br/>\nI suggest any lvl 12+ people go to the RiverVale area hunt though goblines <br/>\nand get that armor! + is looks so cool!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\nAre you?
