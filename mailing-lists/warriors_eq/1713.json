Before Crafted. \nHeck beserk did not even get added to the game before I hit 16th. Those were the \ndays the rangers were king. I even remember having the same skill caps for O and \nD too. I was so dreading having to camp Rubi or buy steel armor. 500 plat is a \nheck of a lot for a warrior.

I wish they had fixed \nthe combat system instead. Do you remember when the 10/21 Spined dragon Claws \nwere one of the best weapons in the game. I can now get the as good or better \nLamentation (9/19 6 str/stm 20 HP) on a much easier camp (LOL if you can camp \nthe draco-lich).
