Warriors<br/>\nare always (with proper equipment) approximately 10-30 points higher on AC<br/>\nfor each given level.  This may seem insignificant, however, EQ uses these<br/>\nsorts of tiny differentials as the basis for damage calculations.  Given<br/>\nthe way AC advances (3-5 point increase purely on level alone) there are<br/>\neasy ways for EQ to &#39;normalize&#39; the AC vs. Offense to determine relative<br/>\ndamage levels for enemies of similar level.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonks are _not_ as good tanks as Warriors because of this difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Studded, that is merely the trade skill version of Leather Armor.<br/>\nThere is nothing &#39;better&#39; about it.  I think its nice to have Studded<br/>\nbecause it looks nice when you examine someone.  But there is no<br/>\nadditional advantage over Leather.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps,<br/>\nDrew</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
