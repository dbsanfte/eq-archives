But a full party with 2 warriors and 1<br/>\n&gt;&gt; cleric plus other assorted baggage is a group that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; can take much higher level mobs without losing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; members.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Right on the money; here&#39;s a very graphic example of<br/>\n&gt;this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In Unrest, grouped (16s-19s) with three tanks, two<br/>\n&gt;clerics and a wizard, we cleaned up *anything* we<br/>\n&gt;could pull from the first two floors of the house (up<br/>\n&gt;to and including Carrion Ghouls and Skeleton Monks,<br/>\n&gt;and the occasional Barbed Bone Skeleton - all red to<br/>\n&gt;all of us).  Grouped (16s-19s) with only 1 tank (me),<br/>\n&gt;two clerics, two wizards and one shaman, we could<br/>\n&gt;*not* take Skeleton Monks or Barbed Bone Skeletons<br/>\n&gt;because the Wizards were dead weight then (resists),<br/>\n&gt;the Clerics didn&#39;t have enough healing to keep me up,<br/>\n&gt;and I didn&#39;t have the firepower alone to take them<br/>\n&gt;down before everyone was OOM and it was still at half<br/>\n&gt;life, laughing at us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Those who think they can hunt without tanks are right,<br/>\n&gt;if they&#39;re willing to *only* hunt blues and whites. <br/>\n&gt;If they want to hunt &#39;up level&#39; from themselves, in<br/>\n&gt;yellows and reds, they have to have tanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My prefered party always has three tanks, period.  My<br/>\n&gt;most fun ripping and shredding party would be four<br/>\n&gt;tanks and two clerics (but my friend&#39;s a wizard, and I<br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t just throw him away like that).  But with three<br/>\n&gt;tanks and a pair of clerics, you can use the 6th slot<br/>\n&gt;as a wildcard to fill with a bard or wizard or<br/>\n&gt;whatever.  Enchanters go especially well, their<br/>\n&gt;debuffs make fights a lot easier.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;===<br/>\n&gt;:D<br/>\n&gt;       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n&gt;-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&gt;&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\n&gt;believe it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;First Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n&gt;_________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt;Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
