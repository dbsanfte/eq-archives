When most hybrid-magic user classes get to that level they can<br/>\n&gt;either root, or get a pet that will engage the creature while he or she<br/>\n&gt;casts (wherein they usually don&#39;t need long because they deal out the most<br/>\n&gt;damage).

It does not take close to 30<br/>\nminutes for a lvl 17 warrior to heal up.  And if you grouped with a healer,<br/>\nyou wouldn&#39;t have to wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to be offensive, but warriors cannot solo due to the time it<br/>\ntakes to recover hp&#39;s.  This is part of the design of the game.  The higher<br/>\nlevel you get, the harder it will be to solo.  Some classes will be able to<br/>\nsolo longer than other classes, but eventually, every class will be forced<br/>\nto solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you are only level 17, how do you know what is necessary in groups<br/>\nabove the mid-20&#39;s?  Many people on this list state that a warrior or two is<br/>\na needed part of a high level group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
