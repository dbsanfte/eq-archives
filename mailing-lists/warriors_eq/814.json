We can take tons of damage but<br/>\nsimply can&#39;t dish out enough compared to mages.  I know that alot of blues<br/>\nstart to give warriors trouble in the level 15 range....although we can kill<br/>\nthem they hit alot more often than blues did at lower levels.  Sometimes I<br/>\nget lucky and can kill it with only losing a single bubble of health, other<br/>\ntimes I am down to one or two bubbles and I have to go &quot;buttdown&quot; for 15<br/>\nminutes or so before I can get back into action. I assume that as I get<br/>\nhigher in level it will only get worse.  Any comments?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, is there a magic item that gives any kind of regen ability?

I imagine it is the most<br/>\n&gt;&gt;poorly balanced of all the hybrids.  After 4 hours I reached level 5 and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;got kick.  I am now 12-18 hours into the character and almost level 9.
