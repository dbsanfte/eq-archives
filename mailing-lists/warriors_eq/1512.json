But thats it.  It takes experience to know<br/>\nwhen to run.  As a general rule if I get below half a full bar of health and<br/>\nthe creature isn&#39;t close to the same (in a solo situation) then I will turn<br/>\nand start running.  That leaves enough hit points to hopefully make it to a<br/>\nsafe spot.  Berzerker frenzy is like giving a caster 20 extra hit points<br/>\nwhen they get down to 35% of health :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAngarth Bladedancer, Warrior of the 21st Tier<br/>\n&quot;Periissem ni periisem&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tmark mark[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:markerob@...\">markerob@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, July 20, 1999 12:06 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRE: [warriors_eq] berzerker<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;mark mark&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:markerob@...\">markerob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; hey guys,,, need some advise with this.<br/>\n&gt; I would like to know if I&#39;m using berzerker right.  From my experience it <br/>\n&gt; only kicks in when my hp&#39;s are really low,, just before that point where I<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; need to run; however usually by the time it kicks in I am only a hit or<br/>\n&gt; two <br/>\n&gt; from the point where I can no longer run... well that is unless I am very,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; very close to a zone, which dosn&#39;t happen very often.  So the only<br/>\n&gt; realistic <br/>\n&gt; use I can think of is a reminder that I need to evaluate my situation and <br/>\n&gt; think about getting out of there while I can, if possible.  My hits don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; seem to change much when I enter berzerker either, can&#39;t say that for the <br/>\n&gt; mobs though.  They hit me twice as hard with almost every hit when they<br/>\n&gt; get <br/>\n&gt; down to one bubble, very annoying to loose one bubble of hp for most of<br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; fight and then two bubbles while you are just finishing them off.  Hey, If<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; there is any stradegy to using it please let me know,,,,, I really want<br/>\n&gt; to, <br/>\n&gt; but can&#39;t figure out how......need every bit of help I can get  8)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Arathorne, Solsek Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enter ONElist&#39;s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; By joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY PROGRAM.
