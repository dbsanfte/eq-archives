Your really living<br/>\nin a fantasy world.  Just so you know, I&#39;m 6 foot 4, weigh in around 255.  I<br/>\nexercise regularly, and consider myself in good shape.  I regularly play<br/>\nbasketball ( full court), put in about 20 miles a week in road work.  I went<br/>\nto school on a football scholarship (Athlete), and as I said I&#39;ve been<br/>\nfighting in 100lbs of armor with 5 lbs swords for about 10 years. No, I have<br/>\nnot trained all my life, and I&#39;m not a Troll, though I have been compared to<br/>\na barbarian on the field :).  Whilke I need a rest every 5  minutes or so of<br/>\nsrenuaous activity in armor, I do tend to wear all day, and fight all day,<br/>\njust not continueously.  Oh, if anyone&#39;s interested, there will be a large<br/>\nInvitational Atournement for this kind of martial art (Medival<br/>\nswordsmanship) in Vegas next October.  Look for it as an Xtreme game.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, let&#39;s look at this in a purely historical context.  The Norman knights,<br/>\nwho did train all their lives, could usually last between 10 and 15 minutes<br/>\nin the heat of battle before having to withdraw.  This is documented very<br/>\nwell at the Battle of Hastings 1066AD.  Of course, mounted knights faired<br/>\nmuch better.  The thing to remember is that in a day long battle (they<br/>\nactually only lasted a few hours)  The fighting was not fast and furious,<br/>\nbut consisted of a series of pushes and withdrawals.  In between, everyone<br/>\nrested.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Wayne, why don&#39;t you tear yourself away from the screen, go outside and<br/>\ntry some of these things for yourself.  ya know, the stuff in the computer<br/>\nis supposed to simulate what is happening out here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Wayne Sheppard [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, June 11, 1999 12:43 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Digest Number 60<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Date: Fri, 11 Jun 1999 09:32:11 -0700<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: &quot;Obergfell, Steven&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SObergfell@...\">SObergfell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Petition or Melee vs. Caster damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;But the Warrior does have a limiting factor: Stamina.  Once <br/>\n&gt; again, I will<br/>\n&gt; &gt;draw from my experience in wielding broad swords in real <br/>\n&gt; life.  After about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;3 to 5 minutes of constant fighting, in 100 lbs. of armor <br/>\n&gt; guess what, you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;are wiped out and need to rest a bit.  Just like the mage <br/>\n&gt; has to rest while<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dealing out those spells, we warriors should need to rest <br/>\n&gt; after fighting in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;all that armor and swinging that 3 to 5 lbs. sword around, 9 <br/>\n&gt; lbs. in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;case of great swords.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once again, your real life experiences have no bearing on EQ, <br/>\n&gt; a fantasy<br/>\n&gt; role-playing game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe you need a rest every 3-5 minutes because your stamina <br/>\n&gt; is much lower<br/>\n&gt; than that of a troll or barbarian.  Maybe if you spent your whole life<br/>\n&gt; training to be a warrior, you would have greater stamina.  EQ <br/>\n&gt; Warriors can<br/>\n&gt; fight longer than your 3-5 minutes because they exercise <br/>\n&gt; instead of playing<br/>\n&gt; video games.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wayne<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=======================================================<br/>\nThis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.
