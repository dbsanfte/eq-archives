Just train through the window.<br/>\nI think it is still possible, before you could bank through the<br/>\nwindow too but they moved the banker witht the new patch I think, they might <br/>\nhave done the<br/>\nsame witht the warrior trainer<br/>\nIn Ak&#39;anon its easier but dangerous, I got stuck there once and had to kill <br/>\nmyself to<br/>\nget out (no gm was on). just walk up to one of the robot guides and say <br/>\nwhere warrior guild<br/>\n<br/>\nwhen you get there take a right and then its behind one of the doors.<br/>\nBut dont fall in the hole thats in the area.....its a pain to get up (read <br/>\nimpossible)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Rogers: running through runneyey<br/>\n<br/>\nI havent times it but I think more then 30 seconds through is slow.<br/>\nIm probably gona go back to qey soon And I can time it then hehee<br/>\nIf you are going to qey you will go riverval,runnyeye,beholders maze, <br/>\nkaranas<br/>\nbeholders maze is easy too. If you take it easy. all I have encountered <br/>\nthere<br/>\nare the easier for of minos and lesser mudites. The path from runny zone to <br/>\nkarana zone<br/>\nisnt realy crowded. just keep the wall on the left side at all times and you <br/>\nwill get<br/>\nto karanas pretty fast.<br/>\nI read lots of posts saying that it can take several hours to travel from <br/>\nfree to qey.<br/>\nThats only if you run the water ways I think.<br/>\nI always run the path(done the trip 10+ times and I have gotten killed <br/>\none(stupidity)).<br/>\nIf you do it once and you know the way its not that hard. then its &quot;only&quot; <br/>\nthe<br/>\ngriffs,giants,eyes and bandits that can psuh you around heheeh.<br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck<br/>\n<br/>\nDubas:   Bronze armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere shouldnt be more bronze in the game IMHO.<br/>\nBronze wasnt made for level 13 players. Im 15 and Im 1 piece away from full <br/>\nbanded.<br/>\nI guess there are server differances but 40pp for nice armor?  I think thats <br/>\na decent prize.<br/>\nPersonaly Im just gona get a bronze helmet for now so I dont have to go <br/>\naround lookin like a fool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people will always take the easy route, when I strted playing the char <br/>\nI play now I saw a level 7<br/>\nwarrior un full STEEL plate, no no stinkin bronze.....but how fun is it for <br/>\nhim the next 20 or so<br/>\nlevels when he cante upgrade anything and he wont get to earn anything <br/>\nhimself.<br/>\n<br/>\nbut the problem remains...if someone would give me the best armor in the <br/>\ngame would I say no?<br/>\nhehe hell no, Id take it and wear it all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat do I want to say with this?  I have no idea.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
