I have no respect for farmers.  If<br/>\nthey won&#39;t take turns on rare spawn item I will kill-steal it.  I am a<br/>\ndark-elf after all.  I don&#39;t necessarily like doing this, but when a group<br/>\nhas been farming a spot for days and refuses to share the spawns there isn&#39;t<br/>\nreally any option.  So when the creature spawns....my group attacks it.  We<br/>\ntry to get it first and then accuse them of kill-stealing...which is true<br/>\ndepending on your perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just think that farmers ruin the spirit of the game.  I never camp a rare<br/>\nspawn item for more than an hour or 2 spawns whichever comes first.  I<br/>\nrespect those who camp a spot so they can have that awesome weapon they<br/>\nreally want but can&#39;t afford....but I depise those who camp a spot so they<br/>\ncan sell the items.  It just isn&#39;t in the spirit of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my opinion.  I know some of you won&#39;t approve of my method of dealing<br/>\nwith farmers, and you are entitled to that.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
