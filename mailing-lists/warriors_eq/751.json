If you say so.  I call Paladins &#39;self-filling tanks&#39;,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because they are just that.  They&#39;re not really effective until they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get Meditate at 12th, but once there they can do a solo fight that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; drags them down to 1 bar of HP; and be back in another fight in 7-10<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mins.  For a corresponding warrior, it would be 13-18 mins, or more.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lay On Hands is the Panic Button; you can push it to get out of jail,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or at least, have more time to either finish off the mob or run for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; safety. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; As for the spells being 9 levels behind, so?  Paladins are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fighter/healers, while Clerics are healer/fighters.  Clerics can be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mini-tanks up until about 9th or 10th; but Paladins can tank all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; way to 50.  The ability to tank and still have a reserve to compliment<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the party&#39;s cleric is useful.  Past 10th, Clerics are 80%+ casters for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all realistic intents and purposes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Paladins don&#39;t get Kick; but at 6th they get bash which I personally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like much better.  Kick won&#39;t interrupt casting, while Bash will.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stopped using Kick with my Troll Warrior when I got Bash (which let my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Slam start being much more effective)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you&#39;re fixated on Dual Wield (which I think you might be, since you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mentioned Rangers; and they&#39;re the only hybrid, that I recall, that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gets Dual Wield); that might explain why you like Warriors and Rangers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the most.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Personally, I think the jury&#39;s still out on Dual Wield, and on melee in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; general.  The further up you go, the more the offensive and debuff<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spellcasters really carry the fight to the mobs; the tanks are just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there to do what their name says.  If this is proven out, then Dueal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wield or no, the tanks are just there to soak damage.  If this is not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; proven, then Dual Wield still has to debate against the endless fighter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; arguements of Dual Wield vs 2H Weapons (which is one of those semantic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; arguements, IMO; stats bear each out)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; For grouping, I&#39;d prefer to have pure tank in the tank slot, any day of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the week; with a Paladin fighting alongside him.  (my ideal 6man group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is 2 Warriors, 1 Paladin, 1 Cleric, 1 Wizard, 1 Bard; haven&#39;t assembled<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it yet, but it sounds fun!) For soloing, however, the Paladin is more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; efficient than the Warrior.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ===<br/>\n&gt; &gt; :D<br/>\n&gt; &gt;        Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; believe it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; First Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _____________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Free instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist:  bringing the world together.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; ONElist has over 150,000 e-mail communities from which to chose!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to &quot;M-K-ROSES,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; For the Honor and Glory of the Warlord, Rallos Zek!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
