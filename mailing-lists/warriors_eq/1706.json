This \n    impacted ALL classes &amp; not just warriors. To be honest in 5 hours of \n    Howling Stones last night Ididn&#39;t notice the difference (i.e. with my \n    Bloodpoint &amp; werewolf form I still saw plenty of agro).<br>3) Warriors \n    were only &quot;useless&quot; the first 6 months of the games existence...I know I \n    experienced it first hand (same armor, weapons &amp; hps as everyone else \n    with zero distinguishing skills) .&nbsp; These days with decent warr \n    specific armor &amp; weapons we tank very well at most levels.<br>4) The \n    idea that warriors don&#39;t contribute significant offensive damage is an old \n    idea.&nbsp; With the uber hps high level MOBs the damage we contribute over \n    time is quite significant.<br>5) Raising the defensive caps for the other \n    classes actually makes them stronger in the groups I play in.&nbsp; That \n    means my groups survive more. I kind of like that.<br>6) The mid 30s-40s is \n    a tough spot for warriors.&nbsp; Mostly because the other tank classes \n    (Rangers/SKs in particular) have similar agro capability to ourselves at \n    this point but little experience in the value of their role in a \n    group.&nbsp; By the mid 40s very few Rangers, SKs &amp; Pallies are actively \n    trying wrest agro away from a warrior...at least if they have any \n    brains.<br><br>regards<br><br>Flair Shieldrender<br>54 Champion Fennin \n    Ro<br><br>James Wofford wrote:<br>\n    <blockquote type=\"cite\"\n><pre>sigh..
