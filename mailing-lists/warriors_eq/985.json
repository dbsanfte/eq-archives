If the area is camped the spawn will be delayed, so a creature will spawn...just not as often.  If the special item the NPC carries is present in the zone then the NPC will not spawn with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been trying to get a shiny brass shield for the last 2 weeks or so.  The trainer never seems to have...I have heard this as well from people who are camping the spot to twink guild mates.  Oddly enough there is almost always a shiny shield within striking distance of the trainers spawn point.  I have heard others on this list mention that they could not get a BBC no matter how long they waited....I am wondering if they had another BBC in the group they were camping with?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis code is a good start for reducing camping.  Because it was done quietly there is not a big &quot;Hoopla&quot; of campers complaining, they are simply not seeing anything spawn.  This could also explain the rumors that the Tommy no longer spawns.  because almost always the campers there have 3+ tommys in the group.  It is going to be a long time before word gets around though so you aren&#39;t going to see some of the popularly camped items for awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who can offer information confirming or denying this rumor won&#39;t be rewarded.  But I am sure they will earn the admiration and gratitude of the rest of the people on this list.....well maybe just the gratitude at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nBael<br/>\nWarrior of the 16th Order<br/>\nIndigo Brotherhood</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
