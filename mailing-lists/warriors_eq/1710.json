This impacted ALL classes &amp; not just warriors. To \n        be honest in 5 hours of Howling Stones last night Ididn&#39;t notice the \n        difference (i.e. with my Bloodpoint &amp; werewolf form I still saw \n        plenty of agro).<br>3) Warriors were only &quot;useless&quot; the first 6 months \n        of the games existence...I know I experienced it first hand (same armor, \n        weapons &amp; hps as everyone else with zero distinguishing skills) \n        .&nbsp; These days with decent warr specific armor &amp; weapons we tank \n        very well at most levels.<br>4) The idea that warriors don&#39;t contribute \n        significant offensive damage is an old idea.&nbsp; With the uber hps \n        high level MOBs the damage we contribute over time is quite \n        significant.<br>5) Raising the defensive caps for the other classes \n        actually makes them stronger in the groups I play in.&nbsp; That means \n        my groups survive more. I kind of like that.<br>6) The mid 30s-40s is a \n        tough spot for warriors.&nbsp; Mostly because the other tank classes \n        (Rangers/SKs in particular) have similar agro capability to ourselves at \n        this point but little experience in the value of their role in a \n        group.&nbsp; By the mid 40s very few Rangers, SKs &amp; Pallies are \n        actively trying wrest agro away from a warrior...at least if they have \n        any brains.<br><br>regards<br><br>Flair Shieldrender<br>54 Champion \n        Fennin Ro<br><br>James Wofford wrote:<br>\n        <blockquote\n\n type=\"cite\"><pre>sigh..
