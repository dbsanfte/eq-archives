Not only is it<br/>\na wholly UNINTERESTING place the stench of leaf-eating tree-hugging wood<br/>\nelves was beyond even my formidable senses to withstand.<br/>\n<br/>\nJaade,<br/>\nIndigo Sista Soldier.<br/>\n<br/>\nooc<br/>\nOK assuming you can board the boat in Freeport this is how you do it.  At<br/>\nthe first place the ship stops STAY away from the docks.  The woman wood elf<br/>\nguard will board the ship to KOS.  The only thing that saved me first time<br/>\naround was the ship moved.  So stay to the left of the ship or on top of the<br/>\nhigh deck.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dwarven guards conned dubious to me, so I was able to get off at the<br/>\ndocks.  ALL other Dwarves conned threateningly and ALL elves were ready to<br/>\nattack.  I can not really describe how to get to faydark since I do it all<br/>\nby sight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you enter faydark if you stick to the zone wall and go left you will<br/>\nhit Crushbone if you stick right you will hit the other faydark entrance.<br/>\nDark elves are safe in Crushbone.  The gnomes were also neutral to me so I<br/>\ncould visit their city as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are on the MM server I can actually take you there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mallachyte@...\">Mallachyte@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mallachyte@...\">Mallachyte@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tWednesday, May 19, 1999 5:46 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[warriors_eq] Question about ports<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mallachyte@...\">Mallachyte@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a Dark Elf Shadow Knight in Neriak and am interested in traveling<br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; Feydwer.
