I got my AC to 384 without<br/>\nbuffs using a mix of bronze plate and banded, and agility bonus.  On average<br/>\nhits I took were less than 10 points, about 1 in 5 hits would be up near the<br/>\nmax of what the creature could do.  50 for darkbones, 40 for ghouls and so<br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then switch to my magical armor which includes alot of leather items and<br/>\nringmail that give stat bonuses.  I then got myself buffed by a druid and<br/>\nmanaged an AC of 383.  There was no significant difference in the amount of<br/>\ndamage I took.  An average hit does minimal damage....and 1 out of 5 hits<br/>\ndoes heavy damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I was in plate and banded and one I was in Leather and Ringmail.  With<br/>\nthe same AC there is no appriecable difference in damage absorbtion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis won&#39;t finish this arguement but at least it adds some fact to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBael<br/>\nTier&#39;dal Armor Researcher<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Jones, Brian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, July 21, 1999 8:41 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [warriors_eq] Armor & Absorption is all AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Point being 4 people said that armor type does make a difference in damage<br/>\n&gt;received, one person said it doesn&#39;t and that he has direct confirmation<br/>\n&gt;from Verant that it doesn&#39;t.  I don&#39;t know about you but very rarely will<br/>\n&gt;Verant give out this kind of information, if at all.  And someone saying<br/>\n&gt;&#39;because Verant said so&#39; without saying where he heard that is like someone<br/>\n&gt;telling you &#39;My friend is a GM and he is going to ban you&#39;.   No, most of<br/>\n&gt;the time if a player tells what he has found in his experience within the<br/>\n&gt;game I will tend to listen to them more.  Its when they start saying &#39;I<br/>\n&gt;heard from Verant&#39; or &#39;Brad is my brother and he said&#39; is when I usually<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t even listen to their argument at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Savej@...\">Savej@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Savej@...\">Savej@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Reply To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 20, 1999 5:44 PM<br/>\n&gt;&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [warriors_eq] Armor & Absorption is all AC.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Savej@...\">Savej@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &lt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;I have direct confirmation from Verant that armor type is the Damage<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Absorption constant.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; Point:  Anyone can state this.  Now give us facts.  What everyone has<br/>\n&gt;&gt; said<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  for this thread is only conjecture.  And the one thing I have found<br/>\n&gt;&gt; constant<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  in EQ is that conjecture = assume (and you know the saying about<br/>\n </span></blockquote>assume).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; If you can&#39;t accept what a poster is calling a fact based on your<br/>\n&gt;&gt; assessment<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of the poster than you&#39;re wasting everyone&#39;s time by filling a post<br/>\n </span></blockquote>asking<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; him for more.  Also note that the &quot;because Verant said so&quot; point wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt; his<br/>\n&gt;&gt; only argument.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; As far as the invisible, theoretical damage modifiers go, I&#39;m curious as<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; why so few people are defending their existance so vehemently.  I&#39;m also<br/>\n&gt;&gt; curious as to what &quot;facts&quot; could possibly be brought to bear to prove or<br/>\n&gt;&gt; disprove its existance other than the conjecture of very<br/>\n&gt;&gt; experienced/methodical/intelligent players and the gospel of Verant.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.
