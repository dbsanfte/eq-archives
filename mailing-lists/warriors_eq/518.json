If you have a strong group it is<br/>\n&gt; possible...but beware of other parties of solo players.  Once you cross<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; bridge you are in a &quot;hub&quot; room.  Fleeing creatures will run into a room<br/>\n&gt; populated with Tuk warriors and Gaz warriors.  If you do not follow them<br/>\n&gt; they will come back and sometimes bring these warriors out.  I&#39;ve died in<br/>\n&gt; Upper Guk a few times due to the follies of others in the dungeon.  If a<br/>\n&gt; PC<br/>\n&gt; or froglock blocks the bridge there is no escape from the trains. You will<br/>\n&gt; die deeper inside than you would prefer.  The upside is that most<br/>\n&gt; froglocks<br/>\n&gt; do not KOS until you killed a couple dozen and your faction with them is<br/>\n&gt; bad.  So you can often walk right down and pick up your stuff.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The most dangerous part is the water under the bridge.  Some of the trains<br/>\n&gt; will occassionally drop Ton warriors and Gaz warriors into the water.  I<br/>\n&gt; almost always see one or more there.  If you fall off the bridge into the<br/>\n&gt; water you will very likely die unless you are a good swimmer.  I&#39;d advise<br/>\n&gt; using a mage to draw anything out of the water and kill it before you<br/>\n&gt; start<br/>\n&gt; hunting across the bridge.  And remember don&#39;t panic!  Falling in the<br/>\n&gt; water<br/>\n&gt; is only a death sentence if you panic.  If you can&#39;t solo whatever is in<br/>\n&gt; there just swim out and get to dry ground before you die.  It is much<br/>\n&gt; easier<br/>\n&gt; to get to your corpse<br/>\n&gt;  if it isn&#39;t in the water.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, if you see anything fleeing from the entrance over the bridge while<br/>\n&gt; you are hunting on the otherside...kill it.  Doesn&#39;t matter if it is yours<br/>\n&gt; or not, if you don&#39;t take the kill it may bring back a train.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmm....looking back that all kind of rambles.  It will make more sense<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; you actually get to Guk and look around.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bael<br/>\n&gt; 15th Order of the Indigo Brotherhood<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warriors_eq@onelist.com\">warriors_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thursday, May 20, 1999 1:04 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [warriors_eq] Guk Question<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sean.Clark@...\">Sean.Clark@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;John can you help me out with this question?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am about to hit lvl 13 and was thinkin about trying for the chitin<br/>\n&gt; shield.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I I get together a strong group do we have a shot?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To get to the Spider(s) do you go into the water from the room with the<br/>\n&gt; two<br/>\n&gt; &gt;frogs that spawn that is close to the entrance?
