I have maxed both dual wield and double attack at 80 each.  I seem to be having trouble effectively hunting.  Anything that cons white to me is always a tough fight that can go either way, so I usually end up sticking to blue critters.  However some blue critters are just to tough to solo.  Lava basilisks are a no-no because of Stone Breath, fire elementals have some kind of damage shield which causes me damage each time I hit so they are a no-no also.   Lavastorm being my preferred hunting area right now.  I tried crocs in Oasis, but it is to crowded when I play (8pm-10pm) for me to even find anything to kill.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I am at that awkward level and was looking for advice from other warriors on how they got fro 15 to 16.<br/>\n<br/>\nBael<br/>\nWarrior of the 15th Order<br/>\nIndigo Brotherhood of the Tier&#39;dal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
