The penalty that AD&D used was the experience<br/>\ntable, and rangers got skills a little later then Fighters.  Otherwise they<br/>\nwere nearly identical in offensive power.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn defensive power the fighter was superior.  He could wear plate and had<br/>\nmore hp.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUsing AD&D as a reference if you buffed up the offensive power of a warrior<br/>\nthen you should for hybrids as well.   The defensive power should be<br/>\naddressed thou.  I dislike the magic plate mail loop hole, robbing warriors<br/>\nof some of their defensive power.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you compare the warrior to the ranger in AD&D the differences are<br/>\nnearly wholly defensive power.  Fighters got one extra specialization slot<br/>\n(which meant an extra attack) at later levels which in EQ terms equals the<br/>\nhigher attack/defense ratings as well as they get the skills a lot earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only reason I mention it is that people are bringing in their own views<br/>\nof what the warrior should be like and using literature or other RPG&#39;s to<br/>\nback them up (the vorpal wielding warrior comes to mind).  I think if you<br/>\ntake a closer look at well researched and established games the warriors<br/>\nadvantage over the sub classes has been defensive more then offensive</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
