I&#39;d say around 15-20.  We made a bucnh of new iksars<br/>\nso we played togehter with them a lot in the early days of their<br/>\nadventures.  I&#39;m sure we could help you lvl up if you need it.  I would<br/>\nrecommend that you play any charchter that suites you, dont worry about<br/>\nour needs....but it&#39;s be nice to have another cleric , heh, or a druid<br/>\nheh.  But dont let me pressure you :P  They fixed alchemy for Shamans FYI,<br/>\nbut appply poison is not done yet, very soon they say, so feel free to<br/>\namke a rouge (i hear there is an absolutely fantastic weapon in Kunark<br/>\nthat is probobly going to need to be adjusted as it is doing ungodly<br/>\namounts of dmg with backstab!) :)  Verant has stated that they are pretty<br/>\nmuich done with balancing all the classes, so they said that you wont see<br/>\nmany changes in the future with any of the classes.  they are concetrating<br/>\non adding new content rathher than adjusting classes since they feel they<br/>\nare essentially done.   heh, whatveer charchter you make, i cant wait to<br/>\nsee you!<br/>\n<br/>\n-joe Fentus<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 9 Jun 2000, David Lari wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After a long hiatus, I have decided to return to the world or Norrath.
