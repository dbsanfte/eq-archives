Anyway I <br/>\n&gt;mostly play my High Elf Cleric now. But I also have a Wood Elf Warrior, but <br/>\n&gt;warriors get boring once you get to a certain point, nothing to work toward <br/>\n&gt;if ya know what I mean. And my partner play a High Elf cleric but his <br/>\n&gt;computer is broken for the time being &lt;sniffle&gt;. I would love to have you <br/>\n&gt;come over to Ralos server. Oh and Ive been playing since the release hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
