Im excited to be a new member of this emailing community!! :)<br/>\n&gt;  Hmm, for those who are interested in newcomers, I might as well introduce<br/>\n&gt; myself a bit.  hehe :D<br/>\n&gt;   Lets see.. I have played EQ for a bout a year now, beginning on Nameless<br/>\n&gt; then switching to Rodcet around April of this year :)    At the moment my<br/>\ntwo<br/>\n&gt; main characters on Rodcet are Ivymayden D&#39;Zephyr ~ 34 Woodelf Warrior and<br/>\n&gt; Melalle ~ 15 Dark Elf Romancer.  (but im a good witch!) among a few other<br/>\n&gt; chars I got bored with hehe.  I recently discovered Mystic Alliance and<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; overjoyed! I had no idea there was such a guild on EQ!!  These past few<br/>\nweeks<br/>\n&gt; have been some of the best since I joined :D   Ok, ill draw the line on<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; intro here!  Im looking forward to meeting the Rainbow crew!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *Hugz*<br/>\n&gt;  ~Lori~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
