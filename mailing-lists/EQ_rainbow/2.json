I&#39;m happy to see that 16 people have joined us in just 24 hours.  It&#39;s hard to tell with something like this how quickly and how many people will join.  I&#39;m going to use this message to say briefly why I created this list, and to tell you a bit about who I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the first things I noticed in Everquest was that it prohibited anti-gay guilds and harassment.  At the time I just thought &quot;cool&quot; and brushed it off, but it kind of sunk in after a while.  It made me feel comfortable as a bisexual woman, knowing that (officially at least) homophobia was prohibited.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, in playing the game I noticed also that there was no queer visibility.  I have seen a lot of heterosexual visibility, in particular I&#39;ve seen a lot of het online marriages.  I&#39;ve thought sometimes about defining one of my characters as a lesbian, but it&#39;s seemed like a daunting task.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy forming EQ rainbow I&#39;ve hoped to meet other les/bi/gay/tg everquest players, outside of the game, in a relaxed chat environment.  I&#39;m hoping this will help me realize, and all of you realize, that we are out there, playing that game, on every server!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to give some biographical information on myself, I&#39;m a 26 year old bisexual woman from Toronto Canada.  I work a computer programmer.  I do volunteer work here in our amazing queer community, and I love it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this list will be a positive space for all lesbian/gay/bi/tg identified Everquest players.  I also want this list to welcome straight-identified and queer-positive Everquest players.<br/>\n<br/>\n*hugs*<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet free personalized email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.iname.com\">http://www.iname.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
