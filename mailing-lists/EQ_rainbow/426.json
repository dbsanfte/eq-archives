They were nonresponsive..probably AFK. They ran off and I<br/>\ncontinued to try and say Hi to them and they ignored me.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Talked to a Tigerhawk Wensday morning. VERY nice person. I asked him<br/>\nabout the guild and he told me he knew it was a<br/>\nGay/Bi/Lesbian/Transgendered etc. guild and loved the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Wensday afternoon I spoke with the Guild leader (Tarismo), and it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nDavid, and he was very upset that &#39;we&#39; were trying to take HIS guild away<br/>\nfrom him. He told me it was DEFINATELY NOT based on what we had intended as<br/>\na guild, even though Tigerhawk said differently. He said that HE was first<br/>\nand he would NOT allow ANYONE to take the guild away from him. I told him<br/>\nthat there must be a mix up and he should contact Verant to clear it up. He<br/>\nexploded on me about that. I told him he should talk to a GM and not yell<br/>\nat me because I had no power. After this he refused to reply to any tells.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) I petitioned a junior GM and told them about the guild mixup etc. and he<br/>\npromised to esculate it to the powers that be. I thanked him and went about<br/>\nmy gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) At 11:45 pm I was getting ready to log after a lot of fun at Lake Rather<br/>\nwhen I got a tell from one of their members accusing me of starting rumors.<br/>\nHe was VERY mean and would not listen to reason. I explained what had<br/>\nhappened and why the confusion but he then became more abusive. After a<br/>\nminute or so, several other of their guild started sending really mean..and<br/>\nI DO mean EVIL tells to me about this. I told them to let Verant/GMs take<br/>\nit from here but they verbally assaulted over and over. I eventually calmed<br/>\nthem down and logged for the night.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Man...this is crazy. I don&#39;t KNOW what&#39;s happened but I think David is<br/>\nright that we may have to delete the guild and start over again. Though<br/>\nwith people like I met last night, I think it will be rather rough trying<br/>\nto parley with them about this mix up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
