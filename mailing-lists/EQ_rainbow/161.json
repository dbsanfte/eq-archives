Our efforts at a<br/>\nreplacement name were humorous if not productive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had an idea for using a latin name for the guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nGloriae et Liberatatae<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;Gloriae&#39; means fame, renown, glory; glorius deeds.<br/>\n&#39;et&#39; means and<br/>\nLiberatatae means freedoms, liberty, independence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe initials would be GL (same as the initials for gay and lesbian. Also,<br/>\nthe B and the T in liberatatae could represent bisexual and transgender. I<br/>\njust like the idea of having a hidden meaning, but one that we recognize and<br/>\nremember as we think about the diversity of our own group. Kind of like the<br/>\nmeaning of each color of the rainbow flag.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guild&#39;s name would also represent our own desires for personal and guild<br/>\nglory. And the desire we have to be free and to make sure others are free<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther names based in latin:<br/>\nPedes Genialis<br/>\n<br/>\npedes - foot soldier<br/>\ngenialis - relating to enjoyment; joyful, gay.<br/>\n<br/>\nPedes Liberti (soldiers of freedom)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know these sound militaristic, but after all, we do carry weapons and kill<br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nSocietas De Sapho - Association Of Sapho<br/>\nSocietas De Genialis - Association of Enjoyment (joyful, gay)<br/>\nSocietas De Liberti - Association of Freedom<br/>\n<br/>\nI kind of like the idea of using something Latin, but at the same time I<br/>\nwant something that sounds good. Don&#39;t know if any of the above fit that.<br/>\nWhat do you all think?????</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
