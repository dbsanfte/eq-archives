Do you see why I<br/>\nsuggested it? I originally laughed out loud at my thought of calling the guild<br/>\nMystic Gaydar, but then Mystic Alliance seemed pretty good. Not that every<br/>\nGLBT man and woman feel called to associate with each other, but obviously a<br/>\nbunch of us here do... that&#39;s mystical, spiritual, mysterious, magical... and<br/>\neverything wrapped up together. No religious affiliation is  taken from the<br/>\nname either. Although angels and archangels, etc. sound nice, most people did<br/>\nnot want to inject Judeo-Christian ideas into Norrathian culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s almost certain that no one name will be the ultimate to everyone<br/>\ninvolved. Arriving at a consensus fairly soon would be great as I am excited<br/>\nand wanting to let everyone I know about it. Having the name to relay with the<br/>\nrest of the information is important to start building a guild identity and<br/>\npresence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your ideas-<br/>\n<br/>\nChristine<br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph Normandin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:josephn@...\">josephn@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nFrom: Joseph Normandin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:josephn@...\">josephn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI just cant shut up<br/>\n<br/>\nthe name is cool but what would be &quot;mystic&quot;?

As far as names for the women in the history, there&#39;s a couple I<br/>\n&gt; have in mind, but need to look up tonight before posting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In reading your message, Christina, another name came to mind &lt;as she<br/>\n&gt; cautiously tosses it into the fray&gt;: Mystic Alliance<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the GLBT-related names have pretty much been dropped in discussion<br/>\nby<br/>\n&gt; most people. This name is role-play appropriate, it is somewhat mysterious<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; the alliance part is what we are about. There is nothing good/evil impliant<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; the name, nor any specific class or race.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Although the GLBT link may not be apparent in any name chosen, it is easy<br/>\n&gt; enough to add symbolism to any graphics/logo associated with a guild site.<br/>\n&gt; Granted, it wouldn&#39;t be visually attached to our names in the game, but if<br/>\n&gt; people want to know, they&#39;ll ask or look for a website for information.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as publicity for the guild once things are a bit settled, PlanetOut<br/>\n&gt; might be a great online zine to contact. Their turnaround time for getting<br/>\n&gt; information out is much quicker than the print media. I think they may also<br/>\n&gt; have links to GLBT websites, which would be great when we have one for the<br/>\n&gt; guild. I can&#39;t recall if there is a gay-related news service bureau. Some<br/>\n&gt; individuals were trying to create one a while ago. The BBC is very queer<br/>\n&gt; friendly and could be interested in a story, especially if we wish to reach<br/>\n&gt; our brothers and sisters in the EU. Wired may also be a good place to reach<br/>\n&gt; GLBT gamers and they have their email newsletters as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I enjoyed chatting with you all in the guild formation last night.

I don&#39;t see the need for us to be outcasts <br/>\n&gt; though. I personally prefer to assume that Norathian culture is generally <br/>\n&gt; accepting of diverse sexual orientation, and that players who express <br/>\n&gt; otherwise are members of some strange minority. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One thing I would like to see in terms of roleplay is that GLBT and <br/>\n&gt; positive people share a kind of bond that is manifests itself as a <br/>\n&gt; tangible spiritual connection. Something along the lines of us all coming <br/>\n&gt; together because we had this connection, and could sense it in eachother. <br/>\n&gt; Kind of a mystic gaydar 8) I like it because this implies a reason for us <br/>\n&gt; to exist in an organization beyond combating homophobia (which implies <br/>\n&gt; homophobia is a force requiring an organization to combat). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    - Christina <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    On Thu, 29 Jul 1999, David Lari wrote: <br/>\n&gt;    &gt; From: David Lari &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kerik@...\">kerik@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    &gt; My ideas for our charter and lower down the &#39;back story&#39; thing I<br/>\npromised<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    &gt; yesterday. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
