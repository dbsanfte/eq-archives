I heard<br/>\npeople say it wasnt true.. but we decided to go to Najena for the J Boots. I<br/>\nbeing 17 and my party being on 22-25 I was the outcast, but they are my<br/>\nregular companions, so I knew Id be ok. _I am not one to level efficently so<br/>\nthats why im such a weenie compared to them.. Anyhow.. we get to the place<br/>\nwhere the J boots spawn and there is a group there.. Said they&#39;ve been there<br/>\nfor 6 hours. So We wait, and 2 spawns no boots, next 2 spawns were not even<br/>\nthe named NPC for them,  A necro spawned instead. So After like a hour, I<br/>\ngot bored and we left..Decided to get tantacle whip. I have the key so we<br/>\nare going back early today.. but I am thinking for what if its going to take<br/>\nus 3 hours just to get one Journeyman boots ? uugh.. have any of you seen<br/>\nthis in specific areas besides here ? Cause I want to Kill Najena to get the<br/>\nFBR, but don&#39;t want (nor have the time) to wait for 6 hours before I get<br/>\nmine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else have this issue ?<br/>\n<br/>\nReuben</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
