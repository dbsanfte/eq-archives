I&#39;ve only my own level 19 or lower<br/>\n&gt; buffs for STR, etc. I&#39;ve got 88 WIS and 85 INT.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually what I notice is that sometimes when I meditate the mana goes up<br/>\n&gt; very slow (I can go clean the house !) - - if I click the meditate button<br/>\n&gt; off and then on again it will sometimes go up in larger increments. At<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; point I think this may be a bug and I will report it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s really great seeing so much family on EQ !!

It brought out some interesting<br/>\n&gt; side effects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Many mages said they &quot;saw&quot; a difference, but EQ staff on the Bard<br/>\n&gt; list eventually said it had no effect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So the Bards fiddled with it a bit (pun intended).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It seems that many stamina buffs will cause the &quot;ticker&quot; to update<br/>\n&gt; faster. BUT before you get excited, the total time it takes to<br/>\n&gt; go from 1 bubble to full (in mana) does not vary, just the rate at<br/>\n&gt; which the changes are displayed.  The Bards found several mages<br/>\n&gt; and asked them to time the total refill time as well as time the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;ticker&quot; or visual update timer.  They then tested with and w/o song.<br/>\n&gt; The data fit both what the mages saw and the EQ staff info.  The<br/>\n&gt; &quot;ticker&quot; times could vary, fooling you into thinking it was filling<br/>\nfaster,<br/>\n&gt; but the refill total time was pretty constant.  If a true mana regen spell<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; song was put in effect *then* the total refill time was indeed reduced.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, were you under any stamina buffs?  They can give an illusion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Lora<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
