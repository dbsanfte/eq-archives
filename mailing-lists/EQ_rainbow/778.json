I found<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your listing through one of the other EQ message boards.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have been seriously thinking of relocating servers to join many <br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you on the Rodcet Nife server.  Currently i have several low level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; characters on the Mithaniel Marr server, so if any of you are on <br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; server please give me an in-game tell or email me <br/>\n(jdincinci@a...).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A little about me:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; * James Dillon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; * 28<br/>\n&gt; &gt; * I live in Cincinnati, OH and work for an advertising agency as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their Information Systems person, i.e. Nick Burns (for all of you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Saturday Night Live fans).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Primary Character (right now):  Renette 10 Wood Elf Druid<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have several other characters, but Renette is the one i&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; playing most lately.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Most Hated EQ Monster:  The Kerran High Guard.  My first character<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was an Erudite Magician and i was one of the rare people that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; actually hunted in Tox Forest and Kerra Isle.  That Kerran High <br/>\nGuard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; must have killed me 50 times before i decided to take my first <br/>\nboat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ride to Qeynos.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Favorite EQ Monster:  Spectre (Only because they are neat looking)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well i will stop there.  I will probably create a character on <br/>\nRodcet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nife now just so i can have a fun group to chat with.  Do you have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; any low level characters in your guild (Mystic Alliance)?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, I am glad to have found this group and other gay people <br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like playing EQ...I knew you were out there!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; James<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
