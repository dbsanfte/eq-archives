It was called MegaPlat and<br/>\nconsisted of a lottery (the grand prize was 665 plat) and raffles of various<br/>\nitems (armor, jewelry, weapons, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had around 20 guild members on at the same time and that set a record for<br/>\nus, I believe. A lot of people have been moving over to the Rodcet server<br/>\nand this event was a great way for them to get some nice equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoe and Rob did a great job of coordinating and running the event. Thanks<br/>\nguys.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone else wants to create characters on Rodcet, we invite you to come<br/>\njoin us. We&#39;ll be happy to help you out as you start new characters. We&#39;re<br/>\nquickly making Rodcet the San Francisco of Norrath and you are welcome to<br/>\njoin the fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\nKerik, Wood Elf Druid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
