Soon, members of the Mystic Alliance will be wandering the world of Norrath. Unfortunately, it will take me awhile to get the<br/>\n&gt; various chapters established on the servers that we need. I will be out of town Aug. 7 -14 (argh! a whole week without EQ) but on Sunday the 15th, I hope to get<br/>\n&gt; the chapters set up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will be the guildmaster on Brell Serillis, but I will need others to do the same on the other servers. I know several of you have mentioned you&#39;d be willing to<br/>\n&gt; do it, so please tell me again if you want to do it, and let me know which server.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will attempt to get as many set up on Sunday the 15th, as I can.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; David<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dedric, lvl 9 gnome, Necro on Brell<br/>\n&gt; Kerik, lvl 3 High Elf, Enchanter on Brell<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best place to EXPLORE topics, SHARE ideas, and<br/>\n&gt; CONNECT to people with the same interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
