But the best<br/>\n&gt; thing to do is find out what time(s) people play (and of course what time<br/>\n&gt; zone) and team up with someone whose schedule will fairly closely match<br/>\n&gt; yours. When I was actively playing, I found that only a few of use played at<br/>\n&gt; the same times.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you decide to start a character on Brell, or if you want my account, let<br/>\n&gt; me know. I will be canceling my account soon and I want to give my stuff to<br/>\n&gt; a guild member, or if anyone wants a level 21 gnomish necro, I&#39;ll be glad to<br/>\n&gt; let someone have my account.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, still looking for someone to take over as guild leader on Brell. I<br/>\n&gt; have someone who is willing to become the overall owner of the guild and am<br/>\n&gt; going to find out how to transfer it to him, but still need the leader on<br/>\n&gt; Brell.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; David<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: J Dye &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gaelad@...\">gaelad@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_rainbow@onelist.com\">EQ_rainbow@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, December 06, 1999 10:23 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_rainbow] EQ Xegony<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: J Dye &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gaelad@...\">gaelad@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well.. it&#39;s December 6th and the list has been pretty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quiet.  =)  Here&#39;s what&#39;s up with me...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I sold my account (Gaelad on Xegony) since I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think I was going to be able to play after my hand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; surgery (and after losing interest in the game), but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my hand is better so I am starting over.
