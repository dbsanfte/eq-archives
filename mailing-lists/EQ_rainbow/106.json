My current<br/>\n&gt; character is Garret, level 7 Rogue on Brell. Been having lots of fun<br/>\n&gt; with him so far, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be even better when the Rogue<br/>\n&gt; changes go live:)<br/>\n&gt; Also I&#39;m working on getting better in Talioring, I&#39;ve been wanting to<br/>\n&gt; check out the better forms of Leather Armour, maybe we could<br/>\n&gt; collaborate Christina since you have made Master (very<br/>\n&gt; impressive:). I dont think Rogues can wear banded, I dont<br/>\n&gt; remember:)<br/>\n&gt; Anyway I look forward to seeing you all on wednesday at the birth<br/>\n&gt; of our Guild, Unity sounds like a fine name BTW.<br/>\n&gt; Take care all and look me up sometime...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best wishes,<br/>\n&gt; Lonewolf<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How do you enter ONElist´┐¢s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\n&gt; By joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
