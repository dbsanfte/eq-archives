I THINK mine has an AMD whatever chip -- <br/>\n550 thingies if I remember correctly. I know the 3D whats-it is one <br/>\nthat&#39;s either not actually listed for EQ, or is buried deep in the <br/>\ncompatability list on the main site -- not one listed right on the <br/>\nKunark box, at any rate. Same for the sound card. I also have 64 RAM, <br/>\n& a 56k modem. I have no norrathly idea how far I am from my isp, or <br/>\neven how to find that out. Oh, the comp itself is a Compaq Presario <br/>\nsomething-or-other.<br/>\n<br/>\n  SOOooo... what piece of this should I look to upgrade 1st in order <br/>\nto get better run of EQ? I think most of you know I am the slowest <br/>\nzoner in the guild, & lately I&#39;ve been having worse problems with lag <br/>\n& ld than usual (which may be isp-load related & not something I can <br/>\nupgrade, but I don&#39;t know). This is death for a bard, & making it <br/>\nreally tough to twist songs. I just bought the comp 2 months ago, but <br/>\ncould upgrade some piece, I think. Can&#39;t switch isp, since I got a <br/>\ndiscount for signing up with them for 3 years.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for any helpful advice!<br/>\n<br/>\nTodd (aka Snapdragyn & Gaistyd)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
