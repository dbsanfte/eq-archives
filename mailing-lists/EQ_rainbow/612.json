It brought out some interesting<br/>\nside effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany mages said they &quot;saw&quot; a difference, but EQ staff on the Bard<br/>\nlist eventually said it had no effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the Bards fiddled with it a bit (pun intended).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that many stamina buffs will cause the &quot;ticker&quot; to update<br/>\nfaster. BUT before you get excited, the total time it takes to<br/>\ngo from 1 bubble to full (in mana) does not vary, just the rate at<br/>\nwhich the changes are displayed.  The Bards found several mages<br/>\nand asked them to time the total refill time as well as time the<br/>\n&quot;ticker&quot; or visual update timer.  They then tested with and w/o song.<br/>\nThe data fit both what the mages saw and the EQ staff info.  The<br/>\n&quot;ticker&quot; times could vary, fooling you into thinking it was filling faster,<br/>\nbut the refill total time was pretty constant.  If a true mana regen spell<br/>\nor<br/>\nsong was put in effect *then* the total refill time was indeed reduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, were you under any stamina buffs?  They can give an illusion.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lora<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
