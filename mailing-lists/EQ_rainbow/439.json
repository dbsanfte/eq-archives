Since as I understand he was running his guild<br/>\nas an LGBT guild, it looks like the probable result of all this will be<br/>\nconflict between LGBT players on E&#39;ci.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoking paranoid thought, could a homophobic guide have orchestrated this<br/>\nall to bring about queer conflict on E&#39;ci? Will this be spread to other<br/>\nservers! =O<br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like over the next couple days Mystical Alliance will be deleted<br/>\non E&#39;ci and recreated under Deric (who may want to transfer ownership of<br/>\nthe guild to a regular E&#39;ci list member to avoid the beurocacy of having<br/>\nto log in regularly).  After a settling down period, maybe someone who<br/>\nhasn&#39;t been involved in all this, might try approaching Tarisimo and<br/>\nseeing if any kind of peace is possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m ultimately a little curious about the unanswered questions here.  How<br/>\ndid Tarisimo decide on the name Mystical Alliance for his queer guild.  It<br/>\nis a queer guild isn&#39;t it? Did he read our charter on the site and decide<br/>\nto stat it on E&#39;ci? Is there a *true* mystical alliance between queer EQ<br/>\nplayers that would result in us coming up with the same name? 8)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
