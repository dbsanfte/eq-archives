I like it because it&#39;s incredibly arrogant, with<br/>\n&gt; the implication being that being GLBT or queer-positive makes you better<br/>\n&gt; than if you&#39;re not.  Well lets face it...doesn&#39;t it???? =) I&#39;m suggesting<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The Chosen&quot; because &quot;We Rock&quot; doesn&#39;t sound that medieval, but lets face<br/>\n&gt; it...we rock!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How about &quot;Norath United&quot;? I think it presents a pretty clear strong<br/>\n&gt; concept.  On the downside it sounds a bit boring.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How about &quot;We Are Everywhere&quot;.  I like it because it sends the positive<br/>\n&gt; message that GLBT people are everywhere.  It also has mysterious overtones<br/>\n&gt; that I think make it cool in a standalone way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Christina<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
