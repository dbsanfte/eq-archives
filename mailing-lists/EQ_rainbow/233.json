We all seem to put a little here and there about<br/>\n&gt; what we play, what server we&#39;re on, etc. and we all want to get together<br/>\n&gt; with someone else on the same server. Well, if you send me the following<br/>\n&gt; info I will make a LIST of us ALL and post it to our list. Include the<br/>\n&gt; FOLLOWING Info please...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Normal Entry Info:<br/>\n&gt; Character/s Name<br/>\n&gt; Level/s<br/>\n&gt; Character/s Gender<br/>\n&gt; Class/s<br/>\n&gt; Race/s<br/>\n&gt; Server/s you are on<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Optional:<br/>\n&gt; Real Name<br/>\n&gt; Email Address<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      With this info I think we can better coordinate our efforts to meet up<br/>\n&gt; with everyone. If you want you can either post it on EQ Rainbow or you can<br/>\n&gt; email me at home at :  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sandymann@...\">sandymann@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps unravel the confusion of who&#39;s where and on what server!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandy ( Kalell)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations DALMATIANRESCUE.
