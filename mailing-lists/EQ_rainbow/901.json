At first I thought it was just a<br/>\njoke<br/>\n&gt; e-mail. But I checked it out, and lo and behold... there are literally<br/>\n&gt; THOUSANDS of items for sale... and being bought. It&#39;s a funny thing<br/>\nbecause<br/>\n&gt; I have also learned that the recent killings at schools have ALL turned up<br/>\n&gt; Nazi memorabilia... such as Colombine, the two murdered professors, and<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; recent ones in Maryland.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Check it out for yourself:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://listings.ebay.com/aw/listings/list/category4078/index.html\">http://listings.ebay.com/aw/listings/list/category4078/index.html</a> Just<br/>\n&gt; search for the word nazi and you&#39;ll find it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As a TransFan, I AM DISGUSTED and I AM APALLED! And as a human being, I<br/>\nfeel<br/>\n&gt; it is just plain wrong to use this service to buy TOYS without knowing<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; was going on. I urge you all, if you feel strongly about this to voice<br/>\nyour<br/>\n&gt; opinion to e-bay. They have a moral responsibility not to promote hate as<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; well respected company.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can e-mail e-bay&#39;s CEO here:<br/>\n&gt; Meg Whitman<br/>\n&gt; Email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:meg@...\">meg@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And the VP of Communications here:<br/>\n&gt; Kevin Perclad<br/>\n&gt; VP of Communications<br/>\n&gt; Phone: 408-558-7458<br/>\n&gt; Email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kevinp@...\">kevinp@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What else can be said? That&#39;s up to you!<br/>\n&gt; Thank you,<br/>\n&gt; Daniel Ross<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S.  Below is the original letter that I received which alerted me to<br/>\nthis.<br/>\n&gt;   I urge you all to read this as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dear Friends<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I got this from a close friend of mine:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I recently went on eBay and discovered that they have over 75 pages of<br/>\nNazi<br/>\n&gt; memorabilia for sale!!! Each page contains approximately 40 separate<br/>\n&gt; auctions. That&#39;s over 3700 auctions of Nazi items right now!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Upon looking at these in disgust, I even noticed some people proudly<br/>\n&gt; declaring that their Nazi items are banned in Germany and France, but<br/>\n&gt; available here on EBAY!!!! Items include: Nazi flags, Pictures of<br/>\n&gt; Stormtroopers and countless other despicable items. I decided that we<br/>\n&gt; should not let eBay profit from the blood of 6 million  Jews!!!! I<br/>\n&gt; contacted eBay and after getting the runaround, spoke to the  Director of<br/>\n&gt; Communications for about 1 hour. I told him that I understand that<br/>\n&gt; legally eBay has the right to sell Nazi memorabilia but morally they ought<br/>\n&gt; to be ashamed of themselves that they are profited from the death of 6<br/>\n&gt; million Jews!! I also reminded him that many people who collect Nazi<br/>\nitems,<br/>\n&gt; idealize Hitler and what he has done and have been involved in violent<br/>\n&gt; crimes in our society.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I explained to him that the 2 students that murdered fellow classmates<br/>\n&gt; at Columbine had Nazi items in their homes. More recently the 2 teens that<br/>\n&gt; murdered the two Dartmouth professors, were found to have Nazi items.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; His response was that of a typical spin doctor. He said that these<br/>\n&gt; items are sold elsewhere and at shows. I told him that is a very poor<br/>\n&gt; justification for eBay to promote items of violence and hate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To net this out....I need your help in putting tremendous pressure on<br/>\n&gt; eBay to stop selling Nazi memorabilia!!! I am convinced that if enough<br/>\n&gt; people are vocal about this and the pressure is kept on eBay to do the<br/>\n&gt; right moral thing.....that we can have these horrific items removed from<br/>\n&gt; eBay forever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The person I spoke with is:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Kevin Perclad<br/>\n&gt;    VP of Communications<br/>\n&gt;    Phone: 408-558-7458<br/>\n&gt;    Email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kevinp@...\">kevinp@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    The CEO is:<br/>\n&gt;    Meg Whitman<br/>\n&gt;    Email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:meg@...\">meg@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I ask your help in passing this note to all of your friends,local temples<br/>\n&gt; and Jewish organizations. Encourage everyone to contact eBay and tell them<br/>\n&gt; that it is unacceptable for them to profit off of the blood of Jews and<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; all Nazi memorbilia must be removed from eBay now!!!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you very much!!!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To Post a message, send it to:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:transbot@...\">transbot@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To Unsubscribe, send a blank message to: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:transbot-unsubscribe@...\">transbot-unsubscribe@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
