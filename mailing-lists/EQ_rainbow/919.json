Sorry I <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t mean to sound so clicheist (is that really a word?)  Anyway I <br/>\n&gt; have had a couple of run ins with other players who figured out that <br/>\n&gt; I was gay, I honestly don&#39;t know how.  And the experience was not <br/>\n&gt; nice at all.  But hey that&#39;s the way of the world be it Norath or  <br/>\n&gt; Real Life.
