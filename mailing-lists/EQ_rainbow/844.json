I am retired from EQ myself, but I have a 54<br/>\nenchanter and a 52 ranger on Brell. If you need to borrow some plat, or<br/>\nneed some jewlery made, feel free to email me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of our group is on Rodcet Nife where I understand we have a fairly<br/>\nactive happy guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like to be part of the queer guild on Brell I can add you as<br/>\nwell but it is pretty dead.
