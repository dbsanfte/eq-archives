I think the idea for a guild is an<br/>\ninteresting idea but one mainly for people who like to role play which really<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t include me. I also am not keen on the idea of starting up yet another<br/>\ncharacter since my &quot;primary&quot; one has finally reached the upper teens and with<br/>\nit some decent power. I do however wish you all luck and best wishes with<br/>\nstarting up new characters and the guild but don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to join.<br/>\nI will however offer hospitality and help to any of you who happen to be on<br/>\nthe server I play (with many friends, another reason I&#39;m not in a rush to jump<br/>\nservers) Innoruuk.
