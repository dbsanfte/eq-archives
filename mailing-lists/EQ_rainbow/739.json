Now we have both<br/>\n&gt; played EQ for a long while and have had chars on various other<br/>\n&gt; servers prior to Luclin.... yada yada, I&#39;m babbling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyhow, we have only just started fresh on Terris and Lora mentioned<br/>\n&gt; that there are people currently moving to Rodcet Nife starting again<br/>\n&gt; also. This has me curious and we are considering it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Basically I just wanted the name of the guild there and a contact I<br/>\n&gt; could get in touch with to have a chat with about it all.

It was called MegaPlat<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; consisted of a lottery (the grand prize was 665 plat) and raffles<br/>\n&gt; of various<br/>\n&gt; &gt; items (armor, jewelry, weapons, etc.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We had around 20 guild members on at the same time and that set a<br/>\n&gt; record for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us, I believe. A lot of people have been moving over to the Rodcet<br/>\n&gt; server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and this event was a great way for them to get some nice equipment.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Joe and Rob did a great job of coordinating and running the event.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guys.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If anyone else wants to create characters on Rodcet, we invite you<br/>\n&gt; to come<br/>\n&gt; &gt; join us.
