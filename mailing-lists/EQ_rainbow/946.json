They wouldn&#39;t close off that zone <br/>\nso that No one could start a barbarian while some war is going on(?!?!?).. if <br/>\nthey do thats rediculous! :)    But some of the ideas sound kinda nifty.. but <br/>\nI also doubt that they would trash starting sitties, including Rivervale.. <br/>\n(Yikes would they trash the zone music TOO?!? lol)  And cut off teleporting <br/>\nto Karanas alltogether? Seems Kind of unlikely to me, unless they change <br/>\nNorth Karana ring and or spires closer to Surefall, that would be nice!! hehe <br/>\n(if they leave EK druid ring!!)  Oh well, I could be totally proved <br/>\nwrong!!..but I&#39;m still excited either way!<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great day!<br/>\n~Lori :  Ivymayden, Vyxen, X~Melalle</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
