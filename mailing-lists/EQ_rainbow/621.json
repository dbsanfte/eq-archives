Anyway I got the new char to lvl 9 but didnt like him that much, and found the stats and all for the Iksar Shamans and I really liked them. So anyway I got a bunch of armor for my Iksar shaman ready for when Kunark went up. Well I made it all the way from the Docks in Oasis to Cabilis (even inside the city though I was very KOS). Its really not that hard just a long run, but also dangerous if you dont know how to stay away from monsters. Anyway just thought Id share that hehe. And having fun with my new Iksar shaman! Hope to see you.<br/>\n<br/>\nToku<br/>\nIksar Shaman Druzzil Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
