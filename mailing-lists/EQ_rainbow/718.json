If you don&#39;t have it, <br/>\nthis is a freeware program that downloads in about 2 minutes, sets up <br/>\nin about 5, & then takes a varying amount of time to adjust &  tweak <br/>\nto get your sound card to work with it & transmission to go well. It <br/>\nallows you to hear & transmit voice messages while running another <br/>\nprogram, including EQ -- basically a voice chat room. Once you have <br/>\nit all set up, you just open it before you go into EQ. You&#39;ll want to <br/>\nclick &#39;join&#39;, & then you want to join this channel: 216.37.33.36. <br/>\nAfter you&#39;ve done that, you just leave roger open & go into EQ like <br/>\nnormal. We&#39;ve had a few of us going on it for a week or 2 now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSnapdragyn, aka Todd (the one in SF, not the one in Toronto)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
