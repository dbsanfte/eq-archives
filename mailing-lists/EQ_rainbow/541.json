I&#39;m told that only one GM (one that works for Verant) on the<br/>\nwhole server can do it for me (yet tons of GMs who can&#39;t help my petition,<br/>\nNeed to be set up as GM of Mystic Alliance guild, respond and then tell me<br/>\nthey can&#39;t do a thing for me, go figure). I&#39;m told he&#39;s only on weeknights EST<br/>\nwhich is when I usually play anyway, I&#39;ve actually seen him on twice, but not<br/>\nfor long, though I&#39;m sure he goes invisible often.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m still trying to get the guild set up on Innoruuk. Last I know I<br/>\nwas the only one who voluntered for the position (and probably even plays on<br/>\nthat server! heh).
