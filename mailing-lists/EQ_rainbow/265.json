I have<br/>\nfallen behind my friends ingame they all are 4-5 lvls at least ahead of me.<br/>\nThis is due to my lack of playing time lately. I play alot too.. but work<br/>\nthe last few weeks is sucking up the time. So i want to catch up pretty<br/>\nclose to them. so they took me to lake rathier, and in a place close to<br/>\nzone, where i can powerlevel and zone when i am bout ta croak.  Is this<br/>\nconsidered twinking ? i do the fighting, well as much as my mage can<br/>\nhandle.. but is this a bad thing to do ? is it banable ? i like it alot and<br/>\ncan level faster here..</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
