I like my <br/>\nRogue but as of this new patch they still havnt done anything about <br/>\nfixing sneak/hide so they work well (like on the Test Server). Yes <br/>\nits nice they did something about our Poison skills (they&#39;ll probably <br/>\nbe royally screwed up at first;) but honestly the class needs help <br/>\nand the stealth thing was a step in the right direction. I guess <br/>\nsomeone at Verant must REALLY hate Rogues...<br/>\nSorry, I&#39;m disgruntled;)<br/>\nAnyway I was thinking of giving an Enchanter a spin, only class I <br/>\nreally havnt played besides Magician. And if they ever implement <br/>\nenchanting weapons it would definatly be a good skill Guild-wise. <br/>\nHe&#39;ll probably be a High Elf with a name like Timarius (because of <br/>\nmy twisted sense of humour;), if your not a Monty Python fan you <br/>\nmay not get that:) <br/>\nAnyway just dropping you all a line, take care:)<br/>\n<br/>\nLonewolf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
