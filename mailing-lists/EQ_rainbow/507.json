It seems as though he is not leader, it would be good to make him<br/>\nor me leader so we can start a command structure in the rodcet nife guild ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a suggestion:  we should make up a short description of the guild for<br/>\npoele who ask what our guild is about, then we can make it a hot button!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the URL wor the Mystic Alliance website?<br/>\n<br/>\nI ahve a proposal for a guild event.  How about a big lottery for publicity?<br/>\nI ahve it all worked out in my head as to how we could run it.  Big fun.  we<br/>\nwould need at leats 1 person on each server in the guild to commit to it, we<br/>\ncan deicde a time and iron out the kinks.  anyonw think this is a good<br/>\nidea??  ehhe verye five minutes we could press our guild hotbutton for<br/>\npublicity :)  or make a special hot button just for the occasion!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope eveyrone is doing well?  how is the guild doing on other servers?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone on Rodcet Nife need to be guilded???  Nate, make a new chatchter! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-joe<br/>\n=============================<br/>\nJoseph J.
