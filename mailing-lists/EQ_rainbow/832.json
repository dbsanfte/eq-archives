My thanks to all the newly arrived <br/>\nbears who helped us pass the first hurdle of guild approval.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are now ready for actual guild creation of &quot;Nameless Love&quot; on The <br/>\nNameless server.  The GM for our server has Fri and Sat off of work, so <br/>\nwe will meet Sunday instead.  We welcome everyone who wants to attend <br/>\nthis special event!  After all, how often do you get to be there for a <br/>\ngay guild creation?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will gather at November 12 Sunday 3pm Central time.  Because of <br/>\nVerant&#39;s new annoying guild creation rules, everyone MUST be <br/>\n&quot;physically&quot; at the same location for this event!  This time, I&#39;ve <br/>\npicked the tunnel entrance in the Northern Desert of Ro.  This location <br/>\nis relatively close to teleport sites, it&#39;s safe for both newbies and <br/>\ndark races from random attacks during the socializing, and there&#39;s not <br/>\ntoo much other chatter in the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease have your character there promptly at 3pm.  If necessary, move <br/>\nthere prior to Sunday and then camp in the spacious tunnel to await the <br/>\ncelebration.  If you need teleports beforehand, send a message to <br/>\nSoulDreamer in game and I can hook you up with a druid or wizard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll bring plenty of Brandy and Underfoot Triple Bock to share with <br/>\neveryone.  (I wish I could brew some elven wine for this special <br/>\noccasion, but I&#39;ve never had any luck foraging the morning dew <br/>\ningredient!)  I also have some bear meat available for bear sandwiches.  <br/>\n(mmmmmm.  bear sandwiches.  *woof*)  If anyone wants to hunt at the <br/>\ndesert oasis for alligator meat, I&#39;ll have the sauces and spices ready <br/>\nto fix up some tasty pickled gator.  We&#39;ll also try to have party favors <br/>\navailable for everyone: armor, weapons, jewelry.  Not much in the way of <br/>\ntwink items, I think, but all useful stuff for budding adventurers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll future announcements about the guild will be posted to our website <br/>\nat <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sweetvision.com/~namelesslove\">http://www.sweetvision.com/~namelesslove</a> under the discussion board.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope to see you there on Sunday!  My thanks to everyone for the help <br/>\nthey&#39;ve already given to make this event possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n- SoulDreamer, barbarian shaman, on The Nameless server in EverQuest<br/>\n<br/>\n- Terry Walker (The Mellow Tigger) & his 3 rules of life:  <br/>\n   1) Loving always feels good.  <br/>\n   2) Being loved always feels weird.  <br/>\n   3) Wanting to be loved always hurts.  <br/>\n   And I intend to find all three at once.  <br/>\n   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mellowtigger.home.mindspring.com\">http://mellowtigger.home.mindspring.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
