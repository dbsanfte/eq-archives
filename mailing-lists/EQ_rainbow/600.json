It was pretty<br/>\ninteresting.  I was surprised at some of the reasons why boys play girls<br/>\nin online games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that kind of surprised me was that while the &quot;are they gay&quot;<br/>\nissue was raised, there were no quotes or commentary from a gay survey<br/>\nrespondant.  My spider sense says that at least one of the 64 respondants<br/>\nwas gay or bi (there was a crossdresser who responded).<br/>\n<br/>\n- Tina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
