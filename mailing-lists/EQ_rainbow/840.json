I just joined up here and <br/>\nwanted to give some information.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy nameis Owen DuBose and I&#39;m a relatively new player to EQ but a <br/>\nlifelong sci-fi, fantasy and RPG fan. My partner Dan Watson and I <br/>\nboth play EQ on the Brell Serilis server and are looking for other <br/>\ngay/lesbian friends to meet on our server. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy primary character is an Ogre ShadowKnight named Grackk, level 12, <br/>\ncurrently sittinga round Neriak (a/k/a Scrunchyville) trying to level <br/>\nup fletching, smithing and brewing skills while taking side trips to <br/>\nLavastorm to kill drakes and rock dervishes :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy secondary character is a Human Cleric named Dhalgren who is <br/>\ncurrentl hanging in N. Qeynos taking trips to Blackburrow to harass <br/>\nsome the gnolls. He is 6th level.<br/>\n<br/>\nDan&#39;s primary character is a 13th lvl DE Necro named Staben who is, I <br/>\nbelieve currently blitzing around E Commons/N ro/ S Ro and Oasis.<br/>\n<br/>\nDan has a secondary character he hasn&#39;t even played yet, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are very interested in the possibilty of being a part of a g/l <br/>\nguild on Brell or starting one if there isn&#39;t one. We are also <br/>\ninterested in locating other &quot;bear&quot; and &quot;big bear&quot; buddies on Brell <br/>\nto group with or talk to. <br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to to email me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bigbear@...\">bigbear@...</a>!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nOwen</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
