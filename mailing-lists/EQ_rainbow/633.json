I&#39;ve been playing EQ for awhile now and its nice to join a list dedicated to us gay players :-)  My name is Dewayne and I play on the Innoruuk server.  My primary character is 30th lvl druid named Khaav, but I have a lvl 13 twink enchanter named Maharet.  Feel free to give me a /tell if you play on Innoruuk.  I&#39;m not exactly open there but not exactly closeted, some of my guild and a few hunting buddies know.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, I just started a new email list for gay eq players, one that I want to be primarily a roleplaying list.  RP stories are encouraged.  Steamy stuff is allowed but no porn.  To join, go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/EQ_Gays\">http://www.egroups.com/group/EQ_Gays</a> .   I look forward to chatting on both of these lists :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Khaav Sundropped<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuk Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Best friends, most artistic, class clown Find &#39;em here:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4054/7/_/560749/_/959283164/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4054/7/_/560749/_/959283164/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nClick here for Free Video!!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gohip.com/free_video/\">http://www.gohip.com/free_video/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
