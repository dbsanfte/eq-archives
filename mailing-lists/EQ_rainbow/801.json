I just joined a couple<br/>\nof nights ago.  My character is on Rodcet Nife.  His name is Txomin, a dark<br/>\nelf enchanter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat brings me to this server and guild now?  Well, I&#39;ve been playing EQ<br/>\nsince beta 2, and when final release came around, I burned hard for about a<br/>\nyear in it.  In that time I moved from Tarew Marr to Tunare, where I settled<br/>\nand founded with a couple of friends one of the biggest and strongest guilds<br/>\nthere, named Talisman.  I put forth a lot of effort in the guild, and as the<br/>\nleader I encouraged everyone who had problems--in game or real life--to let<br/>\nme know and I&#39;d do everything I could to help.  I looked at my position as<br/>\nthe caretaker of every guildmember&#39;s fun; for me I felt I had to ensure that<br/>\neveryone was having a good time.  It&#39;s a good way to be, and it made the<br/>\nguild a terrific place.  However, 60+ people all coming to you with their<br/>\nproblems daily can be a burden after a while.  Couple that with a really<br/>\nREALLY bad time in my own life and complete burnout was innevitable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, around February of this year, I stopped playing.  I turned over the<br/>\nguild to a really good friend, and it&#39;s still going strong.  For myself, I<br/>\ndivorced EQ for about 6 months.  I fixed my ailing real life (a year of<br/>\nunemployed, continuous EverQuest debauchery can set your existence into a<br/>\ntail-spin), got a job and moved to San Diego.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe break presented the perfect opportunity to move to Rodcet Nife and<br/>\nfinally do what I&#39;d always wished I could have done, and that is join Mystic<br/>\nAlliance.  I couldn&#39;t leave Tunare before, but now I&#39;m free to do it.  Oddly<br/>\nenough, part of the reason I&#39;m playing again is work related.  I&#39;m a content<br/>\nwriter for Verant Interactive/Sony Online Entertainment now, so it&#39;s sort of<br/>\npart of the job!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that&#39;s my story and I&#39;m sticking to it.  As I said, I live in San<br/>\nDiego.  I&#39;m not sure if anyone else lives here or not.  One of the unique<br/>\nadvantages of my job is, I most likely will be attending some of the various<br/>\nEQ Player get-togethers around the country, particularly the one sponsored<br/>\nby Verant.  I believe the next one will be February on the East Coast<br/>\nsomewhere (my old stomping ground), and likely I&#39;ll be there.  So who knows,<br/>\nI may be in a neighborhood near you in the future :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNice to finally be part of something I&#39;d always wished to join in on.<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nClayton Kroh<br/>\n&quot;What a piece of work is a man!
