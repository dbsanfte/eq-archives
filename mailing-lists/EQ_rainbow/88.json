I think<br/>\n that the unity suggestion is a good start, maybe the guild constitution<br/>\n (or whgatveer ytou call it) could be that we seeks to bring all the races,<br/>\n sexes, sexual oreintatiin, species in Norrath togethe rin unity :)   sound<br/>\n cool?  we should also state that it was started but GLBT poele in norrath<br/>\n because they felt the pain of a dis-unified world..ehehhehe i love it (i<br/>\n obviously am a role-player)  So thats my 10 cents, also I know of 3 other<br/>\n poeple on Rodcet nife as of now that may be willing to join thius kind of<br/>\n guild so if anyone on rodcet Nife would like to e-mial me and let me know<br/>\n they want to be a part of it that would be cool, i wouldnt mind being the<br/>\n guild master for Rodcet nife, maybe someone form each server should<br/>\n volunteer to do this so we can start to expedite things.  What do you all<br/>\n think of thhis?   If it dosnt fly, looks like i&#39;[m be plkaying on the new<br/>\n server a bit :)<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n -joe<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A multi-server guild would be easy to create... I recently started my own <br/>\nguild, and in the approval letter it states: &quot;Now that your guild has been <br/>\napproved, you can start it on any and/or all servers of your choice. Simply <br/>\ncontact a Guild GM during the specified hours for the specific server&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n!!!!<br/>\n::lotsa love to all the other queers and queerfriendly::<br/>\n::hugs Lora::<br/>\n<br/>\n--Andrew</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
