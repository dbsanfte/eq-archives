She is a<br/>\nlevel 24 mob but she is guarded by two necromancers and is generally<br/>\nconsidered a tough tough fight.  I&#39;d say two 29s could take her (at least<br/>\none good bolter in there) but it would be hard.  A full party of 20s<br/>\nshould be able to take her as well, with possibly a casualty or two.  Once<br/>\nyou get the room started it&#39;s much easier to hold.  YOu have to wait about<br/>\n4 hours to get boots usually.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 20 Aug 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scollier@...\">scollier@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scollier@...\">scollier@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe.
