I type in Dvorak (a<br/>\ndifferent keyboard layout), which EQ has not supported. Throws me<br/>\nfrom 90 wpm in Dvorak to about 30 in qwerty. So, last month a patch<br/>\non the test server had a message that Verant was looking to modify EQ <br/>\nto support various keyboard layouts -- hurray! I followed the <br/>\ninstructions to modify a text file & email it back to the guy in <br/>\ncharge of that fix so that he would know what keys went where in the <br/>\nlayout I use. I also told him when I did so that the modified text <br/>\nfile to enable Dvorak caused a problem -- a few keys (most<br/>\nimportantly the slash key) didn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, yesterday&#39;s patch included the new file -- with the bug still <br/>\nin it. This means I cannot /g, /gu, /r, /t, /shout, or /anything at <br/>\nall. Aargh! Switching my computer back to qwerty doesn&#39;t change this, <br/>\nas EQ sets its keyboard layout from its own files.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, until this is fixed, I&#39;m stuck switching chat channels in the <br/>\nchat box. Expect me to be in /gu as the default (I think that&#39;s one<br/>\nof the options in there -- surely hope so!), so I won&#39;t be able to <br/>\n/say, /t, or /r anything without a bit of a delay to switch it around <br/>\nin the chat box.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hmmm. How do I use sign-language ingame?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
