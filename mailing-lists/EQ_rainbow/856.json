Unfortunately, there&#39;s me, my lover, and our best friends <br/>\n(another couple). I can discuss it with them, but I&#39;m not sure how <br/>\nthey would feel about leaving Brell. I think the four of us are in a <br/>\nsimilar mindframe to dig in our heels and find the people to get it <br/>\ngoing rather than evac out to another server and start (sigh) all <br/>\nover again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, ultimately, I know what one would say to the idea of ditching <br/>\nhis lvl 31 wizard. I know how I feel about abandoning my beloved <br/>\nGrackk, source of much joy and aggravation (damn ogres level up <br/>\nslower than you can possibly imagine).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever.

Did you advertise in general (such as in a forum) or did <br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;just happen to know 10 other gay/lesbian EQ players, or, well... <br/>\nhow<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;did it come together.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Considering what I&#39;m finding to be a generally gay-intolerant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;attitude on EQ, I hesitate to start a forum thread about a new <br/>\ngay<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;guild or sit around on the chat server hoping 9 other gay people <br/>\nshow<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;up who want to start a guild.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m 33.
