Rather<br/>\nthan remove all of David&#39;s playing time in training everyone individually,<br/>\nmaybe we could have some kind of a newbie event where people who don&#39;t<br/>\nalready have characters make new ones and get trained by those of us who<br/>\nare already on brell.  I&#39;ve done that kind of thing before, and it can be<br/>\nfun and social.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to suggest to anyone that they leave their old server and<br/>\nfriends, but it can be fun to be on multiple servers as well.  If you&#39;re<br/>\nplaying on some other server every night, having a great time, then multi<br/>\nserver stuff may not be for you.  If you find you&#39;re getting a little<br/>\nbored though, maybe trying out a fresh character on a fresh server might<br/>\nbe fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think I mentioned before the idea of having an official &quot;guild<br/>\nnight&quot;.  The basic idea would be every Tuesday evening (or other randomly<br/>\nchosen time) would be the official time to play on Brell with your<br/>\nMystical Alliance character.  This would allow easier grouping, more<br/>\nchatting fun, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
