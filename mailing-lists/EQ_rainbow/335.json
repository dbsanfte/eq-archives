I was at that level a while ago.. and to solve<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; urge for boredom. It was the travelling that made my way fun again. I went<br/>\n&gt; everywhere (well almost) and died a few times. I had fun and thats what my<br/>\n&gt; game is about.. Having fun.. with friends I made. Trust me travelling to<br/>\n&gt; places and testing your limits has got to be the best! Yes you die, and<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; know dying is part of the game. Once I got over the fear of death I had<br/>\nalot<br/>\n&gt; of fun. I mean I was not necessarily suicidal, I was cautious. I test out<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; skills, learn, adventure and enjoy. Aren&#39;t you on the Rodcet Nife ? If you<br/>\n&gt; are, You are more than welcome to join me in my travels. Ill take care of<br/>\n&gt; u.. my friends and guildmates are wonderfull and your bound to have a good<br/>\n&gt; time no matter what. We are all higher levels though, so exp would be eeh<br/>\n&gt; for ya, but wed do our best to keep you alive and adventure as a team.<br/>\nThats<br/>\n&gt; that.. so im here for ya to cure your boredom blues<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WAMPIR@...\">WAMPIR@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WAMPIR@...\">WAMPIR@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 10, 1999 10:44 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_rainbow@onelist.com\">EQ_rainbow@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_rainbow] Anti-Camping ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WAMPIR@...\">WAMPIR@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 8/10/99 1:37:08 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:josephn@...\">josephn@...</a><br/>\n&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; Jeez!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I am a lvl 13 wizard and I need a shoulder to cry on.

I can&#39;t find<br/>\nquality<br/>\n&gt;  poelpe to quest with, most that I have found before are way past me now<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt;  level.  I am so fucing sick of going to the same places and getting<br/>\nhardly<br/>\n&gt;  any expeirence, and spending half the time meditating.  what do I<br/>\ndo!!!???<br/>\n&gt;  Woe is me!   how did you all get past this time?   Is there anyplace I<br/>\n&gt;  sbould go to get good exp or items?

Do some traveling.  Even if your a<br/>\n&gt; Darkelf at elv 13 you can go just about anywhere you want to.  I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; saying<br/>\n&gt; you can fight anywhere you want to. but you can go anywhere you want to.<br/>\n&gt; Find<br/>\n&gt; some people near your lev to fight with. Sometimes a shout is not the best<br/>\n&gt; way to find a group. exp at lower teens. Walk up on a group, and ask<br/>\nnicely<br/>\n&gt; if they have room for another. You will meet the sh8t heads that are rude.<br/>\n&gt; Just ingor them, dont let them get to you. Above all elce have some fun.<br/>\n&gt; Even<br/>\n&gt; dieing can be fun if you look at it the right way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; IMHO<br/>\n&gt; Wampir<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  home to the world&#39;s liveliest email communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can WIN $100 to Amazon.com!<br/>\nIf you join ONElist´┐¢s FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
