I <br/>\ndefently cant see my Dark Elf Necro with a guild tital of Spirit of Harmony. <br/>\nI would be laughted out of Nektulos forest if I showed up with that next to <br/>\nmy name. <br/>\n<br/>\nWampir<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 7/29/99 9:42:14 AM Eastern Daylight Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:josephn@...\">josephn@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Well,<br/>\n <br/>\n Spirit of Harmony is of course still a possibility, but as I pointed out<br/>\n last night in the chat, the name implies such a &quot;goody-goody&quot; theme that<br/>\n &quot;evil&quot; and maybe even &quot;neutral&quot; chacrhters would seem silly in the giuld.<br/>\n therefore the poeple who remianed in the chat last night tried ot thik of<br/>\n somehting that would not imply a good-oriented nature to the guild, but<br/>\n rather a neutral orientation.  Force of synergy can be taken in many<br/>\n ways....synergy is the joining of energy or ideas, therefore the titlew<br/>\n can be seen as the coming togethe of the ideas outlined in the charter, as<br/>\n well as the energy of the poeple in the guild working towards the goals<br/>\n outlined in the charter.  In this sense even a dark elf neromancer, could<br/>\n join our guild and seek the mutual respect or &quot;tolerance&quot;<br/>\n  of all members as well as the poeple of Norrath at large.  this dosnt<br/>\n mean this Dark elf necro has to necesarily like or love the wood elves<br/>\n around, just respect and elarn from them as the charter describes.<br/>\n <br/>\n I understand that these ideas may not work for everyone, but i think that<br/>\n &quot;spirit of harmony&quot; would work even less for people.<br/>\n <br/>\n In my personal case my 12th lvl Wizard (Fentus) is a neutral-good<br/>\n charchter who would not want to join a guild that seeks Harmony between<br/>\n all people (he just dose not see this as relaistic or practical) but a<br/>\n guild that prmotes respect for poeple would be fine (especially since the<br/>\n diversity he would then encouter could benefit him in his search for<br/>\n knowledge)<br/>\n <br/>\n Lastly, this guild name and charter would not necessarily be good for the<br/>\n evilest of evil, though they would be wecome to join.  but i dont think we<br/>\n could createa guild that would be ok for EVERYONE.  But spirit of Harmony<br/>\n would be a step in the opposite direction. &gt;&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
