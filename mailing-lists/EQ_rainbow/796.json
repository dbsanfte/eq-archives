It leaves your groin<br/>\nunprotected.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I&#39;m not into working out. My philosophy is no pain, no pain.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I&#39;m in shape. Round is a shape.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. I&#39;m desperately trying to figure out why Kamikaze pilots wore<br/>\nhelmets.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Do illiterate people get the full effect of alphabet soup?<br/>\n<br/>\n6. I&#39;ve always wanted to be somebody, but I should have been more<br/>\nspecific.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Ever notice when you blow in a dog&#39;s face he gets mad at you, but<br/>\nwhen you take him in a car he sticks his head out the window?<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Ever notice that anyone going slower than you is an idiot, but<br/>\nanyone going faster is a maniac?<br/>\n<br/>\n9. You have to stay in shape. My mother started walking five miles a<br/>\nday when she was 35. She&#39;s 70 now and we have no idea where she is.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. I have six locks on my door, all in a row. When I go out, I lock<br/>\nevery other one. I figure no matter how long somebody stands there<br/>\npicking the locks, they are always locking three of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n11. One out of every three Americans is suffering from some form of<br/>\nmental illness. Think of two of your best friends. If they are OK, then<br/>\nit must be you.<br/>\n<br/>\n12. They show you how detergents take out bloodstains. I think if<br/>\nyou&#39;ve got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe your laundry isn&#39;t<br/>\nyour biggest problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n13. If you ask certain people why they have deer heads on their walls, they<br/>\nusually tell you it&#39;s because they&#39;re such beautiful animals. I think my<br/>\nsignificant other is<br/>\nvery attractive, but I only have photos of them on the wall.<br/>\n<br/>\n14. A lady came up to me on the street, pointed at my black leather jacket<br/>\nand<br/>\nsaid,<br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t you know a cow was murdered for that jacket?&quot;<br/>\nand I said &quot;I didn&#39;t know there were any witnesses. Now I&#39;ll have to kill<br/>\nyou too&quot;.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
