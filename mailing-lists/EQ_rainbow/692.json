Today I entered Crush Bone right after a nasty<br/>\ntrain<br/>\n&gt; had chased me out. I came upon a TROLL (His name is/was Bezerker) who<br/>\ncon&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; green to me (He was ALSO very twinked..FULL Crafted..Exe. Axe etc. ) and<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; be being hit on by a lowly GREEN orc. Needless to say we all know the woes<br/>\n&gt; of trying to loot while having something hit us..we don&#39;t like it. SO, I<br/>\n&gt; kill the greeny orc. Bezerker THEN curses me out for being a KS&#39;er and<br/>\nsays<br/>\n&gt; he has reported me. I was STUNNED! I spoke with him a few moments to<br/>\nassure<br/>\n&gt; him of my good intent but he would have none of it. Upon exiting CB I saw<br/>\n&gt; him in a duel with another PC. The PC won and I applauded. The Bezerker<br/>\n&gt; person was apparently not to bright because he was BOUND in G Fay and had<br/>\n&gt; died numerous times. I was impressed to see that he undone himself by<br/>\ndying<br/>\n&gt; too much. Upon getting killed ONCE more by Orcs, his TWINKED body<br/>\n&gt; Decayed...EVERYTHING he had on him was GONE** POOF**. I know now that<br/>\nthere<br/>\n&gt; is a goddess and she loves me :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Signed,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gypsiee (Sandy)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Check out Tupperware&#39;s Special Offers!<br/>\n&gt; Limited Time Only!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6335/9/_/560749/_/963417484/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6335/9/_/560749/_/963417484/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
