Anyway, I think the guild would be a great idea. It seems like we have a few people on the Rodcet Nife server, but many of us are spread all over different servers.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps we should consider David&#39;s idea of setting up this &quot;GLBT&quot; guild on the new roleplaying server, Brell Serilis. We could all start from scratch and learn about each other in a group of the same level. Sirenia is a Level 24 High Elven Cleric, but I would be willing to give it all up to start again with all of you if you are interested. Then I am certain we would have enough members to form a guild there. What does everyone think of this?<br/>\n<br/>\nSirenia Featherly, Priestess of Tunare<br/>\nLake Rathetear, Antonica<br/>\nThe Rathe Server<br/>\n<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: David Lari &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kerik@...\">kerik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_rainbow@onelist.com\">EQ_rainbow@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_rainbow@onelist.com\">EQ_rainbow@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: July 21, 1999 5:30 AM<br/>\n    Subject: [EQ_rainbow] Hello Everyone<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    From: David Lari &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kerik@...\">kerik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    <br/>\n    In RL my name is David. On EQ I am on the Veeshan server and mostly play a<br/>\n    lvl 12 Cleric named Layf. Also occasionally play a lvl 6 Paladin name<br/>\n    Rhoki, and have started a High Elf magician named Eloy. I am also thinking<br/>\n    about creating a wood elf (because I think those guys are just sooo cute.<br/>\n    :)<br/>\n    <br/>\n    My Cleric and Paladin are human and hang out around the Freeport area. I<br/>\n    would like to start a GLBT guild on Veeshan if I can get enough people.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    I am interested in hearing from any GLBT people on Veeshan so send me a<br/>\n    message or give me tell.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    If you&#39;d like to learn more about me in RL, visit my home page:<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/westhollywood/6270\">http://www.geocities.com/westhollywood/6270</a><br/>\n    <br/>\n    Also, is anyone on the list going to create characters on the new role<br/>\n    playing server that just came online last night?<br/>\n    <br/>\n    Hugs,<br/>\n    David</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
