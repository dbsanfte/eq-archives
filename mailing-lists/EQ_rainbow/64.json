We need unification!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am on Veeshan as 12th lvl Cleric, Layf (get bind in 2 more levels! Woohoo!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know Beth is also on Veeshan. Wasn&#39;t there a same sex wedding on Veeshan? I<br/>\nknow there was on some server. I would want to continue to play on Veeshan some<br/>\nof the time but could play half time on another server for the sake of the<br/>\nguild. I have too many friends on Veeshan to give it up entirely though.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the way to address this is also to find ways to contact other GLBT<br/>\npeople. We know there have to be plenty of queer and queer friendly (hello<br/>\nLora) people on all the servers to form guilds on all. How can we contact them?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking of ways. I know some gay mags like the Advocate have a cyber<br/>\nsection. I could send them a press release. Also, other mags too, like XY. But<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I just want to go in game and start /shouting &#39;hey anybody want<br/>\nto join a queer guild?&#39; across all the zones.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis brings up another issue. What to name it. Some people are trying to make a<br/>\nguild on the soon to be up race war server and call it the &quot;Rainbow Warriors&quot;.<br/>\nPersonally, while I&#39;m totally out in RL (anyone see my letter in the Advocate<br/>\nwith Xena on the cover?) I&#39;m not wanting to be so bold in EQ which seems to be<br/>\npopulated with many sexually insecure teenage boys who would be all too happy<br/>\nto start abusing us. I&#39;d like the guild to be very subtle. So a name like &quot;The<br/>\nStone Wall&quot; or &quot;Mattachine Society&quot; or something else that would require a good<br/>\nknowledge of gay history to understand would be better, IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I will be making a web page for GLBT EQ players. I will be posting the<br/>\ninfo about my characters on it and will let you all know when I get it up. Then<br/>\nif you like, you will be able to send me info about your characters to be put<br/>\non the page too.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scollier@...\">scollier@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scollier@...\">scollier@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think getting a GUILD started is a GREAT idea...however...some of us are<br/>\n&gt; on different servers. We need unification..yes..I looked that word up just<br/>\n&gt; for this occasion! Lets start by saying what server we are all currently<br/>\n&gt; on, which character we play the MOST and go from there. The ONLY problem I<br/>\n&gt; see is that we may have to play our favorite character half time while we<br/>\n&gt; play our &#39;GUILD&#39; character the other half. SHAME we cant transfer<br/>\n&gt; characters from server to server..sigh. Give me some feedbaack FOLKS!
