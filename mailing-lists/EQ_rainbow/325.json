Now I read that they put in Anti-Camping code ingame. I heard<br/>\n&gt;people say it wasnt true.. but we decided to go to Najena for the J Boots. <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;being 17 and my party being on 22-25 I was the outcast, but they are my<br/>\n&gt;regular companions, so I knew Id be ok. _I am not one to level efficently <br/>\n&gt;so<br/>\n&gt;thats why im such a weenie compared to them.. Anyhow.. we get to the place<br/>\n&gt;where the J boots spawn and there is a group there.. Said they&#39;ve been <br/>\n&gt;there<br/>\n&gt;for 6 hours. So We wait, and 2 spawns no boots, next 2 spawns were not even<br/>\n&gt;the named NPC for them,  A necro spawned instead. So After like a hour, I<br/>\n&gt;got bored and we left..Decided to get tantacle whip. I have the key so we<br/>\n&gt;are going back early today.. but I am thinking for what if its going to <br/>\n&gt;take<br/>\n&gt;us 3 hours just to get one Journeyman boots ? uugh.. have any of you seen<br/>\n&gt;this in specific areas besides here ? Cause I want to Kill Najena to get <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;FBR, but don&#39;t want (nor have the time) to wait for 6 hours before I get<br/>\n&gt;mine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyone else have this issue ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reuben<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
