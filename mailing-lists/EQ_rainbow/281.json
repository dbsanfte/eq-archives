THIS<br/>\nlist of &#39;rules&#39; has saved me more often than not. Hope they are useful to<br/>\nyou:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Someone yells RUN! - YOU RUN and DONT ask &#39;What?&#39; - If you ask what,<br/>\nyou usually DIE and then find out. Example - I was fighting something in<br/>\nthe desert...someone yelled RUN..I turned too look...I was stunned to see a<br/>\nSand Giant chasing after someone near me..VERY near me. They zoned...Sand<br/>\nGiant saw me and Squashed me like a bug.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) If you are in a party and someone yells RUN..follow the above rule.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) If you are in a party and someone or everyone just isnt listening or<br/>\nworking together...DISBAND and leave those losers to die..because is you<br/>\ndon&#39;t, you will DIE with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) If you can buff someone, do so. Making friends can be fun and<br/>\nprofitable. They will remember you and probably help YOU out someday.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Never be afraid (or too cautious) to try a new place to hunt or explore.<br/>\nMeat and Potatos of EQ is exploring..fun fun fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n6) ALWAYS get a bind in a new city if you can. You&#39;d really hate having to<br/>\nrun all the way to a new continent just to get your things.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) CONs the bad guys before attacking! You may live longer.<br/>\n<br/>\n8) AVOID making a train and leading it by others as you try to ZONE FOR<br/>\nYOUR LIFE! They WILL remember you and made get even later.<br/>\n<br/>\n9) Good rule of thumb - put at least 4 gold, a weapon, 4 water and food in<br/>\nthe bank...maybe a backpack if you can. Nothing like dying and coming back<br/>\npoor, defenseless and hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelp, those are some things that have served me well. If they help you too,<br/>\nCOOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nLove ya all!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
