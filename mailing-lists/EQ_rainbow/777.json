I found<br/>\n&gt; your listing through one of the other EQ message boards.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been seriously thinking of relocating servers to join many of<br/>\n&gt; you on the Rodcet Nife server.  Currently i have several low level<br/>\n&gt; characters on the Mithaniel Marr server, so if any of you are on that<br/>\n&gt; server please give me an in-game tell or email me (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdincinci@...\">jdincinci@...</a>).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A little about me:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * James Dillon<br/>\n&gt; * 28<br/>\n&gt; * I live in Cincinnati, OH and work for an advertising agency as<br/>\n&gt; their Information Systems person, i.e. Nick Burns (for all of you<br/>\n&gt; Saturday Night Live fans).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Primary Character (right now):  Renette 10 Wood Elf Druid<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have several other characters, but Renette is the one i&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; playing most lately.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Most Hated EQ Monster:  The Kerran High Guard.  My first character<br/>\n&gt; was an Erudite Magician and i was one of the rare people that<br/>\n&gt; actually hunted in Tox Forest and Kerra Isle.  That Kerran High Guard<br/>\n&gt; must have killed me 50 times before i decided to take my first boat<br/>\n&gt; ride to Qeynos.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Favorite EQ Monster:  Spectre (Only because they are neat looking)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well i will stop there.  I will probably create a character on Rodcet<br/>\n&gt; Nife now just so i can have a fun group to chat with.  Do you have<br/>\n&gt; any low level characters in your guild (Mystic Alliance)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I am glad to have found this group and other gay people that<br/>\n&gt; like playing EQ...I knew you were out there!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; James<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
