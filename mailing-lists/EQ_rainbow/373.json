A friend of mine got burned out<br/>\nplaying his 35th level Dwarf Paladin and gave him to me to play. As I was<br/>\ntraveling around I ran into someone he had gamed with. The man was very<br/>\nhappy to see &#39;me&#39; on line again and promptly told me of everything that had<br/>\nhappened to him in the last while. Not wanting to embarras him I played<br/>\nalong. He noticed my character hadnt any of the neat things he used to have<br/>\nand offered to help me out. He gives me SEVERAL backpacks FULL of magic<br/>\nItems and THEN takes me to the bank and SHOVELS 1600 pp into my pockets! I<br/>\nnearly faint! I thank him and promise to group with him soon as he<br/>\ncamps..waves and POOFS out. Man! I think Im drunk on money! I was actually<br/>\nENCUMBERED by the MONEY he gave me! (160 lbs worth!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
