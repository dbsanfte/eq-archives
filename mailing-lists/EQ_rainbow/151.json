And then hand the guild chapters over to others. I&#39;ll<br/>\nstart making a list of who will be the guildmaster on each server.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big issue of course is reaching out to other GLBT people. One day I did a<br/>\nsearch for the words &quot;everquest&quot; and &quot;westhollywood&quot; so I could find people on<br/>\ngeocities and that&#39;s how I found Rhonda and then she told Hamlet, and they both<br/>\njoined. We&#39;ve all got to get creative and think of more ways. And when we find<br/>\none person, they usually know others, so it could snowball pretty fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will try to send a press release to the Advocate for their cyber column as well<br/>\nas XY magazine. But it will take awhile for that to have an effect since they<br/>\nhave long lead times. In the press release, which I will post here for review<br/>\nfirst, I will mention EQ_Rainbow and the guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else have ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WAMPIR@...\">WAMPIR@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WAMPIR@...\">WAMPIR@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello all.<br/>\n&gt; One thing I think everyone should know. We only need ten people to get the<br/>\n&gt; guild started, and they dont all have to have a player on the same server.<br/>\n&gt; Which means that a guild can start basicly on all the servers once it has<br/>\n&gt; been approved. Only thing is the guild master has to have a char on the<br/>\n&gt; server to petition and get it created. After the guild has been created on a<br/>\n&gt; server if the guildmaster doesnt want to be the guildmaster on that server he<br/>\n&gt; can hand it off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So what I am basicly saying is. Even thought I dont have the time to play a<br/>\n&gt; char on the ber server I will be there tonight to help get the guild started.<br/>\n&gt; If David doent want to be the guildmaster on my particular<br/>\n&gt; server(bristlebane) I would be happy to take over for him. All he would need<br/>\n&gt; to do is start a temp char. Petition for the guild. Then hand it over to me<br/>\n&gt; or whom every they want.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So if you do not play on the roleplay server please dont fell left out. I am<br/>\n&gt; sure when Unity is made. You will quickly see the guild all over.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Going on the old 10% rule. There  should be almost 2000 GLBT people playing<br/>\n&gt; the game. They just are not on this list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let me know what you think<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wampir<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
