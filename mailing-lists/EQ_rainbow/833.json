I have a few lower level characters on MT. To <br/>\nbe specific: a lvl 15 Druid named Izidor, lvl 10 Shammy named <br/>\nZalumar, and a seductive lvl 10 Necro named Mortalia. They all solo <br/>\npretty well so far, but it would be cool to have a partner(s) once in <br/>\na while.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll admit that I need variety so I always create new charachters to <br/>\ntry out, but the ones mentioned are my permanent ones. I am usually <br/>\non 9-11PM Los Angeles time or late night on weekends. Just e-mail mr <br/>\nor give me a tell in Norrath!                   <br/>\n                                         -JOE</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
