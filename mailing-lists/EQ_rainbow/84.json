I think<br/>\nthat the unity suggestion is a good start, maybe the guild constitution<br/>\n(or whgatveer ytou call it) could be that we seeks to bring all the races,<br/>\nsexes, sexual oreintatiin, species in Norrath togethe rin unity :)   sound<br/>\ncool?  we should also state that it was started but GLBT poele in norrath<br/>\nbecause they felt the pain of a dis-unified world...ehehhehe i love it (i<br/>\nobviously am a role-player)  So thats my 10 cents, also I know of 3 other<br/>\npoeple on Rodcet nife as of now that may be willing to join thius kind of<br/>\nguild so if anyone on rodcet Nife would like to e-mial me and let me know<br/>\nthey want to be a part of it that would be cool, i wouldnt mind being the<br/>\nguild master for Rodcet nife, maybe someone form each server should<br/>\nvolunteer to do this so we can start to expedite things.  What do you all<br/>\nthink of thhis?   If it dosnt fly, looks like i&#39;[m be plkaying on the new<br/>\nserver a bit :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-joe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
