It was called <br/>\nMegaPlat <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; consisted of a lottery (the grand prize was 665 plat) and raffles <br/>\n&gt; of various<br/>\n&gt; &gt; items (armor, jewelry, weapons, etc.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; We had around 20 guild members on at the same time and that set a <br/>\n&gt; record for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us, I believe.
