Does anyone have a copy of the final<br/>\napproved charter?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had a request for a copy from an interested player on Brell. :)  Not a <br/>\nmember of the list, I could recite the short version (from the chat and posted<br/>\nhere at beginning of name discission).   Maybe a guild with a tag and charter<br/>\nidentifying the group will bring more together?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone does can it be posted please?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lora<br/>\n(hoping to get Melodie, Shiri and Lynx tagged on Brell this week)<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.<br/>\nOn the transgendered characters.  My Bard Melodie(female char) was heavily<br/>\nflirted <br/>\nwith by a female char Monk in a recent group.  I *assumed* the female Monk<br/>\nwas male<br/>\nplayed, but didn&#39;t ask since it really doesn&#39;t matter to me.  First all the<br/>\nmale <br/>\nchars got &quot;very quiet&quot; ... but when I responded without shock (yes I agree<br/>\nshe does<br/>\nlook good in leather! hehe), it quickly opened up and the male chars were<br/>\nvying for <br/>\nflirt lines with the female char.  All light banter ... fun was had by all.<br/>\n So,<br/>\nwe either had a transgendered char accepted, or Rping of a Bi with<br/>\n(Les/Bi)/Straights<br/>\ncontending for her interest.  The good point is it was relaxed and all<br/>\nseemed to <br/>\nenjoy it :)  NO ONE asked either myself (or the Monk to my knowlege) what<br/>\nsex the player<br/>\nwas :)  (or what our RL orientation was).  Nice to see.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
