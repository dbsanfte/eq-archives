Don&#39;t give up on your old one, but tryign a<br/>\n&gt; new character can give you a fresh perspective on the game.  It provides<br/>\n&gt; you with an alternative when you feel bored with your wizard.  If you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; sick of medding try a rogue or warrior or monk.  Bards can cast spells,<br/>\n&gt; and don&#39;t need to med.  Paladins and rangers and SKs don&#39;t need to med<br/>\n&gt; much.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Items in Everquest are highly overrated, in particular for mages.  They<br/>\n&gt; are mostly there for status.  EQs social hierarchy is based on levels,<br/>\n&gt; plat, and items.  In terms of your effectiveness as a wizard, items<br/>\n&gt; matter, but not that much!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of the things I really like about Brell right now is that everyone is<br/>\n&gt; low level.  It&#39;s so crazy compared to Mithanial Marr where there are many<br/>\n&gt; 50th level characters.  I&#39;m a 21st level enchanter, and I am the highest<br/>\n&gt; level enchanter on the server (as far as I know).  Most people are under<br/>\n&gt; 20th level.  Of the over 20th level people, most are soloing<br/>\n&gt; druids/necros/wizards.  Cazic Thule only had 5 people in it when I stopped<br/>\n&gt; by the other day.  It&#39;s a very fresh environment.  No one has any gold or<br/>\n&gt; platnum jewlery.  Newer servers can offer a great environment to play your<br/>\n&gt; character where life does not revolve around rare expensive items.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Christina<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How do you enter ONElist´┐¢s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\n&gt; By joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
