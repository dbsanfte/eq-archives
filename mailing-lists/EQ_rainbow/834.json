I had been on every search engine I could think of and <br/>\nnothing was coming up, finally I got to HOTBOT and there it was <br/>\nEQ_Rainbow. As I was clicking the link, I thought for sure it would <br/>\nbe dead. But it wasn&#39;t (YAY!) and here I am. I always knew there had <br/>\nto be others on EQ, but I was starting to have doubts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been playing on Morrel-Thule for the last 7 months or so, but <br/>\nnot reguarly until recently. Anyway, I have decided that since I <br/>\nfinally found the group, I am going to move over to Rodcet Nife and <br/>\ncreate a new character (I can&#39;t believe I have to be a newbie AGAIN!)<br/>\nAt least, no one took my name. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I just wanted to say &quot;Hey&quot; to everyone and if you are in EQ <br/>\non Rodcet Nife give a /tell to Kedek, I am very interested in joining <br/>\nthe guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil then,<br/>\n<br/>\nKedek Vega<br/>\n2nd season Rodcet Nife<br/>\nBarbarian-Shaman</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
