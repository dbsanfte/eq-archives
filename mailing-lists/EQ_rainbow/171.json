Last","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-623652269\">Yes, I&#39;m starting to get to the point that I really don&#39;t care at all about<br/>\nthe name. The important thing is having a guild and the advantages of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Kurt and his Bumpus character met up with my Dedric character on<br/>\nBrell and we helped each other out. We tried to get ruined wolf pelts so we<br/>\ncan make size small patchwork for our guild members. And he helped collect<br/>\nbone chips for me to use for my Necro pet spells. And then I got an extra<br/>\npair of shoes off an Orc Pawn and gave them to Bumpus since he didn&#39;t have<br/>\nany shoes. This is what I see as the advantage of the guild that will be<br/>\nuniversal to all the servers the guild is represented on.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, on the Brell Serilis server, we may wish to have a charter that<br/>\nemphasizes role playing more since it is a role playing server. So this<br/>\naspect might not be shared among all the chapters.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if any of you come over to gnome land, just look for Dedric and Bumpus.<br/>\nAlso, we travel to Greater Faydark a bit too, so you Wood and High Elves<br/>\ngive us a tell too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd hopefully we&#39;ll have some consensus on a name for the guild. At this<br/>\npoint I am going to agree with whatever gets the most support from everyone<br/>\nelse just so we can move on.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
