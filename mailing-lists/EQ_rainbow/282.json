The colors<br/>\nhelp to see how dead you can be for trying to kill the person, but this is<br/>\nkey in determining if you are KOS by what they say and you being their<br/>\ndoomed prey.  There has been many times where i was KOS because i saw red<br/>\nand didn&#39;t read the con wording.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Magicians, use hotkeys for your pets. Ie, create a hotkey that tells<br/>\nyour /pet attack, /pet backoff. This way you can send pull and command your<br/>\npet with one button. Its very easy and very effective and can save your life<br/>\n<br/>\nPut the loc as a hot key. This way if you are doomed.. example you are<br/>\ngetting mauled and you know you can&#39;t make it to zone and are going to bite<br/>\nit, hit the /loc key to get your location before you die. This way you can<br/>\nwrite it down and make your corpse easier to find. This is a lifesaver trust<br/>\nme..<br/>\n<br/>\nAlways be generous when you can..I am mage and plenty o people ask for a<br/>\nbind, and bandages, daggers food water.. so on.. When I can, I do it, I<br/>\nnever charge but always accept donations. (key word if i can or i am waiting<br/>\nfor someone, ill do it-kindness pays good rewards and frienships and the<br/>\noccasional good item are helpfull<br/>\n<br/>\nBe SOCIAL!!  These people you meet in Norrath will prove helpfull to you in<br/>\ngame.. i have met people who gave me things just for speaking to them... so<br/>\nkindess is always rewarding. There is plenty of anti-social people out there<br/>\nand you never know, that person may save your hide oneday. I have helped out<br/>\nplenty who are in need and they have helped me out some point later on in<br/>\ngame..Remember .. THE KARMA WHEEL SPINS FULL CIRCLE......<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scollier@...\">scollier@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scollier@...\">scollier@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, August 05, 1999 3:14 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_rainbow@onelist.com\">eq_rainbow@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_rainbow] Things to game by...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scollier@...\">scollier@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are few tips for those on the list that are new to Everquest. THIS<br/>\nlist of &#39;rules&#39; has saved me more often than not. Hope they are useful to<br/>\nyou:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Someone yells RUN! - YOU RUN and DONT ask &#39;What?&#39; - If you ask what,<br/>\nyou usually DIE and then find out. Example - I was fighting something in<br/>\nthe desert...someone yelled RUN..I turned too look...I was stunned to see a<br/>\nSand Giant chasing after someone near me..VERY near me. They zoned...Sand<br/>\nGiant saw me and Squashed me like a bug.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) If you are in a party and someone yells RUN..follow the above rule.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) If you are in a party and someone or everyone just isnt listening or<br/>\nworking together...DISBAND and leave those losers to die..because is you<br/>\ndon&#39;t, you will DIE with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) If you can buff someone, do so. Making friends can be fun and<br/>\nprofitable. They will remember you and probably help YOU out someday.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Never be afraid (or too cautious) to try a new place to hunt or explore.<br/>\nMeat and Potatos of EQ is exploring..fun fun fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n6) ALWAYS get a bind in a new city if you can. You&#39;d really hate having to<br/>\nrun all the way to a new continent just to get your things.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) CONs the bad guys before attacking! You may live longer.<br/>\n<br/>\n8) AVOID making a train and leading it by others as you try to ZONE FOR<br/>\nYOUR LIFE! They WILL remember you and made get even later.<br/>\n<br/>\n9) Good rule of thumb - put at least 4 gold, a weapon, 4 water and food in<br/>\nthe bank...maybe a backpack if you can. Nothing like dying and coming back<br/>\npoor, defenseless and hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelp, those are some things that have served me well. If they help you too,<br/>\nCOOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nLove ya all!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nTransfer your big list to ONElist and earn $500!<br/>\nFor program details, go to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
