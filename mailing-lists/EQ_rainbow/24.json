I think this list is a great idea because it&#39;s hard for me to discuss a game like Everquest with friends from the gay community because I don&#39;t know anyone who is as devoted to RPGs as I am. Anyway, I&#39;m glad from the opportunity to speak with all of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Sirenia and I reside on the Rathe server. I am currently a Level 20 High Elven Female Cleric, and I am scheduled to wed a High Elven Male Paladin when he attains Level 20 also. Thanks to the magic of Everquest, I always end up playing a female character that the men flock to all the time. I have to fend them off with my Ogre War Maul!!! Anyway, I have many other characters ranging in levels from 6-14 but they are all on the Rathe server also. To explain a little, I play a female character because that is the only way I&#39;ll get to roleplay romance with a man on Everquest. I would love an opportunity to roleplay a male-male love interest, because then I&#39;m not so worried about having to tell each man that I&#39;m actually male in real life!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think having a guild with many of us on the same server would be a great idea. I would be willing to leave my guild and server if there is enough interest in starting one up on a new server. Please let me know if this would come about. I would do my best to contribute what I can...  Now I believe I have rambled off enough already. I shall leave you all to you excitement world of Norrath, and hope to speak with each of you online one day. May Tunare guide you safely towards your dreams wherever they may lead you, and always uphold the virtues of righteousness no matter what vile demons dare to wreak havoc upon our fair lands. Best of luck to you all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSirenia, Priestess of Tunare<br/>\nRivervale, Antonica<br/>\nThe Rathe Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
