There are lots of ways to<br/>\navoid unwanted sexual situations in the game.  Relate to the person as a<br/>\nfriend, overtly, dismissing advances as a joke.  Tell the person flat out<br/>\nyou&#39;re not interested.  Make up some suitable background story, like your<br/>\nspouse died, or was lost at sea, or something that allows you to dismiss<br/>\nromantic possiblities without insulting the person.  You could also just<br/>\nsay out of character that you&#39;re not comfortable with in-game romance, and<br/>\nthat you&#39;re just here to adventure and have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, 8 Aug 1999, Amber Gaines wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Amber Gaines&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:amber_sweet@...\">amber_sweet@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hey,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, heres a little problem that follows the issue...<br/>\n&gt; I play a level 30 half-elf female, and from day one I&#39;ve always had guys <br/>\n&gt; hitting on me, hehe.. Well in RL Im just a 20yr male w/ a fairly feminime <br/>\n&gt; personality and I love to dress and look like a girl when I have the <br/>\n&gt; oppurtunity.. Problem is Im totally straight so when guys hit on me I kinda <br/>\n&gt; like freak out and try to avoid them. Although one guy in particular never <br/>\n&gt; leaves me alone. He really is a nice guy. He groups with me alot and points <br/>\n&gt; some great hunting grounds out. Of course I never had the guts to tell him I <br/>\n&gt; really am a guy. He is around level 45 and knows alot of the high level <br/>\n&gt; people, and the last thing I want is to be constantly harrased by all of <br/>\n&gt; them when I start exploring the high level dungeons and need these people in <br/>\n&gt; my group.. Well, anywayz hes always trying to smooch me and such, and I just <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think I can be comfy roleplaying that.. maybe I should tell him I have <br/>\n&gt; a in game boyfriend already? Hmm, probably a little too late for that now.. <br/>\n&gt; =&#92;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Amber<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist now has T-SHIRTS!<br/>\n&gt; For details and to order, go to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html\">http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
