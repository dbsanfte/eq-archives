I had<br/>\nthe pleasure of joining in on the defenders of High Hold Keep. As I heard of<br/>\nthe events, I immediatly went to High Keep to join in the defense guild.<br/>\nFrom that point on it was Patrol and take posts and wait..until it began<br/>\nwith a whisper in the woods saying &quot;War War...&quot;  They were plenty in number,<br/>\ncoming from Neriak through the commons and nektulos. Needless to say I<br/>\nroleplayed this one big time.. I was even able to take down 1 inkie and 1<br/>\ntroll that was in the invasion on my own. In the end, I saw Neresei<br/>\nwandering around and sending shouts.. she was a High level Dark Elf PC and<br/>\nwas real tough. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was even a instance of someone casting Ice Comet on a crowd of us..<br/>\nthat was devistating. There was plenty of Gm&#39;s involved as there were many<br/>\nNPCs sending out threats .. and as one threat by Neresie told us to give in<br/>\nto Innoruk&#39;s children, I opened up my big mouth and sent a shout telling<br/>\nNeresei that &quot;You fool, your demise will be in the name of Mithaniel Marr&quot;.<br/>\nWell that was a mistake lol as she and her generals sent shouts speaking of<br/>\nmy bones as they needed them... They were after me. Well I was by riverdale<br/>\nand with a group of us attempting to defend riverdale.. Next thing I knew we<br/>\nwere swarmed and I was prime target.. they tore me to shreds.. with one<br/>\nfinal shout I claimed &quot;my death was not in vain for the light shall<br/>\nprevail&quot;. &quot;Loading Please Wait..&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSo upon corpse retrieval.. I went to get my body and rest in riverdale, by<br/>\nthat time Riverdale was taken over by them... Thats all I know as I had to<br/>\ncamp for the evening.. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was truly a great event IMHO.. I do feel bad for all the people that<br/>\nlost levels due to this.. but hey I didn&#39;t mind the exp loss at such a fun<br/>\nprice.. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow did the raids go on your servers ? I heard they were server wide. Im<br/>\ncurious to see if they actually took over High Keep.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
