The important thing is having a guild and the advantages of it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night Kurt and his Bumpus character met up with my Dedric character on<br/>\n&gt; Brell and we helped each other out. We tried to get ruined wolf pelts so we<br/>\n&gt; can make size small patchwork for our guild members. And he helped collect<br/>\n&gt; bone chips for me to use for my Necro pet spells. And then I got an extra<br/>\n&gt; pair of shoes off an Orc Pawn and gave them to Bumpus since he didn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; any shoes. This is what I see as the advantage of the guild that will be<br/>\n&gt; universal to all the servers the guild is represented on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, on the Brell Serilis server, we may wish to have a charter that<br/>\n&gt; emphasizes role playing more since it is a role playing server. So this<br/>\n&gt; aspect might not be shared among all the chapters.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, if any of you come over to gnome land, just look for Dedric and Bumpus.<br/>\n&gt; Also, we travel to Greater Faydark a bit too, so you Wood and High Elves<br/>\n&gt; give us a tell too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And hopefully we&#39;ll have some consensus on a name for the guild. At this<br/>\n&gt; point I am going to agree with whatever gets the most support from everyone<br/>\n&gt; else just so we can move on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How do you enter ONElist´┐¢s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\n&gt; By joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
