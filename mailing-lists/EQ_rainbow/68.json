I signed up for the list when I <br/>\nsaw it on eqvault one day and thought it was a great idea.  I recently sold <br/>\nmy 31 cleric on Tar Mar *waves to Nystul*  because I never really got to <br/>\nplay with my friends there and the extra time in real life came in handy :)  <br/>\nBut now that it seems more and more folks are thinkin about a guild, I&#39;ll <br/>\ncome on back in :)  Being waay back in the closet in real life this will <br/>\ngive me a chance to hang out with actual gay folks.  I don&#39;t even associate <br/>\nwith any in real life :(.  This time around I think I&#39;ll do less power <br/>\nleveling and more socializin&#39;  If others are congregating on a particular <br/>\nserver, post here to let us all know.  Take care! *hugz*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
