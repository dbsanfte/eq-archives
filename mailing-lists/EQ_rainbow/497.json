I&#39;m not sure whether it is<br/>\n&gt;factually true that high level players can&#39;t camp jboots any more, or<br/>\n&gt;whether that is just a rumor.  It isn&#39;t hard to imagine a high level<br/>\n&gt;character killing drelzna 10 times in a row, not getting boots, getting<br/>\n&gt;the note, and thus concluding that it was impossible for them to get boots<br/>\n&gt;any more (when they were really just unlucky).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m a little suspicious that there is a level cap on who can get jboots<br/>\n&gt;because that would be a totally new kind of approach to camping.  Until<br/>\n&gt;now what a creature drops has not been affected by who kills it.  The fact<br/>\n&gt;that creatures sometimes use items that they carry suggests that what a<br/>\n&gt;creature carries is generated at spawn time, and not at time of death.  If<br/>\n&gt;that is the case it would be difficult (though not impossible) to at time<br/>\n&gt;of death change what the creature drops.  I&#39;m a computer programmer, I<br/>\n&gt;tend to look at things from the perspective of &quot;how hard would that be for<br/>\n&gt;me to do&quot;.  Programmers are lazy, they prefer easy fixes over hard ones.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m not saying it isn&#39;t true, just that I&#39;m not convinced as of yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Christina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Mon, 27 Sep 1999, Jerry Luttrell wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jerry Luttrell&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tinarin@...\">tinarin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; They are on drelzna for low lvl players, and if yer above a certain lvl <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get a letter instead telling you to goto rathe mtns...
