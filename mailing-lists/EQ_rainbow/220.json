We all seem to put a little here and there about<br/>\nwhat we play, what server we&#39;re on, etc. and we all want to get together<br/>\nwith someone else on the same server. Well, if you send me the following<br/>\ninfo I will make a LIST of us ALL and post it to our list. Include the<br/>\nFOLLOWING Info please...<br/>\n<br/>\nNormal Entry Info:<br/>\nCharacter/s Name<br/>\nLevel/s<br/>\nCharacter/s Gender<br/>\nClass/s<br/>\nRace/s<br/>\nServer/s you are on<br/>\n<br/>\nOptional:<br/>\nReal Name<br/>\nEmail Address<br/>\n<br/>\n     With this info I think we can better coordinate our efforts to meet up<br/>\nwith everyone. If you want you can either post it on EQ Rainbow or you can<br/>\nemail me at home at :  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sandymann@...\">sandymann@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps unravel the confusion of who&#39;s where and on what server!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy ( Kalell)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
