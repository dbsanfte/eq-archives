I like it because it&#39;s incredibly arrogant, with<br/>\nthe implication being that being GLBT or queer-positive makes you better<br/>\nthan if you&#39;re not.  Well lets face it...doesn&#39;t it???? =) I&#39;m suggesting<br/>\n&quot;The Chosen&quot; because &quot;We Rock&quot; doesn&#39;t sound that medieval, but lets face<br/>\nit...we rock!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about &quot;Norath United&quot;? I think it presents a pretty clear strong<br/>\nconcept.  On the downside it sounds a bit boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about &quot;We Are Everywhere&quot;.  I like it because it sends the positive<br/>\nmessage that GLBT people are everywhere.  It also has mysterious overtones<br/>\nthat I think make it cool in a standalone way.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
