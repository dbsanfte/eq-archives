The wedding will take place on the Sisters of<br/>\nErollisi island.  It will be a fully catered event! All list members are<br/>\nwelcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way to get to the island is to take the boat from freeport.  You<br/>\nshould allot 15 minutes for boat travel.  If you&#39;re coming from Faydwer,<br/>\nI recommend you just wait for the boat to start coming back, rather than<br/>\njumping ship and trying to swim.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are of an evil race, you can still attend, as festivities will be held<br/>\na safe distance from the good NPCs on the island.  Please don&#39;t kill the<br/>\nErollisi sisters.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
