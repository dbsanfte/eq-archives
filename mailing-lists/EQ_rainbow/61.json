We need unification..yes..I looked that word up just<br/>\nfor this occasion! Lets start by saying what server we are all currently<br/>\non, which character we play the MOST and go from there. The ONLY problem I<br/>\nsee is that we may have to play our favorite character half time while we<br/>\nplay our &#39;GUILD&#39; character the other half. SHAME we cant transfer<br/>\ncharacters from server to server..sigh. Give me some feedbaack FOLKS! HUGS!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
