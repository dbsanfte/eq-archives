There are <br/>\nquite a few of us there so it&#39;s a pity we failed to hook up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guild has not folded.  Oh no!  In fact, it has not officially <br/>\nmade it out of the starting gate yet.  We&#39;re still trying to get 10 <br/>\npeople on at the same time in the same zone (it&#39;s like herding <br/>\ncats!) - we came very close last week but this week we will succeed!  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn Monday June 18th between 6 and 7pm Pacific Time we will be in <br/>\nButcherblock outside Kaladim where WOLFVEN, our Fearless Guild <br/>\nLeader, will invite us into the guild and do all the official guild <br/>\nset-up stuff with an EQ GM.  Anyone who wants to help out could just <br/>\ncreate a dwarf character on The Nameless that evening and come to the <br/>\ngates at Kaladim.  That will ensure that we get the right number of <br/>\npeople to get going.  We will be most appreciative and you&#39;ll have <br/>\nhelped create a new gay guild. Yay!<br/>\n<br/>\nOur guild will be based on welcoming gay people to a safe, friendly, <br/>\nand fun place to play EverQuest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of us have characters on other servers and we&#39;re all conflicted <br/>\nabout leaving behind high levels characters, plat and goodies but <br/>\nfrom our experiences grouping together so far on The Nameless I&#39;d <br/>\nhave to say it has been totally worthwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope to see all of y&#39;all this Monday.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re on The Nameless send a tell to just say hi to me at:<br/>\n<br/>\nDandee Lyon (wood elf druid)<br/>\nDarshe Blows (half elf rogue)<br/>\nPoppie Power (gnome wizzie)<br/>\n<br/>\nBest to all,<br/>\n<br/>\nDandee, Darshe, and Poppie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EQ_rainbow@y..., &quot;Rob Ruger&quot; &lt;aethercub@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; What happened to Nameless Love?
