However, the size of the guild there (I&#39;ve catalogued 16 or more<br/>\nmembers by typing /w all mystical) and the fact that many are on simultaneously<br/>\nmakes me think that it is being run as just a regular guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there is no way to read the charter anywhere. Once it goes to Verant,<br/>\nthey&#39;re the only ones who see it. I suspect this Tarisimo just saw our guild<br/>\nname on the approved list, liked the name, and noticed that no one on his server<br/>\nwas a member. I think he then concocted some story to get the GM to set up the<br/>\ntags for him. Of all the ones to pick, he just happened to pick an LGBT one,<br/>\nunbeknownst to him. I actually think it is kinda funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I see him online, I am tempted to do a tell to him and tell him I saw their<br/>\nweb site, and am very supportive of gay people and wish his guild luck<br/>\n(pretending I&#39;m straight of course.) He may decide to delete the thing himself<br/>\nif I do that. If I do it, I&#39;ll be sure to /log first to record everything for<br/>\nyou all to see.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am having trouble meeting up with the GM to get this fixed. Were I only on the<br/>\nwest coast... I /petitioned and had to go to bed at 11pm eastern. I left my<br/>\ncharacter logged in and at some point, the GM did try to talk to me. I will<br/>\nprobably try to just do a /tell tonight and ask if I can avoid doing another<br/>\npetition since I&#39;ve been in the queue for a total of 15 hours or more so far.<br/>\nI&#39;ll let everyone know if I am successful.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Saturday and Sunday, I will be playing off and on throughout the day. So, if<br/>\nyou are on another server and you see a GM online, come on over to Brell Serilis<br/>\nand give my Dedric character a tell and I&#39;ll see if I can rush on over and<br/>\n/petition on your server to get the tags set up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also planning to work on a web site this weekend. I will probably not have<br/>\nany graphics in the first version, but want to get the charter and other vital<br/>\ninfo. up first, then the artists among us can submit images.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs to all,<br/>\nDavid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
