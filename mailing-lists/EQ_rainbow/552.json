There are many reasons for my decision, some<br/>\n&gt; related to the game and some related to real life, but they have all added<br/>\n&gt; up to make me decide it is time to leave the game. I&#39;ve not played now for<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; couple of weeks and have not suffered any withdrawal symptoms, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are several implications to my decision that affect the Mystic<br/>\n&gt; Alliance guild. First, if you are trying to get the guild going on other<br/>\n&gt; servers, please /petition the GMs and ask to get the guild set up as soon<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; possible so that I can help you if it should be necessary.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Second, I would like to send a message to the Verant person in charge of<br/>\n&gt; guilds to have someone else made the guild owner of record. This means I<br/>\n&gt; need a volunteer. If we get no volunteers, it may make things difficult<br/>\n&gt; setting up more chapters of the guild later.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Third, I need a person to be the guild master on Brell Serilis. Any<br/>\ntakers?<br/>\n&gt; We need to reform the  guild on that server anyway to get the correct guil<br/>\nd<br/>\n&gt; name.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lastly, my two main Brell characters have some pretty good equipment and<br/>\n&gt; cash that I would love to give to members of the guild. My level 21<br/>\n&gt; necromancer, Dedric has full raw silk armor, RTS, Dagger of Marnek (sp?),<br/>\n&gt; lots of containers, some level 16 and 20 spell scrolls, other misc. items<br/>\n&gt; and over 100 PP in cash. I also have a lvl 4 warrior named Rainbow who has<br/>\n&gt; partial rawhide armor, some nice FS weapons, a mino axe and some other<br/>\nmisc.<br/>\n&gt; items, plus a little cash. (Note, that the highly coveted name of Rainbow<br/>\n&gt; will also become available, so let me know if you are interested in making<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; new character with that name).  I would love to give all my stuff to my<br/>\n&gt; guildmates, so let me know if any of you are interested. If anyone wanted<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; start a necro on Brell, now would be the time ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Finally, I would like to say that being a part of this mailing list has<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n&gt; a lot of fun and has enriched my life and my game-playing experience too.<br/>\n&gt; While the list has been fairly quite lately and I have the feeling that<br/>\nsome<br/>\n&gt; of my friends may have left the list, I plan to continue to stay on the<br/>\nlist<br/>\n&gt; just to hear how things are going with all of you. You&#39;re a fun bunch and<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; do really care about you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hugs to all,<br/>\n&gt; David<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
