Force of Synergy anyone ahhahahahah! :)   BUT SERIOUSLY, we<br/>\nshould let David handle this, and he can work it out with Verant, they need<br/>\nto get their act together, and start helping us out a bit.  Unfortunatly I<br/>\nthink many of the poeple wqe deal with are young poeple who may not have the<br/>\nemotional security or maturity to deal with gay poeple, or the fact that<br/>\nthere was a guild mistake, so we are going to end up having to defend<br/>\nourselves from all fronts...such is life...BTW:  check out Teen People, Rob<br/>\nand I are in it, page 156, not that i memorized it or anything :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, thanks everyoinbe for your kind words and support reguardsing<br/>\nthe harassment, I have alkreayd e-mail Veranty, though i got an automated<br/>\nreply from tech-support, even though i didint send it to tech, whatver i am<br/>\nsure they will figure it out, i am giving them till next tuesday to reply<br/>\npersonally then i will call them, I&#39;m not lwetting this drop because it was<br/>\nVERY VERY bad, and extremely upsetting, but there is no way in hell i am<br/>\ngiving up Rodcet nife, my chatchter or this cool game for some idiot.

They were nonresponsive..probably AFK. They ran off and I<br/>\n&gt; continued to try and say Hi to them and they ignored me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) Talked to a Tigerhawk Wensday morning. VERY nice person. I asked him<br/>\n&gt; about the guild and he told me he knew it was a<br/>\n&gt; Gay/Bi/Lesbian/Transgendered etc. guild and loved the idea.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3) Wensday afternoon I spoke with the Guild leader (Tarismo), and it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; David, and he was very upset that &#39;we&#39; were trying to take HIS guild away<br/>\n&gt; from him. He told me it was DEFINATELY NOT based on what we had intended<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; a guild, even though Tigerhawk said differently. He said that HE was first<br/>\n&gt; and he would NOT allow ANYONE to take the guild away from him. I told him<br/>\n&gt; that there must be a mix up and he should contact Verant to clear it up.<br/>\nHe<br/>\n&gt; exploded on me about that. I told him he should talk to a GM and not yell<br/>\n&gt; at me because I had no power. After this he refused to reply to any tells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4) I petitioned a junior GM and told them about the guild mixup etc. and<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; promised to esculate it to the powers that be. I thanked him and went<br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; my gaming.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 5) At 11:45 pm I was getting ready to log after a lot of fun at Lake<br/>\nRather<br/>\n&gt; when I got a tell from one of their members accusing me of starting<br/>\nrumors.<br/>\n&gt; He was VERY mean and would not listen to reason. I explained what had<br/>\n&gt; happened and why the confusion but he then became more abusive. After a<br/>\n&gt; minute or so, several other of their guild started sending really<br/>\nmean..and<br/>\n&gt; I DO mean EVIL tells to me about this. I told them to let Verant/GMs take<br/>\n&gt; it from here but they verbally assaulted over and over. I eventually<br/>\ncalmed<br/>\n&gt; them down and logged for the night.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Man...this is crazy. I don&#39;t KNOW what&#39;s happened but I think David<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; right that we may have to delete the guild and start over again. Though<br/>\n&gt; with people like I met last night, I think it will be rather rough trying<br/>\n&gt; to parley with them about this mix up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
