I know a lot of <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;have high level characters on your current servers and I can understand <br/>\n&gt;your not<br/>\n&gt;wanting to leave. But many of you have lower level characters and you are <br/>\n&gt;the ones<br/>\n&gt;I want to invite over to Brell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I gave up my level 13 cleric to make the move and I know what it is like to <br/>\n&gt;start<br/>\n&gt;over, so I have a special offer. If you want to make the move, let me know <br/>\n&gt;and I<br/>\n&gt;will do the following:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;o I will help equip your character. Once you figure out a class and race, I <br/>\n&gt;will<br/>\n&gt;work to get you some equipment that would be suitable for a character below <br/>\n&gt;level<br/>\n&gt;10. I will help get cloth for casters, and rawhide and patchwork for melee <br/>\n&gt;types<br/>\n&gt;and weapons too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;o I will help you power level. My lvl 17 necro has a healing spell that <br/>\n&gt;takes HP<br/>\n&gt;away from me and gives them to you. I can keep you healed up. Also, once <br/>\n&gt;you kill<br/>\n&gt;a creature down below half, I will help you finish it off. You will get the <br/>\n&gt;XP and<br/>\n&gt;loot. This should really keep your downtime to a minimum.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In just a few hours, we can have you up to level 5 or more. While I can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;speak<br/>\n&gt;for other guild members on Brell, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of them <br/>\n&gt;might be<br/>\n&gt;able to help you level and give you some &#39;hand me down&#39; equipment as well. <br/>\n&gt;And<br/>\n&gt;depending on your level, you might also be able to group with various of <br/>\n&gt;our<br/>\n&gt;members as we have characters in many different levels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, if you are lonely on your existing server and don&#39;t have too high a <br/>\n&gt;character,<br/>\n&gt;please come on over to Brell and at least give it a try.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hugs,<br/>\n&gt;David<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
