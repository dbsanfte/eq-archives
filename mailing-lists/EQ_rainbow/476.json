I know a lot of you<br/>\nhave high level characters on your current servers and I can understand your not<br/>\nwanting to leave. But many of you have lower level characters and you are the ones<br/>\nI want to invite over to Brell.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gave up my level 13 cleric to make the move and I know what it is like to start<br/>\nover, so I have a special offer. If you want to make the move, let me know and I<br/>\nwill do the following:<br/>\n<br/>\no I will help equip your character. Once you figure out a class and race, I will<br/>\nwork to get you some equipment that would be suitable for a character below level<br/>\n10. I will help get cloth for casters, and rawhide and patchwork for melee types<br/>\nand weapons too.<br/>\n<br/>\no I will help you power level. My lvl 17 necro has a healing spell that takes HP<br/>\naway from me and gives them to you. I can keep you healed up. Also, once you kill<br/>\na creature down below half, I will help you finish it off. You will get the XP and<br/>\nloot. This should really keep your downtime to a minimum.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn just a few hours, we can have you up to level 5 or more. While I can&#39;t speak<br/>\nfor other guild members on Brell, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of them might be<br/>\nable to help you level and give you some &#39;hand me down&#39; equipment as well. And<br/>\ndepending on your level, you might also be able to group with various of our<br/>\nmembers as we have characters in many different levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you are lonely on your existing server and don&#39;t have too high a character,<br/>\nplease come on over to Brell and at least give it a try.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\nDavid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
