I myself was <br/>\nrecently witness to a barrage of &quot;faggot&quot; comments here on Rodcet.  All I <br/>\ndo now is report and petition.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo however consider coming on over to the Mystic Alliance on Rodcet.  I was <br/>\nwary at first too (having a 15th level Shadowknight, which to me then was <br/>\nthe be-all-to-end-all of leveling) because of my hard work, but after <br/>\nswitching and joining up, I realized how much fun it can be to have a whole <br/>\nguild of gay and gay friendly people to play with ... plus we have guild <br/>\nevents and players which will both help you reach your former level in no <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nI completely understand if you still don&#39;t want to switch, but trust me, it <br/>\ncould really be worth your time to at least create a character over here <br/>\nand check us out.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Chris<br/>\nVargyr Calusczinelor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:16 AM 12/23/00 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Thanks to everyone who responded to my posting. I&#39;m sad to see that<br/>\n&gt;there are, apparently, so few gay/lesbian players on Brell; or at<br/>\n&gt;least who are also a member of this eGroup.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My friends and I *don&#39;t* want to change servers, so we are<br/>\n&gt;considering starting our own gay/lesbian guild on Brell. The problem<br/>\n&gt;is, there aren&#39;t enough of us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I know the process for starting a guild. My qustion is, for those of<br/>\n&gt;you involved in Nameless Love or Mystic Alliance, how did you get 10<br/>\n&gt;people? Did you advertise in general (such as in a forum) or did you<br/>\n&gt;just happen to know 10 other gay/lesbian EQ players, or, well... how<br/>\n&gt;did it come together.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Considering what I&#39;m finding to be a generally gay-intolerant<br/>\n&gt;attitude on EQ, I hesitate to start a forum thread about a new gay<br/>\n&gt;guild or sit around on the chat server hoping 9 other gay people show<br/>\n&gt;up who want to start a guild.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m 33. I started RPG-ing in 1980 with D&D and Gamma World. I was<br/>\n&gt;away from RPG&#39;s for many years and even now EQ is my only RPG outlet.<br/>\n&gt;I played Magic: The Gathering for a while but it simply became too<br/>\n&gt;frickin expensive and, to me, pointless. When? When did the<br/>\n&gt;word &quot;gay&quot; become -- in the gaming crowd (which now seems to be made<br/>\n&gt;up of teeming hordes of 13 yr old boys with a lot of their parents&#39;<br/>\n&gt;money and No Clue) -- synonymous<br/>\n&gt;with &quot;lame&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;useless&quot;, &quot;weak&quot; and just about any and every<br/>\n&gt;other negative adjective?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I spent 15 minutes in Oasis of Marr the other day riding the virtual<br/>\n&gt;ass of some lame k3wl d00d because he made the /shout &quot;Somebody come<br/>\n&gt;kill this gay SG please!&quot; I proceeded to riddle him with questions,<br/>\n&gt;in /shout, such as &quot;How do you know he is gay?&quot; &quot;Does he mince when<br/>\n&gt;he walks?&quot; &quot;Is his name in lavender or pink over his head?&quot; &quot;Is his<br/>\n&gt;name Bruce?&quot; &quot;Is he listening to the Village People?&quot; Etc., etc.<br/>\n&gt;While my very tongue in cheek and often virulent replies ilicited<br/>\n&gt;some laughs, several people /shout-ed back stuff like &quot;eww&quot;<br/>\n&gt;and &quot;that&#39;s gross&quot;. Mainly because initially the player&#39;s response to<br/>\n&gt;me was &quot;Because he&#39;ll rip you a new asshole&quot;. My response to that<br/>\n&gt;was &quot;Well my boss does that and I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s a breeder&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was under the impression that tolerance was on the upswing, in<br/>\n&gt;general anyway. It seems like on EQ that isn&#39;t the case. Is this<br/>\n&gt;server specific or do any of the rest of you have problems with this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Owen<br/>\n&gt;Grackk 16th lvl Ogre Shadowknight<br/>\n&gt;Talsen 9th level Barbarian Shaman<br/>\n&gt;Brell Serilis server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
