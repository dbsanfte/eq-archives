Dedric now has &lt;Mystical<br/>\nAlliance&gt; floating over his head.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, we have volunteers to be guildmasters on the following servers.<br/>\nE&#39;ci, Bristlebane, Rodcet Nife, Erollisi Marr and Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\nI will try to get as many of these set up on those servers as I can on Aug. 15th<br/>\nwhen I return from my vacation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, Christina has created a character on Brell named Ranebow who is<br/>\nan officer in the guild and can get others into the guild on that server. Contact<br/>\nher in game via her Luna character.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, for those of you who have not heard, one of the most exciting things to<br/>\never happen in the world of Norrath is a big mystery sequence of events involving<br/>\n10 slaughtered Paladins in Freeport. This is a GM run event/quest. Check out the<br/>\nnews groups, etc. for more info. If you needed another reason to move to Brell,<br/>\nthis is it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\nDavid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
