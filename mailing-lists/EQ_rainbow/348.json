Pick a number from 2 to 9.  It can be 2 or it can be <br/>\n     9, or any number in between.<br/>\n <br/>\n2.  Take that number that you&#39;ve chosen, and multipy it by 9.<br/>\n <br/>\n3.  That should give you a two digit number.  Take those two<br/>\n     digits and add them together.<br/>\n <br/>\n4.  Take the resulting number and subtract 5 from it.<br/>\n <br/>\n5.  take that number and correspond it to the alphabet,<br/>\n     numbering the letters,  A=1,B=2,C=3, and so on.<br/>\n <br/>\n6.  Take your letter, and think of a country that begins with<br/>\n     letter.<br/>\n <br/>\n7.  Take the last letter in the name of that country,<br/>\n     and think of an animal.<br/>\n <br/>\n8.  Now, take the last letter in the name of that animal,<br/>\n     and think of a color.<br/>\n <br/>\n9.  But always remember, that there are no orange<br/>\n     kangaroos in Denmark!!!<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nSCAREY HUH???   haha</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
