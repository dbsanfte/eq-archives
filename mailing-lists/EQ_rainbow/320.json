The FBR is easy compaired to the boots. Najena almost always <br/>\nspawns with it. However she doent alwasy spawn. Sometimes a Elmental spawns <br/>\nin her place, and no there is no such thing as Anticamping code. When me and <br/>\nMy group whent for the robes we tested it out. She spawned just as many times <br/>\nwhen we were on the other side of the water as she did when we were camping <br/>\nat her doorstep. That anicamping is a legioned not based on facts. Caused <br/>\nbecause some Npc&#39;s dont always spawn in fact they spawn randomly. so people <br/>\nstarted camping on the other side and poof she disided to show up that <br/>\ntime... and thus the legioned was born.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
