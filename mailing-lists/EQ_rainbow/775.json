My new<br/>\n&gt; High Elf Cleric, Kythwin began his existence in that hellhole of a zone<br/>\n&gt; known as the Greater Faydark (dark, no loot, too many people and all<br/>\n&gt; that infernal shouting!). After a couple of hours, I had him up to 3rd<br/>\n&gt; level and it was off to Freeport, a place I find much more congenial. I<br/>\n&gt; guess you could say that Kyth is like most gay men, began life in<br/>\n&gt; someplace dim and depressing but took off at the first opportunity for<br/>\n&gt; the big bright city!! Now I hope to make contact with someone from<br/>\n&gt; Mystic Alliance and join up as soon as possible...I will be keeping my<br/>\n&gt; eyes open as I bash those ugly orcs over the head and hope to see<br/>\n&gt; someone soon.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Vince<br/>\n&gt; Kythwin, Cleric of the Tunare, 3rd Circle<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
