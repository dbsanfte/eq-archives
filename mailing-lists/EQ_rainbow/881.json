Sam <br/>\nstopped by Lanys last night, and we had a blast with him. I encourage <br/>\neveryone to get involved in the guilds on other servers, if not to <br/>\nplay hardcore, necessarily, but just to meet the nice people on <br/>\nRodcet and Nameless AND Lanys. Alex (Rugen) and I had a blast on <br/>\nNameless helping Souldreamer get their guild underway, and, as a <br/>\nresult, I&#39;m encouraging the Ordo to visit the other servers so we all <br/>\nget to know each other a bit more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe even-handed way that the other guilds have treated new EQ&#39;ers is <br/>\nto be commended - it&#39;s nice to see that we three guilds (and more are <br/>\nout there, from what I&#39;ve heard) don&#39;t feel the need to compete for <br/>\nnewbies, rather we can help new folks find a place they will feel <br/>\ncomfortable in a fun game. My hats off to Mystic and Nameless Love!<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wanted to let everyone know that Ordo has a website at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ordo.darke.net\">http://ordo.darke.net</a> with ezBoards open to the public for posting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best!<br/>\nJack Cole<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:october31@...\">october31@...</a><br/>\nHraska Bloodaxe<br/>\nHabrell Oakencrown<br/>\nHammond<br/>\nJKRadklif, Cleric of the Porn Squad</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
