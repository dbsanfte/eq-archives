I&#39;m sad to see that <br/>\nthere are, apparently, so few gay/lesbian players on Brell; or at <br/>\nleast who are also a member of this eGroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friends and I *don&#39;t* want to change servers, so we are <br/>\nconsidering starting our own gay/lesbian guild on Brell. The problem <br/>\nis, there aren&#39;t enough of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the process for starting a guild. My qustion is, for those of <br/>\nyou involved in Nameless Love or Mystic Alliance, how did you get 10 <br/>\npeople? Did you advertise in general (such as in a forum) or did you <br/>\njust happen to know 10 other gay/lesbian EQ players, or, well... how <br/>\ndid it come together.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsidering what I&#39;m finding to be a generally gay-intolerant <br/>\nattitude on EQ, I hesitate to start a forum thread about a new gay <br/>\nguild or sit around on the chat server hoping 9 other gay people show <br/>\nup who want to start a guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m 33. I started RPG-ing in 1980 with D&D and Gamma World. I was <br/>\naway from RPG&#39;s for many years and even now EQ is my only RPG outlet. <br/>\nI played Magic: The Gathering for a while but it simply became too <br/>\nfrickin expensive and, to me, pointless. When? When did the <br/>\nword &quot;gay&quot; become -- in the gaming crowd (which now seems to be made <br/>\nup of teeming hordes of 13 yr old boys with a lot of their parents&#39; <br/>\nmoney and No Clue) -- synonymous <br/>\nwith &quot;lame&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;useless&quot;, &quot;weak&quot; and just about any and every <br/>\nother negative adjective?<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent 15 minutes in Oasis of Marr the other day riding the virtual <br/>\nass of some lame k3wl d00d because he made the /shout &quot;Somebody come <br/>\nkill this gay SG please!&quot; I proceeded to riddle him with questions, <br/>\nin /shout, such as &quot;How do you know he is gay?&quot; &quot;Does he mince when <br/>\nhe walks?&quot; &quot;Is his name in lavender or pink over his head?&quot; &quot;Is his <br/>\nname Bruce?&quot; &quot;Is he listening to the Village People?&quot; Etc., etc. <br/>\nWhile my very tongue in cheek and often virulent replies ilicited <br/>\nsome laughs, several people /shout-ed back stuff like &quot;eww&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;that&#39;s gross&quot;. Mainly because initially the player&#39;s response to <br/>\nme was &quot;Because he&#39;ll rip you a new asshole&quot;. My response to that <br/>\nwas &quot;Well my boss does that and I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s a breeder&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was under the impression that tolerance was on the upswing, in <br/>\ngeneral anyway. It seems like on EQ that isn&#39;t the case. Is this <br/>\nserver specific or do any of the rest of you have problems with this? <br/>\n<br/>\nOwen<br/>\nGrackk 16th lvl Ogre Shadowknight<br/>\nTalsen 9th level Barbarian Shaman<br/>\nBrell Serilis server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
