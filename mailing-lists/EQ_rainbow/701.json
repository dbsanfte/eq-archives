It was called MegaPlat and<br/>\n&gt; consisted of a lottery (the grand prize was 665 plat) and raffles of<br/>\nvarious<br/>\n&gt; items (armor, jewelry, weapons, etc.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We had around 20 guild members on at the same time and that set a record<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; us, I believe. A lot of people have been moving over to the Rodcet server<br/>\n&gt; and this event was a great way for them to get some nice equipment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joe and Rob did a great job of coordinating and running the event. Thanks<br/>\n&gt; guys.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If anyone else wants to create characters on Rodcet, we invite you to come<br/>\n&gt; join us. We&#39;ll be happy to help you out as you start new characters. We&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; quickly making Rodcet the San Francisco of Norrath and you are welcome to<br/>\n&gt; join the fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David<br/>\n&gt; Kerik, Wood Elf Druid<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get LOW Rates.
