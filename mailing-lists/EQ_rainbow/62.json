We need unification..yes..I looked that word up just<br/>\n&gt;for this occasion! Lets start by saying what server we are all currently<br/>\n&gt;on, which character we play the MOST and go from there. The ONLY problem I<br/>\n&gt;see is that we may have to play our favorite character half time while we<br/>\n&gt;play our &#39;GUILD&#39; character the other half. SHAME we cant transfer<br/>\n&gt;characters from server to server..sigh. Give me some feedbaack FOLKS!
