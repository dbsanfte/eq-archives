We have a gay guild on Rodcet<br/>\nNife.  If you ever think about switching servers come join up with us  =)<br/>\nWe have people who would powerlevel your characters up to where you are<br/>\nnow.  We have a few bears in our guild (including my lover) and are<br/>\naccepting of everyone as long as they accept us (even breeders =P).  The<br/>\nguild is more centered around the game than it is our sexuality.  The guild<br/>\nis a place where we can play free of harassment and when people do harass us<br/>\nwe have the rest of the guild to back us up.  We are over 50 strong now in<br/>\nthe Mystic Alliance.  There is also a bear specific guild on the Lanys T&#39;Vyl<br/>\nserver.  I just recently created a character there and joined them but they<br/>\nare a smaller guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndy Cottrell<br/>\nTaren Despottrell<br/>\nMystic Alliance Guildleader<br/>\n41st Barbarian Shaman<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have a website.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mysticalliance.im1ru12.org\">http://mysticalliance.im1ru12.org</a>  If you want a<br/>\nmember account email me and I&#39;ll set it up.
