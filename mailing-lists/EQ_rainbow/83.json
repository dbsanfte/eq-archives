I was a bit nervous how that would turn out ... thanks all!  Guys<br/>\nand the gals who turned up after my post! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs promised, here&#39;s what I play and where, as well as a one-liner on thier<br/>\npersonalities (since I do RP them, you&#39;ll know what to expect out of the IC<br/>\ncharacter), and thier best role in a party.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Erollisi:<br/>\nHONESTY /Half-Elf Paladin/Mithaniel Marr/Freeport/L5<br/>\n My Joan of Arcish truth, honesty justice, &quot;Truth is not Kind&quot;.  Great tank<br/>\nand loves the job.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTARLING /Wood Elf Bard/Bristebane/Freeport/L7<br/>\n The drunken party Bard! Master brewer, should always some brew on her.<br/>\nBetter support Bard than tank, but has good armor and can tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Brell: ( all are L2-3 ... maybe 1 or 2 at 4th by late tonight)    <br/>\n<br/>\nBOMBOM /Ogress Warrior/Rallos Zek/Ogguk<br/>\n  Not evil, just HUNGRY!  Big girl needs a lot of food.  She would work in<br/>\na good group as long as someone could shout &quot;Bombom NOT food!&quot; when she<br/>\nstarted drooling at the halflings ;P  She&#39;s also a female chauvanist.  I&#39;m<br/>\nexperimenting with my aggressive part here, and love it :)  Tank supreme.<br/>\n<br/>\nDECEIT /Dark Elf Enchanter/Agnostic/Neriak<br/>\n  Mistress of Illusion.  Neutral to Evil.  Conquering the world through<br/>\nhate is a waste of energy when you can charm them into your slaves.<br/>\nBuff/debuff mage suport.<br/>\n<br/>\nMELODIE /Human Bard/Quellios/Qeynos<br/>\n  Lore and exploration specialist, fighting Bard.  Good to Neutral.  Spare<br/>\nTank and buffs and utility songs, mild healing by 6th.<br/>\n<br/>\nSHADE /Dark Elf Necromancer/Innoruuk/Neriak<br/>\n  Death and destruction for Innoruuk! (my bad girl) ;), Evil, won&#39;t fit in<br/>\na good group. Magical damage and some healing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSHIRI /Erudian Wizard/Solusek Ro/Erudin<br/>\n  Seeker of arcane knowlege and power with the dignity and serenity of an<br/>\nAfrican Queen.  Good to neutral.  Magic Firepower supreme.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTORMI /Human Magician/Karana/Qeynos<br/>\n  A generous helper of any who need help.  Good.  Charity and helping<br/>\nothers are good.  Magical firepower and utility item support.<br/>\n<br/>\nANNWAN /Human Monk/Quellious/Freeport<br/>\n  From the Chinese An - nuan, peaceful woman, warm and generous.  Good,<br/>\nkind, and subservient female.  Tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nBombom my daughter helps with and we have a blast :)  Annwan will be a<br/>\nstretch for me ... I&#39;m *anything* but a subservient woman in real life.<br/>\nShould be interesting to try that role. :P<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an open slot too.  Feel free to say hello and group if you see any<br/>\nof them :)  Or if you just want to round out a group with one of the above<br/>\nclasses, send a tell.  Under L10, I can travel Erudin-Qeynos-Karanas-Halas<br/>\nor Freeport-Faydark-Riverdale-Ro-Innothule.  Melodie and Deceit will<br/>\nprobably be able to go anywhere by L6 and L4 respectively .. so maybe even<br/>\nthis weekend those two could go to anywhere on request.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGuild or no guild, I&#39;m around and since this group is part of my normal<br/>\nlife ... you know you can be yourselves if I&#39;m in an EQ group.  I&#39;m all for<br/>\nany guild that&#39;s anti-harassment (IMHO we&#39;ve got more than enough of that<br/>\nin the real world).  As per Christina&#39;s post I wouldn&#39;t be a good person to<br/>\nrun a guild, and will defer to the sensitivities of the GBLT&#39;s here on any<br/>\nname.  But I can be involved and offer moral support as needed :)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lora, chat handle Hechicera in EQ chats</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
