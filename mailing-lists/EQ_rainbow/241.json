First, let me introduce some of you to the wonders of TRACERT ! With<br/>\nthis handy dandy little utility you can see if any of the places we all<br/>\nhave to bounce around on while trying to get on Everquest is up or<br/>\nSERIOUSLY laggy! Tracert is already on your machine (If you have windows<br/>\n3.1/95/98 ). Open a DOS window while still in Windows and do this:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Once in the dos window you will see    C:&#92;WINDOWS|<br/>\n2)  Type    cd&#92;  and press enter<br/>\n3)  Now type TRACERT and then one of the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n     208.236.12.25   (This is the E&#39;ci server, but doesnt matter even if<br/>\nyou are Brell )<br/>\n     or<br/>\n     chat.everquest.com  then hit enter (Got these address from EQ)<br/>\n<br/>\n4)  After hitting enter, pay attention to the numbers that appear below.<br/>\nThis info tells you HOW MANY places you are bouncing around in to just get<br/>\nto Everquest. Also, you will see numbers like   15ms or 17ms. This is the<br/>\ntime in MILLISECONDS it is taking to go from one NODE (bounce )to another.<br/>\nIF you ever get an area that says: &quot;REQUEST TIMED OUT&quot;   then one of the<br/>\nplaces you are bouncing to is down or just SO slow it doesnt carry a signal<br/>\nfast enough to keep your computer from just dropping the whole connect<br/>\nattempt.<br/>\n<br/>\n     I hope this helps you all out! It does me! Let&#39;s me know if I need to<br/>\nYELL at my ISP or EQ!<br/>\nTake care all!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy Collier  (Kalell)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
