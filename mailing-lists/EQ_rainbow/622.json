Also note the name of the person and the time the incident<br/>\nhappened.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen petition immediately, petition &quot;I was harassed by [name] and I have<br/>\nlogged the harassment&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you speak with a guide, say you want to speak with a server GM about<br/>\nit.  Only a server GM can review the logs.  Guides have to witness<br/>\nharassment to be able to do anything.  Server GMs are not always on so you<br/>\nmay have to be patient and persistant over several days.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you speak witha  GM you want to say something like &quot;On [date] at<br/>\n[time] I was harassed by [name] who made homophobic and insulting comments<br/>\nto me.  I logged the harassment with report.  This kind of action must<br/>\nnot be tollerated in Everquest, and I would like your assurances that you<br/>\nwill find review my report, find this person, and speak with them so they<br/>\nknow that homophobic harassment is not allowed in Everquest.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM must then find the person when they are online in order to speak<br/>\nwith them.  You can aid this by putting the person in your friends list,<br/>\nand petitioning whenever they are online, continue to petition in this<br/>\nfashion until the GM tells you &quot;I have reviewed your report and spoken<br/>\nwith this person.&quot;  Persistance is key! GMs generally act on petitions,<br/>\nand they will not seek out people unless they are online, and they don&#39;t<br/>\ngenerally look for people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Tina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 25 Apr 2000, Joseph Normandin wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Heya!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; didint get my CD yet but i am getting really excited.

I was in a group in<br/>\n&gt; infected paw and my boyfreind was in another group in the same zone.  One<br/>\n&gt; of my group members kepot going near their &quot;camp&quot; and so Rob (my bf) asked<br/>\n&gt; me to telkl him not to, which i did.  he then said &quot;who said that?  I will<br/>\n&gt; kill him hehehe&quot; just joking and all, and i said &quot;well it was my love who<br/>\n&gt; said it so if you killed him i would ahve to kill you, and shoot a frosy<br/>\n&gt; bolt up your ictchy arse&quot; (as i am a wizard and heois a troll)  then he<br/>\n&gt; said &quot;YOUR LOVE IS A MAN&quot; and i said &quot;yes i am gay, deal&quot; and he procceded<br/>\n&gt; to say &quot;i ahve been grouped side by side witha  fag!&quot;  and then disbanded<br/>\n&gt; and shouted &quot;I;m surrounded by freaks&quot;  needless to say he was repoirted,<br/>\n&gt; but i dont tihnk a GM was on...maybe our little guide friend can look into<br/>\n&gt; this....his name was Slamuk...no pressure, and i didint even suggest that<br/>\n&gt; :)   Luckily the other poeple in the group were great and thought he was<br/>\n&gt; stupd and our replacement tank asked why our last one ran aorund screeming<br/>\n&gt; and we told him and he was pissed and thought it was absurd...so that was<br/>\n&gt; cool<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; have fun in kunark!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -joe<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Tue, 25 Apr 2000, Christina Norman wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ok, this might just be a rant, but since it&#39;s non hostile I&#39;m going to post it here =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; WOW Iksar are so cute.  The first time I ever saw one I was like...oh my gosh! It walks around and swings its little tail and talks and everything! It&#39;s like the best pet!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; And Kunark is very pretty.  Lots of fun new zones, with cool looking critters.  It&#39;s pretty obvious to me you could hunt in Kunark and never leave, and get all the way to 50.  It seems a self sufficient continent.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kunark is dangerous though, I have talked to a lot of people who brought their mains over and got stomped by something.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The solution to all this is...make an Iksar shaman! You get SOW at 9th level and you can explore like crazy.  Team up with a friend and make an Iksar monk, and you have a great 2-person leveling/exploring team especially for low levels.  FYI Iksar have regeneration, and the highest wis of the shaman races, making them the best shaman and monk races IMHO (though they aren&#39;t as cute as Duna).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; (Rumor: Iksar do not get the inherent haste that human monks get at level 20+)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your high school sweetheart-where is he now?
