I have not received a<br/>\nreply<br/>\n&gt; from my email to Kyala, so I sent a message to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqguilds@...\">eqguilds@...</a> this<br/>\nmorning<br/>\n&gt; explaining what I think the problem is. Until I get information from<br/>\nVerant, I<br/>\n&gt; will not be able to get the guild set up on other servers and there is a<br/>\n&gt; possibility we may have to recreate the guild on Brell. Hopefully, someone<br/>\nfrom<br/>\n&gt; Verant will get back to me soon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here is my theory about what has happened. When I created our guild, I<br/>\n&gt; submitted the name as &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot;. When I went onto Brell to get the<br/>\n&gt; guild tags, I noticed that the name was &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; (note the<br/>\n&gt; difference MysticAL instead of Mystic). I honestly couldn&#39;t remember what<br/>\nname<br/>\n&gt; was the correct one and thought that maybe I either requested Mystical or<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; they made a typo and just changed it to Mystical, but I never gave it any<br/>\nmore<br/>\n&gt; thought.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then, weeks later we discover the name &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; is in use on<br/>\nE&#39;ci.<br/>\n&gt; So, I think what may have happened is that there is a guild called<br/>\n&quot;Mystical<br/>\n&gt; Alliance&quot; and another, ours, called &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; and that the guild<br/>\nGM on<br/>\n&gt; Brell gave me the wrong one. However, so far, I have not received a reply<br/>\nto my<br/>\n&gt; inquiries.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Because we may have the wrong guild, I don&#39;t want to set it up on anymore<br/>\n&gt; servers until I find out what is going on, since the solution may involve<br/>\ndoing<br/>\n&gt; a &#39;guilddelete&#39; and getting it recreated by a GM again with the correct<br/>\nname.<br/>\n&gt; So, be warned, if you are in the guild on Brell, we may have to start over<br/>\n&gt; again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the meantime, if any of you happen to be on any server and see a real<br/>\nGM<br/>\n&gt; (not a guild or apprentice, etc.) you may wish to ask them about this<br/>\nissue. If<br/>\n&gt; they need to know what my station ID is to help clear up the mystery, it<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; &quot;LARIDJ&quot;, my last name and first and middle initials. Ask them if they<br/>\nshow a<br/>\n&gt; guild by the name of &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; or &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; as belonging<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; that station ID. If you find out, post info to the list and/or tell me<br/>\n(Dedric)<br/>\n&gt; on Brell in game. (If you tell me in game, I will also try to get over to<br/>\nyour<br/>\n&gt; server right fast and set it up with whatever name it really is.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll let you all know when I find something out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hugs,<br/>\n&gt; David<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ???
