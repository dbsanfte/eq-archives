With the new server and possible gatherings I thought I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; introduce.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; About the only thing that may take more guts than admitting your gay on<br/>\n&gt; a straight list is admitting your straight on a gay list.  I am a straight,<br/>\n&gt; however, (no I&#39;m not about to say &quot;but I have a gay friend&quot; pppt!) ... I was<br/>\n&gt; raised by two gay males after my father died when I was quite young.<br/>\n&gt; Actually,<br/>\n&gt; since he was bedridden when I was a toddler, they had stepped into that role<br/>\n&gt; starting when I was 2-3 years old.  There were two other couples who also<br/>\n&gt; helped, known as four more &quot;Uncles&quot; to me.  So they were my functional father<br/>\n&gt; figures as long as I can rememeber, also called &quot;Uncles&quot;.  I followed in the<br/>\n&gt; professional footsteps of one (and he helped put me through college), and my<br/>\n&gt; main hobby follows the heart and profession of the other.  So &quot;I was raised<br/>\n&gt; by gays, but I&#39;m straight&quot; *is* an uncomfortable thing to say in the straight<br/>\n&gt; community.  Why do they peer at you and go &quot;Are you sure?&quot;? (grrr)<br/>\n&gt; Fortunately<br/>\n&gt; most aquaintences never questioned why I had eight &quot;Uncles&quot;, and only two<br/>\n&gt; were<br/>\n&gt; related (my mother does have two brothers). :) Anyway, that&#39;s why I joined<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; list.  Its as much &quot;home&quot; for me as any other group mailing list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve got characters on Erollisi & just strarted on Brell.  I&#39;ve RPed a bit and<br/>\n&gt; my characters are often different and some are a bit goofy, some are<br/>\n&gt; goody-two-<br/>\n&gt; shoes, some are dark and evil (cackles!).  If I&#39;m not &quot;egged&quot; or &quot;rotten<br/>\n&gt; tomatoed&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll put up the list .. I&#39;d love to find others to group with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Lora<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations SAYNO2DRUGS.
