I&#39;ve had a partner for close to <br/>\n6 years.  We will be moving to Connecticut in August for a company move.  I am <br/>\na computer programmer for a teleservices company.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say it&#39;s refreshing to be able to communicate with like minded <br/>\nindividuals about a game that I adore.  I only play one character - Sonderac, <br/>\nHigh Elf Wizard (Karana Server).  It&#39;s a power thing, I want to get to level 50 <br/>\nand float around having everyone be jealous =P~.  I did notice that most people <br/>\nwho have responded so far are in a computer related field, pattern or <br/>\ncoincidence? : )<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a small group of about 12 - 13 friends I hunt with online.  I&#39;ve had to <br/>\ncome out to two of the ladies, they started to &quot;fall&quot; for me (or so they say).  <br/>\nSo I decided instead of rejection I&#39;d just tell them the truth.  It hasn&#39;t <br/>\nchanged much, I can /tell them joking about more stuff now.  I don&#39;t go running <br/>\naround chasing cute Barbarians or making blatant fashion statements. (although <br/>\nI think about both) : ) : )<br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoy life, and think that it should be lived day to day with joy and <br/>\nhappiness.  I destroy anyone who tries to interfere with that goal. ;-&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone is on the Karana server don&#39;t be afraid to give me a /tell, I don&#39;t <br/>\nbite (unless paid) : ) : )<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope everyone is doing well in the game and out.  Safe travels and happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nScotty<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThis mail sent through Internet Express&#39;s WebMail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netexpress.net\">http://webmail.netexpress.net</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
