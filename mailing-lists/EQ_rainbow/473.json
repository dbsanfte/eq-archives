It<br/>\nturned into one of those &quot;why didn&#39;t I tell her long ago&quot; thingies.  She&#39;s<br/>\n16 and I thought she might not be mature enough to handle it, but she took<br/>\nit really well and easily.  In particular, she&#39;s a very affectionate<br/>\nperson online, and she is still affectionate towards me (I was worried she<br/>\nmight withdraw).  She also sent me an email after she logged off that<br/>\nnight where she said all the right friend things.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that I thought was kind of weird was after I told her<br/>\nshe said &quot;oh, everything makes a lot more sense now&quot;.  I was kind of<br/>\nsurprised about that, I still don&#39;t know what she means.  I think she<br/>\nmight have been refering to the fact that I had already told her I was<br/>\npolyamorous (which had confused her a fair bit).  Perhaps she found it<br/>\neasier to perceive a bi-woman as poly than a straight one? There certainly<br/>\nare enough stereotypes (I hate beind a stereotype dammit, it makes me want<br/>\nto go monogomus! =)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe actually asked me to marry her right after I came out to her.  I think<br/>\nit was her way of showing me immediate support.  I was a little blown<br/>\naway, but I turned her down.  Both her and I are fairly well known on<br/>\nBrell Serelis and my instincts said that the only way we could pull it off<br/>\nwithout harassment would be to play up on it as kind of a joke.  Since<br/>\nthat isn&#39;t the way I&#39;d want to approach an online queer wedding, and since<br/>\nI don&#39;t want her or me to get treated badly, I decided against it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings are a little further confused by the fact that I have an<br/>\nitsy-bitsy crush on her. She&#39;s just too lovable *sigh*.  I think I see her<br/>\nas someone I would have loved to date when I was in highschool.  Whenever<br/>\nshe gives me hugs or cuddles I feel all fuzzy and happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am 99% sure she&#39;s straight though (and she&#39;s a little too young for me<br/>\neven if she wasn&#39;t).  Luckily I have *lots* of experience having crushes<br/>\non my straight female friends =) So, I&#39;m pretty sure I can handle this.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
