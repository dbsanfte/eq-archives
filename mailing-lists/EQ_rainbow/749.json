Started out on Fennin Ro<br/>\nwhere <br/>\nI have a lvl 37 Cleric, named Anoka.  Then some friends started <br/>\nplaying on The Nameless, where I&#39;ve been since this spring.  I have<br/>\n38 <br/>\nDruid there, named Anoka. <br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, a dear friend has decided he wants to start a gay guild on <br/>\nThe Nameless.  Since my 38 druid is already in a guild, and she&#39;s <br/>\nfemale and I&#39;m male, I decided to start a new male druid for this <br/>\nguild, named Gaydari.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love playing druids.  =&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any others here that play on The Nameless?  We need ten <br/>\npeople to start the guild.  My friend wants to call the guild<br/>\nNameless <br/>\nLove, in honor of Oscar Wilde.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to Joseph J Normandin of Mystic Alliance on Rodcet Nife, who <br/>\nposted info about this egroup in the alt.games.everquest newsgroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nXOXOX<br/>\n<br/>\nPS<br/>\n<br/>\nmy name is David<br/>\nage: 46<br/>\nsingle<br/>\nbear  5&#39;10&quot;  230#  full beard<br/>\nblue eyes    balding<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s okay to feed the bear.
