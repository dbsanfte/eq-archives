I already have a few str8 friends that want to join.  I told them how great you guys are and I read we don&#39;t discriminate so I hope its ok.  I have been on Veeshan since Public release and I have been playing EQ since early November.  I have also been a lead officer in one other guild before on this server and just to warn, there are 2 reasons I will auto-eject a member from a guild, Severe Harrasement and constant begging after warned (ie, someone give me something for free, yadda yadda).  The reason I left this guild will be explained in my next email.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTiger  =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
