Well lets face it...doesn&#39;t it???? =) I&#39;m suggesting<br/>\n &quot;The Chosen&quot; because &quot;We Rock&quot; doesn&#39;t sound that medieval, but lets face<br/>\n it...we rock!<br/>\n <br/>\n How about &quot;Norath United&quot;? I think it presents a pretty clear strong<br/>\n concept.  On the downside it sounds a bit boring.<br/>\n <br/>\n How about &quot;We Are Everywhere&quot;.  I like it because it sends the positive<br/>\n message that GLBT people are everywhere.
