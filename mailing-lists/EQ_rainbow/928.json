I&#39;m thinking of restarting Pyotr on that server too.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If anyone is on Nameless server, please let me know so I can friend <br/>\nlist you and maybe we can group.  I have talked to another gay EQer <br/>\nand he is gonna join us there.<br/>\n<br/>\n  thanks,<br/>\n <br/>\n    Scott</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
