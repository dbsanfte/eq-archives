Today was a down for me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; First I died from a bug while swimming in RV -- couldn&#39;t move all of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a sudden, just sank to the bottom. Wasn&#39;t lag (I looked at the #&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1st thing) & I wasn&#39;t fatigued or anything. Oh well. Then I had to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; run to work, but got off early & came back to look for a GM. Ha.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; After spending 2 hours fishing I finally got a tell from an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; apprentice, who just &#39;moved it up&#39; the list. At this point I figured<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I could have already made back the level I lost (did I mention that?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the only reason I had bothered to petition in the 1st place). I did<br/>\n&gt; &gt; finally hear from a GM later -- hadn&#39;t heard of the bug before, so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they just &#39;filed a report&#39;, i.e. did nothing for me except waste my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time. So, I ran to join up with some folks to hunt after giving up on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them when the 1st one just put it back on the list.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Well, the gods of Norrath weren&#39;t through with me yet. I tried to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; run through the Gorge (aka Beholder) along the left wall, & got<br/>\n&gt; &gt; charmed & then slaughtered by an eye. OK, run back from RV, loot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; corpse which a guildmate (Cassious or Tiramisu, & apologies for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forgetting which) had kindly pulled to the zone, ready to hunt. Then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tried to go the right side -- OK, first I do not recommend trying to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; run on walls while using Selo&#39;s. I did at least find out that a level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 11 (now) bard CAN survive a fall from the highest point you can climb<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to -- just. Of course, when you have stuff already agro&#39;d & waiting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at the bottom to kick your battered butt, this hardly matters.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   So, second corpse run in 30 minutes, & quickly gaining on the level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 10, which was so much more fun than 12 or 11 that I just have to go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; back to it again, I guess. Only problem now is, I was so far into the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Gorge, & lost while running from agro&#39;d mobs, that no one can find my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; corpse. We took a group of four (Cassious, Hamyrmint, me, & a non-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guild mage who kindly agreed to help) & were having a tough time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fighting our way up the gorge. Then I saw another eye coming. The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mage & another high-level wanted to take it, so Cass & I ran. Hamyr<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bravely stayed to try to push on after the casters took the eye --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but the eye took him. :(<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   OK, now there are 2 corpse out there. Cass was doing the sneaky<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thief thing, & finally managed to find Hamyr&#39;s body, but no one could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; find mine. Gaybriel even ran in a bit, but couldn&#39;t find it. A nice<br/>\n&gt; &gt; caster type sitting nearby agreed to invis me, but it wore off before<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I could get in far enough to find it & I had to run back. Finally,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disgusted with the whole thing, I went in alone & visible -- at this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; point I hardly even cared if I died again. Well, by working back &<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forth with the locate song (the twisty gorge made it of very limited<br/>\n&gt; &gt; use), I finally found my corpse. Dragged it to a safe spot up the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cliff, & looted it. Then turned to leave -- & realized I was lost.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another ten minutes of wandering, & I FINALLY made it out. Ran to RV<br/>\n&gt; &gt; & camped, exhausted after 6 hours & 1/2 bub (& 1 level) lower than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when I started.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Anyway, got caught up in the drama of it all writing this, & sure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we&#39;ve all had days like that (or worse), but the whole point of this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was to really thank the people who helped me. I can tell you, I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; incredibly frustrated (& thankful I wasn&#39;t on roger wilco -- hehe), &<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t imagine how much worse it all would have been if I&#39;d had to go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; through it without the help or my guildmates, both those in the zone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; & those who offered their suggestions. I even had to ask people to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; STOP suggestions at one point because they were coming so fast!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s really great, & I appreciate every bit of it. I know I was a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bit short at times because of the frustration I was feeling (sorry),<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but I really did appreciate all of it -- just wanted to let eveyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Oh, yeah, and Var? Don&#39;t marry Kerid (sorry Kerid)! I can make you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much happier, & let you keep your freedom too (that goes for you,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; too, Anthonie -- just because I think Var&#39;s a hottie doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; casting you aside, sexy)! Why can&#39;t we all live like the bards --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; free to share with all? Hehe, just kidding -- maybe ;).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1.
