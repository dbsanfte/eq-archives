All Guild members must show respect to others<br/>\n&gt; whether they are in the Guild or not. No homophobes will be allowed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The purpose of the Guild is:<br/>\n&gt; o  to use our resources for mutual benefit<br/>\n&gt; o  to adventure together in an atmosphere where we are not subjected to<br/>\n&gt; homophobic comments<br/>\n&gt; o  to enhance the enjoyment of life in Norath for all of us.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The above part of the charter is universal to all servers on which our guild<br/>\n&gt; may have members.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Brell Serilis and other role playing servers, our charter is additionally:<br/>\n&gt; o  to encourage RPing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How does all of the above sound????<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do we want some other common goal? Would we all one day like to have a guild<br/>\n&gt; strong enough to slay a dragon? Is there some other universal goal we could<br/>\n&gt; all agree on that might be a theme for our guild and that might therefore<br/>\n&gt; suggest a name? Like the dragon thing. I&#39;d like to be part of a group that got<br/>\n&gt; one, you know... Wouldn&#39;t we all one day?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yesterday, I said I&#39;d post a back story for our guild. I have not until now<br/>\n&gt; because I thought about totally rewriting it, but then I decided I&#39;ll just<br/>\n&gt; post it and let someone else totally rewrite it. It is below. The first person<br/>\n&gt; who wants to take a crack at a rewrite, just tell us on the list and then<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;ll wait for you to post your version and then the next person can.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some guidelines. I&#39;d like the backstory to include a prominent male and female<br/>\n&gt; hero and heroine. You may include as much Norathian lore as you desire. I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know much yet and haven&#39;t put much in. Feel free to include more of<br/>\n&gt; this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, someone either edit what I have or throw it out and start over. I cranked<br/>\n&gt; this puppy out in about 5 minutes, so I won&#39;t be offended at all if the whole<br/>\n&gt; thing is pitched, but maybe it can be a starting point or at least get the<br/>\n&gt; imagination working.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here it is:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cleric Elgen Baknor was a disciple of The Queen of Love. After learning all<br/>\n&gt; about the love that Erollisi Marr espoused, he decided to leave the Temple of<br/>\n&gt; Marr because he wanted to experience that love.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Having entered the priesthood because he could not see himself falling in love<br/>\n&gt; with a woman, he eventually met and fell in love with a man whose identity is<br/>\n&gt; shrouded in mystery. It is believed he may have been a man who held high rank<br/>\n&gt; in the Temple. Eventually though, Elgen would realize the relationship would<br/>\n&gt; not work for he was unable to openly express his love for this mysterious man.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Elgen had heard of a woman who was a mighty warrior in Faydwer who loved other<br/>\n&gt; women in the same way he loved men. He set out to find her.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Elgen left the city of Freeport and ventured to Faydwer. On his journey, he<br/>\n&gt; picked up many friends who believed, just as Elgen, that love was the answer,<br/>\n&gt; regardless of gender. He asked each of his friends if they had heard of this<br/>\n&gt; woman whose heart belonged to another woman. But none had.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Finally, one day the group came upon two women at a campsite normally<br/>\n&gt; inhabited by numerous Orcs, but on this day, no Orcs were to be seen. Suddenly<br/>\n&gt; though, an Orc sprang out of nowhere. Fearing for their lives Elgen&#39;s group<br/>\n&gt; began to run. But in the corner of his eye, Elgen saw one of the two women<br/>\n&gt; pull out a long sword and strike down the Orc in a matter of seconds, while<br/>\n&gt; the other woman, continued to sit undisturbed in silent meditation. This<br/>\n&gt; supreme warrior introduced herself and her lover to the small group. [Need a<br/>\n&gt; name for her and her lover]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This small band of cast out souls formed their own community, a small camp in<br/>\n&gt; the recesses of Lesser Faydark. Together, these men and women took the best<br/>\n&gt; ideals of Erollisi Marr and combined them with their own beliefs. Their small<br/>\n&gt; sect, comprised originally of only followers of Erollisi Marr, eventually<br/>\n&gt; began to attract followers of other deities, even the Plaguebringer. For no<br/>\n&gt; matter their race or class, spread throughout the lands of Norath were people<br/>\n&gt; who believed that love did not have to be restricted to only the opposite<br/>\n&gt; gender. This one belief united them despite all their other diversity and they<br/>\n&gt; would eventually become known as &#39;[guild name goes here]&#39;.<br/>\n&gt; ----------------<br/>\n&gt; So, there&#39;s my cheesy attempt at a back story. Who wants to to take a crack at<br/>\n&gt; it. You can&#39;t make it any worse than it is, so someone give it a try.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hugs,<br/>\n&gt; David<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Best Place to Buy Movies - Reel.com<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
