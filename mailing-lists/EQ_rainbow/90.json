As in respect for a<br/>\nguild, what should it be called?  I do not think a name like GLBC should be<br/>\nused.  It should be something that maybe gay people might pick up on, but<br/>\nnothing to obvious and fantasy based.  As a suggestion, I think maybe a<br/>\nname like the Rainbow warriors might be good although some of you may think<br/>\nits obvious.  Beleive it or not, most hetros do not know the significance<br/>\nof the the rainbow yet.  Or maybe some ancient word meaning same sex or<br/>\nsomething like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Jinsu 11th level monk on bertelboxis</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
