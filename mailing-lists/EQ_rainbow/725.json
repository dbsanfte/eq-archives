Hehe -- short <br/>\nquestion, long answer (sorry, I love trivia).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Qwerty was designed in the days of manual keyboards. The little<br/>\nbars would jam if someone typed too fast, so some guy designed a <br/>\nkeyboard layout that was as inefficient as possible to slow typists <br/>\ndown & prevent this -- voila, Qwerty. It ended up being the de facto<br/>\nstandard keyboard layout because this same guy was a great salesman <br/>\nwho marketed his typewriters to the U.S. Army during WWII. Of course <br/>\nthe Army bought it in bulk & trained a slew of clerktypists, who then<br/>\nknew qwerty when they left the army & went to work for offices after <br/>\nthe war. All of these offices then bought Qwerty typewriters, & the <br/>\nnumerous other keyboard layouts that had been in existance pretty<br/>\nmuch all died out (at least in the U.S.).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dvorak, on the other hand, was designed for maximum efficiency. The <br/>\nDvorak brothers studied ergonomics (back before the word existed) to <br/>\nsee which patterns of keystrokes were fastest & easiest to make. They <br/>\nthen studied the English language to see which 2-letter combinations <br/>\nwere most common, so that they could set these 2 letters to the <br/>\neasiest keystroke combos (i.e. th is very common, so t & h are each<br/>\nin a position that makes it very easy to type one right after the<br/>\nother). Great engineers, but not very good salesmen, so their<br/>\nkeyboard never really caught on.<br/>\n<br/>\n  All of this boils down to the fact that Dvorak is easier to use, <br/>\nmore efficient, & less tiring for the hands when typing for long <br/>\nperiods. I  was at about 45 wpm or so when I was using qwerty <br/>\nregularly (slower now since I&#39;m rusty). After switching to Dvorak, I <br/>\nwas matching that speed within about 3 weeks, & had surpassed it in <br/>\nanother 2 or 3. Since any Windows PC has Dvorak in the keyboard <br/>\nsettings, you don&#39;t have to worry about buying a special keyboard or <br/>\nbeing unable to type on someone else&#39;s computer. The only problem <br/>\ncomes in DOS or DOS-based programs -- & EQ.<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Shoes?
