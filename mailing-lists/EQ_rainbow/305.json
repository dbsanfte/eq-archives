Well","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-969033941\">Hey,<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, heres a little problem that follows the issue...<br/>\nI play a level 30 half-elf female, and from day one I&#39;ve always had guys <br/>\nhitting on me, hehe.. Well in RL Im just a 20yr male w/ a fairly feminime <br/>\npersonality and I love to dress and look like a girl when I have the <br/>\noppurtunity.. Problem is Im totally straight so when guys hit on me I kinda <br/>\nlike freak out and try to avoid them. Although one guy in particular never <br/>\nleaves me alone. He really is a nice guy. He groups with me alot and points <br/>\nsome great hunting grounds out. Of course I never had the guts to tell him I <br/>\nreally am a guy. He is around level 45 and knows alot of the high level <br/>\npeople, and the last thing I want is to be constantly harrased by all of <br/>\nthem when I start exploring the high level dungeons and need these people in <br/>\nmy group.. Well, anywayz hes always trying to smooch me and such, and I just <br/>\ndon&#39;t think I can be comfy roleplaying that.. maybe I should tell him I have <br/>\na in game boyfriend already? Hmm, probably a little too late for that now.. <br/>\n=&#92;<br/>\n<br/>\n-Amber</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
