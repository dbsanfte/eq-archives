As far as names for the women in the history, there&#39;s a couple I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have in mind, but need to look up tonight before posting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In reading your message, Christina, another name came to mind &lt;as she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cautiously tosses it into the fray&gt;: Mystic Alliance<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think the GLBT-related names have pretty much been dropped in discussion by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most people. This name is role-play appropriate, it is somewhat mysterious and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the alliance part is what we are about. There is nothing good/evil impliant in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the name, nor any specific class or race.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Although the GLBT link may not be apparent in any name chosen, it is easy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enough to add symbolism to any graphics/logo associated with a guild site.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Granted, it wouldn&#39;t be visually attached to our names in the game, but if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people want to know, they&#39;ll ask or look for a website for information.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As far as publicity for the guild once things are a bit settled, PlanetOut<br/>\n&gt; &gt; might be a great online zine to contact. Their turnaround time for getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; information out is much quicker than the print media. I think they may also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have links to GLBT websites, which would be great when we have one for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guild. I can&#39;t recall if there is a gay-related news service bureau. Some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; individuals were trying to create one a while ago. The BBC is very queer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friendly and could be interested in a story, especially if we wish to reach<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our brothers and sisters in the EU. Wired may also be a good place to reach<br/>\n&gt; &gt; GLBT gamers and they have their email newsletters as well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I enjoyed chatting with you all in the guild formation last night.

I don&#39;t see the need for us to be outcasts<br/>\n&gt; &gt; though. I personally prefer to assume that Norathian culture is generally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; accepting of diverse sexual orientation, and that players who express<br/>\n&gt; &gt; otherwise are members of some strange minority.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; One thing I would like to see in terms of roleplay is that GLBT and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; positive people share a kind of bond that is manifests itself as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tangible spiritual connection. Something along the lines of us all coming<br/>\n&gt; &gt; together because we had this connection, and could sense it in eachother.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kind of a mystic gaydar 8) I like it because this implies a reason for us<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to exist in an organization beyond combating homophobia (which implies<br/>\n&gt; &gt; homophobia is a force requiring an organization to combat).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    - Christina<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    On Thu, 29 Jul 1999, David Lari wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    &gt; From: David Lari &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kerik@...\">kerik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    &gt; My ideas for our charter and lower down the &#39;back story&#39; thing I promised<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    &gt; yesterday.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ____________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
