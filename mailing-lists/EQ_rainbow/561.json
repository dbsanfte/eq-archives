I am sorry to hear that you are leaving the game as I enjoyed our<br/>\nshort time hunting together, etc. Not to mention, my little cleric could use<br/>\nsome items as well. Ananda is currently an officer as is Reinbeaux (my<br/>\npartner). I also started a halfling warrior by the name of Mylan.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know what you think.
