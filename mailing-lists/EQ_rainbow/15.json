A MUCKer.  Every once in a while I run into someone online and I can just tell they MUCKd/MUSHd/MUDd. It&#39;s always nice to meet someone else who did that.  I know Furry MUCK of course, though I didn&#39;t play it myself.  I was a hard core MUSHer though on a MUSH called telamagica based on the &#39;Ars Magica&#39; role playing game (the best RPG ever created IMHO).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (50/50) when some wanker shouts &quot;man those human/DE/High Elf/Blah blah babes are hot!&quot; ;) And actually that brings up another rant, I seem<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*Sigh* what can you do? Give /feedback I guess! I&#39;ll remember to rant next time I&#39;m on.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I&#39;m sure everyone would like to see is more options in designing your character portrait.  Maybe EQ won&#39;t get them, but maybe the next game will.  I want a little slider bar I can use to control the size of my breasts personally.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; little more than hack and slash. I loved Ultima Online for the world, but left it because of all the horrible &quot;Kewl d00ds&quot; that made the<br/>\n&gt; place seem like some kind of kindergarten class overrun<br/>\n&gt; by demonically power misbehaved children. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lol! That about sums it up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would love that, I think we should form our own multi-server guild:) <br/>\n&gt; I am playing (and I should really focus on one character one of<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve considered that.  I figure I&#39;ll wait and see how this mailing list goes, and if there is enough interest, form a guild.  Some ideas I have for forming a guild would include:<br/>\n    - have it on one server, not multiple servers, to<br/>\n      ensure there would be enough guild members<br/>\n      availble to form a cohesive guild.<br/>\n    - have it on a new server (I&#39;m sure Verant will<br/>\n      keep adding servers for a while).  This is fair<br/>\n      to everyone (everyone needs to start a fresh<br/>\n      character).  It also allows the opportunity to<br/>\n      get involved in a brand new environment.<br/>\nI figure I&#39;ll check back with the list in a couple of months and see how people feel about this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; make money off it:) First and foremost though I<br/>\n&gt; am a Writer, its what I love to do. Although recently I havnt written <br/>\n&gt; too much, mabye I&#39;m playing too much EQ...;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a writer as well, but it is very hard (when you&#39;re as completely addicted to EQ as I am) to find the time to write.  My approach is the &#39;burnout&#39; approach, I&#39;m trying to play this game until I completely burn out my interest in it.  Hope it works, or I&#39;ll just be a very addicted 60 year old some day.<br/>\n<br/>\nChat with you soon,<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet free personalized email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.iname.com\">http://www.iname.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
