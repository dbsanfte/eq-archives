This is on Brell Serelis with Luna my 50th level<br/>\nenchanter.  She will be marrying Duna, a 45th level monk.<br/>\n<br/>\nA while ago I posted to the list about Duna, basicly lamenting the fact I<br/>\nhad a crush on her and I was sure she was a straight girl.  Well, she&#39;s<br/>\nnot as straight as I thought.  Since that time we&#39;ve slowly developed an<br/>\nonline relationship (another first for me), and I guess the culmination of<br/>\nthat relationship is our characters getting married.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has proved very interesting to me from a queer coming out<br/>\nperspective.  Our characters have been dating for a while now, but they&#39;ve<br/>\nboth been in the closet so to speak.  I was fairly comfortable with this<br/>\narrangement, but Duna decided at some point that we should get married.<br/>\nWell, I&#39;d actually already proposed to her, but I didn&#39;t think she&#39;d say<br/>\nyes.  Since then she&#39;s been coming out to people somewhat randomly.  We&#39;ve<br/>\nstarted /em&#39;ing kissing eachother in public.  So far, no negative<br/>\nreactions.  Most people think we&#39;re joking around I think though.  I<br/>\nreally don&#39;t know how things are going to go in the long run.  This all<br/>\nonly happened last evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuna is very brave about all this, I think she may also not entirely know<br/>\nwhat she&#39;s getting into.  She&#39;s quite young (16), and doesn&#39;t seem to have<br/>\na lot of experience with queer stuff, and accordingly has none of the fear<br/>\nI have associated with coming out.  I think its amazing she wants to do<br/>\nall this, I want to do it too, but I would never have dreamed of<br/>\nsuggesting it to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe final details of the wedding have not been set.  There has been some<br/>\ntalk of having it in the throne room of King Tranix the fire giant, which<br/>\nwould limit attendence to those level 40+.  We may have it in a more<br/>\nmundane location.  Regardless, I will let everyone know, and if you can<br/>\nattend I would love you all to attend.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
