It<br/>\nhas been impossible for me to catch up to her in game as I am on the<br/>\nEast coast and she works late times on the west coast. I&#39;ve spent 20+<br/>\nhours in the petition queue, and refuse to do that again.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully, the email will allow us to resolve this. I&#39;ll update everyone<br/>\nwhen I get some news, but since I didn&#39;t have any yet, I was just going<br/>\nto wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully, she will check email before she goes online and send me a<br/>\nreply. I think I have an idea of what might have happened to cause this<br/>\nand am asking her for some information which will confirm (or not) my<br/>\nhypothesis.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, until I get an answer, I have to suspend efforts to get the guild<br/>\ngoing on other servers. I will elaborate more after I have solid<br/>\ninformation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to everyone who has been helping with this and also, thanks for<br/>\nyour patience.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\nDavid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
