","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-991604040\">Hiya!<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure if Gaydari mentioned it be there is a queer guild on rodcet Nife<br/>\ncalled the Mystic Alliance.  You are welcome to join us there if you want<br/>\n:)  We&#39;ve had a lot of poeple coming over to us from other serves lately,<br/>\neven leaving their high lvl charhcters.  But they all tell me it has been<br/>\nwell-worth the move.   Adiitionally since the guild is set up, it can be<br/>\nexported to any server.  We ahve done this previously on other serves,<br/>\nBrell for instance, but i guess the guild has dwindled on those servers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your not dead-set on ahving your guilds name we can easily export the<br/>\nMystic Allaince to the nameless even if its just you (i.e. you dont need<br/>\n10 people) thast how the Mystic Alliance got to me about a year ago, and<br/>\nnow we have a ton of poelpe most of whom play regularly :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-joe<br/>\nFentus Fayspark<br/>\nGuildleader - Mystic Alliance<br/>\nRodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n On Wed, 2 Aug 2000, Terry Walker<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Howdy.  Glad to find this group.  I was pointed here by Gaydari/Anoka.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m the one who&#39;s trying to create a queer guild on The Nameless <br/>\n&gt; Server.  I&#39;ve already picked out &quot;Nameless Love&quot; as its name.  <br/>\n&gt; Catchy, eh?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m hoping that I can snag a few people from here willing to help us <br/>\n&gt; set up shop on the server.  I need at least 10 concurrent people to <br/>\n&gt; sign on long enough to create the guild.  Anyone willing to donate at <br/>\n&gt; least that much time to the cause?  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, you can read the charter I typed up for it at <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://antinomy.org/nameless.html\">http://antinomy.org/nameless.html</a> .  Be forewarned, this site works <br/>\n&gt; only when my pc is not booted into Win2000 to play games (including <br/>\n&gt; EQ).  When I&#39;m not goofing around, I have it booted to BeOS with the <br/>\n&gt; webserver running.  So if the address doesn&#39;t connect, just try again <br/>\n&gt; later.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *wave*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
