We had a 19 troll warrior, an 18 druid and me, a 17 druid.<br/>\nWe druids could not cast any DD spells on him because he was too high. We<br/>\nsimply damage shielded our warrior and healed him till we were OOM while he<br/>\nbeat the thing. However, even though we were successful at getting the kill<br/>\n(and the experience), about 2 or 3 other ungrouped people were beating on<br/>\nhim too. Without the others beating on him, we would not have won.<br/>\n<br/>\nLJ seems to have a random spawn and I think one of the other gators must be<br/>\na place holder for him. I&#39;ve gone hours and hours without hearing of an LJ<br/>\nsighting and then he&#39;ll spawn twice in 15 minutes. He can spawn as far south<br/>\nas the orc camp near S Ro, and almost as far north as the N Ro zone and<br/>\nanywhere along the shore in between. Because of some nice loot, he also has<br/>\none of the shortest lifespans of any creature in Norrath. I have read that<br/>\nhe is about level 24 or 25.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best bet to find him is kill as many gators (crocs and caimens and their<br/>\ndeep water cousins) and have 2 or 3 trackers spaced evenly along the coast<br/>\ntrying to pick him up. Then you better be ready to move quick or someone<br/>\nelse will get the kill.<br/>\n<br/>\nKerik</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
