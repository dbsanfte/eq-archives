My first response to hearing about EQ<br/>\n&gt; Rainbow made me laugh out loud: &quot;My God, there are others like me out<br/>\n&gt; there!&quot; I had wondered if there were any other gay/lesbian players<br/>\n&gt; around (I certainly hadn&#39;t met them).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am Vince Bowes, a Branch Supervisor of a public library in Toronto,<br/>\n&gt; Canada. I&#39;ve been playing EQ off and on for about eight months. I have<br/>\n&gt; two characters I play frequently on the Tribunal server, but I am<br/>\n&gt; strongly considering ending them and starting over on the RN server<br/>\n&gt; because I am really curious about the Mystic Alliance...but it will be<br/>\n&gt; hard to drop my level 17 druid, Kestrelle. But it would be worthwhile to<br/>\n&gt; talk to other gay players and be part of a truly &#39;open&#39; guild. Are there<br/>\n&gt; any openings for a high elf cleric in the ranks? That&#39;s a class/race<br/>\n&gt; combo I have been eager to try for some time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cya in Norrath folks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
