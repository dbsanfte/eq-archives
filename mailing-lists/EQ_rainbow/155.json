Our offical name right now is The Unity.  But it has come to<br/>\nour attention that there is another guild named Unity.  It was suggested<br/>\nthat we change our name as to be distinct form this group.  Many suggestion<br/>\nwere thrown about, and I personally tended to by hyper-critical of them<br/>\nbecause I wanted a guild name and charter that would fit role-players as<br/>\nwell as non-role players, good, neutral, and evil charachters.  It was also<br/>\nimportant to me to be identofied as a group for GLBT people and their<br/>\nfriends, while still keeping true to the fantasy style of EQ, and the<br/>\nNorrathian culture.  This feat was assisted by many poeple in the chat.  So<br/>\nmany suggestions were made, but I sincerely feel that my following proposal<br/>\nfits best with what we all intend.  I hope that we can all join together on<br/>\nall serves with this guild name and charter and have some fun.  David, do<br/>\nyou know how, or if we can cange our nbame now?  I hope so!   Of course i<br/>\nwant people to make changes and or suggestions to this, and i will leave<br/>\nthat compliing of that info to David :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGuild name:  Force of Synergy<br/>\n<br/>\nCharter:    Forged by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered people of<br/>\nNorrath, and their friends, who saw a fractured society, to form alliances<br/>\nof respect, knowledge, and truth, though not necessarily of love, between<br/>\nthe many peoples of Norrath...this is the Force of Synergy.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow what?<br/>\n<br/>\n-joe<br/>\n=============================<br/>\nJoseph J.
