We only need ten people to get the <br/>\nguild started, and they dont all have to have a player on the same server. <br/>\nWhich means that a guild can start basicly on all the servers once it has <br/>\nbeen approved. Only thing is the guild master has to have a char on the <br/>\nserver to petition and get it created. After the guild has been created on a <br/>\nserver if the guildmaster doesnt want to be the guildmaster on that server he <br/>\ncan hand it off.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I am basicly saying is. Even thought I dont have the time to play a <br/>\nchar on the ber server I will be there tonight to help get the guild started. <br/>\nIf David doent want to be the guildmaster on my particular <br/>\nserver(bristlebane) I would be happy to take over for him. All he would need <br/>\nto do is start a temp char. Petition for the guild. Then hand it over to me <br/>\nor whom every they want. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you do not play on the roleplay server please dont fell left out. I am <br/>\nsure when Unity is made. You will quickly see the guild all over. <br/>\n<br/>\nGoing on the old 10% rule. There  should be almost 2000 GLBT people playing <br/>\nthe game. They just are not on this list. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know what you think<br/>\n<br/>\nWampir</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
