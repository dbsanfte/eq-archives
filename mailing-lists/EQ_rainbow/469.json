I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-594644036\">David and all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have my server ready to roll and can host the website directly from here.<br/>\nThe site address is not set went but will getting a domian soon. I have<br/>\nobtained cold fusion so the databse idea for members to place their<br/>\ncharacters, server and stats upon the site should be easily setup and going.<br/>\nI have secured the real information behind my secure wall and will be<br/>\naccessible by password and username. I hate to do this but to keep people<br/>\nfrom being harassed it would be the best way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a list of ideas I have about adding to the site.<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage Board<br/>\nPossible Chat room for real-time conversation<br/>\nGuild Members Database<br/>\n    This will include<br/>\n<br/>\n    Character Name<br/>\n    Level<br/>\n    Race<br/>\n    Class<br/>\n    Server<br/>\n    email address<br/>\n<br/>\n    Also have the idea about placing a skill section so you can specify the<br/>\nskill you have and what levels, could be helpful for a tailor looking to get<br/>\nitems enchanted by an Enchanter. This will help to get guild member out to<br/>\nassist others in there adventures. The email address can be used to allow<br/>\nothers to contact you about the services they may require of a specific<br/>\ncharacter. I will place a way to search the listings for specific<br/>\ninformation and whether someone wishes to provide these services.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know if there are any other ideas that you may want to see added to<br/>\nthe site. The base site can be available pretty quickly but the advanced<br/>\nitems will take sometime to complete. If anyone wishes to help please let me<br/>\nknow, I will gladly accept any assist. We will need graphics and if we can<br/>\ndevise a logo that would be great.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, David I will gladly take on the role of guild master or officer for<br/>\nthe E&#39;Ci server. I am on quite regularly and my character is a decent level<br/>\nso I can get pretty much anywhere (as long as I sneak about, LOL). Let me<br/>\nknow what I can do to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been staying in Northern Ro mostly so anyone in that area, give me a<br/>\ntell. To all of you I just want to say that if you ever need anything in the<br/>\ngame let me know I will be more than glad to do what I can!<br/>\n<br/>\nMay prosperity be in all your endeavors,<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n(Marlys on E&#39;Ci)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Lora Roa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loraroa@...\">loraroa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_rainbow@onelist.com\">EQ_rainbow@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_rainbow@onelist.com\">EQ_rainbow@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, September 10, 1999 3:29 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_rainbow] Harrasment and E&#39;Ci...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Lora Roa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loraroa@...\">loraroa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;If I see him online, I am tempted to do a tell to him and tell him I saw<br/>\n&gt;their<br/>\n&gt;&gt;web site, and am very supportive of gay people and wish his guild luck<br/>\n&gt;&gt;(pretending I&#39;m straight of course.)

I wonder if I can bug a friend and see what<br/>\n&gt;royalty free graphics we can dig up ... I also can do Logo-type graphics<br/>\n&gt;and have had some companies and groups use mine before, I still have my<br/>\n&gt;graphics package (I bought it).  If anyone has freehand graphics though, I<br/>\n&gt;do have a scanner and can scan if they are sent to me and get it in a<br/>\n&gt;variety of graphics formats (as well as photo touch-up work, etc ...).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Lora<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
