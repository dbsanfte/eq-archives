Our guild could be a<br/>\nmulti-racial multi-class guild.  I.E. DE Necros, and Troll SKs working<br/>\nwith Paladins and Druids.  The guild would not ask that evil people be<br/>\ngood, or good people be evil, but it would require that all guild members<br/>\ncooperate and be honorable to eachother.  This would also fit in with the<br/>\nname Unity.  This is kind of a wacky concept, but I thought I&#39;d throw it<br/>\nout 8) <br/>\n<br/>\n9:30pm Wednesday EST sounds good to me.  I may be a little late, but I&#39;ll<br/>\nbe there.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 26 Jul 1999, David Lari wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: David Lari &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kerik@...\">kerik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Okay, I&#39;ll be the guild master.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t heard any negative comments about the name &#39;Unity&#39;, so I think that will<br/>\n&gt; be the name unless someone else has something better. So, let&#39;s make plans for this<br/>\n&gt; Wednesday to meet in chat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I will make the channel &#39;Unity&#39; and the password will be &#39;rainbow&#39; in all lower case<br/>\n&gt; (and case does matter.) If you have any trouble getting into the chat room, just<br/>\n&gt; contact me directly, my chat name is Lari.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now we need a time to get 10 people all together at once. I am in Eastern Daylight<br/>\n&gt; Time. I can be on as early as 4:30pm EDT, and as late as 10:30pm EDT. If we shoot<br/>\n&gt; for early in that window, we can get some of our European members on, but will miss<br/>\n&gt; the US Pacific time people who may still be at work. Let&#39;s tentatively set it for<br/>\n&gt; 9:30pm EDT, this Wednesday. Please let me know if you will be able to attend the<br/>\n&gt; chat at that time. If you cannot, then please tell me a time when you can, in case I<br/>\n&gt; have to reschedule.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We will work first to create the guild on Brell Serilis, and then spread it to other<br/>\n&gt; servers fairly quickly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would also suggest we need to describe the guild in OOC and IC terms. OOC it will<br/>\n&gt; be a guild that is open to tolerant, fair-minded people who are GLBT or affirming.<br/>\n&gt; But what do we want it to be &#39;in character&#39;. I&#39;d suggest that it certainly not<br/>\n&gt; discriminate at all based on race or class. Also, do we want to promote RPing, or<br/>\n&gt; just encourage it, or not bother with it? Or do we just want a guild to provide help<br/>\n&gt; and friendship to our sister and brother guild mates (such as selling banded armor<br/>\n&gt; at a steep discount and things like that?)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If anyone has any better ideas or plans, please share them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dedric of Ak&#39;anon<br/>\n&gt; Gnome Necromancer of the 5th circle of life.<br/>\n&gt; Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members? <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
