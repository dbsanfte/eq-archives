First of all, let me say that the people I have met from MA<br/>\nhave been absolutely great to me, very welcoming and helpful...all that I<br/>\ncould wish for in a guild, and the guildsays are now the highlight of my<br/>\nplaying sessions. The server in general I find also has a friendliness that<br/>\nthe Tribunal sometimes lacks, although I haven&#39;t yet met enough non-guild<br/>\nplayers to really say if this is a trend or merely luck. So far, I have not<br/>\nregretted switching to RN and playing there, and I seriously doubt that I ever<br/>\nwill.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you ever see my cleric, Kythwin, online be sure to wave to him!<br/>\n<br/>\nVince<br/>\nKythwin, Cleric of Tunare, 6th Circle</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
