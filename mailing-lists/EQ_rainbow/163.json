In the press release, which I will post here for review<br/>\n&gt; first, I will mention EQ_Rainbow and the guild.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone else have ideas?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WAMPIR@...\">WAMPIR@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WAMPIR@...\">WAMPIR@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello all.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; One thing I think everyone should know. We only need ten people to get the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guild started, and they dont all have to have a player on the same server.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Which means that a guild can start basicly on all the servers once it has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been approved. Only thing is the guild master has to have a char on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; server to petition and get it created. After the guild has been created on a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; server if the guildmaster doesnt want to be the guildmaster on that server he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can hand it off.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So what I am basicly saying is. Even thought I dont have the time to play a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; char on the ber server I will be there tonight to help get the guild started.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If David doent want to be the guildmaster on my particular<br/>\n&gt; &gt; server(bristlebane) I would be happy to take over for him. All he would need<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to do is start a temp char. Petition for the guild. Then hand it over to me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or whom every they want.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So if you do not play on the roleplay server please dont fell left out. I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sure when Unity is made. You will quickly see the guild all over.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Going on the old 10% rule. There  should be almost 2000 GLBT people playing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the game. They just are not on this list.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Let me know what you think<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wampir<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Are you?
