Today was a down for me. <br/>\nFirst I died from a bug while swimming in RV -- couldn&#39;t move all of <br/>\na sudden, just sank to the bottom. Wasn&#39;t lag (I looked at the #&#39;s <br/>\n1st thing) & I wasn&#39;t fatigued or anything. Oh well. Then I had to <br/>\nrun to work, but got off early & came back to look for a GM. Ha. <br/>\nAfter spending 2 hours fishing I finally got a tell from an <br/>\napprentice, who just &#39;moved it up&#39; the list. At this point I figured <br/>\nI could have already made back the level I lost (did I mention that? <br/>\nthe only reason I had bothered to petition in the 1st place). I did <br/>\nfinally hear from a GM later -- hadn&#39;t heard of the bug before, so <br/>\nthey just &#39;filed a report&#39;, i.e. did nothing for me except waste my <br/>\ntime. So, I ran to join up with some folks to hunt after giving up on <br/>\nthem when the 1st one just put it back on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, the gods of Norrath weren&#39;t through with me yet. I tried to <br/>\nrun through the Gorge (aka Beholder) along the left wall, & got <br/>\ncharmed & then slaughtered by an eye. OK, run back from RV, loot <br/>\ncorpse which a guildmate (Cassious or Tiramisu, & apologies for <br/>\nforgetting which) had kindly pulled to the zone, ready to hunt. Then <br/>\ntried to go the right side -- OK, first I do not recommend trying to <br/>\nrun on walls while using Selo&#39;s. I did at least find out that a level <br/>\n11 (now) bard CAN survive a fall from the highest point you can climb <br/>\nto -- just. Of course, when you have stuff already agro&#39;d & waiting <br/>\nat the bottom to kick your battered butt, this hardly matters.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, second corpse run in 30 minutes, & quickly gaining on the level <br/>\n10, which was so much more fun than 12 or 11 that I just have to go <br/>\nback to it again, I guess. Only problem now is, I was so far into the <br/>\nGorge, & lost while running from agro&#39;d mobs, that no one can find my <br/>\ncorpse. We took a group of four (Cassious, Hamyrmint, me, & a non-<br/>\nguild mage who kindly agreed to help) & were having a tough time <br/>\nfighting our way up the gorge. Then I saw another eye coming. The <br/>\nmage & another high-level wanted to take it, so Cass & I ran. Hamyr <br/>\nbravely stayed to try to push on after the casters took the eye -- <br/>\nbut the eye took him. :(<br/>\n<br/>\n  OK, now there are 2 corpse out there. Cass was doing the sneaky <br/>\nthief thing, & finally managed to find Hamyr&#39;s body, but no one could <br/>\nfind mine. Gaybriel even ran in a bit, but couldn&#39;t find it. A nice <br/>\ncaster type sitting nearby agreed to invis me, but it wore off before <br/>\nI could get in far enough to find it & I had to run back. Finally, <br/>\ndisgusted with the whole thing, I went in alone & visible -- at this <br/>\npoint I hardly even cared if I died again. Well, by working back & <br/>\nforth with the locate song (the twisty gorge made it of very limited <br/>\nuse), I finally found my corpse. Dragged it to a safe spot up the <br/>\ncliff, & looted it. Then turned to leave -- & realized I was lost. <br/>\nAnother ten minutes of wandering, & I FINALLY made it out. Ran to RV <br/>\n& camped, exhausted after 6 hours & 1/2 bub (& 1 level) lower than <br/>\nwhen I started.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, got caught up in the drama of it all writing this, & sure <br/>\nwe&#39;ve all had days like that (or worse), but the whole point of this <br/>\nwas to really thank the people who helped me. I can tell you, I was <br/>\nincredibly frustrated (& thankful I wasn&#39;t on roger wilco -- hehe), & <br/>\ncan&#39;t imagine how much worse it all would have been if I&#39;d had to go <br/>\nthrough it without the help or my guildmates, both those in the zone <br/>\n& those who offered their suggestions. I even had to ask people to <br/>\nSTOP suggestions at one point because they were coming so fast! <br/>\nThat&#39;s really great, & I appreciate every bit of it. I know I was a <br/>\nbit short at times because of the frustration I was feeling (sorry), <br/>\nbut I really did appreciate all of it -- just wanted to let eveyone <br/>\nknow.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Oh, yeah, and Var? Don&#39;t marry Kerid (sorry Kerid)! I can make you <br/>\nmuch happier, & let you keep your freedom too (that goes for you, <br/>\ntoo, Anthonie -- just because I think Var&#39;s a hottie doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m <br/>\ncasting you aside, sexy)! Why can&#39;t we all live like the bards -- <br/>\nfree to share with all? Hehe, just kidding -- maybe ;).</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
