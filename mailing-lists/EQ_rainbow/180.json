There is no obvious good name that everyone will love.  It would have<br/>\nalready been suggested by now.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Online discussion takes way way longer than real life discussion.<br/>\nWe&#39;re not all sitting in a room together chatting.  A conversation that<br/>\nmight take two minutes in a room can take a week online, as people<br/>\nexchange ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Votes in online mediums take at least a week.  First someone has to set<br/>\na deadline for submission of named to be voted on.  Second, someone has to<br/>\nextract all those names and post a list.  Third, we have to wait 48 hours<br/>\nfor people to vote.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor all these reasons, I would like David to select a name based on our<br/>\ndiscussion, but not governed by any official selection process (like a<br/>\nvote).  I also think their should be a cap on discussion, and that cap<br/>\nshould be soon (like now perhaps 8)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we generally agree that the most imporant thing is that the guild<br/>\nexist with some name.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Chrisitna<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 29 Jul 1999, Joseph Normandin wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: Joseph Normandin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:josephn@...\">josephn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thats cool, but how do we know what poeple want?  are we going to ahve a<br/>\n&gt; vote?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -joe </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
