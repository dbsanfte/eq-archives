I&#39;m new to this list, and let me just say that I am very happy <br/>\nthat this list exists.  I&#39;m a lesbian in RL, and I&#39;m getting very tired of <br/>\nguys on EQ commentating on my character&#39;s &quot;nice ass&quot; or asking me to marry <br/>\nthem...so I&#39;m glad that this list is a space where we can all be joined in <br/>\n&quot;unity&quot; (I like that as the name for the guild).  I have a lvl 6 half-elf <br/>\npaladin on Rodcet Nife named Anaxilea, so I&#39;d be willing to join a guild on <br/>\nRodcet Nife.  I don&#39;t get much time to play EQ, so I&#39;d rather keep playing <br/>\nthis lvl 6 character cuz I level slooooow.  However, I&#39;d be willing to create <br/>\na new character on Brell if you need more people for that guild.  Again, <br/>\nthanks for starting this list, and a big hello to all of our wonderful, <br/>\nopen-minded straight friends on the list!<br/>\n<br/>\nCara</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
