It was called MegaPlat and<br/>\n&gt;consisted of a lottery (the grand prize was 665 plat) and raffles of <br/>\n&gt;various<br/>\n&gt;items (armor, jewelry, weapons, etc.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We had around 20 guild members on at the same time and that set a record <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;us, I believe. A lot of people have been moving over to the Rodcet server<br/>\n&gt;and this event was a great way for them to get some nice equipment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Joe and Rob did a great job of coordinating and running the event. Thanks<br/>\n&gt;guys.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If anyone else wants to create characters on Rodcet, we invite you to come<br/>\n&gt;join us. We&#39;ll be happy to help you out as you start new characters. We&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;quickly making Rodcet the San Francisco of Norrath and you are welcome to<br/>\n&gt;join the fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;David<br/>\n&gt;Kerik, Wood Elf Druid<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
