I&#39;m an EQ player, and the idea of being able to talk with other<br/>\nlike minded people is very exciting.  I really enjoy gabbing about the game<br/>\n;)  I&#39;ve been in EQ since phase 2 of beta.  I used to play on a MUD with the<br/>\nproducer of the game as a matter of fact (he was in my guild haha), and he<br/>\ngot me into it.  I&#39;ve migrated about the servers since I started, moved by<br/>\npacketloss problems and to follow friends.  I&#39;m fairly firmly rooted in<br/>\nTunare now, but I started on Brell Serilis tonight once I heard others were<br/>\ngoing to be there also.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m playing a dwarf cleric named Loar, so if you see me on, feel free to say<br/>\nhi!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
