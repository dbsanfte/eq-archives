Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t played EQ in a while.  I&#39;ve heard <br/>\nmuch about Role Playing servers and was curious about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the reasons I haven&#39;t played much, is that EQ feels a little to hack <br/>\nand slash to me, with the monsters generally tending to have most of the <br/>\nfun hacking and slashing (Wadkira dies way too often).  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnline Gaming appealed to me because you&#39;re playing with other people.  <br/>\nLet&#39;s face it, if I want to play by myself, I can play Might and Magic.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow would role playing work in EQ.  I&#39;d be interested in ways to gain <br/>\nexperience by interacting with other PC&#39;s.  Would guilds be given certain <br/>\nExperience Points that they can set up for use in Guild Quests?  Could <br/>\nindividuals give away a portion of their experience as a trade for an item? <br/>\n(Or would that last one just be misused).<br/>\n<br/>\nWith me falling dead every 15 minutes, I don&#39;t really get to advance very <br/>\nfar and it&#39;s hard to find others to group with at my level (12 I think).  <br/>\nAnd stop telling me to go to Blackburrow.  I *hate* it there.  But if <br/>\ninteracting with other players, both interpersonally and as part of the <br/>\ngame, was a larger focus, I might enjoy myself more.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
