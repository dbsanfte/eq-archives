So, let&#39;s make plans<br/>\n&gt; for this<br/>\n&gt; | Wednesday to meet in chat.<br/>\n&gt; |<br/>\n&gt; | I will make the channel &#39;Unity&#39; and the password will be &#39;rainbow&#39; in all<br/>\n&gt; lower case<br/>\n&gt; | (and case does matter.) If you have any trouble getting into the chat<br/>\n&gt; room, just<br/>\n&gt; | contact me directly, my chat name is Lari.<br/>\n&gt; |<br/>\n&gt; | Now we need a time to get 10 people all together at once. I am in Eastern<br/>\n&gt; Daylight<br/>\n&gt; | Time. I can be on as early as 4:30pm EDT, and as late as 10:30pm EDT. If<br/>\n&gt; we shoot<br/>\n&gt; | for early in that window, we can get some of our European members on, but<br/>\n&gt; will miss<br/>\n&gt; | the US Pacific time people who may still be at work. Let&#39;s tentatively set<br/>\n&gt; it for<br/>\n&gt; | 9:30pm EDT, this Wednesday. Please let me know if you will be able to<br/>\n&gt; attend the<br/>\n&gt; | chat at that time. If you cannot, then please tell me a time when you can,<br/>\n&gt; in case I<br/>\n&gt; | have to reschedule.<br/>\n&gt; |<br/>\n&gt; | We will work first to create the guild on Brell Serilis, and then spread<br/>\n&gt; it to other<br/>\n&gt; | servers fairly quickly.<br/>\n&gt; |<br/>\n&gt; | I would also suggest we need to describe the guild in OOC and IC terms.<br/>\n&gt; OOC it will<br/>\n&gt; | be a guild that is open to tolerant, fair-minded people who are GLBT or<br/>\n&gt; affirming.<br/>\n&gt; | But what do we want it to be &#39;in character&#39;. I&#39;d suggest that it certainly<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; | discriminate at all based on race or class. Also, do we want to promote<br/>\n&gt; RPing, or<br/>\n&gt; | just encourage it, or not bother with it? Or do we just want a guild to<br/>\n&gt; provide help<br/>\n&gt; | and friendship to our sister and brother guild mates (such as selling<br/>\n&gt; banded armor<br/>\n&gt; | at a steep discount and things like that?)<br/>\n&gt; |<br/>\n&gt; | If anyone has any better ideas or plans, please share them.<br/>\n&gt; |<br/>\n&gt; | Dedric of Ak&#39;anon<br/>\n&gt; | Gnome Necromancer of the 5th circle of life.<br/>\n&gt; | Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt; |<br/>\n&gt; |<br/>\n&gt; | --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; |<br/>\n&gt; | Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; | <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; | Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; |<br/>\n&gt; | ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; |<br/>\n&gt; |<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!
