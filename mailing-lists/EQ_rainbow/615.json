I believe if no guides are present<br/>\nit&#39;s automatically allowed, but if a guide is around they have a chance to<br/>\napprove or deny it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was guiding on Rodcet the other night and I got a name approval request<br/>\nfor &quot;Charismaqueer&quot; a high elf enchanter.  I denied it of course.  I then<br/>\nwatched in some amazement as, over the next 20 minute period, this guy<br/>\ntried every alternate spelling of charismaqueer he could think of.<br/>\nKarizmaqweer etc.  It was kind of amusing to just keep denying him his<br/>\nname over and over again as he tried to out guess the &quot;computer program&quot;<br/>\nthat he probably figured was denying his name.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a little update on my play server while I&#39;m here, I&#39;ve been having a<br/>\npretty good time but I&#39;m trying to relax a little.  I&#39;ve become very<br/>\ninvolved in running complicated raids on the plane of hate, plane of fear,<br/>\nvox, and nagafen.  It&#39;s really burning me out though so I&#39;m trying to take<br/>\na step back and chill.  If anyone has any questions about the outer planes<br/>\nor the dragons, I might be able to answer them though, so feel free to ask<br/>\n=)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a total asside to EQ, I visited my family this weekend and watched<br/>\n&quot;Common Ground&quot;, a nice queer positive little made for TV movie starring<br/>\nJohnathen Taylor Thomas and Jason Priestly amongst other people.  I liked<br/>\nit a lot. My brother was actually an actor in this with a fairly<br/>\nsignifigant part, he played a homophobic highschool student who assaulted<br/>\nand raped a queer highschool student (JTT).<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina (EQ addict)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
