I am a writer myself.  I would love to<br/>\nbe doing what you are doing!  Part of the fun of this game for me is<br/>\nfiguring out the story lines and talking to the npcs.  My writing is mostly<br/>\na hobby right now, but I have had minor things published here and there.  I<br/>\nhope one day to not be stuck doing this dreadful 8 to 5 job type thing<br/>\nreally.<br/>\n    I am glad there are a few gay people working at/for Verant and are open<br/>\nabout it.

I just joined a couple<br/>\n&gt; of nights ago.  My character is on Rodcet Nife.  His name is Txomin, a<br/>\ndark<br/>\n&gt; elf enchanter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What brings me to this server and guild now?  Well, I&#39;ve been playing EQ<br/>\n&gt; since beta 2, and when final release came around, I burned hard for about<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; year in it.  In that time I moved from Tarew Marr to Tunare, where I<br/>\nsettled<br/>\n&gt; and founded with a couple of friends one of the biggest and strongest<br/>\nguilds<br/>\n&gt; there, named Talisman.  I put forth a lot of effort in the guild, and as<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; leader I encouraged everyone who had problems--in game or real life--to<br/>\nlet<br/>\n&gt; me know and I&#39;d do everything I could to help.  I looked at my position as<br/>\n&gt; the caretaker of every guildmember&#39;s fun; for me I felt I had to ensure<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; everyone was having a good time.  It&#39;s a good way to be, and it made the<br/>\n&gt; guild a terrific place.  However, 60+ people all coming to you with their<br/>\n&gt; problems daily can be a burden after a while.  Couple that with a really<br/>\n&gt; REALLY bad time in my own life and complete burnout was innevitable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, around February of this year, I stopped playing.  I turned over the<br/>\n&gt; guild to a really good friend, and it&#39;s still going strong.  For myself, I<br/>\n&gt; divorced EQ for about 6 months.  I fixed my ailing real life (a year of<br/>\n&gt; unemployed, continuous EverQuest debauchery can set your existence into a<br/>\n&gt; tail-spin), got a job and moved to San Diego.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The break presented the perfect opportunity to move to Rodcet Nife and<br/>\n&gt; finally do what I&#39;d always wished I could have done, and that is join<br/>\nMystic<br/>\n&gt; Alliance.  I couldn&#39;t leave Tunare before, but now I&#39;m free to do it.<br/>\nOddly<br/>\n&gt; enough, part of the reason I&#39;m playing again is work related.  I&#39;m a<br/>\ncontent<br/>\n&gt; writer for Verant Interactive/Sony Online Entertainment now, so it&#39;s sort<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; part of the job!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, that&#39;s my story and I&#39;m sticking to it.  As I said, I live in San<br/>\n&gt; Diego.  I&#39;m not sure if anyone else lives here or not.  One of the unique<br/>\n&gt; advantages of my job is, I most likely will be attending some of the<br/>\nvarious<br/>\n&gt; EQ Player get-togethers around the country, particularly the one sponsored<br/>\n&gt; by Verant.  I believe the next one will be February on the East Coast<br/>\n&gt; somewhere (my old stomping ground), and likely I&#39;ll be there.  So who<br/>\nknows,<br/>\n&gt; I may be in a neighborhood near you in the future :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nice to finally be part of something I&#39;d always wished to join in on.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Clayton Kroh<br/>\n&gt; &quot;What a piece of work is a man!
