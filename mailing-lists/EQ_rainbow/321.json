The FBR is easy compaired to the boots. Najena almost<br/>\nalways<br/>\nspawns with it. However she doent alwasy spawn. Sometimes a Elmental spawns<br/>\nin her place, and no there is no such thing as Anticamping code. When me and<br/>\nMy group whent for the robes we tested it out. She spawned just as many<br/>\ntimes<br/>\nwhen we were on the other side of the water as she did when we were camping<br/>\nat her doorstep. That anicamping is a legioned not based on facts. Caused<br/>\nbecause some Npc&#39;s dont always spawn in fact they spawn randomly. so people<br/>\nstarted camping on the other side and poof she disided to show up that<br/>\ntime... and thus the legioned was born.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist members: don&#39;t miss out on the latest news at ONElist<br/>\nJoin our community member news update at<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
