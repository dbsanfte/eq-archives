My current <br/>\ncharacter is Garret, level 7 Rogue on Brell. Been having lots of fun <br/>\nwith him so far, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be even better when the Rogue <br/>\nchanges go live:)<br/>\nAlso I&#39;m working on getting better in Talioring, I&#39;ve been wanting to <br/>\ncheck out the better forms of Leather Armour, maybe we could <br/>\ncollaborate Christina since you have made Master (very <br/>\nimpressive:). I dont think Rogues can wear banded, I dont <br/>\nremember:)<br/>\nAnyway I look forward to seeing you all on wednesday at the birth <br/>\nof our Guild, Unity sounds like a fine name BTW. <br/>\nTake care all and look me up sometime...<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\nLonewolf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
