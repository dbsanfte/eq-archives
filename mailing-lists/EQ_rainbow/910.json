I am a member of the Mystic Alliance <br/>\non RN and have to say I have had a wonderful time with them.  Eveyrone <br/>\nis very friendly and helpful and looking out for each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guild is not strictly gay, but a majority of the members are and <br/>\nthose who are not are gay friendly.  Everyone is always willing to <br/>\nhelp when they can and there is no line between &quot;gay and straight&quot;  we <br/>\nare all simply &quot;guildmates&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get a chance, create a character and come on over for a visit. <br/>\n Don&#39;t have to join and if one of our lowbies or newbies is around you <br/>\nguys can group!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EQ_rainbow@y..., Christina Norman &lt;tina@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One idea you can do is transfering your characters.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No not really, you can&#39;t really transfer characters, but you can <br/>\nmake new<br/>\n&gt; people with the same look and the same class and the same name.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And you will find that the second time you play a class, it is much <br/>\neasier<br/>\n&gt; to progress than the first time!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I recommend everyone at least try playing on RN, to experience what <br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; like playing in the guild.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Christina<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Sun, 1 Apr 2001 sirenuvsavannah@y... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; While I would love to get to know all of you, I am having a hard <br/>\ntime <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with the idea of giving up characters I have rasied and grown to <br/>\nlove <br/>\n&gt; &gt; on Mithaniel Marr... so... if there are any GLBT players on that <br/>\n&gt; &gt; server, please feel free to look me up and say hi!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Quanyin (Female) Human Monk - 20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Pyderi (male) Half-elf Warrior - 8<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have been lucky enough to find one person on that server to talk <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to, and he&#39;s not even gay! so kudos to him.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, feel free to email me ... @ divamae@h...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Take care!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bryen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
