I keep trying <br/>\nto compare our new guild with the uber-guilds on The Nameless server and of <br/>\ncourse we come up short.  But we usually have around 4 people online, with as <br/>\nmany as 10.  Last weekend, I think, we grouped with our guildfriends (The <br/>\nNameless of Mercy) at SolA and we had enough people to completely fill 2 <br/>\nparty groups.  I think that&#39;s an exceptional headcount for a guild that&#39;s <br/>\nstill less than half a year old.<br/>\n<br/>\nCure my feelings of inadequacy as guildleader.  Tell me we&#39;re doing well on <br/>\nthe &quot;headcount&quot; test.  Heh.<br/>\n<br/>\n- SoulDreamer, Nameless Love guild, The Nameless server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
