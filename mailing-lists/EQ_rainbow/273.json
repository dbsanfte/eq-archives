I know several of you have mentioned you&#39;d be willing to<br/>\ndo it, so please tell me again if you want to do it, and let me know which server.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will attempt to get as many set up on Sunday the 15th, as I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\nDedric, lvl 9 gnome, Necro on Brell<br/>\nKerik, lvl 3 High Elf, Enchanter on Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
