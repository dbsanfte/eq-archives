I ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1103375067\">Hi Owen,<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a gay guild on Brell, namely the (now defunct) mystical alliance.<br/>\nI believe David (who may still be reading this list) is the guild owner. I<br/>\nhave an officer character on Brell still in greater faydark (perhaps in<br/>\nfreeport as well not sure) and I can add you to the guild if you would<br/>\nlike. Just email me and we can work out a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would encourage you to try Rodcet, but if you want to stay on Brell<br/>\nbeing in mystical alliance could be good as well. If we can get ahold of<br/>\nDavid I&#39;m sure he&#39;d be inclined to make you an officer as well so you<br/>\ncould add new people without havin to arranage through me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m playing on a new server these days, it&#39;s called Tholuxe-Paells or<br/>\nsomething sillylike that =) I am not playing very seriously. I can&#39;t play<br/>\non Rodcet by the way because I used to be a guide there so I&#39;m not allowed<br/>\nto play characters on that server. I&#39;m playing on this new server to hang<br/>\nout with a friend of mine who also plays there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, 23 Dec 2000, Owen DuBose wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Thanks to everyone who responded to my posting. I&#39;m sad to see that <br/>\n&gt; there are, apparently, so few gay/lesbian players on Brell; or at <br/>\n&gt; least who are also a member of this eGroup.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My friends and I *don&#39;t* want to change servers, so we are <br/>\n&gt; considering starting our own gay/lesbian guild on Brell. The problem <br/>\n&gt; is, there aren&#39;t enough of us.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know the process for starting a guild. My qustion is, for those of <br/>\n&gt; you involved in Nameless Love or Mystic Alliance, how did you get 10 <br/>\n&gt; people? Did you advertise in general (such as in a forum) or did you <br/>\n&gt; just happen to know 10 other gay/lesbian EQ players, or, well... how <br/>\n&gt; did it come together.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Considering what I&#39;m finding to be a generally gay-intolerant <br/>\n&gt; attitude on EQ, I hesitate to start a forum thread about a new gay <br/>\n&gt; guild or sit around on the chat server hoping 9 other gay people show <br/>\n&gt; up who want to start a guild.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m 33. I started RPG-ing in 1980 with D&D and Gamma World. I was <br/>\n&gt; away from RPG&#39;s for many years and even now EQ is my only RPG outlet. <br/>\n&gt; I played Magic: The Gathering for a while but it simply became too <br/>\n&gt; frickin expensive and, to me, pointless. When? When did the <br/>\n&gt; word &quot;gay&quot; become -- in the gaming crowd (which now seems to be made <br/>\n&gt; up of teeming hordes of 13 yr old boys with a lot of their parents&#39; <br/>\n&gt; money and No Clue) -- synonymous <br/>\n&gt; with &quot;lame&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;useless&quot;, &quot;weak&quot; and just about any and every <br/>\n&gt; other negative adjective?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I spent 15 minutes in Oasis of Marr the other day riding the virtual <br/>\n&gt; ass of some lame k3wl d00d because he made the /shout &quot;Somebody come <br/>\n&gt; kill this gay SG please!&quot; I proceeded to riddle him with questions, <br/>\n&gt; in /shout, such as &quot;How do you know he is gay?&quot; &quot;Does he mince when <br/>\n&gt; he walks?&quot; &quot;Is his name in lavender or pink over his head?&quot; &quot;Is his <br/>\n&gt; name Bruce?&quot; &quot;Is he listening to the Village People?&quot; Etc., etc. <br/>\n&gt; While my very tongue in cheek and often virulent replies ilicited <br/>\n&gt; some laughs, several people /shout-ed back stuff like &quot;eww&quot; <br/>\n&gt; and &quot;that&#39;s gross&quot;. Mainly because initially the player&#39;s response to <br/>\n&gt; me was &quot;Because he&#39;ll rip you a new asshole&quot;. My response to that <br/>\n&gt; was &quot;Well my boss does that and I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s a breeder&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was under the impression that tolerance was on the upswing, in <br/>\n&gt; general anyway. It seems like on EQ that isn&#39;t the case. Is this <br/>\n&gt; server specific or do any of the rest of you have problems with this? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Owen<br/>\n&gt; Grackk 16th lvl Ogre Shadowknight<br/>\n&gt; Talsen 9th level Barbarian Shaman<br/>\n&gt; Brell Serilis server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
