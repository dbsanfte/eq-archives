Long but doing it in one post :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Lora Roa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loraroa@...\">loraroa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway .. random points on previous suggestions:<br/>\n&gt; - &quot;Order of the Chosen&quot; is even on Brell, my Mage was involved but not key<br/>\n&gt; - I&#39;d also like to believe the Norrath culture is gay positive, where<br/>\nwhile<br/>\n&gt; a minority, subject to discrimination, after all *I* did grow up thinking<br/>\n&gt; it was all perfectly normal :)<br/>\n&gt; - If we don&#39;t vote or have some particapatory (sp?) method of choosing,<br/>\n&gt; some may feel slighted.  Though of course the eventual one chosen can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; possibly be everyones favorite.<br/>\n&gt; - I agree you should avoid handing the immature element an excuse to<br/>\n&gt; harrass on a platter.  &lt; Aside: I was subject to two on-line &quot;rapes&quot; in a<br/>\n&gt; previous MUD - interesting stories, and yes just some dumb kid and emotes,<br/>\n&gt; but it *does* ruin your evening no matter how much you realize its just<br/>\n&gt; some dumb kid. Two in six years of on-line RPing is a low rate .. but &gt;<br/>\n&gt; - I don&#39;t know about some GBLT/other mytical connection angle.  I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; feel any &quot;mystical connection&quot; to the GBLTs in my life, to me they&#39;re just<br/>\n&gt; family. :P  But perhaps if its explained in the RP as suggested?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And my own general suggestions:<br/>\n&gt; - After being subjected to the sense of humor in this group in the guild<br/>\n&gt; chat, perhaps a name with some humor?  The group seemed very good at that!<br/>\n&gt; &lt;my stomach still hurts!&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Perhaps we should add to the charter that you are expected to have fun?<br/>\n&gt; - As far as a diety Rp angle.  The women seem to have something going with<br/>\n&gt; Erollisi already &lt;ducks from Christina&gt;, if you read about the dieties<br/>\n&gt; Quellious seems to be the one most in-line with respect of differences.<br/>\nSo<br/>\n&gt; for an RP angle, something Quellious oriented maybe?<br/>\n&gt; - If we assume Norrath accepts all sexual orientations as normal facets of<br/>\n&gt; life, then *if* you grew up in this world (Norrath), what would a group of<br/>\n&gt; GBLTs (and friends!) call themselves?  What can we think of here?  The<br/>\n&gt; message I seem to hear is &quot;We all belong here and together&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I was the one with the thesaurus :)  So, going on the humor/joy/gay<br/>\n&gt; angle which I was asked to last night and trying to choose the simple<br/>\n&gt; English words with a medieval sound to them ...  Also looked up &quot;group&quot;<br/>\n&gt; type words .. no luck on synergy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Group Words: Society, Fellowship, Circle, Ring, Alliance, Voices, Spirits,<br/>\n&gt; Conclave, Band<br/>\n&gt; Medieval &quot;Gay&quot; Words: Mirth, Cheer, Felicity, Gambol, Merry<br/>\n&gt; Other descriptive words suggested: Mystic, Harmony, United (if not unity)<br/>\n&gt; Force/Soldiers: Force, Champion, Swashbuckler, Guards, Troop, Volunteers,<br/>\n&gt; Legion, Brigade, Corps, Company, Rabble, Horde, Tribe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Playing mix and match (and trying no to sound too &quot;nice&quot; for the RPers):<br/>\n&gt; The Merry Horde<br/>\n&gt; Legion of Mirth<br/>\n&gt; (well at least descriptive of the rabble in the chat room)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Lora, creating more fodder<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Transfer your big list to ONElist and earn $500!<br/>\n&gt; For program details, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
