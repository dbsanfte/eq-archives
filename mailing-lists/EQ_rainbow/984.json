(There&#39;s a fine, active message board<br/>\nthere). As far as officers, they&#39;d be Snapdragyn, Ompa, Taren, Gwynap,<br/>\nGunarr, Aethyra, Trinic, Marri, Gaiwan, Vargyr, Andelyve, Gaybriel, Leta, or<br/>\nArmande (if I&#39;m on...still have some time left on the current pay<br/>\nperiod...stop in now and then to say hi). If I left out any officers, I&#39;m<br/>\nsorry.
