So, let&#39;s make plans<br/>\nfor this<br/>\n| Wednesday to meet in chat.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| I will make the channel &#39;Unity&#39; and the password will be &#39;rainbow&#39; in all<br/>\nlower case<br/>\n| (and case does matter.) If you have any trouble getting into the chat<br/>\nroom, just<br/>\n| contact me directly, my chat name is Lari.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Now we need a time to get 10 people all together at once. I am in Eastern<br/>\nDaylight<br/>\n| Time. I can be on as early as 4:30pm EDT, and as late as 10:30pm EDT. If<br/>\nwe shoot<br/>\n| for early in that window, we can get some of our European members on, but<br/>\nwill miss<br/>\n| the US Pacific time people who may still be at work. Let&#39;s tentatively set<br/>\nit for<br/>\n| 9:30pm EDT, this Wednesday. Please let me know if you will be able to<br/>\nattend the<br/>\n| chat at that time. If you cannot, then please tell me a time when you can,<br/>\nin case I<br/>\n| have to reschedule.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| We will work first to create the guild on Brell Serilis, and then spread<br/>\nit to other<br/>\n| servers fairly quickly.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| I would also suggest we need to describe the guild in OOC and IC terms.<br/>\nOOC it will<br/>\n| be a guild that is open to tolerant, fair-minded people who are GLBT or<br/>\naffirming.<br/>\n| But what do we want it to be &#39;in character&#39;. I&#39;d suggest that it certainly<br/>\nnot<br/>\n| discriminate at all based on race or class. Also, do we want to promote<br/>\nRPing, or<br/>\n| just encourage it, or not bother with it? Or do we just want a guild to<br/>\nprovide help<br/>\n| and friendship to our sister and brother guild mates (such as selling<br/>\nbanded armor<br/>\n| at a steep discount and things like that?)<br/>\n|<br/>\n| If anyone has any better ideas or plans, please share them.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Dedric of Ak&#39;anon<br/>\n| Gnome Necromancer of the 5th circle of life.<br/>\n| Brell Serilis<br/>\n|<br/>\n|<br/>\n| --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n| <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n| Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n|<br/>\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n|<br/>\n| </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
