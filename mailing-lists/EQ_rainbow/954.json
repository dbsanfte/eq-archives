We hope to create a guild based on a welcoming<br/>\n&gt; gay / lesbian / bi / trans fellowship where any of us can play EQ<br/>\n&gt; without being subject to the anti-gay prejudice that we frequently<br/>\n&gt; encounter in Norrath.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re still formulating the charter and operating mode so you can<br/>\n&gt; definitely provide input regarding your ideas about a gay guild or<br/>\n&gt; your experiences in a gay guild such as the renown Mystic Adventurers<br/>\n&gt; on Rodcet Nife.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re currently using a Yahoo Club for contact -<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/gayandlesbianeverquestfolk.\">http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/gayandlesbianeverquestfolk.</a>  We&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; having a meeting in the chat room of that club on Monday June 11th at<br/>\n&gt; 8pm Central time (6pm PST) to discuss &quot;Stonewall Pride&quot; and how to<br/>\n&gt; get it running smoothly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Many of us have moved from other servers to The Nameless so we mostly<br/>\n&gt; have lowbie characters at this point - not aware of any over 20 yet -<br/>\n&gt; so start up a character on The Nameless and join us!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best wishes to all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Poppie Power (gnome wizard)<br/>\n&gt; Dandee Lyon (wood elf druid)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
