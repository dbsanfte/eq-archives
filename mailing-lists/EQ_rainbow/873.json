I keep <br/>\n&gt;trying<br/>\n&gt;to compare our new guild with the uber-guilds on The Nameless server and of<br/>\n&gt;course we come up short.  But we usually have around 4 people online, with <br/>\n&gt;as<br/>\n&gt;many as 10.  Last weekend, I think, we grouped with our guildfriends (The<br/>\n&gt;Nameless of Mercy) at SolA and we had enough people to completely fill 2<br/>\n&gt;party groups.  I think that&#39;s an exceptional headcount for a guild that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;still less than half a year old.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cure my feelings of inadequacy as guildleader.  Tell me we&#39;re doing well on<br/>\n&gt;the &quot;headcount&quot; test.
