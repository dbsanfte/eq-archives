Force of synergy can be taken in many<br/>\nways....synergy is the joining of energy or ideas, therefore the titlew<br/>\ncan be seen as the coming togethe of the ideas outlined in the charter, as<br/>\nwell as the energy of the poeple in the guild working towards the goals<br/>\noutlined in the charter.  In this sense even a dark elf neromancer, could<br/>\njoin our guild and seek the mutual respect or &quot;tolerance&quot;<br/>\n of all members as well as the poeple of Norrath at large.  this dosnt<br/>\nmean this Dark elf necro has to necesarily like or love the wood elves<br/>\naround, just respect and elarn from them as the charter describes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that these ideas may not work for everyone, but i think that<br/>\n&quot;spirit of harmony&quot; would work even less for people.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my personal case my 12th lvl Wizard (Fentus) is a neutral-good<br/>\ncharchter who would not want to join a guild that seeks Harmony between<br/>\nall people (he just dose not see this as relaistic or practical) but a<br/>\nguild that prmotes respect for poeple would be fine (especially since the<br/>\ndiversity he would then encouter could benefit him in his search for<br/>\nknowledge)<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, this guild name and charter would not necessarily be good for the<br/>\nevilest of evil, though they would be wecome to join.  but i dont think we<br/>\ncould createa guild that would be ok for EVERYONE.  But spirit of Harmony<br/>\nwould be a step in the opposite direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n-joe<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 29 Jul 1999, johnathan spectre wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;johnathan spectre&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jspectre@...\">jspectre@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Guild name:  Force of Synergy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; what happened to spirit of harmony?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com!<br/>\n&gt; If you join ONElist´┐¢s FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
