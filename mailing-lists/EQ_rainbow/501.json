He ignored it and threw it<br/>\n&gt; away.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In April he received another and threw that one away too. The<br/>\n&gt; following month the credit card company sent him a very nasty<br/>\n&gt; note stating they were going to cancel his card if he didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; send them $0.00.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He called them, talked to them, they said it was a computer<br/>\n&gt; error and told him they&#39;d take care of it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The following month he decided that it was about time that he<br/>\n&gt; tried out the troublesome credit card figuring that if there<br/>\n&gt; were purchases on his account it would put an end to his<br/>\n&gt; ridiculous predicament.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, in the first store that he produced his credit card<br/>\n&gt; in payment for his purchases he found that his card had been<br/>\n&gt; cancelled.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He called the credit card company who apologized for the<br/>\n&gt; computer error once again and said that they would take care<br/>\n&gt; of it. The next day he got a bill for $0.00 stating that<br/>\n&gt; payment was now overdue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Assuming that having spoken to the credit card company only<br/>\n&gt; the previous day the latest bill was yet another mistake he<br/>\n&gt; ignored it, trusting that the company would be as good as<br/>\n&gt; their word and sort the problem out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The next month he got a bill for $0.00 stating that he had 10<br/>\n&gt; days to pay his account or the company would have to take<br/>\n&gt; steps to recover the debt.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Finally giving in he thought he would play the company at<br/>\n&gt; their own game and mailed them a check for $0.00. The computer<br/>\n&gt; duly processed his account and returned a statement to the<br/>\n&gt; effect that he now owed the credit card company nothing at<br/>\n&gt; all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A week later, the man&#39;s bank called him asking him what he was<br/>\n&gt; doing writing a check for $0.00. After a lengthy explanation<br/>\n&gt; the bank replied that the $0.00 check had caused their check<br/>\n&gt; processing software to fail.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The bank could not now process ANY checks from ANY of their<br/>\n&gt; customers that day because the check for $0.00 was causing the<br/>\n&gt; computer to crash.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The following month the man received a letter from the credit<br/>\n&gt; card company claiming that his check had bounced and that he<br/>\n&gt; now owed them $0.00 and unless he sent a check they would be<br/>\n&gt; taking steps to recover the debt.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The man, who had been considering buying his wife a computer<br/>\n&gt; for her birthday, bought her a typewriter instead.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ======================================================<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Quick Wit:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Deep within a forest a little turtle began to climb a tree.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After hours of effort he reached the top, jumped into the air<br/>\n&gt; waving his front legs and crashed to the ground. After<br/>\n&gt; recovering, he slowly climbed the tree again, jumped, and fell<br/>\n&gt; to the ground.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The turtle tried again and again while a couple of birds<br/>\n&gt; sitting on a branch watched his sad efforts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Finally, the female bird turned to her mate.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Dear,&quot; she chirped, &quot;I think it&#39;s time to tell him he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; adopted.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
