I&#39;ve been playing EQ for awhile now and its nice to join a list dedicated to us gay players :-)  My name is Dewayne and I play on the Innoruuk server.  My primary character is 30th lvl druid named Khaav, but I have a lvl 13 twink enchanter named Maharet.  Feel free to give me a /tell if you play on Innoruuk.  I&#39;m not exactly open there but not exactly closeted, some of my guild and a few hunting buddies know.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I just started a new email list for gay eq players, one that I want to be primarily a roleplaying list.  RP stories are encouraged.  Steamy stuff is allowed but no porn.  To join, go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/EQ_Gays\">http://www.egroups.com/group/EQ_Gays</a> .   I look forward to chatting on both of these lists :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nKhaav Sundropped<br/>\nInnoruuk Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
