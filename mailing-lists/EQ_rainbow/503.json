Kiting simply allowed druids<br/>\nto level extremely quickly, and kill very powerful creatures.  However, in<br/>\nthe post kiting patch fix, druids are still a great class they just don&#39;t<br/>\nhave this advantage over other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDruids are still a great, versatile, class.  They can tank pretty good up<br/>\nto level 20, backing up their tanking with bolts, heals, and damage<br/>\nshields.  They are also excellent healers in any party up to level 40 or<br/>\nso.  Their evac ability means they&#39;re still usually welcome in really high<br/>\nlevel parties.  Their bolts are weaker than that of pure casters, but they<br/>\nare still pretty good.  Their teleports and SOWs are very useful, great<br/>\nfor exploring, and very useful to friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my overall conclusion is that druids are still one of the most fun, and<br/>\nuseful, classes in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 14 Oct 1999, Aguilar, Reuben wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Aguilar, Reuben&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:raguilar@...\">raguilar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Okay question: I am going to start a new character being that mine is<br/>\n&gt; becoming kinda blah..

I am looking for suggestions..<br/>\n&gt; at this point, I am playing a Mage .. and am looking to the ways of the<br/>\n&gt; Paladin, Druid or Ranger or cleric. I am gearing towards the Druid, because<br/>\n&gt; the cool ability to Teleport around later...
