Through<br/>\nmost on-line RPGs I&#39;ve been in usually at least 50% (used to be higher<br/>\neven) of the female characters *are* played by males.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the males who played male characters, and found out the player<br/>\nbehind the female on the wedding night was male did *really* flip out.<br/>\nAbout 1/4 got over it but were angry they had not been told earlier, and<br/>\nthe rest severed relations with both the female character and its player.<br/>\nOTOH, I have seen marriages of characters with males behind both characters<br/>\nwork very well and last years :)  But in this case the male playing the<br/>\nfemale revealed this early enough in the relationship that they were<br/>\ncomfortable and both players were good RPers and knew they could keep the<br/>\non-line romance just a role so it didn&#39;t threaten anyones sexuality.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the player behind the male was a very good RPer and well schooled in<br/>\nkeeping the character relationship seperate from his RL feelings, he&#39;ll<br/>\nprobably flip (mainly surprise), but get over it.  But expect him to be<br/>\nupset you waited this late to tell.  If he spoke a lot about his RL, and<br/>\nseemed to &quot;live his character&quot; then it may be best to *never* tell.<br/>\nBecuase then he&#39;ll flip and go really insecure.  Add this to the fact that<br/>\nmany young straight males are soooo insecure about thier sexuality, mention<br/>\nits a gay male behind the female and I&#39;d say odds of a &quot;serious flip out&quot;<br/>\nreally go up :)  I spent many a night up to 3-4 AM in chat talking with<br/>\nyoung males (18-30 is young in my book) who just found out thier on-line<br/>\n&quot;love interest&quot; was really a male.  In one case, even one old married guy<br/>\n;)  It seemed they really needed to talk it out with a female just to shore<br/>\nup thier insecureties. =)  And its happened at least a couple of dozen<br/>\ntimes .. so this seems quite a common occurence.  Roleplaying can really<br/>\nengage the emotions ... people unfamiliar with that are often the most<br/>\nunprepared for twists like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know the player, can he handle the truth? can the others that spent a<br/>\nlot of time flirting handle it when they find out?  or would it be a<br/>\nkindness to your friends to make a parting excuse and just never tell?<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck.  Its certainly not an easy situation, and very emotional all<br/>\naround. :(<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lora, ex RP &quot;den mother&quot;  Gah!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
