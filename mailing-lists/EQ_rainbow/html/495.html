<div id="ygrps-yiv-347172218">Hi Jerry,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that as well, I&#39;ve also heard people say that a level 49 wizard<br/>
successfully camped jboots very recently.  I&#39;m not sure whether it is<br/>
factually true that high level players can&#39;t camp jboots any more, or<br/>
whether that is just a rumor.  It isn&#39;t hard to imagine a high level<br/>
character killing drelzna 10 times in a row, not getting boots, getting<br/>
the note, and thus concluding that it was impossible for them to get boots<br/>
any more (when they were really just unlucky).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little suspicious that there is a level cap on who can get jboots<br/>
because that would be a totally new kind of approach to camping.  Until<br/>
now what a creature drops has not been affected by who kills it.  The fact<br/>
that creatures sometimes use items that they carry suggests that what a<br/>
creature carries is generated at spawn time, and not at time of death.  If<br/>
that is the case it would be difficult (though not impossible) to at time<br/>
of death change what the creature drops.  I&#39;m a computer programmer, I<br/>
tend to look at things from the perspective of &quot;how hard would that be for<br/>
me to do&quot;.  Programmers are lazy, they prefer easy fixes over hard ones.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying it isn&#39;t true, just that I&#39;m not convinced as of yet.<br/>

&gt; They are on drelzna for low lvl players, and if yer above a certain lvl you <br/>
&gt; get a letter instead telling you to goto rathe mtns... There is a lvl 35 or <br/>
&gt; so thief there that the high lvls can camp for them...<br/>

&gt; &gt;I am still trying to work out exactly what is going on with jboots.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I suspect (hope) that all that has been done is that besides killing<br/>
&gt; &gt;drelzna, you can now kill a high level mob to get jboots. It would make<br/>
&gt; &gt;sense, given how over camped boots are, that they would make an alternate<br/>
&gt; &gt;way of acquiring them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Someone told me that these wonderful boots have been made a QUEST item. <br/>
&gt; &gt;Is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this true?<br/>
