<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872870472">here are a few things i heard from Hraska from my guild, if any of it is true then we are in BIG trouble!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Chaos War (spoilers)  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Gods of Norrath *are* returning, and we are but soil beneath their feet. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard - I remind you that these are rumors so far, so any/all of it could be completely false. If you don&#39;t care to know, use your &quot;back&quot; button - otherwise, read on...<br/>

Spoiler Ahead!<br/>

Apparently, the following zones will be affected:<br/>
<br/>
Halas: will be shut off from travel completely. If you are in Halas when the Chaos War hits, your character will have to stay there until the city is opened again.<br/>
<br/>
Everfrost: Lady Vox will roam freely about the zone, showing her might and displeasure with anyone who crosses her path. Travel through the Peaks will be treacherous if not impossible, hence the need for Halas to seal itself up.<br/>
<br/>
Qeynos: Nagafen and/or Innorruk will destroy Qeynos, and it will have the look and feel of Cabilis - ruined buildings, scorched earth, and scarred walls. Vendors will still be around the city, but they will have little to sell.<br/>
<br/>
Surefall Glade: Will be a safe zone - war will rage around it, but the Glade will remain untouched.<br/>
<br/>
The Karanas: The Combine Empire, once thought gone forever, is returning using their vast knowledge of things arcane. But, to make sure that there is no interference, they will shut down teleportation in the Karanas completely. Gate spells and Port spells will work going *in*, but will not work going out.<br/>
<br/>
Highold Pass/Keep: Will be attacked and possibly destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
Misty Thicket/Rivervale: Will be destroyed<br/>
<br/>
The Oasis of Marr: Ever notice that blue beacon on top of the Spectre Tower? Everyone&#39;s best guess is that it&#39;s a Combine Teleport, but no one&#39;s figured out how to work it. Well, the Combine Empire hasn&#39;t forgotten, and they mean to use it.<br/>
<br/>
Freeport: Unknown, but a good chance it will be attacked.<br/>
<br/>
Feydwer: The Ring of Scale is dispatched to defend Elvenkind, and just in time, too. The Tier Dal have joined forces with the Crushbone Orcs, and are planning to invade Felwithe with armies of evil.<br/>
<br/>
South Kaladim: Another area supposedly untouched by the war, but nothing was said about North Kaladim.<br/>
<br/>
Kunark has major trouble brewing as Venril Sathir must defend his lands from the newly-returned Combine Empire. It may well be a three-way war, though, as the various tribes of Iksar vie for control in the troubled lands to the South.<br/>
<br/>
Vellious will supposedly be left untouched - no one dares Veeshan&#39;s wrath or that of her brood - not even the gods themselves.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard. Take it with a grain of salt (or several). I&#39;ve heard that the Chaos War will be as short as three weeks, possibly disrupting gameplay completely from time-to-time. If even a fraction of it is true, Norrath will never be the same.  <br/>
