I would&#39;ve absolutely LOVED to!  As it stood, I didn&#39;t do any <br/>
ceremonies.  At that time it was discouraged for a guide to do them <br/>
(or at least COMMIT to doing one).  And until guides become paid <br/>
employees and/or receive sensitivity training, I&#39;d be frightened of <br/>
the possibilities :)  Although the guides I had on the team were very <br/>
cool.<br/>

start getting cravings.  Then add another month on that to let the <br/>
cravings kick in.. you&#39;ll be back ;)  when I came back I did not <br/>
pursue the guiding.  I am now strictly PC only (although playing <br/>
Lanys T&#39;Vyl was fun .. and Dad said community theatre would get me <br/>
nowhere hehe).<br/>
