if you are on this weekend Look me up on Bristlbane and lets see about geting <br/>
the Guild started here. Also anyone that Would like to join the guild on here <br/>
let me know. I have three chars on the server, but will most likely be <br/>
playing two of the three. <br/>
<br/>
Wampir Keogh. most likely will not be playing. (takeing a break)<br/>
Windom. slight chance of playing<br/>
Zute, Lev 10 Ranger will defently be playing some. <br/>
<br/>
So look me up. Zute is curently residing in West Karena, but thinking about <br/>
relocating. Maybe to Freeport, East, West Commons.<br/>
<br/>
If I play Windom he is Defently Relocating. Prey is too spread apart in West <br/>
Karena for someone that doesnt have Track.<br/>
<br/>
Well Look me up when you have the time<br/>
Look forward to Meeting you all<br/>
