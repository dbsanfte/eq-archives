<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352927519">Well, I have some good and some bad news about the guild.<br/>
<br/>
The good news is that the mystery and problems with getting the guild set up<br/>
on E&#39;ci have finally been resolved. The bad news is we are probably going to<br/>
have to recreate the guild on Brell and Rodcet. Here&#39;s what happened.<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time, we submitted our guild with the revised name &quot;Mystic<br/>
Alliance&quot;. It was approved and I set it up on Brell Serilis. After setting<br/>
it up, I noticed that while I had asked for &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; to be set up,<br/>
they made me the guild leader of &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; (not that it is<br/>
MysticAL not Mystic). I didn&#39;t really worry about it figuring that somewhere<br/>
along the line, the Verant folks had added an extra AL to the name as I&#39;ve<br/>
seen plenty examples of their bad typing in the past.<br/>
<br/>
So, then we get a request from players on E&#39;ci to get the guild set up.<br/>
However, we find out that the Mystical Alliance guild is already set up<br/>
there. After some investigation by the GM Kyala, during which I ask her if<br/>
there is a guild on her list called &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; and she assures me<br/>
there isn&#39;t and that in fact, I am the verified leader of &quot;MysticAL<br/>
Alliance&quot; she tells me she will delete the &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; and recreate<br/>
it with me as leader.<br/>
<br/>
After two months, I find out that she has not only failed to delete the<br/>
guild, but is not the GM anymore. (Personally, I think she may have been<br/>
short-changing Verant on her hours because I could almost never find her<br/>
when she was supposed to be on. Maybe this led to her being fired -- I can<br/>
only hope.)<br/>
<br/>
The email I sent to Kyala was forwarded to the new GM who, miracle of<br/>
miracles, actually was online last night when I went to meet her to get the<br/>
guild thing cleared up. It still took an hour, but when she finally got to<br/>
me, she checked the list and found out that &quot;MysticAL Alliance&quot; was in fact<br/>
assigned not to me but someone else. I then asked if &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; was<br/>
listed. Initially, she said no but then she checked (I guess) some other<br/>
list and found that in fact there was a listing for &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; after<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
So, long story short, the original Brell GM who set us up made a mistake and<br/>
then Kyala compounded it with misinformation, but finally the GM named<br/>
Sal`Varae one E&#39;ci has fixed it. However, that means that we have the wrong<br/>
guild name on Brell and Rodcet and our web site.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, we just got the Rodcet Nife guild leadership transferred over to Joe<br/>
(Fentus) a half hour before this mystical mystery was solved.<br/>
<br/>
On Brell, I would like to get the guild recreated with the correct Mystic<br/>
Alliance name. I leave it up to the players on Rodcet to make that decision,<br/>
but I would recommend the same thing there so we don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>
the &#39;real&#39; guild leader guy of Mystical Alliance coming along and making us<br/>
delete it if he should find out it is a glbt guild.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I need to make arrangements to get the guild leadership transferred on<br/>
E&#39;ci over to whoever is going to be the leader. Haven&#39;t heard from you E&#39;ci<br/>
guys in awhile, email me directly and let me know when we can meet up in<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
As to getting the guild set up on the remaining servers. Apparently, the<br/>
GM&#39;s are not really checking to see who the guild leaders of record are<br/>
before they set the guild up. So, if you have volunteered to be the guild<br/>
leader on another server, go ahead and petition to see if you can get them<br/>
to guild you. Just make sure you use the name &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot;. Then let<br/>
everyone on the list know what you&#39;ve done and how they can get into the<br/>
guild.<br/>
<br/>
thanks and hugs to all.<br/>
