<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080745272">Hi everyone!  I&#39;m new to this list, and let me just say that I am very happy <br/>
that this list exists.  I&#39;m a lesbian in RL, and I&#39;m getting very tired of <br/>
guys on EQ commentating on my character&#39;s &quot;nice ass&quot; or asking me to marry <br/>
them...so I&#39;m glad that this list is a space where we can all be joined in <br/>
&quot;unity&quot; (I like that as the name for the guild).  I have a lvl 6 half-elf <br/>
paladin on Rodcet Nife named Anaxilea, so I&#39;d be willing to join a guild on <br/>
Rodcet Nife.  I don&#39;t get much time to play EQ, so I&#39;d rather keep playing <br/>
this lvl 6 character cuz I level slooooow.  However, I&#39;d be willing to create <br/>
a new character on Brell if you need more people for that guild.  Again, <br/>
thanks for starting this list, and a big hello to all of our wonderful, <br/>
open-minded straight friends on the list!<br/>
