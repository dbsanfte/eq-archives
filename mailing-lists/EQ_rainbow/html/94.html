<div id="ygrps-yiv-659603213">In your mail you neglect to say what timezone you are in. Don&#39;t forget<br/>
there&#39;s a few international players out there! I for one am from England, so<br/>
if you are stateside, I would very rarely be able to play during guild time.<br/>

Subject: [EQ_rainbow] Hi from List Owner + Guild Stuff<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; From: Christina Norman &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:tina@...">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi I&#39;m Christina, and I started this list, and to quote Big Gay Al, I<br/>
&gt; think it&#39;s just SUPER that so many people have joined recently 8)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Regarding the guild, I think it would be a great idea to have it on Brell<br/>
&gt; Serelis.  You have to start some where new to make things fair for<br/>
&gt; everyone.  I have a 9th level enchanter on Brell.  I have been power<br/>
&gt; leveling.  Her name is Luna.  I also have a 30th level druid on Mithanial<br/>
&gt; Marr named Iuna.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some people are concerned about leaving their servers.  Don&#39;t! My<br/>
&gt; suggestion is that we have two official guild adventuring times (i.e.<br/>
&gt; Thursday evenings, and Sunday afternoons).  That way you can play on Brell<br/>
&gt; during those times to hang out with your amazing queer guild friends.  You<br/>
&gt; can play on the other server othe times.  The bigest benefit of course is<br/>
&gt; that when one of those servers goes down, you won&#39;t be spending hours<br/>
&gt; staring at the server list waiting for your one server to come back!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just created a guild on Brell for my other mailing list, EQ_women.  It<br/>
&gt; was pretty easy, and I was approved within 24 hours.  The guild is called<br/>
&gt; Sisterhood of Erollisi.  I don&#39;t want to be guildmaster of two guilds<br/>
&gt; though, so I hope that someone else will volunteer to run the queer guild.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for the name of the guild, instead of a subtle &quot;hey does that mean<br/>
&gt; queer?&quot; name, I personally like a name that is symbolic of who we are.<br/>
&gt; How about &quot;Unity&quot;.  It&#39;s short, it&#39;s simple, and I think being unified is<br/>
&gt; a great general concept for us to present, as gay lesbian bisexual<br/>
&gt; transgendered and supportive straight people.  I&#39;d suggest calling us<br/>
&gt; &quot;Rainbow&quot; but lets face it, that sounds silly for a guild name.  Anyone<br/>
&gt; else have any ideas?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is obviously interest in a guild, so I&#39;d really like to see one get<br/>
&gt; made.  It&#39;s hard in an environment like this to really elect or appoint<br/>
&gt; someone to run a guild.  So, what I&#39;d like to suggest is that if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; willing to be the guildmaster please reply to this email to the list and<br/>
&gt; say &quot;I&#39;m willing to run the guild&quot;.  Also list three reasons why you think<br/>
&gt; you&#39;d be good at running the guild (i.e. previous experience, no social<br/>
&gt; life).  Rather than have a vote which doesn&#39;t make much sense when we<br/>
&gt; really barely know eachother, if everyone is ok I&#39;ll just pick one of the<br/>
&gt; people to do it.  Really running a guild isn&#39;t that big a thing, you just<br/>
&gt; have administrative duties, the most important thing is that you&#39;ll play a<br/>
&gt; lot on the server.  The important thing is that we get the guild going.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I must get to sleep, good night!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Christina<br/>
