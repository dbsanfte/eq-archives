<div id="ygrps-yiv-964965313">My Girlfriend was offered a job back home (her home, Washington, <br/>
Seattle area) and is leaving in 10 days :o( I plan on going out in <br/>
late September, hopefully by then she can find a roof for us that&#39;ll <br/>
let us keep our 2 monster dogs (well mines a monster dog, hers only <br/>
is if you don&#39;t have mine standing next to him like a Barbarian next <br/>
to an Ogre :o)  ) Then all we&#39;ll have to worry about is finding a job <br/>
for me....hmmmmm, but hunny, I can sell this stuff on eBay, this IS a <br/>
job! hehee ok, that wont happen...not much a lvl 14 Warrior can sell <br/>
to keep more than the EQ bill payed :o) guess it&#39;s to the classifieds <br/>
for me, I HATE job hunting! interviews suck....anyway, you&#39;ll be <br/>
seeing a lot more of me in-game after the 6th of August until Sept <br/>
25th or so :o) and then back to the &#39;oops girlfriends home, gotta <br/>
go!&#39; <br/>
/em logs, powers down, runs out to the TV &#39;What, EQ? no, I&#39;m saving <br/>
my playing time for later *snicker* &#39;<br/>
<br/>
ok, sure your tired of this by now :o) I&#39;ll let you get on with things<br/>
<br/>
/em waves to the rainbow<br/>
/em staps to attention & Salutes Mystic Alliance<br/>
