&gt;Hail and well met I am also on the Tunare server, but my character there is<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, if you see me about say hi to me anyway. Shalka is a lot more forgiving of necromancers than my 17th level Paladin, Kiowa. (but she&#39;s on the Veeshan server and I don&#39;t play her a lot anymore.)<br/>

Actually, Shalka has been over in your neck of the woods fighting the cats on kerra island with some of my lower level friends. Maybe I&#39;ll see you =)<br/>
