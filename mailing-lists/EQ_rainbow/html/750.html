<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952544912">Howdy.  Glad to find this group.  I was pointed here by Gaydari/Anoka.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the one who&#39;s trying to create a queer guild on The Nameless <br/>
Server.  I&#39;ve already picked out &quot;Nameless Love&quot; as its name.  <br/>
Catchy, eh?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping that I can snag a few people from here willing to help us <br/>
set up shop on the server.  I need at least 10 concurrent people to <br/>
sign on long enough to create the guild.  Anyone willing to donate at <br/>
least that much time to the cause?  :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you can read the charter I typed up for it at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://antinomy.org/nameless.html">http://antinomy.org/nameless.html</a> .  Be forewarned, this site works <br/>
only when my pc is not booted into Win2000 to play games (including <br/>
EQ).  When I&#39;m not goofing around, I have it booted to BeOS with the <br/>
webserver running.  So if the address doesn&#39;t connect, just try again <br/>
later.<br/>
