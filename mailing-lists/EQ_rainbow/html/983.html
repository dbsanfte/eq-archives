<div id="ygrps-yiv-252741145">Hey Tasco!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if Mystic Alliance even exists. Did some searching <br/>
around and I *think* they formed &quot;Nameless Love&quot; on the Nameless <br/>
server.<br/>
<br/>
Currently NL has about 6-8 active members (that I know of) and we <br/>
ROCKED last night! We had a full group. Everyone&#39;s got characters in <br/>
the 7-14 range... so groupings easy. A few higher level people, and <br/>
their great for the assists.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, if you find anyone in Mystic Alliance lemme know, otherwise <br/>
come join us on the Nameless!<br/>
<br/>
Current officers that i know of are Fliq and Galadorn. Check out <br/>

&gt; Morning everyone !<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve just created a character on Rodcet Nife and am very interested <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; joining Mystic Alliance. Can someone give me a list of who to look <br/>
for on<br/>
&gt; the server that can bring me into the guild ? I&#39;ve been on Mith <br/>
Marr for the<br/>
&gt; last 18 months and have been meaning to come to Rodcet Nife for a <br/>
long time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
