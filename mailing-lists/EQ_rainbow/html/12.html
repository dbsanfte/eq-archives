<div id="ygrps-yiv-359397527">And it&#39;s cool to see this list actually get some use.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Alex, a 31-year-old webmaster (yes, another IT person) in Seattle (at <br/>
least, for now...) who plays a Dark Elf Necromancer on The Rathe (and might <br/>
be starting another on Rallos Zek to play in the Straylight Saga, and see <br/>
what PvP is actually like with decent RPers).<br/>
<br/>
The whole gender/sex thing has NOT come up on The Rathe - but then, T.R. <br/>
seems to be a very, very laid-back server (at least in Neriak/Nektulos).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m slowly converting the rest of my department to playing EQ, specifically <br/>
Dark Elves...so we&#39;ll band together in a few weeks and start terrorizing the <br/>
rest of the server.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone&#39;s on, give me a /tell (character name Skarrin, of course).  The <br/>
character hates all non-D.Es...*I*, however, am FAR more civil.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
