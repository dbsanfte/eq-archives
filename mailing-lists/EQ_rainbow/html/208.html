<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323953678">I like the story as well, and I agree with Christina that we don&#39;t need to be<br/>
outcasts. As far as names for the women in the history, there&#39;s a couple I<br/>
have in mind, but need to look up tonight before posting.<br/>
<br/>
In reading your message, Christina, another name came to mind &lt;as she<br/>
cautiously tosses it into the fray&gt;: Mystic Alliance<br/>
<br/>
I think the GLBT-related names have pretty much been dropped in discussion by<br/>
most people. This name is role-play appropriate, it is somewhat mysterious and<br/>
the alliance part is what we are about. There is nothing good/evil impliant in<br/>
the name, nor any specific class or race.<br/>
<br/>
Although the GLBT link may not be apparent in any name chosen, it is easy<br/>
enough to add symbolism to any graphics/logo associated with a guild site.<br/>
Granted, it wouldn&#39;t be visually attached to our names in the game, but if<br/>
people want to know, they&#39;ll ask or look for a website for information.<br/>
<br/>
As far as publicity for the guild once things are a bit settled, PlanetOut<br/>
might be a great online zine to contact. Their turnaround time for getting<br/>
information out is much quicker than the print media. I think they may also<br/>
have links to GLBT websites, which would be great when we have one for the<br/>
guild. I can&#39;t recall if there is a gay-related news service bureau. Some<br/>
individuals were trying to create one a while ago. The BBC is very queer<br/>
friendly and could be interested in a story, especially if we wish to reach<br/>
our brothers and sisters in the EU. Wired may also be a good place to reach<br/>
GLBT gamers and they have their email newsletters as well.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed chatting with you all in the guild formation last night. This is the<br/>
start of something really great.<br/>

I&#39;m fine with this story. I don&#39;t see the need for us to be outcasts <br/>
though. I personally prefer to assume that Norathian culture is generally <br/>
accepting of diverse sexual orientation, and that players who express <br/>
otherwise are members of some strange minority. <br/>
<br/>
One thing I would like to see in terms of roleplay is that GLBT and <br/>
positive people share a kind of bond that is manifests itself as a <br/>
tangible spiritual connection. Something along the lines of us all coming <br/>
together because we had this connection, and could sense it in eachother. <br/>
Kind of a mystic gaydar 8) I like it because this implies a reason for us <br/>
to exist in an organization beyond combating homophobia (which implies <br/>
homophobia is a force requiring an organization to combat). <br/>
