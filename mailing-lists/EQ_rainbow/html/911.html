<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029564517">I suppose being a transvestite is all fun and games -- a real hoot. Well, <br/>
let me tell you, I happen to know a cross-dresser or two, and they do not <br/>
strut about all day singing songs. Mostly, they ruminate on their condition <br/>
in life, specifically on what God was thinking when he gave them size <br/>
