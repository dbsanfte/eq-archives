<div id="ygrps-yiv-722726319">Greetings,<br/>
Our guild has now become official on Brell Serilis. Dedric now has &lt;Mystical<br/>
Alliance&gt; floating over his head.<br/>
<br/>
So far, we have volunteers to be guildmasters on the following servers.<br/>
E&#39;ci, Bristlebane, Rodcet Nife, Erollisi Marr and Innoruuk<br/>
<br/>
I will try to get as many of these set up on those servers as I can on Aug. 15th<br/>
when I return from my vacation.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, Christina has created a character on Brell named Ranebow who is<br/>
an officer in the guild and can get others into the guild on that server. Contact<br/>
her in game via her Luna character.<br/>
<br/>
Also, for those of you who have not heard, one of the most exciting things to<br/>
ever happen in the world of Norrath is a big mystery sequence of events involving<br/>
10 slaughtered Paladins in Freeport. This is a GM run event/quest. Check out the<br/>
news groups, etc. for more info. If you needed another reason to move to Brell,<br/>
this is it.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
David</div>
