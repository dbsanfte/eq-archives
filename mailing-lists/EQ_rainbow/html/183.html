<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947316679">well i guess that would be fine, I just hope the name chosen works for a<br/>
lot of people, i dont think a vot would take that long if david complied<br/>
the list today (more work for you ehehehe) and then we voted tomorrow, and<br/>
the deciosn could be sent out on saturday.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here are some thoughts on our decision making process for the name of our<br/>
&gt; guild:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. There is no obvious good name that everyone will love.  It would have<br/>
&gt; already been suggested by now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2. Online discussion takes way way longer than real life discussion.<br/>
&gt; We&#39;re not all sitting in a room together chatting.  A conversation that<br/>
&gt; might take two minutes in a room can take a week online, as people<br/>
&gt; exchange ideas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3. Votes in online mediums take at least a week.  First someone has to set<br/>
&gt; a deadline for submission of named to be voted on.  Second, someone has to<br/>
&gt; extract all those names and post a list.  Third, we have to wait 48 hours<br/>
&gt; for people to vote.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For all these reasons, I would like David to select a name based on our<br/>
&gt; discussion, but not governed by any official selection process (like a<br/>
&gt; vote).  I also think their should be a cap on discussion, and that cap<br/>
&gt; should be soon (like now perhaps 8)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think we generally agree that the most imporant thing is that the guild<br/>
&gt; exist with some name.<br/>
