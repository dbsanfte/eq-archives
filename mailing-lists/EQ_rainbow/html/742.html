<div id="ygrps-yiv-1626017732">Extra ram will help on any graphic application.  Personally I have a pIII 450 with 256 ram.  I also noticed the frame rate problem in Kunark (often referred to as &quot;lag&quot; by many people), and bought a Creative Labs Anihilator Pro - one of the best 3d cards on the market.  I had too many problems with voodoo cards and will never go back.<br/>

no authority here, but I would say upgrade you RAM first...that is <br/>
major factor in zoneing times. then either video or sound, whichever <br/>
you think is more important (I would go video) as far as lag I have <br/>
noticed a lot more lately too, so it&#39;s not just you :o)<br/>

&gt;   OK, I&#39;m one of those that can turn it on & run it, but don&#39;t know <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; thing about what&#39;s inside. I THINK mine has an AMD whatever chip -- <br/>
&gt; 550 thingies if I remember correctly. I know the 3D whats-it is one <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s either not actually listed for EQ, or is buried deep in the <br/>
&gt; compatability list on the main site -- not one listed right on the <br/>
&gt; Kunark box, at any rate. Same for the sound card. I also have 64 <br/>
RAM, <br/>
&gt; & a 56k modem. I have no norrathly idea how far I am from my isp, <br/>
or <br/>
&gt; even how to find that out. Oh, the comp itself is a Compaq Presario <br/>
&gt; something-or-other.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   SOOooo... what piece of this should I look to upgrade 1st in <br/>
order <br/>
&gt; to get better run of EQ? I think most of you know I am the slowest <br/>
&gt; zoner in the guild, & lately I&#39;ve been having worse problems with <br/>
lag <br/>
&gt; & ld than usual (which may be isp-load related & not something I <br/>
can <br/>
&gt; upgrade, but I don&#39;t know). This is death for a bard, & making it <br/>
&gt; really tough to twist songs. I just bought the comp 2 months ago, <br/>
but <br/>
&gt; could upgrade some piece, I think. Can&#39;t switch isp, since I got a <br/>
&gt; discount for signing up with them for 3 years.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Thanks for any helpful advice!<br/>
