<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813999779">Hello all,<br/>
    I do believe I finally have the proof which tells us that *yes* Christians are insane.<br/>

    According to this article by Landover Baptist Church, the life sized Jar Jar Binks doll is a satanic doll with the sole purpose of being a masterbation toy for children. They also accuse Star Wars: Episode 1 of having subliminal sexual innuendos.<br/>
    Of course I could be wrong and the Landover Baptist Church could just be a big ol&#39; joke, this I actually hope as Christians scare me enough already. I went to the San Francisco Gay Pride Parade and found people with big banners saying &quot;Jesus saves, repent your sins and Jesus will hold you with his own&quot; and megaphones shouting &quot;boo boo boo.&quot;<br/>
    Anyways, I haven&#39;t introduced myself, I&#39;m a very closeted, 16 year old guy, and I consider myself extremely confused. Right now I find myself pretty much 50/50 in the bisexual area (It&#39;s a sliding scale ya know). The twist to it all is that I may or may not be (I haven&#39;t either convinced myself, admitted it or gotten over it) transgendered, or as I like to say &quot;transi.&quot; I won&#39;t go into it &#39;cause it&#39;s a confusing lot. As from above you should&#39;ve guessed, I&#39;m from San Francisco and am currently graduated from High School and looking to go to an Art College while working at a friends company beta testing new games. <br/>
    I was in beta phase 4 but have never found myself totally interested in a character so right now I&#39;ve got Lissuet (12 Shaman) and Xaelie (12 Enchanter) on the Innoruuk server, Eshu (10 Bard) on Veeshan and numerous other characters all over the place. Right now myself and my friends are forming a Solusek Ro worshipping guild (Bards and Wizards only) that will be going up on the Racewar server when ever Brad (whom I now believe to be a buffoon) get&#39;s around to finishing the in-house beta testing. Anyone intersted in that look to me down below.<br/>
    I say he&#39;s a buffoon because not only has he given multiple answers as to when the racewar server is coming out (stick to one story Brad) he recently said when confronted on him using his certain items on a certain raid of a certain ice dragon &quot;As for the Fiery Avenger it is a quest. Green Splintered Platemail I *believe* is in the game *let me check*.&quot;<br/>
    Enough of that ranting. I find myself only interested in EQ anymore for the roleplay aspect so anyone who want&#39;s to do that sorta thing in game just tell me and I&#39;d be happy to. I&#39;m always looking for some sort of a storyline and I&#39;m sure someone in this list is interested in that so drop me a line. ICQ for me is 2312662<br/>

Thanks for listening to my rather large post,<br/>
