<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458076332">You won&#39;t believe what happened last night! A friend of mine got burned out<br/>
playing his 35th level Dwarf Paladin and gave him to me to play. As I was<br/>
traveling around I ran into someone he had gamed with. The man was very<br/>
happy to see &#39;me&#39; on line again and promptly told me of everything that had<br/>
happened to him in the last while. Not wanting to embarras him I played<br/>
along. He noticed my character hadnt any of the neat things he used to have<br/>
and offered to help me out. He gives me SEVERAL backpacks FULL of magic<br/>
Items and THEN takes me to the bank and SHOVELS 1600 pp into my pockets! I<br/>
nearly faint! I thank him and promise to group with him soon as he<br/>
camps..waves and POOFS out. Man! I think Im drunk on money! I was actually<br/>
ENCUMBERED by the MONEY he gave me! (160 lbs worth!)<br/>
