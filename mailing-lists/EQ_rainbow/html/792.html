<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751164447">Hey Vince, I&#39;m also from Toronto, small world...great city! =D Maybe I&#39;ll<br/>
see you online some time.<br/>

You can always try making a character on Rodcet, and you don&#39;t have to<br/>
give up your Tribunal characters.  It will become clear with a little bit<br/>
of playing which server you prefer =)<br/>

&gt; Greetings:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just found out about EQ Rainbow through a long and contentious thread<br/>
&gt; started on an Everquest newsgroup. My first response to hearing about EQ<br/>
&gt; Rainbow made me laugh out loud: &quot;My God, there are others like me out<br/>
&gt; there!&quot; I had wondered if there were any other gay/lesbian players<br/>
&gt; around (I certainly hadn&#39;t met them).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am Vince Bowes, a Branch Supervisor of a public library in Toronto,<br/>
&gt; Canada. I&#39;ve been playing EQ off and on for about eight months. I have<br/>
&gt; two characters I play frequently on the Tribunal server, but I am<br/>
&gt; strongly considering ending them and starting over on the RN server<br/>
&gt; because I am really curious about the Mystic Alliance...but it will be<br/>
&gt; hard to drop my level 17 druid, Kestrelle. But it would be worthwhile to<br/>
&gt; talk to other gay players and be part of a truly &#39;open&#39; guild. Are there<br/>
&gt; any openings for a high elf cleric in the ranks? That&#39;s a class/race<br/>
&gt; combo I have been eager to try for some time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cya in Norrath folks!<br/>
