<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476644672">Last night Ompa & I (Snapdragyn) were hunting in the Oasis. When we <br/>
went to camp, I suggest that we camp a bit up the side of one of the <br/>
pillars in the water (it was the 3rd one, I think), as that seemed a <br/>
safe place. Well, when I logged in this morning for my pre-work fix, <br/>
the 1st thing I saw in guildchat was Ompa saying &#39;I have 24 hours to <br/>
get my corpse, right?&#39; Doh!<br/>
<br/>
  It seems that the dastardly Lockjaw had been waiting for her to <br/>
awaken, knowing that she would be slightly groggy & not yet up to her <br/>
usual battle prowess. Such vile tactics cannot be tolerated! I call<br/>
on all Mystic Alliance members on Rodcet to join me in avenging our <br/>
companion! LOCKJAW MUST DIE!<br/>
<br/>
  What: Lockjaw Hunting Party<br/>
  Where: Oasis (duh), Rodcet<br/>
  When: Tonight (8/9), starting at about 5:30 PDT (&#39;cause that&#39;s when <br/>
    I get home :p )<br/>
  Who: Any willing to avenge our companion, but be aware that I&#39;m not <br/>
    sure of Lockjaw&#39;s level -- Ompa is 15, so maybe enough of us in <br/>
    that range would be OK?<br/>
  Why: For the honor & glory of MA!</div>
