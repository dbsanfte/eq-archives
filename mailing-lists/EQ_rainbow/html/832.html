<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144037233">WHAT:  &quot;Nameless Love&quot; guild creation ceremony<br/>
WHEN:  this Sunday at 3pm Central time<br/>
WHERE:  tunnel in Northern Desert of Ro on The Nameless server<br/>
WHO:  everyone who wants to join in the festivities of guild creation<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m cross-posting this email to BML, gamebears, local radical faeries, <br/>
and EQ Rainbow)<br/>
<br/>
Well, our guild has been approved!  My thanks to all the newly arrived <br/>
bears who helped us pass the first hurdle of guild approval.<br/>
<br/>
We are now ready for actual guild creation of &quot;Nameless Love&quot; on The <br/>
Nameless server.  The GM for our server has Fri and Sat off of work, so <br/>
we will meet Sunday instead.  We welcome everyone who wants to attend <br/>
this special event!  After all, how often do you get to be there for a <br/>
gay guild creation?  :)<br/>
<br/>
We will gather at November 12 Sunday 3pm Central time.  Because of <br/>
Verant&#39;s new annoying guild creation rules, everyone MUST be <br/>
&quot;physically&quot; at the same location for this event!  This time, I&#39;ve <br/>
picked the tunnel entrance in the Northern Desert of Ro.  This location <br/>
is relatively close to teleport sites, it&#39;s safe for both newbies and <br/>
dark races from random attacks during the socializing, and there&#39;s not <br/>
too much other chatter in the zone.<br/>
<br/>
Please have your character there promptly at 3pm.  If necessary, move <br/>
there prior to Sunday and then camp in the spacious tunnel to await the <br/>
celebration.  If you need teleports beforehand, send a message to <br/>
SoulDreamer in game and I can hook you up with a druid or wizard.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll bring plenty of Brandy and Underfoot Triple Bock to share with <br/>
everyone.  (I wish I could brew some elven wine for this special <br/>
occasion, but I&#39;ve never had any luck foraging the morning dew <br/>
ingredient!)  I also have some bear meat available for bear sandwiches.  <br/>
(mmmmmm.  bear sandwiches.  *woof*)  If anyone wants to hunt at the <br/>
desert oasis for alligator meat, I&#39;ll have the sauces and spices ready <br/>
to fix up some tasty pickled gator.  We&#39;ll also try to have party favors <br/>
available for everyone: armor, weapons, jewelry.  Not much in the way of <br/>
twink items, I think, but all useful stuff for budding adventurers.<br/>
<br/>
All future announcements about the guild will be posted to our website <br/>
at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sweetvision.com/~namelesslove">http://www.sweetvision.com/~namelesslove</a> under the discussion board.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to see you there on Sunday!  My thanks to everyone for the help <br/>
they&#39;ve already given to make this event possible.<br/>
