<div id="ygrps-yiv-157713350">Hey great list Sandy,<br/>
<br/>
Id like to add a few more hints to this list..<br/>
<br/>
When you Con, be sure to pay attention to wording. ie, cocopuff views you<br/>
amiably, warmly.. or threateningly, scowling ready to attack. The colors<br/>
help to see how dead you can be for trying to kill the person, but this is<br/>
key in determining if you are KOS by what they say and you being their<br/>
doomed prey.  There has been many times where i was KOS because i saw red<br/>
and didn&#39;t read the con wording.<br/>
<br/>
For Magicians, use hotkeys for your pets. Ie, create a hotkey that tells<br/>
your /pet attack, /pet backoff. This way you can send pull and command your<br/>
pet with one button. Its very easy and very effective and can save your life<br/>
<br/>
Put the loc as a hot key. This way if you are doomed.. example you are<br/>
getting mauled and you know you can&#39;t make it to zone and are going to bite<br/>
it, hit the /loc key to get your location before you die. This way you can<br/>
write it down and make your corpse easier to find. This is a lifesaver trust<br/>
me..<br/>
<br/>
Always be generous when you can..I am mage and plenty o people ask for a<br/>
bind, and bandages, daggers food water.. so on.. When I can, I do it, I<br/>
never charge but always accept donations. (key word if i can or i am waiting<br/>
for someone, ill do it-kindness pays good rewards and frienships and the<br/>
occasional good item are helpfull<br/>
<br/>
Be SOCIAL!!  These people you meet in Norrath will prove helpfull to you in<br/>
game.. i have met people who gave me things just for speaking to them... so<br/>
kindess is always rewarding. There is plenty of anti-social people out there<br/>
and you never know, that person may save your hide oneday. I have helped out<br/>
plenty who are in need and they have helped me out some point later on in<br/>
game..Remember .. THE KARMA WHEEL SPINS FULL CIRCLE......<br/>
<br/>

Here are few tips for those on the list that are new to Everquest. THIS<br/>
list of &#39;rules&#39; has saved me more often than not. Hope they are useful to<br/>
you:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Someone yells RUN! - YOU RUN and DONT ask &#39;What?&#39; - If you ask what,<br/>
you usually DIE and then find out. Example - I was fighting something in<br/>
the desert...someone yelled RUN..I turned too look...I was stunned to see a<br/>
Sand Giant chasing after someone near me..VERY near me. They zoned...Sand<br/>
Giant saw me and Squashed me like a bug.<br/>
<br/>
2) If you are in a party and someone yells RUN..follow the above rule.<br/>
<br/>
3) If you are in a party and someone or everyone just isnt listening or<br/>
working together...DISBAND and leave those losers to die..because is you<br/>
don&#39;t, you will DIE with them.<br/>
<br/>
4) If you can buff someone, do so. Making friends can be fun and<br/>
profitable. They will remember you and probably help YOU out someday.<br/>
<br/>
5) Never be afraid (or too cautious) to try a new place to hunt or explore.<br/>
Meat and Potatos of EQ is exploring..fun fun fun!<br/>
<br/>
6) ALWAYS get a bind in a new city if you can. You&#39;d really hate having to<br/>
run all the way to a new continent just to get your things.<br/>
<br/>
7) CONs the bad guys before attacking! You may live longer.<br/>
<br/>
8) AVOID making a train and leading it by others as you try to ZONE FOR<br/>
YOUR LIFE! They WILL remember you and made get even later.<br/>
<br/>
9) Good rule of thumb - put at least 4 gold, a weapon, 4 water and food in<br/>
the bank...maybe a backpack if you can. Nothing like dying and coming back<br/>
poor, defenseless and hungry.<br/>
<br/>
Welp, those are some things that have served me well. If they help you too,<br/>
COOL!<br/>
<br/>
Love ya all!<br/>
