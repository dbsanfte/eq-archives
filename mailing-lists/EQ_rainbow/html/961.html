<br/>
Okay, here&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to do...and please don&#39;t be lame and<br/>
 spoil the fun. Do it. Copy (not forward) this entire e-mail and<br/>
 paste it onto a new e-mail that you will send. Change all of the<br/>
 answers so that they apply to you. Then, send this to a whole bunch of<br/>
 people you know INCLUDING the person who sent it to you. The theory is<br/>
 that you will learn a lot of little known facts about your friends.<br/>
 Remember to send it back to the person who sent it to you.<br/>
