<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871800809">I have yet to see anybody with Mystical Alliance on Brell so I <br/>
imagine you are correct in that it has probably been purged :( But if <br/>
anybody on Brell does ever see a character in MA and find out it is <br/>

Can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; remember who eventually wound up with it. With the guild purges for <br/>
guilds<br/>
&gt; with less than 10 members, I would imagine it may have been wiped <br/>
out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let me also encourage you to come over to Rodcet. My Druid, Kerik, <br/>
will be<br/>
&gt; glad to help you PL a bit to get up to speed again. Also there are <br/>
any<br/>
&gt; number of people who will gladly re-equip you on Rodcet too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi Owen,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There is a gay guild on Brell, namely the (now defunct) mystical <br/>
alliance.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I believe David (who may still be reading this list) is the guild <br/>
owner. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have an officer character on Brell still in greater faydark <br/>
(perhaps in<br/>
&gt; &gt; freeport as well not sure) and I can add you to the guild if you <br/>
would<br/>
&gt; &gt; like. Just email me and we can work out a time. </span></blockquote></div>
