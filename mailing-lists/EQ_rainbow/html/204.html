<div id="ygrps-yiv-679273886">But the guild is in the game, not in real life.  If the guild is based in<br/>
a real-life qualities and not on the game and role-playing then all we<br/>
need to do is writte each others names down and grou if we see each other<br/>
:)  By creating a guild name/charter that fits both role-playing AND<br/>
non-roleplaying styles we can include everyone, which is what i&#39;ve been<br/>
trying to do, but I tihnk i&#39;ve just made things really complicated and<br/>
sour so i guess I will bow out of this discussion now, see you in EQ!!!!:)<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t actually believe that name and charted need to be directly<br/>
&gt; related.  I don&#39;t believe that the name must imply the charter, though it<br/>
&gt; can.  I also don&#39;t believe our guild necessarily requires an intense, role<br/>
&gt; playing, charter.  We&#39;re all drawn together because we&#39;re LGBT, not<br/>
&gt; because beyond that we share the same focus or interests in terms of role<br/>
&gt; playing style.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think you have some good ideas here but i would like to know what you<br/>
&gt; &gt; would want our &quot;charter&quot; to say with all these different names.  the<br/>
&gt; &gt; charter is going to be just as important as the name...what would they be<br/>
&gt; &gt; in these cases?<br/>
