<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982003144">Hello everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing EQ for a few months now... wow - Have things changed! A <br/>
sense of community seems to actually take place over certain places.... neat.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a current practitioner of non-het sex but my first sexual experience <br/>
was with another boy, and I&#39;m dating a bi-sexual woman and we are both gay <br/>
friendly... well she kind of has to be doesn&#39;t she?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - she plays EQ occassionaly but not nearly as much as I do. I get <br/>
extremely pissed off at all the rants and /shouts and even /oocs that come <br/>
across my screen bitching about &quot;that fag Cros Treewind killed me for no good <br/>
reason.&quot; I try to keep things fair and inform them to please keep that kind <br/>
of talk to /tells or cut it out completely... that it&#39;s just not appropriate <br/>
behavior.... &lt;shrugs&gt; I get the feeling about 80% of these people I&#39;m playing <br/>
with are in 8th grade with faces full of zits, not that the pimples go away <br/>
... :) - but anyway -----<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice to have a forum for EQers that are at least gay friendly.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the forum and FYI - I&#39;ll also be starting a EQ-Pagan guild on the <br/>
new roleplaying server.... anyone interested?<br/>
