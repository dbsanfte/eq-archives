Ok, you&#39;re right. But if I *WAS* a straight man, and you *WERE* a straight<br/>
woman, then... uhm, then...well, I think that I could really, sorta kinda,<br/>
maybe teach you a thing or two..or maybe not...   :P<br/>

Don&#39;t hold any of this against me, ok? You know I love you more than my<br/>
luggage! It&#39;s just that I&#39;ve been in a real goofy mood these last few days.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s the fact that I&#39;m FINALLY getting within reach of level 8!!<br/>

&gt; if your straight *REAL* man is wanting to &#39;show&#39; Ompa anything I<br/>
&gt; think he may have some issues :op not including missing whatever he<br/>
&gt; may have been showing lol<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But that a DE Warrior might just grab her attention :oD that is if<br/>
&gt; Gypsiee isn&#39;t around...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; hehee only 2 now? I don&#39;t think your one of the grand offenders in<br/>
&gt; this subject :o)<br/>
