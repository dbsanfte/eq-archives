<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821382975">Hey Group!<br/>
     This list seems kinda quiet and full of higher levels, but I&#39;ll <br/>
give it a shot anyway: If anyone wants to get together and hunt some <br/>
baddies, let me know. I have a few lower level characters on MT. To <br/>
be specific: a lvl 15 Druid named Izidor, lvl 10 Shammy named <br/>
Zalumar, and a seductive lvl 10 Necro named Mortalia. They all solo <br/>
pretty well so far, but it would be cool to have a partner(s) once in <br/>
a while.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll admit that I need variety so I always create new charachters to <br/>
try out, but the ones mentioned are my permanent ones. I am usually <br/>
on 9-11PM Los Angeles time or late night on weekends. Just e-mail mr <br/>
or give me a tell in Norrath!                   <br/>
