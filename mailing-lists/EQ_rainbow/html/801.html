<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073632480">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted introduce myself, as I&#39;m new to the guild, though I&#39;ve been<br/>
listening in on EQ_rainbow for a really long time.  I just joined a couple<br/>
of nights ago.  My character is on Rodcet Nife.  His name is Txomin, a dark<br/>
elf enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
What brings me to this server and guild now?  Well, I&#39;ve been playing EQ<br/>
since beta 2, and when final release came around, I burned hard for about a<br/>
year in it.  In that time I moved from Tarew Marr to Tunare, where I settled<br/>
and founded with a couple of friends one of the biggest and strongest guilds<br/>
there, named Talisman.  I put forth a lot of effort in the guild, and as the<br/>
leader I encouraged everyone who had problems--in game or real life--to let<br/>
me know and I&#39;d do everything I could to help.  I looked at my position as<br/>
the caretaker of every guildmember&#39;s fun; for me I felt I had to ensure that<br/>
everyone was having a good time.  It&#39;s a good way to be, and it made the<br/>
guild a terrific place.  However, 60+ people all coming to you with their<br/>
problems daily can be a burden after a while.  Couple that with a really<br/>
REALLY bad time in my own life and complete burnout was innevitable.<br/>
<br/>
So, around February of this year, I stopped playing.  I turned over the<br/>
guild to a really good friend, and it&#39;s still going strong.  For myself, I<br/>
divorced EQ for about 6 months.  I fixed my ailing real life (a year of<br/>
unemployed, continuous EverQuest debauchery can set your existence into a<br/>
tail-spin), got a job and moved to San Diego.<br/>
<br/>
The break presented the perfect opportunity to move to Rodcet Nife and<br/>
finally do what I&#39;d always wished I could have done, and that is join Mystic<br/>
Alliance.  I couldn&#39;t leave Tunare before, but now I&#39;m free to do it.  Oddly<br/>
enough, part of the reason I&#39;m playing again is work related.  I&#39;m a content<br/>
writer for Verant Interactive/Sony Online Entertainment now, so it&#39;s sort of<br/>
part of the job!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s my story and I&#39;m sticking to it.  As I said, I live in San<br/>
Diego.  I&#39;m not sure if anyone else lives here or not.  One of the unique<br/>
advantages of my job is, I most likely will be attending some of the various<br/>
EQ Player get-togethers around the country, particularly the one sponsored<br/>
by Verant.  I believe the next one will be February on the East Coast<br/>
somewhere (my old stomping ground), and likely I&#39;ll be there.  So who knows,<br/>
I may be in a neighborhood near you in the future :)<br/>
<br/>
Nice to finally be part of something I&#39;d always wished to join in on.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
