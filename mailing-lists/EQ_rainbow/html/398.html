Well , I would suggest High Hold Pass . I stayed in that area until I was<br/>
level 20 and got decent exp as well as loot (plus you can get to try your<br/>
hands on a few nice items such as the polished granite tomahawk , shiney<br/>
brass halberd or cracked darkwood shield) . This is also a great place<br/>
because it&#39;s located very close to a bank (In High Hold Keep). I hope this<br/>
helps =)<br/>
