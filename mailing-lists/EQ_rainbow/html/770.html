<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059452514">Wow! Someone dug back through the threads a bit, eh!<br/>
<br/>
  Hehe, actually this weeks patch fixed it! Yay! I can type slashes & <br/>
question marks again! But thanks for the reply. :)<br/>

&gt; Hey Todd,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you have your shortcut keys set up for tells and replys?  For <br/>
&gt; example to tell, I just hit the letter T and it automatically fills <br/>
&gt; in the /tell part, same with R for reply, etc...<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Well, more fun with yesterday&#39;s patch. I type in Dvorak (a<br/>
&gt; &gt; different keyboard layout), which EQ has not supported. Throws me<br/>
&gt; &gt; from 90 wpm in Dvorak to about 30 in qwerty. So, last month a <br/>
patch<br/>
&gt; &gt; on the test server had a message that Verant was looking to<br/>
modify <br/>
&gt; EQ <br/>
&gt; &gt; to support various keyboard layouts -- hurray! I followed the <br/>
&gt; &gt; instructions to modify a text file & email it back to the guy in <br/>
&gt; &gt; charge of that fix so that he would know what keys went where in <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; layout I use. I also told him when I did so that the modified<br/>
text <br/>
&gt; &gt; file to enable Dvorak caused a problem -- a few keys (most<br/>
&gt; &gt; importantly the slash key) didn&#39;t work.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Well, yesterday&#39;s patch included the new file -- with the bug <br/>
&gt; still <br/>
&gt; &gt; in it. This means I cannot /g, /gu, /r, /t, /shout, or /anything <br/>
at <br/>
&gt; &gt; all. Aargh! Switching my computer back to qwerty doesn&#39;t change <br/>
&gt; this, <br/>
&gt; &gt; as EQ sets its keyboard layout from its own files.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   So, until this is fixed, I&#39;m stuck switching chat channels in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; chat box. Expect me to be in /gu as the default (I think that&#39;s <br/>
one<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the options in there -- surely hope so!), so I won&#39;t be able<br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; /say, /t, or /r anything without a bit of a delay to switch it <br/>
&gt; around <br/>
&gt; &gt; in the chat box.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Hmmm. How do I use sign-language ingame? </span></blockquote></div>
