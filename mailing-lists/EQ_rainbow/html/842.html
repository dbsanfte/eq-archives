<div id="ygrps-yiv-177821764">Hi Owen,<br/>
    I do not know anyone on the Brell server.  We have a gay guild on Rodcet<br/>
Nife.  If you ever think about switching servers come join up with us  =)<br/>
We have people who would powerlevel your characters up to where you are<br/>
now.  We have a few bears in our guild (including my lover) and are<br/>
accepting of everyone as long as they accept us (even breeders =P).  The<br/>
guild is more centered around the game than it is our sexuality.  The guild<br/>
is a place where we can play free of harassment and when people do harass us<br/>
we have the rest of the guild to back us up.  We are over 50 strong now in<br/>
the Mystic Alliance.  There is also a bear specific guild on the Lanys T&#39;Vyl<br/>
server.  I just recently created a character there and joined them but they<br/>
are a smaller guild.<br/>

We also have a website.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mysticalliance.im1ru12.org">http://mysticalliance.im1ru12.org</a>  If you want a<br/>
member account email me and I&#39;ll set it up.  We also have a guild mailing<br/>
list on egroups(which is changing to Yahoo) look for mysticalliance.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; My nameis Owen DuBose and I&#39;m a relatively new player to EQ but a<br/>
&gt; lifelong sci-fi, fantasy and RPG fan. My partner Dan Watson and I<br/>
&gt; both play EQ on the Brell Serilis server and are looking for other<br/>
&gt; gay/lesbian friends to meet on our server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My primary character is an Ogre ShadowKnight named Grackk, level 12,<br/>
&gt; currently sittinga round Neriak (a/k/a Scrunchyville) trying to level<br/>
&gt; up fletching, smithing and brewing skills while taking side trips to<br/>
&gt; Lavastorm to kill drakes and rock dervishes :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My secondary character is a Human Cleric named Dhalgren who is<br/>
&gt; currentl hanging in N. Qeynos taking trips to Blackburrow to harass<br/>
&gt; some the gnolls. He is 6th level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dan&#39;s primary character is a 13th lvl DE Necro named Staben who is, I<br/>
&gt; believe currently blitzing around E Commons/N ro/ S Ro and Oasis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dan has a secondary character he hasn&#39;t even played yet, lol.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We are very interested in the possibilty of being a part of a g/l<br/>
&gt; guild on Brell or starting one if there isn&#39;t one. We are also<br/>
&gt; interested in locating other &quot;bear&quot; and &quot;big bear&quot; buddies on Brell<br/>
&gt; to group with or talk to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Feel free to to email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bigbear@...">bigbear@...</a>!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
