<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615001047">Ok my coments on the names sugested.<br/>
<br/>
The Chosen. Naw dont think so. <br/>
Noriath united. Not bad. Just two issuse. One too bland, and realy doent <br/>
sound right. Two doent permot thought. When I see it only makes me think ok a <br/>
all race group.<br/>
<br/>
now the we are everywhere. I like the consept, but looks more like a solgan <br/>
than a name for a group.<br/>
<br/>
Just me 2sp<br/>

&lt;&lt; Ok here are three suggestions, feel free to comment!<br/>
 <br/>
 How about &quot;The Chosen&quot;? I like it because it&#39;s incredibly arrogant, with<br/>
 the implication being that being GLBT or queer-positive makes you better<br/>
 than if you&#39;re not.  Well lets face it...doesn&#39;t it???? =) I&#39;m suggesting<br/>
 &quot;The Chosen&quot; because &quot;We Rock&quot; doesn&#39;t sound that medieval, but lets face<br/>
 it...we rock!<br/>
 <br/>
 How about &quot;Norath United&quot;? I think it presents a pretty clear strong<br/>
 concept.  On the downside it sounds a bit boring.<br/>
 <br/>
 How about &quot;We Are Everywhere&quot;.  I like it because it sends the positive<br/>
 message that GLBT people are everywhere.  It also has mysterious overtones<br/>
 that I think make it cool in a standalone way.<br/>
