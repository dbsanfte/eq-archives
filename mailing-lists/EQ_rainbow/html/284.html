<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-526310148">Hello, all!<br/>
<br/>
(I know this email address leaves little to the imagination, but it works.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an &quot;upper 20s&quot;, bisexual, transgendered (MtF) person.  Most everyone <br/>
sees me as female, since that&#39;s how I wish to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know there was a Rainbow community on EQ until recently.  (Thank <br/>
goodness!)<br/>
<br/>
Most of my characters (I have four) are on the Fennin Ro server.  (I keep <br/>
playing there because I have so many friends...  even if the majority of <br/>
other players just cheaze (sic) me off a lot.  The things I do for friends!) <br/>
   heheheh<br/>
<br/>
For the sake of keeping my identity safe, I&#39;m not posting my character names <br/>
to this list.  (A lot of people on EQ are real-life friends that don&#39;t need <br/>
to know this part of me.)<br/>
<br/>
In the meanwhile, I offer safe and friendly hugs to all...</div>
