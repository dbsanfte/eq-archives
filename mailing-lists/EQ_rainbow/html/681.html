<div id="ygrps-yiv-291591601">&quot;The Agenda Has Been Found&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Many of you have heard Pat Robertson, Jerry<br/>
<br/>
Fallwell, and others speak of the &quot;Homosexual<br/>
<br/>
Agenda,&quot; but no one has ever seen a copy of it.<br/>
<br/>
I have finally obtained a copy directly from the<br/>
<br/>
Head Homosexual (she/he/it<br/>
<br/>
who must be obeyed). It follows below:<br/>
<br/>
The Homosexual Agenda<br/>

2:00 PM 1) Assume complete control of the US<br/>
<br/>
Federal, State and Local Governments as well as all<br/>
<br/>
other national governments, 2) recruit all<br/>
<br/>
straight youngsters to our debauched lifestyle,<br/>
<br/>
3) destroy all healthy heterosexual marriages,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
5) establish planetary chain of &quot;homo breeding<br/>
<br/>
gulags&quot; where over medicated imprisoned straight<br/>
<br/>
women are turned into artificially impregnated baby<br/>
<br/>
factories to produce prepubescent love slaves for<br/>
<br/>
our devotedly pederastic gay leadership,<br/>
<br/>
6) bulldoze all houses of worship, and 7) secure<br/>
<br/>
total control of the INTERNET and all mass media<br/>
