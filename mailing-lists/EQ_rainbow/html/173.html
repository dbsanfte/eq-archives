<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900692967">Hello everyone<br/>
<br/>
My 2cp I like Force of synergy, better than any I have seen as of yet. I <br/>
defently cant see my Dark Elf Necro with a guild tital of Spirit of Harmony. <br/>
I would be laughted out of Nektulos forest if I showed up with that next to <br/>
my name. <br/>

&lt;&lt; Well,<br/>
 <br/>
 Spirit of Harmony is of course still a possibility, but as I pointed out<br/>
 last night in the chat, the name implies such a &quot;goody-goody&quot; theme that<br/>
 &quot;evil&quot; and maybe even &quot;neutral&quot; chacrhters would seem silly in the giuld.<br/>
 therefore the poeple who remianed in the chat last night tried ot thik of<br/>
 somehting that would not imply a good-oriented nature to the guild, but<br/>
 rather a neutral orientation.  Force of synergy can be taken in many<br/>
 ways....synergy is the joining of energy or ideas, therefore the titlew<br/>
 can be seen as the coming togethe of the ideas outlined in the charter, as<br/>
 well as the energy of the poeple in the guild working towards the goals<br/>
 outlined in the charter.  In this sense even a dark elf neromancer, could<br/>
 join our guild and seek the mutual respect or &quot;tolerance&quot;<br/>
  of all members as well as the poeple of Norrath at large.  this dosnt<br/>
 mean this Dark elf necro has to necesarily like or love the wood elves<br/>
 around, just respect and elarn from them as the charter describes.<br/>
 <br/>
 I understand that these ideas may not work for everyone, but i think that<br/>
 &quot;spirit of harmony&quot; would work even less for people.<br/>
 <br/>
 In my personal case my 12th lvl Wizard (Fentus) is a neutral-good<br/>
 charchter who would not want to join a guild that seeks Harmony between<br/>
 all people (he just dose not see this as relaistic or practical) but a<br/>
 guild that prmotes respect for poeple would be fine (especially since the<br/>
 diversity he would then encouter could benefit him in his search for<br/>
 knowledge)<br/>
 <br/>
 Lastly, this guild name and charter would not necessarily be good for the<br/>
 evilest of evil, though they would be wecome to join.  but i dont think we<br/>
 could createa guild that would be ok for EVERYONE.  But spirit of Harmony<br/>
 would be a step in the opposite direction. &gt;&gt;</div>
