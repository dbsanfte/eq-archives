<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402581410">Hello everyone (and to those on both the EQ_Rainbow and the MA-Rodcet <br/>
lists, sorry you are getting this twice).<br/>
<br/>
The wedding plans are shaping up now. Here&#39;s what we have so far:<br/>
<br/>
o The date is Oct. 21st, Saturday.<br/>
o The time is:<br/>
9:00 PM GMT<br/>
4:00 PM Eastern<br/>
3:00 PM Central<br/>
2:00 PM Mountain<br/>
1:00 PM Pacific<br/>
<br/>
Hard to find a good time with an 8 hour difference between one of the <br/>
grooms and our West coast US friends, but hopefully this will work<br/>
for <br/>
most of you who wish to attend.<br/>
<br/>
o Who: The grooms are...<br/>
Eizen, High Elf Cleric of 40 plus seasons<br/>
Kerik Rainbow, Wood Elf Druid of 35 seasons.<br/>
<br/>
... both worshippers of Tunare, mother of all.<br/>
<br/>
o Location:<br/>
Rodcet Nife server<br/>
Toxxulia Forest zone (yes a long way away, especially for those in <br/>
Kunark right now)<br/>
On the beach.<br/>
<br/>
I will call upon my guildmates to assist me in porting people to and <br/>
from the wedding. There is a druid ring in Toxxulia Forest, so I can <br/>
drop you right there.<br/>
<br/>
This zone is very quiet and underutilized, so we should not be <br/>
disturbed by /shout and /ooc traffic. Nor should we encounter any <br/>
excessive lag problems due to zone overcrowding.<br/>
<br/>
o Guests from other servers should create Erudites on Rodcet to make <br/>
things fairly easy. Hopefully we will be able to buff you and escort <br/>
you so you can get safely to the wedding site. We can also <br/>
/guildinvite you so you can meet and chat with the Rodcet Mystic <br/>
Alliance crew.<br/>
<br/>
o To allow time for porting and travel, I (and hopefully guildmates <br/>
who can help) will be available at least 2 hours in advance to start<br/>
porting/escorting.<br/>
<br/>
o There will be food and drink. I will be resuming my baking trade <br/>
skill to get ready. Hopefully, some of our other bakers will be able <br/>
to contribute some goodies as well. I have already baked two wedding <br/>
cakes which will yield 20 slices. I hope to bake a couple more before <br/>
the event.<br/>
<br/>
o As Eizen and Kerik have no shortage of Norrathly possessions, we <br/>
would like to say that no gifts are necessary (unless someone wants<br/>
to <br/>
give me a weight reducing bag, hehe, j/k). Your attendance and kind <br/>
wishes are a greater gift than anything else. =)<br/>
<br/>
o We are still deciding on a honeymoon location. We checked out the <br/>
Throne Room in Cazic Thule and discovered that the travel brochure <br/>
failed to mention the slight lizard problem, so we are still looking <br/>
for a location. =)<br/>
<br/>
o We still have not selected the wedding party yet, so those are more<br/>
details we must iron out. Also, wish me luck petitioning to get a GM <br/>
to perform a same-sex wedding. I&#39;ll let you know what they say.<br/>
<br/>
Many of you have already offered congratulations to us and I just<br/>
want <br/>
to thank you again. Some have also sent regrets that you will not be <br/>
able to attend on the 21st. Hopefully, some of our budding <br/>
photographers will take lots of shots and I will try to extract a <br/>
complete transcript from my eqlog.txt file and post it.<br/>
<br/>
If I have left out anything or you have questions, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
David<br/>
(Kerik)<br/>
