<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564897386">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I just found this group and believe me, I&#39;ve been looking for it for <br/>
a long time! I had been on every search engine I could think of and <br/>
nothing was coming up, finally I got to HOTBOT and there it was <br/>
EQ_Rainbow. As I was clicking the link, I thought for sure it would <br/>
be dead. But it wasn&#39;t (YAY!) and here I am. I always knew there had <br/>
to be others on EQ, but I was starting to have doubts.<br/>
<br/>
I have been playing on Morrel-Thule for the last 7 months or so, but <br/>
not reguarly until recently. Anyway, I have decided that since I <br/>
finally found the group, I am going to move over to Rodcet Nife and <br/>
create a new character (I can&#39;t believe I have to be a newbie AGAIN!)<br/>
At least, no one took my name. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just wanted to say &quot;Hey&quot; to everyone and if you are in EQ <br/>
on Rodcet Nife give a /tell to Kedek, I am very interested in joining <br/>
the guild.<br/>
<br/>
Until then,<br/>
<br/>
