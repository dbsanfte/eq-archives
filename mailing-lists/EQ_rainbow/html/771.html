<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371243281">Greetings:<br/>
<br/>
I just found out about EQ Rainbow through a long and contentious thread<br/>
started on an Everquest newsgroup. My first response to hearing about EQ<br/>
Rainbow made me laugh out loud: &quot;My God, there are others like me out<br/>
there!&quot; I had wondered if there were any other gay/lesbian players<br/>
around (I certainly hadn&#39;t met them).<br/>
<br/>
I am Vince Bowes, a Branch Supervisor of a public library in Toronto,<br/>
Canada. I&#39;ve been playing EQ off and on for about eight months. I have<br/>
two characters I play frequently on the Tribunal server, but I am<br/>
strongly considering ending them and starting over on the RN server<br/>
because I am really curious about the Mystic Alliance...but it will be<br/>
hard to drop my level 17 druid, Kestrelle. But it would be worthwhile to<br/>
talk to other gay players and be part of a truly &#39;open&#39; guild. Are there<br/>
any openings for a high elf cleric in the ranks? That&#39;s a class/race<br/>
combo I have been eager to try for some time.<br/>
