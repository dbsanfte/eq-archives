<div id="ygrps-yiv-833509589">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Just stumbled across you and thought I would join and give you a bit <br/>
of an intro on who I am.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Rick and I live and work in the greater DC area.  <br/>
Brief stats:<br/>
Blondish/Brown hair<br/>
Reddish goatte<br/>
blue eyes<br/>
5&#39;9&quot; 265#<br/>
<br/>
My profile on Yahoo has a picture of me if you are really interested <br/>
in seeing:  poohnva<br/>
<br/>
I have been playing EQ for almost 9 months.  <br/>
<br/>
I am kind of dating a nice guy.  Looking to meet other people in the <br/>
area with similar interests.<br/>
<br/>
I saw that many of you had recently sent in a brief description of <br/>
yourselves/characters.  I took the liberty to create a table on the <br/>
Egroups site so that we can keep this info in.<br/>
<br/>
I have also created a file which is a Word 97 document.  This file <br/>
has the current stats and average prices of about 1500 items from the <br/>
game.  I have compiled this list from a few different websites and <br/>
thought it would be good to have as a resource for people.  It prints <br/>
nicely and is indexed by type of item (weapon, armor etc).   I will <br/>
update it about every week or so.  If you want a copy of this file, <br/>
send me an email and I will send it to you.<br/>
<br/>
My characters are all currently on the Innorruk server.  I have a lvl <br/>
29 druid named Looseleaf Binders.  I have been haunting the Lake of <br/>
Ill Omens and whooping up on the Sarnak&#39;s and goblins in the area!<br/>
I just left my guild (Mithril Knights) because I felt they were far <br/>
to clique.  I want to find a guild where most people are there to <br/>
help one another.  A gay or gay-friendly group would be ideal.<br/>
<br/>
I typically play from 7pm to 11pm most nights and on the weekends as <br/>
much as possible.  If you want to group sometime, just give me a <br/>
tell.  <br/>
<br/>
Later,<br/>
Rick</div>
