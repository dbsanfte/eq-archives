<div id="ygrps-yiv-785284922">I&#39;m on Tunare, my name is Ranoldar, a half-elf ranger lvl 18. I usually group <br/>
with Salamon, he is a lvl 18 wizard, and Alileana, a lvl 18 paladin, we are <br/>
currently hunting aviaks in Lake Rathetear. Don&#39;t know if they are gay or <br/>
straight as that is not an issue that has ever come up. By the way that is an <br/>
excellent zone for mid-teen levels! If you see me there say hi and come for a <br/>
skinny-dip in the lake, just don&#39;t let WebClaw grab you!<br/>
