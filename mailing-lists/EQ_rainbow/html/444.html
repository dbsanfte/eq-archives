And on the website, great!  I wonder if I can bug a friend and see what<br/>
royalty free graphics we can dig up ... I also can do Logo-type graphics<br/>
and have had some companies and groups use mine before, I still have my<br/>
graphics package (I bought it).  If anyone has freehand graphics though, I<br/>
do have a scanner and can scan if they are sent to me and get it in a<br/>
variety of graphics formats (as well as photo touch-up work, etc ...). <br/>
