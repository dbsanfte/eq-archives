<br/>
A chilly evening in the West Commons (on Rodcet Nife server)<br/>
----------------------------<br/>
    Kerik the Wood Elf Druid worked hastily to set up the tent. Eizen<br/>
appeared about ready to nod off at any moment. As had become their <br/>
usual habit, Kerik ported his cleric friend to the commons and the<br/>
two <br/>
men spent the night next to the druid ring, wrapped in each others <br/>
arms. Kerik struggled and fumbled with the tent. Nerves! he thought. <br/>
Must relax. He took a deep, calming breath.<br/>
    It had been a busy night. He&#39;d been helping Gotham in her quest<br/>
to <br/>
kill asps when news reached him that Adessa had been seen dancing <br/>
naked around Eizen. There was even a rumor they had made love. Kerik <br/>
was so angry he couldn&#39;t see straight. His first inclination had been <br/>
to leave Eizen. But his heart wouldn&#39;t let him. He needed Eizen. He <br/>
just hadn&#39;t been able to take that next step.<br/>
    His brother, Jono, had almost convinced him to go ahead and ask <br/>
for Eizen&#39;s hand. But Jono had left Faydwer at an early age and<br/>
wasn&#39;t <br/>
aware of the class system -- wasn&#39;t aware of how the high elves<br/>
looked <br/>
down upon their woodland kin. To Jono, it was just a matter of <br/>
following one&#39;s heart. But to Kerik, it was more complicated. What <br/>
would Eizen&#39;s parents think? Wouldn&#39;t they abandon their son for <br/>
marrying a dirty wood elf? Did he really want to put Eizen in a <br/>
position to choose between him and his entire culture? And then there <br/>
was the fear of outright rejection. What is Eizen just didn&#39;t want to <br/>
marry him? Maybe he should just maintain the status quo, he had <br/>
thought.<br/>
    Then Adessa came along. Kerik knew he had to act now or never. <br/>
After getting over his anger, he quickly began trying to find a ring. <br/>
After a long wait on what must have been the slowest Paladin in all<br/>
of <br/>
Norrath, Kerik was able to purchase a ring.<br/>
    Now, if he could just get the tent set up. There. It was done.<br/>
And <br/>
Eizen was in it already and about to nod off. &quot;Wait...&quot; Kerik <br/>
implored. He had rehearsed this moment in his head so many times. He <br/>
would kneel. Then hand Eizen the ring and ask him to marry him. But <br/>
Eizen&#39;s sleepy eyes and Kerik&#39;s nervousness ruined his well rehearsed <br/>
plan.<br/>
    Instead, he quickly dug around his pocket for the ring. It was <br/>
gone! Where could it be? Then he remembered... he was wearing the <br/>
Forman&#39;s Tunic Eizen had just given him and the ring was in his old <br/>
Lockjaw vest. He grabbed the ring and stretched out his shaking hand <br/>
to Eizen without saying a word. Eizen looked at the ring and saw it <br/>
was an engagement ring. Kerik looked into Eizen&#39;s eyes for some kind <br/>
of sign as to whether he was going to accept it or not. After what <br/>
seemed like forever, Eizen smiled as he took the ring and placed it<br/>
on <br/>
his finger.<br/>
    &quot;You took it,&quot; Kerik said surprised more than anything but filled <br/>
with joy too, as tears welled up in his eyes.<br/>
    Eizen smiled back at him. &quot;Weren&#39;t you supposed to kneel down on <br/>
one knee?&quot;<br/>
    Kerik shrugged and stared at the ground in embarrassment. &quot;I was <br/>
too nervous and thought you were about to fall asleep.&quot;<br/>
    Eizen wiped the tears from Kerik&#39;s eyes and they held each other <br/>
for the longest time.<br/>
<br/>
===============================<br/>
Eizen, High Elven Cleric of the 35th season and Kerik Rainbow, Wood <br/>
Elf Druid of the 31st season announce their engagement to be married <br/>
at a time and place to be determined. The entire Mystic Alliance<br/>
guild <br/>
and all other interested parties will be invited to attend the <br/>
ceremony and reception. There will be plenty of food and drink for <br/>
all. (Hope to have some actual wedding cake now that the recipe has <br/>
been discovered.)<br/>
<br/>
The grooms are registered at Leather and Hide, Jade&#39;s Jewelry shop<br/>
and <br/>
other fine stores in Freeport and surrounding areas.<br/>
<br/>
/ooc Everyone from the EQ Rainbow list will be invited to join us on <br/>
the Rodcet Nife server for the big event. Once we have determined a <br/>
location, if you don&#39;t have a character on the server, you can create <br/>
one in the closest starting city. We are looking for a location that <br/>
will not be KOS to anyone and we should have plenty of people <br/>
available to provide ports as well. If you&#39;ve been thinking about <br/>
coming over and visiting us in the largest gay/gay friendly guild in <br/>
Norrath, this will be a great to chance to meet everyone. The event <br/>
will take place some time after the 6th of October as I (Kerik) will <br/>
be out of town.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
