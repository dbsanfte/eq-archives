<div id="ygrps-yiv-467668721">Hi guys,<br/>
<br/>
Well I joined the list on Sunday night and then came to visit Rodcet <br/>
on Monday and joined &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot;. I dare say I won&#39;t get to see <br/>
many of you guys until the weekends due to the time differences. I&#39;ve <br/>
also just had time to look through some recent posts and thought I <br/>
better fill out the Intro like a good boy as I didn&#39;t give much away <br/>
b4 =).<br/>
<br/>
First name: Swin <br/>
<br/>
Oh boy, explanation... short for Suwinfi which is made up from Sun, <br/>
Wind and Fire. I was given this as my middle name by my dearest <br/>
mother but been called it all my life. I think she maybe had been <br/>
smoking dope when she made the decision but it&#39;s grown on me. =) Plus <br/>
I&#39;m a homo and I just have to be different!<br/>

<br/>

Occasionally the gym (something had to give a bit for EQ!)<br/>
<br/>
I work for &quot;Thomas Cook&quot; which is one of the multiple travel <br/>
companies in the UK as a financial analyst, so inbetween that and <br/>
studying for my accountancy exams, plus the above I don&#39;t have time <br/>
for a boyfriend =) (is that good or bad?) heh<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I&#39;ll shut up now and go to bed.. night all and see you in EQ!<br/>
<br/>
(PS: I installed Roger Wilco, took quite a bit of configuring for my <br/>
limited technical PC skills, added to the fact that the web site says <br/>
it&#39;s unlikely it will even work with my soundcard I managed to get it <br/>
up and running after over an hour, lol, so maybe you&#39;ll hear me too!)</div>
