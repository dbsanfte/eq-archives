<div id="ygrps-yiv-956380678">Ok I&#39;m glad it looks like this guild thing is going to be fixed. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like Tarisimo doesn&#39;t want to talk about this reasonably, and<br/>
that kind of makes me sad.  Since as I understand he was running his guild<br/>
as an LGBT guild, it looks like the probable result of all this will be<br/>
conflict between LGBT players on E&#39;ci.<br/>
<br/>
Joking paranoid thought, could a homophobic guide have orchestrated this<br/>
all to bring about queer conflict on E&#39;ci? Will this be spread to other<br/>
servers! =O<br/>
<br/>
It looks like over the next couple days Mystical Alliance will be deleted<br/>
on E&#39;ci and recreated under Deric (who may want to transfer ownership of<br/>
the guild to a regular E&#39;ci list member to avoid the beurocacy of having<br/>
to log in regularly).  After a settling down period, maybe someone who<br/>
hasn&#39;t been involved in all this, might try approaching Tarisimo and<br/>
seeing if any kind of peace is possible.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m ultimately a little curious about the unanswered questions here.  How<br/>
did Tarisimo decide on the name Mystical Alliance for his queer guild.  It<br/>
is a queer guild isn&#39;t it? Did he read our charter on the site and decide<br/>
to stat it on E&#39;ci? Is there a *true* mystical alliance between queer EQ<br/>
players that would result in us coming up with the same name? 8)<br/>
