<div id="ygrps-yiv-570514355">Yeah, Kirei is a monk, a serious twink - I got to 45 in 18 days and quickly out-paced the rest of the guild.  My main is a 57 magician, Beltath, in Destiny, now they&#39;re both in Destiny.<br/>
<br/>
I mostly ignored the guildchat, and only ever fought along side a couple people in Amazons.  I occasionally put forth the voice of cohesion as well.  But, really, the guild was just too low to be of any use to me.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I would hardly call Destiny much improvement...<br/>

Hey! I was/am in that Guild!! and Kirei sounds familiar...Monk?  I signed on <br/>
there once about oh 3 months ago & was told about a split, and for that <br/>
moment I talked&#39;em out of it (since the leader of the split said 90% of the <br/>
toons we&#39;re leaving I pointed out it might be easier just to fix the <br/>
amazons, besides! what better tag is ther than Amazons of Norrath! hehee <br/>
sorry guys)<br/>
it was still together a few weeks ago...oh, and all female toons, not <br/>
players, lots of straight guys who want to make cracks about butt cleavage, <br/>
again, back when I was an active member...<br/>

There is a female-only guild on Sol Ro called Amazons of Norrath, and about <br/>
the<br/>
time I left them a splinter group was imminent.  However, it wasn&#39;t a <br/>
lesbian<br/>
guild, and only a few members (myself among them) were adamant about keeping <br/>
the<br/>
guild female only.<br/>
Reason I left?  When I left, I was 45th, average lvl was about 23, closest <br/>
to me<br/>
was 40th.  I left and joined an uber guild.-Kirei Tokage, Sol Ro<br/>
