<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629380923">Have any of you dealt with the recent GM run campaigns lately ? I am talking<br/>
about the Undead King mini-campaign.. these types of things give the game<br/>
that extra something that is necessary for longetivity ingame. I have not<br/>
seen this on the Rodcet Nife server, but apparently they are happening now.<br/>
I wonder if we can have a Gm run Queer campaign.. you know.. a parade of<br/>
sorts.. hhhmmm... :oP .. just being silly.. but seriosuly.. i am looking to<br/>
hear from people who have seen it on their server.</div>
