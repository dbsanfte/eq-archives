<div id="ygrps-yiv-913113370">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I tend to be a bit shy about these things so dont know how much I might<br/>
write but though I would introduce myself at the very least.  I play 3<br/>
characters on line at the moment (well 4 if you count a shaman I started<br/>
on the newest server :).  My other 3 are all on veeshan.  Have a monk,<br/>
level 6 (who I only play because I wanted to see what a tank was like and<br/>
because I like that bare-chested look *grin*, He is called Torson, then I<br/>
have a level 29 druid, half-elf, my favorite power player and  my cute<br/>
little wood-elf druid, and he is fun dto play as he is my RPG character<br/>
and less of a leveler.<br/>
<br/>
I thought at first the artists were suffering from secual deprivation when<br/>
the females got created, I mean they are rather skimpy.  Still I think the<br/>
wood elf men, barbarians and monks are pretty nice as well.  However its<br/>
rather academic as I play for the fun not the cartoons :)  You cna&#39;t deny<br/>
though that you sometimes bond with your character so its nice ot play one<br/>
you can identify with.  Even if yuo paly an Ogre or troll they cna be a<br/>
lot of fun jsut for the pure RPG aspect of the game.<br/>
<br/>
As for encoutners - never once had any type of encoutner except a few<br/>
female characters made some sexual comments but they dont mean much to me;<br/>
no guy has ever made a comment, except maybe one when I was in wolf form<br/>
but it was more just fun.  Personally I dont really care about it - you<br/>
dont know who is playing the character - male playing female, vice-versa,<br/>
a kid an old man, a young girl, a handsome movei star, a beer guzzling<br/>
crack addict - so you just go by the character itself and dont worry about<br/>
who is behind it as long as the character they play is a decent person to<br/>
be with.<br/>
<br/>
I only hang out with ncie players and have not had any problems.  While I<br/>
cant deny that maybe havine a little bit of sexual chat play with a studly<br/>
monk character could be a lot of fun its really not the place for it - you<br/>
want sex chat the web is absoulutely loaded with it :)  The only way it<br/>
would be nice is in the actual framework of the game - ie like amzaon<br/>
women, soldier *buddies*, a love affair,  a stray encoutner with a<br/>
minotaur hehe<br/>
<br/>
Oh well I am rambling now.  As for the actual me?  I do computer work, 34<br/>
years old, work out at the gym since I spend almost all my free time at<br/>
work on the computer then home in EQ :) and need something to keep me in<br/>
shape *grin*, heavy into fantasy, read a lot, play Baldurs Gate, MM7,<br/>
Total Annihlation Kingdoms, Dungeon Keeper, have 3 cats, love to swim,<br/>
hike and bike.  Pretty much a quiet type :)  I also run my own guild in EQ<br/>
which is fun.<br/>
<br/>
Well be curious where this may go :)<br/>
<br/>
to Lonewolf Grey - nice name :)  Have fun in Maine - a nice place as I<br/>
live right next door to maine.<br/>
<br/>
Take care all :)</div>
