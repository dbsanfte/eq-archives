&gt; FurryMUCK (that was a long time ago it seems looking back:) EQ <br/>
&gt; seems pretty tame on the adult side, if you don&#39;t count language <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow! A MUCKer.  Every once in a while I run into someone online and I can just tell they MUCKd/MUSHd/MUDd. It&#39;s always nice to meet someone else who did that.  I know Furry MUCK of course, though I didn&#39;t play it myself.  I was a hard core MUSHer though on a MUSH called telamagica based on the &#39;Ars Magica&#39; role playing game (the best RPG ever created IMHO).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*Sigh* what can you do? Give /feedback I guess! I&#39;ll remember to rant next time I&#39;m on.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;m sure everyone would like to see is more options in designing your character portrait.  Maybe EQ won&#39;t get them, but maybe the next game will.  I want a little slider bar I can use to control the size of my breasts personally.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; little more than hack and slash. I loved Ultima Online for the world, but left it because of all the horrible &quot;Kewl d00ds&quot; that made the<br/>
&gt; place seem like some kind of kindergarten class overrun<br/>
&gt; by demonically power misbehaved children. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lol! That about sums it up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would love that, I think we should form our own multi-server guild:) <br/>
&gt; I am playing (and I should really focus on one character one of<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve considered that.  I figure I&#39;ll wait and see how this mailing list goes, and if there is enough interest, form a guild.  Some ideas I have for forming a guild would include:<br/>
    - have it on one server, not multiple servers, to<br/>
      ensure there would be enough guild members<br/>
      availble to form a cohesive guild.<br/>
    - have it on a new server (I&#39;m sure Verant will<br/>
      keep adding servers for a while).  This is fair<br/>
      to everyone (everyone needs to start a fresh<br/>
      character).  It also allows the opportunity to<br/>
      get involved in a brand new environment.<br/>
I figure I&#39;ll check back with the list in a couple of months and see how people feel about this.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; make money off it:) First and foremost though I<br/>
&gt; am a Writer, its what I love to do. Although recently I havnt written <br/>
&gt; too much, mabye I&#39;m playing too much EQ...;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a writer as well, but it is very hard (when you&#39;re as completely addicted to EQ as I am) to find the time to write.  My approach is the &#39;burnout&#39; approach, I&#39;m trying to play this game until I completely burn out my interest in it.  Hope it works, or I&#39;ll just be a very addicted 60 year old some day.<br/>
