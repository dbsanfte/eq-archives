<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061698406">Hi all!,<br/>
     I thought I&#39;d say hello to you all.  I signed up for the list when I <br/>
saw it on eqvault one day and thought it was a great idea.  I recently sold <br/>
my 31 cleric on Tar Mar *waves to Nystul*  because I never really got to <br/>
play with my friends there and the extra time in real life came in handy :)  <br/>
But now that it seems more and more folks are thinkin about a guild, I&#39;ll <br/>
come on back in :)  Being waay back in the closet in real life this will <br/>
give me a chance to hang out with actual gay folks.  I don&#39;t even associate <br/>
with any in real life :(.  This time around I think I&#39;ll do less power <br/>
leveling and more socializin&#39;  If others are congregating on a particular <br/>
server, post here to let us all know.  Take care! *hugz*</div>
