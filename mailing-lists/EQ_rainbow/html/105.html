<div id="ygrps-yiv-184662396">Well wednesday at 9:30pm EST is fine for me:) My chat handle is <br/>
Lonewolf23 and I&#39;ll be thrilled to give you my support. My current <br/>
character is Garret, level 7 Rogue on Brell. Been having lots of fun <br/>
with him so far, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be even better when the Rogue <br/>
changes go live:)<br/>
Also I&#39;m working on getting better in Talioring, I&#39;ve been wanting to <br/>
check out the better forms of Leather Armour, maybe we could <br/>
collaborate Christina since you have made Master (very <br/>
impressive:). I dont think Rogues can wear banded, I dont <br/>
remember:)<br/>
Anyway I look forward to seeing you all on wednesday at the birth <br/>
of our Guild, Unity sounds like a fine name BTW. <br/>
Take care all and look me up sometime...<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Lonewolf</div>
