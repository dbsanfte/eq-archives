<div id="ygrps-yiv-949696338">Ok here are three suggestions, feel free to comment!<br/>
<br/>
How about &quot;The Chosen&quot;? I like it because it&#39;s incredibly arrogant, with<br/>
the implication being that being GLBT or queer-positive makes you better<br/>
than if you&#39;re not.  Well lets face it...doesn&#39;t it???? =) I&#39;m suggesting<br/>
&quot;The Chosen&quot; because &quot;We Rock&quot; doesn&#39;t sound that medieval, but lets face<br/>
it...we rock!<br/>
<br/>
How about &quot;Norath United&quot;? I think it presents a pretty clear strong<br/>
concept.  On the downside it sounds a bit boring.<br/>
<br/>
How about &quot;We Are Everywhere&quot;.  I like it because it sends the positive<br/>
message that GLBT people are everywhere.  It also has mysterious overtones<br/>
that I think make it cool in a standalone way.<br/>
