<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553906194">There is a gay / lesbian / bi / trans guilds on The Nameless called <br/>
Nameless Love.  It has a small core of active players and a much <br/>
larger number of occasional players.  Many of its members have main <br/>
characters in other guilds (mostly The Nameless Of Mercy).  People in <br/>
this guild communicate using the Yahoo Club: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/gayandlesbianeverquestfolk">http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/gayandlesbianeverquestfolk</a> although <br/>
there is also a web site at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.namelesslove.com">http://www.namelesslove.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Nameless Love has never had any connection to Mystic Alliance <br/>
although several players in Nameless Love on The Nameless server also <br/>
play on Rodcet Nife in Mystic Alliance.<br/>

Regards to all...<br/>

&gt; Hey Tasco!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know if Mystic Alliance even exists. Did some searching <br/>
&gt; around and I *think* they formed &quot;Nameless Love&quot; on the Nameless <br/>
&gt; server.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Currently NL has about 6-8 active members (that I know of) and we <br/>
&gt; ROCKED last night! We had a full group. Everyone&#39;s got characters <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; the 7-14 range... so groupings easy. A few higher level people, and <br/>
&gt; their great for the assists.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyhow, if you find anyone in Mystic Alliance lemme know, otherwise <br/>
&gt; come join us on the Nameless!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Current officers that i know of are Fliq and Galadorn. Check out <br/>
&gt; Yahoo Clubs - <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/gayandlesbianeverquestfolk">http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/gayandlesbianeverquestfolk</a> <br/>

&gt; &gt; Morning everyone !<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve just created a character on Rodcet Nife and am very <br/>
interested <br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; joining Mystic Alliance. Can someone give me a list of who to <br/>
look <br/>
&gt; for on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the server that can bring me into the guild ? I&#39;ve been on Mith <br/>
&gt; Marr for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; last 18 months and have been meaning to come to Rodcet Nife for a <br/>
&gt; long time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>
