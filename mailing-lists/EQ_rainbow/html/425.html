I&#39;m really shocked that people in the zone were so mean, and I am even<br/>
more shocked that the GMs weren&#39;t helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve addressed homophobic remarks in OOC before usually with the result<br/>
being silence from everyone else in the zone, and occasionally with a<br/>
&quot;yeah grow up&quot; comment thrown in by someone.  Usually (not always) it<br/>
serves to shut the person up.  I haven&#39;t ever told anyone in game that I&#39;m<br/>
bi, I just don&#39;t find EQ an environment I&#39;ve been comfortable doing that<br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really saddened by your situaton, and I think it deserves more<br/>
attention from Verant.  Perhaps you could follow up on this more directly,<br/>
by phoning or emailing them? The important thing really is that you do<br/>
what feels best for you (whether that&#39;s letting the situation drop, or<br/>
taking it further).  Verant said no anti-gay harassment in their usage<br/>
policy, and they&#39;d better live up to that!<br/>
