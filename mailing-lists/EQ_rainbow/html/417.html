<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120718751">what are you doing when you go to the servers to see if a gm is on? are<br/>
you just doing /who all gm because if you are you are probably missing<br/>
out on some of the gms for they can toggle the gm on and off just like<br/>
we can toggle on and off role play, so i would suggest either <br/>
a) scedule a couple of days where you play only on one server during <br/>
their buissness hours and /petition and some one will get to 	you <br/>
				or <br/>
<br/>
b) do as some one else suggested on this list and just let us know 	when<br/>
you are going on (do your best to predict) and we 		petition for it and<br/>
when we get a gms attention we tell them 	that you are on another server<br/>
adn we will get you real quick</div>
