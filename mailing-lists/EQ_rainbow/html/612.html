<br/>
Thanks so much for the responses I recieved on this.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not under any Bard song or such. I&#39;ve only my own level 19 or lower<br/>
buffs for STR, etc. I&#39;ve got 88 WIS and 85 INT.<br/>
<br/>
Actually what I notice is that sometimes when I meditate the mana goes up<br/>
very slow (I can go clean the house !) - - if I click the meditate button<br/>
off and then on again it will sometimes go up in larger increments. At this<br/>
point I think this may be a bug and I will report it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really great seeing so much family on EQ !! If anyone is on Mith Marr<br/>
look me up - i&#39;m usually hanging out in Oasis at the Pier or North Ro at the<br/>
Platform.<br/>
<br/>
Klek - level 19 and holding !<br/>
<br/>

I actually may have a clue too.<br/>
<br/>
There has been a running debate on if the low level Bard song<br/>
for stamina helps mana regen. It brought out some interesting<br/>
side effects.<br/>
<br/>
Many mages said they &quot;saw&quot; a difference, but EQ staff on the Bard<br/>
list eventually said it had no effect.<br/>
<br/>
So the Bards fiddled with it a bit (pun intended).<br/>
<br/>
It seems that many stamina buffs will cause the &quot;ticker&quot; to update<br/>
faster. BUT before you get excited, the total time it takes to<br/>
go from 1 bubble to full (in mana) does not vary, just the rate at<br/>
which the changes are displayed.  The Bards found several mages<br/>
and asked them to time the total refill time as well as time the<br/>
&quot;ticker&quot; or visual update timer.  They then tested with and w/o song.<br/>
The data fit both what the mages saw and the EQ staff info.  The<br/>
&quot;ticker&quot; times could vary, fooling you into thinking it was filling faster,<br/>
but the refill total time was pretty constant.  If a true mana regen spell<br/>
or<br/>
song was put in effect *then* the total refill time was indeed reduced.<br/>
<br/>
So, were you under any stamina buffs?  They can give an illusion.<br/>
