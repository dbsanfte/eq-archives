<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053841046">Hi, Lora and David! Just wanted to say that I&#39;m a native North <br/>
Carolinian (if you can call Fort Bragg part of NC! :). Now living in <br/>
St. Louis, but my family still lives there.<br/>
<br/>
Lora, the words you wrote about your uncles were great - it reaffirms <br/>
my faith in humanity a bit when I hear that there are still a few <br/>
good people out there. I&#39;ve found many nice people on EQ, and like <br/>
the community a great deal.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
Jack<br/>
