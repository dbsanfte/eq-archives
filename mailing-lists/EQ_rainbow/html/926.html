<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714859173">Hello!<br/>
  I had been looking for a G/L/B/T posting site for EverQuest and <br/>
finally found you all today.  Hurray!<br/>
<br/>
  I am on the Bertoxx server and have 16th cleric Cryzstal, 9th <br/>
paladin Pyotr, and 8th druid Leatherboy.  (Leatherboy&#39;s original name <br/>
was gayboy  but I thought that was a little too &#39;in-your-face&#39;.)<br/>
<br/>
  I have another friend who I group with late night who is gay and <br/>
would love to meet or hear from other people.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for your replies!<br/>
<br/>
      Scott aka Pyotr</div>
