&gt;Okay, now we have some interest in the get together. As I said in the first<br/>
&gt;post, we can get together and chat, have fun, whatever. After awhile, we <br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt;go hunting a bit if we want.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you don&#39;t have a character on Brell, just create one in the city of<br/>
&gt;Freeport (even though humans are not too pretty, hehe). If you already have <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;Brell character and need assistance getting to Freeport, let me know. Binds<br/>
&gt;will be provided to those who want them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We will try to start at 1 PM Eastern, which is 10 AM Pacific. And it is<br/>
&gt;hopefully early enough for our European Rainbow members to join us too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you can&#39;t make it at that time, please just give me a tell anytime <br/>
&gt;(Dedric,<br/>
&gt;gnome Necro) Saturday as I will be on probably all day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Many of you may have concerns about the newbie areas on Brell being <br/>
&gt;crowded.<br/>
&gt;Now that the new regular server has opened, the Brell newbie areas are <br/>
&gt;getting<br/>
&gt;thinned out. I do have to admit, it was a bit of a pain for awhile though. <br/>
&gt;But<br/>
&gt;I hope those of you who left Brell for that reason will come back. I&#39;ll <br/>
&gt;even<br/>
&gt;be willing to help you power level a little if you want.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope to see you all in Norrath soon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hugs,<br/>
&gt;David<br/>
