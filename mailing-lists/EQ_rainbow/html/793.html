&gt; give up your Tribunal characters.  It will become clear with a little bit<br/>

It is nice to see a fellow Torontonian here, and T.O. is indeed a great city.<br/>
I have already started a character on Rodcet and had him inducted into the<br/>
Mystic Alliance. First of all, let me say that the people I have met from MA<br/>
have been absolutely great to me, very welcoming and helpful...all that I<br/>
could wish for in a guild, and the guildsays are now the highlight of my<br/>
playing sessions. The server in general I find also has a friendliness that<br/>
the Tribunal sometimes lacks, although I haven&#39;t yet met enough non-guild<br/>
players to really say if this is a trend or merely luck. So far, I have not<br/>
regretted switching to RN and playing there, and I seriously doubt that I ever<br/>
will.<br/>

If you ever see my cleric, Kythwin, online be sure to wave to him!<br/>
