And after Brell, and a break from EQ, then Luclin .. I moved to Rodcet last<br/>
night with a friend from Luclin., who&#39;s already introduced himself ;)<br/>
<br/>
So I should do the info thing:<br/>
<br/>
First Name: Lora<br/>
Age:            36 - do I have to!!<br/>
Location:       Raleigh NC (waves at David - the snow finally metled! now if<br/>
it will just stop raining)<br/>
Gender:         female<br/>
Home Page:  don&#39;t have one really .. assorted junk at<br/>

Status:         Married, kids -- err kids yes -- I&#39;m *ACK* straight! - but<br/>
for those that missed my intro - I<br/>
                      was effectively raised by two &quot;uncles&quot; after my<br/>
(abusive) father&#39;s death when I was young .. I<br/>
                      owe my choice of career to one (and he helped put me<br/>
thru college) and my choice of hobbies to<br/>
                      the other.   And I knew and accepted thier relat. in a<br/>
way I think only young children do - it simply<br/>
                      always was.   They were my family .. and the only<br/>
stable, kind, loving non-abusive males in my<br/>
                      life as a child.   And they weren&#39;t even really uncles<br/>
.. just neighbors who helped two kids<br/>
                      (my brother too) after thier dad died .. and took it<br/>
on themselves.<br/>

                              all started yesterday levels 4, 3, 1 this<br/>
second<br/>
                              my main on Luclin was a Bard .. got fairly<br/>
high<br/>
                              my mains on Brell were warrior and wiz<br/>
                              started life right after beta on Karana as a<br/>
Rogue (they were really broken then)<br/>
Most Hated EQ Monster: spiderlings!  they are a plague.<br/>
Favorite EQ Monster:  Frontier Mountain giants .. the biggest &quot;pet&quot; I&#39;ve<br/>
ever had! (as Bard - seemed to be easy to charm)<br/>
Fav. TV Show: ick TV ;)<br/>
Fav. Author: most SF / Fantasy .. Andre Norton & Isaac Asimov are the two I<br/>
blame for starting me in the genre&#39;s as a child<br/>
non-EQ hobbies:  Well, until my congenital defects got bad enough to become<br/>
a disability .. I used to train horses for<br/>
&quot;High School&quot; .. not just dressage and some jumping ..as well as breed them.<br/>
I used to work too .. as two different kinds of an Engineer and then as a<br/>
high-tech web geek type.  Now I mainly do my PT exercises as a forced hobby,<br/>
and stick to smaller<br/>
animals (dogs and trying out hamsters now).<br/>
