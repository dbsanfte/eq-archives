<div id="ygrps-yiv-956116780">Hello Tiger.<br/>
<br/>
I feel this is something I should respond to whether or not I have an answer for you. This is to let you know that you are not alone in this situation....<br/>
<br/>
I too play a female character and constantly have men hounding after me. I am engaged to be married to a guy in EQ that commits his whole life to me wherever I may go. Even when I was thinking about leaving the guild, he said he would leave also and follow my journeys. We have not been married yet, because I am reluctant to marry him without him knowing the truth. But at the same time, I don&#39;t want to ruin the romance that we have had for so long (since Level 8, and I&#39;m now Level 25). I&#39;m not sure if either of us are lying by not telling people we are male in RL. It had always been assumed that I was female because of how I spoke and played. Most people have not bothered to ask me what I am in RL, only assuming what was in their minds. I&#39;ve had 3 instances of people that have actually asked and I told them the truth.<br/>
<br/>
One was a little dwarf that always flirted with me and wanted to know my name in RL. He proceeded to tell me his real name, and asked for mine. I decided to tell him and admitted that I am male. I explained that I was afraid things would change if he knew I was male in RL, but he told me that it wouldn&#39;t. To this day, he still flirts with me in character and nothing seems to have changed at all.<br/>
<br/>
Another time, I saw my guildmaster&#39;s photo on that same site where Kyle can be found. When I was online, I told him that he has a very nice smile. Well, he blushed and asked when my picture would be on there. So I told him that if I looked as good as he did, I would do it right away. He then asked, &quot;What? Like a guy?&quot; It was then that I told him, &quot;You didn&#39;t know? I am a guy!&quot; He was surprised and agreed that I play a female character very well. He also asked if my EQ fiance knew the truth and I told him &quot;no&quot;, and asked what he thought I should do. He said that some guys have a hard time reacting to something like that and suggested that I didn&#39;t tell him. I&#39;m still debating what is the right thing to do, but nothing has changed between the guildmaster and I still.<br/>
<br/>
The third time was with another female character of mine. This guy always looked me up and flirted with me. One day, he wanted to give me his email address so we could talk more. I decided that I reveal the fact that I am male, and he laughed so hard. He told me that his wife would be laughing at him even more if she saw it. I haven&#39;t played the character since so I don&#39;t know how he would react to me when we see each other next time, but he certainly didn&#39;t treat me badly then. He was just laughing continuously and almost falling off his chair.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know of any of these instances can help you at all, Tiger. But I just wanted to let you and our other friends here know about my personal experiences. I haven&#39;t run into a nasty situation, but that doesn&#39;t mean it may not happen. All I can say is that we are playing characters in EverQuest, and there is no guarantee to what the other person looks like at the other end of the line. If people want to assume you&#39;re this beautiful female princess in RL, then let them. You shouldn&#39;t have to reveal who you are if you do not want to, but you also might be surprised by their reactions if you decide to tell them. When I play, I want to escape and put my mind into that of the character. I actually become Sirenia and think the same way she does... any references to reality ruins that for me.<br/>
<br/>
It may be different when playing with any of you because our common bond in reality will follow suit, and I would love that. It will be interesting to see how reality and fantasy blends together in new guild, Mystic Alliance. I can&#39;t wait to meet all of you and travel with you. Anyway, I&#39;ve babbled enough. Sorry for making this message so long but I thought I should respond. Good luck, my friends. I will see you online soon...<br/>

P.S. - David and others... I will let you know what my character name is soon. I haven&#39;t decided what I wanted to play quite yet... it will depend on what everyone else plays. I want to make sure we have a good complement of race and class in our guild. Having said that, would you be able to send me a copy of the list of characters that are on Brell Serilis so far? Thanks.  *hugs*</div>
