<div id="ygrps-yiv-785128045">Hello there,<br/>
<br/>
The Robe of the ORACLE  is located on the oracle of Ar&#39;knon who is on a<br/>
island in OOT. I am no where close to being able to go there, so Ill wait<br/>
another 6 levels.<br/>
<br/>
Barbed Leather Whip is on the Bone Crusher or Goblin Magician in Najena<br/>
<br/>
The Bone Bladed Claymore is in Befallen on the 3rd level held by a Shadow<br/>
Knight<br/>
<br/>
Gladius is in &quot;Unrest&quot; on a rare spawn called the Lesser Blade Fiend<br/>
<br/>
Polished Granite Tomahawk is in Highhold held by Grenix Muck Tail<br/>
<br/>
Crystaline Blade is in Everfrost held by a Goblin Champion<br/>
<br/>
Demon claws.. ?? dont know..<br/>
<br/>
As far As the jorneyman boots, they give you a temporary SoW. It has<br/>
unlimited charges, so you can run around all the time like you are SOWed<br/>
<br/>
Anything else you need info on ?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>

My highest character is a Magician14... then a Bard13, so I&#39;m kinda<br/>
unfamiliar with the really good items and how to get them. Except the Oracle<br/>
Robe.. just kill that Oracle. ((Of course &#39;ve never actually done it hehe)).<br/>
What exactly are the journeyman boots? Everyone just says it gives the<br/>
journeyman effect...  And is there a specific place to get a BBC? Any place<br/>
to get a barbed leather whip? Demon Claws? &quot;Gladius&quot;? Crystalline Sword?<br/>
PGT?? AHHHHH!!! So many!!!!! Any help would be appreciated :~)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all! heheh<br/>

&lt;&lt; I spent 9 hours straight waiting for jman&#39;s boots to spawn for me.  They<br/>
 never did.  Drelzna spawned during that time, she just didn&#39;t have the<br/>
 boots.<br/>
<br/>
 There&#39;s no anti-camp code there, though.  The place is camped on Tunare<br/>
24/7<br/>
 and people come away with boots.  A friend of mine went there and got them<br/>
 on the first spawn (the wench! ;)<br/>
<br/>
 I think I just have horrible luck with spawns like this.  The same thing<br/>
 happened for the BBC =P &gt;&gt;<br/>
