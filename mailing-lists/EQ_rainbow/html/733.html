<div id="ygrps-yiv-263489800">OK, I&#39;m one of those that can turn it on & run it, but don&#39;t know a <br/>
thing about what&#39;s inside. I THINK mine has an AMD whatever chip -- <br/>
550 thingies if I remember correctly. I know the 3D whats-it is one <br/>
that&#39;s either not actually listed for EQ, or is buried deep in the <br/>
compatability list on the main site -- not one listed right on the <br/>
Kunark box, at any rate. Same for the sound card. I also have 64 RAM, <br/>
& a 56k modem. I have no norrathly idea how far I am from my isp, or <br/>
even how to find that out. Oh, the comp itself is a Compaq Presario <br/>
something-or-other.<br/>
<br/>
  SOOooo... what piece of this should I look to upgrade 1st in order <br/>
to get better run of EQ? I think most of you know I am the slowest <br/>
zoner in the guild, & lately I&#39;ve been having worse problems with lag <br/>
& ld than usual (which may be isp-load related & not something I can <br/>
upgrade, but I don&#39;t know). This is death for a bard, & making it <br/>
really tough to twist songs. I just bought the comp 2 months ago, but <br/>
could upgrade some piece, I think. Can&#39;t switch isp, since I got a <br/>
discount for signing up with them for 3 years.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for any helpful advice!<br/>
