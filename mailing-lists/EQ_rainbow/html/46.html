&lt;&lt; Perhaps we should consider David&#39;s idea of setting up this &quot;GLBT&quot; guild on <br/>
the new roleplaying server, Brell Serilis. We could all start from scratch <br/>
and learn about each other in a group of the same level. Sirenia is a Level <br/>
24 High Elven Cleric, but I would be willing to give it all up to start again <br/>
with all of you if you are interested. Then I am certain we would have enough <br/>
members to form a guild there. What does everyone think of this? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This idea sounds great to me! I&#39;m willing to stand behind it! I think it&#39;d be <br/>
great to get a whole gay/lesbian guild going!<br/>
