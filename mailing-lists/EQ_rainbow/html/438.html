&gt; <br/>
&gt; Quick Wit:<br/>
&gt; A kangaroo kept getting out of his enclosure at the zoo.<br/>
&gt; Knowing that he could hop high, the zoo officials put up a<br/>
&gt; ten-foot fence.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He was out the next morning, just sauntering around the zoo. A<br/>
&gt; twenty-foot fence was put up. Again he got out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When the fence was forty feet high, a camel in the next<br/>
&gt; enclosure asked the kangaroo, &quot;How high do you think they&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; go?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The kangaroo said, &quot;About a thousand feet, unless somebody<br/>
&gt; locks the gate at night!&quot;<br/>
