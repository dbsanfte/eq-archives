<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137877133">Hello all and everyone =)<br/>
<br/>
First off I wanted to thank Christina for creating this mailing-list (it<br/>
happened to be the day after Gay Pride in NYC - Which was awesome by the<br/>
way =P) !<br/>
Well , since everyone talked a little about themselves and their characters<br/>
I figured I should do the same =)<br/>
Here it goes :<br/>
My character name is Nystul , a level 29 Paladin who fights for justice in<br/>
the world of Norrath . He judges people individually , not by their race or<br/>
class (Exception being Dark-elf Necros and SK&#39;s since they have sworn<br/>
themselves to the path of evil and oppose directly as to what my character<br/>
stands for ... most of &#39;em at least =P ) . I haven&#39;t really thought about<br/>
RP&#39;ing my character as a gay person , even though I think it could be fun<br/>
and interesting . <br/>
<br/>
Alrighty , ooc :<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a 19 year old - almost 20 (July 10th , Wohooo !!!) gay guy living in<br/>
NYC . I don&#39;t have many gay friends (As strange as it might seem from<br/>
someone living in NYC , but it&#39;s true !!) and wish to make more . So I<br/>
guess this mailing list is a good start since all of us have a common<br/>
interest ... EQ =P<br/>
Anyway , that&#39;s all I have to say for now so take care all =)<br/>
<br/>
