<div id="ygrps-yiv-141202075">I ran into him again today and let him know that I wasnt the original user.<br/>
He was suprise but didnt mind at all. We went to the LOWER level of GUK<br/>
today and killed the LORD there and I got Ghoulbane.  We are planning to<br/>
get together this weekend too. Nice guy! I thought he would be mad but he<br/>
didnt mind. Said He didnt use plat much anymore because at 39th level most<br/>
of the things he used he got from killing things. I felt a lot better. My<br/>
conscience it clear now :-)<br/>
