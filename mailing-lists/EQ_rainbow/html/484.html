<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141830527">Gotta agree here... I play on two servers, I level slow as hell, but I&#39;m<br/>
having a great time. I still haven&#39;t quite decided what I want to do for<br/>
my MA character, but when I start her I will holler and getting up to<br/>
lvl 6 or so you can start to get off and play with the people around you<br/>
rather then worry about leveling slow as heck... = )<br/>
