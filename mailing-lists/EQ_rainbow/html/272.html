<b>Subject:</b> twinking <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-922296405">i know what twinking is i have done it once but i dont know if it a<br/>
banable offence. i had a 15th lvl rogue (redspider) but i was also a<br/>
+pvp and by 15th lvl i was sick of it (btw i never killed another player<br/>
nor had i ever been killed by another) so i got together with one of my<br/>
guildmates and i gave him all of the stuff red owned and then proceeded<br/>
to delete red (SOB, SOB) then created redspider all over again, i then<br/>
went to my guildmate and he gave me all of my stuff so here i was a 1st<br/>
lvl rogue with all of the stuff that a 15th lvl rogue had earned, THAT<br/>
my friends is twinking but i did it for a good reason others do it<br/>
because they are bored with their current character and so give all of<br/>
their stuff to a new character and play like that, and dont delete their<br/>
old characer so if they want to play that old characer all they have to<br/>
do is trade the stuff back to it. (sorry about my horrible grammer<br/>
skills, one long run-on sentece after the other) that i look down on but<br/>
i would not say it is a bad thing just not for me.<br/>
