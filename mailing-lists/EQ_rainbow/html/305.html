<div id="ygrps-yiv-969033941">Hey,<br/>
<br/>
Well, heres a little problem that follows the issue...<br/>
I play a level 30 half-elf female, and from day one I&#39;ve always had guys <br/>
hitting on me, hehe.. Well in RL Im just a 20yr male w/ a fairly feminime <br/>
personality and I love to dress and look like a girl when I have the <br/>
oppurtunity.. Problem is Im totally straight so when guys hit on me I kinda <br/>
like freak out and try to avoid them. Although one guy in particular never <br/>
leaves me alone. He really is a nice guy. He groups with me alot and points <br/>
some great hunting grounds out. Of course I never had the guts to tell him I <br/>
really am a guy. He is around level 45 and knows alot of the high level <br/>
people, and the last thing I want is to be constantly harrased by all of <br/>
them when I start exploring the high level dungeons and need these people in <br/>
my group.. Well, anywayz hes always trying to smooch me and such, and I just <br/>
don&#39;t think I can be comfy roleplaying that.. maybe I should tell him I have <br/>
a in game boyfriend already? Hmm, probably a little too late for that now.. <br/>
