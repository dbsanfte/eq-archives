<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400844182">Sounds like it may be a good idea to start a &#39;roster&#39; of folks here.<br/>
<br/>
How about we get a little intro from as many people on the list who want to<br/>
contribute?  I created a template, feel free to modify it or add to it, but<br/>
I want to keep it short enough that people will actually fill it out.<br/>
Perhaps someone could keep this list, and we could publish it monthly?<br/>
