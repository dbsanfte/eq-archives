<div id="ygrps-yiv-734259761">Hey Rob!  Welcome to Rodcet Nife!!!  I am running around the Oasis <br/>
right now but was planning on heading back to the Faydark area.  I am <br/>
getting close to hitting level 17 and need to train in Dual Wield.<br/>
<br/>
I will look for you and give you a /t if I see ya.  Don&#39;t think we can <br/>
group, but I can kind of keep an eye out for ya.  Have been grouping <br/>
with a few druids from my guild though so maybe they can help you out.<br/>

&gt; Thanks everyone for the great welcome.  I created a new character <br/>
&gt; last night on Rodcet Nife, a druid  his name is Dominoe if anyone is <br/>
&gt; around I would love to group.  He is in Freeport at the moment but <br/>
&gt; unless I can get a bond I need to get back to Kel.  I will be on <br/>
&gt; tonite around 10 CST if anyone wants to help train a new druid in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; ways of Tunare.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; May Tunare smile on you all,<br/>
