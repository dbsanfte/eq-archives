My friends seem to think that I am a big time computer geek because i play<br/>

I am thinking that maybe we should get the SF club kids hooked on<br/>
everquest.. this way we could have a elite-&quot;family&quot;-force that will take<br/>
Norrath by storm..  HEHE silly idea.. maybe.. but hey it was fun to think of<br/>
it.<br/>
