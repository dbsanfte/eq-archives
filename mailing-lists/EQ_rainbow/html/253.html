<b>Subject:</b> Guild Name and Charter <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148309177">Our name &quot;The Unity&quot; was of course rejected since the other guild was<br/>
called &quot;Unity&quot;. I have now changed the name to &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; and<br/>
added to the charter to include a little bit of the backstory for the<br/>
name and formation of the guild.<br/>
<br/>
I will keep you informed, but my guess at this point is we won&#39;t be able<br/>
to get it approved till Wednesday at the earliest.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
