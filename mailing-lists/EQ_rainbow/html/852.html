<div id="ygrps-yiv-428554475">As a resident breeder, I can tell you its not just l33t d00dz who use &quot;gay&quot;<br/>
in such a context.  It has become part of the general all-purpose &quot;kid<br/>
slang&quot; and is used as early as first grade.  And I can date it back to at<br/>
least 4 years ago.  When we moved into town off our isolated farm .. our<br/>
oldest kid was then a 3rd grader.  She came home after the first couple of<br/>
weeks of school and asked me what &quot;gay&quot; meant.  When I raised my eyebrows at<br/>
her a bit (sure she&#39;s precocious but asking that at barely eight?), she told<br/>
me it was used as a general purpose insult and she wanted to know what it<br/>
meant.  To give her credit, she was introduced to &quot;cuss&quot; words in context<br/>
(we use them well at home), and taught to check out the appropriateness of<br/>
any new words and thier meaning so she will pick the proper times to use the<br/>
word (and so I won&#39;t get any phone calls from school that my kid told the<br/>
teacher &quot;Fuck you bitch!&quot; - hehe)   The end of our discussion was her not<br/>
using the word herself in that context and socially bashing the kids who<br/>
did.  A year later, as she got to know other kids better, she realized<br/>
another girl in our neighborhood her age has a &quot;gay&quot; (lesbian) aunt.  Now<br/>
the two girls are fairly well known for deriding any who use &quot;gay&quot; in that<br/>
context in school.<br/>
<br/>
I would bet that almost ALL the kids using it at that age had no clue of its<br/>
meaning to an adult.  I fault the adults for not correcting them ... but if<br/>
they are using it from first grade up .. good luck getting them to break te<br/>
habit as a teen.  Even if, as a teen, they understand the meaning and<br/>
insensitivity of that usage.  That has been the response of several teens<br/>
whom after I verbally smacked them about for using &quot;gay&quot;.   - &quot;Owww I agree,<br/>
but its going to be VERY hard to break the habit&quot;.  I have seen children who<br/>
are otherwise well-behaved elementary schoolers using the word.  The only<br/>
difference was that the well-parented ones, once the parent had been told I<br/>
found the word offensive (and that thier seven year old was spouting out<br/>
&quot;gay&quot; with no idea what it meant - hehe) .. those children have stopped<br/>
using it when adults are present.   But in middle and high school, its use<br/>
is still common ...<br/>
<br/>
I was on Brell, and most of us that were active in the defunct MA chapter<br/>
there have moved to Rodcet.  But, I&#39;d expect the slang to be everywhere on<br/>
all servers.<br/>

them means - muhahahah!<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m 33. I started RPG-ing in 1980 with D&D and Gamma World. I was<br/>
&gt; away from RPG&#39;s for many years and even now EQ is my only RPG outlet.<br/>
&gt; I played Magic: The Gathering for a while but it simply became too<br/>
&gt; frickin expensive and, to me, pointless. When? When did the<br/>
&gt; word &quot;gay&quot; become -- in the gaming crowd (which now seems to be made<br/>
&gt; up of teeming hordes of 13 yr old boys with a lot of their parents&#39;<br/>
&gt; money and No Clue) -- synonymous<br/>
&gt; with &quot;lame&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;useless&quot;, &quot;weak&quot; and just about any and every<br/>
&gt; other negative adjective?<br/>
