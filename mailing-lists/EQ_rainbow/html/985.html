<div id="ygrps-yiv-554898209">Yes, Armande is correct...the guild is definitely still around and <br/>
doing well.  I also moved from Mithaniel Marr to Rodcet Nife.  It&#39;s <br/>
been a lot of fun and the members are great.  I haven&#39;t missed my <br/>
Mithaniel Marr characters a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Give me a tell if you see me online, i&#39;d be glad to help.<br/>

&gt; The Mystic alliance (www.mysticalliance.com) does indeed exist, and <br/>
there<br/>
&gt; are around 60 members (about 40 of which are semi to fully active). <br/>
I fall<br/>
&gt; into the inactive category. (on a hiatus for various reasons, not <br/>
the least<br/>
&gt; of which is Anarchy Online) We are on the Rodcet NIfe server, and <br/>
the web<br/>
&gt; page should give you an idea of us. (There&#39;s a fine, active message <br/>
board<br/>
&gt; there). As far as officers, they&#39;d be Snapdragyn, Ompa, Taren, <br/>
Gwynap,<br/>
&gt; Gunarr, Aethyra, Trinic, Marri, Gaiwan, Vargyr, Andelyve, Gaybriel, <br/>
Leta, or<br/>
&gt; Armande (if I&#39;m on...still have some time left on the current pay<br/>
&gt; period...stop in now and then to say hi). If I left out any <br/>
officers, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sorry. Anyone else in the guild would be happy to talk to ya, but <br/>
those are<br/>
&gt; the people who can do the inviting. :-) So we&#39;re not by any means <br/>
dead.<br/>
