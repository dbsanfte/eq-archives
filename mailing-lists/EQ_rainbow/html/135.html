&gt; Gang,<br/>
&gt; Today - I had a run in with one of the GMs.  You&#39;re not going to believe this,<br/>
&gt; but it&#39;s shades of Ultima Online all over again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know what to say honestly, all the problems I have been having as of late,<br/>
the server nonesense, the Rogue class being ignored save for the few scraps thrown<br/>
it a second ago. And I&#39;ve even heard some nasty GM &quot;I don&#39;t give a fuck&quot; stories.<br/>
This takes the cake, this goes against everything McQuaid said he didn&#39;t want EQ to<br/>
be. This makes them all slimeball liars IMHO. In a word this enrages me in a way no<br/>
words can express...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We all know that character names are restricted by bounds of good<br/>
&gt; taste/decency/keeping with the spirit of the game.  So you can imagine I was a<br/>
&gt; little surprised when a characer named &quot;Cokaine&quot; shows up.  Not only that, he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; using /ooc to carry on private conversations all over the place on Brell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I /tell him to please use a channel for side chatter.  I won&#39;t repeate the<br/>
&gt; response I got.  I warn him to cool it, or I /petition.  Use your imagination on<br/>
&gt; the response I got - and it was to store my goodies in a locked box either!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I give up and /petition.  This guy was really all over the place.  A few minutes<br/>
&gt; later, a GM pops up and tells me to not make false complaints!  I let him have<br/>
&gt; both barrels, and hard.  A minute later he comes back and tells me that in fact,<br/>
&gt; Cokaine is also known as Vampyre aka Jason White.  He&#39;s a GM!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I asked why he could get away this conduct.  The GM says &quot;he&#39;s had a bad day -<br/>
&gt; his wife died yesterday&quot;.  C&#39;mon - do I have &quot;Hello I&#39;m a stupid 14 year old&quot;<br/>
&gt; written on my forehead?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>His wife died eh? Why don&#39;t I believe he&#39;d be playing EQ if his wife died. I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be playing EQ if my mate died. This is bullshit pure and simple. Congrats<br/>
people, welcome to the new P.T. Barnum show and guess who all the suckers are? This<br/>
way to the egress people, Asheron&#39;s Call is beginning to sound better everyday....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Needless to say, I&#39;ve sent a formal complaint in.  I&#39;d suggest that if you get<br/>
&gt; someone who&#39;s just a bit too obnoxious, don&#39;t be suprised if it&#39;s a GM.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*sigh* Maybe I&#39;m just disgruntled, maybe I&#39;m right. Maybe none of the GMs give a<br/>
damn, I happen to think that. I am truly disgusted at this point, when will people<br/>
learn that the UO &quot;Band-Aid&quot; approach doesn&#39;t work? If monsters are having AI<br/>
problems with objects you don&#39;t make them &quot;Omnipotent masters of death&quot;, you just<br/>
spend some time fixing the problem. But oh, I&#39;m sorry, that takes effort, a word<br/>
editing out by Verant&#39;s language filter apparently. I feel kind of sad that I<br/>
finally found a nice community in the midst of this festering shithole of a game,<br/>
but hey, Humanity has been fucking each other over for thousands of years, why drop<br/>
the tradition now?<br/>
