&gt; <br/>
&gt; My ideas for our charter and lower down the &#39;back story&#39; thing I promised<br/>
&gt; yesterday.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Share your thoughts, ideas, and criticisms. Thanks.<br/>
&gt; ---------------------------<br/>
&gt; Charter:<br/>
&gt; The Guild is open to citizens of Norath, regardless of race, class, sex,<br/>
&gt; religion and sexual orientation. All Guild members must show respect to others<br/>
&gt; whether they are in the Guild or not. No homophobes will be allowed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The purpose of the Guild is:<br/>
&gt; o  to use our resources for mutual benefit<br/>
&gt; o  to adventure together in an atmosphere where we are not subjected to<br/>
&gt; homophobic comments<br/>
&gt; o  to enhance the enjoyment of life in Norath for all of us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The above part of the charter is universal to all servers on which our guild<br/>
&gt; may have members.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On Brell Serilis and other role playing servers, our charter is additionally:<br/>
&gt; o  to encourage RPing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How does all of the above sound????<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do we want some other common goal? Would we all one day like to have a guild<br/>
&gt; strong enough to slay a dragon? Is there some other universal goal we could<br/>
&gt; all agree on that might be a theme for our guild and that might therefore<br/>
&gt; suggest a name? Like the dragon thing. I&#39;d like to be part of a group that got<br/>
&gt; one, you know... Wouldn&#39;t we all one day?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yesterday, I said I&#39;d post a back story for our guild. I have not until now<br/>
&gt; because I thought about totally rewriting it, but then I decided I&#39;ll just<br/>
&gt; post it and let someone else totally rewrite it. It is below. The first person<br/>
&gt; who wants to take a crack at a rewrite, just tell us on the list and then<br/>
&gt; we&#39;ll wait for you to post your version and then the next person can.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some guidelines. I&#39;d like the backstory to include a prominent male and female<br/>
&gt; hero and heroine. You may include as much Norathian lore as you desire. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know much yet and haven&#39;t put much in. Feel free to include more of<br/>
&gt; this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, someone either edit what I have or throw it out and start over. I cranked<br/>
&gt; this puppy out in about 5 minutes, so I won&#39;t be offended at all if the whole<br/>
&gt; thing is pitched, but maybe it can be a starting point or at least get the<br/>
&gt; imagination working.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here it is:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cleric Elgen Baknor was a disciple of The Queen of Love. After learning all<br/>
&gt; about the love that Erollisi Marr espoused, he decided to leave the Temple of<br/>
&gt; Marr because he wanted to experience that love.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Having entered the priesthood because he could not see himself falling in love<br/>
&gt; with a woman, he eventually met and fell in love with a man whose identity is<br/>
&gt; shrouded in mystery. It is believed he may have been a man who held high rank<br/>
&gt; in the Temple. Eventually though, Elgen would realize the relationship would<br/>
&gt; not work for he was unable to openly express his love for this mysterious man.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Elgen had heard of a woman who was a mighty warrior in Faydwer who loved other<br/>
&gt; women in the same way he loved men. He set out to find her.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Elgen left the city of Freeport and ventured to Faydwer. On his journey, he<br/>
&gt; picked up many friends who believed, just as Elgen, that love was the answer,<br/>
&gt; regardless of gender. He asked each of his friends if they had heard of this<br/>
&gt; woman whose heart belonged to another woman. But none had.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finally, one day the group came upon two women at a campsite normally<br/>
&gt; inhabited by numerous Orcs, but on this day, no Orcs were to be seen. Suddenly<br/>
&gt; though, an Orc sprang out of nowhere. Fearing for their lives Elgen&#39;s group<br/>
&gt; began to run. But in the corner of his eye, Elgen saw one of the two women<br/>
&gt; pull out a long sword and strike down the Orc in a matter of seconds, while<br/>
&gt; the other woman, continued to sit undisturbed in silent meditation. This<br/>
&gt; supreme warrior introduced herself and her lover to the small group. [Need a<br/>
&gt; name for her and her lover]<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This small band of cast out souls formed their own community, a small camp in<br/>
&gt; the recesses of Lesser Faydark. Together, these men and women took the best<br/>
&gt; ideals of Erollisi Marr and combined them with their own beliefs. Their small<br/>
&gt; sect, comprised originally of only followers of Erollisi Marr, eventually<br/>
&gt; began to attract followers of other deities, even the Plaguebringer. For no<br/>
&gt; matter their race or class, spread throughout the lands of Norath were people<br/>
&gt; who believed that love did not have to be restricted to only the opposite<br/>
&gt; gender. This one belief united them despite all their other diversity and they<br/>
&gt; would eventually become known as &#39;[guild name goes here]&#39;.<br/>
&gt; ----------------<br/>
&gt; So, there&#39;s my cheesy attempt at a back story. Who wants to to take a crack at<br/>
&gt; it. You can&#39;t make it any worse than it is, so someone give it a try.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hugs,<br/>
&gt; David<br/>
