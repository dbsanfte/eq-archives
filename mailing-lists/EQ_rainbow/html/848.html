<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-907397266">Thanks to everyone who responded to my posting. I&#39;m sad to see that <br/>
there are, apparently, so few gay/lesbian players on Brell; or at <br/>
least who are also a member of this eGroup.<br/>
<br/>
My friends and I *don&#39;t* want to change servers, so we are <br/>
considering starting our own gay/lesbian guild on Brell. The problem <br/>
is, there aren&#39;t enough of us.<br/>
<br/>
I know the process for starting a guild. My qustion is, for those of <br/>
you involved in Nameless Love or Mystic Alliance, how did you get 10 <br/>
people? Did you advertise in general (such as in a forum) or did you <br/>
just happen to know 10 other gay/lesbian EQ players, or, well... how <br/>
did it come together.<br/>
<br/>
Considering what I&#39;m finding to be a generally gay-intolerant <br/>
attitude on EQ, I hesitate to start a forum thread about a new gay <br/>
guild or sit around on the chat server hoping 9 other gay people show <br/>
up who want to start a guild.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 33. I started RPG-ing in 1980 with D&D and Gamma World. I was <br/>
away from RPG&#39;s for many years and even now EQ is my only RPG outlet. <br/>
I played Magic: The Gathering for a while but it simply became too <br/>
frickin expensive and, to me, pointless. When? When did the <br/>
word &quot;gay&quot; become -- in the gaming crowd (which now seems to be made <br/>
up of teeming hordes of 13 yr old boys with a lot of their parents&#39; <br/>
money and No Clue) -- synonymous <br/>
with &quot;lame&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;useless&quot;, &quot;weak&quot; and just about any and every <br/>
other negative adjective?<br/>
<br/>
I spent 15 minutes in Oasis of Marr the other day riding the virtual <br/>
ass of some lame k3wl d00d because he made the /shout &quot;Somebody come <br/>
kill this gay SG please!&quot; I proceeded to riddle him with questions, <br/>
in /shout, such as &quot;How do you know he is gay?&quot; &quot;Does he mince when <br/>
he walks?&quot; &quot;Is his name in lavender or pink over his head?&quot; &quot;Is his <br/>
name Bruce?&quot; &quot;Is he listening to the Village People?&quot; Etc., etc. <br/>
While my very tongue in cheek and often virulent replies ilicited <br/>
some laughs, several people /shout-ed back stuff like &quot;eww&quot; <br/>
and &quot;that&#39;s gross&quot;. Mainly because initially the player&#39;s response to <br/>
me was &quot;Because he&#39;ll rip you a new asshole&quot;. My response to that <br/>
was &quot;Well my boss does that and I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s a breeder&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I was under the impression that tolerance was on the upswing, in <br/>
general anyway. It seems like on EQ that isn&#39;t the case. Is this <br/>
server specific or do any of the rest of you have problems with this? <br/>
