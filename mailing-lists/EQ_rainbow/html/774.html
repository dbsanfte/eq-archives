<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852670960">I took the plunge and created a new character on RN this evening. My new<br/>
High Elf Cleric, Kythwin began his existence in that hellhole of a zone<br/>
known as the Greater Faydark (dark, no loot, too many people and all<br/>
that infernal shouting!). After a couple of hours, I had him up to 3rd<br/>
level and it was off to Freeport, a place I find much more congenial. I<br/>
guess you could say that Kyth is like most gay men, began life in<br/>
someplace dim and depressing but took off at the first opportunity for<br/>
the big bright city!! Now I hope to make contact with someone from<br/>
Mystic Alliance and join up as soon as possible...I will be keeping my<br/>
eyes open as I bash those ugly orcs over the head and hope to see<br/>
someone soon.<br/>

Kythwin, Cleric of the Tunare, 3rd Circle</div>
