<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-346476698">It had been a long day at the forge, and as Ompa sat on the old <br/>
stump she used for a chair and looked over the latest additions to <br/>
her little library of smithy books she was a bit overwhelmed and very <br/>
excited at the same time. Dwifa had run into town as soon as she <br/>
heard rumor of the new designs that had been discovered, and the <br/>
helpful young Paladin had brought them by on her way to kill some of <br/>
the peskier inhabitants of the Butcher Block Mountains.<br/>
     There laid books on how to make plate armor, how to dye it, and <br/>
how to make the other odds & ends required in the making of this new <br/>
forgeable armor.  Dwifa had even found her a map that would lead her <br/>
to the ores she would now be in need of to further her craft!  As the <br/>
little dwarf thumbed through the pages you could hear her reading the <br/>
material in the soft whisper of someone deep in thought.  <br/>
     `Plate armor must be made with Medium Quality Ore, as the <br/>
standard ores, once folded, can&#39;t stand up to the heavy blows<br/>
taken in battle.&#39;<br/>
     Interesting, thought Ompa, this will be more difficult to master <br/>
than Banded armor was, but it may be a challenge worth undertaking.  <br/>
     `After forming the bricks of ore into blocks, now you must<br/>
use a smithy hammer to force the metal into a large sheet.  Then <br/>
while the metal is still hot fold it upon itself twice and then pound <br/>
it out again. Repeating this process strengthens the metal to the <br/>
point it can be used in the sturdy armor that any who wear it will <br/>
feel protected in.&#39;  <br/>
     It seams as though my strength is going to be an asset now more <br/>
than ever! , She mused.<br/>
     `After folding the sheets they are now ready to be placed<br/>
over a mold suited to the wearer, and hammered onto the form, using <br/>
water to temper the steel once it is done.&#39;  <br/>
<br/>
     By now it was getting quite dark, and being a Dwarf Ompa was <br/>
thirsty for more than the milk or water she kept with her.  So, after <br/>
a seconds thought Ompa gathered these new texts and went off to show <br/>
Master Forgewell, the best smith in all of Norrath and her mentor. <br/>
Besides, Dwifa made mention that Hamyrmint would be there, and since <br/>
he had taken up brewing he always had a supply of Ol&#39;Tumjim&#39;s<br/>
Fierce Brew on hand.  <br/>
     On her way to the Forgewell spread Ompa pulled out the text <br/>
dealing with the tailored components needed to line the armor.  As <br/>
she read she was glad to see the silk threads she had collected would <br/>
be able to go to a better use than bandages.  And, although the <br/>
thought of trying to find the quality pelts didn&#39;t thrill her too <br/>
much, she still made a mental note to hop the boat to Freeport and <br/>
wander over to the Karanas to see what she could scrounge up.  <br/>
Turning down the fork in the path Ompa slipped the book back into her <br/>
pack and made her way up to the gate.  To this day she was still in <br/>
awe of the craftsmanship that went into the ornate ironwork that made <br/>
up the short fence and gate that marked the edge of the Forgewell <br/>
property. Steelhart had told her of the many years he had put into <br/>
forming it all into just the right shapes and designs, often using it <br/>
as a visual to show his young apprentice what she could do once she <br/>
was a master of her craft.  Noticing a small bit of rust had crept <br/>
onto the gate, and knowing how the old dwarf felt about such things <br/>
she paused.  Pulling out a bit of dwarven wire she proceeded to treat <br/>
the gate, collecting the oxide to use in the new dye, then rubbing a <br/>
small bit of gnomish grease onto the spot to prevent future <br/>
occurrences. <br/>
     Walking up to the house she was met by Hamyr, who quickly thrust <br/>
a drink into her hand and gave her a hug that she was sure almost <br/>
cracked a rib. <br/>
     Mental note to self: replace chain mail with plate┬à<br/>
     `Glad to see your still alive Omp!&#39; not one for<br/>
sentiment Hamyr was always quick with his wit `thought for sure<br/>
you had been carried of by a griffin or some such.&#39;<br/>
     `Glad to see you to Hamy┬àI knew I could count on you for<br/>
a warm welcome.&#39; Ompa raised the bottle in salute and <br/>
drank,`khef┬àughh┬àand a warm beer! How long has this been<br/>
sitting <br/>
out!?!&#39;<br/>
     `It&#39;s fresh from the barrel, I can&#39;t seem to keep<br/>
enough on hand to chill it for some reason.&#39; <br/>
     `Oh, I really wonder why that is┬àanyway, is your father<br/>
in the house? I have something I want to show him, if he hasn&#39;t<br/>
seen it already.&#39;<br/>
     The two friends walked up to the house and on into the kitchen <br/>
where Steelhart sat at the table talking to Dwifa, `I tell you I <br/>
think she has a, er hey! When did you get here Ompa!&#39; the old<br/>
dwarf rose off his seat to give Ompa a hug, surly cracking that <br/>
previously bruised rib.<br/>
     `I hope I&#39;m not disturbing you Master Forgewell&#39;<br/>
     `Oh, dad was just telling me that he thought you wou┬à&#39;<br/>
Her father, who one could almost swear was blushing, cut Dwifa short.<br/>
     `I, I was just telling the girl how I thought you had a, <br/>
inquiring mind, yes, that&#39;s right. She had told me of the texts<br/>
she found for you in town and I was just remembering how eager you <br/>
always were to learn new smithing techniques.&#39; He was dotting his<br/>
brow with one of his ever-present rags as he gestured for his son &<br/>
prot├®g├® to sit down.<br/>
     `Yes! I came directly here to go over these with you, and see<br/>
what you thought of all this!&#39; a gleam came to Ompas eyes as she<br/>
told Steelhart of all she had been reading.  The new material, and <br/>
the fact that for once she felt closer to an equal with this man, <br/>
whom she has admired for so many years, excited her. Only closer <br/>
though, as she knew she would never be as great a smith as the <br/>
renowned Steelhart Forgewell.<br/>
     The two smiths talked into the wee hours of the morning and the <br/>
old master saw that it was time to share a long kept secret with this <br/>
bright young girl, <br/>
     `Get Hamyrmint up off the floor & bring him out to the<br/>
forge.&#39; With that he stood up from the table, opened the back<br/>
door, and walked out into the morning rain.<br/>
     Ompa walked over to where Hamyr had passed out the night before, <br/>
and gave him a swift kick in the rump. `GOOD MORNING!&#39;<br/>
     `Ahhh!, could you keep it down? And what are you doing<br/>
waking me up this early!?!&#39;<br/>
     `OH, IS IT EARLY?!?&#39; Ompa relished in the fact she knew<br/>
Ham&#39;s head was throbbing, after all her ribs were still<br/>
sore┬àand she<br/>
knew he would, and had done the same thing to her.<br/>
     `Go, Away&#39; <br/>
     Hehee such a grump he is, `Your father wants us at the<br/>
forge.&#39;<br/>
     That woke him, even though he hadn&#39;t been interested in<br/>
smithing as a youngster, he was a little more interested in what he <br/>
remembered from the night before┬àand even if he wasn&#39;t, he<br/>
still did<br/>
what his father asked, as soon as he was asked.<br/>
     The two grabbed their cloaks and made their way to the forge, it <br/>
was still raining, but it was tapering off. They both stood there <br/>
waiting for the elder Forgewell to speak.<br/>
     `These new books of yours, they cover the making of Fine<br/>
Steel.  Yes, it can be colored and is good protection, but it is <br/>
still plain.&#39; <br/>
     Steelhart paused, as if he was about to reveal the meaning of <br/>
life to these two youngsters, and as far as he was concerned he <br/>
was.    <br/>
     Hamyr and Ompa stood stock still, waiting for him to continue.<br/>
     `Dwarven Plate&#39; at this Omp & Hamy looked at each other<br/>
then back to Steelhart, they drew closer to him too, afraid they <br/>
might miss even a word.<br/>
     `Dwarven Plate is fashioned from Brellium ore, and can only<br/>
be fashioned in the Stormguard Forge that stands in our home city of <br/>
Kaladim.  It also requires a special temper, as water would make this <br/>
otherwise impenetrable armor brittle.&#39; At this Steelhart looked <br/>
directly at his son `I was glad to hear you took up brewing, as<br/>
that skill will be needed to make what is called Earthen Temper, you <br/>
will need to locate 2 drops of mercury, 1 lava rock, and a Dwarven <br/>
ale. Combine those in a brew barrel and hopefully you will succeed in <br/>
making the temper&#39;<br/>
     `Just hope he doesn&#39;t drink&#39; Ompa&#39;s sentence trailed<br/>
off as she was met with a stern gaze, &#39;it...&#39;<br/>
     Looking back too his son, `You know I was somewhat<br/>
disappointed when you took up the priesthood as your calling, as I <br/>
had hopped you would follow tradition & pick up the sword in defense <br/>
of your homeland.  But, I also know your calling is the higher one, <br/>
and now that you have advanced far enough I will share with you what <br/>
only those like you can do to make this plate come alive!  You, son, <br/>
can imbue a ruby with the spirit of Brell. Only those who have the <br/>
same strength of faith will be able to don this particular suit<br/>
though.&#39;  <br/>
     Steelhart turned to Ompa now, `You must make sure that you<br/>
place the proper stones in each piece of armor, and if the one you <br/>
are making it for is Agnostic, such as you are, then you must leave <br/>
them out entirely&#39;<br/>
     `Can anything else be forged from Brellium?&#39;  Ompa was<br/>
always one to want to know more about everything.<br/>
     `Yes, battle-axes, hammers and shields can all be made, and <br/>
imbued, from this precious metal.  And in time I will show you how to <br/>
make all of this, but for now let&#39;s go back inside, it is getting <br/>
cold and I&#39;m hungry.  Let&#39;s see what Kara has cooking.&#39; <br/>
     The old dwarf looked a foot taller as he put an arm around two <br/>
of his most prized possessions, and walked them back to the house.  <br/>
They both begged to learn more but he said they would have to work <br/>
some on this Fine Steel before they attempted to make this Holy <br/>
plate. <br/>
     `Now, I will help you when you are ready, but for now I&#39;m<br/>
hungry, and I&#39;m sure you would like to see Dwifa before she heads<br/>
out into the mountains for the day.&#39;  Steelhart looked at Ompa<br/>
and winked, as his son protested that he could care less to see his <br/>
bratty little sister and went into his usual rant about how he though <br/>
Dwifa was spoiled.<br/>
     At this Ompa felt a blush coming over her, and was glad for the <br/>
cold and her beard as they covered it well, for she new Hamyr would <br/>
tease her mercilessly if he had seen.  <br/>
     Kara stared at the three as they came into the kitchen, tracking <br/>
wet footprints behind them.  `If you three want anything you had <br/>
better get cleaned up before you sit down `ta the table!&#39;<br/>
     Knowing she meant business they all did as she said without one <br/>
gripe. Then returned to the table and sat down to there breakfast, <br/>
all wondering how this would turn out.&#39;<br/>

Ok, for those of you that want the nitty gritty on all the new <br/>
armor&#39;s go to:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqtraders.com/">http://www.eqtraders.com/</a>  <br/>
They have the best overall info on all trade skills, both recipes and <br/>
merchant/supply locations. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">http://eq.castersrealm.com/</a>  also has good <br/>
info, but I find it irritatingly difficult to navigate.<br/>
<br/>
May you always sell high and buy low!</div>
