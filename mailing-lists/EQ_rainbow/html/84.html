<div id="ygrps-yiv-526441756">Well,<br/>
<br/>
My bf and i just made charchters on the  new roleplay server but i still<br/>
feel weirrd becasue i dont really ant to split my time between my other<br/>
chatchter on Rodcet nife, or end up abdoning him!!! :(  My boyfreind feels<br/>
the same way, so maybe the multiple server guild idea is good!  I think<br/>
that the unity suggestion is a good start, maybe the guild constitution<br/>
(or whgatveer ytou call it) could be that we seeks to bring all the races,<br/>
sexes, sexual oreintatiin, species in Norrath togethe rin unity :)   sound<br/>
cool?  we should also state that it was started but GLBT poele in norrath<br/>
because they felt the pain of a dis-unified world...ehehhehe i love it (i<br/>
obviously am a role-player)  So thats my 10 cents, also I know of 3 other<br/>
poeple on Rodcet nife as of now that may be willing to join thius kind of<br/>
guild so if anyone on rodcet Nife would like to e-mial me and let me know<br/>
they want to be a part of it that would be cool, i wouldnt mind being the<br/>
guild master for Rodcet nife, maybe someone form each server should<br/>
volunteer to do this so we can start to expedite things.  What do you all<br/>
think of thhis?   If it dosnt fly, looks like i&#39;[m be plkaying on the new<br/>
server a bit :)<br/>
