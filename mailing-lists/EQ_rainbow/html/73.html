<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223050303">Hi all:) I just started a Feir&#39;Dal (woodsey elf) Rouge on Brell. <br/>
Granted the first night was pretty fucking annoying (and if you&#39;ve <br/>
ever been one a new server you can understand my veheminance); <br/>
but once the power gamers go away I think it looks promising. If <br/>
anyone is interested in  starting up a Guild look me up, my name <br/>
is Garret. I am making a rather focused effert to stick with a <br/>
character for the duration a, damn it all, I&#39;m going to even if it kills <br/>
me;)<br/>
See you guys later:)<br/>
Regardes,<br/>
