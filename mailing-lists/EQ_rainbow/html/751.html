Not sure if Gaydari mentioned it be there is a queer guild on rodcet Nife<br/>
called the Mystic Alliance.  You are welcome to join us there if you want<br/>
:)  We&#39;ve had a lot of poeple coming over to us from other serves lately,<br/>
even leaving their high lvl charhcters.  But they all tell me it has been<br/>
well-worth the move.   Adiitionally since the guild is set up, it can be<br/>
exported to any server.  We ahve done this previously on other serves,<br/>
Brell for instance, but i guess the guild has dwindled on those servers.<br/>
<br/>
If your not dead-set on ahving your guilds name we can easily export the<br/>
Mystic Allaince to the nameless even if its just you (i.e. you dont need<br/>
10 people) thast how the Mystic Alliance got to me about a year ago, and<br/>
now we have a ton of poelpe most of whom play regularly :)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m the one who&#39;s trying to create a queer guild on The Nameless <br/>
&gt; Server.  I&#39;ve already picked out &quot;Nameless Love&quot; as its name.  <br/>
&gt; Catchy, eh?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m hoping that I can snag a few people from here willing to help us <br/>
&gt; set up shop on the server.  I need at least 10 concurrent people to <br/>
&gt; sign on long enough to create the guild.  Anyone willing to donate at <br/>
&gt; least that much time to the cause?  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, you can read the charter I typed up for it at <br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://antinomy.org/nameless.html">http://antinomy.org/nameless.html</a> .  Be forewarned, this site works <br/>
&gt; only when my pc is not booted into Win2000 to play games (including <br/>
&gt; EQ).  When I&#39;m not goofing around, I have it booted to BeOS with the <br/>
&gt; webserver running.  So if the address doesn&#39;t connect, just try again <br/>
&gt; later.<br/>
