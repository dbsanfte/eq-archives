&lt;&lt; Hello All,<br/>
 <br/>
 Good news, our guild is approved. Soon, members of the Mystic Alliance will <br/>
be wandering the world of Norrath. Unfortunately, it will take me awhile to <br/>
get the<br/>
 various chapters established on the servers that we need. I will be out of <br/>
town Aug. 7 -14 (argh! a whole week without EQ) but on Sunday the 15th, I <br/>
hope to get<br/>
 the chapters set up.<br/>
 <br/>
 I will be the guildmaster on Brell Serillis, but I will need others to do <br/>
the same on the other servers. I know several of you have mentioned you&#39;d be <br/>
willing to<br/>
 do it, so please tell me again if you want to do it, and let me know which <br/>
server.<br/>
 <br/>
 I will attempt to get as many set up on Sunday the 15th, as I can.<br/>
 <br/>
 Thanks,<br/>
 David<br/>

I would be happy to be the guild master on the Bristlebane server. I dont <br/>
however know many GLBT on there. Would also have to be my new char. Lev 7 <br/>
Half Elf Ranger by the name of Zute. My other two chars are already in <br/>
guilds. <br/>
<br/>
I would like to meet some of us on that server. Just look me up when you fell <br/>
like it. <br/>
<br/>
Wampir Keogh. lev 25 Dark Elf Necro. &lt;Putrid Soul&gt;<br/>
Windom, Lev9 Barbarian Sham. (arnt they gorgus)<br/>
Zute, Lev 7 Half Elf Ranger. <br/>
<br/>
All on the bristlebane server<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
