<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615822868">Hi Lori!  Welcome.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having problems getting onto the MA mailing list.  I&#39;ve tried a dash and<br/>
underscore, but neither have worked.  Could someone please post the correct<br/>
subscription address, or email me privately with it?  Thanks<br/>
<br/>

lol lol..  hehe i&#39;ve been posting in the guild mailing list, i just wanted<br/>
to <br/>
be on this one too :D    Well, I would love to have ivy in our guild, but<br/>
she <br/>
is in her spouce&#39;s guild for now.. however i really want her to group with <br/>
the higher ups if thats ok!   I remember that one guy joined the guild just <br/>
for the SRo event that one time, but I think he used to be in the guild or <br/>
something..  so maybe thats why you made an exception??  :)    Well if <br/>
there&#39;s any more get togethers, would it be ok for ivy to join in the fun?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for good times!<br/>
