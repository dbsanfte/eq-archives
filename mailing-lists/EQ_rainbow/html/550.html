<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481513313">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
It is with a certain amount of sadness that I must announce that I will be<br/>
leaving the world of Norrath. There are many reasons for my decision, some<br/>
related to the game and some related to real life, but they have all added<br/>
up to make me decide it is time to leave the game. I&#39;ve not played now for a<br/>
couple of weeks and have not suffered any withdrawal symptoms, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
There are several implications to my decision that affect the Mystic<br/>
Alliance guild. First, if you are trying to get the guild going on other<br/>
servers, please /petition the GMs and ask to get the guild set up as soon as<br/>
possible so that I can help you if it should be necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I would like to send a message to the Verant person in charge of<br/>
guilds to have someone else made the guild owner of record. This means I<br/>
need a volunteer. If we get no volunteers, it may make things difficult<br/>
setting up more chapters of the guild later.<br/>
<br/>
Third, I need a person to be the guild master on Brell Serilis. Any takers?<br/>
We need to reform the  guild on that server anyway to get the correct guild<br/>
name.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, my two main Brell characters have some pretty good equipment and<br/>
cash that I would love to give to members of the guild. My level 21<br/>
necromancer, Dedric has full raw silk armor, RTS, Dagger of Marnek (sp?),<br/>
lots of containers, some level 16 and 20 spell scrolls, other misc. items<br/>
and over 100 PP in cash. I also have a lvl 4 warrior named Rainbow who has<br/>
partial rawhide armor, some nice FS weapons, a mino axe and some other misc.<br/>
items, plus a little cash. (Note, that the highly coveted name of Rainbow<br/>
will also become available, so let me know if you are interested in making a<br/>
new character with that name).  I would love to give all my stuff to my<br/>
guildmates, so let me know if any of you are interested. If anyone wanted to<br/>
start a necro on Brell, now would be the time ;)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I would like to say that being a part of this mailing list has been<br/>
a lot of fun and has enriched my life and my game-playing experience too.<br/>
While the list has been fairly quite lately and I have the feeling that some<br/>
of my friends may have left the list, I plan to continue to stay on the list<br/>
just to hear how things are going with all of you. You&#39;re a fun bunch and I<br/>
do really care about you.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to all,<br/>
David</div>
