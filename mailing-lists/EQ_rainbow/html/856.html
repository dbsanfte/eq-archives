<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-130687342">If it was just me, I would probably switch servers without <br/>
hesitation. Unfortunately, there&#39;s me, my lover, and our best friends <br/>
(another couple). I can discuss it with them, but I&#39;m not sure how <br/>
they would feel about leaving Brell. I think the four of us are in a <br/>
similar mindframe to dig in our heels and find the people to get it <br/>
going rather than evac out to another server and start (sigh) all <br/>
over again.<br/>
<br/>
And, ultimately, I know what one would say to the idea of ditching <br/>
his lvl 31 wizard. I know how I feel about abandoning my beloved <br/>
Grackk, source of much joy and aggravation (damn ogres level up <br/>
slower than you can possibly imagine).<br/>
<br/>
However. I will discuss it with everyone and see what everybody has <br/>
to say about it.<br/>

&gt; I can only echo Chris&#39;s point here...I had a 17th level druid on <br/>
Tribunal whom<br/>
&gt; I loved dearly, but I haven&#39;t regretted switching servers to join <br/>
Mystic<br/>
&gt; Alliance. I levelled back up with two new characters in no time, <br/>
and the gay<br/>
&gt; friendly atmosphere of MA truly enhances the experience of EQ. <br/>
Perhaps you<br/>
&gt; could consider beginning an alt on Rodcet to try it out? I doubt <br/>
you would<br/>
&gt; regret it!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey Owen,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yay and congratulations for your fight of the good fight.  I <br/>
myself was<br/>
&gt; &gt; recently witness to a barrage of &quot;faggot&quot; comments here on <br/>
Rodcet.  All I<br/>
&gt; &gt; do now is report and petition.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Do however consider coming on over to the Mystic Alliance on <br/>
Rodcet.  I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; wary at first too (having a 15th level Shadowknight, which to me <br/>
then was<br/>
&gt; &gt; the be-all-to-end-all of leveling) because of my hard work, but <br/>
after<br/>
&gt; &gt; switching and joining up, I realized how much fun it can be to <br/>
have a whole<br/>
&gt; &gt; guild of gay and gay friendly people to play with ... plus we <br/>
have guild<br/>
&gt; &gt; events and players which will both help you reach your former <br/>
level in no<br/>
&gt; &gt; time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I completely understand if you still don&#39;t want to switch, but <br/>
trust me, it<br/>
&gt; &gt; could really be worth your time to at least create a character <br/>
over here<br/>
&gt; &gt; and check us out.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks to everyone who responded to my posting. I&#39;m sad to see <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;there are, apparently, so few gay/lesbian players on Brell; or at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;least who are also a member of this eGroup.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;My friends and I *don&#39;t* want to change servers, so we are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;considering starting our own gay/lesbian guild on Brell. The <br/>
problem<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;is, there aren&#39;t enough of us.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I know the process for starting a guild. My qustion is, for <br/>
those of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;you involved in Nameless Love or Mystic Alliance, how did you <br/>
get 10<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;people? Did you advertise in general (such as in a forum) or did <br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;just happen to know 10 other gay/lesbian EQ players, or, well... <br/>
how<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;did it come together.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Considering what I&#39;m finding to be a generally gay-intolerant<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;attitude on EQ, I hesitate to start a forum thread about a new <br/>
gay<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;guild or sit around on the chat server hoping 9 other gay people <br/>
show<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;up who want to start a guild.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m 33. I started RPG-ing in 1980 with D&D and Gamma World. I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;away from RPG&#39;s for many years and even now EQ is my only RPG <br/>
outlet.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I played Magic: The Gathering for a while but it simply became <br/>
too<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;frickin expensive and, to me, pointless. When? When did the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;word &quot;gay&quot; become -- in the gaming crowd (which now seems to be <br/>
made<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;up of teeming hordes of 13 yr old boys with a lot of their <br/>
parents&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;money and No Clue) -- synonymous<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;with &quot;lame&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;useless&quot;, &quot;weak&quot; and just about any and <br/>
every<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;other negative adjective?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I spent 15 minutes in Oasis of Marr the other day riding the <br/>
virtual<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;ass of some lame k3wl d00d because he made the /shout &quot;Somebody <br/>
come<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;kill this gay SG please!&quot; I proceeded to riddle him with <br/>
questions,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;in /shout, such as &quot;How do you know he is gay?&quot; &quot;Does he mince <br/>
when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;he walks?&quot; &quot;Is his name in lavender or pink over his head?&quot; &quot;Is <br/>
his<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;name Bruce?&quot; &quot;Is he listening to the Village People?&quot; Etc., etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;While my very tongue in cheek and often virulent replies ilicited<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;some laughs, several people /shout-ed back stuff like &quot;eww&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;and &quot;that&#39;s gross&quot;. Mainly because initially the player&#39;s <br/>
response to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;me was &quot;Because he&#39;ll rip you a new asshole&quot;. My response to that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;was &quot;Well my boss does that and I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s a breeder&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I was under the impression that tolerance was on the upswing, in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;general anyway. It seems like on EQ that isn&#39;t the case. Is this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;server specific or do any of the rest of you have problems with <br/>
this?<br/>
