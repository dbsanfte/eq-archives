<b>Subject:</b> Anyone have the last charter David modified? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280941789">I remember from previous e-mail that David added some of the RP background<br/>
to the charter before final approval.  Does anyone have a copy of the final<br/>
approved charter?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had a request for a copy from an interested player on Brell. :)  Not a <br/>
member of the list, I could recite the short version (from the chat and posted<br/>
here at beginning of name discission).   Maybe a guild with a tag and charter<br/>
identifying the group will bring more together?<br/>
<br/>
If anyone does can it be posted please?<br/>

<br/>
P.S.<br/>
On the transgendered characters.  My Bard Melodie(female char) was heavily<br/>
flirted <br/>
with by a female char Monk in a recent group.  I *assumed* the female Monk<br/>
was male<br/>
played, but didn&#39;t ask since it really doesn&#39;t matter to me.  First all the<br/>
male <br/>
chars got &quot;very quiet&quot; ... but when I responded without shock (yes I agree<br/>
she does<br/>
look good in leather! hehe), it quickly opened up and the male chars were<br/>
vying for <br/>
flirt lines with the female char.  All light banter ... fun was had by all.<br/>
 So,<br/>
we either had a transgendered char accepted, or Rping of a Bi with<br/>
(Les/Bi)/Straights<br/>
contending for her interest.  The good point is it was relaxed and all<br/>
seemed to <br/>
enjoy it :)  NO ONE asked either myself (or the Monk to my knowlege) what<br/>
sex the player<br/>
was :)  (or what our RL orientation was).  Nice to see.</div>
