<div id="ygrps-yiv-463205327">WOW!<br/>
Glad you came to join us Clayton!<br/>
    You&#39;ll find most of us are a bit strange (gay gamer geeks, what more do<br/>
you need to know?), some of us are rude, obnoxious, pushy and egotistical<br/>
(/em looks around to see all the fingers pointing at him) but most of all,<br/>
we are already a little family!<br/>
    You have one of my dream jobs.  I am a writer myself.  I would love to<br/>
be doing what you are doing!  Part of the fun of this game for me is<br/>
figuring out the story lines and talking to the npcs.  My writing is mostly<br/>
a hobby right now, but I have had minor things published here and there.  I<br/>
hope one day to not be stuck doing this dreadful 8 to 5 job type thing<br/>
really.<br/>
    I am glad there are a few gay people working at/for Verant and are open<br/>
about it.  Sony as a company completely disappoints me continuously, but VI<br/>
seems to be pretty cool.<br/>
    Anyway enough rambling - you should probably join the Rodcet guild list<br/>
by sending a blank email to:<br/>

Subject: [EQ_rainbow] Who&#39;s that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi there,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wanted introduce myself, as I&#39;m new to the guild, though I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; listening in on EQ_rainbow for a really long time.  I just joined a couple<br/>
&gt; of nights ago.  My character is on Rodcet Nife.  His name is Txomin, a<br/>
dark<br/>
&gt; elf enchanter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What brings me to this server and guild now?  Well, I&#39;ve been playing EQ<br/>
&gt; since beta 2, and when final release came around, I burned hard for about<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; year in it.  In that time I moved from Tarew Marr to Tunare, where I<br/>
settled<br/>
&gt; and founded with a couple of friends one of the biggest and strongest<br/>
guilds<br/>
&gt; there, named Talisman.  I put forth a lot of effort in the guild, and as<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; leader I encouraged everyone who had problems--in game or real life--to<br/>
let<br/>
&gt; me know and I&#39;d do everything I could to help.  I looked at my position as<br/>
&gt; the caretaker of every guildmember&#39;s fun; for me I felt I had to ensure<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; everyone was having a good time.  It&#39;s a good way to be, and it made the<br/>
&gt; guild a terrific place.  However, 60+ people all coming to you with their<br/>
&gt; problems daily can be a burden after a while.  Couple that with a really<br/>
&gt; REALLY bad time in my own life and complete burnout was innevitable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, around February of this year, I stopped playing.  I turned over the<br/>
&gt; guild to a really good friend, and it&#39;s still going strong.  For myself, I<br/>
&gt; divorced EQ for about 6 months.  I fixed my ailing real life (a year of<br/>
&gt; unemployed, continuous EverQuest debauchery can set your existence into a<br/>
&gt; tail-spin), got a job and moved to San Diego.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The break presented the perfect opportunity to move to Rodcet Nife and<br/>
&gt; finally do what I&#39;d always wished I could have done, and that is join<br/>
Mystic<br/>
&gt; Alliance.  I couldn&#39;t leave Tunare before, but now I&#39;m free to do it.<br/>
Oddly<br/>
&gt; enough, part of the reason I&#39;m playing again is work related.  I&#39;m a<br/>
content<br/>
&gt; writer for Verant Interactive/Sony Online Entertainment now, so it&#39;s sort<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; part of the job!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, that&#39;s my story and I&#39;m sticking to it.  As I said, I live in San<br/>
&gt; Diego.  I&#39;m not sure if anyone else lives here or not.  One of the unique<br/>
&gt; advantages of my job is, I most likely will be attending some of the<br/>
various<br/>
&gt; EQ Player get-togethers around the country, particularly the one sponsored<br/>
&gt; by Verant.  I believe the next one will be February on the East Coast<br/>
&gt; somewhere (my old stomping ground), and likely I&#39;ll be there.  So who<br/>
knows,<br/>
&gt; I may be in a neighborhood near you in the future :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nice to finally be part of something I&#39;d always wished to join in on.<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
