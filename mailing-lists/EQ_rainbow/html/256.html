<b>Subject:</b> New Racewar Server <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-42722004">Well everyone, the race war server came up and it went down with a hard,<br/>
meaty..bone crushing THUD the other night. I spoke with Tech support about<br/>
it and they said they expected maybe 3000 people at best and NOT 5000 !!<br/>
They arent sure how long the server can handle the load, but they are<br/>
buying NEW servers JUST for racewar! Woo HOO! Guess it was a LOT more<br/>
popular than most thought it would be!<br/>
