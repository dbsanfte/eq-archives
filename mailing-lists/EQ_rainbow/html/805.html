<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057453384">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have a character, Wadkira, on Rodcet Knife and joined the Mystic Alliance <br/>
a while back.  Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t played EQ in a while.  I&#39;ve heard <br/>
much about Role Playing servers and was curious about them.<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons I haven&#39;t played much, is that EQ feels a little to hack <br/>
and slash to me, with the monsters generally tending to have most of the <br/>
fun hacking and slashing (Wadkira dies way too often).  <br/>
<br/>
Online Gaming appealed to me because you&#39;re playing with other people.  <br/>
Let&#39;s face it, if I want to play by myself, I can play Might and Magic.  <br/>
<br/>
How would role playing work in EQ.  I&#39;d be interested in ways to gain <br/>
experience by interacting with other PC&#39;s.  Would guilds be given certain <br/>
Experience Points that they can set up for use in Guild Quests?  Could <br/>
individuals give away a portion of their experience as a trade for an item? <br/>
(Or would that last one just be misused).<br/>
<br/>
With me falling dead every 15 minutes, I don&#39;t really get to advance very <br/>
far and it&#39;s hard to find others to group with at my level (12 I think).  <br/>
And stop telling me to go to Blackburrow.  I *hate* it there.  But if <br/>
interacting with other players, both interpersonally and as part of the <br/>
game, was a larger focus, I might enjoy myself more.</div>
