No Cheating,<br/>
Don&#39;t jump to the answer, just scroll down.<br/>
Take this test mentally, do not write down you<br/>
answers, and do not shout them out.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
1.  Pick a number from 2 to 9.  It can be 2 or it can be <br/>
     9, or any number in between.<br/>
 <br/>
2.  Take that number that you&#39;ve chosen, and multipy it by 9.<br/>
 <br/>
3.  That should give you a two digit number.  Take those two<br/>
     digits and add them together.<br/>
 <br/>
4.  Take the resulting number and subtract 5 from it.<br/>
 <br/>
5.  take that number and correspond it to the alphabet,<br/>
     numbering the letters,  A=1,B=2,C=3, and so on.<br/>
 <br/>
6.  Take your letter, and think of a country that begins with<br/>
     letter.<br/>
 <br/>
7.  Take the last letter in the name of that country,<br/>
     and think of an animal.<br/>
 <br/>
8.  Now, take the last letter in the name of that animal,<br/>
     and think of a color.<br/>
 <br/>
9.  But always remember, that there are no orange<br/>
     kangaroos in Denmark!!!<br/>
