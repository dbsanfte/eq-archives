<div id="ygrps-yiv-947312811">Hey - <br/>
I just wanted to make sure you that you are aware<br/>
once you do the make guild thing - you have to WAIT - <br/>
sometimes up to two weeks (from what I have been told) before <br/>
you will get an email telling you that the guild has been accepted <br/>
and is okay to go ahead - <br/>
at that point - you have to get all 10 people together AGAIN - in <br/>
game and petition - and WAIT for a gm/guide to show up and talk <br/>
to all of you.  <br/>
check out the everquest mainboard -<br/>
<br/>
they really want to make it harder to make guidls for some <br/>
reason..<br/>
