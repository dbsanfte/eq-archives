<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010584611">Hello eveyrone<br/>
<br/>
I was at the guild chat tonight trying to help iron-out the name and purpose<br/>
of our group.  Our offical name right now is The Unity.  But it has come to<br/>
our attention that there is another guild named Unity.  It was suggested<br/>
that we change our name as to be distinct form this group.  Many suggestion<br/>
were thrown about, and I personally tended to by hyper-critical of them<br/>
because I wanted a guild name and charter that would fit role-players as<br/>
well as non-role players, good, neutral, and evil charachters.  It was also<br/>
important to me to be identofied as a group for GLBT people and their<br/>
friends, while still keeping true to the fantasy style of EQ, and the<br/>
Norrathian culture.  This feat was assisted by many poeple in the chat.  So<br/>
many suggestions were made, but I sincerely feel that my following proposal<br/>
fits best with what we all intend.  I hope that we can all join together on<br/>
all serves with this guild name and charter and have some fun.  David, do<br/>
you know how, or if we can cange our nbame now?  I hope so!   Of course i<br/>
want people to make changes and or suggestions to this, and i will leave<br/>
that compliing of that info to David :)<br/>

Guild name:  Force of Synergy<br/>
<br/>
Charter:    Forged by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered people of<br/>
Norrath, and their friends, who saw a fractured society, to form alliances<br/>
of respect, knowledge, and truth, though not necessarily of love, between<br/>
the many peoples of Norrath...this is the Force of Synergy.<br/>
<br/>
Now what?<br/>
