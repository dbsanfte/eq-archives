<div id="ygrps-yiv-976964008">Hey all you nice, imaginative and wonderfully gifted people! I?m just<br/>
throwing in my 2 cents concerning the issues with the guild and Everquests<br/>
GM issues. I?ve read lots and lots of our letters on all of this and<br/>
figured I?d share my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
     Firstly, the Guild idea TOTALLY rocks. Having a guild on each of the<br/>
other servers means we can be ?Messengers of Unity? for the rest of Norrath<br/>
(Not a bad Guild name maybe?maybe not?eh) (shrug).<br/>
<br/>
     Secondly, depending on the turnout tonight at the FIRST NON-official<br/>
meeting of the yet to exist GUILD will help us establish some ideas and<br/>
goals for us all. From what I?ve experienced being in a guild, it offers<br/>
people a chance to learn from those who came before and a chance to buy<br/>
weapons and armor that we are ready to MOVE ON from because we?ve found<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
     A good example of this is my characters on E?ci. Both belong to the<br/>
same Guild, The Chosen, because of this membership and UNITY within the<br/>
guild I have BETTER armor than I could have afforded and better weaponry<br/>
(Jadeeyes has TWO Minotaur Axes and Bealtaine uses a COMBINE Scimitar and<br/>
he?s only 6th level.) Membership has its rewards I must say!<br/>
<br/>
     Thirdly and finally, the reason for having a bereavement day is so<br/>
people don?t have to work when someone they are close to has something<br/>
terrible happen to them. I can?t IMAGINE Everquests company doesn?t HAVE<br/>
this sort of policy. That GM should NOT have been working if that were<br/>
really that case. PLUS?there?s NO reason for us to tolerate that kind of<br/>
behavior. We pay THEIR salaries?plus I wouldn?t want one of my staff coming<br/>
to work after such a terrible thing if they didn?t somewhat have their act<br/>
together. Of course it could also have been a case of POWER happy EQ gm.<br/>
Gee, that could NEVER happen!<br/>
<br/>
Whelp, welcome to Sandy?s SoapBox!<br/>
<br/>
Take care all and remember,<br/>
<br/>
Show Norrath the kind of Superheroes we TRULY are!<br/>
