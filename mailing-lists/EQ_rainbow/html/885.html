<div id="ygrps-yiv-653782262">I highly recommend meeting with the folks of Mystic Alliance.  I <br/>
joined them about 3 weeks ago and have had a wonderful time.  <br/>
<br/>
Wonderful bunch of people and the last guild event I attended was a <br/>
hoot.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone I have had dealings with and interaction with have been <br/>
welcoming and friendly and helpful.  I actually find myself wanting to <br/>
level faster so I can get closer to their levels so I can group with <br/>
them more.  And yes, there are some of us who like bears in MA....and <br/>
some of us who ARE bears  (g)<br/>
<br/>
Ciao!<br/>

&gt; Some of my friends visited the Rodcet Nife server and<br/>
&gt; found the Mystic Alliance, I hope to make it over<br/>
&gt; there this evening. Looking forward to meeting<br/>
&gt; everyone online.<br/>
