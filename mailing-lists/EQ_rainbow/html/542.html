<div id="ygrps-yiv-375381000">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My wedding on Brell Serelis will be at 8:00pm PST on Friday the 12th<br/>
of November (tomorrow).  The wedding will take place on the Sisters of<br/>
Erollisi island.  It will be a fully catered event! All list members are<br/>
welcome.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to get to the island is to take the boat from freeport.  You<br/>
should allot 15 minutes for boat travel.  If you&#39;re coming from Faydwer,<br/>
I recommend you just wait for the boat to start coming back, rather than<br/>
jumping ship and trying to swim.<br/>
<br/>
If you are of an evil race, you can still attend, as festivities will be held<br/>
a safe distance from the good NPCs on the island.  Please don&#39;t kill the<br/>
Erollisi sisters.<br/>
<br/>
