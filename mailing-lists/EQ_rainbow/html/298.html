<div id="ygrps-yiv-349092693">The third paragraph from an article in the Saturday, August 7 &quot;The News &<br/>
Observer&quot; (Raleigh, NC). - must give legal credit on quotes:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For the first time ever, ornithologists, government regulators and<br/>
communications-industry officials will convene at a special workshop in<br/>
Ithica, N.Y. on Aug. 11 to fugure out how bad the whacking problem is and<br/>
how it may be stopped.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
???<br/>
Eh?  Well, no its not about EQ, or even about GBLT, or even about<br/>
government regulators trying to stifle another form of sexual expression.<br/>
;P  Here&#39;s the second paragraph, for those who wondered what in the &lt;bleep&gt;<br/>
the ornithologists were doing there.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Biologists fear that each year millions of U.S. migratory birds become<br/>
disoriented by lights on communications towers and crash - into the towers,<br/>
the ground or even each other -- and die.  The experts call it getting<br/>
whacked&quot;.<br/>
