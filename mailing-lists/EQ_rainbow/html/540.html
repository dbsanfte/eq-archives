Hey DAvid<br/>
<br/>
Well, not to make things more complicated but....the guild on Rodcet Nife<br/>
is called &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; (the right name) not &quot;MysticAL Alliance&quot; the<br/>
wrong name.  so somehow the GM on Rodcet must ahve done things right.<br/>
Does  that mean Rodcet Nife is all set???  I hope so!   BUT if this is a<br/>
major problem we can always delete all the guilds and restart the guild<br/>
and call it Force of Synergy ahahahahhahahaha hehehehe hohoohohoh.  Have<br/>
fun eveyrone and David let me know if we are all set, thanks.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, I have some good and some bad news about the guild.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The good news is that the mystery and problems with getting the guild set<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; on E&#39;ci have finally been resolved. The bad news is we are probably going<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; have to recreate the guild on Brell and Rodcet. Here&#39;s what happened.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once upon a time, we submitted our guild with the revised name &quot;Mystic<br/>
&gt; Alliance&quot;. It was approved and I set it up on Brell Serilis. After setting<br/>
&gt; it up, I noticed that while I had asked for &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; to be set<br/>
up,<br/>
&gt; they made me the guild leader of &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; (not that it is<br/>
&gt; MysticAL not Mystic). I didn&#39;t really worry about it figuring that<br/>
somewhere<br/>
&gt; along the line, the Verant folks had added an extra AL to the name as I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; seen plenty examples of their bad typing in the past.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, then we get a request from players on E&#39;ci to get the guild set up.<br/>
&gt; However, we find out that the Mystical Alliance guild is already set up<br/>
&gt; there. After some investigation by the GM Kyala, during which I ask her if<br/>
&gt; there is a guild on her list called &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; and she assures me<br/>
&gt; there isn&#39;t and that in fact, I am the verified leader of &quot;MysticAL<br/>
&gt; Alliance&quot; she tells me she will delete the &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; and<br/>
recreate<br/>
&gt; it with me as leader.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After two months, I find out that she has not only failed to delete the<br/>
&gt; guild, but is not the GM anymore. (Personally, I think she may have been<br/>
&gt; short-changing Verant on her hours because I could almost never find her<br/>
&gt; when she was supposed to be on. Maybe this led to her being fired -- I can<br/>
&gt; only hope.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The email I sent to Kyala was forwarded to the new GM who, miracle of<br/>
&gt; miracles, actually was online last night when I went to meet her to get<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; guild thing cleared up. It still took an hour, but when she finally got to<br/>
&gt; me, she checked the list and found out that &quot;MysticAL Alliance&quot; was in<br/>
fact<br/>
&gt; assigned not to me but someone else. I then asked if &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; was<br/>
&gt; listed. Initially, she said no but then she checked (I guess) some other<br/>
&gt; list and found that in fact there was a listing for &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot;<br/>
after<br/>
&gt; all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, long story short, the original Brell GM who set us up made a mistake<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; then Kyala compounded it with misinformation, but finally the GM named<br/>
&gt; Sal`Varae one E&#39;ci has fixed it. However, that means that we have the<br/>
wrong<br/>
&gt; guild name on Brell and Rodcet and our web site.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sadly, we just got the Rodcet Nife guild leadership transferred over to<br/>
Joe<br/>
&gt; (Fentus) a half hour before this mystical mystery was solved.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On Brell, I would like to get the guild recreated with the correct Mystic<br/>
&gt; Alliance name. I leave it up to the players on Rodcet to make that<br/>
decision,<br/>
&gt; but I would recommend the same thing there so we don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>
&gt; the &#39;real&#39; guild leader guy of Mystical Alliance coming along and making<br/>
us<br/>
&gt; delete it if he should find out it is a glbt guild.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, I need to make arrangements to get the guild leadership transferred<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; E&#39;ci over to whoever is going to be the leader. Haven&#39;t heard from you<br/>
E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt; guys in awhile, email me directly and let me know when we can meet up in<br/>
&gt; game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As to getting the guild set up on the remaining servers. Apparently, the<br/>
&gt; GM&#39;s are not really checking to see who the guild leaders of record are<br/>
&gt; before they set the guild up. So, if you have volunteered to be the guild<br/>
&gt; leader on another server, go ahead and petition to see if you can get them<br/>
&gt; to guild you. Just make sure you use the name &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot;. Then let<br/>
&gt; everyone on the list know what you&#39;ve done and how they can get into the<br/>
&gt; guild.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; thanks and hugs to all.<br/>
