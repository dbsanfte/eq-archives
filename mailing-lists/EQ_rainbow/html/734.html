&gt;Hi and nice to meet you all!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have just today subscribed to &quot;EQ_Rainbow&quot; on the recomendation of<br/>
&gt;a friend Lora whos been with the list for about a year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Having recently left Luclin server where me and Lora met each other<br/>
&gt;we have started new characters on Terris-Thule. Now we have both<br/>
&gt;played EQ for a long while and have had chars on various other<br/>
&gt;servers prior to Luclin.... yada yada, I&#39;m babbling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyhow, we have only just started fresh on Terris and Lora mentioned<br/>
&gt;that there are people currently moving to Rodcet Nife starting again<br/>
&gt;also. This has me curious and we are considering it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Basically I just wanted the name of the guild there and a contact I<br/>
&gt;could get in touch with to have a chat with about it all. I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;appreciate someone to show us around so to speak.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can be reached on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:swin@...">swin@...</a> if anyone feels the urge<br/>
&gt;to send me some details. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks in advance<br/>
&gt;Hugs and kisses<br/>
&gt;Swin<br/>

&gt; &gt; Not sure if it was mentioned on EQ_Rainbow, but last night we had a<br/>
&gt;big<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mystic Alliance guild event on Rodcet Nife. It was called MegaPlat<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; consisted of a lottery (the grand prize was 665 plat) and raffles<br/>
&gt;of various<br/>
&gt; &gt; items (armor, jewelry, weapons, etc.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We had around 20 guild members on at the same time and that set a<br/>
&gt;record for<br/>
&gt; &gt; us, I believe. A lot of people have been moving over to the Rodcet<br/>
&gt;server<br/>
&gt; &gt; and this event was a great way for them to get some nice equipment.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Joe and Rob did a great job of coordinating and running the event.<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
&gt; &gt; guys.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If anyone else wants to create characters on Rodcet, we invite you<br/>
&gt;to come<br/>
&gt; &gt; join us. We&#39;ll be happy to help you out as you start new<br/>
&gt;characters. We&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; quickly making Rodcet the San Francisco of Norrath and you are<br/>
&gt;welcome to<br/>
&gt; &gt; join the fun.<br/>
