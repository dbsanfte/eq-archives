Norrath is ultimately still a very vague society and culture.  I<br/>
personally prefer to assume that Norrath is a queer positive society, and<br/>
that dumb comment coming from 12 year old boys represent aberations and<br/>
not the rule.  Why help invent a redneck fantasy universe by placing in<br/>
our guild charter that it is so (that we all were ostracized by our home<br/>
societies).  I&#39;ll probably be a wood elf, and I&#39;d like to assume for my<br/>
character that wood elves are queer positive.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand racial hatred is a very definite party of Norrath, with<br/>
certain races being KOS by others etc.  Now I don&#39;t think this is<br/>
analagous to human racism.  I think a guild mandate of racial unity is<br/>
nice from a role playing perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing we could do is claim one of the dieties as a queer diety,<br/>
and say we all follow him or her.  We could invent our own queer diety.<br/>
<br/>
We could also adopt a less political guild affiliation and just happen to<br/>
be mostly queer.  I&#39;m going to assume half the citizens of norrath are<br/>
queer until a census poll shows otherwise 8)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; should also be said here about how people do not ahve to even really love or<br/>
&gt; even like eahc other just respect, that way my high elf wizard can still<br/>
&gt; call our dark elf guild members &quot;smelly&quot;)  maybe we can say:  not all of our<br/>
&gt; members think, act, or smell alike (har har), nor do they always get along,<br/>
&gt; but they always strive for knowledge of the poeples of Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
Lol, yeah that kind of stuff is fun and good for roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   suggestion:   only thing i can think of is that well, mostly we are going<br/>
&gt; to be promoting it so it will be motsly us, but dosnt the above suggested<br/>
&gt; description not even sound like a GLBT guild????  i dont know i&#39;m confused.<br/>
&gt; Its hard to think of a way to balance the fact that we gay peple want a<br/>
&gt; guild, but everyone should be able to be in it, and it should amke some<br/>
&gt; sense to have it in Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
Well ultimately I think that this guild is supposed to be for GLBT<br/>
players, instead of being for GLBT characters.  Now, it&#39;s not a stretch to<br/>
assume that lots of us will be playing GLBT characters, but at least for<br/>
me the biggest opportunity is to game with other GLBT players.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of role playing particulars, we can spend as much time as we want<br/>
working those out.  The guild won&#39;t be online for a week or so (it takes<br/>
that long).<br/>
