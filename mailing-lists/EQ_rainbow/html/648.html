 A few words that describe you:<br/>
    One of the few ( maybe only) non-gay member of Mystic Alliance on Rodcet, <br/>
just now getting back to playing full time, ( job takes me out of town every <br/>
month or so), why would i join a &quot;gay&quot; guild you ask, im very open minded, i <br/>
hate biases toward anyone because of sexual gender, race, religion, <br/>
etc......, and when i first started playing, Damarr was who i looked for <br/>
every morning, before my job messed everything up we were a good team ( <br/>
imho), so it was just natural to join a guild who holds many of the values i <br/>
do, hehe<br/>
