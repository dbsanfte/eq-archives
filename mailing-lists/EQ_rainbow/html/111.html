<div id="ygrps-yiv-520886731">Wednesday is my day off, so I can easily be there at 9:30.  I&#39;m currently<br/>
experimenting with different classes and races, so I don&#39;t quite know who I<br/>
will be playing, but I&#39;m tending towards my gnome warrior, Bambus.<br/>
<br/>
Getting excited about the guild!<br/>

Subject: [EQ_rainbow] Guild Meeting in Chat on Wednesday<br/>

| Okay, I&#39;ll be the guild master.<br/>
|<br/>
| I haven&#39;t heard any negative comments about the name &#39;Unity&#39;, so I think<br/>
that will<br/>
| be the name unless someone else has something better. So, let&#39;s make plans<br/>
for this<br/>
| Wednesday to meet in chat.<br/>
|<br/>
| I will make the channel &#39;Unity&#39; and the password will be &#39;rainbow&#39; in all<br/>
lower case<br/>
| (and case does matter.) If you have any trouble getting into the chat<br/>
room, just<br/>
| contact me directly, my chat name is Lari.<br/>
|<br/>
| Now we need a time to get 10 people all together at once. I am in Eastern<br/>
Daylight<br/>
| Time. I can be on as early as 4:30pm EDT, and as late as 10:30pm EDT. If<br/>
we shoot<br/>
| for early in that window, we can get some of our European members on, but<br/>
will miss<br/>
| the US Pacific time people who may still be at work. Let&#39;s tentatively set<br/>
it for<br/>
| 9:30pm EDT, this Wednesday. Please let me know if you will be able to<br/>
attend the<br/>
| chat at that time. If you cannot, then please tell me a time when you can,<br/>
in case I<br/>
| have to reschedule.<br/>
|<br/>
| We will work first to create the guild on Brell Serilis, and then spread<br/>
it to other<br/>
| servers fairly quickly.<br/>
|<br/>
| I would also suggest we need to describe the guild in OOC and IC terms.<br/>
OOC it will<br/>
| be a guild that is open to tolerant, fair-minded people who are GLBT or<br/>
affirming.<br/>
| But what do we want it to be &#39;in character&#39;. I&#39;d suggest that it certainly<br/>
not<br/>
| discriminate at all based on race or class. Also, do we want to promote<br/>
RPing, or<br/>
| just encourage it, or not bother with it? Or do we just want a guild to<br/>
provide help<br/>
| and friendship to our sister and brother guild mates (such as selling<br/>
banded armor<br/>
| at a steep discount and things like that?)<br/>
|<br/>
| If anyone has any better ideas or plans, please share them.<br/>
