<div id="ygrps-yiv-860480678">i like the idea of advertizing a gblt guild in a publication! that way<br/>
we can have the guild on more than one server like the talons of the<br/>
elite. (and that way i dont have to ditch out on my RL friends on teh<br/>
bristlebane server) i know you say split your time but i already have 8<br/>
characters so i am splitting my time between too many characters as it<br/>
is i couldnt handle haveing them on more than one server!!!! well like i<br/>
said if it is needed i will make a temp character so we can get the<br/>
guild made just let me know<br/>
<br/>
