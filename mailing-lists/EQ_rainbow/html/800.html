<div id="ygrps-yiv-229960157">hello everyone, this is Anthonie talking here, i thought i was going to have more time to play eq for about a week or so (Snapdragyn knows what i am talking about) BUT as it turns out i have to move, as it turns out my roommate (and friend since high school) is planning to move out before october because the rent is going up again, but then he told me that he does not want me to move out with him because i am hurting his &quot;spirituality&quot; sooo, it looks like i am going to have to move back in with my parents :( oh well, they are good people, they just always try to run my life :P so that is why you have not seen me on in a while, i have been preoccupied with my own problems right now, untill i can get back on, see you all later!<br/>
