Whoever you spoke to at Verant cannot possibly know what they are talking<br/>
about. When we got guild approval, after I wrote and then revised a charter, it<br/>
was not based on any specific server. I know that the names of the guilds are<br/>
universal, because otherwise, we could have used the &quot;Unity&quot; name that someone<br/>
else had, unless we were on the same server.<br/>
<br/>
I have emailed verant last night and not received a reply yet. I will let<br/>
everyone know when I do.<br/>
<br/>
If this matter is not resolved the way I think it should be, that will be the<br/>
last straw for me and EQ will be uninstalled and I&#39;ll save $10 per month.</div>
