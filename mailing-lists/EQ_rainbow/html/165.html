By the way, the Shaman is out the door, I think I might try a Wiz.  I want to<br/>
pick Erudite but they have such a bad rep as kill stealers and they are ug in my<br/>
opinion (no it has nothing to do with race), and lord knows I don&#39;t want to be a<br/>
Human.  But my name will prob be Kyte no matter what I pick<br/>

&gt; Hello all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It was great to have 18 of us together on chat last night. Our efforts at a<br/>
&gt; replacement name were humorous if not productive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had an idea for using a latin name for the guild.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Gloriae et Liberatatae<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &#39;Gloriae&#39; means fame, renown, glory; glorius deeds.<br/>
&gt; &#39;et&#39; means and<br/>
&gt; Liberatatae means freedoms, liberty, independence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The initials would be GL (same as the initials for gay and lesbian. Also,<br/>
&gt; the B and the T in liberatatae could represent bisexual and transgender. I<br/>
&gt; just like the idea of having a hidden meaning, but one that we recognize and<br/>
&gt; remember as we think about the diversity of our own group. Kind of like the<br/>
&gt; meaning of each color of the rainbow flag.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The guild&#39;s name would also represent our own desires for personal and guild<br/>
&gt; glory. And the desire we have to be free and to make sure others are free<br/>
&gt; too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other names based in latin:<br/>
&gt; Pedes Genialis<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; pedes - foot soldier<br/>
&gt; genialis - relating to enjoyment; joyful, gay.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pedes Liberti (soldiers of freedom)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know these sound militaristic, but after all, we do carry weapons and kill<br/>
&gt; things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Societas De Sapho - Association Of Sapho<br/>
&gt; Societas De Genialis - Association of Enjoyment (joyful, gay)<br/>
&gt; Societas De Liberti - Association of Freedom<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I kind of like the idea of using something Latin, but at the same time I<br/>
&gt; want something that sounds good. Don&#39;t know if any of the above fit that.<br/>
&gt; What do you all think?????<br/>
