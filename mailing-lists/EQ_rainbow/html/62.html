&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think getting a GUILD started is a GREAT idea...however...some of us are<br/>
&gt;on different servers. We need unification..yes..I looked that word up just<br/>
&gt;for this occasion! Lets start by saying what server we are all currently<br/>
&gt;on, which character we play the MOST and go from there. The ONLY problem I<br/>
&gt;see is that we may have to play our favorite character half time while we<br/>
&gt;play our &#39;GUILD&#39; character the other half. SHAME we cant transfer<br/>
&gt;characters from server to server..sigh. Give me some feedbaack FOLKS! HUGS!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is just me, I know - but I have no issue with playing multiple <br/>
characters across multiple servers.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how I got a necro on one, a magician on the PvP server, etc.<br/>
<br/>
(I have DSL - switching in the course of an evening is not an issue).<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s one vote for a guild on the new server (where newbie characters <br/>
have a better chance in the Big Field of Players...:-)<br/>
<br/>
AND it&#39;s the role-playing server, anyway.<br/>
