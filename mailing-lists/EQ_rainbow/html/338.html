<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550550208">I spent 9 hours straight waiting for jman&#39;s boots to spawn for me.  They<br/>
never did.  Drelzna spawned during that time, she just didn&#39;t have the<br/>
boots.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no anti-camp code there, though.  The place is camped on Tunare 24/7<br/>
and people come away with boots.  A friend of mine went there and got them<br/>
on the first spawn (the wench! ;)<br/>
<br/>
I think I just have horrible luck with spawns like this.  The same thing<br/>
happened for the BBC =P<br/>

&gt; Hey there.. Now I read that they put in Anti-Camping code ingame. I heard<br/>
&gt; people say it wasnt true.. but we decided to go to Najena for the<br/>
&gt; J Boots. I<br/>
&gt; being 17 and my party being on 22-25 I was the outcast, but they are my<br/>
&gt; regular companions, so I knew Id be ok. _I am not one to level<br/>
&gt; efficently so<br/>
&gt; thats why im such a weenie compared to them.. Anyhow.. we get to the place<br/>
&gt; where the J boots spawn and there is a group there.. Said they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been there<br/>
&gt; for 6 hours. So We wait, and 2 spawns no boots, next 2 spawns<br/>
&gt; were not even<br/>
&gt; the named NPC for them,  A necro spawned instead. So After like a hour, I<br/>
&gt; got bored and we left..Decided to get tantacle whip. I have the key so we<br/>
&gt; are going back early today.. but I am thinking for what if its<br/>
&gt; going to take<br/>
&gt; us 3 hours just to get one Journeyman boots ? uugh.. have any of you seen<br/>
&gt; this in specific areas besides here ? Cause I want to Kill Najena<br/>
&gt; to get the<br/>
&gt; FBR, but don&#39;t want (nor have the time) to wait for 6 hours before I get<br/>
&gt; mine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone else have this issue ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
