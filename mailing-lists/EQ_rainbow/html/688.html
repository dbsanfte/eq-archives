<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961670392">Thanks for the review, Tina. Good to hear from you again. Hope you are well.<br/>

As to EQ burnout, been there, done that. I&#39;m very happy now that I&#39;ve come<br/>
back because the guild on Rodcet is so much fun and is really growing. It<br/>
seems like we&#39;ve averaged one new person per day so far this month. Everyone<br/>
is also very helpful, giving stuff to the new people and helping them out.<br/>
