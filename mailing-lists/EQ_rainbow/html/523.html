<div id="ygrps-yiv-697250264">i would love to attend but my character is only 4th lvl or so. so if you<br/>
pick a spot like the throne room then it is definatly out of the<br/>
question, but what ever your choice is of location i wish the two of you<br/>
the best of luck<br/>

&gt; I never thought I would get married in EQ, but I am, and I&#39;m actually<br/>
&gt; really excited.  This is on Brell Serelis with Luna my 50th level<br/>
&gt; enchanter.  She will be marrying Duna, a 45th level monk.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A while ago I posted to the list about Duna, basicly lamenting the fact I<br/>
&gt; had a crush on her and I was sure she was a straight girl.  Well, she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not as straight as I thought.  Since that time we&#39;ve slowly developed an<br/>
&gt; online relationship (another first for me), and I guess the culmination of<br/>
&gt; that relationship is our characters getting married.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This has proved very interesting to me from a queer coming out<br/>
&gt; perspective.  Our characters have been dating for a while now, but they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; both been in the closet so to speak.  I was fairly comfortable with this<br/>
&gt; arrangement, but Duna decided at some point that we should get married.<br/>
&gt; Well, I&#39;d actually already proposed to her, but I didn&#39;t think she&#39;d say<br/>
&gt; yes.  Since then she&#39;s been coming out to people somewhat randomly.  We&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; started /em&#39;ing kissing eachother in public.  So far, no negative<br/>
&gt; reactions.  Most people think we&#39;re joking around I think though.  I<br/>
&gt; really don&#39;t know how things are going to go in the long run.  This all<br/>
&gt; only happened last evening.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Duna is very brave about all this, I think she may also not entirely know<br/>
&gt; what she&#39;s getting into.  She&#39;s quite young (16), and doesn&#39;t seem to have<br/>
&gt; a lot of experience with queer stuff, and accordingly has none of the fear<br/>
&gt; I have associated with coming out.  I think its amazing she wants to do<br/>
&gt; all this, I want to do it too, but I would never have dreamed of<br/>
&gt; suggesting it to her.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The final details of the wedding have not been set.  There has been some<br/>
&gt; talk of having it in the throne room of King Tranix the fire giant, which<br/>
&gt; would limit attendence to those level 40+.  We may have it in a more<br/>
&gt; mundane location.  Regardless, I will let everyone know, and if you can<br/>
&gt; attend I would love you all to attend.<br/>
