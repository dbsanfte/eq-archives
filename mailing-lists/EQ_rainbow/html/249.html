<div id="ygrps-yiv-315015214">My vote would be for Mystic Alliance if we are doing it on this list. As for<br/>
the guild approval, maybe they do that during &quot;regular office hours,&quot; so maybe<br/>
it will be Monday... although sooner would sure be nice!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I&#39;d be willing to assist you, David with whatever you might need help on.<br/>
Let me know!<br/>

I have still not received any notification from Verant on the status of<br/>
our guild. I think they are a bit backlogged because the new system<br/>
allows guilds to be made more easily, so everyone is making one. I&#39;ll<br/>
keep you posted.<br/>
<br/>
As to the name, maybe we should vote on the following two:<br/>
<br/>
Mystic Alliance<br/>
Force of Synergy<br/>
<br/>
At this point, I&#39;d prefer to limit it to those two.<br/>
<br/>
