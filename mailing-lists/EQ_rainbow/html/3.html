&gt; Hi everyone, my name is Christina, and I created EQ_rainbow.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m happy to see that 16 people have joined us in just 24 hours.  It&#39;s<br/>
hard to tell with something like this how quickly and how many <br/>
people will join.  I&#39;m going to use this message to say briefly why I<br/>
created this list, and to tell you a bit about who I am.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well met Christina, my name is Ben (most call me Lonewolf <br/>
online, and sometimes in RL too:). I caught sight of this mailing list <br/>
off of<br/>
EQstratics, a wonderful idea to be sure, I commend you for <br/>
creating such a thing. I didn&#39;t think gay people played EQ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One of the first things I noticed in Everquest was that it prohibited <br/>
 </span></blockquote>anti-gay guilds and harassment.  At the time I just thought &quot;cool&quot;<br/>
and brushed it off, but it kind of sunk in after a while.  It made me <br/>
feel comfortable as a bisexual woman, knowing that (officially at<br/>
least) homophobia was prohibited.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*nods* I actually have had very few social experience when any <br/>
kind of sexual topic was involved. And after hanging out on places <br/>
like<br/>
FurryMUCK (that was a long time ago it seems looking back:) EQ <br/>
seems pretty tame on the adult side, if you don&#39;t count language <br/>
anyway...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; However, in playing the game I noticed also that there was no <br/>
 </span></blockquote>queer visibility.  I have seen a lot of heterosexual visibility, in<br/>
particular I&#39;ve seen a lot of het online marriages.  I&#39;ve thought sometimes about defining one of my characters as a lesbian, but it&#39;s<br/>
seemed like a daunting task.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes honestly it does seem like the default player is the heterosexual stereotype. Honestly I&#39;m more prone to laugh than roll my eyes<br/>
(50/50) when some wanker shouts &quot;man those human/DE/High Elf/Blah blah babes are hot!&quot; ;) And actually that brings up another rant, I seem<br/>
to recall that the lead artist (or one of them) was<br/>
female, yet all the females (especially Tier&#39;Dal) look like scantily clad bimbos! I mean hey I don&#39;t care about nudity etc. but if you<br/>
were out fighting nasties would you just wear a bikini?:) As far as having a gay character, we I never thought about that, honestly I<br/>
would like to see EQ expand into something more than just<br/>
a slashfest which is what it has been lately. I mean the communities here are taking off but right now the mechanics of the game are<br/>
little more than hack and slash. I loved Ultima Online for the world, but left it because of all the horrible &quot;Kewl d00ds&quot; that made the<br/>
place seem like some kind of kindergarten class overrun<br/>
by demonically power misbehaved children. Unfortunately a lot of these children now play EQ, but the difference is they can&#39;t take as near<br/>
advantage of everyone as they did in UO. Honestly I take these <br/>
people too personally, I grew up with Ultima, in my mind they <br/>
ruined UO.<br/>
But hey, no use focusing on the bad:)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; By forming EQ rainbow I&#39;ve hoped to meet other les/bi/gay/tg <br/>
 </span></blockquote>everquest players, outside of the game, in a relaxed chat <br/>
environment.  I&#39;m<br/>
hoping this will help me realize, and all of you realize, that we are <br/>
out there, playing that game, on every server!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would love that, I think we should form our own multi-server guild:) <br/>
I am playing (and I should really focus on one character one of<br/>
these days;) an 8th level Druid named Jerrit on E&#39;ci. I also have a <br/>
6th Monk on Fennin (also named Jerrit, but I havnt played him in a<br/>
while. Jerrit was born as a Werewolf:TA character and<br/>
had such a distinct personality that he became one of those <br/>
characters you play who seems to take on a life of his own:), also <br/>
and 11th<br/>
Paladin named Trus on Fennin Ro as well. Lets seem, then there <br/>
is the 11th Ranger on Solusek Ro named Corwyn, also a 10th <br/>
Teir&#39;Dal<br/>
Necromancer named Sharn on Rallos Zek. I honestly wish I<br/>
had started Sharn elsewhere but I was infinitely curious to see <br/>
what the PvP aspect of this crazy group of EQ people was like. <br/>
Funny thing<br/>
is I&#39;ve met some of the greatest people (along with a few rotten <br/>
ones) on Rallos. Its (since my last visit anyway) been one of the <br/>
most<br/>
well-behaved servers I&#39;ve seen; because if someone<br/>
is an ass they get killed, works out nicely;) I mean granted it isn&#39;t <br/>
always picture perfect, and this faction thing was implemented <br/>
wrong<br/>
as well, but honestly I got sick of looking over my should and felt <br/>
more like adventuring, plus they need to even out the Necros a bit:)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Just to give some biographical information on myself, I&#39;m a 26 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>year old bisexual woman from Toronto Canada.  I work a computer<br/>
programmer.  I do volunteer work here in our amazing queer <br/>
community, and I love it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I&#39;m a 21 year old Gay male, I&#39;m currently in New Jersey <br/>
staying with my mate of about 2 years now. I&#39;m from Maine <br/>
originally and will<br/>
probably be heading up there shortly after I take care of some <br/>
loose ends here. NJ is funny, your not sure how on earth you end <br/>
up in such<br/>
a place and then wonder why you cant seem to<br/>
leave...;) I am currently employed at a book store that is going out <br/>
of business;) Guess I should have got a job at Borders, anyway I <br/>
hope<br/>
to get back into Computer work, I&#39;ve done web design for a few <br/>
years and generally know how to use the horrid things so I figure I <br/>
should<br/>
make money off it:) First and foremost though I<br/>
am a Writer, its what I love to do. Although recently I havnt written <br/>
too much, mabye I&#39;m playing too much EQ...;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope this list will be a positive space for all lesbian/gay/bi/tg <br/>
 </span></blockquote>identified Everquest players.  I also want this list to welcome<br/>
straight-identified and queer-positive Everquest players.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; *hugs*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Christina<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I must say that I am very intrigued by this, I think it is <br/>
wonderful and look forward to how this will shape the game in the <br/>
coming<br/>
future. We&#39;ve always been a bunch of people not only bound <br/>
together by our sexual preference and the discrimination of the rest <br/>
of<br/>
society, but also by our indomitable spirit and ferocious<br/>
zest for life.<br/>
<br/>
Lets shake things up:)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Christina *hug* and to all others I may meet, take care <br/>
and see you online:)<br/>
