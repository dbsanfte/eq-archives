Dear Tech Support:<br/>
<br/>
Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 and noticed that<br/>
the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of<br/>
space and valuable resources.  No mention of this phenomenon was<br/>
included in the product brochure.  In addition, Wife 1.0 installs itself<br/>
into all other programs and launches during system initialization, where<br/>
it monitors all other system activity.  Applications such as Poker night<br/>
10.3, Drunken Boys Night 2.5<br/>
and Saturday Football 5.0 no longer runs, crashing the system whenever<br/>
selected.  I cannot seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while<br/>
attempting to run some of my &gt; other favorite applications.  I am<br/>
thinking about going back to &gt; Girlfriend 7.0, but un-install does not<br/>
work onthis program.<br/>
<br/>
		Can you help me, please!!!<br/>
		Thanks, Joe<br/>

	Dear Joe:<br/>
This is a very common problem men complain about but is mostly due to<br/>
a primary misconception.  Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to<br/>
Wife 1.0 with the idea that Wife 1.0 is merely a &quot;UTILITIES &<br/>
ENTERTAINMENT&quot; program.  Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and designed by<br/>
its creator to run everything.  It is unlikely you would be able to<br/>
purge Wife 1.0 and still convert back to Girlfriend 7.0.  Hidden<br/>
operating files within your system would cause Girlfriend 7.0 to emulate<br/>
Wife 1.0 so nothing is gained.  It is impossible to un-install, delete,<br/>
or purge the program files from the system once installed.  You cannot<br/>
go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is not designed to do this. <br/>
Some have tried to install Girlfriend 8.0 or Wife 2.0 but end up with<br/>
more problems than the original system.  Look in your manual under<br/>
&quot;Warnings-Alimony/Child Support.&quot; I recommend<br/>
you keep Wife 1.0 and just deal with the situation.  Having Wife 1.0<br/>
installed myself, I might also suggest you read the entire section<br/>
regarding General Partnership Faults (GPFs).  You must assume all<br/>
responsibility for faults and problems that might occur, regardless of<br/>
their cause.  The best course of action will be to enter the command<br/>
C:&#92;&gt;APOLOGIZE.  In any case avoid excessive use of the &quot;Esc&quot; key because<br/>
ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before<br/>
the operating system will return to normal.  The system will run<br/>
smoothly as long as you take the blame for &gt; all &gt; the GPFs.  Wife 1.0<br/>
is a great program, but very high maintenance.  Consider buying<br/>
addition software to improve the performance of Wife 1.0.  I recommend<br/>
Flowers 2.1 and Chocolates 5.0.  Do not, under any circumstances,<br/>
install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3.  This is not a supported<br/>
application for Wife &gt; 1.0 and is likely to cause irreversible damage to<br/>
the operating system.<br/>
<br/>
		Best of luck.<br/>
