<div id="ygrps-yiv-661822410">I hope this finds all of you doing well:) Basically I&#39;ll sending this <br/>
down because I maybe starting a new character on Brell. I like my <br/>
Rogue but as of this new patch they still havnt done anything about <br/>
fixing sneak/hide so they work well (like on the Test Server). Yes <br/>
its nice they did something about our Poison skills (they&#39;ll probably <br/>
be royally screwed up at first;) but honestly the class needs help <br/>
and the stealth thing was a step in the right direction. I guess <br/>
someone at Verant must REALLY hate Rogues...<br/>
Sorry, I&#39;m disgruntled;)<br/>
Anyway I was thinking of giving an Enchanter a spin, only class I <br/>
really havnt played besides Magician. And if they ever implement <br/>
enchanting weapons it would definatly be a good skill Guild-wise. <br/>
He&#39;ll probably be a High Elf with a name like Timarius (because of <br/>
my twisted sense of humour;), if your not a Monty Python fan you <br/>
may not get that:) <br/>
Anyway just dropping you all a line, take care:)<br/>
