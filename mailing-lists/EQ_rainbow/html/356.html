&lt;&lt; Hello there,<br/>
 <br/>
 The Robe of the ORACLE  is located on the oracle of Ar&#39;knon who is on a<br/>
 island in OOT. I am no where close to being able to go there, so Ill wait<br/>
 another 6 levels.<br/>
 <br/>
 Barbed Leather Whip is on the Bone Crusher or Goblin Magician in Najena<br/>
 <br/>
 The Bone Bladed Claymore is in Befallen on the 3rd level held by a Shadow<br/>
 Knight<br/>
 <br/>
 Gladius is in &quot;Unrest&quot; on a rare spawn called the Lesser Blade Fiend<br/>
 <br/>
 Polished Granite Tomahawk is in Highhold held by Grenix Muck Tail<br/>
 <br/>
 Crystaline Blade is in Everfrost held by a Goblin Champion<br/>
 <br/>
 Demon claws.. ?? dont know..<br/>
 <br/>
 As far As the jorneyman boots, they give you a temporary SoW. It has<br/>
 unlimited charges, so you can run around all the time like you are SOWed<br/>
 <br/>
 Anything else you need info on ?<br/>
 <br/>
 Thanks<br/>
 <br/>
