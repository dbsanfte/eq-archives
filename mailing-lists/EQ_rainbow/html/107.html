<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098721129">Ok, I have a mage and I am looking to get better armour for him. Right now i<br/>
have a few mesh things, a collar of undead protection and the sr apprentice<br/>
robe (god i am going to be sad to actually have to get rid of this, cause it<br/>
is so cute). I am also a mini tank. I love to go out and pull and live close<br/>
to death on the regular basis. I have a good team, so i almost rarely die.<br/>
But as i do this, i also am going to need a little better protection for<br/>
myself and i feel so limited because i take more damage easily. .. SO can<br/>
anyone have any advice on what to get for my mage and where to get it. The<br/>
Stuff You get from GuK isn&#39;t much..its only benefit is it ways less. i hope<br/>
there is better..  I am level 15 right now and in dire need of help. .. oh<br/>
yeah.. what about the staffs ? like the crystal staff, water and slime staff<br/>
? where are these located .. I am just looking for some advice<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all.<br/>
<br/>
Ps. I am going to try to do the chat server guild thing wed. But my job<br/>
times fluxuate, so i might not get off work in time. i am PST so its going<br/>
to be tough.. but i will do my best for my family..<br/>
