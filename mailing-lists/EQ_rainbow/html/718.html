<b>Subject:</b> Using roger wilco with EQ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083338163">Yeah, the question came up how to get on it. If you don&#39;t have it, <br/>
this is a freeware program that downloads in about 2 minutes, sets up <br/>
in about 5, & then takes a varying amount of time to adjust &  tweak <br/>
to get your sound card to work with it & transmission to go well. It <br/>
allows you to hear & transmit voice messages while running another <br/>
program, including EQ -- basically a voice chat room. Once you have <br/>
it all set up, you just open it before you go into EQ. You&#39;ll want to <br/>
click &#39;join&#39;, & then you want to join this channel: 216.37.33.36. <br/>
After you&#39;ve done that, you just leave roger open & go into EQ like <br/>
normal. We&#39;ve had a few of us going on it for a week or 2 now.<br/>
