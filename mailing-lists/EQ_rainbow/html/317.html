<div id="ygrps-yiv-650596091">Hey there.. Now I read that they put in Anti-Camping code ingame. I heard<br/>
people say it wasnt true.. but we decided to go to Najena for the J Boots. I<br/>
being 17 and my party being on 22-25 I was the outcast, but they are my<br/>
regular companions, so I knew Id be ok. _I am not one to level efficently so<br/>
thats why im such a weenie compared to them.. Anyhow.. we get to the place<br/>
where the J boots spawn and there is a group there.. Said they&#39;ve been there<br/>
for 6 hours. So We wait, and 2 spawns no boots, next 2 spawns were not even<br/>
the named NPC for them,  A necro spawned instead. So After like a hour, I<br/>
got bored and we left..Decided to get tantacle whip. I have the key so we<br/>
are going back early today.. but I am thinking for what if its going to take<br/>
us 3 hours just to get one Journeyman boots ? uugh.. have any of you seen<br/>
this in specific areas besides here ? Cause I want to Kill Najena to get the<br/>
FBR, but don&#39;t want (nor have the time) to wait for 6 hours before I get<br/>
mine.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have this issue ?<br/>
<br/>
