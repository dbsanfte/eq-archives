<div id="ygrps-yiv-474578478">Hey David!<br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear you are back!  I am the guildleader of the Mystic alliance on<br/>
rodcet nife, just mention that you are from the list to any of the<br/>
following poeple to get an invite: Fentus, Genesius, Damarr, Taren,<br/>
Ssauric, Siza, Vesuka.  Thats actually only 4 poeple :)  Our guild has<br/>
grown, i don&#39;t knnow the exact number of poeple but I tihnk approaching 20<br/>
:)  However not all of us play regularly or at the same time :(  BUT, as<br/>
someone who seems to play often at peak hours, I hope to see you on often!<br/>
Additionally I would like you to e-mail me any of the info you have about<br/>
the guil in regards to the guild-leadership on all servers being<br/>
transfered to me (as we had discussed) since I am the guildleader on<br/>
Rodcet and I&#39;d be happy to coordinate guild creation on other servers.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-see you in Norrath!<br/>

&gt; Hello everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After a long hiatus, I have decided to return to the world or Norrath. Since<br/>
&gt; the guild seems to be doing well on Rodcet Nife, and I have to start over<br/>
&gt; from scratch anyway, I figured I&#39;d create a character or two on that server.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are there any people in the guild who have low level characters there that I<br/>
&gt; could group with? If so, what race/class should I play to complement them?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t followed all the various nerfs since I quit, so I don&#39;t know what<br/>
&gt; would be a good class to play anymore. If there is one in particular that I<br/>
&gt; should avoid (have they ever finished the rogues?) please let me know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once I get back online, I&#39;ll publish my character info to the list and I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; certainly give a tell in game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hugs,<br/>
&gt; David<br/>
