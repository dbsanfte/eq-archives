<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814751830">Not sure if it was mentioned on EQ_Rainbow, but last night we had a big<br/>
Mystic Alliance guild event on Rodcet Nife. It was called MegaPlat and<br/>
consisted of a lottery (the grand prize was 665 plat) and raffles of various<br/>
items (armor, jewelry, weapons, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
We had around 20 guild members on at the same time and that set a record for<br/>
us, I believe. A lot of people have been moving over to the Rodcet server<br/>
and this event was a great way for them to get some nice equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Joe and Rob did a great job of coordinating and running the event. Thanks<br/>
guys.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else wants to create characters on Rodcet, we invite you to come<br/>
join us. We&#39;ll be happy to help you out as you start new characters. We&#39;re<br/>
quickly making Rodcet the San Francisco of Norrath and you are welcome to<br/>
join the fun.<br/>
