<b>Subject:</b> Buffs and not to buff... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-782515142">I&#39;ve a question....<br/>
     If you are PVP on NON PVP channels you cannot buff nor be buffed by<br/>
someone. I noticed that on the PVP channel everyone has the RED name, thus<br/>
meaning PvP. CAN you buff someone? I know you may have to group with<br/>
someone to do certain buffs, but Spirit of Wolf and such...do they work?<br/>
CAN you buff just like on the other channels as if you weren&#39;t PVP ???<br/>
     If anyone knows, please mail me a clue!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks family!<br/>
