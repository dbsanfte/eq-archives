<div id="ygrps-yiv-350506056">Yeah, I also SERIOUSLY doubt they would cut off Halas. That would cut off barbarians from training or reaching any of the needed things in their home city! Also, I doubt that they even have the model for Lady Vox built into the Everfrost zone, and therfore couldnt be roaming around heh. I guess they could update it maybe? I dont really know enought about that stuff to say though heh. They&#39;re prolly just gonna replace the goblins with some other beasts or different faction of goblins and make the loot better in there. And to trash Qeynos sure would be kewl, who goes there anyway? hehe. That&#39;ld be another hug patch if they could do that also. Also seriously doubt they would trash all those starting cities. Qeynos makes sense because there is already one human starting city, and two if you kinda include Surefall Glade.<br/>
