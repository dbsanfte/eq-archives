<div id="ygrps-yiv-128515166">Hello! With the new server and possible gatherings I thought I&#39;d <br/>
introduce.<br/>
<br/>
About the only thing that may take more guts than admitting your gay on<br/>
a straight list is admitting your straight on a gay list.  I am a straight,<br/>
however, (no I&#39;m not about to say &quot;but I have a gay friend&quot; pppt!) ... I was<br/>
raised by two gay males after my father died when I was quite young.<br/>
Actually,<br/>
since he was bedridden when I was a toddler, they had stepped into that role<br/>
starting when I was 2-3 years old.  There were two other couples who also<br/>
helped, known as four more &quot;Uncles&quot; to me.  So they were my functional father<br/>
figures as long as I can rememeber, also called &quot;Uncles&quot;.  I followed in the<br/>
professional footsteps of one (and he helped put me through college), and my <br/>
main hobby follows the heart and profession of the other.  So &quot;I was raised<br/>
by gays, but I&#39;m straight&quot; *is* an uncomfortable thing to say in the straight <br/>
community.  Why do they peer at you and go &quot;Are you sure?&quot;? (grrr)<br/>
Fortunately <br/>
most aquaintences never questioned why I had eight &quot;Uncles&quot;, and only two<br/>
were <br/>
related (my mother does have two brothers). :) Anyway, that&#39;s why I joined<br/>
the <br/>
list.  Its as much &quot;home&quot; for me as any other group mailing list.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got characters on Erollisi & just strarted on Brell.  I&#39;ve RPed a bit and<br/>
my characters are often different and some are a bit goofy, some are<br/>
goody-two-<br/>
shoes, some are dark and evil (cackles!).  If I&#39;m not &quot;egged&quot; or &quot;rotten<br/>
tomatoed&quot;, <br/>
I&#39;ll put up the list .. I&#39;d love to find others to group with.<br/>
<br/>
