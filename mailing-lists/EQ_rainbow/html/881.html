<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380174337">I just wanted to add two comments about all this new interest we seem <br/>
to be getting:<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad that gay guilds on EQ are attracting new members. Sam <br/>
stopped by Lanys last night, and we had a blast with him. I encourage <br/>
everyone to get involved in the guilds on other servers, if not to <br/>
play hardcore, necessarily, but just to meet the nice people on <br/>
Rodcet and Nameless AND Lanys. Alex (Rugen) and I had a blast on <br/>
Nameless helping Souldreamer get their guild underway, and, as a <br/>
result, I&#39;m encouraging the Ordo to visit the other servers so we all <br/>
get to know each other a bit more.<br/>
<br/>
The even-handed way that the other guilds have treated new EQ&#39;ers is <br/>
to be commended - it&#39;s nice to see that we three guilds (and more are <br/>
out there, from what I&#39;ve heard) don&#39;t feel the need to compete for <br/>
newbies, rather we can help new folks find a place they will feel <br/>
comfortable in a fun game. My hats off to Mystic and Nameless Love!<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to let everyone know that Ordo has a website at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ordo.darke.net">http://ordo.darke.net</a> with ezBoards open to the public for posting.<br/>
<br/>
All the best!<br/>
