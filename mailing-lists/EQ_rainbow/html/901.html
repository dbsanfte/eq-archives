<div id="ygrps-yiv-253614437">Fine, so we all e-mail ebay and ask them to ban the sale of these items, and the moral majority asks them to ban any gay literature.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll forgive me, but, I may not care for nazi literature, but I don&#39;t support banning its distribution.<br/>

Hi,<br/>
I got this email today.<br/>
This is very serious and if you feel the same way you should respond to it<br/>
as well.<br/>
As someone who comes from a large Jewish family, I personally find this just<br/>
utterly and horribly appalling.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi guys,<br/>
&gt;   It just recently came to my attention that e-bay IS in fact selling<br/>
&gt; thousands of Nazi memorabilia online. At first I thought it was just a<br/>
joke<br/>
&gt; e-mail. But I checked it out, and lo and behold... there are literally<br/>
&gt; THOUSANDS of items for sale... and being bought. It&#39;s a funny thing<br/>
because<br/>
&gt; I have also learned that the recent killings at schools have ALL turned up<br/>
&gt; Nazi memorabilia... such as Colombine, the two murdered professors, and<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; recent ones in Maryland.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Check it out for yourself:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://listings.ebay.com/aw/listings/list/category4078/index.html">http://listings.ebay.com/aw/listings/list/category4078/index.html</a> Just<br/>
&gt; search for the word nazi and you&#39;ll find it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As a TransFan, I AM DISGUSTED and I AM APALLED! And as a human being, I<br/>
feel<br/>
&gt; it is just plain wrong to use this service to buy TOYS without knowing<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; was going on. I urge you all, if you feel strongly about this to voice<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; opinion to e-bay. They have a moral responsibility not to promote hate as<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; well respected company.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can e-mail e-bay&#39;s CEO here:<br/>
&gt; Meg Whitman<br/>
&gt; Email: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:meg@...">meg@...</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And the VP of Communications here:<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; What else can be said? That&#39;s up to you!<br/>
&gt; Thank you,<br/>
&gt; Daniel Ross<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S.  Below is the original letter that I received which alerted me to<br/>
this.<br/>
&gt;   I urge you all to read this as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dear Friends<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I got this from a close friend of mine:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I recently went on eBay and discovered that they have over 75 pages of<br/>
Nazi<br/>
&gt; memorabilia for sale!!! Each page contains approximately 40 separate<br/>
&gt; auctions. That&#39;s over 3700 auctions of Nazi items right now!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Upon looking at these in disgust, I even noticed some people proudly<br/>
&gt; declaring that their Nazi items are banned in Germany and France, but<br/>
&gt; available here on EBAY!!!! Items include: Nazi flags, Pictures of<br/>
&gt; Stormtroopers and countless other despicable items. I decided that we<br/>
&gt; should not let eBay profit from the blood of 6 million  Jews!!!! I<br/>
&gt; contacted eBay and after getting the runaround, spoke to the  Director of<br/>
&gt; Communications for about 1 hour. I told him that I understand that<br/>
&gt; legally eBay has the right to sell Nazi memorabilia but morally they ought<br/>
&gt; to be ashamed of themselves that they are profited from the death of 6<br/>
&gt; million Jews!! I also reminded him that many people who collect Nazi<br/>
items,<br/>
&gt; idealize Hitler and what he has done and have been involved in violent<br/>
&gt; crimes in our society.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I explained to him that the 2 students that murdered fellow classmates<br/>
&gt; at Columbine had Nazi items in their homes. More recently the 2 teens that<br/>
&gt; murdered the two Dartmouth professors, were found to have Nazi items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; His response was that of a typical spin doctor. He said that these<br/>
&gt; items are sold elsewhere and at shows. I told him that is a very poor<br/>
&gt; justification for eBay to promote items of violence and hate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To net this out....I need your help in putting tremendous pressure on<br/>
&gt; eBay to stop selling Nazi memorabilia!!! I am convinced that if enough<br/>
&gt; people are vocal about this and the pressure is kept on eBay to do the<br/>
&gt; right moral thing.....that we can have these horrific items removed from<br/>
&gt; eBay forever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The person I spoke with is:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Kevin Perclad<br/>
&gt;    VP of Communications<br/>
&gt;    Phone: 408-558-7458<br/>
&gt;    Email: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kevinp@...">kevinp@...</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    The CEO is:<br/>
&gt;    Meg Whitman<br/>
&gt;    Email: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:meg@...">meg@...</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I ask your help in passing this note to all of your friends,local temples<br/>
&gt; and Jewish organizations. Encourage everyone to contact eBay and tell them<br/>
&gt; that it is unacceptable for them to profit off of the blood of Jews and<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; all Nazi memorbilia must be removed from eBay now!!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you very much!!!&quot;<br/>
