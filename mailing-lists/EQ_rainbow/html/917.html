<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300762358">Hello all.  I&#39;m new to the group and relatively new to the EQ world <br/>
as well.  I&#39;m not new to being gay (haha).  I have looked at some of <br/>
the previous post and have been amazed that there are others like me <br/>
out there (That sounds just like I did when I first discovered that <br/>
there were other boys and girls in the world just like me).  Sorry I <br/>
didn&#39;t mean to sound so clicheist (is that really a word?)  Anyway I <br/>
have had a couple of run ins with other players who figured out that <br/>
I was gay, I honestly don&#39;t know how.  And the experience was not <br/>
nice at all.  But hey that&#39;s the way of the world be it Norath or  <br/>
Real Life.  I play on Brell and would love to meet others and group <br/>
with them if its possible, please write and lets go out and kill <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
