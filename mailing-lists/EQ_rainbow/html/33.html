<b>Subject:</b> Racewards server? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154966887">So what does everyone think about the upcoming race wars server?<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like it&#39;s going to be a bit of a bloodbath.  Everything<br/>
I&#39;ve heard from the test server is about massive slaughter.  I think<br/>
people see the race wars as a big excuse to PvP for the fun of PvP.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking originally I wouldn&#39;t play for that reason, but now I think<br/>
I might try it out...but not seriously.  I don&#39;t want to have to worry<br/>
about my character being killed all the time.  If I play I&#39;ll just accept<br/>
that that will probably happen a lot.<br/>
