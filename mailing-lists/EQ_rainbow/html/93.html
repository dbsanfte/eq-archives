<div id="ygrps-yiv-708800754">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the delay in response, but I was out camping for a few days (it&#39;s<br/>
nice to get away from EQ once in a while). I think the idea for a guild is an<br/>
interesting idea but one mainly for people who like to role play which really<br/>
doesn&#39;t include me. I also am not keen on the idea of starting up yet another<br/>
character since my &quot;primary&quot; one has finally reached the upper teens and with<br/>
it some decent power. I do however wish you all luck and best wishes with<br/>
starting up new characters and the guild but don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to join.<br/>
I will however offer hospitality and help to any of you who happen to be on<br/>
the server I play (with many friends, another reason I&#39;m not in a rush to jump<br/>
servers) Innoruuk. Should any of you ever pop on there feel free to send a<br/>
hello.<br/>
