&gt;<br/>
&gt; A chilly evening in the West Commons (on Rodcet Nife server)<br/>
&gt; ----------------------------<br/>
&gt;     Kerik the Wood Elf Druid worked hastily to set up the tent. Eizen<br/>
&gt; appeared about ready to nod off at any moment. As had become their<br/>
&gt; usual habit, Kerik ported his cleric friend to the commons and the<br/>
&gt; two<br/>
&gt; men spent the night next to the druid ring, wrapped in each others<br/>
&gt; arms. Kerik struggled and fumbled with the tent. Nerves! he thought.<br/>
&gt; Must relax. He took a deep, calming breath.<br/>
&gt;     It had been a busy night. He&#39;d been helping Gotham in her quest<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; kill asps when news reached him that Adessa had been seen dancing<br/>
&gt; naked around Eizen. There was even a rumor they had made love. Kerik<br/>
&gt; was so angry he couldn&#39;t see straight. His first inclination had been<br/>
&gt; to leave Eizen. But his heart wouldn&#39;t let him. He needed Eizen. He<br/>
&gt; just hadn&#39;t been able to take that next step.<br/>
&gt;     His brother, Jono, had almost convinced him to go ahead and ask<br/>
&gt; for Eizen&#39;s hand. But Jono had left Faydwer at an early age and<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; aware of the class system -- wasn&#39;t aware of how the high elves<br/>
&gt; looked<br/>
&gt; down upon their woodland kin. To Jono, it was just a matter of<br/>
&gt; following one&#39;s heart. But to Kerik, it was more complicated. What<br/>
&gt; would Eizen&#39;s parents think? Wouldn&#39;t they abandon their son for<br/>
&gt; marrying a dirty wood elf? Did he really want to put Eizen in a<br/>
&gt; position to choose between him and his entire culture? And then there<br/>
&gt; was the fear of outright rejection. What is Eizen just didn&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; marry him? Maybe he should just maintain the status quo, he had<br/>
&gt; thought.<br/>
&gt;     Then Adessa came along. Kerik knew he had to act now or never.<br/>
&gt; After getting over his anger, he quickly began trying to find a ring.<br/>
&gt; After a long wait on what must have been the slowest Paladin in all<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; Norrath, Kerik was able to purchase a ring.<br/>
&gt;     Now, if he could just get the tent set up. There. It was done.<br/>
&gt; And<br/>
&gt; Eizen was in it already and about to nod off. &quot;Wait...&quot; Kerik<br/>
&gt; implored. He had rehearsed this moment in his head so many times. He<br/>
&gt; would kneel. Then hand Eizen the ring and ask him to marry him. But<br/>
&gt; Eizen&#39;s sleepy eyes and Kerik&#39;s nervousness ruined his well rehearsed<br/>
&gt; plan.<br/>
&gt;     Instead, he quickly dug around his pocket for the ring. It was<br/>
&gt; gone! Where could it be? Then he remembered... he was wearing the<br/>
&gt; Forman&#39;s Tunic Eizen had just given him and the ring was in his old<br/>
&gt; Lockjaw vest. He grabbed the ring and stretched out his shaking hand<br/>
&gt; to Eizen without saying a word. Eizen looked at the ring and saw it<br/>
&gt; was an engagement ring. Kerik looked into Eizen&#39;s eyes for some kind<br/>
&gt; of sign as to whether he was going to accept it or not. After what<br/>
&gt; seemed like forever, Eizen smiled as he took the ring and placed it<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; his finger.<br/>
&gt;     &quot;You took it,&quot; Kerik said surprised more than anything but filled<br/>
&gt; with joy too, as tears welled up in his eyes.<br/>
&gt;     Eizen smiled back at him. &quot;Weren&#39;t you supposed to kneel down on<br/>
&gt; one knee?&quot;<br/>
&gt;     Kerik shrugged and stared at the ground in embarrassment. &quot;I was<br/>
&gt; too nervous and thought you were about to fall asleep.&quot;<br/>
&gt;     Eizen wiped the tears from Kerik&#39;s eyes and they held each other<br/>
&gt; for the longest time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ===============================<br/>
&gt; Eizen, High Elven Cleric of the 35th season and Kerik Rainbow, Wood<br/>
&gt; Elf Druid of the 31st season announce their engagement to be married<br/>
&gt; at a time and place to be determined. The entire Mystic Alliance<br/>
&gt; guild<br/>
&gt; and all other interested parties will be invited to attend the<br/>
&gt; ceremony and reception. There will be plenty of food and drink for<br/>
&gt; all. (Hope to have some actual wedding cake now that the recipe has<br/>
&gt; been discovered.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The grooms are registered at Leather and Hide, Jade&#39;s Jewelry shop<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; other fine stores in Freeport and surrounding areas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; /ooc Everyone from the EQ Rainbow list will be invited to join us on<br/>
&gt; the Rodcet Nife server for the big event. Once we have determined a<br/>
&gt; location, if you don&#39;t have a character on the server, you can create<br/>
&gt; one in the closest starting city. We are looking for a location that<br/>
&gt; will not be KOS to anyone and we should have plenty of people<br/>
&gt; available to provide ports as well. If you&#39;ve been thinking about<br/>
&gt; coming over and visiting us in the largest gay/gay friendly guild in<br/>
&gt; Norrath, this will be a great to chance to meet everyone. The event<br/>
&gt; will take place some time after the 6th of October as I (Kerik) will<br/>
&gt; be out of town.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hugs,<br/>
