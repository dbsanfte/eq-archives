 Dear Tech Support:<br/>
 <br/>
 Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 and noticed that<br/>
 the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of<br/>
 space and valuable resources.  No mention of this phenomenon was<br/>
 included in the product brochure.  In addition, Wife 1.0 installs itself<br/>
 into all other programs and launches during system initialization, where<br/>
 it monitors all other system activity.  Applications such as Poker night<br/>
 10.3, Drunken Boys Night 2.5<br/>
 and Saturday Football 5.0 no longer runs, crashing the system whenever<br/>
 selected.  I cannot seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while<br/>
 attempting to run some of my &gt; other favorite applications.  I am<br/>
 thinking about going back to &gt; Girlfriend 7.0, but un-install does not<br/>
 work onthis program.<br/>
 <br/>
        Can you help me, please!!!<br/>
        Thanks, Joe<br/>
