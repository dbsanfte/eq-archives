be purchased from anyone else. The only way to get them is to camp there.<br/>

&gt;  I often wonder if it isn&#39;t simply easier to hunt non-camped (or <br/>
&gt;  lesser-camped) spawns and earn enough coin to buy the goodie I want from a <br/>
&gt;  player that has one for sale...<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Not only that, but I get to earn a lot of experience as I hunt another <br/>
&gt;  critter while waiting for one to respawn.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Just a thought...<br/>
