<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122519520">Hey, all. I just joined MA on Rodcet yesterday (as Snapdragyn), & <br/>
wanted to say hello & thanks for the friendly welcome. I was upset <br/>
when I found out MA has (apparently) gone defunct on Brell -- I&#39;d <br/>
moved there specifically to join after 1st starting on Erollisi (only <br/>
got to 3rd or so there). I had 2 chars on Brell, both at 6th, & had <br/>
worked up a good storyline to RP for them (twins, estranged from the <br/>
family, 1 thought the other was dead -- oh, the drama, the drama). <br/>
So, finding out that I had to drop them if I wanted to move to Rodcet <br/>
& join MA was NOT pleasant news.<br/>
<br/>
  Well, let me say to anyone who&#39;s debating the same situation -- <br/>
IT&#39;S WORTH IT! I&#39;ve done an EQ marathon this weekend to get Snap (do <br/>
prefer that to &#39;Snappy&#39;, BTW) up to 5th, & I&#39;ve had a lot of fun -- <br/>
whether just watching & joining the guildchat while bashing waspies, <br/>
or grouping with Thundyr (a guildmate I met in G&#39;Fay who&#39;s the same <br/>
level). I&#39;m already looking forward to starting a rogue on Rodcet & <br/>
getting him in the guild, too.<br/>
<br/>
  Okay, the basic info:<br/>
<br/>
Name: Todd Morris<br/>
Location: San Francisco -- Mecca!<br/>
Age: *cough* Almost 30 *cough* (34 -- &#39;almost&#39; from the other side)<br/>
Single<br/>
Main chars: Er, not sure now. Were Trylain & Trylorn, the twins -- <br/>
Wizard of the Sixth Circle/Rogue of the Sixth Shadow on Brell. <br/>
Already leaning towards Snapdragyn (Bard of the Fifth Song), but <br/>
we&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
  Er, forgot the rest of the stuff from that intro form (oops), but <br/>
there&#39;s a little. Look forward to seeing you all ingame!</div>
