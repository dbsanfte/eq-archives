<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631093416">I came out to an EQ friend last night, and it went really well.  It<br/>
turned into one of those &quot;why didn&#39;t I tell her long ago&quot; thingies.  She&#39;s<br/>
16 and I thought she might not be mature enough to handle it, but she took<br/>
it really well and easily.  In particular, she&#39;s a very affectionate<br/>
person online, and she is still affectionate towards me (I was worried she<br/>
might withdraw).  She also sent me an email after she logged off that<br/>
night where she said all the right friend things.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that I thought was kind of weird was after I told her<br/>
she said &quot;oh, everything makes a lot more sense now&quot;.  I was kind of<br/>
surprised about that, I still don&#39;t know what she means.  I think she<br/>
might have been refering to the fact that I had already told her I was<br/>
polyamorous (which had confused her a fair bit).  Perhaps she found it<br/>
easier to perceive a bi-woman as poly than a straight one? There certainly<br/>
are enough stereotypes (I hate beind a stereotype dammit, it makes me want<br/>
to go monogomus! =)<br/>
<br/>
She actually asked me to marry her right after I came out to her.  I think<br/>
it was her way of showing me immediate support.  I was a little blown<br/>
away, but I turned her down.  Both her and I are fairly well known on<br/>
Brell Serelis and my instincts said that the only way we could pull it off<br/>
without harassment would be to play up on it as kind of a joke.  Since<br/>
that isn&#39;t the way I&#39;d want to approach an online queer wedding, and since<br/>
I don&#39;t want her or me to get treated badly, I decided against it.<br/>
<br/>
Things are a little further confused by the fact that I have an<br/>
itsy-bitsy crush on her. She&#39;s just too lovable *sigh*.  I think I see her<br/>
as someone I would have loved to date when I was in highschool.  Whenever<br/>
she gives me hugs or cuddles I feel all fuzzy and happy.<br/>
<br/>
I am 99% sure she&#39;s straight though (and she&#39;s a little too young for me<br/>
even if she wasn&#39;t).  Luckily I have *lots* of experience having crushes<br/>
on my straight female friends =) So, I&#39;m pretty sure I can handle this.<br/>
