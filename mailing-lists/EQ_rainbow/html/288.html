Go to Eqphotos.eqrealms.com and you too could be posted on there for all to see. I am currently on there under the Xegony server. I encourage everyone to post their pics cause it&#39;s just SO interesting. ?:o) Anywho...I&#39;m on Xegony and am still wanting to get hooked up with this guild, but I haven&#39;t been contacted yet or anyting. :o( Find me on there as Virile, and also my friend on there Xenic.
