<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-845655222">hhhmm.. out of curiosity have any of you been in a guild war.. because since<br/>
we are in the right on this one.. and if Varant lets us get our name on that<br/>
server.. im thinking that there is a whole group of peeps that will take a<br/>
vendetta against the guild. I don&#39;t know.. just out of curiosity asking...<br/>
because I know that there is plenty of people that play on multiple<br/>
servers..</div>
