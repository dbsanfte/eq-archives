Please contact him to get yourself &#39;guilded&#39; on that server.<br/>
<br/>
(Rob, can I add this to our website? Let me know. Thanks)<br/>
<br/>
As we get other servers set up, I will let everyone know. Thanks to all who<br/>
have helped and thanks for your patience.<br/>
<br/>
I am still awaiting word from the GM on E&#39;ci as to whether she has been able<br/>
to get the &#39;hijacked&#39; version of our guild deleted.<br/>
<br/>
As we get guilds set up and people made into guild leaders and officers, I<br/>
think it would be a good idea if every guild leader kept a list of all<br/>
members and their contact information (i.e. email address). I dont&#39; want to<br/>
turn this into a record keeping nightmare, but I think that we at least<br/>
should have this much information on file. Does this sound reasonable to<br/>
everyone?<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
