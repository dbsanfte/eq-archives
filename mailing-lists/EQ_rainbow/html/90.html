Perhaps we should also all try and congregate to a single server as well,<br/>
although PvP teams may not be something you want.  As in respect for a<br/>
guild, what should it be called?  I do not think a name like GLBC should be<br/>
used.  It should be something that maybe gay people might pick up on, but<br/>
nothing to obvious and fantasy based.  As a suggestion, I think maybe a<br/>
name like the Rainbow warriors might be good although some of you may think<br/>
its obvious.  Beleive it or not, most hetros do not know the significance<br/>
of the the rainbow yet.  Or maybe some ancient word meaning same sex or<br/>
something like that.<br/>
