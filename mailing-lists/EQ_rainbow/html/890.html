<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724333212">Howdy.  Glad you found the gay EQ email list.  There are a few gay guilds on<br/>
different servers.  We have a rather large and growing gay guild on the<br/>
Rodcet Nife server.  If you would like to join us just make a character on RN<br/>
and give a tell to someone in the guild to ask an officer to get you an<br/>
invite.  I&#39;ll be doing a little PLing this weekend so if you decide to join<br/>
us you may get a little boost to start off with  =)  We also have a mailing<br/>
list on yahoo groups and a website at www.mysticalliance.com<br/>
