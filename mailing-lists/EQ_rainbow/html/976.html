<b>Subject:</b> Re: Nameless Love-Stonewall Pride UPDATE <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-966450865">Hello:<br/>
Was playing last nite and someone mentioned that there were actual <br/>
Nameless Love guildies on... *shock*.<br/>
hehe.<br/>
I was in on the start of NL.. but most of the regular players merged <br/>
into The Nameless of Mercy, our sister guild, as they leveled up into <br/>
their 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s (and beyond)... including myself.  I split my <br/>
time between Steib (41 druid) and Bliste (44 ranger), so please give <br/>
me a tell sometime if you need anything.. ports or whatnot :)<br/>
I also have a couple lower lvl alts I&#39;ve been playing more and would <br/>
love it if perhaps one or two of them would be allowed to join your <br/>
fold (a 13 DE cleric.. 12 woody warrior.. 5 HE chanter).<br/>
Anyways.. glad to see this happening :)<br/>
/salute<br/>
<br/>
See u in game :)<br/>

&gt; Hi folks:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A month ago I posted a message here about the new <br/>
&gt; gay/lesbian/bi/trans guild on The Nameless server which was then <br/>
&gt; called &quot;Stonewall Pride.&quot;  After some deliberation (and some wierd <br/>
&gt; nerfing which happened to our guild after the last patch) we <br/>
decided <br/>
&gt; to abandon Stonewall Pride and move everyone into the previously <br/>
&gt; existing gay/lesbian guild called Nameless Love.  This was at the <br/>
&gt; kind invitation of Tsinen, the head of Nameless Love.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thus gay/lesbian EverQuest people on The Nameless server may wish <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; join us in the Nameless Love guild to enjoy a safe and friendly <br/>
&gt; gay/lesbian environment.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many of the new Nameless Love members are players of a lower level <br/>
&gt; since we have all only recently moved to The Nameless server from <br/>
&gt; other servers.  We love to group and hang out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We welcome all gay/lesbian/bi/trans EQers and hope to see you soon!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dandee Lyon, druid<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ps. Many thanks to Nameless Love for inviting us into their fold. </span></blockquote></div>
