<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077636633">I might come over there, but I doubt it. I think EQ is over for me. I just <br/>
left the game giving my account to a good friend in my guild. It was one of <br/>
the hardest things I&#39;ve ever done hehehe I was a lvl 52 necro with over 100 <br/>
days played time and a prominent member of the #1 guild on the Saryrn server <br/>
heh. Dunno if I want to get that addicted to eq again it was bad heh..<br/>

&gt;Subject: [EQ_rainbow] Fun on Rodcet Nife<br/>

&gt;Not sure if it was mentioned on EQ_Rainbow, but last night we had a big<br/>
&gt;Mystic Alliance guild event on Rodcet Nife. It was called MegaPlat and<br/>
&gt;consisted of a lottery (the grand prize was 665 plat) and raffles of <br/>
&gt;various<br/>
&gt;items (armor, jewelry, weapons, etc.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We had around 20 guild members on at the same time and that set a record <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;us, I believe. A lot of people have been moving over to the Rodcet server<br/>
&gt;and this event was a great way for them to get some nice equipment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Joe and Rob did a great job of coordinating and running the event. Thanks<br/>
&gt;guys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If anyone else wants to create characters on Rodcet, we invite you to come<br/>
&gt;join us. We&#39;ll be happy to help you out as you start new characters. We&#39;re<br/>
&gt;quickly making Rodcet the San Francisco of Norrath and you are welcome to<br/>
&gt;join the fun.<br/>
