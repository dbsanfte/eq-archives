<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398649434">Sorry we missed you when you visited us on The Nameless.  There are <br/>
quite a few of us there so it&#39;s a pity we failed to hook up.<br/>
<br/>
The guild has not folded.  Oh no!  In fact, it has not officially <br/>
made it out of the starting gate yet.  We&#39;re still trying to get 10 <br/>
people on at the same time in the same zone (it&#39;s like herding <br/>
cats!) - we came very close last week but this week we will succeed!  <br/>
<br/>
On Monday June 18th between 6 and 7pm Pacific Time we will be in <br/>
Butcherblock outside Kaladim where WOLFVEN, our Fearless Guild <br/>
Leader, will invite us into the guild and do all the official guild <br/>
set-up stuff with an EQ GM.  Anyone who wants to help out could just <br/>
create a dwarf character on The Nameless that evening and come to the <br/>
gates at Kaladim.  That will ensure that we get the right number of <br/>
people to get going.  We will be most appreciative and you&#39;ll have <br/>
helped create a new gay guild. Yay!<br/>
<br/>
Our guild will be based on welcoming gay people to a safe, friendly, <br/>
and fun place to play EverQuest.<br/>
<br/>
All of us have characters on other servers and we&#39;re all conflicted <br/>
about leaving behind high levels characters, plat and goodies but <br/>
from our experiences grouping together so far on The Nameless I&#39;d <br/>
have to say it has been totally worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see all of y&#39;all this Monday.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re on The Nameless send a tell to just say hi to me at:<br/>
<br/>
Dandee Lyon (wood elf druid)<br/>
Darshe Blows (half elf rogue)<br/>
Poppie Power (gnome wizzie)<br/>
<br/>
Best to all,<br/>
<br/>
Dandee, Darshe, and Poppie<br/>

&gt; &gt; Stonewall Pride<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hi folks:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A gay guild is forming on The Nameless server at this time and we<br/>
&gt; &gt; invite anyone interested to join us and be part of &quot;Stonewall <br/>
Pride.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Stonewall Pride&quot; is the tentative name of the new guild (yet to <br/>
be<br/>
&gt; &gt; approved by Verant).  We hope to create a guild based on a <br/>
welcoming<br/>
&gt; &gt; gay / lesbian / bi / trans fellowship where any of us can play EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt; without being subject to the anti-gay prejudice that we frequently<br/>
&gt; &gt; encounter in Norrath.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We&#39;re still formulating the charter and operating mode so you can<br/>
&gt; &gt; definitely provide input regarding your ideas about a gay guild or<br/>
&gt; &gt; your experiences in a gay guild such as the renown Mystic <br/>
Adventurers<br/>
&gt; &gt; on Rodcet Nife.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We&#39;re currently using a Yahoo Club for contact -<br/>
&gt; &gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/gayandlesbianeverquestfolk.">http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/gayandlesbianeverquestfolk.</a>  We&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; having a meeting in the chat room of that club on Monday June <br/>
11th at<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8pm Central time (6pm PST) to discuss &quot;Stonewall Pride&quot; and how to<br/>
&gt; &gt; get it running smoothly.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Many of us have moved from other servers to The Nameless so we <br/>
mostly<br/>
&gt; &gt; have lowbie characters at this point - not aware of any over 20 <br/>
yet -<br/>
&gt; &gt; so start up a character on The Nameless and join us!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Best wishes to all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
