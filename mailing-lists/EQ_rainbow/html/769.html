<br/>
Do you have your shortcut keys set up for tells and replys?  For <br/>
example to tell, I just hit the letter T and it automatically fills <br/>
in the /tell part, same with R for reply, etc...<br/>

&gt;   Well, more fun with yesterday&#39;s patch. I type in Dvorak (a<br/>
&gt; different keyboard layout), which EQ has not supported. Throws me<br/>
&gt; from 90 wpm in Dvorak to about 30 in qwerty. So, last month a patch<br/>
&gt; on the test server had a message that Verant was looking to modify <br/>
EQ <br/>
&gt; to support various keyboard layouts -- hurray! I followed the <br/>
&gt; instructions to modify a text file & email it back to the guy in <br/>
&gt; charge of that fix so that he would know what keys went where in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; layout I use. I also told him when I did so that the modified text <br/>
&gt; file to enable Dvorak caused a problem -- a few keys (most<br/>
&gt; importantly the slash key) didn&#39;t work.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Well, yesterday&#39;s patch included the new file -- with the bug <br/>
still <br/>
&gt; in it. This means I cannot /g, /gu, /r, /t, /shout, or /anything at <br/>
&gt; all. Aargh! Switching my computer back to qwerty doesn&#39;t change <br/>
this, <br/>
&gt; as EQ sets its keyboard layout from its own files.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   So, until this is fixed, I&#39;m stuck switching chat channels in the <br/>
&gt; chat box. Expect me to be in /gu as the default (I think that&#39;s one<br/>
&gt; of the options in there -- surely hope so!), so I won&#39;t be able to <br/>
&gt; /say, /t, or /r anything without a bit of a delay to switch it <br/>
around <br/>
&gt; in the chat box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Hmmm. How do I use sign-language ingame? </span></blockquote></div>
