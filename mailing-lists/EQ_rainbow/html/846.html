&gt; Hi Owen,<br/>
&gt;     I do not know anyone on the Brell server.  We have a gay guild on<br/>
Rodcet<br/>
&gt; Nife.  If you ever think about switching servers come join up with us  =)<br/>
&gt; We have people who would powerlevel your characters up to where you are<br/>
&gt; now.  We have a few bears in our guild (including my lover) and are<br/>
&gt; accepting of everyone as long as they accept us (even breeders =P).  The<br/>
&gt; guild is more centered around the game than it is our sexuality.  The<br/>
guild<br/>
&gt; is a place where we can play free of harassment and when people do harass<br/>
us<br/>
&gt; we have the rest of the guild to back us up.  We are over 50 strong now in<br/>
&gt; the Mystic Alliance.  There is also a bear specific guild on the Lanys<br/>
T&#39;Vyl<br/>
&gt; server.  I just recently created a character there and joined them but<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; are a smaller guild.<br/>

&gt; We also have a website.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mysticalliance.im1ru12.org">http://mysticalliance.im1ru12.org</a>  If you want a<br/>
&gt; member account email me and I&#39;ll set it up.  We also have a guild mailing<br/>
&gt; list on egroups(which is changing to Yahoo) look for mysticalliance.<br/>

&gt; &gt; My nameis Owen DuBose and I&#39;m a relatively new player to EQ but a<br/>

&gt; &gt; My primary character is an Ogre ShadowKnight named Grackk, level 12,<br/>

&gt; &gt; up fletching, smithing and brewing skills while taking side trips to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lavastorm to kill drakes and rock dervishes :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My secondary character is a Human Cleric named Dhalgren who is<br/>
&gt; &gt; currentl hanging in N. Qeynos taking trips to Blackburrow to harass<br/>
&gt; &gt; some the gnolls. He is 6th level.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Dan&#39;s primary character is a 13th lvl DE Necro named Staben who is, I<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dan has a secondary character he hasn&#39;t even played yet, lol.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We are very interested in the possibilty of being a part of a g/l<br/>
&gt; &gt; guild on Brell or starting one if there isn&#39;t one. We are also<br/>
&gt; &gt; interested in locating other &quot;bear&quot; and &quot;big bear&quot; buddies on Brell<br/>

&gt; Just a clarification.  I was not putting down the bear guild on Lanys<br/>
T&#39;Vyl.<br/>
&gt; The people I have met there have been nothing but nice to me.  I was just<br/>
used<br/>
&gt; to a bigger guild.   After I read my post it looked like a put down which<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t mean at all.  Please accept this apology.<br/>

&gt; Hey Owen!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We used to have a fairly active gay guild on Brell Serilis, but lately<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s been quite dead there. I am retired from EQ myself, but I have a 54<br/>
&gt; enchanter and a 52 ranger on Brell. If you need to borrow some plat, or<br/>
&gt; need some jewlery made, feel free to email me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most of our group is on Rodcet Nife where I understand we have a fairly<br/>
&gt; active happy guild.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you would like to be part of the queer guild on Brell I can add you as<br/>
&gt; well but it is pretty dead.  We&#39;re called &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; on both<br/>
&gt; Brell and Rodcet.<br/>
