<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770973320">So far, I have heard no feedback for the Rainbow Festival on Brell Serilis. I have<br/>
tentatively scheduled it for this Saturday. If you are interested in it, please let<br/>
me know and we can pick out a time that will be suitable for the most people. I am<br/>
available anytime that day (since my husband will be out of town). So, I just need<br/>
to know what time works for those who are interested.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</div>
