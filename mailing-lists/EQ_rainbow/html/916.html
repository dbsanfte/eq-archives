<div id="ygrps-yiv-810834302">I also play on Innoruuk,  and I think I started talking to you once <br/>
Amrosse.  Upeer introduced us in /t.   I am currently in the guild <br/>
Elder Tribunal, but think that it is time to look for a new guild.<br/>
<br/>
Drop me a /t sometime and maybe we can bash some heads in the realms!<br/>
<br/>
Later,<br/>

&gt; Hi all. My boyfriend and I currently reside on the Innorruk &lt;sp&gt; <br/>
server and are very happy. I&#39;ve never had a bad run-in with any, and <br/>
our guild is very supportive.<br/>

&gt; Give us a yell.<br/>
