<div id="ygrps-yiv-755176481">i am sorry to hear that you and your lover were vebaly abused on EQ i<br/>
hope that the GMs get their act together or else i will boycott the game<br/>
and will put messages in the advocat and other gay magazines saying that<br/>
EQ is not gay friendly even though they state that they promote<br/>
tolerance<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
			With you all the way<br/>
