Favorite EQ Monster/s: Willowisps<br/>
Most Hated EQ Monster/s: Bouncer (killed me 5 times in 9 minutes cause I was<br/>
bound where he was standing. He&#39;s why I quit for 9 months.)<br/>
Favorite TV Show/s:<br/>
     Simpsons   Will and Grace (or should we say Jack and Karen)<br/>
Favorite Author/s:<br/>
     Orson Scott Card<br/>
Any non-EQ hobbies:<br/>
    Sitting in our hot tub, being a gay activist, writing, going to the<br/>
beach to look at guys, going to the mall to look at guys, going anywhere to<br/>
look at guys. ;)<br/>
A few words that describe you:<br/>
    Easy going, until someone pushes me too far.<br/>
<br/>
FYI: If you close your EQ account and come back 9 months later, your<br/>
characters will still be there (even though they say they will delete them<br/>
in 60 days). Unfortunately, I deleted all my Brell Serillis characters<br/>
before I quit. :(</div>
