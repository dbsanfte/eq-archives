<div id="ygrps-yiv-401148931">actually i was opposed ot letting the perosn join the guild just for the<br/>
event as I feels it cheapens the honor of being a member, but he was invited<br/>
becasue he was a friend of someone.  He had never been in the guild.  I&#39;m<br/>
opposed to any charchter being invited who dosnt plan on staying...but i<br/>
digress....<br/>
<br/>
Send Iny over to lower guk if you want, i will be there for a while.  Even<br/>
if shes not in the guild, we can still group, bring her spouse while yer at<br/>
it :)<br/>

&gt; lol lol..  hehe i&#39;ve been posting in the guild mailing list, i just wanted<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; be on this one too :D    Well, I would love to have ivy in our guild, but<br/>
she<br/>
&gt; is in her spouce&#39;s guild for now.. however i really want her to group with<br/>
&gt; the higher ups if thats ok!   I remember that one guy joined the guild<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; for the SRo event that one time, but I think he used to be in the guild or<br/>
&gt; something..  so maybe thats why you made an exception??  :)    Well if<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s any more get togethers, would it be ok for ivy to join in the fun?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for good times!<br/>
