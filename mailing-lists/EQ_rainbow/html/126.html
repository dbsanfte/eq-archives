<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049575100">Wow this guild stuff is really exciting but I have some reservations.<br/>
<br/>
-I am not a hard core role-player, but pretty close so if this guild is<br/>
going to work for me it has to have some basis in<br/>
reality...err....norrathian reality (need to talk to therapist about that)<br/>
<br/>
    Suggestions ---   Name: citizens of Unity (Unity could work alone but I<br/>
feel it would be better with a another word also)<br/>
                            Purpose:  Created by GLBT citizens of Norrath<br/>
who felt ostracized by norrathian culture (i.e. 12 year old bys who call<br/>
each other homo) who seek to combat ignorance in all fomrs be sustainging a<br/>
guild where all members respect and learn from each other.  (something<br/>
should also be said here about how people do not ahve to even really love or<br/>
even like eahc other just respect, that way my high elf wizard can still<br/>
call our dark elf guild members &quot;smelly&quot;)  maybe we can say:  not all of our<br/>
members think, act, or smell alike (har har), nor do they always get along,<br/>
but they always strive for knowledge of the poeples of Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
-Our guild has to obviously be opne to anyone, but also retain some sort of<br/>
GLBTedness...how is thig going to be done?<br/>
<br/>
  suggestion:   only thing i can think of is that well, mostly we are going<br/>
to be promoting it so it will be motsly us, but dosnt the above suggested<br/>
description not even sound like a GLBT guild????  i dont know i&#39;m confused.<br/>
Its hard to think of a way to balance the fact that we gay peple want a<br/>
guild, but everyone should be able to be in it, and it should amke some<br/>
sense to have it in Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-I created a charchter on Brell, and he is cute and cool, but i just cant<br/>
give up time on my other chatchter, so i will be tkaing the guild to Rodcet<br/>
Nife.<br/>
<br/>
sorry if this is annoying or if i&#39;ve repeated myself and others but if this<br/>
is going to happen on wednesday then maybe we need to tlak a bit more, i&#39;m<br/>
going to try to be there on wed night so that nothing &quot;bad&quot; IMHO happens :)<br/>
I would hate to have to pass on the guild because i felt it didint appeal ot<br/>
my role playing sensability or somehting....then again that means there<br/>
could be morethan one GLBT kinda guild, and that is even more<br/>
interesting.,...(thinking Lesbian Dwarf Avengers)<br/>
