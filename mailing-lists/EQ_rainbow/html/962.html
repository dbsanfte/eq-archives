<b>Subject:</b> Where on Norrath art thee? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-795870966">Hi all, I recently discovered and got involved in a crazy addiction <br/>
called EQ. Upon searching Egroups I was glad to find this group and <br/>
and to be part of it.<br/>
Although my first sweet character resides on Torvinilious(sic) I <br/>
would love to start again on The Nameless One and be part of the <br/>
guild. Only problem (if their is one, remember I&#39;m a newbie here)is <br/>
what city of Norrath are most based in, as I wouldn&#39;t want to create <br/>
a character far away and not get the chance to say &quot;hail&quot; to all the <br/>
other guild members I meet.<br/>
Good Hunting<br/>

(Who recently went to the aid of another player outside the gates of <br/>
Qeynos fighting a lousy snake, went LD, and came back to a dead <br/>
character. I&#39;m so embarrased rofl.)</div>
