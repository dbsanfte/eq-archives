<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529944279">Ok i like this name now, but it needs a good back-story / charter /<br/>
guidlines to be even better  :):):  I think the charter and background<br/>
should both reflect role-playing syles as much as possible (dodging<br/>

&gt; Just re-read the second paragraph of Christina&#39;s post. Do you see why I<br/>
&gt; suggested it? I originally laughed out loud at my thought of calling the guild<br/>
&gt; Mystic Gaydar, but then Mystic Alliance seemed pretty good. Not that every<br/>
&gt; GLBT man and woman feel called to associate with each other, but obviously a<br/>
&gt; bunch of us here do... that&#39;s mystical, spiritual, mysterious, magical... and<br/>
&gt; everything wrapped up together. No religious affiliation is  taken from the<br/>
&gt; name either. Although angels and archangels, etc. sound nice, most people did<br/>
&gt; not want to inject Judeo-Christian ideas into Norrathian culture.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s almost certain that no one name will be the ultimate to everyone<br/>
&gt; involved. Arriving at a consensus fairly soon would be great as I am excited<br/>
&gt; and wanting to let everyone I know about it. Having the name to relay with the<br/>
&gt; rest of the information is important to start building a guild identity and<br/>
&gt; presence.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for your ideas-<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; I just cant shut up<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the name is cool but what would be &quot;mystic&quot;?  It has to refer to<br/>
&gt; somehting.  Do we seek mytery?  or we mystic?  the name has to ahhve some<br/>
&gt; meaning yes?<br/>

&gt; &gt; I like the story as well, and I agree with Christina that we don&#39;t need to<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; outcasts. As far as names for the women in the history, there&#39;s a couple I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have in mind, but need to look up tonight before posting.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In reading your message, Christina, another name came to mind &lt;as she<br/>
&gt; &gt; cautiously tosses it into the fray&gt;: Mystic Alliance<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think the GLBT-related names have pretty much been dropped in discussion<br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt; &gt; most people. This name is role-play appropriate, it is somewhat mysterious<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; the alliance part is what we are about. There is nothing good/evil impliant<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the name, nor any specific class or race.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Although the GLBT link may not be apparent in any name chosen, it is easy<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough to add symbolism to any graphics/logo associated with a guild site.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Granted, it wouldn&#39;t be visually attached to our names in the game, but if<br/>
&gt; &gt; people want to know, they&#39;ll ask or look for a website for information.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As far as publicity for the guild once things are a bit settled, PlanetOut<br/>
&gt; &gt; might be a great online zine to contact. Their turnaround time for getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; information out is much quicker than the print media. I think they may also<br/>
&gt; &gt; have links to GLBT websites, which would be great when we have one for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; guild. I can&#39;t recall if there is a gay-related news service bureau. Some<br/>
&gt; &gt; individuals were trying to create one a while ago. The BBC is very queer<br/>
&gt; &gt; friendly and could be interested in a story, especially if we wish to reach<br/>
&gt; &gt; our brothers and sisters in the EU. Wired may also be a good place to reach<br/>
&gt; &gt; GLBT gamers and they have their email newsletters as well.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I enjoyed chatting with you all in the guild formation last night. This is<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; start of something really great.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m fine with this story. I don&#39;t see the need for us to be outcasts <br/>
&gt; &gt; though. I personally prefer to assume that Norathian culture is generally <br/>
&gt; &gt; accepting of diverse sexual orientation, and that players who express <br/>
&gt; &gt; otherwise are members of some strange minority. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; One thing I would like to see in terms of roleplay is that GLBT and <br/>
&gt; &gt; positive people share a kind of bond that is manifests itself as a <br/>
&gt; &gt; tangible spiritual connection. Something along the lines of us all coming <br/>
&gt; &gt; together because we had this connection, and could sense it in eachother. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Kind of a mystic gaydar 8) I like it because this implies a reason for us <br/>
&gt; &gt; to exist in an organization beyond combating homophobia (which implies <br/>
&gt; &gt; homophobia is a force requiring an organization to combat). <br/>
