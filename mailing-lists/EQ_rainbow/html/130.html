&gt; so what you are saying is that once a quild is started all you have to<br/>
&gt; do is tell the guild gm that you want to carry it over? so once you got<br/>
&gt; the orginal 10 people on the first server you can have 1 person on each<br/>
&gt; other server sort of like recruters? or do there have to be 10 people<br/>
&gt; also on the other servers?  well what ever the situation if we can get<br/>
&gt; it going on more than one server that would be great because i know that<br/>
&gt; there are other people on bristle bane server (my main server other than<br/>
&gt; the test server which i use soo little that it dont really count) which<br/>
&gt; btw i love what they are doing with rogues (no they are not turning on<br/>
&gt; their skills) now you can use both sneak and hide at the same time so<br/>
&gt; you can hide while you are moving at sneak speed!! they also upped the<br/>
&gt; effectiveness of back stab!! i cant wait until they start it up on the<br/>
&gt; regular servers!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
