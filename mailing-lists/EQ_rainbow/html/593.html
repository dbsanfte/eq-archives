My brother appeared in a TV movie aired recently called Common Ground, it<br/>
starred Johnathon Taylor Thomas.  My brother played a gay basher who<br/>
assaulted JTT who was playing a gay highschool boy.  I actually got to<br/>
talk to JTT on the phone one, which I was surprised to find actually<br/>
excited me lol.  I haven&#39;t actually seen Common Ground as it hasn&#39;t been<br/>
shown in Canada =/<br/>
<br/>
My brother also appears in Snow Day, a movie that opened this weekend.<br/>
It&#39;s basicly a kids movie.  He plays Bill, the leading man&#39;s side kick.<br/>
