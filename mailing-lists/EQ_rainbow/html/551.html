<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045185787">I&#39;m sorry to hear you&#39;re leavign David.  I&#39;m glad you will be staying on<br/>
the list.  Who knows, maybe some day we will all be ex-EQ players ;)<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone here tried Asheron&#39;s Call? My net-wife Duna has recently been<br/>
expressing her own boredom with EQ, and has tried it out, and she seems to<br/>
like it.  As I understand it has some pretty serious flaws in comparison<br/>
with EQ, in particular stupid monsters (it&#39;s apparently really easy to get<br/>
to a &quot;safe spot&quot; and bolt a monster to death).  I think I will try it none<br/>
the less just for a change of pace, and to hang out with Duna.  We&#39;ll<br/>
probably skip the whole exploit thing and go for a tank/healer two person<br/>
combo which I find to be pretty fun.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting a bit bored of EQ myself.  Being 50th level...not much to do<br/>
but camp items.  Luckily Verant has made sure that getting a full suit of<br/>
plane of fear/hate armor will take a ridiculous amount of play time to<br/>
achieve.  So, I still have something to shoot for.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing my ranger a lot lately.  Her name is Pixy, and she&#39;s<br/>
27th level now.  I play with my real life boyfriend, who has a level 29<br/>
cleric.  It&#39;s pretty fun, and we are a formidible team.  To maximize our<br/>
effectiveness we&#39;ve been fighting a wonderful undead spawn in rathe<br/>
mountains.  This gives us the advantages of (a) he can bolt the undead<br/>
when necessary with his cleric undead bolts (b) I can use harmony (since<br/>
this is an outdoors area) to ensure we almost only pull one creature.  I<br/>
think this undead spawn will take us to level 31, at which time I will<br/>
have to find another place to hunt.<br/>
