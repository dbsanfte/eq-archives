<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-774313998">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
I am pleased to now be a member of the EQ Rainbow board.  I found <br/>
your listing through one of the other EQ message boards.<br/>
<br/>
I have been seriously thinking of relocating servers to join many of <br/>
you on the Rodcet Nife server.  Currently i have several low level <br/>
characters on the Mithaniel Marr server, so if any of you are on that <br/>
server please give me an in-game tell or email me (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jdincinci@...">jdincinci@...</a>).<br/>
<br/>
A little about me:<br/>
<br/>
* James Dillon<br/>
* 28<br/>
* I live in Cincinnati, OH and work for an advertising agency as <br/>
their Information Systems person, i.e. Nick Burns (for all of you <br/>
Saturday Night Live fans).<br/>
<br/>
Primary Character (right now):  Renette 10 Wood Elf Druid<br/>
<br/>
I have several other characters, but Renette is the one i&#39;ve been <br/>
playing most lately.<br/>
<br/>
Most Hated EQ Monster:  The Kerran High Guard.  My first character <br/>
was an Erudite Magician and i was one of the rare people that <br/>
actually hunted in Tox Forest and Kerra Isle.  That Kerran High Guard <br/>
must have killed me 50 times before i decided to take my first boat <br/>
ride to Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
Favorite EQ Monster:  Spectre (Only because they are neat looking)<br/>
<br/>
Well i will stop there.  I will probably create a character on Rodcet <br/>
Nife now just so i can have a fun group to chat with.  Do you have <br/>
any low level characters in your guild (Mystic Alliance)?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am glad to have found this group and other gay people that <br/>
like playing EQ...I knew you were out there!<br/>
<br/>
