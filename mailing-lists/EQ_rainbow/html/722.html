<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028959224">Well, more fun with yesterday&#39;s patch. I type in Dvorak (a<br/>
different keyboard layout), which EQ has not supported. Throws me<br/>
from 90 wpm in Dvorak to about 30 in qwerty. So, last month a patch<br/>
on the test server had a message that Verant was looking to modify EQ <br/>
to support various keyboard layouts -- hurray! I followed the <br/>
instructions to modify a text file & email it back to the guy in <br/>
charge of that fix so that he would know what keys went where in the <br/>
layout I use. I also told him when I did so that the modified text <br/>
file to enable Dvorak caused a problem -- a few keys (most<br/>
importantly the slash key) didn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
  Well, yesterday&#39;s patch included the new file -- with the bug still <br/>
in it. This means I cannot /g, /gu, /r, /t, /shout, or /anything at <br/>
all. Aargh! Switching my computer back to qwerty doesn&#39;t change this, <br/>
as EQ sets its keyboard layout from its own files.<br/>
<br/>
  So, until this is fixed, I&#39;m stuck switching chat channels in the <br/>
chat box. Expect me to be in /gu as the default (I think that&#39;s one<br/>
of the options in there -- surely hope so!), so I won&#39;t be able to <br/>
/say, /t, or /r anything without a bit of a delay to switch it around <br/>
in the chat box.<br/>
<br/>
  Hmmm. How do I use sign-language ingame?</div>
