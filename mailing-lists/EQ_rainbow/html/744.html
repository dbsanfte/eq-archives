Subject: [EQ_rainbow] Another on Rodcet now ...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m alive!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And after Brell, and a break from EQ, then Luclin .. I moved to Rodcet<br/>
last<br/>
&gt; night with a friend from Luclin., who&#39;s already introduced himself ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I should do the info thing:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First Name: Lora<br/>
&gt; Age:            36 - do I have to!!<br/>
&gt; Location:       Raleigh NC (waves at David - the snow finally metled! now<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; it will just stop raining)<br/>
&gt; Gender:         female<br/>
&gt; Home Page:  don&#39;t have one really .. assorted junk at<br/>
&gt; www.mindspring.com/~loraroa<br/>
&gt; Status:         Married, kids -- err kids yes -- I&#39;m *ACK* straight! - but<br/>
&gt; for those that missed my intro - I<br/>
&gt;                       was effectively raised by two &quot;uncles&quot; after my<br/>
&gt; (abusive) father&#39;s death when I was young .. I<br/>
&gt;                       owe my choice of career to one (and he helped put me<br/>
&gt; thru college) and my choice of hobbies to<br/>
&gt;                       the other.   And I knew and accepted thier relat. in<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; way I think only young children do - it simply<br/>
&gt;                       always was.   They were my family .. and the only<br/>
&gt; stable, kind, loving non-abusive males in my<br/>
&gt;                       life as a child.   And they weren&#39;t even really<br/>
uncles<br/>
&gt; .. just neighbors who helped two kids<br/>
&gt;                       (my brother too) after thier dad died .. and took it<br/>
&gt; on themselves.<br/>
&gt; Main Character: Hechicera (spanish for Enchatress) Enchantress on RN<br/>
&gt;                               Lisha (the darkness before midnight) DE SK<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; RN<br/>
&gt;                               Redowl Barb Shaman on RN<br/>
&gt;                               all started yesterday levels 4, 3, 1 this<br/>
&gt; second<br/>
&gt;                               my main on Luclin was a Bard .. got fairly<br/>
&gt; high<br/>
&gt;                               my mains on Brell were warrior and wiz<br/>
&gt;                               started life right after beta on Karana as a<br/>
&gt; Rogue (they were really broken then)<br/>
&gt; Most Hated EQ Monster: spiderlings!  they are a plague.<br/>
&gt; Favorite EQ Monster:  Frontier Mountain giants .. the biggest &quot;pet&quot; I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; ever had! (as Bard - seemed to be easy to charm)<br/>
&gt; Fav. TV Show: ick TV ;)<br/>
&gt; Fav. Author: most SF / Fantasy .. Andre Norton & Isaac Asimov are the two<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; blame for starting me in the genre&#39;s as a child<br/>
&gt; non-EQ hobbies:  Well, until my congenital defects got bad enough to<br/>
become<br/>
&gt; a disability .. I used to train horses for<br/>
&gt; &quot;High School&quot; .. not just dressage and some jumping ..as well as breed<br/>
them.<br/>
&gt; I used to work too .. as two different kinds of an Engineer and then as a<br/>
&gt; high-tech web geek type.  Now I mainly do my PT exercises as a forced<br/>
hobby,<br/>
&gt; and stick to smaller<br/>
&gt; animals (dogs and trying out hamsters now).<br/>
