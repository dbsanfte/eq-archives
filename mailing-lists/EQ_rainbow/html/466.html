<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432009256">Well, I have thrown something together to get our web site started.<br/>

<br/>
NOTE: It is all DRAFT only. That means you see something you don&#39;t like, just<br/>
flame me and I&#39;ll change it ;) Also, the URL may be temporary as we could get<br/>
our site hosted by either one of our members or on one of the sites that<br/>
provides space for guild sites.<br/>
<br/>
Also, note that there is a members list page that has only me listed on it. I<br/>
will add everyone who wants to be added, but you must ask to be put on the list<br/>
as it is the WWW. I am not outing anyone lest you request it and you can leave<br/>
out some information if you don&#39;t want it listed.<br/>
<br/>
I literally just threw this together (I love FrontPage 98) and it just uses<br/>
stock graphics. We can change the look as soon as we get better graphics made<br/>
by some of the wonderfully creative people on the list.<br/>
<br/>
I plan to add a screen capture page soon (I got some good shots of a unicorn in<br/>
LFay yesterday). Character pictures welcome. I would love to have a group shot<br/>
of all our people on a per server basis.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to your feedback, both good and bad (but hopefully polite).<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
David</div>
