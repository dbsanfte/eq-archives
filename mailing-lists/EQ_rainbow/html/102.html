<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424307516">Hey David,<br/>
<br/>
I have an idea for an IC guild concept.  Our guild could be a<br/>
multi-racial multi-class guild.  I.E. DE Necros, and Troll SKs working<br/>
with Paladins and Druids.  The guild would not ask that evil people be<br/>
good, or good people be evil, but it would require that all guild members<br/>
cooperate and be honorable to eachother.  This would also fit in with the<br/>
name Unity.  This is kind of a wacky concept, but I thought I&#39;d throw it<br/>
out 8) <br/>
<br/>
9:30pm Wednesday EST sounds good to me.  I may be a little late, but I&#39;ll<br/>
be there.<br/>

&gt; Okay, I&#39;ll be the guild master.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t heard any negative comments about the name &#39;Unity&#39;, so I think that will<br/>
&gt; be the name unless someone else has something better. So, let&#39;s make plans for this<br/>
&gt; Wednesday to meet in chat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will make the channel &#39;Unity&#39; and the password will be &#39;rainbow&#39; in all lower case<br/>
&gt; (and case does matter.) If you have any trouble getting into the chat room, just<br/>
&gt; contact me directly, my chat name is Lari.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now we need a time to get 10 people all together at once. I am in Eastern Daylight<br/>
&gt; Time. I can be on as early as 4:30pm EDT, and as late as 10:30pm EDT. If we shoot<br/>
&gt; for early in that window, we can get some of our European members on, but will miss<br/>
&gt; the US Pacific time people who may still be at work. Let&#39;s tentatively set it for<br/>
&gt; 9:30pm EDT, this Wednesday. Please let me know if you will be able to attend the<br/>
&gt; chat at that time. If you cannot, then please tell me a time when you can, in case I<br/>
&gt; have to reschedule.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We will work first to create the guild on Brell Serilis, and then spread it to other<br/>
&gt; servers fairly quickly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would also suggest we need to describe the guild in OOC and IC terms. OOC it will<br/>
&gt; be a guild that is open to tolerant, fair-minded people who are GLBT or affirming.<br/>
&gt; But what do we want it to be &#39;in character&#39;. I&#39;d suggest that it certainly not<br/>
&gt; discriminate at all based on race or class. Also, do we want to promote RPing, or<br/>
&gt; just encourage it, or not bother with it? Or do we just want a guild to provide help<br/>
&gt; and friendship to our sister and brother guild mates (such as selling banded armor<br/>
&gt; at a steep discount and things like that?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If anyone has any better ideas or plans, please share them.<br/>
