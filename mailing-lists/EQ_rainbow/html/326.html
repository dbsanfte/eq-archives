<br/>
I am a lvl 13 wizard and I need a shoulder to cry on.  I have reached that<br/>
stage where I have bcome bored and frustrated by EQ.  I can&#39;t find quality<br/>
poelpe to quest with, most that I have found before are way past me now in<br/>
level.  I am so fucing sick of going to the same places and getting hardly<br/>
any expeirence, and spending half the time meditating.  what do I do!!!???<br/>
Woe is me!   how did you all get past this time?   Is there anyplace I<br/>
sbould go to get good exp or items?  I dont ave anything cool or any<br/>
latinum I am pathetic....|:(  &lt;snif&gt;<br/>
