<div id="ygrps-yiv-973531000">Actually, we have fairly even numbers in each class, with the <br/>
exception of cleric -- we&#39;re running slightly higher on them. Of <br/>
course, with my main being a bard, I personally think that&#39;s a good <br/>
thing. :)<br/>

&gt; YAY YAY YAY!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is there any class the guild needs most?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve pretty much played them all (a good way to avoid burnout and <br/>
&gt; frustration!) and am comfortable with most.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I tend to shy away from Hybrids.. too many restrictions.. I like to <br/>
&gt; see progress on the xp bar as well as RP/have a good time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hopefully I&#39;ll be on this evening (the thrill of joining y&#39;all (I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; in Atlanta, I can say it that way) is too much!) :)<br/>
