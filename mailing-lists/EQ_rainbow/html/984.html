<div id="ygrps-yiv-595253431">The Mystic alliance (www.mysticalliance.com) does indeed exist, and there<br/>
are around 60 members (about 40 of which are semi to fully active). I fall<br/>
into the inactive category. (on a hiatus for various reasons, not the least<br/>
of which is Anarchy Online) We are on the Rodcet NIfe server, and the web<br/>
page should give you an idea of us. (There&#39;s a fine, active message board<br/>
there). As far as officers, they&#39;d be Snapdragyn, Ompa, Taren, Gwynap,<br/>
Gunarr, Aethyra, Trinic, Marri, Gaiwan, Vargyr, Andelyve, Gaybriel, Leta, or<br/>
Armande (if I&#39;m on...still have some time left on the current pay<br/>
period...stop in now and then to say hi). If I left out any officers, I&#39;m<br/>
sorry. Anyone else in the guild would be happy to talk to ya, but those are<br/>
the people who can do the inviting. :-) So we&#39;re not by any means dead.<br/>
