<b>Subject:</b> Returning To Norrath <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-437939072">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
After a long hiatus, I have decided to return to the world or Norrath. Since<br/>
the guild seems to be doing well on Rodcet Nife, and I have to start over<br/>
from scratch anyway, I figured I&#39;d create a character or two on that server.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any people in the guild who have low level characters there that I<br/>
could group with? If so, what race/class should I play to complement them?<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t followed all the various nerfs since I quit, so I don&#39;t know what<br/>
would be a good class to play anymore. If there is one in particular that I<br/>
should avoid (have they ever finished the rogues?) please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Once I get back online, I&#39;ll publish my character info to the list and I&#39;ll<br/>
certainly give a tell in game.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
David</div>
