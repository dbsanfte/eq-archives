<b>Subject:</b> Update on Saturday&#39;s Wedding! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882018246">Hail!<br/>
<br/>
The wedding is tomorrow, Saturday, Oct. 21st and the grooms can hardly wait.<br/>
Here, are some more details for those who plan to attend:<br/>
<br/>
The ceremony itself will start at:<br/>
4pm Eastern<br/>
3pm Central<br/>
2pm Mountain<br/>
1pm Pacific<br/>
9pm GMT<br/>
<br/>
It will be in the Toxxulia Forest zone. It will be near the little dock with<br/>
the rowboat.<br/>
<br/>
From the druid ring, travel SW.<br/>
<br/>
From the wizard circle, travel NW and cross the river. There is a bridge.<br/>
After crossing the bridge go almost due west to get to the dock.<br/>
<br/>
From Erudin, travel SW till you get to the water, then head directly south.<br/>
<br/>
(For those using an EQ Atlas map of Toxxulia Forest, it is the point labeled<br/>
number 7)<br/>
<br/>
WARNING: There is a necro named Elial Brook (level 6 or 7ish) that hangs out<br/>
near the dock. He cons ready to attack to most people. We will need someone<br/>
to kill him regularly to protect any low levels attending the wedding. His<br/>
spawn time is 6 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Fentus and Kerik will be doing ports prior to the ceremony. I should be on<br/>
around noon Eastern on Saturday to begin setting things up, so give me a<br/>
tell if you need a port. For obvious reasons, I will not be able to port if<br/>
you are running late.<br/>
<br/>
Guests from other servers are encouraged to create Rodcet Nife characters if<br/>
you wish to attend. It would be best to create Erudite characters. Taren<br/>
will be available at the entrance to Erudin to buff and sow you for a safe<br/>
journey to the wedding / reception site.<br/>
<br/>
Taren and Gwynap are catering the reception. They have prepared quite a<br/>
feast with plenty of spirits too. There is also talk of getting fireworks.<br/>
It should be cool.<br/>
<br/>
I am very dubious of the GM showing up to do the ceremony. I was told to<br/>
petition tonight (Friday) to remind them and also to petition on Saturday 2<br/>
hours prior. However, our very own Kythwin has agreed to serve as minister<br/>
if the GM should be a no-show.<br/>
<br/>
We are expecting 10-20 people at least, and think it will be a lot of fun.<br/>
We will have at least one person from another server and also, Harbinger<br/>
from Band of Gypsies plans to attend (BTW he says hello to everyone in<br/>
Mystic Alliance).<br/>
<br/>
While setting up an EQ wedding is easier than a real one, it has taken a lot<br/>
of work nonetheless. Thanks to everyone who has helped. Eizen and I really<br/>
appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs and kisses,<br/>
Kerik and Eizen</div>
