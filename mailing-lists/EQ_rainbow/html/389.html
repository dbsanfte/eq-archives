I totally missed the festival posting, can you repost?<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to a chance to get together with everyone on Brell to play.<br/>
We have a lot of great people on this mailing list, and I think it&#39;ll be<br/>
really fun to give the guild a kick start so we can all start playing<br/>
together 8)<br/>
<br/>
As a master smith, and master jewler, I look forward to giving guild<br/>
members stuff at cost.  If you&#39;re already on the server, just send me a<br/>
tell.<br/>
