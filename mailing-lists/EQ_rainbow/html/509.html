&gt; &gt;  Four men went golfing one day. Three of them headed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the first tee and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the fourth went into the clubhouse to take care of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the bill.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The three men started talking, bragging about their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sons.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The first man told the others, &quot;My son is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; homebuilder and he is so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; successful that he gave a friend<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a new home for free.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The second man said, &quot;My son was a car salesman and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; now he owns a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; multi-line dealership. He&#39;s so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; successful that he gave a friend a new Mercedes,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fully loaded.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The third man, not wanting to be outdone, bragged,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;My son is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stockbroker and he&#39;s doing so well<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that he gave his friend an entire stock portfolio.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The fourth man joined them on the tee after a few<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; minutes of taking care<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of business. The first man mentioned, &quot;We are just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; talking about our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sons. How is yours doing?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The fourth man replied, &quot;Well, my son is gay and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; dances in a gay bar.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not totally thrilled about the dancing job, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; he must be doing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; good.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; His last three boyfriends gave him a house, a brand<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; new Mercedes, and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stock portfolio.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
