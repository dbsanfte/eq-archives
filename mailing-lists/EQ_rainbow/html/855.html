<div id="ygrps-yiv-321165517">I turned the guild leadership over to someone before I quit Brell. Can&#39;t<br/>
remember who eventually wound up with it. With the guild purges for guilds<br/>
with less than 10 members, I would imagine it may have been wiped out.<br/>
<br/>
Let me also encourage you to come over to Rodcet. My Druid, Kerik, will be<br/>
glad to help you PL a bit to get up to speed again. Also there are any<br/>
number of people who will gladly re-equip you on Rodcet too.<br/>

&gt; Hi Owen,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is a gay guild on Brell, namely the (now defunct) mystical alliance.<br/>
&gt; I believe David (who may still be reading this list) is the guild owner. I<br/>
&gt; have an officer character on Brell still in greater faydark (perhaps in<br/>
&gt; freeport as well not sure) and I can add you to the guild if you would<br/>
&gt; like. Just email me and we can work out a time. </span></blockquote></div>
