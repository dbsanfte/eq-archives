This article is about boys who play girls in online games.  It was pretty<br/>
interesting.  I was surprised at some of the reasons why boys play girls<br/>
in online games.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that kind of surprised me was that while the &quot;are they gay&quot;<br/>
issue was raised, there were no quotes or commentary from a gay survey<br/>
respondant.  My spider sense says that at least one of the 64 respondants<br/>
was gay or bi (there was a crossdresser who responded).<br/>
