<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123373506">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I havn&#39;t played EQ in quite a while now, and honestly don&#39;t have any desire<br/>
:)  I just uninstalled EQ and Rob will probably be doing the same soon.  I&#39;m<br/>
not sure what we are going to do with Fentus and Genesius, probably just log<br/>
on and give stuff away.  Anyways, I just wanted to say goodbye to all of<br/>
you, and wish you luck in all your adventures!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
hugs and kisses!<br/>
