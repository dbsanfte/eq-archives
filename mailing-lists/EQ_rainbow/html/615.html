<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552093073">One thing most people don&#39;t know is that when you create a new character,<br/>
your character&#39;s name is submitted to a random guide who must either<br/>
approve or deny your character&#39;s name.  I believe if no guides are present<br/>
it&#39;s automatically allowed, but if a guide is around they have a chance to<br/>
approve or deny it.<br/>
<br/>
I was guiding on Rodcet the other night and I got a name approval request<br/>
for &quot;Charismaqueer&quot; a high elf enchanter.  I denied it of course.  I then<br/>
watched in some amazement as, over the next 20 minute period, this guy<br/>
tried every alternate spelling of charismaqueer he could think of.<br/>
Karizmaqweer etc.  It was kind of amusing to just keep denying him his<br/>
name over and over again as he tried to out guess the &quot;computer program&quot;<br/>
that he probably figured was denying his name.<br/>
<br/>
Just a little update on my play server while I&#39;m here, I&#39;ve been having a<br/>
pretty good time but I&#39;m trying to relax a little.  I&#39;ve become very<br/>
involved in running complicated raids on the plane of hate, plane of fear,<br/>
vox, and nagafen.  It&#39;s really burning me out though so I&#39;m trying to take<br/>
a step back and chill.  If anyone has any questions about the outer planes<br/>
or the dragons, I might be able to answer them though, so feel free to ask<br/>

As a total asside to EQ, I visited my family this weekend and watched<br/>
&quot;Common Ground&quot;, a nice queer positive little made for TV movie starring<br/>
Johnathen Taylor Thomas and Jason Priestly amongst other people.  I liked<br/>
it a lot. My brother was actually an actor in this with a fairly<br/>
signifigant part, he played a homophobic highschool student who assaulted<br/>
and raped a queer highschool student (JTT).<br/>
