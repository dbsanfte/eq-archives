<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256753794">Saw all the messages posted so far and thought I&#39;d introduce myself too. I&#39;m a<br/>
nice, normal, gay guy who plays a few characters on the Innorruk server (seems<br/>
like everyone else is on other servers). Personally I&#39;ve never had my sexual<br/>
preference come into play in the game (and not being much of a roleplayer<br/>
don&#39;t think it would). I live out in the Philadelphia burbs, late 20something<br/>
and work with computer systems and networks.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone enjoys the game and if you ever pop onto Innorruk feel free to<br/>
say hi.<br/>
<br/>
