<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249526247">I have heard of people camping for the jboot for 6hours a day for over a week <br/>
b4 they got one. The FBR is easy compaired to the boots. Najena almost always <br/>
spawns with it. However she doent alwasy spawn. Sometimes a Elmental spawns <br/>
in her place, and no there is no such thing as Anticamping code. When me and <br/>
My group whent for the robes we tested it out. She spawned just as many times <br/>
when we were on the other side of the water as she did when we were camping <br/>
at her doorstep. That anicamping is a legioned not based on facts. Caused <br/>
because some Npc&#39;s dont always spawn in fact they spawn randomly. so people <br/>
started camping on the other side and poof she disided to show up that <br/>
time... and thus the legioned was born.</div>
