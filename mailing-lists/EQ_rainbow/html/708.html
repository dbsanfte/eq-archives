<div id="ygrps-yiv-504002484">Welp,<br/>
<br/>
	My soundcard FINALLY arrived and I&#39;m all configured to use ROGER WILCO. For<br/>
those of you how don&#39;t have Roger Wilco, this is a WONDERFUL way of SPEAKING<br/>
in your regular voice while gaming! We have used this about a week now and<br/>
more of us are getting on it now. If you want to join our conversation<br/>
(which is VERY lag free) here is the specific IP address we are using :<br/>
216.37.33.36<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t wait to give it a try tonight!<br/>
<br/>
Gypsiee (Sandy)</div>
