&gt;Things are looking good for our guild on E&#39;ci. I just received the<br/>
&gt;following from the GM, Kyala:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I am trying to track down the person with your guild name in game so I<br/>
&gt;&gt;can delete it, and make you the guild leader.  Doing my best, this is one <br/>
&gt;&gt;of those patient battles.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I told her that our people on E&#39;ci would help look for him and petition<br/>
&gt;if we see him. His name is Tarismo. Hopefully it will be soon. Thanks go<br/>
&gt;to Sandy for spotting this in the first place and working hard to help<br/>
&gt;resolve it.<br/>
