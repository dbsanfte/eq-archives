<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696327270">I have still not received any notification from Verant on the status of<br/>
our guild. I think they are a bit backlogged because the new system<br/>
allows guilds to be made more easily, so everyone is making one. I&#39;ll<br/>
keep you posted.<br/>
<br/>
As to the name, maybe we should vote on the following two:<br/>
<br/>
Mystic Alliance<br/>
Force of Synergy<br/>
<br/>
At this point, I&#39;d prefer to limit it to those two.</div>
