<div id="ygrps-yiv-198970419">I agree. The who point is to have fun. I think most get mad because:<br/>
<br/>
1 - THEY didn&#39;t think of it first<br/>
2 - They are in a group where no one has a clue<br/>
3 - They don&#39;t have the imagination to go BEYOND what has been placed<br/>
infront of them.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s MY opinion...<br/>
