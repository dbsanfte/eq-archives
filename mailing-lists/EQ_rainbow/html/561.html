<div id="ygrps-yiv-841003775">Hi, all-<br/>
<br/>
I would be interested in taking over as guild leader on Brell as Ananda (gnome<br/>
cleric). I am sorry to hear that you are leaving the game as I enjoyed our<br/>
short time hunting together, etc. Not to mention, my little cleric could use<br/>
some items as well. Ananda is currently an officer as is Reinbeaux (my<br/>
partner). I also started a halfling warrior by the name of Mylan.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think. Again, I am so sorry to see you go.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Christine<br/>
a/k/a Ananda and Mylan<br/>
<br/>
