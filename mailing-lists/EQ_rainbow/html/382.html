<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912831401">Journeyman&#39;s boots are dropped by Drez-something in Najena.  She is a<br/>
level 24 mob but she is guarded by two necromancers and is generally<br/>
considered a tough tough fight.  I&#39;d say two 29s could take her (at least<br/>
one good bolter in there) but it would be hard.  A full party of 20s<br/>
should be able to take her as well, with possibly a casualty or two.  Once<br/>
you get the room started it&#39;s much easier to hold.  YOu have to wait about<br/>
4 hours to get boots usually.<br/>

&gt; Maybe. Ive not gone to Gukk too many times. I usually play a 16th level<br/>
&gt; female warrior named Jadeeyes so going to Gukk may be a DEATH trap for me!<br/>
&gt; ICK!<br/>
&gt;      I was curious...what level and name is the creature that has the<br/>
&gt; journyman boots? Where are they? Thanks family!<br/>
