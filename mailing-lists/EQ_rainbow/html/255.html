(yeah!!)<br/>
<br/>
what y&#39;all wanna do?<br/>
wanna be hackers? code crackers? slackers<br/>
wastin&#39; time with all the chatroom yakkers?<br/>
9 to 5, chillin&#39; at hewlett packard?<br/>
workin&#39; at a desk with a dumb little plackard?<br/>
yeah, payin&#39; the bills with my mad programming skills<br/>
defraggin&#39; my hard drive for thrills<br/>
i got me a hundred gigabytes of ram<br/>
i never feed trolls and i don&#39;t read spam<br/>
installed a T1 line in my house<br/>
always at my pc, double-clickin&#39; on my mizouse<br/>
upgrade my system at least twice a day<br/>
i&#39;m strictly plug-and-play, i anin&#39;t afraid of Y2K<br/>
i&#39;m down with bill gates, i call him money for short<br/>
i phone him up at home and i make him do my tech support<br/>
it&#39;s all about the pentiums, what?<br/>
you gotta be the dumbest newbie i&#39;ve ever seen<br/>
you&#39;ve got white out all over your screen<br/>
you think your commodore 64 is really neato<br/>
what kinda chip you got in there, a dorito?<br/>
you&#39;re usin&#39; a 286? don&#39;t make me laugh<br/>
your windows boots up in what, a day and a half?<br/>
you could back up your whole hard drive on a floppy diskette<br/>
you&#39;re he biggest joke on the internet<br/>
your database is a disaster<br/>
you&#39;re waxin&#39; you&#39;re modem, tryin&#39; to make it go faster<br/>
hey fella, i bet you&#39;re still livin&#39; in you&#39;re parents&#39; cellar<br/>
downloadin&#39; pictures of sarah michelle gellar<br/>
and postin&#39; &quot;me too!&quot; like some brain-dead AOL-er<br/>
i should do the world a favor and cap you like old yeller<br/>
you&#39;re just about as useless as jpegs to helen keller<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s all about the pentiums!<br/>
it&#39;s all about the pentiums!<br/>
it&#39;s all about the pentiums!<br/>
it&#39;s all about the pentiums!<br/>
<br/>
now, what y&#39;all wanna do?<br/>
wanna bae hackers? code crackers? slackers<br/>
wastin&#39; time with all the chatroom yakkers?<br/>
9 to 5, chillin&#39; at hewlett packard?<br/>
<br/>
uh, uh, loggin&#39; in now<br/>
wanna run wit my crew, hah?<br/>
rule cyberspace and cruch numbers like i do?<br/>
they call me the king of the spreadsheets<br/>
got &#39;em all printed out on my bedsheets<br/>
my new computer&#39;s got the clocks, it rocks<br/>
but it was obsolete before i opened the box<br/>
you say you&#39;ve had your desktop for over a week?<br/>
throw that junk away, it&#39;s an antique!<br/>
your laptop is a month old? well, that&#39;s great<br/>
if you could use a nice, heavy paperweight<br/>
my digital media is write-protected<br/>
every file inspectied, no viruses detected<br/>
i beta tested every operating system<br/>
gave props to some, and others? i dissed &#39;em<br/>
while your computer&#39;s crashin&#39;, mine&#39;s multitasikin&#39;<br/>
it does all my work without me even askin&#39;<br/>
got a flat-screen monitor, 40&quot; wide<br/>
i believe that yours says &quot;etch-a-sketch&quot; on the side<br/>
in a 32-bit world, you&#39;re a 2-bit user<br/>
you&#39;ve got youre own newsgroup, alt.total-loser<br/>
your motherboard melts when you try to send a fax<br/>
where&#39;d you get your cpu, in a box of cracker jacks?<br/>
if i ever meet you i&#39;ll control-alt-delete you<br/>
what?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and now this song is called  &quot;truck drivin&#39; song&quot;<br/>
it is sung in a real butch deep voice, to a country tune<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m drivin&#39; a truck<br/>
drivin&#39; a big ol&#39; truck<br/>
pedal to the metal, hope i don&#39;t run out of luck<br/>
rllin&#39; down the highway until the break of dawn<br/>
drivin&#39; a trick with my high heels on<br/>
<br/>
my diesel rig is northward bound<br/>
it&#39;s time to put that hammer down<br/>
just watchin&#39; as the miles go flyin&#39; by<br/>
i&#39;m ridin&#39; twenty tons of steel<br/>
but it&#39;s sure hard to hold the  wheel<br/>
while i&#39;m still waiting for my nails to dry<br/>
<br/>
oh, i always gotta check my lipstick in that rear view mirror<br/>
and my pick angora sweater fits so tight<br/>
i&#39;m jammin&#39; gears and houlin&#39; freight<br/>
well, i sure hope my seams are straight<br/>
lord, don&#39;t let my mascara run tonight<br/>
<br/>
because i&#39;m drivin&#39; a truck<br/>
drivin&#39; a big ol&#39; truck<br/>
smokey&#39;s on my tail and my accelerator&#39;s stuck<br/>
got these eighteen wheels a-rollin&#39; until the break of dawn<br/>
drivin&#39; a truck with my high heels on<br/>
<br/>
oh, i don&#39;t mind when my crotchless panties creep right up on me<br/>
and my nipple rings don&#39;t bother me too much<br/>
but when i hit those big speed bumps<br/>
my darling little rhinestone pumps<br/>
keep slippin&#39; off the mother-lovin&#39; clutch<br/>
<br/>
but still i&#39;m drivin&#39; a truck<br/>
drivin&#39; a big ol&#39; truck<br/>
headin&#39; down the interstate, just tryin&#39; to make a buck<br/>
wearin&#39; feather boas with sequins and chiffon<br/>
while i&#39;m drivin&#39; a truck with my high heels on<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m drivin&#39; a truck<br/>
drivin&#39; a truck<br/>
got a load to carry and some eyebrows lefrt to pluck<br/>
and i&#39;m late for my appointment down at the hair salon<br/>
so i&#39;ll be drivin&#39; a truck with my high heels on<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
enjoy<br/>
<br/>
