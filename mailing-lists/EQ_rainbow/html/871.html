<div id="ygrps-yiv-132277347">Mystic Alliance has become a rather large and (thanks to some delicious<br/>
idiots trying to stir up trouble that backfired complete) rather well known.<br/>
We have been averaging 15 people at night at any one time.  We have had a<br/>
lot of new people join lately, and hope to keep growing.  :)<br/>
I think we have something like 25 active members currently.  We are trying<br/>
to work up a current members list to figure out how many people we really<br/>
have!<br/>

&gt; &gt;Yes I believe Rodcet is the largest collection of players<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m curious what a &quot;large collection&quot; means in &quot;gay EQ&quot; terms.  I keep<br/>
trying<br/>
&gt; to compare our new guild with the uber-guilds on The Nameless server and<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; course we come up short.  But we usually have around 4 people online, with<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; many as 10.  Last weekend, I think, we grouped with our guildfriends (The<br/>
&gt; Nameless of Mercy) at SolA and we had enough people to completely fill 2<br/>
&gt; party groups.  I think that&#39;s an exceptional headcount for a guild that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; still less than half a year old.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cure my feelings of inadequacy as guildleader.  Tell me we&#39;re doing well<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; the &quot;headcount&quot; test.  Heh.<br/>
