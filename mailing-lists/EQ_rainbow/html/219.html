<b>Subject:</b> Names et al. Long but doing it in one post :) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688543184">Anyway .. random points on previous suggestions:<br/>
- &quot;Order of the Chosen&quot; is even on Brell, my Mage was involved but not key<br/>
- I&#39;d also like to believe the Norrath culture is gay positive, where while<br/>
a minority, subject to discrimination, after all *I* did grow up thinking<br/>
it was all perfectly normal :)  <br/>
- If we don&#39;t vote or have some particapatory (sp?) method of choosing,<br/>
some may feel slighted.  Though of course the eventual one chosen can&#39;t<br/>
possibly be everyones favorite.<br/>
- I agree you should avoid handing the immature element an excuse to<br/>
harrass on a platter.  &lt; Aside: I was subject to two on-line &quot;rapes&quot; in a<br/>
previous MUD - interesting stories, and yes just some dumb kid and emotes,<br/>
but it *does* ruin your evening no matter how much you realize its just<br/>
some dumb kid. Two in six years of on-line RPing is a low rate .. but &gt;<br/>
- I don&#39;t know about some GBLT/other mytical connection angle.  I don&#39;t<br/>
feel any &quot;mystical connection&quot; to the GBLTs in my life, to me they&#39;re just<br/>
family. :P  But perhaps if its explained in the RP as suggested?<br/>
<br/>
And my own general suggestions: <br/>
- After being subjected to the sense of humor in this group in the guild<br/>
chat, perhaps a name with some humor?  The group seemed very good at that!<br/>
&lt;my stomach still hurts!&gt;<br/>
- Perhaps we should add to the charter that you are expected to have fun?<br/>
- As far as a diety Rp angle.  The women seem to have something going with<br/>
Erollisi already &lt;ducks from Christina&gt;, if you read about the dieties<br/>
Quellious seems to be the one most in-line with respect of differences.  So<br/>
for an RP angle, something Quellious oriented maybe? <br/>
- If we assume Norrath accepts all sexual orientations as normal facets of<br/>
life, then *if* you grew up in this world (Norrath), what would a group of<br/>
GBLTs (and friends!) call themselves?  What can we think of here?  The<br/>
message I seem to hear is &quot;We all belong here and together&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
And I was the one with the thesaurus :)  So, going on the humor/joy/gay<br/>
angle which I was asked to last night and trying to choose the simple<br/>
English words with a medieval sound to them ...  Also looked up &quot;group&quot;<br/>
type words .. no luck on synergy.<br/>
<br/>
Group Words: Society, Fellowship, Circle, Ring, Alliance, Voices, Spirits,<br/>
Conclave, Band<br/>
Medieval &quot;Gay&quot; Words: Mirth, Cheer, Felicity, Gambol, Merry<br/>
Other descriptive words suggested: Mystic, Harmony, United (if not unity)<br/>
Force/Soldiers: Force, Champion, Swashbuckler, Guards, Troop, Volunteers,<br/>
Legion, Brigade, Corps, Company, Rabble, Horde, Tribe<br/>
<br/>
Playing mix and match (and trying no to sound too &quot;nice&quot; for the RPers):<br/>
The Merry Horde<br/>
Legion of Mirth<br/>
(well at least descriptive of the rabble in the chat room)<br/>
<br/>
