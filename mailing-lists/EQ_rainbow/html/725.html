<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860086414">Joseph asked why I use Dvorak instead of Qwerty. Hehe -- short <br/>
question, long answer (sorry, I love trivia).<br/>
<br/>
  Qwerty was designed in the days of manual keyboards. The little<br/>
bars would jam if someone typed too fast, so some guy designed a <br/>
keyboard layout that was as inefficient as possible to slow typists <br/>
down & prevent this -- voila, Qwerty. It ended up being the de facto<br/>
standard keyboard layout because this same guy was a great salesman <br/>
who marketed his typewriters to the U.S. Army during WWII. Of course <br/>
the Army bought it in bulk & trained a slew of clerktypists, who then<br/>
knew qwerty when they left the army & went to work for offices after <br/>
the war. All of these offices then bought Qwerty typewriters, & the <br/>
numerous other keyboard layouts that had been in existance pretty<br/>
much all died out (at least in the U.S.).<br/>
<br/>
  Dvorak, on the other hand, was designed for maximum efficiency. The <br/>
Dvorak brothers studied ergonomics (back before the word existed) to <br/>
see which patterns of keystrokes were fastest & easiest to make. They <br/>
then studied the English language to see which 2-letter combinations <br/>
were most common, so that they could set these 2 letters to the <br/>
easiest keystroke combos (i.e. th is very common, so t & h are each<br/>
in a position that makes it very easy to type one right after the<br/>
other). Great engineers, but not very good salesmen, so their<br/>
keyboard never really caught on.<br/>
<br/>
  All of this boils down to the fact that Dvorak is easier to use, <br/>
more efficient, & less tiring for the hands when typing for long <br/>
periods. I  was at about 45 wpm or so when I was using qwerty <br/>
regularly (slower now since I&#39;m rusty). After switching to Dvorak, I <br/>
was matching that speed within about 3 weeks, & had surpassed it in <br/>
another 2 or 3. Since any Windows PC has Dvorak in the keyboard <br/>
settings, you don&#39;t have to worry about buying a special keyboard or <br/>
being unable to type on someone else&#39;s computer. The only problem <br/>
comes in DOS or DOS-based programs -- & EQ.<br/>
