&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok so they finally had a well thought out event, I thought at least. I had<br/>
&gt; the pleasure of joining in on the defenders of High Hold Keep. As I heard of<br/>
&gt; the events, I immediatly went to High Keep to join in the defense guild.<br/>
&gt; &gt;From that point on it was Patrol and take posts and wait..until it began<br/>
&gt; with a whisper in the woods saying &quot;War War...&quot;  They were plenty in number,<br/>
&gt; coming from Neriak through the commons and nektulos. Needless to say I<br/>
&gt; roleplayed this one big time.. I was even able to take down 1 inkie and 1<br/>
&gt; troll that was in the invasion on my own. In the end, I saw Neresei<br/>
&gt; wandering around and sending shouts.. she was a High level Dark Elf PC and<br/>
&gt; was real tough.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There was even a instance of someone casting Ice Comet on a crowd of us..<br/>
&gt; that was devistating. There was plenty of Gm&#39;s involved as there were many<br/>
&gt; NPCs sending out threats .. and as one threat by Neresie told us to give in<br/>
&gt; to Innoruk&#39;s children, I opened up my big mouth and sent a shout telling<br/>
&gt; Neresei that &quot;You fool, your demise will be in the name of Mithaniel Marr&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Well that was a mistake lol as she and her generals sent shouts speaking of<br/>
&gt; my bones as they needed them... They were after me. Well I was by riverdale<br/>
&gt; and with a group of us attempting to defend riverdale.. Next thing I knew we<br/>
&gt; were swarmed and I was prime target.. they tore me to shreds.. with one<br/>
&gt; final shout I claimed &quot;my death was not in vain for the light shall<br/>
&gt; prevail&quot;. &quot;Loading Please Wait..&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So upon corpse retrieval.. I went to get my body and rest in riverdale, by<br/>
&gt; that time Riverdale was taken over by them... Thats all I know as I had to<br/>
&gt; camp for the evening..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This was truly a great event IMHO.. I do feel bad for all the people that<br/>
&gt; lost levels due to this.. but hey I didn&#39;t mind the exp loss at such a fun<br/>
&gt; price..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How did the raids go on your servers ? I heard they were server wide. Im<br/>
&gt; curious to see if they actually took over High Keep.<br/>
