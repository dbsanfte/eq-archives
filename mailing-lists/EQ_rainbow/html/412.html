<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065089904">If someone on E&#39;ci had the Mystical Alliance tag over his head, then something<br/>
is not right. I have not even gotten onto that server yet to get the guild set<br/>
up. Are you sure it said Mystical Alliance?<br/>
<br/>
Currently, we are official on only Brell Serilis. I am spending many hours<br/>
online on Innoruuk and also Xegony trying find a GM online to set up our guild<br/>
tags. So far, no luck. Hopefully, I can get at least one of the servers set up<br/>
tonight. I will wander around between the 2 above and Bristlebane, Veeshan and<br/>
E&#39;ci till I see one with a GM and then /petition.<br/>
<br/>
Please verify if someone on E&#39;ci has our guild tag over his head, because that<br/>
is a mistake if he does.<br/>

&gt;      Who is a guild member on E&#39;ci ? I expected either myself or Marlys to<br/>
&gt; be contacted about it. Ran into someone name Aligrate or some such last<br/>
&gt; night who had our logo above his head. But he was no help, said there was<br/>
&gt; someone else I needed to talk to about the guild. Help!<br/>
