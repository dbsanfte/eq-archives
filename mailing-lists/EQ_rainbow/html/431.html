<div id="ygrps-yiv-686265281">Also it is listed in the terms of agreement somewhere that &quot;Hate Harassment&quot; is<br/>
grounds for immediately being banned from the game.  I remember I noticed this<br/>
because it listed harassment because of sexual orientation.  Apparently that was<br/>
just Verant blowing smoke trying to make itself look good.  Also when you make a<br/>
guild it is universal, that guide was on crack.  Sorry but Im pissed, things like<br/>
this is what makes me wish we had an organization in our community comparable to<br/>
the Black Panthers, nuff said.<br/>

&gt; Whoever you spoke to at Verant cannot possibly know what they are talking<br/>
&gt; about. When we got guild approval, after I wrote and then revised a charter, it<br/>
&gt; was not based on any specific server. I know that the names of the guilds are<br/>
&gt; universal, because otherwise, we could have used the &quot;Unity&quot; name that someone<br/>
&gt; else had, unless we were on the same server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have emailed verant last night and not received a reply yet. I will let<br/>
&gt; everyone know when I do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If this matter is not resolved the way I think it should be, that will be the<br/>
&gt; last straw for me and EQ will be uninstalled and I&#39;ll save $10 per month.<br/>
