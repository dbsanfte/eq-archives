<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-68117250">mabey we should advertise our guild on guildvault.com? it is a good<br/>
place to register your guild and your characters, becasue if you set up<br/>
a guild event every one who has registerd a character for that server<br/>
will be notified just a thought i have a few of my characters regesterd<br/>
there it is a handy sight</div>
