<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711297370">Okay question: I am going to start a new character being that mine is<br/>
becoming kinda blah.. I still am going to play him regularly.. but I want to<br/>
have a side character to play when my main character gets bored.. I also<br/>
want to twink the hell outa my newbie.. so.. I am looking for suggestions..<br/>
at this point, I am playing a Mage .. and am looking to the ways of the<br/>
Paladin, Druid or Ranger or cleric. I am gearing towards the Druid, because<br/>
the cool ability to Teleport around later... Has anyone played a druid<br/>
successfully even after the apparent nerfing of  their Kiting ability ? <br/>
