<b>Subject:</b> Details of Meeting Tonight in Chat <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135821380">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Since we have new people and some may have missed a few of the earlier<br/>
posts, I will summarize what we&#39;ve got going on tonight.<br/>
<br/>
We are hoping to get 10 or more people on chat tonight to use the new<br/>
automated guild formation procedure. The guild will originally start out on<br/>
Brell Serilis, the new role playing server where many members of the list<br/>
have now created characters and started over.<br/>
<br/>
The chat channel will be &quot;Unity&quot; and the password will be &quot;rainbow&quot; in all<br/>
lower case. We hope to meet at<br/>
9:30 PM EDT = 8:30 PM CDT = 7:30 PM MDT = 6:30 PM PDT.<br/>
<br/>
We must get 10 people into the chat room/channel at the same time and must<br/>
all type<br/>
#guildapprove (I think that&#39;s what we type but will verify before the<br/>
meeting).<br/>
<br/>
You will have to stay in the room until we get all 10. We have quite a few<br/>
who are going to be on so it should not be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
After that, we will wait for (hopefully) about a week to become an official<br/>
guild on Brell. We strongly encourage people to play on Brell as we will be<br/>
trying to make it the &#39;San Francisco&#39; server of EQ. However, we realize that<br/>
some people will not want to give up their characters and their friends on<br/>
old servers. (Note: Some time soon, there is supposed to be a quest that<br/>
will allow you to move your characters to another server. We will certainly<br/>
post details when we get them.) We expect we will be able to open other<br/>
chapters of the guild on the various servers, even though we strongly<br/>
encourage people to put at least some time into playing on Brell.<br/>
<br/>
I have given up all my playing time on Veeshan and don&#39;t really miss it<br/>
(even though I was just 5.1 bubbles of XP away from having Bind). I just<br/>
created a new character completely different from my old one (from a cleric,<br/>
I am now a Necro--quite a contrast).<br/>
<br/>
Because no one else stepped forward (in fact I think you all tool a step<br/>
backwards), I became the guild master by default. I would really like to<br/>
have a co-leader and would like the co-leader to be female IRL so we have a<br/>
balanced guild, genderwise. The last thing the world needs (even the world<br/>
of Norath) is another male dominated power structure. So, please, some woman<br/>
volunteer... no experience necessary... I certainly don&#39;t have any<br/>
experience running a guild, so don&#39;t be intimidated.<br/>
<br/>
Some ideas I would like to throw out:<br/>
One person suggested a longer name than just &#39;Unity&#39;. Like &#39;Citizens of<br/>
Unity&#39;. I&#39;ve seen no feedback yet. So, either send your ideas to the mailing<br/>
list, or bring them up tonight. If you can&#39;t be there tonight, please send<br/>
email now so your voice can be heard.<br/>
<br/>
I have drafted a couple of paragraphs of a fictional history of the guild<br/>
and will post to the list soon. I&#39;d like for others to edit and/or augment<br/>
it and then post back the modified version so someone else can do the same<br/>
thing again. This way anyone who wants to can contribute to the fictional<br/>
history of the guild. Does this sound like it would be a good idea (and<br/>
hopefully fun too)? If so, then I will post the lame stuff I have written so<br/>
far or someone else can create one from scratch.<br/>
<br/>
What other activities do we want the guild to do? Do we want to have a<br/>
treasury that can be used for loans? Do we want to collect old items and use<br/>
them as hand-me-downs to the lower level players? Do we have volunteers to<br/>
do these things?<br/>
<br/>
These are just a few of the things we can discuss tonight, but sometimes<br/>
doing it in email ahead of time is easier.<br/>
<br/>
I also painstakingly researched the many postings to this list to create an<br/>
HTML file that lists the people and characters as well as the servers we all<br/>
have characters on. Our EQ_Rainbow list does not allow attachments so I<br/>
can&#39;t post it to the list. If you would like a copy, let me know and I will<br/>
email it directly to your email address, bypassing OneList. The file is just<br/>
HTML and there are no viruses in it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting really excited by this now. It would be enough just to be in a<br/>
guild, but a guild filled with LGBT and friendly allies is even better.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to all,<br/>

aka Dedric, 6th level gnome necro on Brell Serilis server.</div>
