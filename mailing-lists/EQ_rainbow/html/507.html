<br/>
The guild on Rodcet Nife is growing!  we are 7 now woohoo!<br/>
<br/>
David...when you guilded Genesius on Rodcet did you make him and officer or<br/>
leader?  It seems as though he is not leader, it would be good to make him<br/>
or me leader so we can start a command structure in the rodcet nife guild ;)<br/>
<br/>
I have a suggestion:  we should make up a short description of the guild for<br/>
poele who ask what our guild is about, then we can make it a hot button!!!<br/>
<br/>
What is the URL wor the Mystic Alliance website?<br/>
<br/>
I ahve a proposal for a guild event.  How about a big lottery for publicity?<br/>
I ahve it all worked out in my head as to how we could run it.  Big fun.  we<br/>
would need at leats 1 person on each server in the guild to commit to it, we<br/>
can deicde a time and iron out the kinks.  anyonw think this is a good<br/>
idea??  ehhe verye five minutes we could press our guild hotbutton for<br/>
publicity :)  or make a special hot button just for the occasion!<br/>
<br/>
Hope eveyrone is doing well?  how is the guild doing on other servers?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone on Rodcet Nife need to be guilded???  Nate, make a new chatchter! :)<br/>
