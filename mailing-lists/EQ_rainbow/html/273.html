<div id="ygrps-yiv-622652267">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
Good news, our guild is approved. Soon, members of the Mystic Alliance will be wandering the world of Norrath. Unfortunately, it will take me awhile to get the<br/>
various chapters established on the servers that we need. I will be out of town Aug. 7 -14 (argh! a whole week without EQ) but on Sunday the 15th, I hope to get<br/>
the chapters set up.<br/>
<br/>
I will be the guildmaster on Brell Serillis, but I will need others to do the same on the other servers. I know several of you have mentioned you&#39;d be willing to<br/>
do it, so please tell me again if you want to do it, and let me know which server.<br/>
<br/>
I will attempt to get as many set up on Sunday the 15th, as I can.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
David<br/>
