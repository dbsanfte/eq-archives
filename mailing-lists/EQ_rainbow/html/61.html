<b>Subject:</b> Getting a GUILD up and going... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-548050110">I think getting a GUILD started is a GREAT idea...however...some of us are<br/>
on different servers. We need unification..yes..I looked that word up just<br/>
for this occasion! Lets start by saying what server we are all currently<br/>
on, which character we play the MOST and go from there. The ONLY problem I<br/>
see is that we may have to play our favorite character half time while we<br/>
play our &#39;GUILD&#39; character the other half. SHAME we cant transfer<br/>
characters from server to server..sigh. Give me some feedbaack FOLKS! HUGS!<br/>
