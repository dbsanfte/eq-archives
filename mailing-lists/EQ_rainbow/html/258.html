<br/>
     We can use all the help and friends we can get! Come over to E&#39;ci and<br/>
I&#39;ll buy you a town..um..beer...haha! Im Sandy (me a man) ! I play a Wood<br/>
Elf warrior (Female) named Jadeeyes, who has had the misfortune of grouping<br/>
with all the wrong people! My 15th levels slips between 14th and 15th so<br/>
often I feel like a YO YO! ARGH!<br/>
     It seems too quiet today for SOME REASON and Im glad you spoke up and<br/>
said HELLO!<br/>
<br/>
Take care now!<br/>
