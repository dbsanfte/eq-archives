<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053735469">if it works, don&#39;t knock it..<br/>
<br/>
i haven&#39;t had much time to play in the past few weeks (summer here and all..<br/>
who wants to stay inside and EQ?).. i found one place to hang out to and went<br/>
from 12 to 18 in 4 days.. no one pointed their finger at me and called me a<br/>
bad boy.<br/>
<br/>
some people knock power levelling, some people only power level. as long as<br/>
you can sleep at night, don&#39;t worry about it..<br/>
<br/>
js</div>
