<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119173192">I&#39;m fine with this story.  I don&#39;t see the need for us to be outcasts<br/>
though.  I personally prefer to assume that Norathian culture is generally<br/>
accepting of diverse sexual orientation, and that players who express<br/>
otherwise are members of some strange minority.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I would like to see in terms of roleplay is that GLBT and<br/>
positive people share a kind of bond that is manifests itself as a<br/>
tangible spiritual connection.  Something along the lines of us all coming<br/>
together because we had this connection, and could sense it in eachother.<br/>
Kind of a mystic gaydar 8) I like it because this implies a reason for us<br/>
to exist in an organization beyond combating homophobia (which implies<br/>
homophobia is a force requiring an organization to combat).<br/>
