&gt; I am still working to resolve the E&#39;ci guild issue. I have not received a<br/>
reply<br/>
&gt; from my email to Kyala, so I sent a message to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqguilds@...">eqguilds@...</a> this<br/>
morning<br/>
&gt; explaining what I think the problem is. Until I get information from<br/>
Verant, I<br/>
&gt; will not be able to get the guild set up on other servers and there is a<br/>
&gt; possibility we may have to recreate the guild on Brell. Hopefully, someone<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; Verant will get back to me soon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here is my theory about what has happened. When I created our guild, I<br/>
&gt; submitted the name as &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot;. When I went onto Brell to get the<br/>
&gt; guild tags, I noticed that the name was &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; (note the<br/>
&gt; difference MysticAL instead of Mystic). I honestly couldn&#39;t remember what<br/>
name<br/>
&gt; was the correct one and thought that maybe I either requested Mystical or<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; they made a typo and just changed it to Mystical, but I never gave it any<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; thought.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then, weeks later we discover the name &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; is in use on<br/>
E&#39;ci.<br/>
&gt; So, I think what may have happened is that there is a guild called<br/>
&quot;Mystical<br/>
&gt; Alliance&quot; and another, ours, called &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; and that the guild<br/>
GM on<br/>
&gt; Brell gave me the wrong one. However, so far, I have not received a reply<br/>
to my<br/>
&gt; inquiries.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Because we may have the wrong guild, I don&#39;t want to set it up on anymore<br/>
&gt; servers until I find out what is going on, since the solution may involve<br/>
doing<br/>
&gt; a &#39;guilddelete&#39; and getting it recreated by a GM again with the correct<br/>
name.<br/>
&gt; So, be warned, if you are in the guild on Brell, we may have to start over<br/>
&gt; again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the meantime, if any of you happen to be on any server and see a real<br/>
GM<br/>
&gt; (not a guild or apprentice, etc.) you may wish to ask them about this<br/>
issue. If<br/>
&gt; they need to know what my station ID is to help clear up the mystery, it<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &quot;LARIDJ&quot;, my last name and first and middle initials. Ask them if they<br/>
show a<br/>
&gt; guild by the name of &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; or &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; as belonging<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; that station ID. If you find out, post info to the list and/or tell me<br/>
(Dedric)<br/>
&gt; on Brell in game. (If you tell me in game, I will also try to get over to<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; server right fast and set it up with whatever name it really is.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll let you all know when I find something out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hugs,<br/>
