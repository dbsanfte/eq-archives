<br/>
  We have room for any race/class combos -- & I especially LOVE <br/>
clerics (I sort of became the official Guild Corpse during my early <br/>
teens, but I&#39;m almost 17th now & haven&#39;t died more than once per<br/>
level for the last 2 levels -- woo-hoo!).<br/>
<br/>
  Yeah, leaving other characters can be hard. I left 2 on Brell -- <br/>
only 6th each, but a lot of rp storyline built up in them. However, I <br/>
haven&#39;t regretted it a bit! You could also split your time -- I have<br/>
a RL friend who has a level 51 on another server, & he plays that 1 <br/>
still, as well as a couple on RN.<br/>
<br/>
  So... come on! The more the merrier!<br/>

&gt; Greetings:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just found out about EQ Rainbow through a long and contentious <br/>
thread<br/>
&gt; started on an Everquest newsgroup. My first response to hearing <br/>
about EQ<br/>
&gt; Rainbow made me laugh out loud: &quot;My God, there are others like me <br/>
out<br/>
&gt; there!&quot; I had wondered if there were any other gay/lesbian players<br/>
&gt; around (I certainly hadn&#39;t met them).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am Vince Bowes, a Branch Supervisor of a public library in <br/>
Toronto,<br/>
&gt; Canada. I&#39;ve been playing EQ off and on for about eight months. I <br/>
have<br/>
&gt; two characters I play frequently on the Tribunal server, but I am<br/>
&gt; strongly considering ending them and starting over on the RN server<br/>
&gt; because I am really curious about the Mystic Alliance...but it will <br/>
be<br/>
&gt; hard to drop my level 17 druid, Kestrelle. But it would be <br/>
worthwhile to<br/>
&gt; talk to other gay players and be part of a truly &#39;open&#39; guild. Are <br/>
there<br/>
&gt; any openings for a high elf cleric in the ranks? That&#39;s a class/race<br/>
&gt; combo I have been eager to try for some time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cya in Norrath folks! </span></blockquote></div>
