<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489303376">Anyone know where to obtain the Ice crystal Staff ? I have the water<br/>
crystal, but I think I want a little variety ya know. I have only seen<br/>
people that have the water crystal and no one seems to have the Ice Crystal.<br/>
I am in permafrost, I thought the preacher has it on him but so far no luck.<br/>
<br/>
Any info would be awesome because Im on a mission...</div>
