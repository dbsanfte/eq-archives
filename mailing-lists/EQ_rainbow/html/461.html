<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058770263">I am still working to resolve the E&#39;ci guild issue. I have not received a reply<br/>
from my email to Kyala, so I sent a message to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqguilds@...">eqguilds@...</a> this morning<br/>
explaining what I think the problem is. Until I get information from Verant, I<br/>
will not be able to get the guild set up on other servers and there is a<br/>
possibility we may have to recreate the guild on Brell. Hopefully, someone from<br/>
Verant will get back to me soon.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my theory about what has happened. When I created our guild, I<br/>
submitted the name as &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot;. When I went onto Brell to get the<br/>
guild tags, I noticed that the name was &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; (note the<br/>
difference MysticAL instead of Mystic). I honestly couldn&#39;t remember what name<br/>
was the correct one and thought that maybe I either requested Mystical or that<br/>
they made a typo and just changed it to Mystical, but I never gave it any more<br/>
thought.<br/>
<br/>
Then, weeks later we discover the name &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; is in use on E&#39;ci.<br/>
So, I think what may have happened is that there is a guild called &quot;Mystical<br/>
Alliance&quot; and another, ours, called &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; and that the guild GM on<br/>
Brell gave me the wrong one. However, so far, I have not received a reply to my<br/>
inquiries.<br/>
<br/>
Because we may have the wrong guild, I don&#39;t want to set it up on anymore<br/>
servers until I find out what is going on, since the solution may involve doing<br/>
a &#39;guilddelete&#39; and getting it recreated by a GM again with the correct name.<br/>
So, be warned, if you are in the guild on Brell, we may have to start over<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, if any of you happen to be on any server and see a real GM<br/>
(not a guild or apprentice, etc.) you may wish to ask them about this issue. If<br/>
they need to know what my station ID is to help clear up the mystery, it is<br/>
&quot;LARIDJ&quot;, my last name and first and middle initials. Ask them if they show a<br/>
guild by the name of &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; or &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; as belonging to<br/>
that station ID. If you find out, post info to the list and/or tell me (Dedric)<br/>
on Brell in game. (If you tell me in game, I will also try to get over to your<br/>
server right fast and set it up with whatever name it really is.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll let you all know when I find something out.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
