<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369357884">There are a couple advantages of magical armors (netted, mesh, rubicite,<br/>
etc).  They do weight less (you know that one).  Also, anything worn that&#39;s<br/>
magical can generally be worn by all sizes (magic stuff is sort of<br/>
one-size-fits-all).  Also, magical gloves and magical boots allow you to<br/>
punch and kick creatures that can be hit by magical attacks only, like<br/>
willowisps (very nice for monks).  However, a full set of magical armor<br/>
won&#39;t make you hittable only by magical weapons ;)<br/>

&gt; Hi i was curious if I ask the occasional hints if thats ok here or if you<br/>
&gt; all want me to ask elsewhere on another board?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyhow here is my question.. What is the usage of  equipment that is magic<br/>
&gt; and has the same AC or +1 ac more than non magical equipment, eg.<br/>
&gt; netted or<br/>
&gt; mesh other than having the item weigh less ? reason i am asking .. If you<br/>
&gt; are fully equiped to the gills with magic items is it possible<br/>
&gt; that you are<br/>
&gt; considered a magic being and therefore you can&#39;t be hit by non magic melee<br/>
&gt; type weapons ? or is it just the weight issue that makes magic<br/>
&gt; items with no<br/>
&gt; bonuses better ? Well I guess that could create game inbalance then, too<br/>
&gt; many would quest for the magic stuff to become semi invincible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So anyone here high level and been to either the HATE PLANE or the FEAR<br/>
&gt; PLANE ? I am very curious to hear of any stories on the planes..<br/>
&gt; That seems<br/>
&gt; to be my drive ingame to get high enough to go with a party to the planes<br/>
&gt; and see what they have to offer. did ya all like the warning they<br/>
&gt; gave about<br/>
&gt; hate ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Nife :o)<br/>
