<div id="ygrps-yiv-803831976">Hey David,<br/>
<br/>
Looks like you have the job! Now lets make this guild so we can all play<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
The way guilds are currently made is:<br/>
    - everyone logs into the chat server<br/>
    - guildmaster issues a #makeguild command to create a chat room for<br/>
      the guild.  Everyone else already knows a password for the guild<br/>
      (it&#39;s been posted to this list).<br/>
    - everyone joins the chat room.  Everyone in the chat room types<br/>
      some command to say they approve of the guild.<br/>
    - once ten people say they approve, the guild master types in a<br/>
      description of the guild.  They we just wait for approval from the<br/>
      GMs.<br/>
<br/>
As guildmaster, I think it would be fine if you selected the guild name<br/>
based on our conversation on this list about what we would like in a guild<br/>
name.  The next step would be for you to declare a time for us all to log<br/>
into the chat server to approve the guild.  Any evening should probably be<br/>
fine, we only need ten people to get it approved.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to this guild, it should be a lot of fun. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll mention now as well that my character, Luna, just made master smith<br/>
last night.  If you need banded on Brell Serelis, say you&#39;re from<br/>
EQ_rainbow and I will give you a huge discount (only on stuff for your<br/>
character please).<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Christina,<br/>
&gt; Great ideas. I would volunteer to be the guild master and if no one else does,<br/>
&gt; I will, but I am concerned that I won&#39;t have the time to give it what it<br/>
&gt; deserves... doing too much volunteering in RL as it is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, since I think I was one of the ones who first suggested moving to<br/>
&gt; Brell S. server, I have created several characters as &#39;name holders&#39; there,<br/>
&gt; but have not played them yet. I think the idea of designated times to play<br/>
&gt; there is great.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Layf, Human Cleric (will be lvl 13 tonight) on Veeshan.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PS: Veeshan people, give me a tell. I&#39;&#39;l be on all evening from about 6pm EDT<br/>
&gt; till 11pm.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi I&#39;m Christina, and I started this list, and to quote Big Gay Al, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think it&#39;s just SUPER that so many people have joined recently 8)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Regarding the guild, I think it would be a great idea to have it on Brell<br/>
&gt; &gt; Serelis.  You have to start some where new to make things fair for<br/>
&gt; &gt; everyone.  I have a 9th level enchanter on Brell.  I have been power<br/>
&gt; &gt; leveling.  Her name is Luna.  I also have a 30th level druid on Mithanial<br/>
&gt; &gt; Marr named Iuna.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Some people are concerned about leaving their servers.  Don&#39;t! My<br/>
&gt; &gt; suggestion is that we have two official guild adventuring times (i.e.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thursday evenings, and Sunday afternoons).  That way you can play on Brell<br/>
&gt; &gt; during those times to hang out with your amazing queer guild friends.  You<br/>
&gt; &gt; can play on the other server othe times.  The bigest benefit of course is<br/>
&gt; &gt; that when one of those servers goes down, you won&#39;t be spending hours<br/>
&gt; &gt; staring at the server list waiting for your one server to come back!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I just created a guild on Brell for my other mailing list, EQ_women.  It<br/>
&gt; &gt; was pretty easy, and I was approved within 24 hours.  The guild is called<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sisterhood of Erollisi.  I don&#39;t want to be guildmaster of two guilds<br/>
&gt; &gt; though, so I hope that someone else will volunteer to run the queer guild.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As for the name of the guild, instead of a subtle &quot;hey does that mean<br/>
&gt; &gt; queer?&quot; name, I personally like a name that is symbolic of who we are.<br/>
&gt; &gt; How about &quot;Unity&quot;.  It&#39;s short, it&#39;s simple, and I think being unified is<br/>
&gt; &gt; a great general concept for us to present, as gay lesbian bisexual<br/>
&gt; &gt; transgendered and supportive straight people.  I&#39;d suggest calling us<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Rainbow&quot; but lets face it, that sounds silly for a guild name.  Anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; else have any ideas?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There is obviously interest in a guild, so I&#39;d really like to see one get<br/>
&gt; &gt; made.  It&#39;s hard in an environment like this to really elect or appoint<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone to run a guild.  So, what I&#39;d like to suggest is that if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; willing to be the guildmaster please reply to this email to the list and<br/>
&gt; &gt; say &quot;I&#39;m willing to run the guild&quot;.  Also list three reasons why you think<br/>
&gt; &gt; you&#39;d be good at running the guild (i.e. previous experience, no social<br/>
&gt; &gt; life).  Rather than have a vote which doesn&#39;t make much sense when we<br/>
&gt; &gt; really barely know eachother, if everyone is ok I&#39;ll just pick one of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; people to do it.  Really running a guild isn&#39;t that big a thing, you just<br/>
&gt; &gt; have administrative duties, the most important thing is that you&#39;ll play a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lot on the server.  The important thing is that we get the guild going.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I must get to sleep, good night!<br/>
