<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079390993">One thing a lot of people don&#39;t know about shamans is that their 1st level<br/>
spell inner fire is a super-heal.  For 10 mana it heals 20 hp.  This is as<br/>
efficient as greater healing which they get at level 29.<br/>
<br/>
Shamans can supposedly level to 20 just by tanking and healing themselves<br/>
after the fight with inner fire.<br/>

&gt; I think they&#39;re pretty cute too. And I already made my shaman. (and a necro<br/>
&gt; and a monk) The shaman without spells survived much much better killing the<br/>
&gt; same type of critter then the monk. The necro, well we won&#39;t talk about that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Roumor I heard about the lizzy monk is that instead of dragon punch at 20<br/>
&gt; or 25 or whatever, they get tail sweep. ;-p I wanna see that!<br/>

&gt; Ok, this might just be a rant, but since it&#39;s non hostile I&#39;m going to post<br/>
&gt; it here =) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; WOW Iksar are so cute. The first time I ever saw one I was like...oh my<br/>
&gt; gosh! It walks around and swings its little tail and talks and everything!<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s like the best pet! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And Kunark is very pretty. Lots of fun new zones, with cool looking<br/>
&gt; critters. It&#39;s pretty obvious to me you could hunt in Kunark and never<br/>
&gt; leave, and get all the way to 50. It seems a self sufficient continent. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kunark is dangerous though, I have talked to a lot of people who brought<br/>
&gt; their mains over and got stomped by something. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The solution to all this is...make an Iksar shaman! You get SOW at 9th<br/>
&gt; level and you can explore like crazy. Team up with a friend and make an<br/>
&gt; Iksar monk, and you have a great 2-person leveling/exploring team<br/>
&gt; especially for low levels. FYI Iksar have regeneration, and the highest wis<br/>
&gt; of the shaman races, making them the best shaman and monk races IMHO<br/>
&gt; (though they aren&#39;t as cute as Duna). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Rumor: Iksar do not get the inherent haste that human monks get at level<br/>
&gt; 20+) <br/>
