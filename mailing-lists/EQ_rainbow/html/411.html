<div id="ygrps-yiv-231605329">Who is a guild member on E&#39;ci ? I expected either myself or Marlys to<br/>
be contacted about it. Ran into someone name Aligrate or some such last<br/>
night who had our logo above his head. But he was no help, said there was<br/>
someone else I needed to talk to about the guild. Help!<br/>
