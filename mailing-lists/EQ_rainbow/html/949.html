<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544961973">I believe they got jealous of Asheron&#39;s Call... (ya know the OTHER MMORPG)<br/>
about 6 months ago... Turbine cratered several cities. Totally and<br/>
completely nuked them as part of the story line.  Funny stuff like turning<br/>
the resident cow into a cow corpse .... complete with a swarm of flies and<br/>
such.<br/>
<br/>
VI does some odd things... I wouldn&#39;t put it past them.   I mean.... they<br/>
STILL don&#39;t provide anything remotely like customer service and we STILL pay<br/>
them every month.  Maybe they&#39;re going to push the envelope and see what<br/>
they can get away with.<br/>
<br/>
I for one resent them blocking off the Barbarians.   Who am I going to stare<br/>
at? &lt;sheesh&gt;<br/>
