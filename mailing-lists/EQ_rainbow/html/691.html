<div id="ygrps-yiv-775149892">Hello all!<br/>
<br/>
	I just wanted to tell you about my morning and about a very irritating<br/>
person in Rodcet Nife. Today I entered Crush Bone right after a nasty train<br/>
had chased me out. I came upon a TROLL (His name is/was Bezerker) who con&#39;d<br/>
green to me (He was ALSO very twinked..FULL Crafted..Exe. Axe etc. ) and was<br/>
be being hit on by a lowly GREEN orc. Needless to say we all know the woes<br/>
of trying to loot while having something hit us..we don&#39;t like it. SO, I<br/>
kill the greeny orc. Bezerker THEN curses me out for being a KS&#39;er and says<br/>
he has reported me. I was STUNNED! I spoke with him a few moments to assure<br/>
him of my good intent but he would have none of it. Upon exiting CB I saw<br/>
him in a duel with another PC. The PC won and I applauded. The Bezerker<br/>
person was apparently not to bright because he was BOUND in G Fay and had<br/>
died numerous times. I was impressed to see that he undone himself by dying<br/>
too much. Upon getting killed ONCE more by Orcs, his TWINKED body<br/>
Decayed...EVERYTHING he had on him was GONE** POOF**. I know now that there<br/>
is a goddess and she loves me :)<br/>
<br/>
Signed,<br/>
