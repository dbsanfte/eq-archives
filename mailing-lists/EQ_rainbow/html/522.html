<b>Subject:</b> I&#39;m getting married! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020029913">I never thought I would get married in EQ, but I am, and I&#39;m actually<br/>
really excited.  This is on Brell Serelis with Luna my 50th level<br/>
enchanter.  She will be marrying Duna, a 45th level monk.<br/>
<br/>
A while ago I posted to the list about Duna, basicly lamenting the fact I<br/>
had a crush on her and I was sure she was a straight girl.  Well, she&#39;s<br/>
not as straight as I thought.  Since that time we&#39;ve slowly developed an<br/>
online relationship (another first for me), and I guess the culmination of<br/>
that relationship is our characters getting married.<br/>
<br/>
This has proved very interesting to me from a queer coming out<br/>
perspective.  Our characters have been dating for a while now, but they&#39;ve<br/>
both been in the closet so to speak.  I was fairly comfortable with this<br/>
arrangement, but Duna decided at some point that we should get married.<br/>
Well, I&#39;d actually already proposed to her, but I didn&#39;t think she&#39;d say<br/>
yes.  Since then she&#39;s been coming out to people somewhat randomly.  We&#39;ve<br/>
started /em&#39;ing kissing eachother in public.  So far, no negative<br/>
reactions.  Most people think we&#39;re joking around I think though.  I<br/>
really don&#39;t know how things are going to go in the long run.  This all<br/>
only happened last evening.<br/>
<br/>
Duna is very brave about all this, I think she may also not entirely know<br/>
what she&#39;s getting into.  She&#39;s quite young (16), and doesn&#39;t seem to have<br/>
a lot of experience with queer stuff, and accordingly has none of the fear<br/>
I have associated with coming out.  I think its amazing she wants to do<br/>
all this, I want to do it too, but I would never have dreamed of<br/>
suggesting it to her.<br/>
<br/>
The final details of the wedding have not been set.  There has been some<br/>
talk of having it in the throne room of King Tranix the fire giant, which<br/>
would limit attendence to those level 40+.  We may have it in a more<br/>
mundane location.  Regardless, I will let everyone know, and if you can<br/>
attend I would love you all to attend.<br/>
