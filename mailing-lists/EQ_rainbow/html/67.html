<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771944690">Personally I think the idea of broadminded straight people taking an<br/>
interest in the goings on of this list is great, especially if they are as<br/>
supportive as you.<br/>

&gt; Hello! With the new server and possible gatherings I thought I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; introduce.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; About the only thing that may take more guts than admitting your gay on<br/>
&gt; a straight list is admitting your straight on a gay list.  I am a<br/>
straight,<br/>
&gt; however, (no I&#39;m not about to say &quot;but I have a gay friend&quot; pppt!) ... I<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; raised by two gay males after my father died when I was quite young.<br/>
&gt; Actually,<br/>
&gt; since he was bedridden when I was a toddler, they had stepped into that<br/>
role<br/>
&gt; starting when I was 2-3 years old.  There were two other couples who also<br/>
&gt; helped, known as four more &quot;Uncles&quot; to me.  So they were my functional<br/>
father<br/>
&gt; figures as long as I can rememeber, also called &quot;Uncles&quot;.  I followed in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; professional footsteps of one (and he helped put me through college), and<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; main hobby follows the heart and profession of the other.  So &quot;I was<br/>
raised<br/>
&gt; by gays, but I&#39;m straight&quot; *is* an uncomfortable thing to say in the<br/>
straight<br/>
&gt; community.  Why do they peer at you and go &quot;Are you sure?&quot;? (grrr)<br/>
&gt; Fortunately<br/>
&gt; most aquaintences never questioned why I had eight &quot;Uncles&quot;, and only two<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; related (my mother does have two brothers). :) Anyway, that&#39;s why I joined<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; list.  Its as much &quot;home&quot; for me as any other group mailing list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got characters on Erollisi & just strarted on Brell.  I&#39;ve RPed a bit<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; my characters are often different and some are a bit goofy, some are<br/>
&gt; goody-two-<br/>
&gt; shoes, some are dark and evil (cackles!).  If I&#39;m not &quot;egged&quot; or &quot;rotten<br/>
&gt; tomatoed&quot;,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll put up the list .. I&#39;d love to find others to group with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
