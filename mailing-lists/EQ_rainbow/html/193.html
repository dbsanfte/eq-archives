Hey! That&#39;s no fair. I was composing almost exactly these same thoughts when<br/>
this arrived in my mailbox :)  I agree with all that you said. The challenge<br/>
is to meet all the criteria you listed and still not be bland.<br/>
<br/>
How about the &lt;Unified Alliance of United Allies&gt;... Uh, just kidding.<br/>
<br/>
In your other message, the name &lt;We Are Everywhere&gt; is starting to grow on me.<br/>
It is different, which I like. It is mysterious...It is a phrase we GLBT<br/>
people use. I&#39;m really starting to like it since &lt;The Chosen&gt; is already<br/>
chosen by another group.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, my favorite name is &lt;The Minions of Dedric&gt;. Not that I&#39;m letting<br/>
being the guild master go to my head or anything. I&#39;m sure that POWER is not<br/>
corrupting me. And completely unrelated, you shall now all refer to me as<br/>
Supreme Master of All in future postings. hehe.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d just like to say some more things about the guild name, based on my<br/>
&gt; observation of our discussion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is concern that the guild name will look appropriate for any race<br/>
&gt; and class.  I.E. a troll shadowknight might not like &quot;order of the pink<br/>
&gt; bunnies&quot; and a high elf paladin might not like &quot;defilers of the<br/>
&gt; light&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People don&#39;t seem to want a guild with gay or lesbian or any other direct<br/>
&gt; sexual orientation reference in it, to avoid harassment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most seem fine with an implied indirect reference.  However, I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think there has been an implied indirect reference that has really held up<br/>
&gt; well.  Some people feel that an implied or indirect reference should be<br/>
&gt; part of our name.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some people don&#39;t like latin, some people do.  Some people want to use<br/>
&gt; words that sound ok in a medieval context.  It seems that plain english,<br/>
&gt; non modern, words are the most accepted linguistic basis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think a good name for our guild would be one that is in plain, non<br/>
&gt; modern, english.  It should stand alone as a name that sounds good to<br/>
&gt; someone who doesn&#39;t know we are a GLBT guild.  It is good if this name<br/>
&gt; also has some GLBT reference or meaning.  The name should not be<br/>
&gt; inherently &#39;good&#39; or &#39;evil&#39; to avoid an implication of goodness or<br/>
&gt; evilness on the guild members.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Keywords that seem have been suggested that seem generally accepted by all<br/>
&gt; include:<br/>
&gt;     - Unity (Unified, United)<br/>
&gt;     - Alliance (Allied, Allies)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope this helps people in suggesting or considering names.  This is just<br/>
&gt; my perspective on our conversation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Christina </span></blockquote></div>
