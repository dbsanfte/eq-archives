<div id="ygrps-yiv-947906892">One idea you can do is transfering your characters.<br/>
<br/>
No not really, you can&#39;t really transfer characters, but you can make new<br/>
people with the same look and the same class and the same name.<br/>
<br/>
And you will find that the second time you play a class, it is much easier<br/>
to progress than the first time!<br/>
<br/>
I recommend everyone at least try playing on RN, to experience what it&#39;s<br/>
like playing in the guild.<br/>

&gt; While I would love to get to know all of you, I am having a hard time <br/>
&gt; with the idea of giving up characters I have rasied and grown to love <br/>
&gt; on Mithaniel Marr... so... if there are any GLBT players on that <br/>
&gt; server, please feel free to look me up and say hi!<br/>

&gt; Pyderi (male) Half-elf Warrior - 8<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been lucky enough to find one person on that server to talk <br/>
&gt; to, and he&#39;s not even gay! so kudos to him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, feel free to email me ... @ <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:divamae@...">divamae@...</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take care!<br/>
