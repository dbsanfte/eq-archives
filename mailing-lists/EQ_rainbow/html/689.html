<div id="ygrps-yiv-766151532">Hey, after reviewing that thread on the Newbie Zone, it turns out<br/>
it&#39;s <br/>
already been done, & with an element that might make it even more fun <br/>
-- all of the contestants used first level characters started <br/>
specifically for the contest. They also allowed heals & binds, but I <br/>
personally think this would detract from the fun & the point of my <br/>
original idea -- to see how far we could make it with nothing. Oh, if <br/>
anyone missed it -- the idea is for a bunch of newbies (either a real <br/>
char., or 1 started just for the contest) to run nekkid from, say, <br/>
Kelethin to Cabilis (or another equally suicidal destination) with no <br/>
heals, buffs, binds, or SoWs -- just whatever rusty weapon you&#39;re <br/>
willing to lose & offensive magic for the casters. Get as far as we <br/>
can, die young, & leave a beautiful corpse to decay in a far away <br/>
land! Maybe we could get together some prizes for the Ultimate <br/>
Survivor, Most Spectacular Death, etc. So, if anyone else is <br/>
interested, post a reply here or on the mail group!<br/>
