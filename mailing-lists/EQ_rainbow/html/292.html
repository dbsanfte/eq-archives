<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212743065">Well, on the wedding night would be the wrong time to have told.  Through<br/>
most on-line RPGs I&#39;ve been in usually at least 50% (used to be higher<br/>
even) of the female characters *are* played by males.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the males who played male characters, and found out the player<br/>
behind the female on the wedding night was male did *really* flip out.<br/>
About 1/4 got over it but were angry they had not been told earlier, and<br/>
the rest severed relations with both the female character and its player.<br/>
OTOH, I have seen marriages of characters with males behind both characters<br/>
work very well and last years :)  But in this case the male playing the<br/>
female revealed this early enough in the relationship that they were<br/>
comfortable and both players were good RPers and knew they could keep the<br/>
on-line romance just a role so it didn&#39;t threaten anyones sexuality.<br/>
<br/>
If the player behind the male was a very good RPer and well schooled in<br/>
keeping the character relationship seperate from his RL feelings, he&#39;ll<br/>
probably flip (mainly surprise), but get over it.  But expect him to be<br/>
upset you waited this late to tell.  If he spoke a lot about his RL, and<br/>
seemed to &quot;live his character&quot; then it may be best to *never* tell.<br/>
Becuase then he&#39;ll flip and go really insecure.  Add this to the fact that<br/>
many young straight males are soooo insecure about thier sexuality, mention<br/>
its a gay male behind the female and I&#39;d say odds of a &quot;serious flip out&quot;<br/>
really go up :)  I spent many a night up to 3-4 AM in chat talking with<br/>
young males (18-30 is young in my book) who just found out thier on-line<br/>
&quot;love interest&quot; was really a male.  In one case, even one old married guy<br/>
;)  It seemed they really needed to talk it out with a female just to shore<br/>
up thier insecureties. =)  And its happened at least a couple of dozen<br/>
times .. so this seems quite a common occurence.  Roleplaying can really<br/>
engage the emotions ... people unfamiliar with that are often the most<br/>
unprepared for twists like this.<br/>
<br/>
You know the player, can he handle the truth? can the others that spent a<br/>
lot of time flirting handle it when they find out?  or would it be a<br/>
kindness to your friends to make a parting excuse and just never tell?<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck.  Its certainly not an easy situation, and very emotional all<br/>
around. :(<br/>
