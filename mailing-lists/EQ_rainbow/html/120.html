<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087464630">I should be able to make it on Wednesday.  Chat handle Hechicera.<br/>
<br/>
Sidenotes:<br/>
Rhonda & all:<br/>
And I&#39;m up to 8 characters on Brell, all L4, and one L5.  With eight<br/>
characters, and me having this &quot;real life&quot; thing: I wouldn&#39;t worry about a<br/>
low level group.  I&#39;m bound to always have a low level character (or two or<br/>
seven or eight!).  Annwan is gone, but Lynx and Shimyr are mine on Brell,<br/>
making my list on Brell: Bombom, Deceit, Shade, Stormi, Melodie, Shiri,<br/>
Lynx & Shimyr.  All on Antonica, but some can travel already.<br/>
<br/>
Jamie, David:<br/>
I&#39;m also in NC (triangle area), and went to college in SC. :)<br/>
<br/>
For those across &quot;the pond&quot;, as the Brits I know seem to call it:<br/>
I sometimes play mornings, about 1PM to 4PM GMT<br/>
or late afternoon, about 9-11PM GMT.  <br/>
<br/>
- Lora, hugs to all :)</div>
