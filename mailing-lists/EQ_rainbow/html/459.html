<div id="ygrps-yiv-505676476">Afternoon or morning to all of you! David, if you are on today, could<br/>
you list the servers that you have already visited and got the guild<br/>
started on? And if it&#39;s possible, can I help in any way with getting the<br/>
guild on other servers? I&#39;ve actually been on E&#39;ci when Kyala has..talked<br/>
with her, etc. so I think Ive built a report with her.<br/>
     For those of you on Rodect, I started a Barbarian Warrior on there the<br/>
other night...he&#39;s 4th level now ( I did this in less than an hour..power<br/>
leveling ROCKS!). His name is Synder. I think with a little...boosting..I<br/>
can go up 3 to 4 levels each night...just need a CORP of CLERICS behind me!<br/>
LOL!<br/>
     For those of you on E&#39;ci, look me up! Jadeeyes is me. Im KOS in<br/>
Freeport, so I make sure to hang out near there...I love danger!<br/>
Oh, something to remember...if you travel a long way to somewhere, ALWAYS<br/>
try to remember to get a BIND at where you traveled to.<br/>
Example:<br/>
<br/>
     I traveled from Wood Elf City to Freeport one LATE night to buy a<br/>
Barbed Whip from a guild mate, Bazul, for 100pp. I got there..got the<br/>
whip..logged off..then fell asleep on the couch. When I was playing last<br/>
night, I had FORGOT that I was not binded there and proceeded to whack the<br/>
meanies in Oasis. BARELY survived a spell casting madman when I was whacked<br/>
on the head by a Deep Water Goblin. It was then that a cold chill<br/>
surrounded my heart...I was STILL BOUND in Wood Elf City. SURE learnt MY<br/>
LESSON!<br/>
<br/>
     Oh, just to mention, I am now Guildless. No, I wasnt kicked out or did<br/>
I remove myself. My guild was vaporized because some of the members were<br/>
Kill Stealing, making nasty remarks to the GMs and the GUILD Leader couldnt<br/>
stop them...so POOF! GONE! Even though it saddens me greatly, I am NOW in<br/>
possition to assist FULLY with getting our guild up and going on E&#39;ci once<br/>
we untangle things there.<br/>
     Again, if I can do or say something as proxy for you David on E&#39;ci,<br/>
let me know! &lt;smile&gt;<br/>
