<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221482154">My highest character is a Magician14... then a Bard13, so I&#39;m kinda <br/>
unfamiliar with the really good items and how to get them. Except the Oracle <br/>
Robe.. just kill that Oracle. ((Of course &#39;ve never actually done it hehe)). <br/>
What exactly are the journeyman boots? Everyone just says it gives the <br/>
journeyman effect...  And is there a specific place to get a BBC? Any place <br/>
to get a barbed leather whip? Demon Claws? &quot;Gladius&quot;? Crystalline Sword? <br/>
PGT?? AHHHHH!!! So many!!!!! Any help would be appreciated :~)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all! heheh <br/>

&lt;&lt; I spent 9 hours straight waiting for jman&#39;s boots to spawn for me.  They<br/>
 never did.  Drelzna spawned during that time, she just didn&#39;t have the<br/>
 boots.<br/>
 <br/>
 There&#39;s no anti-camp code there, though.  The place is camped on Tunare 24/7<br/>
 and people come away with boots.  A friend of mine went there and got them<br/>
 on the first spawn (the wench! ;)<br/>
 <br/>
 I think I just have horrible luck with spawns like this.  The same thing<br/>
 happened for the BBC =P &gt;&gt;</div>
