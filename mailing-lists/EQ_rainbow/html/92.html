<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787075071">Once the guild is approved through the chat server by a GM, there only has to <br/>
be 1 person on each server to start the guild, because the general guild <br/>
itself has already been approved. Now.. They might require that the Creator <br/>
of the guild in the chat start the guild off on each server... but it could <br/>
be switched over to a regular player.<br/>

&lt;&lt; so what you are saying is that once a quild is started all you have to<br/>
 do is tell the guild gm that you want to carry it over? so once you got<br/>
 the orginal 10 people on the first server you can have 1 person on each<br/>
 other server sort of like recruters? or do there have to be 10 people<br/>
 also on the other servers?  well what ever the situation if we can get<br/>
 it going on more than one server that would be great because i know that<br/>
 there are other people on bristle bane server (my main server other than<br/>
 the test server which i use soo little that it dont really count) which<br/>
 btw i love what they are doing with rogues (no they are not turning on<br/>
 their skills) now you can use both sneak and hide at the same time so<br/>
 you can hide while you are moving at sneak speed!! they also upped the<br/>
 effectiveness of back stab!! i cant wait until they start it up on the<br/>
 regular servers!!  &gt;&gt;</div>
