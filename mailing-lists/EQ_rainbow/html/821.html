<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004431362">Welcome!<br/>
Glad to see you have a warrior. Now that Ompa is leaving (/em cries) <br/>
EQ for RL the guild could use a warrior.<br/>

&gt; Hiyas! Im excited to be a new member of this emailing community!! :)<br/>
&gt;  Hmm, for those who are interested in newcomers, I might as well <br/>
introduce <br/>
&gt; myself a bit.  hehe :D <br/>
&gt;   Lets see.. I have played EQ for a bout a year now, beginning on <br/>
Nameless <br/>
&gt; then switching to Rodcet around April of this year :)    At the <br/>
moment my two <br/>
&gt; main characters on Rodcet are Ivymayden D&#39;Zephyr ~ 34 Woodelf <br/>
Warrior and <br/>
&gt; Melalle ~ 15 Dark Elf Romancer.  (but im a good witch!) among a few <br/>
other <br/>
&gt; chars I got bored with hehe.  I recently discovered Mystic Alliance <br/>
and was <br/>
&gt; overjoyed! I had no idea there was such a guild on EQ!!  These past <br/>
few weeks <br/>
&gt; have been some of the best since I joined :D   Ok, ill draw the<br/>
line <br/>
on the <br/>
&gt; intro here!  Im looking forward to meeting the Rainbow crew!   <br/>
