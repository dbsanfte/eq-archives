<b>Subject:</b> Is Power Leveling bad? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793882600">Hey all, I have a general question. Is powerleveling a bad thing ?  I have<br/>
fallen behind my friends ingame they all are 4-5 lvls at least ahead of me.<br/>
This is due to my lack of playing time lately. I play alot too.. but work<br/>
the last few weeks is sucking up the time. So i want to catch up pretty<br/>
close to them. so they took me to lake rathier, and in a place close to<br/>
zone, where i can powerlevel and zone when i am bout ta croak.  Is this<br/>
considered twinking ? i do the fighting, well as much as my mage can<br/>
handle.. but is this a bad thing to do ? is it banable ? i like it alot and<br/>
can level faster here..</div>
