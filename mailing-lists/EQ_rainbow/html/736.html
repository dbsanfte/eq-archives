&gt; Hey Melanie,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; you sound like me and rob, we love computers.  They are fun to build :)<br/>
&gt; Unfortunatly we need mroe moneyfor our hobby.  My computer is an athlon<br/>
&gt; 700 with 128M ram (very important for EQ i think) and a TNT2 ultra (32M)<br/>
&gt; video card.  I&#39;d like a new video card soon, I think the ATI radeon looks<br/>
&gt; fantastic.  Poor rob has only a AMD K62-400 with 64M, and a voodoo3 2000<br/>
&gt; (used ot be mine but rob had problems with his TNT2 ultra so we switched),<br/>
&gt; you&#39;d think that this configuarion would ROCK, but it dosnt.  I think<br/>
&gt; another 64M ram would help him alot but he is dead set on getting a faster<br/>
&gt; processor than me ;) hehehhe<br/>
