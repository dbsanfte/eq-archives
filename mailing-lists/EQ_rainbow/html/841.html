Woof Woof...<br/>
Welcome to game I think.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not on Rodcet myself, part of the Mystic Alliance that is...though I <br/>
have characters scattered all over.<br/>
<br/>
My main is currently on Tholuxe...one of the new servers and he&#39;s a lvl 35 <br/>
gnome magician.  I have a couple of characters over 50..but haven&#39;t played <br/>
them in awhile (post 50 is terrible)...<br/>
<br/>
Big woof...<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>

&gt;Date: Fri, 08 Dec 2000 09:38:55 -0000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just wanted to say hello to everyone. I just joined up here and<br/>
&gt;wanted to give some information.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My nameis Owen DuBose and I&#39;m a relatively new player to EQ but a<br/>
&gt;lifelong sci-fi, fantasy and RPG fan. My partner Dan Watson and I<br/>
&gt;both play EQ on the Brell Serilis server and are looking for other<br/>
&gt;gay/lesbian friends to meet on our server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My primary character is an Ogre ShadowKnight named Grackk, level 12,<br/>
&gt;currently sittinga round Neriak (a/k/a Scrunchyville) trying to level<br/>
&gt;up fletching, smithing and brewing skills while taking side trips to<br/>
&gt;Lavastorm to kill drakes and rock dervishes :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My secondary character is a Human Cleric named Dhalgren who is<br/>
&gt;currentl hanging in N. Qeynos taking trips to Blackburrow to harass<br/>
&gt;some the gnolls. He is 6th level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dan&#39;s primary character is a 13th lvl DE Necro named Staben who is, I<br/>
&gt;believe currently blitzing around E Commons/N ro/ S Ro and Oasis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dan has a secondary character he hasn&#39;t even played yet, lol.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We are very interested in the possibilty of being a part of a g/l<br/>
&gt;guild on Brell or starting one if there isn&#39;t one. We are also<br/>
&gt;interested in locating other &quot;bear&quot; and &quot;big bear&quot; buddies on Brell<br/>
&gt;to group with or talk to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Feel free to to email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bigbear@...">bigbear@...</a>!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Owen<br/>
