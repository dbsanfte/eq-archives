That&#39;s pretty much how Mystic Alliance turned out to me.  Lotsa nice folks,<br/>
some not nice, but I outgrew the guild and had to go join a guild where I<br/>
could actually do stuff.<br/>

&gt; Yeah, Kirei is a monk, a serious twink - I got to 45 in 18 days and<br/>
quickly out-paced the rest of the guild.  My main is a 57 magician, Beltath,<br/>
in Destiny, now they&#39;re both in Destiny.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I mostly ignored the guildchat, and only ever fought along side a couple<br/>
people in Amazons.  I occasionally put forth the voice of cohesion as well.<br/>
But, really, the guild was just too low to be of any use to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course, I would hardly call Destiny much improvement...<br/>

&gt; Hey! I was/am in that Guild!! and Kirei sounds familiar...Monk?  I signed<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; there once about oh 3 months ago & was told about a split, and for that<br/>
&gt; moment I talked&#39;em out of it (since the leader of the split said 90% of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; toons we&#39;re leaving I pointed out it might be easier just to fix the<br/>
&gt; amazons, besides! what better tag is ther than Amazons of Norrath! hehee<br/>
&gt; sorry guys)<br/>
&gt; it was still together a few weeks ago...oh, and all female toons, not<br/>
&gt; players, lots of straight guys who want to make cracks about butt<br/>
cleavage,<br/>
&gt; again, back when I was an active member...<br/>

&gt; There is a female-only guild on Sol Ro called Amazons of Norrath, and<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; time I left them a splinter group was imminent.  However, it wasn&#39;t a<br/>
&gt; lesbian<br/>
&gt; guild, and only a few members (myself among them) were adamant about<br/>
keeping<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; guild female only.<br/>
&gt; Reason I left?  When I left, I was 45th, average lvl was about 23, closest<br/>
&gt; to me<br/>
&gt; was 40th.  I left and joined an uber guild.-Kirei Tokage, Sol Ro<br/>
