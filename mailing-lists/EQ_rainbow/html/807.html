place as the guild.  Did you see the thread on whether or not guides<br/>
should be required to perform gay marriages in EQ? That was sure a hotbox.<br/>

EQ! I have a 54 Enchanter and a 52 Ranger on Brell Serilis.  I quit about<br/>
two months ago (maybe three?) deciding I just didn&#39;t enjoy the game that<br/>
much any more.  Politics was probably a large part of that (I hate<br/>
politics, SIGH). I might try coming back and guiding but I don&#39;t want to<br/>
do that unless I&#39;m ready to make a commitment, I don&#39;t want to leave again<br/>
after a couple of weeks.<br/>
