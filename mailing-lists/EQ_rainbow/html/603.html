<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-931663866">Thanks so much for the invite! You are the only response I got from that post<br/>
actually. If I were a PVP person, I&#39;d take you up on that. However, I am just<br/>
one of the those wimpy girls who&#39;d rather just battle it with the monsters<br/>
rather than people too. My partner is even worse. She&#39;s bad enough now when<br/>
she gets killed! &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I will keep your email though, because who knows? I could end up getting bored<br/>
on the regular servers and need a little more excitement in my life... heheh.<br/>
<br/>
How long have you two been playing? What types of chars do you have? I&#39;ve<br/>
actually got six chars spread between two servers: Brell and Erollisi. A<br/>
pally, ranger, druid, shaman, warrior and enchanter. Almost all mid- to<br/>
high-teens.<br/>
<br/>
If I come over to Rallos, what name should I look for? Take care of yourself<br/>
and talk to ya soon.<br/>
<br/>
Chris<br/>
