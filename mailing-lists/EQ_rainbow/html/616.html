<div id="ygrps-yiv-356514282">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
	I haven&#39;t spoken to many in awhile now...list seemed rather quiet. My name<br/>
is Sandy Collier and I live in Tennessee. I&#39;ve played EQ about a year now,<br/>
going from class to class until I found my niche&#39;. I have a Monk on<br/>
Bristlebane named Fetish, who has made the last 5 levels from turning in<br/>
Damaged Militia Helms and making  a TON of plat for a newbie! (I&#39;m level 7<br/>
and have around 300 plat!). My main character is Sonjah Blue. She is on the<br/>
E&#39;ci server. Sonjah is a wood elf warrior (level 32). I also have a level 14<br/>
warrior (Dark Elf) named Tambi. I hope to run into you all sometime in game!<br/>
Nates the ONLY one Ive talked as of yet, but Im hopeful!<br/>
<br/>
Sandy</div>
