<div id="ygrps-yiv-623652269">Yes, I&#39;m starting to get to the point that I really don&#39;t care at all about<br/>
the name. The important thing is having a guild and the advantages of it.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Kurt and his Bumpus character met up with my Dedric character on<br/>
Brell and we helped each other out. We tried to get ruined wolf pelts so we<br/>
can make size small patchwork for our guild members. And he helped collect<br/>
bone chips for me to use for my Necro pet spells. And then I got an extra<br/>
pair of shoes off an Orc Pawn and gave them to Bumpus since he didn&#39;t have<br/>
any shoes. This is what I see as the advantage of the guild that will be<br/>
universal to all the servers the guild is represented on.<br/>
<br/>
However, on the Brell Serilis server, we may wish to have a charter that<br/>
emphasizes role playing more since it is a role playing server. So this<br/>
aspect might not be shared among all the chapters.<br/>
<br/>
So, if any of you come over to gnome land, just look for Dedric and Bumpus.<br/>
Also, we travel to Greater Faydark a bit too, so you Wood and High Elves<br/>
give us a tell too.<br/>
<br/>
And hopefully we&#39;ll have some consensus on a name for the guild. At this<br/>
point I am going to agree with whatever gets the most support from everyone<br/>
else just so we can move on.</div>
