<div id="ygrps-yiv-468427293">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people have suggested having the guild on multiple servers.  I&#39;m<br/>
fine with this.  I&#39;d like to emphesize however that we need an official<br/>
home server for the guild, and I think this should be Brell Serelis.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve learned about guilds is that larger is usually better.<br/>
Unless you&#39;re with a close knit group of real life friends, it&#39;s unlikely<br/>
that more than 20% of your guild will ever be online at any time.  Of that<br/>
20%, only maybe one in three will have a character in the same level range<br/>
as you.  This means a guild needs about 76 members before you can feel<br/>
confident there will be 5 other people on the server at any given time who<br/>
you can group with.  Now, you don&#39;t need to group with that many people<br/>
all the time, but the fact remains that the more guild members you have,<br/>
the easier it will be to group and adventure together.<br/>
<br/>
By having an official home server we can encourage people to play there.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean deleting your characters on other servers.  It just<br/>
means that you have a character on Brell Serelis, and you play that<br/>
character either regularly or at the suggested times (when possible).  All<br/>
of us playing on the same server enables us to socialize more easily with<br/>
eachother, and get a better sense of community.<br/>
<br/>
Having guilds on other servers as well is 100% ok, so long as they don&#39;t<br/>
divide us.  I encourage people to run mirror guilds on other servers, so<br/>
long as they don&#39;t encourage people to migrate to their server (instead of<br/>
Brell).  I also hope that people won&#39;t feel that playing in a mirror guild<br/>
is a good substitiute for playing on Brell, but is instead something they<br/>
do in addition to playing on Brell.<br/>
