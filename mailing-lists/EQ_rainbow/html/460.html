<div id="ygrps-yiv-985689545">Hello my extended family. I have a story to relate to you all that may<br/>
be strange and it may make you think. It may make you think about how you<br/>
see and view yourself.<br/>
<br/>
     In 1995, January, I was getting ready for my vacation in England. I<br/>
had never been over seas before so I had to get my Passport. I&#39;m SURE you<br/>
all remember the January, etc. where the Govt. kept shutting down due to<br/>
money matters. Well, here&#39;s the story. To get a Passport, I had to cough up<br/>
my birth certificate. This was a little bit of a problem because I was<br/>
adopted when I was merely a few weeks old and my mother had never gotten a<br/>
birth certificate (Im 34 and live in Tennessee..the state where all I had<br/>
to do to get a Social Security Card was to produce the &#39;FAMILY&#39; Bible in<br/>
which my name and birth date were scrolled). Ok, I thought, no problem, I<br/>
will just contact NASHVILLE (Our state capital) and get them to send me a<br/>
copy of the record. After not hearing from them for a week, I decided to<br/>
call. They could not find the record and asked if I have ever gone by any<br/>
other name. I told them  that I was adopted at a VERY early age but my<br/>
birth name had originally been Johnathan Stephen Graves. She thanked ma and<br/>
the search was on. In a few days I received an envelope via post with a<br/>
Birht Certificate for my ORIGINAL birth name. Bewildered I called them back<br/>
and they told me that NO OTHER certificates were there concerning little<br/>
old me.<br/>
     After this I spoke to my mom...she FINALLY reveiled a secret to<br/>
me...she had never gotten the paper work from my bio-mommy and thus my name<br/>
had never LEGALLY been change at all! YEP! That&#39;s RIGHT! I had lived under<br/>
and ALIAS for over 30 years! I had student loans...credit cards...etc. in a<br/>
NON-Legit name! Well, I had to straighten this out right away! I had<br/>
NON-Refundable CHEAP tickets to LONDON and I WASNT gonna miss out!<br/>
     When I arrived at the local court house and explained what had happend<br/>
and that I was actually changing my name to a name I had used for YEARS,<br/>
the clerks and Judge laughed themselves silly! Indeed, it was funny! I<br/>
think of all the SPY movies Ive seen over the years where the hero&#39;s laid<br/>
out a huge amount of cash for a new ID and I had dont it for NOTHING! ROFL!<br/>
     They say your life is usually a reflection of both your inner self and<br/>
those you pull to you..and are around you. I think this means that we all<br/>
need to too under the table..around the corner....dont take anything for<br/>
granted..nothing is as it seems. Life is too wonderful to be that boring!<br/>
<br/>
I love you all! And have a great day!<br/>
