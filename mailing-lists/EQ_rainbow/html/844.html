<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717398753">Hey Owen!<br/>
<br/>
We used to have a fairly active gay guild on Brell Serilis, but lately<br/>
it&#39;s been quite dead there. I am retired from EQ myself, but I have a 54<br/>
enchanter and a 52 ranger on Brell. If you need to borrow some plat, or<br/>
need some jewlery made, feel free to email me.<br/>
<br/>
Most of our group is on Rodcet Nife where I understand we have a fairly<br/>
active happy guild.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to be part of the queer guild on Brell I can add you as<br/>
well but it is pretty dead.  We&#39;re called &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; on both<br/>
Brell and Rodcet.<br/>

&gt; Just wanted to say hello to everyone. I just joined up here and <br/>
&gt; wanted to give some information.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My nameis Owen DuBose and I&#39;m a relatively new player to EQ but a <br/>
&gt; lifelong sci-fi, fantasy and RPG fan. My partner Dan Watson and I <br/>
&gt; both play EQ on the Brell Serilis server and are looking for other <br/>
&gt; gay/lesbian friends to meet on our server. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My primary character is an Ogre ShadowKnight named Grackk, level 12, <br/>
&gt; currently sittinga round Neriak (a/k/a Scrunchyville) trying to level <br/>
&gt; up fletching, smithing and brewing skills while taking side trips to <br/>
&gt; Lavastorm to kill drakes and rock dervishes :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My secondary character is a Human Cleric named Dhalgren who is <br/>
&gt; currentl hanging in N. Qeynos taking trips to Blackburrow to harass <br/>
&gt; some the gnolls. He is 6th level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dan&#39;s primary character is a 13th lvl DE Necro named Staben who is, I <br/>
&gt; believe currently blitzing around E Commons/N ro/ S Ro and Oasis.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dan has a secondary character he hasn&#39;t even played yet, lol.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are very interested in the possibilty of being a part of a g/l <br/>
&gt; guild on Brell or starting one if there isn&#39;t one. We are also <br/>
&gt; interested in locating other &quot;bear&quot; and &quot;big bear&quot; buddies on Brell <br/>
&gt; to group with or talk to. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feel free to to email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bigbear@...">bigbear@...</a>!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
