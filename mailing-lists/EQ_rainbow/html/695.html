Subject: [EQ_rainbow] My morning..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello all!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just wanted to tell you about my morning and about a very irritating<br/>
&gt; person in Rodcet Nife. Today I entered Crush Bone right after a nasty<br/>
train<br/>
&gt; had chased me out. I came upon a TROLL (His name is/was Bezerker) who<br/>
con&#39;d<br/>
&gt; green to me (He was ALSO very twinked..FULL Crafted..Exe. Axe etc. ) and<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; be being hit on by a lowly GREEN orc. Needless to say we all know the woes<br/>
&gt; of trying to loot while having something hit us..we don&#39;t like it. SO, I<br/>
&gt; kill the greeny orc. Bezerker THEN curses me out for being a KS&#39;er and<br/>
says<br/>
&gt; he has reported me. I was STUNNED! I spoke with him a few moments to<br/>
assure<br/>
&gt; him of my good intent but he would have none of it. Upon exiting CB I saw<br/>
&gt; him in a duel with another PC. The PC won and I applauded. The Bezerker<br/>
&gt; person was apparently not to bright because he was BOUND in G Fay and had<br/>
&gt; died numerous times. I was impressed to see that he undone himself by<br/>
dying<br/>
&gt; too much. Upon getting killed ONCE more by Orcs, his TWINKED body<br/>
&gt; Decayed...EVERYTHING he had on him was GONE** POOF**. I know now that<br/>
there<br/>
&gt; is a goddess and she loves me :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Signed,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Gypsiee (Sandy)<br/>
