<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067021757">Hi as I&#39;ve said before I&#39;m a guide on Rodcet so let me tell you exactly<br/>
how to deal with this kind of harassment!<br/>
<br/>
First of all, always use the /report command to log the homophobic<br/>
comments.  Also note the name of the person and the time the incident<br/>
happened.<br/>
<br/>
Then petition immediately, petition &quot;I was harassed by [name] and I have<br/>
logged the harassment&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
When you speak with a guide, say you want to speak with a server GM about<br/>
it.  Only a server GM can review the logs.  Guides have to witness<br/>
harassment to be able to do anything.  Server GMs are not always on so you<br/>
may have to be patient and persistant over several days.<br/>
<br/>
Once you speak witha  GM you want to say something like &quot;On [date] at<br/>
[time] I was harassed by [name] who made homophobic and insulting comments<br/>
to me.  I logged the harassment with report.  This kind of action must<br/>
not be tollerated in Everquest, and I would like your assurances that you<br/>
will find review my report, find this person, and speak with them so they<br/>
know that homophobic harassment is not allowed in Everquest.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The GM must then find the person when they are online in order to speak<br/>
with them.  You can aid this by putting the person in your friends list,<br/>
and petitioning whenever they are online, continue to petition in this<br/>
fashion until the GM tells you &quot;I have reviewed your report and spoken<br/>
with this person.&quot;  Persistance is key! GMs generally act on petitions,<br/>
and they will not seek out people unless they are online, and they don&#39;t<br/>
generally look for people.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Heya!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; didint get my CD yet but i am getting really excited.  I&#39;m making a monk!<br/>
&gt; :)  I&#39;m going to amke a femalre though cuz i like the way they look.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a sad note, had a BAD experience last night.  I was in a group in<br/>
&gt; infected paw and my boyfreind was in another group in the same zone.  One<br/>
&gt; of my group members kepot going near their &quot;camp&quot; and so Rob (my bf) asked<br/>
&gt; me to telkl him not to, which i did.  he then said &quot;who said that?  I will<br/>
&gt; kill him hehehe&quot; just joking and all, and i said &quot;well it was my love who<br/>
&gt; said it so if you killed him i would ahve to kill you, and shoot a frosy<br/>
&gt; bolt up your ictchy arse&quot; (as i am a wizard and heois a troll)  then he<br/>
&gt; said &quot;YOUR LOVE IS A MAN&quot; and i said &quot;yes i am gay, deal&quot; and he procceded<br/>
&gt; to say &quot;i ahve been grouped side by side witha  fag!&quot;  and then disbanded<br/>
&gt; and shouted &quot;I;m surrounded by freaks&quot;  needless to say he was repoirted,<br/>
&gt; but i dont tihnk a GM was on...maybe our little guide friend can look into<br/>
&gt; this....his name was Slamuk...no pressure, and i didint even suggest that<br/>
&gt; :)   Luckily the other poeple in the group were great and thought he was<br/>
&gt; stupd and our replacement tank asked why our last one ran aorund screeming<br/>
&gt; and we told him and he was pissed and thought it was absurd...so that was<br/>
&gt; cool<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; have fun in kunark!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ok, this might just be a rant, but since it&#39;s non hostile I&#39;m going to post it here =)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; WOW Iksar are so cute.  The first time I ever saw one I was like...oh my gosh! It walks around and swings its little tail and talks and everything! It&#39;s like the best pet!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And Kunark is very pretty.  Lots of fun new zones, with cool looking critters.  It&#39;s pretty obvious to me you could hunt in Kunark and never leave, and get all the way to 50.  It seems a self sufficient continent.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Kunark is dangerous though, I have talked to a lot of people who brought their mains over and got stomped by something.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The solution to all this is...make an Iksar shaman! You get SOW at 9th level and you can explore like crazy.  Team up with a friend and make an Iksar monk, and you have a great 2-person leveling/exploring team especially for low levels.  FYI Iksar have regeneration, and the highest wis of the shaman races, making them the best shaman and monk races IMHO (though they aren&#39;t as cute as Duna).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; (Rumor: Iksar do not get the inherent haste that human monks get at level 20+)<br/>
