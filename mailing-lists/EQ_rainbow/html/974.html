<b>Subject:</b> Nameless Love-Stonewall Pride UPDATE <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-982484493">Hi folks:<br/>
<br/>
A month ago I posted a message here about the new <br/>
gay/lesbian/bi/trans guild on The Nameless server which was then <br/>
called &quot;Stonewall Pride.&quot;  After some deliberation (and some wierd <br/>
nerfing which happened to our guild after the last patch) we decided <br/>
to abandon Stonewall Pride and move everyone into the previously <br/>
existing gay/lesbian guild called Nameless Love.  This was at the <br/>
kind invitation of Tsinen, the head of Nameless Love.<br/>
<br/>
Thus gay/lesbian EverQuest people on The Nameless server may wish to <br/>
join us in the Nameless Love guild to enjoy a safe and friendly <br/>
gay/lesbian environment.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the new Nameless Love members are players of a lower level <br/>
since we have all only recently moved to The Nameless server from <br/>
other servers.  We love to group and hang out.<br/>
<br/>
We welcome all gay/lesbian/bi/trans EQers and hope to see you soon!<br/>
<br/>
Dandee Lyon, druid<br/>
<br/>
Ps. Many thanks to Nameless Love for inviting us into their fold.</div>
