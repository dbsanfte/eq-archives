<div id="ygrps-yiv-373571803">Hello all.<br/>
One thing I think everyone should know. We only need ten people to get the <br/>
guild started, and they dont all have to have a player on the same server. <br/>
Which means that a guild can start basicly on all the servers once it has <br/>
been approved. Only thing is the guild master has to have a char on the <br/>
server to petition and get it created. After the guild has been created on a <br/>
server if the guildmaster doesnt want to be the guildmaster on that server he <br/>
can hand it off.<br/>
<br/>
So what I am basicly saying is. Even thought I dont have the time to play a <br/>
char on the ber server I will be there tonight to help get the guild started. <br/>
If David doent want to be the guildmaster on my particular <br/>
server(bristlebane) I would be happy to take over for him. All he would need <br/>
to do is start a temp char. Petition for the guild. Then hand it over to me <br/>
or whom every they want. <br/>
<br/>
So if you do not play on the roleplay server please dont fell left out. I am <br/>
sure when Unity is made. You will quickly see the guild all over. <br/>
<br/>
Going on the old 10% rule. There  should be almost 2000 GLBT people playing <br/>
the game. They just are not on this list. <br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think<br/>
