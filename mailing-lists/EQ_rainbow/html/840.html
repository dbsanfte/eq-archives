<b>Subject:</b> Hello all <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940690271">Just wanted to say hello to everyone. I just joined up here and <br/>
wanted to give some information.<br/>
<br/>
My nameis Owen DuBose and I&#39;m a relatively new player to EQ but a <br/>
lifelong sci-fi, fantasy and RPG fan. My partner Dan Watson and I <br/>
both play EQ on the Brell Serilis server and are looking for other <br/>
gay/lesbian friends to meet on our server. <br/>
<br/>
My primary character is an Ogre ShadowKnight named Grackk, level 12, <br/>
currently sittinga round Neriak (a/k/a Scrunchyville) trying to level <br/>
up fletching, smithing and brewing skills while taking side trips to <br/>
Lavastorm to kill drakes and rock dervishes :)<br/>
<br/>
My secondary character is a Human Cleric named Dhalgren who is <br/>
currentl hanging in N. Qeynos taking trips to Blackburrow to harass <br/>
some the gnolls. He is 6th level.<br/>
<br/>
Dan&#39;s primary character is a 13th lvl DE Necro named Staben who is, I <br/>
believe currently blitzing around E Commons/N ro/ S Ro and Oasis.<br/>
<br/>
Dan has a secondary character he hasn&#39;t even played yet, lol.<br/>
<br/>
We are very interested in the possibilty of being a part of a g/l <br/>
guild on Brell or starting one if there isn&#39;t one. We are also <br/>
interested in locating other &quot;bear&quot; and &quot;big bear&quot; buddies on Brell <br/>
to group with or talk to. <br/>
<br/>
Feel free to to email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bigbear@...">bigbear@...</a>!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
Owen</div>
