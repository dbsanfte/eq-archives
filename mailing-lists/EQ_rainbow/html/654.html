<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505071123">heh just saw some of your questions<br/>
<br/>
As far as low lvl poeple in the guild goes, most of the low lvl types are<br/>
not so low any more.  I&#39;d say around 15-20.  We made a bucnh of new iksars<br/>
so we played togehter with them a lot in the early days of their<br/>
adventures.  I&#39;m sure we could help you lvl up if you need it.  I would<br/>
recommend that you play any charchter that suites you, dont worry about<br/>
our needs....but it&#39;s be nice to have another cleric , heh, or a druid<br/>
heh.  But dont let me pressure you :P  They fixed alchemy for Shamans FYI,<br/>
but appply poison is not done yet, very soon they say, so feel free to<br/>
amke a rouge (i hear there is an absolutely fantastic weapon in Kunark<br/>
that is probobly going to need to be adjusted as it is doing ungodly<br/>
amounts of dmg with backstab!) :)  Verant has stated that they are pretty<br/>
muich done with balancing all the classes, so they said that you wont see<br/>
many changes in the future with any of the classes.  they are concetrating<br/>
on adding new content rathher than adjusting classes since they feel they<br/>
are essentially done.   heh, whatveer charchter you make, i cant wait to<br/>
see you!<br/>

&gt; Hello everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After a long hiatus, I have decided to return to the world or Norrath. Since<br/>
&gt; the guild seems to be doing well on Rodcet Nife, and I have to start over<br/>
&gt; from scratch anyway, I figured I&#39;d create a character or two on that server.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are there any people in the guild who have low level characters there that I<br/>
&gt; could group with? If so, what race/class should I play to complement them?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t followed all the various nerfs since I quit, so I don&#39;t know what<br/>
&gt; would be a good class to play anymore. If there is one in particular that I<br/>
&gt; should avoid (have they ever finished the rogues?) please let me know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once I get back online, I&#39;ll publish my character info to the list and I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; certainly give a tell in game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hugs,<br/>
&gt; David<br/>
