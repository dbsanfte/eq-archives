<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882143244">Don&#39;t do anything you&#39;re not comfortable with.  There are lots of ways to<br/>
avoid unwanted sexual situations in the game.  Relate to the person as a<br/>
friend, overtly, dismissing advances as a joke.  Tell the person flat out<br/>
you&#39;re not interested.  Make up some suitable background story, like your<br/>
spouse died, or was lost at sea, or something that allows you to dismiss<br/>
romantic possiblities without insulting the person.  You could also just<br/>
say out of character that you&#39;re not comfortable with in-game romance, and<br/>
that you&#39;re just here to adventure and have fun.<br/>

&gt; Hey,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, heres a little problem that follows the issue...<br/>
&gt; I play a level 30 half-elf female, and from day one I&#39;ve always had guys <br/>
&gt; hitting on me, hehe.. Well in RL Im just a 20yr male w/ a fairly feminime <br/>
&gt; personality and I love to dress and look like a girl when I have the <br/>
&gt; oppurtunity.. Problem is Im totally straight so when guys hit on me I kinda <br/>
&gt; like freak out and try to avoid them. Although one guy in particular never <br/>
&gt; leaves me alone. He really is a nice guy. He groups with me alot and points <br/>
&gt; some great hunting grounds out. Of course I never had the guts to tell him I <br/>
&gt; really am a guy. He is around level 45 and knows alot of the high level <br/>
&gt; people, and the last thing I want is to be constantly harrased by all of <br/>
&gt; them when I start exploring the high level dungeons and need these people in <br/>
&gt; my group.. Well, anywayz hes always trying to smooch me and such, and I just <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t think I can be comfy roleplaying that.. maybe I should tell him I have <br/>
&gt; a in game boyfriend already? Hmm, probably a little too late for that now.. <br/>
