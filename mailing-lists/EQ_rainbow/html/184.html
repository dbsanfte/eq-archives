<b>Subject:</b> Some more thoughts on the guild name <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014825007">I&#39;d just like to say some more things about the guild name, based on my<br/>
observation of our discussion.<br/>
<br/>
There is concern that the guild name will look appropriate for any race<br/>
and class.  I.E. a troll shadowknight might not like &quot;order of the pink<br/>
bunnies&quot; and a high elf paladin might not like &quot;defilers of the<br/>
light&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t seem to want a guild with gay or lesbian or any other direct<br/>
sexual orientation reference in it, to avoid harassment.<br/>
<br/>
Most seem fine with an implied indirect reference.  However, I don&#39;t<br/>
think there has been an implied indirect reference that has really held up<br/>
well.  Some people feel that an implied or indirect reference should be<br/>
part of our name.<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t like latin, some people do.  Some people want to use<br/>
words that sound ok in a medieval context.  It seems that plain english,<br/>
non modern, words are the most accepted linguistic basis.<br/>
<br/>
I think a good name for our guild would be one that is in plain, non<br/>
modern, english.  It should stand alone as a name that sounds good to<br/>
someone who doesn&#39;t know we are a GLBT guild.  It is good if this name<br/>
also has some GLBT reference or meaning.  The name should not be<br/>
inherently &#39;good&#39; or &#39;evil&#39; to avoid an implication of goodness or<br/>
evilness on the guild members.<br/>
<br/>
Keywords that seem have been suggested that seem generally accepted by all<br/>
include:<br/>
    - Unity (Unified, United)<br/>
    - Alliance (Allied, Allies)<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps people in suggesting or considering names.  This is just<br/>
my perspective on our conversation.<br/>
