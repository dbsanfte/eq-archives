<b>Subject:</b> E&#39;ci Guild Update <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664445049">Things are looking good for our guild on E&#39;ci. I just received the<br/>
following from the GM, Kyala:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am trying to track down the person with your guild name in game so I<br/>
&gt;can delete it, and make you the guild leader.  Doing my best, this is one <br/>
&gt;of those patient battles.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I told her that our people on E&#39;ci would help look for him and petition<br/>
if we see him. His name is Tarismo. Hopefully it will be soon. Thanks go<br/>
to Sandy for spotting this in the first place and working hard to help<br/>
resolve it.</div>
