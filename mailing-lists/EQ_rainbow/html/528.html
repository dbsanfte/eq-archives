<b>Subject:</b> My exp with the GM Event this weekend <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-365457952">Ok so they finally had a well thought out event, I thought at least. I had<br/>
the pleasure of joining in on the defenders of High Hold Keep. As I heard of<br/>
the events, I immediatly went to High Keep to join in the defense guild.<br/>
From that point on it was Patrol and take posts and wait..until it began<br/>
with a whisper in the woods saying &quot;War War...&quot;  They were plenty in number,<br/>
coming from Neriak through the commons and nektulos. Needless to say I<br/>
roleplayed this one big time.. I was even able to take down 1 inkie and 1<br/>
troll that was in the invasion on my own. In the end, I saw Neresei<br/>
wandering around and sending shouts.. she was a High level Dark Elf PC and<br/>
was real tough. <br/>
<br/>
There was even a instance of someone casting Ice Comet on a crowd of us..<br/>
that was devistating. There was plenty of Gm&#39;s involved as there were many<br/>
NPCs sending out threats .. and as one threat by Neresie told us to give in<br/>
to Innoruk&#39;s children, I opened up my big mouth and sent a shout telling<br/>
Neresei that &quot;You fool, your demise will be in the name of Mithaniel Marr&quot;.<br/>
Well that was a mistake lol as she and her generals sent shouts speaking of<br/>
my bones as they needed them... They were after me. Well I was by riverdale<br/>
and with a group of us attempting to defend riverdale.. Next thing I knew we<br/>
were swarmed and I was prime target.. they tore me to shreds.. with one<br/>
final shout I claimed &quot;my death was not in vain for the light shall<br/>
prevail&quot;. &quot;Loading Please Wait..&quot; <br/>
<br/>
So upon corpse retrieval.. I went to get my body and rest in riverdale, by<br/>
that time Riverdale was taken over by them... Thats all I know as I had to<br/>
camp for the evening.. <br/>
<br/>
This was truly a great event IMHO.. I do feel bad for all the people that<br/>
lost levels due to this.. but hey I didn&#39;t mind the exp loss at such a fun<br/>
price.. <br/>
<br/>
How did the raids go on your servers ? I heard they were server wide. Im<br/>
curious to see if they actually took over High Keep.</div>
