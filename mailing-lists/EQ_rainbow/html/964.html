<div id="ygrps-yiv-14778972">Should have done this sooner ... been playing EQ since Christmas on <br/>
Torv and though I have to say I have fun ... sometimes it can be <br/>
irriating with some of the people ... I see that there are some guild <br/>
on the other servers that have been built and was just wondering if <br/>
anyone could tell me if they were still in place ... Have a real hard <br/>
time giving up a 47 wiz but I think it would be nice to play with <br/>
family and would like to try ... If u could please let me know what <br/>
guilds are on what servers and see if I can&#39;t hook up with some of u <br/>
in game ... til then ... Be safe and good killing always</div>
