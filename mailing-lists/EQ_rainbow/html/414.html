<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057490061">I just want to step in here for a sec and give some support to david in<br/>
terms of getting the rainbow guild going on other servers.  Getting a<br/>
guild made official is very hard, and takes a lot of effort.  There are 22<br/>
servers.  For David to get our guild up and running on other servers is<br/>
going to take a lot of effort from him.<br/>
<br/>
I personally would suggest that if you want the guild started on your<br/>
server, you try petitioning for it yourself, then when the GM answers log<br/>
in a newbie on brell and send Dedric (David&#39;s character) a tell to come<br/>
over.  This way he doesn&#39;t have to spend a lot of time on a server where<br/>
he isn&#39;t even playing!<br/>
<br/>
David, have you talked with a GM about whether or not your presence on<br/>
other servers is mandatory? Maybe there is a way around this.  Or maybe<br/>
you can petition on Brell regarding a guild on another server?<br/>

&gt; If someone on E&#39;ci had the Mystical Alliance tag over his head, then something<br/>
&gt; is not right. I have not even gotten onto that server yet to get the guild set<br/>
&gt; up. Are you sure it said Mystical Alliance? </span></blockquote></div>
