<div id="ygrps-yiv-5126743">Hi, Owen:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was under the impression that tolerance was on the upswing, in<br/>
general anyway. It seems like on EQ that isn&#39;t the case. Is this<br/>
server specific or do any of the rest of you have problems with this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It seems to be the newest &quot;thing&quot; to say for the l33td00dz - whenever it<br/>
happens on our server (Lanys T&#39;Vyl, home of Ordo Ursi Prismatus), I petition<br/>
without fail, and it stops. Just /report, and the last 10 lines of your chat<br/>
window will be sent to a Guide.<br/>
<br/>
I was so proud of my 15 year old nephew, Greg, when he told one of his<br/>
friends to stop using &quot;gay&quot; in that context. At 15, he and his older brother<br/>
are very sensitive to the whole gay issue because of my just being around<br/>
them, that they jump on that stuff without any prompting from me or my<br/>
sister (their mom) - kids can be real heroes sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Bear hugs to all (and happy Holy Days!),<br/>
Jack<br/>
