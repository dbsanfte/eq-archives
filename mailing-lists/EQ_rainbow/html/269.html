<b>Subject:</b> Re: Is Power Leveling bad? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231120426">At second level a man gave my character 106 plats, I never saw him again.  I <br/>
spent it on full leather armor from Kelethin and proceeded to armor my entire <br/>
party of second level friends.<br/>
<br/>
At tenth one of my guild members took me gnoll hunting, upped most of my <br/>
armor to magical items and healed me while I gained the exp.<br/>
<br/>
At 15th I was hunting alone in gnolls and then and only then got accuse of <br/>
power hunting, go figure.<br/>
<br/>
I never saw any of this as wrong, it&#39;s a gmae and if you&#39;re not having fun <br/>
what&#39;s the point of playing?</div>
