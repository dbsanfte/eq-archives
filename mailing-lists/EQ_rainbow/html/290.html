<div id="ygrps-yiv-97673667">Well something has been bothering me lately and seeing Kyle&#39;s pic on Xenogy (if you havn&#39;t noticed I can&#39;t spell to save my life, hehe) has made me decide to ask you guys what you think.  I play a female char on Veeshan, a fairly well known one.  In real life I am a 22 year old male.  Well except for 2 people, everyone on the server thinks Im a female in real life.  I am starting to feel very bad about this.<br/>
<br/>
I have a regular group that I always play with and these guys are always fighting over me because they think Im female.  The first time we grouped they flirted heavily and I was scared to tell them I was male because we all got along so well.  Well that was 20 lvl&#39;s ago.<br/>
<br/>
The straw that broke the camels back happened the other night.  I have been in a guild for a pretty long time and was scheduled to marry the guild leader.  Well the entire guild including the leader believed me to be female in real life also.  Lets just say I never showed up for the wedding.  I transferred all my equip to a new Dark Elf ShadowKnight and deleted my lvl 21, hoping to move into the shadows forever.  So here I am, lvl 1, no friends, my regular group is sending me emails left and right asking where am I.<br/>
<br/>
Did I do the right thing by just dissapearing or should I just email them and say Im a liar and just pray they don&#39;t cuss me out to bad.<br/>
<br/>
Not to many things make me cry, but this has.  I guess mainly I needed to vent to someone, so thanx for listening guys.<br/>

PS - Kyle, I hope your mail box didn&#39;t instantly fill up with emails from dirty old EQ men after posting your pic.  =)</div>
