Wow! I have to say, &quot;What a friendly bunch!&quot; Thanks for all the intros and<br/>
invites! Chris and I just started playing, so you 30+ level characters might<br/>
be a tad bit out of our league, but knowing there are some guilds out there<br/>
is great. My first few forays into EQ have been very positive - I&#39;ve met<br/>
some very patient and helpful folks at every step, and was even able to<br/>
build up a brand new character to 3rd Level in less than 2 hours of play!<br/>
Ok, so I&#39;m in fear of being known as &quot;Hammond, the Rat Slayer&quot;, but that&#39;s<br/>
ok.<br/>
<br/>
As far as intros go, I&#39;ll post mine and give some info on Chris, although he<br/>
will probably join the list shortly and give his own:<br/>
