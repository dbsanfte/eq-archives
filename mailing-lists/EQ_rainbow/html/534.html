<b>Subject:</b> Re: My exp with the GM Event this weekend <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603072283">I didn&#39;t find the event that fulfilling.  Being on a young server, the<br/>
forces of darkness were truly overwhelming and could not be stopped.  The<br/>
level 50+ dark elf NPCs in high hold killed everyone who went against them<br/>
as far as I know.  They should really vary the strength of the NPCs<br/>
according to the servers that the event is held on.<br/>
<br/>
While I was able to follow the general storyline, I did not find it<br/>
compelling or enveloping.<br/>
<br/>
I spent most of my time in Kithcor trying vainly to stop the daughter of<br/>
Innoruk.  All the NPCs had extremely high magic resistence.  I managed to<br/>
mesmerize one GM but since he was being constantly attacked it was<br/>
pointless (mes kept breaking).<br/>
<br/>
I did however enjoy the post-ascention undead raid on Kithcor.  I wish my<br/>
party had been better organized we might have got a few kills on the big<br/>
NPCs.  I also enjoyed the post-raid regular night undead spawns in<br/>
kithcor.  I helped a bunch of people get some of the cool new weapons that<br/>
were dropped there.<br/>
