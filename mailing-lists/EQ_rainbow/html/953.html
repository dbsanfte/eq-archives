<br/>
Hi folks:<br/>
<br/>
A gay guild is forming on The Nameless server at this time and we <br/>
invite anyone interested to join us and be part of &quot;Stonewall Pride.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Stonewall Pride&quot; is the tentative name of the new guild (yet to be <br/>
approved by Verant).  We hope to create a guild based on a welcoming <br/>
gay / lesbian / bi / trans fellowship where any of us can play EQ <br/>
without being subject to the anti-gay prejudice that we frequently <br/>
encounter in Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re still formulating the charter and operating mode so you can <br/>
definitely provide input regarding your ideas about a gay guild or <br/>
your experiences in a gay guild such as the renown Mystic Adventurers <br/>
on Rodcet Nife.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re currently using a Yahoo Club for contact - <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/gayandlesbianeverquestfolk.">http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/gayandlesbianeverquestfolk.</a>  We&#39;re <br/>
having a meeting in the chat room of that club on Monday June 11th at <br/>
8pm Central time (6pm PST) to discuss &quot;Stonewall Pride&quot; and how to <br/>
get it running smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
Many of us have moved from other servers to The Nameless so we mostly <br/>
have lowbie characters at this point - not aware of any over 20 yet - <br/>
so start up a character on The Nameless and join us!<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes to all,<br/>
<br/>
