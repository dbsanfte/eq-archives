&gt;Anyway, by my count there will be 3 of us on the new server so far...<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kyte, Lonewolf, and now my character... which will most likely be named<br/>
&quot;Fraser&quot;. If there is anyone else coming to Brell Serilis, please let me<br/>
know your name and I will try to meet you on-line. My character class,<br/>
race, and name may change depending on what our needs are. But I truly hope<br/>
that we all can find our way to the unity we seek in each other somehow.<br/>
Regardless, good luck to all of you no matter where your journey leads you<br/>
in Norrath.<br/>

Just started Brieh in the high elf country on Brell. Haven&#39;t spent much<br/>
time yet. Still lvl 1.<br/>
