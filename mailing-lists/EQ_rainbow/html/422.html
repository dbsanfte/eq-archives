<div id="ygrps-yiv-557143986">I&#39;m sorry as well.  Though I know the actual incident was extremely<br/>
unpleasant for you and your boyfriend, I think what I am the most disturbed<br/>
about the lack of a sufficient response from a GM :(.  And the whole thing<br/>
just makes me mad.  I&#39;d be interested in hearing if you do or do not heard<br/>
anything further from any Verant representative on this.<br/>
<br/>
I also recently had to deal with something like this outside of tells.  A<br/>
pair of individuals were commenting on all the &quot;gay guild names&quot; and making<br/>
other remarks in zone wide ooc using gay/homo as derogatory adjetives for<br/>
abilities or names.  A single comment I ignore, however after around 10 I<br/>
just can&#39;t ignore it!  And much to my horror, one of the /ooc&#39;ers was a<br/>
recently added member in my own group.  I did keep it to groupsay however,<br/>
and to my surprise, he apologized multiple times.  He even grouped with me<br/>
again, and the first time asked my regular partner (half of a<br/>
Warrior/Cleric combo), if he could join and if I would be &quot;allright with<br/>
it&quot; knowing he may have blown his welcome.  I never heard those adjectives<br/>
again.  I did tell him I was in a &quot;gay guild&quot; and that I thought our name<br/>
was &quot;cool&quot;, I did *NOT* tell him that I wasn&#39;t gay (its none of his d*mn<br/>
business that I&#39;m straight!).  So despite thier having the opportunity to<br/>
insult me on the basis of my being gay, I was not, even by his friend who<br/>
was less contrite.  Perhaps it was just because we were in Unrest and I was<br/>
grouped with the only Cleric thier level ;)  But I think not.  He was<br/>
apologizing for 3 days, and promising to break his &quot;poor word choice slang<br/>
usage habit&quot; as he called it in RL as well :)  One of the worst starts, and<br/>
best outcomes of this sort of incident in a while.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I was on as my Warrior who&#39;s tagged in the women&#39;s players guild<br/>
&quot;Sisterhood of Erollisi&quot;, so any rumors that the sisterhood on Brell is gay<br/>
... I&#39;m to blame. ;P<br/>
