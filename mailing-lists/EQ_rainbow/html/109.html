<br/>
I don&#39;t know a lot about tailoring, but I can make metal studs for you if<br/>
you want them for studded leather armor.<br/>
<br/>
Rogues can wear banded by the way, I&#39;m hoping to be able to make full<br/>
sets of banded for guild members for 70pp.  I need to experiment a bit<br/>
first to see if I can really do it for that price.<br/>
