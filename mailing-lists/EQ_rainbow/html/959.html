<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534575695">Hiya,<br/>
<br/>
Why are we receiving email from a list called <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gay48@yahoogroups.com">gay48@yahoogroups.com</a>? Well<br/>
Yahoo bought egroups and onelist, and in the process it seems they came up<br/>
with aliases for all the lists.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like we have been classified as a &#39;gay&#39; list (sure) and that<br/>
emails to this group can also be sent to gay48. Why would they do this?<br/>
Probably to enable approved advertisers to better target their audiences.<br/>
I.E. advertisers who want to email the gay groups can email gay1, gay2,<br/>
gay3....and so on.<br/>
<br/>
As long as Yahoo lets us ban individual email addresses, like<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gayromance2001@...">gayromance2001@...</a>, I find this annoying but not a critical issue.<br/>

&gt;         I don&#39;t know why, but your email came to ME. It says to Gay48, but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve never registered under anything like that. I am on Rodcet and am<br/>
&gt; Gaiwan/Gotham/Greymaulkin. What seems to be going on with it?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Ok I am looking into banning this specific email address....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   If Yahoo won&#39;t let me ban this I will move the list to another provider.<br/>
