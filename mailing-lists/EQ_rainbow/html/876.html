<div id="ygrps-yiv-94806658">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just joined the mailing list and am very excited to have found <br/>
this group. I&#39;ve been looking for a long time for other gays in the EQ <br/>
world. I currently play on The Seventh Hammer sever with my main <br/>
character Deanir a lvl 38 dwarf cleric. I only know of 5 other gay <br/>
players on the server, 4 of which I know in RL.<br/>
If there are any other people who play on The Seventh Hammer server do <br/>
send me a /tell and say hi.<br/>
