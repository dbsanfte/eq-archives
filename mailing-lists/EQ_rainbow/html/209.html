&gt; I like the story as well, and I agree with Christina that we don&#39;t need to be<br/>
&gt; outcasts. As far as names for the women in the history, there&#39;s a couple I<br/>
&gt; have in mind, but need to look up tonight before posting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In reading your message, Christina, another name came to mind &lt;as she<br/>
&gt; cautiously tosses it into the fray&gt;: Mystic Alliance<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the GLBT-related names have pretty much been dropped in discussion by<br/>
&gt; most people. This name is role-play appropriate, it is somewhat mysterious and<br/>
&gt; the alliance part is what we are about. There is nothing good/evil impliant in<br/>
&gt; the name, nor any specific class or race.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Although the GLBT link may not be apparent in any name chosen, it is easy<br/>
&gt; enough to add symbolism to any graphics/logo associated with a guild site.<br/>
&gt; Granted, it wouldn&#39;t be visually attached to our names in the game, but if<br/>
&gt; people want to know, they&#39;ll ask or look for a website for information.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as publicity for the guild once things are a bit settled, PlanetOut<br/>
&gt; might be a great online zine to contact. Their turnaround time for getting<br/>
&gt; information out is much quicker than the print media. I think they may also<br/>
&gt; have links to GLBT websites, which would be great when we have one for the<br/>
&gt; guild. I can&#39;t recall if there is a gay-related news service bureau. Some<br/>
&gt; individuals were trying to create one a while ago. The BBC is very queer<br/>
&gt; friendly and could be interested in a story, especially if we wish to reach<br/>
&gt; our brothers and sisters in the EU. Wired may also be a good place to reach<br/>
&gt; GLBT gamers and they have their email newsletters as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I enjoyed chatting with you all in the guild formation last night. This is the<br/>
&gt; start of something really great.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m fine with this story. I don&#39;t see the need for us to be outcasts <br/>
&gt; though. I personally prefer to assume that Norathian culture is generally <br/>
&gt; accepting of diverse sexual orientation, and that players who express <br/>
&gt; otherwise are members of some strange minority. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One thing I would like to see in terms of roleplay is that GLBT and <br/>
&gt; positive people share a kind of bond that is manifests itself as a <br/>
&gt; tangible spiritual connection. Something along the lines of us all coming <br/>
&gt; together because we had this connection, and could sense it in eachother. <br/>
&gt; Kind of a mystic gaydar 8) I like it because this implies a reason for us <br/>
&gt; to exist in an organization beyond combating homophobia (which implies <br/>
&gt; homophobia is a force requiring an organization to combat). <br/>
