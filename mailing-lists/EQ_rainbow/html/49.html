<br/>
I have 3 Chars on Veeshan, 1 on Test, 2 on Cazic and 3 on Rellos.  Its not that I play a great deal (only about 3 to 4 hours a day), but its nice having a variety.  Also I just made a Monk (God are those Humans ugly, hehe) that is currently in the Freeport area on the new server.  His name is Kyte, stop by and say hi if your on.<br/>
