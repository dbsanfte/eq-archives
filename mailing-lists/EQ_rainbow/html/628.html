<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ_rainbow] Just started playing EQ wheres a good TG friendly server? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-642973456">I doubt any server is really TG friendly per say but I like to think that<br/>
on this mailing list we are all TG friendly =)<br/>
<br/>
Rodcet is a nice place to go because lots of people are there, and I&#39;m a<br/>
guide there =D <br/>
<br/>
Brell Serilis seems like a nice server too, my enchanter Luna married her<br/>
sweetheart Duna and no one has been mean about it though some people have<br/>
been confused.  My Ranger Pixy is also dating a female paladin Aeani and<br/>
again no real problems.  Brell also has a fair number of people from the<br/>
list on it.<br/>
<br/>
You could go anywhere, but these servers give you a good start for queer<br/>
positive people!<br/>
