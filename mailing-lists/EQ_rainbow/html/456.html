<div id="ygrps-yiv-661805254">I was wondering if anything has been done on E&#39;ci yet concerning the guild<br/>
mix up. I talked with Kyala the other night and she was willing to wait a<br/>
little bit on David to get back with her. I tried to send a TELL to Dedric<br/>
saying &#39;HOLY GEE! HURRY! Kyala is on&#39; but I got an A.F.K. message :-(<br/>
Apparently only the senior GM&#39;s can handle this issue...wish I knew of<br/>
OTHER senior GM&#39;s.<br/>
