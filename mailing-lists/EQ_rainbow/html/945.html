This is from the Vansheen server and shall spread to all other servers.<br/>
Some of this has happend to our server already (i.e. Runnyeye)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Friends whoms names are too numerous to mention:<br/>
<br/>
This email concerns the semi-recent and the recent up to date series of<br/>
events that has been hitting Norrath for a while<br/>
now. <br/>
<br/>
So when did this all start?<br/>
Bloody Kithicor, last year, if anyone remembers. Innorruk sent forth his<br/>
daughter into Norrath to spread chaos and havoc.<br/>
She succeded, and after a few bloody days, royally trashed EC, WC, Kith<br/>
and Highpass. She also succeded in cursing<br/>
Kithicor with hte Undead Night spawns. Last but not least, she managed<br/>
to succede in opening a Portal to the Plane of<br/>
Hate.<br/>
<br/>
What she also managed to do was to get herself killed. And after that,<br/>
you really don&#39;t hear much from the Prince of Hate<br/>
camp for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Jump ahead a few months into the future.<br/>
A band of cheerful good-doers started to explore the jungle continent of<br/>
Kunark. Unfortunately, one of them was<br/>
abducted and held prisioner by an Iskar the name of whom I can&#39;t<br/>
remember off hand. The thing here is, however, that it<br/>
really upset her father (Who happens to be the King of High Elves) to<br/>
the point that he started calling in favors from other<br/>
races, sent an army across the seas and restablished the outpost named<br/>
after his daughter: Firiona Vei.<br/>
<br/>
The Evil Aligned sat back and watched this with growing interest. They<br/>
set up their own little base on Kunark, allied<br/>
themselves with Venril Sathir for power, money, new spells, ect, and the<br/>
chance to continue to stick it to the Light Races.<br/>
<br/>
In other parts of the world, a few months down the line.<br/>
Around Qyenos groups of Rude Individuals started showing up. I can hear<br/>
you sayit now, yes, it is qyenos, and everyone<br/>
is rude over there. But these guys.. were a special breed. About the<br/>
same time that they showed up merchants started<br/>
getting the stuffing kicked out of them and general discord was<br/>
experienced by all. Then, after a week or two, the Rude<br/>
Individuals became Loathesome, and Specters started showing up in the<br/>
Catacombs of Qyenos. Those whom were<br/>
Loathesome started KoSing anything within reach. (and they tended to<br/>
advance spawn: kill one, a bigger one would pop,<br/>
until I was getting exp from them in my high 40&#39;s.)<br/>
<br/>
Despite their best efforts the plot was discovered that they had tried<br/>
so hard to conceal. Turns out that Bertoxxolous, the<br/>
Plagebringer, the God With No Allies, had been trying to open a gate<br/>
into Norrath from the Plane of Decay. The plot was<br/>
foiled, and a few people were hanaged. (And a ranger was given an AC 50<br/>
shield as a reward)<br/>
<br/>
Back in Kunark...<br/>
Firiona Vei is released. Much joy is had by all. (Except those in the<br/>
Outpost, who got a solid kicking for their involvement<br/>
with Sathir)<br/>
<br/>
In the Northern Desert of Ro..<br/>
A band of happy go lucky Gnomes and Dwarves go exploring, and manage to<br/>
find themselves a whole new continent. See<br/>
what happens when you give them too much sugar? In the process of<br/>
discovering this new world, they stumble across<br/>
three new groups to be warned of: The Coldain, The Kromiff and Kromzek,<br/>
and the Claws of Veeshan. Later exploring<br/>
leads travelers to find The Sleepers Tomb, guarded by Dragons galore.<br/>
The Sleeper, well, is sleeping. He&#39;s the offspring of<br/>
Vox and Nagafen (and apparently Vox and Naggy shouldn&#39;t have mated, as<br/>
it was that act that created this all powerful<br/>
Dragon and got themselves thrown out of the &quot;new world&quot; to live as<br/>
outcasts from the Ring of Scale), and insanely<br/>
powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately a few months later the Guild Afterlife manages to wake him<br/>
up. The Lead-Lead GM shows up and says<br/>
somthing along the lines of &quot;Norrath is not ready to face the<br/>
consequences of what you have awakened today.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
That line throws up warning bells, does it not?<br/>
<br/>
Then things go back into a calm, restfull state. Until...<br/>
Back at Qyenos, the city of warm, loving, thoughtfull people, well..<br/>
they managed to find the High Priest of Bertoxxolus.<br/>
And promptly hanged him.<br/>
<br/>
This fact did not set well with the Plagebringer. To the point that he<br/>
sent his influnce into the Karanas, spreading a massive<br/>
Plague upon the land that corrupted the crops, the animals, and created<br/>
a new breed of Bug: The Swarmers. But it was<br/>
also at this time that someone else came back into play..<br/>
<br/>
Lanys T&#39;Vil.<br/>
The daughter of Innorruk came back, in a different body but with the<br/>
same mind and most of the same powers. Now,<br/>
Neriak gets a little touchy on this. See, part of them beleive she IS<br/>
who she says she is, while the rest think not (due to the<br/>
new body). Even better, Inny&#39;s little girl had a falling out with<br/>
Himself. He wants his powers to go to a new vessel on<br/>
Norraath, she simply wants to keep them.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s more is that she is seeking out 3 parts of an ancient staff that<br/>
terrifies even the Teir&#39;Dal - and she has one part of it<br/>
allready, after delivering a solid kicking of the Forces of Light.<br/>
<br/>
And there seems to be one other, minor detail. Since she and daddy had a<br/>
slight falling out, she has opted to choose a new<br/>
Deity to give her allegance to (as it is rumored). His name is..<br/>
Bertoxx.<br/>
<br/>
Good Old Bertie...<br/>
As rumor and some evidence points, himself wants to open a gate into<br/>
Norrath - and to hell with the Pact of the Gods that<br/>
was to keep them in their own seperate planes. In essence, he&#39;s thrown<br/>
out the rulebook and because of this, everyone<br/>
wants to play a bit and shape Norrath into their own image. <br/>
<br/>
Runneye..<br/>
This really doesn&#39;t hold much for the main series of events but it is<br/>
worth noting. The Goblins of the Runneye Citadel have<br/>
managed to throw out the Evil Eyes that have ruled over them for so<br/>
long. And while they were at it they killed their king<br/>
for his compliance with them. New management is in place, and this bodes<br/>
ill for Highpass: the Pickclaw Goblins are at the<br/>
heart of this chaos.<br/>
<br/>
Permafrost..<br/>
(From the In Development page on the EQ Site)<br/>
**We have plans for some updates and/or revamps for some of the dungeons<br/>
in the world. Our last patch included an<br/>
updated Runnyeye complete with new monsters and treasures to be<br/>
plundered. Next on the list is Permafrost Keep. Lady<br/>
Vox has been in the mood to do some redecorating of her lair, which<br/>
includes replacing some of her more lackwitted<br/>
minions. Stay tuned for more specific information as it is released.**<br/>
<br/>
And finially, Last Night.<br/>
I missed part of this and I am waiting for the full log from a friend of<br/>
mine (Biz, got off yer hiney and mail it to me) but the<br/>
gist of what happened: FV and Tunare wanted to talk. Tunare showed, they<br/>
chatted. then the Faceless (Cazic) spawned<br/>
and took out Tunare (her avatar form, that is) and proceded to berate<br/>
everonye in sight, until the players there took him<br/>
out. (He went from 50% to 0 in 2 seconds. He also didn&#39;t have any loot)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately he also managed to corrupt the Unicorn (FV&#39;s steed), in<br/>
what way we&#39;re not sure. Hopefully after I get a<br/>
chance to look at some of the logs I&#39;ll be able to say for sure what<br/>
happened.<br/>
<br/>
Unconfirmed Rumors.<br/>
Unconfirmed by anything (yet):<br/>
Vox and Nagafen want to get out and stretch their wings a bit, maybe<br/>
roast a few cities.<br/>
The Ring of Scale and Claws of Veeshan are really worried about the<br/>
now-awoken Sleeper.<br/>
Tunare has been banished / limited in power after last night.<br/>
Bertoxx MAY be on the warpath from Qyenos to Freeport, not sure yet,<br/>
this is the one I disbeleive the most.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, that&#39;s the short and skinny. This doesn&#39;t include what&#39;s going<br/>
on with Lucin, but when I find out, I&#39;ll let everyone<br/>
know. Hope you enjoy, please feel free to send this on to others who may<br/>
enjoy reading this, or at least would like to<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone notice the Skys of Karana? Lovely Green and it always rains?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks alot<br/>
