<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667208641">this is something i wrote not long after i came out of the closet and i<br/>
thought i would share it, if it is similar to anything else you have<br/>
heard or read it is only a coincidence and i did it unintentually<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It began in the fall and the dead leaves started to cover things up.<br/>
<br/>
When winter clouded up the skies, and snow blotted out everything, I<br/>
almost felt safe.<br/>
<br/>
But when spring came along I realized that the snow wouldn&#39;t be around<br/>
forever.<br/>
<br/>
And now that it is summer I am glad that the leaves and snow of fall and<br/>
winter will never cover me again.</div>
