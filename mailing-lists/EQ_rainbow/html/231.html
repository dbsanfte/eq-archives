<div id="ygrps-yiv-831825493">Hi everyone! I&#39;m sorta new to this big list thing. I&#39;m on Xegony and I have a few gay friends on Xegony as well who would LOVE to join this gig. My main character is listed as Virile. I dont think that I play when you guys would be doing your chat thing, but give me some info as to how to make a branch of this guild in Xegony, and I&#39;d be happy to follow through. :o) thank ye<br/>
<br/>
