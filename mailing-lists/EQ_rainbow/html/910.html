<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711973151">wow.....thanks for the referral.  I am a member of the Mystic Alliance <br/>
on RN and have to say I have had a wonderful time with them.  Eveyrone <br/>
is very friendly and helpful and looking out for each other.<br/>
<br/>
The guild is not strictly gay, but a majority of the members are and <br/>
those who are not are gay friendly.  Everyone is always willing to <br/>
help when they can and there is no line between &quot;gay and straight&quot;  we <br/>
are all simply &quot;guildmates&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you get a chance, create a character and come on over for a visit. <br/>
 Don&#39;t have to join and if one of our lowbies or newbies is around you <br/>
guys can group!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; One idea you can do is transfering your characters.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No not really, you can&#39;t really transfer characters, but you can <br/>
make new<br/>
&gt; people with the same look and the same class and the same name.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And you will find that the second time you play a class, it is much <br/>
easier<br/>
&gt; to progress than the first time!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I recommend everyone at least try playing on RN, to experience what <br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; like playing in the guild.<br/>

&gt; &gt; While I would love to get to know all of you, I am having a hard <br/>
time <br/>
&gt; &gt; with the idea of giving up characters I have rasied and grown to <br/>
love <br/>
&gt; &gt; on Mithaniel Marr... so... if there are any GLBT players on that <br/>
&gt; &gt; server, please feel free to look me up and say hi!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have been lucky enough to find one person on that server to talk <br/>
&gt; &gt; to, and he&#39;s not even gay! so kudos to him.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, feel free to email me ... @ divamae@h...<br/>
