<b>Subject:</b> Helloooooo EQ Rainbow! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115855048">So i&#39;ve only been playing EQ a month and have had an absolute blast. <br/>
to say that I&#39;m sucked into it is an understatement.<br/>
<br/>
So I had this great idea to form a gay guild... and who knew?? Some <br/>
other really cool person already thought of it.<br/>
<br/>
As a newbie though I have some questions!<br/>
<br/>
How do you form a guild on your server?<br/>
How do you join a guild already in place?<br/>
<br/>
Currently I play on test server (wanted a low volumne server to get <br/>
familiar with the game) and could easily start on another server if I <br/>
knew I could hook up with some other gay friendly folks!<br/>
<br/>
Lemme know!<br/>
