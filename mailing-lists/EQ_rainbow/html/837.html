<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837187399">Welcome Kedek!<br/>
My characther, Hamyrmint, is one of the officers for Mystic <br/>
Alliance.  He being a Dwarf smith, is happy to see another <br/>
shaman!  Once we get you up in levels, we can put you to work <br/>
mixing dyes!!  ;)  Seriously though, I will be probably on Fwayder <br/>
toinight seeing if I can finally make Imbued Dwarven Plate.  (why <br/>
do people always have to start their charachters on the otherside <br/>
of the world from where I am).  Maybe if Snapdragon is still on <br/>
the Antonican side of the world and comes on tonight we can get <br/>
him to Selo&#39;s his happy ass out there and invite you in.  <br/>
Hopefully today&#39;s patch won&#39;t take longer than 12 hours.  <br/>
<br/>
Once again, welcome to our insanity!<br/>

&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just found this group and believe me, I&#39;ve been looking for it <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; a long time! I had been on every search engine I could think of <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; nothing was coming up, finally I got to HOTBOT and there it <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; EQ_Rainbow. As I was clicking the link, I thought for sure it <br/>
would <br/>
&gt; be dead. But it wasn&#39;t (YAY!) and here I am. I always knew there <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; to be others on EQ, but I was starting to have doubts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been playing on Morrel-Thule for the last 7 months or so, <br/>
but <br/>
&gt; not reguarly until recently. Anyway, I have decided that since I <br/>
&gt; finally found the group, I am going to move over to Rodcet Nife <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; create a new character (I can&#39;t believe I have to be a newbie <br/>
AGAIN!)<br/>
&gt; At least, no one took my name. :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I just wanted to say &quot;Hey&quot; to everyone and if you are in <br/>
EQ <br/>
&gt; on Rodcet Nife give a /tell to Kedek, I am very interested in <br/>
joining <br/>
&gt; the guild.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Until then,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
