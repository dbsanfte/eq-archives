<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066572679">Hello everyone.<br/>
I just want to introduce myself. <br/>
My name is Frank and I am 30 and I am not so straight as I have always thought since I have met a short time ago my girlfriend, who is a T-Girl and my great love. <br/>
Another thing I am new too is Everquest. To be honest I am waiting for my mail to receive my copy that I can install it and can start soon.<br/>
I think it will be a great adventure to travel in this world and cannot await starting it to get my first experiences. Thats for the moment all, cause I don&#39;t know at the moment, where I start or what character I will create for exploration.<br/>
<br/>
So I wish everyone lots of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Frank</div>
