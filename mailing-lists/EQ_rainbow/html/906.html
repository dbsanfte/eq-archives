<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097304767">While I would love to get to know all of you, I am having a hard time <br/>
with the idea of giving up characters I have rasied and grown to love <br/>
on Mithaniel Marr... so... if there are any GLBT players on that <br/>
server, please feel free to look me up and say hi!<br/>

I have been lucky enough to find one person on that server to talk <br/>
to, and he&#39;s not even gay! so kudos to him.<br/>
<br/>
Also, feel free to email me ... @ <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:divamae@...">divamae@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Take care!<br/>
