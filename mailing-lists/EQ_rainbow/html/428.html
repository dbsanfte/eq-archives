<b>Subject:</b> MORE Guild info <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617596411">I spoke to Verant just now. They told me that guild apporval and setup is<br/>
server specific. Apparently the fact that the Mystical Alliance exists on<br/>
E&#39;ci is irrelivant. Since we had not gotten to that server yet and set it<br/>
up, Tarismo&#39;s guild gets the right to that name on THAT server. IF we come<br/>
across our guild name on another server it&#39;s the same situation. I pointed<br/>
out that the problem is that we have the SAME NAME but all he could do was<br/>
say PETITION a GM and let them clear it up. One GM in particular is Kyala<br/>
who actually works for EQ and is OFTEN on  E&#39;ci. If you do a /who all gm or<br/>
a /who all kyala she will NOT appear because she works behind the scenes.<br/>
The way it seems SO far is that Verant may do nothing or they may delete<br/>
BOTH gulds and have us start over. I would think since Tarismo is so upset<br/>
about what we stand for that he may want US to delete OUR name and start<br/>
over. My opinion is whomever started first should have rights and the other<br/>
should do a rename. It&#39;s fair.<br/>
