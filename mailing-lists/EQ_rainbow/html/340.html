I often wonder if it isn&#39;t simply easier to hunt non-camped (or<br/>
lesser-camped) spawns and earn enough coin to buy the goodie I want from a<br/>
player that has one for sale...<br/>
<br/>
Not only that, but I get to earn a lot of experience as I hunt another<br/>
critter while waiting for one to respawn.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I spent 9 hours straight waiting for jman&#39;s boots to spawn for me.  They<br/>
&gt;never did.  Drelzna spawned during that time, she just didn&#39;t have the<br/>
&gt;boots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There&#39;s no anti-camp code there, though.  The place is camped on Tunare<br/>
&gt;24/7<br/>
&gt;and people come away with boots.  A friend of mine went there and got them<br/>
&gt;on the first spawn (the wench! ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think I just have horrible luck with spawns like this.  The same thing<br/>
&gt;happened for the BBC =P<br/>
