<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118644962">okay<br/>
if you aren&#39;t aware they have been building up the opening of the Plane of<br/>
Disease for some time now (port into nk - you get annoyed by the little<br/>
messages about being sick).  In a recent interview even (I believe it was<br/>
abashi) talked about opening up of the plane, there is a story that leads up<br/>
to it and links with the opening up of Luclin as well.  He also stated that<br/>
they are redesigning WK so they can move the WK wizard spire closer to the<br/>
Qeynos hills so it has SOME purpose in being in the game.  (it&#39;s current<br/>
spot is rather pointless).<br/>
I cannot see them wasting a lot of people redesigning zones (ie a closed off<br/>
halas, smashed qeynos, smashed rivervale) as they have stated before that<br/>
making zones is a lot of work and they are currently have been doing<br/>
Disease, WK, Stonebrunt Mountains AND working on Luclin.<br/>
I think there will be a lot of story going on, but don&#39;t expect MASSIVE game<br/>
revisions at this point.<br/>

&gt;     Yeah, I also SERIOUSLY doubt they would cut off Halas. That would cut<br/>
off barbarians from training or reaching any of the needed things in their<br/>
home city! Also, I doubt that they even have the model for Lady Vox built<br/>
into the Everfrost zone, and therfore couldnt be roaming around heh. I guess<br/>
they could update it maybe? I dont really know enought about that stuff to<br/>
say though heh. They&#39;re prolly just gonna replace the goblins with some<br/>
other beasts or different faction of goblins and make the loot better in<br/>
there. And to trash Qeynos sure would be kewl, who goes there anyway? hehe.<br/>
That&#39;ld be another hug patch if they could do that also. Also seriously<br/>
doubt they would trash all those starting cities. Qeynos makes sense because<br/>
there is already one human starting city, and two if you kinda include<br/>
Surefall Glade.<br/>
