<b>Subject:</b> What&#39;s in a name (was Strange Story) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-757964140">Hmmm ... all my names in the order I recieved them<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer Carroll - birth<br/>
Lora Lynn Davis - legal adoption<br/>
Lora Lynn Hauser - illegal, unwanted alias<br/>
Lora Lynn Davis - back to me after correcting all but a few public school<br/>
records<br/>
Lora Lynn Roa - married, legally but told my name was illegal in NC!<br/>
<br/>
My illegal, unwanted alias was due to a stepfather who married my mother in<br/>
my teens, he was abusive (to all) and I moved out, but my mother insisted<br/>
on trying to &quot;make us a family&quot; by changing all my records to his last<br/>
name.  There was never an adoption, since he really didn&#39;t want a pair of<br/>
teenagers when he&#39;d think about it (can&#39;t blame him there!).<br/>
<br/>
I *still* don&#39;t have all my public school records back in my name, but I<br/>
got High School straight in time for graduation.  Its still fun to try and<br/>
go to a public school and try and tell them your legal name isn&#39;t what your<br/>
mother says it is!<br/>
<br/>
Just when I think its all over, and I&#39;m an adult and in control of my name,<br/>
I get married and having little attachment to the surname of my deceased<br/>
adopted father (and also I&#39;m told was abusive) I choose to take my husbands<br/>
surname, but keep my middle as it distinguishes me (Lora Lynn) from my<br/>
grandmother (Lora Ann, whom I was named for).  I changed it legally in SC<br/>
(I thought), then went to my bank in NC to change it there ...<br/>
<br/>
I was told that in NC there is a law stating that a married woman who takes<br/>
a new surname MUST use her maiden name as her middle name, or have 2 middle<br/>
names and according to them my name was illegal since I had dropped my<br/>
maiden name.  (?????)  It took me an hour and a long chat with the bank<br/>
manager before they&#39;d change my account to my new name!<br/>
<br/>
As an interesting side-note, all the straight male parental figures in my<br/>
life were there briefly and were abusive to some degree.  My &quot;uncles&quot;, the<br/>
gay couple (and thier friends) who were my more functional fathers, were<br/>
never abusive and the closest one continued his relationship with me<br/>
through three moves and until his death (the one who helped pay for my<br/>
education).  Which of course, runs counter to stereo-types as I&#39;ve had more<br/>
than one gay friend point out recently, but I already knew not to trust<br/>
stereo-types by then :P<br/>
