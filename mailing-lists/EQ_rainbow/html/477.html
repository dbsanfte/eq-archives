<div id="ygrps-yiv-56574129">I think it would be great to have more Mystical members on Brell.  Rather<br/>
than remove all of David&#39;s playing time in training everyone individually,<br/>
maybe we could have some kind of a newbie event where people who don&#39;t<br/>
already have characters make new ones and get trained by those of us who<br/>
are already on brell.  I&#39;ve done that kind of thing before, and it can be<br/>
fun and social.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to suggest to anyone that they leave their old server and<br/>
friends, but it can be fun to be on multiple servers as well.  If you&#39;re<br/>
playing on some other server every night, having a great time, then multi<br/>
server stuff may not be for you.  If you find you&#39;re getting a little<br/>
bored though, maybe trying out a fresh character on a fresh server might<br/>
be fun.<br/>
<br/>
I also think I mentioned before the idea of having an official &quot;guild<br/>
night&quot;.  The basic idea would be every Tuesday evening (or other randomly<br/>
chosen time) would be the official time to play on Brell with your<br/>
Mystical Alliance character.  This would allow easier grouping, more<br/>
chatting fun, etc.<br/>
