<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-837200910">Okay, now we have some interest in the get together. As I said in the first<br/>
post, we can get together and chat, have fun, whatever. After awhile, we can<br/>
go hunting a bit if we want.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have a character on Brell, just create one in the city of<br/>
Freeport (even though humans are not too pretty, hehe). If you already have a<br/>
Brell character and need assistance getting to Freeport, let me know. Binds<br/>
will be provided to those who want them.<br/>
<br/>
We will try to start at 1 PM Eastern, which is 10 AM Pacific. And it is<br/>
hopefully early enough for our European Rainbow members to join us too.<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t make it at that time, please just give me a tell anytime (Dedric,<br/>
gnome Necro) Saturday as I will be on probably all day.<br/>
<br/>
Many of you may have concerns about the newbie areas on Brell being crowded.<br/>
Now that the new regular server has opened, the Brell newbie areas are getting<br/>
thinned out. I do have to admit, it was a bit of a pain for awhile though. But<br/>
I hope those of you who left Brell for that reason will come back. I&#39;ll even<br/>
be willing to help you power level a little if you want.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you all in Norrath soon.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
David</div>
