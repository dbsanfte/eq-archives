<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-602425156">Its kinda quiet today here.. ? hhmm.. SO I am thinking.. This friday is the<br/>
13th right.. and the last friday the 13th they started the GM campaign with<br/>
the Undead king invading the Qeynos hills. I am thinking that they might<br/>
pull some of this fun stuff and weird happenings again. After all Even<br/>
Norrath has a Friday the 13th...<br/>
<br/>
For those not familiar.. In Qeynos hills, they had a GM run Undead King and<br/>
a whole slew of his minions were slaughtering the innocents that reside<br/>
there. High level mobs were killing all.. newbies dead .. this was fun so i<br/>
hear.. Unfortunantly we didnt&#39; get to see it on the Rodcet Nife yet.. unless<br/>
i missed it... but a bonus was that people who were killed during this<br/>
event, didn&#39;t lose experience.. after all you can&#39;t expect a newbie to come<br/>
close to even damaging a spectre or 35+skeletons.. etc..<br/>
<br/>
Just some intersting info.. i think I&#39;ll play as long as possible friday to<br/>
see .. where the mayhem occurs.. If it occurs of course.. Just hoping I<br/>
guess, cause ill go down and fight til the death.... I wish they did this<br/>
stuff more often.</div>
