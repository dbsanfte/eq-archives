<div id="ygrps-yiv-982794978">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
It was great to have 18 of us together on chat last night. Our efforts at a<br/>
replacement name were humorous if not productive.<br/>
<br/>
I had an idea for using a latin name for the guild.<br/>
<br/>
Gloriae et Liberatatae<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Gloriae&#39; means fame, renown, glory; glorius deeds.<br/>
&#39;et&#39; means and<br/>
Liberatatae means freedoms, liberty, independence.<br/>
<br/>
The initials would be GL (same as the initials for gay and lesbian. Also,<br/>
the B and the T in liberatatae could represent bisexual and transgender. I<br/>
just like the idea of having a hidden meaning, but one that we recognize and<br/>
remember as we think about the diversity of our own group. Kind of like the<br/>
meaning of each color of the rainbow flag.)<br/>
<br/>
The guild&#39;s name would also represent our own desires for personal and guild<br/>
glory. And the desire we have to be free and to make sure others are free<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Other names based in latin:<br/>
Pedes Genialis<br/>
<br/>
pedes - foot soldier<br/>
genialis - relating to enjoyment; joyful, gay.<br/>
<br/>
Pedes Liberti (soldiers of freedom)<br/>
<br/>
I know these sound militaristic, but after all, we do carry weapons and kill<br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
Societas De Sapho - Association Of Sapho<br/>
Societas De Genialis - Association of Enjoyment (joyful, gay)<br/>
Societas De Liberti - Association of Freedom<br/>
<br/>
I kind of like the idea of using something Latin, but at the same time I<br/>
want something that sounds good. Don&#39;t know if any of the above fit that.<br/>
What do you all think?????</div>
