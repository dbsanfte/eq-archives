&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bill: &quot;There are a few issues we need to discuss.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Contractor: &quot;Ah, you have our basic support option. Calls are<br/>
&gt; free for the first 90 days and $75 a call thereafter. Okay?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bill: &quot;Uh, yeah... the first issue is the living room. We<br/>
&gt; think it&#39;s a little smaller than we anticipated.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Contractor: &quot;Yeah. Some compromises were made to have it out<br/>
&gt; by the release date.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bill: &quot;We won&#39;t be able to fit all our furniture in there.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Contractor: &quot;Well, you have two options. You can purchase a<br/>
&gt; new, larger living room; or you can use a Stacker.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bill: &quot;Stacker?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Contractor: &quot;Yeah, it allows you to fit twice as much<br/>
&gt; furniture into the room. By stacking it, of course, you put<br/>
&gt; the entertainment center on the couch... the chairs on the<br/>
&gt; table... etc. You leave an empty spot, so when you want to use<br/>
&gt; some furniture you can unstack what you need and then put it<br/>
&gt; back when you&#39;re done.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bill: &quot;Uh... I dunno... issue two. The second issue is the<br/>
&gt; light fixtures. The bulbs we brought with us from our old home<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t fit. The threads run the wrong way.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Contractor: &quot;Oh! That&#39;s easy. Those bulbs aren&#39;t plug and<br/>
&gt; play. You&#39;ll have to upgrade to the new bulbs.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bill: &quot;And the electrical outlets? The holes are round, not<br/>
&gt; rectangular. How do I fix that?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Contractor: &quot;Just uninstall and reinstall the electrical<br/>
&gt; system.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bill: &quot;You&#39;re kidding!?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Contractor: &quot;Nope. Its the only way.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bill: &quot; Well... I have one last problem. Sometimes, when I<br/>
&gt; have guests over, someone will flush the toilet and it won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; stop. The water pressure drops so low that the showers don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; work.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Contractor: &quot;That&#39;s a resource leakage problem. One fixture is<br/>
&gt; failing to terminate and is hogging the resources preventing<br/>
&gt; access from other fixtures.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bill: &quot;And how do I fix that?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Contractor: &quot;Well, after each flush, you all need to exit the<br/>
&gt; house, turn off the water at the street, turn it back on,<br/>
&gt; reenter the house and then you can get back to work.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bill: &quot;That&#39;s the last straw. What kind of product are you<br/>
&gt; selling me?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Contractor: &quot;Hey, nobody&#39;s making you buy it.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bill: &quot;And when will this be fixed?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Contractor: &quot;Oh, in your next house -- which will be ready to<br/>
&gt; release sometime near the end of next year. It was due out<br/>
&gt; this year, but we&#39;ve had some delays...&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Quick Wit:<br/>
&gt; A blonde called the fire department.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She screams into the phone, &quot;Hurry, come quick! My house is on<br/>
&gt; fire.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The fire chief replied, &quot;OK, but how do we get to your house?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The blond said, &quot;Duh, Red Truck!&quot;<br/>
&gt; </span></blockquote></div>
