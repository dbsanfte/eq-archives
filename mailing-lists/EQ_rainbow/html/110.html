<div id="ygrps-yiv-249000238">Hey Reuben,<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to farm armor yourself, I recommend buying it from merchant<br/>
players.  You want gossamer/demask armor.  If you can&#39;t get that get<br/>
woven.  Concentrate on leveling and making money and you will be able to<br/>
get great armor for your magician.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have a runed totem staff, farm one from the gnoll shaman in <br/>
Lake Rathe, or buy one.  As for better staffs, i just don&#39;t know! I<br/>
usually buy most of my equipment rather than farm it.<br/>

&gt; Ok, I have a mage and I am looking to get better armour for him. Right now i<br/>
&gt; have a few mesh things, a collar of undead protection and the sr apprentice<br/>
&gt; robe (god i am going to be sad to actually have to get rid of this, cause it<br/>
&gt; is so cute). I am also a mini tank. I love to go out and pull and live close<br/>
&gt; to death on the regular basis. I have a good team, so i almost rarely die.<br/>
&gt; But as i do this, i also am going to need a little better protection for<br/>
&gt; myself and i feel so limited because i take more damage easily. .. SO can<br/>
&gt; anyone have any advice on what to get for my mage and where to get it. The<br/>
&gt; Stuff You get from GuK isn&#39;t much..its only benefit is it ways less. i hope<br/>
&gt; there is better..  I am level 15 right now and in dire need of help. .. oh<br/>
&gt; yeah.. what about the staffs ? like the crystal staff, water and slime staff<br/>
&gt; ? where are these located .. I am just looking for some advice<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ps. I am going to try to do the chat server guild thing wed. But my job<br/>
&gt; times fluxuate, so i might not get off work in time. i am PST so its going<br/>
&gt; to be tough.. but i will do my best for my family..<br/>
