<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874345583">yes, you are doing well, you have to imagine, we are a minority as is and <br/>
now we are playing a game where we are a SUPER minority IMO if you have 7 to <br/>
10 or more poeple on at the same time on avrage then that is a large guild <br/>
for a GLBT guild!! keep up the good work, i just wish i could abandon my <br/>
main to be able to play on a server with a GLBT guild but i just cant bring <br/>
myself to do it, i will play my alt on rodcet nife rarely but when i do i <br/>
enjoy it<br/>

&gt; &gt;Yes I believe Rodcet is the largest collection of players<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m curious what a &quot;large collection&quot; means in &quot;gay EQ&quot; terms.  I keep <br/>
&gt;trying<br/>
&gt;to compare our new guild with the uber-guilds on The Nameless server and of<br/>
&gt;course we come up short.  But we usually have around 4 people online, with <br/>
&gt;as<br/>
&gt;many as 10.  Last weekend, I think, we grouped with our guildfriends (The<br/>
&gt;Nameless of Mercy) at SolA and we had enough people to completely fill 2<br/>
&gt;party groups.  I think that&#39;s an exceptional headcount for a guild that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;still less than half a year old.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Cure my feelings of inadequacy as guildleader.  Tell me we&#39;re doing well on<br/>
&gt;the &quot;headcount&quot; test.  Heh.<br/>
