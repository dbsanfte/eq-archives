<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345238358">I don&#39;t actually believe that name and charted need to be directly<br/>
related.  I don&#39;t believe that the name must imply the charter, though it<br/>
can.  I also don&#39;t believe our guild necessarily requires an intense, role<br/>
playing, charter.  We&#39;re all drawn together because we&#39;re LGBT, not<br/>
because beyond that we share the same focus or interests in terms of role<br/>
playing style.<br/>

&gt; I think you have some good ideas here but i would like to know what you<br/>
&gt; would want our &quot;charter&quot; to say with all these different names.  the<br/>
&gt; charter is going to be just as important as the name...what would they be<br/>
&gt; in these cases?<br/>
