<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439089904">I&#39;ve been trying the past 2 weeks to get a chapter of &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; set up<br/>
on Innoruuk. I&#39;m told that only one GM (one that works for Verant) on the<br/>
whole server can do it for me (yet tons of GMs who can&#39;t help my petition,<br/>
Need to be set up as GM of Mystic Alliance guild, respond and then tell me<br/>
they can&#39;t do a thing for me, go figure). I&#39;m told he&#39;s only on weeknights EST<br/>
which is when I usually play anyway, I&#39;ve actually seen him on twice, but not<br/>
for long, though I&#39;m sure he goes invisible often.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m still trying to get the guild set up on Innoruuk. Last I know I<br/>
was the only one who voluntered for the position (and probably even plays on<br/>
that server! heh). But if you happen to stop on look me up.<br/>
