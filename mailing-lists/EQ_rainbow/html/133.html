<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585565607">they did fix the sneak/hide skills they now tell you if you hid or snuck<br/>
successfully. (eg: if yuou fail sneak it says &quot;you are as quiet as a<br/>
herd of runing elephants&quot; and if you make it it says &quot;you are as quiet<br/>
as a cat stalking its prey&quot;) plus you can now sneak and hide at the same<br/>
time so it is really great   just thought i should let you know<br/>

&gt; I hope this finds all of you doing well:) Basically I&#39;ll sending this<br/>
&gt; down because I maybe starting a new character on Brell. I like my<br/>
&gt; Rogue but as of this new patch they still havnt done anything about<br/>
&gt; fixing sneak/hide so they work well (like on the Test Server). Yes<br/>
&gt; its nice they did something about our Poison skills (they&#39;ll probably<br/>
&gt; be royally screwed up at first;) but honestly the class needs help<br/>
&gt; and the stealth thing was a step in the right direction. I guess<br/>
&gt; someone at Verant must REALLY hate Rogues...<br/>
&gt; Sorry, I&#39;m disgruntled;)<br/>
&gt; Anyway I was thinking of giving an Enchanter a spin, only class I<br/>
&gt; really havnt played besides Magician. And if they ever implement<br/>
&gt; enchanting weapons it would definatly be a good skill Guild-wise.<br/>
&gt; He&#39;ll probably be a High Elf with a name like Timarius (because of<br/>
&gt; my twisted sense of humour;), if your not a Monty Python fan you<br/>
&gt; may not get that:)<br/>
&gt; Anyway just dropping you all a line, take care:)<br/>
