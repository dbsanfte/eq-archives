  I thought at first the artists were suffering from secual deprivation <br/>
when<br/>
  the females got created, I mean they are rather skimpy.  Still I <br/>
think the<br/>
  wood elf men, barbarians and monks are pretty nice as well.  <br/>
However its<br/>
  rather academic as I play for the fun not the cartoons :)  <br/>
<br/>
I definatly would have to agree here, I find the females ridculous in <br/>
the extreme, and to <br/>
any who think I maybe a bit biased (and you&#39;d be right;) I would say <br/>
the same if the men <br/>
ran around in skimpy chip&#39;n&#39;dales leather thongs and spiked <br/>
braclets;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  dont know who is playing the character - male playing female, <br/>
vice-versa,<br/>
  a kid an old man, a young girl, a handsome movei star, a beer <br/>
guzzling<br/>
  crack addict - so you just go by the character itself and dont <br/>
worry about<br/>
  who is behind it as long as the character they play is a decent <br/>
person to<br/>
  be with.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Actually I&#39;ve been thinking of starting an EQ onelist for bear <br/>
guzzling crack addicts, any <br/>
takers?;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  want sex chat the web is absoulutely loaded with it :)  The only <br/>
way it<br/>
  would be nice is in the actual framework of the game - ie like <br/>
amzaon<br/>
  women, soldier *buddies*, a love affair,  a stray encoutner with a<br/>
  minotaur hehe<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WHOAH YEAH!! Um, er, nevermind;)<br/>
<br/>
