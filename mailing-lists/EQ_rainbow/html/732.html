<div id="ygrps-yiv-58560746">Hi and nice to meet you all!<br/>
<br/>
I have just today subscribed to &quot;EQ_Rainbow&quot; on the recomendation of <br/>
a friend Lora whos been with the list for about a year.<br/>
<br/>
Having recently left Luclin server where me and Lora met each other <br/>
we have started new characters on Terris-Thule. Now we have both <br/>
played EQ for a long while and have had chars on various other <br/>
servers prior to Luclin.... yada yada, I&#39;m babbling.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, we have only just started fresh on Terris and Lora mentioned <br/>
that there are people currently moving to Rodcet Nife starting again <br/>
also. This has me curious and we are considering it.<br/>
<br/>
Basically I just wanted the name of the guild there and a contact I <br/>
could get in touch with to have a chat with about it all. I&#39;d <br/>
appreciate someone to show us around so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
I can be reached on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:swin@...">swin@...</a> if anyone feels the urge <br/>
to send me some details. =)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
Hugs and kisses<br/>

&gt; Not sure if it was mentioned on EQ_Rainbow, but last night we had a <br/>
big<br/>
&gt; Mystic Alliance guild event on Rodcet Nife. It was called MegaPlat <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; consisted of a lottery (the grand prize was 665 plat) and raffles <br/>
of various<br/>
&gt; items (armor, jewelry, weapons, etc.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We had around 20 guild members on at the same time and that set a <br/>
record for<br/>
&gt; us, I believe. A lot of people have been moving over to the Rodcet <br/>
server<br/>
&gt; and this event was a great way for them to get some nice equipment.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Joe and Rob did a great job of coordinating and running the event. <br/>
Thanks<br/>
&gt; guys.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If anyone else wants to create characters on Rodcet, we invite you <br/>
to come<br/>
&gt; join us. We&#39;ll be happy to help you out as you start new <br/>
characters. We&#39;re<br/>
&gt; quickly making Rodcet the San Francisco of Norrath and you are <br/>
welcome to<br/>
&gt; join the fun.<br/>
