<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346915196">The following are some interesting naming &#39;coincidences&#39; found in EQ....<br/>
<br/>
People<br/>
Bait Masterson is found in East Freeport where he spawns on the shore near<br/>
the rock in the middle of the water. His name is a reference to William<br/>
Barclay &quot;Bat&quot; Masterson, the American frontier lawman known for his good<br/>
looks and ivory-handled pistols. This Bait, however, seems only interested<br/>
in fishing...<br/>
Some people have suggested a less-than-honourable reason for the name -<br/>
claiming that he must have become a master at his chosen profession of<br/>
baiting - however, I chose to ignore that one.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
In HighKeep, there was a High-Elven princess being kept captive. She has<br/>
since been moved to somewhere... else... Her name is Princess Lenya. When<br/>
she was still a resident, if you hailed her, she said &quot;Aren&#39;t you a little<br/>
short for a High Keep Guard?&quot; There is still a &quot;Princess Lenia&quot; in a jail<br/>
cell downstairs - but she&#39;s a little different...<br/>
Anyway, her name (and her comment) referred to Princess Leia in Star Wars.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Guards Regis and Philbin in the Qeynos Hills area. These both refer to Regis<br/>
Philbin, popular daytime TV host.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
In South Karana, you&#39;ll find a Bard at the fountain named Vhalen which could<br/>
be interpreted as an abbreviation for Van Halen, a rock and roll band.<br/>
Others have suggested &quot;Valen&quot; - a character from the popular Science Fiction<br/>
television show &quot;Babylon Five&quot; - however, in light of his musical nature,<br/>
I&#39;m sticking with the first interpretation. That, and his comments - see the<br/>
next egg....<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Vhalen also has some interesting things to say about a bard named &quot;Metala&quot; -<br/>
perhaps a rivalry between Van Halen and Metallica?<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Speaking of Metallica, check out the two Barbarians in West Karanas - Lars<br/>
and Ulrich. Lars Ulrich is the drummer for the Napster-hating band.<br/>
Thanks to John Herrington, Kortalh Rhufoniog and Robbie Bemrich<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Once upon a time, Fire Beatles roamed just outside of Freeport. Sadly, they,<br/>
like their namesakes, are no more. Perhaps there will be a reunion tour?<br/>
Thanks to Drax<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
A bard merchant in Freeport is named Jekel Enheid - like &quot;Dr. Jekell and Mr.<br/>
Hyde&quot;, a novel by Robert Louis Stevenson.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Cubert, the Gelatinous Cube underneath Qeynos, is a reference to a popular<br/>
arcade game during the 80&#39;s: Q-Bert.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Lake Rathetear has a Prince Kyrmt Keroppi - the frogluk. Kin to Kermit the<br/>
Frog, perhaps? Plus, his title, Prince, suggests the Frog Prince of<br/>
fairytale fame - feel like kissing a frog anyone? Also, Keroppi is the name<br/>
of one of Hello Kitty&#39;s friends, who just happens to be a frog. A triple<br/>
pun! (thanks to far too many people to note here)<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
In North Karana, a giant wanders around by the name of Timber the Tiny. A<br/>
reference to Tiny Tim, the very unusual musician made famous for his ukelele<br/>
and falsetto performances. Made more humourous by the apparent forgetfulness<br/>
of the Giant (judging by what he drops). I wonder if he &quot;tiptoes through the<br/>
tulips&quot; in his sandals? Of course, there is also a &quot;Tiny Tim&quot; in Charles<br/>
Dickens&#39; &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; but I hardly see the relevance...<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Silly Bard names! You&#39;ve seen them everywhere - but where oh where is the<br/>
oft-rumoured Fabian? His real-life namesake was a popular singer in the<br/>
Fifties and early Sixties. But much like his namesake, he is nowhere to be<br/>
seen now.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
At the very bottom of Ak&#39;anon, they have a scrapyard, and who should<br/>
maintain that Scrapyard but one Sanfyrd Montop (his name has recently<br/>
changed to Sanfyrd Featherhead for a Ranger quest, but Ak&#39;anon quest<br/>
messages still refer to the old name). This is quite possibly an homage to<br/>
that lovable cantankerous old coot, salvage-yard owner Fred Sanford, as seen<br/>
on &quot;Sanford and Son,&quot; a sitcom during the 70&#39;s. Added trivia bonus: Fred<br/>
Sanford was played by Redd Foxx, whose real name was John Elroy Sanford.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
In Kedge Keep, two high-powered sharks go by the names of &quot;Cauldronboil&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Cauldronbubble&quot; - reference&#39;s to Shakespeare&#39;s MacBeth.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
In Kithicor Forest, three named tigers can be found by the names of Reggit,<br/>
Eenot, and Hobbes(?) - apparently plays on three famous tigers: Tigger, Tony<br/>
and Hobbes from Calvin and Hobbes.<br/>
Thanks to John Beckemeier<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
By the shore of the lake in the West Commonlands sits a lonely man skipping<br/>
stones. His name? Skippyn Stoneshear. (&quot;Skipping Stones Here&quot;). Someone buy<br/>
him a fishing pole, so he has something else to do.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
The Gnomes of Steamfont are no less free from punsters - just watch that<br/>
dirty little backstabbing Feddi Dooger - which some have said is a reference<br/>
to that horror-film villain, Freddy Krueger. I guess he&#39;s a real nightmare<br/>
to the younguns.<br/>
Thanks to John Herrington and Kevin Miller<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Also in Steamfont, you will find a lovely little clockwork spider named<br/>
Charlotte - after the title spider in Charlotte&#39;s Web.<br/>
Thanks to Garon Galloway<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
In Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, there are two rats by the names of Flotsam and<br/>
Jetsam - methinks they escaped a sinking ship somewhere... (Flotsam refers<br/>
to any wreckage left in the sea after a shipwreck, while jetsam is any cargo<br/>
deliberately thrown overboard and washed ashore or sunk.) Incidentally,<br/>
these also happen to be the names of the two electric eels who harassed<br/>
Ariel in Disney&#39;s &quot;The Little Mermaid.&quot;<br/>
In another possible nod to Metallica (or perhaps just coincidence) Flotsam<br/>
and Jetsam was also the name of a band - one of their former members (Jason<br/>
Newsted) is now Metallica&#39;s bassist.<br/>
Thanks to Kelton Lightforge, Scott Salyers, Toreck Troublemaker, Mark<br/>
Ellister and Eric Statlander<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Highkeep sports an unusually large number of strange names for guards. Stop<br/>
by and visit with Chopin and Bach (in the music room) Bolton (Michael&#39;s<br/>
cousin?), Antilles (Wedge! I gotcher back!), and Duras (which some say is<br/>
phonetic for &quot;Guard Yer ass&quot; - No, I don&#39;t think this was a reference to<br/>
Klingons). You can also visit the prison, where you may see Guards Handy and<br/>
Chin (Chin guard, hand guard).<br/>
Thanks to Megtilia Drunkshadow, Scott Ervin and others<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
The desert of South Ro has some pretty dry humour, too - check out the Sand<br/>
Giant &quot;Hassan&quot; - a reference to a classic Warner Brother&#39;s character...<br/>
&quot;Hasan.... CHOP!&quot;<br/>
Thanks to Ninvaen<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Sirran the Lunatic, a Halfling in the Plane of Sky, is said to be an anagram<br/>
of a GM - Narris the Lunatic the Halfling GM.<br/>
Thanks to Josh Ward<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
The West Karanas also boasts Sir Loin. Beef. It&#39;s what&#39;s for dinner.<br/>
Thanks to Marcus J Witt<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Another resident of the Plane of Air, this one is much more rare (ooo -<br/>
poetry!). His name is Nottap Ekim - which is Mike Patton, from Faith No<br/>
More, spelled backwards.<br/>
Thanks to William A Stubbs<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, they say. So, apparently, are bad<br/>
puns. Two of the Beholders in the Gorge of King Xorbb are named &quot;Syrkl&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Sviir&quot; - or Circle and Sphere. Also, Xorbb could be interpreted as &quot;Orb&quot; -<br/>
another round joke...<br/>
Thanks to Bridget<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Here&#39;s one for the &quot;truly obscure&quot; category - In Qeynos, near the city<br/>
gates, stands a man by the name of Tubal Weaver. He is terribly greedy and<br/>
overcharges horribly, and doesn&#39;t pay nearly enough for goods. In<br/>
Shakespeare&#39;s The Merchant of Venice, there is a similarly stingy and<br/>
dishonest fellow, also by the name of Tubal...<br/>
Thanks to Maben Wolfbrother<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Now, I haven&#39;t verified this one, but it is said that there are two guards<br/>
on the stone bridge in North Karana - the one on the East being named<br/>
Oistyn, and the West being Westyn.<br/>
Thanks to Scott Salyers<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Even the newly discovered outpost of Firiona Vie isn&#39;t safe from rampaging<br/>
puns - the bankers there are known as Wella and Wellford Fargin.<br/>
Predecessors to the great Wells Fargo, perchance?<br/>
Thanks to Karisma Swiftarrow<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Garrison Keillor makes his appearance in Neriak, in the form of Guard<br/>
G&#39;Noir - which is possibly a play on &quot;Guy Noir&quot; - a character in his famous<br/>
&quot;Prairie Home Companion.&quot;<br/>
Thanks to Tszaaz E&#39;Taurguin<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Places<br/>
My personal favourite for simplicity has got to be Qeynos. Spelled<br/>
backwards, it&#39;s SonyEQ.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
The Gods must be crazy - or at least, the people who made them are; their<br/>
names are FULL of anagrams.<br/>
Fennin Ro (from the Plane of Fire) = Infernno (yes, slightly misspelled)<br/>
The Rathe (from the Plane of Earth) = The Earth<br/>
Xegony (from the Plane of Air) = Oxygen<br/>
Veeshan (child of Xegony, ruler of the sky) = Heavens<br/>
Tarew Marr (from the Plane of Water) = Water, Marr is similar to Mare, Latin<br/>
for &quot;sea&quot;.<br/>
Povar (from the Plane of Water) = Vapor<br/>
E&#39;ci (from the Plane of Water) = Ice<br/>
Rodcet Nife (God of Healing) = Docter Fine (again mispelled).<br/>
Thanks to Ioshua and Tennian<br/>
&quot;Paging Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard...&quot;<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
The full name for &quot;Unrest&quot; is &quot;The Estate of Unrest&quot; - or &quot;A state of<br/>
unrest,&quot; which one could say all of the residents are in.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
In Blackburrow, (and possibly other zones) you can see a fossilized &quot;Alien&quot;<br/>
skeleton in the walls. Somehow, I think Ripley would approve.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Apparently one of the programmers wanted to immortalize his cat. In an area<br/>
underneath Befallen (a place only GMs go normally, however players and some<br/>
mobs sometimes end up there as well), you will see the head of this<br/>
programmer&#39;s cat.<br/>
As an added bonus, I&#39;ve been told that this cat&#39;s name is Mitty - which just<br/>
also happens to be the name of a Kerran (cat-person) in Erud&#39;s Crossing.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
The Innothule swamp is easy enough to figure out - Innoruuk + Cazic-Thule =<br/>
Innothule. Love this new math ;)<br/>
Thanks to Thomas Skaggs and Void* of Fennin Ro<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
In Neriak, there&#39;s a store called the Silk Underground. It&#39;s just possible<br/>
that this is a reference to the Velvet Underground, a popular band in the<br/>
eighties(?).<br/>
Thanks to J Branch<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
In the Qeynos sewers there is graffiti that says &#39;Aradune is stinky&#39; I<br/>
wonder if Brad knew about this ahead of time?<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
In nearly every inn and tavern across Norrath, there is a picture of<br/>
&quot;things&quot; playing poker - where the things are a play on the name of the<br/>
place. For example, Crow&#39;s in Qeynos has crows playing poker, while Tassel&#39;s<br/>
in Freeport has tassels playing poker. They are a tribute to the famous<br/>
&quot;Dogs Playing Poker&quot; series of paintings by Cassius Marcellus Coolidge<br/>
(circa 1910&#39;s).<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Remote Halas, home of the Barbarians, is still not remote enough to be safe<br/>
from the ego of at least on programmer. Belly up to McQuaid&#39;s Bar for a<br/>
bottle of smug, or a shot of gloat.<br/>
Thanks to Tamboran Ratamacue, History Filidh of the Soerbaird<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Paineel is also rife with humour - check out Good Iva&#39;s Sweets (like Godiva<br/>
Chocolates...) To bad there&#39;s not a naked lady on a horse there...<br/>
Thanks to Josh Ward<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Also in Paineel, there&#39;s the Bank called &quot;The Dead Reckoning.&quot; Now, this<br/>
term has two meanings - the older refers to navigating in heavy fog (perhaps<br/>
a &quot;fog bank?&quot;), while the more recent has to do with a programming technique<br/>
to reduce lag. Whether that is present in the game remains to be seen.<br/>
Thanks to Gruns Spreke<br/>
<br/>
Things<br/>
In Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, there are four NPC&#39;s that hang around a campsite. When<br/>
the High Elf in the party attacks, he shouts &quot;Fabulous Four, attack!&quot; The<br/>
Dwarf in the party attacks, he says, &quot;It&#39;s bashing time!&quot;<br/>
Thanks in part to Steve Bryson<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
The runes on the side of the Qeynos watchtower can be translated - but you<br/>
have to know runic, and they&#39;re spelled backwards. The inside ring spells<br/>
out Qeynos, while the outer ring spells out Ak&#39;anon Gnomes.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
The phrase to say to Kizdean Gix to get the note for Lrodd is &quot;utalk adarev<br/>
otcin&quot;. This is a misspelling of the quote from the movie, &quot;The Day the<br/>
Earth Stood Still.&quot; The words spelled backwards are &quot;klatu verada nicto&quot;,<br/>
which is close to the actual quote: &quot;Klaatu barada nikto&quot;. Now, I&#39;ve gotten<br/>
about a million &quot;corrections&quot; to this - *YES*, Ash, did say it in &quot;Army of<br/>
Darkness.&quot; But Sam Raimi, writer/producer/director of the whole &quot;Evil Dead&quot;<br/>
series, got it from &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Klaatu borada n... Necktie... Nickel... It&#39;s an &quot;N&quot; word, it&#39;s definitely<br/>
an &quot;N&quot; word!&quot;<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
In South Karana, you will find a Putrid Skeleton that says &quot;Never<br/>
fear...Smyth isss...Here!!&quot; This, of course, being a reference to Dr.<br/>
Smith&#39;s line in &quot;Lost in Space,&quot; the movie.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Charm a griffon. Tell it /pet sit down. Laugh. Incidentally, this also works<br/>
with numerous other mobs. Go ahead, have a charming day ;)<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
If you kill lizardmen in the Lost Temple of Cazic-Thule, you get faction<br/>
adjustments with two strange groups: &quot;Allize Taeew&quot; and &quot;Allize Volew&quot;.<br/>
Backwards they&#39;re &quot;We love Zilla&quot; and &quot;We eate Zilla&quot;. Hrm. Little spelling<br/>
problem there ;) My assumption is that they refer to the Godzilla - a really<br/>
large lizard. You can find a nearly-life size replica in the Ocean of<br/>
Tears - going by the name of Allizewasaur.<br/>
Thanks to Brandon Baker and Deene Crystalis!<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Lady Shae, who hangs out in Hogcaller&#39;s Inn in West Freeport, would like to<br/>
know what [house] you are in. Tell her you&#39;re from the International House<br/>
of Pancakes... She says, &quot;I can tell, it looks like you ate a house of<br/>
pancakes!&quot;<br/>
Thanks to Sean Rhea and Andrew Kugelstadt!<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Who would have thought TWO people would have invented the oh-so-tasty treat,<br/>
&quot;Lizard-on-a-stick&quot;? No one - that&#39;s why it&#39;s an inside joke! But if you&#39;ve<br/>
ever played Fallout or Fallout 2, you are probably familiar with this<br/>
amazing delicacy.<br/>
Thanks to Grnadd Fleshwound - whom I believe invented the recipe ;)<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Dill Fireshine is obviously a fan of the Fire Beatles - after all, he calls<br/>
the Crushbone Orcs &quot;Blue meanies&quot; - which just happens to be the same name<br/>
as the creatures the Beatles are fleeing in the movie &quot;The Yellow<br/>
Submarine.&quot;<br/>
Thanks to Nils Hedglin!<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Gearheart, a gnomish clockwork in Lesser Faydark, must be a big Lost in<br/>
Space fan - when he attacks, he shouts &quot;Danger, Princess Jolina, Danger!&quot;<br/>
Thanks to Vexxor!<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
This one is very much not-confirmed, but I am told that there are a two<br/>
NPCs, a female Barbarian, Lenka Stoutheart, and Bronto Thudfoot, her male<br/>
Ogre Paladin companion, who speak of making the &quot;Kunark Run&quot; in their<br/>
vessel, the &quot;Blue Beast.&quot; The way they speak of it is reminiscent of Han<br/>
Solo&#39;s comments about the Millenium Falcon in &quot;Star Wars IV: A New Hope.&quot;<br/>
Incidentally, I recently saw them in Firiona Vie, as well, so I guess they<br/>
DO make the run!<br/>
Thanks to Kailyn Longstride and R├®mi Tippetts<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Guard Cheslin in the Qeynos Hills is a bit of an irresponsible lout - always<br/>
dropping his cards all over the place. You see, it seems that he plays a<br/>
game called &quot;Illusion&quot; - which is similar to &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; - even<br/>
down to the names. A couple of examples: Ebon Lotus = Black Lotus, and<br/>
Library of Erud = Library of Alexandria.<br/>
Thanks to Somaa Vayu<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Rivervale Deputies are right proud of their duds - in fact, if you<br/>
complement them (&quot;Nice hat!&quot; or &quot;Nice mask!&quot;) they&#39;ll tell you just how<br/>
proud!<br/>
Thanks to Demitri0<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------</div>
