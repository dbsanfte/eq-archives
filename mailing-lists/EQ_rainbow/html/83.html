<b>Subject:</b> Wonderful Welcome!  And as promised ... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-701692142">Whew.  I was a bit nervous how that would turn out ... thanks all!  Guys<br/>
and the gals who turned up after my post! :)<br/>
<br/>
As promised, here&#39;s what I play and where, as well as a one-liner on thier<br/>
personalities (since I do RP them, you&#39;ll know what to expect out of the IC<br/>
character), and thier best role in a party.<br/>
<br/>
On Erollisi:<br/>
HONESTY /Half-Elf Paladin/Mithaniel Marr/Freeport/L5<br/>
 My Joan of Arcish truth, honesty justice, &quot;Truth is not Kind&quot;.  Great tank<br/>
and loves the job.<br/>
<br/>
STARLING /Wood Elf Bard/Bristebane/Freeport/L7<br/>
 The drunken party Bard! Master brewer, should always some brew on her.<br/>
Better support Bard than tank, but has good armor and can tank.<br/>
<br/>
On Brell: ( all are L2-3 ... maybe 1 or 2 at 4th by late tonight)    <br/>
<br/>
BOMBOM /Ogress Warrior/Rallos Zek/Ogguk<br/>
  Not evil, just HUNGRY!  Big girl needs a lot of food.  She would work in<br/>
a good group as long as someone could shout &quot;Bombom NOT food!&quot; when she<br/>
started drooling at the halflings ;P  She&#39;s also a female chauvanist.  I&#39;m<br/>
experimenting with my aggressive part here, and love it :)  Tank supreme.<br/>
<br/>
DECEIT /Dark Elf Enchanter/Agnostic/Neriak<br/>
  Mistress of Illusion.  Neutral to Evil.  Conquering the world through<br/>
hate is a waste of energy when you can charm them into your slaves.<br/>
Buff/debuff mage suport.<br/>
<br/>
MELODIE /Human Bard/Quellios/Qeynos<br/>
  Lore and exploration specialist, fighting Bard.  Good to Neutral.  Spare<br/>
Tank and buffs and utility songs, mild healing by 6th.<br/>
<br/>
SHADE /Dark Elf Necromancer/Innoruuk/Neriak<br/>
  Death and destruction for Innoruuk! (my bad girl) ;), Evil, won&#39;t fit in<br/>
a good group. Magical damage and some healing.<br/>
<br/>
SHIRI /Erudian Wizard/Solusek Ro/Erudin<br/>
  Seeker of arcane knowlege and power with the dignity and serenity of an<br/>
African Queen.  Good to neutral.  Magic Firepower supreme.<br/>
<br/>
STORMI /Human Magician/Karana/Qeynos<br/>
  A generous helper of any who need help.  Good.  Charity and helping<br/>
others are good.  Magical firepower and utility item support.<br/>
<br/>
ANNWAN /Human Monk/Quellious/Freeport<br/>
  From the Chinese An - nuan, peaceful woman, warm and generous.  Good,<br/>
kind, and subservient female.  Tank.<br/>
<br/>
Bombom my daughter helps with and we have a blast :)  Annwan will be a<br/>
stretch for me ... I&#39;m *anything* but a subservient woman in real life.<br/>
Should be interesting to try that role. :P<br/>
<br/>
I have an open slot too.  Feel free to say hello and group if you see any<br/>
of them :)  Or if you just want to round out a group with one of the above<br/>
classes, send a tell.  Under L10, I can travel Erudin-Qeynos-Karanas-Halas<br/>
or Freeport-Faydark-Riverdale-Ro-Innothule.  Melodie and Deceit will<br/>
probably be able to go anywhere by L6 and L4 respectively .. so maybe even<br/>
this weekend those two could go to anywhere on request.  <br/>
<br/>
Guild or no guild, I&#39;m around and since this group is part of my normal<br/>
life ... you know you can be yourselves if I&#39;m in an EQ group.  I&#39;m all for<br/>
any guild that&#39;s anti-harassment (IMHO we&#39;ve got more than enough of that<br/>
in the real world).  As per Christina&#39;s post I wouldn&#39;t be a good person to<br/>
run a guild, and will defer to the sensitivities of the GBLT&#39;s here on any<br/>
name.  But I can be involved and offer moral support as needed :)<br/>
