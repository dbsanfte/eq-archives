<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992114708">I used to use the word &#39;gay&#39; in the derrogatory sense when I was in high<br/>
school.  I grew up in a little town in Virginia (my graduating class was<br/>
about 70 people), and even here it was in common usage--or should I say,<br/>
common misuage (with much emphasis on the vulgar connotations of common).<br/>
This was back in--ugh, here I go feeling my age again--the late &#39;80s (I<br/>
graduated in &#39;89).  I honestly didn&#39;t know the real meaning of it at the<br/>
beginning of my misuse of it.  It was pretty synonymous with &#39;stupid&#39;.<br/>
Saying things like, &#39;that&#39;s so gay!&#39; or &#39;you&#39;re so gay!&#39;, you could just as<br/>
easily switch out the two words.  Toward the end of my high school career,<br/>
the real meaning became more clear to me.  I knew &#39;gays&#39; were different and<br/>
not to be liked, and you sure didn&#39;t want to hang out with any.  There was a<br/>
kid who was a friend of mine through school that everyone called gay.  He<br/>
dated a girl, but it just seemed for show.  To fit in, I began calling him<br/>
gay as an insult behind his back, only this time I used it knowing more<br/>
clearly what it meant, making my use of it all the more insidious.  This<br/>
happened gradually, the transformation of the word&#39;s meaning.  The initial<br/>
erroneous use of it, however, made the newer, hateful, use of it that much<br/>
more easy; it was already a part of my vocabulary as an insult.  My friend<br/>
never discovered my spurious nature.  He came out officially after leaving<br/>
our hometown.  I&#39;ve since made efforts to reconnect with him.<br/>
<br/>
All the time I was growing up, I fought against an increasing knowledge of<br/>
myself, that I, too, was gay.  Using it in this hateful manner, in my<br/>
peer-pressured and confused mind, separated me from &#39;gays&#39;.  By opposing it<br/>
or them, I was placed on the safe side and couldn&#39;t be accused.  I<br/>
understood nothing then, and being in a small town, there was little<br/>
opportunity to expand my understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Breaking the habit was hard, and I didn&#39;t start until I was in college.  I<br/>
realized more then, outside of the confines of my hometown&#39;s provincial<br/>
mindset, particularly about myself.  It took a bit to fix my usage.  Besides<br/>
the misuse being just plain mean, it was also flat-out ignorant of my first<br/>
language, and being an English major and a writer, that just was<br/>
unnacceptable!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, even today, that habitual inclination rises during moments of<br/>
upset to insert the word gay as an insult.  It&#39;s struck down before<br/>
utterance, but it goes to show how things that one learns while young can<br/>
stick with you throughout your life, and why teaching a child early can<br/>
forestall the building of a subconscious prejudice.  I had two VERY<br/>
compelling reasons to change my ways.  There are a lot more people out there<br/>
who have neither reason, and probably don&#39;t even realize deep-down they have<br/>
a forgotten bedrock of ignorance informing on their outlook.<br/>

  As a resident breeder, I can tell you its not just l33t d00dz who use<br/>
&quot;gay&quot;<br/>
  in such a context.  It has become part of the general all-purpose &quot;kid<br/>
  slang&quot; and is used as early as first grade.  And I can date it back to at<br/>
  least 4 years ago.  When we moved into town off our isolated farm .. our<br/>
  oldest kid was then a 3rd grader.  She came home after the first couple of<br/>
  weeks of school and asked me what &quot;gay&quot; meant.  When I raised my eyebrows<br/>
at<br/>
  her a bit (sure she&#39;s precocious but asking that at barely eight?), she<br/>
told<br/>
  me it was used as a general purpose insult and she wanted to know what it<br/>
  meant.  To give her credit, she was introduced to &quot;cuss&quot; words in context<br/>
  (we use them well at home), and taught to check out the appropriateness of<br/>
  any new words and thier meaning so she will pick the proper times to use<br/>
the<br/>
  word (and so I won&#39;t get any phone calls from school that my kid told the<br/>
  teacher &quot;Fuck you bitch!&quot; - hehe)   The end of our discussion was her not<br/>
  using the word herself in that context and socially bashing the kids who<br/>
  did.  A year later, as she got to know other kids better, she realized<br/>
  another girl in our neighborhood her age has a &quot;gay&quot; (lesbian) aunt.  Now<br/>
  the two girls are fairly well known for deriding any who use &quot;gay&quot; in that<br/>
  context in school.<br/>
<br/>
  I would bet that almost ALL the kids using it at that age had no clue of<br/>
its<br/>
  meaning to an adult.  I fault the adults for not correcting them ... but<br/>
if<br/>
  they are using it from first grade up .. good luck getting them to break<br/>
te<br/>
  habit as a teen.  Even if, as a teen, they understand the meaning and<br/>
  insensitivity of that usage.  That has been the response of several teens<br/>
  whom after I verbally smacked them about for using &quot;gay&quot;.   - &quot;Owww I<br/>
agree,<br/>
  but its going to be VERY hard to break the habit&quot;.  I have seen children<br/>
who<br/>
  are otherwise well-behaved elementary schoolers using the word.  The only<br/>
  difference was that the well-parented ones, once the parent had been told<br/>
I<br/>
  found the word offensive (and that thier seven year old was spouting out<br/>
  &quot;gay&quot; with no idea what it meant - hehe) .. those children have stopped<br/>
  using it when adults are present.   But in middle and high school, its use<br/>
  is still common ...<br/>
<br/>
  I was on Brell, and most of us that were active in the defunct MA chapter<br/>
  there have moved to Rodcet.  But, I&#39;d expect the slang to be everywhere on<br/>
  all servers.<br/>
<br/>
  - Lora<br/>
  proud parent of a middle-schooler with an excellent repetoire of &quot;words&quot;,<br/>
  and she knows when to use them and when not, and what each and every one<br/>
of<br/>
  them means - muhahahah!<br/>

  &gt; I&#39;m 33. I started RPG-ing in 1980 with D&D and Gamma World. I was<br/>
  &gt; away from RPG&#39;s for many years and even now EQ is my only RPG outlet.<br/>
  &gt; I played Magic: The Gathering for a while but it simply became too<br/>
  &gt; frickin expensive and, to me, pointless. When? When did the<br/>
  &gt; word &quot;gay&quot; become -- in the gaming crowd (which now seems to be made<br/>
  &gt; up of teeming hordes of 13 yr old boys with a lot of their parents&#39;<br/>
  &gt; money and No Clue) -- synonymous<br/>
  &gt; with &quot;lame&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;useless&quot;, &quot;weak&quot; and just about any and every<br/>
  &gt; other negative adjective?<br/>
