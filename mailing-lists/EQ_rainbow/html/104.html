<div id="ygrps-yiv-959637199">Hello Jamie,<br/>
I live in North Carolina in Charlotte, just over the line from SC.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is for the guild to be on all the servers that have an interest. Once we<br/>
get the guild approved on one server, we will spread it to others. I know that<br/>
Bristlebane and Veeshan both have several people on them as well as others and<br/>
expect them to be set up pretty quickly once we get the official approval.<br/>
<br/>
However, we do need to get 10 people who can log in to the chat on Wednesday at<br/>
9:30 PM EDT. So, far Christina has said she can make it. So, we&#39;ve got 2. Just 8<br/>
more and maybe some more for good measure and we&#39;ll be able to create the guild.<br/>

&gt; Hello.<br/>
&gt; I am a 27 yr old GWM. I live in South Carolina. I have a lev 24 DEF Necro,<br/>
&gt; Named Wampir Keogh, and a lev 7 BAR Sham Named Windom. Both are on the<br/>
&gt; Bristlebane server. I like the idea of starting a GLBT guild but what would<br/>
&gt; be wrong with starting the guild on any server that wants it. Sure the new<br/>
&gt; Race War server would be a great place to start, but why not have a branch<br/>
&gt; chapters in all of the others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Iv already seen plenty of people say they have Bristlebane char to be able to<br/>
&gt; start one. Just my 2cp<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any way If you fell like it look me up online or you can email me<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:wampir@...">wampir@...</a>.<br/>

&gt; Thanks<br/>
&gt; Jamie<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S. I get alot of junk email if you want me to read yours put my name in the<br/>
&gt; subject wampir. Elce I may miss it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
