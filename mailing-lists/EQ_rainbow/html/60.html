<div id="ygrps-yiv-207432597">Hello all !<br/>
<br/>
Well , it&#39;s been some time since I said something so here I go : <br/>
<br/>
First off , I agree with all the previous messages and want to give Lora<br/>
and everyone else a warm welcome =)<br/>
Well , I have a level 31 cross-dressing Erudite Paladin (Yes , they do<br/>
exist , LOL) on the Tarew Marr server but I am more than willing to<br/>
sacrifice some or most of his playing time for the GLBT guild . I think it<br/>
should be a lot of fun !!! In any case , for those who doesn&#39;t know yet :<br/>
I&#39;m a 20 year old (since July 10th Wohooo !!) GWM living in NYC - but I&#39;m<br/>
from Germany originally =P <br/>
Anyways , be safe all and count me in on the GLBT guild !<br/>
<br/>
