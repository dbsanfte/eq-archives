Subject: [EQ_rainbow] Using roger wilco with EQ<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   Yeah, the question came up how to get on it. If you don&#39;t have it, <br/>
&gt; this is a freeware program that downloads in about 2 minutes, sets up <br/>
&gt; in about 5, & then takes a varying amount of time to adjust &  tweak <br/>
&gt; to get your sound card to work with it & transmission to go well. It <br/>
&gt; allows you to hear & transmit voice messages while running another <br/>
&gt; program, including EQ -- basically a voice chat room. Once you have <br/>
&gt; it all set up, you just open it before you go into EQ. You&#39;ll want to <br/>
&gt; click &#39;join&#39;, & then you want to join this channel: 216.37.33.36. <br/>
&gt; After you&#39;ve done that, you just leave roger open & go into EQ like <br/>
&gt; normal. We&#39;ve had a few of us going on it for a week or 2 now.<br/>
