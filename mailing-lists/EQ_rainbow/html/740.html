&gt; Hi and nice to meet you all!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have just today subscribed to &quot;EQ_Rainbow&quot; on the recomendation <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; a friend Lora whos been with the list for about a year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Having recently left Luclin server where me and Lora met each other <br/>
&gt; we have started new characters on Terris-Thule. Now we have both <br/>
&gt; played EQ for a long while and have had chars on various other <br/>
&gt; servers prior to Luclin.... yada yada, I&#39;m babbling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyhow, we have only just started fresh on Terris and Lora <br/>
mentioned <br/>
&gt; that there are people currently moving to Rodcet Nife starting <br/>
again <br/>
&gt; also. This has me curious and we are considering it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Basically I just wanted the name of the guild there and a contact I <br/>
&gt; could get in touch with to have a chat with about it all. I&#39;d <br/>
&gt; appreciate someone to show us around so to speak.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can be reached on swin@s... if anyone feels the urge <br/>
&gt; to send me some details. =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance<br/>
&gt; Hugs and kisses<br/>
&gt; Swin<br/>

&gt; &gt; Not sure if it was mentioned on EQ_Rainbow, but last night we had <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; big<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mystic Alliance guild event on Rodcet Nife. It was called <br/>
MegaPlat <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; consisted of a lottery (the grand prize was 665 plat) and raffles <br/>
&gt; of various<br/>
&gt; &gt; items (armor, jewelry, weapons, etc.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We had around 20 guild members on at the same time and that set a <br/>
&gt; record for<br/>
&gt; &gt; us, I believe. A lot of people have been moving over to the <br/>
Rodcet <br/>
&gt; server<br/>
&gt; &gt; and this event was a great way for them to get some nice <br/>
equipment.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Joe and Rob did a great job of coordinating and running the <br/>
event. <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
&gt; &gt; guys.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If anyone else wants to create characters on Rodcet, we invite <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; to come<br/>
&gt; &gt; join us. We&#39;ll be happy to help you out as you start new <br/>
&gt; characters. We&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; quickly making Rodcet the San Francisco of Norrath and you are <br/>
&gt; welcome to<br/>
&gt; &gt; join the fun.<br/>
