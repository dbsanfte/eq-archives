<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276610630">Well.. it&#39;s December 6th and the list has been pretty<br/>
quiet.  =)  Here&#39;s what&#39;s up with me...<br/>
<br/>
I sold my account (Gaelad on Xegony) since I didn&#39;t<br/>
think I was going to be able to play after my hand<br/>
surgery (and after losing interest in the game), but<br/>
my hand is better so I am starting over.  I was just<br/>
curious of what servers had the most of &quot;us&quot; that gets<br/>
this list--and is there anyone on Xegony??   =)  <br/>
