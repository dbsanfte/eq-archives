<br/>
In case any of you missed it, my character is Sirenia on the Rathe server and I am a gay male in RL. Anyway, I think the guild would be a great idea. It seems like we have a few people on the Rodcet Nife server, but many of us are spread all over different servers.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we should consider David&#39;s idea of setting up this &quot;GLBT&quot; guild on the new roleplaying server, Brell Serilis. We could all start from scratch and learn about each other in a group of the same level. Sirenia is a Level 24 High Elven Cleric, but I would be willing to give it all up to start again with all of you if you are interested. Then I am certain we would have enough members to form a guild there. What does everyone think of this?<br/>

    In RL my name is David. On EQ I am on the Veeshan server and mostly play a<br/>
    lvl 12 Cleric named Layf. Also occasionally play a lvl 6 Paladin name<br/>
    Rhoki, and have started a High Elf magician named Eloy. I am also thinking<br/>
    about creating a wood elf (because I think those guys are just sooo cute.<br/>
    :)<br/>
    <br/>
    My Cleric and Paladin are human and hang out around the Freeport area. I<br/>
    would like to start a GLBT guild on Veeshan if I can get enough people.<br/>
    <br/>
    I am interested in hearing from any GLBT people on Veeshan so send me a<br/>
    message or give me tell.<br/>
    <br/>

    Also, is anyone on the list going to create characters on the new role<br/>
    playing server that just came online last night?<br/>
    <br/>
