The guild is pretty active as far as geouping goes on Rodcet Nife, there<br/>
is me (fentus, Pien), my boyfriend (Genesius, Bolas), Taren (Tuttun),<br/>
Cabalah, Gwyyn, Damar, Aliuden, Zahira, Lysaies (Kyron, Solinar).  Most of<br/>
us play at night, whikle some play during the day, and some play all the<br/>
fucking time! :)  Also, My boyfriend and I have created new chatcters so<br/>
we are still low level with them, and there are others that are low level<br/>
(Zahira, Lysaies).  The rest of us are in our late teens early 20&#39;s.  I<br/>
know you had made a charcters with us before on Rodcet, and I hope you<br/>
continue to play with us, we would LOVE to ahve you.<br/>
<br/>
As far as events are concerend, we ahve helped two members so far with<br/>
quests and would like to do more, I tried to get a sunday questing thing<br/>
going but it hasnt caught on yet, and I&#39;ve also tried to get a lotto event<br/>
going but not much intereste there either.  But we do group together all<br/>
the time (abnd give eahc other things (thanks to Genesius and Taren for<br/>
donations toward my Staff of the Observer fund)).  I hope tyo see you on<br/>
Rodcet!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Well.. it&#39;s December 6th and the list has been pretty<br/>
&gt; quiet.  =)  Here&#39;s what&#39;s up with me...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I sold my account (Gaelad on Xegony) since I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think I was going to be able to play after my hand<br/>
&gt; surgery (and after losing interest in the game), but<br/>
&gt; my hand is better so I am starting over.  I was just<br/>
&gt; curious of what servers had the most of &quot;us&quot; that gets<br/>
&gt; this list--and is there anyone on Xegony??   =)  <br/>
