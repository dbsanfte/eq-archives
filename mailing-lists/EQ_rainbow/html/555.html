<div id="ygrps-yiv-999302411">Seems like most people play on Rodcet Nife or Brell Serilis. But the best<br/>
thing to do is find out what time(s) people play (and of course what time<br/>
zone) and team up with someone whose schedule will fairly closely match<br/>
yours. When I was actively playing, I found that only a few of use played at<br/>
the same times.<br/>
<br/>
If you decide to start a character on Brell, or if you want my account, let<br/>
me know. I will be canceling my account soon and I want to give my stuff to<br/>
a guild member, or if anyone wants a level 21 gnomish necro, I&#39;ll be glad to<br/>
let someone have my account.<br/>
<br/>
Also, still looking for someone to take over as guild leader on Brell. I<br/>
have someone who is willing to become the overall owner of the guild and am<br/>
going to find out how to transfer it to him, but still need the leader on<br/>
Brell.<br/>

&gt; Well.. it&#39;s December 6th and the list has been pretty<br/>
&gt; quiet.  =)  Here&#39;s what&#39;s up with me...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I sold my account (Gaelad on Xegony) since I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think I was going to be able to play after my hand<br/>
&gt; surgery (and after losing interest in the game), but<br/>
&gt; my hand is better so I am starting over.  I was just<br/>
&gt; curious of what servers had the most of &quot;us&quot; that gets<br/>
&gt; this list--and is there anyone on Xegony??   =)<br/>
