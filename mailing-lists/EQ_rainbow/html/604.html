<div id="ygrps-yiv-187187379">BTW this is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Amrosse@...">Amrosse@...</a> I had to sign up for the hotmail account a bit ago because this e-mail went berzerk on me hehe. Anyway I mostly play my High Elf Cleric now. But I also have a Wood Elf Warrior, but warriors get boring once you get to a certain point, nothing to work toward if ya know what I mean. And my partner play a High Elf cleric but his computer is broken for the time being &lt;sniffle&gt;. I would love to have you come over to Ralos server. Oh and Ive been playing since the release hehe.<br/>
