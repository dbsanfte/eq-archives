Subject: [EQ_rainbow] Fun on Rodcet Nife<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Not sure if it was mentioned on EQ_Rainbow, but last night we had a big<br/>
&gt; Mystic Alliance guild event on Rodcet Nife. It was called MegaPlat and<br/>
&gt; consisted of a lottery (the grand prize was 665 plat) and raffles of<br/>
various<br/>
&gt; items (armor, jewelry, weapons, etc.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We had around 20 guild members on at the same time and that set a record<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; us, I believe. A lot of people have been moving over to the Rodcet server<br/>
&gt; and this event was a great way for them to get some nice equipment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Joe and Rob did a great job of coordinating and running the event. Thanks<br/>
&gt; guys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If anyone else wants to create characters on Rodcet, we invite you to come<br/>
&gt; join us. We&#39;ll be happy to help you out as you start new characters. We&#39;re<br/>
&gt; quickly making Rodcet the San Francisco of Norrath and you are welcome to<br/>
&gt; join the fun.<br/>
