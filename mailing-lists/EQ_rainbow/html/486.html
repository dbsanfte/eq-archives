&gt; As of last night, the acting guild leader on Rodcet Nife is:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Character:<br/>
&gt; Genesius<br/>
&gt; Lvl 17 Wood Elf Ranger<br/>
&gt; Rodcet Nife<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please contact him to get yourself &#39;guilded&#39; on that server.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Rob, can I add this to our website? Let me know. Thanks)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As we get other servers set up, I will let everyone know. Thanks to all who<br/>
&gt; have helped and thanks for your patience.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am still awaiting word from the GM on E&#39;ci as to whether she has been able<br/>
&gt; to get the &#39;hijacked&#39; version of our guild deleted.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As we get guilds set up and people made into guild leaders and officers, I<br/>
&gt; think it would be a good idea if every guild leader kept a list of all<br/>
&gt; members and their contact information (i.e. email address). I dont&#39; want to<br/>
&gt; turn this into a record keeping nightmare, but I think that we at least<br/>
&gt; should have this much information on file. Does this sound reasonable to<br/>
&gt; everyone?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hugs,<br/>
