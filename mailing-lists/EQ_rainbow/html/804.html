<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520042085">Right now, I write lots of news blurbs.  I&#39;ll be writing articles for the<br/>
Station Break, which is a section on The Station sony page.  I&#39;ll also be<br/>
working on a nifty role-playing section coming probably this week to<br/>
everquest.com.  I&#39;m editing stuff for that currently.  Basically I write<br/>
whatever they need written.  I&#39;m maneuvering my way toward writing more<br/>
fiction there.  So any of those short little blurbs you seen on<br/>
everquest.com, verant.com, etc may have been written by me =)  If they ever<br/>
get the Station Break figured out (like, what they want to put there and<br/>
what audience they&#39;re shooting for, etc), you&#39;ll see my stuff there too, and<br/>
likely with a pic of me to go with it (bleh!).<br/>
