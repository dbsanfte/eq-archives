<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079179942">Hello again!         December 8th<br/>
<br/>
Good news for me!  The person that was going to buy my<br/>
account backed out so I can keep my old account on<br/>
xegony ..<br/>
<br/>
If anyone on this list is on xegony and wants to<br/>
group, my characters are:<br/>
Gaelad 50 DE enchanter<br/>
Cenen 27 human necro<br/>
Leafe 18 WE druid<br/>
Gooeypoo 1 Ogre shaman :)<br/>
<br/>
of course that means I can also pick back up on rodcet<br/>
with my character there :)<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Well.. it&#39;s December 6th and the list has been<br/>
&gt; pretty<br/>
&gt; quiet.  =)  Here&#39;s what&#39;s up with me...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I sold my account (Gaelad on Xegony) since I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think I was going to be able to play after my hand<br/>
&gt; surgery (and after losing interest in the game), but<br/>
&gt; my hand is better so I am starting over.  I was just<br/>
&gt; curious of what servers had the most of &quot;us&quot; that<br/>
&gt; gets<br/>
&gt; this list--and is there anyone on Xegony??   =)  <br/>
