<div id="ygrps-yiv-971129725">Gang,<br/>
Today - I had a run in with one of the GMs.  You&#39;re not going to believe this,<br/>
but it&#39;s shades of Ultima Online all over again.<br/>
<br/>
We all know that character names are restricted by bounds of good<br/>
taste/decency/keeping with the spirit of the game.  So you can imagine I was a<br/>
little surprised when a characer named &quot;Cokaine&quot; shows up.  Not only that, he&#39;s<br/>
using /ooc to carry on private conversations all over the place on Brell.<br/>
<br/>
I /tell him to please use a channel for side chatter.  I won&#39;t repeate the<br/>
response I got.  I warn him to cool it, or I /petition.  Use your imagination on<br/>
the response I got - and it was to store my goodies in a locked box either!<br/>
<br/>
I give up and /petition.  This guy was really all over the place.  A few minutes<br/>
later, a GM pops up and tells me to not make false complaints!  I let him have<br/>
both barrels, and hard.  A minute later he comes back and tells me that in fact,<br/>
Cokaine is also known as Vampyre aka Jason White.  He&#39;s a GM!<br/>
<br/>
I asked why he could get away this conduct.  The GM says &quot;he&#39;s had a bad day -<br/>
his wife died yesterday&quot;.  C&#39;mon - do I have &quot;Hello I&#39;m a stupid 14 year old&quot;<br/>
written on my forehead?<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I&#39;ve sent a formal complaint in.  I&#39;d suggest that if you get<br/>
someone who&#39;s just a bit too obnoxious, don&#39;t be suprised if it&#39;s a GM.</div>
