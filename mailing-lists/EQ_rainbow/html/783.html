<div id="ygrps-yiv-58519060"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;VERY cute, if you like &#39;em tall & Texan!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, several of my email lists suddenly grew talkative today, so I am <br/>
little confused about all the emails I have this evening.  Who else here <br/>
is Texan?  (raised in west texas, myself, in the midland area, but i <br/>
spent about 8 years in austin recently too)<br/>
<br/>
Also, Nameless Love is very near to creation on The Nameless server.  We <br/>
have 9 of our necessary 10 people located.  Anyone else interested in <br/>
helping us start the new guild?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the current temporary (still-in-development) site:<br/>

<br/>
Drop me an email if you&#39;d like to help us out.  I intend to get the <br/>
guild registered before the end of the month.  :)  We could sure use an <br/>
extra one or two people to join too, though, in case we have problems <br/>
arranging a time that all of us can be online.</div>
