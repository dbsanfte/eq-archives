<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; A Credit Card Nightmare<br/>
&gt; --------------------<br/>
&gt; In March 1992 a man living in Newton near Boston,<br/>
&gt; Massachusetts received a bill for his as yet unused credit<br/>
&gt; card stating that he owed $0.00. He ignored it and threw it<br/>
&gt; away.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In April he received another and threw that one away too. The<br/>
&gt; following month the credit card company sent him a very nasty<br/>
&gt; note stating they were going to cancel his card if he didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; send them $0.00.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He called them, talked to them, they said it was a computer<br/>
&gt; error and told him they&#39;d take care of it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The following month he decided that it was about time that he<br/>
&gt; tried out the troublesome credit card figuring that if there<br/>
&gt; were purchases on his account it would put an end to his<br/>
&gt; ridiculous predicament.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, in the first store that he produced his credit card<br/>
&gt; in payment for his purchases he found that his card had been<br/>
&gt; cancelled.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He called the credit card company who apologized for the<br/>
&gt; computer error once again and said that they would take care<br/>
&gt; of it. The next day he got a bill for $0.00 stating that<br/>
&gt; payment was now overdue.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Assuming that having spoken to the credit card company only<br/>
&gt; the previous day the latest bill was yet another mistake he<br/>
&gt; ignored it, trusting that the company would be as good as<br/>
&gt; their word and sort the problem out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The next month he got a bill for $0.00 stating that he had 10<br/>
&gt; days to pay his account or the company would have to take<br/>
&gt; steps to recover the debt.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finally giving in he thought he would play the company at<br/>
&gt; their own game and mailed them a check for $0.00. The computer<br/>
&gt; duly processed his account and returned a statement to the<br/>
&gt; effect that he now owed the credit card company nothing at<br/>
&gt; all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A week later, the man&#39;s bank called him asking him what he was<br/>
&gt; doing writing a check for $0.00. After a lengthy explanation<br/>
&gt; the bank replied that the $0.00 check had caused their check<br/>
&gt; processing software to fail.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The bank could not now process ANY checks from ANY of their<br/>
&gt; customers that day because the check for $0.00 was causing the<br/>
&gt; computer to crash.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The following month the man received a letter from the credit<br/>
&gt; card company claiming that his check had bounced and that he<br/>
&gt; now owed them $0.00 and unless he sent a check they would be<br/>
&gt; taking steps to recover the debt.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The man, who had been considering buying his wife a computer<br/>
&gt; for her birthday, bought her a typewriter instead.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; ======================================================<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Quick Wit:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Deep within a forest a little turtle began to climb a tree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After hours of effort he reached the top, jumped into the air<br/>
&gt; waving his front legs and crashed to the ground. After<br/>
&gt; recovering, he slowly climbed the tree again, jumped, and fell<br/>
&gt; to the ground.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The turtle tried again and again while a couple of birds<br/>
&gt; sitting on a branch watched his sad efforts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finally, the female bird turned to her mate.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Dear,&quot; she chirped, &quot;I think it&#39;s time to tell him he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; adopted.&quot;<br/>
