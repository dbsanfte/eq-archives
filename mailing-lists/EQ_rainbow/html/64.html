<b>Subject:</b> Re: Getting a GUILD up and going... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-419975240">I too agree with Sandy. We need unification!<br/>
<br/>
I am on Veeshan as 12th lvl Cleric, Layf (get bind in 2 more levels! Woohoo!)<br/>
<br/>
I know Beth is also on Veeshan. Wasn&#39;t there a same sex wedding on Veeshan? I<br/>
know there was on some server. I would want to continue to play on Veeshan some<br/>
of the time but could play half time on another server for the sake of the<br/>
guild. I have too many friends on Veeshan to give it up entirely though.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the way to address this is also to find ways to contact other GLBT<br/>
people. We know there have to be plenty of queer and queer friendly (hello<br/>
Lora) people on all the servers to form guilds on all. How can we contact them?<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking of ways. I know some gay mags like the Advocate have a cyber<br/>
section. I could send them a press release. Also, other mags too, like XY. But<br/>
I don&#39;t think I just want to go in game and start /shouting &#39;hey anybody want<br/>
to join a queer guild?&#39; across all the zones.<br/>
<br/>
This brings up another issue. What to name it. Some people are trying to make a<br/>
guild on the soon to be up race war server and call it the &quot;Rainbow Warriors&quot;.<br/>
Personally, while I&#39;m totally out in RL (anyone see my letter in the Advocate<br/>
with Xena on the cover?) I&#39;m not wanting to be so bold in EQ which seems to be<br/>
populated with many sexually insecure teenage boys who would be all too happy<br/>
to start abusing us. I&#39;d like the guild to be very subtle. So a name like &quot;The<br/>
Stone Wall&quot; or &quot;Mattachine Society&quot; or something else that would require a good<br/>
knowledge of gay history to understand would be better, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I will be making a web page for GLBT EQ players. I will be posting the<br/>
info about my characters on it and will let you all know when I get it up. Then<br/>
if you like, you will be able to send me info about your characters to be put<br/>
on the page too.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
David<br/>

&gt; I think getting a GUILD started is a GREAT idea...however...some of us are<br/>
&gt; on different servers. We need unification..yes..I looked that word up just<br/>
&gt; for this occasion! Lets start by saying what server we are all currently<br/>
&gt; on, which character we play the MOST and go from there. The ONLY problem I<br/>
&gt; see is that we may have to play our favorite character half time while we<br/>
&gt; play our &#39;GUILD&#39; character the other half. SHAME we cant transfer<br/>
&gt; characters from server to server..sigh. Give me some feedbaack FOLKS! HUGS!<br/>
