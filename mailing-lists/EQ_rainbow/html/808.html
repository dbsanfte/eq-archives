<div id="ygrps-yiv-289924657">Hiyas, Eric! Yup, Mystic Alliance on Rodcet Nife is<br/>
gay/gay-friendly (hehe, our last 3 new members have all been straight <br/>
-- what&#39;s up with that? :) ). If you &/or hubbie want to start new <br/>
chars there to join, you can just give a tell to my main, Snapdragyn <br/>
(or Gaistyd, Darkwylf, Divaboi, or Duvine -- I THINK that&#39;s all of my <br/>
current alts, hehe). Snap is an officer, so he can run around & do<br/>
the invite thing -- as of this morning, he was camped in FP, with <br/>
plans to head toward HH this afternoon. We have a few people with <br/>
mains on other servers who run alts on RN, including a rl friend who <br/>
has a 51 bard on RZ (eek!). So, come on over & join the fun.<br/>
<br/>
Todd, a.k.a. Snapdragyn et. al.<br/>

&gt; Hi all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A friend was creating a new eq list (there&#39;s only about 480 at the <br/>
&gt; moment, heh) today and while I was scanning through them I found <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My first thought was, &quot;Joy! Rapture!&quot; and I quickly subbed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A little bit about myself:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m 26?  Argh, where&#39;s my ginkobiloba? My birthday is later this <br/>
&gt; month, so I&#39;ll let you know definitely as soon as my grandmother <br/>
&gt; calls.  Although I&#39;m sure it&#39;s getting hard to find those little <br/>
&gt; teddy-bear cards with the wheels with the ages written on them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I live in Atlanta with Ye Olde Hubby.  I am a technician for <br/>
&gt; Healtheon/WebMD and I get to talk to dental receptionists all day. <br/>
(I <br/>
&gt; can sense your jealousy).  It&#39;s not a bad gig - I&#39;ve even installed <br/>
&gt; EQ here but our network is a joke, so..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Both my hubby Chillos (it&#39;s a family name of Greek origin or so we <br/>
&gt; believe) and I play on The Rathe server.  I have a 28th lvl<br/>
half-elf <br/>
&gt; Ranger and a 16th lvl Dark Elf necromancer.  We both belong to a <br/>
&gt; guild of really good people (well, mostly good) that a friend (who <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; gay as well) introduced us to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve played EQ since Phase IV beta, been a guide for about 4 months <br/>
&gt; on Veeshan (aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!) and have successfully <br/>
&gt; recovered from burn-out (which is why my ranger is only 28).  Other <br/>
&gt; games I have played include Meridian59 (server 107) for three years <br/>
&gt; (off-and-on) and Ultima Online, although hubby has a LOT more <br/>
&gt; experiences in UO than I do.. I mostly just ran (if you could call <br/>
&gt; running with that lag running) from everyone, believing they were <br/>
all <br/>
&gt; PKers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ummm.. what else?  Should you want to know more about us, surf on <br/>
&gt; over to our website at:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://people.atl.mediaone.net/chillicub/">http://people.atl.mediaone.net/chillicub/</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, and it&#39;s safe to surf while you&#39;re at work.. (nudge nudge, wink <br/>
&gt; wink)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve read the past 20 posts or so.. am I correct in piecing<br/>
together <br/>
&gt; that there is a gay guild on Rodcet-Nife?  and or Nameless?  As<br/>
much <br/>
&gt; as I dearly love our guild on Rathe I would really love to join a <br/>
gay <br/>
&gt; guild.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Guess that&#39;s about it (aren&#39;t you glad?)-<br/>
&gt; Eric<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, for anyone who&#39;s interested, the guild we belong to (I&#39;m outing <br/>
&gt; myself here) is Silver Blade ... my characters are Zacharus <br/>
&gt; Anam&#39;Matghamuin and Lucentio Duarte (mostly Lucentio)... Chillos is <br/>
&gt; Beja or Chillos (mostly Beja) </span></blockquote></div>
