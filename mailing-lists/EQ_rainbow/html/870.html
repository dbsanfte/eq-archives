<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828412184"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Yes I believe Rodcet is the largest collection of players<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m curious what a &quot;large collection&quot; means in &quot;gay EQ&quot; terms.  I keep trying <br/>
to compare our new guild with the uber-guilds on The Nameless server and of <br/>
course we come up short.  But we usually have around 4 people online, with as <br/>
many as 10.  Last weekend, I think, we grouped with our guildfriends (The <br/>
Nameless of Mercy) at SolA and we had enough people to completely fill 2 <br/>
party groups.  I think that&#39;s an exceptional headcount for a guild that&#39;s <br/>
still less than half a year old.<br/>
<br/>
Cure my feelings of inadequacy as guildleader.  Tell me we&#39;re doing well on <br/>
the &quot;headcount&quot; test.  Heh.<br/>
