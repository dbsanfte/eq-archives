<br/>
Try creating a new character. Don&#39;t give up on your old one, but tryign a<br/>
new character can give you a fresh perspective on the game.  It provides<br/>
you with an alternative when you feel bored with your wizard.  If you&#39;re<br/>
sick of medding try a rogue or warrior or monk.  Bards can cast spells,<br/>
and don&#39;t need to med.  Paladins and rangers and SKs don&#39;t need to med<br/>
much.<br/>
<br/>
Items in Everquest are highly overrated, in particular for mages.  They<br/>
are mostly there for status.  EQs social hierarchy is based on levels,<br/>
plat, and items.  In terms of your effectiveness as a wizard, items<br/>
matter, but not that much!<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I really like about Brell right now is that everyone is<br/>
low level.  It&#39;s so crazy compared to Mithanial Marr where there are many<br/>
50th level characters.  I&#39;m a 21st level enchanter, and I am the highest<br/>
level enchanter on the server (as far as I know).  Most people are under<br/>
20th level.  Of the over 20th level people, most are soloing<br/>
druids/necros/wizards.  Cazic Thule only had 5 people in it when I stopped<br/>
by the other day.  It&#39;s a very fresh environment.  No one has any gold or<br/>
platnum jewlery.  Newer servers can offer a great environment to play your<br/>
character where life does not revolve around rare expensive items.<br/>
