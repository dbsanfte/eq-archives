<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789290382">My times relative to East Coast (USA), <br/>
<br/>
Mornings doable but sleeepy (not a morning person, though life seems to<br/>
insist I have to be awake then).<br/>
Early-mid afternoon not good (its our usual run errands/get food for the<br/>
week time)<br/>
Late afternoon and later all good.<br/>
<br/>

General Brell Notes:<br/>
BTW David,  I noticed your hunting in LavaStorm now ...  :)  Let me know if<br/>
you ever want a tank, wiz or an enchanter for companay, I have one of each<br/>
at just under your level in FP or Neriak. (Taizu/Shiri/Deceit).  Shiri<br/>
(Wiz) is tagged in Mystical Alliance as well :)  And if you want to try and<br/>
see if my 8th DE Necro Shade (too low to hunt with you) can mule gossimer<br/>
robe/armor for you let me know.  She has the proper faction to get them :).<br/>
<br/>
Poem to follow ..<br/>
