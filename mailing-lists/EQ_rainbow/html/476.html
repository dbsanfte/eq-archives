<b>Subject:</b> We Want You on Brell Serilis (special offer) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-981245353">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Last night, we had 5 Mystical Alliance people on Brell at the same time and while<br/>
we didn&#39;t group together, or even see each other, it still made things a lot more<br/>
fun because of the conversations we could have while we were healing and med&#39;ing.<br/>
<br/>
I just want to encourage more of you to move over to Brell. I know a lot of you<br/>
have high level characters on your current servers and I can understand your not<br/>
wanting to leave. But many of you have lower level characters and you are the ones<br/>
I want to invite over to Brell.<br/>
<br/>
I gave up my level 13 cleric to make the move and I know what it is like to start<br/>
over, so I have a special offer. If you want to make the move, let me know and I<br/>
will do the following:<br/>
<br/>
o I will help equip your character. Once you figure out a class and race, I will<br/>
work to get you some equipment that would be suitable for a character below level<br/>
10. I will help get cloth for casters, and rawhide and patchwork for melee types<br/>
and weapons too.<br/>
<br/>
o I will help you power level. My lvl 17 necro has a healing spell that takes HP<br/>
away from me and gives them to you. I can keep you healed up. Also, once you kill<br/>
a creature down below half, I will help you finish it off. You will get the XP and<br/>
loot. This should really keep your downtime to a minimum.<br/>
<br/>
In just a few hours, we can have you up to level 5 or more. While I can&#39;t speak<br/>
for other guild members on Brell, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of them might be<br/>
able to help you level and give you some &#39;hand me down&#39; equipment as well. And<br/>
depending on your level, you might also be able to group with various of our<br/>
members as we have characters in many different levels.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you are lonely on your existing server and don&#39;t have too high a character,<br/>
please come on over to Brell and at least give it a try.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
David</div>
