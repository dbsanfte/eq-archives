<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862636750">Hello. <br/>
I am a 27 yr old GWM. I live in South Carolina. I have a lev 24 DEF Necro, <br/>
Named Wampir Keogh, and a lev 7 BAR Sham Named Windom. Both are on the <br/>
Bristlebane server. I like the idea of starting a GLBT guild but what would <br/>
be wrong with starting the guild on any server that wants it. Sure the new <br/>
Race War server would be a great place to start, but why not have a branch <br/>
chapters in all of the others. <br/>
<br/>
Iv already seen plenty of people say they have Bristlebane char to be able to <br/>
start one. Just my 2cp<br/>
<br/>
Any way If you fell like it look me up online or you can email me <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:wampir@...">wampir@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Jamie<br/>
<br/>

subject wampir. Elce I may miss it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Jamie</div>
