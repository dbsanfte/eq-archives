<b>Subject:</b> new guild this saturday <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962032781">Short notice, but if anyone would like to join in helping a new guild, Nameless <br/>
Love, get authorized on The Nameless server...  we&#39;ll be meeting at noon <br/>
central time on Saturday the 4th.  We have more than the necessary 10 people, <br/>
but every extra person helps in case something comes up at the last minute for <br/>
someone else.<br/>
<br/>
My name there is SoulDreamer.  We have a small website set up at http://<br/>
www.sweetvision.com/~namelesslove .<br/>
<br/>
We tried this effort 2 months ago (before the EQ guild freeze) but we couldn&#39;t <br/>
rally 10 people online at once.  I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll make it this time, but an extra <br/>
hand is always welcome.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to be &quot;physically&quot; with the rest of us, we&#39;re be at the Isle of <br/>
Lesbos.  (When none but a few of us guild members were on the island between <br/>
Qeynos and Erudin, we claimed it in the name of queerdom.)  We have high level <br/>
characters there who can teleport you there if you show up well before noon.  <br/>
Just message SoulDreamer for help.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, hope to see you there.  Meet us at Lesbos, or just give me a /tell :)</div>
