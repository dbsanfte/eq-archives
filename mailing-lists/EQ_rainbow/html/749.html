<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472498973">Hi EQ_rainbow,<br/>
<br/>
I have been playing EQ for over a year. Started out on Fennin Ro<br/>
where <br/>
I have a lvl 37 Cleric, named Anoka.  Then some friends started <br/>
playing on The Nameless, where I&#39;ve been since this spring.  I have<br/>
38 <br/>
Druid there, named Anoka. <br/>
<br/>
Recently, a dear friend has decided he wants to start a gay guild on <br/>
The Nameless.  Since my 38 druid is already in a guild, and she&#39;s <br/>
female and I&#39;m male, I decided to start a new male druid for this <br/>
guild, named Gaydari.<br/>
<br/>
I love playing druids.  =&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are there any others here that play on The Nameless?  We need ten <br/>
people to start the guild.  My friend wants to call the guild<br/>
Nameless <br/>
Love, in honor of Oscar Wilde.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Joseph J Normandin of Mystic Alliance on Rodcet Nife, who <br/>
posted info about this egroup in the alt.games.everquest newsgroup.<br/>
