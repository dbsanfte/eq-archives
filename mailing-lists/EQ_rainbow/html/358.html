<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769321975">So, I have been in a semi-bored slump trying to Power level to get to 20 at<br/>
least by friday. Currently I am 18 and then some. Got a while to 18 so..<br/>
everything I can tonight, I will be gaming like crazy. Soloing in Unrest is<br/>
actually alot of fun.. there is never a dull moment for me. I can kill 3<br/>
Blues to me before I have to med. This also Includes the Death Beetles that<br/>
attack at the same time. So I am doing pretty good I think. Anyhow, Is there<br/>
any suggestions on Good Loot mobs in game at my level. My character is Mage,<br/>
so preferably a mage type item would be perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
