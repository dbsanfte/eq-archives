<div id="ygrps-yiv-674817414">Hello, everyone-<br/>
<br/>
My name is Christine and I&#39;ve been lurking on the list for about a week or so<br/>
now. Thought I&#39;d introduce myself and indicate my interest in the guild<br/>
formation happening this evening. I do plan on being in the chat room about<br/>
7:30 p.m. MDT (here in toasty Denver).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a lesbian (age 43) who has been playing EQ for about a month now. I have<br/>
two characters on Brell, one on Quellious and two on Erollisi Marr. They are<br/>
as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Brell Serillis Server:<br/>
<br/>
Ananda, gnome cleric of Brell, 5th level, beginning tailoring and smithing<br/>
skills (sharpen those rusty weapons!)<br/>
<br/>
Mirri, wood elf druid of Tunare, 4th level, beginning tailoring skills<br/>
<br/>
Quellious Server:<br/>
<br/>
Ariale, erudin wizard of Quellious, 5th level<br/>
<br/>
Erollisi Marr Server:<br/>
<br/>
Sharada, high-elf cleric of Tunare, 8th level<br/>
Minbari, high-elf enchanter, 6th level, beginning jewelry skills<br/>
<br/>
My partner, Danielle, will be playing EQ as soon as we get our DSL installed<br/>
and the new computers up (new vid cards, etc.), sometime in the next month. We<br/>
are both looking forward to making some new friends and adventuring to parts<br/>
unknown.<br/>
<br/>
See you in chat this evening.<br/>
<br/>
Christine<br/>
