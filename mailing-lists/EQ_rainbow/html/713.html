<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623730301">Well, EQ, like life, has its ups & downs. Today was a down for me. <br/>
First I died from a bug while swimming in RV -- couldn&#39;t move all of <br/>
a sudden, just sank to the bottom. Wasn&#39;t lag (I looked at the #&#39;s <br/>
1st thing) & I wasn&#39;t fatigued or anything. Oh well. Then I had to <br/>
run to work, but got off early & came back to look for a GM. Ha. <br/>
After spending 2 hours fishing I finally got a tell from an <br/>
apprentice, who just &#39;moved it up&#39; the list. At this point I figured <br/>
I could have already made back the level I lost (did I mention that? <br/>
the only reason I had bothered to petition in the 1st place). I did <br/>
finally hear from a GM later -- hadn&#39;t heard of the bug before, so <br/>
they just &#39;filed a report&#39;, i.e. did nothing for me except waste my <br/>
time. So, I ran to join up with some folks to hunt after giving up on <br/>
them when the 1st one just put it back on the list.<br/>
<br/>
  Well, the gods of Norrath weren&#39;t through with me yet. I tried to <br/>
run through the Gorge (aka Beholder) along the left wall, & got <br/>
charmed & then slaughtered by an eye. OK, run back from RV, loot <br/>
corpse which a guildmate (Cassious or Tiramisu, & apologies for <br/>
forgetting which) had kindly pulled to the zone, ready to hunt. Then <br/>
tried to go the right side -- OK, first I do not recommend trying to <br/>
run on walls while using Selo&#39;s. I did at least find out that a level <br/>
11 (now) bard CAN survive a fall from the highest point you can climb <br/>
to -- just. Of course, when you have stuff already agro&#39;d & waiting <br/>
at the bottom to kick your battered butt, this hardly matters.<br/>
<br/>
  So, second corpse run in 30 minutes, & quickly gaining on the level <br/>
10, which was so much more fun than 12 or 11 that I just have to go <br/>
back to it again, I guess. Only problem now is, I was so far into the <br/>
Gorge, & lost while running from agro&#39;d mobs, that no one can find my <br/>
corpse. We took a group of four (Cassious, Hamyrmint, me, & a non-<br/>
guild mage who kindly agreed to help) & were having a tough time <br/>
fighting our way up the gorge. Then I saw another eye coming. The <br/>
mage & another high-level wanted to take it, so Cass & I ran. Hamyr <br/>
bravely stayed to try to push on after the casters took the eye -- <br/>
but the eye took him. :(<br/>
<br/>
  OK, now there are 2 corpse out there. Cass was doing the sneaky <br/>
thief thing, & finally managed to find Hamyr&#39;s body, but no one could <br/>
find mine. Gaybriel even ran in a bit, but couldn&#39;t find it. A nice <br/>
caster type sitting nearby agreed to invis me, but it wore off before <br/>
I could get in far enough to find it & I had to run back. Finally, <br/>
disgusted with the whole thing, I went in alone & visible -- at this <br/>
point I hardly even cared if I died again. Well, by working back & <br/>
forth with the locate song (the twisty gorge made it of very limited <br/>
use), I finally found my corpse. Dragged it to a safe spot up the <br/>
cliff, & looted it. Then turned to leave -- & realized I was lost. <br/>
Another ten minutes of wandering, & I FINALLY made it out. Ran to RV <br/>
& camped, exhausted after 6 hours & 1/2 bub (& 1 level) lower than <br/>
when I started.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway, got caught up in the drama of it all writing this, & sure <br/>
we&#39;ve all had days like that (or worse), but the whole point of this <br/>
was to really thank the people who helped me. I can tell you, I was <br/>
incredibly frustrated (& thankful I wasn&#39;t on roger wilco -- hehe), & <br/>
can&#39;t imagine how much worse it all would have been if I&#39;d had to go <br/>
through it without the help or my guildmates, both those in the zone <br/>
& those who offered their suggestions. I even had to ask people to <br/>
STOP suggestions at one point because they were coming so fast! <br/>
That&#39;s really great, & I appreciate every bit of it. I know I was a <br/>
bit short at times because of the frustration I was feeling (sorry), <br/>
but I really did appreciate all of it -- just wanted to let eveyone <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
  Oh, yeah, and Var? Don&#39;t marry Kerid (sorry Kerid)! I can make you <br/>
much happier, & let you keep your freedom too (that goes for you, <br/>
too, Anthonie -- just because I think Var&#39;s a hottie doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m <br/>
casting you aside, sexy)! Why can&#39;t we all live like the bards -- <br/>
free to share with all? Hehe, just kidding -- maybe ;).</div>
