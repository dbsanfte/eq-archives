&gt;I think they&#39;re pretty cute too. And I already made my shaman. (and a necro<br/>
&gt;and a monk) The shaman without spells survived much much better killing the<br/>
&gt;same type of critter then the monk. The necro, well we won&#39;t talk about <br/>
&gt;that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Roumor I heard about the lizzy monk is that instead of dragon punch at 20<br/>
&gt;or 25 or whatever, they get tail sweep. ;-p I wanna see that!<br/>

&gt;Ok, this might just be a rant, but since it&#39;s non hostile I&#39;m going to post<br/>
&gt;it here =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;WOW Iksar are so cute. The first time I ever saw one I was like...oh my<br/>
&gt;gosh! It walks around and swings its little tail and talks and everything!<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s like the best pet!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And Kunark is very pretty. Lots of fun new zones, with cool looking<br/>
&gt;critters. It&#39;s pretty obvious to me you could hunt in Kunark and never<br/>
&gt;leave, and get all the way to 50. It seems a self sufficient continent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Kunark is dangerous though, I have talked to a lot of people who brought<br/>
&gt;their mains over and got stomped by something.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The solution to all this is...make an Iksar shaman! You get SOW at 9th<br/>
&gt;level and you can explore like crazy. Team up with a friend and make an<br/>
&gt;Iksar monk, and you have a great 2-person leveling/exploring team<br/>
&gt;especially for low levels. FYI Iksar have regeneration, and the highest wis<br/>
&gt;of the shaman races, making them the best shaman and monk races IMHO<br/>
&gt;(though they aren&#39;t as cute as Duna).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(Rumor: Iksar do not get the inherent haste that human monks get at level<br/>
&gt;20+)<br/>
