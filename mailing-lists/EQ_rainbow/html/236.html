<div id="ygrps-yiv-149473430">Ok here is my story<br/>
<br/>
Last night I saw a someone auction off a Staff of Withering. It is a staff <br/>
that I am very interested in. I offer the person 400pp and a Goss robe. He <br/>
aggread, but said I would have to go the keldean to get the staff from one of <br/>
his other char. I said fine for that staff I would do just about anything. So <br/>
here I go trecking from Permafrost all the way to Neriak. Die once from the <br/>
damn Highhold cht&#39;s. Well I get to the bank in Neriak. Pow I find out iv only <br/>
got 358pp in the bank. Sence I cant meet the whole 400pp I offer him a water <br/>
crystal staff on top of the 358pp and the goss robe. Water Crystal staff are <br/>
curently going tor 100pp. He ingornes me. Doent even reply. I say ok. and <br/>
offher a dragon dirk on top of all the rest. He says he is sorry but he has <br/>
been offered 500pp and going to take it. <br/>
<br/>
I go off. After all this time he has wated me trecking all the way accross <br/>
the content. He would be so fucking greedy. excuse my language. Granted I did <br/>
fall short 42pp of our deal. But I made up for it and then some, but no he <br/>
wanted to twink one of his friends withe a blackend iron bastard sword. <br/>
<br/>
