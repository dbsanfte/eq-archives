<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-110629161">It has been brought to my attention that the guild has been set up by someone on<br/>
the E&#39;ci server without my knowledge. Last night, I petitioned to ask 1) how could<br/>
that happen? and 2) to please delete and recreate the guild with me as the guild<br/>
master.<br/>
<br/>
After some further research by Sandy, he has found out that it is indeed a GLBT<br/>
guild.<br/>
<br/>
My problem is that the person who got this set up did not inform me or this list<br/>
and we don&#39;t know exactly who the guild master is. While I do not have designs on<br/>
being a powerful multi-server guild master, I feel that it is inappropriate to try<br/>
to get the guild set up without authorization. Especially when we had someone from<br/>
this list who volunteered to be the guild master. I also don&#39;t understand how<br/>
Verant did this either, but that is an issue I will take up with them.<br/>
<br/>
The upshot is, unless I hear from the guild master very soon, I am going to<br/>
proceed with having this guild deleted and recreated. The leadership will then be<br/>
transferred to the person who volunteered on this list (I have to check my notes<br/>
to see who it was).<br/>
<br/>
My feeling is the guild belongs to the people on this list and that this list<br/>
should be used to communicate general information about the guild. There is no<br/>
room for someone who &#39;hijacks&#39; the guild and doesn&#39;t share the information with<br/>
the people on this list.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that what I have said above is reasonable. If anyone feels that it is not,<br/>
please politely let me know.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, I roved around between about 7 different servers searching for<br/>
a GM to set up the guild and found none. I will continue this and let you know as<br/>
soon as the guild is set up on any of the other servers.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
David</div>
