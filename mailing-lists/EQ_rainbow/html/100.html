<div id="ygrps-yiv-77765626">Okay, I&#39;ll be the guild master.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t heard any negative comments about the name &#39;Unity&#39;, so I think that will<br/>
be the name unless someone else has something better. So, let&#39;s make plans for this<br/>
Wednesday to meet in chat.<br/>
<br/>
I will make the channel &#39;Unity&#39; and the password will be &#39;rainbow&#39; in all lower case<br/>
(and case does matter.) If you have any trouble getting into the chat room, just<br/>
contact me directly, my chat name is Lari.<br/>
<br/>
Now we need a time to get 10 people all together at once. I am in Eastern Daylight<br/>
Time. I can be on as early as 4:30pm EDT, and as late as 10:30pm EDT. If we shoot<br/>
for early in that window, we can get some of our European members on, but will miss<br/>
the US Pacific time people who may still be at work. Let&#39;s tentatively set it for<br/>
9:30pm EDT, this Wednesday. Please let me know if you will be able to attend the<br/>
chat at that time. If you cannot, then please tell me a time when you can, in case I<br/>
have to reschedule.<br/>
<br/>
We will work first to create the guild on Brell Serilis, and then spread it to other<br/>
servers fairly quickly.<br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest we need to describe the guild in OOC and IC terms. OOC it will<br/>
be a guild that is open to tolerant, fair-minded people who are GLBT or affirming.<br/>
But what do we want it to be &#39;in character&#39;. I&#39;d suggest that it certainly not<br/>
discriminate at all based on race or class. Also, do we want to promote RPing, or<br/>
just encourage it, or not bother with it? Or do we just want a guild to provide help<br/>
and friendship to our sister and brother guild mates (such as selling banded armor<br/>
at a steep discount and things like that?)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any better ideas or plans, please share them.<br/>
