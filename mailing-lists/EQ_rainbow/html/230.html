<div id="ygrps-yiv-447349148">Hi everyone:) Well I&#39;m probably going to go back to playing my <br/>
Rogue, Garret. I&#39;ve enjoyed the Enchanter but (class imbalance <br/>
aside) I just love the Rogue more. And fun is the most important <br/>
part...Anyway the two chars I have on Brell are:<br/>
<br/>
Garret, 7th Wood Elf Rogue<br/>
Timarius, 5th High Elf Enchanter<br/>
<br/>
I also have several other characters other places but those are the <br/>
ones I am focusing for sake of interest in the Guild. Look me up <br/>
sometime:)<br/>
<br/>
*hugs*<br/>
