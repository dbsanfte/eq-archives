<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843381302">The other idea for a name I thought might work was &quot;The Unification&quot;. The<br/>
knock against &quot;Unity&quot; was that is was too short. And our temporary name &quot;The<br/>
Unity&quot; will be confused with the other guild called &quot;Unity&quot;, so &quot;The<br/>
Unification&quot; might work. It is not implying very much and therefore would work<br/>
for anything from DEF NEC&#39;s to goody-goody clerics.</div>
