&gt; I haven&#39;t played a druid recently, but I don&#39;t think that the loss of<br/>
&gt; kiting has seriously underpowered the class.  Kiting simply allowed druids<br/>
&gt; to level extremely quickly, and kill very powerful creatures.  However, in<br/>
&gt; the post kiting patch fix, druids are still a great class they just don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have this advantage over other classes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Druids are still a great, versatile, class.  They can tank pretty good up<br/>
&gt; to level 20, backing up their tanking with bolts, heals, and damage<br/>
&gt; shields.  They are also excellent healers in any party up to level 40 or<br/>
&gt; so.  Their evac ability means they&#39;re still usually welcome in really high<br/>
&gt; level parties.  Their bolts are weaker than that of pure casters, but they<br/>
&gt; are still pretty good.  Their teleports and SOWs are very useful, great<br/>
&gt; for exploring, and very useful to friends.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So my overall conclusion is that druids are still one of the most fun, and<br/>
&gt; useful, classes in the game.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Okay question: I am going to start a new character being that mine is<br/>
&gt; &gt; becoming kinda blah.. I still am going to play him regularly.. but I want to<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a side character to play when my main character gets bored.. I also<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to twink the hell outa my newbie.. so.. I am looking for suggestions..<br/>
&gt; &gt; at this point, I am playing a Mage .. and am looking to the ways of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Paladin, Druid or Ranger or cleric. I am gearing towards the Druid, because<br/>
&gt; &gt; the cool ability to Teleport around later... Has anyone played a druid<br/>
&gt; &gt; successfully even after the apparent nerfing of  their Kiting ability ?<br/>
