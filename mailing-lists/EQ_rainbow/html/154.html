<div id="ygrps-yiv-131703004">Woah, never thought about that, great idea!!!!  I bet those 2 would love the idea of<br/>
a Gay guild on Everquest.  I have never read the advocate but I know XY has a gaming<br/>
section.<br/>

&gt; Exactly Wampir.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I, in fact, already have a character on Bristle and Veeshan, and will create them<br/>
&gt; on other servers as needed. And then hand the guild chapters over to others. I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; start making a list of who will be the guildmaster on each server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The big issue of course is reaching out to other GLBT people. One day I did a<br/>
&gt; search for the words &quot;everquest&quot; and &quot;westhollywood&quot; so I could find people on<br/>
&gt; geocities and that&#39;s how I found Rhonda and then she told Hamlet, and they both<br/>
&gt; joined. We&#39;ve all got to get creative and think of more ways. And when we find<br/>
&gt; one person, they usually know others, so it could snowball pretty fast.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will try to send a press release to the Advocate for their cyber column as well<br/>
&gt; as XY magazine. But it will take awhile for that to have an effect since they<br/>
&gt; have long lead times. In the press release, which I will post here for review<br/>
&gt; first, I will mention EQ_Rainbow and the guild.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone else have ideas?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello all.<br/>
&gt; &gt; One thing I think everyone should know. We only need ten people to get the<br/>
&gt; &gt; guild started, and they dont all have to have a player on the same server.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Which means that a guild can start basicly on all the servers once it has<br/>
&gt; &gt; been approved. Only thing is the guild master has to have a char on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; server to petition and get it created. After the guild has been created on a<br/>
&gt; &gt; server if the guildmaster doesnt want to be the guildmaster on that server he<br/>
&gt; &gt; can hand it off.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So what I am basicly saying is. Even thought I dont have the time to play a<br/>
&gt; &gt; char on the ber server I will be there tonight to help get the guild started.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If David doent want to be the guildmaster on my particular<br/>
&gt; &gt; server(bristlebane) I would be happy to take over for him. All he would need<br/>
&gt; &gt; to do is start a temp char. Petition for the guild. Then hand it over to me<br/>
&gt; &gt; or whom every they want.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So if you do not play on the roleplay server please dont fell left out. I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure when Unity is made. You will quickly see the guild all over.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Going on the old 10% rule. There  should be almost 2000 GLBT people playing<br/>
&gt; &gt; the game. They just are not on this list.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Let me know what you think<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
