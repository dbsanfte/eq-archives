<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-33172889">Wow...it is so great to see this list really taking off :)<br/>
<br/>
Just a brief intro...I&#39;m a 23 year old gay male also living in Toronto (waves to his neighbour Christina *grin*)<br/>
and am currently enrolled in a Computer Programming degree.<br/>
<br/>
I have been playing EQ quite awhile now, yet usually only get my chars to level 10 or so before trying yet another class!<br/>
(Hence my Supernewbie status *grin*)<br/>
I think this list is a great idea as it is good to know I am not the only non-hetero addicted to this game.<br/>
<br/>
I am planning on starting another level 1...probably on the new server, maybe if anyone is interested they might give me a shout...<br/>
but probably many of you are quite attached to your current personas. *smile*<br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to seeing many more posts and thanks again Christina for getting the ball rolling!<br/>
<br/>
Todd :)</div>
