<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767515086">My vote is for Mystic Alliance. I like the idea of how we were all driven to<br/>
come together (kind of like Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind). Our backstory<br/>
can easily be modified to incorporate this.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I don&#39;t think this name is used yet. And no one seemed to say they liked<br/>
my idea of &quot;Minions of Dedric&quot;, so... (hehe)<br/>
<br/>
This weekend, on Brell Serilis, let&#39;s see how many of us in the range of lvl<br/>
4-7 can get together and hunt in Greater Faydark. I can get to that zone in a<br/>
few minutes from Ak&#39;anon, and I know Bambus goes there too. Anyone else. We<br/>
can hunt at an Orc camp if we get a big enough group. Maybe we can all end the<br/>
weekend 3 levels higher, eh?<br/>
