I got an email from E&#39;ci GM, Kyala. She tells me the only guild she has<br/>
listed is the &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; guild. So, I think it looks like<br/>
Verant just made a typo somewhere along the line and that there are not<br/>
2 different guilds. I have given her some additional information she<br/>
requested and am awaiting further word from her.<br/>
