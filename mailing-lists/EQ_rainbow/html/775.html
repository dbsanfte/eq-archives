&gt; I took the plunge and created a new character on RN this evening. My new<br/>
&gt; High Elf Cleric, Kythwin began his existence in that hellhole of a zone<br/>
&gt; known as the Greater Faydark (dark, no loot, too many people and all<br/>
&gt; that infernal shouting!). After a couple of hours, I had him up to 3rd<br/>
&gt; level and it was off to Freeport, a place I find much more congenial. I<br/>
&gt; guess you could say that Kyth is like most gay men, began life in<br/>
&gt; someplace dim and depressing but took off at the first opportunity for<br/>
&gt; the big bright city!! Now I hope to make contact with someone from<br/>
&gt; Mystic Alliance and join up as soon as possible...I will be keeping my<br/>
&gt; eyes open as I bash those ugly orcs over the head and hope to see<br/>
&gt; someone soon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Vince<br/>
&gt; Kythwin, Cleric of the Tunare, 3rd Circle<br/>
