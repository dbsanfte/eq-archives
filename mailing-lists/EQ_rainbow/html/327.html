&lt;&lt; Jeez!<br/>
 <br/>
 I am a lvl 13 wizard and I need a shoulder to cry on.  I have reached that<br/>
 stage where I have bcome bored and frustrated by EQ.  I can&#39;t find quality<br/>
 poelpe to quest with, most that I have found before are way past me now in<br/>
 level.  I am so fucing sick of going to the same places and getting hardly<br/>
 any expeirence, and spending half the time meditating.  what do I do!!!???<br/>
 Woe is me!   how did you all get past this time?   Is there anyplace I<br/>
 sbould go to get good exp or items?  I dont ave anything cool or any<br/>
 latinum I am pathetic....|:(  &lt;snif&gt;<br/>

First thing you need to do is loose the self pity...:-)<br/>
<br/>
Next Depending on your Class Race Lev. Do some traveling.  Even if your a <br/>
Darkelf at elv 13 you can go just about anywhere you want to.  I&#39;m not saying <br/>
you can fight anywhere you want to. but you can go anywhere you want to. Find <br/>
some people near your lev to fight with. Sometimes a shout is not the best <br/>
way to find a group. exp at lower teens. Walk up on a group, and ask nicely <br/>
if they have room for another. You will meet the sh8t heads that are rude. <br/>
Just ingor them, dont let them get to you. Above all elce have some fun. Even <br/>
dieing can be fun if you look at it the right way.<br/>
<br/>
