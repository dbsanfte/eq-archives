<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899769387">I have seen Fabian! I was exploring HK just yesterday & saw him <br/>
there -- don&#39;t remember what room, but I do remember seeing the name!<br/>
<br/>
  Also, if you tell the NPC female dwarf (Glorin something-or-other) <br/>
who hangs out on the end of the BB docks &#39;I love you&#39;, she will <br/>
respond &quot;Glorin & &lt;your name&gt;. We would make a wonderful couple.&quot; or <br/>
something very similar -- may not have the exact quote right.<br/>
<br/>
  Hehe, I loved all of those! I always laugh when I see some of the <br/>
weird names, & then consider the &#39;official naming policy rule&#39; on<br/>
joke names -- as if!<br/>
