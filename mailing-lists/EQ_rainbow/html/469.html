<div id="ygrps-yiv-594644036">David and all,<br/>
<br/>
I have my server ready to roll and can host the website directly from here.<br/>
The site address is not set went but will getting a domian soon. I have<br/>
obtained cold fusion so the databse idea for members to place their<br/>
characters, server and stats upon the site should be easily setup and going.<br/>
I have secured the real information behind my secure wall and will be<br/>
accessible by password and username. I hate to do this but to keep people<br/>
from being harassed it would be the best way.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a list of ideas I have about adding to the site.<br/>
<br/>
Message Board<br/>
Possible Chat room for real-time conversation<br/>
Guild Members Database<br/>
    This will include<br/>
<br/>
    Character Name<br/>
    Level<br/>
    Race<br/>
    Class<br/>
    Server<br/>
    email address<br/>
<br/>
    Also have the idea about placing a skill section so you can specify the<br/>
skill you have and what levels, could be helpful for a tailor looking to get<br/>
items enchanted by an Enchanter. This will help to get guild member out to<br/>
assist others in there adventures. The email address can be used to allow<br/>
others to contact you about the services they may require of a specific<br/>
character. I will place a way to search the listings for specific<br/>
information and whether someone wishes to provide these services.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if there are any other ideas that you may want to see added to<br/>
the site. The base site can be available pretty quickly but the advanced<br/>
items will take sometime to complete. If anyone wishes to help please let me<br/>
know, I will gladly accept any assist. We will need graphics and if we can<br/>
devise a logo that would be great.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, David I will gladly take on the role of guild master or officer for<br/>
the E&#39;Ci server. I am on quite regularly and my character is a decent level<br/>
so I can get pretty much anywhere (as long as I sneak about, LOL). Let me<br/>
know what I can do to help.<br/>
<br/>
I have been staying in Northern Ro mostly so anyone in that area, give me a<br/>
tell. To all of you I just want to say that if you ever need anything in the<br/>
game let me know I will be more than glad to do what I can!<br/>
<br/>
May prosperity be in all your endeavors,<br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt;If I see him online, I am tempted to do a tell to him and tell him I saw<br/>
&gt;their<br/>
&gt;&gt;web site, and am very supportive of gay people and wish his guild luck<br/>
&gt;&gt;(pretending I&#39;m straight of course.) He may decide to delete the thing<br/>
&gt;himself<br/>
&gt;&gt;if I do that. If I do it, I&#39;ll be sure to /log first to record everything<br/>

&gt;Ooooo!  Ooooo!  I could do it.  But on a more serious note wouldn&#39;t without<br/>
&gt;your knowing or in the middle of GM discussions ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And on the website, great!  I wonder if I can bug a friend and see what<br/>
&gt;royalty free graphics we can dig up ... I also can do Logo-type graphics<br/>
&gt;and have had some companies and groups use mine before, I still have my<br/>
&gt;graphics package (I bought it).  If anyone has freehand graphics though, I<br/>
&gt;do have a scanner and can scan if they are sent to me and get it in a<br/>
&gt;variety of graphics formats (as well as photo touch-up work, etc ...).<br/>
