<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-365967247">Morning all of you! I just hit level 20 last night and other than getting a<br/>
SURNAME, I was told of a DAMAGE cap that is removed ONCE you get to this<br/>
level. True enough, my hits we a LOT harder than they used to be! I have a<br/>
12 dmg and 48 delay weapon that woould hit for 20 or so on a GOOD day, but<br/>
after hitting 20th last night, I was doing, normally, 32pts of damge with<br/>
CRITICALS of up to 62pts of damage! WOW! No wonder you see warrior taking<br/>
on Sand and Hill giants!<br/>
So, keep pushing for level 20 you all! You WON&#39;T regret it!<br/>
<br/>
HUGS!<br/>
