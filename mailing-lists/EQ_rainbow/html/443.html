<div id="ygrps-yiv-972609245">After reading that Tigerhawk thought it was an LGBT guild, I too feared a<br/>
conflict. However, the size of the guild there (I&#39;ve catalogued 16 or more<br/>
members by typing /w all mystical) and the fact that many are on simultaneously<br/>
makes me think that it is being run as just a regular guild.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there is no way to read the charter anywhere. Once it goes to Verant,<br/>
they&#39;re the only ones who see it. I suspect this Tarisimo just saw our guild<br/>
name on the approved list, liked the name, and noticed that no one on his server<br/>
was a member. I think he then concocted some story to get the GM to set up the<br/>
tags for him. Of all the ones to pick, he just happened to pick an LGBT one,<br/>
unbeknownst to him. I actually think it is kinda funny.<br/>
<br/>
If I see him online, I am tempted to do a tell to him and tell him I saw their<br/>
web site, and am very supportive of gay people and wish his guild luck<br/>
(pretending I&#39;m straight of course.) He may decide to delete the thing himself<br/>
if I do that. If I do it, I&#39;ll be sure to /log first to record everything for<br/>
you all to see.<br/>
<br/>
I am having trouble meeting up with the GM to get this fixed. Were I only on the<br/>
west coast... I /petitioned and had to go to bed at 11pm eastern. I left my<br/>
character logged in and at some point, the GM did try to talk to me. I will<br/>
probably try to just do a /tell tonight and ask if I can avoid doing another<br/>
petition since I&#39;ve been in the queue for a total of 15 hours or more so far.<br/>
I&#39;ll let everyone know if I am successful.<br/>
<br/>
On Saturday and Sunday, I will be playing off and on throughout the day. So, if<br/>
you are on another server and you see a GM online, come on over to Brell Serilis<br/>
and give my Dedric character a tell and I&#39;ll see if I can rush on over and<br/>
/petition on your server to get the tags set up.<br/>
<br/>
I am also planning to work on a web site this weekend. I will probably not have<br/>
any graphics in the first version, but want to get the charter and other vital<br/>
info. up first, then the artists among us can submit images.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to all,<br/>
