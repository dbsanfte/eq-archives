<b>Subject:</b> Low level twinks <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120550821">As a guide, I usually get one petition a week from someone whose twink&#39;s<br/>
body has decayed.  Unfortunately there is nothing I can do.  I am not<br/>
personally opposed to twinking, and I feel genuinely sad whenever a person<br/>
loses their items and equipment to corpse decay.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who don&#39;t know, the corpse decay rules are that from levels<br/>
1-5 your corpse decays very quickly (less than half an hour) so twinking<br/>
a character level 1-5 is very dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
I have twinked characters myself, but generally don&#39;t give them anything<br/>
of importance until they hit level 6.<br/>
