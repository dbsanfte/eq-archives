<div id="ygrps-yiv-755589101">Hi you all! I just went to the basement of UNREST! SHUDDER! Other than the<br/>
HAGs and CRYPT Mummies it was a nice visit... NOT! I have a 35th level<br/>
Paladin I was on with and went to meet someone...within ONE minute, the two<br/>
ghastlies had knocked me for over 800pts of damage! If it werent for LAY<br/>
HANDS Id have been a resident of UNREST Myself!<br/>
     The main reason I was there was to see what treasure the GHOST on the<br/>
bottom level had. I know he has a Jagged ring of AC 5 and +3 str but what<br/>
else? Is there anything else in that place worth bothering with? I&#39;d love<br/>
to know! OH! Those of you who want to make lots of plat without doing those<br/>
silly POTTERY classes..TRY HIGHHOLD KEEP! The Goblins there usually carry<br/>
SWEET amounts of ARMOR and Plat on them!<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to you all!@<br/>
<br/>
