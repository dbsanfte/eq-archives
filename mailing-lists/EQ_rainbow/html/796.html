<br/>
<br/>
1.  Never raise your hands to kids. It leaves your groin<br/>
unprotected.<br/>
<br/>
2. I&#39;m not into working out. My philosophy is no pain, no pain.<br/>
<br/>
3. I&#39;m in shape. Round is a shape.<br/>
<br/>
4. I&#39;m desperately trying to figure out why Kamikaze pilots wore<br/>
helmets.<br/>
<br/>
5. Do illiterate people get the full effect of alphabet soup?<br/>
<br/>
6. I&#39;ve always wanted to be somebody, but I should have been more<br/>
specific.<br/>
<br/>
7. Ever notice when you blow in a dog&#39;s face he gets mad at you, but<br/>
when you take him in a car he sticks his head out the window?<br/>
<br/>
8. Ever notice that anyone going slower than you is an idiot, but<br/>
anyone going faster is a maniac?<br/>
<br/>
9. You have to stay in shape. My mother started walking five miles a<br/>
day when she was 35. She&#39;s 70 now and we have no idea where she is.<br/>
<br/>
10. I have six locks on my door, all in a row. When I go out, I lock<br/>
every other one. I figure no matter how long somebody stands there<br/>
picking the locks, they are always locking three of them.<br/>
<br/>
11. One out of every three Americans is suffering from some form of<br/>
mental illness. Think of two of your best friends. If they are OK, then<br/>
it must be you.<br/>
<br/>
12. They show you how detergents take out bloodstains. I think if<br/>
you&#39;ve got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe your laundry isn&#39;t<br/>
your biggest problem.<br/>
<br/>
13. If you ask certain people why they have deer heads on their walls, they<br/>
usually tell you it&#39;s because they&#39;re such beautiful animals. I think my<br/>
significant other is<br/>
very attractive, but I only have photos of them on the wall.<br/>
<br/>
14. A lady came up to me on the street, pointed at my black leather jacket<br/>
and<br/>
said,<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t you know a cow was murdered for that jacket?&quot;<br/>
and I said &quot;I didn&#39;t know there were any witnesses. Now I&#39;ll have to kill<br/>
you too&quot;.</div>
