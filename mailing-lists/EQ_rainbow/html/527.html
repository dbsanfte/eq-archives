<div id="ygrps-yiv-934142121">Congratulations, Christina!<br/>
<br/>
I would love to say that I&#39;ll be there, but my partner and I are out of town<br/>
this weekend (including Friday) to get away and see Lily Tomlin (I am sooo<br/>
psyched!).<br/>
<br/>
Both of us wish you the best of luck in the online marriage. It should be<br/>
great on the Sisters&#39; Isle. I was there for the first time this last weekend.<br/>
Takes a little bit of boat time to get there, but a nice, peaceful place for<br/>
such a ceremony.<br/>
<br/>
It has been interesting to learn of the development of the relationship. It is<br/>
an interesting perspective coming out in the game. Kinda brings up all those<br/>
old memories, even if a person has been out for what seems like eons in RL!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can send along screen shots, would love to see them. Again, congrats<br/>
and best of luck. Keep filling us in on the details as they unfold.<br/>
<br/>
