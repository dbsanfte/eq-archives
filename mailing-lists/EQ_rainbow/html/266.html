<div id="ygrps-yiv-987889297">It&#39;s not a banable thing.  And whether or not it&#39;s bad depends on you.  I have <br/>
been given items that were higher than I might have normally and have been true <br/>
power leveling.  I don&#39;t see any problem with it, but it&#39;s just me.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
ruin the game for me or hurt anyone in the process.  I know some people who <br/>
think getting a gift from another player is wrong if that gift is too high for <br/>
you (I got a Staff of Writhing at 20, can&#39;t be used until 25).  It&#39;s a personal <br/>
preference, and I don&#39;t think you are actually power leveling, there is <br/>
actually a faster way if you have a higher level there to help you, and that&#39;s <br/>
power leveling.  Just decide how you feel about it and go from there.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hey all, I have a general question. Is powerleveling a bad thing ?  I have<br/>
&gt; fallen behind my friends ingame they all are 4-5 lvls at least ahead of me.<br/>
&gt; This is due to my lack of playing time lately. I play alot too.. but work<br/>
&gt; the last few weeks is sucking up the time. So i want to catch up pretty<br/>
&gt; close to them. so they took me to lake rathier, and in a place close to<br/>
&gt; zone, where i can powerlevel and zone when i am bout ta croak.  Is this<br/>
&gt; considered twinking ? i do the fighting, well as much as my mage can<br/>
&gt; handle.. but is this a bad thing to do ? is it banable ? i like it alot and<br/>
&gt; can level faster here..<br/>
