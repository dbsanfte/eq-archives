<div id="ygrps-yiv-527016930">Heya!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
didint get my CD yet but i am getting really excited.  I&#39;m making a monk!<br/>
:)  I&#39;m going to amke a femalre though cuz i like the way they look.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On a sad note, had a BAD experience last night.  I was in a group in<br/>
infected paw and my boyfreind was in another group in the same zone.  One<br/>
of my group members kepot going near their &quot;camp&quot; and so Rob (my bf) asked<br/>
me to telkl him not to, which i did.  he then said &quot;who said that?  I will<br/>
kill him hehehe&quot; just joking and all, and i said &quot;well it was my love who<br/>
said it so if you killed him i would ahve to kill you, and shoot a frosy<br/>
bolt up your ictchy arse&quot; (as i am a wizard and heois a troll)  then he<br/>
said &quot;YOUR LOVE IS A MAN&quot; and i said &quot;yes i am gay, deal&quot; and he procceded<br/>
to say &quot;i ahve been grouped side by side witha  fag!&quot;  and then disbanded<br/>
and shouted &quot;I;m surrounded by freaks&quot;  needless to say he was repoirted,<br/>
but i dont tihnk a GM was on...maybe our little guide friend can look into<br/>
this....his name was Slamuk...no pressure, and i didint even suggest that<br/>
:)   Luckily the other poeple in the group were great and thought he was<br/>
stupd and our replacement tank asked why our last one ran aorund screeming<br/>
and we told him and he was pissed and thought it was absurd...so that was<br/>
cool<br/>
<br/>
have fun in kunark!<br/>

&gt; Ok, this might just be a rant, but since it&#39;s non hostile I&#39;m going to post it here =)<br/>

&gt; WOW Iksar are so cute.  The first time I ever saw one I was like...oh my gosh! It walks around and swings its little tail and talks and everything! It&#39;s like the best pet!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And Kunark is very pretty.  Lots of fun new zones, with cool looking critters.  It&#39;s pretty obvious to me you could hunt in Kunark and never leave, and get all the way to 50.  It seems a self sufficient continent.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kunark is dangerous though, I have talked to a lot of people who brought their mains over and got stomped by something.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The solution to all this is...make an Iksar shaman! You get SOW at 9th level and you can explore like crazy.  Team up with a friend and make an Iksar monk, and you have a great 2-person leveling/exploring team especially for low levels.  FYI Iksar have regeneration, and the highest wis of the shaman races, making them the best shaman and monk races IMHO (though they aren&#39;t as cute as Duna).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Rumor: Iksar do not get the inherent haste that human monks get at level 20+)<br/>
