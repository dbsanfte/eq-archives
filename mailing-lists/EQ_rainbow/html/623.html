&gt;Ok, this might just be a rant, but since it&#39;s non hostile I&#39;m going to post <br/>
&gt;it here =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;WOW Iksar are so cute.  The first time I ever saw one I was like...oh my <br/>
&gt;gosh! It walks around and swings its little tail and talks and everything! <br/>
&gt;It&#39;s like the best pet!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And Kunark is very pretty.  Lots of fun new zones, with cool looking <br/>
&gt;critters.  It&#39;s pretty obvious to me you could hunt in Kunark and never <br/>
&gt;leave, and get all the way to 50.  It seems a self sufficient continent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Kunark is dangerous though, I have talked to a lot of people who brought <br/>
&gt;their mains over and got stomped by something.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The solution to all this is...make an Iksar shaman! You get SOW at 9th <br/>
&gt;level and you can explore like crazy.  Team up with a friend and make an <br/>
&gt;Iksar monk, and you have a great 2-person leveling/exploring team <br/>
&gt;especially for low levels.  FYI Iksar have regeneration, and the highest <br/>
&gt;wis of the shaman races, making them the best shaman and monk races IMHO <br/>
&gt;(though they aren&#39;t as cute as Duna).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(Rumor: Iksar do not get the inherent haste that human monks get at level <br/>
&gt;20+)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
