<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-36701690">I have emailed Kyala to see if we can make some progress that way. It<br/>
has been impossible for me to catch up to her in game as I am on the<br/>
East coast and she works late times on the west coast. I&#39;ve spent 20+<br/>
hours in the petition queue, and refuse to do that again.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, the email will allow us to resolve this. I&#39;ll update everyone<br/>
when I get some news, but since I didn&#39;t have any yet, I was just going<br/>
to wait.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, she will check email before she goes online and send me a<br/>
reply. I think I have an idea of what might have happened to cause this<br/>
and am asking her for some information which will confirm (or not) my<br/>
hypothesis.<br/>
<br/>
Also, until I get an answer, I have to suspend efforts to get the guild<br/>
going on other servers. I will elaborate more after I have solid<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who has been helping with this and also, thanks for<br/>
your patience.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
David</div>
