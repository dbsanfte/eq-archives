<div id="ygrps-yiv-712947908">Hi all Alexander here..........31 year old bi-male from Louisville Ky. Have been following the list for a few days now and have a quick question. Having dated many many male transsexxuals over the years am curious as to any males playing females on the Fennin Ro server..........seems like a perfect wya to avoid RL life harrassment etc. to get to-gether in an in game romance (though perhaps troublesome have never had a char in an online game romantically involved) any thoughts?</div>
