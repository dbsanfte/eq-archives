<div id="ygrps-yiv-432059388">Yeah, once you have a guild established with the 10 person requirement on<br/>
one server, the designated leader can go server to server and petition<br/>
during the set guild times and have that guild implemented on those other<br/>
servers as well (without having the original 10 along, or a new 10 people).<br/>

&gt; so what you are saying is that once a quild is started all you have to<br/>
&gt; do is tell the guild gm that you want to carry it over? so once you got<br/>
&gt; the orginal 10 people on the first server you can have 1 person on each<br/>
&gt; other server sort of like recruters? or do there have to be 10 people<br/>
&gt; also on the other servers?  well what ever the situation if we can get<br/>
&gt; it going on more than one server that would be great because i know that<br/>
&gt; there are other people on bristle bane server (my main server other than<br/>
&gt; the test server which i use soo little that it dont really count) which<br/>
&gt; btw i love what they are doing with rogues (no they are not turning on<br/>
&gt; their skills) now you can use both sneak and hide at the same time so<br/>
&gt; you can hide while you are moving at sneak speed!! they also upped the<br/>
&gt; effectiveness of back stab!! i cant wait until they start it up on the<br/>
&gt; regular servers!!<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Well,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  My bf and i just made charchters on the  new roleplay server<br/>
&gt; but i still<br/>
&gt; &gt;  feel weirrd becasue i dont really ant to split my time between my other<br/>
&gt; &gt;  chatchter on Rodcet nife, or end up abdoning him!!! :(  My<br/>
&gt; boyfreind feels<br/>
&gt; &gt;  the same way, so maybe the multiple server guild idea is good!  I think<br/>
&gt; &gt;  that the unity suggestion is a good start, maybe the guild constitution<br/>
&gt; &gt;  (or whgatveer ytou call it) could be that we seeks to bring<br/>
&gt; all the races,<br/>
&gt; &gt;  sexes, sexual oreintatiin, species in Norrath togethe rin<br/>
&gt; unity :)   sound<br/>
&gt; &gt;  cool?  we should also state that it was started but GLBT poele<br/>
&gt; in norrath<br/>
&gt; &gt;  because they felt the pain of a dis-unified world..ehehhehe i<br/>
&gt; love it (i<br/>
&gt; &gt;  obviously am a role-player)  So thats my 10 cents, also I know<br/>
&gt; of 3 other<br/>
&gt; &gt;  poeple on Rodcet nife as of now that may be willing to join<br/>
&gt; thius kind of<br/>
&gt; &gt;  guild so if anyone on rodcet Nife would like to e-mial me and<br/>
&gt; let me know<br/>
&gt; &gt;  they want to be a part of it that would be cool, i wouldnt<br/>
&gt; mind being the<br/>
&gt; &gt;  guild master for Rodcet nife, maybe someone form each server should<br/>
&gt; &gt;  volunteer to do this so we can start to expedite things.  What<br/>
&gt; do you all<br/>
&gt; &gt;  think of thhis?   If it dosnt fly, looks like i&#39;[m be plkaying<br/>
&gt; on the new<br/>
&gt; &gt;  server a bit :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; A multi-server guild would be easy to create... I recently<br/>
&gt; started my own<br/>
&gt; &gt; guild, and in the approval letter it states: &quot;Now that your<br/>
&gt; guild has been<br/>
&gt; &gt; approved, you can start it on any and/or all servers of your<br/>
&gt; choice. Simply<br/>
&gt; &gt; contact a Guild GM during the specified hours for the specific server&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
