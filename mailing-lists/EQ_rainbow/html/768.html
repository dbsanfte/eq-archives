<div id="ygrps-yiv-936217687">Come on over! As David said, many of us have lowbies as well as our <br/>
mains. I have an 8th level monk in Qeynos as my secondary, & have<br/>
been considering starting an SK, or maybe a magician. So you can<br/>
definitely find some of us to hunt with, & we have new folks joining <br/>
all the time. Be sure to give Snapdragyn (my main -- 16th level<br/>
bard), or Gaistyd (the monk) a tell!<br/>

&gt; Hello All,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am pleased to now be a member of the EQ Rainbow board.  I found <br/>
&gt; your listing through one of the other EQ message boards.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been seriously thinking of relocating servers to join many<br/>
of <br/>
&gt; you on the Rodcet Nife server.  Currently i have several low level <br/>
&gt; characters on the Mithaniel Marr server, so if any of you are on <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; server please give me an in-game tell or email me (jdincinci@a...).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A little about me:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * James Dillon<br/>
&gt; * 28<br/>
&gt; * I live in Cincinnati, OH and work for an advertising agency as <br/>
&gt; their Information Systems person, i.e. Nick Burns (for all of you <br/>
&gt; Saturday Night Live fans).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Primary Character (right now):  Renette 10 Wood Elf Druid<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have several other characters, but Renette is the one i&#39;ve been <br/>
&gt; playing most lately.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Most Hated EQ Monster:  The Kerran High Guard.  My first character <br/>
&gt; was an Erudite Magician and i was one of the rare people that <br/>
&gt; actually hunted in Tox Forest and Kerra Isle.  That Kerran High <br/>
Guard <br/>
&gt; must have killed me 50 times before i decided to take my first boat <br/>
&gt; ride to Qeynos.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Favorite EQ Monster:  Spectre (Only because they are neat looking)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well i will stop there.  I will probably create a character on <br/>
Rodcet <br/>
&gt; Nife now just so i can have a fun group to chat with.  Do you have <br/>
&gt; any low level characters in your guild (Mystic Alliance)?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I am glad to have found this group and other gay people<br/>
that <br/>
&gt; like playing EQ...I knew you were out there!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
