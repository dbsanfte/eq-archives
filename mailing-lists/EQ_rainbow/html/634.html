<div id="ygrps-yiv-5874822">Greetings, EQers:<br/>
My name is Jack, and I&#39;m a new EQ player. I have to confess that my <br/>
partner Chris is actually the one that got addicted, and I thought it <br/>
would be &quot;the end&quot; if I didn&#39;t start playing, too! :)<br/>
<br/>
A while back there were a few Bears out there who played EQ on a <br/>
particular server, and I know that Chris has run across some of the <br/>
G/L/B/T PCs who buffed him, but disappeared before he could ask for <br/>
more guild info. Anyone out there know anything?<br/>
<br/>
I live in St. Louis, am a 34 year old Bear employed as a statistician <br/>
and research designer for a managed health company. Chris is an LA <br/>
native, and is a dba manager for a firm in Chicago. We&#39;ve been <br/>
together now for just over a year, hopefully to be together a <br/>
lifetime or two.<br/>
<br/>
Glad I found the list. I&#39;d love to hear from you folks!<br/>
Jack<br/>
