<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746020075">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Remember that song that came out a couple of years ago called<br/>
&quot;Kiss <br/>
the Rain&quot; by Billie Myers?  It was all over the radio stations,<br/>
and <br/>
then a remix of it came out on dance stations a few months later.  <br/>
The album was called &quot;Growing Pains,&quot; and it was a critical<br/>
success <br/>
for Billie.<br/>
<br/>
Well guess what, Billie Myers is back with a new album, Vertigo.  <br/>
Check out her new single, &quot;Am I Here Yet,&quot; which features<br/>
sample of <br/>
Hot Chocolate&#39;s &quot;You Sexy Thing&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a preview of the album in real audio:<br/>

Well, even if you aren&#39;t familiar with Billie Myers, this is one <br/>
album that&#39;s definitely worth checking out.  Blurring the lines <br/>
between rock, pop and, soul, with songs like &quot;Am I Here Yet&quot; <br/>
or &quot;Should I Call You Jesus,&quot; Vertigo strongly mirrors the<br/>
woman that <br/>
Billie Myers has become. The album just hit the stores on June 6th, <br/>
so you should definitely check it out.   Now, here&#39;s a flash card <br/>
from the album, from Billie to all of you.  Check it out and pass it <br/>
along. <br/>
