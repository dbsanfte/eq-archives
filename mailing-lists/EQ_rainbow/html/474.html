<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218116226">Cool, Christina. Glad it went so well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been tempted to come out to female characters I&#39;ve known, but you never know<br/>
for sure if the person behind the character is a female or a male, and it&#39;s been<br/>
my experience that women are more mature about such things than men (or rather the<br/>
14 year old boys who play EQ).<br/>
<br/>
She sounds like the kind of person we&#39;d like to have in our guild. Hope things<br/>
continue to go smoothly there.</div>
