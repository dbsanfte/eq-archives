<div id="ygrps-yiv-320287132">Here&#39;s what&#39;s happened since Tuesday morning...<br/>
<br/>
1) Signed on at 5am CST..saw someone on E&#39;ci with the &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot;<br/>
name by theirs. They were nonresponsive..probably AFK. They ran off and I<br/>
continued to try and say Hi to them and they ignored me.<br/>
<br/>
2) Talked to a Tigerhawk Wensday morning. VERY nice person. I asked him<br/>
about the guild and he told me he knew it was a<br/>
Gay/Bi/Lesbian/Transgendered etc. guild and loved the idea.<br/>
<br/>
3) Wensday afternoon I spoke with the Guild leader (Tarismo), and it wasn&#39;t<br/>
David, and he was very upset that &#39;we&#39; were trying to take HIS guild away<br/>
from him. He told me it was DEFINATELY NOT based on what we had intended as<br/>
a guild, even though Tigerhawk said differently. He said that HE was first<br/>
and he would NOT allow ANYONE to take the guild away from him. I told him<br/>
that there must be a mix up and he should contact Verant to clear it up. He<br/>
exploded on me about that. I told him he should talk to a GM and not yell<br/>
at me because I had no power. After this he refused to reply to any tells.<br/>
<br/>
4) I petitioned a junior GM and told them about the guild mixup etc. and he<br/>
promised to esculate it to the powers that be. I thanked him and went about<br/>
my gaming.<br/>
<br/>
5) At 11:45 pm I was getting ready to log after a lot of fun at Lake Rather<br/>
when I got a tell from one of their members accusing me of starting rumors.<br/>
He was VERY mean and would not listen to reason. I explained what had<br/>
happened and why the confusion but he then became more abusive. After a<br/>
minute or so, several other of their guild started sending really mean..and<br/>
I DO mean EVIL tells to me about this. I told them to let Verant/GMs take<br/>
it from here but they verbally assaulted over and over. I eventually calmed<br/>
them down and logged for the night.<br/>
<br/>
     Man...this is crazy. I don&#39;t KNOW what&#39;s happened but I think David is<br/>
right that we may have to delete the guild and start over again. Though<br/>
with people like I met last night, I think it will be rather rough trying<br/>
to parley with them about this mix up.<br/>
