<br/>
Well if you ever decide to venture into the Rodcet Nife again, give me a<br/>
tell, Im always looking for a adventure. I am sort of broke for now because<br/>
I was busy twinking Daevan, who is the &quot;Super Twink&quot; but that will change as<br/>
Tonight I begin my Power leveling of Nate and the money just rolls in again,<br/>
so until I get my Hi-Elven ass out of the E commons area, Ill be in Guk<br/>
trying to make some money and Levels:o)If you see me on, give me a tell even<br/>
if just to say Hi, and that goes for everyone on the Rodcet Nife.. I don&#39;t<br/>
bite, (well unless you want me to)<br/>
<br/>
Nate Bites Gooeypoo on the leg<br/>
Gooeypoo shivers at the thought of messing with Nate<br/>
Nate grabs Gooeypoo and shows him how to two step :o)J/K (I dont know how to<br/>
do that)<br/>
<br/>
Nate  Elvenstar 31 Mage<br/>
Daevan &quot;Super Twink&quot; 9 Druid<br/>

Hello again!         December 8th<br/>
<br/>
Good news for me!  The person that was going to buy my<br/>
account backed out so I can keep my old account on<br/>
xegony ..<br/>
<br/>
If anyone on this list is on xegony and wants to<br/>
group, my characters are:<br/>
Gaelad 50 DE enchanter<br/>
Cenen 27 human necro<br/>
Leafe 18 WE druid<br/>
Gooeypoo 1 Ogre shaman :)<br/>
<br/>
of course that means I can also pick back up on rodcet<br/>
with my character there :)<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Well.. it&#39;s December 6th and the list has been<br/>
&gt; pretty<br/>
&gt; quiet.  =)  Here&#39;s what&#39;s up with me...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I sold my account (Gaelad on Xegony) since I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think I was going to be able to play after my hand<br/>
&gt; surgery (and after losing interest in the game), but<br/>
&gt; my hand is better so I am starting over.  I was just<br/>
&gt; curious of what servers had the most of &quot;us&quot; that<br/>
&gt; gets<br/>
&gt; this list--and is there anyone on Xegony??   =)  <br/>
