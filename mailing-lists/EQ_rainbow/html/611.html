<div id="ygrps-yiv-637920926">I actually may have a clue too.<br/>
<br/>
There has been a running debate on if the low level Bard song<br/>
for stamina helps mana regen. It brought out some interesting <br/>
side effects.<br/>
<br/>
Many mages said they &quot;saw&quot; a difference, but EQ staff on the Bard<br/>
list eventually said it had no effect.<br/>
<br/>
So the Bards fiddled with it a bit (pun intended).<br/>
<br/>
It seems that many stamina buffs will cause the &quot;ticker&quot; to update<br/>
faster. BUT before you get excited, the total time it takes to<br/>
go from 1 bubble to full (in mana) does not vary, just the rate at<br/>
which the changes are displayed.  The Bards found several mages<br/>
and asked them to time the total refill time as well as time the<br/>
&quot;ticker&quot; or visual update timer.  They then tested with and w/o song.<br/>
The data fit both what the mages saw and the EQ staff info.  The <br/>
&quot;ticker&quot; times could vary, fooling you into thinking it was filling faster,<br/>
but the refill total time was pretty constant.  If a true mana regen spell or<br/>
song was put in effect *then* the total refill time was indeed reduced.<br/>
<br/>
So, were you under any stamina buffs?  They can give an illusion.  <br/>
