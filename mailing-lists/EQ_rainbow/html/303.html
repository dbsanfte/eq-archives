<div id="ygrps-yiv-101638603">I would just like to thank all of those that responded to my msg.  I feel alot better now, partly from venting, partly from your help and partly from realizing what my main problem was.<br/>
<br/>
I have been playing EQ every and I mean every day (except for downtime between beta and public) since November 11th.  I think I just had a breakdown from to much of the game.  My problem is I am extremely bored with the game but at the same time I can&#39;t stop playing.<br/>
<br/>
I have never had a problem with the gender thing before now.  People would ask me &quot;Are you a female in real life?&quot;  I would always answer them with this question, &quot;Are you a Wood Elf in real life?&quot;, that usualy shuts em up.<br/>
<br/>
I really hope this guild thing works out on Brell, I love grouping in EQ but it seems harder and harder every day to find a good group.  You guys seem like a very nice group of folks so I don&#39;t think that will be a prob.   =)<br/>
