<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099977655">Hi you all!<br/>
<br/>
     My name is Sandy and Im a bi single father of one. Ive been playing EQ<br/>
since about May and thuroughly ENJOY it! I didnt think you could have such<br/>
an addictive thing without it being ingestable! Eq is great! The GUILD idea<br/>
is great! The only troubles I see are seeking recruitment outside our list.<br/>
Unfortunately the general populace is Homophobic from what Ive seen on E&#39;ci<br/>
(Sad- yes). Though I may have some chance with contacts there of like mind<br/>
as us.<br/>
     My Characters on E&#39;ci are:<br/>
<br/>
          Jadeeye - 15th Level (14th now and then due to those pesky<br/>
Minotaurs) - Female Wood Elf Warrior<br/>
          Bealtaine - 6th Level Druid Male Half Elf - Got tired of asking<br/>
for SOW and BINDS...wanna make my own!<br/>
<br/>
     I will be on tonight for the meeting so no problem there. If any of<br/>
you are also on E&#39;ci drop me an email either here at my work emial or my<br/>
home one (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sandymann@...">sandymann@...</a>).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks youse all!<br/>
<br/>
Sandy<br/>

(Time to show Norrath what kind of Superheros we REALLY ARE! )</div>
