<div id="ygrps-yiv-250004892">Hiyas! regarding the Chaos war post:<br/>
   Some of these are a possibility, but I highly doubt (for one) that Halas <br/>
wont be able to be zoned into or out of ?   They wouldn&#39;t close off that zone <br/>
so that No one could start a barbarian while some war is going on(?!?!?).. if <br/>
they do thats rediculous! :)    But some of the ideas sound kinda nifty.. but <br/>
I also doubt that they would trash starting sitties, including Rivervale.. <br/>
(Yikes would they trash the zone music TOO?!? lol)  And cut off teleporting <br/>
to Karanas alltogether? Seems Kind of unlikely to me, unless they change <br/>
North Karana ring and or spires closer to Surefall, that would be nice!! hehe <br/>
(if they leave EK druid ring!!)  Oh well, I could be totally proved <br/>
wrong!!..but I&#39;m still excited either way!<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>
