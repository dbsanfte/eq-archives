      I want to thank you for starting this list. I have never been a very<br/>
outgoing gay person so I really appreciate this opportunity for us to talk<br/>
in  a friendly environment.<br/>
   Lavender- a little bit boy and a little bit girl, and sometimes very<br/>
confused :)<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone, my name is Christina, and I created EQ_rainbow.  I&#39;m happy to<br/>
see that 16 people have joined us in just 24 hours.  It&#39;s hard to tell with<br/>
something like this how quickly and how many people will join.  I&#39;m going to<br/>
use this message to say briefly why I created this list, and to tell you a<br/>
bit about who I am.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One of the first things I noticed in Everquest was that it prohibited<br/>
anti-gay guilds and harassment.  At the time I just thought &quot;cool&quot; and<br/>
brushed it off, but it kind of sunk in after a while.  It made me feel<br/>
comfortable as a bisexual woman, knowing that (officially at least)<br/>
homophobia was prohibited.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, in playing the game I noticed also that there was no queer<br/>
visibility.  I have seen a lot of heterosexual visibility, in particular<br/>
I&#39;ve seen a lot of het online marriages.  I&#39;ve thought sometimes about<br/>
defining one of my characters as a lesbian, but it&#39;s seemed like a daunting<br/>
task.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By forming EQ rainbow I&#39;ve hoped to meet other les/bi/gay/tg everquest<br/>
players, outside of the game, in a relaxed chat environment.  I&#39;m hoping<br/>
this will help me realize, and all of you realize, that we are out there,<br/>
playing that game, on every server!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just to give some biographical information on myself, I&#39;m a 26 year old<br/>
bisexual woman from Toronto Canada.  I work a computer programmer.  I do<br/>
volunteer work here in our amazing queer community, and I love it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope this list will be a positive space for all lesbian/gay/bi/tg<br/>
identified Everquest players.  I also want this list to welcome straight-ide<br/>
ntified and queer-positive Everquest players.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *hugs*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Christina<br/>
