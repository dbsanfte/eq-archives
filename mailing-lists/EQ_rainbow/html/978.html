Subject: &quot;Want To Buy A Plane?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hi, there! It&#39;s Steve...<br/>
  <br/>
Want To Buy A Plane? This funny was originally sent to me by my friend in Ireland, Tom├ís Kiely. Notice the U.K. spellings and usages of some words. Interesting. I have left them intact. Enjoy!-S.<br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
&quot;This was allegedly posted very briefly on the McDonnell Douglas Website by<br/>
an employee there who obviously has a sense of humour.  The company, of course, does not have a sense of humour, and made the web department take it down immediately (for once, the &#39;IMPORTANT&#39; note at the end is worth a read too...)<br/>
