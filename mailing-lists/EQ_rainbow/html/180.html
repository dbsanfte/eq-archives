<div id="ygrps-yiv-459293038">Here are some thoughts on our decision making process for the name of our<br/>
guild:<br/>
<br/>
1. There is no obvious good name that everyone will love.  It would have<br/>
already been suggested by now.<br/>
<br/>
2. Online discussion takes way way longer than real life discussion.<br/>
We&#39;re not all sitting in a room together chatting.  A conversation that<br/>
might take two minutes in a room can take a week online, as people<br/>
exchange ideas.<br/>
<br/>
3. Votes in online mediums take at least a week.  First someone has to set<br/>
a deadline for submission of named to be voted on.  Second, someone has to<br/>
extract all those names and post a list.  Third, we have to wait 48 hours<br/>
for people to vote.<br/>
<br/>
For all these reasons, I would like David to select a name based on our<br/>
discussion, but not governed by any official selection process (like a<br/>
vote).  I also think their should be a cap on discussion, and that cap<br/>
should be soon (like now perhaps 8)<br/>
<br/>
I think we generally agree that the most imporant thing is that the guild<br/>
exist with some name.<br/>
