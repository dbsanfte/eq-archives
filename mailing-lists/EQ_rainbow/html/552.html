&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hello everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is with a certain amount of sadness that I must announce that I will be<br/>
&gt; leaving the world of Norrath. There are many reasons for my decision, some<br/>
&gt; related to the game and some related to real life, but they have all added<br/>
&gt; up to make me decide it is time to leave the game. I&#39;ve not played now for<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; couple of weeks and have not suffered any withdrawal symptoms, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are several implications to my decision that affect the Mystic<br/>
&gt; Alliance guild. First, if you are trying to get the guild going on other<br/>
&gt; servers, please /petition the GMs and ask to get the guild set up as soon<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; possible so that I can help you if it should be necessary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Second, I would like to send a message to the Verant person in charge of<br/>
&gt; guilds to have someone else made the guild owner of record. This means I<br/>
&gt; need a volunteer. If we get no volunteers, it may make things difficult<br/>
&gt; setting up more chapters of the guild later.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Third, I need a person to be the guild master on Brell Serilis. Any<br/>
takers?<br/>
&gt; We need to reform the  guild on that server anyway to get the correct guil<br/>
d<br/>
&gt; name.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lastly, my two main Brell characters have some pretty good equipment and<br/>
&gt; cash that I would love to give to members of the guild. My level 21<br/>
&gt; necromancer, Dedric has full raw silk armor, RTS, Dagger of Marnek (sp?),<br/>
&gt; lots of containers, some level 16 and 20 spell scrolls, other misc. items<br/>
&gt; and over 100 PP in cash. I also have a lvl 4 warrior named Rainbow who has<br/>
&gt; partial rawhide armor, some nice FS weapons, a mino axe and some other<br/>
misc.<br/>
&gt; items, plus a little cash. (Note, that the highly coveted name of Rainbow<br/>
&gt; will also become available, so let me know if you are interested in making<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; new character with that name).  I would love to give all my stuff to my<br/>
&gt; guildmates, so let me know if any of you are interested. If anyone wanted<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; start a necro on Brell, now would be the time ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Finally, I would like to say that being a part of this mailing list has<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; a lot of fun and has enriched my life and my game-playing experience too.<br/>
&gt; While the list has been fairly quite lately and I have the feeling that<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; of my friends may have left the list, I plan to continue to stay on the<br/>
list<br/>
&gt; just to hear how things are going with all of you. You&#39;re a fun bunch and<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; do really care about you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hugs to all,<br/>
&gt; David<br/>
