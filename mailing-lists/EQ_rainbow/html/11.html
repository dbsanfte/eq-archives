<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157117494">Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I saw other people writing introductions and thought &quot;What the heck!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a 28 year old male living in the Midwest.  I&#39;ve had a partner for close to <br/>
6 years.  We will be moving to Connecticut in August for a company move.  I am <br/>
a computer programmer for a teleservices company.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say it&#39;s refreshing to be able to communicate with like minded <br/>
individuals about a game that I adore.  I only play one character - Sonderac, <br/>
High Elf Wizard (Karana Server).  It&#39;s a power thing, I want to get to level 50 <br/>
and float around having everyone be jealous =P~.  I did notice that most people <br/>
who have responded so far are in a computer related field, pattern or <br/>
coincidence? : )<br/>
<br/>
I have a small group of about 12 - 13 friends I hunt with online.  I&#39;ve had to <br/>
come out to two of the ladies, they started to &quot;fall&quot; for me (or so they say).  <br/>
So I decided instead of rejection I&#39;d just tell them the truth.  It hasn&#39;t <br/>
changed much, I can /tell them joking about more stuff now.  I don&#39;t go running <br/>
around chasing cute Barbarians or making blatant fashion statements. (although <br/>
I think about both) : ) : )<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy life, and think that it should be lived day to day with joy and <br/>
happiness.  I destroy anyone who tries to interfere with that goal. ;-&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is on the Karana server don&#39;t be afraid to give me a /tell, I don&#39;t <br/>
bite (unless paid) : ) : )<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone is doing well in the game and out.  Safe travels and happiness.<br/>
<br/>
Scotty<br/>
