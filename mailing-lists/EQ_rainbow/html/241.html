<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-361618404">Here&#39;s something to help all of you having troubles connecting or staying<br/>
on. First, let me introduce some of you to the wonders of TRACERT ! With<br/>
this handy dandy little utility you can see if any of the places we all<br/>
have to bounce around on while trying to get on Everquest is up or<br/>
SERIOUSLY laggy! Tracert is already on your machine (If you have windows<br/>
3.1/95/98 ). Open a DOS window while still in Windows and do this:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Once in the dos window you will see    C:&#92;WINDOWS|<br/>
2)  Type    cd&#92;  and press enter<br/>
3)  Now type TRACERT and then one of the following:<br/>
<br/>
     208.236.12.25   (This is the E&#39;ci server, but doesnt matter even if<br/>
you are Brell )<br/>
     or<br/>
     chat.everquest.com  then hit enter (Got these address from EQ)<br/>
<br/>
4)  After hitting enter, pay attention to the numbers that appear below.<br/>
This info tells you HOW MANY places you are bouncing around in to just get<br/>
to Everquest. Also, you will see numbers like   15ms or 17ms. This is the<br/>
time in MILLISECONDS it is taking to go from one NODE (bounce )to another.<br/>
IF you ever get an area that says: &quot;REQUEST TIMED OUT&quot;   then one of the<br/>
places you are bouncing to is down or just SO slow it doesnt carry a signal<br/>
fast enough to keep your computer from just dropping the whole connect<br/>
attempt.<br/>
<br/>
     I hope this helps you all out! It does me! Let&#39;s me know if I need to<br/>
YELL at my ISP or EQ!<br/>
Take care all!<br/>
<br/>
