I strongly recommend coming on over!<br/>
It&#39;s a lot of fun!<br/>
We have quickly become like a little family!  Heck some of us are family -<br/>
from 3 brothers who play to people having their significant others on as<br/>
well!<br/>
<br/>
And being a Dwarven Cleric - I would welcome any more clerics gladly!!<br/>
Our guild is already quite diverse and we all just recommend you pick a<br/>
character you want to play!<br/>
And you will find out that once you have gotten to a level - if you start a<br/>
new character it&#39;s easier to get up to that level, since you already know<br/>
what to do and what not to do!<br/>

Subject: [EQ_rainbow] Hello All<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Greetings:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just found out about EQ Rainbow through a long and contentious thread<br/>
&gt; started on an Everquest newsgroup. My first response to hearing about EQ<br/>
&gt; Rainbow made me laugh out loud: &quot;My God, there are others like me out<br/>
&gt; there!&quot; I had wondered if there were any other gay/lesbian players<br/>
&gt; around (I certainly hadn&#39;t met them).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am Vince Bowes, a Branch Supervisor of a public library in Toronto,<br/>
&gt; Canada. I&#39;ve been playing EQ off and on for about eight months. I have<br/>
&gt; two characters I play frequently on the Tribunal server, but I am<br/>
&gt; strongly considering ending them and starting over on the RN server<br/>
&gt; because I am really curious about the Mystic Alliance...but it will be<br/>
&gt; hard to drop my level 17 druid, Kestrelle. But it would be worthwhile to<br/>
&gt; talk to other gay players and be part of a truly &#39;open&#39; guild. Are there<br/>
&gt; any openings for a high elf cleric in the ranks? That&#39;s a class/race<br/>
&gt; combo I have been eager to try for some time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cya in Norrath folks!<br/>
