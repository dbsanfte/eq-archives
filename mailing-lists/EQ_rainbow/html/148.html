<b>Subject:</b> Hints from the family? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420338024">Hi i was curious if I ask the occasional hints if thats ok here or if you<br/>
all want me to ask elsewhere on another board?<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow here is my question.. What is the usage of  equipment that is magic<br/>
and has the same AC or +1 ac more than non magical equipment, eg. netted or<br/>
mesh other than having the item weigh less ? reason i am asking .. If you<br/>
are fully equiped to the gills with magic items is it possible that you are<br/>
considered a magic being and therefore you can&#39;t be hit by non magic melee<br/>
type weapons ? or is it just the weight issue that makes magic items with no<br/>
bonuses better ? Well I guess that could create game inbalance then, too<br/>
many would quest for the magic stuff to become semi invincible.<br/>
<br/>
So anyone here high level and been to either the HATE PLANE or the FEAR<br/>
PLANE ? I am very curious to hear of any stories on the planes.. That seems<br/>
to be my drive ingame to get high enough to go with a party to the planes<br/>
and see what they have to offer. did ya all like the warning they gave about<br/>
hate ?<br/>
<br/>
