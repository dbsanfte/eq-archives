Thanks for the invite.  I made a character (Jamses) this past weekend <br/>
and have already joined the guild.  I&#39;ve managed to get him to level <br/>
5 already and with the help and generosity of Hamyrmint made it <br/>
halfway through 5 in about a half hour :)<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to leveling Jamses further so I can group with more <br/>
members of MA.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>
Jamses, level 5 Magician<br/>

&gt; Welcome to the board, & I Hope you come over to Rodcet. It&#39;s a <br/>
great group<br/>
&gt; of folks, & there&#39;s almost always at least one other member on <br/>
(this morning<br/>
&gt; (7:30am EST) there were three of us, average is around 10-15 at <br/>
night.) Like<br/>
&gt; David said, there&#39;s characters of all different levels, & I seem to <br/>
love<br/>
&gt; hanging out in the single digits so much I doubt I&#39;ll ever get to <br/>
10!<br/>

&gt; Subject: [EQ_rainbow] Hello EQ Rainbow<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hello All,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am pleased to now be a member of the EQ Rainbow board.  I found<br/>
&gt; &gt; your listing through one of the other EQ message boards.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have been seriously thinking of relocating servers to join many <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; you on the Rodcet Nife server.  Currently i have several low level<br/>
&gt; &gt; characters on the Mithaniel Marr server, so if any of you are on <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; server please give me an in-game tell or email me <br/>
(jdincinci@a...).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A little about me:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; * James Dillon<br/>
&gt; &gt; * 28<br/>
&gt; &gt; * I live in Cincinnati, OH and work for an advertising agency as<br/>
&gt; &gt; their Information Systems person, i.e. Nick Burns (for all of you<br/>
&gt; &gt; Saturday Night Live fans).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Primary Character (right now):  Renette 10 Wood Elf Druid<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have several other characters, but Renette is the one i&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; &gt; playing most lately.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Most Hated EQ Monster:  The Kerran High Guard.  My first character<br/>
&gt; &gt; was an Erudite Magician and i was one of the rare people that<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually hunted in Tox Forest and Kerra Isle.  That Kerran High <br/>
Guard<br/>
&gt; &gt; must have killed me 50 times before i decided to take my first <br/>
boat<br/>
&gt; &gt; ride to Qeynos.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Favorite EQ Monster:  Spectre (Only because they are neat looking)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well i will stop there.  I will probably create a character on <br/>
Rodcet<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nife now just so i can have a fun group to chat with.  Do you have<br/>
&gt; &gt; any low level characters in your guild (Mystic Alliance)?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I am glad to have found this group and other gay people <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; like playing EQ...I knew you were out there!<br/>
