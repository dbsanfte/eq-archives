<b>Subject:</b> hate crime petition <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666867347">i had recently sent you all (i think all of you) a petition to broaden<br/>
the federal law of hate crimes to accept crimes based on sexual<br/>
orientation, and a couple of other things (i think based on sex was<br/>
included but not sure) one of you wrote me back saying please not to<br/>
send them any chain letters again, well i do not feel that this is a<br/>
chain letter (that is if it is not a hoax), i feel that this is a<br/>
political petition, but if any of you did not appriciate me sending this<br/>
to you then i send you my uptmost apologys, i do not mean to anger or<br/>
offend, thank you for your cooperation<br/>
<br/>
