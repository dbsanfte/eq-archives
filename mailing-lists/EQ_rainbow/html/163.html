&gt; I will try to send a press release to the Advocate for their cyber column as well<br/>

&gt; first, I will mention EQ_Rainbow and the guild.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone else have ideas?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello all.<br/>
&gt; &gt; One thing I think everyone should know. We only need ten people to get the<br/>
&gt; &gt; guild started, and they dont all have to have a player on the same server.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Which means that a guild can start basicly on all the servers once it has<br/>
&gt; &gt; been approved. Only thing is the guild master has to have a char on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; server to petition and get it created. After the guild has been created on a<br/>
&gt; &gt; server if the guildmaster doesnt want to be the guildmaster on that server he<br/>
&gt; &gt; can hand it off.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So what I am basicly saying is. Even thought I dont have the time to play a<br/>
&gt; &gt; char on the ber server I will be there tonight to help get the guild started.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If David doent want to be the guildmaster on my particular<br/>
&gt; &gt; server(bristlebane) I would be happy to take over for him. All he would need<br/>
&gt; &gt; to do is start a temp char. Petition for the guild. Then hand it over to me<br/>
&gt; &gt; or whom every they want.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So if you do not play on the roleplay server please dont fell left out. I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure when Unity is made. You will quickly see the guild all over.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Going on the old 10% rule. There  should be almost 2000 GLBT people playing<br/>
&gt; &gt; the game. They just are not on this list.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Let me know what you think<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
