<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950569409">Hey there, Don&#39;t stress.. I was at that level a while ago.. and to solve my<br/>
urge for boredom. It was the travelling that made my way fun again. I went<br/>
everywhere (well almost) and died a few times. I had fun and thats what my<br/>
game is about.. Having fun.. with friends I made. Trust me travelling to<br/>
places and testing your limits has got to be the best! Yes you die, and you<br/>
know dying is part of the game. Once I got over the fear of death I had alot<br/>
of fun. I mean I was not necessarily suicidal, I was cautious. I test out my<br/>
skills, learn, adventure and enjoy. Aren&#39;t you on the Rodcet Nife ? If you<br/>
are, You are more than welcome to join me in my travels. Ill take care of<br/>
u.. my friends and guildmates are wonderfull and your bound to have a good<br/>
time no matter what. We are all higher levels though, so exp would be eeh<br/>
for ya, but wed do our best to keep you alive and adventure as a team. Thats<br/>
that.. so im here for ya to cure your boredom blues<br/>

&lt;&lt; Jeez!<br/>
<br/>
 I am a lvl 13 wizard and I need a shoulder to cry on.  I have reached that<br/>
 stage where I have bcome bored and frustrated by EQ.  I can&#39;t find quality<br/>
 poelpe to quest with, most that I have found before are way past me now in<br/>
 level.  I am so fucing sick of going to the same places and getting hardly<br/>
 any expeirence, and spending half the time meditating.  what do I do!!!???<br/>
 Woe is me!   how did you all get past this time?   Is there anyplace I<br/>
 sbould go to get good exp or items?  I dont ave anything cool or any<br/>
 latinum I am pathetic....|:(  &lt;snif&gt;<br/>

First thing you need to do is loose the self pity...:-)<br/>
<br/>
Next Depending on your Class Race Lev. Do some traveling.  Even if your a<br/>
Darkelf at elv 13 you can go just about anywhere you want to.  I&#39;m not<br/>
saying<br/>
you can fight anywhere you want to. but you can go anywhere you want to.<br/>
Find<br/>
some people near your lev to fight with. Sometimes a shout is not the best<br/>
way to find a group. exp at lower teens. Walk up on a group, and ask nicely<br/>
if they have room for another. You will meet the sh8t heads that are rude.<br/>
Just ingor them, dont let them get to you. Above all elce have some fun.<br/>
Even<br/>
dieing can be fun if you look at it the right way.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO<br/>
