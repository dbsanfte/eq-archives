<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141798490">The Top 100 Things I&#39;d Do<br/>
If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord<br/>
<br/>
My Legions of Terror will have helmets with clear plexiglass visors, not <br/>
face-concealing ones.<br/>
<br/>
My ventilation ducts will be too small to crawl through.<br/>
<br/>
My noble half-brother whose throne I usurped will be killed, not kept <br/>
anonymously imprisoned in a forgotten cell of my dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
Shooting is not too good for my enemies.<br/>
<br/>
The artifact which is the source of my power will not be kept on the <br/>
Mountain of Despair beyond the River of Fire guarded by the Dragons of <br/>
Eternity. It will be in my safe-deposit box. The same applies to the object <br/>
which is my one weakness.<br/>
<br/>
I will not gloat over my enemies&#39; predicament before killing them.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;ve captured my adversary and he says, &quot;Look, before you kill me, will <br/>
you at least tell me what this is all about?&quot; I&#39;ll say, &quot;No.&quot; and shoot him. <br/>
No, on second thought I&#39;ll shoot him then say &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After I kidnap the beautiful princess, we will be married immediately in a <br/>
quiet civil ceremony, not a lavish spectacle in three weeks&#39; time during <br/>
which the final phase of my plan will be carried out.<br/>
<br/>
I will not include a self-destruct mechanism unless absolutely necessary. If <br/>
it is necessary, it will not be a large red button labelled &quot;Danger: Do Not <br/>
Push&quot;. The big red button marked &quot;Do Not Push&quot; will instead trigger a spray <br/>
of bullets on anyone stupid enough to disregard it. Similarly, the ON/OFF <br/>
switch will not clearly be labelled as such.<br/>
<br/>
I will not interrogate my enemies in the inner sanctum -- a small hotel well <br/>
outside my borders will work just as well.<br/>
<br/>
I will be secure in my superiority. Therefore, I will feel no need to prove <br/>
it by leaving clues in the form of riddles or leaving my weaker enemies <br/>
alive to show they pose no threat.<br/>
<br/>
One of my advisors will be an average five-year-old child. Any flaws in my <br/>
plan that he is able to spot will be corrected before implementation.<br/>
<br/>
All slain enemies will be cremated, or at least have several rounds of <br/>
ammunition emptied into them, not left for dead at the bottom of the cliff. <br/>
The announcement of their deaths, as well as any accompanying celebration, <br/>
will be deferred until after the aforementioned disposal.<br/>
<br/>
The hero is not entitled to a last kiss, a last cigarette, or any other form <br/>
of last request.<br/>
<br/>
I will never employ any device with a digital countdown. If I find that such <br/>
a device is absolutely unavoidable, I will set it to activate when the <br/>
counter reaches 117 and the hero is just putting his plan into operation.<br/>
<br/>
I will never utter the sentence &quot;But before I kill you, there&#39;s just one <br/>
thing I want to know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I employ people as advisors, I will occasionally listen to their <br/>
advice.<br/>
<br/>
I will not have a son. Although his laughably under-planned attempt to usurp <br/>
power would easily fail, it would provide a fatal distraction at a crucial <br/>
point in time.<br/>
<br/>
I will not have a daughter. She would be as beautiful as she was evil, but <br/>
one look at the hero&#39;s rugged countenance and she&#39;d betray her own father.<br/>
<br/>
Despite its proven stress-relieving effect, I will not indulge in maniacal <br/>
laughter. When so occupied, it&#39;s too easy to miss unexpected developments <br/>
that a more attentive individual could adjust to accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
I will hire a talented fashion designer to create original uniforms for my <br/>
Legions of Terror, as opposed to some cheap knock-offs that make them look <br/>
like Nazi stormtroopers, Roman footsoldiers, or savage Mongol hordes. All <br/>
were eventually defeated and I want my troops to have a more positive <br/>
mind-set.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how tempted I am with the prospect of unlimited power, I will not <br/>
consume any energy field bigger than my head.<br/>
<br/>
I will keep a special cache of low-tech weapons and train my troops in their <br/>
use. That way -- even if the heroes manage to neutralize my power generator <br/>
and/or render the standard-issue energy weapons useless -- my troops will <br/>
not be overrun by a handful of savages armed with spears and rocks.<br/>
<br/>
I will maintain a realistic assessment of my strengths and weaknesses. Even <br/>
though this takes some of the fun out of the job, at least I will never <br/>
utter the line &quot;No, this cannot be! I AM INVINCIBLE!!!&quot; (After that, death <br/>
is usually instantaneous.)<br/>
<br/>
No matter how well it would perform, I will never construct any sort of <br/>
machinery which is completely indestructible except for one small and <br/>
virtually inaccessible vulnerable spot.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how attractive certain members of the rebellion are, there is <br/>
probably someone just as attractive who is not desperate to kill me. <br/>
Therefore, I will think twice before ordering a prisoner sent to my <br/>
bedchamber.<br/>
<br/>
I will never build only one of anything important. All important systems <br/>
will have redundant control panels and power supplies. For the same reason I <br/>
will always carry at least two fully loaded weapons at all times.<br/>
<br/>
My pet monster will be kept in a secure cage from which it cannot escape and <br/>
into which I could not accidentally stumble.<br/>
<br/>
I will dress in bright and cheery colors, and so throw my enemies into <br/>
confusion.<br/>
<br/>
All bumbling conjurers, clumsy squires, no-talent bards, and cowardly <br/>
thieves in the land will be preemptively put to death. My foes will surely <br/>
give up and abandon their quest if they have no source of comic relief.<br/>
<br/>
All naive, busty tavern wenches in my realm will be replaced with surly, <br/>
world-weary waitresses who will provide no unexpected reinforcement and/or <br/>
romantic subplot for the hero or his sidekick.<br/>
<br/>
I will not fly into a rage and kill a messenger who brings me bad news just <br/>
to illustrate how evil I really am. Good messengers are hard to come by.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t require high-ranking female members of my organization to wear a <br/>
stainless-steel bustier. Morale is better with a more casual dress-code. <br/>
Similarly, outfits made entirely from black leather will be reserved for <br/>
formal occasions.<br/>
<br/>
I will not turn into a snake. It never helps.<br/>
<br/>
I will not grow a goatee. In the old days they made you look diabolic. Now <br/>
they just make you look like a disaffected member of Generation X.<br/>
<br/>
I will not imprison members of the same party in the same cell block, let <br/>
alone the same cell. If they are important prisoners, I will keep the only <br/>
key to the cell door on my person instead of handing out copies to every <br/>
bottom-rung guard in the prison.<br/>
<br/>
If my trusted lieutenant tells me my Legions of Terror are losing a battle, <br/>
I will believe him. After all, he&#39;s my trusted lieutenant.<br/>
<br/>
If an enemy I have just killed has a younger sibling or offspring anywhere, <br/>
I will find them and have them killed immediately, instead of waiting for <br/>
them to grow up harboring feelings of vengeance towards me in my old age.<br/>
<br/>
If I absolutely must ride into battle, I will certainly not ride at the <br/>
forefront of my Legions of Terror, nor will I seek out my opposite number <br/>
among his army.<br/>
<br/>
I will be neither chivalrous nor sporting. If I have an unstoppable <br/>
superweapon, I will use it as early and as often as possible instead of <br/>
keeping it in reserve.<br/>
<br/>
Once my power is secure, I will destroy all those pesky time-travel devices.<br/>
<br/>
When I capture the hero, I will make sure I also get his dog, monkey, <br/>
ferret, or whatever sickeningly cute little animal capable of untying ropes <br/>
and filching keys happens to follow him around.<br/>
<br/>
I will maintain a healthy amount of skepticism when I capture the beautiful <br/>
rebel and she claims she is attracted to my power and good looks and will <br/>
gladly betray her companions if I just let her in on my plans.<br/>
<br/>
I will only employ bounty hunters who work for money. Those who work for the <br/>
pleasure of the hunt tend to do dumb things like even the odds to give the <br/>
other guy a sporting chance.<br/>
<br/>
I will make sure I have a clear understanding of who is responsible for what <br/>
in my organization. For example, if my general screws up I will not draw my <br/>
weapon, point it at him, say &quot;And here is the price for failure,&quot; then <br/>
suddenly turn and kill some random underling.<br/>
<br/>
If an advisor says to me &quot;My liege, he is but one man. What can one man <br/>
possibly do?&quot;, I will reply &quot;This.&quot; and kill the advisor.<br/>
<br/>
If I learn that a callow youth has begun a quest to destroy me, I will slay <br/>
him while he is still a callow youth instead of waiting for him to mature.<br/>
<br/>
I will treat any beast which I control through magic or technology with <br/>
respect and kindness. Thus if the control is ever broken, it will not <br/>
immediately come after me for revenge.<br/>
<br/>
If I learn the whereabouts of the one artifact which can destroy me, I will <br/>
not send all my troops out to seize it. Instead I will send them out to <br/>
seize something else and quietly put a Want-Ad in the local paper.<br/>
<br/>
My main computers will have their own special operating system that will be <br/>
completely incompatible with standard IBM and Macintosh powerbooks.<br/>
<br/>
If one of my dungeon guards begins expressing concern over the conditions in <br/>
the beautiful princess&#39; cell, I will immediately transfer him to a less <br/>
people-oriented position.<br/>
<br/>
I will hire a team of board-certified architects and surveyors to examine my <br/>
castle and inform me of any secret passages and abandoned tunnels that I <br/>
might not know about.<br/>
<br/>
If the beautiful princess that I capture says &quot;I&#39;ll never marry you! Never, <br/>
do you hear me, NEVER!!!&quot;, I will say &quot;Oh well&quot; and kill her.<br/>
<br/>
I will not strike a bargain with a demonic being then attempt to <br/>
double-cross it simply because I feel like being contrary.<br/>
<br/>
The deformed mutants and odd-ball psychotics will have their place in my <br/>
Legions of Terror. However before I send them out on important covert <br/>
missions that require tact and subtlety, I will first see if there is anyone <br/>
else equally qualified who would attract less attention.<br/>
<br/>
My Legions of Terror will be trained in basic marksmanship. Any who cannot <br/>
learn to hit a man-sized target at 10 meters will be used for target <br/>
practice.<br/>
<br/>
Before employing any captured artifacts or machinery, I will carefully read <br/>
the owner&#39;s manual.<br/>
<br/>
If it becomes necessary to escape, I will never stop to pose dramatically <br/>
and toss off a one-liner.<br/>
<br/>
I will never build a sentient computer smarter than I am.<br/>
<br/>
My five-year-old child advisor will also be asked to decipher any code I am <br/>
thinking of using. If he breaks the code in under 30 seconds, it will not be <br/>
used. Note: this also applies to passwords.<br/>
<br/>
If my advisors ask &quot;Why are you risking everything on such a mad scheme?&quot;, I <br/>
will not proceed until I have a response that satisfies them.<br/>
<br/>
I will design fortress hallways with no alcoves or protruding structural <br/>
supports which intruders could use for cover in a firefight.<br/>
<br/>
Bulk trash will be disposed of in incinerators, not compactors. And they <br/>
will be kept hot, with none of that nonsense about flames going through <br/>
accessible tunnels at predictable intervals.<br/>
<br/>
I will see a competent psychiatrist and get cured of all extremely unusual <br/>
phobias and bizarre compulsive habits which could prove to be a <br/>
disadvantage.<br/>
<br/>
If I must have computer systems with publicly available terminals, the maps <br/>
they display of my complex will have a room clearly marked as the Main <br/>
Control Room. That room will be the Execution Chamber. The actual main <br/>
control room will be marked as Sewage Overflow Containment.<br/>
<br/>
My security keypad will actually be a fingerprint scanner. Anyone who <br/>
watches someone press a sequence of buttons or dusts the pad for <br/>
fingerprints then subsequently tries to enter by repeating that sequence <br/>
will trigger the alarm system.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how many shorts we have in the system, my guards will be <br/>
instructed to treat every surveillance camera malfunction as a full-scale <br/>
emergency.<br/>
<br/>
I will spare someone who saved my life sometime in the past. This is only <br/>
reasonable as it encourages others to do so. However, the offer is good one <br/>
time only. If they want me to spare them again, they&#39;d better save my life <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
All midwives will be banned from the realm. All babies will be delivered at <br/>
state-approved hospitals. Orphans will be placed in foster-homes, not <br/>
abandoned in the woods to be raised by creatures of the wild.<br/>
<br/>
When my guards split up to search for intruders, they will always travel in <br/>
groups of at least two. They will be trained so that if one of them <br/>
disappears mysteriously while on patrol, the other will immediately initiate <br/>
an alert and call for backup, instead of quizzically peering around a <br/>
corner.<br/>
<br/>
If I decide to test a lieutenant&#39;s loyalty and see if he/she should be made <br/>
a trusted lieutenant, I will have a crack squad of marksmen standing by in <br/>
case the answer is no.<br/>
<br/>
If all the heroes are standing together around a strange device and begin to <br/>
taunt me, I will pull out a conventional weapon instead of using my <br/>
unstoppable superweapon on them.<br/>
<br/>
I will not agree to let the heroes go free if they win a rigged contest, <br/>
even though my advisors assure me it is impossible for them to win.<br/>
<br/>
When I create a multimedia presentation of my plan designed so that my <br/>
five-year-old advisor can easily understand the details, I will not label <br/>
the disk &quot;Project Overlord&quot; and leave it lying on top of my desk.<br/>
<br/>
I will instruct my Legions of Terror to attack the hero en masse, instead of <br/>
standing around waiting while members break off and attack one or two at a <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
If the hero runs up to my roof, I will not run up after him and struggle <br/>
with him in an attempt to push him over the edge. I will also not engage him <br/>
at the edge of a cliff. (In the middle of a rope-bridge over a river of <br/>
molten lava is not even worth considering.)<br/>
<br/>
If I have a fit of temporary insanity and decide to give the hero the chance <br/>
to reject a job as my trusted lieutentant, I will retain enough sanity to <br/>
wait until my current trusted lieutenant is out of earshot before making the <br/>
offer.<br/>
<br/>
I will not tell my Legions of Terror &quot;And he must be taken alive!&quot; The <br/>
command will be &quot;And try to take him alive if it is reasonably practical.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If my doomsday device happens to come with a reverse switch, as soon as it <br/>
has been employed it will be melted down and made into limited-edition <br/>
commemorative coins.<br/>
<br/>
If my weakest troops fail to eliminate a hero, I will send out my best <br/>
troops instead of wasting time with progressively stronger ones as he gets <br/>
closer and closer to my fortress.<br/>
<br/>
If I am fighting with the hero atop a moving platform, have disarmed him, <br/>
and am about to finish him off and he glances behind me and drops flat, I <br/>
too will drop flat instead of quizzically turning around to find out what he <br/>
saw.<br/>
<br/>
I will not shoot at any of my enemies if they are standing in front of the <br/>
crucial support beam to a heavy, dangerous, unbalanced structure.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m eating dinner with the hero, put poison in his goblet, then have to <br/>
leave the table for any reason, I will order new drinks for both of us <br/>
instead of trying to decide whether or not to switch with him.<br/>
<br/>
I will not have captives of one sex guarded by members of the opposite sex.<br/>
<br/>
I will not use any plan in which the final step is horribly complicated, <br/>
e.g. &quot;Align the 12 Stones of Power on the sacred altar then activate the <br/>
medallion at the moment of total eclipse.&quot; Instead it will be more along the <br/>
lines of &quot;Push the button.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I will make sure that my doomsday device is up to code and properly <br/>
grounded.<br/>
<br/>
My vats of hazardous chemicals will be covered when not in use. Also, I will <br/>
not construct walkways above them.<br/>
<br/>
If a group of henchmen fail miserably at a task, I will not berate them for <br/>
incompetence then send the same group out to try the task again.<br/>
<br/>
After I captures the hero&#39;s superweapon, I will not immediately disband my <br/>
legions and relax my guard because I believe whoever holds the weapon is <br/>
unstoppable. After all, the hero held the weapon and I took it from him.<br/>
<br/>
I will not design my Main Control Room so that every workstation is facing <br/>
away from the door.<br/>
<br/>
I will not ignore the messenger that stumbles in exhausted and obviously <br/>
agitated until my personal grooming or current entertainment is finished. It <br/>
might actually be important.<br/>
<br/>
If I ever talk to the hero on the phone, I will not taunt him. Instead I <br/>
will say this his dogged perseverance has given me new insight on the <br/>
futility of my evil ways and that if he leaves me alone for a few months of <br/>
quiet contemplation I will likely return to the path of righteousness. <br/>
(Heroes are incredibly gullible in this regard.)<br/>
<br/>
If I decide to hold a double execution of the hero and an underling who <br/>
failed or betrayed me, I will see to it that the hero is scheduled to go <br/>
first.<br/>
<br/>
When arresting prisoners, my guards will not allow them to stop and grab a <br/>
useless trinket of purely sentimental value.<br/>
<br/>
My dungeon will have its own qualified medical staff complete with <br/>
bodyguards. That way if a prisoner becomes sick and his cellmate tells the <br/>
guard it&#39;s an emergency, the guard will fetch a trauma team instead of <br/>
opening up the cell for a look.<br/>
<br/>
My door mechanisms will be designed so that blasting the control panel on <br/>
the outside seals the door and blasting the control panel on the inside <br/>
opens the door, not vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
My dungeon cells will not be furnished with objects that contain reflective <br/>
surfaces or anything that can be unravelled.<br/>
<br/>
If an attractive young couple enters my realm, I will carefully monitor <br/>
their activities. If I find they are happy and affectionate, I will ignore <br/>
them. However if circumstance have forced them together against their will <br/>
and they spend all their time bickering and criticizing each other except <br/>
during the intermittent occasions when they are saving each others&#39; lives at <br/>
which point there are hints of sexual tension, I will immediately order <br/>
their execution.<br/>
<br/>
Any data file of crucial importance will be padded to 1.45Mb in size.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, to keep my subjects permanently locked in a mindless trance, I will <br/>
provide each of them with free unlimited Internet access.<br/>
<br/>
