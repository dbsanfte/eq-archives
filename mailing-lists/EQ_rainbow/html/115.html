<br/>
I disabled attachments from this list, since attachments can inadvertantly<br/>
send viruses to other people.  Hopefully you can take what you write in<br/>
word or whatever, and cut and paste it into yoru email program to send the<br/>
information.<br/>

&gt; Well, I&#39;ve gone through about 80 postings and here&#39;s what I have put together from<br/>
&gt; what people have posted. Please feel free to send me additional info and I will<br/>
&gt; update and send out periodically.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is all gathered from postings you folks have put up, but for any reason, should<br/>
&gt; you want to be removed from this listing, just let me know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have probably missed some info, but this would seem to be a good start. Please<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t be offended if I left you out. Just send me the info. and I&#39;ll put it in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hugs,<br/>
&gt; David<br/>
