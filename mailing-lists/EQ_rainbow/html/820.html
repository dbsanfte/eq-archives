<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466270619">Hiyas! Im excited to be a new member of this emailing community!! :)<br/>
 Hmm, for those who are interested in newcomers, I might as well introduce <br/>
myself a bit.  hehe :D <br/>
  Lets see.. I have played EQ for a bout a year now, beginning on Nameless <br/>
then switching to Rodcet around April of this year :)    At the moment my two <br/>
main characters on Rodcet are Ivymayden D&#39;Zephyr ~ 34 Woodelf Warrior and <br/>
Melalle ~ 15 Dark Elf Romancer.  (but im a good witch!) among a few other <br/>
chars I got bored with hehe.  I recently discovered Mystic Alliance and was <br/>
overjoyed! I had no idea there was such a guild on EQ!!  These past few weeks <br/>
have been some of the best since I joined :D   Ok, ill draw the line on the <br/>
intro here!  Im looking forward to meeting the Rainbow crew!   <br/>
<br/>
