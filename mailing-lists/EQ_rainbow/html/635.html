<div id="ygrps-yiv-498364545">glad to hear from you :) i dont know about the servers that any<br/>
particular bears might play on, i know i am a cub that plays on bristle<br/>
bane, but that is beside the point, this list is a bit slow, but we have<br/>
got quite a few good bits of information from it i am really glad i<br/>
joined it myself. i have a tendency to be more of a lurker myself unless<br/>
it is to greet someone, i always try to greet the new comers :) anyways,<br/>
some one else should be able to answer your question, good luck in your<br/>
adventures and have fun :)<br/>

&gt; Greetings, EQers:<br/>
&gt; My name is Jack, and I&#39;m a new EQ player. I have to confess that my<br/>
&gt; partner Chris is actually the one that got addicted, and I thought it<br/>
&gt; would be &quot;the end&quot; if I didn&#39;t start playing, too! :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A while back there were a few Bears out there who played EQ on a<br/>
&gt; particular server, and I know that Chris has run across some of the<br/>
&gt; G/L/B/T PCs who buffed him, but disappeared before he could ask for<br/>
&gt; more guild info. Anyone out there know anything?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I live in St. Louis, am a 34 year old Bear employed as a statistician<br/>
&gt; and research designer for a managed health company. Chris is an LA<br/>
&gt; native, and is a dba manager for a firm in Chicago. We&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; together now for just over a year, hopefully to be together a<br/>
&gt; lifetime or two.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Glad I found the list. I&#39;d love to hear from you folks!<br/>
