<b>Subject:</b> Hello <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-488672276">I heard about this mailing list from my friend, so I ran over and<br/>
subscribed.  I&#39;m an EQ player, and the idea of being able to talk with other<br/>
like minded people is very exciting.  I really enjoy gabbing about the game<br/>
;)  I&#39;ve been in EQ since phase 2 of beta.  I used to play on a MUD with the<br/>
producer of the game as a matter of fact (he was in my guild haha), and he<br/>
got me into it.  I&#39;ve migrated about the servers since I started, moved by<br/>
packetloss problems and to follow friends.  I&#39;m fairly firmly rooted in<br/>
Tunare now, but I started on Brell Serilis tonight once I heard others were<br/>
going to be there also.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m playing a dwarf cleric named Loar, so if you see me on, feel free to say<br/>
hi!</div>
