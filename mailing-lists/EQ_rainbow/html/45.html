<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417595732"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Perhaps we should consider David&#39;s idea of setting up this &quot;GLBT&quot; guild on <br/>
&gt;the new roleplaying server, Brell Serilis. We could all start from scratch <br/>
&gt;and learn about each other in a group of the same level. Sirenia is a Level <br/>
&gt;24 High Elven Cleric, but I would be willing to give it all up to start <br/>
&gt;again with all of you if you are interested. Then I am certain we would <br/>
&gt;have enough members to form a guild there. What does everyone think of <br/>
&gt;this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d be very willing to help make a GLBT guild on Brell Serilis.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d even play a goody-goody to help play well with the rest of you.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
(Given my penchant for Dark Elves, this is weird for me...;-)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a hunky Barbarian...hmmm...<br/>
