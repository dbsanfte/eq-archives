Thanks for the update on E&#39;ci, etc. I agree completely with your approach to<br/>
the situation.<br/>
<br/>
As to the setup on other servers, given the problem with GM availability, I<br/>
will use the suggestion given here about petitioning the GM on the server (in<br/>
my case, Erollisi) and then giving you a quick heads-up when they are<br/>
available. You&#39;ve put in a lot of time so far and that is greatly appreciated.<br/>
No reason for you to be sitting on Erollisi if you don&#39;t need to.<br/>
<br/>
It was great to meet all of you who were on Brell at the meeting. Nearly all<br/>
my time has been on Erollisi because I have 3 chars there (my highest is level<br/>
11, almost 12!) and my partner has just gotten into EQ and we are getting her<br/>
going so we can hunt together. Although I&#39;m nowhere near master jeweler level,<br/>
my enchanter is willing to make deep discounts on any of the silver jewelery I<br/>
can currently make if you are on Erollisi.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to all and happy hunting,<br/>
<br/>

From: David Lari &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kerik@...">kerik@...</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been brought to my<br/>
attention that the guild has been set up by someone on&lt;br&gt;the E&#39;ci server<br/>
without my knowledge. Last night, I petitioned to ask 1) how could&lt;br&gt;that<br/>
happen? and 2) to please delete and recreate the guild with me as the<br/>
guild&lt;br&gt;master.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After some further research by Sandy, he has found out<br/>
that it is indeed a GLBT&lt;br&gt;guild.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My problem is that the person who<br/>
got this set up did not inform me or this list&lt;br&gt;and we don&#39;t know exactly<br/>
who the guild master is. While I do not have designs on&lt;br&gt;being a powerful<br/>
multi-server guild master, I feel that it is inappropriate to try&lt;br&gt;to get<br/>
the guild set up without authorization. Especially when we had someone<br/>
from&lt;br&gt;this list who volunteered to be the guild master. I also don&#39;t<br/>
understand how&lt;br&gt;Verant did this either, but that is an issue I will take up<br/>
with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The upshot is, unless I hear from the guild master very<br/>
soon, I am going to&lt;br&gt;proceed with having this guild deleted and recreated.<br/>
The leadership will then be&lt;br&gt;transferred to the person who volunteered on<br/>
this list (I have to check my notes&lt;br&gt;to see who it was).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My feeling<br/>
is the guild belongs to the people on this list and that this list&lt;br&gt;should<br/>
be used to communicate general information about the guild. There is<br/>
no&lt;br&gt;room for someone who &#39;hijacks&#39; the guild and doesn&#39;t share the<br/>
information with&lt;br&gt;the people on this list.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope that what I have<br/>
said above is reasonable. If anyone feels that it is not,&lt;br&gt;please politely<br/>
let me know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a related note, I roved around between about 7<br/>
different servers searching for&lt;br&gt;a GM to set up the guild and found none. I<br/>
will continue this and let you know as&lt;br&gt;soon as the guild is set up on any<br/>
of the other servers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;David&lt;br&gt;<br/>
