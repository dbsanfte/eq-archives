 Hello all,<br/>
 <br/>
 For those of you who have volunteered to be the guild leader for Mystical<br/>
 Alliance on the other servers (other than Brell Serilis) I need some <br/>
information<br/>
 from you. On many of the servers, I do not have a character yet, so the <br/>
easiest<br/>
 thing is for me to create a new character in a starting city this is <br/>
convenient<br/>
 to where you are located. So, send me the following information:<br/>
 <br/>
 Name of guild leader character:<br/>
 Nearest starting city:<br/>
 <br/>
 In order for me to make you guild leader, I have to be in the same zone as <br/>
you.<br/>
 I don&#39;t think we even have to be logged on at the same time, but I am not <br/>
sure.<br/>
 Verant has changed the way guilds are set up by the GM&#39;s. I am under the<br/>
 understanding that I can petition a GM any time during regular customer <br/>
service<br/>
 hours. So, as I receive the above info from you, I will begin getting this <br/>
done.<br/>
 After you give me the information, you may wish to &#39;park&#39; your character in <br/>
this<br/>
 city so I can go ahead and assign you as the leader.<br/>
 <br/>
 I hope to begin working on our web site soon. I will keep you posted.<br/>
 <br/>
 RAINBOW FESTIVAL<br/>
 Also, Christina (who has been leveling her Luna character quite nicely I <br/>
might<br/>
 add) suggested that we have some sort of guild meeting in Norrath on one of <br/>
the<br/>
 servers. A chance to get together and chat. I am working on finding a time <br/>
for<br/>
 this and will let you know. It will probably be this Saturday, the 28th. We <br/>
will<br/>
 meet on Brell Serilis and probably in the Freeport area as it is centrally<br/>
 located. If you don&#39;t have a character on Brell, you can just create a newbie<br/>
 character so you can meet with everyone. If you have a character, but need <br/>
help<br/>
 traveling, let me know and we can arrange escorts beforehand.<br/>
 <br/>
 After the get together, those who want to can do some hunting together. We <br/>
can<br/>
 break up into hunting groups based on levels. I will provide binds and corpse<br/>
 locating for anyone who needs it. Also, I may have some mino axes for some<br/>
 hunters to borrow (but I will need them back after the hunt. Gotta get money <br/>
to<br/>
 buy my spells :) It might be fun to see a bunch of level 1 melee types with <br/>
mino<br/>
 axes, hehe.<br/>
 <br/>
 Anyone else have any ideas for other fun things we can do during our <br/>
festival,<br/>
 please post to the list.<br/>
