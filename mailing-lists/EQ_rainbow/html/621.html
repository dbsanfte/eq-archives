<b>Subject:</b> All the way to Cabilis with a lvl 9! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557129510">I made a character on Druzzil Ro a bit ago cuz I was tired of the PVP on Zek, so was my boyfriend. Anyway I got the new char to lvl 9 but didnt like him that much, and found the stats and all for the Iksar Shamans and I really liked them. So anyway I got a bunch of armor for my Iksar shaman ready for when Kunark went up. Well I made it all the way from the Docks in Oasis to Cabilis (even inside the city though I was very KOS). Its really not that hard just a long run, but also dangerous if you dont know how to stay away from monsters. Anyway just thought Id share that hehe. And having fun with my new Iksar shaman! Hope to see you.<br/>
