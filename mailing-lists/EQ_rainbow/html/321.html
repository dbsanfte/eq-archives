<div id="ygrps-yiv-8160682">Other side of water ? .. I haven&#39;t ventured far enough into Najena to get to<br/>
her. So is there water in the cave  part? or is there another location<br/>
elsewhere ? I know that we are headed to get the FBR by the weekend.. so if<br/>
there is 2 spots any information would be nice<br/>
<br/>
Also, Wht other rare items are in the dungeon ? I know of the boots, RBR,<br/>
backpack ?<br/>

I have heard of people camping for the jboot for 6hours a day for over a<br/>
week<br/>
b4 they got one. The FBR is easy compaired to the boots. Najena almost<br/>
always<br/>
spawns with it. However she doent alwasy spawn. Sometimes a Elmental spawns<br/>
in her place, and no there is no such thing as Anticamping code. When me and<br/>
My group whent for the robes we tested it out. She spawned just as many<br/>
times<br/>
when we were on the other side of the water as she did when we were camping<br/>
at her doorstep. That anicamping is a legioned not based on facts. Caused<br/>
because some Npc&#39;s dont always spawn in fact they spawn randomly. so people<br/>
started camping on the other side and poof she disided to show up that<br/>
time... and thus the legioned was born.<br/>
