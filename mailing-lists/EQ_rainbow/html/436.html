<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129430903">Though I hate to let mean poeple win, I also STILL hate the name Mystical<br/>
Alliance!  Force of Synergy anyone ahhahahahah! :)   BUT SERIOUSLY, we<br/>
should let David handle this, and he can work it out with Verant, they need<br/>
to get their act together, and start helping us out a bit.  Unfortunatly I<br/>
think many of the poeple wqe deal with are young poeple who may not have the<br/>
emotional security or maturity to deal with gay poeple, or the fact that<br/>
there was a guild mistake, so we are going to end up having to defend<br/>
ourselves from all fronts...such is life...BTW:  check out Teen People, Rob<br/>
and I are in it, page 156, not that i memorized it or anything :)<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, thanks everyoinbe for your kind words and support reguardsing<br/>
the harassment, I have alkreayd e-mail Veranty, though i got an automated<br/>
reply from tech-support, even though i didint send it to tech, whatver i am<br/>
sure they will figure it out, i am giving them till next tuesday to reply<br/>
personally then i will call them, I&#39;m not lwetting this drop because it was<br/>
VERY VERY bad, and extremely upsetting, but there is no way in hell i am<br/>
giving up Rodcet nife, my chatchter or this cool game for some idiot.   If i<br/>
need anytihng form you guys, i&#39;ll let you know!  thanks agaiun!!!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Here&#39;s what&#39;s happened since Tuesday morning...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Signed on at 5am CST..saw someone on E&#39;ci with the &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot;<br/>
&gt; name by theirs. They were nonresponsive..probably AFK. They ran off and I<br/>
&gt; continued to try and say Hi to them and they ignored me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Talked to a Tigerhawk Wensday morning. VERY nice person. I asked him<br/>
&gt; about the guild and he told me he knew it was a<br/>
&gt; Gay/Bi/Lesbian/Transgendered etc. guild and loved the idea.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3) Wensday afternoon I spoke with the Guild leader (Tarismo), and it<br/>
wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; David, and he was very upset that &#39;we&#39; were trying to take HIS guild away<br/>
&gt; from him. He told me it was DEFINATELY NOT based on what we had intended<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; a guild, even though Tigerhawk said differently. He said that HE was first<br/>
&gt; and he would NOT allow ANYONE to take the guild away from him. I told him<br/>
&gt; that there must be a mix up and he should contact Verant to clear it up.<br/>
He<br/>
&gt; exploded on me about that. I told him he should talk to a GM and not yell<br/>
&gt; at me because I had no power. After this he refused to reply to any tells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4) I petitioned a junior GM and told them about the guild mixup etc. and<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; promised to esculate it to the powers that be. I thanked him and went<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; my gaming.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5) At 11:45 pm I was getting ready to log after a lot of fun at Lake<br/>
Rather<br/>
&gt; when I got a tell from one of their members accusing me of starting<br/>
rumors.<br/>
&gt; He was VERY mean and would not listen to reason. I explained what had<br/>
&gt; happened and why the confusion but he then became more abusive. After a<br/>
&gt; minute or so, several other of their guild started sending really<br/>
mean..and<br/>
&gt; I DO mean EVIL tells to me about this. I told them to let Verant/GMs take<br/>
&gt; it from here but they verbally assaulted over and over. I eventually<br/>
calmed<br/>
&gt; them down and logged for the night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Man...this is crazy. I don&#39;t KNOW what&#39;s happened but I think David<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; right that we may have to delete the guild and start over again. Though<br/>
&gt; with people like I met last night, I think it will be rather rough trying<br/>
&gt; to parley with them about this mix up.<br/>
