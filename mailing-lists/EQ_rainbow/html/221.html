Subject: [EQ_rainbow] Guild name and charter<br/>

&gt; Hello eveyrone<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was at the guild chat tonight trying to help iron-out the name and<br/>
purpose<br/>
&gt; of our group.  Our offical name right now is The Unity.  But it has come<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; our attention that there is another guild named Unity.  It was suggested<br/>
&gt; that we change our name as to be distinct form this group.  Many<br/>
suggestion<br/>
&gt; were thrown about, and I personally tended to by hyper-critical of them<br/>
&gt; because I wanted a guild name and charter that would fit role-players as<br/>
&gt; well as non-role players, good, neutral, and evil charachters.  It was<br/>
also<br/>
&gt; important to me to be identofied as a group for GLBT people and their<br/>
&gt; friends, while still keeping true to the fantasy style of EQ, and the<br/>
&gt; Norrathian culture.  This feat was assisted by many poeple in the chat.<br/>
So<br/>
&gt; many suggestions were made, but I sincerely feel that my following<br/>
proposal<br/>
&gt; fits best with what we all intend.  I hope that we can all join together<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; all serves with this guild name and charter and have some fun.  David, do<br/>
&gt; you know how, or if we can cange our nbame now?  I hope so!   Of course i<br/>
&gt; want people to make changes and or suggestions to this, and i will leave<br/>
&gt; that compliing of that info to David :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Guild name:  Force of Synergy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Charter:    Forged by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered people of<br/>
&gt; Norrath, and their friends, who saw a fractured society, to form alliances<br/>
&gt; of respect, knowledge, and truth, though not necessarily of love, between<br/>
&gt; the many peoples of Norrath...this is the Force of Synergy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now what?<br/>
