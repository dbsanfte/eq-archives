<div id="ygrps-yiv-431837933">Howdy, all.  We successfully created our new guild on The Nameless <br/>
server on Sunday. =)<br/>
<br/>
Now that there are three gay EQ guilds (that I&#39;m aware of, anyway), I <br/>
was wondering if folks would be interested in creating an EQ Gay Guilds <br/>
Webring to link our websites together and make it easier for surfers to <br/>
find us all?<br/>
<br/>
The url for Nameless Love is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sweetvision.com/~namelesslove">http://www.sweetvision.com/~namelesslove</a><br/>
What are the urls for our other guilds?</div>
