&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway .. random points on previous suggestions:<br/>
&gt; - &quot;Order of the Chosen&quot; is even on Brell, my Mage was involved but not key<br/>
&gt; - I&#39;d also like to believe the Norrath culture is gay positive, where<br/>
while<br/>
&gt; a minority, subject to discrimination, after all *I* did grow up thinking<br/>
&gt; it was all perfectly normal :)<br/>
&gt; - If we don&#39;t vote or have some particapatory (sp?) method of choosing,<br/>
&gt; some may feel slighted.  Though of course the eventual one chosen can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; possibly be everyones favorite.<br/>
&gt; - I agree you should avoid handing the immature element an excuse to<br/>
&gt; harrass on a platter.  &lt; Aside: I was subject to two on-line &quot;rapes&quot; in a<br/>
&gt; previous MUD - interesting stories, and yes just some dumb kid and emotes,<br/>
&gt; but it *does* ruin your evening no matter how much you realize its just<br/>
&gt; some dumb kid. Two in six years of on-line RPing is a low rate .. but &gt;<br/>
&gt; - I don&#39;t know about some GBLT/other mytical connection angle.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; feel any &quot;mystical connection&quot; to the GBLTs in my life, to me they&#39;re just<br/>
&gt; family. :P  But perhaps if its explained in the RP as suggested?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And my own general suggestions:<br/>
&gt; - After being subjected to the sense of humor in this group in the guild<br/>
&gt; chat, perhaps a name with some humor?  The group seemed very good at that!<br/>
&gt; &lt;my stomach still hurts!&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Perhaps we should add to the charter that you are expected to have fun?<br/>
&gt; - As far as a diety Rp angle.  The women seem to have something going with<br/>
&gt; Erollisi already &lt;ducks from Christina&gt;, if you read about the dieties<br/>
&gt; Quellious seems to be the one most in-line with respect of differences.<br/>
So<br/>
&gt; for an RP angle, something Quellious oriented maybe?<br/>
&gt; - If we assume Norrath accepts all sexual orientations as normal facets of<br/>
&gt; life, then *if* you grew up in this world (Norrath), what would a group of<br/>
&gt; GBLTs (and friends!) call themselves?  What can we think of here?  The<br/>
&gt; message I seem to hear is &quot;We all belong here and together&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I was the one with the thesaurus :)  So, going on the humor/joy/gay<br/>
&gt; angle which I was asked to last night and trying to choose the simple<br/>
&gt; English words with a medieval sound to them ...  Also looked up &quot;group&quot;<br/>
&gt; type words .. no luck on synergy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Group Words: Society, Fellowship, Circle, Ring, Alliance, Voices, Spirits,<br/>
&gt; Conclave, Band<br/>
&gt; Medieval &quot;Gay&quot; Words: Mirth, Cheer, Felicity, Gambol, Merry<br/>
&gt; Other descriptive words suggested: Mystic, Harmony, United (if not unity)<br/>
&gt; Force/Soldiers: Force, Champion, Swashbuckler, Guards, Troop, Volunteers,<br/>
&gt; Legion, Brigade, Corps, Company, Rabble, Horde, Tribe<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Playing mix and match (and trying no to sound too &quot;nice&quot; for the RPers):<br/>
&gt; The Merry Horde<br/>
&gt; Legion of Mirth<br/>
&gt; (well at least descriptive of the rabble in the chat room)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Lora, creating more fodder<br/>
&gt;<br/>
