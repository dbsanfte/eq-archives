 </span></blockquote>here is a good blond joke for you all<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; A blonde and a brunette were watching the 11:00 news. The current<br/>
&gt; news story was about a man up on a ledge and threatening to jump.<br/>
&gt; The station cuts to a commercial.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Brunette: I bet you $20 he&#39;s going to jump.<br/>
&gt; Blonde: OK.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (back to newscast)<br/>
&gt; He jumps.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Blonde: OK Here&#39;s my $20.<br/>
&gt; Brunette: No, that was too easy. I can&#39;t take it.<br/>
&gt; Blonde: I insist. I lost.<br/>
&gt; Brunette: I have a confession to make. I saw the same thing on<br/>
&gt; the 6:00 news and knew he jumped. So it wasn&#39;t really a good bet.<br/>
&gt; Blonde: I know. I saw the same newscast. But I didn&#39;t think he<br/>
&gt; would be stupid enough to jump twice. </span></blockquote></div>
