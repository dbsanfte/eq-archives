<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294704603">Well, at this rate they haven&#39;t been of much help so I can relate to<br/>
the frustration. Its always bugged me that GM&#39;s aren&#39;t on when you need<br/>
them. Kinda like Cops not being around when you need one. Their explanation<br/>
was rather screwy to me also because I know you researched the guild issue.<br/>
And as we all know, GM&#39;s can take some time to respond to out petitions,<br/>
though I had thought once we logged off, our petitions went with us and we<br/>
had to repetition..but Ive havent any idea if thats how it works.<br/>
<br/>
     And I also agree that the crackdown on Gay harrasment has been slight.<br/>
I don&#39;t care if Im a Green Skinned Orion..I should have some protection<br/>
from rude people other than &#39;Why dont you put them on your ignore list.&quot;<br/>
sigh. Sorry..Im just frustrated....<br/>
