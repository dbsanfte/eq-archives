Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who have volunteered to be the guild leader for Mystical<br/>
Alliance on the other servers (other than Brell Serilis) I need some<br/>
information from you. On many of the servers, I do not have a character yet,<br/>
so the easiest thing is for me to create a new character in a starting city<br/>
this is convenient to where you are located. So, send me the following<br/>
information:<br/>
<br/>
Name of guild leader character:  Sharada<br/>
Nearest starting city:  Felwithe/GFay<br/>
<br/>
If we need to be online at the same time, David, let me know and we can set it<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Also, re: the Rainbow Festival, most anytime on Saturday the 28th will work<br/>
for me. My preference is probably a.m. to early afternoon, but will make a<br/>
point on being there in Freeport at the appointed place and time. Not sure<br/>
which character will be there yet, but most likely Ananda, Cleric of Brell.<br/>
Looking forward to getting together with you all! Haven&#39;t been on Brell for a<br/>
couple of weeks because I&#39;ve been playing my Erollisi chars. &lt;grin&gt; The newbie<br/>
and lower level areas are not nearly as crowded now...<br/>
<br/>
See you all on Saturday!<br/>
<br/>
Christine<br/>
