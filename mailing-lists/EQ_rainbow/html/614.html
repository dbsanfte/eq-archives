<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079722735">Hello there,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to take a moment and say hi to all my fellow gay/lesbian/bi/tg EQ players.  <br/>
<br/>
I play characters on two different servers:  a halfling druid on &quot;The Rathe&quot;, and two different enchanters (gnome and dark elf) on &quot;Vallon Zek&quot;.  Contact me and I will be glad to share my character names.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Atlanta, GA, and welcome making new friends who share my EQ addiction.  I also enjoy general purpose sci-fi/fantasy (Babylon 5, ST in various flavors, and lately &quot;Charmed&quot;).  Also enjoy role playing games away from the computer (various varieties, but mainly D&D).<br/>
