                                      -Ice Comet has been deemed too strong. The damage has been reduced by 93% and you now<br/>
                                      need runes that are only found on Cazic-Thule and Innoruuk. Who cares if the Hate plane isn&#39;t right<br/>
                                      yet? Screw you.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -All of the Magicians Summon spells now require Diamonds.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Druids can no longer cast Spirit of Wolf. This was deemed bad for the economy. Druids cannot<br/>
                                      make money off of anything! Therefore, we have replaced it with Spirit of Slug. It reduces one<br/>
                                      player&#39;s speed by 98%. It has been deemed unfair on the PvP+ server (no plural...we&#39;re just<br/>
                                      screwing with you about Race War), so it will have neither spell.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Clerics can no longer Heal. This was bad for Geoff&#39; Zatkin&#39;s ego. Instead, each Heal spell of the<br/>
                                      Cleric has been replaced with a Summon Gnoll Pup spell.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Paladins Lay on Hands wasn&#39;t good enough for the economy. It has been replaced with Sit on<br/>
                                      Hands.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Rangers don&#39;t get spells anymore. It was bad for our brain cells.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Warriors now have Complete Healing for no mana at level 1, because we&#39;re tired of listening to<br/>
                                      whiny people. it&#39;s bad for our patience.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -All Bard spells require mana now. Why? Because we like screwing with you!<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Enchanters can now enchant items...but only Rusty Daggers, Iron Rations, and Ice Goblin<br/>
                                      Necklaces.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Necromancers have a new summon spell to replace each one from level 4 up, &quot;Summon McQuaid<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Shamans can now cast Enlarge. This will be popular with people on this development team.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -All Trolls can now cast Burst of Flame when they are facing away from their foe.<br/>
<br/>
                                      Skills<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Rangers tracking was bad for the economy. Therefore, they now have a new command: &quot;Find<br/>
                                      Your Ass With Two Hands&quot;, because this is what we wish we could do.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Rogues Make Poison was deemed bad for the economy already. We have replaced it with<br/>
                                      Diagonal Lower Right Stab.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Warriors now have Healing Kick. It heals them when they kick. Why? Because a lot of people<br/>
                                      bugged us about things. We didn&#39;t even really read them. But remember, we&#39;re keeping it<br/>
                                      balanced!<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Shadow Knights now have no skills. This was to improve the class. Also, Shadow Knights can<br/>
                                      only equip Rusty weapons. Why? Because at level 10+ the Rusty weapon economy is bad.<br/>
<br/>
                                      Trades<br/>
<br/>
                                      -The Jewelers Kit now costs 29000pp. People were becoming filthy rich bastards off of Jewelcraft.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Blacksmithing has been removed from the game, because it was profitable.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Pottery now makes potties only. You see, Tom Buck thought that was hilarious [sic].<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Brewery can only make non-alcoholic beverages, to dispel rumors that we are drunk when we<br/>
                                      come up with this stuff.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -The new skill, &quot;Meth Lab&quot;, has been implement because we can relate to it.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Tailoring was REALLY upsetting the economy. You can now tailor ONLY with the Skimpiest of<br/>
                                      Vox and the Undies of Ungar, two items we haven&#39;t put in yet and probably never will. Mwa ha ha.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Baking has been totally revamped. For instance, Sugar now costs 78pp, plus a 99pp down<br/>
                                      payment at 76% interest over four months. The economy needed it, people.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -Every other trade skill has been removed, because we want to go home.<br/>
<br/>
                                      MOBs<br/>
                                      -All MOBs that are level 1 and up are now aggro. This help the economy.<br/>
<br/>
                                      -The Ghoulbane is now on a level 2 Dark Elf Shadow Knight in the Temple of Cazic-Thule. We don&#39;t<br/>
                                      really give a flying defecation if it makes sense, it&#39;s OUR game, so, screw off!<br/>
<br/>
                                      -I don&#39;t want to spoil anything, of course, but you can find the Sword of Slashing Stuff, a 36/4<br/>
                                      Magical Item that randomly casts Brad Breath, a 56000 point damage spell, on Emporer Tush in<br/>
                                      Grobb (Hey, we don&#39;t care if we spell it right or not. As our company motto says, &quot;Screw you!&quot;).<br/>
                                      Whoops. My mistake. I seem to forget there is a Backspace key. Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
                                      Thanks for playing! All the servers will be coming down for two months by the time you read this.<br/>
                                      Made ya patch!<br/>

                                      Gratefully taken from the Cackling Klacknak which managed to cheer me up after the most<br/>
                                      ridiculous, drawn out, and generally unecessary death that made me log tonight.</div>
