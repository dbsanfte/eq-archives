<b>Subject:</b> Hello Everyone <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905909571">In RL my name is David. On EQ I am on the Veeshan server and mostly play a<br/>
lvl 12 Cleric named Layf. Also occasionally play a lvl 6 Paladin name<br/>
Rhoki, and have started a High Elf magician named Eloy. I am also thinking<br/>
about creating a wood elf (because I think those guys are just sooo cute.<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
My Cleric and Paladin are human and hang out around the Freeport area. I<br/>
would like to start a GLBT guild on Veeshan if I can get enough people.<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in hearing from any GLBT people on Veeshan so send me a<br/>
message or give me tell.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to learn more about me in RL, visit my home page:<br/>

Also, is anyone on the list going to create characters on the new role<br/>
playing server that just came online last night?<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
David</div>
