<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044324280">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Scott, and I have been playing EQ for about a month or so <br/>
now and like most of the rest of you I&#39;m hopeless hooked <br/>
on &quot;EverCrack&quot; :-D<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m a married bisexual male, 31, and living (sigh) in the <br/>
buckle of the bible belt...I play on the Saryrn server and currently <br/>
have two characters:<br/>
<br/>
Ktahn: 11th level Dark Elf Shadowknight - Agent of Evil (male)<br/>
Alanika: 6th level Dark Elf Magician - Renegage (ie. Good) (female)<br/>
<br/>
I also have a high-elf cleric who&#39;s name escapes me at the moment <br/>
(I&#39;m told memory loss is the second sign of growing old, I forgot <br/>
what the first was.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, feel free to drop me a line.  I&#39;m looking forward to getting <br/>
to know everyone here.<br/>
<br/>
Scott</div>
