<div id="ygrps-yiv-676897590">Well, I don&#39;t know, but I think I would feel like a user after that. The person obviously didn&#39;t know who you were. I am the kind of person that hates to take anything from anyone though. Plus, do you wonder about what your friend might think about this? If someone borrowed my character and acted like me when people saw him walking about, I would be rather peeved, especially if they took my friend for quite a bit of stuff. If you are happy and your friend is happy, then more power to you! It still is just a game, even if we put more time into it than we do our jobs -lol. <br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting all! <br/>

You won&#39;t believe what happened last night! A friend of mine got burned out<br/>
playing his 35th level Dwarf Paladin and gave him to me to play. As I was<br/>
traveling around I ran into someone he had gamed with. The man was very<br/>
happy to see &#39;me&#39; on line again and promptly told me of everything that had<br/>
happened to him in the last while. Not wanting to embarras him I played<br/>
along. He noticed my character hadnt any of the neat things he used to have<br/>
and offered to help me out. He gives me SEVERAL backpacks FULL of magic<br/>
Items and THEN takes me to the bank and SHOVELS 1600 pp into my pockets! I<br/>
nearly faint! I thank him and promise to group with him soon as he<br/>
camps..waves and POOFS out. Man! I think Im drunk on money! I was actually<br/>
ENCUMBERED by the MONEY he gave me! (160 lbs worth!)<br/>
