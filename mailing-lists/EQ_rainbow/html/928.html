Hi group,<br/>
<br/>
  I also found another G/L/B/T EQ group here on Yahoo.  After reading <br/>
their posts I found that a lot of them play on the Namelss server.  <br/>
So I and my friend Dale (another gay EQer) have started characters on <br/>
Nameless.<br/>
<br/>
  We are Hype (me), 5th wood elf bard, and Fliq (Dale), 5th wood elf <br/>
druid.  I&#39;m thinking of restarting Pyotr on that server too.<br/>
<br/>
  If anyone is on Nameless server, please let me know so I can friend <br/>
list you and maybe we can group.  I have talked to another gay EQer <br/>
and he is gonna join us there.<br/>
<br/>
  thanks,<br/>
 <br/>
    Scott</div>
