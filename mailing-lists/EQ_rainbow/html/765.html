<div id="ygrps-yiv-93030773">I&#39;m not sure of Lockjaw&#39;s level either, but I was part of a group that<br/>
killed him once. We had a 19 troll warrior, an 18 druid and me, a 17 druid.<br/>
We druids could not cast any DD spells on him because he was too high. We<br/>
simply damage shielded our warrior and healed him till we were OOM while he<br/>
beat the thing. However, even though we were successful at getting the kill<br/>
(and the experience), about 2 or 3 other ungrouped people were beating on<br/>
him too. Without the others beating on him, we would not have won.<br/>
<br/>
LJ seems to have a random spawn and I think one of the other gators must be<br/>
a place holder for him. I&#39;ve gone hours and hours without hearing of an LJ<br/>
sighting and then he&#39;ll spawn twice in 15 minutes. He can spawn as far south<br/>
as the orc camp near S Ro, and almost as far north as the N Ro zone and<br/>
anywhere along the shore in between. Because of some nice loot, he also has<br/>
one of the shortest lifespans of any creature in Norrath. I have read that<br/>
he is about level 24 or 25.<br/>
<br/>
The best bet to find him is kill as many gators (crocs and caimens and their<br/>
deep water cousins) and have 2 or 3 trackers spaced evenly along the coast<br/>
trying to pick him up. Then you better be ready to move quick or someone<br/>
else will get the kill.<br/>
