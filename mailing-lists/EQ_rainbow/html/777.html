Welcome to the board, & I Hope you come over to Rodcet. It&#39;s a great group<br/>
of folks, & there&#39;s almost always at least one other member on (this morning<br/>
(7:30am EST) there were three of us, average is around 10-15 at night.) Like<br/>
David said, there&#39;s characters of all different levels, & I seem to love<br/>
hanging out in the single digits so much I doubt I&#39;ll ever get to 10!<br/>

Subject: [EQ_rainbow] Hello EQ Rainbow<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello All,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am pleased to now be a member of the EQ Rainbow board.  I found<br/>
&gt; your listing through one of the other EQ message boards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been seriously thinking of relocating servers to join many of<br/>
&gt; you on the Rodcet Nife server.  Currently i have several low level<br/>
&gt; characters on the Mithaniel Marr server, so if any of you are on that<br/>
&gt; server please give me an in-game tell or email me (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jdincinci@...">jdincinci@...</a>).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A little about me:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; * James Dillon<br/>
&gt; * 28<br/>
&gt; * I live in Cincinnati, OH and work for an advertising agency as<br/>
&gt; their Information Systems person, i.e. Nick Burns (for all of you<br/>
&gt; Saturday Night Live fans).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Primary Character (right now):  Renette 10 Wood Elf Druid<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have several other characters, but Renette is the one i&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; playing most lately.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most Hated EQ Monster:  The Kerran High Guard.  My first character<br/>
&gt; was an Erudite Magician and i was one of the rare people that<br/>
&gt; actually hunted in Tox Forest and Kerra Isle.  That Kerran High Guard<br/>
&gt; must have killed me 50 times before i decided to take my first boat<br/>
&gt; ride to Qeynos.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Favorite EQ Monster:  Spectre (Only because they are neat looking)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well i will stop there.  I will probably create a character on Rodcet<br/>
&gt; Nife now just so i can have a fun group to chat with.  Do you have<br/>
&gt; any low level characters in your guild (Mystic Alliance)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I am glad to have found this group and other gay people that<br/>
&gt; like playing EQ...I knew you were out there!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; James<br/>
&gt;<br/>
