<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187738805">I wrote a big rant about online gender, and then accidentally posted it to<br/>
the wrong mailing list (EQ_women).  I&#39;m kind of out there already, but I<br/>
have to admit I&#39;m now a little worried that my over queer-positive<br/>
political ramblings might alienate a few of the more conservative straight<br/>
girls *sigh*.  Hopefully not.  I could say &#39;ah screw them&#39; but I&#39;m not<br/>
trying to make &#39;queer positive&#39; a requirement for being on the list,<br/>
though I would speak out against any queer negative stuff posted to the<br/>
list.<br/>

I think I could write a whole book ranting about online gender<br/>
presentation, assumption of heterosexuality, and how queer people basicly<br/>
get screwed over, but I&#39;ll try and make this brief 8)<br/>
<br/>
First of all, let&#39;s put Everquest in it&#39;s true class: Virtual Reality.  It<br/>
may be primitive, but it is virtual reality, and to anyone who&#39;s ever had<br/>
someone tap them on the shoulder because they&#39;ve been talking to you for<br/>
five minutes and you haven&#39;t heard a damned thing knows, it&#39;s immersive<br/>
virtual reality.<br/>
<br/>
People naturally try and relate to their virtual reality experience like<br/>
they would to their real life experience.  This doesn&#39;t mean they take<br/>
everything as seriously (otherwise death would reallly suck) but they will<br/>
naturally impose real life qualities in terms of how them form<br/>
relationships and socialize online.  These natural social tendancies may<br/>
be modified by concious choice, but at the root they are all there.<br/>
<br/>
People are used to classifying another person&#39;s gender.  You don&#39;t walk up<br/>
to someone on the street (usually) and say &quot;you look like a boy, you act<br/>
like a boy, are you a boy?&quot; We&#39;re expected to recognize these qualities,<br/>
classify the person as a boy, and then relate to them as a boy.<br/>
<br/>
People do this same thing naturally in EQ, though not to as an extreme.<br/>
For example:<br/>
    - You see a male character, you assume this is a male player, you&#39;d<br/>
      probably need to be told outright by the person they were female<br/>
      to believe otherwise.<br/>
    - You see a female character, things are more complicated:<br/>
        - Most people will not try and classify her gender directly I<br/>
          think.  They&#39;ll be aware that most female EQ characters are<br/>
          played by males.  This introduces gender confusion.  They don&#39;t<br/>
          know how to really deal with a person with a female body but<br/>
          a male mind so they&#39;ll basicly treat the person like a female<br/>
          on the surface, but probably not commit to their gender.<br/>
        - If that female character exhibits behavioral characteristics<br/>
          that seem female it is very comfortable to allow your gender<br/>
          &#39;no commitment&#39; stance to slip into &#39;this person is a female<br/>
          in real life&#39;.<br/>
        - Likewise if this character exhibits male characteristics, <br/>
          the person may slip into the assumption the player is male.<br/>
          All this avoids the need to ask the person what their gender is.<br/>
        - FLIRTING OF ANY KIND is assumed to indicate gender under the<br/>
          assumption the player is heterosexual.<br/>
        - Some people are aware enough of the complexity of online gender,<br/>
          and care enough about real life gender, to skip all this and ask<br/>
          (usually to confirm their assumptions)<br/>
<br/>
Queer people get screwed by this in many ways.  Lots of people who<br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t ID as queer also get screwed.<br/>
<br/>
The above rules are arbitrary, and dumb! They are the rules most people go<br/>
by.  If a person decides on your real life gender by these rules, even<br/>
worse if a group of people decide on your gender, their is the fundamental<br/>
assumption that you actively deceived them.  Lets not pull punches,<br/>
everyone who decides your gender, when you reveal you are of the other<br/>
gender, will basicly have their entire gender model of you flipped upside<br/>
down.  This will create confusion, and potentially hostility.  Of course<br/>
anyone who is not a jerk should realize that their assumptions were wrong,<br/>
but most people are jerks about gender.<br/>
<br/>
So what can you do to protect yourself in this environment?<br/>
<br/>
You can be up front about your real-life gender.  This will however to<br/>
some degree prevent you from getting into intense gender interaction with<br/>
people as a member of your online perceived gender.  Playing a person of<br/>
the opposite gender in EQ is a great way to explore gender in a fun<br/>
environment.  Exploring gender is fun and good.<br/>
<br/>
You can be passive about your gender.  This is what our list boys have<br/>
done.  They let people assume their genders as females, since they didn&#39;t<br/>
actively in this way deceive anyone.  I think this is perfectly 100% ok.<br/>
Now however they&#39;re getting screwed over by the realization that they can<br/>
no longer safely come out without alienating some of their friends.<br/>
<br/>
You can lie outright about your gender.  I think this is perfectly ok as<br/>
well.  Why? Because you&#39;re not hurting anyone.  Really the gender / sexual<br/>
orientation hangups of other people is not our problem.  Really, our<br/>
gender in real life is irrelevant to the game of Everquest.  People<br/>
demand to know real life gender because they have hangups about online /<br/>
real life gender continuity.  Tough luck! It&#39;s not your responsibility to<br/>
support their environment where they have this kind of knowledge.  You<br/>
never aksed to be part of that environment.  You can also say &quot;I won&#39;t<br/>
answer that question&quot; but people will eventually assume you&#39;re not of your<br/>
perceived gender, and they&#39;ll mistrust you.<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t like to lie.  They like to be honest, especially with people<br/>
they have good social relationships with.  I think it&#39;s important to<br/>
realize that an relationship in an online virtual reality is not like a<br/>
real life social relationship.  Unless you are going to have some kind of<br/>
real life social relationship with someone online, I think it&#39;s perfectly<br/>
reasonable to lie about your gender, your sexual orientation, anything if<br/>
it creates an environment you&#39;re more comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
We are the queer gender-exploring fringe, moving into an online virtual<br/>
environment.  The straight heterosexist establishment is imposing on VR<br/>
it&#39;s own moral code, but I feel no need to participate in it.<br/>
