&gt; Hello all.  I&#39;m new to the group and relatively new to the EQ world<br/>
&gt; as well.  I&#39;m not new to being gay (haha).  I have looked at some of<br/>
&gt; the previous post and have been amazed that there are others like me<br/>
&gt; out there (That sounds just like I did when I first discovered that<br/>
&gt; there were other boys and girls in the world just like me).  Sorry I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t mean to sound so clicheist (is that really a word?)  Anyway I<br/>
&gt; have had a couple of run ins with other players who figured out that<br/>
&gt; I was gay, I honestly don&#39;t know how.  And the experience was not<br/>
&gt; nice at all.  But hey that&#39;s the way of the world be it Norath or<br/>
&gt; Real Life.  I play on Brell and would love to meet others and group<br/>
&gt; with them if its possible, please write and lets go out and kill<br/>
&gt; something.<br/>
