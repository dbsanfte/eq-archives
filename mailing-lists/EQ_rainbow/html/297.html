<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405122312">Greetings everyone:) This gender issue caught my attention, and <br/>
also brought me around to thinking what it all boils down to. This <br/>
society teachings its hatchling, as it were, that what they see is <br/>
what they get, science uses this law as an almost pivital cruch to <br/>
lean upon. It you cant measure, dissect, disassemble, then <br/>
reassemble it doesnt exist. Well the problem is that somethings <br/>
can be taken apart and put back together again and not have some <br/>
integral part of them destroyed in the process. Man&#39;s greatest flaw <br/>
in his arragance, his assumption that what is in front of his nose is <br/>
just simply all there is and be damned if there is something else <br/>
cause he dont believe in it. And, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed from the <br/>
Polictics of Man, the Status Quo is ever so hard to break.<br/>
So here you have a buncha folks running at breakneck speed into <br/>
the darkness of their own ignorance. Why? Simply because the <br/>
guy in front of him is. i guess the real question would be who is at <br/>
the head of the line, but thats another debate.<br/>
	Perception governs Reality. A phrase often over look, oft toss <br/>
out a mere metaphysical mombojumbo. Well lets take a look at it. <br/>
Everything we see, smell, taste, hear, interact with is completely <br/>
real to us at this moment. Obvious it would seem yes? But think <br/>
back to your last memory of Dreaming, all of that seeming <br/>
completely real as well. Even when I knew i was Dreaming I still <br/>
would find myself remarking on the reality of the situation. Now <br/>
granted when you wake up the waking world is <br/>
quite discernable from the sleeping one, and you <br/>
wonder how you could have ever been fooled...<br/>
And that is perhaps what I am rambling on to, most people dont <br/>
like to think they&#39;ve been fooled; dont like the feeling of having the <br/>
rug yanked out from under them. Unfortunitly (or fortunitly <br/>
depending on your level of malice) this online age has spawned a <br/>
thousand ways to dupe your fellow man, from pyramid schemes <br/>
and malignant lines of system command to simply appearing as <br/>
the opposite gender than what you really are. But here is my <br/>
answer to the debate. When we enter EQ we enter Norrath. Now <br/>
even though I&#39;m not the strictist RPer and sometimes have <br/>
discussions or make commits about this world in that one thats <br/>
really no big deal as i see it. I still walk in the bounds of my <br/>
character&#39;s personality, RPing Nazism only drives those that might <br/>
be interested in RPing away. Its hard to adequetly RP a character <br/>
in a now speaking non-facial expression environment. Having to be <br/>
a fast typist is just one of the many pitfalls to this delima:) But <br/>
back to what I was saying before, we are in Norrath, in the bodies <br/>
of our characters, we are them for that time, male or female. If <br/>
someone wants to ask you what your RL gender is its at your <br/>
discretion to tell them, but you should not feel guilty about playing <br/>
the opposite gender. In fact if everyone believes you are that gender <br/>
you should congradulate yourself on an RP job well done. People <br/>
will always bitch about things, hell even I do (especially about <br/>
Verant&#39;s &quot;HAHA we all really HATE Rogues over here&quot; policy;) but <br/>
that doesnt mean you have to listen to any of it. God gave us <br/>
fingers so we could plug our ears and hands to cover our eyes:) <br/>
More Christian Groups should head that advice...<br/>
Anyway I&#39;ve gone on long enough, I say place what you want and <br/>
have no regrets. There is no way you can go back and chance the <br/>
past so why waste the future regreting it?<br/>
Take care all you crazy faggots;)<br/>
<br/>
Over and out.<br/>
