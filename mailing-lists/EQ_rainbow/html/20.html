<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-193635343">Id like to say Hi too.  I play a monk known as Jinsu on the Bertrboxxis<br/>
(spelled horrably wrong, but the only one like that) server.  I uselly hang<br/>
out in the freeport area, although I am looking for a change of scenery.<br/>
I am a male and looking to hook up with one of those really cute half even<br/>
guys..  They did a real good job those models :)    Maybe if this list gets<br/>
decent sized someone can make a character list per server so we can atleast<br/>
meet that way.<br/>
