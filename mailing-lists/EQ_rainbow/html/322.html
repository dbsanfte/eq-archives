&lt;&lt; Other side of water ? .. I haven&#39;t ventured far enough into Najena to get <br/>
to<br/>
 her. So is there water in the cave  part? or is there another location<br/>
 elsewhere ? I know that we are headed to get the FBR by the weekend.. so if<br/>
 there is 2 spots any information would be nice<br/>
 <br/>
 Also, Wht other rare items are in the dungeon ? I know of the boots, RBR,<br/>
 backpack ? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To get to nejena you have to swim throught a short tunel. Watch out there are <br/>
two frglok gouls that spawn in the water, but inv to undead negates there <br/>
threat. <br/>
<br/>
Other good items that can be found in Nejena is<br/>
<br/>
1. Stelotto of the bloodclaw.<br/>
2. Barbed Leather Whip.<br/>
3. tentical whip<br/>
4. Black tomb with silver runes<br/>
5. glowing black stone<br/>
6. Runed Cowell<br/>
<br/>
and of corse the only place to get large bronze.<br/>
