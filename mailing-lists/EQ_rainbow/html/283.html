<div id="ygrps-yiv-144967088">Hi, Rhonda here, was wondering if anyone was on the Tunare server?  I have a lvl 9 druid there, I don&#39;t know if I can handle starting all over again, there&#39;s alot of personal stuff going on right not, but I would like to be in the guild.  I could still make one on Brell but would like to have the guild on tunare too.  Anyone on the list there want to hang out?  My druid&#39;s name is Miile look me up.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda</div>
