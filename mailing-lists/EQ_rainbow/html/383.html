<div id="ygrps-yiv-303080745">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who have volunteered to be the guild leader for Mystical<br/>
Alliance on the other servers (other than Brell Serilis) I need some information<br/>
from you. On many of the servers, I do not have a character yet, so the easiest<br/>
thing is for me to create a new character in a starting city this is convenient<br/>
to where you are located. So, send me the following information:<br/>
<br/>
Name of guild leader character:<br/>
Nearest starting city:<br/>
<br/>
In order for me to make you guild leader, I have to be in the same zone as you.<br/>
I don&#39;t think we even have to be logged on at the same time, but I am not sure.<br/>
Verant has changed the way guilds are set up by the GM&#39;s. I am under the<br/>
understanding that I can petition a GM any time during regular customer service<br/>
hours. So, as I receive the above info from you, I will begin getting this done.<br/>
After you give me the information, you may wish to &#39;park&#39; your character in this<br/>
city so I can go ahead and assign you as the leader.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to begin working on our web site soon. I will keep you posted.<br/>
<br/>
RAINBOW FESTIVAL<br/>
Also, Christina (who has been leveling her Luna character quite nicely I might<br/>
add) suggested that we have some sort of guild meeting in Norrath on one of the<br/>
servers. A chance to get together and chat. I am working on finding a time for<br/>
this and will let you know. It will probably be this Saturday, the 28th. We will<br/>
meet on Brell Serilis and probably in the Freeport area as it is centrally<br/>
located. If you don&#39;t have a character on Brell, you can just create a newbie<br/>
character so you can meet with everyone. If you have a character, but need help<br/>
traveling, let me know and we can arrange escorts beforehand.<br/>
<br/>
After the get together, those who want to can do some hunting together. We can<br/>
break up into hunting groups based on levels. I will provide binds and corpse<br/>
locating for anyone who needs it. Also, I may have some mino axes for some<br/>
hunters to borrow (but I will need them back after the hunt. Gotta get money to<br/>
buy my spells :) It might be fun to see a bunch of level 1 melee types with mino<br/>
axes, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have any ideas for other fun things we can do during our festival,<br/>
please post to the list.<br/>
