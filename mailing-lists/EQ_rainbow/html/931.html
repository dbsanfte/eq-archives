<div id="ygrps-yiv-716824935">To minimize spam I am going to configure this list to not let people post<br/>
until it&#39;s approved.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of sucks, I like people just being able to join, but we have<br/>
been getting too much spam lately.<br/>
<br/>
As an asside, while I am happy to continue to maintain this list I must<br/>
admit I am feeling like a bit of a slacker these days. If someone feels<br/>
like they would like to maintain the list, and perhaps even put some<br/>
additional effort into managing it more effectively, email me off the list<br/>
and let me know =) Otherwise I will continue to moderate it in my<br/>
slacker-type fashion.<br/>
