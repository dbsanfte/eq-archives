Subject: An Unauthorized Use of my EQ Guild<br/>

&gt; Dear Verant,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My name is David Lari and my station account ID is laridj<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Recently, I had a guild approved by you. It is called Mystical Alliance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It has come to my attention, that someone, without my authorization, has<br/>
&gt; gotten a GM to set up the guild on the E&#39;ci server. The name of the<br/>
&gt; character who pulled off this feat is Tarismo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have several questions. It is my understanding that if I am the guild<br/>
&gt; master as approved by Verant, that I am the one who gets the guild<br/>
&gt; established on the various servers and that I am the guild master. Is<br/>
&gt; this correct?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If it is correct, then through whose lapse of procedure did my guild get<br/>
&gt; &#39;hijacked&#39; by this other person? How can this be prevented in the<br/>
&gt; future?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have spent much time /petitioning to try to get this situation<br/>
&gt; resolved with a GM, but have not found a time when the GM is on the E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt; server. I have requested, and am reiterating my request, to have the<br/>
&gt; guild deleted from that server and recreated with my Dedric character<br/>
&gt; being the guild master.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope I can count on your timely resolution of this issue. If there is<br/>
&gt; a specific time that I may meet a GM online to resolve this, please let<br/>
&gt; me know via return email.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>
&gt; David Lari<br/>
