<b>Subject:</b> Hi everyone <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-947554307">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
A friend was creating a new eq list (there&#39;s only about 480 at the <br/>
moment, heh) today and while I was scanning through them I found this <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
My first thought was, &quot;Joy! Rapture!&quot; and I quickly subbed.<br/>
<br/>
A little bit about myself:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 26?  Argh, where&#39;s my ginkobiloba? My birthday is later this <br/>
month, so I&#39;ll let you know definitely as soon as my grandmother <br/>
calls.  Although I&#39;m sure it&#39;s getting hard to find those little <br/>
teddy-bear cards with the wheels with the ages written on them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
I live in Atlanta with Ye Olde Hubby.  I am a technician for <br/>
Healtheon/WebMD and I get to talk to dental receptionists all day. (I <br/>
can sense your jealousy).  It&#39;s not a bad gig - I&#39;ve even installed <br/>
EQ here but our network is a joke, so..<br/>
<br/>
Both my hubby Chillos (it&#39;s a family name of Greek origin or so we <br/>
believe) and I play on The Rathe server.  I have a 28th lvl half-elf <br/>
Ranger and a 16th lvl Dark Elf necromancer.  We both belong to a <br/>
guild of really good people (well, mostly good) that a friend (who is <br/>
gay as well) introduced us to.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve played EQ since Phase IV beta, been a guide for about 4 months <br/>
on Veeshan (aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!) and have successfully <br/>
recovered from burn-out (which is why my ranger is only 28).  Other <br/>
games I have played include Meridian59 (server 107) for three years <br/>
(off-and-on) and Ultima Online, although hubby has a LOT more <br/>
experiences in UO than I do.. I mostly just ran (if you could call <br/>
running with that lag running) from everyone, believing they were all <br/>
PKers.<br/>
<br/>
Ummm.. what else?  Should you want to know more about us, surf on <br/>
over to our website at:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://people.atl.mediaone.net/chillicub/">http://people.atl.mediaone.net/chillicub/</a><br/>
<br/>
Oh, and it&#39;s safe to surf while you&#39;re at work.. (nudge nudge, wink <br/>
wink)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read the past 20 posts or so.. am I correct in piecing together <br/>
that there is a gay guild on Rodcet-Nife?  and or Nameless?  As much <br/>
as I dearly love our guild on Rathe I would really love to join a gay <br/>
guild.<br/>
<br/>
Guess that&#39;s about it (aren&#39;t you glad?)-<br/>

<br/>
Oh, for anyone who&#39;s interested, the guild we belong to (I&#39;m outing <br/>
myself here) is Silver Blade ... my characters are Zacharus <br/>
Anam&#39;Matghamuin and Lucentio Duarte (mostly Lucentio)... Chillos is <br/>
Beja or Chillos (mostly Beja)</div>
