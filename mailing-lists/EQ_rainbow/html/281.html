<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748993048">Here are few tips for those on the list that are new to Everquest. THIS<br/>
list of &#39;rules&#39; has saved me more often than not. Hope they are useful to<br/>
you:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Someone yells RUN! - YOU RUN and DONT ask &#39;What?&#39; - If you ask what,<br/>
you usually DIE and then find out. Example - I was fighting something in<br/>
the desert...someone yelled RUN..I turned too look...I was stunned to see a<br/>
Sand Giant chasing after someone near me..VERY near me. They zoned...Sand<br/>
Giant saw me and Squashed me like a bug.<br/>
<br/>
2) If you are in a party and someone yells RUN..follow the above rule.<br/>
<br/>
3) If you are in a party and someone or everyone just isnt listening or<br/>
working together...DISBAND and leave those losers to die..because is you<br/>
don&#39;t, you will DIE with them.<br/>
<br/>
4) If you can buff someone, do so. Making friends can be fun and<br/>
profitable. They will remember you and probably help YOU out someday.<br/>
<br/>
5) Never be afraid (or too cautious) to try a new place to hunt or explore.<br/>
Meat and Potatos of EQ is exploring..fun fun fun!<br/>
<br/>
6) ALWAYS get a bind in a new city if you can. You&#39;d really hate having to<br/>
run all the way to a new continent just to get your things.<br/>
<br/>
7) CONs the bad guys before attacking! You may live longer.<br/>
<br/>
8) AVOID making a train and leading it by others as you try to ZONE FOR<br/>
YOUR LIFE! They WILL remember you and made get even later.<br/>
<br/>
9) Good rule of thumb - put at least 4 gold, a weapon, 4 water and food in<br/>
the bank...maybe a backpack if you can. Nothing like dying and coming back<br/>
poor, defenseless and hungry.<br/>
<br/>
Welp, those are some things that have served me well. If they help you too,<br/>
COOL!<br/>
<br/>
Love ya all!<br/>
