<div id="ygrps-yiv-77931530">It was great running around with Dedric, and starting to feel a bit of<br/>
community, and from the turnout at the guild creation chat, it can only get<br/>
better from here!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not even going to enter the name wars going on, other than to say that I<br/>
hope we have a name.  I have my opinions, but I don&#39;t think there will be<br/>
any name that will be satisfying to everyone.  So I&#39;ll just say that I don&#39;t<br/>
care what the name is.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a quick correction, my gnome warrior is named Bambus ;-)<br/>
<br/>
See you in the game!<br/>
Kurt/Bambus &lt;insert guild name here&gt;<br/>

| Yes, I&#39;m starting to get to the point that I really don&#39;t care at all<br/>
about<br/>
| the name. The important thing is having a guild and the advantages of it.<br/>
|<br/>
| Last night Kurt and his Bumpus character met up with my Dedric character<br/>
on<br/>
| Brell and we helped each other out. We tried to get ruined wolf pelts so<br/>
we<br/>
| can make size small patchwork for our guild members. And he helped collect<br/>
| bone chips for me to use for my Necro pet spells. And then I got an extra<br/>
| pair of shoes off an Orc Pawn and gave them to Bumpus since he didn&#39;t have<br/>
| any shoes. This is what I see as the advantage of the guild that will be<br/>
| universal to all the servers the guild is represented on.<br/>
|<br/>
| However, on the Brell Serilis server, we may wish to have a charter that<br/>
| emphasizes role playing more since it is a role playing server. So this<br/>
| aspect might not be shared among all the chapters.<br/>
|<br/>
| So, if any of you come over to gnome land, just look for Dedric and<br/>
Bumpus.<br/>
| Also, we travel to Greater Faydark a bit too, so you Wood and High Elves<br/>
| give us a tell too.<br/>
|<br/>
| And hopefully we&#39;ll have some consensus on a name for the guild. At this<br/>
| point I am going to agree with whatever gets the most support from<br/>
everyone<br/>
| else just so we can move on.<br/>
