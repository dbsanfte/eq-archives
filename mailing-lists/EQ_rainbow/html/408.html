&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Two tourists were driving through Louisiana. As they were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     approaching Natchitoches, they started arguing about the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     pronunciation of the town. They argued back and forth until they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     stopped for lunch.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     As they stood at the counter, one tourist asked the blonde<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     employee, &quot;Before we order, could you please settle an argument<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     for us? Would you please pronounce where we are... very slowly?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     The blonde girl leaned over the counter and said, &quot;Burrrrrrrr,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     gerrrrrrr, Kiiiiing&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
