<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590189257">Yay Toronto! Nice to meet you.  I hope you had a happy pride! I marched in the parade this year.<br/>

Starting level 1s can be a lot of fun.  It&#39;s pretty easy to get those first 10 or so levels.  There&#39;s no feeling like leveling from 1 to 5 in the course of a couple hours.  I consider myself someone of a elf supernewbie, since I know I can just throw any 1st level character into the Kelethin newbie zone, and get her up to a full set of patchwork, a decent weapon, and 5th level in a couple hours.  Kelethin is just such a dream zone.<br/>

If I see a guy out with an &quot;I love EQ&quot; T-shirt at one of the local bars, I&#39;ll say hi, maybe it will be you =)<br/>

&gt; Wow...it is so great to see this list really taking off :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just a brief intro...I&#39;m a 23 year old gay male also living in Toronto (waves to his neighbour Christina *grin*)<br/>
&gt; and am currently enrolled in a Computer Programming degree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been playing EQ quite awhile now, yet usually only get my chars to level 10 or so before trying yet another class!<br/>
&gt; (Hence my Supernewbie status *grin*)<br/>
&gt; I think this list is a great idea as it is good to know I am not the only non-hetero addicted to this game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am planning on starting another level 1...probably on the new server, maybe if anyone is interested they might give me a shout...<br/>
&gt; but probably many of you are quite attached to your current personas. *smile*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am looking forward to seeing many more posts and thanks again Christina for getting the ball rolling!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Todd :)<br/>
