<div id="ygrps-yiv-934442984">Hi again.<br/>
<br/>
I love the idea of the Mystic Alliance.  Unfortunately...I am one of those<br/>
people who plays just one character.  On top of that I&#39;m an officer in Light<br/>
of Norrath on the Karana server.  As such I don&#39;t see myself bailing out of<br/>
the guild I&#39;m in right at the moment.  I&#39;ve only bumped into a couple of gay<br/>
folks on Karana...and those I know in RL.<br/>
<br/>
If enough people get together and want to form the guild on Karana..let me<br/>
know.  I&#39;d be willing to switch at that time.<br/>
