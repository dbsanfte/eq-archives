<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162348361">Hey Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
     I know we usually post EQ info here but I wanted to bring up something<br/>
that REALLY disturbed me that I heard on the Radio this morning. Apparently<br/>
William Shatners wife was found dead in their pool in Los Angeles. Mr.<br/>
Shatner had arrived home and found her in the pool and tried CPR to no<br/>
avail. Her death is now under investigation.<br/>
     I know many people growing up watch Star Trek. Many have certain<br/>
opinions about the actors of the show, but putting that aside...William<br/>
Shatner as Kirk was my inspiration growing up. He was to me what I wanted<br/>
to be when I &#39;grew up&#39; (still waiting on the growing up part and Im 34<br/>
now). He had courage, could woo anyone of any race...fight the good fight<br/>
and do some really neat and unrealistic Judo neck chops! Whew! What a man!<br/>
     It really upsets me about his wife. NO matter who you are or how mean<br/>
and spitful some say someone is, the death of someone they hold dear is<br/>
tragic. I hope the Coroner can ascertain the cause of her death so Mr.<br/>
Shatner can get on with with things and morne her. My prayers go out to him<br/>
and his family.<br/>
