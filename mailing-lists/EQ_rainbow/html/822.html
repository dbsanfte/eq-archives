<br/>
<br/>
This is Fentus, I think you know me from the guild?  If you didint get your<br/>
info for those spells, i did look them up ()sorry about the delay)  the aura<br/>
one you need to get in the overthere, the earth one you need to reserach,<br/>
and the vision one you need to buy at any vendor.  Sorry i dont remeber the<br/>
names of the spells but i&#39;m asure you will get them.  also are you on the<br/>
guild mailinf list?  This mailing list is for glbts eq&#39;rs in general and we<br/>
also have a list for the guild.  If you did not recieve any info about that<br/>
when you joined, and you should have, please send an e-mail to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:andy@...">andy@...</a> who is the guildleader.   Additionally, I see you have a<br/>
warrior in my lvl range.  UMMM  I AM  A WIZARD I NEED A TANK :)   You would<br/>
be a great asset to us in the 30&#39;s range cuz all we have for a tank is my<br/>
scrawny ranger boyfriend :)  So bring her on !!!!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hiyas! Im excited to be a new member of this emailing community!! :)<br/>
&gt;  Hmm, for those who are interested in newcomers, I might as well introduce<br/>
&gt; myself a bit.  hehe :D<br/>
&gt;   Lets see.. I have played EQ for a bout a year now, beginning on Nameless<br/>
&gt; then switching to Rodcet around April of this year :)    At the moment my<br/>
two<br/>
&gt; main characters on Rodcet are Ivymayden D&#39;Zephyr ~ 34 Woodelf Warrior and<br/>
&gt; Melalle ~ 15 Dark Elf Romancer.  (but im a good witch!) among a few other<br/>
&gt; chars I got bored with hehe.  I recently discovered Mystic Alliance and<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; overjoyed! I had no idea there was such a guild on EQ!!  These past few<br/>
weeks<br/>
&gt; have been some of the best since I joined :D   Ok, ill draw the line on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; intro here!  Im looking forward to meeting the Rainbow crew!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
