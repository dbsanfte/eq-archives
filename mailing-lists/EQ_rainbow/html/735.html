<div id="ygrps-yiv-986526570">Hey Melanie,<br/>
<br/>
you sound like me and rob, we love computers.  They are fun to build :)<br/>
Unfortunatly we need mroe moneyfor our hobby.  My computer is an athlon<br/>
700 with 128M ram (very important for EQ i think) and a TNT2 ultra (32M)<br/>
video card.  I&#39;d like a new video card soon, I think the ATI radeon looks<br/>
fantastic.  Poor rob has only a AMD K62-400 with 64M, and a voodoo3 2000<br/>
(used ot be mine but rob had problems with his TNT2 ultra so we switched),<br/>
you&#39;d think that this configuarion would ROCK, but it dosnt.  I think<br/>
another 64M ram would help him alot but he is dead set on getting a faster<br/>
processor than me ;) hehehhe<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hmm. Except for the fact that I have 128 meg or RAM, Ompa, you just<br/>
&gt; &gt; described my main computer. Maybe it&#39;s time I upgrade.<br/>
