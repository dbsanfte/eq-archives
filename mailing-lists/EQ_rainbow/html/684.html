<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262414313">Hi, All!<br/>
<br/>
Chris and I are currently playing on the Lanys T&#39;Vyl server (I&#39;m Hammond -<br/>
10th Season Wiz, Chris plays Sbil - 7th Season Paladin) where we play with<br/>
the Bears guild, Ordo Ursi Prismatus. Some of the non-gay/les guilds have<br/>
been very friendly, consistent and fun to play with, like the Mystic Dragons<br/>
and Elements of Apocalypse. Are there any guilds who are openly hostile to<br/>
GLBT players?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re on Lanys, and you see an Ordo member, say hello! We&#39;re an<br/>
adventurous group, and we love to play!<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to all,<br/>
Jack<br/>

&quot;Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging. Celebrity skin, is<br/>
this your chin, or is that war you&#39;re waging?&quot; RHCP</div>
