I just joined up here and<br/>\n&gt;wanted to give some information.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My nameis Owen DuBose and I&#39;m a relatively new player to EQ but a<br/>\n&gt;lifelong sci-fi, fantasy and RPG fan. My partner Dan Watson and I<br/>\n&gt;both play EQ on the Brell Serilis server and are looking for other<br/>\n&gt;gay/lesbian friends to meet on our server.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My primary character is an Ogre ShadowKnight named Grackk, level 12,<br/>\n&gt;currently sittinga round Neriak (a/k/a Scrunchyville) trying to level<br/>\n&gt;up fletching, smithing and brewing skills while taking side trips to<br/>\n&gt;Lavastorm to kill drakes and rock dervishes :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My secondary character is a Human Cleric named Dhalgren who is<br/>\n&gt;currentl hanging in N. Qeynos taking trips to Blackburrow to harass<br/>\n&gt;some the gnolls. He is 6th level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dan&#39;s primary character is a 13th lvl DE Necro named Staben who is, I<br/>\n&gt;believe currently blitzing around E Commons/N ro/ S Ro and Oasis.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dan has a secondary character he hasn&#39;t even played yet, lol.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We are very interested in the possibilty of being a part of a g/l<br/>\n&gt;guild on Brell or starting one if there isn&#39;t one. We are also<br/>\n&gt;interested in locating other &quot;bear&quot; and &quot;big bear&quot; buddies on Brell<br/>\n&gt;to group with or talk to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Feel free to to email me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bigbear@...\">bigbear@...</a>!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Owen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet more from the Web.
