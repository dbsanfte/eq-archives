If I were a PVP person, I&#39;d take you up on that. However, I am just<br/>\none of the those wimpy girls who&#39;d rather just battle it with the monsters<br/>\nrather than people too. My partner is even worse. She&#39;s bad enough now when<br/>\nshe gets killed! &lt;grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI will keep your email though, because who knows? I could end up getting bored<br/>\non the regular servers and need a little more excitement in my life... heheh.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow long have you two been playing? What types of chars do you have? I&#39;ve<br/>\nactually got six chars spread between two servers: Brell and Erollisi. A<br/>\npally, ranger, druid, shaman, warrior and enchanter. Almost all mid- to<br/>\nhigh-teens.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I come over to Rallos, what name should I look for?
