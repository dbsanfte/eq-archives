Why? Because we like screwing with you!<br/>\n<br/>\n                                      -Enchanters can now enchant items...but only Rusty Daggers, Iron Rations, and Ice Goblin<br/>\n                                      Necklaces.<br/>\n<br/>\n                                      -Necromancers have a new summon spell to replace each one from level 4 up, &quot;Summon McQuaid<br/>\n<br/>\n                                      -Shamans can now cast Enlarge.

It heals them when they kick. Why? Because a lot of people<br/>\n                                      bugged us about things. We didn&#39;t even really read them.

You see, Tom Buck thought that was hilarious [sic].<br/>\n<br/>\n                                      -Brewery can only make non-alcoholic beverages, to dispel rumors that we are drunk when we<br/>\n                                      come up with this stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n                                      -The new skill, &quot;Meth Lab&quot;, has been implement because we can relate to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n                                      -Tailoring was REALLY upsetting the economy. You can now tailor ONLY with the Skimpiest of<br/>\n                                      Vox and the Undies of Ungar, two items we haven&#39;t put in yet and probably never will. Mwa ha ha.<br/>\n<br/>\n                                      -Baking has been totally revamped.

This help the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n                                      -The Ghoulbane is now on a level 2 Dark Elf Shadow Knight in the Temple of Cazic-Thule. We don&#39;t<br/>\n                                      really give a flying defecation if it makes sense, it&#39;s OUR game, so, screw off!<br/>\n<br/>\n                                      -I don&#39;t want to spoil anything, of course, but you can find the Sword of Slashing Stuff, a 36/4<br/>\n                                      Magical Item that randomly casts Brad Breath, a 56000 point damage spell, on Emporer Tush in<br/>\n                                      Grobb (Hey, we don&#39;t care if we spell it right or not. As our company motto says, &quot;Screw you!&quot;).<br/>\n                                      Whoops. My mistake. I seem to forget there is a Backspace key. Oh well.<br/>\n<br/>\n                                      Thanks for playing!
