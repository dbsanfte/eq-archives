I hope so!   BUT if this is a<br/>\n&gt; major problem we can always delete all the guilds and restart the guild<br/>\n&gt; and call it Force of Synergy ahahahahhahahaha hehehehe hohoohohoh.  Have<br/>\n&gt; fun eveyrone and David let me know if we are all set, thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -joe (Fentus) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
