I&#39;m<br/>\nfine with this.  I&#39;d like to emphesize however that we need an official<br/>\nhome server for the guild, and I think this should be Brell Serelis.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I&#39;ve learned about guilds is that larger is usually better.<br/>\nUnless you&#39;re with a close knit group of real life friends, it&#39;s unlikely<br/>\nthat more than 20% of your guild will ever be online at any time.  Of that<br/>\n20%, only maybe one in three will have a character in the same level range<br/>\nas you.  This means a guild needs about 76 members before you can feel<br/>\nconfident there will be 5 other people on the server at any given time who<br/>\nyou can group with.  Now, you don&#39;t need to group with that many people<br/>\nall the time, but the fact remains that the more guild members you have,<br/>\nthe easier it will be to group and adventure together.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy having an official home server we can encourage people to play there.<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean deleting your characters on other servers.  It just<br/>\nmeans that you have a character on Brell Serelis, and you play that<br/>\ncharacter either regularly or at the suggested times (when possible).  All<br/>\nof us playing on the same server enables us to socialize more easily with<br/>\neachother, and get a better sense of community.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving guilds on other servers as well is 100% ok, so long as they don&#39;t<br/>\ndivide us.  I encourage people to run mirror guilds on other servers, so<br/>\nlong as they don&#39;t encourage people to migrate to their server (instead of<br/>\nBrell).  I also hope that people won&#39;t feel that playing in a mirror guild<br/>\nis a good substitiute for playing on Brell, but is instead something they<br/>\ndo in addition to playing on Brell.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
