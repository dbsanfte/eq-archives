I split my <br/>\ntime between Steib (41 druid) and Bliste (44 ranger), so please give <br/>\nme a tell sometime if you need anything.. ports or whatnot :)<br/>\nI also have a couple lower lvl alts I&#39;ve been playing more and would <br/>\nlove it if perhaps one or two of them would be allowed to join your <br/>\nfold (a 13 DE cleric.. 12 woody warrior.. 5 HE chanter).<br/>\nAnyways.. glad to see this happening :)<br/>\n/salute<br/>\n<br/>\nSee u in game :)<br/>\nSteib<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EQ_rainbow@y..., &quot;Alistair&quot; &lt;gameeverquest@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi folks:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A month ago I posted a message here about the new <br/>\n&gt; gay/lesbian/bi/trans guild on The Nameless server which was then <br/>\n&gt; called &quot;Stonewall Pride.&quot;  After some deliberation (and some wierd <br/>\n&gt; nerfing which happened to our guild after the last patch) we <br/>\ndecided <br/>\n&gt; to abandon Stonewall Pride and move everyone into the previously <br/>\n&gt; existing gay/lesbian guild called Nameless Love.  This was at the <br/>\n&gt; kind invitation of Tsinen, the head of Nameless Love.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thus gay/lesbian EverQuest people on The Nameless server may wish <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt; join us in the Nameless Love guild to enjoy a safe and friendly <br/>\n&gt; gay/lesbian environment.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Many of the new Nameless Love members are players of a lower level <br/>\n&gt; since we have all only recently moved to The Nameless server from <br/>\n&gt; other servers.  We love to group and hang out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We welcome all gay/lesbian/bi/trans EQers and hope to see you soon!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dandee Lyon, druid<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ps. Many thanks to Nameless Love for inviting us into their fold. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
