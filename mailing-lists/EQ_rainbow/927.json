Hurray!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am on the Bertoxx server and have 16th cleric Cryzstal, 9th  <br/>\npaladin Pyotr, and 8th druid Leatherboy.  (Leatherboy&#39;s original name  <br/>\nwas gayboy  but I thought that was a little too &#39;in-your-face&#39;.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have another friend who I group with late night who is gay and  <br/>\nwould love to meet or hear from other people.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for your replies!<br/>\n<br/>\n      Scott aka Pyotr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
