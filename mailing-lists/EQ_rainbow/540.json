The bad news is we are probably going<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; have to recreate the guild on Brell and Rodcet. Here&#39;s what happened.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once upon a time, we submitted our guild with the revised name &quot;Mystic<br/>\n&gt; Alliance&quot;. It was approved and I set it up on Brell Serilis. After setting<br/>\n&gt; it up, I noticed that while I had asked for &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; to be set<br/>\nup,<br/>\n&gt; they made me the guild leader of &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; (not that it is<br/>\n&gt; MysticAL not Mystic). I didn&#39;t really worry about it figuring that<br/>\nsomewhere<br/>\n&gt; along the line, the Verant folks had added an extra AL to the name as I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; seen plenty examples of their bad typing in the past.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, then we get a request from players on E&#39;ci to get the guild set up.<br/>\n&gt; However, we find out that the Mystical Alliance guild is already set up<br/>\n&gt; there. After some investigation by the GM Kyala, during which I ask her if<br/>\n&gt; there is a guild on her list called &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; and she assures me<br/>\n&gt; there isn&#39;t and that in fact, I am the verified leader of &quot;MysticAL<br/>\n&gt; Alliance&quot; she tells me she will delete the &quot;Mystical Alliance&quot; and<br/>\nrecreate<br/>\n&gt; it with me as leader.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After two months, I find out that she has not only failed to delete the<br/>\n&gt; guild, but is not the GM anymore. (Personally, I think she may have been<br/>\n&gt; short-changing Verant on her hours because I could almost never find her<br/>\n&gt; when she was supposed to be on. Maybe this led to her being fired -- I can<br/>\n&gt; only hope.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The email I sent to Kyala was forwarded to the new GM who, miracle of<br/>\n&gt; miracles, actually was online last night when I went to meet her to get<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; guild thing cleared up. It still took an hour, but when she finally got to<br/>\n&gt; me, she checked the list and found out that &quot;MysticAL Alliance&quot; was in<br/>\nfact<br/>\n&gt; assigned not to me but someone else. I then asked if &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot; was<br/>\n&gt; listed. Initially, she said no but then she checked (I guess) some other<br/>\n&gt; list and found that in fact there was a listing for &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot;<br/>\nafter<br/>\n&gt; all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, long story short, the original Brell GM who set us up made a mistake<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; then Kyala compounded it with misinformation, but finally the GM named<br/>\n&gt; Sal`Varae one E&#39;ci has fixed it. However, that means that we have the<br/>\nwrong<br/>\n&gt; guild name on Brell and Rodcet and our web site.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sadly, we just got the Rodcet Nife guild leadership transferred over to<br/>\nJoe<br/>\n&gt; (Fentus) a half hour before this mystical mystery was solved.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Brell, I would like to get the guild recreated with the correct Mystic<br/>\n&gt; Alliance name. I leave it up to the players on Rodcet to make that<br/>\ndecision,<br/>\n&gt; but I would recommend the same thing there so we don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>\n&gt; the &#39;real&#39; guild leader guy of Mystical Alliance coming along and making<br/>\nus<br/>\n&gt; delete it if he should find out it is a glbt guild.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, I need to make arrangements to get the guild leadership transferred<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci over to whoever is going to be the leader. Haven&#39;t heard from you<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; guys in awhile, email me directly and let me know when we can meet up in<br/>\n&gt; game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As to getting the guild set up on the remaining servers. Apparently, the<br/>\n&gt; GM&#39;s are not really checking to see who the guild leaders of record are<br/>\n&gt; before they set the guild up. So, if you have volunteered to be the guild<br/>\n&gt; leader on another server, go ahead and petition to see if you can get them<br/>\n&gt; to guild you. Just make sure you use the name &quot;Mystic Alliance&quot;. Then let<br/>\n&gt; everyone on the list know what you&#39;ve done and how they can get into the<br/>\n&gt; guild.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; thanks and hugs to all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dedric, gnome necro, lvl 21 on Brell<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
