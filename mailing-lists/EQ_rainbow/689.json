They also allowed heals & binds, but I <br/>\npersonally think this would detract from the fun & the point of my <br/>\noriginal idea -- to see how far we could make it with nothing. Oh, if <br/>\nanyone missed it -- the idea is for a bunch of newbies (either a real <br/>\nchar., or 1 started just for the contest) to run nekkid from, say, <br/>\nKelethin to Cabilis (or another equally suicidal destination) with no <br/>\nheals, buffs, binds, or SoWs -- just whatever rusty weapon you&#39;re <br/>\nwilling to lose & offensive magic for the casters. Get as far as we <br/>\ncan, die young, & leave a beautiful corpse to decay in a far away <br/>\nland! Maybe we could get together some prizes for the Ultimate <br/>\nSurvivor, Most Spectacular Death, etc. So, if anyone else is <br/>\ninterested, post a reply here or on the mail group!<br/>\n<br/>\nSnapdragyn (Todd)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
