I found <br/>\nyour listing through one of the other EQ message boards.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been seriously thinking of relocating servers to join many of <br/>\nyou on the Rodcet Nife server.  Currently i have several low level <br/>\ncharacters on the Mithaniel Marr server, so if any of you are on that <br/>\nserver please give me an in-game tell or email me (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdincinci@...\">jdincinci@...</a>).<br/>\n<br/>\nA little about me:<br/>\n<br/>\n* James Dillon<br/>\n* 28<br/>\n* I live in Cincinnati, OH and work for an advertising agency as <br/>\ntheir Information Systems person, i.e. Nick Burns (for all of you <br/>\nSaturday Night Live fans).<br/>\n<br/>\nPrimary Character (right now):  Renette 10 Wood Elf Druid<br/>\n<br/>\nI have several other characters, but Renette is the one i&#39;ve been <br/>\nplaying most lately.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost Hated EQ Monster:  The Kerran High Guard.  My first character <br/>\nwas an Erudite Magician and i was one of the rare people that <br/>\nactually hunted in Tox Forest and Kerra Isle.  That Kerran High Guard <br/>\nmust have killed me 50 times before i decided to take my first boat <br/>\nride to Qeynos.<br/>\n<br/>\nFavorite EQ Monster:  Spectre (Only because they are neat looking)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell i will stop there.  I will probably create a character on Rodcet <br/>\nNife now just so i can have a fun group to chat with.  Do you have <br/>\nany low level characters in your guild (Mystic Alliance)?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I am glad to have found this group and other gay people that <br/>\nlike playing EQ...I knew you were out there!<br/>\n<br/>\nJames</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
