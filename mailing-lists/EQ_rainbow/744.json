I<br/>\n&gt;                       owe my choice of career to one (and he helped put me<br/>\n&gt; thru college) and my choice of hobbies to<br/>\n&gt;                       the other.   And I knew and accepted thier relat. in<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; way I think only young children do - it simply<br/>\n&gt;                       always was.   They were my family .. and the only<br/>\n&gt; stable, kind, loving non-abusive males in my<br/>\n&gt;                       life as a child.
