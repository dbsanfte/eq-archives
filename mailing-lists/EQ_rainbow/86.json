I&#39;ve played muds for years and have been playing everquest since beta.  I&#39;m looking forward to playing with a &quot;gay&quot; group.  It would be nice to have people to chat with who enjoy the same things and are like me.  Let&#39;s see, I&#39;m 30 years old, married (to a woman).  We&#39;ve been together a little over a year now.  She plays in EQ as well.  I hope to see you all online.  I started a dwarf paladin in these server that was mentioned in prior posts, her name is Zoltarena.  I also have a lv 9 druid in Tunare.  Her name is Miile.  Look me up!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
