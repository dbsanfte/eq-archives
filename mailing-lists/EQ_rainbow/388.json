On many of the servers, I do not have a character yet,<br/>\nso the easiest thing is for me to create a new character in a starting city<br/>\nthis is convenient to where you are located. So, send me the following<br/>\ninformation:<br/>\n<br/>\nName of guild leader character:  Sharada<br/>\nNearest starting city:  Felwithe/GFay<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we need to be online at the same time, David, let me know and we can set it<br/>\nup.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, re: the Rainbow Festival, most anytime on Saturday the 28th will work<br/>\nfor me. My preference is probably a.m. to early afternoon, but will make a<br/>\npoint on being there in Freeport at the appointed place and time. Not sure<br/>\nwhich character will be there yet, but most likely Ananda, Cleric of Brell.<br/>\nLooking forward to getting together with you all! Haven&#39;t been on Brell for a<br/>\ncouple of weeks because I&#39;ve been playing my Erollisi chars. &lt;grin&gt; The newbie<br/>\nand lower level areas are not nearly as crowded now...<br/>\n<br/>\nSee you all on Saturday!<br/>\n<br/>\nChristine<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
