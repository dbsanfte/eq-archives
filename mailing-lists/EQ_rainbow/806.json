A friend was creating a new eq list (there s only about 480 at the moment, heh) today and while I was scanning through them I found this one. My first","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-947554307\">Hi all.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend was creating a new eq list (there&#39;s only about 480 at the <br/>\nmoment, heh) today and while I was scanning through them I found this <br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first thought was, &quot;Joy! Rapture!&quot; and I quickly subbed.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little bit about myself:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m 26?  Argh, where&#39;s my ginkobiloba? My birthday is later this <br/>\nmonth, so I&#39;ll let you know definitely as soon as my grandmother <br/>\ncalls.  Although I&#39;m sure it&#39;s getting hard to find those little <br/>\nteddy-bear cards with the wheels with the ages written on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nI live in Atlanta with Ye Olde Hubby.  I am a technician for <br/>\nHealtheon/WebMD and I get to talk to dental receptionists all day. (I <br/>\ncan sense your jealousy).  It&#39;s not a bad gig - I&#39;ve even installed <br/>\nEQ here but our network is a joke, so..<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth my hubby Chillos (it&#39;s a family name of Greek origin or so we <br/>\nbelieve) and I play on The Rathe server.  I have a 28th lvl half-elf <br/>\nRanger and a 16th lvl Dark Elf necromancer.  We both belong to a <br/>\nguild of really good people (well, mostly good) that a friend (who is <br/>\ngay as well) introduced us to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve played EQ since Phase IV beta, been a guide for about 4 months <br/>\non Veeshan (aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!) and have successfully <br/>\nrecovered from burn-out (which is why my ranger is only 28).  Other <br/>\ngames I have played include Meridian59 (server 107) for three years <br/>\n(off-and-on) and Ultima Online, although hubby has a LOT more <br/>\nexperiences in UO than I do.. I mostly just ran (if you could call <br/>\nrunning with that lag running) from everyone, believing they were all <br/>\nPKers.<br/>\n<br/>\nUmmm.. what else?  Should you want to know more about us, surf on <br/>\nover to our website at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://people.atl.mediaone.net/chillicub/\">http://people.atl.mediaone.net/chillicub/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and it&#39;s safe to surf while you&#39;re at work.. (nudge nudge, wink <br/>\nwink)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read the past 20 posts or so.. am I correct in piecing together <br/>\nthat there is a gay guild on Rodcet-Nife?  and or Nameless?  As much <br/>\nas I dearly love our guild on Rathe I would really love to join a gay <br/>\nguild.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess that&#39;s about it (aren&#39;t you glad?)-<br/>\nEric<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, for anyone who&#39;s interested, the guild we belong to (I&#39;m outing <br/>\nmyself here) is Silver Blade ... my characters are Zacharus <br/>\nAnam&#39;Matghamuin and Lucentio Duarte (mostly Lucentio)... Chillos is <br/>\nBeja or Chillos (mostly Beja)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
