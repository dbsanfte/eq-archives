My new<br/>\nHigh Elf Cleric, Kythwin began his existence in that hellhole of a zone<br/>\nknown as the Greater Faydark (dark, no loot, too many people and all<br/>\nthat infernal shouting!). After a couple of hours, I had him up to 3rd<br/>\nlevel and it was off to Freeport, a place I find much more congenial. I<br/>\nguess you could say that Kyth is like most gay men, began life in<br/>\nsomeplace dim and depressing but took off at the first opportunity for<br/>\nthe big bright city!! Now I hope to make contact with someone from<br/>\nMystic Alliance and join up as soon as possible...I will be keeping my<br/>\neyes open as I bash those ugly orcs over the head and hope to see<br/>\nsomeone soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nVince<br/>\nKythwin, Cleric of the Tunare, 3rd Circle</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
