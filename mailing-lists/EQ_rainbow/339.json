They<br/>\n&gt;never did.  Drelzna spawned during that time, she just didn&#39;t have the<br/>\n&gt;boots.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There&#39;s no anti-camp code there, though.  The place is camped on Tunare <br/>\n&gt;24/7<br/>\n&gt;and people come away with boots.  A friend of mine went there and got them<br/>\n&gt;on the first spawn (the wench! ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think I just have horrible luck with spawns like this.  The same thing<br/>\n&gt;happened for the BBC =P </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
