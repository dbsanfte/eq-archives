Our efforts at a<br/>\n&gt; replacement name were humorous if not productive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I had an idea for using a latin name for the guild.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gloriae et Liberatatae<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &#39;Gloriae&#39; means fame, renown, glory; glorius deeds.<br/>\n&gt; &#39;et&#39; means and<br/>\n&gt; Liberatatae means freedoms, liberty, independence.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The initials would be GL (same as the initials for gay and lesbian. Also,<br/>\n&gt; the B and the T in liberatatae could represent bisexual and transgender. I<br/>\n&gt; just like the idea of having a hidden meaning, but one that we recognize and<br/>\n&gt; remember as we think about the diversity of our own group. Kind of like the<br/>\n&gt; meaning of each color of the rainbow flag.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The guild&#39;s name would also represent our own desires for personal and guild<br/>\n&gt; glory. And the desire we have to be free and to make sure others are free<br/>\n&gt; too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Other names based in latin:<br/>\n&gt; Pedes Genialis<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; pedes - foot soldier<br/>\n&gt; genialis - relating to enjoyment; joyful, gay.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pedes Liberti (soldiers of freedom)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know these sound militaristic, but after all, we do carry weapons and kill<br/>\n&gt; things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Societas De Sapho - Association Of Sapho<br/>\n&gt; Societas De Genialis - Association of Enjoyment (joyful, gay)<br/>\n&gt; Societas De Liberti - Association of Freedom<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I kind of like the idea of using something Latin, but at the same time I<br/>\n&gt; want something that sounds good. Don&#39;t know if any of the above fit that.<br/>\n&gt; What do you all think?????<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
