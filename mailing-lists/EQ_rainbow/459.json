David, if you are on today, could<br/>\nyou list the servers that you have already visited and got the guild<br/>\nstarted on? And if it&#39;s possible, can I help in any way with getting the<br/>\nguild on other servers? I&#39;ve actually been on E&#39;ci when Kyala has..talked<br/>\nwith her, etc. so I think Ive built a report with her.<br/>\n     For those of you on Rodect, I started a Barbarian Warrior on there the<br/>\nother night...he&#39;s 4th level now ( I did this in less than an hour..power<br/>\nleveling ROCKS!). His name is Synder. I think with a little...boosting..I<br/>\ncan go up 3 to 4 levels each night...just need a CORP of CLERICS behind me!<br/>\nLOL!<br/>\n     For those of you on E&#39;ci, look me up! Jadeeyes is me. Im KOS in<br/>\nFreeport, so I make sure to hang out near there...I love danger!<br/>\nOh, something to remember...if you travel a long way to somewhere, ALWAYS<br/>\ntry to remember to get a BIND at where you traveled to.<br/>\nExample:<br/>\n<br/>\n     I traveled from Wood Elf City to Freeport one LATE night to buy a<br/>\nBarbed Whip from a guild mate, Bazul, for 100pp. I got there..got the<br/>\nwhip..logged off..then fell asleep on the couch. When I was playing last<br/>\nnight, I had FORGOT that I was not binded there and proceeded to whack the<br/>\nmeanies in Oasis. BARELY survived a spell casting madman when I was whacked<br/>\non the head by a Deep Water Goblin. It was then that a cold chill<br/>\nsurrounded my heart...I was STILL BOUND in Wood Elf City. SURE learnt MY<br/>\nLESSON!<br/>\n<br/>\n     Oh, just to mention, I am now Guildless. No, I wasnt kicked out or did<br/>\nI remove myself. My guild was vaporized because some of the members were<br/>\nKill Stealing, making nasty remarks to the GMs and the GUILD Leader couldnt<br/>\nstop them...so POOF! GONE! Even though it saddens me greatly, I am NOW in<br/>\npossition to assist FULLY with getting our guild up and going on E&#39;ci once<br/>\nwe untangle things there.<br/>\n     Again, if I can do or say something as proxy for you David on E&#39;ci,<br/>\nlet me know! &lt;smile&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy (Jaded warrior of E&#39;ci and candy bar lover!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
