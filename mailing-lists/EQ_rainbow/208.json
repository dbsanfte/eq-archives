As far as names for the women in the history, there&#39;s a couple I<br/>\nhave in mind, but need to look up tonight before posting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn reading your message, Christina, another name came to mind &lt;as she<br/>\ncautiously tosses it into the fray&gt;: Mystic Alliance<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the GLBT-related names have pretty much been dropped in discussion by<br/>\nmost people. This name is role-play appropriate, it is somewhat mysterious and<br/>\nthe alliance part is what we are about. There is nothing good/evil impliant in<br/>\nthe name, nor any specific class or race.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough the GLBT link may not be apparent in any name chosen, it is easy<br/>\nenough to add symbolism to any graphics/logo associated with a guild site.<br/>\nGranted, it wouldn&#39;t be visually attached to our names in the game, but if<br/>\npeople want to know, they&#39;ll ask or look for a website for information.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as publicity for the guild once things are a bit settled, PlanetOut<br/>\nmight be a great online zine to contact. Their turnaround time for getting<br/>\ninformation out is much quicker than the print media. I think they may also<br/>\nhave links to GLBT websites, which would be great when we have one for the<br/>\nguild. I can&#39;t recall if there is a gay-related news service bureau. Some<br/>\nindividuals were trying to create one a while ago. The BBC is very queer<br/>\nfriendly and could be interested in a story, especially if we wish to reach<br/>\nour brothers and sisters in the EU. Wired may also be a good place to reach<br/>\nGLBT gamers and they have their email newsletters as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoyed chatting with you all in the guild formation last night. This is the<br/>\nstart of something really great.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristine<br/>\nAnanda, cleric of Brell Serilis on Brell<br/>\nMirri, druid of Tunare on Brell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDate:       Thu, 29 Jul 99 12:52PM MST <br/>\nFrom:      Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo:         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_rainbow@onelist.com\">EQ_rainbow@onelist.com</a> <br/>\nSubject: <br/>\nRe: [EQ_rainbow] Guild Operational Details and Backstory <br/>\n   More Details <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   From: Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m fine with this story. I don&#39;t see the need for us to be outcasts <br/>\nthough. I personally prefer to assume that Norathian culture is generally <br/>\naccepting of diverse sexual orientation, and that players who express <br/>\notherwise are members of some strange minority. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I would like to see in terms of roleplay is that GLBT and <br/>\npositive people share a kind of bond that is manifests itself as a <br/>\ntangible spiritual connection. Something along the lines of us all coming <br/>\ntogether because we had this connection, and could sense it in eachother. <br/>\nKind of a mystic gaydar 8) I like it because this implies a reason for us <br/>\nto exist in an organization beyond combating homophobia (which implies <br/>\nhomophobia is a force requiring an organization to combat). <br/>\n<br/>\n   - Christina <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">    On Thu, 29 Jul 1999, David Lari wrote: <br/>\n   &gt; From: David Lari &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kerik@...\">kerik@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n   &gt; My ideas for our charter and lower down the &#39;back story&#39; thing I promised<br/>\n<br/>\n   &gt; yesterday. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
