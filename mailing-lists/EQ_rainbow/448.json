No mention of this phenomenon was<br/>\n included in the product brochure.  In addition, Wife 1.0 installs itself<br/>\n into all other programs and launches during system initialization, where<br/>\n it monitors all other system activity.  Applications such as Poker night<br/>\n 10.3, Drunken Boys Night 2.5<br/>\n and Saturday Football 5.0 no longer runs, crashing the system whenever<br/>\n selected.  I cannot seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while<br/>\n attempting to run some of my &gt; other favorite applications.  I am<br/>\n thinking about going back to &gt; Girlfriend 7.0, but un-install does not<br/>\n work onthis program.<br/>\n <br/>\n        Can you help me, please!!!<br/>\n        Thanks, Joe<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Red<br/>\nYou might want to check the web and try and find the program Devorce 4.0. <br/>\nThen Dont reinstall Girlfriend 7.0. Load BoyFriend 10.0 :-)...you will live a <br/>\nmuch happer life. &lt;EG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWampir</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
