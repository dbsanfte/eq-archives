Hopefully not.

It<br/>\nmay be primitive, but it is virtual reality, and to anyone who&#39;s ever had<br/>\nsomeone tap them on the shoulder because they&#39;ve been talking to you for<br/>\nfive minutes and you haven&#39;t heard a damned thing knows, it&#39;s immersive<br/>\nvirtual reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople naturally try and relate to their virtual reality experience like<br/>\nthey would to their real life experience.  This doesn&#39;t mean they take<br/>\neverything as seriously (otherwise death would reallly suck) but they will<br/>\nnaturally impose real life qualities in terms of how them form<br/>\nrelationships and socialize online.  These natural social tendancies may<br/>\nbe modified by concious choice, but at the root they are all there.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople are used to classifying another person&#39;s gender.  You don&#39;t walk up<br/>\nto someone on the street (usually) and say &quot;you look like a boy, you act<br/>\nlike a boy, are you a boy?&quot; We&#39;re expected to recognize these qualities,<br/>\nclassify the person as a boy, and then relate to them as a boy.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople do this same thing naturally in EQ, though not to as an extreme.<br/>\nFor example:<br/>\n    - You see a male character, you assume this is a male player, you&#39;d<br/>\n      probably need to be told outright by the person they were female<br/>\n      to believe otherwise.<br/>\n    - You see a female character, things are more complicated:<br/>\n        - Most people will not try and classify her gender directly I<br/>\n          think.  They&#39;ll be aware that most female EQ characters are<br/>\n          played by males.  This introduces gender confusion.  They don&#39;t<br/>\n          know how to really deal with a person with a female body but<br/>\n          a male mind so they&#39;ll basicly treat the person like a female<br/>\n          on the surface, but probably not commit to their gender.<br/>\n        - If that female character exhibits behavioral characteristics<br/>\n          that seem female it is very comfortable to allow your gender<br/>\n          &#39;no commitment&#39; stance to slip into &#39;this person is a female<br/>\n          in real life&#39;.<br/>\n        - Likewise if this character exhibits male characteristics, <br/>\n          the person may slip into the assumption the player is male.<br/>\n          All this avoids the need to ask the person what their gender is.<br/>\n        - FLIRTING OF ANY KIND is assumed to indicate gender under the<br/>\n          assumption the player is heterosexual.<br/>\n        - Some people are aware enough of the complexity of online gender,<br/>\n          and care enough about real life gender, to skip all this and ask<br/>\n          (usually to confirm their assumptions)<br/>\n<br/>\nQueer people get screwed by this in many ways.  Lots of people who<br/>\nprobably wouldn&#39;t ID as queer also get screwed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above rules are arbitrary, and dumb! They are the rules most people go<br/>\nby.  If a person decides on your real life gender by these rules, even<br/>\nworse if a group of people decide on your gender, their is the fundamental<br/>\nassumption that you actively deceived them.  Lets not pull punches,<br/>\neveryone who decides your gender, when you reveal you are of the other<br/>\ngender, will basicly have their entire gender model of you flipped upside<br/>\ndown.  This will create confusion, and potentially hostility.  Of course<br/>\nanyone who is not a jerk should realize that their assumptions were wrong,<br/>\nbut most people are jerks about gender.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what can you do to protect yourself in this environment?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can be up front about your real-life gender.  This will however to<br/>\nsome degree prevent you from getting into intense gender interaction with<br/>\npeople as a member of your online perceived gender.  Playing a person of<br/>\nthe opposite gender in EQ is a great way to explore gender in a fun<br/>\nenvironment.  Exploring gender is fun and good.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can be passive about your gender.  This is what our list boys have<br/>\ndone.  They let people assume their genders as females, since they didn&#39;t<br/>\nactively in this way deceive anyone.  I think this is perfectly 100% ok.<br/>\nNow however they&#39;re getting screwed over by the realization that they can<br/>\nno longer safely come out without alienating some of their friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can lie outright about your gender.  I think this is perfectly ok as<br/>\nwell.  Why? Because you&#39;re not hurting anyone.  Really the gender / sexual<br/>\norientation hangups of other people is not our problem.  Really, our<br/>\ngender in real life is irrelevant to the game of Everquest.  People<br/>\ndemand to know real life gender because they have hangups about online /<br/>\nreal life gender continuity.  Tough luck! It&#39;s not your responsibility to<br/>\nsupport their environment where they have this kind of knowledge.  You<br/>\nnever aksed to be part of that environment.  You can also say &quot;I won&#39;t<br/>\nanswer that question&quot; but people will eventually assume you&#39;re not of your<br/>\nperceived gender, and they&#39;ll mistrust you.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople don&#39;t like to lie.  They like to be honest, especially with people<br/>\nthey have good social relationships with.  I think it&#39;s important to<br/>\nrealize that an relationship in an online virtual reality is not like a<br/>\nreal life social relationship.  Unless you are going to have some kind of<br/>\nreal life social relationship with someone online, I think it&#39;s perfectly<br/>\nreasonable to lie about your gender, your sexual orientation, anything if<br/>\nit creates an environment you&#39;re more comfortable with.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are the queer gender-exploring fringe, moving into an online virtual<br/>\nenvironment.  The straight heterosexist establishment is imposing on VR<br/>\nit&#39;s own moral code, but I feel no need to participate in it.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members? <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nTry ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
