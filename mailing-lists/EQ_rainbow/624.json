And I already made my shaman. (and a necro<br/>\n&gt;and a monk) The shaman without spells survived much much better killing the<br/>\n&gt;same type of critter then the monk. The necro, well we won&#39;t talk about <br/>\n&gt;that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Roumor I heard about the lizzy monk is that instead of dragon punch at 20<br/>\n&gt;or 25 or whatever, they get tail sweep. ;-p I wanna see that!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;B<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 09:29 AM 4/25/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok, this might just be a rant, but since it&#39;s non hostile I&#39;m going to post<br/>\n&gt;it here =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;WOW Iksar are so cute. The first time I ever saw one I was like...oh my<br/>\n&gt;gosh! It walks around and swings its little tail and talks and everything!<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s like the best pet!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And Kunark is very pretty. Lots of fun new zones, with cool looking<br/>\n&gt;critters. It&#39;s pretty obvious to me you could hunt in Kunark and never<br/>\n&gt;leave, and get all the way to 50. It seems a self sufficient continent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kunark is dangerous though, I have talked to a lot of people who brought<br/>\n&gt;their mains over and got stomped by something.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The solution to all this is...make an Iksar shaman! You get SOW at 9th<br/>\n&gt;level and you can explore like crazy. Team up with a friend and make an<br/>\n&gt;Iksar monk, and you have a great 2-person leveling/exploring team<br/>\n&gt;especially for low levels. FYI Iksar have regeneration, and the highest wis<br/>\n&gt;of the shaman races, making them the best shaman and monk races IMHO<br/>\n&gt;(though they aren&#39;t as cute as Duna).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(Rumor: Iksar do not get the inherent haste that human monks get at level<br/>\n&gt;20+)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3587/7/_/552123/_/956676579/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3587/7/_/552123/_/956676579/</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
