On many of the servers, I do not have a character yet, so the easiest<br/>\nthing is for me to create a new character in a starting city this is convenient<br/>\nto where you are located. So, send me the following information:<br/>\n<br/>\nName of guild leader character:<br/>\nNearest starting city:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order for me to make you guild leader, I have to be in the same zone as you.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think we even have to be logged on at the same time, but I am not sure.<br/>\nVerant has changed the way guilds are set up by the GM&#39;s. I am under the<br/>\nunderstanding that I can petition a GM any time during regular customer service<br/>\nhours. So, as I receive the above info from you, I will begin getting this done.<br/>\nAfter you give me the information, you may wish to &#39;park&#39; your character in this<br/>\ncity so I can go ahead and assign you as the leader.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope to begin working on our web site soon. I will keep you posted.<br/>\n<br/>\nRAINBOW FESTIVAL<br/>\nAlso, Christina (who has been leveling her Luna character quite nicely I might<br/>\nadd) suggested that we have some sort of guild meeting in Norrath on one of the<br/>\nservers. A chance to get together and chat. I am working on finding a time for<br/>\nthis and will let you know. It will probably be this Saturday, the 28th. We will<br/>\nmeet on Brell Serilis and probably in the Freeport area as it is centrally<br/>\nlocated. If you don&#39;t have a character on Brell, you can just create a newbie<br/>\ncharacter so you can meet with everyone. If you have a character, but need help<br/>\ntraveling, let me know and we can arrange escorts beforehand.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the get together, those who want to can do some hunting together. We can<br/>\nbreak up into hunting groups based on levels. I will provide binds and corpse<br/>\nlocating for anyone who needs it. Also, I may have some mino axes for some<br/>\nhunters to borrow (but I will need them back after the hunt. Gotta get money to<br/>\nbuy my spells :) It might be fun to see a bunch of level 1 melee types with mino<br/>\naxes, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else have any ideas for other fun things we can do during our festival,<br/>\nplease post to the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\nDedric, gnome necromancer (12 level)<br/>\nGuild Leader, Mystical Alliance,<br/>\nBrell Serilis Chapter</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
