I&#39;m a<br/>\nnice, normal, gay guy who plays a few characters on the Innorruk server (seems<br/>\nlike everyone else is on other servers). Personally I&#39;ve never had my sexual<br/>\npreference come into play in the game (and not being much of a roleplayer<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it would). I live out in the Philadelphia burbs, late 20something<br/>\nand work with computer systems and networks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope everyone enjoys the game and if you ever pop onto Innorruk feel free to<br/>\nsay hi.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohnathan Spectre<br/>\nJSpectre (13th necro Innorruk)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
