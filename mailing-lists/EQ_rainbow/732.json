Now we have both <br/>\nplayed EQ for a long while and have had chars on various other <br/>\nservers prior to Luclin.... yada yada, I&#39;m babbling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, we have only just started fresh on Terris and Lora mentioned <br/>\nthat there are people currently moving to Rodcet Nife starting again <br/>\nalso. This has me curious and we are considering it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically I just wanted the name of the guild there and a contact I <br/>\ncould get in touch with to have a chat with about it all. I&#39;d <br/>\nappreciate someone to show us around so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can be reached on <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:swin@...\">swin@...</a> if anyone feels the urge <br/>\nto send me some details. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance<br/>\nHugs and kisses<br/>\nSwin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_rainbow@egroups.com\">EQ_rainbow@egroups.com</a>, &quot;David Lari&quot; &lt;kerik@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Not sure if it was mentioned on EQ_Rainbow, but last night we had a <br/>\nbig<br/>\n&gt; Mystic Alliance guild event on Rodcet Nife. It was called MegaPlat <br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; consisted of a lottery (the grand prize was 665 plat) and raffles <br/>\nof various<br/>\n&gt; items (armor, jewelry, weapons, etc.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We had around 20 guild members on at the same time and that set a <br/>\nrecord for<br/>\n&gt; us, I believe. A lot of people have been moving over to the Rodcet <br/>\nserver<br/>\n&gt; and this event was a great way for them to get some nice equipment.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Joe and Rob did a great job of coordinating and running the event. <br/>\nThanks<br/>\n&gt; guys.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If anyone else wants to create characters on Rodcet, we invite you <br/>\nto come<br/>\n&gt; join us.
