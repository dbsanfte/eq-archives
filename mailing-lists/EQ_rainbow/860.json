That plust a general disgust with server politics and a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; new job caused me to quit cold turky.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have a close friend who switched to one of the new servers Tholue Paelis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (probably mispelled). I decided I would go play a newbie druid on there,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I hunted up to level 16 or so. My friend is actually in an uber-guild<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of sorts on the server, which of course conjures up all sorts of negative<br/>\n&gt; &gt; imagery. He put me in the guild just so I could listen to guildsay and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s been an interesting listen to say the least, very teen boy.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; After playing a druid for a little while I started to realllllly miss my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enchanter from Brell (54th level). My friend offered to lend me a level 52<br/>\n&gt; &gt; druid to power level myself. Despite warning bells going off in my head, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; figured, what the heck!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So I started power leveling my brand new first level enchanter, which is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an interesting experience to say the least. For those of you who aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; familiar, high level druid power level characters by buffing them, putting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a damage shield on them, and chloroplast. With this a 1st level character<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can kill a 12th level mob. It took me about 3 hours to get to 16th level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this way. I continued to tank up to about 30th level at which point it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stopped being effective. From that point on I&#39;ve done kiting using memory<br/>\n&gt; &gt; blur to allow the druid to do all the damage, but allowing my enchanter to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then take the kill. I&#39;m 39th level now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now, all of this is not really playing EQ in the sense I normally have.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s been kind of fun though simply because I haven&#39;t done anything like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this before. My goal now is to get 46th level so I can hunt with my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friend&#39;s guild, as they go about killing dragons, and Venril Sathir, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other such &quot;uber mobs&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But, it all feels very cold in a way, I don&#39;t really know anyone on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; server, and the people in the guild don&#39;t seem like people I&#39;ll really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like (except for my friend). I wonder sometimes if after I officially join<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the guild, if I will end up quitting the server a couple days later =) It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could happen.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve gone back to my old server to visit and that&#39;s nice, I always run<br/>\n&gt; &gt; into some old friends who say hi and chat with me. There are people I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; still care about on that old server. But, it seems like I have a barrier<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that prevents me from playing there. I just know if I play there that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; server politics will rear its ugly head again.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So for now I will power level my little enchanter on Tholuxe, and see what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s like playing there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Christina<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
