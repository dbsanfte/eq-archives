At approximatly<br/>\n&gt; 10:30PM, EDT, 9/8/99, my boyfriend and I were victims of anti-gay<br/>\nharassment<br/>\n&gt; on Rodcet Nife.  This is not the first time I have dealt with this<br/>\nsituation<br/>\n&gt; here on Everquest, but I was usually able to resolve the problem on a<br/>\n&gt; personal level with the person who was behaving in an<br/>\nintimidating/harassing<br/>\n&gt; manner. However, that did not work in this case.  I was grouped with a<br/>\n&gt; charachter named &quot;Soorn&quot;, and my boyfriend &quot;Genesius,&quot; we had been playing<br/>\n&gt; for about 15-20min, and then went with Soorn to meet a friend, &quot;Odiny,&quot;<br/>\nwho<br/>\n&gt; then used words such as fag, and homo to describe his friend Soorn.  I<br/>\n&gt; personally sent a &quot;/tell&quot; to Odiny and asked him not to use such offensive<br/>\n&gt; words, as both Genesius and I were gay.  That did not produce a postive<br/>\n&gt; result, but I let it drop.  Sometime later I told Soorn that his friend<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; using &quot;bad words,&quot; and he asked me what they were.  After I told him that<br/>\n&gt; fag, and homo were the &quot;bad words&quot; I was talking about, and that Genesius<br/>\n&gt; and I were gay, he immediatly left the group.  He then sent an &quot;/ooc&quot; that<br/>\n&gt; indicated that Genesius and I were &quot;real-life homos&quot; and implied that<br/>\npeople<br/>\n&gt; on Everquest should be afraid of us.  I calmly asked Soorn with a &quot;/tell,&quot;<br/>\n&gt; why he was being mean, and he simply replied by calling me a &quot;fucking<br/>\n&gt; faggot&quot;.  I am not entirely sure of the exact phrasing of these remarks<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; I do have screenshots available, and I also used the &quot;/report&quot; command.<br/>\nAs<br/>\n&gt; a result of the public remarks made by Soorn I felt the need to publicly<br/>\n&gt; rectify the situation.  I sent a brief &quot;/ooc&quot; that said that I was sad<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; Soorn was being mean to Genesius and I as gay people.  Soorn&#39;s remarks<br/>\nbegan<br/>\n&gt; a cascade of similar ill-intentioned, thought not necessarily harassing,<br/>\n&gt; public remarks (which I also have in screenshots of , but may not have<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n&gt; included in the &quot;/report&quot;).  As I said before I have usually dealt with<br/>\n&gt; these situations on a personal level, but in this case I was not given<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; opportunity.  It was a very upsetting experience to seemingly have all of<br/>\n&gt; the poeple in the zone hate me and my boyfriend because we were gay.  I<br/>\n&gt; believe that Soorn&#39;s actions were a serious violation of the terms of<br/>\n&gt; conduct in Everquest, as well as the most striking example of<br/>\nheterosexism,<br/>\n&gt; homophobia, and intolernace I have seen on Everquest in the many months<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; I have been using this service.  Additionally, GM&#39;s in-game were not<br/>\n&gt; helpfull at all in this case, even though I had sent a &quot;/report.&quot;  I<br/>\nexpect<br/>\n&gt; a non-automated reply to this e-mail outlining your policy in this case,<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; well as an update on the progress of any investigation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sincerely and with saddness,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Joseph J.
