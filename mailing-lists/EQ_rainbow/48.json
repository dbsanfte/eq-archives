Anyway, I think the guild would be a great idea. It seems like we have a few people on the Rodcet Nife server, but many of us are spread all over different servers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Perhaps we should consider David&#39;s idea of setting up this &quot;GLBT&quot; guild on the new roleplaying server, Brell Serilis. We could all start from scratch and learn about each other in a group of the same level. Sirenia is a Level 24 High Elven Cleric, but I would be willing to give it all up to start again with all of you if you are interested. Then I am certain we would have enough members to form a guild there.
