Charter: The Guild","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1295970650\">My ideas for our charter and lower down the &#39;back story&#39; thing I promised<br/>\nyesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nShare your thoughts, ideas, and criticisms. Thanks.<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\nCharter:<br/>\nThe Guild is open to citizens of Norath, regardless of race, class, sex,<br/>\nreligion and sexual orientation. All Guild members must show respect to others<br/>\nwhether they are in the Guild or not. No homophobes will be allowed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of the Guild is:<br/>\no  to use our resources for mutual benefit<br/>\no  to adventure together in an atmosphere where we are not subjected to<br/>\nhomophobic comments<br/>\no  to enhance the enjoyment of life in Norath for all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above part of the charter is universal to all servers on which our guild<br/>\nmay have members.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Brell Serilis and other role playing servers, our charter is additionally:<br/>\no  to encourage RPing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does all of the above sound????<br/>\n<br/>\nDo we want some other common goal? Would we all one day like to have a guild<br/>\nstrong enough to slay a dragon? Is there some other universal goal we could<br/>\nall agree on that might be a theme for our guild and that might therefore<br/>\nsuggest a name? Like the dragon thing. I&#39;d like to be part of a group that got<br/>\none, you know... Wouldn&#39;t we all one day?<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, I said I&#39;d post a back story for our guild. I have not until now<br/>\nbecause I thought about totally rewriting it, but then I decided I&#39;ll just<br/>\npost it and let someone else totally rewrite it. It is below. The first person<br/>\nwho wants to take a crack at a rewrite, just tell us on the list and then<br/>\nwe&#39;ll wait for you to post your version and then the next person can.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome guidelines. I&#39;d like the backstory to include a prominent male and female<br/>\nhero and heroine. You may include as much Norathian lore as you desire. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know much yet and haven&#39;t put much in. Feel free to include more of<br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, someone either edit what I have or throw it out and start over. I cranked<br/>\nthis puppy out in about 5 minutes, so I won&#39;t be offended at all if the whole<br/>\nthing is pitched, but maybe it can be a starting point or at least get the<br/>\nimagination working.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere it is:<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric Elgen Baknor was a disciple of The Queen of Love. After learning all<br/>\nabout the love that Erollisi Marr espoused, he decided to leave the Temple of<br/>\nMarr because he wanted to experience that love.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving entered the priesthood because he could not see himself falling in love<br/>\nwith a woman, he eventually met and fell in love with a man whose identity is<br/>\nshrouded in mystery. It is believed he may have been a man who held high rank<br/>\nin the Temple. Eventually though, Elgen would realize the relationship would<br/>\nnot work for he was unable to openly express his love for this mysterious man.<br/>\n<br/>\nElgen had heard of a woman who was a mighty warrior in Faydwer who loved other<br/>\nwomen in the same way he loved men. He set out to find her.<br/>\n<br/>\nElgen left the city of Freeport and ventured to Faydwer. On his journey, he<br/>\npicked up many friends who believed, just as Elgen, that love was the answer,<br/>\nregardless of gender. He asked each of his friends if they had heard of this<br/>\nwoman whose heart belonged to another woman. But none had.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, one day the group came upon two women at a campsite normally<br/>\ninhabited by numerous Orcs, but on this day, no Orcs were to be seen. Suddenly<br/>\nthough, an Orc sprang out of nowhere. Fearing for their lives Elgen&#39;s group<br/>\nbegan to run. But in the corner of his eye, Elgen saw one of the two women<br/>\npull out a long sword and strike down the Orc in a matter of seconds, while<br/>\nthe other woman, continued to sit undisturbed in silent meditation. This<br/>\nsupreme warrior introduced herself and her lover to the small group. [Need a<br/>\nname for her and her lover]<br/>\n<br/>\nThis small band of cast out souls formed their own community, a small camp in<br/>\nthe recesses of Lesser Faydark. Together, these men and women took the best<br/>\nideals of Erollisi Marr and combined them with their own beliefs. Their small<br/>\nsect, comprised originally of only followers of Erollisi Marr, eventually<br/>\nbegan to attract followers of other deities, even the Plaguebringer. For no<br/>\nmatter their race or class, spread throughout the lands of Norath were people<br/>\nwho believed that love did not have to be restricted to only the opposite<br/>\ngender. This one belief united them despite all their other diversity and they<br/>\nwould eventually become known as &#39;[guild name goes here]&#39;.<br/>\n----------------<br/>\nSo, there&#39;s my cheesy attempt at a back story. Who wants to to take a crack at<br/>\nit. You can&#39;t make it any worse than it is, so someone give it a try.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\nDavid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
