I have a story to relate to you all that may<br/>\n&gt; be strange and it may make you think. It may make you think about how you<br/>\n&gt; see and view yourself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      In 1995, January, I was getting ready for my vacation in England. I<br/>\n&gt; had never been over seas before so I had to get my Passport. I&#39;m SURE you<br/>\n&gt; all remember the January, etc. where the Govt. kept shutting down due to<br/>\n&gt; money matters. Well, here&#39;s the story. To get a Passport, I had to cough up<br/>\n&gt; my birth certificate. This was a little bit of a problem because I was<br/>\n&gt; adopted when I was merely a few weeks old and my mother had never gotten a<br/>\n&gt; birth certificate (Im 34 and live in Tennessee..the state where all I had<br/>\n&gt; to do to get a Social Security Card was to produce the &#39;FAMILY&#39; Bible in<br/>\n&gt; which my name and birth date were scrolled). Ok, I thought, no problem, I<br/>\n&gt; will just contact NASHVILLE (Our state capital) and get them to send me a<br/>\n&gt; copy of the record. After not hearing from them for a week, I decided to<br/>\n&gt; call. They could not find the record and asked if I have ever gone by any<br/>\n&gt; other name. I told them  that I was adopted at a VERY early age but my<br/>\n&gt; birth name had originally been Johnathan Stephen Graves. She thanked ma and<br/>\n&gt; the search was on. In a few days I received an envelope via post with a<br/>\n&gt; Birht Certificate for my ORIGINAL birth name. Bewildered I called them back<br/>\n&gt; and they told me that NO OTHER certificates were there concerning little<br/>\n&gt; old me.<br/>\n&gt;      After this I spoke to my mom...she FINALLY reveiled a secret to<br/>\n&gt; me...she had never gotten the paper work from my bio-mommy and thus my name<br/>\n&gt; had never LEGALLY been change at all! YEP! That&#39;s RIGHT! I had lived under<br/>\n&gt; and ALIAS for over 30 years! I had student loans...credit cards...etc. in a<br/>\n&gt; NON-Legit name! Well, I had to straighten this out right away! I had<br/>\n&gt; NON-Refundable CHEAP tickets to LONDON and I WASNT gonna miss out!<br/>\n&gt;      When I arrived at the local court house and explained what had happend<br/>\n&gt; and that I was actually changing my name to a name I had used for YEARS,<br/>\n&gt; the clerks and Judge laughed themselves silly! Indeed, it was funny! I<br/>\n&gt; think of all the SPY movies Ive seen over the years where the hero&#39;s laid<br/>\n&gt; out a huge amount of cash for a new ID and I had dont it for NOTHING! ROFL!<br/>\n&gt;      They say your life is usually a reflection of both your inner self and<br/>\n&gt; those you pull to you..and are around you. I think this means that we all<br/>\n&gt; need to too under the table..around the corner....dont take anything for<br/>\n&gt; granted..nothing is as it seems. Life is too wonderful to be that boring!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I love you all! And have a great day!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandy (Kal-ell) AkA Jadeeyes - Choco-holic!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does Windows keep &quot;&quot;bugging&quot;&quot; you?
