I like my<br/>\n&gt; Rogue but as of this new patch they still havnt done anything about<br/>\n&gt; fixing sneak/hide so they work well (like on the Test Server). Yes<br/>\n&gt; its nice they did something about our Poison skills (they&#39;ll probably<br/>\n&gt; be royally screwed up at first;) but honestly the class needs help<br/>\n&gt; and the stealth thing was a step in the right direction. I guess<br/>\n&gt; someone at Verant must REALLY hate Rogues...<br/>\n&gt; Sorry, I&#39;m disgruntled;)<br/>\n&gt; Anyway I was thinking of giving an Enchanter a spin, only class I<br/>\n&gt; really havnt played besides Magician. And if they ever implement<br/>\n&gt; enchanting weapons it would definatly be a good skill Guild-wise.<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;ll probably be a High Elf with a name like Timarius (because of<br/>\n&gt; my twisted sense of humour;), if your not a Monty Python fan you<br/>\n&gt; may not get that:)<br/>\n&gt; Anyway just dropping you all a line, take care:)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lonewolf<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
