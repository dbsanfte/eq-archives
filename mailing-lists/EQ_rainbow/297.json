This society teachings its","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1405122312\">Greetings everyone:) This gender issue caught my attention, and <br/>\nalso brought me around to thinking what it all boils down to. This <br/>\nsociety teachings its hatchling, as it were, that what they see is <br/>\nwhat they get, science uses this law as an almost pivital cruch to <br/>\nlean upon. It you cant measure, dissect, disassemble, then <br/>\nreassemble it doesnt exist. Well the problem is that somethings <br/>\ncan be taken apart and put back together again and not have some <br/>\nintegral part of them destroyed in the process. Man&#39;s greatest flaw <br/>\nin his arragance, his assumption that what is in front of his nose is <br/>\njust simply all there is and be damned if there is something else <br/>\ncause he dont believe in it. And, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed from the <br/>\nPolictics of Man, the Status Quo is ever so hard to break.<br/>\nSo here you have a buncha folks running at breakneck speed into <br/>\nthe darkness of their own ignorance. Why? Simply because the <br/>\nguy in front of him is. i guess the real question would be who is at <br/>\nthe head of the line, but thats another debate.<br/>\n\tPerception governs Reality. A phrase often over look, oft toss <br/>\nout a mere metaphysical mombojumbo. Well lets take a look at it. <br/>\nEverything we see, smell, taste, hear, interact with is completely <br/>\nreal to us at this moment. Obvious it would seem yes? But think <br/>\nback to your last memory of Dreaming, all of that seeming <br/>\ncompletely real as well. Even when I knew i was Dreaming I still <br/>\nwould find myself remarking on the reality of the situation. Now <br/>\ngranted when you wake up the waking world is <br/>\nquite discernable from the sleeping one, and you <br/>\nwonder how you could have ever been fooled...<br/>\nAnd that is perhaps what I am rambling on to, most people dont <br/>\nlike to think they&#39;ve been fooled; dont like the feeling of having the <br/>\nrug yanked out from under them. Unfortunitly (or fortunitly <br/>\ndepending on your level of malice) this online age has spawned a <br/>\nthousand ways to dupe your fellow man, from pyramid schemes <br/>\nand malignant lines of system command to simply appearing as <br/>\nthe opposite gender than what you really are. But here is my <br/>\nanswer to the debate. When we enter EQ we enter Norrath. Now <br/>\neven though I&#39;m not the strictist RPer and sometimes have <br/>\ndiscussions or make commits about this world in that one thats <br/>\nreally no big deal as i see it. I still walk in the bounds of my <br/>\ncharacter&#39;s personality, RPing Nazism only drives those that might <br/>\nbe interested in RPing away. Its hard to adequetly RP a character <br/>\nin a now speaking non-facial expression environment. Having to be <br/>\na fast typist is just one of the many pitfalls to this delima:) But <br/>\nback to what I was saying before, we are in Norrath, in the bodies <br/>\nof our characters, we are them for that time, male or female. If <br/>\nsomeone wants to ask you what your RL gender is its at your <br/>\ndiscretion to tell them, but you should not feel guilty about playing <br/>\nthe opposite gender. In fact if everyone believes you are that gender <br/>\nyou should congradulate yourself on an RP job well done. People <br/>\nwill always bitch about things, hell even I do (especially about <br/>\nVerant&#39;s &quot;HAHA we all really HATE Rogues over here&quot; policy;) but <br/>\nthat doesnt mean you have to listen to any of it. God gave us <br/>\nfingers so we could plug our ears and hands to cover our eyes:) <br/>\nMore Christian Groups should head that advice...<br/>\nAnyway I&#39;ve gone on long enough, I say place what you want and <br/>\nhave no regrets. There is no way you can go back and chance the <br/>\npast so why waste the future regreting it?<br/>\nTake care all you crazy faggots;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOver and out.<br/>\n<br/>\nLonewolf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
