I was given this as my middle name by my dearest <br/>\nmother but been called it all my life. I think she maybe had been <br/>\nsmoking dope when she made the decision but it&#39;s grown on me. =) Plus <br/>\nI&#39;m a homo and I just have to be different!<br/>\n<br/>\nLocation: Peterborough, UK (Born and bread Englishman, although <br/>\nfather in the US Air Force and was stationed over here)<br/>\n<br/>\nGender: Male<br/>\n<br/>\nAge: 19<br/>\n<br/>\nHomepage: Umm.. I&#39;m lucky I can turn my PC on let alone learn HTML =)<br/>\n<br/>\nStatus: Single, for the time being...although changes regularly<br/>\n<br/>\nMain character: Well I guess my main char will be Eizen now, level 7 <br/>\nCleric on Rodcet, also have my play rogue on there &quot;Rubian&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOther chars:<br/>\nUtini - Lvl 35 Erudite Enchantress - Tribunal Server<br/>\nDalmin - Lvl 14 Dark Elf Shadowknight - Tribunal Server<br/>\nLynta - Lvl 35 Dark Elf Mage - Luclin Server<br/>\nYizenthia - Lvl 20 Erudite Cleric - Luclin Server<br/>\nBanbi - Lvl 16 Half Elf Rogue - Luclin Server<br/>\nTyna - Lvl 14 Wood Elf Druid - Terris Thule<br/>\nyada yada...
