Looking to meet other people in the <br/>\narea with similar interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw that many of you had recently sent in a brief description of <br/>\nyourselves/characters.  I took the liberty to create a table on the <br/>\nEgroups site so that we can keep this info in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also created a file which is a Word 97 document.  This file <br/>\nhas the current stats and average prices of about 1500 items from the <br/>\ngame.  I have compiled this list from a few different websites and <br/>\nthought it would be good to have as a resource for people.  It prints <br/>\nnicely and is indexed by type of item (weapon, armor etc).   I will <br/>\nupdate it about every week or so.  If you want a copy of this file, <br/>\nsend me an email and I will send it to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy characters are all currently on the Innorruk server.  I have a lvl <br/>\n29 druid named Looseleaf Binders.  I have been haunting the Lake of <br/>\nIll Omens and whooping up on the Sarnak&#39;s and goblins in the area!<br/>\nI just left my guild (Mithril Knights) because I felt they were far <br/>\nto clique.  I want to find a guild where most people are there to <br/>\nhelp one another.  A gay or gay-friendly group would be ideal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI typically play from 7pm to 11pm most nights and on the weekends as <br/>\nmuch as possible.  If you want to group sometime, just give me a <br/>\ntell.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLater,<br/>\nRick</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
