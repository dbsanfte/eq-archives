It was the travelling that made my way fun again. I went<br/>\neverywhere (well almost) and died a few times. I had fun and thats what my<br/>\ngame is about.. Having fun.. with friends I made. Trust me travelling to<br/>\nplaces and testing your limits has got to be the best! Yes you die, and you<br/>\nknow dying is part of the game. Once I got over the fear of death I had alot<br/>\nof fun. I mean I was not necessarily suicidal, I was cautious. I test out my<br/>\nskills, learn, adventure and enjoy. Aren&#39;t you on the Rodcet Nife ? If you<br/>\nare, You are more than welcome to join me in my travels. Ill take care of<br/>\nu.. my friends and guildmates are wonderfull and your bound to have a good<br/>\ntime no matter what. We are all higher levels though, so exp would be eeh<br/>\nfor ya, but wed do our best to keep you alive and adventure as a team. Thats<br/>\nthat.. so im here for ya to cure your boredom blues<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WAMPIR@...\">WAMPIR@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WAMPIR@...\">WAMPIR@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 10, 1999 10:44 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_rainbow@onelist.com\">EQ_rainbow@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_rainbow] Anti-Camping ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WAMPIR@...\">WAMPIR@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 8/10/99 1:37:08 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:josephn@...\">josephn@...</a><br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Jeez!<br/>\n<br/>\n I am a lvl 13 wizard and I need a shoulder to cry on.  I have reached that<br/>\n stage where I have bcome bored and frustrated by EQ.  I can&#39;t find quality<br/>\n poelpe to quest with, most that I have found before are way past me now in<br/>\n level.  I am so fucing sick of going to the same places and getting hardly<br/>\n any expeirence, and spending half the time meditating.  what do I do!!!???<br/>\n Woe is me!   how did you all get past this time?   Is there anyplace I<br/>\n sbould go to get good exp or items?  I dont ave anything cool or any<br/>\n latinum I am pathetic....|:(  &lt;snif&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n -joe &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst thing you need to do is loose the self pity...:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNext Depending on your Class Race Lev. Do some traveling.  Even if your a<br/>\nDarkelf at elv 13 you can go just about anywhere you want to.  I&#39;m not<br/>\nsaying<br/>\nyou can fight anywhere you want to. but you can go anywhere you want to.<br/>\nFind<br/>\nsome people near your lev to fight with. Sometimes a shout is not the best<br/>\nway to find a group. exp at lower teens. Walk up on a group, and ask nicely<br/>\nif they have room for another. You will meet the sh8t heads that are rude.<br/>\nJust ingor them, dont let them get to you. Above all elce have some fun.<br/>\nEven<br/>\ndieing can be fun if you look at it the right way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO<br/>\nWampir<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
