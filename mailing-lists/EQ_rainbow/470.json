I have<br/>\n&gt; obtained cold fusion so the databse idea for members to place their<br/>\n&gt; characters, server and stats upon the site should be easily setup and going.<br/>\n&gt; I have secured the real information behind my secure wall and will be<br/>\n&gt; accessible by password and username. I hate to do this but to keep people<br/>\n&gt; from being harassed it would be the best way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here is a list of ideas I have about adding to the site.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message Board<br/>\n&gt; Possible Chat room for real-time conversation<br/>\n&gt; Guild Members Database<br/>\n&gt;     This will include<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Character Name<br/>\n&gt;     Level<br/>\n&gt;     Race<br/>\n&gt;     Class<br/>\n&gt;     Server<br/>\n&gt;     email address<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Also have the idea about placing a skill section so you can specify the<br/>\n&gt; skill you have and what levels, could be helpful for a tailor looking to get<br/>\n&gt; items enchanted by an Enchanter. This will help to get guild member out to<br/>\n&gt; assist others in there adventures. The email address can be used to allow<br/>\n&gt; others to contact you about the services they may require of a specific<br/>\n&gt; character. I will place a way to search the listings for specific<br/>\n&gt; information and whether someone wishes to provide these services.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let me know if there are any other ideas that you may want to see added to<br/>\n&gt; the site. The base site can be available pretty quickly but the advanced<br/>\n&gt; items will take sometime to complete. If anyone wishes to help please let me<br/>\n&gt; know, I will gladly accept any assist. We will need graphics and if we can<br/>\n&gt; devise a logo that would be great.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lastly, David I will gladly take on the role of guild master or officer for<br/>\n&gt; the E&#39;Ci server. I am on quite regularly and my character is a decent level<br/>\n&gt; so I can get pretty much anywhere (as long as I sneak about, LOL). Let me<br/>\n&gt; know what I can do to help.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have been staying in Northern Ro mostly so anyone in that area, give me a<br/>\n&gt; tell. To all of you I just want to say that if you ever need anything in the<br/>\n&gt; game let me know I will be more than glad to do what I can!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; May prosperity be in all your endeavors,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt; (Marlys on E&#39;Ci)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Lora Roa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loraroa@...\">loraroa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_rainbow@onelist.com\">EQ_rainbow@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_rainbow@onelist.com\">EQ_rainbow@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Friday, September 10, 1999 3:29 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_rainbow] Harrasment and E&#39;Ci...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Lora Roa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loraroa@...\">loraroa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If I see him online, I am tempted to do a tell to him and tell him I saw<br/>\n&gt; &gt;their<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;web site, and am very supportive of gay people and wish his guild luck<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;(pretending I&#39;m straight of course.) He may decide to delete the thing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;himself<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;if I do that. If I do it, I&#39;ll be sure to /log first to record everything<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;you all to see.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Ooooo!  Ooooo!  I could do it.  But on a more serious note wouldn&#39;t without<br/>\n&gt; &gt;your knowing or in the middle of GM discussions ...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;And on the website, great!  I wonder if I can bug a friend and see what<br/>\n&gt; &gt;royalty free graphics we can dig up ... I also can do Logo-type graphics<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and have had some companies and groups use mine before, I still have my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;graphics package (I bought it).  If anyone has freehand graphics though, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;do have a scanner and can scan if they are sent to me and get it in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;variety of graphics formats (as well as photo touch-up work, etc ...).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- Lora<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
