I have to confess that my <br/>\npartner Chris is actually the one that got addicted, and I thought it <br/>\nwould be &quot;the end&quot; if I didn&#39;t start playing, too! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nA while back there were a few Bears out there who played EQ on a <br/>\nparticular server, and I know that Chris has run across some of the <br/>\nG/L/B/T PCs who buffed him, but disappeared before he could ask for <br/>\nmore guild info. Anyone out there know anything?<br/>\n<br/>\nI live in St. Louis, am a 34 year old Bear employed as a statistician <br/>\nand research designer for a managed health company. Chris is an LA <br/>\nnative, and is a dba manager for a firm in Chicago. We&#39;ve been <br/>\ntogether now for just over a year, hopefully to be together a <br/>\nlifetime or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad I found the list. I&#39;d love to hear from you folks!<br/>\nJack<br/>\nOctoBear</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
