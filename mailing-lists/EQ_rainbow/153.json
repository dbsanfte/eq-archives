I?m just<br/>\nthrowing in my 2 cents concerning the issues with the guild and Everquests<br/>\nGM issues. I?ve read lots and lots of our letters on all of this and<br/>\nfigured I?d share my thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Firstly, the Guild idea TOTALLY rocks. Having a guild on each of the<br/>\nother servers means we can be ?Messengers of Unity? for the rest of Norrath<br/>\n(Not a bad Guild name maybe?maybe not?eh) (shrug).<br/>\n<br/>\n     Secondly, depending on the turnout tonight at the FIRST NON-official<br/>\nmeeting of the yet to exist GUILD will help us establish some ideas and<br/>\ngoals for us all. From what I?ve experienced being in a guild, it offers<br/>\npeople a chance to learn from those who came before and a chance to buy<br/>\nweapons and armor that we are ready to MOVE ON from because we?ve found<br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\n     A good example of this is my characters on E?ci. Both belong to the<br/>\nsame Guild, The Chosen, because of this membership and UNITY within the<br/>\nguild I have BETTER armor than I could have afforded and better weaponry<br/>\n(Jadeeyes has TWO Minotaur Axes and Bealtaine uses a COMBINE Scimitar and<br/>\nhe?s only 6th level.) Membership has its rewards I must say!<br/>\n<br/>\n     Thirdly and finally, the reason for having a bereavement day is so<br/>\npeople don?t have to work when someone they are close to has something<br/>\nterrible happen to them. I can?t IMAGINE Everquests company doesn?t HAVE<br/>\nthis sort of policy. That GM should NOT have been working if that were<br/>\nreally that case. PLUS?there?s NO reason for us to tolerate that kind of<br/>\nbehavior. We pay THEIR salaries?plus I wouldn?t want one of my staff coming<br/>\nto work after such a terrible thing if they didn?t somewhat have their act<br/>\ntogether. Of course it could also have been a case of POWER happy EQ gm.<br/>\nGee, that could NEVER happen!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhelp, welcome to Sandy?s SoapBox!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care all and remember,<br/>\n<br/>\nShow Norrath the kind of Superheroes we TRULY are!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy Collier<br/>\n(AKA Jadeeyes and Bealtaine) E?ci ROCKS!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
