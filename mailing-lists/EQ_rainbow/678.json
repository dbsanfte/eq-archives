I just joined MA on Rodcet yesterday (as Snapdragyn), & <br/>\nwanted to say hello & thanks for the friendly welcome. I was upset <br/>\nwhen I found out MA has (apparently) gone defunct on Brell -- I&#39;d <br/>\nmoved there specifically to join after 1st starting on Erollisi (only <br/>\ngot to 3rd or so there). I had 2 chars on Brell, both at 6th, & had <br/>\nworked up a good storyline to RP for them (twins, estranged from the <br/>\nfamily, 1 thought the other was dead -- oh, the drama, the drama). <br/>\nSo, finding out that I had to drop them if I wanted to move to Rodcet <br/>\n& join MA was NOT pleasant news.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, let me say to anyone who&#39;s debating the same situation -- <br/>\nIT&#39;S WORTH IT! I&#39;ve done an EQ marathon this weekend to get Snap (do <br/>\nprefer that to &#39;Snappy&#39;, BTW) up to 5th, & I&#39;ve had a lot of fun -- <br/>\nwhether just watching & joining the guildchat while bashing waspies, <br/>\nor grouping with Thundyr (a guildmate I met in G&#39;Fay who&#39;s the same <br/>\nlevel). I&#39;m already looking forward to starting a rogue on Rodcet & <br/>\ngetting him in the guild, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Okay, the basic info:<br/>\n<br/>\nName: Todd Morris<br/>\nLocation: San Francisco -- Mecca!<br/>\nAge: *cough* Almost 30 *cough* (34 -- &#39;almost&#39; from the other side)<br/>\nSingle<br/>\nMain chars: Er, not sure now. Were Trylain & Trylorn, the twins -- <br/>\nWizard of the Sixth Circle/Rogue of the Sixth Shadow on Brell. <br/>\nAlready leaning towards Snapdragyn (Bard of the Fifth Song), but <br/>\nwe&#39;ll see.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Er, forgot the rest of the stuff from that intro form (oops), but <br/>\nthere&#39;s a little. Look forward to seeing you all ingame!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
