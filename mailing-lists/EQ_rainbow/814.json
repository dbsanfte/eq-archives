Eizen<br/>\nappeared about ready to nod off at any moment. As had become their <br/>\nusual habit, Kerik ported his cleric friend to the commons and the<br/>\ntwo <br/>\nmen spent the night next to the druid ring, wrapped in each others <br/>\narms. Kerik struggled and fumbled with the tent. Nerves! he thought. <br/>\nMust relax. He took a deep, calming breath.<br/>\n    It had been a busy night. He&#39;d been helping Gotham in her quest<br/>\nto <br/>\nkill asps when news reached him that Adessa had been seen dancing <br/>\nnaked around Eizen. There was even a rumor they had made love. Kerik <br/>\nwas so angry he couldn&#39;t see straight. His first inclination had been <br/>\nto leave Eizen. But his heart wouldn&#39;t let him. He needed Eizen. He <br/>\njust hadn&#39;t been able to take that next step.<br/>\n    His brother, Jono, had almost convinced him to go ahead and ask <br/>\nfor Eizen&#39;s hand. But Jono had left Faydwer at an early age and<br/>\nwasn&#39;t <br/>\naware of the class system -- wasn&#39;t aware of how the high elves<br/>\nlooked <br/>\ndown upon their woodland kin. To Jono, it was just a matter of <br/>\nfollowing one&#39;s heart. But to Kerik, it was more complicated. What <br/>\nwould Eizen&#39;s parents think? Wouldn&#39;t they abandon their son for <br/>\nmarrying a dirty wood elf? Did he really want to put Eizen in a <br/>\nposition to choose between him and his entire culture? And then there <br/>\nwas the fear of outright rejection. What is Eizen just didn&#39;t want to <br/>\nmarry him? Maybe he should just maintain the status quo, he had <br/>\nthought.<br/>\n    Then Adessa came along. Kerik knew he had to act now or never. <br/>\nAfter getting over his anger, he quickly began trying to find a ring. <br/>\nAfter a long wait on what must have been the slowest Paladin in all<br/>\nof <br/>\nNorrath, Kerik was able to purchase a ring.<br/>\n    Now, if he could just get the tent set up. There. It was done.<br/>\nAnd <br/>\nEizen was in it already and about to nod off. &quot;Wait...&quot; Kerik <br/>\nimplored. He had rehearsed this moment in his head so many times. He <br/>\nwould kneel. Then hand Eizen the ring and ask him to marry him. But <br/>\nEizen&#39;s sleepy eyes and Kerik&#39;s nervousness ruined his well rehearsed <br/>\nplan.<br/>\n    Instead, he quickly dug around his pocket for the ring. It was <br/>\ngone! Where could it be? Then he remembered... he was wearing the <br/>\nForman&#39;s Tunic Eizen had just given him and the ring was in his old <br/>\nLockjaw vest. He grabbed the ring and stretched out his shaking hand <br/>\nto Eizen without saying a word. Eizen looked at the ring and saw it <br/>\nwas an engagement ring. Kerik looked into Eizen&#39;s eyes for some kind <br/>\nof sign as to whether he was going to accept it or not. After what <br/>\nseemed like forever, Eizen smiled as he took the ring and placed it<br/>\non <br/>\nhis finger.<br/>\n    &quot;You took it,&quot; Kerik said surprised more than anything but filled <br/>\nwith joy too, as tears welled up in his eyes.<br/>\n    Eizen smiled back at him. &quot;Weren&#39;t you supposed to kneel down on <br/>\none knee?&quot;<br/>\n    Kerik shrugged and stared at the ground in embarrassment. &quot;I was <br/>\ntoo nervous and thought you were about to fall asleep.&quot;<br/>\n    Eizen wiped the tears from Kerik&#39;s eyes and they held each other <br/>\nfor the longest time.<br/>\n<br/>\n===============================<br/>\nEizen, High Elven Cleric of the 35th season and Kerik Rainbow, Wood <br/>\nElf Druid of the 31st season announce their engagement to be married <br/>\nat a time and place to be determined. The entire Mystic Alliance<br/>\nguild <br/>\nand all other interested parties will be invited to attend the <br/>\nceremony and reception. There will be plenty of food and drink for <br/>\nall. (Hope to have some actual wedding cake now that the recipe has <br/>\nbeen discovered.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe grooms are registered at Leather and Hide, Jade&#39;s Jewelry shop<br/>\nand <br/>\nother fine stores in Freeport and surrounding areas.<br/>\n<br/>\n/ooc Everyone from the EQ Rainbow list will be invited to join us on <br/>\nthe Rodcet Nife server for the big event. Once we have determined a <br/>\nlocation, if you don&#39;t have a character on the server, you can create <br/>\none in the closest starting city. We are looking for a location that <br/>\nwill not be KOS to anyone and we should have plenty of people <br/>\navailable to provide ports as well. If you&#39;ve been thinking about <br/>\ncoming over and visiting us in the largest gay/gay friendly guild in <br/>\nNorrath, this will be a great to chance to meet everyone. The event <br/>\nwill take place some time after the 6th of October as I (Kerik) will <br/>\nbe out of town.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
