My brother played a gay basher who<br/>\nassaulted JTT who was playing a gay highschool boy.  I actually got to<br/>\ntalk to JTT on the phone one, which I was surprised to find actually<br/>\nexcited me lol.  I haven&#39;t actually seen Common Ground as it hasn&#39;t been<br/>\nshown in Canada =/<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother also appears in Snow Day, a movie that opened this weekend.<br/>\nIt&#39;s basicly a kids movie.
