And I&#39;ve even heard some nasty GM &quot;I don&#39;t give a fuck&quot; stories.<br/>\nThis takes the cake, this goes against everything McQuaid said he didn&#39;t want EQ to<br/>\nbe. This makes them all slimeball liars IMHO. In a word this enrages me in a way no<br/>\nwords can express...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We all know that character names are restricted by bounds of good<br/>\n&gt; taste/decency/keeping with the spirit of the game.  So you can imagine I was a<br/>\n&gt; little surprised when a characer named &quot;Cokaine&quot; shows up.  Not only that, he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; using /ooc to carry on private conversations all over the place on Brell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I /tell him to please use a channel for side chatter.  I won&#39;t repeate the<br/>\n&gt; response I got.  I warn him to cool it, or I /petition.  Use your imagination on<br/>\n&gt; the response I got - and it was to store my goodies in a locked box either!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I give up and /petition.  This guy was really all over the place.  A few minutes<br/>\n&gt; later, a GM pops up and tells me to not make false complaints!  I let him have<br/>\n&gt; both barrels, and hard.  A minute later he comes back and tells me that in fact,<br/>\n&gt; Cokaine is also known as Vampyre aka Jason White.  He&#39;s a GM!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I asked why he could get away this conduct.  The GM says &quot;he&#39;s had a bad day -<br/>\n&gt; his wife died yesterday&quot;.  C&#39;mon - do I have &quot;Hello I&#39;m a stupid 14 year old&quot;<br/>\n&gt; written on my forehead?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>His wife died eh? Why don&#39;t I believe he&#39;d be playing EQ if his wife died. I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be playing EQ if my mate died. This is bullshit pure and simple. Congrats<br/>\npeople, welcome to the new P.T. Barnum show and guess who all the suckers are? This<br/>\nway to the egress people, Asheron&#39;s Call is beginning to sound better everyday....<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Needless to say, I&#39;ve sent a formal complaint in.  I&#39;d suggest that if you get<br/>\n&gt; someone who&#39;s just a bit too obnoxious, don&#39;t be suprised if it&#39;s a GM.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*sigh* Maybe I&#39;m just disgruntled, maybe I&#39;m right. Maybe none of the GMs give a<br/>\ndamn, I happen to think that. I am truly disgusted at this point, when will people<br/>\nlearn that the UO &quot;Band-Aid&quot; approach doesn&#39;t work? If monsters are having AI<br/>\nproblems with objects you don&#39;t make them &quot;Omnipotent masters of death&quot;, you just<br/>\nspend some time fixing the problem. But oh, I&#39;m sorry, that takes effort, a word<br/>\nediting out by Verant&#39;s language filter apparently. I feel kind of sad that I<br/>\nfinally found a nice community in the midst of this festering shithole of a game,<br/>\nbut hey, Humanity has been fucking each other over for thousands of years, why drop<br/>\nthe tradition now?<br/>\n<br/>\nAngry,<br/>\nLonewolf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
