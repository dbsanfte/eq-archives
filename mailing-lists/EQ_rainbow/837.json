He being a Dwarf smith, is happy to see another <br/>\nshaman!  Once we get you up in levels, we can put you to work <br/>\nmixing dyes!!  ;)  Seriously though, I will be probably on Fwayder <br/>\ntoinight seeing if I can finally make Imbued Dwarven Plate.  (why <br/>\ndo people always have to start their charachters on the otherside <br/>\nof the world from where I am).  Maybe if Snapdragon is still on <br/>\nthe Antonican side of the world and comes on tonight we can get <br/>\nhim to Selo&#39;s his happy ass out there and invite you in.  <br/>\nHopefully today&#39;s patch won&#39;t take longer than 12 hours.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again, welcome to our insanity!<br/>\n<br/>\nJai Sacks<br/>\n<br/>\nHamyrmint Forgewell &lt;Mystic Alliance&gt;<br/>\n41 Cleric of Kaladim<br/>\nRodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_rainbow@egroups.com\">EQ_rainbow@egroups.com</a>, NVKedek@h... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just found this group and believe me, I&#39;ve been looking for it <br/>\nfor <br/>\n&gt; a long time! I had been on every search engine I could think of <br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; nothing was coming up, finally I got to HOTBOT and there it <br/>\nwas <br/>\n&gt; EQ_Rainbow. As I was clicking the link, I thought for sure it <br/>\nwould <br/>\n&gt; be dead. But it wasn&#39;t (YAY!) and here I am. I always knew there <br/>\nhad <br/>\n&gt; to be others on EQ, but I was starting to have doubts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have been playing on Morrel-Thule for the last 7 months or so, <br/>\nbut <br/>\n&gt; not reguarly until recently. Anyway, I have decided that since I <br/>\n&gt; finally found the group, I am going to move over to Rodcet Nife <br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; create a new character (I can&#39;t believe I have to be a newbie <br/>\nAGAIN!)<br/>\n&gt; At least, no one took my name. :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I just wanted to say &quot;Hey&quot; to everyone and if you are in <br/>\nEQ <br/>\n&gt; on Rodcet Nife give a /tell to Kedek, I am very interested in <br/>\njoining <br/>\n&gt; the guild.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Until then,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kedek Vega<br/>\n&gt; 2nd season Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt; Barbarian-Shaman </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
