Today I entered Crush Bone right after a nasty train<br/>\nhad chased me out. I came upon a TROLL (His name is/was Bezerker) who con&#39;d<br/>\ngreen to me (He was ALSO very twinked..FULL Crafted..Exe. Axe etc. ) and was<br/>\nbe being hit on by a lowly GREEN orc. Needless to say we all know the woes<br/>\nof trying to loot while having something hit us..we don&#39;t like it. SO, I<br/>\nkill the greeny orc. Bezerker THEN curses me out for being a KS&#39;er and says<br/>\nhe has reported me. I was STUNNED! I spoke with him a few moments to assure<br/>\nhim of my good intent but he would have none of it. Upon exiting CB I saw<br/>\nhim in a duel with another PC. The PC won and I applauded. The Bezerker<br/>\nperson was apparently not to bright because he was BOUND in G Fay and had<br/>\ndied numerous times. I was impressed to see that he undone himself by dying<br/>\ntoo much. Upon getting killed ONCE more by Orcs, his TWINKED body<br/>\nDecayed...EVERYTHING he had on him was GONE** POOF**. I know now that there<br/>\nis a goddess and she loves me :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSigned,<br/>\n<br/>\nGypsiee (Sandy)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
