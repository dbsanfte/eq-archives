There is no obvious good name that everyone will love.  It would have<br/>\n&gt; already been suggested by now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. Online discussion takes way way longer than real life discussion.<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re not all sitting in a room together chatting.  A conversation that<br/>\n&gt; might take two minutes in a room can take a week online, as people<br/>\n&gt; exchange ideas.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3. Votes in online mediums take at least a week.  First someone has to set<br/>\n&gt; a deadline for submission of named to be voted on.  Second, someone has to<br/>\n&gt; extract all those names and post a list.  Third, we have to wait 48 hours<br/>\n&gt; for people to vote.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For all these reasons, I would like David to select a name based on our<br/>\n&gt; discussion, but not governed by any official selection process (like a<br/>\n&gt; vote).  I also think their should be a cap on discussion, and that cap<br/>\n&gt; should be soon (like now perhaps 8)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think we generally agree that the most imporant thing is that the guild<br/>\n&gt; exist with some name.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Chrisitna<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Thu, 29 Jul 1999, Joseph Normandin wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Joseph Normandin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:josephn@...\">josephn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thats cool, but how do we know what poeple want?  are we going to ahve a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; vote?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -joe<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Start a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\n&gt; For details on ONElist´┐¢s NEW FRIENDS & FAMILY program, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
