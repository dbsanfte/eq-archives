The person obviously didn&#39;t know who you were. I am the kind of person that hates to take anything from anyone though. Plus, do you wonder about what your friend might think about this? If someone borrowed my character and acted like me when people saw him walking about, I would be rather peeved, especially if they took my friend for quite a bit of stuff. If you are happy and your friend is happy, then more power to you! It still is just a game, even if we put more time into it than we do our jobs -lol. <br/>\n<br/>\nHappy hunting all! <br/>\nEric  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pierce2@...\">pierce2@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 19 August 1999, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scollier@...\">scollier@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scollier@...\">scollier@...</a><br/>\n <br/>\nYou won&#39;t believe what happened last night!

The man was very<br/>\nhappy to see &#39;me&#39; on line again and promptly told me of everything that had<br/>\nhappened to him in the last while. Not wanting to embarras him I played<br/>\nalong. He noticed my character hadnt any of the neat things he used to have<br/>\nand offered to help me out. He gives me SEVERAL backpacks FULL of magic<br/>\nItems and THEN takes me to the bank and SHOVELS 1600 pp into my pockets! I<br/>\nnearly faint!
