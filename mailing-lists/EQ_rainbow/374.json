A friend of mine got burned out<br/>\n&gt; playing his 35th level Dwarf Paladin and gave him to me to play. As I was<br/>\n&gt; traveling around I ran into someone he had gamed with. The man was very<br/>\n&gt; happy to see &#39;me&#39; on line again and promptly told me of everything that had<br/>\n&gt; happened to him in the last while. Not wanting to embarras him I played<br/>\n&gt; along. He noticed my character hadnt any of the neat things he used to have<br/>\n&gt; and offered to help me out. He gives me SEVERAL backpacks FULL of magic<br/>\n&gt; Items and THEN takes me to the bank and SHOVELS 1600 pp into my pockets! I<br/>\n&gt; nearly faint! I thank him and promise to group with him soon as he<br/>\n&gt; camps..waves and POOFS out. Man! I think Im drunk on money! I was actually<br/>\n&gt; ENCUMBERED by the MONEY he gave me! (160 lbs worth!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; For details, including our weekly drawing, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
