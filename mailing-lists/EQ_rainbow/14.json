He judges people individually , not by their race or<br/>\nclass (Exception being Dark-elf Necros and SK&#39;s since they have sworn<br/>\nthemselves to the path of evil and oppose directly as to what my character<br/>\nstands for ... most of &#39;em at least =P ) . I haven&#39;t really thought about<br/>\nRP&#39;ing my character as a gay person , even though I think it could be fun<br/>\nand interesting . <br/>\n<br/>\nAlrighty , ooc :<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a 19 year old - almost 20 (July 10th , Wohooo !!!) gay guy living in<br/>\nNYC . I don&#39;t have many gay friends (As strange as it might seem from<br/>\nsomeone living in NYC , but it&#39;s true !!) and wish to make more . So I<br/>\nguess this mailing list is a good start since all of us have a common<br/>\ninterest ... EQ =P<br/>\nAnyway , that&#39;s all I have to say for now so take care all =)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Nystul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
