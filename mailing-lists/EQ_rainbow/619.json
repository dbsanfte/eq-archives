I was in a group in<br/>\ninfected paw and my boyfreind was in another group in the same zone.  One<br/>\nof my group members kepot going near their &quot;camp&quot; and so Rob (my bf) asked<br/>\nme to telkl him not to, which i did.  he then said &quot;who said that?  I will<br/>\nkill him hehehe&quot; just joking and all, and i said &quot;well it was my love who<br/>\nsaid it so if you killed him i would ahve to kill you, and shoot a frosy<br/>\nbolt up your ictchy arse&quot; (as i am a wizard and heois a troll)  then he<br/>\nsaid &quot;YOUR LOVE IS A MAN&quot; and i said &quot;yes i am gay, deal&quot; and he procceded<br/>\nto say &quot;i ahve been grouped side by side witha  fag!&quot;  and then disbanded<br/>\nand shouted &quot;I;m surrounded by freaks&quot;  needless to say he was repoirted,<br/>\nbut i dont tihnk a GM was on...maybe our little guide friend can look into<br/>\nthis....his name was Slamuk...no pressure, and i didint even suggest that<br/>\n:)   Luckily the other poeple in the group were great and thought he was<br/>\nstupd and our replacement tank asked why our last one ran aorund screeming<br/>\nand we told him and he was pissed and thought it was absurd...so that was<br/>\ncool<br/>\n<br/>\nhave fun in kunark!<br/>\n<br/>\n-joe<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 25 Apr 2000, Christina Norman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Ok, this might just be a rant, but since it&#39;s non hostile I&#39;m going to post it here =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; WOW Iksar are so cute.  The first time I ever saw one I was like...oh my gosh! It walks around and swings its little tail and talks and everything! It&#39;s like the best pet!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And Kunark is very pretty.  Lots of fun new zones, with cool looking critters.  It&#39;s pretty obvious to me you could hunt in Kunark and never leave, and get all the way to 50.  It seems a self sufficient continent.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kunark is dangerous though, I have talked to a lot of people who brought their mains over and got stomped by something.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The solution to all this is...make an Iksar shaman! You get SOW at 9th level and you can explore like crazy.  Team up with a friend and make an Iksar monk, and you have a great 2-person leveling/exploring team especially for low levels.  FYI Iksar have regeneration, and the highest wis of the shaman races, making them the best shaman and monk races IMHO (though they aren&#39;t as cute as Duna).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (Rumor: Iksar do not get the inherent haste that human monks get at level 20+)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Your high school sweetheart-where is he now?
