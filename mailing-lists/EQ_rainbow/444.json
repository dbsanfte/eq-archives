I wonder if I can bug a friend and see what<br/>\nroyalty free graphics we can dig up ... I also can do Logo-type graphics<br/>\nand have had some companies and groups use mine before, I still have my<br/>\ngraphics package (I bought it).  If anyone has freehand graphics though, I<br/>\ndo have a scanner and can scan if they are sent to me and get it in a<br/>\nvariety of graphics formats (as well as photo touch-up work, etc ...). <br/>\n<br/>\n- Lora</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
