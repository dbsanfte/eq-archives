Being on a young server, the<br/>\nforces of darkness were truly overwhelming and could not be stopped.  The<br/>\nlevel 50+ dark elf NPCs in high hold killed everyone who went against them<br/>\nas far as I know.  They should really vary the strength of the NPCs<br/>\naccording to the servers that the event is held on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I was able to follow the general storyline, I did not find it<br/>\ncompelling or enveloping.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent most of my time in Kithcor trying vainly to stop the daughter of<br/>\nInnoruk.  All the NPCs had extremely high magic resistence.  I managed to<br/>\nmesmerize one GM but since he was being constantly attacked it was<br/>\npointless (mes kept breaking).<br/>\n<br/>\nI did however enjoy the post-ascention undead raid on Kithcor.  I wish my<br/>\nparty had been better organized we might have got a few kills on the big<br/>\nNPCs.  I also enjoyed the post-raid regular night undead spawns in<br/>\nkithcor.  I helped a bunch of people get some of the cool new weapons that<br/>\nwere dropped there.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
