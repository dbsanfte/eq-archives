Everything<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard from the test server is about massive slaughter.  I think<br/>\npeople see the race wars as a big excuse to PvP for the fun of PvP.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking originally I wouldn&#39;t play for that reason, but now I think<br/>\nI might try it out...but not seriously.  I don&#39;t want to have to worry<br/>\nabout my character being killed all the time.  If I play I&#39;ll just accept<br/>\nthat that will probably happen a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
