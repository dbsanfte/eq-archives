Right now i<br/>\nhave a few mesh things, a collar of undead protection and the sr apprentice<br/>\nrobe (god i am going to be sad to actually have to get rid of this, cause it<br/>\nis so cute). I am also a mini tank. I love to go out and pull and live close<br/>\nto death on the regular basis. I have a good team, so i almost rarely die.<br/>\nBut as i do this, i also am going to need a little better protection for<br/>\nmyself and i feel so limited because i take more damage easily. .. SO can<br/>\nanyone have any advice on what to get for my mage and where to get it. The<br/>\nStuff You get from GuK isn&#39;t much..its only benefit is it ways less. i hope<br/>\nthere is better..  I am level 15 right now and in dire need of help. .. oh<br/>\nyeah.. what about the staffs ? like the crystal staff, water and slime staff<br/>\n? where are these located .. I am just looking for some advice<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all.<br/>\n<br/>\nPs. I am going to try to do the chat server guild thing wed. But my job<br/>\ntimes fluxuate, so i might not get off work in time. i am PST so its going<br/>\nto be tough.. but i will do my best for my family..<br/>\n<br/>\nReuben<br/>\na.k.a Nate of the Rodcet Nife server..</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
