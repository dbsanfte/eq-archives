It will be near the little dock with<br/>\nthe rowboat.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the druid ring, travel SW.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the wizard circle, travel NW and cross the river. There is a bridge.<br/>\nAfter crossing the bridge go almost due west to get to the dock.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Erudin, travel SW till you get to the water, then head directly south.<br/>\n<br/>\n(For those using an EQ Atlas map of Toxxulia Forest, it is the point labeled<br/>\nnumber 7)<br/>\n<br/>\nWARNING: There is a necro named Elial Brook (level 6 or 7ish) that hangs out<br/>\nnear the dock. He cons ready to attack to most people. We will need someone<br/>\nto kill him regularly to protect any low levels attending the wedding. His<br/>\nspawn time is 6 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFentus and Kerik will be doing ports prior to the ceremony. I should be on<br/>\naround noon Eastern on Saturday to begin setting things up, so give me a<br/>\ntell if you need a port. For obvious reasons, I will not be able to port if<br/>\nyou are running late.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuests from other servers are encouraged to create Rodcet Nife characters if<br/>\nyou wish to attend. It would be best to create Erudite characters. Taren<br/>\nwill be available at the entrance to Erudin to buff and sow you for a safe<br/>\njourney to the wedding / reception site.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaren and Gwynap are catering the reception. They have prepared quite a<br/>\nfeast with plenty of spirits too. There is also talk of getting fireworks.<br/>\nIt should be cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very dubious of the GM showing up to do the ceremony. I was told to<br/>\npetition tonight (Friday) to remind them and also to petition on Saturday 2<br/>\nhours prior. However, our very own Kythwin has agreed to serve as minister<br/>\nif the GM should be a no-show.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are expecting 10-20 people at least, and think it will be a lot of fun.<br/>\nWe will have at least one person from another server and also, Harbinger<br/>\nfrom Band of Gypsies plans to attend (BTW he says hello to everyone in<br/>\nMystic Alliance).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile setting up an EQ wedding is easier than a real one, it has taken a lot<br/>\nof work nonetheless. Thanks to everyone who has helped. Eizen and I really<br/>\nappreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs and kisses,<br/>\nKerik and Eizen</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
