The first time I ever saw one I was like...oh my <br/>\n&gt;gosh! It walks around and swings its little tail and talks and everything! <br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s like the best pet!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And Kunark is very pretty.  Lots of fun new zones, with cool looking <br/>\n&gt;critters.  It&#39;s pretty obvious to me you could hunt in Kunark and never <br/>\n&gt;leave, and get all the way to 50.  It seems a self sufficient continent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kunark is dangerous though, I have talked to a lot of people who brought <br/>\n&gt;their mains over and got stomped by something.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The solution to all this is...make an Iksar shaman! You get SOW at 9th <br/>\n&gt;level and you can explore like crazy.  Team up with a friend and make an <br/>\n&gt;Iksar monk, and you have a great 2-person leveling/exploring team <br/>\n&gt;especially for low levels.  FYI Iksar have regeneration, and the highest <br/>\n&gt;wis of the shaman races, making them the best shaman and monk races IMHO <br/>\n&gt;(though they aren&#39;t as cute as Duna).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(Rumor: Iksar do not get the inherent haste that human monks get at level <br/>\n&gt;20+)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
