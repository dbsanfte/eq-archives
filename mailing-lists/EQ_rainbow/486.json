Thanks to all who<br/>\n&gt; have helped and thanks for your patience.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am still awaiting word from the GM on E&#39;ci as to whether she has been able<br/>\n&gt; to get the &#39;hijacked&#39; version of our guild deleted.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As we get guilds set up and people made into guild leaders and officers, I<br/>\n&gt; think it would be a good idea if every guild leader kept a list of all<br/>\n&gt; members and their contact information (i.e. email address). I dont&#39; want to<br/>\n&gt; turn this into a record keeping nightmare, but I think that we at least<br/>\n&gt; should have this much information on file. Does this sound reasonable to<br/>\n&gt; everyone?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hugs,<br/>\n&gt; David<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dedric on Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
