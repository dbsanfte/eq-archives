Since<br/>\nthe guild seems to be doing well on Rodcet Nife, and I have to start over<br/>\nfrom scratch anyway, I figured I&#39;d create a character or two on that server.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any people in the guild who have low level characters there that I<br/>\ncould group with? If so, what race/class should I play to complement them?<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t followed all the various nerfs since I quit, so I don&#39;t know what<br/>\nwould be a good class to play anymore. If there is one in particular that I<br/>\nshould avoid (have they ever finished the rogues?) please let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I get back online, I&#39;ll publish my character info to the list and I&#39;ll<br/>\ncertainly give a tell in game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\nDavid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
