So you can imagine I was a\r<br/>\nlittle surprised when a characer named &quot;Cokaine&quot; shows up.  Not only that, he&#39;s\r<br/>\nusing /ooc to carry on private conversations all over the place on Brell.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI /tell him to please use a channel for side chatter.  I won&#39;t repeate the\r<br/>\nresponse I got.  I warn him to cool it, or I /petition.  Use your imagination on\r<br/>\nthe response I got - and it was to store my goodies in a locked box either!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI give up and /petition.  This guy was really all over the place.  A few minutes\r<br/>\nlater, a GM pops up and tells me to not make false complaints!  I let him have\r<br/>\nboth barrels, and hard.  A minute later he comes back and tells me that in fact,\r<br/>\nCokaine is also known as Vampyre aka Jason White.  He&#39;s a GM!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI asked why he could get away this conduct.  The GM says &quot;he&#39;s had a bad day -\r<br/>\nhis wife died yesterday&quot;.  C&#39;mon - do I have &quot;Hello I&#39;m a stupid 14 year old&quot;\r<br/>\nwritten on my forehead?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNeedless to say, I&#39;ve sent a formal complaint in.  I&#39;d suggest that if you get\r<br/>\nsomeone who&#39;s just a bit too obnoxious, don&#39;t be suprised if it&#39;s a GM.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
