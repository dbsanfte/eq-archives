Soon, members of the Mystic Alliance will <br/>\nbe wandering the world of Norrath. Unfortunately, it will take me awhile to <br/>\nget the<br/>\n various chapters established on the servers that we need. I will be out of <br/>\ntown Aug. 7 -14 (argh! a whole week without EQ) but on Sunday the 15th, I <br/>\nhope to get<br/>\n the chapters set up.<br/>\n <br/>\n I will be the guildmaster on Brell Serillis, but I will need others to do <br/>\nthe same on the other servers. I know several of you have mentioned you&#39;d be <br/>\nwilling to<br/>\n do it, so please tell me again if you want to do it, and let me know which <br/>\nserver.<br/>\n <br/>\n I will attempt to get as many set up on Sunday the 15th, as I can.<br/>\n <br/>\n Thanks,<br/>\n David<br/>\n <br/>\n Dedric, lvl 9 gnome, Necro on Brell<br/>\n Kerik, lvl 3 High Elf, Enchanter on Brell &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be happy to be the guild master on the Bristlebane server.
