We have had a<br/>\nlot of new people join lately, and hope to keep growing.  :)<br/>\nI think we have something like 25 active members currently.  We are trying<br/>\nto work up a current members list to figure out how many people we really<br/>\nhave!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Terry Walker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mellowtigger@...\">mellowtigger@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_rainbow@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_rainbow@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 30, 2001 5:40 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_rainbow] Hello<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Yes I believe Rodcet is the largest collection of players<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m curious what a &quot;large collection&quot; means in &quot;gay EQ&quot; terms.  I keep<br/>\ntrying<br/>\n&gt; to compare our new guild with the uber-guilds on The Nameless server and<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; course we come up short.  But we usually have around 4 people online, with<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; many as 10.  Last weekend, I think, we grouped with our guildfriends (The<br/>\n&gt; Nameless of Mercy) at SolA and we had enough people to completely fill 2<br/>\n&gt; party groups.  I think that&#39;s an exceptional headcount for a guild that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; still less than half a year old.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cure my feelings of inadequacy as guildleader.  Tell me we&#39;re doing well<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;headcount&quot; test.
