(Baddies that<br/>\ndo that, that make themselve anonymous just piss me off.  Nothing personal<br/>\nbut I figure we need to at least see each other.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve just been killed five times in about five minutes.  This sucks.  I know it is<br/>\nsupposed to be hard, difficult, but this almost goes overboard.  Getting my <br/>\ncorpse took an hour, or I should say getting all of my corpses took an hour.<br/>\nAnd this is worth it?  I get a pet, a crappy harmtouch (I think the math is<br/>\npretty clear on this) the inability to bash with a dark reaver (my fault for picking <br/>\na human, but I just don&#39;t want to be an ogre/troll/darkelf), some spells that<br/>\ndon&#39;t look particularly special until I&#39;m 50th level (and for those of you who think <br/>\nthat we do get good weapons compared to paladins, the best weapon in the <br/>\ngame, firey avenger, is paladin only), and the pleasure of being waxed by any <br/>\ninkeeper that comes along.  I realize that some of this presents rolyplaying <br/>\nopportunity, but christ, what are the payoffs?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m looking for is a damn pep talk?  I&#39;m seriously considering dumping <br/>\nmyself and starting over as a paladin just because it has got to have a better <br/>\npayoff.  Somebody convince me not to.  Please.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;ll just change races.  Maybe I&#39;ll quite whining.  (I said this was a rant, <br/>\nafterall.)  Nah, I probably won&#39;t quite whining.<br/>\n<br/>\nSilkke<br/>\nVeeshan (maybe)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; This is a multi-part message in MIME format.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------=_NextPart_000_0009_01BE8D78.139CFD00<br/>\n&gt; Content-Type: text/plain;<br/>\n&gt; \tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Silkke:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of the reasons I decided to go with the Shadow Knight was because of =<br/>\n&gt; the higher level spells.

We get two =<br/>\n&gt; extremely useful spells: Feign Death (just ask any high level monk if =<br/>\n&gt; this is useful) and Gather Shadows (invisibility). We also get Heat =<br/>\n&gt; Blood (persistent damage), Endure Disease, Resist Cold, Wave of =<br/>\n&gt; Enfeeblement, and Voice Graft, which lets you speak through your pet =<br/>\n&gt; (hmmm... sounds funny)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Level 39 is big also. We get Banshee Aura (damage shield), Cancel Magic =<br/>\n&gt; (stops another caster&#39;s spell), Expulse Undead, Heart Flutter (very =<br/>\n&gt; cool, does persistent damage AND lowers Strength and AC), Augment Death, =<br/>\n&gt; Infectious Cloud and an extremely useful spell, Intensify Death, which =<br/>\n&gt; we cast on our pet so it regenerates and does more damage.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Level 49 is the last rank. We get some powerful spells here too. Invoke =<br/>\n&gt; Fear (causes fear in NPCs and enemies, upgrade of previous versions), =<br/>\n&gt; Shadow Sight, Breath of the Dead, Word of Shadows (radius damage), =<br/>\n&gt; Dismiss Undead, and what would be my all-time favorite, Boil Blood!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Not all these spells had descriptions, I wrote something wherever =<br/>\n&gt; possible.
