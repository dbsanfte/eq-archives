Now, every once in a while on Zek, as a<br/>\nNecromancer, I see the same thing, so its not just a SK issue. I&#39;m not sure<br/>\nwhether its a bug, but I&#39;ve also heard that pets will sometimes be less than<br/>\nwilling to attack something that cons red to them. My latest experience with<br/>\nthis was with Codil the Naked Monk outside Freeport. He was only yellow to<br/>\nme, and I&#39;d have taken him down, had my pet felt compelled to join me rather<br/>\nthan the other spectators. However, like you said, PvP is the only instance<br/>\nin which I&#39;ve seen this happen, never during combat with an NPC, which leads<br/>\nme to believe it&#39;s another one of Verant&#39;s little oversights.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if they did not intend pets to be used in PvP, they certainly need to<br/>\nchange some code, at least on Zek. If we can summon a pet, we should have<br/>\ncomplete control over it and it should attack anything we direct it to,<br/>\nwhether that something is a Large Rat or a Hill Giant.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalvolin(Tier&#39;Dal Necromancer)--Rallos Zek<br/>\nAzalin(Human Shadowknight...WHY won&#39;t they let me move him?!?!?)--Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Xillith ofNeriak &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xillith@...\">xillith@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, June 29, 1999 12:56 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_shadowknights] LOOK AT THIS VERY IMPORTANT SERIOUS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Xillith ofNeriak &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xillith@...\">xillith@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Fine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Point well made.  Yet, there is in fact a PvP server with unique rules not<br/>\n&gt;found on any of the others for PvP ballance.  Ok, I am calm again. Let me<br/>\n&gt;ask this of you:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How do you know what was intended upon design?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  We ARE ok in player vs monster.

That is foolish.  Regardless of what was &quot;intended&quot;.  We are<br/>\n&gt;the only class that cannot use all of our powers all of the time.  How do<br/>\n&gt;you justify that?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I will not complain again if the pet would just CONTRIBUTE, it makes THAT<br/>\n&gt;MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE!!  A single interrupt on a wizard, just ONE will allow<br/>\n&gt;me to flee or even consider fighting her!  Instead it just stands there<br/>\n&gt;looking silly as I die.  Against a Ranger or Paladin the pet has no<br/>\n&gt;offensive value BUT, do they know I am an SK if they haven&#39;t seen me?  Will<br/>\n&gt;they take the time to consider it and realize its green?  In either case,<br/>\n&gt;opening with the pet puts THE PET in their target window, not me.

As it stands, an SK in a<br/>\n&gt;duel is a foolish SK.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Roleplay IS infact what this game is about.  Teaming up and facing the<br/>\n&gt;unknown.

It is THEN that we are hurt.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I still love my DE female SK.

The paladin at level 30 with all his<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; buffs will have around 800hp&#39;s + Lay Hands gives him<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in essence 1600 hit points. Now if the SK uses his<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;mighty&quot; harm touch the paladin is down to 500 hit<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; points.  The two skills are VERY unequal.  HT does not<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; even com close to LH.  SK&#39;s are not weak but are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; inferior to paladins at this point.  And anyway why<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the heck do us Shadow Knights Get EXP PENALTIES?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Paladins get a BONUS while we get a PENALTY? Why do<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the evil classes get the EXP penalties?  All of my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; friends started the same time i did they are level 21<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; i am level 15 because of the EXP and i have played<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; more then them.  The EXP penaltis are stupid as they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; serve no roleplaying service and EQ is a roleplaying game.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt;&gt;----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What do fashion and football have in common?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
