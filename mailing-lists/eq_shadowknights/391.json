This makes sense, to me, because the Soulfire<br/>\nsword has been found(Implemented) for the Paladins and it is a quest nodrop<br/>\nitem. So maybe there is a quest someplace that can shed some light on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Nuluk(E&#39;ci)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Ok, fair enough.  I&#39;m assuming that it&#39;s location remains secret, and<br/>\n&gt; that I won&#39;t have to worry about it for about 20 more levels =) (I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; almost 22 now)  Did they mention what zone it is in?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Still though, a fine blade, and everyone needs a long term quest<br/>\n&gt; (holy grail).  One thing I&#39;d like to see is a blade that has an<br/>\n&gt; aura of darkness around it, in opposition to light generating items,<br/>\n&gt; but most likely that would be very difficult to code, and the few<br/>\n&gt; human SK&#39;s might get upset, but then again they&#39;d have deadeye by<br/>\n&gt; the time they got it most likely.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Xilith<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
