Being a hybrid with downtime equaling a Warrior, obviously,<br/>\nseem unfair. But other than the downtime and the useless, class-specific<br/>\nskill (HT), I believe that the SK is one of the most interesting class to<br/>\nplay. In fact, I would go on to say that we can do the most damage out of<br/>\nall melee classes in a fight with an NPC (Double Attack + Pet + DoT = mega<br/>\ndamage). I also believe that it is not too overly important to travel before<br/>\nlevel 30. For many levels, I have never needed to travel anywhere that would<br/>\nkill me on sight. There are always places to fight up to level 30; at which<br/>\npoint, we do actually get Gather Shadows. Now, I will address Mr. Stovall&#39;s<br/>\npost:<br/>\n<br/>\nScenario 1:<br/>\nWhat is the first DoT that the Shadow Knight would use? Engulfing Darkness.<br/>\nWhat is the first spell the Paladin would use? Flash of Light. Now, let&#39;s<br/>\nassume they both go off. No resists, no fizzles, no interruption. The SK is<br/>\nblinded, the Paladin is free to kill the pet. Once the pet is gone, Paladin<br/>\nblinds the Shadow Knight again, repeat until SK is dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nScenario 2:<br/>\nLet&#39;s assume that Engulfing Darkness is casted upon the Paladin. The Paladin<br/>\nwould just fight the SK and the pet. The pet&#39;s attack = Center + Spirit<br/>\nArmor. So, it is basically down to LH versus HT + DoT. And as we all know,<br/>\nHT and a 100HP DoT does not compensate for LH.<br/>\n<br/>\nScenario 3:<br/>\nLet&#39;s consider what you said in your scenario. The pet is gone and Paladin<br/>\nhas taken more damage. Is the Shadow Knight able to get the Paladin down to<br/>\nthe point where the HT will defeat the Paladin? No. It might have took 5<br/>\nrounds at most to finish off the pet; thus, the Paladin is far from being<br/>\ndead (during that time, the Paladin might have lost 200HP at most -<br/>\nconsidering that all the arrows hit and DoT). Once the pet is gone, the<br/>\nbattle turns over. All the Paladin needs to do is to Blind, Root and Heal.<br/>\nThat was excluding Center and Spirit Armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I do not see why the Paladin would go for the SK when he/she<br/>\nknows that the pet is the main disrupter of spells. In addition, you failed<br/>\nto consider that a Paladin can also have a bow. With the combination Blind,<br/>\nRoot, shoot and Heal, the Paladin is always one step ahead of the Shadow<br/>\nKnight in fights. Basically, the reason why a Paladin will defeat a SK is<br/>\nbecause of a few simply spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for winning unrigged fights with red-cons, I really find that hard to<br/>\nbelieve. Red-cons would resisted Darkness, Fear and Harm Touch. The Harm<br/>\nTouch will not compensate for their LH at that point. Furthermore, at higher<br/>\nlevels, they are able to hit more often with higher damage; while taking<br/>\nless hits. I can see a Shadow Knight defeating red-con Warriors and Monks.<br/>\nHowever, looking at all the above factors makes me disbelieve that a Paladin<br/>\ncan lose to a blue-formidable-con Shadow Knight at best. Perhaps you have a<br/>\nstrategy that I do not see? Or perhaps the Paladin was on the way to<br/>\nretrieve his/her corpse?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I disagree.  I&#39;m on Rallos Zek, PvP.  What an SK does while rooted is fire<br/>\n&gt;his bow, send his pet, and stack his DoTs.  Fletching is a very, very<br/>\n&gt;important ability that usually gets overlooked.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In the same scenario the SK have a 30+ damage bow.  He gets rooted, starts<br/>\n&gt;firing arrows.  The pet gets up in the paladin&#39;s face - good for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>disruption.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The paladin has 2 choices.  Deal with the SK or deal with the pet.  If he<br/>\n&gt;deals with the pet, obviously the SK will tear the crap out of him.  So<br/>\n&gt;he&#39;ll attack the SK.  While he&#39;s trying to blind, he gets hit with an<br/>\n </span></blockquote>arrow,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;bashed by a pet, etc which has a good chance of spell disruption, and gets<br/>\n&gt;Engulfed in darkness.  If he gets the blind, he&#39;ll probably waste the pet<br/>\n&gt;while your blinded.  By the time the root&#39;s over, the paladin notices he<br/>\n </span></blockquote>has<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;taken more damage, and is currently slowed with a pissed off SK in his<br/>\n </span></blockquote>face.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;These kinds of things won&#39;t work you say?  I&#39;ve never lost a fight with a<br/>\n&gt;paladin, even yellow and red ones. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
