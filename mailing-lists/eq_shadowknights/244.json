","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-226214445\">Damon:<br/>\n<br/>\nNPCs hit for MORE than anyone at their level. Why does Dark Elf Corporals<br/>\ncon green to me, yet, they would hit someone of my level for over 70 damage?<br/>\nAnd when someone kills the Corporal, they drop a bronze weapon?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, to the contents of your post:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said, &quot;Thats a pretty damn bad level 40+ person there.  Probably a dark<br/>\nelf :P&quot;. Yes, it is a Dark Elf, but our str DOES NOT add 100 damage to our<br/>\nhits. It was interesting to hear you say, &quot;Just goes to show your<br/>\nineptitude&quot;. Actually, you are the one that is wrong. NPCs DO NOT have the<br/>\nsame stats we have.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout your claim upon seeing a level 20 doing 100 damage is, to put it<br/>\nbluntly, a lie.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou seem to have an inexhaustible list of untrue facts. I will respond to<br/>\nyour<br/>\nlatest post, but please do not give any more arguments until you have<br/>\nevidence that what you have said is true. When that time comes, I will<br/>\ngladly take back my words - if what you say is indeed accurate (but alas,<br/>\nthey won&#39;t be).<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - I would like to say that I love your calculations. A level 20 would<br/>\nhave a 4x multiplier to the weapon attack value (i.e.. &quot;a level 20 warrior<br/>\nwith the executioners axe can do 100 damage, 4 x 25&quot;), but a level 30 ranger<br/>\nis okay to have a 3x multiplier with a Demon Claw . . . And I had a laugh<br/>\nwhen you said that Demon Claws are low level for Rangers simply because they<br/>\nhave a attack of 5 - that absolutely demonstrates your knowledge in weapons.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
