Whom is that? Should be<br/>\na very high level SK, because you would think he/she would know what they<br/>\nare talking about, and Verant would at least take them somewhat seriously.<br/>\nOr do we flood Verant with e-mail?<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion how did the Paladins get their changes made?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we flood we need to have a general topic (shouldn&#39;t send a form letter to<br/>\nthem). So we address:<br/>\n1) weak pet. what do we want done? we get an even level pet?  Need answers<br/>\non this from people.<br/>\n2) harm touch resistance. should be none, since is was bestowed upon us by a<br/>\ngod? right? I didn&#39;t have a choice on god&#39;s therefor it must be a god thing<br/>\nright?<br/>\n3) want healing. at what level do we want it? 22? 15? 29? what level is it<br/>\nfeasible, according to necro spells.<br/>\n4) exp point penalty. have no comment on this, other than that&#39;s life.<br/>\n5) bad faction. same no comment. (or lack of any thing to say about it)<br/>\n6) Invisibility at level 22. (rather be 15, just because I am 15, and that<br/>\nis why if one person speaks for us it should be done by a level 45+ SK,<br/>\ndon&#39;t know of anyone that high though)<br/>\n7) did I miss anything?<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way if someone has the e-mail address, or how the paladins got their<br/>\nchanges let us know.  All I have seen/heard are complaints and I would like<br/>\nto change this and that. Someone actually know how? Would hate to just<br/>\naggravate Verant, and have them just deleting messages from us.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry about all the question, just don&#39;t see anything progressing from this<br/>\nstring.  Some high level SK stand up and take charge, and inform us lower<br/>\nlevel characters.  Information is power.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\nTenin - lvl 15 Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Xillith ofNeriak &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xillith@...\">xillith@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 30, 1999 12:02 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_shadowknights] LOOK AT THIS VERY IMPORTANT SERIOUS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Xillith ofNeriak &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xillith@...\">xillith@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks hon,<br/>\n     Lets take it to Verant and see what they think.  I&#39;m sure we will not<br/>\nraise any new complaints but at least we can complain in a civil and<br/>\norganised fashion.  I noticed an earlier post on this board regarding<br/>\nforming a petition, lets all put in our two cents.  I&#39;ve gotten attached to<br/>\nthe SK and would really like to see it pan out as a fully respected class.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Xillith </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
