Let see where should I begin....<br/>\n<br/>\nI like (not love) my shadowknight (Tenin).  My 2 biggest problems right now<br/>\nabout this class is:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I have played him for 16 days and only 16th level.  You might ask what<br/>\nthe problem is.  I started a Shaman out 5 playing days ago and he is now<br/>\n16th level.  Last night I had 2 guild invites and my SK never had one (until<br/>\nI asked a guild, get into that in a moment).  The only reason I started a<br/>\nShaman because I heard they were wanted in groups, and I always had a rough<br/>\ntime finding anyone who wanted to group with me.  Anyway found a guild that<br/>\nlet me join and asked if anyone wanted to form a group or could I join,<br/>\nnever got a response back, so I end up soloing, which everyone knows the<br/>\nproblems with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Armor.  In east commons and &quot;/auction WTB banded armor&quot; and have never<br/>\ngotten a response.  Now I have heard of suits selling for around 75 plat but<br/>\nnever could find anyone selling any banded.  OK back to guild, &quot;do we have<br/>\nany one making banded armor&quot; ... &quot;yes it is xxxx, and should be on tonight&quot;<br/>\nwell suffice it to say they never were on that night or any other time that<br/>\nI was on.  So I still am running around in leather, with a SBH that I bought<br/>\nfrom someone for 100 plat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI normally don&#39;t get upset at things, but this I feel is just insane.  I was<br/>\nreading on another list that Brian/Veriant thinks SK Troll/Orge is fine but<br/>\nthe DE/Human is just screwed but any type of modification other than<br/>\nequipment would make the entire class unbalanced.  He/They (whomever) found<br/>\nthat the Mage Tank (anti-paladin) was unacceptable, and was a scary thing to<br/>\nsee.... hmm... aren&#39;t we suppose to be?  Personally I would think that if<br/>\nyou have a higher experience penalty you should be stronger than the other<br/>\nclasses that don&#39;t have the penalty.  Anyway, until something is done where<br/>\nI can get armor that is worth anything (because I can&#39;t take the hits from<br/>\nthe MOB&#39;s anymore) I will be packing Tenin away for a while, maybe will get<br/>\nback to him someday when I can tweak him out or something, whatever needs to<br/>\nbe done I don&#39;t see any other route other than tweaking. (truthfully really<br/>\nhate saying that because I shouldn&#39;t have to do that, but I feel I have been<br/>\nforced into it).<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, last thing... sniped it out but you said that the zombie is like blue to<br/>\na level 33, lets just say I will never be able to kill it at 16, so that<br/>\nisn&#39;t a solution for me.  The complete heal would be nice, especially if the<br/>\nlady could recharge that too. (by the way where is Gix?)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has any suggestions I would be willing to listen, but I think I<br/>\nhave given up on him for the time being.<br/>\n<br/>\nTenin-Tarew Marr<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Xillith ofNeriak [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xillith@...\">xillith@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 07, 1999 12:49 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_shadowknights] Digest Number 81<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Xillith ofNeriak&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xillith@...\">xillith@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nFor all you young SKs out there, DONT GIVE UP!!!  I almost quit in disgust<br/>\nmany times and I am on a PvP server, so I have that to deal with at times as<br/>\nwell.  But I love my charecter so much I stuck with it.  The SK suffers SO<br/>\nmuch at low levels, but once you crest over 20 and get your dual attack, and<br/>\nthen 22 where you get some minor healing and other usefull spells if you&#39;re<br/>\nrescourcefull...there is no looking back.  I often have 130 dammage sets if<br/>\nI DONT reposte, and no dual wield weapons anyone can get untwinked at my<br/>\nlevel come close to compeating.  Our pet now contributes in PvP (THEY<br/>\nLISTENED!!) and I find my class being more welcome in groups than the<br/>\npaladin or ranger.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;unsnip&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
