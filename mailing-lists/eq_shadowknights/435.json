I almost quit in <br/>\n&gt;disgust<br/>\n&gt; &gt; many times and I am on a PvP server, so I have that to deal with at <br/>\n&gt;times<br/>\n&gt;as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; well.  But I love my charecter so much I stuck with it.  The SK suffers <br/>\n&gt;SO<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much at low levels, but once you crest over 20 and get your dual attack,<br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then 22 where you get some minor healing and other usefull spells if<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rescourcefull...there is no looking back.  I often have 130 dammage sets<br/>\n&gt;if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I DONT reposte, and no dual wield weapons anyone can get untwinked at my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level come close to compeating.  Our pet now contributes in PvP (THEY<br/>\n&gt; &gt; LISTENED!!) and I find my class being more welcome in groups than the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; paladin or ranger.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; PvP?  Dont get me started.  We rule.  Warrior with big whacker and pet =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; move along to next target.  Our ability to Shadowstep and lay layer <br/>\n&gt;after<br/>\n&gt; &gt; layer of DoT is truely dreaded, and the harm touch means I dont have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; personaly kill them all the way.  PvP with other tanks is tough due to<br/>\n&gt;their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hit points and resistances, but I eat casters for lunch (except those <br/>\n&gt;damn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enchanters, they suck!  But Pumice Stones are a spiffy solution to <br/>\n&gt;Charm)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wow, I am just going on and on!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Enough.  Lets revive this board and get the newer players in the swing <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the best class in all of Norrath, the dreaded Shadowknight!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok Xill, you convinced me. My next character was gonna be an Enchanter, now<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m gonna try a Shadowknight again instead.:)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Malvolin(Teir&#39;Dal Necromancer on Rallos Zek; Formerly Azalin, Human<br/>\n&gt;Shadowknight on Veeshan(whose name was for some reason rejected by the<br/>\n&gt;server last night))<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
