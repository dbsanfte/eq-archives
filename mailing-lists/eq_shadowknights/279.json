On E&#39;ci, we work as a team.  I just started another Knight of the Shadows and received some help from a Necromancer on my first attempt to kill.  I quickly joined with this person and went on a killing spree.  I have never leveled up so quickly with any other character.  I started getting called a tank at level 3.  We Knights of the Dark love chaos and mayhem but do not need to hate.  Let others hate us while we conquer the lands in the name of our dark lord.  On E&#39;ci, we even receive the occasional assistance from others who are not of our ranks.  Let them fear us but don&#39;t hate them for their ignorance.  On E&#39;ci, we believe that all beings have their places (some six feet under ground).  Just thought I would put in my two copper.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhalisha<br/>\nDark Elf, Knight of the Shadows<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tAdam Slayden [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slade_66@...\">slade_66@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tFriday, June 18, 1999 4:50 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[eq_shadowknights] Fwd: Re: [eq_shadowknights] Dark Elf SK<br/>\n<br/>\nAh... I too tried Ralloz Zek. Now the other servers pale in comparison. <br/>\nRallos Zek is the only TRUE EQ experience I beleive... as being evil on easy <br/>\nservers poses such minimal risk. I mean, I&#39;ve even seen screenshots of <br/>\nTrolls and high elves and the like partying together! There&#39;s a butchered <br/>\ndwarf in Grobb and more than half a dozen in Oggok, and they&#39;re there for a <br/>\nreason! They eat them!!! This would make any true RP grind their teeth, as I <br/>\ndo. If you care to take a glance at your character description as a <br/>\nOrge/Troll SK, you&#39;ll notice you&#39;re on blade-to-blade terms with <br/>\neachother... something I heard nary a word on the easy servers, I bet some <br/>\nof you possibly even FORGOT. I know this doesn&#39;t apply to you, Chan, but if <br/>\nan Ogre or Troll SK had a twinked OR sold DR on RZ... they wouldn&#39;t have it <br/>\nfor long. Oh, I have stories of raids on Freeport, and invasions in the <br/>\nswamp, but I&#39;ll not get into them here unless someone asks, but here&#39;s a <br/>\nscreenshot I took myself of what occurs in Freeport on a near-daily basis. <br/>\n(this was taken during my exceedingly brief campaign as a DESK (had to lower <br/>\nres. due to hotmail&#39;s file size limit))<br/>\n<br/>\n                                   -Dreath TSK, defender of the swamp<br/>\n                                   -Grolm, Troll Warrior<br/>\n                                   -Ralel, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n                                   -formerly Vaed, Eru Necro<br/>\n                                   -and a couple more<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

Although on<br/>\n&gt;Rallos Zek, the mighty rule the land.  A weaker Shadow Knight with a weapon<br/>\n&gt;such as the Dark Reaver would definitely be a target to many of the raw PK<br/>\n&gt;(Player Killer) guilds, as the weapon would sell for several hundred plat<br/>\n&gt;simply because lower Guk is HELL and no one deserves the pain involved in<br/>\n&gt;camping it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am a member of the Blood Coven on Rallos Zek, a guild of DE females sworn<br/>\n&gt;to defend DE purity.  I have killed many Tier&#39;Dal traitors and I have seen<br/>\n&gt;the item lust and covetous nature of many players.  I was simply and<br/>\n&gt;realistically stating that you must be prepared to defend your wealth and<br/>\n&gt;yourself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just cannot comprehend a Role Play world where I can carry around my best<br/>\n&gt;gear all of  the time and never worry about High Elf raiders seeking blood<br/>\n&gt;retribution or Dwarven clansmen initiating their young on my dark blood.<br/>\n&gt;You want to play Shadow Knights?  Play one on Rallos Zek, I dare you.  You<br/>\n&gt;will never know what evil races can do until you have seen Darkenbane and<br/>\n&gt;the Horde ( DEs, Ogres, and Trolls) grind their way through all of the<br/>\n&gt;players and many of the guards ( sometimes merchants ) in West Freeport.<br/>\n&gt;The human newbee zone is a graveyard.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well said!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;THIS is why I am a Dark Elf, I am the Vanguard of evil.  The Dark Tower in <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;world of light.  Neriak and The Nectulos forest are inviolate, as they were<br/>\n&gt;meant to be.  Many players on the server are poor but NO ONE can say that <br/>\n&gt;we<br/>\n&gt;haven&#39;t earned every copper.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tell you a story.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You just don&#39;t know what it means to be an evil race until you zone into<br/>\n&gt;East Commons from Nectulos, and stand face to face with a six-pack of 16th<br/>\n&gt;level High Elf wizards...powering up.  The knock back saved my life, as I<br/>\n&gt;zoned once again, with 18 life.  Shadow Step put over half the zone between<br/>\n&gt;them and me with three leaps and the alarm went out.  The response was<br/>\n&gt;staggering.  Newbies zoned into the commons to be spotters since they could<br/>\n&gt;not be attacked and a respectable force collected, zoned, and beat their<br/>\n&gt;ass.  They never returned and two of the bodies are still there in the <br/>\n&gt;dirt,<br/>\n&gt;twisted by a half dozen harm touches.  Lucky for me a Freeport and Northern<br/>\n&gt;Ro raid was forming that day, as scheduled, and I caught their muster.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Such is life on Rallos Zek, war and hate made real.  The difference between<br/>\n&gt;my server and ALL of the others is RESPECT.  You respect your people, or<br/>\n&gt;they hunt you into deletion.  You respect your enemies<br/>\n&gt;( and you have a bunch ) or they will over run you.  Guild tags begin to<br/>\n&gt;mean something, typically the difference between relief and a rapid retreat<br/>\n&gt;or the bagging of your favorite thingies.  Weight allowance??  BAH!  I keep<br/>\n&gt;two backpacks empty incase I come across a pair of frisky halfling Druids <br/>\n&gt;or<br/>\n&gt;for ANY excursion into East and West Nam...er...Commons.  I have come <br/>\n&gt;across<br/>\n&gt;extremely rare loot that I outright sold wile thinking &quot; By the time I can<br/>\n&gt;defend this item, I can camp for it myself.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Rallos Zek, an equipment inspection is often followed by a fire ball<br/>\n&gt;instead of a &quot;cool gear&quot; compliment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just cannot explain the experiences on Rallos Zek with words.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You will quickly realise that friends and race are more important than<br/>\n&gt;stats and encumbrance.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The words fly truer than any arrow...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mages in my party hold my loot, and all<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;of the<br/>\n&gt;good armour and weapons goes to us tanks since we keep them alive.
