There is one guard on the way that must avoid.  He is kind of hidden too, but once you know where he is, he can be avoided by hugging the wall opposite his location.  He killed me twice when I was still learning the ropes.  From the Blackburrow entrance, take da right path.  Da guard is at da end of da canyon past a pair of trees.  Once past the guard, head east across da two frozen rivers.  Da entrance to permafrost is on da east wall.  Der are two guard towers on da Halas side of da rivers dat should be avoided.  Oder den dat it safe, I never once saw a wandering guard.  Also, beware of da ice giants at da entrance to Permafrost.  Have fun, me did.<br/>\n<br/>\nScragg of Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
