Also you comparison of hp and the like is not fair because there are diffrent races and truth be told if you picked the best SK race ( Ogre ) and the best Paladin race ( Dwarf ) then you should easily have more hp then the paladin. Shadow Knights are a great class. Necromancers use Engulfing Darkness and Heaty Blood up until level 29 if they can figure out away to put there spells to good use then a Tank should easily be able to.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
