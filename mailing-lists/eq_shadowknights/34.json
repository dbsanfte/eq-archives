Supposedly, our spells also get more powerful the higher in leverl we get.  <br/>\nSo we come into our own around 30-40th level.  I have no idea if it&#39;s worth it <br/>\nand, no matter how you cut it, lay hands is superiour to harm touch.  I&#39;d like to <br/>\nsee some discussion as to what does make our class exceptional in addition <br/>\nto its roleplaying posibilites.  Do our unholy weapons compare to the holy <br/>\nswords?  Anyone seen one of them?

I been <br/>\n&gt; harm touch in theory is friggin, great, especially at lower levels. But as <br/>\n&gt; people get higher levels say level 30, to times 30 giving a 300hp harmtouch <br/>\n&gt; is in now way going to be as worthwhile as lay on hands giving a level 30 <br/>\n&gt; Paladin their 700-800 odd hp back! What&#39;s more, harmtouch CAN be resisted <br/>\n&gt; either totaly or partialy. Also on the EQlizer site, it says basically that <br/>\n&gt; the lev 15 spells we get aren&#39;t all that useful. That said we are supposidly <br/>\n&gt; 3/4 warrior and 1/4 necro &lt;g&gt; but perhaps we should get a lil more power for <br/>\n&gt; being SO damn neglected by society, and we dont even have inviso to visit <br/>\n&gt; those exotic locations as the necros do!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; tell me what ya think and appologies for typos, im not proofreading im tired <br/>\n&gt; : P<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jorval Human Level 13 Shadowknight, Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; You can now easily share photos and documents with your fellow list members<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out our homepage for details on how to use our new shared files feature!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
