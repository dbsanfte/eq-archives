The paladin at level 30 with all his buffs","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1767588544\">First off for all you scenario makers and hit<br/>\npoint compareres the the paladin would beat the crap<br/>\nout of an SK. The paladin at level 30 with all his<br/>\nbuffs will have around 800hp&#39;s + Lay Hands gives him<br/>\nin essence 1600 hit points. Now if the SK uses his<br/>\n&quot;mighty&quot; harm touch the paladin is down to 500 hit<br/>\npoints.  The two skills are VERY unequal.  HT does not<br/>\neven com close to LH.  SK&#39;s are not weak but are<br/>\ninferior to paladins at this point.  And anyway why<br/>\nthe heck do us Shadow Knights Get EXP PENALTIES?<br/>\nPaladins get a BONUS while we get a PENALTY? Why do<br/>\nthe evil classes get the EXP penalties?  All of my<br/>\nfriends started the same time i did they are level 21<br/>\ni am level 15 because of the EXP and i have played<br/>\nmore then them.  The EXP penaltis are stupid as they<br/>\nserve no roleplaying service and EQ is a roleplaying game.<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
