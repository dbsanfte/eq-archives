Because the<br/>\nvendors that sell them do not like us. However, a Shiny Brass Halberd is<br/>\nalready better than a Combine Two Handed Sword, so there is no need for you<br/>\nto get a Combine.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you are level 20 or higher, you will see yourself doing more damage<br/>\nwith your Halberd. However, if you are above 20, I suggest you go to<br/>\nBefallen and camp for the Bone-Bladed Claymore (which could be put into a<br/>\nbag).<br/>\n<br/>\nRune Totem Staves can be obtained easily at Gnoll Shamans at Lake Rathe, you<br/>\ncan also get small bronze armor off of Dry Bone Skeletons at the same place<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPsion:<br/>\n<br/>\nSome players could have easily gotten you a Fine Steel weapon for 5pp. Right<br/>\nnow, however, I think you should start saving up for banded armor. After you<br/>\nhave a full suit of it, a BBC (200pp) should be your next goal. When you<br/>\nhave reached mid 20s, you should go to Najena to collect large bronze pieces<br/>\noff of Ogre captains. At high 20s, you should go camp for the Journeyman<br/>\nBoots that is also in Najena (Jboots are not tradable; therefore, you must<br/>\nloot it yourself).</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
