OK, Can&#39;t really travel effectively,<br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t rely on HT, Pet gets wacked it 7 or 8 hits (haven&#39;t tried new pet<br/>\n&gt;yet), No magic wepon.  OK, I see cleics using their summon 1h blunt hitting<br/>\n&gt;wisp that are green to me, can I kill one(?), no... considering that my <br/>\n&gt;only<br/>\n&gt;damage spell is disease cloud (5pts whoppy!).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was in fire storm yesterday for about 4 hours and felt like a big anchor.<br/>\n&gt;My group was getting hit by elemental and all I could do their was just be <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;hp sponge by trying to taunt while the magic classes attacked it.  Oh, and <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;was level 14, the highest in the group.  But thinking about it now fighters<br/>\n&gt;would also be sitting on the side lines in this area.  I know a 12 lvl <br/>\n&gt;magic<br/>\n&gt;user who used root in this area and pushed himself up to like level 15 or <br/>\n&gt;16<br/>\n&gt;in a week or two (I will admit he was on for a very long time), he is now<br/>\n&gt;like level 25.  Just kind of disappointing, not that I am going to give it<br/>\n&gt;up, because people tell me that it gets better around level 22, but I agree<br/>\n&gt;with the post that we should get the invisibility spell at 22, plus a<br/>\n&gt;serious DoT spell just for making it to that level.  Anyway maybe we should<br/>\n&gt;get a shadow knight only spell of some kind, make 1 or 2  for each spell<br/>\n&gt;levels and make it a quest of some kind.  Maybe a Direct Damage spell like<br/>\n&gt;harm touch is, but it just uses mana (but not the same damage amount),  or <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;radius damage spell (thought those were cool looking), or how about a <br/>\n&gt;radius<br/>\n&gt;life tap that give us hp back from all creatures around us ... just watch<br/>\n&gt;out for your party!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also just wanted to ask, has anyone completed the quest for Sir Lindel<br/>\n&gt;(something of the effect)  I found him last night, attacked him, he ran<br/>\n&gt;away, I started to follow then he vanished, I had no lag, and nothing <br/>\n&gt;killed<br/>\n&gt;him because he was still my target.  So, I waited for him to return.  He<br/>\n&gt;came back full hit points, I attacked him again, he ran again, then I<br/>\n&gt;started to follow him and then vanished again,  no lag, still targeted so<br/>\n&gt;nothing had killed him.  Again he comes back, I get hit by an elemental <br/>\n&gt;from<br/>\n&gt;behind, moved so elemental wasn&#39;t hitting me from behind, elemental and him<br/>\n&gt;start attacking each other ... elemental kills him... grrr.  I don&#39;t under<br/>\n&gt;stand why he vanished but now I have engulfing darkness, which I will use,<br/>\n&gt;but just wondered what you will get when completing the quest... magic<br/>\n&gt;weapon (I hope)? or just more faction bonus.  Also does anyone know where <br/>\n&gt;he<br/>\n&gt;spawns at or is it just random?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;David<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
