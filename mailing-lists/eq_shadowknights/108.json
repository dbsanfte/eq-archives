Something that the<br/>\nother fighters cannot do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot give you reasons on why to be a Knight of the Shadows. I like what<br/>\nI do, I like who I am. When people ask what I am, I call out that I am a<br/>\nKnight. we may be shadow knights, but we are knights nevertheless. Knights<br/>\nwith dark powers rearing over our heads. Although it may seem that we are<br/>\nweak compared to many of the other classes, there has hardly been very high<br/>\nlevel knights to truelly know if the class is weak or strong in the later<br/>\nlevels. This I want to see for myself. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy Knight of the Shadows is my first, and primary character since<br/>\ncommercial, and I am sticking with it til 50th at least. If the cap is not<br/>\noff by then, then more than likely i&#39;m gonna go try a Rogue, and I hope<br/>\ntheir abilities are fully implemented by then.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot give a reason why you should be a knight, I can only give you<br/>\nreasons why I like being a knight...everyone has different tastes in style<br/>\nand gore.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes to race, I don&#39;t recommend the dark elf...surely dark elves<br/>\nare &quot;cool&quot;, but they have some of the weakest stats. If your gonna solo<br/>\nalot, altho I dont recommend, be a Troll. on the other hand troll and<br/>\nespecially dark elven knights are almost quite common, you dont see many<br/>\nogre knights, nor, especially, human knights, which are quite rare indeed. <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for my babblin...hope everyone picks the right course for their<br/>\nknight, or if not, goodluck to you without your knighthood.<br/>\n<br/>\nKael Deathwind<br/>\nKnight of the Shadows<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mblackburn@...\">mblackburn@...</a><br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eq_shadowknights] Why<br/>\n&gt; Date: Sunday, May 09, 1999 3:32 PM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mblackburn@...\">mblackburn@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Things have been quite lately, and I&#39;ve been wondering something: why do <br/>\n&gt; people choose to play shadowknights?
