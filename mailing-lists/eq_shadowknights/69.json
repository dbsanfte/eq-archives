If the <br/>\nPaladin is of a similar level to you, and even if you&#39;re givin the luxury of <br/>\nsummoning your pet before the battle, it would only take a Paladin a couple <br/>\nof spells or some slashes to take down your low leveled pet. Sure, that would <br/>\ngive you time to beat up on them and have the upper hand for most of the <br/>\nfight. But as i&#39;ve found in dueling Paladins, when they get low they use lay <br/>\non hands and even if you immediatly rip off harm touch, they proceed to stay <br/>\non top of the fight, as your harmtouch doesnt match the amount of hps they <br/>\ngot back from lay on hands.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
