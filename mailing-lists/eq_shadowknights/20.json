I&#39;ve looted my corpse at the bottom of the ocean just off the<br/>\ncoast of Norther Ro.  Had to come up for air a few times.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2) How long will your corpse stay in the game after<br/>\n&gt;you die?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Depends on your level.  I think if you&#39;re level 4 or lower it is a matter<br/>\nof hours.  Levels 5+ it&#39;s a matter of days.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3)  Will your corpse remain in the game after you sign<br/>\n&gt;off, and if so for how long?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See #2.
