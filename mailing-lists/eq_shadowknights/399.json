He said that he saw someone<br/>\nwith a sword called a Soul Reaver. It is believed that the Soul Reaver has<br/>\nthe stats of 20/32. It is also claimed to look similar to the Fiery Avenger,<br/>\nexcept that there is a mist surrounding the blade. Does anyone have any info<br/>\non it? All of a sudden, my Dark Reaver seems to be swinger slower today . .<br/>\n. hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nyes i have heard of this sword it is a quest weapon but i do not know where or how to start the quest</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
