I suppose a group of paladins<br/>\ngot together and /petitioned to have some way to attack us SK&#39;s at a<br/>\ndistance and got what they wanted, I don&#39;t know.  But your point about<br/>\npaladins supposedly being honorable enough NOT to use a bow, is a good one<br/>\neven if it is (dare I say it?) role playing more than anything else.  A good<br/>\nmajority of paladin&#39;s players out there are not really playing paladins as<br/>\nthey are playing warriors with spellcasting abilities.  The same rings true<br/>\nfor many SK players.  I will not get into the role-play/powergame debate<br/>\nhere, but suffice it to say, a lot of things fall by the wayside once people<br/>\nstart to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrakhan of Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Damon Grimfiend &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grimfiend_loa@...\">grimfiend_loa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 28, 1999 1:28 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_shadowknights] LOOK AT THIS VERY IMPORTANT SERIOUS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Damon Grimfiend &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grimfiend_loa@...\">grimfiend_loa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe I was wrong in my previous post, but when did paladins get bows?
