Because we cannot hit for as much damage as a ranger, nor do we<br/>\nhave heals to heal ourselve after battle, we need to use other tactics to<br/>\nwin. The way to do this is to strategically use the darkness, fear, syphon,<br/>\ndisease spells that we have. From this, I have a tendency to relay more on<br/>\nmagic than others. In other words, intelligence plays a heavier role in our<br/>\nclass than one would think. Dark Elf, being the most intelligent of the<br/>\ngiven races, thus provide a tool for victory. In addition, Dark Elves Shadow<br/>\nKnight looks sooooooooooooo cool with black armor and a scythe (too bad the<br/>\nDark Reaver is not a scythe . . . ).<br/>\nTo compare Troll with a DE, Trolls get killed on sight in some places,<br/>\nwhereas Dark Elves are spared from death. Nevertheless, they each have their<br/>\nown good. But in the end, it all depends on how you play and how cool you<br/>\nwant to look.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I am curious as well. I had a 13th level troll shadowknight and ended up<br/>\n&gt;quiting it because I got sick of kill stealers on the Rathe (play on RK<br/>\n&gt;now). I had the thought that trolls made the best SK bar none because of<br/>\n&gt;regenerate and the ability to bash with a two handed sword; but now am<br/>\n&gt;thinking dark elf just because of I like the image. (but no bash unless<br/>\n&gt;using a shield). Ah well. So all you dark elves the question is why? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
