Just <br/>\nwondered if any of ya knew about the SK magic weapons? As one of few <br/>\nShadowknights on my server, i havnt really found anyone that knows hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso in reply to one of ya was talking about Shadowknights&#39; power... i <br/>\nrecently had a fight with a Paladin &lt;eg&gt; in the freeport area... it was very <br/>\nclose, i&#39;ll give a quick battle report.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe entered the Arena and i told him to hang on a sec... he was anon but i <br/>\nconed him and he was a gamble to me (me being lev 11), i told him 1 sec again <br/>\nand summoned my pet, it fizzled so i waited a bit &lt;eg&gt; then summoned him, i <br/>\nthen yelled go and had my pet charge him. I hit him with siphon strength and <br/>\nDisease cloud, then, as he was beating up on my skelie charged into the fray. <br/>\nThe battle was long but i was always on top, we were both getting lower and <br/>\nlower but he was looking like dying sooner then me. He was hitting me with, <br/>\nwhats it called brilliant light or something? Well the spell makes your <br/>\nscreen go all black which isnt too good.. but i contined to fight and, as i <br/>\nsay, was winning. Anyway he was getting really low, i had about 2.5 bubbles <br/>\nleft he had 1, i got another few big hits in, then all of a sudden, he casts <br/>\nlay on hands! ARRg, he&#39;s back to full hps and im on like  2 bubbles. Screw <br/>\nthis i think, and calling upon Innoruuk... i hit him with harmtouch for about <br/>\n110 hps...we battle on again, much similar to before except now tis him with <br/>\nthe upper hand. Finally as he himself is near death he gets a few hits in, in <br/>\na row and im knocked unconcious. He turns and battles my pet, just as he <br/>\nkills it, i come around, i hit him for 16 and it was looking like whoever got <br/>\nthe next hit in would win... alas it was he &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all though a brilliant fight. And when i found out he was level 13, <br/>\ntwo levels above me, i was well chuffed  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw nice one on whoever set up the mailing list, hope to hear from more SKs <br/>\nsoon!<br/>\n<br/>\nJorval</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
