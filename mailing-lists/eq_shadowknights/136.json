If this is the case I would like you to tell me the names of the <br/>\nmembers doing so.  I have yet to see your character on EQ and I play quit a <br/>\nbit.  Also, so not accuse the whole guild of a crime that perhaps a member <br/>\nor two have committed.  We try to let in only fun members to the guild.  <br/>\nLike I said and our website says, Dark Legion DOES NOT SUPPORT KILL <br/>\nSTEALING. mail me with their names and I shall see that it is looked into.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrumbel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
