You are KOS in every city there, and evading the first 2 guards at the docks is simple enough, but Butcherblock has several guardposts.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Don Bickner <br/>\n  To: eqshadowknights <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, June 21, 1999 5:43 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [eq_shadowknights] A newbie SK has A few questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hello all,<br/>\n      I have just created a DE SK and have a few questions.<br/>\n   <br/>\n      1) Is there any place near freeport that i can buy food? I have found the Swashbuckler that will buy my loot but he sells no food.I find it degrading to ask the freeport residents to buy food and water for me.<br/>\n   <br/>\n      2) What is the method of getting on the boat and over to faydwer? I have spent all my leveling Killing orc pawns in the commons so All the guards that I can see at the gates will con me dubiously, but I have been afraid to enter(I am only level 5). Will all the guards in FP area regard me dubiously? And if I do make it over to BB, how do I elude the guards over near the docks of BB?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thank you </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
