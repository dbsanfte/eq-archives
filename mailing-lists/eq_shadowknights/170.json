I was wondering if by any chance this has been changed? I am<br/>\nmaking a DE SK and I REALLY want to take up archery with him. Archery for me<br/>\nis one of the main reasons I am choosing SK&#39;s. Can someone please please<br/>\nplease please tell me that verant fixed this oversight and there is now a<br/>\nplace to buy fletching materials? I logged on and checked that one place in<br/>\nneriak and that place is a joke; it only sells nocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo is it possible  to buy materials not in Kelethin or surefall? Does maybe<br/>\nGrobb or Oggok have the rest pf the materials? And if it isnt possible maybe<br/>\nall SK&#39;s should feedback this as it essentially makes one of our skills<br/>\nuseless.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
