As of now, and maybe from now on, I will not ever use my pet<br/>\nagain. Bringing the pet through Lower Guk would be something that no one is<br/>\nstupid enough to do. And since grouping is basically mandatory after level<br/>\n20 (or level 30 depending on what you fight), pets, in my opinion, is almost<br/>\nuseless at that point. Sure, there is an occasional spectre that Bony might<br/>\nhelp, but it does more harm than good. If the change was made, I would be<br/>\nusing the new Lifetap spells more than I would use the Summon Pet series.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always thought it will be cool to be a fighter with a pet. But seeing the<br/>\nSK downtime and the uselessness of the pet (doesn&#39;t attack in PvP and duels,<br/>\ntrain-makers), I quickly realized that the pet is nothing more than a<br/>\nnovelty and needs to be replaced. Unless they change the mobs aggressiveness<br/>\ntowards the pet being dependent upon the SK&#39;s level, I see no reason to<br/>\nsummon a pet in a dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:coregimp@...\">coregimp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shadowknights don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt;the diversity their exp penalty should grant.

As of the moment just getting<br/>\n&gt;the lifetap series would be too powerful...and I&#39;d trade ol Gebeker in any<br/>\n&gt;day for a way to heal myself. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
