The only packs I know of that add about zero weight are a shaman summon spell, and that bag disappears as soon as you logout, as well as the items stored in the bag.  Also these bags only have 4 slots, and have heard you can place 15 lbs. bricks of ore into them and it apples only a fraction of the weight to your encumbrance load (which is good for hunting ... rock dervs(?) in fire storm that give you these bricks).  I WISH they would come out with a magic backpack that would do this, that wouldn&#39;t disappear at logout time. (how about that =)<br/>\n        <br/>\n        Tenin - Tarew Marr<br/>\n            ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n            From: Remlin <br/>\n            To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n            Sent: Monday, June 14, 1999 6:31 PM<br/>\n            Subject: Re: [eq_shadowknights] Dark Elf SK<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            Where can u find these packs, cause this is my biggest problem as well!!<br/>\n            I need cash to get banded armor to compensate for my DE&#39;s low fighter charastics.<br/>\n             <br/>\n            Thanks In Advance<br/>\n            Chris<br/>\n            Remlin Ryal, Warlord of House Ryal<br/>\n            Rallos Zek<br/>\n             <br/>\n                And note I am not getting any experience from these trips (and if I could find a magic backpack that would carry 8 slots with no weight, or lower weight I would be trying to find them). </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
