I occasionally take a break from my magi to play a sk on Xegony.<br/>\nI was wondering what would be a nice 2H magic weapon to quest for, for a<br/>\nfirst magic weapon. I&#39;m not asking for any real spoilers, perhaps someone<br/>\ncould point me in the right direction ?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy troll is level 8 at the moment and had saved enough plat to by a regular<br/>\nsteel halberd at 36p. I&#39;ve been told a few time that was monumentously<br/>\nstupid, but heh what can I say, troll&#39;s ain&#39;t rose that far out of the<br/>\nswamp ) Anyway, having only played a magi I&#39;m not used to dealing with<br/>\nweapons and such, so what would be nice to have ? what are some price ranges<br/>\nto save for, etc ? Any help/thoughts on the subject would be cool, and my<br/>\nthanks to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBumzuk of Grobb</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
