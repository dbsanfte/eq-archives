It is kinda hard for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-706384307\">You are probably right about my arguements, I only heard them from other <br/>\nplayers since I never spent much time with one character in EQ. It is kinda <br/>\nhard for me to play enough, or stay interested enough in EQ to gain serious <br/>\nlevelage.  However I do have friends in RL that have been in the beta since <br/>\nphase two, thats where I got my info.  I also love a good arguement, and <br/>\nalthough I still don&#39;t know who is right (it looks to be you at the moment) <br/>\nI consider you to have won.  I know npc&#39;s do hit for more at their level, <br/>\nbut not an incredibly higher amount.  And yes, STR does add alot to your <br/>\ndamage when you can do between 1 and say 80.  There are other things I know, <br/>\nfrom experiences in phase 3 that I saw.  100 damage per swing ISNT ALOT!<br/>\nWizards at level 50 can do 1000! YES 1000 damage per spell.  That is without <br/>\nresisting, so a well equiped warrior/fighter hybrid would have a chance, but <br/>\nstill, 100 damage per swing is about how much you can do high in levels.  <br/>\nRangers at level 20 can do 40 damage with a runed oak bow, and bows only <br/>\nhave half the damage multiplier of weapons.  Btw, at level 40 spectres can <br/>\nbe tanked, of course without a healer you will have to sit for a long time <br/>\nwith a bark potion and rubicite plate to heal, but it is possible for the <br/>\nwell equiped fighter to succeed in killing them solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun with your Dark Reaver, but I still believe from evidence of your <br/>\nformer posts that you are too low a level to have earned it through the <br/>\nmeans a true shadowknight should.  Farewell and Goodnight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the arguing over EQ have caused me to crave playing it again, perhaps I <br/>\nwill reactivate my account and restart on the path to level 50 :P And still, <br/>\nI think that it would be very nice for you to show your stats, without that <br/>\nyou have no REAL proof of all your knowledge, and check out eqlizer for <br/>\nstats on all the weapons btw thats <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gameznet.com/eq\">http://www.gameznet.com/eq</a> and you will <br/>\nsee where I have attained most part of my knowledge of the weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Howard Chan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hchan@...\">hchan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eq_shadowknights] Will not sufficient??<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 16 Jun 1999 18:07:17 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Howard Chan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hchan@...\">hchan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am not going to give my level and the amount I paid for the DR.
