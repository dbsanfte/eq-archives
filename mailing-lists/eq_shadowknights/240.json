What you said was definitly one way to take out a SPectre but I&#39;ve also watched a 30 SK friend and two of his friends, a cleric and wizard take out a Spectre. The SK would pull run and cast maybe one dot if that and then run in and tank, while the wizard blasts the spectre and the cleric healed the sk. There are many ways to kill things in the game. Overall though SK&#39;s are more tanks with support rather then spellcasters, there are exceptions though. However overall I would say a Ogre makes the best SK stat wise, of course that is my opinion.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
