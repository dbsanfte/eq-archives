Perhaps that will convince you that no one<br/>\ncan tank a spectre. To put it simply, one must Ensnare or Darkness the<br/>\ncreature and run around until it is as dead as possible, then going oom<br/>\nbefore you engage. No matter what armor you got and how many HP you have,<br/>\nthe spectre is still going to hit for 60, 70, 50, 80 in one round. Now, how<br/>\nmany of those rounds can 1000HP take?<br/>\nI cannot disagree or agree with you on &#39;higher strength = higher damage&#39;<br/>\nbecause it has not been proven yet. Do you use an Ogre or a Troll? If so,<br/>\nwhat level are you? What damage do you do? And what weapon do you use?<br/>\nPlease email me personally concerning the picture and your stats at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hchan@...\">hchan@...</a> ; that is, if you wish to do so.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
