Blind is the<br/>\n&gt;main concern, while Root is there to keep the SK from Shadow Stepping. As<br/>\n&gt;long as the Shadow Knight is blinded, the pet can be killed. Once the pet <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;killed, Flash of Light can safely be casted again and again. You are <br/>\n&gt;correct<br/>\n&gt;that SKs are not weak, but it is the spell setup of the Paladins that are<br/>\n&gt;made to counteract the spells of the SK.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;First of all, the paladin&#39;s spells are just as likely to be resisted as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ours.  I&#39;ve been rooted and blinded before, and it&#39;s very, very difficult<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;keep someone under both for any significant period of time.  5 rounds to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;finish off the pet&quot; will be more than sufficient to get out of at least <br/>\n&gt;1,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;if not both.  An actual problem is that sometimes pets for SKs don&#39;t work<br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;PvP.  The important part of the darkness spells is the slowing more than<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;damage. Starting a fight with siphon strength, which I&#39;ve never seen<br/>\n&gt; &gt;resisted, does a 20 point switch in strength balance and gives the SK an<br/>\n&gt; &gt;advantage in melee.   When the fight comes down to melee, which they all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;eventually do, the SK is going to deal more damage much more quickly.  I<br/>\n&gt;do,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;however, concede the paladins have bows part.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Looking for a new hobby?
