Also<br/>\nthey can&#39;t bash unless thay have a shield and all the Shadow Knights only<br/>\nweapons are 2h.  On E&#39;ci it seems that most Shadow Knights are Dark Elf<br/>\nfollowed by Humans. I guess people just like the look of them better. I&#39;ll<br/>\nlist the advantages and disadvatages of all of them and just pick the one<br/>\nyou want to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nOgres-Infravision, bash, highest stats except int.<br/>\n           -Only can go to two towns(Ogre and DE), Exp penatly.<br/>\nTrolls-Infravsion, bash, regeneration, 2nd highest stats except int.<br/>\n           -Only can go to two towns(Grobb and DE) Biggest exp penatly.(My<br/>\nopinion, hardest character to play)<br/>\nDark Elves-Ultravision, highest int, can go to all 3 evil towns.<br/>\n                    -No bash, low stats, exp penatly<br/>\nHumans-Exp bonus cancles out Exp penalty, can travel much easier than the<br/>\nothers.<br/>\n              -Low stats, no bash., no infravision<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone has there own opinions on which class is the best, so just pick<br/>\nthe one you will get the most enjoyment playing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Nuluk(E&#39;ci)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Alien11721@...\">Alien11721@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Alien11721@...\">Alien11721@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a level 1 Dark Elf Shadowknight.
