I have the (Lore) Shiny Brass Haldbred that <br/>\nwas dropped by the named orc in High Hold, dmg 16, not sure of speed.  I do <br/>\nnot use it much unless running with my sisters because I cannot bag the <br/>\nweapon and it makes me a walking shooting gallery.  Sometimes powerfull <br/>\ncharecters sell Rune Totem Staves, I used to have one.  Now I realise that a <br/>\nstick is not very Knight like, but no one complains when you are the only <br/>\ntank beating back the ghoul in Befallen.  I didn&#39;t actually start collecting <br/>\nmagic weapons as loot untill I was 17th level.  That may be because we <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know where to go or just refused to brave the goody lands and risk <br/>\nattack.  At your level, all you can do is save your snake fangs and buy one.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Xillith.<br/>\n<br/>\nHEY, is anyone aware of a container that will fit a haldbred?  Shiny Brass <br/>\nis useless to me if I cannot bag it with all the scrapes I get into.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Psion&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:psionprime@...\">psionprime@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eq_shadowknights] new shadow knight here<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 16 Jun 1999 19:35:54 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Psion&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:psionprime@...\">psionprime@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello all. I occasionally take a break from my magi to play a sk on Xegony.<br/>\n&gt;I was wondering what would be a nice 2H magic weapon to quest for, for a<br/>\n&gt;first magic weapon. I&#39;m not asking for any real spoilers, perhaps someone<br/>\n&gt;could point me in the right direction ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My troll is level 8 at the moment and had saved enough plat to by a regular<br/>\n&gt;steel halberd at 36p. I&#39;ve been told a few time that was monumentously<br/>\n&gt;stupid, but heh what can I say, troll&#39;s ain&#39;t rose that far out of the<br/>\n&gt;swamp ) Anyway, having only played a magi I&#39;m not used to dealing with<br/>\n&gt;weapons and such, so what would be nice to have ? what are some price <br/>\n&gt;ranges<br/>\n&gt;to save for, etc ? Any help/thoughts on the subject would be cool, and my<br/>\n&gt;thanks to you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bumzuk of Grobb<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
