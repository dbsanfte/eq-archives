They are important in the aspect that they raise our<br/>\n&gt; faction with The Dead so that other quests may be acccesed, such as the Ring<br/>\n&gt; of The Dead quest, ( provides a Gate to Neriak ).  If nothing else, that box<br/>\n&gt; is a free container to hold 10 beetle eyes.  =)  I want to do the mail<br/>\n&gt; delivery quest when I hit lvl 30 ( and can invis ) to see the faction hits I<br/>\n&gt; get.  If quests are your thing make a barbarian, Halas is FULL of quests and<br/>\n&gt; a few of them are cool and rewarding.  If you are going to do the beetle<br/>\n&gt; quest, do it now.  Soon you are too high a level to get it from the Necro in<br/>\n&gt; the Lodge of the Dead.  Be carefull what other quests in Neriak you do,<br/>\n&gt; ANYTHING that hurts your standing with the dead must be avoided at all<br/>\n&gt; costs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You cannot do the courier quests at that level.
