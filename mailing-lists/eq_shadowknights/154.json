After realizing how big of a wuss my wizard was I <br/>\nquit after level seven. When I first got the game I picked a Dark Elf Shadow <br/>\nKnight, but it was confusing so I tried out about every race/class combo you <br/>\ncould. Finally I went back to my SK and I love it. The main reason I got it <br/>\nis because of the sweet stats. They get VERY powerful at higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmatai Cy <br/>\nSecond In Command - The Maelstrom<br/>\nWWW.MWGL.NET</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
