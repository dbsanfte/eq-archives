Do not even consider it a factor!<br/>\n&gt;Gebeker will stand there and let you get pounded, period.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;Snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Enchanters?  FORGET IT, DO NOT FIGHT<br/>\n&gt;THEM.  Teshan (lvl 1) will eliminate your higher level advantage and you<br/>\n&gt;will find yourself charmed over and over attacking critters while the <br/>\n&gt;caster<br/>\n&gt;meditates and lays DoT on you.  Lucky for us, we have more Hp than the<br/>\n&gt;Enchanter can take away without having us tank other monsters.  Unlucky for<br/>\n&gt;us, the last thing a good enchanter does is summon her OWN pet and giggle <br/>\n&gt;as<br/>\n&gt;we consider attacking her  while we sport 40% life and face her same level<br/>\n&gt;animation, allowing her to meditate and finish us off if we choose to hang<br/>\n&gt;around. Wizards?  Nuff said.  Clerics?  LOL!!  Good luck!  The Druid is RAW<br/>\n&gt;POWER.  The Monk will Kung Foo our goofy ass back to respawn.  The<br/>\n&gt;Shaman....I&#39;ve spanked a bunch of Shaman Highlanders, I would give us a<br/>\n&gt;60/40 advantage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;more snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Check out this week&#39;s ONElist of the week.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;How is ONElist changing YOUR life?
