Teshan (lvl 1) will eliminate your higher level advantage and you<br/>\nwill find yourself charmed over and over attacking critters while the caster<br/>\nmeditates and lays DoT on you.  Lucky for us, we have more Hp than the<br/>\nEnchanter can take away without having us tank other monsters.  Unlucky for<br/>\nus, the last thing a good enchanter does is summon her OWN pet and giggle as<br/>\nwe consider attacking her  while we sport 40% life and face her same level<br/>\nanimation, allowing her to meditate and finish us off if we choose to hang<br/>\naround. Wizards?  Nuff said.  Clerics?  LOL!!  Good luck!  The Druid is RAW<br/>\nPOWER.  The Monk will Kung Foo our goofy ass back to respawn.  The<br/>\nShaman....I&#39;ve spanked a bunch of Shaman Highlanders, I would give us a<br/>\n60/40 advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;more snip&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
