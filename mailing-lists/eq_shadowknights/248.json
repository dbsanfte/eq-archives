But with the technique that I have mentioned, we are able to kill a spectre lower than the level that is required. And with more mana, a DE Shadow Knight is able to perform the above strategy more effeciently. If we were to compare the Ogre and Troll, however, I would believe the Troll would make a better candidate -simply because of their regeneration. One of the reason why SKs are so tough to play is because of our exp penalty and our downtime. With a Troll, these factors can be cut down during and after a fight. Thus, giving Trolls an advantage over Ogres.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    True I sorta agree with you except in most cases a SK is a warrior with spells for support two dots in and then you run in and start tanking the char in other words. What you said was definitly one way to take out a SPectre but I&#39;ve also watched a 30 SK friend and two of his friends, a cleric and wizard take out a Spectre. The SK would pull run and cast maybe one dot if that and then run in and tank, while the wizard blasts the spectre and the cleric healed the sk. There are many ways to kill things in the game. Overall though SK&#39;s are more tanks with support rather then spellcasters, there are exceptions though. However overall I would say a Ogre makes the best SK stat wise, of course that is my opinion.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
