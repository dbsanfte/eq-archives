One thing is, they are pretty common,<br/>\nfrom what I see, even more so than Necromancers. There are ALWAYS Dark<br/>\nElves around, so it is easier to make friends and find alliances than the<br/>\nother dark races. But there are those still who pursue anything that will<br/>\nmake your gameplay less enjoyable, so make your choices wisely. <br/>\n<br/>\nHuman Shadow Knights seem the be the rarest of the SKs around, or so that I<br/>\nhave seen. But this is one reason I enjoy playing it, the challenge, and<br/>\nthe fact there isnt much of my kind around.<br/>\n<br/>\ngoodluck<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Tom &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bearsfootball@...\">bearsfootball@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eq_shadowknights] Dark Elf SK<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thursday, April 22, 1999 9:20 PM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Tom &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bearsfootball@...\">bearsfootball@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello.  I am getting a new computer in a week and the<br/>\n&gt; first thing I going to do is to buy EverQuest.  I have<br/>\n&gt; my heart set on playing as a Dark Elf Shadow Knight<br/>\n&gt; because they&#39;re the coolest. I would like to know if<br/>\n&gt; this would be extremely different to do, especcially<br/>\n&gt; for a newbie.  I do know a lot about the game though<br/>\n&gt; because my friend has it.  If anyone wants to tell me<br/>\n&gt; anything about the dark elf sk please do so.  I&#39;ll see<br/>\n&gt; you all on the Tunare server in about a week or so.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tekman (future Dark Elf Sk on Tunare)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that knowledge is power?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new ONElist e-mail community and strengthen your mind! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
