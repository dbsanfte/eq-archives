Must you re-create the same\r<br/>\ncharacter, and then talk to a GM? Or is is more complicated? Recently, I\r<br/>\nstarted a guild on Tunare with another character, and now I&#39;d like to\r<br/>\nhave it on Rallos Zek, because it is probably the greatest server for\r<br/>\nroleplaying, hands down.  Any advice is appreciated!\r<br/>\nThanks,\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEnvy (tunare)\r<br/>\nShadow Striders\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n(aka- Sugan on Tunare and &#39;Zek)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
