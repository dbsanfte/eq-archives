While it is true that we <br/>\nare limited in where we can solo, not all SKs are unable to travel.  I am a <br/>\nfemale DE on Zek, I am able to freely roam the Ogre and Troll lands and thus <br/>\ngive me access to Rathe and South Karana.  I hunted the wuss side of High <br/>\nHold and the NPCs in the Karanas untill my High Hold Faction was high enough <br/>\nto simply walk through wistling.<br/>\nI wish I did have invis when crossing the Oasis or attempting to get to the <br/>\nship in Freeport or simply to zone into EC durring peak Pace War time.  Non <br/>\nevil races can move through these areas too, but getting past gate guardss <br/>\nfor a bind in the city will be a trick.  Remeber, EQ is a team game.  Have <br/>\nyou hugged your Enchantress today?  She gets invis at level 4.  Mind you, <br/>\nwizards do not get it untill level 16 and spells are their business.<br/>\n     I want to see a pet that will not just stand there picking its butt <br/>\nwhen someone blasts me with lightening.  Is it so hard to assign the masters <br/>\nPvP range to the pet upon casting?  I do not believe the programming code <br/>\nfor that would be very difficult. I would like to see my harm touch go to <br/>\n15hp per level or become a no resist attack or return more than once per day <br/>\nwith at least one hour in between ( to prevent imballancing PvP ).  Perhaps <br/>\nSK unique spells?<br/>\nWhy is it so impossible for us to have Life Tap at level 15?  Do those 10 hp <br/>\nmatter that much when compared our 350+?<br/>\n     HECK we have one attack and a level 8 skellie untill 20th when we get <br/>\nour second attack that doesn&#39;t get up to speed untill learly level 22 when <br/>\nwe get the whopping level 12 skellie, who still will not defend me from <br/>\nother players, but at least I can give &#39;ol loser bones a Vampiric Hug for <br/>\nsome life back (haven&#39;t tried this yet).<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion:  How long does a level 12 skellie last in Guk?<br/>\nAnswer:  Long enough to bring the house down on you because of its low <br/>\nlevel, and die.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a whole slew of issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I ever hear is it gets better at level X.  I very much enjoy the SK and <br/>\nall of its roleplay potential, but Verant didn&#39;t do a very good job <br/>\nballancing her against others in the PvP arena or the battlefield.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Xillith, Lady of Pain<br/>\nKeeper of the Knights<br/>\nRallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Chris Brodhecker &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rangersrulenhl@...\">rangersrulenhl@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eq_shadowknights] LOOK AT THIS VERY IMPORTANT SERIOUS<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 24 Jun 1999 09:05:12 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Chris Brodhecker &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rangersrulenhl@...\">rangersrulenhl@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Hello. I am sure many of you other shadow knights<br/>\n&gt;have thought of this but we must take action about<br/>\n&gt;this subject: Shadow Knights NEED invisibility at<br/>\n&gt;earlier levels.  They DO get the spell but at level<br/>\n&gt;30. I think they should get it at level 22 because of<br/>\n&gt;two main reasons. 1) We are hybrids so we already have<br/>\n&gt;some EXP penalties and we can&#39;t get to three quarters<br/>\n&gt;of the hunting grounds so are forced to hunt in the<br/>\n&gt;area around our home city until level 30.  2) At level<br/>\n&gt;2 we get the spells that necro&#39;s get at levek 8 EXCEPT<br/>\n&gt;for the invisibility spell. All of us Shadow Knights<br/>\n&gt;should join in and petition for invisibility at level<br/>\n&gt;22! We can get them to change it.
