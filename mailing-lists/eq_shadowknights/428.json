If you <br/>\ncannot do this you cannot have the ring or scithe.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Give Gix the following message:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;utalk adarev otcin&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe gives you a note.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Take the note into Befallen and give it to Skeleton Lrodd.  He says some <br/>\ngak and releases Commander Windstream.  Windstream is a big zombie who is of <br/>\nill temperment.  I do not know what level he is.  I do know that he was blue <br/>\nto a lvl 33 SK (me), and is built like a brick S*** House.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Windstream spawns by the false wall in level 3, by the chair.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>\nroam that I know of.  Kill him and get the stem of the Thex Mallet.  The <br/>\nstem is a container, so allow a slot for one.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) There are two other parts to the mallet.  The head and the handle thingy. <br/>\n  They are only found by the elf skelleton that stands by the locked door to <br/>\nlvl 3.  If the elf skell isn&#39;t there a dread bone will be.  Kill the dread <br/>\nbone and wait, the spawn rate is about 6 or 7 min.  (yea, I had alot of free <br/>\ntime *frowns*)<br/>\n<br/>\n5) OK, now you have all three parts to the mallet.  Put the head and handle <br/>\nin the stem and combine.  The Thex Mallet is created.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Boogie back to Neriak Third Gate, to the Lodge of the Dead.  On the <br/>\nsecond floor is the SK Loveal (sp).  Give him the mallet.  He will either <br/>\ngive you the Reaper of the Dead: Lore 2H slash 12 40 +4str with one charge <br/>\nof Complete Healing(YAY), or the Ring of the Dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nMind you, I did the quest about 18 times.  I am warmly regarded with the <br/>\nDead.  In fact, I stoped getting favorable faction hits (could this be <br/>\nwhy?).  Regardless, the Reaper sells to merchants for over 10plat and the <br/>\ncomplete heal (much like Lay Hands) is a priceless ability for our non <br/>\nhealing class.<br/>\n<br/>\nI only sold one charged Reaper, and that was to a very senior human SK.  <br/>\nPLEASE dont use it to twink light races!!  It is for US and US alone.  If I <br/>\never see a High Elf wizard &quot;lay hands&quot; on himself I will loose my mind, <br/>\nbecause I will be pretty sure how he did it.  But i firmly believe that once <br/>\nyou take the time to wait for Gix, get the mallet, and make the Reaper you <br/>\nwill be very reluctant to part with your full heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe SPENT Reaper sells to players from 80 to 110 plat on rallos zek.  It has <br/>\noutstanding stats and is in my opinion up to par with the Grob Cleaver and <br/>\nit has a better &quot;in character&quot; look to it.  I made about 1.5K plat selling <br/>\nspent Reavers to players and sold a full one for 600(rofl).  This quest is <br/>\none I will do many times, even though i have the Ring.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE RING:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a phrase...kicks ass.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne charge of bind affinity, rechargeable by a merchant in the lodge of the <br/>\ndead.  80plat.  I do not recall the name of the merchant, but if you ask <br/>\nthem &quot;what is the ring of the dead&quot; one of them will offer to recharge it.  <br/>\nThe recharger is a female one the first floor of the Lodge of the Dead.  Now <br/>\nif it sounds like a DE only thing, you&#39;re right.  The ring is SK, Necro and <br/>\ndark elf only.  (sorry all you Humans Ogres and Trolls, you get to walk a <br/>\nlittle farther from bind point....hehe)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow here I am, a lvl 34 SK bound IN Permafrost.  The Ring looses some of <br/>\nit&#39;s usefullness since I often run with Clerics who can Resurect me back to <br/>\nmy body.  BUT, for those solo excursions and groups with only druids/shaman <br/>\nor rangers/paladins to heal...it is a real gem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSO DON&#39;T GIVE UP!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is out there, it is a working quest, and it is SOOO sweet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, The Dark Reaver is a weapon to die for folks.  Get it get it get it.  <br/>\nHunt Guk until exhasted, by the time you can get it from the Assassin you <br/>\nwill be a Froglok killing expert and the owner of many new levels and items <br/>\nto boot.  Guk is made for us, no joke.  Practice your evocations so that you <br/>\ncan Ward Undead right beside your necros and clerics, casues Dead Side is <br/>\nwhere it&#39;s at AND we get Expulse Undead at 39 which is just iceing on the <br/>\ncake.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor all you young SKs out there, DONT GIVE UP!!!  I almost quit in disgust <br/>\nmany times and I am on a PvP server, so I have that to deal with at times as <br/>\nwell.  But I love my charecter so much I stuck with it.  The SK suffers SO <br/>\nmuch at low levels, but once you crest over 20 and get your dual attack, and <br/>\nthen 22 where you get some minor healing and other usefull spells if you&#39;re <br/>\nrescourcefull...there is no looking back.  I often have 130 dammage sets if <br/>\nI DONT reposte, and no dual wield weapons anyone can get untwinked at my <br/>\nlevel come close to compeating.  Our pet now contributes in PvP (THEY <br/>\nLISTENED!!) and I find my class being more welcome in groups than the <br/>\npaladin or ranger.<br/>\n<br/>\nPvP?  Dont get me started.  We rule.  Warrior with big whacker and pet = <br/>\nmove along to next target.  Our ability to Shadowstep and lay layer after <br/>\nlayer of DoT is truely dreaded, and the harm touch means I dont have to <br/>\npersonaly kill them all the way.  PvP with other tanks is tough due to their <br/>\nhit points and resistances, but I eat casters for lunch (except those damn <br/>\nenchanters, they suck!  But Pumice Stones are a spiffy solution to Charm)<br/>\n<br/>\nwow, I am just going on and on!!<br/>\n<br/>\nEnough.  Lets revive this board and get the newer players in the swing of <br/>\nthe best class in all of Norrath, the dreaded Shadowknight!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nXillith, devoted Knight and daughter of our Lord in Hatred.<br/>\nBlood Coven<br/>\nRallos Zek(of course)<br/>\n<br/>\ntake care all<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Sugan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kith@...\">Kith@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eq_shadowknights] Digest Number 81<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 30 Sep 1999 11:01:46 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Sugan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kith@...\">Kith@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hey, would it be a huge hassle if you could give the ring of the dead steps <br/>\n&gt;again?<br/>\n&gt;And who to ask about it, I&#39;m anxious also to get this...<br/>\n&gt;Also, does anyone know how I could recharge the Pestilence Scythe from Lord <br/>\n&gt;Grimrot<br/>\n&gt;in south karana? it used to be called the opal scythe, but changed with <br/>\n&gt;last<br/>\n&gt;patch..
