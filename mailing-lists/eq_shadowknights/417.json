I turned in the one tusk<br/>\nand the combined beetle eye at the same time.  He did <br/>\nsay &quot;I was expecting mammoth tusks&quot; before telling me<br/>\nI was a good sk, which I thought was odd.  My reward<br/>\nwas the 22nd SK spell Convoke Shadow (pet).  After<br/>\ndoing this, he said another paragraph with a phrase<br/>\n[in brackets] but he wouldn&#39;t respond to it.  All I want<br/>\nis a ring of the dead, that isn&#39;t asking too much, is<br/>\nit? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith T&#39;Vyn<br/>\nTunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
