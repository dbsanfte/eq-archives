If","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1484968140\">Yes, I also disagree when people say Ogres and Trolls make the best Shadow<br/>\nKnights. At higher levels, one would use alot of mana for the various<br/>\nreasons. If you play a Shadow Knight as a warrior, then yes, Trolls and<br/>\nOgres are WAY better. However, before engaging into combat, I would not cast<br/>\nEngulfing Darkness and start bashing. At later levels, spectres hit for 90s<br/>\nand it is impossible to tank anymore; thus, we are required to be more<br/>\nstrategic than just continuously bash. Therefore, one would use Darkness &gt;<br/>\nFear &gt; Heart &gt; Blood &gt; Strength &gt; Diease (swap usage order according to<br/>\nsituation, and repeat some of the DoT to renew them if possible) before<br/>\nengaging into melee. As seen in the technique above, one requires to have as<br/>\nmuch mana as posssible; this is when the Human and Dark Elf Shadow Knights<br/>\nhave an advantage over the large races. Sure, at low levels, Ogres and<br/>\nTrolls are better simply because there is not many DoT to throw around. But<br/>\nonce stacking is possible, you want to drain as many HP from the mob as<br/>\npossible before melee. The reason is because you cannot tank anymore without<br/>\na cleric at high levels. To all the Dark Elves out there, do not be<br/>\ndiscouraged - there is a reason why the Darkness spell slows down the<br/>\ntarget, it is to allow us to stack more and cast before engaging into melee;<br/>\ndo not bash like the Ogres and Trolls.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
