I am sure many of you other shadow knights<br/>\nhave thought of this but we must take action about<br/>\nthis subject: Shadow Knights NEED invisibility at<br/>\nearlier levels.  They DO get the spell but at level<br/>\n30. I think they should get it at level 22 because of<br/>\ntwo main reasons. 1) We are hybrids so we already have<br/>\nsome EXP penalties and we can&#39;t get to three quarters<br/>\nof the hunting grounds so are forced to hunt in the<br/>\narea around our home city until level 30.  2) At level<br/>\n2 we get the spells that necro&#39;s get at levek 8 EXCEPT<br/>\nfor the invisibility spell. All of us Shadow Knights<br/>\nshould join in and petition for invisibility at level<br/>\n22! We can get them to change it.
