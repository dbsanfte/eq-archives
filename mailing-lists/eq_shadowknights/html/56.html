<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739781775">Great idea. Here&#39;s what I know so far:<br/>
<br/>
Be careful in Butcherblok. All guards, and all NPC&#39;s at the dock *will* KOS,<br/>
but there are ways around it if your swimming&#39;s up to par.<br/>
<br/>
Forget about the western half of Antonica until you&#39;re strong enough to make<br/>
it through Highhold pass alive. The guards in Rivervale(Death to all<br/>
halflings) will KOS, although the 2nd time this happened to me, they conned<br/>
&quot;look at you threateningly&quot; rather than &quot;scowling and ready to attack&quot;, so<br/>
faction does improve(Kill orcs. lots of em).<br/>
<br/>
Kithicor Forest: The Merchants in the first cabin to the right would sell to<br/>
me. /conned &quot;apprehensive&quot;. The inkeep at the next cabin to your left will<br/>
KOS, but only if you walk through the door. On my way back to loot myself, i<br/>
was able to open the door, see him staring at me, and /summon safely.<br/>

&gt;    I know some might think this may be a spoiler of sorts, but anyone<br/>
&gt;interested in making a list of NPC&#39;s that KoS SK&#39;s? I know that factions<br/>
&gt;play a role in some SK&#39;s getting killed by a NPC, but there are some<br/>
&gt;that will kill us immediately no matter what we do.<br/>
&gt;    The only reason why I personally do not feel this a spoiler is<br/>
&gt;because of this simple reason. If this were a real world (and when I am<br/>
&gt;playing, I guess it is) I would definitely think that SK&#39;s would have<br/>
&gt;some sort of network to relay this exact type of info.  Also, NPC&#39;s can<br/>
&gt;see us through walls, so if I would have known that the 1st inn in<br/>
&gt;Western Karanas had an Innkeeper that will kill me immediately, I would<br/>
&gt;have given it a little wider distance  :).<br/>
&gt;    I know that /con is a great way to tell if someone will kill you if<br/>
&gt;you make contact, but sometimes that is not possible i.e. in the middle<br/>
&gt;of a fight. If I could just see the name of an NPC strolling towards me<br/>
&gt;while I am engaged in combat, I would have a little more time to create<br/>
&gt;some distance. Just as I do whenever a Griff or Giant comes a little to<br/>
&gt;close to a confrontation I may be having with a band of couple bandits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, comments? bad idea? good idea?<br/>
