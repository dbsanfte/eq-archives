<div id="ygrps-yiv-987717594">Hello.  I am getting a new computer in a week and the<br/>
first thing I going to do is to buy EverQuest.  I have<br/>
my heart set on playing as a Dark Elf Shadow Knight<br/>
because they&#39;re the coolest. I would like to know if<br/>
this would be extremely different to do, especcially<br/>
for a newbie.  I do know a lot about the game though<br/>
because my friend has it.  If anyone wants to tell me<br/>
anything about the dark elf sk please do so.  I&#39;ll see<br/>
you all on the Tunare server in about a week or so.<br/>

Tekman (future Dark Elf Sk on Tunare)<br/>
