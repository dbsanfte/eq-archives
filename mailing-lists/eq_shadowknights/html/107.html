<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-717913408">Things have been quite lately, and I&#39;ve been wondering something: why do <br/>
people choose to play shadowknights?  Has anybody had trouble role-playing <br/>
one?  Playing Everquest, it takes so much time for a character to develop, <br/>
exspecially for SK&#39;s, what about the class makes it worth it?<br/>
