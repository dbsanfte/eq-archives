<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279779653">I have been told where it is (I am assuming the information was correct), and I would agree with the lvl 40 seeing the start of the area (but this maybe solo, not a group of 6 SK going in for it).<br/>
<br/>
Also I agree with DE don&#39;t make good SK, other than the travel ability.  Since spells seem to get resisted all the time, at higher levels, It becomes difficult at best.  I can only speak for myself (being lvl 14).  I have been having problems soloing.  The pet is not much help since it seems to miss more than half the time and the disease cloud spell is almost always resisted.  The sap strength seems to never be resisted, only fizzles occasionally and interrupted when you get hit.<br/>
<br/>
The weight restriction seems to be the biggest thing.  It directly influences your ability to create cash in the game.  I have a banded tunic and 2 banded bracers and the rest leather at this point and I am up to 53 pounds (using shield and mino axe and long bow), which means I can carry only about 20lbs of additional equipment which is taken up fairly fast, which comes out to be about 2 back packs.  I have been soloing in Neriak forest for a bit with 6 back packs and carrying around 120-135lbs which really hurts me but I make about 2-5pp per trip, the most I can make without a magic weapon it seems.  And note I am not getting any experience from these trips (and if I could find a magic backpack that would carry 8 slots with no weight, or lower weight I would be trying to find them).<br/>
<br/>
As for the intelligence of the DE can&#39;t be beat.  I am maxed out in 1h slash and 2h slash before 2.5 bubble&#39;s gets and swimming and everything else gets maxed out extremely fast.  I haven&#39;t been practicing archery that much but worked my way up into the mid 60&#39;s on it (using a pine needle and some people who let me attack the dervs from behind).  So, skill gain is no big deal other than the effectiveness of the weapon, but again you are not a good fighter.  If the spells were stronger it would be nice.  But when Harm Touch starts to be resisted, it becomes a major pain.  I have been told that lvl 22 is the breaking point for us that when we hit that we start to really shine but I have 8 lvls to go.<br/>
<br/>
If I had to start over again I might choose a Troll only for the ability to heal fast and shear strength, and dump all the points into intelligence, or go again with a DE and dump about 75% of the points into strength.  But the thing to remember is 75% warrior and 25% necro, focus on your warrior side mostly if you go with a DE, if not keep your eye on your intelligence (low is bad, in the case of a Troll).<br/>
<br/>
Just, one note I do enjoy playing an DE SK and won&#39;t give it up, but I do wish that we could have a little more strength in spell casting or additional spells based on race (which would make each race a little more different) since we aren&#39;t the power house the Ogre and Troll are.<br/>

  Dark Elf&#39;s do not make the best Shadow Knights because they are more suited for casters while Shadow Knights are 3/4 warrior and 1/4 necro. Your best bet is to go with a Ogre or a Troll.<br/>
   <br/>
  The Dark Reaver can not be found until at least level 40 probably higher. I will not say it&#39;s location at this time for I do not want everybody to know. </span></blockquote></div>
