<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969001681">hehe heya all Jorval, Level 11 Human Shadowknight from Cazic Thule here. Just <br/>
wondered if any of ya knew about the SK magic weapons? As one of few <br/>
Shadowknights on my server, i havnt really found anyone that knows hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Also in reply to one of ya was talking about Shadowknights&#39; power... i <br/>
recently had a fight with a Paladin &lt;eg&gt; in the freeport area... it was very <br/>
close, i&#39;ll give a quick battle report.<br/>
<br/>
He entered the Arena and i told him to hang on a sec... he was anon but i <br/>
coned him and he was a gamble to me (me being lev 11), i told him 1 sec again <br/>
and summoned my pet, it fizzled so i waited a bit &lt;eg&gt; then summoned him, i <br/>
then yelled go and had my pet charge him. I hit him with siphon strength and <br/>
Disease cloud, then, as he was beating up on my skelie charged into the fray. <br/>
The battle was long but i was always on top, we were both getting lower and <br/>
lower but he was looking like dying sooner then me. He was hitting me with, <br/>
whats it called brilliant light or something? Well the spell makes your <br/>
screen go all black which isnt too good.. but i contined to fight and, as i <br/>
say, was winning. Anyway he was getting really low, i had about 2.5 bubbles <br/>
left he had 1, i got another few big hits in, then all of a sudden, he casts <br/>
lay on hands! ARRg, he&#39;s back to full hps and im on like  2 bubbles. Screw <br/>
this i think, and calling upon Innoruuk... i hit him with harmtouch for about <br/>
110 hps...we battle on again, much similar to before except now tis him with <br/>
the upper hand. Finally as he himself is near death he gets a few hits in, in <br/>
a row and im knocked unconcious. He turns and battles my pet, just as he <br/>
kills it, i come around, i hit him for 16 and it was looking like whoever got <br/>
the next hit in would win... alas it was he &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
All in all though a brilliant fight. And when i found out he was level 13, <br/>
two levels above me, i was well chuffed  :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
btw nice one on whoever set up the mailing list, hope to hear from more SKs <br/>
soon!<br/>
