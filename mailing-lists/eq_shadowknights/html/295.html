<div id="ygrps-yiv-73423826">Well, I can see an evil guild punishing a &quot;deserter&quot;.  I can see them <br/>
making you KOS.  It all fits into role play.  The fact that you are thinking <br/>
their behavior to be cruel and harsh makes an elegant point in their favor <br/>
as being an evil guild.  The fact that they couldn&#39;t kill you with X on one <br/>
proves the need to leave them FAR behind.<br/>

&gt;well....in asking to leave, and them just wanting to kill you for<br/>
&gt;it....that puts em on my KOS list...truelly a guild with no respect for one<br/>
&gt;another...and it is good you left, for such a guild is not worth being a<br/>
&gt;part of.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     We help out the new members by helping them level to upper levels as<br/>
&gt;soon as possible,,,,i was once in a very bad guild called   WOLF CLAN man<br/>
&gt;they had to be one of the most unorganized guilds i have ever seen in my<br/>
&gt;life....it got very boring for me,,,,,when i asked them that i wanted to<br/>
&gt;leave the guild they triied to pk me but we very wrong i managed to take<br/>
&gt;out 3 of there warriors in 1 round i just rooted them and let them die.<br/>
