I&#39;m a human shadowknight based out of Qeyos, about the only one i can<br/>
see that does not walk around with their &quot;anonymous&quot; flag on.  (Baddies that<br/>
do that, that make themselve anonymous just piss me off.  Nothing personal<br/>
but I figure we need to at least see each other.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just been killed five times in about five minutes.  This sucks.  I know it is<br/>
supposed to be hard, difficult, but this almost goes overboard.  Getting my <br/>
corpse took an hour, or I should say getting all of my corpses took an hour.<br/>
And this is worth it?  I get a pet, a crappy harmtouch (I think the math is<br/>
pretty clear on this) the inability to bash with a dark reaver (my fault for picking <br/>
a human, but I just don&#39;t want to be an ogre/troll/darkelf), some spells that<br/>
don&#39;t look particularly special until I&#39;m 50th level (and for those of you who think <br/>
that we do get good weapons compared to paladins, the best weapon in the <br/>
game, firey avenger, is paladin only), and the pleasure of being waxed by any <br/>
inkeeper that comes along.  I realize that some of this presents rolyplaying <br/>
opportunity, but christ, what are the payoffs?<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m looking for is a damn pep talk?  I&#39;m seriously considering dumping <br/>
myself and starting over as a paladin just because it has got to have a better <br/>
payoff.  Somebody convince me not to.  Please.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll just change races.  Maybe I&#39;ll quite whining.  (I said this was a rant, <br/>
afterall.)  Nah, I probably won&#39;t quite whining.<br/>

&gt; One of the reasons I decided to go with the Shadow Knight was because of =<br/>
&gt; the higher level spells. I was checking out GameSpot&#39;s EQ guide, they =<br/>
&gt; have a COMPLETE spell list...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Shadow Knight definitely comes into its own at level 30. We get two =<br/>
&gt; extremely useful spells: Feign Death (just ask any high level monk if =<br/>
&gt; this is useful) and Gather Shadows (invisibility). We also get Heat =<br/>
&gt; Blood (persistent damage), Endure Disease, Resist Cold, Wave of =<br/>
&gt; Enfeeblement, and Voice Graft, which lets you speak through your pet =<br/>
&gt; (hmmm... sounds funny)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 39 is big also. We get Banshee Aura (damage shield), Cancel Magic =<br/>
&gt; (stops another caster&#39;s spell), Expulse Undead, Heart Flutter (very =<br/>
&gt; cool, does persistent damage AND lowers Strength and AC), Augment Death, =<br/>
&gt; Infectious Cloud and an extremely useful spell, Intensify Death, which =<br/>
&gt; we cast on our pet so it regenerates and does more damage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 49 is the last rank. We get some powerful spells here too. Invoke =<br/>
&gt; Fear (causes fear in NPCs and enemies, upgrade of previous versions), =<br/>
&gt; Shadow Sight, Breath of the Dead, Word of Shadows (radius damage), =<br/>
&gt; Dismiss Undead, and what would be my all-time favorite, Boil Blood!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not all these spells had descriptions, I wrote something wherever =<br/>
&gt; possible. Unfortunately no lifetap spells :-( Anyways, I wasn&#39;t sure I =<br/>
&gt; wanted to be an SK until I saw this list. Now I definitely want to be =<br/>
&gt; one. Of course the other hybrids have their upper level spells as well, =<br/>
&gt; might want to check that out also. Go to www.gamespot.com.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One other thing: There are some SK-only weapons, I&#39;ve heard of one =<br/>
&gt; called the Dark Reaver, I heard there were others too.<br/>
