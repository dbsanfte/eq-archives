<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275928403">I try not to compare hybrids with non-hybrids. Comparing a Warrior with a Shadow Knight is unfair to say the least. However, another interesting fact that I found out was that the same spell casted by a lower level necromancer has a lesser probability of it being resisted than if it was casted by a SK.<br/>

    Shadow Knights are not unbalanced in any way I have a friend with a level 35 Shadow Knight and a level 28 warrior and his Shadow Knight is so much better then a warrior. Also you comparison of hp and the like is not fair because there are diffrent races and truth be told if you picked the best SK race ( Ogre ) and the best Paladin race ( Dwarf ) then you should easily have more hp then the paladin. Shadow Knights are a great class. Necromancers use Engulfing Darkness and Heaty Blood up until level 29 if they can figure out away to put there spells to good use then a Tank should easily be able to.</div>
