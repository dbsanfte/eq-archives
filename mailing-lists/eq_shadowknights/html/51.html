<div id="ygrps-yiv-272408172">I think if you were a newbie and wanted to start out as a shadow knight,<br/>
the dark elf is the perfect choice. One thing is, they are pretty common,<br/>
from what I see, even more so than Necromancers. There are ALWAYS Dark<br/>
Elves around, so it is easier to make friends and find alliances than the<br/>
other dark races. But there are those still who pursue anything that will<br/>
make your gameplay less enjoyable, so make your choices wisely. <br/>
<br/>
Human Shadow Knights seem the be the rarest of the SKs around, or so that I<br/>
have seen. But this is one reason I enjoy playing it, the challenge, and<br/>
the fact there isnt much of my kind around.<br/>
<br/>
goodluck<br/>

&gt; Hello.  I am getting a new computer in a week and the<br/>
&gt; first thing I going to do is to buy EverQuest.  I have<br/>
&gt; my heart set on playing as a Dark Elf Shadow Knight<br/>
&gt; because they&#39;re the coolest. I would like to know if<br/>
&gt; this would be extremely different to do, especcially<br/>
&gt; for a newbie.  I do know a lot about the game though<br/>
&gt; because my friend has it.  If anyone wants to tell me<br/>
&gt; anything about the dark elf sk please do so.  I&#39;ll see<br/>
&gt; you all on the Tunare server in about a week or so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
