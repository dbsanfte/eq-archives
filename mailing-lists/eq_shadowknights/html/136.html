<div id="ygrps-yiv-558589795">I have yet to be witness to any steal killing and do not support it within <br/>
the guild.  If this is the case I would like you to tell me the names of the <br/>
members doing so.  I have yet to see your character on EQ and I play quit a <br/>
bit.  Also, so not accuse the whole guild of a crime that perhaps a member <br/>
or two have committed.  We try to let in only fun members to the guild.  <br/>
Like I said and our website says, Dark Legion DOES NOT SUPPORT KILL <br/>
STEALING. mail me with their names and I shall see that it is looked into.<br/>
