<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002511064">ShadowKnight pets are not going to be improved anymore and for good reason. You increase them anymore and your really beginning to come out of the Shadow Knight spells and move into the Necromancer spells. If you wanted powerful pets then you should of been a Necromancer. ShadowKnights are 3/4 warrior and 1/4 Necromancer not the other way around. Your spells are used as support nothing more.</div>
