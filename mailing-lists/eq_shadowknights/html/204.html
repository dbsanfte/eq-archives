<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754347597">I will give you that in time the DE could be more powerful faster (just<br/>
because of the skill gain).  But give the Troll and Ogre some time (a lot of<br/>
time) and they will most likely (other than mana) be just as strong in the<br/>
magic area too.  But if I were to go back I would only put 1 to 3 points<br/>
into int, The rest into str, and some into sta.  Plus I don&#39;t know if I even<br/>
will be able to wear plate at this point, just because of the weight limits,<br/>
unless I find light magic plate or something.  I can only carry about 75<br/>
lbs. of equipment.  And if all the equipment weight lets say 70 lbs.(? don&#39;t<br/>
know since I can&#39;t afford it) that gives me 5 lbs. of carrying capacity.<br/>
Hmmm... excuse me group I have to go to  town to turn in this rusted mace<br/>
for cash because I can&#39;t carry anymore because I am encumbered by carrying<br/>
one mace,  I am sure if I do this every time I loot I will be removed from<br/>
the group fairly fast.  And since the system seems to be more item based<br/>
than cashed based, your income seems to me based basically on the amount of<br/>
items you can carry, and as I said in the last post cash is a big issue in<br/>
the game.<br/>
<br/>
All I am saying is if you want to play a DE put the points into str (mainly)<br/>
and sta and very few into int, because you already have a large number<br/>
their.  If not a DE and you go with an Ogre or Troll put the points mainly<br/>
into int.<br/>
<br/>
And let me get back to spells for a second.  At lvl 9 Disease Cloud does<br/>
5pts damage max (if not resisted) and stops the creature for standard<br/>
healing during battle which is nice.  That is the only damaging spell you<br/>
have until lvl 15 then you get your first DOT (Damage over Time) spell.  Sap<br/>
Strength works and doesn&#39;t ever seem to be resisted (imho) and some what<br/>
stops the creature from hitting you or hits you  for less.  Again you are<br/>
dealing with a lvl 14 player give me a better example why a DE is better<br/>
than a Troll or Ogre at say lvl 22 or 23 other than just a blanket statement<br/>
&quot;they are better&quot;.  Why are they better?  more mana for the higher level<br/>
spells?  memorize spells faster?  less fizzle rate?  the pet actually gets<br/>
better (instead of being a &quot;milk bone&quot; for bears and wolfs)?  And what is a<br/>
DOT spell? does 5pts damage 1st round and 5pts the 2nd round?  Remember I am<br/>
lvl 14 impress me, and impress the guy who started this question. By the way<br/>
what lvl are you?  What spells do you like to use?  What kind of advice can<br/>
you give us Dark Elf SK  (DESK get it?).  Should the person put in a lot of<br/>
points towards his/her int? or devote it to str?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am not trying to be belligerent, but give a reason for the pain<br/>
and tormenting we DE do at lower levels.  Especially since we have to tank a<br/>
lot.<br/>

You guys are crazy. Dark elfs are probably the best SK. For over all reasons<br/>
too. There stats are more balanced, they&#39;re int is higher, and eventually<br/>
they&#39;ll pass up the ogre and troll in higher levels because of more powerful<br/>
spells<br/>
