Dark Elves hate all other races, they use the other dark races to their<br/>
advantage.  If you travel with others of pale skin, than you are a traitor<br/>
and must die.<br/>

Hello my dark friends.  On this statement, I must disagree.  On E&#39;ci, we<br/>
work as a team.  I just started another Knight of the Shadows and received<br/>
some help from a Necromancer on my first attempt to kill.  I quickly joined<br/>
with this person and went on a killing spree.  I have never leveled up so<br/>
quickly with any other character.  I started getting called a tank at level<br/>
3.  We Knights of the Dark love chaos and mayhem but do not need to hate.<br/>
Let others hate us while we conquer the lands in the name of our dark lord.<br/>
On E&#39;ci, we even receive the occasional assistance from others who are not<br/>
of our ranks.  Let them fear us but don&#39;t hate them for their ignorance.  On<br/>
E&#39;ci, we believe that all beings have their places (some six feet under<br/>
ground).  Just thought I would put in my two copper.<br/>

<br/>
Ah... I too tried Ralloz Zek. Now the other servers pale in comparison.<br/>
Rallos Zek is the only TRUE EQ experience I beleive... as being evil on easy<br/>
servers poses such minimal risk. I mean, I&#39;ve even seen screenshots of<br/>
Trolls and high elves and the like partying together! There&#39;s a butchered<br/>
dwarf in Grobb and more than half a dozen in Oggok, and they&#39;re there for a<br/>
reason! They eat them!!! This would make any true RP grind their teeth, as I<br/>
do. If you care to take a glance at your character description as a<br/>
Orge/Troll SK, you&#39;ll notice you&#39;re on blade-to-blade terms with<br/>
eachother... something I heard nary a word on the easy servers, I bet some<br/>
of you possibly even FORGOT. I know this doesn&#39;t apply to you, Chan, but if<br/>
an Ogre or Troll SK had a twinked OR sold DR on RZ... they wouldn&#39;t have it<br/>
for long. Oh, I have stories of raids on Freeport, and invasions in the<br/>
swamp, but I&#39;ll not get into them here unless someone asks, but here&#39;s a<br/>
screenshot I took myself of what occurs in Freeport on a near-daily basis.<br/>
(this was taken during my exceedingly brief campaign as a DESK (had to lower<br/>
res. due to hotmail&#39;s file size limit))<br/>
<br/>
                                   -Dreath TSK, defender of the swamp<br/>
                                   -Grolm, Troll Warrior<br/>
                                   -Ralel, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>
                                   -formerly Vaed, Eru Necro<br/>
                                   -and a couple more<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I hope to make your aquintance, lady Xillith.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;On another note.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In response to earlier posts, I am no traitor to the Tier&#39;Dal.  Although on<br/>
&gt;Rallos Zek, the mighty rule the land.  A weaker Shadow Knight with a weapon<br/>
&gt;such as the Dark Reaver would definitely be a target to many of the raw PK<br/>
&gt;(Player Killer) guilds, as the weapon would sell for several hundred plat<br/>
&gt;simply because lower Guk is HELL and no one deserves the pain involved in<br/>
&gt;camping it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am a member of the Blood Coven on Rallos Zek, a guild of DE females sworn<br/>
&gt;to defend DE purity.  I have killed many Tier&#39;Dal traitors and I have seen<br/>
&gt;the item lust and covetous nature of many players.  I was simply and<br/>
&gt;realistically stating that you must be prepared to defend your wealth and<br/>
&gt;yourself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just cannot comprehend a Role Play world where I can carry around my best<br/>
&gt;gear all of  the time and never worry about High Elf raiders seeking blood<br/>
&gt;retribution or Dwarven clansmen initiating their young on my dark blood.<br/>
&gt;You want to play Shadow Knights?  Play one on Rallos Zek, I dare you.  You<br/>
&gt;will never know what evil races can do until you have seen Darkenbane and<br/>
&gt;the Horde ( DEs, Ogres, and Trolls) grind their way through all of the<br/>
&gt;players and many of the guards ( sometimes merchants ) in West Freeport.<br/>
&gt;The human newbee zone is a graveyard.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well said!!!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;THIS is why I am a Dark Elf, I am the Vanguard of evil.  The Dark Tower in<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;world of light.  Neriak and The Nectulos forest are inviolate, as they were<br/>
&gt;meant to be.  Many players on the server are poor but NO ONE can say that<br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt;haven&#39;t earned every copper.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tell you a story.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You just don&#39;t know what it means to be an evil race until you zone into<br/>
&gt;East Commons from Nectulos, and stand face to face with a six-pack of 16th<br/>
&gt;level High Elf wizards...powering up.  The knock back saved my life, as I<br/>
&gt;zoned once again, with 18 life.  Shadow Step put over half the zone between<br/>
&gt;them and me with three leaps and the alarm went out.  The response was<br/>
&gt;staggering.  Newbies zoned into the commons to be spotters since they could<br/>
&gt;not be attacked and a respectable force collected, zoned, and beat their<br/>
&gt;ass.  They never returned and two of the bodies are still there in the<br/>
&gt;dirt,<br/>
&gt;twisted by a half dozen harm touches.  Lucky for me a Freeport and Northern<br/>
&gt;Ro raid was forming that day, as scheduled, and I caught their muster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Such is life on Rallos Zek, war and hate made real.  The difference between<br/>
&gt;my server and ALL of the others is RESPECT.  You respect your people, or<br/>
&gt;they hunt you into deletion.  You respect your enemies<br/>
&gt;( and you have a bunch ) or they will over run you.  Guild tags begin to<br/>
&gt;mean something, typically the difference between relief and a rapid retreat<br/>
&gt;or the bagging of your favorite thingies.  Weight allowance??  BAH!  I keep<br/>
&gt;two backpacks empty incase I come across a pair of frisky halfling Druids<br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;for ANY excursion into East and West Nam...er...Commons.  I have come<br/>
&gt;across<br/>
&gt;extremely rare loot that I outright sold wile thinking &quot; By the time I can<br/>
&gt;defend this item, I can camp for it myself.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On Rallos Zek, an equipment inspection is often followed by a fire ball<br/>
&gt;instead of a &quot;cool gear&quot; compliment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just cannot explain the experiences on Rallos Zek with words.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You will quickly realise that friends and race are more important than<br/>
&gt;stats and encumbrance.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The words fly truer than any arrow...<br/>
<br/>
The mages in my party hold my loot, and all<br/>

&gt;good armour and weapons goes to us tanks since we keep them alive.  I<br/>
&gt;haven&#39;t cared about weight since level 9.<br/>
