<div id="ygrps-yiv-949651149">The item that you are looking for is the Traveller&#39;s Backpack. If you are on Mithaniel Marr, I have one on sale. In fact, since I have been trying to sell the following on Mithaniel Marr with no success, I might as well try to advertise it here:<br/>
<br/>
- Combine Two Handed Sword x 2<br/>
- Combine Long Sword<br/>
- Tentacle Whip (Lifetap effect)<br/>
- Small Bronze Mask<br/>
- Small Bronze Splinted Cloak (or something like that)<br/>
- Traveller&#39;s Backpack (decreases the weight of items within the backpack)<br/>
- Velvet Choker (Forgot the stats, but I believe it was +5HP)<br/>
- Skull of Jhen&#39;Tra (+20 MANA, +3 SV MAGIC)<br/>
- Stiletto of the Bloodclaw (6/23, 20HP lifedraw)<br/>
- Blackened Iron Tunic<br/>

<br/>
If you are interested in any of these items, please email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:hchan@...">hchan@...</a><br/>
And to those of you who think I &#39;cheated&#39; to obtained those, you are correct, a level 75 has given me all this stuff for free. <br/>

    I was just making an observation with this statement.  The only packs I know of that add about zero weight are a shaman summon spell, and that bag disappears as soon as you logout, as well as the items stored in the bag.  Also these bags only have 4 slots, and have heard you can place 15 lbs. bricks of ore into them and it apples only a fraction of the weight to your encumbrance load (which is good for hunting ... rock dervs(?) in fire storm that give you these bricks).  I WISH they would come out with a magic backpack that would do this, that wouldn&#39;t disappear at logout time. (how about that =)</div>
