<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842502850">I am going to assume, and I going to go out on a limb here, that you can get<br/>
this sword by doing a quest. This makes sense, to me, because the Soulfire<br/>
sword has been found(Implemented) for the Paladins and it is a quest nodrop<br/>
item. So maybe there is a quest someplace that can shed some light on this.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Ok, fair enough.  I&#39;m assuming that it&#39;s location remains secret, and<br/>
&gt; that I won&#39;t have to worry about it for about 20 more levels =) (I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; almost 22 now)  Did they mention what zone it is in?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Still though, a fine blade, and everyone needs a long term quest<br/>
&gt; (holy grail).  One thing I&#39;d like to see is a blade that has an<br/>
&gt; aura of darkness around it, in opposition to light generating items,<br/>
&gt; but most likely that would be very difficult to code, and the few<br/>
&gt; human SK&#39;s might get upset, but then again they&#39;d have deadeye by<br/>
&gt; the time they got it most likely.<br/>
