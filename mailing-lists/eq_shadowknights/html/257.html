<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368801286">Well,<br/>
<br/>
    I if you were a level one SK on Rallos Zek you would have a very crammed <br/>
bank account for a very long time with that equipment laundry list.  <br/>
Whatever, an RZ evil race charecter who buys a Mino axe does so because <br/>
traveling to Faydwer is suicide as an evil race.  You would get killed and <br/>
camped for a LONG time.<br/>
<br/>
     To each his own.  I will not respond to the amped up posts any more, I <br/>
just have to accept that my server is unique.  I do thank all of the players <br/>
on other servers for their postings on stats.  I have learned about lost of <br/>
great gear, that I will not be able to protect...heh.<br/>

&gt; &gt;if you were level 40 with the dark reaver, THE LEVEL YOU SHOULD BE! then<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt;would be doing damage in the high 100s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wow! I have never seen anyone doing over 100 before. Hmm, I must be blinded<br/>
&gt;when I see high 30 Rangers doing 17 with their Demon Claws. And I must also<br/>
&gt;be mistaken when I see a level 40+ doing an average of 60 with the Reaver.<br/>
&gt;But that is okay, because they could be doing high 100s in your own world.<br/>
&gt;High 100s, eh? Why not 9999 damage as seen in Final Fantasy games?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would like to quote you on something, &quot;I know that a level 20 warrior <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;the executioners axe can do 100 damage&quot;. First, you condemn me for having<br/>
&gt;the Dark Reaver at my level, then you go on to state that a level **20**<br/>
&gt;WITH an **Executioner&#39;s Axe** can do **over 100**??  . . . I am not sure<br/>
&gt;myself, but I think I see something wrong with that. Quite obviously, you<br/>
&gt;are UNCERTAIN of your position of your argument. In addition, you give<br/>
&gt;evidence that is completely FALSE. A level 20 with an Executioner&#39;s Axe, is<br/>
&gt;a &#39;cheap bastard&#39; as you would have called it, because there is no way he<br/>
&gt;could have obtained it himself (unless he bought it). Also, I have yet to<br/>
&gt;see a level 40+ with an Executioner&#39;s Axe that can do over 80; stating <br/>
&gt;&#39;over<br/>
&gt;100&#39; at level 20 already proves that you are pulling numbers out of a hat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It is very interesting to see how people react to others who get higher<br/>
&gt;level equipment. Those people believe that unless you camped for the item,<br/>
&gt;you are not allowed to use it even if you have enough money to afford it.<br/>
&gt;Perhaps when you have collected enough snake fangs to get your Mino Axe, I<br/>
&gt;should call you a &#39;cheap bastard&#39; and condemn you for having equipment that<br/>
&gt;is out of your league. Just like what you did to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Think about the following: IF I was a level 1 walking in Full Plate, why<br/>
&gt;would you care?? So, what if I have an advantage over you - does that <br/>
&gt;affect<br/>
&gt;your game play in any way? Or is it that you are so jealous of my <br/>
&gt;equipment,<br/>
&gt;that you must condemn me for what I have?<br/>
