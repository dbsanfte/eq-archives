&gt;1) I have played him for 16 days and only 16th level.  You might ask what<br/>
&gt;the problem is.  I started a Shaman out 5 playing days ago and he is now<br/>
&gt;16th level.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YEP, I had an identical experiance.  I play a dark elf, so lucky for me I <br/>
had the firepower of my race and its diversity of classes to aid me in my <br/>
adventures.  SKs level SLOW, you&#39;ve seen that.  A big part of playing a <br/>
character, any character, is mindset.  With your success at developing the <br/>
shaman, I would say you have a spell caster mindset and work best in that <br/>
environment.  A tank rarely has the benefit to step back and survey the <br/>
battle field like a caster does, we have to work through the chaos of being <br/>
IN the spellfire and meele and find the best target to taunt and or fight.  <br/>
That is very hard to do, I cannot teach it.  It&#39;s something you will develop <br/>
yourself while playing a tank or realise as your Shaman ages and you watch <br/>
senior tanks at work.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last night I had 2 guild invites and my SK never had one (until<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I asked a guild, get into that in a moment).  The only reason I started a<br/>
&gt;Shaman because I heard they were wanted in groups, and I always had a rough<br/>
&gt;time finding anyone who wanted to group with me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bad taste abounds.  You cannot fault someone for not wanting to risk their <br/>
XP to a tank they have likely never run with.<br/>
<br/>
Understand this though, tanks rule the game as the players all age.  A party <br/>
with no combat class or inadequate combatants will die and die often.  If <br/>
you don&#39;t believe me, do Cazic Thule or Guk with a bad tank:caster ratio and <br/>
see how many time you dash for the zone.<br/>
<br/>
Contrary to popular belief, clerics and shaman are NOT tanks.  Warriors <br/>
CANNOT stop a fleeing mob.  Root is NOT a reliable means of ensuring the mob <br/>
does not flee(very valuable in dungeons), and when rooted the creature turns <br/>
and keeps fighting.  So, what does that leave you with?  A Ranger or an Sk.  <br/>
Ok the Ranger is a great class, no doubt about it.  Snare kicks butt and <br/>
they have that nifty dual attack and wield which makes mobs insane with <br/>
aggro.  We (Sks) have the darkness series up to Dooming Darkness.  It can be <br/>
cast during the battle to soften the mob, during the escape to slow it (and <br/>
it doesn&#39;t turn to hit anyone), AND it does damage the whole while.  <br/>
Combined with fear you have a slow moving beast that is doomed to die.  Dump <br/>
enough damage into it and it will be in flee mode when the fear wares off, <br/>
if not then just repeat.<br/>
<br/>
Fear+darkness works great on large outdoor lethal mobs that the party may <br/>
not be high enough to handle but wants to engage: Kodiaks, Griffawns, Giant <br/>
Skells, Treants.<br/>
Couple that with the LOW aggro caused by your slow yet heavy hitting weapon <br/>
and you have a high probability that the creature will turn to the taunt of <br/>
a PET over you or a caster if done right!  Group still doesn&#39;t want you?  <br/>
Then they&#39;re dumb because the true talent of the Sk is mob CONTROLL and we <br/>
just get better at it as we age.<br/>
<br/>
ARG, I remember being told there was no room for me in a group as an SK.  It <br/>
sucked!  I simply chose to fight beside them and when they saw that I was <br/>
killing stuff they had to tag team (via above method) I was quickly invited, <br/>
but enough about my history.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2) Armor.  In east commons and &quot;/auction WTB banded armor&quot; and have never <br/>
&gt;gotten a response.    So I still am running around in leather, with a SBH <br/>
&gt;that I bought from someone for 100 plat.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, you&#39;re lvl 16?  Go hunt in High Pass Hold.  Orc side drops consist of <br/>
your SBH and ringmail that fits a human or smaller and Gnoll side drops the <br/>
PGT and ringmail that fits a size large.  You can also hunt Runny Eye for <br/>
Blackened Platemail at your level.  As far as the SBH goes, i used one until <br/>
i was lvl 23...yep 23.  At that point I was able to convince some guildmates <br/>
to help me get a BBC and through dumb luck not soon after I killed the <br/>
Reckless Efreet in Solusek&#39;s Eye for the Obsidian Flamberge.  Now I have the <br/>
Dark Reaver.  Look, the weapons will come.  You definitely are lacking in <br/>
the armor area.  I recommend forgetting about this phantom guild guy with <br/>
the banded.  Go to High Pass, kill Orcs or Gnolls and get yourself some <br/>
ringmail.  If you are on a carebear server bring cash to buy pieces off of <br/>
players that got the loot you needed.  It can be done.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I normally don&#39;t get upset at things, but this I feel is just insane.  I <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;reading on another list that Brian/Veriant thinks SK Troll/Orge is fine but<br/>
&gt;the DE/Human is just screwed but any type of modification other than<br/>
&gt;equipment would make the entire class unbalanced.  He/They (whomever) found<br/>
&gt;that the Mage Tank (anti-paladin) was unacceptable, and was a scary thing <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;see.... hmm... aren&#39;t we suppose to be?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Power gamers are always comparing stats vs this and race vs that...hogwash.  <br/>
Play the race/class you can relate to and enjoy.  I will not tell you that I <br/>
do not envy the Troll&#39;s regen or the Ogre&#39;s raw power or the human&#39;s ability <br/>
to travel.  I can tell you that I can cast spells all day and my agility <br/>
keeps me nice and cozy(and my clerics happy)as I am not hit as  often as my <br/>
larger counterparts.  I can also tell you that, in my opinion, the Dark <br/>
Elves have the best fire support when grouped due to the diversity in their <br/>
race.  I could ramble 4 ever on why I feel this is true but I will just say <br/>
experience it for yourself.  (although I suppose on non-PvP servers you get <br/>
a homogeneous mixture of races and classes in a group, oh well)<br/>
<br/>
Personally I would think that if<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;you have a higher experience penalty you should be stronger than the other<br/>
&gt;classes that don&#39;t have the penalty.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are very very powerful, I don&#39;t flaunt it because I don%27t want a <br/>
hunderd DE Sks running around Nectulos trying to see for themselves.  I want <br/>
to remain special, unique, and a mystery.  My ravings here are for those <br/>
poor souls who have already committed to the Path of Innoruuk and the often <br/>
painful life of the dreaded Shadowknight.  Stick with it, stay in touch, and <br/>
you will reap rewards.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the single most devastating PvP player on Rallos Zek, bar none, is a <br/>
human Shadowknight of lvl 43 when I met him last.  He has wasted more people <br/>
than anyone I know, he is not in a guild and he kills his enemies ALONE.  As <br/>
I advance and occasionally skirmish with PKs I am beginning to see why, I <br/>
haven&#39;t been killed by another player since I was lvl 13 (remember mob <br/>
control?).  He makes the same claim.  Coincidence?  No.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck David I hope I helped.<br/>
