<div id="ygrps-yiv-648927314">I hear everyone complain about how week the pets are, and it&#39;s true,<br/>
they are, but weak is not necessarily ineffective.  I currently<br/>
have the 15th level pet spell, and I generally always have one when<br/>
I solo.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night I had a pet (different castings are different you know) that<br/>
had double attack, and with a scimitar was swinging for up to 14 points,<br/>
and bashing as well.  Since I use a 2 hander, I can&#39;t bash the gnoll<br/>
soothsayers out of their spells, but my pet managed to do it at least<br/>
once every fight.  By the end of the fight, my pet would have done<br/>
at least 100 points of damage.  That&#39;s not too bad.<br/>
<br/>
Pet tip #1 (Pet placement)<br/>
<br/>
Set your pet out of the way, and pull to your pet like you would to<br/>
a group.  I pull with Clinging darkness and then I can get another<br/>
spell or two off before the monsters get there.  Always keep your <br/>
pet away from spawn points, because the greens it&#39;ll pull just aren&#39;t<br/>
worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Pet tip #2 (Pseudo-tank)<br/>
<br/>
This tip worked well for me from about 15-17 fighting caimans and<br/>
crocodiles in Oasis.  It also works better with a high delay, high<br/>
damage weapon.  Set your pet out of the way, and pull a monster<br/>
over to you.  Cast the spells in this order: Clinging darkness (to<br/>
pull), siphon strength, disease cloud.  Also, be sure to have mend<br/>
bones memorized.  Then, you take a swing, and back up, turning off<br/>
auto-attack.  The monster will turn on the pet, and hit him a time <br/>
or two until you get your attack back.  Then you step forward, attack,<br/>
and step back.  Use /pet report health to monitor old Kabartik.<br/>
When he gets to 50% I usually throw in a mend bones, and then its<br/>
just about time to recast darkness as well.  Then I step in and<br/>
finish in melee.  When I was fighting blues with this technique,<br/>
the only downtime I had was meditating, in one case I took 22 points<br/>
of damage during the fight, and healed that while medding.<br/>
<br/>
Our pets are weak.  But it would be really unbalancing if they were<br/>
much more powerful.  Keep them out of trouble and use them as a<br/>
DOT.  I just turned 20, so I might be ignorant of the higher<br/>
level woes, but they work well in non-dungeons up to 20 if you<br/>
use them right.<br/>
