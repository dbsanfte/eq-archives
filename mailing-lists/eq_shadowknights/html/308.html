<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715741209">Paladins got bows about a month or so ago.  I suppose a group of paladins<br/>
got together and /petitioned to have some way to attack us SK&#39;s at a<br/>
distance and got what they wanted, I don&#39;t know.  But your point about<br/>
paladins supposedly being honorable enough NOT to use a bow, is a good one<br/>
even if it is (dare I say it?) role playing more than anything else.  A good<br/>
majority of paladin&#39;s players out there are not really playing paladins as<br/>
they are playing warriors with spellcasting abilities.  The same rings true<br/>
for many SK players.  I will not get into the role-play/powergame debate<br/>
here, but suffice it to say, a lot of things fall by the wayside once people<br/>
start to play.<br/>

&gt; Maybe I was wrong in my previous post, but when did paladins get bows?  I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t really been playing everquest because I have been bored of it, but<br/>
&gt; last I knew the general attitude of the paladin was that ranged combat was<br/>
&gt; dishonorable(description of the paladin on everquest page) and they could<br/>
&gt; not use the archery skill let alone any bows. </span></blockquote></div>
