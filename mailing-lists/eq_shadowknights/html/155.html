<b>Subject:</b> Re: Why are you playing a SK <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-72658102">I completely agree with you. Being a warrior AND having a pet distinguishes<br/>
us from the everyday fighter. Also, there&#39;s just something about a Dark Elf<br/>
Shadow Knight with Blackened Armor that makes them one of my favorite<br/>
combinations. Btw, does anyone think the Vampiric Embrace is completely<br/>
useless at level 22?<br/>

&gt;I&#39;d ask why everyone is playing a SK.  I am a Troll<br/>
&gt;SK and the reason why I&#39;m playing it is because I like<br/>
&gt;the idea of being evil plus being able to wield a 2h<br/>
&gt;sword while commanding a pet is just plain fun. </span></blockquote></div>
