<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921061358">Yes, we can petition them, but I think they will just laugh at it before<br/>
throwing it into the recycling bin.<br/>
<br/>
One of my main concerns about the SK class is their inability to heal. The<br/>
only way that I see, is through the use of the Lifetap series. I believe<br/>
that Verant took out the Lifetap series for the SK because of the Troll&#39;s<br/>
regeneration. Verant think that if the Troll can regen and Lifetap, it could<br/>
create an ultimate class. However, Troll&#39;s natural regeneration is not fast<br/>
and they take a worse faction hit than Dark Elves. Thus, making the SK class<br/>
weak due to the Troll regeneration simply makes other race/class<br/>
combinations tough to play.<br/>
<br/>
One can argue that there are tactics to prevent the SK from getting hit. But<br/>
these tactics are mana consuming and might not work all the time. Thus,<br/>
getting hit is unavoidable. And along with getting hit, there are big<br/>
downtimes.<br/>
<br/>
Then others will raise the point that one must find a group at higher<br/>
levels. I agree completely. However, after reading a post elsewhere, I found<br/>
a counter point to this - would a group want a SK who can use Voice Graft or<br/>
a Paladin that can cast Greater Heal (~300+HP heal) at level 39? A Paladin,<br/>
who can act very well as a secondary healer, is in fact, more desirable in a<br/>
group. While SKs are still doing 40 some odd damage at level 38 with their<br/>
Ward Undead, a Paladin can be doing over 100 with Expulse Undead.<br/>
<br/>
Although, there wasn&#39;t a point to this message, but it&#39;s some facts that I<br/>
thought I should share.<br/>
<br/>
Note - the original poster that brought up the Greater Healing argument also<br/>
suggested something interesting. He compared the Greater Healing of the<br/>
Paladin with the Harm Touch ability of the Shadow Knight at level 39. I&#39;ll<br/>
let you figure the rest out . . .</div>
