<br/>
OUR PET WILL NOT DEFEND YOU IN PVP!!!  Do not even consider it a factor!  <br/>
Gebeker will stand there and let you get pounded, period.<br/>
<br/>
Do not EVER believe that a blinded caster is crippled.  Clear your target <br/>
window with the escape key and when your text shows a hit, start laying on <br/>
the Fear.  When it says your target is &quot;very affraid&quot; Shadow Step, even if <br/>
you are rooted.  If you have a cleric, only use the spell on pure warriors <br/>
or rouges since they have no mana LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
And as for blindness, hotkey your spells.  Even blinded you still have the <br/>
enemy targeted and  you can see your text.  If the paladin is dumb enough to <br/>
step off of me to root and heal I will fear and NOT engulf shadows to <br/>
increase the distance between us and then Step to confuse him when he <br/>
returns.  This battle takes FOR EVER if both sides are competant and equally <br/>
equipped.  It comes down to how you can handle yourself, who are fighting, <br/>
and who gets the first shot.  In a LONG East Karanas battle the deciding <br/>
factor was the mobs in the area who piled up on the Feared paladin and <br/>
slayed him.  You KNOW he has more HP, IF he hasn&#39;t used the LH.  Use your <br/>
environment.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, getting jumped by ANY even charecter and allowing them the <br/>
first few hits means YOU LOOSE.  That is why player killers on RZ are so <br/>
successfull.  My Shadow Step has kept me ALIVE and Fear has saved my little <br/>
blue butt more times than I can count.  Use your skills.  We should change <br/>
our name to ExpertEscapist, since we aren&#39;t beating ANYONE.<br/>
<br/>
Where I thought we sucked was:<br/>
<br/>
1.  The pet is a loser and it starts trains in high level dungeons.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Harm Touch becomes something I do to MYSELF (yes Verant, my &quot;dreadfull <br/>
weapon&quot; is a suicide tablet at higher levels) to avoid being looted by <br/>
player killer mages who will burn me out before I can engage if Fear fails <br/>
or if Shadow Step sends me in the wrong direction.  I have found that <br/>
players resist about 40 to 60% of it anyways, but I WILL take it all.  HT <br/>
stinks as an opener in a monster fight and will sometimes clich it for me <br/>
towards the end, but now 24 game hours must pass because HT is &quot;too <br/>
powerfull&quot; and will imballance the game.  Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
3.  If we dont get a pet worth a damn I would like to sacrifice it for the <br/>
LIFETAP series early on, not the VampiricRoulette spell we have been given, <br/>
at level TWENTY TWO!!!  How any one can believe that a MAYBE lvl 12 skellie <br/>
has any use to a lvl 22-28 SK is beyond my comprehension. I haven&#39;t cast the <br/>
spell since lvl 18 and I could care less.  better yet, keep the damn pets <br/>
and keep the insignificant healing.  Just give me some DoT and the necro <br/>
invis at 15th so I can travel to my hunting spot with confidence.<br/>
<br/>
Listen,<br/>
<br/>
A same level Necro or Magician PET would beat us into the dirt, never mind <br/>
the caster gobbling up our life bar.  Enchanters?  FORGET IT, DO NOT FIGHT <br/>
THEM.  Teshan (lvl 1) will eliminate your higher level advantage and you <br/>
will find yourself charmed over and over attacking critters while the caster <br/>
meditates and lays DoT on you.  Lucky for us, we have more Hp than the <br/>
Enchanter can take away without having us tank other monsters.  Unlucky for <br/>
us, the last thing a good enchanter does is summon her OWN pet and giggle as <br/>
we consider attacking her  while we sport 40% life and face her same level <br/>
animation, allowing her to meditate and finish us off if we choose to hang <br/>
around. Wizards?  Nuff said.  Clerics?  LOL!!  Good luck!  The Druid is RAW <br/>
POWER.  The Monk will Kung Foo our goofy ass back to respawn.  The <br/>
Shaman....I&#39;ve spanked a bunch of Shaman Highlanders, I would give us a <br/>
60/40 advantage.<br/>
<br/>
Hide in the dungeons and only cross open areas with your equipment in a bag. <br/>
  Enjoy the REALITY of the SK.  Where we are exremely fortunate is the very <br/>
few people outside of us know how rediculously weak the class truely is <br/>
compared to the other classes.  For some reason we have some fearfull <br/>
reputation that prevents our wholesale slaughter by opportunists.  Whatever, <br/>
I am sticking it out because I am ASSUMING there will be a positive change <br/>
in the class SOON.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I am trying out a few casters....<br/>
<br/>
I love the SK, really I do. I cannot nail down the reason, but I think the <br/>
class is cool.  I am speaking totaly OOC and about game mechanics NOT <br/>
roleplay in this post.  I will also always speak in terms of Rallos Zek <br/>
since NO WHERE ELSE can you find your class pushed to its true limits.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
A friend just called me and told me that the casting time on the wizards&#39; DD <br/>
spells has been reduced in the newest patch along with some other caster <br/>
&quot;improvements&quot;.  Feeling second class yet?  My recomendation for Zek <br/>
is...buy a few more backpacks, it&#39;s SK season.</div>
