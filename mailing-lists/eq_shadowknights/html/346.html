<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089408970">Greetings fellow Shadowknights,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a subscriber to the list from way back when it was first created.  I&#39;ve been keeping a close eye on<br/>
the recent ideas for a petition for changes to our class and would be interested in collecting all the ideas<br/>
and sending them over to Verant.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to coordinate the efforts of for the petition.  If you ask why me, then I&#39;ll tell you I&#39;ve been<br/>
playing a shadowknight and only a shadowknight since EQ was released.  I am PO of Keziah Tho&#39;tep, a 25th<br/>
level SK on the Bristlebane Server.  I&#39;ve more than understood and experience many of the problems have been<br/>
discussed here, I especially liked the messages #8 and #9 from Digest #55.  I think players like PO Xillith,<br/>
PO Tenin and Howard Chan pointed out very reasonable changes that with the proper attention brought to Verant<br/>
can be made.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, I&#39;m one of the lead members for a growing RP guild on the Bristlebane server.  Our guild consists<br/>
of dark races only and our membership at the moment is primarily SK based.  I am more than sure that all the<br/>
members of my guild will also lend their support in this petition, no matter who decides to present it to<br/>
Verant.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know your thoughts on this and we&#39;ll try to get all our reasonable ideas organized and ready to<br/>
propose to Verant.  If anyone else feels they&#39;d rather coordinate this effort, please feel free to do so.  I<br/>
just haven&#39;t seen a large enough movement to do so by anyone except Amatai, the moderator of this onelist.  I<br/>
will say that Amatai and I do play on the same server and we do have our differences IC and OOC, and I prefer<br/>
to handle this rather than turn it over to Amatai.<br/>
<br/>
Any comments or ideas should be submitted to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:skpetition@...">skpetition@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and I hope to hear from you all.<br/>
<br/>
