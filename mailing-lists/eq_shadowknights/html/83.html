<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583740066">No, I don&#39;t think we should get dual wield. It make us way too powerful. In<br/>
addition, Paladins and SKs are more stereotyped to use two handed weapons<br/>
than having a blade in each hand; thus, giving us dual wield would cause us<br/>
to lose our uniqueness. I do think that we should get the Lifetap series and<br/>
a 100% working HT though.<br/>
