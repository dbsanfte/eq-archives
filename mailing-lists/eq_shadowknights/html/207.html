<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042992760">Excuses me? I DID NOT &#39;tweak&#39; to obtain my Dark Reaver. I worked long and<br/>
hard for it. Please do not condemn others when they are simply more wealthy<br/>
than you are. Oh well, at least I hit for 47 at my &#39;low&#39; level while you are<br/>
still using your rusty two handed sword.<br/>
