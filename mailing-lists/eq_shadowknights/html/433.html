<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000390852">OK, Xillith .... Let see where should I begin....<br/>
<br/>
I like (not love) my shadowknight (Tenin).  My 2 biggest problems right now<br/>
about this class is:<br/>
<br/>
1) I have played him for 16 days and only 16th level.  You might ask what<br/>
the problem is.  I started a Shaman out 5 playing days ago and he is now<br/>
16th level.  Last night I had 2 guild invites and my SK never had one (until<br/>
I asked a guild, get into that in a moment).  The only reason I started a<br/>
Shaman because I heard they were wanted in groups, and I always had a rough<br/>
time finding anyone who wanted to group with me.  Anyway found a guild that<br/>
let me join and asked if anyone wanted to form a group or could I join,<br/>
never got a response back, so I end up soloing, which everyone knows the<br/>
problems with that.<br/>
<br/>
2) Armor.  In east commons and &quot;/auction WTB banded armor&quot; and have never<br/>
gotten a response.  Now I have heard of suits selling for around 75 plat but<br/>
never could find anyone selling any banded.  OK back to guild, &quot;do we have<br/>
any one making banded armor&quot; ... &quot;yes it is xxxx, and should be on tonight&quot;<br/>
well suffice it to say they never were on that night or any other time that<br/>
I was on.  So I still am running around in leather, with a SBH that I bought<br/>
from someone for 100 plat.<br/>
<br/>
I normally don&#39;t get upset at things, but this I feel is just insane.  I was<br/>
reading on another list that Brian/Veriant thinks SK Troll/Orge is fine but<br/>
the DE/Human is just screwed but any type of modification other than<br/>
equipment would make the entire class unbalanced.  He/They (whomever) found<br/>
that the Mage Tank (anti-paladin) was unacceptable, and was a scary thing to<br/>
see.... hmm... aren&#39;t we suppose to be?  Personally I would think that if<br/>
you have a higher experience penalty you should be stronger than the other<br/>
classes that don&#39;t have the penalty.  Anyway, until something is done where<br/>
I can get armor that is worth anything (because I can&#39;t take the hits from<br/>
the MOB&#39;s anymore) I will be packing Tenin away for a while, maybe will get<br/>
back to him someday when I can tweak him out or something, whatever needs to<br/>
be done I don&#39;t see any other route other than tweaking. (truthfully really<br/>
hate saying that because I shouldn&#39;t have to do that, but I feel I have been<br/>
forced into it).<br/>
<br/>
Oh, last thing... sniped it out but you said that the zombie is like blue to<br/>
a level 33, lets just say I will never be able to kill it at 16, so that<br/>
isn&#39;t a solution for me.  The complete heal would be nice, especially if the<br/>
lady could recharge that too. (by the way where is Gix?)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any suggestions I would be willing to listen, but I think I<br/>
have given up on him for the time being.<br/>

For all you young SKs out there, DONT GIVE UP!!!  I almost quit in disgust<br/>
many times and I am on a PvP server, so I have that to deal with at times as<br/>
well.  But I love my charecter so much I stuck with it.  The SK suffers SO<br/>
much at low levels, but once you crest over 20 and get your dual attack, and<br/>
then 22 where you get some minor healing and other usefull spells if you&#39;re<br/>
rescourcefull...there is no looking back.  I often have 130 dammage sets if<br/>
I DONT reposte, and no dual wield weapons anyone can get untwinked at my<br/>
level come close to compeating.  Our pet now contributes in PvP (THEY<br/>
LISTENED!!) and I find my class being more welcome in groups than the<br/>
paladin or ranger.<br/>
