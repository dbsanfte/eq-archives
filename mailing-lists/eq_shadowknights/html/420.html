<div id="ygrps-yiv-214080632">I am helping the people at soerbaird.com (They host the shaman&#39;s<br/>
crucible, an excellent shaman site) to put up a section on SK&#39;s.<br/>
I&#39;m putting together alot of stuff, but am looking for any tips,<br/>
tricks, spell advice, strategy, guides, rp info, and quests that<br/>
you all have out there.  I will compile it, giving credit to <br/>
submitters, and get it onto the site, which from what I&#39;ve seen <br/>
will top any of the few sk pages out there.<br/>
<br/>
You can either mail me directly, or just post it to the list.<br/>
Hopefully the site will be ready enough to post the url soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help,<br/>
