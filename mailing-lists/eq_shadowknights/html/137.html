<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884548994">Since I&#39;m the one that kinda started the whole int/mana thing, I went back<br/>
to my old character who only had an int of 64 and that couldn&#39;t cast<br/>
leering corpse when I was playing him.  Well, when I tried to cast it I<br/>
could. I was still the same level(10) as I was when I quit the character.<br/>
I have heard rumors that Veriant was going to change the mana for Paladins<br/>
and Sk&#39;s because it was to low.  I guess they did.  This my be why some<br/>
people could cast it at 9 or 10 and others couldn&#39;t. Don&#39;t know. Thought<br/>
this might be useful.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I love our pets.  I gave mine a 2h weapon, and about 50% of the time,<br/>
it would hit between 1-19. I was hitting for around 19 and my bash(they<br/>
change bash to level 6 now) was doing around 5. So when everything went<br/>
right for one round of combat it was 19, 19, 5.  I must say I was going<br/>
through monsters left and right.  I was really impressed.<br/>
