<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-516581284">Fairly high level Paladins can take down an SK&#39;s pet with huge ease. If the <br/>
Paladin is of a similar level to you, and even if you&#39;re givin the luxury of <br/>
summoning your pet before the battle, it would only take a Paladin a couple <br/>
of spells or some slashes to take down your low leveled pet. Sure, that would <br/>
give you time to beat up on them and have the upper hand for most of the <br/>
fight. But as i&#39;ve found in dueling Paladins, when they get low they use lay <br/>
on hands and even if you immediatly rip off harm touch, they proceed to stay <br/>
on top of the fight, as your harmtouch doesnt match the amount of hps they <br/>
got back from lay on hands.</div>
