<b>Subject:</b> Human SK Quests? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661626708">Although I&#39;m a DE SK, I&#39;d like to do some human SK quests in Freeport<br/>
and Queynos, but don&#39;t know any other than the Groflah/note quest.<br/>
My reasoning behind this is that I&#39;ve done everything I can in Neriak,<br/>
and would like to believe that we have a cool Unholy sword quest similar<br/>
to Soulfire.  Since I haven&#39;t seen much in Neriak, and humans are the<br/>
least popular race of one of the least popular classes, I figured there<br/>
might be some overlooked quests, that maybe lead up to something good.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really want full quest spoilers, just suggestions of what&#39;s<br/>
out there and who to talk to (and where).<br/>
