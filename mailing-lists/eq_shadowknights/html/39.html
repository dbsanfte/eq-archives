<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023234497">Okay, not to sound like a jerk, but as a game developer I have some pretty<br/>
strong opinions about the &quot;right&quot; way to get your pleas/requests/opinions<br/>
heard.  So I don&#39;t intend to single you out, however I will use your e-mail<br/>
as an example of how NOT to send an e-mail to someone that probably gets<br/>
hundreds a day.<br/>
<br/>
As a preface, keep in mind that someone like John Smedley probably doesn&#39;t<br/>
have time to read all his e-mail, so he probably goes through and sifts<br/>
through his in-box looking for the intelligent sounding ones and<br/>
ignores/deletes the ones that sound like rants.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Dear John,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know probably coming from a lowly gamer like me.. to a president such as <br/>
&gt;yourself, this doesnt mean much.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, you&#39;re starting off by establishing that his opinions/time are more<br/>
important than yours.  You do this by saying you&#39;re a &quot;lowly gamer&quot;, and at<br/>
the same time you acknowledge that he is a president and that you believe<br/>
that your status as a gamer lowers his<br/>
<br/>
This causes a huge hodge podge of emotions to kick in: he will likely feel<br/>
some amount of condescension towards yourself, since it&#39;s obvious you don&#39;t<br/>
feel that your opinions are as valid as his, and at the same time he will<br/>
feel defensive because you&#39;ve already painted him to be someone that&#39;s<br/>
aloof and out of touch with the common gamer (i.e. the people that pay his<br/>
salary).<br/>
<br/>
So my suggestion would have been to just delete that introductory sentence.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But I&#39;m pretty deep in gaming myself. I used <br/>
&gt;to be a moderator for DWANGO back in its day, I run www.mngamers.com, help <br/>
&gt;out with www.quake3rocks.com, and I am starting the mwgl.net. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Stating credentials is another sign of insecurity.  He probably doesn&#39;t<br/>
care all that much who you are, but probably does care about what you have<br/>
to say.  To save him some time, just jump to the meat of your message.<br/>
Dispense with the &quot;I&#39;m relevant because...&quot; paragraph because you&#39;re also<br/>
inadvertently trying to make yourself look more important than the Joe<br/>
Gamer that doesn&#39;t run some Web sites.<br/>
<br/>
So my suggestion would be to rephrase the above or delete it altogether (a<br/>
perfect place to put those Web sites would be your .sig, since it&#39;s context<br/>
he might find valuable).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I know a lot when it comes to games, and one thing is to listen to the <br/>
&gt;gamers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re once again telling him why he should pay attention.  Unfortunately,<br/>
you&#39;re doing so in a manner that seems both defensive (&quot;I know a lot&quot;) and<br/>
confrontational (the implication is that they don&#39;t listen to gamers).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A huge discussion going on within the mailing list is the short hand <br/>
&gt;we as shadow knights get when it comes to spells. I have copied a recent mail <br/>
&gt;that I will past in quotes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re taking the time to write a message, and if he&#39;s taking the time<br/>
to read the message, then you should probably grammar and spell check it.<br/>
And there are MUCH larger discussions about these same issues occuring on<br/>
the messageboards of eqvault and stratics.<br/>
<br/>
Do not assume that you and your friends/list members have some insight far<br/>
beyond everyone else.  In all likelihood, the opinions that you have have<br/>
been heard many times before.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Many many mails have been sent and recieved like <br/>
&gt;this, and I totally agree.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Volume doesn&#39;t equate to rightness, and concepts like &quot;many many&quot; are<br/>
meaningless to someone that sees more e-mail traffic in a day than most<br/>
people see in a few weeks.  Whether YOU agree with the many e-mails is also<br/>
irrelevant, since he doesn&#39;t know who you are.<br/>
<br/>
The important thing here is to establish an _argument_.  State your case,<br/>
not the reasons that you are relevant, meaningful, and should be heard.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I feel we should get a better healing spells, and <br/>
&gt;much more powerful attacking spells. We are suppose to be the &quot;paladin <br/>
&gt;opposers&quot; ..hardly..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You make an opinion, but don&#39;t back it up with any supporting statements.<br/>
This is meaningless to him.  Following up with &quot;hardly&quot; is an unnecessary<br/>
slap that only turns him off.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of quoting someone else&#39;s e-mail, sit down and figure out ALL the<br/>
issues that SKs have, including choice of spells, lack of healing<br/>
capability, lack of basic helpful spells that other classes count on (heal,<br/>
better damage, and invis), lack of a kick/dual wield, and all of this<br/>
amplified by the evil nature of the class.  Write these up in a rational,<br/>
non-inflammatory manner, then send it in or post it for comment from others.<br/>
<br/>
Check out the posts on General messageboard by Bathory, she makes some<br/>
really cogent arguments that are intelligent, thoughtful, and non-inflammatory.<br/>
