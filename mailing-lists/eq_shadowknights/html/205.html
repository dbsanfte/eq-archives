<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484968140">Yes, I also disagree when people say Ogres and Trolls make the best Shadow<br/>
Knights. At higher levels, one would use alot of mana for the various<br/>
reasons. If you play a Shadow Knight as a warrior, then yes, Trolls and<br/>
Ogres are WAY better. However, before engaging into combat, I would not cast<br/>
Engulfing Darkness and start bashing. At later levels, spectres hit for 90s<br/>
and it is impossible to tank anymore; thus, we are required to be more<br/>
strategic than just continuously bash. Therefore, one would use Darkness &gt;<br/>
Fear &gt; Heart &gt; Blood &gt; Strength &gt; Diease (swap usage order according to<br/>
situation, and repeat some of the DoT to renew them if possible) before<br/>
engaging into melee. As seen in the technique above, one requires to have as<br/>
much mana as posssible; this is when the Human and Dark Elf Shadow Knights<br/>
have an advantage over the large races. Sure, at low levels, Ogres and<br/>
Trolls are better simply because there is not many DoT to throw around. But<br/>
once stacking is possible, you want to drain as many HP from the mob as<br/>
possible before melee. The reason is because you cannot tank anymore without<br/>
a cleric at high levels. To all the Dark Elves out there, do not be<br/>
discouraged - there is a reason why the Darkness spell slows down the<br/>
target, it is to allow us to stack more and cast before engaging into melee;<br/>
do not bash like the Ogres and Trolls.</div>
