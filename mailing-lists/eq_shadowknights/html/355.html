<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586903721">Hey I do too!<br/>
<br/>
I have combined some bronze, blackened, and banded to create a pretty neat <br/>
combo.  I like to use a tentacle whip when posing for pics ( as I lash the <br/>
photographer for full effect}.  I refuse to wear a helmet, as DE female hair <br/>
looks better flowing free and my SK has the red eyes of hate as well.<br/>
<br/>
Back to business.  On the EQvaul developers board I have placed a post <br/>
regarding the SK pet, as other gripes are old.  Please go to the Vault and <br/>
give your two copper.  I feel the winds of change!  They will not hear about <br/>
the HT issue anymore as they are well aware of our displeasure.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy our Nations B-day.  Have a safe 4th and I&#39;ll talk to you all soon.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;As much as I like to have my character forever, I know I will have to quit<br/>
&gt;one day. So, I&#39;ve been taking screenshots of my character&#39;s developement. <br/>
&gt;As<br/>
&gt;most of you know, I always strive to be coolest looking Shadow Knight<br/>
&gt;around. Thus, I arrange my armor to be the most fashionable as possible,<br/>
&gt;despite the less AC. To make a long story short, I would like to see other<br/>
&gt;Dark Elf SKs in action or posing (don&#39;t really want to see Ogres and Trolls<br/>
&gt;because they are not as awesome-looking). If you got a cool, spiffy<br/>
&gt;screenshot of your SK in .jpg format, please send it my way at<br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:howard.chan@...">howard.chan@...</a> . Btw, did I mention that we need the lifetap series?<br/>
&gt;hehe<br/>
