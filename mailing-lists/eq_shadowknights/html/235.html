 </span></blockquote>Wow! I have never seen anyone doing over 100 before. Hmm, I must be blinded<br/>
when I see high 30 Rangers doing 17 with their Demon Claws. And I must also<br/>
be mistaken when I see a level 40+ doing an average of 60 with the Reaver.<br/>
But that is okay, because they could be doing high 100s in your own world.<br/>
High 100s, eh? Why not 9999 damage as seen in Final Fantasy games?<br/>
<br/>
I would like to quote you on something, &quot;I know that a level 20 warrior with<br/>
the executioners axe can do 100 damage&quot;. First, you condemn me for having<br/>
the Dark Reaver at my level, then you go on to state that a level **20**<br/>
WITH an **Executioner&#39;s Axe** can do **over 100**??  . . . I am not sure<br/>
myself, but I think I see something wrong with that. Quite obviously, you<br/>
are UNCERTAIN of your position of your argument. In addition, you give<br/>
evidence that is completely FALSE. A level 20 with an Executioner&#39;s Axe, is<br/>
a &#39;cheap bastard&#39; as you would have called it, because there is no way he<br/>
could have obtained it himself (unless he bought it). Also, I have yet to<br/>
see a level 40+ with an Executioner&#39;s Axe that can do over 80; stating &#39;over<br/>
100&#39; at level 20 already proves that you are pulling numbers out of a hat.<br/>
<br/>
It is very interesting to see how people react to others who get higher<br/>
level equipment. Those people believe that unless you camped for the item,<br/>
you are not allowed to use it even if you have enough money to afford it.<br/>
Perhaps when you have collected enough snake fangs to get your Mino Axe, I<br/>
should call you a &#39;cheap bastard&#39; and condemn you for having equipment that<br/>
is out of your league. Just like what you did to me.<br/>
<br/>
Think about the following: IF I was a level 1 walking in Full Plate, why<br/>
would you care?? So, what if I have an advantage over you - does that affect<br/>
your game play in any way? Or is it that you are so jealous of my equipment,<br/>
that you must condemn me for what I have?<br/>
