<b>Subject:</b> Quest probs, from post made to EQ newsgroup... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615156900">Well, where shall I begin. I&#39;ve reiterated this story of my plight over<br/>
and over to GMs, on EQvault message boards and peeved my guildmembers<br/>
right off going on about it. This is a plea for help as a long sequence<br/>
of events really, really put me off EQ.<br/>
<br/>
It all started a month or so ago. I play a Human ShadowKnight, born in<br/>
Freeport on the Cazic Thule server. I really enjoyed my early playing<br/>
days and was well addicted up to about level 12. This was when the game<br/>
first came out. Anyway, im not a powergamer in the slightest and enjoy<br/>
the finer sides of Everquest - exploring new areas, travelling,<br/>
roleplaying and doing Quests. <br/>
<br/>
Now I was quite impressed with the number of quests available to me,<br/>
mainly in the ShadowKnights and rogues guild under the city of Freeport.<br/>
I quickly set off at doing them, and discovered a nice SK quest which<br/>
seemed to lead to a series (well im guessing it did) of other quests.<br/>
The first quest was to assassinate a messenger from Qeynos (most fun<br/>
&lt;g&gt;) carrying a letter meant for the hall of truth. I found him in<br/>
westcommons, and brutally executed him, buhahah. I took the message he<br/>
carried back to the guy who had set me the quest. He was very pleased<br/>
and informed me that he had another quest for me. NOW THIS IS WHERE IT<br/>
ALL WENT PEAR SHAPED!!!<br/>
<br/>
The quest said &quot;blah blah so antonious bayle is helping the hall of<br/>
truth, I thought as much etc etc, then I was told - someone called Lady<br/>
Shae is staying in Freeport at the moment, but is heading back to Qeynos<br/>
soon&quot;, he told me how she was carrying a magical &quot;artifact&quot; meant for<br/>
Antonious Bayle, and I was, quite clearly told to &quot;assassinate&quot; her, and<br/>
take the artifact to him. Well I found Shae at about level 8ish, and she<br/>
coned re. I laid off, built up and at around level 12ish I think it was,<br/>
she only conned yellow. She&#39;s in the hoggfallers (correct spelling plz!)<br/>
inn, in west Freeport. Now back in these days Shae was TOOOUGH. She had<br/>
the charm spell (at the time it was bugged) and wasn&#39;t afraid to use it!<br/>
<br/>
I managed to rope some of my guildmates and some other adventurers into<br/>
helping me kill her. Through the course of the next 2 weeks, I managed<br/>
to notch up over 10 kills on her. Each time taking a heeeavy faction hit<br/>
with the people of Faydwer (gaining faction with the crushbone orcs tho<br/>
:P). This wasn&#39;t without loss though. Many times our assaults on her<br/>
went wrong, and all in all about 8 deaths were taken to &quot;my side&quot;, be<br/>
them by my or those helping me or innocents wandering around. However,<br/>
she NEVER dropped the artifact! After killing her 7 times i&#39;d petitioned<br/>
and was ASSURED the quest was NOT broken, and I had to &quot;keep at it&quot;<br/>
because she should drop it. The GM told me he&#39;d had to kill &quot;MOBs as<br/>
much as 10 times before they drop a quest item&quot;. Well fair enough but<br/>
this had already ruined the roleplaying aspect. I was sent to<br/>
assassinate her and get what she carried. When im doing it over and over<br/>
waiting for her to respawn it just, well I dunno, didn&#39;t feel as good.<br/>
<br/>
This really pissed me off, she wasn&#39;t dropping it and I gave up after 12<br/>
kills. A few weeks later at level 13/14 I went back. (this was after a<br/>
few patches). Well they&#39;d toned Lady Shae down. She no longer had/has<br/>
charm and doesn&#39;t really use her spells. She also coned blue to me and I<br/>
was able to solo her. I killed her a few more times - no artifact. So, i<br/>
went back and did the original quest again (killing the messenger). This<br/>
time I was lead on to the Shae quest (as before) BUT, it had changed!! I<br/>
was now told much the same except that Lady Shae now carried something<br/>
called &quot;The Bayle List&quot; which belonged to Antonious Bayle, and which I<br/>
was to retrieve from her. <br/>
<br/>
Great I think!! They&#39;ve obviously fixed it, so I go back (by the way the<br/>
whole time im killing her when she&#39;s down stairs) and I kill her a few<br/>
more times. She doesn&#39;t drop anything other then some cash. I think, hmm<br/>
perhaps it&#39;s in her room!? So, i get a friend to talk to her bodyguard,<br/>
the dwarf. I go and find the bakery in Freeport which sells muffins (the<br/>
Brownloe bakery) and I get my friend to inform the bodyguard of the<br/>
Brownloe bakery. This causes him to leave his post and walk out of the<br/>
inn. I can then charge in and kill Lady Shae in her room. She doesn&#39;t<br/>
drop a thing. I search the room - nothing. I do this over a few times<br/>
and manage to screw up one time and die to the dwarf. More deaths over<br/>
this quest. I create another character and go and speak to Shae about<br/>
this &quot;Bayle List&quot;. When asked about it, Shae says &quot;i&#39;d have to be<br/>
dancing with pink mammoths before i discuss anything to do with<br/>
Antonious Bayle&quot;. Hmmm, so i get her drunk with wine and ask her again.<br/>
(this meant begging for money with a lev 1 char hehe). No go, same reply<br/>
about pink mammoths.<br/>
<br/>
And so im stumped. I&#39;ve been messed about. I&#39;ve logged on to other<br/>
servers and asked fellow SKs for help (haven&#39;t really found any other<br/>
SKs into questing). I post on message boards far and wide. I&#39;ve<br/>
petitioned again, simply asking for clarification that this quest isn&#39;t<br/>
broken (not that it will do any good hearing that again - they told me<br/>
before the quest wasn&#39;t broken but it obviously was and they changed<br/>
it).<br/>
<br/>
The struggle with this quest put me right off EQ. I stopped playing for<br/>
over 2 weeks and only just recently have started again, in a vain<br/>
attempt to lay this god-forsaken quest to rest. The only slight hint<br/>
i&#39;ve had is that someone knew something of the Bayle List but said that<br/>
the Mammoth in Surefall had eaten it, and that there was a whole<br/>
separate quest involved with the Bayle List.<br/>
<br/>
Please help me, or Brad, restore some faith!<br/>
