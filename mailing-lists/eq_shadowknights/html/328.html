<div id="ygrps-yiv-608505714">Question, Pet will not attack in PvP?  How did the enchanter pet attack us?<br/>
or their pet has different rules?   or am I confused again?<br/>
<br/>
Also I have had a pet named &quot;Loser&quot; before :)  and current nick name for my<br/>
pet(s) &quot;Milk Bone&quot; :)<br/>

GUYS!!!<br/>
<br/>
OUR PET WILL NOT DEFEND YOU IN PVP!!!  Do not even consider it a factor!<br/>
Gebeker will stand there and let you get pounded, period.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Enchanters?  FORGET IT, DO NOT FIGHT<br/>
THEM.  Teshan (lvl 1) will eliminate your higher level advantage and you<br/>
will find yourself charmed over and over attacking critters while the caster<br/>
meditates and lays DoT on you.  Lucky for us, we have more Hp than the<br/>
Enchanter can take away without having us tank other monsters.  Unlucky for<br/>
us, the last thing a good enchanter does is summon her OWN pet and giggle as<br/>
we consider attacking her  while we sport 40% life and face her same level<br/>
animation, allowing her to meditate and finish us off if we choose to hang<br/>
around. Wizards?  Nuff said.  Clerics?  LOL!!  Good luck!  The Druid is RAW<br/>
POWER.  The Monk will Kung Foo our goofy ass back to respawn.  The<br/>
Shaman....I&#39;ve spanked a bunch of Shaman Highlanders, I would give us a<br/>
60/40 advantage.<br/>
