<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-934986020">In my futile attempts to get the Ring of the Dead, I have done the <br/>
fire beetle eye quest 3 or 4 times, the paladin quest, and turned in<br/>
the Thex Mallet.  I now am working on the Kerran Beetle eye and Bull<br/>
Elephant Tusk quest, hoping that it will give me the ring.  The woman<br/>
already offers to recharge it, but I cannot find where to get it.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend I managed to obtain the tusk dropped by Cracked Tusk.  <br/>
The actual item is a gigantic chipped tusk.  By the words of the quest<br/>
he says to bring the beetle eyes, but before I do that, bring him<br/>
the tusk of a bull elephant.  Now I have killed many bull elephants,<br/>
and all I ever get is a small mammoth tusk.  So I figured that this<br/>
named elephant might be the key.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve waited in S Karanas now for weeks searching for Cracked Tusk<br/>
and auctioning enough to drive anyone mad, when finally I got an <br/>
offer to buy it for 20pp.  Ouch.  I bit the bullet, bought the tusk<br/>
and ran back to Neriak.<br/>
<br/>
I turned in the gigantic chipped tusk without the beetle eyes <br/>
(I was supposed to turn it in first), and got a worthless junk message.<br/>
<br/>
What I would like to do, is compile a list of failed attempts (I<br/>
assume anyone successful is keeping it to themselves) of doing this<br/>
quest.  Please include exactly what you have turned in.<br/>
<br/>
So far:<br/>
<br/>
Failed:<br/>
	1 small mammoth tusk<br/>
	1 box of beetle eyes<br/>

Also, is this quest just broken and I&#39;m wasting my time?<br/>
<br/>
