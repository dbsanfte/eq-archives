<div id="ygrps-yiv-677562293">Before anyone says that I am wrong, I would like to point out that what I&#39;ve<br/>
wrote on the Soul Reaver could be false information. I found out that my<br/>
source was not as reliable. Thus, what I heard from him is most likely not<br/>
accurate. I did, however, hear it being sold before. But other than that,<br/>
the claim that it has the stats of 20/32, Steal Strength and with the<br/>
appearance of a mist Fiery Avenger is most likely false.</div>
