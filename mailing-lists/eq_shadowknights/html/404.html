<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033555586">hehehe, OK not again, I just finally did a /feedback.  Watch out for the<br/>
page limits I hit the end and had to do a &quot;to be continued&quot; at the end of<br/>
the message and start another feedback.<br/>
<br/>
Basically I said I didn&#39;t like harm touch resisted being that it felt like a<br/>
god gift, and thinking about it later it shouldn&#39;t be resisted because it is<br/>
not a trainable skill item.  If it was trainable, sure then make it resist.<br/>
Then said that invisibility need to be moved to an earlier level.  Also said<br/>
if an undead can cast it we should be able to cancel it (get rid of rabies<br/>
mainly).  Necro has their pets to get rabies (so they avoid it) and cost<br/>
them very little, where we have to deal with it directly.  Also had heard<br/>
about an light spell that we get at level 49 (not sure if this is true) but<br/>
thought that should be changed.  Really thinking about the spells/pet... get<br/>
rid of pet we are the tank, give us the means to cure ourselves (again hate<br/>
rabies) and a life tap series and maybe better Direct Damage spells.  Lets<br/>
face it pets don&#39;t attack in PvP areas and they are suppose to make us<br/>
stronger and they don&#39;t.  We ARE the tank, don&#39;t need no stinking pet.  Oh,<br/>
and also they should get rid of the mend bones, since we don&#39;t have the pet,<br/>
unless we want to heal our party&#39;s necro pet :)<br/>
<br/>
Kez (July 8, 1999 e-mail) was collecting info/suggestions for the petition<br/>
and Amatai (July 7, 1999 e-mail) was they both were looking for login<br/>
(account) ID&#39;s and I really didn&#39;t want to pass mine out since I really<br/>
don&#39;t know either of them, and because my password is real easy to guess.<br/>
Figure they can take these ideas from the list.  Plus they only have posted<br/>
a Subject &quot;Petition&quot; a few times on the list (no other posts) and I have<br/>
been on the list since very late April.  And yes I have kept all 312<br/>
e-mail&#39;s on the SK list since I joined. :)<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was Verant security/policy for you not to pass out your account<br/>
ID&#39;s. But not sure.  Do what you want, because I won&#39;t pass mine out.  I<br/>
would think everyone doing a feedback would be better, and do it from your<br/>
point of view, not mine or anyone else&#39;s.<br/>

What ever happened to that petition someone was<br/>
starting.  I have thought much about the changes we<br/>
want. I think that there should be no large changes.<br/>
You are forgetting that this is not supposed to be a<br/>
solo game and it is not supposed to be a exclusive<br/>
fighting game.  This is a role playing game.  Role<br/>
playing does involve fightng however so i am not<br/>
against alll changes.  I am tired of a petition from<br/>
every single *&%^ class about how they are uneven and<br/>
need to be made better. They are uneven for a reason.<br/>
It is a GROUP game. If there was a group (i know only<br/>
6 per group theoreticly speaking though) and there was<br/>
one of each class in it they could easily kill<br/>
something 2-5 levels higher then them. But if one of<br/>
the classes left say the warrior and got replaced by<br/>
the supposed &quot;most damage doing class&quot; wizard the<br/>
group would be killed because there is not a warrior<br/>
which is the best tank.  Sure the paladin and shadow<br/>
knight would tank but the would not lasts nearly as<br/>
long as the warrior.  I don&#39;t mind minor changes like<br/>
adding a non combat related spell that is what i call<br/>
&quot;god bestowed&quot; where as in the shadow knights case if<br/>
they got invisibility it should be something that the<br/>
evil god&#39;s do that makes them invisible such as<br/>
turning them into a shadow. As long as the change can<br/>
be &quot;god bestowed&quot; it is ok but just &#39;oh my paladin is<br/>
not good enough to solo i need a bow even though it is<br/>
against the code of paladins&#39; complaing type changes<br/>
that are against the RPing story of that class.<br/>
