<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270154283">Maybe I was wrong in my previous post, but when did paladins get bows?  I <br/>
haven&#39;t really been playing everquest because I have been bored of it, but <br/>
last I knew the general attitude of the paladin was that ranged combat was <br/>
dishonorable(description of the paladin on everquest page) and they could <br/>
not use the archery skill let alone any bows.<br/>

&gt;First of all, the paladin&#39;s spells are just as likely to be resisted as<br/>
&gt;ours.  I&#39;ve been rooted and blinded before, and it&#39;s very, very difficult <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;keep someone under both for any significant period of time.  5 rounds to<br/>
&gt;&quot;finish off the pet&quot; will be more than sufficient to get out of at least 1,<br/>
&gt;if not both.  An actual problem is that sometimes pets for SKs don&#39;t work <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;PvP.  The important part of the darkness spells is the slowing more than <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;damage. Starting a fight with siphon strength, which I&#39;ve never seen<br/>
&gt;resisted, does a 20 point switch in strength balance and gives the SK an<br/>
&gt;advantage in melee.   When the fight comes down to melee, which they all<br/>
&gt;eventually do, the SK is going to deal more damage much more quickly.  I <br/>
&gt;do,<br/>
&gt;however, concede the paladins have bows part.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have not ever lost to a paladin, and I don&#39;t attack anyone who is going <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;or has just got their corpse.  It&#39;s not that I play an honorable character,<br/>
&gt;as much as respect for another player.  My main point to all of this is <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;I do not believe SKs are weak, which you agree with at the beginning of <br/>
&gt;your<br/>
&gt;message to a degree.  I also do not believe SKs are significantly more<br/>
&gt;powerful than paladins, by the same token.  I&#39;m saying we have a comparable<br/>
&gt;level of power, except, perhaps, for HT being resisted.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Before I continue any further, let me say that I do not believe the SK <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt; overly weak. Being a hybrid with downtime equaling a Warrior, obviously,<br/>
&gt; &gt; seem unfair. But other than the downtime and the useless, class-specific<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill (HT), I believe that the SK is one of the most interesting class <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; play. In fact, I would go on to say that we can do the most damage out <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; all melee classes in a fight with an NPC (Double Attack + Pet + DoT = <br/>
&gt;mega<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage). I also believe that it is not too overly important to travel<br/>
&gt;before<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 30. For many levels, I have never needed to travel anywhere that<br/>
&gt;would<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill me on sight. There are always places to fight up to level 30; at<br/>
&gt;which<br/>
&gt; &gt; point, we do actually get Gather Shadows. Now, I will address Mr.<br/>
&gt;Stovall&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; post:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Scenario 1:<br/>
&gt; &gt; What is the first DoT that the Shadow Knight would use? Engulfing<br/>
&gt;Darkness.<br/>
&gt; &gt; What is the first spell the Paladin would use? Flash of Light. Now, <br/>
&gt;let&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; assume they both go off. No resists, no fizzles, no interruption. The SK<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt; blinded, the Paladin is free to kill the pet. Once the pet is gone,<br/>
&gt;Paladin<br/>
&gt; &gt; blinds the Shadow Knight again, repeat until SK is dead.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Scenario 2:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Let&#39;s assume that Engulfing Darkness is casted upon the Paladin. The<br/>
&gt;Paladin<br/>
&gt; &gt; would just fight the SK and the pet. The pet&#39;s attack = Center + Spirit<br/>
&gt; &gt; Armor. So, it is basically down to LH versus HT + DoT. And as we all <br/>
&gt;know,<br/>
&gt; &gt; HT and a 100HP DoT does not compensate for LH.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Scenario 3:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Let&#39;s consider what you said in your scenario. The pet is gone and <br/>
&gt;Paladin<br/>
&gt; &gt; has taken more damage. Is the Shadow Knight able to get the Paladin down<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the point where the HT will defeat the Paladin? No. It might have took 5<br/>
&gt; &gt; rounds at most to finish off the pet; thus, the Paladin is far from <br/>
&gt;being<br/>
&gt; &gt; dead (during that time, the Paladin might have lost 200HP at most -<br/>
&gt; &gt; considering that all the arrows hit and DoT). Once the pet is gone, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; battle turns over. All the Paladin needs to do is to Blind, Root and <br/>
&gt;Heal.<br/>
&gt; &gt; That was excluding Center and Spirit Armor.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Personally, I do not see why the Paladin would go for the SK when he/she<br/>
&gt; &gt; knows that the pet is the main disrupter of spells. In addition, you<br/>
&gt;failed<br/>
&gt; &gt; to consider that a Paladin can also have a bow. With the combination<br/>
&gt;Blind,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Root, shoot and Heal, the Paladin is always one step ahead of the Shadow<br/>
&gt; &gt; Knight in fights. Basically, the reason why a Paladin will defeat a SK <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt; because of a few simply spells.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As for winning unrigged fights with red-cons, I really find that hard to<br/>
&gt; &gt; believe. Red-cons would resisted Darkness, Fear and Harm Touch. The Harm<br/>
&gt; &gt; Touch will not compensate for their LH at that point. Furthermore, at<br/>
&gt;higher<br/>
&gt; &gt; levels, they are able to hit more often with higher damage; while taking<br/>
&gt; &gt; less hits. I can see a Shadow Knight defeating red-con Warriors and <br/>
&gt;Monks.<br/>
&gt; &gt; However, looking at all the above factors makes me disbelieve that a<br/>
&gt;Paladin<br/>
&gt; &gt; can lose to a blue-formidable-con Shadow Knight at best. Perhaps you <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; strategy that I do not see? Or perhaps the Paladin was on the way to<br/>
&gt; &gt; retrieve his/her corpse?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I disagree.  I&#39;m on Rallos Zek, PvP.  What an SK does while rooted is<br/>
&gt;fire<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;his bow, send his pet, and stack his DoTs.  Fletching is a very, very<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;important ability that usually gets overlooked.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;In the same scenario the SK have a 30+ damage bow.  He gets rooted,<br/>
&gt;starts<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;firing arrows.  The pet gets up in the paladin&#39;s face - good for<br/>
&gt; &gt; disruption.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;The paladin has 2 choices.  Deal with the SK or deal with the pet.  If <br/>
&gt;he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;deals with the pet, obviously the SK will tear the crap out of him.  So<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;he&#39;ll attack the SK.  While he&#39;s trying to blind, he gets hit with an<br/>
&gt; &gt; arrow,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;bashed by a pet, etc which has a good chance of spell disruption, and<br/>
&gt;gets<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Engulfed in darkness.  If he gets the blind, he&#39;ll probably waste the <br/>
&gt;pet<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;while your blinded.  By the time the root&#39;s over, the paladin notices <br/>
&gt;he<br/>
&gt; &gt; has<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;taken more damage, and is currently slowed with a pissed off SK in his<br/>
&gt; &gt; face.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;These kinds of things won&#39;t work you say?  I&#39;ve never lost a fight with <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;paladin, even yellow and red ones.<br/>
