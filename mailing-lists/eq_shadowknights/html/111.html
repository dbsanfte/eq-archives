  I&#39;m switching to the Rallos Zek server to kill a few of those goodie goodies and am wondering what my INT has to be to cast leering corpse at level 10?  My troll now on E&#39;ci is level 10, almost level 11, and still can&#39;t it and I don&#39;t want to make this mistake again.  I believe my INT is around 62 on E&#39;ci. Thanks<br/>
