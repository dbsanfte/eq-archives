<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167815733">From my experiences, a Shadow Knight cannot be played like a ranger or a<br/>
paladin. Because we cannot hit for as much damage as a ranger, nor do we<br/>
have heals to heal ourselve after battle, we need to use other tactics to<br/>
win. The way to do this is to strategically use the darkness, fear, syphon,<br/>
disease spells that we have. From this, I have a tendency to relay more on<br/>
magic than others. In other words, intelligence plays a heavier role in our<br/>
class than one would think. Dark Elf, being the most intelligent of the<br/>
given races, thus provide a tool for victory. In addition, Dark Elves Shadow<br/>
Knight looks sooooooooooooo cool with black armor and a scythe (too bad the<br/>
Dark Reaver is not a scythe . . . ).<br/>
To compare Troll with a DE, Trolls get killed on sight in some places,<br/>
whereas Dark Elves are spared from death. Nevertheless, they each have their<br/>
own good. But in the end, it all depends on how you play and how cool you<br/>
want to look.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I am curious as well. I had a 13th level troll shadowknight and ended up<br/>
&gt;quiting it because I got sick of kill stealers on the Rathe (play on RK<br/>
&gt;now). I had the thought that trolls made the best SK bar none because of<br/>
&gt;regenerate and the ability to bash with a two handed sword; but now am<br/>
&gt;thinking dark elf just because of I like the image. (but no bash unless<br/>
&gt;using a shield). Ah well. So all you dark elves the question is why? </span></blockquote></div>
