<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688235179">guys i know how to complete this quest. Cracktusk or<br/>
whatever his name is in south karana is a rare spawn<br/>
elephant who sometimes drops bull elephant tusk. i<br/>
killed him yesterday and he dropped a gigatic chipped<br/>
tusk or something. me and my necro friend were very<br/>
happy cause we thought it would work for the quest so<br/>
she got some beetle eyes from kerra isle and went back<br/>
to neriak and it didn&#39;t work :( after a little while<br/>
of myself yelling at a gm, the gm told me that<br/>
cracktusk drops the bull elephant tusks but it is<br/>
rare...cracktusk is rare enough so good luck.<br/>
