Actually, in Player versus Monster situation, we excel. Because we have a<br/>
pet, ~250 damage DoT (level 30 Darkness and Blood) and melee, Shadow Knights<br/>
can deal the most damage in the shortest amount of time compared with other<br/>
hybrids. However, when one considers the amount of time the Shadow Knight<br/>
needs to heal after the battle, one would then see our weakness. Although<br/>
warriors has to do the same thing, they do not take an experience penalty.<br/>
At this point, one can clearly see that the Shadow Knight will take the<br/>
longest time to level up.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the above, I believe Xillith raised a good point about the<br/>
pet being jumped on by every monster in the dungeon. Most of us will agree<br/>
that the pet is completely useless in the dungeons, and might even get us<br/>
killed in the process. Now, take into consideration that the pet, who is<br/>
suppose to balance out the &#39;kick&#39; of a Ranger or Warrior, might also take<br/>
some of our experience along with them, one can then see that we got a class<br/>
that needs to be redone<br/>
<br/>
In conclusion, take note of the following:<br/>
- exp penalty<br/>
- bad factions<br/>
- useless pet indoors and somewhat outdoors<br/>
- the only hybrid that cannot heal to compensate for the downtime<br/>
- resistable HT<br/>
- Darkness spells are resisted ALOT even on blues, more on yellows and reds<br/>
(I had it resisted 4 out of 4 times on a low blue)<br/>
<br/>
Some may say it gets better on higher levels, but what I&#39;ve stated applies<br/>
to all levels (and this same thing is said from another 48 Shadow Knight on<br/>
the same server, so all this is based on anything before the 49th level<br/>
spells). Is it worth it to go on? I would not. But would one want all that<br/>
time that went into the SK to be wasted? No.</div>
