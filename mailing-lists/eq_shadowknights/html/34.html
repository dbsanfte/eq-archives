<div id="ygrps-yiv-452140311">I totally agree.  Supposedly, our spells also get more powerful the higher in leverl we get.  <br/>
So we come into our own around 30-40th level.  I have no idea if it&#39;s worth it <br/>
and, no matter how you cut it, lay hands is superiour to harm touch.  I&#39;d like to <br/>
see some discussion as to what does make our class exceptional in addition <br/>
to its roleplaying posibilites.  Do our unholy weapons compare to the holy <br/>
swords?  Anyone seen one of them?  Any more thoughts on this?<br/>

&gt; I think harm touch and lay on hands are pretty damn unbalanced myself. I been <br/>
&gt; harm touch in theory is friggin, great, especially at lower levels. But as <br/>
&gt; people get higher levels say level 30, to times 30 giving a 300hp harmtouch <br/>
&gt; is in now way going to be as worthwhile as lay on hands giving a level 30 <br/>
&gt; Paladin their 700-800 odd hp back! What&#39;s more, harmtouch CAN be resisted <br/>
&gt; either totaly or partialy. Also on the EQlizer site, it says basically that <br/>
&gt; the lev 15 spells we get aren&#39;t all that useful. That said we are supposidly <br/>
&gt; 3/4 warrior and 1/4 necro &lt;g&gt; but perhaps we should get a lil more power for <br/>
&gt; being SO damn neglected by society, and we dont even have inviso to visit <br/>
&gt; those exotic locations as the necros do!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; tell me what ya think and appologies for typos, im not proofreading im tired <br/>
