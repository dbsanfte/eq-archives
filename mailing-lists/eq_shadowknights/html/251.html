        I was just making an observation with this statement.  The only packs I know of that add about zero weight are a shaman summon spell, and that bag disappears as soon as you logout, as well as the items stored in the bag.  Also these bags only have 4 slots, and have heard you can place 15 lbs. bricks of ore into them and it apples only a fraction of the weight to your encumbrance load (which is good for hunting ... rock dervs(?) in fire storm that give you these bricks).  I WISH they would come out with a magic backpack that would do this, that wouldn&#39;t disappear at logout time. (how about that =)<br/>

            I need cash to get banded armor to compensate for my DE&#39;s low fighter charastics.<br/>
             <br/>

                And note I am not getting any experience from these trips (and if I could find a magic backpack that would carry 8 slots with no weight, or lower weight I would be trying to find them). </span></blockquote></div>
