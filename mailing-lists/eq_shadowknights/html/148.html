<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950761609">Hmmmmmm thanks for the info. I wonder perhaps if this is indeed the same <br/>
quest, perhaps Lady Shae saying &quot;she&#39;d have to be dancing with pink mamonths <br/>
before talking about antonious bayle&quot; (when asked about the Bayle list) is a <br/>
clue.... it seems however a bit too subtle to me. I really wanna get this <br/>
quest cracked though, please keep the ideas coming!<br/>
