<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767588544">First off for all you scenario makers and hit<br/>
point compareres the the paladin would beat the crap<br/>
out of an SK. The paladin at level 30 with all his<br/>
buffs will have around 800hp&#39;s + Lay Hands gives him<br/>
in essence 1600 hit points. Now if the SK uses his<br/>
&quot;mighty&quot; harm touch the paladin is down to 500 hit<br/>
points.  The two skills are VERY unequal.  HT does not<br/>
even com close to LH.  SK&#39;s are not weak but are<br/>
inferior to paladins at this point.  And anyway why<br/>
the heck do us Shadow Knights Get EXP PENALTIES?<br/>
Paladins get a BONUS while we get a PENALTY? Why do<br/>
the evil classes get the EXP penalties?  All of my<br/>
friends started the same time i did they are level 21<br/>
i am level 15 because of the EXP and i have played<br/>
more then them.  The EXP penaltis are stupid as they<br/>
serve no roleplaying service and EQ is a roleplaying game.<br/>
