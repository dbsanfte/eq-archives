<b>Subject:</b> Will not sufficient?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279663828">Does anyone here know why it says &quot;Your will is not sufficient to command<br/>
this weapon&quot; when I swing my sword? Does that mean I cannot wield it or does<br/>
that mean that my level is not high enough to use its potential powers?</div>
