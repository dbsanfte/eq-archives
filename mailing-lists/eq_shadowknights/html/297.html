<div id="ygrps-yiv-617497696">Hello Chris,<br/>
<br/>
     I have to admit I am divided on the subject.  While it is true that we <br/>
are limited in where we can solo, not all SKs are unable to travel.  I am a <br/>
female DE on Zek, I am able to freely roam the Ogre and Troll lands and thus <br/>
give me access to Rathe and South Karana.  I hunted the wuss side of High <br/>
Hold and the NPCs in the Karanas untill my High Hold Faction was high enough <br/>
to simply walk through wistling.<br/>
I wish I did have invis when crossing the Oasis or attempting to get to the <br/>
ship in Freeport or simply to zone into EC durring peak Pace War time.  Non <br/>
evil races can move through these areas too, but getting past gate guardss <br/>
for a bind in the city will be a trick.  Remeber, EQ is a team game.  Have <br/>
you hugged your Enchantress today?  She gets invis at level 4.  Mind you, <br/>
wizards do not get it untill level 16 and spells are their business.<br/>
     I want to see a pet that will not just stand there picking its butt <br/>
when someone blasts me with lightening.  Is it so hard to assign the masters <br/>
PvP range to the pet upon casting?  I do not believe the programming code <br/>
for that would be very difficult. I would like to see my harm touch go to <br/>
15hp per level or become a no resist attack or return more than once per day <br/>
with at least one hour in between ( to prevent imballancing PvP ).  Perhaps <br/>
SK unique spells?<br/>
Why is it so impossible for us to have Life Tap at level 15?  Do those 10 hp <br/>
matter that much when compared our 350+?<br/>
     HECK we have one attack and a level 8 skellie untill 20th when we get <br/>
our second attack that doesn&#39;t get up to speed untill learly level 22 when <br/>
we get the whopping level 12 skellie, who still will not defend me from <br/>
other players, but at least I can give &#39;ol loser bones a Vampiric Hug for <br/>
some life back (haven&#39;t tried this yet).<br/>
<br/>
Question:  How long does a level 12 skellie last in Guk?<br/>
Answer:  Long enough to bring the house down on you because of its low <br/>
level, and die.<br/>
<br/>
We have a whole slew of issues.<br/>
<br/>
All I ever hear is it gets better at level X.  I very much enjoy the SK and <br/>
all of its roleplay potential, but Verant didn&#39;t do a very good job <br/>
ballancing her against others in the PvP arena or the battlefield.<br/>

&gt;    Hello. I am sure many of you other shadow knights<br/>
&gt;have thought of this but we must take action about<br/>
&gt;this subject: Shadow Knights NEED invisibility at<br/>
&gt;earlier levels.  They DO get the spell but at level<br/>
&gt;30. I think they should get it at level 22 because of<br/>
&gt;two main reasons. 1) We are hybrids so we already have<br/>
&gt;some EXP penalties and we can&#39;t get to three quarters<br/>
&gt;of the hunting grounds so are forced to hunt in the<br/>
&gt;area around our home city until level 30.  2) At level<br/>
&gt;2 we get the spells that necro&#39;s get at levek 8 EXCEPT<br/>
&gt;for the invisibility spell. All of us Shadow Knights<br/>
&gt;should join in and petition for invisibility at level<br/>
&gt;22! We can get them to change it. Feel free to drop me<br/>
&gt;a line if you are on fenin ro<br/>
&gt;<br/>
