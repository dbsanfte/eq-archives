<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-651085344">Actualy the exp penalty serves a purpose so that being a Hybrid early on is tough because at the later levels Hybrids are the most powerful classes. Also Paladin&#39;s do get a exp penalty especially Dwarven Paladin. If you want to level faster play a human because that race gets a bonus so you&#39;ll be leveling as fast as a Dark Elf Wizard or something else like it.</div>
