May I send you a few pictures? Perhaps that will convince you that no one<br/>
can tank a spectre. To put it simply, one must Ensnare or Darkness the<br/>
creature and run around until it is as dead as possible, then going oom<br/>
before you engage. No matter what armor you got and how many HP you have,<br/>
the spectre is still going to hit for 60, 70, 50, 80 in one round. Now, how<br/>
many of those rounds can 1000HP take?<br/>
I cannot disagree or agree with you on &#39;higher strength = higher damage&#39;<br/>
because it has not been proven yet. Do you use an Ogre or a Troll? If so,<br/>
what level are you? What damage do you do? And what weapon do you use?<br/>
Please email me personally concerning the picture and your stats at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:hchan@...">hchan@...</a> ; that is, if you wish to do so.</div>
