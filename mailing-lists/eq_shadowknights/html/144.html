Well, I don&#39;t know of the quest you are trying to complete, or if this<br/>
information has changed any, but I know of a &quot;friend&quot; of mine in Qeynos<br/>
who<br/>
happens to be a Paladin of the Temple of Thunder. She had orders from<br/>
her guild<br/>
leader, Runethar Hamest (spelling?) to go to Surefall Glade in the<br/>
Jaggedpines<br/>
and get the Bayle List from one of the Rangers there (name<br/>
forgotten-easy to<br/>
find, but evil is killed on sight) However, upon arriving, she finds<br/>
that the<br/>
Bayle list has been eaten, along with the Ranger&#39;s son (snicker) by the<br/>
great<br/>
Mammoth Beast of the Pines.  My &quot;friend&quot; knows of an entrance to the<br/>
cave where<br/>
the mammoth lives, but it&#39;s from inside Surefall. By the way, the<br/>
Mammoth is a<br/>
huge bear. And Antonius Bayle hired the Temple of Thunder to deliver the<br/>
list to<br/>
him, because he doesn&#39;t trust his own guards.  That&#39;s what I know of the<br/>
Bayle<br/>
list.  It could be that someone or something killed the mammoth, or the<br/>
quest<br/>
just suddenly changed, or perhaps there&#39;s more than one Bayle list<br/>
wandering<br/>
about, I don&#39;t know.  Just thought maybe this could be of some help. May<br/>
Innoruuk<br/>
guide your hatred.<br/>
