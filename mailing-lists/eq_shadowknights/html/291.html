Traveling to Faydwer at level 5 is suicide. You are KOS in every city there, and evading the first 2 guards at the docks is simple enough, but Butcherblock has several guardposts.<br/>

<br/>
  Hello all,<br/>
      I have just created a DE SK and have a few questions.<br/>
   <br/>
      1) Is there any place near freeport that i can buy food? I have found the Swashbuckler that will buy my loot but he sells no food.I find it degrading to ask the freeport residents to buy food and water for me.<br/>
   <br/>
      2) What is the method of getting on the boat and over to faydwer? I have spent all my leveling Killing orc pawns in the commons so All the guards that I can see at the gates will con me dubiously, but I have been afraid to enter(I am only level 5). Will all the guards in FP area regard me dubiously? And if I do make it over to BB, how do I elude the guards over near the docks of BB?<br/>
   <br/>
  Thank you<br/>
