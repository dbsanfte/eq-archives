<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880862613">Not, to get into this much because I just rolled to 15 last night, but I was<br/>
thought I was going to get a DoT spell and well NO (thought engulfing<br/>
darkness was DoT for some reason).  OK, Can&#39;t really travel effectively,<br/>
can&#39;t rely on HT, Pet gets wacked it 7 or 8 hits (haven&#39;t tried new pet<br/>
yet), No magic wepon.  OK, I see cleics using their summon 1h blunt hitting<br/>
wisp that are green to me, can I kill one(?), no... considering that my only<br/>
damage spell is disease cloud (5pts whoppy!).<br/>
<br/>
I was in fire storm yesterday for about 4 hours and felt like a big anchor.<br/>
My group was getting hit by elemental and all I could do their was just be a<br/>
hp sponge by trying to taunt while the magic classes attacked it.  Oh, and I<br/>
was level 14, the highest in the group.  But thinking about it now fighters<br/>
would also be sitting on the side lines in this area.  I know a 12 lvl magic<br/>
user who used root in this area and pushed himself up to like level 15 or 16<br/>
in a week or two (I will admit he was on for a very long time), he is now<br/>
like level 25.  Just kind of disappointing, not that I am going to give it<br/>
up, because people tell me that it gets better around level 22, but I agree<br/>
with the post that we should get the invisibility spell at 22, plus a<br/>
serious DoT spell just for making it to that level.  Anyway maybe we should<br/>
get a shadow knight only spell of some kind, make 1 or 2  for each spell<br/>
levels and make it a quest of some kind.  Maybe a Direct Damage spell like<br/>
harm touch is, but it just uses mana (but not the same damage amount),  or a<br/>
radius damage spell (thought those were cool looking), or how about a radius<br/>
life tap that give us hp back from all creatures around us ... just watch<br/>
out for your party!<br/>
<br/>
Also just wanted to ask, has anyone completed the quest for Sir Lindel<br/>
(something of the effect)  I found him last night, attacked him, he ran<br/>
away, I started to follow then he vanished, I had no lag, and nothing killed<br/>
him because he was still my target.  So, I waited for him to return.  He<br/>
came back full hit points, I attacked him again, he ran again, then I<br/>
started to follow him and then vanished again,  no lag, still targeted so<br/>
nothing had killed him.  Again he comes back, I get hit by an elemental from<br/>
behind, moved so elemental wasn&#39;t hitting me from behind, elemental and him<br/>
start attacking each other ... elemental kills him... grrr.  I don&#39;t under<br/>
stand why he vanished but now I have engulfing darkness, which I will use,<br/>
but just wondered what you will get when completing the quest... magic<br/>
weapon (I hope)? or just more faction bonus.  Also does anyone know where he<br/>
spawns at or is it just random?<br/>
