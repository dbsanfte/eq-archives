<br/>
<br/>
I started off as a Barbarian Warrior on Innoruuk server, and then I decided <br/>
to try out my Human Wizard. After realizing how big of a wuss my wizard was I <br/>
quit after level seven. When I first got the game I picked a Dark Elf Shadow <br/>
Knight, but it was confusing so I tried out about every race/class combo you <br/>
could. Finally I went back to my SK and I love it. The main reason I got it <br/>
is because of the sweet stats. They get VERY powerful at higher levels.<br/>
