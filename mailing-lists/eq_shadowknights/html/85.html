<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137489827">I disagree, I do not believe that we should receive the Dual Wield skill. A<br/>
single deadly wepon is all that we should carry. I think a specialization in<br/>
one wepon skill would enhance this even firther. This would fit the Knight type<br/>
of class quite well. We may be able to learn all types of wepons but<br/>
specialization in a single wepon as our main instrument of destruction!!! I<br/>
like this idea.<br/>

&gt;No, I don&#39;t think we should get dual wield. It make us way too powerful. In<br/>
&gt;addition, Paladins and SKs are more stereotyped to use two handed weapons<br/>
&gt;than having a blade in each hand; thus, giving us dual wield would cause us<br/>
&gt;to lose our uniqueness. I do think that we should get the Lifetap series and<br/>
&gt;a 100% working HT though.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Do you think Shadow Knights should get duel weild?<br/>
