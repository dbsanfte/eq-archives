<div id="ygrps-yiv-298411795">Yes, I have another complaint about the Shadow Knight. I just recently found<br/>
out that the Shadow Knight get Breath Of The Dead and Shadow Sight at level<br/>
49. While Paladins get a new line of buff and Revive at level 49, SKs get<br/>
spells that basically mimic a Greater Lighstone and a Fishbone Earring. Yes,<br/>
that is correct, my friends, after 49 levels of getting KOSed, experience<br/>
penalties and sitting for hours to heal, we are rewarded with an enhancement<br/>
to vision - ultravision that Dark Elves already have at level 1. And if one<br/>
has a Fishbone Earring, then &#39;Yay!&#39; for us because there goes another wasted<br/>
slot in the book. In conclusion, at level 50, the Shadow Knight will have<br/>
Voice Graft, Shieldskin, Breath Of The Dead and Shadow Sight that he/she<br/>
will never use.</div>
