<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004841702">MAGIC ITEMS FOR OUR CLASS?!?!<br/>
<br/>
WHERE?  I MUST KNOW!!  ANY ADVANTAGE OVER THE SCUM OF THE LIGHT MUST <br/>
BE EXPLOITED!  <br/>
<br/>
You tell me where the magic is, and I will tell you of a secret pass <br/>
into Quenos city.  That is valuable intel, on Rallos Zek!!!!!<br/>
