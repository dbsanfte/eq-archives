<div id="ygrps-yiv-386039150">I have to disagree that DE are the best SK. You have to remember we are 3/4<br/>
warrior 1/4 necro.  Now, at lower levels I would have to say that DE are even<br/>
or even better than Trolls and Ogres all the way up to around 22. But once you<br/>
get high enough str starts taking affect and the higher str equals more<br/>
damage.  Our spells are just there to do extra damage while we go at it with<br/>
our swords. If you think other wise then you should of played a necro because<br/>
you are going to be disappointed.  Now, I&#39;m not saying that our spells<br/>
suck. I am one of the people who like SK the way they are and think that there<br/>
is nothing wrong with the class.  I&#39;m just saying that we do not realy on our<br/>
spells but they are just there to complement us.  Plus whoever said about a<br/>
spectre hitting for 90 points that&#39;s not that big of a deal when you get higher<br/>
levels. With over 1000hp and full plate 90 points won&#39;t seem that high as it<br/>
does at lower levels.<br/>

&gt; You guys are crazy. Dark elfs are probably the best SK. For over all reasons<br/>
&gt; too. There stats are more balanced, they&#39;re int is higher, and eventually<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll pass up the ogre and troll in higher levels because of more powerful<br/>
&gt; spells<br/>
