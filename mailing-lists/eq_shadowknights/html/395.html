<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-634381089">New to the list so I apologize if this has been asked before but are there any Shadow Knight Only Weapons?  Does anyone here have a list of these weapons and the location or quest that one must do to acquire the weapon?<br/>
<br/>
I heard mention of Soul Reaver a couple of times in game. Does Soul Reaver exist and if so is it a quest item?</div>
