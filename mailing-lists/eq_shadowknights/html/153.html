<b>Subject:</b> Why are you playing a SK <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280251742">Since everyone has been quite for awhile, I thought<br/>
I&#39;d ask why everyone is playing a SK.  I am a Troll<br/>
SK and the reason why I&#39;m playing it is because I like<br/>
the idea of being evil plus being able to wield a 2h<br/>
sword while commanding a pet is just plain fun.<br/>
<br/>
Why is everyone else playing one?<br/>
