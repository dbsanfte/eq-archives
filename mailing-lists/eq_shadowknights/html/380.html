<b>Subject:</b> SK Petition <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669258688">So far I&#39;m happy to see that a few of you have taken interest in forming a petition.  You&#39;ve also had some interested ideas for changes that what I feel need to happen to at least bring the SK class up to par.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest two issues that I feel need to be addressed are HT & SK Pets.  I know I&#39;ve received alot of input concerning a lifetap series, but first I think we need to &quot;iron out&quot; the problems with HT and the Pets before we go out asking for more.<br/>
<br/>
Some other ideas that I&#39;ve been thinking about, as well as having been suggested to me is getting rid of useless spells like Voice Graft.  Also changes being made to Vampiric Touch would be quite useful, changes that are reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I will keep everyone informed of the progress with the petition and please keep up the support for the cause.  Please email me with your EQ User ID, email and character name so that I can include this in our petition so that they see that we are here and want to be heard.  I&#39;ve had a notice submitted to EQVault, hopefully they&#39;ll post something soon on the main page.<br/>
