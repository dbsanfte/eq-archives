&gt; of ore into them and it apples only a fraction of<br/>
&gt; the weight to your encumbrance load (which is good<br/>
&gt; for hunting ... rock dervs(?) in fire storm that<br/>

&gt; with a magic backpack that would do this, that<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t disappear at logout time. (how about that<br/>

everything half weight for 150pp I think the guys name<br/>
was paraflox or something like that.<br/>
