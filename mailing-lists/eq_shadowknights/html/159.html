<b>Subject:</b> Re: Why are you playing a SK <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-153165243">Why the SK?<br/>
     I feel the SK represents a sinister and ferocious warrior who draws her <br/>
power from the blackest Abyss. A Knight of such fearsome calliber as to be <br/>
the ONLY warrior class Mages are concerned with in PvP.  Skilled at arms and <br/>
Necromancy, the Shadow Knight and good &#39;ol Gebeker (hehe), tear into mages <br/>
and monsters with great ease.<br/>
     Soon my pet will dual wield, kick, AND bash.  With me beside it casting <br/>
Fear and Engulfing Darkness, few escape my wrath.  When the tables turn and <br/>
the enemy is too great, I unleash the Hand of Innorruk!!!  Thus returning <br/>
the battle to MY favor!  Still not enough?  The pet will hold my retreat and <br/>
Shadow Step will deny ANYONE the benefit of my death (people, this has saved <br/>
me SO many times!).  Why play a Shadow Knight??  Ask the other players why <br/>
they ARE NOT!!<br/>
<br/>
There are obvious roleplay challenges and benefits.  Up untill level 15, the <br/>
going was VERY rough as I am extremely interactive with other players.  But <br/>
understand this, the difficulties of our youth fuel our hate.  Our hate <br/>
feeds Innorruk and He in turn, and in due time, empowers us to be the <br/>
vessels of wrath and chaos we were meant to be.<br/>
<br/>
Patience young Reapers, night WILL fall on Norrath.<br/>
