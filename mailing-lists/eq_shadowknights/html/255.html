<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475627586">Hail!  Well met my brothers and sisters of hate and malice!<br/>
<br/>
What I would like to see is the stats on studded or reinforced leather.  I <br/>
realize that banded is likely better, but when in the SKs life is such <br/>
equipment warrented?  I am 19th and I have a suit of ringmail I collected in <br/>
High Hold, very heavy.  Tailoring is advancing slowly as hunting or ruined <br/>
pelts at my level is monotonous.<br/>
<br/>
I might sacrifice the ringmail for reinforced leather if the weight/cost <br/>
factor suits me.  Then again, DE females look FANTASTIC in  ringmail armour, <br/>
and good fashion is severely lacking in this game.  So, anyone who is <br/>
wearing the advanced leathers please tell me the stats and what they look <br/>
like equipped on a DE female.<br/>
<br/>
On another note.<br/>
<br/>
In response to earlier posts, I am no traitor to the Tier&#39;Dal.  Although on <br/>
Rallos Zek, the mighty rule the land.  A weaker Shadow Knight with a weapon <br/>
such as the Dark Reaver would definitely be a target to many of the raw PK <br/>
(Player Killer) guilds, as the weapon would sell for several hundred plat <br/>
simply because lower Guk is HELL and no one deserves the pain involved in <br/>
camping it.<br/>
<br/>
I am a member of the Blood Coven on Rallos Zek, a guild of DE females sworn <br/>
to defend DE purity.  I have killed many Tier&#39;Dal traitors and I have seen <br/>
the item lust and covetous nature of many players.  I was simply and <br/>
realistically stating that you must be prepared to defend your wealth and <br/>
yourself.<br/>
<br/>
I just cannot comprehend a Role Play world where I can carry around my best <br/>
gear all of  the time and never worry about High Elf raiders seeking blood <br/>
retribution or Dwarven clansmen initiating their young on my dark blood.  <br/>
You want to play Shadow Knights?  Play one on Rallos Zek, I dare you.  You <br/>
will never know what evil races can do until you have seen Darkenbane and <br/>
the Horde ( DEs, Ogres, and Trolls) grind their way through all of the <br/>
players and many of the guards ( sometimes merchants ) in West Freeport.  <br/>
The human newbee zone is a graveyard.<br/>
<br/>
THIS is why I am a Dark Elf, I am the Vanguard of evil.  The Dark Tower in a <br/>
world of light.  Neriak and The Nectulos forest are inviolate, as they were <br/>
meant to be.  Many players on the server are poor but NO ONE can say that we <br/>
haven&#39;t earned every copper.<br/>
<br/>
Tell you a story.<br/>
<br/>
You just don&#39;t know what it means to be an evil race until you zone into <br/>
East Commons from Nectulos, and stand face to face with a six-pack of 16th <br/>
level High Elf wizards...powering up.  The knock back saved my life, as I <br/>
zoned once again, with 18 life.  Shadow Step put over half the zone between <br/>
them and me with three leaps and the alarm went out.  The response was <br/>
staggering.  Newbies zoned into the commons to be spotters since they could <br/>
not be attacked and a respectable force collected, zoned, and beat their <br/>
ass.  They never returned and two of the bodies are still there in the dirt, <br/>
twisted by a half dozen harm touches.  Lucky for me a Freeport and Northern <br/>
Ro raid was forming that day, as scheduled, and I caught their muster.<br/>
<br/>
Such is life on Rallos Zek, war and hate made real.  The difference between <br/>
my server and ALL of the others is RESPECT.  You respect your people, or <br/>
they hunt you into deletion.  You respect your enemies<br/>
( and you have a bunch ) or they will over run you.  Guild tags begin to <br/>
mean something, typically the difference between relief and a rapid retreat <br/>
or the bagging of your favorite thingies.  Weight allowance??  BAH!  I keep <br/>
two backpacks empty incase I come across a pair of frisky halfling Druids or <br/>
for ANY excursion into East and West Nam...er...Commons.  I have come across <br/>
extremely rare loot that I outright sold wile thinking &quot; By the time I can <br/>
defend this item, I can camp for it myself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On Rallos Zek, an equipment inspection is often followed by a fire ball <br/>
instead of a &quot;cool gear&quot; compliment.<br/>
<br/>
I just cannot explain the experiences on Rallos Zek with words.<br/>
<br/>
You will quickly realise that friends and race are more important than  <br/>
stats and encumbrance.  The mages in my party hold my loot, and all of the <br/>
good armour and weapons goes to us tanks since we keep them alive.  I <br/>
haven&#39;t cared about weight since level 9.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;     And note I am not getting any experience from these trips (and if I <br/>
&gt;could find a magic backpack that would carry 8 slots with no weight, or <br/>
&gt;lower weight I would be trying to find them).<br/>
