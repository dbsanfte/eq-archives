<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863366001">Depending on your level, Lavastorm is never the place to hunt for money. At<br/>
low teens, I suggest you go to Najena to fight skeletons. Those skeletons<br/>
give better loot than the ones in Lavastorm considering the toughness and<br/>
downtime. At later levels, orc camps in Ecommons are good for experience;<br/>
which you will need to kill the Dervishes at high teens. The Dervishes are<br/>
what will get you most of the money.<br/>

&gt;Does anyone know of any magic weapons you can loot off some creature?  I<br/>
&gt;have run in to some major problems.  For some reason I don&#39;t seem to have<br/>
&gt;more than 10pp in the bank. </span></blockquote></div>
