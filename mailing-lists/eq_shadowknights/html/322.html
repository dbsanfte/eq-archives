<div id="ygrps-yiv-762470041">You get about 5 silver, a pat on the back, and rolling laughter from your <br/>
friends upon completeing most quests.  Want the Screaming mace?  Take up <br/>
brewing and BUY IT.<br/>
<br/>
Start over as a wizard on Zek and blast your way into riches.<br/>
<br/>
Dont mind me, I&#39;m very dissapointed.  For the previous post regarding it <br/>
getting better at 22...it doesn&#39;t.  I recomend you guys find great friends <br/>
who do not mind you leaching off their XP and level that way.<br/>

&gt;Not, to get into this much because I just rolled to 15 last night, but I <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;thought I was going to get a DoT spell and well NO (thought engulfing<br/>
&gt;darkness was DoT for some reason).  OK, Can&#39;t really travel effectively,<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t rely on HT, Pet gets wacked it 7 or 8 hits (haven&#39;t tried new pet<br/>
&gt;yet), No magic wepon.  OK, I see cleics using their summon 1h blunt hitting<br/>
&gt;wisp that are green to me, can I kill one(?), no... considering that my <br/>
&gt;only<br/>
&gt;damage spell is disease cloud (5pts whoppy!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was in fire storm yesterday for about 4 hours and felt like a big anchor.<br/>
&gt;My group was getting hit by elemental and all I could do their was just be <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;hp sponge by trying to taunt while the magic classes attacked it.  Oh, and <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;was level 14, the highest in the group.  But thinking about it now fighters<br/>
&gt;would also be sitting on the side lines in this area.  I know a 12 lvl <br/>
&gt;magic<br/>
&gt;user who used root in this area and pushed himself up to like level 15 or <br/>
&gt;16<br/>
&gt;in a week or two (I will admit he was on for a very long time), he is now<br/>
&gt;like level 25.  Just kind of disappointing, not that I am going to give it<br/>
&gt;up, because people tell me that it gets better around level 22, but I agree<br/>
&gt;with the post that we should get the invisibility spell at 22, plus a<br/>
&gt;serious DoT spell just for making it to that level.  Anyway maybe we should<br/>
&gt;get a shadow knight only spell of some kind, make 1 or 2  for each spell<br/>
&gt;levels and make it a quest of some kind.  Maybe a Direct Damage spell like<br/>
&gt;harm touch is, but it just uses mana (but not the same damage amount),  or <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;radius damage spell (thought those were cool looking), or how about a <br/>
&gt;radius<br/>
&gt;life tap that give us hp back from all creatures around us ... just watch<br/>
&gt;out for your party!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also just wanted to ask, has anyone completed the quest for Sir Lindel<br/>
&gt;(something of the effect)  I found him last night, attacked him, he ran<br/>
&gt;away, I started to follow then he vanished, I had no lag, and nothing <br/>
&gt;killed<br/>
&gt;him because he was still my target.  So, I waited for him to return.  He<br/>
&gt;came back full hit points, I attacked him again, he ran again, then I<br/>
&gt;started to follow him and then vanished again,  no lag, still targeted so<br/>
&gt;nothing had killed him.  Again he comes back, I get hit by an elemental <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt;behind, moved so elemental wasn&#39;t hitting me from behind, elemental and him<br/>
&gt;start attacking each other ... elemental kills him... grrr.  I don&#39;t under<br/>
&gt;stand why he vanished but now I have engulfing darkness, which I will use,<br/>
&gt;but just wondered what you will get when completing the quest... magic<br/>
&gt;weapon (I hope)? or just more faction bonus.  Also does anyone know where <br/>
&gt;he<br/>
&gt;spawns at or is it just random?<br/>
