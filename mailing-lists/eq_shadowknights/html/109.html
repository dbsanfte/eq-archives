<div id="ygrps-yiv-201966676">well,<br/>
     I can only speak for why i play the shadow knight and how I believe the <br/>
shadow knight should be played.  To me the SK is a dastardly devil, cruel, <br/>
ruthless, and a true threat in battle.  But at higher levels he is weaker <br/>
hand to hand than the warrior, as he should, and at all levels he is an <br/>
(aguable) match to the paladin. I haven&#39;t met one that I haven&#39;t killed, if <br/>
killing the charecter was my intention.<br/>
     The SK was never ment to go toe to toe with the light warrior, he was <br/>
ment to bide his time and strike when the paladin (or any one else) is the <br/>
weakest, in battle with another foe, or with the SKs pet and shout <br/>
&quot;Muhaaahahahahaa!!!&quot;  as the other player cries &quot;Why?  Why? I like Dark <br/>
Elves! Aiieeeee...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
ahem<br/>
<br/>
    So, the bottom line is theatrics and role play.  One can play the <br/>
dastardly fiend, or one cannot.  It is that simple.  If you seek a persona <br/>
for PK or staight war gaming, play a wizard or warrior.  Two dimmentions are <br/>
for you.  If you see your charecter as the Scourge of Freeport or The <br/>
Warlord of Neriak , a charecter loved by friends and LOATHED by all others, <br/>
the SK is for you.<br/>
    The key is Role Play not PK.  You will find that other players will not <br/>
feel so bad WHEN they die if they faced XILLITH, Lady of Pain and Dark <br/>
Destroyer.  I even made some interracial friends by PKing them with an Erol <br/>
Flynn air  &gt;:)   (even paladins...heh heh)  They come back for more and <br/>
challenge you to elaborate duels and grand wars.  I rescued one Paladin from <br/>
a kodiak only to let him die by my  hand because &quot;Only Innorruk deserves <br/>
they glory of this kill !!&quot; and he loved it!!<br/>
    On a side note, only being looted by the one who kills you is nice.  I <br/>
despise looters.  If Xillith kills and loots your charecter expect an offer <br/>
for fair trade immediately, unless you are rude.  As the Bard Leatherwolfe <br/>
on Rallos Zek.  I killed her, with a buddy, and took her kite shield, (heh <br/>
heh) a kite shield is quite the setback so i ofered to return it for trade.  <br/>
I recieved a Mino axe for the shield and a tarnished spear, and gained a <br/>
friend to hunt in Lavastorm.  YEP, we hunted together.  Why not right?  <br/>
Innorruk was sated.<br/>
<br/>
    So role play and love this class, it is the best.<br/>
