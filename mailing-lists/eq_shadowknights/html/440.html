<div id="ygrps-yiv-945366340">BTW, the Pestilence Scythe is a magic, lore, no drop item found on Lord Grimrot, who stands in the ruins immediately south of the white bridge in South Karana. He&#39;s a level 35 SK that is a lot tougher than he seems, and if you kill him OR any of the putrid skeletons guarding him your factions drop with the Bloodsabers and go up with Qeynos guards, etc. The Bloodsabers are the human SK guild in Qeynos who worship Bertoxxulous.<br/>
Stats on the scythe are as follows. 16 dmg, 48 dlay, +10 poison and disease save, and has one charge for Vampiric Curse. I wasn&#39;t able to see the exact effects of this spell, so I&#39;m fairly anxious to figure out how to recharge it. If it can be recharged, that is. It can be used by warriors, SK&#39;s, and necromancers (although I think it should be SK and necro only!) I got this scythe for the look of my character, and for the storyline we have. Sure there&#39;s better weapons.. but until there&#39;s a better scythe this is what I&#39;ll be using. =)<br/>
