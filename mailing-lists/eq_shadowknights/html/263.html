<b>Subject:</b> Where should I hunt at lvl 16 to get some armor and a decent 2hd  magic weapon? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791721946">I have a basic set of banded and I am at lvl 16. I really need a magic<br/>
weapon but do not have any money left after purchasing the banded armor. I<br/>
really need a weapon more than anything right now since I have basic armor.<br/>
I play on Tarrew Marr , not that that really matters. I am currently bound<br/>
to Qeynos. If someone wants to they could hunt with me tonight and show me<br/>
all the wonderful loot I have been missing. :-)</div>
