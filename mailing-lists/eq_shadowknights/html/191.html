<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-608392355">well....everyone has their own opinion on such matters...<br/>
<br/>
my own reason is, if you dont think you can spend the time you earn the<br/>
experience and items yourself, what fun is it? I take great pleasure in<br/>
earning things the hard way, thats the way I feel. But if someone doesnt<br/>
want take the time, thats up to him/her...really, if you got a lvl 50 char<br/>
with every rare item there is, what can you do? everything is done, except<br/>
exploring the world, and from what I have explored so far, town to town to<br/>
dungeon to wild life, it isnt that big just yet...I say yet, because Verant<br/>
can always add new zones and continents. and once that is done, what is<br/>
there to do? run around and brag? who knows...the fun in the game, IMHO, is<br/>
taking the time to play the game out, from the very beginning. To unveil<br/>
plots and quests piece by piece.<br/>
<br/>
but, this is only my opinion, everyone will differ...<br/>

Why do you feel it&#39;s wrong to sell acounts? A lot of people don&#39;t want to<br/>
waste the time getting a character up to a level where you can actually do<br/>
something. Also Verant is changing there license so it will be technically<br/>
legal to do.</div>
