<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640425756">Hello all. I occasionally take a break from my magi to play a sk on Xegony.<br/>
I was wondering what would be a nice 2H magic weapon to quest for, for a<br/>
first magic weapon. I&#39;m not asking for any real spoilers, perhaps someone<br/>
could point me in the right direction ?<br/>
<br/>
My troll is level 8 at the moment and had saved enough plat to by a regular<br/>
steel halberd at 36p. I&#39;ve been told a few time that was monumentously<br/>
stupid, but heh what can I say, troll&#39;s ain&#39;t rose that far out of the<br/>
swamp ) Anyway, having only played a magi I&#39;m not used to dealing with<br/>
weapons and such, so what would be nice to have ? what are some price ranges<br/>
to save for, etc ? Any help/thoughts on the subject would be cool, and my<br/>
thanks to you.<br/>
<br/>
