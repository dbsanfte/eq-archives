<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581026841">I didn&#39;t touch my Intelligence and couldn&#39;t cast my pet until level 11 and <br/>
you know what, SO WHAT!  Not to mention our pets bite and usually get us <br/>
into trouble.  I have only cast my pet 4 times and I&#39;m past level 15.  We <br/>
are 3/4 warrior and 1/4 Necro.  We&#39;re not supposed to be good at it.  Until <br/>
you get to level 22 the best spells that I have been ussing are Invis to <br/>
Undead, Clinging Darkness(oh so great for fast creatures that tend to run <br/>
when hp is low), Fear isn&#39;t too bad but I rarely use it, Shadow Step si <br/>
great for fleeing, and Locate Corpse for yourself or for anyone you want to <br/>
help out.  Just keep in mine that your pet is usually half your level and is <br/>
usually a speed bump to the creature you fight.  Just some of my thoughts.<br/>
