<div id="ygrps-yiv-406754052"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Checked this out. You mean the group of three....one sells blacksmithing <br/>
&gt;molds, one sells nothing and the other sells fletching materials but only <br/>
&gt;1/4 of what you need to make an arrow? <br/>
&gt;The way I see it, SK can never become fletchers without making mule <br/>
&gt;characters. Which it seems will be the way I will do it I guess. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Evil races cannot fletch without help, and yes, it sucks.  I dumped 20 points into fletching without realizing that I couldn&#39;t do it without help.  You can make bow by buying from the merchant in Feerrott, but it is expensive, and event at a 20 skill, your success rate is awful.  Plus there is less of a market for bows than arrows and you can&#39;t really do bows in massive quantities.  Luckily, I&#39;m part of a guild, and I&#39;m having them fetch the required components for me, backpacks full of them.  Your best bet is to make friends that can do it for you, or be a human SK in Qeynos.<br/>
