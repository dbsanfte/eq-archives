<div id="ygrps-yiv-955794153">Hmm, it very well could be.  But I am inclined to believe that he just saw a <br/>
dark reaver and mistook it for something else... I dunno.  If it does exist <br/>
that would be very cool... but it might just be another rumor.  I have heard <br/>
of several other swords with names like sould flayer and other names with <br/>
about the same wording.  I would like to hear more about how this developes <br/>
however.<br/>

&gt;Today, I was talking to an old friend of mine. He said that he saw someone<br/>
&gt;with a sword called a Soul Reaver. It is believed that the Soul Reaver has<br/>
&gt;the stats of 20/32. It is also claimed to look similar to the Fiery <br/>
&gt;Avenger,<br/>
&gt;except that there is a mist surrounding the blade. Does anyone have any <br/>
&gt;info<br/>
&gt;on it? All of a sudden, my Dark Reaver seems to be swinger slower today . .<br/>
&gt;. hehe<br/>
