<div id="ygrps-yiv-781147607">Ok guys heres some info you might want. The Dark Reaver is found in Lower <br/>
Guk, be lvl 30+ to start going there..Also there are weapons not yet <br/>
implemented in the game...eventually sk&#39;s will get a weapon known as Soul <br/>
Flayer...name might be changed AGAIN. In early beta the Dark Reaver was MUCH <br/>
MUCH MUCH MUCH better than it is now...now it kinda sucks...you used to be <br/>
able to stay alive just on it&#39;s lifetap abilities which are now just a 20 str <br/>
spell...might give you guys more info later...<br/>
