<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051474939">Before I continue any further, let me say that I do not believe the SK is<br/>
overly weak. Being a hybrid with downtime equaling a Warrior, obviously,<br/>
seem unfair. But other than the downtime and the useless, class-specific<br/>
skill (HT), I believe that the SK is one of the most interesting class to<br/>
play. In fact, I would go on to say that we can do the most damage out of<br/>
all melee classes in a fight with an NPC (Double Attack + Pet + DoT = mega<br/>
damage). I also believe that it is not too overly important to travel before<br/>
level 30. For many levels, I have never needed to travel anywhere that would<br/>
kill me on sight. There are always places to fight up to level 30; at which<br/>
point, we do actually get Gather Shadows. Now, I will address Mr. Stovall&#39;s<br/>
post:<br/>
<br/>
Scenario 1:<br/>
What is the first DoT that the Shadow Knight would use? Engulfing Darkness.<br/>
What is the first spell the Paladin would use? Flash of Light. Now, let&#39;s<br/>
assume they both go off. No resists, no fizzles, no interruption. The SK is<br/>
blinded, the Paladin is free to kill the pet. Once the pet is gone, Paladin<br/>
blinds the Shadow Knight again, repeat until SK is dead.<br/>
<br/>
Scenario 2:<br/>
Let&#39;s assume that Engulfing Darkness is casted upon the Paladin. The Paladin<br/>
would just fight the SK and the pet. The pet&#39;s attack = Center + Spirit<br/>
Armor. So, it is basically down to LH versus HT + DoT. And as we all know,<br/>
HT and a 100HP DoT does not compensate for LH.<br/>
<br/>
Scenario 3:<br/>
Let&#39;s consider what you said in your scenario. The pet is gone and Paladin<br/>
has taken more damage. Is the Shadow Knight able to get the Paladin down to<br/>
the point where the HT will defeat the Paladin? No. It might have took 5<br/>
rounds at most to finish off the pet; thus, the Paladin is far from being<br/>
dead (during that time, the Paladin might have lost 200HP at most -<br/>
considering that all the arrows hit and DoT). Once the pet is gone, the<br/>
battle turns over. All the Paladin needs to do is to Blind, Root and Heal.<br/>
That was excluding Center and Spirit Armor.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I do not see why the Paladin would go for the SK when he/she<br/>
knows that the pet is the main disrupter of spells. In addition, you failed<br/>
to consider that a Paladin can also have a bow. With the combination Blind,<br/>
Root, shoot and Heal, the Paladin is always one step ahead of the Shadow<br/>
Knight in fights. Basically, the reason why a Paladin will defeat a SK is<br/>
because of a few simply spells.<br/>
<br/>
As for winning unrigged fights with red-cons, I really find that hard to<br/>
believe. Red-cons would resisted Darkness, Fear and Harm Touch. The Harm<br/>
Touch will not compensate for their LH at that point. Furthermore, at higher<br/>
levels, they are able to hit more often with higher damage; while taking<br/>
less hits. I can see a Shadow Knight defeating red-con Warriors and Monks.<br/>
However, looking at all the above factors makes me disbelieve that a Paladin<br/>
can lose to a blue-formidable-con Shadow Knight at best. Perhaps you have a<br/>
strategy that I do not see? Or perhaps the Paladin was on the way to<br/>
retrieve his/her corpse?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I disagree.  I&#39;m on Rallos Zek, PvP.  What an SK does while rooted is fire<br/>
&gt;his bow, send his pet, and stack his DoTs.  Fletching is a very, very<br/>
&gt;important ability that usually gets overlooked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In the same scenario the SK have a 30+ damage bow.  He gets rooted, starts<br/>
&gt;firing arrows.  The pet gets up in the paladin&#39;s face - good for<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The paladin has 2 choices.  Deal with the SK or deal with the pet.  If he<br/>
&gt;deals with the pet, obviously the SK will tear the crap out of him.  So<br/>
&gt;he&#39;ll attack the SK.  While he&#39;s trying to blind, he gets hit with an<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;bashed by a pet, etc which has a good chance of spell disruption, and gets<br/>

&gt;while your blinded.  By the time the root&#39;s over, the paladin notices he<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;These kinds of things won&#39;t work you say?  I&#39;ve never lost a fight with a<br/>
&gt;paladin, even yellow and red ones. </span></blockquote></div>
