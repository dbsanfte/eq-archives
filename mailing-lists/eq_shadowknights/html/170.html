<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059849621">Ok, way back I knew there was a big stink because it seemed no evil race<br/>
could fletch. I was wondering if by any chance this has been changed? I am<br/>
making a DE SK and I REALLY want to take up archery with him. Archery for me<br/>
is one of the main reasons I am choosing SK&#39;s. Can someone please please<br/>
please please tell me that verant fixed this oversight and there is now a<br/>
place to buy fletching materials? I logged on and checked that one place in<br/>
neriak and that place is a joke; it only sells nocks.<br/>
<br/>
So is it possible  to buy materials not in Kelethin or surefall? Does maybe<br/>
Grobb or Oggok have the rest pf the materials? And if it isnt possible maybe<br/>
all SK&#39;s should feedback this as it essentially makes one of our skills<br/>
useless.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</div>
