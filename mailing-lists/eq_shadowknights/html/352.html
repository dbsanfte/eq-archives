<br/>
Also consider Clinging Darkness and Fear on those Crocs.  Your will take <br/>
alot less dammage as you walk behind them with &#39;ol Geneker hacking them to <br/>
bits.<br/>
<br/>
NOW, cast that in Guk or Slousek and see how quick your pet goes splat.  It <br/>
would be the lowset member of your group and get mobbed immediately...gone.  <br/>
You should have given the bone chips to the necro.<br/>
<br/>
ALSO, John Doe the Paladin wants to duel!  Cast the pet?  NOPE, it could <br/>
care less what happens to you.  Playing on Rallos Zek?  Keep those chips in <br/>
your pocket because it will NOT EVER defend you from attack.<br/>

&gt;I hear everyone complain about how week the pets are, and it&#39;s true,<br/>
&gt;they are, but weak is not necessarily ineffective.  I currently<br/>
&gt;have the 15th level pet spell, and I generally always have one when<br/>
&gt;I solo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Last night I had a pet (different castings are different you know) that<br/>
&gt;had double attack, and with a scimitar was swinging for up to 14 points,<br/>
&gt;and bashing as well.  Since I use a 2 hander, I can&#39;t bash the gnoll<br/>
&gt;soothsayers out of their spells, but my pet managed to do it at least<br/>
&gt;once every fight.  By the end of the fight, my pet would have done<br/>
&gt;at least 100 points of damage.  That&#39;s not too bad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Pet tip #1 (Pet placement)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Set your pet out of the way, and pull to your pet like you would to<br/>
&gt;a group.  I pull with Clinging darkness and then I can get another<br/>
&gt;spell or two off before the monsters get there.  Always keep your<br/>
&gt;pet away from spawn points, because the greens it&#39;ll pull just aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;worth it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Pet tip #2 (Pseudo-tank)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This tip worked well for me from about 15-17 fighting caimans and<br/>
&gt;crocodiles in Oasis.  It also works better with a high delay, high<br/>
&gt;damage weapon.  Set your pet out of the way, and pull a monster<br/>
&gt;over to you.  Cast the spells in this order: Clinging darkness (to<br/>
&gt;pull), siphon strength, disease cloud.  Also, be sure to have mend<br/>
&gt;bones memorized.  Then, you take a swing, and back up, turning off<br/>
&gt;auto-attack.  The monster will turn on the pet, and hit him a time<br/>
&gt;or two until you get your attack back.  Then you step forward, attack,<br/>
&gt;and step back.  Use /pet report health to monitor old Kabartik.<br/>
&gt;When he gets to 50% I usually throw in a mend bones, and then its<br/>
&gt;just about time to recast darkness as well.  Then I step in and<br/>
&gt;finish in melee.  When I was fighting blues with this technique,<br/>
&gt;the only downtime I had was meditating, in one case I took 22 points<br/>
&gt;of damage during the fight, and healed that while medding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Our pets are weak.  But it would be really unbalancing if they were<br/>
&gt;much more powerful.  Keep them out of trouble and use them as a<br/>
&gt;DOT.  I just turned 20, so I might be ignorant of the higher<br/>
&gt;level woes, but they work well in non-dungeons up to 20 if you<br/>
&gt;use them right.<br/>
