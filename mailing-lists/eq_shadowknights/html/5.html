<div id="ygrps-yiv-275118098">I have played Shadow Knight in beta, as an ogre back then, and now I am a<br/>
human Shadow Knight. What I like about this class, to some it may seem<br/>
weak, but what it symbolizes is its strength. It is a warrior of death, a<br/>
fighter with some abilities of necromancey. Some people think though that<br/>
the spells come too late in their level, since a true necromancer gets them<br/>
much sooner, but these spells that we get can be used to an advantage to<br/>
our level as well.<br/>
<br/>
First off, let me say, and this doesnt go for only warriors, but just about<br/>
all fighting classes. Learn as many weapon skills as possible. You dont<br/>
need to learn them all at once, take your time to max out one then learn<br/>
another. I first started out with 2H slash thinking, since we don&#39;t get<br/>
dual wield, that this is all that we need. well, us SKs do get bash, and a<br/>
shield is needed as well, hence when you will need to use 1H, preferably<br/>
slash. At lvl 11 is when I begun to learn 1H slash, with my human SK, and<br/>
maxxed it out at lvl 13. And now that both 2H and 1H slash are maxed, I<br/>
have begun to learn peircing. Everytime you go up a level, again max out<br/>
your common weapon skills, then begin to learn more on the skills you know<br/>
less of after those skills your good at are maxed. Although 2H slash<br/>
weapons do more damage, I believe that 1H slash are the first of the two to<br/>
be able to get affordable magic weapons later on. Although I am not high<br/>
enough to know this firsthand, this has what I been told. The thing is,<br/>
keep possibilities open,  by learning as much as you can. Ogres and Trolls<br/>
wont be able to learn all the weapon skills as soon as humans and DEs can,<br/>
but with effort I am sure it can be accomplished.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, the pet. It is about half the level you are when you get it,<br/>
everytime you get a new pet it is roughly half level to what you currently<br/>
are. The trick is, the pet is actually usefull, but it is NOT the tank, you<br/>
are the tank (this is assuming your soloing, although unlesss your troll, I<br/>
highly recommend NOT to solo, unless you are very patient and dont mind<br/>
waiting many minutes for healing.<br/>
<br/>
the spells you get at the level you are are useful to a fighter. remember<br/>
your a fighter farmost, then a spellcaster, dont try to rely on<br/>
spellcasting. siphon strength, it allows you to carry more in weight, and<br/>
your attack value goes up, while it decreases the attack value of the<br/>
opponent you casted it on. Disease Cloud...this is a disease spell, I<br/>
tested it on another player and it ept him diseased for quite some time,<br/>
although it may vary, I am not sure on this, I only tested it on one<br/>
person. of coarse search for undead type spell is useful as well, dont<br/>
think so? some areas it is quite useful for a good strategy for luring,<br/>
such as in Najena, to lure as many undead as possible before the ogre guard<br/>
comes out. find corpse of course is useful as well, many people ask for<br/>
necros to help find corpses, at level 9 you can help too. perhaps this can<br/>
help with profits, or help yourself in finding your own body if your not<br/>
sure where its at. <br/>
<br/>
level 15 spells: clinging darkness, altho you may not think it does much,<br/>
it does quite abit. it slows your opponent just a little...I also recommend<br/>
casting it on a fleeing opponent, sometimes I have practically stopped my<br/>
opponent as if I had casted root, yet it was clinging darkness. it does do<br/>
damage too, the little it does. not sure how much, but every little bit<br/>
helps. shadowstep i havent found that useful, its basically random,<br/>
soemtimes it takes you only one step ahead of where you were (completely<br/>
useless) or it can make you travel around a corner that was about 4-5<br/>
seconds ahead of you (somewhat useful but not totally), I am not sure if<br/>
this spell will help you retreat all that well, it is totally random.<br/>
<br/>
well, this is how far I have gotten so far in my quest as a servant to the<br/>
father of the Teir&#39;Dal. only a bubble away from 16, maybe some others can<br/>
give insight later on, or perhaps I shall once I experience more.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, some of the stuff on eqvault is wrong, for the SK guide...for example,<br/>
the infamouse Harm Touch (HT), it IS counted as a spell, for it CAN be<br/>
resisted. the max damage I have seen is 10 times your current level plus 1<br/>
or 2 (ie, if your level 15, ive seen 151 or 152 damage at times). Although<br/>
this is a good ability, don&#39;t rely on it, sometimes it does down to half or<br/>
a quarter of the damage that it should be doing at your level. Does Lay<br/>
Hands get resisted? nope, why would you resist it anyways? and its a full<br/>
heal...this is one big advantage that Paladins have over us SKs. and pets<br/>
CANNOT be used in duels, so we cant be saying if we fought a Paladin, that<br/>
we have our pet for an advantage. It is a great ability, but it can also<br/>
mean death for when we think it will save our arse out of a tough situation<br/>
when we rely on it, so DONT rely on it.<br/>
<br/>
hope this has helped anyone interested in SKs and you newbies, I still<br/>
consider myself as a newbie since I am only a measly level 15 =)<br/>
