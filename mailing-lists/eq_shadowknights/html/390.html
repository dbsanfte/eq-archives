&gt; People tried to auction it off, but found out that it is a No-Trade item.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;How was it auctioned off if it is a No-Trade item?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok, fair enough.  I&#39;m assuming that it&#39;s location remains secret, and<br/>
that I won&#39;t have to worry about it for about 20 more levels =) (I&#39;m<br/>
almost 22 now)  Did they mention what zone it is in?<br/>
<br/>
Still though, a fine blade, and everyone needs a long term quest<br/>
(holy grail).  One thing I&#39;d like to see is a blade that has an<br/>
aura of darkness around it, in opposition to light generating items,<br/>
but most likely that would be very difficult to code, and the few<br/>
human SK&#39;s might get upset, but then again they&#39;d have deadeye by<br/>
the time they got it most likely.<br/>
