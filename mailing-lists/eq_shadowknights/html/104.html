<div id="ygrps-yiv-1027426739">The stats are pretty good. it is a powerful weapon, which also has magic <br/>
attacks such as disease spell and siphon strength apparently... the problem <br/>
is, Lord Grimrot is level 28ish when naked and sometimes with but normaslly <br/>
without the scythe, but when he&#39;s fully kitted up in his armor, he&#39;s level <br/>
32ish. One thing tho, he is a skelie so various harm undead spells would work <br/>
well against him. As an SK i was able to get up close and talk to him, and he <br/>
tried to tempt me into trying to kill him that i might win the weapon hehe.</div>
