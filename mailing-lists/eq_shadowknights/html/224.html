<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094905835">I was a level 21 Necromancer at the time and I only had something like 340 health which is rather low. I managed to run into a spectre in Ferrot but one thing I have noticed is that they move extremly slow and there spells don&#39;t do much damage it&#39;s those scyth&#39;s that hurt you. Anyway I continued running half-way across Ferrot to CazicThule and only lossed 1 1/2 bubbles of life.</div>
