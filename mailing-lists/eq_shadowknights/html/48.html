<div id="ygrps-yiv-983282083">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that this survey will really be useful.  I mean its pretty<br/>
obvious us SKs will want more powerful spells so we can crush the other puny<br/>
classes like the bugs they are ; )   ...who among us would oppose this?<br/>
<br/>
If we want things to change, the important issue to raise is WHY we need<br/>
more powerful spells and abilities.<br/>
<br/>
For example, there has been some discussion about the matching of lay hands<br/>
vs. harm touch.  Personally I see the balace as being pretty good.  First of<br/>
all, we have the advantage of pets to help us... Paladins don&#39;t have them<br/>
and all that extra damage they do adds up.  Secondly, I feel that being able<br/>
to do 700 damage in one shot without a saving throw would probably have some<br/>
serious game balance implications.  Sure it might be a little fairer for<br/>
dueling, but you could take out some very tough creatures with that ability<br/>
that you wouldn&#39;t have been able to before.... this translates into much<br/>
easier xp for us and ultimately more SKs that reach higher levels faster.<br/>
The result of this is an imbalance between the classes.  I think that this<br/>
is the reason why Harm Touch has been somewhat penalized.  Is there anything<br/>
about this you guys think I&#39;m missing?<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to say that I think the abilities we get are pretty good.<br/>
I participated in beta so I had an opportunity to play some other classes<br/>
like warrior and shaman.  They each have things that are cool about them and<br/>
things that suck.  Warriors can take down tougher monsters for their level<br/>
but you end up sitting around for a half hour healing after each fight if<br/>
you don&#39;t have a healer.  Shamans can heal but they are pretty weak compared<br/>
to the warrior.  These tradeoffs are what make the game interesting.... for<br/>
each class you get to exploit some cool things about it but you have to cope<br/>
with the not so cool things.  ShadowKnights have similar advantages and<br/>
disadvantages, but all in all they are pretty fun to play.  It all depends<br/>
on how you want to play the game or the style of playing that you have the<br/>
most fun with.  I think this is the way it should be.<br/>
<br/>
So, in summary of my ramble, I think that Verant put a lot of time and<br/>
thought into balancing the classes in the game so that they would be fun to<br/>
play.  If we want to change them, we had better come up with some good,<br/>
concrete reasons that make sense.  We can&#39;t just go to them and say &quot;This<br/>
sucks, change it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Just my $0.02...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is a new survey for the eq_shadowknights community.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you think Shadow Knights spells should be changed to make them<br/>
stronger, or to add more spells?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ----<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Possible answers are:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; o Yes, I think they should add more spells.<br/>
&gt; o They should just make the current ones stronger.<br/>
&gt; o Dont care<br/>
&gt; o Leave them as is<br/>
&gt; o Should make them less powerful<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
