&gt; I can pretty much guarantee that the Soul Reaver is real. I&#39;ve seen it being<br/>
&gt; auctioned off before, but I never knew it was a better version of the Dark<br/>
&gt; Reaver (who would of thought that there is a better sword than the Dark<br/>
&gt; Reaver?). But only one SK is seen with it because it is a No-Trade item.<br/>
