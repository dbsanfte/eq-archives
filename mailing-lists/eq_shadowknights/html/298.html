<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010205841">After Xillith posted the weakness of the Shadow Knights, I would like to<br/>
address the imbalances of the Shadow Knight class again. Hoping to see a<br/>
change in this class in every patch, I do not see any upgrade anytime soon.<br/>
A long time ago, I remember having a debate with someone about Shadow<br/>
Knights and how they are weak compared to a Paladin. However, they truly<br/>
believe that the SK are balanced - which is not true. First of all, many<br/>
other classes, who do not know the SK&#39;s spells, believe that the SK spell<br/>
list consist of Lifetap, but that is simply not true. &#39;You got Vampiric<br/>
Embrace&#39; they would retort, but is that a valid point? The answer is &#39;no&#39;.<br/>
The reason is that VE is an unreliable source of Lifetap. It only goes off<br/>
periodically (about once every 15 attacks). In addition, it only drains 12HP<br/>
+ (2/2 levels beyond 22). And thus, giving a BIG 20HP drain at level 30<br/>
every 30 seconds or so. Now, with that aside, I would like to compare the<br/>
Paladin and the Shadow Knight in a fight. Consider the following:<br/>
<br/>
30th level Shadow Knight<br/>
- 301 HT<br/>
- Engulfing Darkness, Heat Blood, Shadow Step, Siphon Strength, Fear<br/>
- Full plate with BBC<br/>
- 755HP<br/>
- ~650AC<br/>
- Pet casted<br/>
<br/>
30th level Paladin<br/>
- LH<br/>
- Stun, Root, Healing<br/>
- Center and Spirit Armor on<br/>
- Full plate with BBC<br/>
- 755+HP<br/>
- ~650+AC<br/>
<br/>
As we can see, Paladins will have an HP and AC advantage already. In<br/>
addition, they get Root and Blind, which they can use strategically to heal<br/>
themselves during the battle. They can also use the Root/Blind tactic to get<br/>
free hits or to finish the pet in a few attacks. So, what can a SK do while<br/>
they are blinded? Nothing. How can a SK hit the Paladin when rooted? The SK<br/>
cannot. So, let&#39;s ASSUME the SK can get the Paladin down to half health -<br/>
Will the Paladin need to use LH? The answer is NO, because the HT does not<br/>
even compensate for half their HP.<br/>
<br/>
Many of you know that Engulfing Darkness and Fear gets resisted more than<br/>
30% at even fights, higher on yellows and 90% resisted on reds. Now, with<br/>
the resistable HT, SKs are basically left being a Warrior with faction and<br/>
exp penalty. While a Paladin can assure safety with LH, HT is completely<br/>
unreliable and useless. Remember back at level 1, HT used to finish a rat<br/>
easily? At level 30 or so, 301 damage DOES NOT even put a dent in their HP<br/>
bar. Note, however, that the damage/level ratio of the HT gets worse and<br/>
worse.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I believe that Paladins SHOULD be able to defeat a SK in a fight<br/>
simply because they are there to rid the world of SKs. But having a weak and<br/>
resistable HT, the inability to heal, exp penalty AND bad factions, I<br/>
believe that Verant should at least give the SK the Lifetap series and a<br/>
better HT.</div>
