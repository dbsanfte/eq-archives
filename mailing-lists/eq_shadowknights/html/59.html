<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-436683574">I have played through many classes and have found the SK to be relatively<br/>
weak in comparison to every other class. First of all, it is the HT. Some<br/>
argued that it would completely imbalance the game if it does not have a<br/>
saving throw; this is NOT TRUE. Think of it this way:<br/>
<br/>
Paladin (level 20) - 500HP<br/>
Shadow Knight (level 20) - 500HP<br/>
<br/>
Now, the Shadow Knight&#39;s HT does 201 damage - not even half of the Paladin&#39;s<br/>
life. This is a once a day ability that can either be resisted or partially<br/>
resisted. On the other hand, the Paladin can Lay Hands anytime to recover<br/>
all 500HP. Perhaps I&#39;m missing something or there is some form of<br/>
mathematical derivation to this, but from what I see, 201 /= 500.<br/>
<br/>
Then one would argue that we have pets, but I can also say that the Paladins<br/>
get buffs and heals. What are Shadow Knights reduced to? A 5 point damage<br/>
Diease Cloud and a strength stealing spell that has no noticable effect<br/>
(other than allowing one to carry 10 more weigh units?). We have to sit for<br/>
over 20 minutes after each fight to recover. On level 15, our spell is still<br/>
inferior to the Paladins. What other hybrids have to sit so long? Paladins<br/>
and Rangers can heal themselves right up. In addition, we get KOS and have<br/>
less places to travel to to get experience. Although, it is stated that<br/>
playing a SK would be of high difficulty, but as mentioned above, we should<br/>
get invisibility at some point.<br/>
<br/>
In conclusion, we are simply a warrior with a experience penalty. Sure, we<br/>
got HT and all the pets in the world. But does that add up to the kicks,<br/>
dual wield and double attack damage (oh, don&#39;t forget that berserker&#39;s rage)<br/>
that the warrior does? The answer is obvious - NO. If we get the Lifetap<br/>
series and a 100% functioning HT, then this class might be comparible to the<br/>
other classes. Until then, I will stick with my SK class just because I look<br/>
cool as a warrior (with a experience penalty) with a pet.</div>
