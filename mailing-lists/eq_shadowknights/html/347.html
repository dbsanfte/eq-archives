&gt; I discovered the joys of the dungeon of Permafrost last night.  It is appropriate for parties of adventurers level 15 and above and is not crowded.  (15 was maximum there last night).  But guards in Halas and Everfrost will KoS me, and the nearest merchant that I know of that will sell to me is in Qeynos Hills.  Does anyone know if there is a merchant in Everfrost that will sell to evils?  Me a TSK.<br/>

Any info on getting into the ice realm safely would be appreciated.<br/>
