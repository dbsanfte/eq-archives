<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047084460">Well, from what I&#39;ve seen before, Verant thinks all the classes are<br/>
balanced. That is, until a couple hundred players complain about their<br/>
class. Given that not many play a Shadow Knight, one can clearly see that<br/>
there is no incentive for Verant to change this class. Nevertheless, I<br/>
believe that a few things should change in order to bring balance to the<br/>
Shadow Knight class:<br/>
<br/>
- Paladin&#39;s Lay Hands become ((level x 10) + 1) - just like the HT<br/>
- Lay Hands will sometimes heal the enemy - to compensate the resistability<br/>
of HT<br/>
- Paladin&#39;s Healing series become the Summon Water series - to compensate<br/>
for the SK&#39;s lack of healing spells<br/>
- Paladins, however, get Minor Healing at level 30 - to balance out the<br/>
randomness and &#39;usefulness&#39; of Vampiric Embrace<br/>
<br/>
Now, the above will bring balance between the Paladin and the Shadow Knight.<br/>
I won&#39;t even go into why Shamans, Druids and Necros (with Jboots) are too<br/>
powerful. I&#39;ve seen the same level Shaman and Druid soloing Cyclops when I<br/>
can hardly put a dent in them. Even with Pet, HT, going oom and the a good<br/>
weapon, I can hardly take off 50% of it&#39;s life before having to zone. Now<br/>
that Verant is increasing the speed of DoT, it makes Shamans and Necros<br/>
leaps ahead of Shadow Knights. But I&#39;m used to that - all I want is to bring<br/>
balance between the SK and the Paladin.<br/>
<br/>
Note - I believe I posted the wrong info about the Vampiric Embrace the<br/>
other day. It is not (12 + (2/2 levels beyond 22)); rather, I found out that<br/>
it is something much less. Does anyone have the correct formula for the VM?</div>
