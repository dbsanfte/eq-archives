<div id="ygrps-yiv-517554059">Well,<br/>
<br/>
This is a matter that I dont feel should happen. If you buy the game, play <br/>
the game for what its worth. Thats why it is an RPG. So you can build up as <br/>
you go. Not start out at the top.<br/>
<br/>
But hey, if some guy wants to waste his money ruining his gaming experience. <br/>
Thats up to him.<br/>
