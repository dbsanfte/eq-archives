&gt; <br/>
&gt; Today, I was talking to an old friend of mine. He said that he saw someone<br/>
&gt; with a sword called a Soul Reaver. It is believed that the Soul Reaver has<br/>
&gt; the stats of 20/32. It is also claimed to look similar to the Fiery Avenger,<br/>
&gt; except that there is a mist surrounding the blade. Does anyone have any info<br/>
&gt; on it? All of a sudden, my Dark Reaver seems to be swinger slower today . .<br/>
&gt; . hehe<br/>
&gt; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow!  Does it have an effect on it as well?  Hopefully something other<br/>
than steal strength.  A nice lifetap would rock.<br/>
