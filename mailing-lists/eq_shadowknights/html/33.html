<div id="ygrps-yiv-124016678">I love playing my SK, and have had no desire to play any other race. But, I do<br/>
agree that we really got the short end of the stick when it comes to spells. If<br/>
Harm Touch could not be resisted I would not mind the other shortcomings. But as<br/>
Jorval stated, traveling is a real pain. I have gotten killed by more Innkeepers<br/>
than any other type of NPC in the game. In fact, the last 3 times I have died (the<br/>
only 3 this week) it was by an Innkeeper who must have saw me through a wall and<br/>
proceeded to open a can of whoop ass on me. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I expected<br/>
the SK character to be a hard one, and the reward of actually achieving a high<br/>
level will be a greater accomplishment to me than playing any other race, but for<br/>
God&#39;s sake, at least give us some type of invisible spell. Anyway I am rambling.<br/>
Besides that, the SK has been fun to play, even with its shortcomings ( I&#39;m always<br/>
breaking the monotony for my group by the occasional Zone Run from an<br/>
Innkeeper...they get a good laugh out of it.) I just wish they would just give us<br/>
at least 1 useful spell like invis and make the Harm Touch a no save spell.<br/>
<br/>
Jorval,  I play on CZ also...I think I helped you kill Lady Shae a couple times,<br/>
but not sure. I&#39;ve moved to Qeynos, so if you ever in the area, give me a tell.<br/>

&gt; I think harm touch and lay on hands are pretty damn unbalanced myself. I been<br/>
&gt; harm touch in theory is friggin, great, especially at lower levels. But as<br/>
&gt; people get higher levels say level 30, to times 30 giving a 300hp harmtouch<br/>
&gt; is in now way going to be as worthwhile as lay on hands giving a level 30<br/>
&gt; Paladin their 700-800 odd hp back! What&#39;s more, harmtouch CAN be resisted<br/>
&gt; either totaly or partialy. Also on the EQlizer site, it says basically that<br/>
&gt; the lev 15 spells we get aren&#39;t all that useful. That said we are supposidly<br/>
&gt; 3/4 warrior and 1/4 necro &lt;g&gt; but perhaps we should get a lil more power for<br/>
&gt; being SO damn neglected by society, and we dont even have inviso to visit<br/>
&gt; those exotic locations as the necros do!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; tell me what ya think and appologies for typos, im not proofreading im tired<br/>
