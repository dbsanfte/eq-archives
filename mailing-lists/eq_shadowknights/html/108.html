<div id="ygrps-yiv-411843462">why ask why?<br/>
<br/>
or better yet, why pick any of the other classes?<br/>
it all comes down on what you feel like being, what you want to accomplish,<br/>
and who you want to be. <br/>
<br/>
although a weak pet, I like having a pet around to help out deal a little<br/>
damage, and even take hits when I am ready to retreat. Something that the<br/>
other fighters cannot do.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot give you reasons on why to be a Knight of the Shadows. I like what<br/>
I do, I like who I am. When people ask what I am, I call out that I am a<br/>
Knight. we may be shadow knights, but we are knights nevertheless. Knights<br/>
with dark powers rearing over our heads. Although it may seem that we are<br/>
weak compared to many of the other classes, there has hardly been very high<br/>
level knights to truelly know if the class is weak or strong in the later<br/>
levels. This I want to see for myself. <br/>
<br/>
My Knight of the Shadows is my first, and primary character since<br/>
commercial, and I am sticking with it til 50th at least. If the cap is not<br/>
off by then, then more than likely i&#39;m gonna go try a Rogue, and I hope<br/>
their abilities are fully implemented by then.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot give a reason why you should be a knight, I can only give you<br/>
reasons why I like being a knight...everyone has different tastes in style<br/>
and gore.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to race, I don&#39;t recommend the dark elf...surely dark elves<br/>
are &quot;cool&quot;, but they have some of the weakest stats. If your gonna solo<br/>
alot, altho I dont recommend, be a Troll. on the other hand troll and<br/>
especially dark elven knights are almost quite common, you dont see many<br/>
ogre knights, nor, especially, human knights, which are quite rare indeed. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for my babblin...hope everyone picks the right course for their<br/>
knight, or if not, goodluck to you without your knighthood.<br/>

&gt; Things have been quite lately, and I&#39;ve been wondering something: why do <br/>
