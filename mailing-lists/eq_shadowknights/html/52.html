<b>Subject:</b> KoS list <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703537295">I know some might think this may be a spoiler of sorts, but anyone<br/>
interested in making a list of NPC&#39;s that KoS SK&#39;s? I know that factions<br/>
play a role in some SK&#39;s getting killed by a NPC, but there are some<br/>
that will kill us immediately no matter what we do.<br/>
    The only reason why I personally do not feel this a spoiler is<br/>
because of this simple reason. If this were a real world (and when I am<br/>
playing, I guess it is) I would definitely think that SK&#39;s would have<br/>
some sort of network to relay this exact type of info.  Also, NPC&#39;s can<br/>
see us through walls, so if I would have known that the 1st inn in<br/>
Western Karanas had an Innkeeper that will kill me immediately, I would<br/>
have given it a little wider distance  :).<br/>
    I know that /con is a great way to tell if someone will kill you if<br/>
you make contact, but sometimes that is not possible i.e. in the middle<br/>
of a fight. If I could just see the name of an NPC strolling towards me<br/>
while I am engaged in combat, I would have a little more time to create<br/>
some distance. Just as I do whenever a Griff or Giant comes a little to<br/>
close to a confrontation I may be having with a band of couple bandits.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, comments? bad idea? good idea?<br/>
