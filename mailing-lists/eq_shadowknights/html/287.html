&gt;     I have just created a DE SK and have a few<br/>
&gt; questions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     1) Is there any place near freeport that i can<br/>
&gt; buy food? I have found the Swashbuckler that will<br/>
&gt; buy my loot but he sells no food.I find it degrading<br/>
&gt; to ask the freeport residents to buy food and water<br/>
&gt; for me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     2) What is the method of getting on the boat and<br/>
&gt; over to faydwer? I have spent all my leveling<br/>
&gt; Killing orc pawns in the commons so All the guards<br/>
&gt; that I can see at the gates will con me dubiously,<br/>
&gt; but I have been afraid to enter(I am only level 5).<br/>
&gt; Will all the guards in FP area regard me dubiously?<br/>
&gt; And if I do make it over to BB, how do I elude the<br/>
&gt; guards over near the docks of BB?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you<br/>
&gt; <br/>

freeport.  I don&#39;t know about the boat trip though.<br/>
