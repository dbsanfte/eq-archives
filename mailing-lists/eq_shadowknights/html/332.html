<div id="ygrps-yiv-92659955">Hey Xillith,<br/>
<br/>
With regard to the pet issue, I saw the same thing in dueling as my SK back<br/>
in my CandyLand days on Veeshan. Now, every once in a while on Zek, as a<br/>
Necromancer, I see the same thing, so its not just a SK issue. I&#39;m not sure<br/>
whether its a bug, but I&#39;ve also heard that pets will sometimes be less than<br/>
willing to attack something that cons red to them. My latest experience with<br/>
this was with Codil the Naked Monk outside Freeport. He was only yellow to<br/>
me, and I&#39;d have taken him down, had my pet felt compelled to join me rather<br/>
than the other spectators. However, like you said, PvP is the only instance<br/>
in which I&#39;ve seen this happen, never during combat with an NPC, which leads<br/>
me to believe it&#39;s another one of Verant&#39;s little oversights.<br/>
<br/>
So if they did not intend pets to be used in PvP, they certainly need to<br/>
change some code, at least on Zek. If we can summon a pet, we should have<br/>
complete control over it and it should attack anything we direct it to,<br/>
whether that something is a Large Rat or a Hill Giant.<br/>

&gt;Fine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Point well made.  Yet, there is in fact a PvP server with unique rules not<br/>
&gt;found on any of the others for PvP ballance.  Ok, I am calm again. Let me<br/>
&gt;ask this of you:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How do you know what was intended upon design?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  We ARE ok in player vs monster.  My gripe is that I want ALL of my powers<br/>
&gt;to be brought to bear when commanded, that includes the pet.  Duels exist<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the other servers as well and I have to forget about my signature ability<br/>
&gt;while in one.  That is foolish.  Regardless of what was &quot;intended&quot;.  We are<br/>
&gt;the only class that cannot use all of our powers all of the time.  How do<br/>
&gt;you justify that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I will not complain again if the pet would just CONTRIBUTE, it makes THAT<br/>
&gt;MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE!!  A single interrupt on a wizard, just ONE will allow<br/>
&gt;me to flee or even consider fighting her!  Instead it just stands there<br/>
&gt;looking silly as I die.  Against a Ranger or Paladin the pet has no<br/>
&gt;offensive value BUT, do they know I am an SK if they haven&#39;t seen me?  Will<br/>
&gt;they take the time to consider it and realize its green?  In either case,<br/>
&gt;opening with the pet puts THE PET in their target window, not me.  I can<br/>

&gt;when I am 21st level waiting on the next one.   As it stands, an SK in a<br/>
&gt;duel is a foolish SK.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Roleplay IS infact what this game is about.  Teaming up and facing the<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I still love my DE female SK.  If I were stacking stats and not playing a<br/>
&gt;role I would always take the Ogre ( not knocking on The Horde or<br/>
&gt;anything...heh ).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hey, wizard DD casting times have dropped.  How does THAT figure into<br/>
&gt;roleplay?  If you feel the game is being reduced to hack and slash, you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;right.  Bitch at Verant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When is Microsoft releasing their game?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;must say.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;when the game was originally planned, it was NOT planned for PvP balance,<br/>
&gt;&gt;it was planned for teaming up and player vs montser balance...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;and all of you are only making comparisons of player vs player, SK vs<br/>
&gt;&gt;paladin, SK vs warrior, etc etc...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;this is the VERY reason why its not balanced for PvP, because it was NOT<br/>
&gt;&gt;originally designed to be as such...<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; All hybrids - paladins, rangers, and SKs - get an xp penalty.  Other<br/>
&gt;&gt;than<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; that, you also get one if you&#39;re non-human.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;     First off for all you scenario makers and hit<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; point compareres the the paladin would beat the crap<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; out of an SK. The paladin at level 30 with all his<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; buffs will have around 800hp&#39;s + Lay Hands gives him<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in essence 1600 hit points. Now if the SK uses his<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;mighty&quot; harm touch the paladin is down to 500 hit<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; points.  The two skills are VERY unequal.  HT does not<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; even com close to LH.  SK&#39;s are not weak but are<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; inferior to paladins at this point.  And anyway why<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the heck do us Shadow Knights Get EXP PENALTIES?<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Paladins get a BONUS while we get a PENALTY? Why do<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the evil classes get the EXP penalties?  All of my<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; friends started the same time i did they are level 21<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; i am level 15 because of the EXP and i have played<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; more then them.  The EXP penaltis are stupid as they<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; serve no roleplaying service and EQ is a roleplaying game.<br/>
