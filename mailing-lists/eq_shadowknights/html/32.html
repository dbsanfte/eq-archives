<div id="ygrps-yiv-47722224">I think harm touch and lay on hands are pretty damn unbalanced myself. I been <br/>
harm touch in theory is friggin, great, especially at lower levels. But as <br/>
people get higher levels say level 30, to times 30 giving a 300hp harmtouch <br/>
is in now way going to be as worthwhile as lay on hands giving a level 30 <br/>
Paladin their 700-800 odd hp back! What&#39;s more, harmtouch CAN be resisted <br/>
either totaly or partialy. Also on the EQlizer site, it says basically that <br/>
the lev 15 spells we get aren&#39;t all that useful. That said we are supposidly <br/>
3/4 warrior and 1/4 necro &lt;g&gt; but perhaps we should get a lil more power for <br/>
being SO damn neglected by society, and we dont even have inviso to visit <br/>
those exotic locations as the necros do!<br/>
<br/>
tell me what ya think and appologies for typos, im not proofreading im tired <br/>
