&gt; guys i know how to complete this quest. Cracktusk or<br/>
&gt; whatever his name is in south karana is a rare spawn<br/>
&gt; elephant who sometimes drops bull elephant tusk. i<br/>
&gt; killed him yesterday and he dropped a gigatic chipped<br/>
&gt; tusk or something. me and my necro friend were very<br/>
&gt; happy cause we thought it would work for the quest so<br/>
&gt; she got some beetle eyes from kerra isle and went back<br/>
&gt; to neriak and it didn&#39;t work :( after a little while<br/>
&gt; of myself yelling at a gm, the gm told me that<br/>
&gt; cracktusk drops the bull elephant tusks but it is<br/>
&gt; rare...cracktusk is rare enough so good luck.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

and it completed the quest.  I turned in the one tusk<br/>
and the combined beetle eye at the same time.  He did <br/>
say &quot;I was expecting mammoth tusks&quot; before telling me<br/>
I was a good sk, which I thought was odd.  My reward<br/>
was the 22nd SK spell Convoke Shadow (pet).  After<br/>
doing this, he said another paragraph with a phrase<br/>
[in brackets] but he wouldn&#39;t respond to it.  All I want<br/>
is a ring of the dead, that isn&#39;t asking too much, is<br/>
it? ;)<br/>
