&gt; Greetings Brother of the Shadows,<br/>
&gt; Well, I don&#39;t know of the quest you are trying to complete, or if this<br/>
&gt; information has changed any, but I know of a &quot;friend&quot; of mine in Qeynos<br/>
&gt; who<br/>
&gt; happens to be a Paladin of the Temple of Thunder. She had orders from<br/>
&gt; her guild<br/>
&gt; leader, Runethar Hamest (spelling?) to go to Surefall Glade in the<br/>
&gt; Jaggedpines<br/>
&gt; and get the Bayle List from one of the Rangers there (name<br/>
&gt; forgotten-easy to<br/>
&gt; find, but evil is killed on sight) However, upon arriving, she finds<br/>
&gt; that the<br/>
&gt; Bayle list has been eaten, along with the Ranger&#39;s son (snicker) by the<br/>
&gt; great<br/>
&gt; Mammoth Beast of the Pines.  My &quot;friend&quot; knows of an entrance to the<br/>
&gt; cave where<br/>
&gt; the mammoth lives, but it&#39;s from inside Surefall. By the way, the<br/>
&gt; Mammoth is a<br/>
&gt; huge bear. And Antonius Bayle hired the Temple of Thunder to deliver the<br/>
&gt; list to<br/>
&gt; him, because he doesn&#39;t trust his own guards.  That&#39;s what I know of the<br/>
&gt; Bayle<br/>
&gt; list.  It could be that someone or something killed the mammoth, or the<br/>
&gt; quest<br/>
&gt; just suddenly changed, or perhaps there&#39;s more than one Bayle list<br/>
&gt; wandering<br/>
&gt; about, I don&#39;t know.  Just thought maybe this could be of some help. May<br/>
&gt; Innoruuk<br/>
&gt; guide your hatred.<br/>
&gt; Look for me on Tunare,<br/>
