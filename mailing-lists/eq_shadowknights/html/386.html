<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008106043">I agree with you too... pets are nothing but trouble from when you first get <br/>
them at level 9.  From attracting monsters, to just plain falling off <br/>
bridges when you are crossing the zone.  I think somehow we should start a <br/>
petition, for example everyone on this list logs onto UO and does a /w all <br/>
shad, then ya tell all your fellow shadowknights(or just the ones above <br/>
level 9) to do a /petition requesting the spell changes.  This way there <br/>
would be a large amount of petitions coming in from almost every server, <br/>
something verant, if they pay attention to paladin rants should not ignore.<br/>
<br/>
About the soul reaver, all I can say is if its real jump on it :P, but keep <br/>
a look out, there should be better swords in the future.<br/>

&gt;I also agree. As of now, and maybe from now on, I will not ever use my pet<br/>
&gt;again. Bringing the pet through Lower Guk would be something that no one is<br/>
&gt;stupid enough to do. And since grouping is basically mandatory after level<br/>
&gt;20 (or level 30 depending on what you fight), pets, in my opinion, is <br/>
&gt;almost<br/>
&gt;useless at that point. Sure, there is an occasional spectre that Bony might<br/>
&gt;help, but it does more harm than good. If the change was made, I would be<br/>
&gt;using the new Lifetap spells more than I would use the Summon Pet series.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I always thought it will be cool to be a fighter with a pet. But seeing the<br/>
&gt;SK downtime and the uselessness of the pet (doesn&#39;t attack in PvP and <br/>
&gt;duels,<br/>
&gt;train-makers), I quickly realized that the pet is nothing more than a<br/>
&gt;novelty and needs to be replaced. Unless they change the mobs <br/>
&gt;aggressiveness<br/>
&gt;towards the pet being dependent upon the SK&#39;s level, I see no reason to<br/>
&gt;summon a pet in a dungeon.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Shadowknights don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; &gt;the diversity their exp penalty should grant.  Lifespike (10 dmg) should <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt;a lvl 9 spell, vampiric embrace moves to 15 and then the level 12 necro<br/>
&gt; &gt;lifetap is at 22....sound fair? I like it.  As of the moment just getting<br/>
&gt; &gt;the lifetap series would be too powerful...and I&#39;d trade ol Gebeker in <br/>
&gt;any<br/>
&gt; &gt;day for a way to heal myself.<br/>
