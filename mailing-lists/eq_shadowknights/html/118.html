<div id="ygrps-yiv-181929763">At 80 int you could cast Leering Corpse at 9, eh? Then I wonder why a <br/>
darkelf SK with an INT of 110 didn&#39;t have enough mana at 9...hmmm..something <br/>
strange is definitley going on. Any one have a clue to the mechanics  for SKs <br/>
mana? I wonder if a hidden racial modifier is in play...just seems strange <br/>
that someone with a 30 point Int deficit could cast this spell, but I had to <br/>
wait till 10.<br/>
