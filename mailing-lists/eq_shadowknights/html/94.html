<div id="ygrps-yiv-737784714">when in north freeport, dont talk to any of the guards, they all have Sir<br/>
for a title, they are all Paladins. Do not enter the Paladin guild nor the<br/>
cleric guild either, so I was told. you can walk by the guards, just dont<br/>
talk to these wandering guards.<br/>
<br/>
in west freeport, do not go upstair inside the inn, there is a dwarf in<br/>
the, and a high elf, that will kill you.<br/>
<br/>
in east freeport, the building on the docks, not the one you go through to<br/>
get to the boat, but the one you see after you go through the last building<br/>
to get to the boat, the one right in front of you as you exist this last<br/>
building (hope you know what I am talking about), do not go in there from<br/>
the upper floor, there is an ogre in there that will kill you<br/>
