<div id="ygrps-yiv-297464890">I am curious as well. I had a 13th level troll shadowknight and ended up<br/>
quiting it because I got sick of kill stealers on the Rathe (play on RK<br/>
now). I had the thought that trolls made the best SK bar none because of<br/>
regenerate and the ability to bash with a two handed sword; but now am<br/>
thinking dark elf just because of I like the image. (but no bash unless<br/>
using a shield). Ah well. So all you dark elves the question is why?<br/>

&gt; i am in the process of starting a new shadow knight.  i would appreciate<br/>
&gt; any suggestions about race, where to place my skill points (str, agi,<br/>
&gt; dex, etc.) , one handed weapons vs. two handed, suggestions for leveling<br/>
&gt; etc.  i have tried several web sites, but they were all really basic eq<br/>
&gt; stuff.  all suggestions are appreciated.<br/>
