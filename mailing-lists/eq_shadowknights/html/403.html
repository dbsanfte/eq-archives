<b>Subject:</b> Petition???? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834191557">What ever happened to that petition someone was<br/>
starting.  I have thought much about the changes we<br/>
want. I think that there should be no large changes. <br/>
You are forgetting that this is not supposed to be a<br/>
solo game and it is not supposed to be a exclusive<br/>
fighting game.  This is a role playing game.  Role<br/>
playing does involve fightng however so i am not<br/>
against alll changes.  I am tired of a petition from<br/>
every single *&%^ class about how they are uneven and<br/>
need to be made better. They are uneven for a reason. <br/>
It is a GROUP game. If there was a group (i know only<br/>
6 per group theoreticly speaking though) and there was<br/>
one of each class in it they could easily kill<br/>
something 2-5 levels higher then them. But if one of<br/>
the classes left say the warrior and got replaced by<br/>
the supposed &quot;most damage doing class&quot; wizard the<br/>
group would be killed because there is not a warrior<br/>
which is the best tank.  Sure the paladin and shadow<br/>
knight would tank but the would not lasts nearly as<br/>
long as the warrior.  I don&#39;t mind minor changes like<br/>
adding a non combat related spell that is what i call<br/>
&quot;god bestowed&quot; where as in the shadow knights case if<br/>
they got invisibility it should be something that the<br/>
evil god&#39;s do that makes them invisible such as<br/>
turning them into a shadow. As long as the change can<br/>
be &quot;god bestowed&quot; it is ok but just &#39;oh my paladin is<br/>
not good enough to solo i need a bow even though it is<br/>
against the code of paladins&#39; complaing type changes<br/>
that are against the RPing story of that class.<br/>
