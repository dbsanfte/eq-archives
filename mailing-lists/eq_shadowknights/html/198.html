<div id="ygrps-yiv-902920895">This is just my opinion, but it all depends on how you want to play.<br/>
Ogres -group.<br/>
Trolls - solo.<br/>
<br/>
Humans and Dark Elves in my opinion don&#39;t make very good shadowknights.<br/>
They have higher int than Trolls and Ogres but have nowhere near the Str.<br/>
We are 3/4 warriors 1/4 necros so I wouldn&#39;t worry to much about int. Also<br/>
they can&#39;t bash unless thay have a shield and all the Shadow Knights only<br/>
weapons are 2h.  On E&#39;ci it seems that most Shadow Knights are Dark Elf<br/>
followed by Humans. I guess people just like the look of them better. I&#39;ll<br/>
list the advantages and disadvatages of all of them and just pick the one<br/>
you want to play.<br/>
<br/>
Ogres-Infravision, bash, highest stats except int.<br/>
           -Only can go to two towns(Ogre and DE), Exp penatly.<br/>
Trolls-Infravsion, bash, regeneration, 2nd highest stats except int.<br/>
           -Only can go to two towns(Grobb and DE) Biggest exp penatly.(My<br/>
opinion, hardest character to play)<br/>
Dark Elves-Ultravision, highest int, can go to all 3 evil towns.<br/>
                    -No bash, low stats, exp penatly<br/>
Humans-Exp bonus cancles out Exp penalty, can travel much easier than the<br/>
others.<br/>
              -Low stats, no bash., no infravision<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everyone has there own opinions on which class is the best, so just pick<br/>
the one you will get the most enjoyment playing.<br/>

&gt; because i can start over.<br/>
