&gt; THE RING:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In a phrase...kicks ass.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One charge of bind affinity, rechargeable by a merchant in the lodge of the<br/>
&gt; dead.  80plat.  I do not recall the name of the merchant, but if you ask<br/>
&gt; them &quot;what is the ring of the dead&quot; one of them will offer to recharge it.<br/>
&gt; The recharger is a female one the first floor of the Lodge of the Dead.  Now<br/>
&gt; if it sounds like a DE only thing, you&#39;re right.  The ring is SK, Necro and<br/>
&gt; dark elf only.  (sorry all you Humans Ogres and Trolls, you get to walk a<br/>
&gt; little farther from bind point....hehe)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, it is only 10 gold to have it recharged.  This is the <br/>
price she quotes me, and recharges it for that.  BTW, all you <br/>
other SKs out there, rememeber to target yourself before you click<br/>
on it.  I messed up once and was really irked.<br/>
