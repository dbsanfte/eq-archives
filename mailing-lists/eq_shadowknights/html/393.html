<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054576370">Well, everyone needs to decide who they want submitting this petition.  Amatai (the onelist moderator) wants what mails I have received from people here so that he can submit a petition.  Its all up to everyone here.<br/>
<br/>
I also liked the recent note concerning out pets.  I haven&#39;t used my pet in at least 10 levels now.  Would you all prefer if we were to get a lifetap series over having a pet?  I feel that our pets are actually more of a burden than a benefit usually, but not always.  I feel that Verant has always tried to point out that we are special because we&#39;re the only hybrid that gets a pet.  Well...I don&#39;t think it is that much of a benefit and perhaps if they were to take it away, maybe we&#39;d get other things to replace it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just my 2cc worth.  Let me know what you think.<br/>
