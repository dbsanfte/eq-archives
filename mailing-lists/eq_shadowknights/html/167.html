&gt;Where is Runnyeye?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Runnyeye is beside Misty Thicket. The blackened armor is obtained as loot.<br/>
This place is for level 20 or so, but I bought mine at an earlier stage for<br/>
400pp.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Where&#39;s the best place to buy banded, or get it as loot??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Banded armor can be made through smithing. And while I&#39;m at it, I&#39;ll<br/>
advertise my prices hehe. If you were on Mithaniel Marr, I would gladly make<br/>
them for you for the following price:<br/>
Tunic: 19pp, Pants: 14pp, Mantle: 12pp, Helm: 10pp, Sleeves: 8pp, Mask: 7pp,<br/>
Belt: 7pp, Bracer: 3pp, Gorget: 3pp, Boots: 6pp</div>
