 </span></blockquote>Ogres and Trolls can go into one anothers towns.  Just not to certain <br/>
guilds.  I am a Troll SK and have been to Oggok many times.  The only thing <br/>
you have to look out for is to stay away from the warriors guild, not that <br/>
hard, and Chef Dugan, doesn&#39;t like us for some reason.  I assume this is <br/>
similar for the Ogres as well.<br/>
<br/>
The Troll SK is a great solo class.  I am currently 21st level and soloing <br/>
is still no problem for me.  The increased Strength I believe does make a <br/>
difference, just not until you get to 20th level.  My damage increased by <br/>
over 5 points from what it was doing with my halberd.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have had no problems with mana and didn&#39;t touch my int.  Once you <br/>
get your skills high enough they have no prob maxing out. Once I level, it <br/>
only takes me a couple of battles to get them up to max.  On spells again, I <br/>
should be able to layer on those spells with ease.  Yes, we are tanks and <br/>
who would want to solo a Spectre, thats why there are other people in your <br/>
party. I was attacked by a Spectre at level 19 and lived to zone, was a <br/>
pillar 2.  Our spells help us a lot, but we are mostly tanks with mana bars <br/>
and pets, at least with my experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents<br/>
