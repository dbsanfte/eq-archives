<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140846783">No, we still can use a bow but I have been keeping an eye on the paladin<br/>
list and saw that they had a skill cap of like 75 (or was it 70?) for<br/>
archery, or at least it was stated as such.  I was wondering do we also have<br/>
the skill cap?<br/>

Hmm, last time I checked, SK&#39;s could use bows as well. Has that changed??<br/>
