Hey Lloyd,<br/>
     Xillith here, I am relatively new at the SK myself but I have <br/>
realized a few things:<br/>
<br/>
1)  SAVE THE HARM TOUCH!  You will need it in a pinch and nothing <br/>
freaks out a PKer more than the big SHAZAM!<br/>
<br/>
1a) The touch does as a rule of thumb (not recorded anywhere) Level x <br/>
10 dammage + 1-3 pts per level. So, 11-13 dammage per level SK per <br/>
touch.  At fifth level, I dropped a human fighter who was &quot;yellow&quot; to <br/>
me from 3/4 life to dead, BOOM!!  He had no idea I was an SK until <br/>
that moment of truth, so savor it.  Remember though, the touch is <br/>
treated as a spell and CAN BE SAVED AGAINST for partial or NO <br/>
dammage!!!  So be carefull around Dwarves and other such highly <br/>
resistant little crappers cause you will waste a good ability and wait <br/>
24 game hours to get it back!!<br/>
<br/>
2)  Use anon.  Harm touch is your ace.  If averyone thinks you are a <br/>
warrior, they will never see it comeing.  Save it for the END of the <br/>
fight as a COUP DE&#39;GRAS.  Using it too early could scare your prey <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Do NOT use all of your training each level.  When you are ready to <br/>
use a skill craft, dump the points of your choice into it and watch <br/>
you expertise take off!<br/>
<br/>
4)  Before commiting to a skill craft, make sure your home town <br/>
supports it.  Example, Neriak doea not have the complete list O&#39; junk <br/>
needed to make bows.  So, Dark Elves seeking fletching will be very <br/>
dissapointed when they discover that they need to be at least 13th <br/>
level to cross the terrain alone needed to get them to a complete <br/>
store only to be either attacked on sight or ignored by the merchants.<br/>
I  have no idea what the Troll and Ogre lands offer.<br/>
<br/>
5)  Take crap from NO ONE!!!  Join a guild, and display your colors <br/>
proudly.  LIE ( you&#39;re evil so who cares) get into a duel and fry your <br/>
opponent with the &quot; BIG WHAMMY&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
6)  Realize that you are hated even more than the necromancer!  Yep, <br/>
you are EQs&#39; enemy #1 and ALWAYS WILL BE.  So expect to die and die <br/>
often.  Therefore, buy bags at your first opportunity and keep your <br/>
stuff in there (bags cannot be looted).  Also, if you are about to <br/>
loose a fight and you have a weapon you like, open your inventoery and <br/>
move it into your bag!!  Your killer will be pissed off when the <br/>
armour or weapon that they wanted is safe in your bag and out of their <br/>
reach!!!!  You cannot protect any cash you had though, thats life.  <br/>
Have discipline, leave a few empty spaces in your large sac or <br/>
backpack for your prized equipment.  If you disagree, consider the <br/>
cost of replacing a Two-Handed sword over a friggin bear pelt you <br/>
scavenged!<br/>
<br/>
JOIN A GUILD!!  REALLY!!  DO IT!! Not an @sshole guild either, shop <br/>
around and remember, you are who your friends are, and that could mean <br/>
life sucks!!  If you play a female Dark Elf (me) JOIN THE BLOOD COVEN <br/>
and tell &#39;Brin&#39; the Grand Matron, that Xillith sent you.  I need the <br/>
bennie points :)<br/>
<br/>
SO!  Kill proudly, kill often, and play a Dark Elf female because we <br/>
are the coolest.  Enjoy EQ, everyone else does!!<br/>
<br/>
