<b>Subject:</b> Re: Pet for Lifetap? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001860283">I also agree. As of now, and maybe from now on, I will not ever use my pet<br/>
again. Bringing the pet through Lower Guk would be something that no one is<br/>
stupid enough to do. And since grouping is basically mandatory after level<br/>
20 (or level 30 depending on what you fight), pets, in my opinion, is almost<br/>
useless at that point. Sure, there is an occasional spectre that Bony might<br/>
help, but it does more harm than good. If the change was made, I would be<br/>
using the new Lifetap spells more than I would use the Summon Pet series.<br/>
<br/>
I always thought it will be cool to be a fighter with a pet. But seeing the<br/>
SK downtime and the uselessness of the pet (doesn&#39;t attack in PvP and duels,<br/>
train-makers), I quickly realized that the pet is nothing more than a<br/>
novelty and needs to be replaced. Unless they change the mobs aggressiveness<br/>
towards the pet being dependent upon the SK&#39;s level, I see no reason to<br/>
summon a pet in a dungeon.<br/>

&gt;Shadowknights don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt;the diversity their exp penalty should grant.  Lifespike (10 dmg) should be<br/>
&gt;a lvl 9 spell, vampiric embrace moves to 15 and then the level 12 necro<br/>
&gt;lifetap is at 22....sound fair? I like it.  As of the moment just getting<br/>
&gt;the lifetap series would be too powerful...and I&#39;d trade ol Gebeker in any<br/>
&gt;day for a way to heal myself. </span></blockquote></div>
