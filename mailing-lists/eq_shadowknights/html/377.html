<div id="ygrps-yiv-301667662">Grimrott is in S Karana just over the bridge. There&#39;s 2 spawns of him, one <br/>
where he&#39;s in full armor and carries the scythe - about level 30-32. And <br/>
another where he&#39;s naked, but sometimes carries the scythe - about level 28. <br/>
As an SK you can (or should be able to) go up and speak to him, by doing so <br/>
he tempts you into trying to kill him heh, saying if you defeat him you&#39;ll <br/>
get his weapon.<br/>
