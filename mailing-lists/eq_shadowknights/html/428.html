<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597875100">OK<br/>
<br/>
It starts with being able to chat with Gizdean Gix in West Commons.  If you <br/>
cannot do this you cannot have the ring or scithe.<br/>
<br/>
1) Give Gix the following message:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;utalk adarev otcin&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He gives you a note.<br/>
<br/>
2) Take the note into Befallen and give it to Skeleton Lrodd.  He says some <br/>
gak and releases Commander Windstream.  Windstream is a big zombie who is of <br/>
ill temperment.  I do not know what level he is.  I do know that he was blue <br/>
to a lvl 33 SK (me), and is built like a brick S*** House.<br/>
<br/>
3) Windstream spawns by the false wall in level 3, by the chair.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>
roam that I know of.  Kill him and get the stem of the Thex Mallet.  The <br/>
stem is a container, so allow a slot for one.<br/>
<br/>
4) There are two other parts to the mallet.  The head and the handle thingy. <br/>
  They are only found by the elf skelleton that stands by the locked door to <br/>
lvl 3.  If the elf skell isn&#39;t there a dread bone will be.  Kill the dread <br/>
bone and wait, the spawn rate is about 6 or 7 min.  (yea, I had alot of free <br/>
time *frowns*)<br/>
<br/>
5) OK, now you have all three parts to the mallet.  Put the head and handle <br/>
in the stem and combine.  The Thex Mallet is created.<br/>
<br/>
6) Boogie back to Neriak Third Gate, to the Lodge of the Dead.  On the <br/>
second floor is the SK Loveal (sp).  Give him the mallet.  He will either <br/>
give you the Reaper of the Dead: Lore 2H slash 12 40 +4str with one charge <br/>
of Complete Healing(YAY), or the Ring of the Dead.<br/>
<br/>
Mind you, I did the quest about 18 times.  I am warmly regarded with the <br/>
Dead.  In fact, I stoped getting favorable faction hits (could this be <br/>
why?).  Regardless, the Reaper sells to merchants for over 10plat and the <br/>
complete heal (much like Lay Hands) is a priceless ability for our non <br/>
healing class.<br/>
<br/>
I only sold one charged Reaper, and that was to a very senior human SK.  <br/>
PLEASE dont use it to twink light races!!  It is for US and US alone.  If I <br/>
ever see a High Elf wizard &quot;lay hands&quot; on himself I will loose my mind, <br/>
because I will be pretty sure how he did it.  But i firmly believe that once <br/>
you take the time to wait for Gix, get the mallet, and make the Reaper you <br/>
will be very reluctant to part with your full heal.<br/>
<br/>
The SPENT Reaper sells to players from 80 to 110 plat on rallos zek.  It has <br/>
outstanding stats and is in my opinion up to par with the Grob Cleaver and <br/>
it has a better &quot;in character&quot; look to it.  I made about 1.5K plat selling <br/>
spent Reavers to players and sold a full one for 600(rofl).  This quest is <br/>
one I will do many times, even though i have the Ring.<br/>
<br/>
THE RING:<br/>
<br/>
In a phrase...kicks ass.<br/>
<br/>
One charge of bind affinity, rechargeable by a merchant in the lodge of the <br/>
dead.  80plat.  I do not recall the name of the merchant, but if you ask <br/>
them &quot;what is the ring of the dead&quot; one of them will offer to recharge it.  <br/>
The recharger is a female one the first floor of the Lodge of the Dead.  Now <br/>
if it sounds like a DE only thing, you&#39;re right.  The ring is SK, Necro and <br/>
dark elf only.  (sorry all you Humans Ogres and Trolls, you get to walk a <br/>
little farther from bind point....hehe)<br/>
<br/>
Now here I am, a lvl 34 SK bound IN Permafrost.  The Ring looses some of <br/>
it&#39;s usefullness since I often run with Clerics who can Resurect me back to <br/>
my body.  BUT, for those solo excursions and groups with only druids/shaman <br/>
or rangers/paladins to heal...it is a real gem.<br/>
<br/>
SO DON&#39;T GIVE UP!!!!<br/>
<br/>
It is out there, it is a working quest, and it is SOOO sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Also, The Dark Reaver is a weapon to die for folks.  Get it get it get it.  <br/>
Hunt Guk until exhasted, by the time you can get it from the Assassin you <br/>
will be a Froglok killing expert and the owner of many new levels and items <br/>
to boot.  Guk is made for us, no joke.  Practice your evocations so that you <br/>
can Ward Undead right beside your necros and clerics, casues Dead Side is <br/>
where it&#39;s at AND we get Expulse Undead at 39 which is just iceing on the <br/>
cake.<br/>
<br/>
For all you young SKs out there, DONT GIVE UP!!!  I almost quit in disgust <br/>
many times and I am on a PvP server, so I have that to deal with at times as <br/>
well.  But I love my charecter so much I stuck with it.  The SK suffers SO <br/>
much at low levels, but once you crest over 20 and get your dual attack, and <br/>
then 22 where you get some minor healing and other usefull spells if you&#39;re <br/>
rescourcefull...there is no looking back.  I often have 130 dammage sets if <br/>
I DONT reposte, and no dual wield weapons anyone can get untwinked at my <br/>
level come close to compeating.  Our pet now contributes in PvP (THEY <br/>
LISTENED!!) and I find my class being more welcome in groups than the <br/>
paladin or ranger.<br/>
<br/>
PvP?  Dont get me started.  We rule.  Warrior with big whacker and pet = <br/>
move along to next target.  Our ability to Shadowstep and lay layer after <br/>
layer of DoT is truely dreaded, and the harm touch means I dont have to <br/>
personaly kill them all the way.  PvP with other tanks is tough due to their <br/>
hit points and resistances, but I eat casters for lunch (except those damn <br/>
enchanters, they suck!  But Pumice Stones are a spiffy solution to Charm)<br/>
<br/>
wow, I am just going on and on!!<br/>
<br/>
Enough.  Lets revive this board and get the newer players in the swing of <br/>
the best class in all of Norrath, the dreaded Shadowknight!!!<br/>
<br/>
Xillith, devoted Knight and daughter of our Lord in Hatred.<br/>
Blood Coven<br/>
Rallos Zek(of course)<br/>
<br/>
take care all<br/>

&gt;Hey, would it be a huge hassle if you could give the ring of the dead steps <br/>
&gt;again?<br/>
&gt;And who to ask about it, I&#39;m anxious also to get this...<br/>
&gt;Also, does anyone know how I could recharge the Pestilence Scythe from Lord <br/>
&gt;Grimrot<br/>
&gt;in south karana? it used to be called the opal scythe, but changed with <br/>
&gt;last<br/>
&gt;patch.. I can only guess that he would recharge it, but I&#39;m afraid to <br/>
&gt;try... not<br/>
&gt;sure about how to recharge things at all. Strangely, this scythe can be <br/>
&gt;used by<br/>
&gt;necromancers. Imagine a necro with 2 hand slash... yeah.<br/>

&gt; &gt; It needed the Thex Mallet after all.  Do that and it&#39;s yours.  THe quest <br/>
