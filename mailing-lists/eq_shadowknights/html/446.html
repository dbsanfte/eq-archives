<b>Subject:</b> Whats the Truth on Deuling(nonpvp server) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438169030">Hello  Fellow Dark Knights,<br/>
 I play on a non PVP server and I was wondering about what happens when you<br/>
Duel.<br/>
<br/>
1. Do you loose EXP if you Die.(or gain if you win)<br/>
<br/>
2.Can you be looted for items?<br/>
<br/>
3. Can you be looted for cash on hand?<br/>
<br/>
I have asked many people that I have grouped with and I get different<br/>
answers each time. Some say you cant be looted, some say you can but only<br/>
loose one item(if true, which item? they pick or random?). Some say you<br/>
loose all cash on hand. Some say you dont.  Someone please give me the<br/>
straight scoop. I have a feeling that some ppl tell me I cant be looted<br/>
because they want a chance at looting my Dark Reaver or my Skull Shaped<br/>
Barabute. I am currently turning down all invitations to duel because<br/>
Nothing is worth the chance of loosing even one of my hard earned items, and<br/>
since the banks are not very handy for us, I carry alot of PP around with<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
PS. Does entering into a PVP area change any looting rules?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time and Spread Evil</div>
