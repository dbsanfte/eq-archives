<b>Subject:</b> on switching servers for a guild <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681935158">Greetings Shadowknights,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m fairly sure that once a guild is approved, it can be set on any or<br/>
all servers, but I was wondering how.  Must you re-create the same<br/>
character, and then talk to a GM? Or is is more complicated? Recently, I<br/>
started a guild on Tunare with another character, and now I&#39;d like to<br/>
have it on Rallos Zek, because it is probably the greatest server for<br/>
roleplaying, hands down.  Any advice is appreciated!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
