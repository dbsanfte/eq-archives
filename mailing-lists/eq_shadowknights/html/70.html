<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-287985400">There is a band of NPC&#39;s, 4 I think, that travel in North Karanas. They<br/>
have killed me once with no verbal contact. I had a chance to /con the<br/>
whole group last night and they were all conned as KoS. I will try to<br/>
get some names of this merry group later tonight, as I will be in their<br/>
area again.<br/>
<br/>
Also, probably well known, but the NPC&#39;s of Permafrost will also KoS,<br/>
except for a gentleman who hangs out on the platform of some ruins. He<br/>
will not give you the time of day, but he will not KoS either.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, hope this helps somebody out.<br/>
