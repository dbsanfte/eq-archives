<div id="ygrps-yiv-148001714">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I hear there is a merchant in the Oasis of Marr that sells combine weapons, <br/>
but I have no idea how much.  I have the (Lore) Shiny Brass Haldbred that <br/>
was dropped by the named orc in High Hold, dmg 16, not sure of speed.  I do <br/>
not use it much unless running with my sisters because I cannot bag the <br/>
weapon and it makes me a walking shooting gallery.  Sometimes powerfull <br/>
charecters sell Rune Totem Staves, I used to have one.  Now I realise that a <br/>
stick is not very Knight like, but no one complains when you are the only <br/>
tank beating back the ghoul in Befallen.  I didn&#39;t actually start collecting <br/>
magic weapons as loot untill I was 17th level.  That may be because we <br/>
didn&#39;t know where to go or just refused to brave the goody lands and risk <br/>
attack.  At your level, all you can do is save your snake fangs and buy one.<br/>
<br/>

HEY, is anyone aware of a container that will fit a haldbred?  Shiny Brass <br/>
is useless to me if I cannot bag it with all the scrapes I get into.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

&gt;Hello all. I occasionally take a break from my magi to play a sk on Xegony.<br/>
&gt;I was wondering what would be a nice 2H magic weapon to quest for, for a<br/>
&gt;first magic weapon. I&#39;m not asking for any real spoilers, perhaps someone<br/>
&gt;could point me in the right direction ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My troll is level 8 at the moment and had saved enough plat to by a regular<br/>
&gt;steel halberd at 36p. I&#39;ve been told a few time that was monumentously<br/>
&gt;stupid, but heh what can I say, troll&#39;s ain&#39;t rose that far out of the<br/>
&gt;swamp ) Anyway, having only played a magi I&#39;m not used to dealing with<br/>
&gt;weapons and such, so what would be nice to have ? what are some price <br/>
&gt;ranges<br/>
&gt;to save for, etc ? Any help/thoughts on the subject would be cool, and my<br/>
&gt;thanks to you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
