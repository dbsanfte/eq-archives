<br/>
THe taunts for all the hybrid tanks maxes out at about 160.  It only makes <br/>
sense that the pure warrior is the best taunter though.  I use DoTs and <br/>
Disease Cloud (yes you read that right) to instill agro.  Mobs hate that <br/>
cheesy lvl 1 necro spell and the spells I stack on them help me turn them to <br/>
me as well.  I have to admit though, I am no where near as good a taunter as <br/>
my companion warrior.  I never said we were perfect  :}<br/>
