<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989829630">&lt;&lt; I dont know about more than one Bayle list, but there is more than One<br/>
 Bayle...Antonious&#39;s brother, Kane, who has allied with the bloodsabers.<br/>
 <br/>
 this is almost sounding to be like a movie =)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lol indeed... I know however the letter is in reference to Antonious as this <br/>
quest leads on from, as ive said assasinating the messenger from Qeynos. This <br/>
messenger is carrying a letter from Antonious warning the hall of truth that <br/>
their &quot;spy&quot; is in danger of being caught. The SK guy then gets pissed that <br/>
Antonious is working with the Hall of Truth. Perhaps i should use me cunning <br/>
and er, stolen Qeynos Guard shield to infiltrate the City of Qeynos and speak <br/>
to Anotinous myself =PP</div>
