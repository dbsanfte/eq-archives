<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196406629">Wow, that was darn nice of you, i must admit i think this list is a great<br/>
idea,<br/>
<br/>
it was my understanding that the shadowknight was to be a knockoff of the<br/>
anti-paladin in the AD&D world and if it is, then it is a bad one, the AP is<br/>
so much more powerfull then we are, it isnt even funny, first there is the<br/>
aura around him that causes fright, because he is sooooo damn ugly, he also<br/>
later in life has the opertunity to summon the great dark reaver, or a<br/>
nightmare to ride, i mean it has been a long time, since i played ad&d but i<br/>
still remember my favorit class, and this was gonna be a good knock off<br/>
......hehe right,<br/>
<br/>
but it is still fun to play,<br/>

&gt;Since I moderate this list I figured I&#39;d take this interesting topic to a<br/>
&gt;higher level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wrote directly to John Smedley (president of verant) and told him about<br/>
&gt;your concerns. I even took <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:JACKiam1@...">JACKiam1@...</a> &#39;s mail and sent that with it.<br/>
