<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485184847">OK, whom do we e-mail? Does one person speak for us? Whom is that? Should be<br/>
a very high level SK, because you would think he/she would know what they<br/>
are talking about, and Verant would at least take them somewhat seriously.<br/>
Or do we flood Verant with e-mail?<br/>
<br/>
Question how did the Paladins get their changes made?<br/>
<br/>
If we flood we need to have a general topic (shouldn&#39;t send a form letter to<br/>
them). So we address:<br/>
1) weak pet. what do we want done? we get an even level pet?  Need answers<br/>
on this from people.<br/>
2) harm touch resistance. should be none, since is was bestowed upon us by a<br/>
god? right? I didn&#39;t have a choice on god&#39;s therefor it must be a god thing<br/>
right?<br/>
3) want healing. at what level do we want it? 22? 15? 29? what level is it<br/>
feasible, according to necro spells.<br/>
4) exp point penalty. have no comment on this, other than that&#39;s life.<br/>
5) bad faction. same no comment. (or lack of any thing to say about it)<br/>
6) Invisibility at level 22. (rather be 15, just because I am 15, and that<br/>
is why if one person speaks for us it should be done by a level 45+ SK,<br/>
don&#39;t know of anyone that high though)<br/>
7) did I miss anything?<br/>
<br/>
By the way if someone has the e-mail address, or how the paladins got their<br/>
changes let us know.  All I have seen/heard are complaints and I would like<br/>
to change this and that. Someone actually know how? Would hate to just<br/>
aggravate Verant, and have them just deleting messages from us.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about all the question, just don&#39;t see anything progressing from this<br/>
string.  Some high level SK stand up and take charge, and inform us lower<br/>
level characters.  Information is power.<br/>

Thanks hon,<br/>
     Lets take it to Verant and see what they think.  I&#39;m sure we will not<br/>
raise any new complaints but at least we can complain in a civil and<br/>
organised fashion.  I noticed an earlier post on this board regarding<br/>
forming a petition, lets all put in our two cents.  I&#39;ve gotten attached to<br/>
the SK and would really like to see it pan out as a fully respected class.<br/>
