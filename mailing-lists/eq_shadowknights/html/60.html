<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729661995">You have to understand that a magic attack that did 800 damage would <br/>
be insanely powerful.  Ok, lets just say that paladins and <br/>
shadowknights are evenly matched fighting hth, you both injure each <br/>
other down to 1/2 hp.  Probably not enough to warrant the paladins <br/>
Lay Hands.... but then you harm touch him finishing off his remaining <br/>
hps, dropping him dead to the ground.  THAT is the benefit of our <br/>
ability.  Now, our spells may not be the greatest at first, but later <br/>
on they start becoming MUCH better.   For example our DoT spells, and <br/>
lifedrain spells can be VERY helpful.  Our pets aren&#39;t meant to kill <br/>
the enemy, but be more of a DoT thing, they stand there inflicting <br/>
extra damage on the enemy as you fight them as well.  Things in EQ <br/>
are actually quite well balanced, and I commend verant on a job well <br/>
done.<br/>

&gt;I have played through many classes and have found the SK to be <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, the Shadow Knight&#39;s HT does 201 damage - not even half of the <br/>
