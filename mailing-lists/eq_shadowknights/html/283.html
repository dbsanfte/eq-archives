<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686424205">Hey how are you?Well I am a level 16 shamen(barb)and if you would tell me more about your guild,,what you guys stand for how you propose to help fellow guild members.<br/>
  My idea of a good guild is to help fellow guild members,,,,an example if i was a master tailer i would make armour for my guild members free of charge,,,and if you got out of line well we kill you just like the mob if you canot up hold the meanings of being in a guild then death is what you get.......<br/>
    We help out the new members by helping them level to upper levels as soon as possible,,,,i was once in a very bad guild called   WOLF CLAN man they had to be one of the most unorganized guilds i have ever seen in my life....it got very boring for me,,,,,when i asked them that i wanted to leave the guild they triied to pk me but we very wrong i managed to take out 3 of there warriors in 1 round i just rooted them and let them die.<br/>
   The key word is being (((((organized))))) and living up tp guild standards,,,,always help guild members.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways i have blabbed long enough please fill me in on how i can join and what is your plan on getting this guild going<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My character namer is     VENTURA right now i binded myself in UNREST I am making a killing off armour that i get there off dark bones.<br/>
