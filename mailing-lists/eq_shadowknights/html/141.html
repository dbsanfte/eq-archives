<b>Subject:</b> Assasination Quest, please help! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434752574">Hail fellow Shadowknights &lt;cackles etc&gt;, I wonder if you could give me some <br/>
help on a quest ive been stuck on for weeks now. It is obtained in Freeport, <br/>
after completing the quest to kill the messenger from Qeynos, in W commons. <br/>
At first it was a quest to kill Lady Shae and retrive an artifact and give it <br/>
to the guy who set the quest. So i tried this... over and over. She was <br/>
tough, coned yellow and had charm. I notched up 6 to 7 kills on her working <br/>
with groups (died a fair few times too). Mucho effort. She never dropped the <br/>
artifact. I kept at it killing her a futher few times, petitioned at least <br/>
twice and was only told the quest wasnt broken to keep trying she should drop <br/>
it. (kinda ruined the feeling of going and assasinating someone when i have <br/>
to do it 10 time). Through all this im totally ruining my faction with the <br/>
high elves. I mean im taking a BIG faction hit with each kill. Anyuways i <br/>
stopped playing for a while. I came back this week and re did the W commons <br/>
messenger quest. I then found the Shae one had changed. It now says she has <br/>
something called the Bayle List, which she is taking back to qeynos soon. She <br/>
now also cons blue and doesnt have charm - i can easily solo her. So ive <br/>
stuck at it, killing her she still dont drop it, me faction is now ruined <br/>
with high elves. If someone she dont kos asks her about it she says she&#39;d <br/>
&quot;have to be dancing with pink mamoths bfore she talks about antonious Bayle&quot;. <br/>
SOOO i tried getting her drunk with a mule, still no luck. Ive searched her <br/>
room after getting rid of her bodyguard, no list, if anyone has done this <br/>
quest or knows of the Bayle List, PLEEEEEASE help me!!!!<br/>
