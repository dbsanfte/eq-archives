Point well made.  Yet, there is in fact a PvP server with unique rules not <br/>
found on any of the others for PvP ballance.  Ok, I am calm again. Let me <br/>
ask this of you:<br/>
<br/>
How do you know what was intended upon design?<br/>
<br/>
  We ARE ok in player vs monster.  My gripe is that I want ALL of my powers <br/>
to be brought to bear when commanded, that includes the pet.  Duels exist on <br/>
the other servers as well and I have to forget about my signature ability <br/>
while in one.  That is foolish.  Regardless of what was &quot;intended&quot;.  We are <br/>
the only class that cannot use all of our powers all of the time.  How do <br/>
you justify that?<br/>
<br/>
I will not complain again if the pet would just CONTRIBUTE, it makes THAT <br/>
MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE!!  A single interrupt on a wizard, just ONE will allow <br/>
me to flee or even consider fighting her!  Instead it just stands there <br/>
looking silly as I die.  Against a Ranger or Paladin the pet has no <br/>
offensive value BUT, do they know I am an SK if they haven&#39;t seen me?  Will <br/>
they take the time to consider it and realize its green?  In either case, <br/>
opening with the pet puts THE PET in their target window, not me.  I can now <br/>
use Darkness and Fear without expecting a Blindness to get me because I need <br/>
to be trageted first! Suddenly my level 8 pet becomes a true treasure even <br/>
when I am 21st level waiting on the next one.   As it stands, an SK in a <br/>
duel is a foolish SK.<br/>
<br/>
Roleplay IS infact what this game is about.  Teaming up and facing the <br/>
unknown.  There are times though, when the gloves need to come off.  When it <br/>
comes down to true grit and a keen strategy.  It is THEN that we are hurt.<br/>
<br/>
I still love my DE female SK.  If I were stacking stats and not playing a <br/>
role I would always take the Ogre ( not knocking on The Horde or <br/>
anything...heh ).<br/>
<br/>
Hey, wizard DD casting times have dropped.  How does THAT figure into <br/>
roleplay?  If you feel the game is being reduced to hack and slash, you&#39;re <br/>
right.  Bitch at Verant.<br/>
<br/>
When is Microsoft releasing their game?<br/>

&gt;after reading through all of this, I wont comment too much, but one thing I<br/>
&gt;must say.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;when the game was originally planned, it was NOT planned for PvP balance,<br/>
&gt;it was planned for teaming up and player vs montser balance...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;and all of you are only making comparisons of player vs player, SK vs<br/>
&gt;paladin, SK vs warrior, etc etc...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;this is the VERY reason why its not balanced for PvP, because it was NOT<br/>
&gt;originally designed to be as such...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am pissed though that Paladins now get Archery...if the players wanted to<br/>
&gt;be good at it, why not just make a ranger instead? it truelly demoralizes<br/>
&gt;the game into &quot;hack n slash&quot; instead of the &quot;roleplaying&quot; it was meant to<br/>
&gt;be...<br/>

&gt; &gt; All hybrids - paladins, rangers, and SKs - get an xp penalty.  Other <br/>
&gt;than<br/>
&gt; &gt; that, you also get one if you&#39;re non-human.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;     First off for all you scenario makers and hit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; point compareres the the paladin would beat the crap<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; out of an SK. The paladin at level 30 with all his<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; buffs will have around 800hp&#39;s + Lay Hands gives him<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in essence 1600 hit points. Now if the SK uses his<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;mighty&quot; harm touch the paladin is down to 500 hit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; points.  The two skills are VERY unequal.  HT does not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; even com close to LH.  SK&#39;s are not weak but are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; inferior to paladins at this point.  And anyway why<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the heck do us Shadow Knights Get EXP PENALTIES?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Paladins get a BONUS while we get a PENALTY? Why do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the evil classes get the EXP penalties?  All of my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; friends started the same time i did they are level 21<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; i am level 15 because of the EXP and i have played<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; more then them.  The EXP penaltis are stupid as they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; serve no roleplaying service and EQ is a roleplaying game.<br/>
