<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022650014">My main question is how do you calculate damage?<br/>
My Troll is level 13 with a str of 130, and lets<br/>
say he&#39;s using a weapon that has a damage of 16.<br/>
How would you calculate the max damage that can be<br/>
done, or the max damage that weapon can do? Is there<br/>
a way of doing it?<br/>
<br/>
I also am curious what weapon everyone is fighting<br/>
with? Right now, I have a bronze 2h sword, but<br/>
I&#39;m looking for sometype of 2h magical weapon so<br/>
I can start killing wisps and other creatures that<br/>
only take magical attacks. Should I save my money<br/>
to get a Shiny Brass halberd(around 150pp) or <br/>
should I just try to get a fine steel 2h sword<br/>
and wait to get a magical?<br/>
