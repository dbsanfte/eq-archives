<div id="ygrps-yiv-609444559">I agree with you on a good deal of this, however root for a paladin only <br/>
aids them when they flee.  They have not ranged attacks whatsoever and must <br/>
come and face the shadow knight hand to hand to win.  Whereas the <br/>
shadowknight can shoot them with a bow from afar.  While I believe <br/>
shadowknights are the weakest hybrid at the moment if they use hit and <br/>
run(Shadow Step), DoT and archery they can take down the paladin before he <br/>
has a chance to root you and come hand to hand where they will be fairly not <br/>
exactly but fairly equally matched.  And when the root wears off the <br/>
shadowknight can take off with his shadowstep and start shooting the hapless <br/>
servent of good again :&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By the way, an OGRE shadowknight WILL have higher hitpoints than the same <br/>
level paladin of any other race, no questions asked.<br/>

&gt;After Xillith posted the weakness of the Shadow Knights, I would like to<br/>
&gt;address the imbalances of the Shadow Knight class again. Hoping to see a<br/>
&gt;change in this class in every patch, I do not see any upgrade anytime soon.<br/>
&gt;A long time ago, I remember having a debate with someone about Shadow<br/>
&gt;Knights and how they are weak compared to a Paladin. However, they truly<br/>
&gt;believe that the SK are balanced - which is not true. First of all, many<br/>
&gt;other classes, who do not know the SK&#39;s spells, believe that the SK spell<br/>
&gt;list consist of Lifetap, but that is simply not true. &#39;You got Vampiric<br/>
&gt;Embrace&#39; they would retort, but is that a valid point? The answer is &#39;no&#39;.<br/>
&gt;The reason is that VE is an unreliable source of Lifetap. It only goes off<br/>
&gt;periodically (about once every 15 attacks). In addition, it only drains <br/>
&gt;12HP<br/>
&gt;+ (2/2 levels beyond 22). And thus, giving a BIG 20HP drain at level 30<br/>
&gt;every 30 seconds or so. Now, with that aside, I would like to compare the<br/>
&gt;Paladin and the Shadow Knight in a fight. Consider the following:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;30th level Shadow Knight<br/>
&gt;- 301 HT<br/>
&gt;- Engulfing Darkness, Heat Blood, Shadow Step, Siphon Strength, Fear<br/>
&gt;- Full plate with BBC<br/>
&gt;- 755HP<br/>
&gt;- ~650AC<br/>
&gt;- Pet casted<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;30th level Paladin<br/>
&gt;- LH<br/>
&gt;- Stun, Root, Healing<br/>
&gt;- Center and Spirit Armor on<br/>
&gt;- Full plate with BBC<br/>
&gt;- 755+HP<br/>
&gt;- ~650+AC<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As we can see, Paladins will have an HP and AC advantage already. In<br/>
&gt;addition, they get Root and Blind, which they can use strategically to heal<br/>
&gt;themselves during the battle. They can also use the Root/Blind tactic to <br/>
&gt;get<br/>
&gt;free hits or to finish the pet in a few attacks. So, what can a SK do while<br/>
&gt;they are blinded? Nothing. How can a SK hit the Paladin when rooted? The SK<br/>
&gt;cannot. So, let&#39;s ASSUME the SK can get the Paladin down to half health -<br/>
&gt;Will the Paladin need to use LH? The answer is NO, because the HT does not<br/>
&gt;even compensate for half their HP.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Many of you know that Engulfing Darkness and Fear gets resisted more than<br/>
&gt;30% at even fights, higher on yellows and 90% resisted on reds. Now, with<br/>
&gt;the resistable HT, SKs are basically left being a Warrior with faction and<br/>
&gt;exp penalty. While a Paladin can assure safety with LH, HT is completely<br/>
&gt;unreliable and useless. Remember back at level 1, HT used to finish a rat<br/>
&gt;easily? At level 30 or so, 301 damage DOES NOT even put a dent in their HP<br/>
&gt;bar. Note, however, that the damage/level ratio of the HT gets worse and<br/>
&gt;worse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In the end, I believe that Paladins SHOULD be able to defeat a SK in a <br/>
&gt;fight<br/>
&gt;simply because they are there to rid the world of SKs. But having a weak <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;resistable HT, the inability to heal, exp penalty AND bad factions, I<br/>
&gt;believe that Verant should at least give the SK the Lifetap series and a<br/>
&gt;better HT.<br/>
