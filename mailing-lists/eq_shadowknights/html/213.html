<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611181963">so you bought it, eh? or got a friend to get it for you?<br/>
<br/>
to me, it is not the same of going in and obtaining the item yourself,<br/>
truelly earning it and rightuosly owning it...<br/>
<br/>
and if this Xillith would kill her own brethren for valuable items, I would<br/>
consider her a traitor...I say this due to the remark that was said. The<br/>
Indigo Brotherhood will not tolerate kinslayers of any reputation.<br/>

&gt; Excuses me? I DID NOT &#39;tweak&#39; to obtain my Dark Reaver. I worked long and<br/>
&gt; hard for it. Please do not condemn others when they are simply more<br/>
