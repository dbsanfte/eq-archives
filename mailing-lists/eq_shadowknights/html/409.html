    For all I know, the beetle eye quest and the paladin quest are the only <br/>
ones for us in Neriak.  They are important in the aspect that they raise our <br/>
faction with The Dead so that other quests may be acccesed, such as the Ring <br/>
of The Dead quest, ( provides a Gate to Neriak ).  If nothing else, that box <br/>
is a free container to hold 10 beetle eyes.  =)  I want to do the mail <br/>
delivery quest when I hit lvl 30 ( and can invis ) to see the faction hits I <br/>
get.  If quests are your thing make a barbarian, Halas is FULL of quests and <br/>
a few of them are cool and rewarding.  If you are going to do the beetle <br/>
quest, do it now.  Soon you are too high a level to get it from the Necro in <br/>
the Lodge of the Dead.  Be carefull what other quests in Neriak you do, <br/>
ANYTHING that hurts your standing with the dead must be avoided at all <br/>
costs.<br/>
     As far as the team servers go, I will under no circunstances make an SK <br/>
there.  It is rough enough being one on Rallos Zek up untill you aquire <br/>
sufficient power.  The team servers are made for mages and mages only, and <br/>
since the SK is my favorite class I do not see myself going.  I did log in <br/>
as a newbie warrior in Nectulos, discovered 234 other newbies in the zone, <br/>
and returned to my beloved Rallos Zek.  The only TRUE roleplay server, where <br/>
your allies are the ones you make and not the ones you cannot attack.<br/>

&gt;Hello Everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just started a ShadowKnight... level 4 now, but I can&#39;t find many quests<br/>
&gt;for him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I already talked to everyone in my guild house and the NPC&#39;s in the warrior<br/>
&gt;guild, but I didn&#39;t find much. I found the quests to collect beetle eyes..<br/>
&gt;what a waste 1cp for 2gp worth of eyes. I also found a quest to kill a<br/>
&gt;paladin. My faction was not high enough in the warrior guild to get the<br/>
&gt;quests there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any advice? What NPC&#39;s should I talk to? Are there some quests in another<br/>
&gt;section of town?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please share your knowledge my dark brothers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Zaer<br/>
