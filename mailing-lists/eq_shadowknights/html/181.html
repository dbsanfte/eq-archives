<div id="ygrps-yiv-54294418">Hail all,<br/>
<br/>
These will probably be old questions for many of you, but I&#39;m attempting<br/>
that fated journey from Neriak to Qeynos. Any help would be VERY<br/>
appreciated:<br/>
1. about what levels are comfortable in Runny Eye?<br/>
2. is there anything specific about the directions to there from the<br/>
stone wall in Misty Thicket? Someone told me to go west... (a little<br/>
vague?) is that correct?(that&#39;s the farthest I&#39;ve made it so far. NPC<br/>
saw through my invis, and well...)<br/>
3. any details about inside Runnyeye, or what&#39;s past that? I&#39;m assuming<br/>
East Karana&#39;s, or perhaps a bridge first?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your patience.<br/>
A grateful Teir&#39;Dal Shadow Knight,<br/>
