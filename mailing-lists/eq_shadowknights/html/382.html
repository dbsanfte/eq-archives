<div id="ygrps-yiv-840607302">Wouldn&#39;t a fair trade be (since I think SKs are &#39;balanced&#39; except for pets) <br/>
be trade in pets for lifetap series?  Brad is always talking about how <br/>
hybrids are better at soloing...I mean we have an exp penalty for something <br/>
right?  Right now we are as diverse as a warrior, we can do very little <br/>
except fight/cause damage.  Rangers and paladins can root, heal, rangers can <br/>
track and have damage shield and agility buffs.  Shadowknights don&#39;t have <br/>
the diversity their exp penalty should grant.  Lifespike (10 dmg) should be <br/>
a lvl 9 spell, vampiric embrace moves to 15 and then the level 12 necro <br/>
lifetap is at 22....sound fair? I like it.  As of the moment just getting <br/>
the lifetap series would be too powerful...and I&#39;d trade ol Gebeker in any <br/>
day for a way to heal myself.  Pets half our level end up attracting <br/>
monsters WE have to fight and kill, and then we have to heal off the damage <br/>
and they really end up causing a lot of unnecessary downtime.  Besides I <br/>
think the shadowknight, paladin of evil, should have a more solo image, he&#39;s <br/>
supposed to be a mirror image of a paladin...so where did this gimpy <br/>
skeleton come from?<br/>
Just my thoughts.</div>
