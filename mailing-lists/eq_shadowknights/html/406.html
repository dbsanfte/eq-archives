<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-341317995">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I just started a ShadowKnight... level 4 now, but I can&#39;t find many quests<br/>
for him. <br/>
<br/>
I already talked to everyone in my guild house and the NPC&#39;s in the warrior<br/>
guild, but I didn&#39;t find much. I found the quests to collect beetle eyes..<br/>
what a waste 1cp for 2gp worth of eyes. I also found a quest to kill a<br/>
paladin. My faction was not high enough in the warrior guild to get the<br/>
quests there.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice? What NPC&#39;s should I talk to? Are there some quests in another<br/>
section of town?<br/>
<br/>
Please share your knowledge my dark brothers.<br/>
