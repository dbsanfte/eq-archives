<div id="ygrps-yiv-494371783">Verant has not changed anything in regards to fletching supplies in the<br/>
&quot;evil&quot; lands.  You still cannot buy ALL of the components you need in<br/>
Neriak, Oggok or Grobb.  You will have to either develop contacts who can go<br/>
into town to buy you what you need or you sit around with a wasted skill.<br/>
There is supposedly a centaur merchant, who tolerates Teir&#39;Dal, in a centaur<br/>
village in the Karanas.  I would not venture there until you are around 15th<br/>
Level or have a strong party to travel with.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a shop outside of Oggok that sells bowyering components but I<br/>
have yet to locate it.  I have a friend who dumped 20 training points into<br/>
fletching and decided to forego crafting arrows altogether and went straight<br/>
to bows.  It is expensive but it is all we can realistically do for now.  My<br/>
suggestion is, if you have your heart set on being a fletching SK, you<br/>
select a human to play as so you have access to the components (provided the<br/>
human merchants even sell to you)...<br/>

&gt; Ok, way back I knew there was a big stink because it seemed no evil race<br/>
&gt; could fletch. I was wondering if by any chance this has been changed? I am<br/>
&gt; making a DE SK and I REALLY want to take up archery with him. Archery for<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; is one of the main reasons I am choosing SK&#39;s. Can someone please please<br/>
&gt; please please tell me that verant fixed this oversight and there is now a<br/>
&gt; place to buy fletching materials? I logged on and checked that one place<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; neriak and that place is a joke; it only sells nocks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So is it possible  to buy materials not in Kelethin or surefall? Does<br/>
maybe<br/>
&gt; Grobb or Oggok have the rest pf the materials? And if it isnt possible<br/>
maybe<br/>
&gt; all SK&#39;s should feedback this as it essentially makes one of our skills<br/>
&gt; useless.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>
