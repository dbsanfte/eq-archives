&gt; Hail dark bretheren,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     For all I know, the beetle eye quest and the paladin quest are the only<br/>
&gt; ones for us in Neriak.  They are important in the aspect that they raise our<br/>
&gt; faction with The Dead so that other quests may be acccesed, such as the Ring<br/>
&gt; of The Dead quest, ( provides a Gate to Neriak ).  If nothing else, that box<br/>
&gt; is a free container to hold 10 beetle eyes.  =)  I want to do the mail<br/>
&gt; delivery quest when I hit lvl 30 ( and can invis ) to see the faction hits I<br/>
&gt; get.  If quests are your thing make a barbarian, Halas is FULL of quests and<br/>
&gt; a few of them are cool and rewarding.  If you are going to do the beetle<br/>
&gt; quest, do it now.  Soon you are too high a level to get it from the Necro in<br/>
&gt; the Lodge of the Dead.  Be carefull what other quests in Neriak you do,<br/>
&gt; ANYTHING that hurts your standing with the dead must be avoided at all<br/>
&gt; costs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You cannot do the courier quests at that level.  Even in the twenties,<br/>
when<br/>
I ask &quot;Do you have any messages for Neriak?&quot; They say I am wasting my<br/>
time<br/>
and that I am too powerful.  Another good quest city is Oggok, which has<br/>
many<br/>
nice newbie quests, but I&#39;m not sure of the higher level ones.<br/>
