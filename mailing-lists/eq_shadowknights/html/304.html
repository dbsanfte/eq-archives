<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744137284">Taking the view of a SK being an anti-paladin, I asked for a review on the<br/>
SK balance regarding Harm Touch vs. the paladin&#39;s Heal. For both classes,<br/>
how about harming / healing the total of their unaltered life force (hit<br/>
points total) ? As an alternative, consider simply slaying outright / fully<br/>
healing (or within 1-10%) their level or below, and for their level or<br/>
higher no more than their unaltered hit point max. I added to both<br/>
suggestions that neither should be resisted, or both should have equal<br/>
chance by level for failure as this is a &#39;divine gift&#39; (IMHO).<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the chance for failure would be related to faction. that might make<br/>
for nice role-playing ;-), e.g..: Been whacking a lot of evil crits getting<br/>
your faction up to walk into town ? Hmmm might not be favourable to the<br/>
ghods and your deadly touch might fail at a critical time. Same with Heal<br/>
for paladins, and perhaps even more so because of their goodie-goodie<br/>
ethics; whack a bunch of innocents for some item and, whoops, dang heal<br/>
fizzled, &#39;Rodcet Nife has frowned on you&#39; - hehehe.<br/>
