<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616556765">do not worry about faction with high elves, wood elves, dwarves...<br/>
<br/>
ive seen many of these races attack me on sight, due to me being an SK, or<br/>
it was the fact I was a servant of Innoruuk, a freeport SK...<br/>
<br/>
even if there are those who dont attack you, why should you worry? we are<br/>
evil, right? they are good, right? nuff said...<br/>
