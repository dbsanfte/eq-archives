<div id="ygrps-yiv-40181684">Nope, but there is an Opal Scythe on Lord Grimrot in S karanas. This is a <br/>
magic SK and Warrior only 2 handed weapon. I&#39;ve heard Lord Grim is about <br/>
level 20-25ish and was going to take a party out to take him down this <br/>
morning. I&#39;ll tell you how it goes, but if any of you have had experience <br/>
with him yourself  please mail me!</div>
