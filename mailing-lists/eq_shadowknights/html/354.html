<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015493374">As much as I like to have my character forever, I know I will have to quit<br/>
one day. So, I&#39;ve been taking screenshots of my character&#39;s developement. As<br/>
most of you know, I always strive to be coolest looking Shadow Knight<br/>
around. Thus, I arrange my armor to be the most fashionable as possible,<br/>
despite the less AC. To make a long story short, I would like to see other<br/>
Dark Elf SKs in action or posing (don&#39;t really want to see Ogres and Trolls<br/>
because they are not as awesome-looking). If you got a cool, spiffy<br/>
screenshot of your SK in .jpg format, please send it my way at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:howard.chan@...">howard.chan@...</a> . Btw, did I mention that we need the lifetap series?<br/>
hehe</div>
