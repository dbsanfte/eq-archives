<div id="ygrps-yiv-494010960">On #3, yes, your body will still be there.  I was in the butcherblok mountains on Faydwer and got offed.  It was a long trip so I just signed off for the evening.  The next night, I made the trip and my body was still there.  I have died under water but never found the body.  I didn&#39;t look to hard because the water was deep and I didn&#39;t feel like being fish food.<br/>

I have some questions about dying:<br/>
<br/>
1) If you die in water can you still loot your corpse?<br/>
<br/>
2) How long will your corpse stay in the game after<br/>
you die?<br/>
<br/>
3)  Will your corpse remain in the game after you sign<br/>
off, and if so for how long?<br/>
<br/>
If anyone could answer these questions I would greatly<br/>
apreciate you responding.<br/>
