all goes well, either post on this board the stats, or if you dont think<br/>
you should and noone else wants to know the stats, then just email it to me<br/>
what the stats are and what it does, if any abilities.<br/>

I can probably get a group myself to take him out...<br/>
just last night, me, another SK one level ahead of me, a shaman, and a<br/>
necro took out a Cyclops....it was a vicious battle, but we won...I was lvl<br/>
19, the necro lvl 23 or 24, both the shaman and the other SK were 20...and<br/>

&gt; Nope, but there is an Opal Scythe on Lord Grimrot in S karanas. This is a<br/>
<br/>
&gt; magic SK and Warrior only 2 handed weapon. I&#39;ve heard Lord Grim is about <br/>
&gt; level 20-25ish and was going to take a party out to take him down this <br/>
&gt; morning. I&#39;ll tell you how it goes, but if any of you have had experience<br/>
<br/>
&gt; with him yourself  please mail me!<br/>
