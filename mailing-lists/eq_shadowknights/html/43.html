<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714881660">I have played as an SK during the beta, back then I used an Ogre.<br/>
And now I am still an SK during commercial, although this time I chose<br/>
human.<br/>
<br/>
my first discussion is of our pet. we are the only hybrid class that gets<br/>
one, and in that essence, gives us certain circumstances in that we can<br/>
survive or delay our retreat where as the other fighters and hybrids could<br/>
not. Although our pet is only half the level we are, it still does damage,<br/>
so as long as you&#39;re the tank. The pet has saved me numerous times, once<br/>
being a griffin flew overhead, and I was able to retreat due to my pet.<br/>
another incident, I was in a battle vs a fire drake, another flew by,<br/>
because it was chasing someone, the pet bought me time to kill the first<br/>
drake, and I was able to fend of the 2nd drake...and then a 3rd comes<br/>
hovering by, and again, after the second drake was defeated, with low<br/>
health, the pet bought me enough seconds to retreat to the zone.<br/>
<br/>
our spells, although very weak by the time we get them, do have some value.<br/>
I find clinging darkness to be very useful against enemies that are in<br/>
retreat. mend bones is a useful 15th spell that allows us to heal our pets<br/>
when needed, and so that we may continue to hunt and battle, without having<br/>
to await its healing. my friends, although we deem ourselves weak compared<br/>
to our nemesis, we must try to see the potentials and values that our<br/>
&quot;weak&quot; spells give to us, find the weaknesses and the strengths will make<br/>
us more formidable. <br/>
<br/>
One thing I see though as another imbalance, is the fact, that Rangers,<br/>
another hybrid that is our nemesis, has both abilities to double attack and<br/>
dual wield, while the paladin and SK only get double attack. This makes<br/>
Rangers out to be one of the best classes around, the ability to track, the<br/>
fighting abilities of a warrior, and the few healing and buff spells he can<br/>
muster, makes this hybrid seem on top of the other two.<br/>
<br/>
another thing noticeable about SKs, is their lack of defense...while our<br/>
offense is just as great as any other fighter in the beginning, we lack AC.<br/>
I heard of spellcasters having better AC than I before their buffs. this<br/>
was at the beginning however, but after laying on enough armor, I havent<br/>
noticed much, although I havent asked around much either whether or not the<br/>
AC can be in comparison.<br/>
<br/>
well, to enlighten on our bad news, I got in an Arena fight not too long<br/>
ago, against a Bard.<br/>
I was at lvl 17, him lvl 16. but, I was in full leather armor with the<br/>
exception of guard bracers and a studded skullcap, while he was in fully,<br/>
it was either banded or ringmail, one of the two. I carried the infamous<br/>
Halberd, while in his possesion was a mino battle axe and a kite shield. we<br/>
fought with what abilities we had, but he did give the mistake of letting<br/>
me make my pet before the combat begin. I believe that I didnt lose more<br/>
than one bubble of health, while he was nearly devoureded by my raw powers.<br/>
and yes, HT was on hand for this fight. I let him live (actually he left<br/>
the arena) with little health left, and we departed, I knew I had won, and<br/>
yet, so easily.<br/>
<br/>
I do hope that something is done in our favor, but we must remember, Verant<br/>
didnt make this game, didnt balance the classes, for duels and pvp<br/>
fighting, they more or less balanced it through the creatures we slay, and<br/>
who has the easier or rougher time doing it.<br/>
