<b>Subject:</b> Pet issue <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448704472">Hey Xillith,<br/>
<br/>
With regard to the pet issue, I saw the same thing in dueling as my SK back<br/>
in my CandyLand days on Veeshan. Now, every once in a while on Zek, as a<br/>
Necromancer, I see the same thing, so its not just a SK issue. I&#39;m not sure<br/>
whether its a bug, but I&#39;ve also heard that pets will sometimes be less than<br/>
willing to attack something that cons red to them. My latest experience with<br/>
this was with Codil the Naked Monk outside Freeport. He was only yellow to<br/>
me, and I&#39;d have taken him down, had my pet felt compelled to join me rather<br/>
than the other spectators. However, like you said, PvP is the only instance<br/>
in which I&#39;ve seen this happen, never during combat with an NPC, which leads<br/>
me to believe it&#39;s another one of Verant&#39;s little oversights.<br/>
<br/>
So if they did not intend pets to be used in PvP, they certainly need to<br/>
change some code, at least on Zek. If we can summon a pet, we should have<br/>
complete control over it and it should attack anything we direct it to,<br/>
whether that something is a Large Rat or a Hill Giant.<br/>
