<div id="ygrps-yiv-173225348">Errrr! Hehe. It is NOT possible to tank a spectre unless you have a cleric<br/>
in the group. One probable reason that you survived the spectre at level 19<br/>
was maybe the spectre was Ensnared, Darknessed or busy killing other victims<br/>
near you (that has saved me countless times before).<br/>
Okay, I might have exaggerated the part about the inability to tank a<br/>
spectre. You COULD tank a spectre in a party (assuming you have a really<br/>
good group), but you will be left with low health which is undesirable in a<br/>
party. The best strategy (even with a good group) is to run the spectre<br/>
around and allow your DoT to take it&#39;s effects and renew it until you are<br/>
out of mana. Then, and only then, should you engage into melee.<br/>

&gt;who would want to solo a Spectre, thats why there are other people in your<br/>
&gt;party. I was attacked by a Spectre at level 19 and lived to zone, was a<br/>
&gt;pillar 2.  Our spells help us a lot, but we are mostly tanks with mana bars<br/>
&gt;and pets, at least with my experiences. </span></blockquote></div>
