&gt; &gt;if you were level 40 with the dark reaver, THE LEVEL YOU SHOULD BE! then<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt;would be doing damage in the high 100s.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Probably not high 100s for a dark elf.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Wow! I have never seen anyone doing over 100 before. Hmm, I must be blinded<br/>
&gt;when I see high 30 Rangers doing 17 with their Demon Claws.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Demon Claws have a base damage of 5, and they are a little low level for <br/>
level 30 rangers.<br/>
<br/>
And I must also<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;be mistaken when I see a level 40+ doing an average of 60 with the Reaver.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thats a pretty damn bad level 40+ person there.  Probably a dark elf :P<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But that is okay, because they could be doing high 100s in your own world.<br/>
&gt;High 100s, eh? Why not 9999 damage as seen in Final Fantasy games?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, sorry, I thought this was final-fantasyquest XVI<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I would like to quote you on something, &quot;I know that a level 20 warrior <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;the executioners axe can do 100 damage&quot;. First, you condemn me for having<br/>
&gt;the Dark Reaver at my level, then you go on to state that a level **20**<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, I am not saying I agree with this guys having the weapon, or admire his <br/>
ability to somehow buy the executioners axe.  Just that I have seen it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;WITH an **Executioner&#39;s Axe** can do **over 100**??  . . . I am not sure<br/>
&gt;myself, but I think I see something wrong with that. Quite obviously, you<br/>
&gt;are UNCERTAIN of your position of your argument. In addition, you give<br/>
&gt;evidence that is completely FALSE. A level 20 with an Executioner&#39;s Axe, is<br/>
&gt;a &#39;cheap bastard&#39; as you would have called it, because there is no way he<br/>
&gt;could have obtained it himself (unless he bought it). Also, I have yet to<br/>
&gt;see a level 40+ with an Executioner&#39;s Axe that can do over 80; stating <br/>
&gt;&#39;over<br/>
&gt;100&#39; at level 20 already proves that you are pulling numbers out of a hat.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you ever fought the guards in freeport?  The captain that is?  He is <br/>
around level 40 and a warrior, he KICKS for 120 damage.  Now npcs warriors <br/>
like that have around the same stats as pc characters of he same level.  <br/>
Just goes to show your ineptitude.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It is very interesting to see how people react to others who get higher<br/>
&gt;level equipment. Those people believe that unless you camped for the item,<br/>
&gt;you are not allowed to use it even if you have enough money to afford it.<br/>
&gt;Perhaps when you have collected enough snake fangs to get your Mino Axe, I<br/>
&gt;should call you a &#39;cheap bastard&#39; and condemn you for having equipment that<br/>
&gt;is out of your league. Just like what you did to me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t use 1h slashing :P<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Think about the following: IF I was a level 1 walking in Full Plate, why<br/>
&gt;would you care??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I have seen it happen, and I despise the people that do it. But only <br/>
twinkers, not people that have equipment given to them by someone who is <br/>
leaving the game or something.<br/>
<br/>
So, what if I have an advantage over you - does that affect<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;your game play in any way? Or is it that you are so jealous of my <br/>
&gt;equipment,<br/>
&gt;that you must condemn me for what I have?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Level 1 Shadow Knight who is surviving 70 damage blows from spectres.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just to clear things up why don&#39;t you give your level, strength and 2h <br/>
slashing skill?<br/>
<br/>

game due to playing it since december in phase 3.<br/>
