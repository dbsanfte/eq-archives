<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977880693">Of course 800 damage would be insanely powerful. Take into consideration,<br/>
however, that Wizards at level 49 can deal 1600 damage with one spell. Even<br/>
if we (SKs) did 800 damage, it&#39;s only once a day. Note though, that we need<br/>
to be level 80 to do 800 points of damage. Level 50 mobs are going to have<br/>
WAY more than 800HP. Thus, we can&#39;t kill it with our HT even if it was down<br/>
to half of it&#39;s HP. I agree with you completely that our pets are good; I<br/>
have no doubt in that, and nothing needs to be changed about them. However,<br/>
please name me a Lifetap spell that we get. Vampiric Embrace seems to be the<br/>
only one that comes to my mind. Though, last time I checked, it is useless.<br/>
Have you played any other classes other than the Shadow Knight? Try to play<br/>
a few others up to level 15 and you will see that the Shadow Knights are<br/>
lacking.<br/>
<br/>
About the analogy that you gave about the Paladin fighting the Shadow<br/>
Knight - our HT is NOT going to take out half of his life. If you do not<br/>
believe me that the LH is better than HT, let me put it into a mathematical<br/>
prove in which it shows the slope of the power of HT versus HP. The slope<br/>
will then define why HT is inferior to LH:<br/>
<br/>
Let x equal the level of the character, as a character gain 25HP per level,<br/>
we have a equation for the HP of a Paladin:<br/>
<br/>
25x<br/>
<br/>
Now, the formula of the HT can easily be derived from trail and error or<br/>
whatever it may be. Nevertheless, the formula for the HT is:<br/>
<br/>
x*10+1<br/>
<br/>
Now, differentiate both equations to get the slope at every point. Thus, the<br/>
slope of the HP gain for the Paladin is 25 while the slope of the HT is 10.<br/>
Now, we see that the HP of the paladin grows 2.5 times faster than the HT.<br/>
From this simple derivation, one sees that the HT will, in fact, have no way<br/>
of doing 50% damage. It might do 50% damage if and only if the paladin is at<br/>
level 1. After that, the percentage of HP taken by the HT will decrease. In<br/>
addition, they get buffs and healing spells such that the SK is NOT going to<br/>
take half of the Paladin&#39;s HP when the Paladin has taken out half of our HP.<br/>
<br/>
In conclusion, our pets are good. But Paladins doesn&#39;t have to sit 30<br/>
minutes to heal after every fight. In addition, their LH is PROVEN to be<br/>
better than HT. Also, they get buffs when we get strength stealing spells<br/>
that causes no difference in a fight. And Verant DID not do a good job at<br/>
balancing the classes because they rushed EQ at the end. In fact, one would<br/>
see the result of this by simply looking at the info of Leering Corpse. It<br/>
states that we CANNOT use the spell at level 9, yet, I was able to use it.<br/>
Now, please provide a mathematical prove that the LH is better than the HT.<br/>
I would really like to see how we have an &#39;advantage&#39; with our HT.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You have to understand that a magic attack that did 800 damage would<br/>
&gt;be insanely powerful.  Ok, lets just say that paladins and<br/>
&gt;shadowknights are evenly matched fighting hth, you both injure each<br/>
&gt;other down to 1/2 hp.  Probably not enough to warrant the paladins<br/>
&gt;Lay Hands.... but then you harm touch him finishing off his remaining<br/>
&gt;hps, dropping him dead to the ground.  THAT is the benefit of our<br/>
&gt;ability.  Now, our spells may not be the greatest at first, but later<br/>
&gt;on they start becoming MUCH better.   For example our DoT spells, and<br/>
&gt;lifedrain spells can be VERY helpful.  Our pets aren&#39;t meant to kill<br/>
&gt;the enemy, but be more of a DoT thing, they stand there inflicting<br/>
&gt;extra damage on the enemy as you fight them as well.  Things in EQ<br/>
&gt;are actually quite well balanced, and I commend verant on a job well<br/>
