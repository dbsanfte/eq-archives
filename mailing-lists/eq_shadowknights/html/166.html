&gt; Blackened armor can be obtained at Runnyeye. At level 10, I had full<br/>
banded<br/>
<br/>
Where is Runnyeye?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; armor except for the cape and helm. The helm I had was steel plate and the<br/>
&gt; cape was leather. Then I decided that the plate helm looked ugly and sold<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; to purchase blackened armor (tunic, pants, belt, crown, bracer, sleeves,<br/>
&gt; glove). The blackened armor would be the best equipment in terms of<br/>
coolness<br/>
&gt; and AC. But when you reach a higher level, you would then be obligated to<br/>
&gt; switch back to banded (because the blackened is heavy and the loot you<br/>
start<br/>
&gt; getting becomes heavier also) or bronze for the AC.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the tips, the board was slow for a while, good to see posts.<br/>
