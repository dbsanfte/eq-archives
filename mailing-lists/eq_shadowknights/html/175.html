<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819435207">Does anyone know of any magic weapons you can loot off some creature?  I<br/>
have run in to some major problems.  For some reason I don&#39;t seem to have<br/>
more than 10pp in the bank.  I do have a complete set of leather armor that<br/>
isn&#39;t protecting me as well as it has been.  Anyway, I need banded armor and<br/>
figure the best way to make cash is hunting in fire storm, but the earth<br/>
elemental I have to train back to the zone because I can&#39;t hurt them (oh, ya<br/>
the disease cloud spell really works well).  Any thoughts or suggestions<br/>
would be helpful. Because the only option I see is to go back and kill about<br/>
400 fire beetles, which would really decimate the area in Neriak for the<br/>
lower level people (unless they turn frenzy on again). I don&#39;t want to do<br/>
this, but if I did I would purchase 5 more backpacks and then start hunting.<br/>
I did go up against a cutthroat yesterday and it about killed me (I will<br/>
admit it con even).  I had about 20 hp left and yes I found harm touch was<br/>
resisted a bit, it only did 73pts damage against it (out of 140 it should<br/>
have done, which would have killed it).  OH, I am using a FS 2h sword, and I<br/>
have kept my 1h slash skill up.  So any type of weapon would work, I am<br/>
willing to work on blunt or puncture.  (and I don&#39;t like hunting in e-comm<br/>
because of griffin KOS attitude)<br/>
<br/>
Also, does anyone know someone selling small banded in Neriak/Freeport area<br/>
on the Tarew Marr server? And what are the prices?<br/>
<br/>
Again, any thoughts, suggestions or ideas would be appreciated.<br/>
