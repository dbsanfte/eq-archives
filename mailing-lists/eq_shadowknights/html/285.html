<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145220435">well....in asking to leave, and them just wanting to kill you for<br/>
it....that puts em on my KOS list...truelly a guild with no respect for one<br/>
another...and it is good you left, for such a guild is not worth being a<br/>
part of.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    We help out the new members by helping them level to upper levels as<br/>
soon as possible,,,,i was once in a very bad guild called   WOLF CLAN man<br/>
they had to be one of the most unorganized guilds i have ever seen in my<br/>
life....it got very boring for me,,,,,when i asked them that i wanted to<br/>
leave the guild they triied to pk me but we very wrong i managed to take<br/>
out 3 of there warriors in 1 round i just rooted them and let them die.</div>
