<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-381855565">Evil Guilds<br/>
<br/>
Darkenbane controls the ogres and trolls<br/>
Numerous Dark Elven guilds are about<br/>
<br/>
all of these guilds, however, are near freeport, the eastern part of the<br/>
continent, or sometimes they travel in the middle, such as the Karanas<br/>
perhaps. <br/>
<br/>
But their is none on the western side of the continent, to strike true fear<br/>
upon the many druids, rangers, barbarians, and erudites among this area.<br/>
The few that exist in this area, are but mere kinslayers (also referred to<br/>
as newbie killers), the antics of the Knights Of Terror, and a few of the<br/>
Covetous Crew that wander around...<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping, perhaps one day, that one such would come to strike true<br/>
fear. But more or less I was thinking, of Humans and Erudites to do this.<br/>
What I had in mind, a followers of the Plaguebringer. Necromancers, Knights<br/>
of the shadows, Enchanters, Dark Clerics, Murderous Warriors, Wizards and<br/>
Mages, all whom follow the Plaguebringer, to form an alliance. Perhaps this<br/>
could be the player side of the Bloodsabers. I was also thinking of letting<br/>
the Erudite Necromancers to be a part of this as well, since they are far<br/>
from evil civilization, and it is difficult for them to travel alone. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a great intro for this guild, would be to group up and go into BB,<br/>
destroy everyone they encounter in the hills along the way, and massacre<br/>
everything within BB.<br/>
<br/>
I know many of you would not be willing to give up your already developed<br/>
characters on the splendid server of Zek, nor perhaps if you have one on<br/>
another server, but this was just an idea I had in mind. Hoping one day it<br/>
can come to be...<br/>
