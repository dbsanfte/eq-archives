<b>Subject:</b> LOOK AT THIS VERY IMPORTANT SERIOUS <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369122478">Hello. I am sure many of you other shadow knights<br/>
have thought of this but we must take action about<br/>
this subject: Shadow Knights NEED invisibility at<br/>
earlier levels.  They DO get the spell but at level<br/>
30. I think they should get it at level 22 because of<br/>
two main reasons. 1) We are hybrids so we already have<br/>
some EXP penalties and we can&#39;t get to three quarters<br/>
of the hunting grounds so are forced to hunt in the<br/>
area around our home city until level 30.  2) At level<br/>
2 we get the spells that necro&#39;s get at levek 8 EXCEPT<br/>
for the invisibility spell. All of us Shadow Knights<br/>
should join in and petition for invisibility at level<br/>
22! We can get them to change it. Feel free to drop me<br/>
a line if you are on fenin ro<br/>
<br/>
Fizal, Fenin Ro<br/>
