<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-610681669">Let me know if this comes to fruition.<br/>
As we on RZ advance in level and are able to travel more readily, having an<br/>
alliance between the guild you propose in the east, and Darkenbane, Blood<br/>
Coven, et.al. in the west, would be a force to be reckoned with, indeed.:)<br/>
Should my own guild idea come to be, I&#39;d be more than interested.<br/>

&gt; Evil Guilds<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Darkenbane controls the ogres and trolls<br/>
&gt; Numerous Dark Elven guilds are about<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; all of these guilds, however, are near freeport, the eastern part of the<br/>
&gt; continent, or sometimes they travel in the middle, such as the Karanas<br/>
&gt; perhaps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But their is none on the western side of the continent, to strike true<br/>
fear<br/>
&gt; upon the many druids, rangers, barbarians, and erudites among this area.<br/>
&gt; The few that exist in this area, are but mere kinslayers (also referred to<br/>
&gt; as newbie killers), the antics of the Knights Of Terror, and a few of the<br/>
&gt; Covetous Crew that wander around...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was hoping, perhaps one day, that one such would come to strike true<br/>
&gt; fear. But more or less I was thinking, of Humans and Erudites to do this.<br/>
&gt; What I had in mind, a followers of the Plaguebringer. Necromancers,<br/>
Knights<br/>
&gt; of the shadows, Enchanters, Dark Clerics, Murderous Warriors, Wizards and<br/>
&gt; Mages, all whom follow the Plaguebringer, to form an alliance. Perhaps<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; could be the player side of the Bloodsabers. I was also thinking of<br/>
letting<br/>
&gt; the Erudite Necromancers to be a part of this as well, since they are far<br/>
&gt; from evil civilization, and it is difficult for them to travel alone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps a great intro for this guild, would be to group up and go into BB,<br/>
&gt; destroy everyone they encounter in the hills along the way, and massacre<br/>
&gt; everything within BB.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know many of you would not be willing to give up your already developed<br/>
&gt; characters on the splendid server of Zek, nor perhaps if you have one on<br/>
&gt; another server, but this was just an idea I had in mind. Hoping one day it<br/>
&gt; can come to be...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Redemptor<br/>
&gt; Bloodsaber of Qeynos<br/>
