<div id="ygrps-yiv-981602411">Too bad the Reaper of the Dead is only achieved via a Dark Elf quest.  It is <br/>
a scithe with 14dmg 40spd +4str and one charge of Complete Healing (yep, an <br/>
SK Lay Hands)and LORE.  Any SK can use it, you just need to be a DE to do <br/>
the quest.  Eventually you get the Ring of the Dead but it is DE only as <br/>
well.  The Reaper sells to merchants for about 10plat, so you get a nice <br/>
return before you do the quest again and this is a great quest for gaining <br/>
faction with The Dead of Neriak.<br/>

&gt;BTW, the Pestilence Scythe is a magic, lore, no drop item found on Lord <br/>
&gt;Grimrot, who stands in the ruins immediately south of the white bridge in <br/>
&gt;South Karana. He&#39;s a level 35 SK that is a lot tougher than he seems, and <br/>
&gt;if you kill him OR any of the putrid skeletons guarding him your factions <br/>
&gt;drop with the Bloodsabers and go up with Qeynos guards, etc. The <br/>
&gt;Bloodsabers are the human SK guild in Qeynos who worship Bertoxxulous.<br/>
&gt;Stats on the scythe are as follows. 16 dmg, 48 dlay, +10 poison and disease <br/>
&gt;save, and has one charge for Vampiric Curse. I wasn&#39;t able to see the exact <br/>
&gt;effects of this spell, so I&#39;m fairly anxious to figure out how to recharge <br/>
&gt;it. If it can be recharged, that is. It can be used by warriors, SK&#39;s, and <br/>
&gt;necromancers (although I think it should be SK and necro only!) I got this <br/>
&gt;scythe for the look of my character, and for the storyline we have. Sure <br/>
&gt;there&#39;s better weapons.. but until there&#39;s a better scythe this is what <br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll be using. =)<br/>
