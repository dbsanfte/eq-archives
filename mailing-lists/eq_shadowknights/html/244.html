NPCs hit for MORE than anyone at their level. Why does Dark Elf Corporals<br/>
con green to me, yet, they would hit someone of my level for over 70 damage?<br/>
And when someone kills the Corporal, they drop a bronze weapon?<br/>
<br/>
Now, to the contents of your post:<br/>
<br/>
You said, &quot;Thats a pretty damn bad level 40+ person there.  Probably a dark<br/>
elf :P&quot;. Yes, it is a Dark Elf, but our str DOES NOT add 100 damage to our<br/>
hits. It was interesting to hear you say, &quot;Just goes to show your<br/>
ineptitude&quot;. Actually, you are the one that is wrong. NPCs DO NOT have the<br/>
same stats we have.<br/>
<br/>
About your claim upon seeing a level 20 doing 100 damage is, to put it<br/>
bluntly, a lie.<br/>
<br/>
You seem to have an inexhaustible list of untrue facts. I will respond to<br/>
your<br/>
latest post, but please do not give any more arguments until you have<br/>
evidence that what you have said is true. When that time comes, I will<br/>
gladly take back my words - if what you say is indeed accurate (but alas,<br/>
they won&#39;t be).<br/>
<br/>
PS - I would like to say that I love your calculations. A level 20 would<br/>
have a 4x multiplier to the weapon attack value (i.e.. &quot;a level 20 warrior<br/>
with the executioners axe can do 100 damage, 4 x 25&quot;), but a level 30 ranger<br/>
is okay to have a 3x multiplier with a Demon Claw . . . And I had a laugh<br/>
when you said that Demon Claws are low level for Rangers simply because they<br/>
have a attack of 5 - that absolutely demonstrates your knowledge in weapons.</div>
