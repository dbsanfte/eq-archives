(Why are there two lists when one would<br/>
better?)<br/>
<br/>
I just started a Dark Elf Shadow Knight on the Test server.  Long story short, my system freezes on Veehsan and test has a much lower head count.<br/>
<br/>
I have questions about newbie fodder.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen one skeleton pet, but don&#39;t think<br/>
that should be my first target.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen the 3 ghouls, and one that parades<br/>
around The Lodge of the Dead, are these<br/>
the equivilent of rats, bats and snakes in Freeport?<br/>
