Combine Two Handed Swords cannot be purchased by Dark Elves. Because the<br/>
vendors that sell them do not like us. However, a Shiny Brass Halberd is<br/>
already better than a Combine Two Handed Sword, so there is no need for you<br/>
to get a Combine.<br/>
<br/>
When you are level 20 or higher, you will see yourself doing more damage<br/>
with your Halberd. However, if you are above 20, I suggest you go to<br/>
Befallen and camp for the Bone-Bladed Claymore (which could be put into a<br/>
bag).<br/>
<br/>
Rune Totem Staves can be obtained easily at Gnoll Shamans at Lake Rathe, you<br/>
can also get small bronze armor off of Dry Bone Skeletons at the same place<br/>
too.<br/>

Some players could have easily gotten you a Fine Steel weapon for 5pp. Right<br/>
now, however, I think you should start saving up for banded armor. After you<br/>
have a full suit of it, a BBC (200pp) should be your next goal. When you<br/>
have reached mid 20s, you should go to Najena to collect large bronze pieces<br/>
off of Ogre captains. At high 20s, you should go camp for the Journeyman<br/>
Boots that is also in Najena (Jboots are not tradable; therefore, you must<br/>
loot it yourself).</div>
