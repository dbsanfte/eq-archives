<b>Subject:</b> Lord Grimrot <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-529193902">He is a very high level shadowknight, able to cut down characters in the<br/>
20&#39;s with a few blows.  I have not personally seen him, but everyone tells<br/>
me he spawns in the skeleton field just south of the noth to south karana<br/>
bridge.  Whether or not Grimrot is hostile to sk&#39;s remains to be seen.  I<br/>
personally think he is friendly to human sk&#39;s at least, becuase I have been<br/>
given a quest to deliver a dwarven skull to him so that he may create an<br/>
undead warrior.  I have visited the field many times, but still have not<br/>
seen him.  If anyone knows if the spawn is triggered by an event please<br/>
reply.</div>
