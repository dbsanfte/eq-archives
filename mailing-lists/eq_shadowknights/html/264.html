<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906458367">I used to play on Mithaniel Marr.  Then I tried a SK on Zek, and there&#39;s no<br/>
way I&#39;d go back to any other server.  Zek is the only place to be a SK.<br/>

&gt; Hail!  Well met my brothers and sisters of hate and malice!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What I would like to see is the stats on studded or reinforced leather.  I<br/>
&gt; realize that banded is likely better, but when in the SKs life is such<br/>
&gt; equipment warrented?  I am 19th and I have a suit of ringmail I collected<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; High Hold, very heavy.  Tailoring is advancing slowly as hunting or ruined<br/>
&gt; pelts at my level is monotonous.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I might sacrifice the ringmail for reinforced leather if the weight/cost<br/>
&gt; factor suits me.  Then again, DE females look FANTASTIC in  ringmail<br/>
armour,<br/>
&gt; and good fashion is severely lacking in this game.  So, anyone who is<br/>
&gt; wearing the advanced leathers please tell me the stats and what they look<br/>
&gt; like equipped on a DE female.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On another note.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In response to earlier posts, I am no traitor to the Tier&#39;Dal.  Although<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; Rallos Zek, the mighty rule the land.  A weaker Shadow Knight with a<br/>
weapon<br/>
&gt; such as the Dark Reaver would definitely be a target to many of the raw PK<br/>
&gt; (Player Killer) guilds, as the weapon would sell for several hundred plat<br/>
&gt; simply because lower Guk is HELL and no one deserves the pain involved in<br/>
&gt; camping it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am a member of the Blood Coven on Rallos Zek, a guild of DE females<br/>
sworn<br/>
&gt; to defend DE purity.  I have killed many Tier&#39;Dal traitors and I have seen<br/>
&gt; the item lust and covetous nature of many players.  I was simply and<br/>
&gt; realistically stating that you must be prepared to defend your wealth and<br/>
&gt; yourself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just cannot comprehend a Role Play world where I can carry around my<br/>
best<br/>
&gt; gear all of  the time and never worry about High Elf raiders seeking blood<br/>
&gt; retribution or Dwarven clansmen initiating their young on my dark blood.<br/>
&gt; You want to play Shadow Knights?  Play one on Rallos Zek, I dare you.  You<br/>
&gt; will never know what evil races can do until you have seen Darkenbane and<br/>
&gt; the Horde ( DEs, Ogres, and Trolls) grind their way through all of the<br/>
&gt; players and many of the guards ( sometimes merchants ) in West Freeport.<br/>
&gt; The human newbee zone is a graveyard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; THIS is why I am a Dark Elf, I am the Vanguard of evil.  The Dark Tower in<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; world of light.  Neriak and The Nectulos forest are inviolate, as they<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; meant to be.  Many players on the server are poor but NO ONE can say that<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t earned every copper.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tell you a story.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You just don&#39;t know what it means to be an evil race until you zone into<br/>
&gt; East Commons from Nectulos, and stand face to face with a six-pack of 16th<br/>
&gt; level High Elf wizards...powering up.  The knock back saved my life, as I<br/>
&gt; zoned once again, with 18 life.  Shadow Step put over half the zone<br/>
between<br/>
&gt; them and me with three leaps and the alarm went out.  The response was<br/>
&gt; staggering.  Newbies zoned into the commons to be spotters since they<br/>
could<br/>
&gt; not be attacked and a respectable force collected, zoned, and beat their<br/>
&gt; ass.  They never returned and two of the bodies are still there in the<br/>
dirt,<br/>
&gt; twisted by a half dozen harm touches.  Lucky for me a Freeport and<br/>
Northern<br/>
&gt; Ro raid was forming that day, as scheduled, and I caught their muster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Such is life on Rallos Zek, war and hate made real.  The difference<br/>
between<br/>
&gt; my server and ALL of the others is RESPECT.  You respect your people, or<br/>
&gt; they hunt you into deletion.  You respect your enemies<br/>
&gt; ( and you have a bunch ) or they will over run you.  Guild tags begin to<br/>
&gt; mean something, typically the difference between relief and a rapid<br/>
retreat<br/>
&gt; or the bagging of your favorite thingies.  Weight allowance??  BAH!  I kee<br/>
p<br/>
&gt; two backpacks empty incase I come across a pair of frisky halfling Druids<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; for ANY excursion into East and West Nam...er...Commons.  I have come<br/>
across<br/>
&gt; extremely rare loot that I outright sold wile thinking &quot; By the time I can<br/>
&gt; defend this item, I can camp for it myself.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On Rallos Zek, an equipment inspection is often followed by a fire ball<br/>
&gt; instead of a &quot;cool gear&quot; compliment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just cannot explain the experiences on Rallos Zek with words.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You will quickly realise that friends and race are more important than<br/>
&gt; stats and encumbrance.  The mages in my party hold my loot, and all of the<br/>
&gt; good armour and weapons goes to us tanks since we keep them alive.  I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t cared about weight since level 9.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Where can u find these packs, cause this is my biggest problem as well!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;I need cash to get banded armor to compensate for my DE&#39;s low fighter<br/>
&gt; &gt;charastics.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks In Advance<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;     And note I am not getting any experience from these trips (and if I<br/>
&gt; &gt;could find a magic backpack that would carry 8 slots with no weight, or<br/>
&gt; &gt;lower weight I would be trying to find them).<br/>
