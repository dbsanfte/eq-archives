<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848370187">That is completly false Dark Elves make the better casters but it doesn&#39;t matter because your best offensive spells are level 12 and 16 Necromancer. I have two level 30 SK friends. One is human and one is Ogre and the Ogre is the better SK. It doesn&#39;t matter if SK&#39;s are great spell casters they are tanks. All they need is to be able to get off one or two dots then finish them off through melee. SK&#39;s are 3/4 warrior and 1/4 necro,  not 3/4 necro and 1/4 warriors. DE&#39;s do not make the best Shadow Knights Ogres do because of the higher intell over trolls and better stength and stamina.</div>
