&gt;Yes, there are many ways to kill a monster. But with the technique that I <br/>
&gt;have mentioned, we are able to kill a spectre lower than the level that is <br/>
&gt;required. And with more mana, a DE Shadow Knight is able to perform the <br/>
&gt;above strategy more effeciently. If we were to compare the Ogre and Troll, <br/>
&gt;however, I would believe the Troll would make a better candidate -simply <br/>
&gt;because of their regeneration. One of the reason why SKs are so tough to <br/>
&gt;play is because of our exp penalty and our downtime. With a Troll, these <br/>
&gt;factors can be cut down during and after a fight. Thus, giving Trolls an <br/>
&gt;advantage over Ogres.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;     True I sorta agree with you except in most cases a SK is a warrior <br/>
&gt;with spells for support two dots in and then you run in and start tanking <br/>
&gt;the char in other words. What you said was definitly one way to take out a <br/>
&gt;SPectre but I&#39;ve also watched a 30 SK friend and two of his friends, a <br/>
&gt;cleric and wizard take out a Spectre. The SK would pull run and cast maybe <br/>
&gt;one dot if that and then run in and tank, while the wizard blasts the <br/>
&gt;spectre and the cleric healed the sk. There are many ways to kill things in <br/>
&gt;the game. Overall though SK&#39;s are more tanks with support rather then <br/>
&gt;spellcasters, there are exceptions though. However overall I would say a <br/>
&gt;Ogre makes the best SK stat wise, of course that is my opinion. </span></blockquote></div>
