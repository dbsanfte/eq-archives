<b>Subject:</b> a new shadowknight <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-903931476">i am in the process of starting a new shadow knight.  i would appreciate<br/>
any suggestions about race, where to place my skill points (str, agi,<br/>
dex, etc.) , one handed weapons vs. two handed, suggestions for leveling<br/>
etc.  i have tried several web sites, but they were all really basic eq<br/>
stuff.  all suggestions are appreciated.</div>
