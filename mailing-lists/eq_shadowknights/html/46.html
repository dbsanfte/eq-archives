<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122079267"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;not to be rude myself, but, who has the time to sit and wait for the<br/>
&gt;general messageboard to come up within its 5-10 minutes?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s a general problem with the messageboards (and the reason these<br/>
lists exist).  It&#39;s frustrating, I know, however the people at Verant DO<br/>
read those messageboards.  Just pick and choose which ones you want to<br/>
read/contribute to.  I look at the General and Developer boards on eqvault,<br/>
and that&#39;s about it, and it&#39;s still frustrating since they are very high<br/>
traffic, high noise, and get recycled after a day.<br/>
<br/>
But even then, I&#39;ve found a lot of very good discussion about SKs in<br/>
general, many of which mirror (and expand upon) the discussion here.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If someone could perhaps give me a website with a good board, particularly<br/>
&gt;class-based or server-based, and not having to deal with the slowness of<br/>
&gt;the vault, I would highly appreciate it if the URL was posted or given to<br/>
&gt;me, thanks in advance<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This would be a generally useful thing.  I actually think that a good<br/>
messageboard reorganization at the Vault would be helpful.  I&#39;m thinking<br/>
about a LOT of messageboards so that there are a lot of messageboards but<br/>
each has minimal traffic.  A messageboard per trade skill, class, race, and<br/>
server would be a good start, then a few more miscellaneous ones (e.g.<br/>
&quot;General&quot;, &quot;Bugs&quot;, etc.).  It would be a lot of message boards, but it<br/>
would likely help things out a lot.<br/>
