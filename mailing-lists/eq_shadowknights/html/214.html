<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914527947"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;so you bought it, eh? or got a friend to get it for you?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I bought it. Does anyone here like to camp a few days for a weapon?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;to me, it is not the same of going in and obtaining the item yourself,<br/>
&gt;truelly earning it and rightuosly owning it...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not really. To me, earning plats to buy something is equal to obtaining it<br/>
yourself. For example, why not build your own computer (ie. coding and<br/>
building mainframes) in oppose to buying it? The reason that there is a<br/>
price for everything is because they are an equal trade-off. Money =<br/>
Material, therefore, My Hard Work = Dark Reaver + other nice stuff that<br/>
would otherwise be looted on RZ.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and if this Xillith would kill her own brethren for valuable items, I would<br/>
&gt;consider her a traitor...I say this due to the remark that was said. The<br/>
&gt;Indigo Brotherhood will not tolerate kinslayers of any reputation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She lost her cool there. I always respected Xillith for her role-playing and<br/>
helpfulness, but I guess all that looting of plats on RZ is starting to make<br/>
her jealous of something she cannot obtain.<br/>

&quot;I earned all that I have&quot; - Xillith</div>
