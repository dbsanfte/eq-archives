<b>Subject:</b> A newbie SK has A few questions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-501339572">Hello all,<br/>
    I have just created a DE SK and have a few questions.<br/>
<br/>
    1) Is there any place near freeport that i can buy food? I have found the Swashbuckler that will buy my loot but he sells no food.I find it degrading to ask the freeport residents to buy food and water for me.<br/>
<br/>
    2) What is the method of getting on the boat and over to faydwer? I have spent all my leveling Killing orc pawns in the commons so All the guards that I can see at the gates will con me dubiously, but I have been afraid to enter(I am only level 5). Will all the guards in FP area regard me dubiously? And if I do make it over to BB, how do I elude the guards over near the docks of BB?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you</div>
