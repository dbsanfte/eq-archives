<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755467054">Blackened armor can be obtained at Runnyeye. At level 10, I had full banded<br/>
armor except for the cape and helm. The helm I had was steel plate and the<br/>
cape was leather. Then I decided that the plate helm looked ugly and sold it<br/>
to purchase blackened armor (tunic, pants, belt, crown, bracer, sleeves,<br/>
glove). The blackened armor would be the best equipment in terms of coolness<br/>
and AC. But when you reach a higher level, you would then be obligated to<br/>
switch back to banded (because the blackened is heavy and the loot you start<br/>
getting becomes heavier also) or bronze for the AC.<br/>
