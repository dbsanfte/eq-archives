<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671873748">Human SK, standard int and 80 wisdom i think, never pumped stats into int as <br/>
they were not shown as being the main stats, was unable to cast leering until <br/>
level 10. Perhaps mana has a random element in it? A dice roll incorporated <br/>
into the calculation of one&#39;s mana or something? They did say they wanted <br/>
mana to be something &quot;mystical&quot; not a pure numbers game.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me what you think<br/>
