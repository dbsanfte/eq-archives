<b>Subject:</b> Bull Elephant Tusks? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-345888204">I&#39;ve been playing in S Karanas, and have never seen, nor heard<br/>
of anyone who has seen a Bull Elephant Tusk, needed for a DE quest.<br/>
The only thing I have seen is a small mammoth tusk, which will not<br/>
work for the quest (cost me my Kerra beetle eyes in the process).<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone done this quest?  Are the tusks just a rare drop, or<br/>
do they not exist at all?<br/>
