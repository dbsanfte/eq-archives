Subject: Soul Reaver<br/>
<br/>
Today, I was talking to an old friend of mine. He said that he saw someone<br/>
with a sword called a Soul Reaver. It is believed that the Soul Reaver has<br/>
the stats of 20/32. It is also claimed to look similar to the Fiery Avenger,<br/>
except that there is a mist surrounding the blade. Does anyone have any info<br/>
on it? All of a sudden, my Dark Reaver seems to be swinger slower today . .<br/>
. hehe<br/>
<br/>
yes i have heard of this sword it is a quest weapon but i do not know where or how to start the quest</div>
