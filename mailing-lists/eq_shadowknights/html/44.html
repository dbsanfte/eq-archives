<div id="ygrps-yiv-311626278">not to be rude myself, but, who has the time to sit and wait for the<br/>
general messageboard to come up within its 5-10 minutes?<br/>
I know this sounds overexaggerated, but it takes too long, so I do not go<br/>
there anymore.<br/>
<br/>
the only message board I visit is the Rathe, since that is the server I<br/>
play upon. and now that is coming to be slow.<br/>
<br/>
if you say that its because of all the posts or the ads, well something<br/>
needs to be done. I&#39;ve NEVER had to wait so long for the battle.net boards,<br/>
or any other boards, clanwise or gamewise, you name it, to come up. and<br/>
quite frankly, I don&#39;t have patience anymore, I ran out of that virtue none<br/>
too long ago.<br/>
<br/>
I posted intelligently, and flamed (due to me being in a rather bad mood<br/>
during the day in the first place, not their fault, but it still peeved me)<br/>
about them doing something about their  board. <br/>
<br/>
If someone could perhaps give me a website with a good board, particularly<br/>
class-based or server-based, and not having to deal with the slowness of<br/>
the vault, I would highly appreciate it if the URL was posted or given to<br/>
me, thanks in advance<br/>
