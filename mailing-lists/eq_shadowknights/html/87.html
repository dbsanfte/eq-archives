     The Shadow Knight and Paladin have no business woth dual wield.  <br/>
This skill represents a mastery at arms that only the Warrior and the <br/>
Ranger should posses.  The bottom line is game ballance.  Why play any <br/>
other class if you can get an instant dammage touch or full heal with <br/>
a repertoire of spells and a 9+ level pet to boot??  Verrant has done <br/>
well with game ballance.  What the charecters need now is some <br/>
flavoring...<br/>
     Consider this.  Paladinhood, Shadow standing, and even Ranger <br/>
reputation should be a measure of player standing with their <br/>
representative organizations.  If the standing gets too low, the grace <br/>
of the specilty class is lost until attonement is completed, (ie a <br/>
minor or major quest alone without the class powers to &quot;fix things&quot; <br/>
with their own group.)<br/>
   Why?  These classes are polarized in their alignment.  I have met <br/>
too many Paladins, as a Shadow Knight, who were bigger jerks than I <br/>
was attempting to be!  This is rediculous.  The dang Paladins are <br/>
stealing our reputation!<br/>
   If buffing the Shadow Knight is being considered to offset the Harm <br/>
touch vs Lay Hands debate, I would recommend adding another class <br/>
ability.  Aura of Fear, for those NPCs in combat against the SK who <br/>
are not undead and an Aura of Courage for ALL members in the Paladins <br/>
party.  A Fear spell could possibly spook a Paladin in battle with the <br/>
SK following a failed Harm Touch and a successful (as it should be) <br/>
Lay Hands.  For the ranger, perhaps an aura of Animal Friendship <br/>
when partied with the Ranger?  Imagine being able to camp and NOT <br/>
worry about Griffins pecking your head! An EQlizer if you will.  Food <br/>
for thought.<br/>
<br/>
Well, Hate you ALL!!<br/>

&gt;No, I don&#39;t think we should get dual wield. It make us way too <br/>
