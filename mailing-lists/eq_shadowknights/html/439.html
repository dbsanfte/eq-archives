<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477465910">If this is true about your DE-SK it&#39;s a bad thing. If you can&#39;t even<br/>
taunt the mob of a even level magicians pet you are a bad tank. Cause<br/>
when the clerics start healing 600 hps and the wizards burn for 600<br/>
points of damage you want to be able to taunt the mob of them (it won&#39;t<br/>
stay on a lowly pet) so they can continue to heal you and nuke that<br/>
critter dead.<br/>

&gt; Couple that with the LOW aggro caused by your slow yet heavy hitting weapon<br/>
&gt; and you have a high probability that the creature will turn to the taunt of<br/>
&gt; a PET over you or a caster if done right!  Group still doesn&#39;t want you?<br/>
&gt; Then they&#39;re dumb because the true talent of the Sk is mob CONTROLL and we<br/>
&gt; just get better at it as we age. </span></blockquote></div>
