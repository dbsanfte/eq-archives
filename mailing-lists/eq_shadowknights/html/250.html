<div id="ygrps-yiv-706384307">You are probably right about my arguements, I only heard them from other <br/>
players since I never spent much time with one character in EQ. It is kinda <br/>
hard for me to play enough, or stay interested enough in EQ to gain serious <br/>
levelage.  However I do have friends in RL that have been in the beta since <br/>
phase two, thats where I got my info.  I also love a good arguement, and <br/>
although I still don&#39;t know who is right (it looks to be you at the moment) <br/>
I consider you to have won.  I know npc&#39;s do hit for more at their level, <br/>
but not an incredibly higher amount.  And yes, STR does add alot to your <br/>
damage when you can do between 1 and say 80.  There are other things I know, <br/>
from experiences in phase 3 that I saw.  100 damage per swing ISNT ALOT!<br/>
Wizards at level 50 can do 1000! YES 1000 damage per spell.  That is without <br/>
resisting, so a well equiped warrior/fighter hybrid would have a chance, but <br/>
still, 100 damage per swing is about how much you can do high in levels.  <br/>
Rangers at level 20 can do 40 damage with a runed oak bow, and bows only <br/>
have half the damage multiplier of weapons.  Btw, at level 40 spectres can <br/>
be tanked, of course without a healer you will have to sit for a long time <br/>
with a bark potion and rubicite plate to heal, but it is possible for the <br/>
well equiped fighter to succeed in killing them solo.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun with your Dark Reaver, but I still believe from evidence of your <br/>
former posts that you are too low a level to have earned it through the <br/>
means a true shadowknight should.  Farewell and Goodnight.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All the arguing over EQ have caused me to crave playing it again, perhaps I <br/>
will reactivate my account and restart on the path to level 50 :P And still, <br/>
I think that it would be very nice for you to show your stats, without that <br/>
you have no REAL proof of all your knowledge, and check out eqlizer for <br/>
stats on all the weapons btw thats <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq">http://www.gameznet.com/eq</a> and you will <br/>
see where I have attained most part of my knowledge of the weapons.<br/>

&gt;I am not going to give my level and the amount I paid for the DR. I do this<br/>
&gt;to protect myself from anymore pointless arguments. Assume that I am level <br/>
&gt;1<br/>
&gt;with a DR if you want, I do not want to waste my time typing up the <br/>
&gt;building<br/>
&gt;blocks of Economics and how Level 50s do not do over 100 damage.<br/>
