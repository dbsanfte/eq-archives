     Lets take it to Verant and see what they think.  I&#39;m sure we will not <br/>
raise any new complaints but at least we can complain in a civil and <br/>
organised fashion.  I noticed an earlier post on this board regarding <br/>
forming a petition, lets all put in our two cents.  I&#39;ve gotten attached to <br/>
the SK and would really like to see it pan out as a fully respected class.<br/>

&gt;Actually, in Player versus Monster situation, we excel. Because we have a<br/>
&gt;pet, ~250 damage DoT (level 30 Darkness and Blood) and melee, Shadow <br/>
&gt;Knights<br/>
&gt;can deal the most damage in the shortest amount of time compared with other<br/>
&gt;hybrids. However, when one considers the amount of time the Shadow Knight<br/>
&gt;needs to heal after the battle, one would then see our weakness. Although<br/>
&gt;warriors has to do the same thing, they do not take an experience penalty.<br/>
&gt;At this point, one can clearly see that the Shadow Knight will take the<br/>
&gt;longest time to level up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In addition to the above, I believe Xillith raised a good point about the<br/>
&gt;pet being jumped on by every monster in the dungeon. Most of us will agree<br/>
&gt;that the pet is completely useless in the dungeons, and might even get us<br/>
&gt;killed in the process. Now, take into consideration that the pet, who is<br/>
&gt;suppose to balance out the &#39;kick&#39; of a Ranger or Warrior, might also take<br/>
&gt;some of our experience along with them, one can then see that we got a <br/>
&gt;class<br/>
&gt;that needs to be redone<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In conclusion, take note of the following:<br/>
&gt;- exp penalty<br/>
&gt;- bad factions<br/>
&gt;- useless pet indoors and somewhat outdoors<br/>
&gt;- the only hybrid that cannot heal to compensate for the downtime<br/>
&gt;- resistable HT<br/>
&gt;- Darkness spells are resisted ALOT even on blues, more on yellows and reds<br/>
&gt;(I had it resisted 4 out of 4 times on a low blue)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Some may say it gets better on higher levels, but what I&#39;ve stated applies<br/>
&gt;to all levels (and this same thing is said from another 48 Shadow Knight on<br/>
&gt;the same server, so all this is based on anything before the 49th level<br/>
&gt;spells). Is it worth it to go on? I would not. But would one want all that<br/>
&gt;time that went into the SK to be wasted? No.<br/>
