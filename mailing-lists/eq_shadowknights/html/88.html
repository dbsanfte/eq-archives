<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851997840">just curious, but how did you mean for being able &quot;to camp without having<br/>
to worry about a griffin pecking at your head?&quot; it surely could not have<br/>
been the aura of animal friendship you were talking about, for a griffin,<br/>
is no animal, but a beast, a deformity.<br/>

&gt; Heck NO!!<br/>
&gt;      The Shadow Knight and Paladin have no business woth dual wield.  <br/>
&gt; This skill represents a mastery at arms that only the Warrior and the <br/>
&gt; Ranger should posses.  The bottom line is game ballance.  Why play any <br/>
&gt; other class if you can get an instant dammage touch or full heal with <br/>
&gt; a repertoire of spells and a 9+ level pet to boot??  Verrant has done <br/>
&gt; well with game ballance.  What the charecters need now is some <br/>
&gt; flavoring...<br/>
&gt;      Consider this.  Paladinhood, Shadow standing, and even Ranger <br/>
&gt; reputation should be a measure of player standing with their <br/>
&gt; representative organizations.  If the standing gets too low, the grace <br/>
&gt; of the specilty class is lost until attonement is completed, (ie a <br/>
&gt; minor or major quest alone without the class powers to &quot;fix things&quot; <br/>
&gt; with their own group.)<br/>
&gt;    Why?  These classes are polarized in their alignment.  I have met <br/>
&gt; too many Paladins, as a Shadow Knight, who were bigger jerks than I <br/>
&gt; was attempting to be!  This is rediculous.  The dang Paladins are <br/>
&gt; stealing our reputation!<br/>
&gt;    If buffing the Shadow Knight is being considered to offset the Harm <br/>
&gt; touch vs Lay Hands debate, I would recommend adding another class <br/>
&gt; ability.  Aura of Fear, for those NPCs in combat against the SK who <br/>
&gt; are not undead and an Aura of Courage for ALL members in the Paladins <br/>
&gt; party.  A Fear spell could possibly spook a Paladin in battle with the <br/>
&gt; SK following a failed Harm Touch and a successful (as it should be) <br/>
&gt; Lay Hands.  For the ranger, perhaps an aura of Animal Friendship <br/>
&gt; when partied with the Ranger?  Imagine being able to camp and NOT <br/>
&gt; worry about Griffins pecking your head! An EQlizer if you will.  Food <br/>
&gt; for thought.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, Hate you ALL!!<br/>

&gt; &gt;No, I don&#39;t think we should get dual wield. It make us way too <br/>
&gt; powerful. In<br/>
&gt; &gt;addition, Paladins and SKs are more stereotyped to use two handed <br/>
&gt; weapons<br/>
&gt; &gt;than having a blade in each hand; thus, giving us dual wield would <br/>
&gt; cause us<br/>
&gt; &gt;to lose our uniqueness. I do think that we should get the Lifetap <br/>
&gt; series and<br/>
&gt; &gt;a 100% working HT though.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Do you think Shadow Knights should get duel weild?<br/>
