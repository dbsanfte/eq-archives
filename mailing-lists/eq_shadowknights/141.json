It is obtained in Freeport, <br/>\nafter completing the quest to kill the messenger from Qeynos, in W commons. <br/>\nAt first it was a quest to kill Lady Shae and retrive an artifact and give it <br/>\nto the guy who set the quest. So i tried this... over and over. She was <br/>\ntough, coned yellow and had charm. I notched up 6 to 7 kills on her working <br/>\nwith groups (died a fair few times too). Mucho effort. She never dropped the <br/>\nartifact. I kept at it killing her a futher few times, petitioned at least <br/>\ntwice and was only told the quest wasnt broken to keep trying she should drop <br/>\nit. (kinda ruined the feeling of going and assasinating someone when i have <br/>\nto do it 10 time). Through all this im totally ruining my faction with the <br/>\nhigh elves. I mean im taking a BIG faction hit with each kill. Anyuways i <br/>\nstopped playing for a while. I came back this week and re did the W commons <br/>\nmessenger quest. I then found the Shae one had changed. It now says she has <br/>\nsomething called the Bayle List, which she is taking back to qeynos soon. She <br/>\nnow also cons blue and doesnt have charm - i can easily solo her. So ive <br/>\nstuck at it, killing her she still dont drop it, me faction is now ruined <br/>\nwith high elves. If someone she dont kos asks her about it she says she&#39;d <br/>\n&quot;have to be dancing with pink mamoths bfore she talks about antonious Bayle&quot;. <br/>\nSOOO i tried getting her drunk with a mule, still no luck. Ive searched her <br/>\nroom after getting rid of her bodyguard, no list, if anyone has done this <br/>\nquest or knows of the Bayle List, PLEEEEEASE help me!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nJorval, Level 14 Human ShadowKnight<br/>\nCazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\nP.s This post has not been proofread!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
