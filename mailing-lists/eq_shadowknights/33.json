If ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-124016678\">I love playing my SK, and have had no desire to play any other race. But, I do<br/>\nagree that we really got the short end of the stick when it comes to spells. If<br/>\nHarm Touch could not be resisted I would not mind the other shortcomings. But as<br/>\nJorval stated, traveling is a real pain. I have gotten killed by more Innkeepers<br/>\nthan any other type of NPC in the game. In fact, the last 3 times I have died (the<br/>\nonly 3 this week) it was by an Innkeeper who must have saw me through a wall and<br/>\nproceeded to open a can of whoop ass on me. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I expected<br/>\nthe SK character to be a hard one, and the reward of actually achieving a high<br/>\nlevel will be a greater accomplishment to me than playing any other race, but for<br/>\nGod&#39;s sake, at least give us some type of invisible spell. Anyway I am rambling.<br/>\nBesides that, the SK has been fun to play, even with its shortcomings ( I&#39;m always<br/>\nbreaking the monotony for my group by the occasional Zone Run from an<br/>\nInnkeeper...they get a good laugh out of it.) I just wish they would just give us<br/>\nat least 1 useful spell like invis and make the Harm Touch a no save spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nJorval,  I play on CZ also...I think I helped you kill Lady Shae a couple times,<br/>\nbut not sure. I&#39;ve moved to Qeynos, so if you ever in the area, give me a tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nReanin 13th level Human SK<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JACKiam1@...\">JACKiam1@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JACKiam1@...\">JACKiam1@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think harm touch and lay on hands are pretty damn unbalanced myself. I been<br/>\n&gt; harm touch in theory is friggin, great, especially at lower levels. But as<br/>\n&gt; people get higher levels say level 30, to times 30 giving a 300hp harmtouch<br/>\n&gt; is in now way going to be as worthwhile as lay on hands giving a level 30<br/>\n&gt; Paladin their 700-800 odd hp back! What&#39;s more, harmtouch CAN be resisted<br/>\n&gt; either totaly or partialy. Also on the EQlizer site, it says basically that<br/>\n&gt; the lev 15 spells we get aren&#39;t all that useful. That said we are supposidly<br/>\n&gt; 3/4 warrior and 1/4 necro &lt;g&gt; but perhaps we should get a lil more power for<br/>\n&gt; being SO damn neglected by society, and we dont even have inviso to visit<br/>\n&gt; those exotic locations as the necros do!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; tell me what ya think and appologies for typos, im not proofreading im tired<br/>\n&gt; : P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jorval Human Level 13 Shadowknight, Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; You can now easily share photos and documents with your fellow list members<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out our homepage for details on how to use our new shared files feature! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
