I currently<br/>\n&gt;have the 15th level pet spell, and I generally always have one when<br/>\n&gt;I solo.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Last night I had a pet (different castings are different you know) that<br/>\n&gt;had double attack, and with a scimitar was swinging for up to 14 points,<br/>\n&gt;and bashing as well.  Since I use a 2 hander, I can&#39;t bash the gnoll<br/>\n&gt;soothsayers out of their spells, but my pet managed to do it at least<br/>\n&gt;once every fight.  By the end of the fight, my pet would have done<br/>\n&gt;at least 100 points of damage.  That&#39;s not too bad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pet tip #1 (Pet placement)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Set your pet out of the way, and pull to your pet like you would to<br/>\n&gt;a group.  I pull with Clinging darkness and then I can get another<br/>\n&gt;spell or two off before the monsters get there.  Always keep your<br/>\n&gt;pet away from spawn points, because the greens it&#39;ll pull just aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;worth it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pet tip #2 (Pseudo-tank)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This tip worked well for me from about 15-17 fighting caimans and<br/>\n&gt;crocodiles in Oasis.  It also works better with a high delay, high<br/>\n&gt;damage weapon.  Set your pet out of the way, and pull a monster<br/>\n&gt;over to you.  Cast the spells in this order: Clinging darkness (to<br/>\n&gt;pull), siphon strength, disease cloud.  Also, be sure to have mend<br/>\n&gt;bones memorized.  Then, you take a swing, and back up, turning off<br/>\n&gt;auto-attack.  The monster will turn on the pet, and hit him a time<br/>\n&gt;or two until you get your attack back.  Then you step forward, attack,<br/>\n&gt;and step back.  Use /pet report health to monitor old Kabartik.<br/>\n&gt;When he gets to 50% I usually throw in a mend bones, and then its<br/>\n&gt;just about time to recast darkness as well.  Then I step in and<br/>\n&gt;finish in melee.  When I was fighting blues with this technique,<br/>\n&gt;the only downtime I had was meditating, in one case I took 22 points<br/>\n&gt;of damage during the fight, and healed that while medding.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Our pets are weak.  But it would be really unbalancing if they were<br/>\n&gt;much more powerful.  Keep them out of trouble and use them as a<br/>\n&gt;DOT.  I just turned 20, so I might be ignorant of the higher<br/>\n&gt;level woes, but they work well in non-dungeons up to 20 if you<br/>\n&gt;use them right.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Xilith &lt;Obsidian Knights&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How many communities do you think join ONElist each week?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;More than 5,000!
