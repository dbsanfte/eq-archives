Watch out for the<br/>\npage limits I hit the end and had to do a &quot;to be continued&quot; at the end of<br/>\nthe message and start another feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically I said I didn&#39;t like harm touch resisted being that it felt like a<br/>\ngod gift, and thinking about it later it shouldn&#39;t be resisted because it is<br/>\nnot a trainable skill item.  If it was trainable, sure then make it resist.<br/>\nThen said that invisibility need to be moved to an earlier level.  Also said<br/>\nif an undead can cast it we should be able to cancel it (get rid of rabies<br/>\nmainly).  Necro has their pets to get rabies (so they avoid it) and cost<br/>\nthem very little, where we have to deal with it directly.  Also had heard<br/>\nabout an light spell that we get at level 49 (not sure if this is true) but<br/>\nthought that should be changed.  Really thinking about the spells/pet... get<br/>\nrid of pet we are the tank, give us the means to cure ourselves (again hate<br/>\nrabies) and a life tap series and maybe better Direct Damage spells.  Lets<br/>\nface it pets don&#39;t attack in PvP areas and they are suppose to make us<br/>\nstronger and they don&#39;t.  We ARE the tank, don&#39;t need no stinking pet.  Oh,<br/>\nand also they should get rid of the mend bones, since we don&#39;t have the pet,<br/>\nunless we want to heal our party&#39;s necro pet :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKez (July 8, 1999 e-mail) was collecting info/suggestions for the petition<br/>\nand Amatai (July 7, 1999 e-mail) was they both were looking for login<br/>\n(account) ID&#39;s and I really didn&#39;t want to pass mine out since I really<br/>\ndon&#39;t know either of them, and because my password is real easy to guess.<br/>\nFigure they can take these ideas from the list.  Plus they only have posted<br/>\na Subject &quot;Petition&quot; a few times on the list (no other posts) and I have<br/>\nbeen on the list since very late April.  And yes I have kept all 312<br/>\ne-mail&#39;s on the SK list since I joined. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it was Verant security/policy for you not to pass out your account<br/>\nID&#39;s. But not sure.  Do what you want, because I won&#39;t pass mine out.  I<br/>\nwould think everyone doing a feedback would be better, and do it from your<br/>\npoint of view, not mine or anyone else&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nTenin - Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Chris Brodhecker &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rangersrulenhl@...\">rangersrulenhl@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, July 17, 1999 4:29 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_shadowknights] Petition????<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Chris Brodhecker &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rangersrulenhl@...\">rangersrulenhl@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat ever happened to that petition someone was<br/>\nstarting.  I have thought much about the changes we<br/>\nwant. I think that there should be no large changes.<br/>\nYou are forgetting that this is not supposed to be a<br/>\nsolo game and it is not supposed to be a exclusive<br/>\nfighting game.  This is a role playing game.  Role<br/>\nplaying does involve fightng however so i am not<br/>\nagainst alll changes.  I am tired of a petition from<br/>\nevery single *&%^ class about how they are uneven and<br/>\nneed to be made better. They are uneven for a reason.<br/>\nIt is a GROUP game. If there was a group (i know only<br/>\n6 per group theoreticly speaking though) and there was<br/>\none of each class in it they could easily kill<br/>\nsomething 2-5 levels higher then them. But if one of<br/>\nthe classes left say the warrior and got replaced by<br/>\nthe supposed &quot;most damage doing class&quot; wizard the<br/>\ngroup would be killed because there is not a warrior<br/>\nwhich is the best tank.  Sure the paladin and shadow<br/>\nknight would tank but the would not lasts nearly as<br/>\nlong as the warrior.  I don&#39;t mind minor changes like<br/>\nadding a non combat related spell that is what i call<br/>\n&quot;god bestowed&quot; where as in the shadow knights case if<br/>\nthey got invisibility it should be something that the<br/>\nevil god&#39;s do that makes them invisible such as<br/>\nturning them into a shadow. As long as the change can<br/>\nbe &quot;god bestowed&quot; it is ok but just &#39;oh my paladin is<br/>\nnot good enough to solo i need a bow even though it is<br/>\nagainst the code of paladins&#39; complaing type changes<br/>\nthat are against the RPing story of that class.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n===============||||||&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;//////~~~~~~~~�<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;~~~~~~�<br/>\n===============||||||//////&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;~~~~~~~~�<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
