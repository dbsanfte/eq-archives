I like to use a tentacle whip when posing for pics ( as I lash the <br/>\nphotographer for full effect}.  I refuse to wear a helmet, as DE female hair <br/>\nlooks better flowing free and my SK has the red eyes of hate as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to business.  On the EQvaul developers board I have placed a post <br/>\nregarding the SK pet, as other gripes are old.  Please go to the Vault and <br/>\ngive your two copper.  I feel the winds of change!  They will not hear about <br/>\nthe HT issue anymore as they are well aware of our displeasure.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy our Nations B-day.  Have a safe 4th and I&#39;ll talk to you all soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Xillith<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Howard Chan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:howard.chan@...\">howard.chan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eq_shadowknights] (no subject)<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sun, 4 Jul 1999 08:09:25 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Howard Chan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:howard.chan@...\">howard.chan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As much as I like to have my character forever, I know I will have to quit<br/>\n&gt;one day. So, I&#39;ve been taking screenshots of my character&#39;s developement. <br/>\n&gt;As<br/>\n&gt;most of you know, I always strive to be coolest looking Shadow Knight<br/>\n&gt;around. Thus, I arrange my armor to be the most fashionable as possible,<br/>\n&gt;despite the less AC. To make a long story short, I would like to see other<br/>\n&gt;Dark Elf SKs in action or posing (don&#39;t really want to see Ogres and Trolls<br/>\n&gt;because they are not as awesome-looking). If you got a cool, spiffy<br/>\n&gt;screenshot of your SK in .jpg format, please send it my way at<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:howard.chan@...\">howard.chan@...</a> .
