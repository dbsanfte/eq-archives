I realize that banded is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1475627586\">Hail!  Well met my brothers and sisters of hate and malice!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would like to see is the stats on studded or reinforced leather.  I <br/>\nrealize that banded is likely better, but when in the SKs life is such <br/>\nequipment warrented?  I am 19th and I have a suit of ringmail I collected in <br/>\nHigh Hold, very heavy.  Tailoring is advancing slowly as hunting or ruined <br/>\npelts at my level is monotonous.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might sacrifice the ringmail for reinforced leather if the weight/cost <br/>\nfactor suits me.  Then again, DE females look FANTASTIC in  ringmail armour, <br/>\nand good fashion is severely lacking in this game.  So, anyone who is <br/>\nwearing the advanced leathers please tell me the stats and what they look <br/>\nlike equipped on a DE female.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn response to earlier posts, I am no traitor to the Tier&#39;Dal.  Although on <br/>\nRallos Zek, the mighty rule the land.  A weaker Shadow Knight with a weapon <br/>\nsuch as the Dark Reaver would definitely be a target to many of the raw PK <br/>\n(Player Killer) guilds, as the weapon would sell for several hundred plat <br/>\nsimply because lower Guk is HELL and no one deserves the pain involved in <br/>\ncamping it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a member of the Blood Coven on Rallos Zek, a guild of DE females sworn <br/>\nto defend DE purity.  I have killed many Tier&#39;Dal traitors and I have seen <br/>\nthe item lust and covetous nature of many players.  I was simply and <br/>\nrealistically stating that you must be prepared to defend your wealth and <br/>\nyourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just cannot comprehend a Role Play world where I can carry around my best <br/>\ngear all of  the time and never worry about High Elf raiders seeking blood <br/>\nretribution or Dwarven clansmen initiating their young on my dark blood.  <br/>\nYou want to play Shadow Knights?  Play one on Rallos Zek, I dare you.  You <br/>\nwill never know what evil races can do until you have seen Darkenbane and <br/>\nthe Horde ( DEs, Ogres, and Trolls) grind their way through all of the <br/>\nplayers and many of the guards ( sometimes merchants ) in West Freeport.  <br/>\nThe human newbee zone is a graveyard.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHIS is why I am a Dark Elf, I am the Vanguard of evil.  The Dark Tower in a <br/>\nworld of light.  Neriak and The Nectulos forest are inviolate, as they were <br/>\nmeant to be.  Many players on the server are poor but NO ONE can say that we <br/>\nhaven&#39;t earned every copper.<br/>\n<br/>\nTell you a story.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou just don&#39;t know what it means to be an evil race until you zone into <br/>\nEast Commons from Nectulos, and stand face to face with a six-pack of 16th <br/>\nlevel High Elf wizards...powering up.  The knock back saved my life, as I <br/>\nzoned once again, with 18 life.  Shadow Step put over half the zone between <br/>\nthem and me with three leaps and the alarm went out.  The response was <br/>\nstaggering.  Newbies zoned into the commons to be spotters since they could <br/>\nnot be attacked and a respectable force collected, zoned, and beat their <br/>\nass.  They never returned and two of the bodies are still there in the dirt, <br/>\ntwisted by a half dozen harm touches.  Lucky for me a Freeport and Northern <br/>\nRo raid was forming that day, as scheduled, and I caught their muster.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch is life on Rallos Zek, war and hate made real.  The difference between <br/>\nmy server and ALL of the others is RESPECT.  You respect your people, or <br/>\nthey hunt you into deletion.  You respect your enemies<br/>\n( and you have a bunch ) or they will over run you.  Guild tags begin to <br/>\nmean something, typically the difference between relief and a rapid retreat <br/>\nor the bagging of your favorite thingies.  Weight allowance??  BAH!  I keep <br/>\ntwo backpacks empty incase I come across a pair of frisky halfling Druids or <br/>\nfor ANY excursion into East and West Nam...er...Commons.  I have come across <br/>\nextremely rare loot that I outright sold wile thinking &quot; By the time I can <br/>\ndefend this item, I can camp for it myself.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Rallos Zek, an equipment inspection is often followed by a fire ball <br/>\ninstead of a &quot;cool gear&quot; compliment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just cannot explain the experiences on Rallos Zek with words.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will quickly realise that friends and race are more important than  <br/>\nstats and encumbrance.  The mages in my party hold my loot, and all of the <br/>\ngood armour and weapons goes to us tanks since we keep them alive.  I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t cared about weight since level 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nXillith, Lady of Pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nVanguard of evil on Rallos Zek.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Remlin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:remlin@...\">remlin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eq_shadowknights] Dark Elf SK<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 14 Jun 1999 23:31:04 -0000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Where can u find these packs, cause this is my biggest problem as well!!<br/>\n&gt;I need cash to get banded armor to compensate for my DE&#39;s low fighter <br/>\n&gt;charastics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks In Advance<br/>\n&gt;Chris<br/>\n&gt;Remlin Ryal, Warlord of House Ryal<br/>\n&gt;Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     And note I am not getting any experience from these trips (and if I <br/>\n&gt;could find a magic backpack that would carry 8 slots with no weight, or <br/>\n&gt;lower weight I would be trying to find them).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
