Brad is always talking about how <br/>\nhybrids are better at soloing...I mean we have an exp penalty for something <br/>\nright?  Right now we are as diverse as a warrior, we can do very little <br/>\nexcept fight/cause damage.  Rangers and paladins can root, heal, rangers can <br/>\ntrack and have damage shield and agility buffs.  Shadowknights don&#39;t have <br/>\nthe diversity their exp penalty should grant.  Lifespike (10 dmg) should be <br/>\na lvl 9 spell, vampiric embrace moves to 15 and then the level 12 necro <br/>\nlifetap is at 22....sound fair? I like it.  As of the moment just getting <br/>\nthe lifetap series would be too powerful...and I&#39;d trade ol Gebeker in any <br/>\nday for a way to heal myself.  Pets half our level end up attracting <br/>\nmonsters WE have to fight and kill, and then we have to heal off the damage <br/>\nand they really end up causing a lot of unnecessary downtime.  Besides I <br/>\nthink the shadowknight, paladin of evil, should have a more solo image, he&#39;s <br/>\nsupposed to be a mirror image of a paladin...so where did this gimpy <br/>\nskeleton come from?<br/>\nJust my thoughts.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
