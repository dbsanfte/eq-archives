I was wondering what guilds you could recomend on the E`ci server.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhalisa<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tXillith ofNeriak [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xillith@...\">xillith@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tSaturday, April 17, 1999 2:32 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[eq_shadowknights] Re: Shadowknights<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Xillith ofNeriak&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xillith@...\">xillith@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHey Lloyd,<br/>\n     Xillith here, I am relatively new at the SK myself but I have <br/>\nrealized a few things:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  SAVE THE HARM TOUCH!  You will need it in a pinch and nothing <br/>\nfreaks out a PKer more than the big SHAZAM!<br/>\n<br/>\n1a) The touch does as a rule of thumb (not recorded anywhere) Level x <br/>\n10 dammage + 1-3 pts per level. So, 11-13 dammage per level SK per <br/>\ntouch.  At fifth level, I dropped a human fighter who was &quot;yellow&quot; to <br/>\nme from 3/4 life to dead, BOOM!!  He had no idea I was an SK until <br/>\nthat moment of truth, so savor it.  Remember though, the touch is <br/>\ntreated as a spell and CAN BE SAVED AGAINST for partial or NO <br/>\ndammage!!!  So be carefull around Dwarves and other such highly <br/>\nresistant little crappers cause you will waste a good ability and wait <br/>\n24 game hours to get it back!!<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  Use anon.  Harm touch is your ace.  If averyone thinks you are a <br/>\nwarrior, they will never see it comeing.  Save it for the END of the <br/>\nfight as a COUP DE&#39;GRAS.  Using it too early could scare your prey <br/>\naway.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  Do NOT use all of your training each level.  When you are ready to <br/>\nuse a skill craft, dump the points of your choice into it and watch <br/>\nyou expertise take off!<br/>\n<br/>\n4)  Before commiting to a skill craft, make sure your home town <br/>\nsupports it.  Example, Neriak doea not have the complete list O&#39; junk <br/>\nneeded to make bows.  So, Dark Elves seeking fletching will be very <br/>\ndissapointed when they discover that they need to be at least 13th <br/>\nlevel to cross the terrain alone needed to get them to a complete <br/>\nstore only to be either attacked on sight or ignored by the merchants.<br/>\nI  have no idea what the Troll and Ogre lands offer.<br/>\n<br/>\n5)  Take crap from NO ONE!!!  Join a guild, and display your colors <br/>\nproudly.  LIE ( you&#39;re evil so who cares) get into a duel and fry your <br/>\nopponent with the &quot; BIG WHAMMY&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n6)  Realize that you are hated even more than the necromancer!  Yep, <br/>\nyou are EQs&#39; enemy #1 and ALWAYS WILL BE.  So expect to die and die <br/>\noften.  Therefore, buy bags at your first opportunity and keep your <br/>\nstuff in there (bags cannot be looted).  Also, if you are about to <br/>\nloose a fight and you have a weapon you like, open your inventoery and <br/>\nmove it into your bag!!  Your killer will be pissed off when the <br/>\narmour or weapon that they wanted is safe in your bag and out of their <br/>\nreach!!!!  You cannot protect any cash you had though, thats life.  <br/>\nHave discipline, leave a few empty spaces in your large sac or <br/>\nbackpack for your prized equipment.  If you disagree, consider the <br/>\ncost of replacing a Two-Handed sword over a friggin bear pelt you <br/>\nscavenged!<br/>\n<br/>\nJOIN A GUILD!!  REALLY!!  DO IT!! Not an @sshole guild either, shop <br/>\naround and remember, you are who your friends are, and that could mean <br/>\nlife sucks!!  If you play a female Dark Elf (me) JOIN THE BLOOD COVEN <br/>\nand tell &#39;Brin&#39; the Grand Matron, that Xillith sent you.  I need the <br/>\nbennie points :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSO!  Kill proudly, kill often, and play a Dark Elf female because we <br/>\nare the coolest.  Enjoy EQ, everyone else does!!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Xillith, Lady of Pain<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Lloyd Fitzgerald&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fitzrcvt@...\">fitzrcvt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eq_shadowknights] Re: Shadowknights<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 16 Apr 1999 13:12:02 PDT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Lloyd Fitzgerald&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fitzrcvt@...\">fitzrcvt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi I am new and would like any advice you can offer <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
