Just not to certain <br/>\nguilds.  I am a Troll SK and have been to Oggok many times.  The only thing <br/>\nyou have to look out for is to stay away from the warriors guild, not that <br/>\nhard, and Chef Dugan, doesn&#39;t like us for some reason.  I assume this is <br/>\nsimilar for the Ogres as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Troll SK is a great solo class.  I am currently 21st level and soloing <br/>\nis still no problem for me.  The increased Strength I believe does make a <br/>\ndifference, just not until you get to 20th level.  My damage increased by <br/>\nover 5 points from what it was doing with my halberd.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I have had no problems with mana and didn&#39;t touch my int.  Once you <br/>\nget your skills high enough they have no prob maxing out. Once I level, it <br/>\nonly takes me a couple of battles to get them up to max.  On spells again, I <br/>\nshould be able to layer on those spells with ease.  Yes, we are tanks and <br/>\nwho would want to solo a Spectre, thats why there are other people in your <br/>\nparty. I was attacked by a Spectre at level 19 and lived to zone, was a <br/>\npillar 2.  Our spells help us a lot, but we are mostly tanks with mana bars <br/>\nand pets, at least with my experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents<br/>\n<br/>\nGrumbel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
