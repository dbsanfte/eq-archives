I&#39;ve been keeping a close eye on\r<br/>\nthe recent ideas for a petition for changes to our class and would be interested in collecting all the ideas\r<br/>\nand sending them over to Verant.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI would like to coordinate the efforts of for the petition.  If you ask why me, then I&#39;ll tell you I&#39;ve been\r<br/>\nplaying a shadowknight and only a shadowknight since EQ was released.  I am PO of Keziah Tho&#39;tep, a 25th\r<br/>\nlevel SK on the Bristlebane Server.  I&#39;ve more than understood and experience many of the problems have been\r<br/>\ndiscussed here, I especially liked the messages #8 and #9 from Digest #55.  I think players like PO Xillith,\r<br/>\nPO Tenin and Howard Chan pointed out very reasonable changes that with the proper attention brought to Verant\r<br/>\ncan be made.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCurrently, I&#39;m one of the lead members for a growing RP guild on the Bristlebane server.  Our guild consists\r<br/>\nof dark races only and our membership at the moment is primarily SK based.  I am more than sure that all the\r<br/>\nmembers of my guild will also lend their support in this petition, no matter who decides to present it to\r<br/>\nVerant.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLet me know your thoughts on this and we&#39;ll try to get all our reasonable ideas organized and ready to\r<br/>\npropose to Verant.  If anyone else feels they&#39;d rather coordinate this effort, please feel free to do so.  I\r<br/>\njust haven&#39;t seen a large enough movement to do so by anyone except Amatai, the moderator of this onelist.  I\r<br/>\nwill say that Amatai and I do play on the same server and we do have our differences IC and OOC, and I prefer\r<br/>\nto handle this rather than turn it over to Amatai.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAny comments or ideas should be submitted to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skpetition@...\">skpetition@...</a>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThanks, and I hope to hear from you all.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAllan\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-PO of Keziah Tho&#39;tep\r<br/>\n SK & member of Innoruuk&#39;s Brood on Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
