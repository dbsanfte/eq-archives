I have found the Swashbuckler that will buy my loot but he sells no food.I find it degrading to ask the freeport residents to buy food and water for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n    2) What is the method of getting on the boat and over to faydwer? I have spent all my leveling Killing orc pawns in the commons so All the guards that I can see at the gates will con me dubiously, but I have been afraid to enter(I am only level 5). Will all the guards in FP area regard me dubiously? And if I do make it over to BB, how do I elude the guards over near the docks of BB?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
