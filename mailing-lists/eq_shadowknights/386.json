From attracting monsters, to just plain falling off <br/>\nbridges when you are crossing the zone.  I think somehow we should start a <br/>\npetition, for example everyone on this list logs onto UO and does a /w all <br/>\nshad, then ya tell all your fellow shadowknights(or just the ones above <br/>\nlevel 9) to do a /petition requesting the spell changes.  This way there <br/>\nwould be a large amount of petitions coming in from almost every server, <br/>\nsomething verant, if they pay attention to paladin rants should not ignore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the soul reaver, all I can say is if its real jump on it :P, but keep <br/>\na look out, there should be better swords in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Howard Chan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:howard.chan@...\">howard.chan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eq_shadowknights] Pet for Lifetap?<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 7 Jul 1999 19:35:42 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Howard Chan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:howard.chan@...\">howard.chan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also agree. As of now, and maybe from now on, I will not ever use my pet<br/>\n&gt;again. Bringing the pet through Lower Guk would be something that no one is<br/>\n&gt;stupid enough to do. And since grouping is basically mandatory after level<br/>\n&gt;20 (or level 30 depending on what you fight), pets, in my opinion, is <br/>\n&gt;almost<br/>\n&gt;useless at that point. Sure, there is an occasional spectre that Bony might<br/>\n&gt;help, but it does more harm than good. If the change was made, I would be<br/>\n&gt;using the new Lifetap spells more than I would use the Summon Pet series.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I always thought it will be cool to be a fighter with a pet. But seeing the<br/>\n&gt;SK downtime and the uselessness of the pet (doesn&#39;t attack in PvP and <br/>\n&gt;duels,<br/>\n&gt;train-makers), I quickly realized that the pet is nothing more than a<br/>\n&gt;novelty and needs to be replaced. Unless they change the mobs <br/>\n&gt;aggressiveness<br/>\n&gt;towards the pet being dependent upon the SK&#39;s level, I see no reason to<br/>\n&gt;summon a pet in a dungeon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:coregimp@...\">coregimp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Shadowknights don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the diversity their exp penalty should grant.  Lifespike (10 dmg) should <br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a lvl 9 spell, vampiric embrace moves to 15 and then the level 12 necro<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lifetap is at 22....sound fair? I like it.  As of the moment just getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the lifetap series would be too powerful...and I&#39;d trade ol Gebeker in <br/>\n&gt;any<br/>\n&gt; &gt;day for a way to heal myself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Attention ONElist list owners!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html</a><br/>\n&gt;Check out the new &quot;DEFAULT MODERATED STATUS&quot; option.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
