At level 10, I had full<br/>\nbanded<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere is Runnyeye?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; armor except for the cape and helm. The helm I had was steel plate and the<br/>\n&gt; cape was leather. Then I decided that the plate helm looked ugly and sold<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; to purchase blackened armor (tunic, pants, belt, crown, bracer, sleeves,<br/>\n&gt; glove). The blackened armor would be the best equipment in terms of<br/>\ncoolness<br/>\n&gt; and AC. But when you reach a higher level, you would then be obligated to<br/>\n&gt; switch back to banded (because the blackened is heavy and the loot you<br/>\nstart<br/>\n&gt; getting becomes heavier also) or bronze for the AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the tips, the board was slow for a while, good to see posts.<br/>\n<br/>\nDharsage, Shadow 10 on Tanure </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
