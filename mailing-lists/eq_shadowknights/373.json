But with the technique that I <br/>\n&gt;have mentioned, we are able to kill a spectre lower than the level that is <br/>\n&gt;required. And with more mana, a DE Shadow Knight is able to perform the <br/>\n&gt;above strategy more effeciently. If we were to compare the Ogre and Troll, <br/>\n&gt;however, I would believe the Troll would make a better candidate -simply <br/>\n&gt;because of their regeneration. One of the reason why SKs are so tough to <br/>\n&gt;play is because of our exp penalty and our downtime. With a Troll, these <br/>\n&gt;factors can be cut down during and after a fight. Thus, giving Trolls an <br/>\n&gt;advantage over Ogres.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     True I sorta agree with you except in most cases a SK is a warrior <br/>\n&gt;with spells for support two dots in and then you run in and start tanking <br/>\n&gt;the char in other words. What you said was definitly one way to take out a <br/>\n&gt;SPectre but I&#39;ve also watched a 30 SK friend and two of his friends, a <br/>\n&gt;cleric and wizard take out a Spectre. The SK would pull run and cast maybe <br/>\n&gt;one dot if that and then run in and tank, while the wizard blasts the <br/>\n&gt;spectre and the cleric healed the sk. There are many ways to kill things in <br/>\n&gt;the game. Overall though SK&#39;s are more tanks with support rather then <br/>\n&gt;spellcasters, there are exceptions though. However overall I would say a <br/>\n&gt;Ogre makes the best SK stat wise, of course that is my opinion. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
