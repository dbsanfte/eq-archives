I now","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-934986020\">In my futile attempts to get the Ring of the Dead, I have done the <br/>\nfire beetle eye quest 3 or 4 times, the paladin quest, and turned in<br/>\nthe Thex Mallet.  I now am working on the Kerran Beetle eye and Bull<br/>\nElephant Tusk quest, hoping that it will give me the ring.  The woman<br/>\nalready offers to recharge it, but I cannot find where to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis weekend I managed to obtain the tusk dropped by Cracked Tusk.  <br/>\nThe actual item is a gigantic chipped tusk.  By the words of the quest<br/>\nhe says to bring the beetle eyes, but before I do that, bring him<br/>\nthe tusk of a bull elephant.  Now I have killed many bull elephants,<br/>\nand all I ever get is a small mammoth tusk.  So I figured that this<br/>\nnamed elephant might be the key.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve waited in S Karanas now for weeks searching for Cracked Tusk<br/>\nand auctioning enough to drive anyone mad, when finally I got an <br/>\noffer to buy it for 20pp.  Ouch.  I bit the bullet, bought the tusk<br/>\nand ran back to Neriak.<br/>\n<br/>\nI turned in the gigantic chipped tusk without the beetle eyes <br/>\n(I was supposed to turn it in first), and got a worthless junk message.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would like to do, is compile a list of failed attempts (I<br/>\nassume anyone successful is keeping it to themselves) of doing this<br/>\nquest.  Please include exactly what you have turned in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far:<br/>\n<br/>\nFailed:<br/>\n\t1 small mammoth tusk<br/>\n\t1 box of beetle eyes<br/>\n<br/>\nFailed:<br/>\n\t1 small mammoth tusk<br/>\n<br/>\nFailed:<br/>\n\t1 box of beetle eyes<br/>\n<br/>\nFailed:<br/>\n\t1 gigantic chipped tusk<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, is this quest just broken and I&#39;m wasting my time?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith T&#39;Vyn<br/>\nTunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
