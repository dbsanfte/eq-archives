I have never seen anyone doing over 100 before. Hmm, I must be blinded<br/>\nwhen I see high 30 Rangers doing 17 with their Demon Claws. And I must also<br/>\nbe mistaken when I see a level 40+ doing an average of 60 with the Reaver.<br/>\nBut that is okay, because they could be doing high 100s in your own world.<br/>\nHigh 100s, eh? Why not 9999 damage as seen in Final Fantasy games?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to quote you on something, &quot;I know that a level 20 warrior with<br/>\nthe executioners axe can do 100 damage&quot;. First, you condemn me for having<br/>\nthe Dark Reaver at my level, then you go on to state that a level **20**<br/>\nWITH an **Executioner&#39;s Axe** can do **over 100**??  . . . I am not sure<br/>\nmyself, but I think I see something wrong with that. Quite obviously, you<br/>\nare UNCERTAIN of your position of your argument. In addition, you give<br/>\nevidence that is completely FALSE. A level 20 with an Executioner&#39;s Axe, is<br/>\na &#39;cheap bastard&#39; as you would have called it, because there is no way he<br/>\ncould have obtained it himself (unless he bought it). Also, I have yet to<br/>\nsee a level 40+ with an Executioner&#39;s Axe that can do over 80; stating &#39;over<br/>\n100&#39; at level 20 already proves that you are pulling numbers out of a hat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very interesting to see how people react to others who get higher<br/>\nlevel equipment. Those people believe that unless you camped for the item,<br/>\nyou are not allowed to use it even if you have enough money to afford it.<br/>\nPerhaps when you have collected enough snake fangs to get your Mino Axe, I<br/>\nshould call you a &#39;cheap bastard&#39; and condemn you for having equipment that<br/>\nis out of your league. Just like what you did to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about the following: IF I was a level 1 walking in Full Plate, why<br/>\nwould you care?? So, what if I have an advantage over you - does that affect<br/>\nyour game play in any way? Or is it that you are so jealous of my equipment,<br/>\nthat you must condemn me for what I have?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Level 1 Shadow Knight who is surviving 70 damage blows from spectres.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
