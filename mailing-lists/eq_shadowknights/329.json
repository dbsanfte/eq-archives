That is, until a couple hundred players complain about their<br/>\nclass. Given that not many play a Shadow Knight, one can clearly see that<br/>\nthere is no incentive for Verant to change this class. Nevertheless, I<br/>\nbelieve that a few things should change in order to bring balance to the<br/>\nShadow Knight class:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Paladin&#39;s Lay Hands become ((level x 10) + 1) - just like the HT<br/>\n- Lay Hands will sometimes heal the enemy - to compensate the resistability<br/>\nof HT<br/>\n- Paladin&#39;s Healing series become the Summon Water series - to compensate<br/>\nfor the SK&#39;s lack of healing spells<br/>\n- Paladins, however, get Minor Healing at level 30 - to balance out the<br/>\nrandomness and &#39;usefulness&#39; of Vampiric Embrace<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the above will bring balance between the Paladin and the Shadow Knight.<br/>\nI won&#39;t even go into why Shamans, Druids and Necros (with Jboots) are too<br/>\npowerful. I&#39;ve seen the same level Shaman and Druid soloing Cyclops when I<br/>\ncan hardly put a dent in them. Even with Pet, HT, going oom and the a good<br/>\nweapon, I can hardly take off 50% of it&#39;s life before having to zone. Now<br/>\nthat Verant is increasing the speed of DoT, it makes Shamans and Necros<br/>\nleaps ahead of Shadow Knights. But I&#39;m used to that - all I want is to bring<br/>\nbalance between the SK and the Paladin.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote - I believe I posted the wrong info about the Vampiric Embrace the<br/>\nother day. It is not (12 + (2/2 levels beyond 22)); rather, I found out that<br/>\nit is something much less. Does anyone have the correct formula for the VM?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
