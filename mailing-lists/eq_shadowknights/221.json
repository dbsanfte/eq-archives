It is NOT possible to tank a spectre unless you have a cleric<br/>\nin the group. One probable reason that you survived the spectre at level 19<br/>\nwas maybe the spectre was Ensnared, Darknessed or busy killing other victims<br/>\nnear you (that has saved me countless times before).<br/>\nOkay, I might have exaggerated the part about the inability to tank a<br/>\nspectre. You COULD tank a spectre in a party (assuming you have a really<br/>\ngood group), but you will be left with low health which is undesirable in a<br/>\nparty. The best strategy (even with a good group) is to run the spectre<br/>\naround and allow your DoT to take it&#39;s effects and renew it until you are<br/>\nout of mana. Then, and only then, should you engage into melee.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;should be able to layer on those spells with ease.  Yes, we are tanks and<br/>\n&gt;who would want to solo a Spectre, thats why there are other people in your<br/>\n&gt;party. I was attacked by a Spectre at level 19 and lived to zone, was a<br/>\n&gt;pillar 2.  Our spells help us a lot, but we are mostly tanks with mana bars<br/>\n&gt;and pets, at least with my experiences. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
