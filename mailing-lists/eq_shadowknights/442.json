It is <br/>\na scithe with 14dmg 40spd +4str and one charge of Complete Healing (yep, an <br/>\nSK Lay Hands)and LORE.  Any SK can use it, you just need to be a DE to do <br/>\nthe quest.  Eventually you get the Ring of the Dead but it is DE only as <br/>\nwell.  The Reaper sells to merchants for about 10plat, so you get a nice <br/>\nreturn before you do the quest again and this is a great quest for gaining <br/>\nfaction with The Dead of Neriak.<br/>\n<br/>\nXillith<br/>\nRallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dissonance@...\">dissonance@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eq_shadowknights]<br/>\n&gt;Date: 13 Oct 1999 16:09:17 -0000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;BTW, the Pestilence Scythe is a magic, lore, no drop item found on Lord <br/>\n&gt;Grimrot, who stands in the ruins immediately south of the white bridge in <br/>\n&gt;South Karana. He&#39;s a level 35 SK that is a lot tougher than he seems, and <br/>\n&gt;if you kill him OR any of the putrid skeletons guarding him your factions <br/>\n&gt;drop with the Bloodsabers and go up with Qeynos guards, etc. The <br/>\n&gt;Bloodsabers are the human SK guild in Qeynos who worship Bertoxxulous.<br/>\n&gt;Stats on the scythe are as follows. 16 dmg, 48 dlay, +10 poison and disease <br/>\n&gt;save, and has one charge for Vampiric Curse. I wasn&#39;t able to see the exact <br/>\n&gt;effects of this spell, so I&#39;m fairly anxious to figure out how to recharge <br/>\n&gt;it. If it can be recharged, that is. It can be used by warriors, SK&#39;s, and <br/>\n&gt;necromancers (although I think it should be SK and necro only!) I got this <br/>\n&gt;scythe for the look of my character, and for the storyline we have. Sure <br/>\n&gt;there&#39;s better weapons.. but until there&#39;s a better scythe this is what <br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ll be using. =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Envy of Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
