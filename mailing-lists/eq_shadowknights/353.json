For both classes,<br/>\nhow about harming / healing the total of their unaltered life force (hit<br/>\npoints total) ? As an alternative, consider simply slaying outright / fully<br/>\nhealing (or within 1-10%) their level or below, and for their level or<br/>\nhigher no more than their unaltered hit point max. I added to both<br/>\nsuggestions that neither should be resisted, or both should have equal<br/>\nchance by level for failure as this is a &#39;divine gift&#39; (IMHO).<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the chance for failure would be related to faction. that might make<br/>\nfor nice role-playing ;-), e.g..: Been whacking a lot of evil crits getting<br/>\nyour faction up to walk into town ? Hmmm might not be favourable to the<br/>\nghods and your deadly touch might fail at a critical time. Same with Heal<br/>\nfor paladins, and perhaps even more so because of their goodie-goodie<br/>\nethics; whack a bunch of innocents for some item and, whoops, dang heal<br/>\nfizzled, &#39;Rodcet Nife has frowned on you&#39; - hehehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBumzuk of Grobb</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
