The<br/>\nonly way that I see, is through the use of the Lifetap series. I believe<br/>\nthat Verant took out the Lifetap series for the SK because of the Troll&#39;s<br/>\nregeneration. Verant think that if the Troll can regen and Lifetap, it could<br/>\ncreate an ultimate class. However, Troll&#39;s natural regeneration is not fast<br/>\nand they take a worse faction hit than Dark Elves. Thus, making the SK class<br/>\nweak due to the Troll regeneration simply makes other race/class<br/>\ncombinations tough to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne can argue that there are tactics to prevent the SK from getting hit. But<br/>\nthese tactics are mana consuming and might not work all the time. Thus,<br/>\ngetting hit is unavoidable. And along with getting hit, there are big<br/>\ndowntimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen others will raise the point that one must find a group at higher<br/>\nlevels. I agree completely. However, after reading a post elsewhere, I found<br/>\na counter point to this - would a group want a SK who can use Voice Graft or<br/>\na Paladin that can cast Greater Heal (~300+HP heal) at level 39? A Paladin,<br/>\nwho can act very well as a secondary healer, is in fact, more desirable in a<br/>\ngroup. While SKs are still doing 40 some odd damage at level 38 with their<br/>\nWard Undead, a Paladin can be doing over 100 with Expulse Undead.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough, there wasn&#39;t a point to this message, but it&#39;s some facts that I<br/>\nthought I should share.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote - the original poster that brought up the Greater Healing argument also<br/>\nsuggested something interesting. He compared the Greater Healing of the<br/>\nPaladin with the Harm Touch ability of the Shadow Knight at level 39. I&#39;ll<br/>\nlet you figure the rest out . . .</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
