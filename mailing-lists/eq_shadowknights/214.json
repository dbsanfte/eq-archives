Does anyone here like to camp a few days for a weapon?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;to me, it is not the same of going in and obtaining the item yourself,<br/>\n&gt;truelly earning it and rightuosly owning it...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not really. To me, earning plats to buy something is equal to obtaining it<br/>\nyourself. For example, why not build your own computer (ie. coding and<br/>\nbuilding mainframes) in oppose to buying it? The reason that there is a<br/>\nprice for everything is because they are an equal trade-off. Money =<br/>\nMaterial, therefore, My Hard Work = Dark Reaver + other nice stuff that<br/>\nwould otherwise be looted on RZ.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and if this Xillith would kill her own brethren for valuable items, I would<br/>\n&gt;consider her a traitor...I say this due to the remark that was said. The<br/>\n&gt;Indigo Brotherhood will not tolerate kinslayers of any reputation.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She lost her cool there. I always respected Xillith for her role-playing and<br/>\nhelpfulness, but I guess all that looting of plats on RZ is starting to make<br/>\nher jealous of something she cannot obtain.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I earned all that I have&quot; - Xillith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
