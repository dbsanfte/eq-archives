She had orders from<br/>\n&gt; her guild<br/>\n&gt; leader, Runethar Hamest (spelling?) to go to Surefall Glade in the<br/>\n&gt; Jaggedpines<br/>\n&gt; and get the Bayle List from one of the Rangers there (name<br/>\n&gt; forgotten-easy to<br/>\n&gt; find, but evil is killed on sight) However, upon arriving, she finds<br/>\n&gt; that the<br/>\n&gt; Bayle list has been eaten, along with the Ranger&#39;s son (snicker) by the<br/>\n&gt; great<br/>\n&gt; Mammoth Beast of the Pines.  My &quot;friend&quot; knows of an entrance to the<br/>\n&gt; cave where<br/>\n&gt; the mammoth lives, but it&#39;s from inside Surefall. By the way, the<br/>\n&gt; Mammoth is a<br/>\n&gt; huge bear. And Antonius Bayle hired the Temple of Thunder to deliver the<br/>\n&gt; list to<br/>\n&gt; him, because he doesn&#39;t trust his own guards.  That&#39;s what I know of the<br/>\n&gt; Bayle<br/>\n&gt; list.  It could be that someone or something killed the mammoth, or the<br/>\n&gt; quest<br/>\n&gt; just suddenly changed, or perhaps there&#39;s more than one Bayle list<br/>\n&gt; wandering<br/>\n&gt; about, I don&#39;t know.  Just thought maybe this could be of some help.
