It is also claimed to look similar to the Fiery Avenger,<br/>\n&gt; except that there is a mist surrounding the blade. Does anyone have any info<br/>\n&gt; on it? All of a sudden, my Dark Reaver seems to be swinger slower today . .<br/>\n&gt; . hehe<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow!  Does it have an effect on it as well?
