It starts with a task to kill Drosco, a ghoul nearby in the aqueduct.  You then give Drosco&#39;s letter to the npc and get a quest to kill Frumpy Irontoe in Fish&#39;s Ale.  Give Frumpy all the mead he asks for, follow the hints he give, and soon he will run away frightened.  If you get him in a spot out of sight of the guards he is easy to kill.  If you get his head take it back to the guild and you will get in return a skull to take to Lord Grimrot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I happened upon an aviak killing Grimrot&#39;s pet skeleton, but that is the closest I have come to seeing him.  Did manage to see some Grimrot dialogue though.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
