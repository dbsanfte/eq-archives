Now, every once in a while on Zek, as a<br/>\nNecromancer, I see the same thing, so its not just a SK issue. I&#39;m not sure<br/>\nwhether its a bug, but I&#39;ve also heard that pets will sometimes be less than<br/>\nwilling to attack something that cons red to them. My latest experience with<br/>\nthis was with Codil the Naked Monk outside Freeport. He was only yellow to<br/>\nme, and I&#39;d have taken him down, had my pet felt compelled to join me rather<br/>\nthan the other spectators. However, like you said, PvP is the only instance<br/>\nin which I&#39;ve seen this happen, never during combat with an NPC, which leads<br/>\nme to believe it&#39;s another one of Verant&#39;s little oversights.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if they did not intend pets to be used in PvP, they certainly need to<br/>\nchange some code, at least on Zek. If we can summon a pet, we should have<br/>\ncomplete control over it and it should attack anything we direct it to,<br/>\nwhether that something is a Large Rat or a Hill Giant.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalvolin(Tier&#39;Dal Necromancer)--Rallos Zek<br/>\nAzalin(Human Shadowknight...WHY won&#39;t they let me move him?!?!?)--Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Xillith ofNeriak &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xillith@...\">xillith@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, June 29, 1999 12:56 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_shadowknights] LOOK AT THIS VERY IMPORTANT SERIOUS</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
