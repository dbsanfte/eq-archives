Well, when I tried to cast it I<br/>\ncould. I was still the same level(10) as I was when I quit the character.<br/>\nI have heard rumors that Veriant was going to change the mana for Paladins<br/>\nand Sk&#39;s because it was to low.  I guess they did.  This my be why some<br/>\npeople could cast it at 9 or 10 and others couldn&#39;t. Don&#39;t know. Thought<br/>\nthis might be useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I love our pets.  I gave mine a 2h weapon, and about 50% of the time,<br/>\nit would hit between 1-19. I was hitting for around 19 and my bash(they<br/>\nchange bash to level 6 now) was doing around 5. So when everything went<br/>\nright for one round of combat it was 19, 19, 5.  I must say I was going<br/>\nthrough monsters left and right.  I was really impressed.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Nuluk (E&#39;ci)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
