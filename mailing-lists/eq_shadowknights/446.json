Do you loose EXP if you Die.(or gain if you win)<br/>\n<br/>\n2.Can you be looted for items?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Can you be looted for cash on hand?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have asked many people that I have grouped with and I get different<br/>\nanswers each time. Some say you cant be looted, some say you can but only<br/>\nloose one item(if true, which item? they pick or random?). Some say you<br/>\nloose all cash on hand. Some say you dont.  Someone please give me the<br/>\nstraight scoop. I have a feeling that some ppl tell me I cant be looted<br/>\nbecause they want a chance at looting my Dark Reaver or my Skull Shaped<br/>\nBarabute. I am currently turning down all invitations to duel because<br/>\nNothing is worth the chance of loosing even one of my hard earned items, and<br/>\nsince the banks are not very handy for us, I carry alot of PP around with<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. Does entering into a PVP area change any looting rules?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time and Spread Evil</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
