You have to remember we are 3/4<br/>\nwarrior 1/4 necro.  Now, at lower levels I would have to say that DE are even<br/>\nor even better than Trolls and Ogres all the way up to around 22. But once you<br/>\nget high enough str starts taking affect and the higher str equals more<br/>\ndamage.  Our spells are just there to do extra damage while we go at it with<br/>\nour swords. If you think other wise then you should of played a necro because<br/>\nyou are going to be disappointed.  Now, I&#39;m not saying that our spells<br/>\nsuck. I am one of the people who like SK the way they are and think that there<br/>\nis nothing wrong with the class.  I&#39;m just saying that we do not realy on our<br/>\nspells but they are just there to complement us.  Plus whoever said about a<br/>\nspectre hitting for 90 points that&#39;s not that big of a deal when you get higher<br/>\nlevels. With over 1000hp and full plate 90 points won&#39;t seem that high as it<br/>\ndoes at lower levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Nuluk<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AmataiCy@...\">AmataiCy@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AmataiCy@...\">AmataiCy@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You guys are crazy. Dark elfs are probably the best SK. For over all reasons<br/>\n&gt; too. There stats are more balanced, they&#39;re int is higher, and eventually<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;ll pass up the ogre and troll in higher levels because of more powerful<br/>\n&gt; spells<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Amatai<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
