I have not personally seen him, but everyone tells<br/>\nme he spawns in the skeleton field just south of the noth to south karana<br/>\nbridge.  Whether or not Grimrot is hostile to sk&#39;s remains to be seen.  I<br/>\npersonally think he is friendly to human sk&#39;s at least, becuase I have been<br/>\ngiven a quest to deliver a dwarven skull to him so that he may create an<br/>\nundead warrior.  I have visited the field many times, but still have not<br/>\nseen him.  If anyone knows if the spawn is triggered by an event please<br/>\nreply.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
