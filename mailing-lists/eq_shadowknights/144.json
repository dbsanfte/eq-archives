She had orders from<br/>\nher guild<br/>\nleader, Runethar Hamest (spelling?) to go to Surefall Glade in the<br/>\nJaggedpines<br/>\nand get the Bayle List from one of the Rangers there (name<br/>\nforgotten-easy to<br/>\nfind, but evil is killed on sight) However, upon arriving, she finds<br/>\nthat the<br/>\nBayle list has been eaten, along with the Ranger&#39;s son (snicker) by the<br/>\ngreat<br/>\nMammoth Beast of the Pines.  My &quot;friend&quot; knows of an entrance to the<br/>\ncave where<br/>\nthe mammoth lives, but it&#39;s from inside Surefall. By the way, the<br/>\nMammoth is a<br/>\nhuge bear. And Antonius Bayle hired the Temple of Thunder to deliver the<br/>\nlist to<br/>\nhim, because he doesn&#39;t trust his own guards.  That&#39;s what I know of the<br/>\nBayle<br/>\nlist.  It could be that someone or something killed the mammoth, or the<br/>\nquest<br/>\njust suddenly changed, or perhaps there&#39;s more than one Bayle list<br/>\nwandering<br/>\nabout, I don&#39;t know.  Just thought maybe this could be of some help. May<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\nguide your hatred.<br/>\nLook for me on Tunare,<br/>\n<br/>\nEnvy<br/>\nLa Comtesse de Obscuritï¿½</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
