You still cannot buy ALL of the components you need in<br/>\nNeriak, Oggok or Grobb.  You will have to either develop contacts who can go<br/>\ninto town to buy you what you need or you sit around with a wasted skill.<br/>\nThere is supposedly a centaur merchant, who tolerates Teir&#39;Dal, in a centaur<br/>\nvillage in the Karanas.  I would not venture there until you are around 15th<br/>\nLevel or have a strong party to travel with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a shop outside of Oggok that sells bowyering components but I<br/>\nhave yet to locate it.  I have a friend who dumped 20 training points into<br/>\nfletching and decided to forego crafting arrows altogether and went straight<br/>\nto bows.  It is expensive but it is all we can realistically do for now.  My<br/>\nsuggestion is, if you have your heart set on being a fletching SK, you<br/>\nselect a human to play as so you have access to the components (provided the<br/>\nhuman merchants even sell to you)...<br/>\n<br/>\nDrakhan<br/>\nShadowknight of the 15th Order<br/>\nServant and Son to The Father, Innoruuk<br/>\nSolusek Ro server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Eric Muringer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:muringer@...\">muringer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 06, 1999 4:29 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_shadowknights] Fletching<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Eric Muringer&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:muringer@...\">muringer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, way back I knew there was a big stink because it seemed no evil race<br/>\n&gt; could fletch. I was wondering if by any chance this has been changed? I am<br/>\n&gt; making a DE SK and I REALLY want to take up archery with him. Archery for<br/>\nme<br/>\n&gt; is one of the main reasons I am choosing SK&#39;s. Can someone please please<br/>\n&gt; please please tell me that verant fixed this oversight and there is now a<br/>\n&gt; place to buy fletching materials? I logged on and checked that one place<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; neriak and that place is a joke; it only sells nocks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So is it possible  to buy materials not in Kelethin or surefall? Does<br/>\nmaybe<br/>\n&gt; Grobb or Oggok have the rest pf the materials? And if it isnt possible<br/>\nmaybe<br/>\n&gt; all SK&#39;s should feedback this as it essentially makes one of our skills<br/>\n&gt; useless.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
