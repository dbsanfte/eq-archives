So, I&#39;ve been taking screenshots of my character&#39;s developement. As<br/>\nmost of you know, I always strive to be coolest looking Shadow Knight<br/>\naround. Thus, I arrange my armor to be the most fashionable as possible,<br/>\ndespite the less AC. To make a long story short, I would like to see other<br/>\nDark Elf SKs in action or posing (don&#39;t really want to see Ogres and Trolls<br/>\nbecause they are not as awesome-looking). If you got a cool, spiffy<br/>\nscreenshot of your SK in .jpg format, please send it my way at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:howard.chan@...\">howard.chan@...</a> .
