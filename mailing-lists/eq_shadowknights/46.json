It&#39;s frustrating, I know, however the people at Verant DO<br/>\nread those messageboards.  Just pick and choose which ones you want to<br/>\nread/contribute to.  I look at the General and Developer boards on eqvault,<br/>\nand that&#39;s about it, and it&#39;s still frustrating since they are very high<br/>\ntraffic, high noise, and get recycled after a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut even then, I&#39;ve found a lot of very good discussion about SKs in<br/>\ngeneral, many of which mirror (and expand upon) the discussion here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If someone could perhaps give me a website with a good board, particularly<br/>\n&gt;class-based or server-based, and not having to deal with the slowness of<br/>\n&gt;the vault, I would highly appreciate it if the URL was posted or given to<br/>\n&gt;me, thanks in advance<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This would be a generally useful thing.  I actually think that a good<br/>\nmessageboard reorganization at the Vault would be helpful.  I&#39;m thinking<br/>\nabout a LOT of messageboards so that there are a lot of messageboards but<br/>\neach has minimal traffic.  A messageboard per trade skill, class, race, and<br/>\nserver would be a good start, then a few more miscellaneous ones (e.g.<br/>\n&quot;General&quot;, &quot;Bugs&quot;, etc.).  It would be a lot of message boards, but it<br/>\nwould likely help things out a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
