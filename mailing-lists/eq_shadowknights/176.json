I dumped 20 points into fletching without realizing that I couldn&#39;t do it without help.  You can make bow by buying from the merchant in Feerrott, but it is expensive, and event at a 20 skill, your success rate is awful.  Plus there is less of a market for bows than arrows and you can&#39;t really do bows in massive quantities.  Luckily, I&#39;m part of a guild, and I&#39;m having them fetch the required components for me, backpacks full of them.  Your best bet is to make friends that can do it for you, or be a human SK in Qeynos.<br/>\n<br/>\nScragg, Troll SK on Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
