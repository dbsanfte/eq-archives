I was <br/>\n&gt;just a bit annoyed at all those people flaming me for my hard work towards <br/>\n&gt;earning the Dark Reaver.<br/>\n&gt;So, to clear up the &#39;best race&#39; debate, I would like to do the following:<br/>\n&gt;I will outline the basic battle strategy of the fights with spectres to <br/>\n&gt;demonstrate the importance of mana at later levels. Let&#39;s assume that there <br/>\n&gt;is a Ranger, Shadow Knight, Cleric and Necromancer in a group. Now, the <br/>\n&gt;first step is to summon as many pets as possible. Then one would fire up <br/>\n&gt;the Jboots (for a SoW effect). The Ranger will then Ensnare, the SK and <br/>\n&gt;Necro will throw the DoT spells on the spectre. The pets are also sent in <br/>\n&gt;to attack the spectre as it approaches. Now, the cleric would use the Ward <br/>\n&gt;spell on the spectre; and obviously, the spectre will start going for the <br/>\n&gt;cleric. At this point, the cleric would run around in big circles to allow <br/>\n&gt;for the DoT to take effect, while the Ranger, SK and the pets will follow <br/>\n&gt;after the spectre to hit it from behind. When cleric goes oom, the SK and <br/>\n&gt;Necro will take the cleric&#39;s place and use DoT spells until they are oom. <br/>\n&gt;When everyone is oom, then one would engage in melee. Because the spectre <br/>\n&gt;hits for an insane amount of damage, one would like to stay off melee as <br/>\n&gt;long as possible. And thus, one can clearly see that having more mana is <br/>\n&gt;more beneficial than to have hit points and strength.<br/>\n&gt;In addition, there are more reasons why DE are better. With their high <br/>\n&gt;intelligence, they are able to max out their skills faster than any other <br/>\n&gt;races. And since it requires more time to raise skill at higher levels, it <br/>\n&gt;is advantageous to have a higher intelligence to make sure that all stats <br/>\n&gt;are maxed before the next level. Sure, I agree that high str and sta allows <br/>\n&gt;you to fight better. But since skills are also related to how well you hit <br/>\n&gt;and how well you take damage, having high intelligence indirectly affects <br/>\n&gt;how well your character fights. To me, the high skills of the Dark Elf <br/>\n&gt;would negate the high str and sta of an Ogre; thus, balanced. The fact that <br/>\n&gt;DEs just looks cool with blackened armor and the Dark Reaver, already beats <br/>\n&gt;out any stats the Ogres and Trolls have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
