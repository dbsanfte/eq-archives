The guards in Rivervale(Death to all<br/>\nhalflings) will KOS, although the 2nd time this happened to me, they conned<br/>\n&quot;look at you threateningly&quot; rather than &quot;scowling and ready to attack&quot;, so<br/>\nfaction does improve(Kill orcs. lots of em).<br/>\n<br/>\nKithicor Forest: The Merchants in the first cabin to the right would sell to<br/>\nme. /conned &quot;apprehensive&quot;.

I know that factions<br/>\n&gt;play a role in some SK&#39;s getting killed by a NPC, but there are some<br/>\n&gt;that will kill us immediately no matter what we do.<br/>\n&gt;    The only reason why I personally do not feel this a spoiler is<br/>\n&gt;because of this simple reason. If this were a real world (and when I am<br/>\n&gt;playing, I guess it is) I would definitely think that SK&#39;s would have<br/>\n&gt;some sort of network to relay this exact type of info.  Also, NPC&#39;s can<br/>\n&gt;see us through walls, so if I would have known that the 1st inn in<br/>\n&gt;Western Karanas had an Innkeeper that will kill me immediately, I would<br/>\n&gt;have given it a little wider distance  :).<br/>\n&gt;    I know that /con is a great way to tell if someone will kill you if<br/>\n&gt;you make contact, but sometimes that is not possible i.e. in the middle<br/>\n&gt;of a fight. If I could just see the name of an NPC strolling towards me<br/>\n&gt;while I am engaged in combat, I would have a little more time to create<br/>\n&gt;some distance. Just as I do whenever a Griff or Giant comes a little to<br/>\n&gt;close to a confrontation I may be having with a band of couple bandits.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, comments? bad idea? good idea?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reanin 14th level Human SK<br/>\n&gt;Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Did you know that ONElist hosts some of the largest lists on the Internet?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Our scaleable system is the most reliable free e-mail service on the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Internet!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
