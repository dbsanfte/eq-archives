I think that there should be no large changes. <br/>\nYou are forgetting that this is not supposed to be a<br/>\nsolo game and it is not supposed to be a exclusive<br/>\nfighting game.  This is a role playing game.  Role<br/>\nplaying does involve fightng however so i am not<br/>\nagainst alll changes.  I am tired of a petition from<br/>\nevery single *&%^ class about how they are uneven and<br/>\nneed to be made better. They are uneven for a reason. <br/>\nIt is a GROUP game. If there was a group (i know only<br/>\n6 per group theoreticly speaking though) and there was<br/>\none of each class in it they could easily kill<br/>\nsomething 2-5 levels higher then them. But if one of<br/>\nthe classes left say the warrior and got replaced by<br/>\nthe supposed &quot;most damage doing class&quot; wizard the<br/>\ngroup would be killed because there is not a warrior<br/>\nwhich is the best tank.  Sure the paladin and shadow<br/>\nknight would tank but the would not lasts nearly as<br/>\nlong as the warrior.  I don&#39;t mind minor changes like<br/>\nadding a non combat related spell that is what i call<br/>\n&quot;god bestowed&quot; where as in the shadow knights case if<br/>\nthey got invisibility it should be something that the<br/>\nevil god&#39;s do that makes them invisible such as<br/>\nturning them into a shadow. As long as the change can<br/>\nbe &quot;god bestowed&quot; it is ok but just &#39;oh my paladin is<br/>\nnot good enough to solo i need a bow even though it is<br/>\nagainst the code of paladins&#39; complaing type changes<br/>\nthat are against the RPing story of that class.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n===============||||||&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;//////~~~~~~~~�<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;~~~~~~�<br/>\n===============||||||//////&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;~~~~~~~~�</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
