I know that factions<br/>\nplay a role in some SK&#39;s getting killed by a NPC, but there are some<br/>\nthat will kill us immediately no matter what we do.<br/>\n    The only reason why I personally do not feel this a spoiler is<br/>\nbecause of this simple reason. If this were a real world (and when I am<br/>\nplaying, I guess it is) I would definitely think that SK&#39;s would have<br/>\nsome sort of network to relay this exact type of info.  Also, NPC&#39;s can<br/>\nsee us through walls, so if I would have known that the 1st inn in<br/>\nWestern Karanas had an Innkeeper that will kill me immediately, I would<br/>\nhave given it a little wider distance  :).<br/>\n    I know that /con is a great way to tell if someone will kill you if<br/>\nyou make contact, but sometimes that is not possible i.e. in the middle<br/>\nof a fight. If I could just see the name of an NPC strolling towards me<br/>\nwhile I am engaged in combat, I would have a little more time to create<br/>\nsome distance. Just as I do whenever a Griff or Giant comes a little to<br/>\nclose to a confrontation I may be having with a band of couple bandits.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, comments? bad idea? good idea?<br/>\n<br/>\nReanin 14th level Human SK<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
