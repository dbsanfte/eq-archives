Any help would be VERY<br/>\nappreciated:<br/>\n1. about what levels are comfortable in Runny Eye?<br/>\n2. is there anything specific about the directions to there from the<br/>\nstone wall in Misty Thicket? Someone told me to go west... (a little<br/>\nvague?) is that correct?(that&#39;s the farthest I&#39;ve made it so far. NPC<br/>\nsaw through my invis, and well...)<br/>\n3. any details about inside Runnyeye, or what&#39;s past that? I&#39;m assuming<br/>\nEast Karana&#39;s, or perhaps a bridge first?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your patience.<br/>\nA grateful Teir&#39;Dal Shadow Knight,<br/>\n<br/>\nEnvy</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
