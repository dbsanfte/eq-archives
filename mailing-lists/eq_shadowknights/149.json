I know however the letter is in reference to Antonious as this <br/>\nquest leads on from, as ive said assasinating the messenger from Qeynos.

The SK guy then gets pissed that <br/>\nAntonious is working with the Hall of Truth. Perhaps i should use me cunning <br/>\nand er, stolen Qeynos Guard shield to infiltrate the City of Qeynos and speak <br/>\nto Anotinous myself =PP</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
