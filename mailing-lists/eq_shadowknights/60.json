Ok, lets just say that paladins and <br/>\nshadowknights are evenly matched fighting hth, you both injure each <br/>\nother down to 1/2 hp.  Probably not enough to warrant the paladins <br/>\nLay Hands.... but then you harm touch him finishing off his remaining <br/>\nhps, dropping him dead to the ground.  THAT is the benefit of our <br/>\nability.  Now, our spells may not be the greatest at first, but later <br/>\non they start becoming MUCH better.   For example our DoT spells, and <br/>\nlifedrain spells can be VERY helpful.  Our pets aren&#39;t meant to kill <br/>\nthe enemy, but be more of a DoT thing, they stand there inflicting <br/>\nextra damage on the enemy as you fight them as well.  Things in EQ <br/>\nare actually quite well balanced, and I commend verant on a job well <br/>\ndone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Howard Chan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hchan@...\">hchan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eq_shadowknights] IMBALANCES: READ - Some insights<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 23 Apr 1999 19:11:42 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Howard Chan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hchan@...\">hchan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have played through many classes and have found the SK to be <br/>\n </span></blockquote>relatively<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;weak in comparison to every other class.
