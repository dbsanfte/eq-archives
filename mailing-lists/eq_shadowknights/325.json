Let me ask","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-253403161\">Fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint well made.  Yet, there is in fact a PvP server with unique rules not <br/>\nfound on any of the others for PvP ballance.  Ok, I am calm again. Let me <br/>\nask this of you:<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you know what was intended upon design?<br/>\n<br/>\n  We ARE ok in player vs monster.  My gripe is that I want ALL of my powers <br/>\nto be brought to bear when commanded, that includes the pet.  Duels exist on <br/>\nthe other servers as well and I have to forget about my signature ability <br/>\nwhile in one.  That is foolish.  Regardless of what was &quot;intended&quot;.  We are <br/>\nthe only class that cannot use all of our powers all of the time.  How do <br/>\nyou justify that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI will not complain again if the pet would just CONTRIBUTE, it makes THAT <br/>\nMUCH OF A DIFFERENCE!!  A single interrupt on a wizard, just ONE will allow <br/>\nme to flee or even consider fighting her!  Instead it just stands there <br/>\nlooking silly as I die.  Against a Ranger or Paladin the pet has no <br/>\noffensive value BUT, do they know I am an SK if they haven&#39;t seen me?  Will <br/>\nthey take the time to consider it and realize its green?  In either case, <br/>\nopening with the pet puts THE PET in their target window, not me.  I can now <br/>\nuse Darkness and Fear without expecting a Blindness to get me because I need <br/>\nto be trageted first! Suddenly my level 8 pet becomes a true treasure even <br/>\nwhen I am 21st level waiting on the next one.   As it stands, an SK in a <br/>\nduel is a foolish SK.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoleplay IS infact what this game is about.  Teaming up and facing the <br/>\nunknown.  There are times though, when the gloves need to come off.  When it <br/>\ncomes down to true grit and a keen strategy.  It is THEN that we are hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still love my DE female SK.  If I were stacking stats and not playing a <br/>\nrole I would always take the Ogre ( not knocking on The Horde or <br/>\nanything...heh ).<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, wizard DD casting times have dropped.  How does THAT figure into <br/>\nroleplay?  If you feel the game is being reduced to hack and slash, you&#39;re <br/>\nright.  Bitch at Verant.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen is Microsoft releasing their game?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Xillith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwolf@...\">pwolf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eq_shadowknights] LOOK AT THIS VERY IMPORTANT SERIOUS<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 28 Jun 1999 15:24:42 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwolf@...\">pwolf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;after reading through all of this, I wont comment too much, but one thing I<br/>\n&gt;must say.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;when the game was originally planned, it was NOT planned for PvP balance,<br/>\n&gt;it was planned for teaming up and player vs montser balance...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;and all of you are only making comparisons of player vs player, SK vs<br/>\n&gt;paladin, SK vs warrior, etc etc...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;this is the VERY reason why its not balanced for PvP, because it was NOT<br/>\n&gt;originally designed to be as such...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am pissed though that Paladins now get Archery...if the players wanted to<br/>\n&gt;be good at it, why not just make a ranger instead? it truelly demoralizes<br/>\n&gt;the game into &quot;hack n slash&quot; instead of the &quot;roleplaying&quot; it was meant to<br/>\n&gt;be...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Jeremy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jeremy@...\">Jeremy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [eq_shadowknights] LOOK AT THIS VERY IMPORTANT SERIOUS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Date: Monday, June 28, 1999 12:59 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jeremy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jeremy@...\">Jeremy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; All hybrids - paladins, rangers, and SKs - get an xp penalty.

The paladin at level 30 with all his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; buffs will have around 800hp&#39;s + Lay Hands gives him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in essence 1600 hit points. Now if the SK uses his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;mighty&quot; harm touch the paladin is down to 500 hit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; points.  The two skills are VERY unequal.  HT does not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even com close to LH.  SK&#39;s are not weak but are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inferior to paladins at this point.  And anyway why<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the heck do us Shadow Knights Get EXP PENALTIES?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Paladins get a BONUS while we get a PENALTY? Why do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the evil classes get the EXP penalties?  All of my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; friends started the same time i did they are level 21<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i am level 15 because of the EXP and i have played<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more then them.  The EXP penaltis are stupid as they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; serve no roleplaying service and EQ is a roleplaying game.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt;----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What do fashion and football have in common?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
