Because your point was on the basis of the 3/4 warrior, 1/4 necro quotation from a source, I do not consider that as a valid argument. I fight spectres with another a few others and to tank a spectre is stupid. In addition, I did not say that Dark Elves are better casters; instead, I said that Dark Elves allow you to have more mana so that you can cast more DoT spells before running out of mana. Oh well, who cares about the stupid spectres anymore, that is the the only thing that we can fight at that level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    SK&#39;s are 3/4 warrior and 1/4 necro,  not 3/4 necro and 1/4 warriors. DE&#39;s do not make the best Shadow Knights Ogres do because of the higher intell over trolls and better stength and stamina.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
