A Knight of such fearsome calliber as to be <br/>\nthe ONLY warrior class Mages are concerned with in PvP.  Skilled at arms and <br/>\nNecromancy, the Shadow Knight and good &#39;ol Gebeker (hehe), tear into mages <br/>\nand monsters with great ease.<br/>\n     Soon my pet will dual wield, kick, AND bash.  With me beside it casting <br/>\nFear and Engulfing Darkness, few escape my wrath.  When the tables turn and <br/>\nthe enemy is too great, I unleash the Hand of Innorruk!!!  Thus returning <br/>\nthe battle to MY favor!  Still not enough?  The pet will hold my retreat and <br/>\nShadow Step will deny ANYONE the benefit of my death (people, this has saved <br/>\nme SO many times!).  Why play a Shadow Knight??  Ask the other players why <br/>\nthey ARE NOT!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are obvious roleplay challenges and benefits.  Up untill level 15, the <br/>\ngoing was VERY rough as I am extremely interactive with other players.  But <br/>\nunderstand this, the difficulties of our youth fuel our hate.  Our hate <br/>\nfeeds Innorruk and He in turn, and in due time, empowers us to be the <br/>\nvessels of wrath and chaos we were meant to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatience young Reapers, night WILL fall on Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Xillith, Lady of Pain<br/>\nKeeper of the Shadow Knight sept and beloved sister of The Blood Coven<br/>\nRallos Zek ( where else? )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
