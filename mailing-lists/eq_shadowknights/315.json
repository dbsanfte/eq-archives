The paladin at level 30 with all his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; buffs will have around 800hp&#39;s + Lay Hands gives him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in essence 1600 hit points. Now if the SK uses his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;mighty&quot; harm touch the paladin is down to 500 hit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; points.  The two skills are VERY unequal.  HT does not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; even com close to LH.  SK&#39;s are not weak but are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; inferior to paladins at this point.  And anyway why<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the heck do us Shadow Knights Get EXP PENALTIES?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Paladins get a BONUS while we get a PENALTY? Why do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the evil classes get the EXP penalties?  All of my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friends started the same time i did they are level 21<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i am level 15 because of the EXP and i have played<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more then them.  The EXP penaltis are stupid as they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; serve no roleplaying service and EQ is a roleplaying game.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n </span></blockquote>----------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What do fashion and football have in common?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
