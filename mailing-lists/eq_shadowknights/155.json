Being a warrior AND having a pet distinguishes<br/>\nus from the everyday fighter. Also, there&#39;s just something about a Dark Elf<br/>\nShadow Knight with Blackened Armor that makes them one of my favorite<br/>\ncombinations.

I am a Troll<br/>\n&gt;SK and the reason why I&#39;m playing it is because I like<br/>\n&gt;the idea of being evil plus being able to wield a 2h<br/>\n&gt;sword while commanding a pet is just plain fun. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
