At level 10, I had full banded<br/>\narmor except for the cape and helm. The helm I had was steel plate and the<br/>\ncape was leather. Then I decided that the plate helm looked ugly and sold it<br/>\nto purchase blackened armor (tunic, pants, belt, crown, bracer, sleeves,<br/>\nglove). The blackened armor would be the best equipment in terms of coolness<br/>\nand AC. But when you reach a higher level, you would then be obligated to<br/>\nswitch back to banded (because the blackened is heavy and the loot you start<br/>\ngetting becomes heavier also) or bronze for the AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Where can u get blackened armor?<br/>\n&gt;What is the best set-up, armor, items, weapons a lvl 10 Dark eLf SK should<br/>\n&gt;have, also changes for near future? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
