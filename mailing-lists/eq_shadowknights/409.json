They are important in the aspect that they raise our <br/>\nfaction with The Dead so that other quests may be acccesed, such as the Ring <br/>\nof The Dead quest, ( provides a Gate to Neriak ).  If nothing else, that box <br/>\nis a free container to hold 10 beetle eyes.  =)  I want to do the mail <br/>\ndelivery quest when I hit lvl 30 ( and can invis ) to see the faction hits I <br/>\nget.  If quests are your thing make a barbarian, Halas is FULL of quests and <br/>\na few of them are cool and rewarding.  If you are going to do the beetle <br/>\nquest, do it now.  Soon you are too high a level to get it from the Necro in <br/>\nthe Lodge of the Dead.  Be carefull what other quests in Neriak you do, <br/>\nANYTHING that hurts your standing with the dead must be avoided at all <br/>\ncosts.<br/>\n     As far as the team servers go, I will under no circunstances make an SK <br/>\nthere.  It is rough enough being one on Rallos Zek up untill you aquire <br/>\nsufficient power.  The team servers are made for mages and mages only, and <br/>\nsince the SK is my favorite class I do not see myself going.  I did log in <br/>\nas a newbie warrior in Nectulos, discovered 234 other newbies in the zone, <br/>\nand returned to my beloved Rallos Zek.  The only TRUE roleplay server, where <br/>\nyour allies are the ones you make and not the ones you cannot attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nXillith Val&#39;Sharess<br/>\nBlood Coven<br/>\nRallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;James D.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jimdimag@...\">jimdimag@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ANA-ShadowKnight@onelist.com\">ANA-ShadowKnight@onelist.com</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Neriak@onelist.com\">EQ_Neriak@onelist.com</a>, <br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eq_shadowknights] Newbie ShadowKnight Quests<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 28 Jul 1999 23:55:11 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;James D.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jimdimag@...\">jimdimag@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello Everyone,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just started a ShadowKnight... level 4 now, but I can&#39;t find many quests<br/>\n&gt;for him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I already talked to everyone in my guild house and the NPC&#39;s in the warrior<br/>\n&gt;guild, but I didn&#39;t find much. I found the quests to collect beetle eyes..<br/>\n&gt;what a waste 1cp for 2gp worth of eyes. I also found a quest to kill a<br/>\n&gt;paladin. My faction was not high enough in the warrior guild to get the<br/>\n&gt;quests there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any advice? What NPC&#39;s should I talk to?
