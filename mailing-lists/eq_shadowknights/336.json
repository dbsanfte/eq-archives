I&#39;m sure we will not <br/>\nraise any new complaints but at least we can complain in a civil and <br/>\norganised fashion.  I noticed an earlier post on this board regarding <br/>\nforming a petition, lets all put in our two cents.  I&#39;ve gotten attached to <br/>\nthe SK and would really like to see it pan out as a fully respected class.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Xillith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Howard Chan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hchan@...\">hchan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eq_shadowknights] LOOK AT THIS VERY IMPORTANT SERIOUS<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 29 Jun 1999 17:41:02 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Howard Chan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hchan@...\">hchan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Xillith:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Actually, in Player versus Monster situation, we excel. Because we have a<br/>\n&gt;pet, ~250 damage DoT (level 30 Darkness and Blood) and melee, Shadow <br/>\n&gt;Knights<br/>\n&gt;can deal the most damage in the shortest amount of time compared with other<br/>\n&gt;hybrids. However, when one considers the amount of time the Shadow Knight<br/>\n&gt;needs to heal after the battle, one would then see our weakness. Although<br/>\n&gt;warriors has to do the same thing, they do not take an experience penalty.<br/>\n&gt;At this point, one can clearly see that the Shadow Knight will take the<br/>\n&gt;longest time to level up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In addition to the above, I believe Xillith raised a good point about the<br/>\n&gt;pet being jumped on by every monster in the dungeon. Most of us will agree<br/>\n&gt;that the pet is completely useless in the dungeons, and might even get us<br/>\n&gt;killed in the process. Now, take into consideration that the pet, who is<br/>\n&gt;suppose to balance out the &#39;kick&#39; of a Ranger or Warrior, might also take<br/>\n&gt;some of our experience along with them, one can then see that we got a <br/>\n&gt;class<br/>\n&gt;that needs to be redone<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In conclusion, take note of the following:<br/>\n&gt;- exp penalty<br/>\n&gt;- bad factions<br/>\n&gt;- useless pet indoors and somewhat outdoors<br/>\n&gt;- the only hybrid that cannot heal to compensate for the downtime<br/>\n&gt;- resistable HT<br/>\n&gt;- Darkness spells are resisted ALOT even on blues, more on yellows and reds<br/>\n&gt;(I had it resisted 4 out of 4 times on a low blue)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Some may say it gets better on higher levels, but what I&#39;ve stated applies<br/>\n&gt;to all levels (and this same thing is said from another 48 Shadow Knight on<br/>\n&gt;the same server, so all this is based on anything before the 49th level<br/>\n&gt;spells). Is it worth it to go on? I would not. But would one want all that<br/>\n&gt;time that went into the SK to be wasted? No.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What do fashion and football have in common?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;They both have communities at ONElist.
