If it does exist <br/>\nthat would be very cool... but it might just be another rumor.  I have heard <br/>\nof several other swords with names like sould flayer and other names with <br/>\nabout the same wording.

He said that he saw someone<br/>\n&gt;with a sword called a Soul Reaver. It is believed that the Soul Reaver has<br/>\n&gt;the stats of 20/32. It is also claimed to look similar to the Fiery <br/>\n&gt;Avenger,<br/>\n&gt;except that there is a mist surrounding the blade. Does anyone have any <br/>\n&gt;info<br/>\n&gt;on it? All of a sudden, my Dark Reaver seems to be swinger slower today . .<br/>\n&gt;. hehe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt;Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
