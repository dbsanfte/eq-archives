I take great pleasure in<br/>\nearning things the hard way, thats the way I feel. But if someone doesnt<br/>\nwant take the time, thats up to him/her...really, if you got a lvl 50 char<br/>\nwith every rare item there is, what can you do? everything is done, except<br/>\nexploring the world, and from what I have explored so far, town to town to<br/>\ndungeon to wild life, it isnt that big just yet...I say yet, because Verant<br/>\ncan always add new zones and continents. and once that is done, what is<br/>\nthere to do? run around and brag? who knows...the fun in the game, IMHO, is<br/>\ntaking the time to play the game out, from the very beginning. To unveil<br/>\nplots and quests piece by piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nbut, this is only my opinion, everyone will differ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\nFrom: Michael Wooldirdge &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike@...\">mike@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eq_shadowknights] Why..<br/>\nDate: Sunday, June 13, 1999 7:48 AM<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you feel it&#39;s wrong to sell acounts?
