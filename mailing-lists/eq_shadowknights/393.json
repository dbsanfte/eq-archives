Amatai (the onelist moderator) wants what mails I have received from people here so that he can submit a petition.  Its all up to everyone here.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI also liked the recent note concerning out pets.  I haven&#39;t used my pet in at least 10 levels now.  Would you all prefer if we were to get a lifetap series over having a pet?  I feel that our pets are actually more of a burden than a benefit usually, but not always.  I feel that Verant has always tried to point out that we are special because we&#39;re the only hybrid that gets a pet.  Well...I don&#39;t think it is that much of a benefit and perhaps if they were to take it away, maybe we&#39;d get other things to replace it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnyway, just my 2cc worth.  Let me know what you think.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  -Keziah\r<br/>\n   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skpetition@...\">skpetition@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
