Stat wise<br/>\ndarkelf shadowknight is probably the 2nd worst race/stat combo in the game<br/>\n(only worse is erudite paladin). You&#39;re primarily a warrior so you will need<br/>\nhigh str and stam, both of which the darkelf has little of. My best bet for<br/>\nrace/class combo is ogre, I pumped all mine into int since he already had a<br/>\nlarge str/stam, but some into agility or dex would be ok too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tom &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bearsfootball@...\">bearsfootball@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, April 22, 1999 11:16 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_shadowknights] Dark Elf SK<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Tom &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bearsfootball@...\">bearsfootball@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello.  I am getting a new computer in a week and the<br/>\n&gt;first thing I going to do is to buy EverQuest.  I have<br/>\n&gt;my heart set on playing as a Dark Elf Shadow Knight<br/>\n&gt;because they&#39;re the coolest. I would like to know if<br/>\n&gt;this would be extremely different to do, especcially<br/>\n&gt;for a newbie.  I do know a lot about the game though<br/>\n&gt;because my friend has it.  If anyone wants to tell me<br/>\n&gt;anything about the dark elf sk please do so.  I&#39;ll see<br/>\n&gt;you all on the Tunare server in about a week or so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tekman (future Dark Elf Sk on Tunare)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Did you know that knowledge is power?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new ONElist e-mail community and strengthen your mind!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
