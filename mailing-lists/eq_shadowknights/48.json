I mean its pretty<br/>\nobvious us SKs will want more powerful spells so we can crush the other puny<br/>\nclasses like the bugs they are ; )   ...who among us would oppose this?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we want things to change, the important issue to raise is WHY we need<br/>\nmore powerful spells and abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, there has been some discussion about the matching of lay hands<br/>\nvs. harm touch.  Personally I see the balace as being pretty good.  First of<br/>\nall, we have the advantage of pets to help us... Paladins don&#39;t have them<br/>\nand all that extra damage they do adds up.  Secondly, I feel that being able<br/>\nto do 700 damage in one shot without a saving throw would probably have some<br/>\nserious game balance implications.  Sure it might be a little fairer for<br/>\ndueling, but you could take out some very tough creatures with that ability<br/>\nthat you wouldn&#39;t have been able to before.... this translates into much<br/>\neasier xp for us and ultimately more SKs that reach higher levels faster.<br/>\nThe result of this is an imbalance between the classes.  I think that this<br/>\nis the reason why Harm Touch has been somewhat penalized.  Is there anything<br/>\nabout this you guys think I&#39;m missing?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also like to say that I think the abilities we get are pretty good.<br/>\nI participated in beta so I had an opportunity to play some other classes<br/>\nlike warrior and shaman.  They each have things that are cool about them and<br/>\nthings that suck.  Warriors can take down tougher monsters for their level<br/>\nbut you end up sitting around for a half hour healing after each fight if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t have a healer.  Shamans can heal but they are pretty weak compared<br/>\nto the warrior.  These tradeoffs are what make the game interesting.... for<br/>\neach class you get to exploit some cool things about it but you have to cope<br/>\nwith the not so cool things.  ShadowKnights have similar advantages and<br/>\ndisadvantages, but all in all they are pretty fun to play.  It all depends<br/>\non how you want to play the game or the style of playing that you have the<br/>\nmost fun with.  I think this is the way it should be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in summary of my ramble, I think that Verant put a lot of time and<br/>\nthought into balancing the classes in the game so that they would be fun to<br/>\nplay.  If we want to change them, we had better come up with some good,<br/>\nconcrete reasons that make sense.  We can&#39;t just go to them and say &quot;This<br/>\nsucks, change it&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my $0.02...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKudzul<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights-owner@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights-owner@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, April 22, 1999 9:21 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_shadowknights] New Survey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights-owner@...\">eq_shadowknights-owner@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is a new survey for the eq_shadowknights community.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you think Shadow Knights spells should be changed to make them<br/>\nstronger, or to add more spells?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Possible answers are:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; o Yes, I think they should add more spells.<br/>\n&gt; o They should just make the current ones stronger.<br/>\n&gt; o Dont care<br/>\n&gt; o Leave them as is<br/>\n&gt; o Should make them less powerful<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To vote, please visit the following web page:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/surveycenter/eq_shadowknights\">http://www.onelist.com/surveycenter/eq_shadowknights</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; eq_shadowknights Owner<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this mailing list, or to change your subscription<br/>\n&gt; to digest, go to the ONElist web site, at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> and<br/>\n&gt; select the Member Center link from the menu bar on the left. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
