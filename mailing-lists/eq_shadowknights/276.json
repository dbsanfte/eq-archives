But more or less I was thinking, of Humans and Erudites to do this.<br/>\n&gt; What I had in mind, a followers of the Plaguebringer. Necromancers,<br/>\nKnights<br/>\n&gt; of the shadows, Enchanters, Dark Clerics, Murderous Warriors, Wizards and<br/>\n&gt; Mages, all whom follow the Plaguebringer, to form an alliance. Perhaps<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; could be the player side of the Bloodsabers. I was also thinking of<br/>\nletting<br/>\n&gt; the Erudite Necromancers to be a part of this as well, since they are far<br/>\n&gt; from evil civilization, and it is difficult for them to travel alone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps a great intro for this guild, would be to group up and go into BB,<br/>\n&gt; destroy everyone they encounter in the hills along the way, and massacre<br/>\n&gt; everything within BB.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know many of you would not be willing to give up your already developed<br/>\n&gt; characters on the splendid server of Zek, nor perhaps if you have one on<br/>\n&gt; another server, but this was just an idea I had in mind.
