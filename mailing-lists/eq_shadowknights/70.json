They<br/>\nhave killed me once with no verbal contact. I had a chance to /con the<br/>\nwhole group last night and they were all conned as KoS. I will try to<br/>\nget some names of this merry group later tonight, as I will be in their<br/>\narea again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, probably well known, but the NPC&#39;s of Permafrost will also KoS,<br/>\nexcept for a gentleman who hangs out on the platform of some ruins. He<br/>\nwill not give you the time of day, but he will not KoS either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, hope this helps somebody out.<br/>\n<br/>\nReanin<br/>\n14th level Human SK<br/>\nCazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
