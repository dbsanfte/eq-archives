I have found the Swashbuckler that will<br/>\n&gt; buy my loot but he sells no food.I find it degrading<br/>\n&gt; to ask the freeport residents to buy food and water<br/>\n&gt; for me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     2) What is the method of getting on the boat and<br/>\n&gt; over to faydwer? I have spent all my leveling<br/>\n&gt; Killing orc pawns in the commons so All the guards<br/>\n&gt; that I can see at the gates will con me dubiously,<br/>\n&gt; but I have been afraid to enter(I am only level 5).<br/>\n&gt; Will all the guards in FP area regard me dubiously?<br/>\n&gt; And if I do make it over to BB, how do I elude the<br/>\n&gt; guards over near the docks of BB?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are ok in any part of freeport except north<br/>\nfreeport.
