To me the SK is a dastardly devil, cruel, <br/>\nruthless, and a true threat in battle.  But at higher levels he is weaker <br/>\nhand to hand than the warrior, as he should, and at all levels he is an <br/>\n(aguable) match to the paladin. I haven&#39;t met one that I haven&#39;t killed, if <br/>\nkilling the charecter was my intention.<br/>\n     The SK was never ment to go toe to toe with the light warrior, he was <br/>\nment to bide his time and strike when the paladin (or any one else) is the <br/>\nweakest, in battle with another foe, or with the SKs pet and shout <br/>\n&quot;Muhaaahahahahaa!!!&quot;  as the other player cries &quot;Why?  Why? I like Dark <br/>\nElves! Aiieeeee...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nahem<br/>\n<br/>\n    So, the bottom line is theatrics and role play.  One can play the <br/>\ndastardly fiend, or one cannot.  It is that simple.  If you seek a persona <br/>\nfor PK or staight war gaming, play a wizard or warrior.  Two dimmentions are <br/>\nfor you.  If you see your charecter as the Scourge of Freeport or The <br/>\nWarlord of Neriak , a charecter loved by friends and LOATHED by all others, <br/>\nthe SK is for you.<br/>\n    The key is Role Play not PK.  You will find that other players will not <br/>\nfeel so bad WHEN they die if they faced XILLITH, Lady of Pain and Dark <br/>\nDestroyer.  I even made some interracial friends by PKing them with an Erol <br/>\nFlynn air  &gt;:)   (even paladins...heh heh)  They come back for more and <br/>\nchallenge you to elaborate duels and grand wars.  I rescued one Paladin from <br/>\na kodiak only to let him die by my  hand because &quot;Only Innorruk deserves <br/>\nthey glory of this kill !!&quot; and he loved it!!<br/>\n    On a side note, only being looted by the one who kills you is nice.  I <br/>\ndespise looters.  If Xillith kills and loots your charecter expect an offer <br/>\nfor fair trade immediately, unless you are rude.  As the Bard Leatherwolfe <br/>\non Rallos Zek.  I killed her, with a buddy, and took her kite shield, (heh <br/>\nheh) a kite shield is quite the setback so i ofered to return it for trade.  <br/>\nI recieved a Mino axe for the shield and a tarnished spear, and gained a <br/>\nfriend to hunt in Lavastorm.  YEP, we hunted together.  Why not right?  <br/>\nInnorruk was sated.<br/>\n<br/>\n    So role play and love this class, it is the best.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Xillith, Lady of Pain<br/>\nDE Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
