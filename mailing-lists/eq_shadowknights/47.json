I am getting a new computer in a week and the<br/>\nfirst thing I going to do is to buy EverQuest.  I have<br/>\nmy heart set on playing as a Dark Elf Shadow Knight<br/>\nbecause they&#39;re the coolest. I would like to know if<br/>\nthis would be extremely different to do, especcially<br/>\nfor a newbie.  I do know a lot about the game though<br/>\nbecause my friend has it.  If anyone wants to tell me<br/>\nanything about the dark elf sk please do so.  I&#39;ll see<br/>\nyou all on the Tunare server in about a week or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nTekman (future Dark Elf Sk on Tunare)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
