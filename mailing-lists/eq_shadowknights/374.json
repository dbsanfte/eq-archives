I just recently found<br/>\nout that the Shadow Knight get Breath Of The Dead and Shadow Sight at level<br/>\n49. While Paladins get a new line of buff and Revive at level 49, SKs get<br/>\nspells that basically mimic a Greater Lighstone and a Fishbone Earring. Yes,<br/>\nthat is correct, my friends, after 49 levels of getting KOSed, experience<br/>\npenalties and sitting for hours to heal, we are rewarded with an enhancement<br/>\nto vision - ultravision that Dark Elves already have at level 1. And if one<br/>\nhas a Fishbone Earring, then &#39;Yay!&#39; for us because there goes another wasted<br/>\nslot in the book. In conclusion, at level 50, the Shadow Knight will have<br/>\nVoice Graft, Shieldskin, Breath Of The Dead and Shadow Sight that he/she<br/>\nwill never use.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
