A<br/>\nsingle deadly wepon is all that we should carry. I think a specialization in<br/>\none wepon skill would enhance this even firther. This would fit the Knight type<br/>\nof class quite well. We may be able to learn all types of wepons but<br/>\nspecialization in a single wepon as our main instrument of destruction!!! I<br/>\nlike this idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nTindaen of the Rathe server<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 4/26/99 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Howard Chan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hchan@...\">hchan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;No, I don&#39;t think we should get dual wield. It make us way too powerful. In<br/>\n&gt;addition, Paladins and SKs are more stereotyped to use two handed weapons<br/>\n&gt;than having a blade in each hand; thus, giving us dual wield would cause us<br/>\n&gt;to lose our uniqueness. I do think that we should get the Lifetap series and<br/>\n&gt;a 100% working HT though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Do you think Shadow Knights should get duel weild?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;ONElist has over 115,000 e-mail communities from which to chose!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you for contacting White Pine&#39;s Technical Support Department.
