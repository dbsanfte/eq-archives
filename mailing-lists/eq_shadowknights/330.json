Because we have a<br/>\npet, ~250 damage DoT (level 30 Darkness and Blood) and melee, Shadow Knights<br/>\ncan deal the most damage in the shortest amount of time compared with other<br/>\nhybrids. However, when one considers the amount of time the Shadow Knight<br/>\nneeds to heal after the battle, one would then see our weakness. Although<br/>\nwarriors has to do the same thing, they do not take an experience penalty.<br/>\nAt this point, one can clearly see that the Shadow Knight will take the<br/>\nlongest time to level up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to the above, I believe Xillith raised a good point about the<br/>\npet being jumped on by every monster in the dungeon. Most of us will agree<br/>\nthat the pet is completely useless in the dungeons, and might even get us<br/>\nkilled in the process. Now, take into consideration that the pet, who is<br/>\nsuppose to balance out the &#39;kick&#39; of a Ranger or Warrior, might also take<br/>\nsome of our experience along with them, one can then see that we got a class<br/>\nthat needs to be redone<br/>\n<br/>\nIn conclusion, take note of the following:<br/>\n- exp penalty<br/>\n- bad factions<br/>\n- useless pet indoors and somewhat outdoors<br/>\n- the only hybrid that cannot heal to compensate for the downtime<br/>\n- resistable HT<br/>\n- Darkness spells are resisted ALOT even on blues, more on yellows and reds<br/>\n(I had it resisted 4 out of 4 times on a low blue)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome may say it gets better on higher levels, but what I&#39;ve stated applies<br/>\nto all levels (and this same thing is said from another 48 Shadow Knight on<br/>\nthe same server, so all this is based on anything before the 49th level<br/>\nspells). Is it worth it to go on? I would not. But would one want all that<br/>\ntime that went into the SK to be wasted? No.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
