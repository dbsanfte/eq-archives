I<br/>\nhave run in to some major problems.  For some reason I don&#39;t seem to have<br/>\nmore than 10pp in the bank.  I do have a complete set of leather armor that<br/>\nisn&#39;t protecting me as well as it has been.  Anyway, I need banded armor and<br/>\nfigure the best way to make cash is hunting in fire storm, but the earth<br/>\nelemental I have to train back to the zone because I can&#39;t hurt them (oh, ya<br/>\nthe disease cloud spell really works well).  Any thoughts or suggestions<br/>\nwould be helpful. Because the only option I see is to go back and kill about<br/>\n400 fire beetles, which would really decimate the area in Neriak for the<br/>\nlower level people (unless they turn frenzy on again). I don&#39;t want to do<br/>\nthis, but if I did I would purchase 5 more backpacks and then start hunting.<br/>\nI did go up against a cutthroat yesterday and it about killed me (I will<br/>\nadmit it con even).  I had about 20 hp left and yes I found harm touch was<br/>\nresisted a bit, it only did 73pts damage against it (out of 140 it should<br/>\nhave done, which would have killed it).  OH, I am using a FS 2h sword, and I<br/>\nhave kept my 1h slash skill up.  So any type of weapon would work, I am<br/>\nwilling to work on blunt or puncture.  (and I don&#39;t like hunting in e-comm<br/>\nbecause of griffin KOS attitude)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, does anyone know someone selling small banded in Neriak/Freeport area<br/>\non the Tarew Marr server? And what are the prices?<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, any thoughts, suggestions or ideas would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nTenin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
