The bottom line is game ballance.  Why play any <br/>\n&gt; other class if you can get an instant dammage touch or full heal with <br/>\n&gt; a repertoire of spells and a 9+ level pet to boot??  Verrant has done <br/>\n&gt; well with game ballance.  What the charecters need now is some <br/>\n&gt; flavoring...<br/>\n&gt;      Consider this.  Paladinhood, Shadow standing, and even Ranger <br/>\n&gt; reputation should be a measure of player standing with their <br/>\n&gt; representative organizations.  If the standing gets too low, the grace <br/>\n&gt; of the specilty class is lost until attonement is completed, (ie a <br/>\n&gt; minor or major quest alone without the class powers to &quot;fix things&quot; <br/>\n&gt; with their own group.)<br/>\n&gt;    Why?  These classes are polarized in their alignment.  I have met <br/>\n&gt; too many Paladins, as a Shadow Knight, who were bigger jerks than I <br/>\n&gt; was attempting to be!  This is rediculous.  The dang Paladins are <br/>\n&gt; stealing our reputation!<br/>\n&gt;    If buffing the Shadow Knight is being considered to offset the Harm <br/>\n&gt; touch vs Lay Hands debate, I would recommend adding another class <br/>\n&gt; ability.  Aura of Fear, for those NPCs in combat against the SK who <br/>\n&gt; are not undead and an Aura of Courage for ALL members in the Paladins <br/>\n&gt; party.  A Fear spell could possibly spook a Paladin in battle with the <br/>\n&gt; SK following a failed Harm Touch and a successful (as it should be) <br/>\n&gt; Lay Hands.  For the ranger, perhaps an aura of Animal Friendship <br/>\n&gt; when partied with the Ranger?  Imagine being able to camp and NOT <br/>\n&gt; worry about Griffins pecking your head! An EQlizer if you will.

It make us way too <br/>\n&gt; powerful. In<br/>\n&gt; &gt;addition, Paladins and SKs are more stereotyped to use two handed <br/>\n&gt; weapons<br/>\n&gt; &gt;than having a blade in each hand; thus, giving us dual wield would <br/>\n&gt; cause us<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to lose our uniqueness.
