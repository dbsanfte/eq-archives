I honestly think that compared to the other hybrid classes with get a bit shorthanded in the field of spell casting.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf were are the &#39;opposing force&#39; to the paladins, shouldn&#39;t we have similar opposing forces?  Yes they have their healing touch and we have our harming touch. But what about their abilities and to cure and heal.  These are directly drawn upon from their cleric like nature.  Wouldn&#39;t it be more fair if we had similar spell abilities like the main theme of life draining spells that the necros get?  At least the weakest of them, like lifetap?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWell, its just my 2 cents worth.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nKeziah Tho&#39;tep, Servant of Innoruuk.\r<br/>\nBristleBain Server.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
