The bottom line is game ballance.  Why play any <br/>\nother class if you can get an instant dammage touch or full heal with <br/>\na repertoire of spells and a 9+ level pet to boot??  Verrant has done <br/>\nwell with game ballance.  What the charecters need now is some <br/>\nflavoring...<br/>\n     Consider this.  Paladinhood, Shadow standing, and even Ranger <br/>\nreputation should be a measure of player standing with their <br/>\nrepresentative organizations.  If the standing gets too low, the grace <br/>\nof the specilty class is lost until attonement is completed, (ie a <br/>\nminor or major quest alone without the class powers to &quot;fix things&quot; <br/>\nwith their own group.)<br/>\n   Why?  These classes are polarized in their alignment.  I have met <br/>\ntoo many Paladins, as a Shadow Knight, who were bigger jerks than I <br/>\nwas attempting to be!  This is rediculous.  The dang Paladins are <br/>\nstealing our reputation!<br/>\n   If buffing the Shadow Knight is being considered to offset the Harm <br/>\ntouch vs Lay Hands debate, I would recommend adding another class <br/>\nability.  Aura of Fear, for those NPCs in combat against the SK who <br/>\nare not undead and an Aura of Courage for ALL members in the Paladins <br/>\nparty.  A Fear spell could possibly spook a Paladin in battle with the <br/>\nSK following a failed Harm Touch and a successful (as it should be) <br/>\nLay Hands.  For the ranger, perhaps an aura of Animal Friendship <br/>\nwhen partied with the Ranger?  Imagine being able to camp and NOT <br/>\nworry about Griffins pecking your head! An EQlizer if you will.  Food <br/>\nfor thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, Hate you ALL!!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Xillith, Lady of Pain<br/>\nDE of Rallos Zek.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Howard Chan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hchan@...\">hchan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_shadowknights@onelist.com\">eq_shadowknights@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eq_shadowknights] Re: New Survey<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 26 Apr 1999 23:48:35 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Howard Chan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hchan@...\">hchan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;No, I don&#39;t think we should get dual wield.
