Not to mention our pets bite and usually get us <br/>\ninto trouble.  I have only cast my pet 4 times and I&#39;m past level 15.  We <br/>\nare 3/4 warrior and 1/4 Necro.  We&#39;re not supposed to be good at it.  Until <br/>\nyou get to level 22 the best spells that I have been ussing are Invis to <br/>\nUndead, Clinging Darkness(oh so great for fast creatures that tend to run <br/>\nwhen hp is low), Fear isn&#39;t too bad but I rarely use it, Shadow Step si <br/>\ngreat for fleeing, and Locate Corpse for yourself or for anyone you want to <br/>\nhelp out.  Just keep in mine that your pet is usually half your level and is <br/>\nusually a speed bump to the creature you fight.  Just some of my thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrumbel<br/>\nTroll Shadow Knight<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
