What are fellow travelers for, if <br/>\nnot to help one another out in a pinch?  When I get there, to erudin, <br/>\nand hopefully that will be soon, whatever you require you shall have!  <br/>\n(After all, the more mentally fortunate should always help those poor <br/>\ndemented, lesser souls such as yourself.)  And then, it&#39;s off to see the <br/>\nworld.  Hopefully when I arrive some more worthies will have joined me, <br/>\nhaving themselves been smitten by the same wanderlust that I feel.  I <br/>\nfeel now, and always have felt, that a good team, working together can <br/>\novercome any obstacle; even the dementia of some of its members, hehe.<br/>\nPrepare yourself, I am coming!<br/>\nZardoz, the Great High Elven Mage<br/>\n<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
