This was done on another server and was a rousing success.  <br/>\nI would like feedback on this; I am going to schedule for this Sunday <br/>\nthe 25th at 12 noon PST.  All good-aligned citizens of Norrath would <br/>\nbe invited to trade or buy goods.  Hopefully this way we can bring in <br/>\nsome rare items from the far reaches of Antonica as well as Faydwer <br/>\nand Odus.  I will be checking the replies compulsively and replying <br/>\nto anyone who would like to help expand the scope of this event.  Do <br/>\nOOCs in every zone you are in, no matter where you are, as this way <br/>\nwe can get the participation of those who do not check EQvault or the <br/>\nBristlebane mailing list.  Here are the specs:<br/>\n<br/>\n               North Qeynos Auction/Trade Show<br/>\n               <br/>\n               Server: Bristlebane <br/>\n               Date:  Sunday, April 25th @ 12 noon PST<br/>\n               Location: Outside North Gate of Qeynos<br/>\n               <br/>\n               All good-aligned citizens of Norrath are welcome<br/>\n               Bring any items that you think will be good sellers,<br/>\n               as well as LOTS of money to buy the neat things that<br/>\n               your fellow adventurers will have.
