The Shady Swashbuckler<br/>\nis indifferent to pretty much anyone, and will trade with anyone from a<br/>\nhigh elf paladin to a dark elf shadow knight, he&#39;s not picky.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get to around 20th any time soon, give me a yell, I&#39;ll hunt with<br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing - why do people in the Oasis insist on training sand<br/>\ngiants into other people before they die? Can&#39;t they have the good<br/>\ngrace to just die AWAY from the medditating mages?

I am a Dark Elf Necromancer<br/>\n&gt; and go at will between the<br/>\n&gt; two zones via this tunnel.  I&#39;ve even traded with<br/>\n&gt; the only NPC there and<br/>\n&gt; have not been attacked.  A gnome such as yourself<br/>\n&gt; should be more liked than<br/>\n&gt; me, thus I don&#39;t think you should have any problem. <br/>\n&gt; Thus your only concern<br/>\n&gt; is getting through Freeport to the tunnel, which<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t very hard either.  If<br/>\n&gt; you have Gather Shadows, then use it and you won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have to worry about<br/>\n&gt; guards or any other Freeport citizen.  Head south<br/>\n&gt; from the South gate of<br/>\n&gt; Freeport (actually within East Freeport zone) and<br/>\n&gt; enter North Ro, then<br/>\n&gt; follow the right zone wall and you&#39;ll find the<br/>\n&gt; tunnel easily.  Keep going<br/>\n&gt; until you find an open area with the Swashbuckler<br/>\n&gt; inside (and hopefully<br/>\n&gt; everyone else that is there to trade).  The<br/>\n&gt; alternate route is to stay<br/>\n&gt; invisible and make your way from East Freeport to<br/>\n&gt; West Freeport and then to<br/>\n&gt; East Commonlands where you can follow the left zone<br/>\n&gt; wall and you&#39;ll find the<br/>\n&gt; tunnel inset in a hill.  Shouldn&#39;t be too hard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Kendrath<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
