Sorry for the list,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2059681800\">Hello everyone. I play a level 4 mage (seemingly the only class on this <br/>\nmailing list) <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I am a level9 Shaman!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and I have a few questions about spells and such. Sorry for the <br/>\nlist, but it&#39;s the easiest way to get it across. <br/>\n1. Since you can only use Bind Affinity at level 12, are you basically stuck<br/>\n<br/>\nin your home town until then? I find this hard to believe, since warriors <br/>\nmight not be able to cast it, but some people have said this to be true.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;That is correct.  But, you are not limited to staying at home, just limit<br/>\n </span></blockquote>how far you go in your travels.  If that&#39;s Erudin, then  yeah, maybe you are<br/>\nstuck at home.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I started training in piercing, and lately I&#39;ve seen most fellow Erudites<br/>\n<br/>\ncarrying staffs or clubs. Was this a mistake? Does it even matter latter on,<br/>\n<br/>\nas you&#39;ll be fighting in a group and not using melee weapons?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I think that is right too.  At higher levels you wont care about melee<br/>\n </span></blockquote>at all I think.  Then again, I&#39;ve never played a wizard.  My shaman can<br/>\nfight melee pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Hey, where&#39;s the music?!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I think I&#39;ve heard that music is only set up for SBLive and &quot;SoundFont&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>cards.  However, I saw a post that they will soon release a patch so it<br/>\nworks with other sound cards as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all. Any help will be greatly appreciated. <br/>\n<br/>\nIzin<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nHave you visited our new web site?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nOnelist: Helping to create Internet communities</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
