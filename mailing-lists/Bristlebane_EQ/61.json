There is a guard at the port who has forgotten more knowledge<br/>\nthat you&#39;ll ever know.  It will just get worse for you from there my friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will find me in and around the city of Erudin.  Alas, I fell foul of the<br/>\nlocal heavy yesterday night, and I have lost a sizeable some of monies.  My<br/>\nquest for adventure will have to go on hold for a while. (OOC: Not only<br/>\nthat, it&#39;s taking forever to level, so I&#39;m too weak to travel as yet)<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to seeing you in person my friend.  I will be glad to offer<br/>\nmy shoulder for you to cry on when the truth hits.<br/>\n<br/>\nItan the Whistler</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
