Age is no guarantee of intellect.  Face it Elf,\r<br/>\nErud and all his followers have perfected the art of magic to a degree that\r<br/>\nyou can simply never achieve.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe are more intelligent than you, get over it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt is good to see, however, that even less intelligent people like yourself\r<br/>\ncan see the necros for what they are.  They should all be rounded up and\r<br/>\nburned in the eternal fire of Solusek&#39;s wrath.  Perhaps you would like to\r<br/>\nhelp gather wood for the pyre?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEnough idle chatter, I have work to be done.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYour Superior,\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nItan the Whistler.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOOC: I&#39;ll add you to my friends list and hope are paths cross at some point.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
