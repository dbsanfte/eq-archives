<div id="ygrps-yiv-288118090">For some reason the onlist made my account so it bounced, therefor it quit <br/>
sending me mail to all of my mailing list on onelist, arrrgggghhhh.  I was <br/>
wondering if everyone died, or maybe was gettting to play EQ more than I was ;) <br/>
So here is the favor, and help that I am asking, could someone please send me <br/>
the digests that I missed?  The last mail I recieved was monday.  Could someone <br/>
who gets this in digest form send me the digests from 14 and up don&#92;&#39;t worry <br/>
about multiple people sending this to me, I know how to delete any extras :)  <br/>
Your help is greatly appreciated<br/>
