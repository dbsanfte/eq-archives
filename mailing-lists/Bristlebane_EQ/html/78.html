<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110199785">Oh I hate boats too.  The first time I took a boat I had my 6th level wizard<br/>
and I had about 10 pieces of cloth armor, great staff... the works.  I took<br/>
a ride to qeynos only to be killed by a shark through the boat.  i lost<br/>
everything.  In dismay I made a new character, an enchater.  I got to forth<br/>
level, bought a guild tunic for 8g and set off for Qeynos, on my way back I<br/>
was memorizing spells and all of a sudden I was attacked by a fire elemental<br/>
and a zombie salior.  I died and lost everything.  I was told that a GM<br/>
would be notified, that was last friday and I have heard nothing.  I have<br/>
been so unhappy.<br/>

forever.  -- The Crow<br/>
