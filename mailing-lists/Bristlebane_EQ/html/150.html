<b>Subject:</b> Bristlebane North Qeynos Auction/Trade Show <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-439255573">I am going to see how many people we can get to participate in an <br/>
outdoor auction/trade show near the city of Qeynos on the Bristlebane <br/>
server.  This was done on another server and was a rousing success.  <br/>
I would like feedback on this; I am going to schedule for this Sunday <br/>
the 25th at 12 noon PST.  All good-aligned citizens of Norrath would <br/>
be invited to trade or buy goods.  Hopefully this way we can bring in <br/>
some rare items from the far reaches of Antonica as well as Faydwer <br/>
and Odus.  I will be checking the replies compulsively and replying <br/>
to anyone who would like to help expand the scope of this event.  Do <br/>
OOCs in every zone you are in, no matter where you are, as this way <br/>
we can get the participation of those who do not check EQvault or the <br/>
Bristlebane mailing list.  Here are the specs:<br/>

               All good-aligned citizens of Norrath are welcome<br/>
               Bring any items that you think will be good sellers,<br/>
               as well as LOTS of money to buy the neat things that<br/>
               your fellow adventurers will have.  See you there!!<br/>
