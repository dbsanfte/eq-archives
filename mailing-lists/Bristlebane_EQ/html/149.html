 </span></blockquote>You make some excellent points here Rebecca, and I think I&#39;m going to have<br/>
to relent on it. It really is little more than a personal ethic and belief<br/>
more so than any actually defensible position.  I myself believe that you<br/>
will come out better in the long run in helping people, but for those that<br/>
wish to attempt to make a profit off of it, I really don&#39;t have a leg to<br/>
stand on in saying this is &#39;WRONG&#39;.  <br/>
<br/>
I do think that people whom take advantage of a persons generosity are<br/>
wrong and are being rude, but once again, this is little more than pushing<br/>
my own opinions and world views upon them. Which is never a wise idea.<br/>
