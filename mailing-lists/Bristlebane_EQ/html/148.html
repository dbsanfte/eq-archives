<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253127828"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: JW IV &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:phule@...">phule@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can&#39;t help but feel greatly aggravated at the number of people who sit<br/>
&gt;there and camp at the ruins in the hopes of taking advantage of monks who<br/>
&gt;desperately need putrid rib bones. I find this amazingly lame.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I personally find it interesting. Free enterprise at work. It is lame if it<br/>
gets to the point that they are stealing kills from monks and then trying<br/>
to sell them back to the monks. That&#39;s taking advantage.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It ranks up<br/>
&gt;there with clerics charging for heals and other such things.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why does this bother you? You are asking a favor of somebody. You don&#39;t<br/>
have to pay. Clerics aren&#39;t there for your convience. How about charging<br/>
for binding?  Or having somebody help find your corpse? Is this lame as<br/>
well? I can understand that it would be lame if the cleric is in your own<br/>
party and charges you. I would dump that party member awful quick. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It&#39;s like a tank charging to party with you or some other such nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, its like paying a tank to take something out for you if you can&#39;t and<br/>
they aren&#39;t in your party. I believe the difference lies in whether you are<br/>
partied or not. One is working for the profit of the whole, the other is a<br/>
favor. I once died in a very sticky situation and there was no way I&#39;ld<br/>
every be able to retrieve my stuff. I had a tank go in and get it for me,<br/>
and glady payed the individual (even though they didn&#39;t ask), knowing that<br/>
it wasn&#39;t something they particularly wanted to do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Those clerics who do keep it free have my undying loyalty.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am a cleric and I gladly heal for free. And undying loyalty is greatly<br/>
appreciated as well :) It&#39;s part of the reason I chose to be a cleric. You<br/>
always have a friend. However, I&#39;ve encountered players who seem to think<br/>
that&#39;s all I do, or that I somehow *owe* them. I&#39;ll be kneedeep in gnolls<br/>
in black burrow, mana half gone, in a party, and get a tell &quot;Can you heal<br/>
me?&quot; When I finally meet up with the individual all they need is to be<br/>
&quot;topped off&quot; hp-wise. &lt;grrr&gt; It&#39;s repeat cases with individuals like these<br/>
that I&#39;ll ask for donations :)<br/>
<br/>
As long as they aren&#39;t screwing other people in the process, I feel that if<br/>
people have a service other people want, I think its their perogative to<br/>
charge for it.<br/>
