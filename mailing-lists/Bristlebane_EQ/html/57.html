Minotaur&#39;s Lament<br/>
<br/>
The cave opened wide before the fellowship.  Not far within, the mountain<br/>
swallowed up the path into a maze of tunnels and caverns.  The land outside<br/>
was broken by deep ravines and high, steep hills.  The fellowship stood just<br/>
outside the mouth of the cave peering in.<br/>
&quot;I see nothing,&quot; said Lindale as he looked into the cave with his keen Wood<br/>
Elven eyes.<br/>
&quot;Shall we go?&quot; asked Drugas, the stout Dwarf.<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not so sure of this,&quot; said Derkahn.  He knew that should the fellowship<br/>
find the danger that it sought, he would be chosen as a prime target because<br/>
he was a High Elf.<br/>
&quot;If we&#39;re going to do this, let&#39;s have it done and be over with it,&quot; replied<br/>
Xtarii the small yet powerful Gnome.<br/>
&quot;I agree,&quot; spoke Kaolas.<br/>
They slowly, but surely moved inside the cave.  The light outside was lost a<br/>
few feet within and darkness swallowed them.  They went on, deeper into the<br/>
cave.  His eyes adjusting quickly, Lindale said, &quot;Quiet everyone.  Something<br/>
approaches.&quot;  Quickly Lindale lowered himself to the ground and listened to<br/>
what rumors the earth would tell.<br/>
&quot;I feel it in my bones, there is something near and I like it not,&quot; Falyen<br/>
hoarsely whispered.<br/>
Suddenly they were all aware of a snorting and stomping as the unknown<br/>
creature approached.  Then, all went quiet.<br/>
&quot;He knows we are here,&quot; Kaolas said, slightly within the hearing of the rest<br/>
of the fellowship.<br/>
Lindale quietly rose from the floor of the cave and moved forward,<br/>
carefully, a few steps.  He smelled it.  It was very near.  The stench was<br/>
something between the farm animals he saw when he had visited the human<br/>
settlements many years ago and the vile orcs of Crushbone.  He backed away<br/>
swiftly yet quietly and rejoined his party.<br/>
Just as he returned and began to tell them what he thought the beast was,<br/>
there was no need.  Around the corner emerged a huge beast.  Half man, half<br/>
Bull.  He turned quickly and faced the party.  They could see that he was<br/>
not afraid.  Studying them for a moment he paused.  Neither adversary moved,<br/>
both considering the eminent battle ahead.  Then, with lightning quick<br/>
speed, the Minotaur lurched forward and charge the adventurers.<br/>
&quot;Stand firm!&quot; shouted Drugas as he prepared himself for the coming<br/>
onslaught.<br/>
The battle began.  Quickly the fellowship realized exactly what they were up<br/>
against.  The minotaur&#39;s blows found their way home and Drugas winced in<br/>
pain.  His sturdy armor receiving a shock that before it had not know.  With<br/>
all their might, the group defended themselves as well as dealing what<br/>
damage they could to the minotaur.  Slowly, the tide changed and the<br/>
minotaur was receiving the worst of it.  His sides were rent and bleeding.<br/>
He had lost one horn to the sharp blade of Drugas.  He was about to fall<br/>
when he called back into the recesses of the cave.<br/>
&quot;I FALL SOON!  COME!&quot; screamed the minotaur with his last breath as the<br/>
spear of Lindale pierced his throat.<br/>
Staggering backward, the dwarf said &quot;That didn&#39;t sound good.&quot;<br/>
How right he was.  Suddenly, with no previous warning, another minotaur came<br/>
charging around the corner.  He was not alone.  Three minotaurs were now<br/>
charging the fellowship and the future looked ill.<br/>
Just as quickly as the previous battle had ended, the new one sprung up in<br/>
its place.  Exhausted and weakened by the first fight, the party put<br/>
everything they had into one of the minotaurs.  Fighting for their life,<br/>
their berserker style of last effort took down one of the minotaurs.<br/>
Having spent all his mana, Falyen had entered into the fray.  He did well at<br/>
the start, but soon, the third minotaur realized him and drew off his attack<br/>
on Lindale and turned to Falyen.  He did not stand long.  This brief moment<br/>
was all that was needed for Derkahn, the powerful magician.  With a burst of<br/>
fire and a loud scream, the second minotaur fell, never to wake again.  The<br/>
party turned their attention to the last minotaur and with speed<br/>
surprisingly fast after such a battle, the minotaur turned and ran deep into<br/>
the cave.<br/>
The adventurers did not follow far before the minotaur was returning.<br/>
Again, he was not alone.  A mighty chieftain of the minotaurs was with him.<br/>
Much taller and stronger he was, and armed with a mighty axe.  The chieftain<br/>
charged, the smaller minotaur by his side.  Knowing that they could not<br/>
destroy the chieftain if the lesser minotaur remained, the party focused on<br/>
finishing him.  Quickly this was done by the swift axe of Kaolas.  The party<br/>
was now wounded, weakened and on their last legs.  Turning to the great<br/>
chieftain, Drugar began the final stand.  Cleaving the shield of Drugas, the<br/>
minotaur put all his weight down on him.  Drugas knew his end was near.  But<br/>
against all hope, new life surged into his limbs and he gained strength.<br/>
Kaolas had backed off from the fight and was singing a hymn of restoration.<br/>
The party realizing that this was their chance, redoubled their efforts and<br/>
soon the great chieftain was falling back, stumbling with the effort of<br/>
standing before such a great and unexpected effort.  Hewing limb from limb,<br/>
Drugas laid waste to the chieftain and he fell.<br/>
They had won. But not without a price.  Falyen and Derkahn had fallen and<br/>
Lindale was gravely wounded.  Drugas, being a paladin laid hands on Lindale<br/>
and revived him, but was greatly drained because of the effort.  Lifting the<br/>
mighty axe from the ground where it had fallen, Kaolas hewed the other horn<br/>
from the beast put it in his pouch.  Turning to Drugas, he presented the axe<br/>
to him and said,   &quot;I believe that this belongs to you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The End.</div>
