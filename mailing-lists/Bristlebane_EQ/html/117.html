<div id="ygrps-yiv-678927701">OK, here is the FULL scoop on this.<br/>
<br/>
Halflings have the *racial ability* to sneak and hide.  I don&#39;t know what<br/>
&quot;skill level&quot; this translates to, but for illustration lets say it is 75.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on your class, you may or may not get the *class ability* to sneak<br/>
and hide.  If your class does get it, it will be at a certain level (your<br/>
guild trainers will show you what level) and you cannot put more practices<br/>
into it until that level.  Furthermore, using the skill will not increase the<br/>
skill until such a time as your class gets the skill.  Argh, hope I&#39;m being<br/>
clear.<br/>
<br/>
More on this... lets say you have the racial skill at 75, and your class gets<br/>
the ability to learn the skill at level 10.  At level 10 the skill would be<br/>
capped at (level*5)+5 or 55.  So even though at 10th level your guild will now<br/>
train you in it, they wont because you are already maxed out in it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know any of the specific numbers, nor how often this wierd stuff<br/>
happens (although there are a number of races that get sneak or hide), but<br/>
this is how it has been explained to me.  Use the skill if it helps you, but<br/>
don&#39;t expect it to improve at all until such a time as your guild would train<br/>
you in it.<br/>
