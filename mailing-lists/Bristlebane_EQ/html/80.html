I can only share with you my experience, but from what it sounds like there&#39;s <br/>
a simple fix - get bound to Freeport, find a nice big group that needs a <br/>
cleric like yourself, and go hunting tarantulas and mummies in the desert. <br/>
Ward undead works well in this case, and there are many groups formed all of <br/>
the time by the fishing huts. As for getting bound, ask Drugar, he bound me <br/>
to Freeport for only a platinum (and had the kindness to wait while I <br/>
stumbled about the maze that is Freeport city). If you do venture into the <br/>
deserts, I warn you to watch out for that character Dorn. He beat me up good, <br/>
and his buddies didn&#39;t look very friendly either. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
