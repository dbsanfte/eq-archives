<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865272154">I respect your views on this list, and I hope you respect mine.  Therefore I<br/>
will alter how I use it.<br/>
<br/>
I refuse to cease RP on this list (and that is what it has been, although at<br/>
a basic level), but I will refrain from idle chatter.  I hope this will<br/>
allow you to continue using it.<br/>
<br/>
I will, where possible be in character, and therefore my characters opinions<br/>
will be evident.  Erudites ARE arrogant and consider themselves above other<br/>
races.  They have no time for fools, and will therefore not always be<br/>
friendly towards others.<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind, there are a lot of new people coming into the game every day,<br/>
and I hope that the mindless banter gives them an idea of how the races<br/>
COULD interact (I would not be so arrogant myself as to presume that my<br/>
interpretation is the correct one.  Itan would of course).<br/>

P.S.<br/>
<br/>
It is not a hatred of other races (at least not all of them), merely a<br/>
disrespect.</div>
