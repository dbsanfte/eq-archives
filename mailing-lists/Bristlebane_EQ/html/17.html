&gt; Hello everyone. I play a level 4 mage (seemingly the only class on this<br/>
&gt; mailing list) and I have a few questions about spells and such. Sorry for the<br/>
&gt; list, but it&#39;s the easiest way to get it across.<br/>
&gt; 1. Since you can only use Bind Affinity at level 12, are you basically stuck<br/>
&gt; in your home town until then? I find this hard to believe, since warriors<br/>
&gt; might not be able to cast it, but some people have said this to be true.<br/>
&gt; 2. I started training in piercing, and lately I&#39;ve seen most fellow Erudites<br/>
&gt; carrying staffs or clubs. Was this a mistake? Does it even matter latter on,<br/>
&gt; as you&#39;ll be fighting in a group and not using melee weapons?<br/>
&gt; 3. Hey, where&#39;s the music?!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s all. Any help will be greatly appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Izin<br/>
