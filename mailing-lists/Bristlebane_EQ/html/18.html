<div id="ygrps-yiv-145345623">Hail and well met, fellow Bristlebane citizens. Warriors too can learn the uses of mailing lists.  My beloved daughter, Luana, is a level 6 half elf warrior who is exploring her  heritage among the beautiful tree city of Kelethin.  She is an aspiring smith and a brave, albeit foolish, &quot;tank&quot;.  Some believe her to have missed her calling by not being a monk as she loves to battle hand to hand almost as much as she loves to wield her blade.<br/>
<br/>
Luana is but one of my family of daring females.  Ella, an aspiring high elf wizard, is also roaming the continent of Faydwer as are Ivory (high elf cleric), Honi (wood elf bard), Garnet (wood elf ranger), Fini (high elf enchanter), Kachine (dwarf cleric) and Jacey (wood elf druid).  Needless to say, some are seen less frequently than others but eventually all will have their day in the limelight.<br/>
<br/>
Also, most will be learning a valuable trade.  Unfortunately, I have not been able to teach them the ways of commerce because the usually give away more than the sell.  Ivory is a prime example of that.  Many a brave soul is adventuring with bits and pieces of patchwork made by her delicate hands and given freely as a gift.  Oh well, if it brings her pleasure to give and be broke then that is her concern I suppose.  At least that is what she believes.<br/>
<br/>
The girls know it is possible to roam to other continents even without the binding to another city as their friend, Kaolas, hails from the continent of Antonica and met Ella through an unfortunate encounter with an orc pawn beneath the city in the trees on Faydwer.  The journey can be long and arduous if one is not bound to a city on the continent where one is adventuring and most will soon want to befriend someone who can perform this service for them.<br/>
<br/>
Please, watch for my girls, they are frequently lost and/or in over their heads in a battle best left for a future time.  For some odd reason I have not been able to instill a fear of death into any of them.  Tsk, tsk, when will children learn to listen to their mother?<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting and stay safe,<br/>
