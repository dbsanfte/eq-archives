<div id="ygrps-yiv-450461746">Please tell... What do you mean by this?  It seems you are saying that<br/>
Enchanters frequent HighPass?  Beginning at level 8?  Why in the world would<br/>
a level 8 character of ANY type want to frequent HighPass?  Is this &quot;an<br/>
enchanter thing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Or unless your an enchanter in which case you frequent highpass hold<br/>
(starting at level 8ish) and have already checked out all this stuff and<br/>
spent alot of time playing unsucessfully. =)<br/>

&gt; It seems to me that a lot of things are only to be found in HighPass.....<br/>
&gt; And since that is such a darn terrible place... of course that means this<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; by design.  We aren&#39;t intended to know these things until we can safely<br/>
&gt; travel that zone.<br/>
