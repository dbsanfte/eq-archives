<b>Subject:</b> Itan introduces himself.  Of course, you are listening. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065302123">I am Itan the Whistler.<br/>
<br/>
I hail from Erudin, where I have recently began plying my trade as a wizard.<br/>
<br/>
Although I am, as you all are, of humble beginnings, I am so intelligent that I simply cannot fail to become the mightiest wizard that ever walked the lands of Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
If you are Erudite, and are not a death peddling Necro, then you may count me as a friend.  My ears are always open, and my powers are at your service.<br/>
<br/>
If you are of the lesser races, then bow before my mighty intellect and humble thyself appropriately.<br/>
<br/>
If you are a Necro of any race, then I swear to smite you and all your family from Norrath in due course.<br/>
<br/>
Remember my name.  One day it will matter.</div>
