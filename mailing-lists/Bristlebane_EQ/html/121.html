<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671139123">I&#39;ve been progressing through levels at a pretty good clip, I got 3 levels<br/>
over the weekend and picked a fourth up last night.  That puts me at 11<br/>
and half way through 12.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve not been able to get online for a week or so (except email), due to<br/>
&gt; moving house, and I feel a bit out of touch.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My character is still a lowly 3rd level Erudite Wizard, due to limited<br/>
&gt; playing time, but it has taken a lot more work than my beta character did<br/>
&gt; (Barby Shamen).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How are you all finding progression?  I&#39;m in no great hurry, and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; certainly not a power player, but I get the feeling that some class/race<br/>
&gt; combos have a much easier time of it than others, perhaps too much for<br/>
&gt; balance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know the hybrid classes have to earn more experience, but does anyone know<br/>
&gt; any details?<br/>
