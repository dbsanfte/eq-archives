<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834919775">There is to be an Enlightenment Gathering on the Bristlebane server on<br/>
Sunday, June 13th in the ever-popular Tunnel to North Ro Desert in the East<br/>
Commonlands. The events will commence 3:00 PM Pacific (5:00 PM Central). All<br/>
races and classes are welcomed to come and share in this festival of<br/>
knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
(So far these are the events planned to take place. More may be added later.<br/>
The information for this gathering will be updated daily at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stonepool.com/hands.">http://www.stonepool.com/hands.</a> This event is sponsored by a newly forming<br/>
guild, The Hands of Quellious.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Philosophy Discussion<br/>
<br/>
All are invited to debate in a somewhat ordered discussion of the gods, war,<br/>
ignorance, and other important issues. (Of course this will be done in<br/>
character and will be a great opportunity for role-playing. We wish to also<br/>
argue some of the player written Norrathian history contained on the web<br/>
page above.)<br/>
<br/>
Trade Discussion<br/>
<br/>
We will devote a bit of time talking about each trade, including research.<br/>
Hopefully we will answer any questions and peak the interest of those who<br/>
havenï¿½t discovered the wonders of the different trades. (If you wish to lead<br/>
the discussion of a particular trade, especially if you are experienced,<br/>
please contact me, I will post a running list on the web page in a few<br/>
days.)<br/>
<br/>
Language Lessons<br/>
<br/>
This will mainly be devoted to sharing the normal race languages so that we<br/>
may all understand each other better. Any citizens wishing to share their<br/>
knowledge of the elder languages is certainly welcomed hold free classes,<br/>
but we ask that there be no selling of languages. Participants my tip their<br/>
teachers but (If you wish to share your language please contact me, I will<br/>
post a running list on the web page in a few days.)<br/>
<br/>
Scavenger Hunt<br/>
<br/>
This will be for some of our younger attendees (anyone 7th level or lower).<br/>
Participants may form groups if desired but must share their prize. All the<br/>
items will be found close to the tunnel (only in the zones adjacent to the<br/>
east commons). There will be prizes for all that partake in this quest.<br/>
(There will be a story to go with the hunt.)<br/>
<br/>
Open Market<br/>
<br/>
And of course as with every event in Norrath, there will be the selling of<br/>
goods. We would like mainly self-made goods to be sold here. Though the<br/>
selling of acquired items is not prohibited, we encourage tradesmen to make<br/>
a bigger showing. (The method of sales will be announced later on the web<br/>
page.)<br/>
