<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217485486">Hail, I am Dhimmid deThon a budding master of the Elemental Arts.<br/>
<br/>
I have toiled at the Art for many years now, and my hunger and desire for<br/>
further Mastery<br/>
still burns at my core.  My guildmaster is hard but fair.  He keeps my<br/>
development slow to<br/>
ensure that my desire for power will only come with a true respect for that<br/>
which may be<br/>
wrought from it.  For that I am thankful.<br/>
<br/>
I am of the 5th circle (lv 16)  within my Guild.  I can be found many aday<br/>
studying and experimenting<br/>
within the hall of the Academy in Freeport.  But I also take childlike pleasure<br/>
in exploring, and<br/>
have recently begun to find mastery over elementals throughout Norrath that have<br/>
overcome<br/>
their masters to break those tentative bonds that we magicians hold sway upon<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I feel it is also time for me to take on an apprentice.  My guildmaster says<br/>
that it will help me learn<br/>
compassion and help to gain further understanding in areas of knowledge that I<br/>
mayhap only<br/>
perused upon in the past (my unyielding desire to come of age, no doubt!).  My<br/>
apprentice must<br/>
have a good and open heart and a desire to open all doors allowed us as<br/>
magicians.  He can<br/>
be of any race, for my spirit is touched not by the despicable hand of prejudice<br/>
( I see that humans<br/>
may well be the ONLY race not mired by that foul characteristics).  I ask only<br/>
that he or she also<br/>
hold their tongue in regards to any prejudiced remarks or situations.  I shall<br/>
not tolerate babblings<br/>
of prejudice, our time upon Norrath is too short to be mired by such idiocy!<br/>
<br/>
I would prefer, for now, that the apprentice either be based out of Freeport, or<br/>
willing to move here.<br/>
I have but meager lodgings to offer my apprentice, and will not be a crutch for<br/>
him/her.  I believe too<br/>
strongly that experience in Norrath is our greatest teacher.  As I have been<br/>
guided by experience, so<br/>
shall my apprentice.  I will rather, give guidance in all things of the Art that<br/>
I know.  I will occasionally<br/>
introduce new game to my apprentice in a controlled environment, as well as<br/>
offering rewards for<br/>
tasks completed (my disgression of course).<br/>
<br/>
If there are aspiring magicians in this land that would like to spend a time<br/>
learning, please call<br/>
out to me here.<br/>
<br/>
Dhimmid deThon, Defender of the Art.</div>
