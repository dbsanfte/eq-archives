&gt;That is an excellent idea.  Very well, ALL races, regardless of color<br/>
&gt;=) or alignment are hereby formally invited to the North Qeynos<br/>
&gt;Auction/Trade show this Sunday @ 12PM PST.  Thank you very much.  See<br/>
&gt;you there!  Any magic users able to cast invisibility are appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No problem. : )<br/>

If you haven&#39;t already, it would be great to send this to eqvault, eq<br/>
stratics and eq-online... (I haven&#39;t checked their site in a few days...<br/>
sorry if you have already.)<br/>
