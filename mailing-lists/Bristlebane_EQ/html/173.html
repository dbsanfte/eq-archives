<div id="ygrps-yiv-381248302"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Anyone know if there is a real difference between<br/>
&gt; the various elemental <br/>
&gt; summons magicians can get?   For example, is the<br/>
&gt; Earth Elemental any stronger <br/>
&gt; than say a Fire Elemental? Or does it have better<br/>
&gt; defense? And whats the <br/>
&gt; strong points and advantages of a Wind or Water<br/>
&gt; Elemental<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok... earth elementals have the most hit points, but<br/>
generally are the weakest offensively; fire elementals<br/>
are the best offensively but generally have the fewest<br/>
hit points; airs are generally the best defensively,<br/>
and have hit points and offense somewhere in the<br/>
middle... also airs have a nasty habit of casting<br/>
invisibility on themselves (which serves no useful<br/>
purpose that I can see, and makes it durn hard to know<br/>
when they have stopped following you... as pets<br/>
frequently do). Waters... I really have no experience<br/>
with, so can&#39;t really comment on them.<br/>
