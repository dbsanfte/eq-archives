<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038989776">An update from your friendly Dwarfen Cleric Vrachit. I finally made<br/>
level 7! As the previous advice suggested, I finally found a kind L17<br/>
cleric named Zebediah who bound me to east Freeport. I managed to help<br/>
lead some parties in the east Commonlands and will the final strike on<br/>
a Giant Scarab I obtained the 7th order of the Cleric Order. Nothing<br/>
much happens there but I had been stuck on 6 so long it was a welcome<br/>
change. Now I can&#39;t wait til 8 so I can meditate and 9 where I start<br/>
getting some cool spells.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;m trying to raise the coin to purchase a sewing kit so I<br/>
can try my hand at making patchwork armor. I&#39;m a little low on the AC<br/>
for a Cleric of my size and could certainly use the help. Does anyone<br/>
recommend using my coin to buy the higher order armor for now or wait<br/>
until higher levels where I can generate a little more coin and just<br/>
save my coin now for spells at level 9? Any suggestions are certainly<br/>
welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Your humble Cleric,<br/>
<br/>
Vrachit<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Greetings everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is your friendly neighborhood Dwarfen Cleric,<br/>
&gt; Vrachit. Just wanted<br/>
&gt; to say hello and also ask if others are finding it<br/>
&gt; as hard as I am from<br/>
&gt; level 6 and up. I am 6 now and having hard time<br/>
&gt; finding good things to<br/>
&gt; kill or parties to kill them will. I am often found<br/>
&gt; in freeport but<br/>
&gt; spend most of my time in Butcherblock, as it is<br/>
&gt; easier to fetch my<br/>
&gt; corpse (which I seem to be doing a lot of lately).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any advice you have for this struggling healer would<br/>
&gt; be most<br/>
&gt; appreciated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
