<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394416132">I too must sing the praises of Drugar!  He also did a &quot;Bind&quot; for me <br/>
and it has helped immensely.  I must warn you though, if you decide to <br/>
hunt the common lands, do so after you have a &quot;bind&quot; done: the <br/>
Griffons strike without warning and do more damage than guards do in a <br/>
single swipe of their claws!  I have been felled 4 times by Griffons, <br/>
but thanks to Drugar, it was no major catastrophe, only a minor <br/>
inconvenience.  Good Luck! and Fare Thee Well!<br/>

Fellow troubled cleric,<br/>
<br/>
I can only share with you my experience, but from what it sounds like <br/>
there&#39;s <br/>
a simple fix - get bound to Freeport, find a nice big group that needs <br/>
a <br/>
cleric like yourself, and go hunting tarantulas and mummies in the <br/>
desert. <br/>
Ward undead works well in this case, and there are many groups formed <br/>
all of <br/>
the time by the fishing huts. As for getting bound, ask Drugar, he <br/>
bound me <br/>
to Freeport for only a platinum (and had the kindness to wait while I <br/>
stumbled about the maze that is Freeport city). If you do venture into <br/>
the <br/>
deserts, I warn you to watch out for that character Dorn. He beat me <br/>
up good, <br/>
and his buddies didn&#39;t look very friendly either. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
Fenwen <br/>
