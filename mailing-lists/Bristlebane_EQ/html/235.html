<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783568756">Aye, I was hunting in the Oasis when they started concoting the plan to<br/>
kill the giants, can&#39;t think who it was who thought it up in the first<br/>
place though... Personally, even though I didn&#39;t attack the giants, I<br/>
loved it - the beach was empty! All the deepwater crocs were wandering<br/>
aimlessly around, not being attacked from 3 people at once as usual!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know where I can stop my second name from being repeated? Must<br/>
have signed up late one night, that&#39;s the best excuse I can think of<br/>
for why it&#39;s doubled :)<br/>
<br/>
Have fun all, give me a yell if you need a shadow knight in the group<br/>
to hunt Cazic, nearly 20th at long last (15 deaths last weekend didn&#39;t<br/>
help I guess)<br/>

&gt; &gt;One last thing - why do people in the Oasis insist<br/>
&gt; on training sand<br/>
&gt; &gt;giants into other people before they die? Can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; they have the good<br/>
&gt; &gt;grace to just die AWAY from the medditating mages?<br/>
&gt; Just something that<br/>
&gt; &gt;bugs me : )<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The worm turned on the past weekend.  Fed up of<br/>
&gt; cowering from the ever<br/>
&gt; swarming Sand Giants, most of Oasis (about 25ppl)<br/>
&gt; formed an agry mob by the<br/>
&gt; pier.  A quick bit of organisation saw casters and<br/>
&gt; healers grouped, and the<br/>
&gt; nearest Giant was swiftly pulled to his death.  Not<br/>
&gt; bad for a bunch of<br/>
&gt; lv15 - 20s, with a lv30 or so tank.  Made for some<br/>
&gt; truly excellent<br/>
&gt; screenshots, the poor thing didnt know who he was<br/>
&gt; meant to be hitting as he<br/>
&gt; swung from casters to healers to bashers and back.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The following day, they had their revenge though. <br/>
&gt; Some fool trained an SG<br/>
&gt; onto Pillar1.  Total carnage, i and many others died<br/>
&gt; staring at their spell<br/>
&gt; books.  I believe he then went on to whack a few of<br/>
&gt; the gawping crowd on the<br/>
&gt; beach too, which serves em right for staring at the<br/>
&gt; accident.  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When i got back, there were a LOT of naked people<br/>
&gt; running around.  :)<br/>
