    Well, you wont have Sdaan to kick around anymore!  hehe...But seriously folks.  My wife and I are starting the looooong process of moving to Hawaii, government style, so you wont be hearing from me for a while.  Hope you all have a great gaming experience, stay well, and kill all them damn gnolls for me, huh?  I&#39;ll be back on the list when we have perm. quarters, and an internet account once again.  So remember all the good topics so someone can fill me in later!  Till then, aloha, and farewell!<br/>
