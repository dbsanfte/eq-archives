<b>Subject:</b> weekly gathering... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907529367">i have been getting positive feedback about having a weekly gathering at the <br/>
swashbucklers cave in east commons(also entrance to it from north ro). the <br/>
one change is to have it on sundays instead. most of the feedback i have <br/>
been getting is saying that more people could make it on a sunday, instead <br/>
of a saturday. so unless there is another big event being planned on a <br/>
specific sunday(*see below for details), from now on i propose to have a <br/>
trade festival every sunday at 12 EST from now on.<br/>
<br/>
purpose of the trade festival:<br/>
<br/>
-MAIN PURPOSE-<br/>
1)to buy and sell our wares. looking for a smith making banded? selling your <br/>
handcrafted bows? trying to sell that polished tomahawk at top dollar? <br/>
rubicite leggings? LJ tunics? bone armor? bring your rare and handcrafted <br/>
items.<br/>
<br/>
-OTHER POSSIBILITIES-<br/>
2)for guilds to possibly talk about themselves and invite other playes to <br/>
become members.<br/>
<br/>
3)have language lessons.<br/>
<br/>
4)have rich players or guilds sponsor events with prizes.<br/>
<br/>
this will only take off if we let others know about it. so spread the word <br/>
to all your friends, and to others while on line. every sunday at the <br/>
swashbucklers cave at noon EST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*there is one big event that is happening on Bristlebane on sunday the 13th. <br/>
it is the Enlightenment Gathering. here are the details.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT: Enlightenment Gathering<br/>
WHEN: Sunday, June 13th 3:00 PM Pacific (5:00 PM Central)<br/>
WHERE: The Ever-Popular Tunnel to North Ro Desert in the East Commonlands<br/>
WHO: All races and classes are welcomed<br/>
SERVER: Bristlebane<br/>
EVENTS:<br/>
    Philosophy Discussion<br/>
    Trade Discussion<br/>
    Language Lessons<br/>
    Low Level Scavenger Hunt<br/>
    Open Market<br/>
<br/>
This is a ROLE-PLAYING EVENT.  On that note the only requirement is that <br/>
there<br/>
is to be no fighting or duels.  This is an event to expand the mind and not <br/>
to<br/>
lower the participants to the depths of violence and war.<br/>
<br/>
For those who wish to participate in the Philosophy Discussion please read <br/>
the<br/>
documents on the web page below, from the current response it will be a <br/>
large<br/>
topic of the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
We are in need of people to share the language of their race.  Anyone who <br/>
would<br/>
help share their language please contact us.  (The normal languages, like<br/>
Halfling, Ogre, Barbarian, and the like are what we are looking for.)<br/>
<br/>
We are also in need people who wish to speak about their trade.  Anyone who<br/>
would help share their knowledge of a trade please contact us.  (Anyone <br/>
hosting<br/>
a trade discussion will have the market on selling their trade items at the<br/>
gathering ;) )<br/>
<br/>
There will be a group lead from Qeynos to Freeport on Saturday.  We will<br/>
advertise in Qeynos at 10:00 AM Pacific (12:00 AM Central) and try to leave<br/>
about 11:00 AM Pacific (12:00 PM Central).  There may be another escort on<br/>
Sunday depending on demand.<br/>
