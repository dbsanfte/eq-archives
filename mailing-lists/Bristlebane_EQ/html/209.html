<b>Subject:</b> possible weekly trade festival... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519338629">i would like to suggest a weekly trade festival at the swanky swashbuckler&#39;s <br/>
cave. (it is located in east commons, with an entrance to it also from north <br/>
ro) i think that this would be a great place for players to bring thier rare <br/>
or hand made items and try and sell or trade them.  looking to sell that <br/>
rare polished tomahawk, or that hand made high quality bow? looking to find <br/>
a smith selling banded armor, or trying to find that peice of bronze plate <br/>
that you are missing? just found some rubicite armor and want to fetch a top <br/>
price for it? i think that this game is already awesome, but we can make it <br/>
better with weekly events like this, or other events. i suggest it be held <br/>
every saturday at 3PM EST. this should be a time when most players can get <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
other possibilities for this weelky trade festival can be a place for guilds <br/>
to try and recruit other players. players can get together and discuss <br/>
quests or what certain lore items are for (for example i have a pirates <br/>
earing, a lore item, and have no idea what is it for). maybe rich guilds <br/>
and/or rich players can even hold some contests with prizes.<br/>
<br/>
if this sounds like a good idea, please reply to the list with your comments <br/>
and/or let players know about it in the game. verant has given us a grand <br/>
start, but it is up to us to make it even better!!<br/>
