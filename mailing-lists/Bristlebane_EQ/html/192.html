<b>Subject:</b> Seeking Level 11-12 party for Befallen <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038685157">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Its your friendly neighborhood cleric, Vrachit again. I am looking for<br/>
a few adventuring souls of level 11-12 (13 is ok, but preferably not a<br/>
lot of folks cause I like equal ep distribution) distinction to hunt in<br/>
befallen level 2 with me. An additional cleric would be cool as 1 could<br/>
heal while 1 wards and certain need a tank or two. Mages and bards are<br/>
nice as well.<br/>
<br/>
Befallen doesn&#39;t have to be where we hunt but its a good dungeon and<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem too overcrowded even at peak times. If you have other<br/>
suggested places I&#39;m certainly open to them.<br/>
<br/>
You can either reply to the list or send me an email. I typically play<br/>
in the evenings betweek 8pm and 12am eastern time.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you wanna have some fun!<br/>
<br/>
Vrachit, virgo with venus rising &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
ps, is this the beginning of EQ personal ads? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
