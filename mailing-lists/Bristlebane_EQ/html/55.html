<div id="ygrps-yiv-717261052">Hey Madoc!  This is the Great and all powerful Zardoz!  Greetings.  I <br/>
just landed in Freeport last night, getting off the ship by the port <br/>
authority: I was so glad to get off that boat; do you have any idea what <br/>
seasick dwarves smell like? Ugh!  I&#39;m on a quest to see the world and <br/>
find Itan so I can insult him to his dim-witted, empty-headed face, <br/>
hehe.  Care to join me in my travels???  My plan was to restock <br/>
malachite in Freeport and set off for Rivervale.  I believe that retard, <br/>
Itan, is somewhere to the west, perhaps as far as the land of Erud: oh <br/>
brother, another boat crossing!<br/>
So, Madoc, if you are up for it, or for that fact any other adventurous <br/>
soul, except necros, in or about Freeport, let me know and we&#39;ll get <br/>
together and set out tonight.<br/>
Itan: prepare yourself for my august presence!  When we first meet I <br/>
realize my scintillating intellect will probably, since you are a lower <br/>
form of life, overwhelm you with awe! &lt;OOC: Itan, where you hiding out? <br/>
Since I&#39;m headed that way it would be nice to know where you are, hehe&gt;<br/>
&lt;ooc: personally, I think it would be really cool if we could get a band <br/>
of crazies together and roam all over Norrath; terrorizing necros and <br/>
helping folks out along the way.&gt;<br/>
