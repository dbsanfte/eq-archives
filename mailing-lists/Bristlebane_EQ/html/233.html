<div id="ygrps-yiv-723312229">Aye, it would be good to have the trade festival taking place in<br/>
Freeport, but the evil races (i.e. you and me!) couldn&#39;t attend it.<br/>
That is why the event is being based at the Shady Swashbuckler&#39;s cave,<br/>
so that anyone who want to attend, can attend. The Shady Swashbuckler<br/>
is indifferent to pretty much anyone, and will trade with anyone from a<br/>
high elf paladin to a dark elf shadow knight, he&#39;s not picky.<br/>
<br/>
If you get to around 20th any time soon, give me a yell, I&#39;ll hunt with<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing - why do people in the Oasis insist on training sand<br/>
giants into other people before they die? Can&#39;t they have the good<br/>
grace to just die AWAY from the medditating mages? Just something that<br/>
bugs me : )<br/>

&gt; possible weekly trade f estival...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;sure i have invisibility, but the prob is, when i<br/>
&gt; am invis.how can we start<br/>
&gt; &gt;a trade or something like that??not all char have<br/>
&gt; infravison and see<br/>
&gt; &gt;invisible or?thats the point i mean...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the tunnel from North Ro to East Commonlands,<br/>
&gt; there is no danger for a<br/>
&gt; necromancer by NPCs.  I am a Dark Elf Necromancer<br/>
&gt; and go at will between the<br/>
&gt; two zones via this tunnel.  I&#39;ve even traded with<br/>
&gt; the only NPC there and<br/>
&gt; have not been attacked.  A gnome such as yourself<br/>
&gt; should be more liked than<br/>
&gt; me, thus I don&#39;t think you should have any problem. <br/>
&gt; Thus your only concern<br/>
&gt; is getting through Freeport to the tunnel, which<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t very hard either.  If<br/>
&gt; you have Gather Shadows, then use it and you won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have to worry about<br/>
&gt; guards or any other Freeport citizen.  Head south<br/>
&gt; from the South gate of<br/>
&gt; Freeport (actually within East Freeport zone) and<br/>
&gt; enter North Ro, then<br/>
&gt; follow the right zone wall and you&#39;ll find the<br/>
&gt; tunnel easily.  Keep going<br/>
&gt; until you find an open area with the Swashbuckler<br/>
&gt; inside (and hopefully<br/>
&gt; everyone else that is there to trade).  The<br/>
&gt; alternate route is to stay<br/>
&gt; invisible and make your way from East Freeport to<br/>
&gt; West Freeport and then to<br/>
&gt; East Commonlands where you can follow the left zone<br/>
&gt; wall and you&#39;ll find the<br/>
&gt; tunnel inset in a hill.  Shouldn&#39;t be too hard.<br/>
