<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969724598"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The same goes for killing too many Pixies in Greater Faydark.  The<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whaaa? I don&#39;t think this is true. Maybe he means killing faeries... but<br/>
pixie tricksters need to be exterminated because they are setting fires to<br/>
the forest, and if they continue, our beloved Faydark will soon be gone (or<br/>
so my Ranger guildmaster told me). I can&#39;t believe the Rangers would have us<br/>
killing a &#39;nice&#39; creature.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I&#39;m willing to bet it is faeries... because one time my earth<br/>
elemental attacked a faerie (the faeries appear aggressive, even though they<br/>
don&#39;t attack me at my level, and the pet picks up on this aggressiveness)<br/>
and though I told him to back off, the faerie killed my pet and proceeded to<br/>
chase after me (I took off running when I saw my elemental was dying). I ran<br/>
to the guards, and they did nothing at all... and it wasn&#39;t one of those<br/>
&#39;the guard didn&#39;t see&#39; kind of things, because I had a very good start on<br/>
the faerie, and there were several minutes of me running back and forth in<br/>
front of the guards while they snickered at me and rolled their eyes!<br/>
<br/>
Now, one of the things I hope to never hear again is, &#39;Jobaner says, &#39;Time<br/>
to die a faerie guard.&#39;&#39;<br/>
