<div id="ygrps-yiv-795258640">Actually...  Sorry to nit-pick, but your skill cap IS, indeed, your level <br/>
times five plus five EXCEPT for two skills.  The two skills in question being <br/>
Offense and Defense.  These skills&#39; caps for your level is just five times <br/>
your level, not the additional plus five.  Just thought I&#39;d throw that <br/>
in...don&#39;t beat me.  :-)<br/>
