<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075289292">I am sorry, it appears that my last post asking questions about the skills<br/>
&quot;sneaking and hiding&quot; did not come over clearly to the mailing list.� I had<br/>
put the skill names &quot;sneaking and hiding&quot; in the subject, then proceeded to<br/>
ask questions about them in the body of the email.� It turns out, no one saw<br/>
the subject and my message looked rather silly.� Please forgive my waste of<br/>
everyone&#39;s time.<br/>
�<br/>
Now, to the questions!<br/>
�<br/>
I have built a Halfling Druid, and have the abilities of &quot;Sneak&quot; and &quot;Hide.&quot;<br/>
�<br/>
These are not listed as &quot;trainable&quot; at any level, yet I can use them as an<br/>
&quot;ability&quot; it seems.� Sort of like &quot;Bash&quot; for a Barbarian (or &#39;slam&#39;).<br/>
�<br/>
I am very curious about these abilities.� If anyone knows, please tell me<br/>
your experience with them.� In particular, I&#39;m interested to know:<br/>
�<br/>
1) Do these skills ever go &quot;up&quot; in effectiveness?<br/>
�<br/>
2) How do I know if I was successful in using the skill?� Hiding, for<br/>
example &quot;always&quot; seems to work, yet still I get whacked!<br/>
�<br/>
3) Where would I go to &quot;train&quot; in them if this is possible?<br/>
