<b>Subject:</b> Need a bind in Freeport <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-63213582">Hello again all. I&#39;ve recently arrived in Freeport and intend on staying <br/>
there for a while. However, my level 4 cleric can&#39;t yet use the spell Bind <br/>
Affinity, and I&#39;m having trouble finding someone who can (or will) bind me to <br/>
the town. If anyone is located around there and has the spell, or knows <br/>
someone who does, please drop me a line, (I&#39;m Fenwen in game). <br/>
<br/>
And for those of you who like hellish stories, here&#39;s one for you;<br/>
<br/>
I make the journey from Felwithe all the way to Freeport without much <br/>
trouble. I&#39;m wandering around the outsides of Freeport, and I see an asp. I <br/>
say, there&#39;s low-level stuff around here, it can&#39;t be that hard. Well, killed <br/>
me in three hits, needless to say. So, I get sent back to Felwithe. I make it <br/>
all the way to the docks at Kaladim, catch the boat, and I&#39;m on my way again. <br/>
This isn&#39;t so bad, I tell myself. Wrong again. I accidentally hit the windows <br/>
key and get thrown out of EQ. I log back on, only to find myself wading in <br/>
the Ocean of Tears, miles away from my destination, with my corpse slowing <br/>
decaying. So, I says to myself, what now? Well, I decided to swim for it. I <br/>
make it from 210, 300 to about 210, -8000 (An hour swim, adding in the fact I <br/>
swam in circles for a good half hour) and I see a boat heading for me <br/>
straight on. I get a crafty idea and swim right into it - and right into the <br/>
hold! But, it&#39;s going the wrong way.. it takes me back to Kaladim! So I wait <br/>
the trip out and finally arrive in Freeport. I run all the way to where I <br/>
died, and my corpse is, amazingly, still there. I&#39;ve never been so frustrated <br/>
in my life.</div>
