<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411185877">Hehe, its an enchanter thing mainly because a spell we need (our<br/>
animation spell) is available ONLY in Highpass hold... starting at level<br/>
8.  Its similar to the reason all enchanters goto Neriak around level<br/>
8-12... the only place we can get the enchant silver / electrum / gold /<br/>
platinum spells is in neriak and we gotta go get it.<br/>

&gt; Please tell... What do you mean by this?  It seems you are saying that<br/>
&gt; Enchanters frequent HighPass?  Beginning at level 8?  Why in the world would<br/>
&gt; a level 8 character of ANY type want to frequent HighPass?  Is this &quot;an<br/>
&gt; enchanter thing?&quot; </span></blockquote></div>
