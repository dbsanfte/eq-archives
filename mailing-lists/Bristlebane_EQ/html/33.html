<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006055989">Greetings to all.  I thought that I should take a moment to introduce <br/>
myself to ye all.  I am Lexcanium, a Human Paladin who has currently attained <br/>
the tenth numerical rank within his training.  I can be found, generally, all <br/>
throughout Norrath, as I wander the land often, making my way from one place <br/>
to the next.  Most often, as of late, I can be found on the beautiful <br/>
continent of Faydwer slaying the evil Orcs of the Clan Crushbone, which, by <br/>
the way, seem to hold a vendetta against me...  At least that is the <br/>
impression I infer when they scream things such as, &quot;Your actions and history <br/>
are a personal affront to all I stand for!&quot; when trying in vain to beat me to <br/>
a bloody pulp.<br/>
	If our paths shall ever cross, feel free to stop and talk for a <br/>
while, I am usually always free for some friendly chatter.  Fare thee well, <br/>
and may we purge the wonderful lands of Norrath from all evil in given time!<br/>
<br/>
Safe travels,<br/>
	Lexcanium MacCrege<br/>
	Holy Knight of Erollisi Marr</div>
