&gt; Just wondering what you meant by &quot;Almost Last-Named&quot;. <br/>
&gt; When do you reach a point where you earn such a thing?<br/>

&gt; P.S. -&gt; If anyone has any spare putrid rib bones, it<br/>
&gt; would be greatly appreciated as I&#39;m dying to get my<br/>
&gt; next quest completed ;).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t help but feel greatly aggravated at the number of people who sit<br/>
there and camp at the ruins in the hopes of taking advantage of monks who<br/>
desperately need putrid rib bones. I find this amazingly lame. It ranks up<br/>
there with clerics charging for heals and other such things.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like a tank charging to party with you or some other such nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
Those clerics who do keep it free have my undying loyalty.<br/>
