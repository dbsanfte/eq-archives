&gt; Hi everyone, I&#92;&#39;m new to the list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was wondering what areas and monsters you are finding have the best exp<br/>
&gt; potential?  I am a Ranger in Qeynos and basically have found that Black<br/>
&gt; Burrow or the Karana plains are about it for levels 6-9 that I can find.<br/>
&gt; Where else in the Qeynos area (or other areas) have great exp potential?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are there other &#92;&quot;dungeons&#92;&quot; in the areas (I know of the aquaducks, but they<br/>
&gt; are a bit slow)? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Karim / Alladine<br/>

zone than anyplace around Qeynos.  Also it is mostly spell casters so your <br/>
fighting skills are needed.  Another good point is the fact that you can track, <br/>
and the Toxullia forest is a dark foggy place that is hard to see in.  There are<br/>
<br/>
pleanty of poachers and undead to slay can gain from (xp for lv 6-8).  Not to <br/>
sure of above that in the Tox, but you can go to Kerra Isle with a good group <br/>
and survive if you make sure to con everything first.  These are good places for<br/>
<br/>
Rangers, I have partied with a few in Qeynos and crossed the boat to Erudin and <br/>
had a non-stop hunting spree (except for my resting to get mana that is) for <br/>
some great gains in my powers.  So it is one option that you can consider my <br/>
fine Ranger.<br/>
