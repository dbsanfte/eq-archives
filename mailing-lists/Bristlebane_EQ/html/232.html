<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;sure i have invisibility, but the prob is, when i am invis.how can we start<br/>
&gt;a trade or something like that??not all char have infravison and see<br/>
&gt;invisible or?thats the point i mean...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In the tunnel from North Ro to East Commonlands, there is no danger for a<br/>
necromancer by NPCs.  I am a Dark Elf Necromancer and go at will between the<br/>
two zones via this tunnel.  I&#39;ve even traded with the only NPC there and<br/>
have not been attacked.  A gnome such as yourself should be more liked than<br/>
me, thus I don&#39;t think you should have any problem.  Thus your only concern<br/>
is getting through Freeport to the tunnel, which isn&#39;t very hard either.  If<br/>
you have Gather Shadows, then use it and you won&#39;t have to worry about<br/>
guards or any other Freeport citizen.  Head south from the South gate of<br/>
Freeport (actually within East Freeport zone) and enter North Ro, then<br/>
follow the right zone wall and you&#39;ll find the tunnel easily.  Keep going<br/>
until you find an open area with the Swashbuckler inside (and hopefully<br/>
everyone else that is there to trade).  The alternate route is to stay<br/>
invisible and make your way from East Freeport to West Freeport and then to<br/>
East Commonlands where you can follow the left zone wall and you&#39;ll find the<br/>
tunnel inset in a hill.  Shouldn&#39;t be too hard.<br/>
