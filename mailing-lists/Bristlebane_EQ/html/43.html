<div id="ygrps-yiv-27782086">For those of you not learned in the speech of my peoples, that is<br/>
roughly translated into Commonspeak as &quot;Greetings&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As it appears that these communications run rampant with the confused<br/>
and mislead, I wish to inform you that the Father&#39;s will shall not be<br/>
swayed.  You shall be wrapped with the blanket of hate, or be smothered<br/>
by it.<br/>
<br/>
I shall continue watching you... as do my brethren.  Count your useless<br/>
blessings that we are only watching, for when we strike it will be with<br/>
no mercy.<br/>

(/ooc I&#39;m one of those freaks that is not content with one character. <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s my multiple personalities or maybe I was dropped one to many<br/>
times on my head *grin*.  Anyway, my two primary characters are the<br/>
dark elf warrior Negfleisch and the half elf bard Jantis Eorl.  Good to<br/>
[sort of] meet you all.   -Drew Dunlap)<br/>
