<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439022208"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Ah, my dear barbarian woman.  By &quot;Tree-hugger&quot;, I assume you mean a Druid, as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that is what we have commonly been called.  However, I must point out that no<br/>
Druid in the history of Norrath, as far as I have seen, follows the path of<br/>
Quellious The Tranquil....Annotated<br/>
<br/>
Yes this is true but a Druid may follow the teaching of Quellious while still<br/>
staying in the order of their God.  As long as their god does not require hate<br/>
or war.<br/>
<br/>
From the current response I think that there is going to be a very heated debate.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to keep a debate running smoothly? <br/>
Maybe call on people to talk.  I don&#39;t want it to be so crazy that noone hears<br/>
what anyone says.</div>
