&gt; Other than seeing those occasional &quot;your faction has increased with So-and-so&quot;<br/>
&gt; messages, does anyone else find it scary that you have NO idea what any<br/>
&gt; particular group might think of you and what that means for your general<br/>
&gt; safety?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Members of the crew I regularly adventure with made a few enemies among the<br/>
&gt; Freeport militia.  Now many of the Freeport guards will attack them.  Ok, that<br/>
&gt; one was fairly predictable.  However, when we adventured to Kaladim, one of<br/>
&gt; these people was killed by a dwarven guard (StormGuard).  I&#39;m not sure that we<br/>
&gt; figured out exactly why.  The guard shouted something about his god, but he<br/>
&gt; shares a god with others in our group.  Was it related to the Freeport thing?<br/>
&gt; We may never know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wish they would tell you when you select your god what the repercussions<br/>
&gt; might be.  Picking one of the ultra-evil ones has obvious drawbacks, but we<br/>
&gt; have no way of knowing what selecting any of the others will do to you.  And<br/>
&gt; once in the game what are you supposed to do?  Two PCs conning an NPC often<br/>
&gt; results in similar messages (&quot;regards you dubiously&quot; or something like that)<br/>
&gt; yet only one PC will be attacked.  Kind of an expensive guessing game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just my ponder for the day.  Talk amongst yourselves.<br/>
