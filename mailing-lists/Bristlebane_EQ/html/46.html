<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715411438">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
My name is &quot;Hewhois&quot; and I am a 5th level Monk and follower of Quellious the<br/>
Tranquil.  Hometown is Freeport.  I spend most of my time in the Eastern<br/>
Commonlands (Watchout for that wall piercing Griffin!!!) or the Northern<br/>
Desert of Ro.  I too, love to destroy skeletons.  One good round kick and<br/>
they fall apart, LOVE that sound.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a rough draft of a character Bio I am working on.  Please let me<br/>
know what you think.  BTW, the character originally started out female, but<br/>
the story seemed to work better with a male character.  So, may be a few<br/>
she/hers that should be he/hims :)<br/>
<br/>
Hewhois (Monk Character):<br/>
<br/>
Quick Look:<br/>
*Mistrusts all metal and metallic objects and stays away from them as much<br/>
as is practical<br/>
**Will loot metal items to sell, but will get rid of it as soon as possible.<br/>
***Money is money afterall ;)<br/>
*Follows the path of Quellious<br/>
*ALL NPC dark elves are attacked on sight due to characters personal<br/>
history(have yet to meet any NPC Drows though)<br/>
*Does his best to not judge others based on his own beliefs<br/>
**However, he is only human, and can&#39;t help but feel a little superior to<br/>
metal wielding warriors<br/>
*On a continuous quest to find his father&#39;s murderer (believed to be a Dark<br/>
Elf) and foil whatever plot the murderer is involved in.<br/>
<br/>
Character Bio:<br/>
Hewhois was born to Hew and his wife Hois, she died while giving birth to<br/>
him.  Hew was a Grand Master Blacksmith and started training Hewhois for the<br/>
trade as soon as he could hold a little hammer.  he was taught to love and<br/>
revere metal in all of it&#39;s forms.  For the first sixteen years of his life,<br/>
all was well.  Although he was not a naturally talented smith, his father<br/>
was a very good teacher and he could look forward to eventually being at<br/>
least a Master Blacksmith.<br/>
<br/>
One day, a mysterious cloaked and hooded stranger came to his father&#39;s<br/>
forge.  He had with him a bar of metal that he wished Hew to forge into a<br/>
sword.  The stranger made Hew swear that he would be the only one who<br/>
touched the metal.  Hewhois&#39; father agreed, customer is always right was his<br/>
motto, and reached out to receive the metal bar from the stranger.  As the<br/>
exchange was made, Hewhois noticed a strange blue tinge to the skin of the<br/>
stranger&#39;s hand and a strange looking ring on the pinky finger.  The ring<br/>
had a stone with a design engraved into it that looked like many ovals of<br/>
the same shape, but different orientations, around four small spheres<br/>
clustered in the middle.  Now, normally he would not be able to make out<br/>
such fine detail at that distance, but the ring caught his gaze and seemed<br/>
to draw him in, as if some outside force wished him to see it.  The stranger<br/>
said it must be ready by the fifth day, for he must return home soon.  With<br/>
that announcement, he quickly departed.<br/>
<br/>
For the next five days, Hewhois watched his father from afar as he bent to<br/>
the task at hand.  Knowing Hewhois&#39; inquisitive nature, his father had<br/>
forbidden him to even go near the metal.  For Hew knew that his son would<br/>
not be able to resist touching the strange metal bar that almost seemed to<br/>
glow on the edge of Human vision with a light all it&#39;s own.  Hew worked on<br/>
it day and night, despite a slowly growing feeling of illness.  He<br/>
attributed it to nothing more than the long hours of smithing without a<br/>
break.  At long last, with Hew barely able to even lift a hammer, it was<br/>
finished just before dawn on the fifth day.<br/>
<br/>
As if waiting nearby for some secret signal, the stranger appeared shortly<br/>
afterward for his sword.  The stranger was very impressed with Hew&#39;s<br/>
workmanship, so much so that he told Hew to name his price, and it would be<br/>
his.  By this time, Hewhois&#39; father was beginning to suspect that not all<br/>
was as it appeared, and he feared for their lives.  His fatigue was only<br/>
getting worse, and he noticed that his arms and hands were starting to<br/>
blister.  Knowing he was already a dead man, he asked the stranger to spare<br/>
his son&#39;s life as payment.  The stranger was not pleased, but he had already<br/>
given his promise and for some reason felt bound by it, at least for now.<br/>
So he agreed to the price, then immediately killed the Father by<br/>
accelerating what was already happening to him, and lulled Hewhois to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
On the sixth day following the strangers first appearance at the forge,<br/>
Hewhois woke up with a start with no memory of what had happened the<br/>
previous day.  She found his father dead, on the floor near where he had<br/>
been standing.  His skin was red, with blisters all over.  Hewhois also<br/>
noticed an itching sensation that grew as he approached his dear father&#39;s<br/>
body.  Fearing that it may be contagious, he rushed off to get the village<br/>
healer.  The healer was not very helpful, for he had never seen such<br/>
symptoms before.  He also feared getting to close to the body, wisely<br/>
thinking that the growing itching sensation was a warning to stay away.  He<br/>
recommended to the town Elders that the forge be burned to the ground and a<br/>
high wall erected around the property to keep out the curious.  Despite<br/>
Hewhois&#39; anguished pleas, it was agreed to follow the healers advice.<br/>
<br/>
Mystified, confused, grieving and orphaned, he ran out of the meeting hall<br/>
and nearly knocked over an elderly, kind looking stranger, whose graceful<br/>
recovery belied his great age.  When the old man heard his tale of woe, he<br/>
was greatly disturbed.  He asked him if she had a place to live, and offered<br/>
to be his guardian till he became an adult in a couple of years.  Not<br/>
wanting to stay in the village where his father died, and having no other<br/>
alternatives, he agreed.<br/>
<br/>
The elderly gentleman turned out to be a monk and a follower of Quellious.<br/>
He was also very wise and knowledgeable. He had read of similar cases and<br/>
related them to Hewhois.  All had been blacksmiths, all had recently taken<br/>
on a new commission from a stranger, and all had died the same way.  In some<br/>
accounts, a dark Elf had been mentioned and he asked Hewhois if he new the<br/>
race of the stranger.  All he could tell him was that the skin had appeared<br/>
to have a bluish tint to it.  The old monk thought it likely that the<br/>
stranger had been a dark Elf, and that the items he was commissioning were<br/>
being made out of metal with some strange power emanating from it.  He<br/>
further speculated that it was this strange power that killed the<br/>
blacksmiths.  After praying for Divine help, the old monk placed Hewhois in<br/>
a deep trance, in hope of recovering his memory of that fateful fifth day.<br/>
<br/>
Hewhois nearly went mad when he heard that metal and stranger was<br/>
responsible for his father&#39;s death.  The very substance that his father had<br/>
taught Hewhois to revere and love had killed him.  From that day on, he had<br/>
an aversion to anything with metal.  Obviously, smiths had to use metal, so<br/>
she needed a new trade.<br/>
<br/>
The monk agreed to train him in the basics of monkhood, but he said that to<br/>
go beyond the first level, one had to go out into the world and earn it.<br/>
<br/>
So, now Hewhois wanders the land, learning his craft, seeking inner peace,<br/>
and above all, seeking answers to how his father died and why.  He believes<br/>
the Dark Elves are responsible and that some nefarious plot is being<br/>
executed involving this strange metal.  He vowed to one day uncover that<br/>
plot and foil their plans.  Needless to say, he has a special dislike of<br/>
Dark Elves.<br/>
