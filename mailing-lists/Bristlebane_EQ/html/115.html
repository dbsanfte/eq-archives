<div id="ygrps-yiv-911080076">I&#39;ve not been able to get online for a week or so (except email), due to<br/>
moving house, and I feel a bit out of touch.<br/>
<br/>
My character is still a lowly 3rd level Erudite Wizard, due to limited<br/>
playing time, but it has taken a lot more work than my beta character did<br/>
(Barby Shamen).<br/>
<br/>
How are you all finding progression?  I&#39;m in no great hurry, and I&#39;m<br/>
certainly not a power player, but I get the feeling that some class/race<br/>
combos have a much easier time of it than others, perhaps too much for<br/>
balance.<br/>
<br/>
I know the hybrid classes have to earn more experience, but does anyone know<br/>
any details?<br/>
<br/>
