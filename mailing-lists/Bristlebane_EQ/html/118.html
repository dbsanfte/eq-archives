<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673948022">I&#39;m not sure who told you that, but here is my experience...<br/>
<br/>
Dark Elves also have the racial ability to hide.  When I first created<br/>
him his ability was a couple of name levels above &quot;feeble&quot;... something<br/>
like &quot;fairly bad&quot;.  I have since been able to increase my skill once<br/>
numeric level, although I do not hide very often.  Also, my character<br/>
is a warrior.<br/>
<br/>
I did not start out maxxed in my Hide skill, and I would assume that<br/>
other races are the same.  Perhaps there is a separate racial limit<br/>
that is separate from the class limit.  Maybe this is Dark Elf only...<br/>
I don&#39;t know<br/>
<br/>
All I am sure of is that I did not start out with my maximum skill in<br/>
Hiding and it certainly is separate from my class (as it is not a class<br/>
skill and I am only 5th level).  Perhaps the max for the race is 75 but<br/>
you actually start out with 25 or 30.<br/>

By the way... thank you all for your quick replies to my previous<br/>
questions.  I will try again with the alcohol... perhaps brandy this<br/>
time.  If you see me around, remind me that I owe you a drink.  <br/>
<br/>
I knew my dark elf would have some troubles with KoS, but there may at<br/>
least be a chance I could train somewhere.  Perhaps I will try to get<br/>
bound to the area BEFORE I inquire.... *grin*<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; OK, here is the FULL scoop on this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Halflings have the *racial ability* to sneak and<br/>
&gt; hide.  I don&#39;t know what<br/>
&gt; &quot;skill level&quot; this translates to, but for<br/>
&gt; illustration lets say it is 75.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Depending on your class, you may or may not get the<br/>
&gt; *class ability* to sneak<br/>
&gt; and hide.  If your class does get it, it will be at<br/>
&gt; a certain level (your<br/>
&gt; guild trainers will show you what level) and you<br/>
&gt; cannot put more practices<br/>
&gt; into it until that level.  Furthermore, using the<br/>
&gt; skill will not increase the<br/>
&gt; skill until such a time as your class gets the<br/>
&gt; skill.  Argh, hope I&#39;m being<br/>
&gt; clear.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; More on this... lets say you have the racial skill<br/>
&gt; at 75, and your class gets<br/>
&gt; the ability to learn the skill at level 10.  At<br/>
&gt; level 10 the skill would be<br/>
&gt; capped at (level*5)+5 or 55.  So even though at 10th<br/>
&gt; level your guild will now<br/>
&gt; train you in it, they wont because you are already<br/>
&gt; maxed out in it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know any of the specific numbers, nor how<br/>
&gt; often this wierd stuff<br/>
&gt; happens (although there are a number of races that<br/>
&gt; get sneak or hide), but<br/>
&gt; this is how it has been explained to me.  Use the<br/>
&gt; skill if it helps you, but<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t expect it to improve at all until such a time<br/>
&gt; as your guild would train<br/>
&gt; you in it.<br/>
