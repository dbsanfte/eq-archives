I took my own advice and I created a new mailing list for Bristlebane. It&#39;s purely an OOC list. The URL is:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Bristlebane_EQ_OOC">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Bristlebane_EQ_OOC</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s for the exchange of ideas, information, resources, tips, hints, player help, etc. Roleplaying is discouraged. (Hence the OOC title... &lt;grin&gt;) The new list is not meant as an offense, merely as a solution to what is obviously becoming a problem on this list. I&#39;ve seen a new list on the EQVault page dedicated to roleplaying on another server, so I suppose that there is a demand for RP in mailing lists. But since some of us want purely OOC discussion, I thought the obvious solution would be to create a second list.<br/>
