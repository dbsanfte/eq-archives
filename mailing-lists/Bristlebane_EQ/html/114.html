<b>Subject:</b> Disturbed Guards on the Wall look on as... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895362910">... <br/>
<br/>
Two guards lean over the battlement to wittness a scuffling figure in the <br/>
dust and dirt near the fortress walls of Freeport.  They must listen closely <br/>
to hear his dizzy mutterings...&quot;... ratty ratty... h-h-h .. r-ratt rat rat.  <br/>
h-h-h..  shhhhh... must... shhhhh.. still... still... ratty... h-h-h...&quot;Lying <br/>
weak, disfigured and still in the desert dust the sickly figure feigns-death <br/>
in a desperate attempt to lure a possible meal.  Too weak to move, too weak <br/>
to beg, the hint of survival instinct is the only clue that intelligence once <br/>
resided in the wretched, blood and dust heap of a man.&quot;shhhhh... shhhhh...,&quot; <br/>
the sound is like a swamp outgassing, until... &quot;Arr-ha!&quot; Sudden and quick the <br/>
form closes on it&#39;s prey like a predatory plant... weak arms and legs curl to <br/>
the chest to encircle the curious visitor.  And then, too weak of fist or leg <br/>
to seriously injure his prey, and lacking the needed teeth to be menacing, <br/>
the reeking pile of human waste wrestles furiously with the mottled <br/>
beast!&quot;Grrrr.. Grrrrgrrrrrr.... h-h-h-h.. grrrr grrrr.  RAA... grrrr.. <br/>
ahhhhaaaa!  grrrrr...,&quot;  the wrestling match goes on! And then, seizing his <br/>
rat-assailant firmly between his two boney hands, and with a ferocity never <br/>
seen by innocent eyes, the broken man begins beating his captive over and <br/>
over and over again against his own head!  ...beating the biting and clawing <br/>
beast until his own forehead and face is covered in blood, who knows whose... <br/>
and the match goes on. &quot;Arrrr... grrr....&quot;  ::squeek:: ::squeek::  ::squeek:: <br/>
 :squeeeek::Dear God, the guards each think quietly in turn.  They&#39;ve seen <br/>
examples of the effect of poverty upon mankind, but this is insane! And then, <br/>
in a gesture of supreme jest, one guard reaches over and does the quick <br/>
&quot;push/pull&quot; gag on his friend.  <br/>
<br/>
Good Fortune,<br/>
