<div id="ygrps-yiv-176661993">Well, almost right, but not quite... Everyone has two<br/>
combat skills in addition to their chosen weapon<br/>
skills known as offense and defense... offense, as it<br/>
rises, allows you to get the most out of your weapon,<br/>
increasing both damage potential and likelihood of an<br/>
attack succeeding. Defense, on the other hand, allows<br/>
you to get the most out of your armor, and as it<br/>
increases, so does the effectiveness of your chosen<br/>
armor. <br/>
<br/>
Therefore, a level one character could, indeed, put on<br/>
a full set of plate mail, but it would have nowhere<br/>
near the same effectivenes as the exact same suit on a<br/>
20 level character, but would still be a darn sight<br/>
better than any other level one&#39;s armor class running<br/>
around without plate mail... so good armor is<br/>
definately of use to lower level characters, just not<br/>
nearly as effective as it will become as the charatcer<br/>
develops.<br/>

&gt; I may be wrong here, but I believe that higher order<br/>
&gt; armour is of little<br/>
&gt; use to a lower level character.  You will not gain<br/>
&gt; the extra AC<br/>
&gt; benefit at lower levels as your character is deemed<br/>
&gt; to not be<br/>
&gt; experienced enough to make the best use of it.<br/>
&gt; Go for the spells.  They are what make you a cleric<br/>
