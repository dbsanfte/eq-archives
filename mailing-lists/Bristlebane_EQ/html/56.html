<b>Subject:</b> Zakrul the Travler has arrived <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-510300288">Allow me to introduce myself, I am Zakrul the Travler, Wizard of some talent.  I<br/>
<br/>
must say you all sure do go about how great you are but I have never heard of <br/>
you through any bard songs or even rumor.  Well I know that talkers are just <br/>
that.  So as I travel around Norrath I will stop by to say hello Zardoz in his <br/>
elven city.  Itan I have yet to see you in my travels and I live in Erudin.  <br/>
Well I think that is because I am out proving myself adventuring with all sorts <br/>
while you two write each other thinly vieled love letters.  Well I let my <br/>
actions speak for me.  If we meet in the future you can be sure to team with me.<br/>
 <br/>
We shall then find who is the mightiest.  For I work as a team which always nets<br/>
<br/>
the best results.  <br/>
<br/>
I the great Zakrul have also decided to extend and invitation to anybody <br/>
interested in becoming an officer in The Companions.  We are an adventure guild <br/>
that is neutral and ultimate goal it to travel the land of Norrath to meet our <br/>
fate.  If you are interested there are two officer slots open.  First come first<br/>
<br/>
serve. We currently have chapters started in Freeport, Qeynos and Erudin and <br/>
welcome the chance to start in other cities.  Drow, Trolls and Ogres need not <br/>
apply.<br/>
                                                   Farewell,<br/>
                                                          Zakrul The Travler<br/>
                                                          <br/>
OOC: Please email <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:zdogg@...">zdogg@...</a> with any interest.  I only need 2 more to make <br/>
the guild official.  If you wish to know more it is posted on EQVault.  Hope to <br/>
see all of you in Norrath.  This newsletter keeps me through work with out going<br/>
<br/>
crazy from EQ withdrawl.  Itan and Zardoz you two keep it up tis funny, funny <br/>
stuff.<br/>
