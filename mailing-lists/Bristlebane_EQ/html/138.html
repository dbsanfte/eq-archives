<div id="ygrps-yiv-7580080">If the guards in Kaladim attacked your group or what not, I can only <br/>
conclude it is because one of you killed too many Krags and Krag Chicks found <br/>
in the Butcherblocks.  The guards seem to adore those nasty little critters.<br/>
<br/>
	The same goes for killing too many Pixies in Greater Faydark.  The <br/>
Kelethin Guards, (as idiotic as they are), will attack you on sight if you <br/>
kill too many.<br/>
<br/>
	Well, this is what I have been told anywho.  :-)<br/>
