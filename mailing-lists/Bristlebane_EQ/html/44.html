<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-68799198">Hail fellow adventurers, may the Light of the Truthbringer shine upon you.  My name is Ardalen, an acolyte of Mithaniel Marr.  Currently, I reside in the once fair city of Freeport, now little more than a ruinous slum thanks to Lucan D&#39;lere and his orc loving Freeport Militia.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who seek enlightenment through Valor, my hammer and my spells are at your disposal.   For the cowardly remainder, I&#39;m afraid all I may offer you is a broken skull.<br/>
<br/>
Ardalen</div>
