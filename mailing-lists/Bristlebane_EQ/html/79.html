<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311475739">Greetings everyone,<br/>
<br/>
This is your friendly neighborhood Dwarfen Cleric, Vrachit. Just wanted<br/>
to say hello and also ask if others are finding it as hard as I am from<br/>
level 6 and up. I am 6 now and having hard time finding good things to<br/>
kill or parties to kill them will. I am often found in freeport but<br/>
spend most of my time in Butcherblock, as it is easier to fetch my<br/>
corpse (which I seem to be doing a lot of lately).<br/>
<br/>
Any advice you have for this struggling healer would be most<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
