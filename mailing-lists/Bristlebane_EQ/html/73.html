Not sure how many of you know this, but many areas were tweaked around the<br/>
time of final release to increase difficulty.  Places like Befallen used to be<br/>
happy hunting grounds where you could easily identify what portion was safe<br/>
for you and stick to that.  To discourage &quot;campers&quot; and other such things, EQ<br/>
added anti-camping spawns and other such things.  Now, you can be a low-level<br/>
player happily slaying even /cons when some red, hit-only-by-magic creature<br/>
spawns in your lap.<br/>
<br/>
I freely admit I died in Befallen last night.  We were in an area that our<br/>
group could reasonably handle, we goofed a bit, and one unlucky anti-camping<br/>
spawn finished me off.  I&#39;m fine with that as it was really our mistakes that<br/>
killed me.  However, as I&#39;m running back to Befallen I get to listen as the<br/>
remainder of my party runs into something *worse* (dark elf dragoon) and madly<br/>
flees Befallen.  After retrieving my corpse we prepare to leave and a ghoul<br/>
spawns on us.  DOH!<br/>
<br/>
OK, so if increased difficulty was EQ&#39;s goal... what is the point?  If we went<br/>
back in there 5 levels from now we would survive the &quot;hot&quot; spawns better, but<br/>
nothing would give us XP anymore.  If the goal was anti-camping then they<br/>
should lower the spawn rate a bit, as there is no way we could hack our way in<br/>
to our intended target, then hack our way back out through the near-immediate<br/>
respawns.  If we were high enough level to do so, again we&#39;d hardly get XP for<br/>
the accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
From a player point of view, the only solution to this situation is to wait<br/>
until there are enough PCs in a zone to make it safe to inhabit.  But then you<br/>
lose out on all the fun of being the few brave souls alone in a zone.  And you<br/>
also end up with previously deadly zones like Blackburrow reduced to a gaggle<br/>
of players standing around *WAITING* for something to spawn because they&#39;ve<br/>
all killed everything.  I&#39;ve seen more suspense and danger at Wal-Mart.<br/>
