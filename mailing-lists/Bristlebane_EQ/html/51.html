Truly, I think this is the first time I&#39;ve ever seen or heard of a power<br/>
gamer putting down players for Role Playing. Both High Elves and Erudites<br/>
tend to be a bit stuck up, and when players of those races decide to add<br/>
some spice to their messages with RP then they have a perfect right to. I<br/>
hate to get UO involved in an EQ discussion list, but I feel one of the<br/>
major downfalls of that game was the fact that there were so few RPers. WQ<br/>
has been vastly diffrent in that respect, and I&#39;d be thankful if you stopped<br/>
trying to scare them off! Quite frankly, I found those messages to be<br/>
entertaining as well as to possess pertinant info. I agree that the many<br/>
messages  that are recieved via this mailing list can get a bit spammy.. but<br/>
if you don&#39;t like them simply unsubscribe. Okay, now I&#39;m done with the rant<br/>
and can go on to more cheerful subjects...<br/>

    Since introductions seem to be the order of the day (except of course<br/>
for our dear magic users who seem to be more intrested in flinging mud and<br/>
racial prejudices than spells as is normal) I&#39;d like to introduce myself. I<br/>
am Madoc, and I am in the sixth level of service to Quellious the Tranquil.<br/>
(OOC&gt; 6th level Monk) Unlike so many others, I judge no man or beast before<br/>
contact. I will fight only those who spend their lives seeking to destroy<br/>
others. Currently I stay close to my home town, Freeport. I can usually be<br/>
found in the dessert men have labeled Ro, but I have decided that this is<br/>
not the place that I  might find my Center, so one day I plan to travel the<br/>
world. Should we one day meet in our travels and I not recognize you, feel<br/>
free to stop me and start up a bit of conversation, as additional wisdom can<br/>
always be gained from the meeting of two travellers.<br/>
