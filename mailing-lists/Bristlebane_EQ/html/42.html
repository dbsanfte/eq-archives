You state the by definition of course, I am &quot;Barbaric.&quot;  However you fail to<br/>
take one thing into account.....<br/>
<br/>
In the mystical land of Norrath, all races are mystically controlled by the<br/>
all-powerful Earthlings......  So then, all of the negative aspects of my<br/>
&quot;Barbaric&quot; heritage are overcome by my mighty Earthling controller, me.<br/>
<br/>
That leaves me with the superior physical conditioning of my race, the hardy<br/>
Barbarians.  Also, with the power of the Shaman, a lost art that you newer<br/>
races may not even learn.  Long ago, we determined to hide these secrets<br/>
from the younger races.<br/>
<br/>
I pity you, with your frail body.  You spend all your energies on matters of<br/>
the mind, yet never fully coming to know the powers of nature around you.<br/>
You may blast an opponent with mighty force, but what are you to do once<br/>
your manna is spent?  Will you die, or run?  And if you run, will you have<br/>
the Spirit of the Wolf to speed you?  No, you won&#39;t.  I dare say that no<br/>
creature on all of Norrath can keep up with me.  I can both grind an enemy<br/>
to a halt, and run at speeds the fastest leopard envies.  If I run at all,<br/>
for my mighty staff can damage an opponent nearly as well as my magics can.<br/>
