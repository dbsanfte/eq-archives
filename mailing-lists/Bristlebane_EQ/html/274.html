<div id="ygrps-yiv-636939032">Hey everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Just want to introduce myself.  My character is Nance Deventurous <br/>
and im a 54 Human cleric.  I joined the group so I can gain <br/>
knowledge of the game and also get some insights on some zones.  A <br/>
certain zone I want to know more about is Chardok.  I am working on <br/>
my epic and wanted to get some information so I can kick overking <br/>
bathezed ass.   My guild is Method and it rulez!  If anyone has any <br/>
information on Chardok or would like to group with me sometime and <br/>
join my overking raid, please send me a reply.  Would love to hear <br/>
from you all soon. Later!<br/>
<br/>
