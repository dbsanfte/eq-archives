<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274268673"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Everquest is at it&#39;s roots, an lpc mud.<br/>
&gt; lpc muds are about hack and slash.<br/>
&gt; Everquest is very nicely graphical, but I&#39;d hardly say that it demands, or<br/>
&gt; even encourages Roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, maybe I was a little over enthusiastic.  What I meant to say was that<br/>
due to various touches such as the initial seperation of the races, Roleplay<br/>
is much easier than with most of the other muds previously available.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think Roleplaying will ever translate effectively through the medium<br/>
of computers, but EQ is as near as I&#39;ve seen myself.<br/>
