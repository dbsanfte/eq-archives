<div id="ygrps-yiv-865757736">Hi Steve,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How are you all finding progression?  I&#39;m in no<br/>
&gt; great hurry, and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; certainly not a power player, but I get the feeling<br/>
&gt; that some class/race<br/>
&gt; combos have a much easier time of it than others,<br/>
&gt; perhaps too much for<br/>
&gt; balance.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in about the same boat as you.  I don&#39;t get to play as often as I&#39;d<br/>
like and I enjoy experimenting with different race/class combos just to<br/>
see if I&#39;m missing something.  My two favorite characters (and most<br/>
often played) are a Dark Elf Warrior and Half-Elf Bard.  I give them<br/>
about equal time and my warrior is 5th level and my bard 3rd.  I&#39;ve<br/>
surfed a good bit to find stats about a variety of topics, but I don&#39;t<br/>
think I&#39;ve found a good source to compare experience levels (or if I<br/>
have, I&#39;ve forgotten).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know the hybrid classes have to earn more<br/>
&gt; experience, but does anyone know<br/>
&gt; any details?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Steve<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I find some good stats, I&#39;ll post them and if anyone has some stats<br/>
or a link, I would be interested to know as well.<br/>
<br/>
Catch you on-line,<br/>
<br/>
