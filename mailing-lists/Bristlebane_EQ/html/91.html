<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907615568">After dabbling in a few races in a few homelands, I really start to hate<br/>
Freeport and the commonlands.  <br/>
<br/>
Did you know that a Troll turn in 3 items (two found on a 1st level monster<br/>
almost all the time, and another available on 4th level monsters occasionally)<br/>
and get an item worth 2+ gp?  And they can do this repeatedly?  Not to mention<br/>
that the 1st and 4th level monsters will often have other items worth 1+ gp on<br/>
them?  Where else in Norrath can you find 1st level monsters dropping cloth<br/>
armor?<br/>
<br/>
I had to hunt high and low in Freeport area for containers, yet in Everfrost<br/>
it seems like every other gnoll pup or goblin whelp drops a box, bag or belt<br/>
pouch.  Oh, and there are 10,000 decaying skels which seem to have a 1 gp<br/>
weapon about 25% of the time.  Also, of the races I&#39;ve seen it seems that the<br/>
Barbarians have the easiest shot at armoring themselves.  Cubs for bearskins<br/>
are about 4th level or so, and are everywhere.  Humans have to wait to kill<br/>
tougher pumas.  The Faydark folk have to fight over the 1 wolf that seems to<br/>
spawn every 10 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, just my little rant for the day.<br/>
<br/>
On a lighter note, my most excellent traveling companions and I have set out<br/>
on a little adventure away from Freeport.  Currently we are on Faydwer and<br/>
have seen many cities and many zones.  I highly recommend travel for anyone of<br/>
sufficient levels.<br/>
