<div id="ygrps-yiv-175706777">Apparently, I was misunderstood.<br/>
    I have no problem with RP, in fact, I am a D&D veteran of almost 20<br/>
years, and I truly understand role playing.  I enjoy hearing of tales from<br/>
afar, of wondrous sights to behold in the characters&#39; home cities, or of<br/>
their abilities against the beasties.  What I asked to have stopped was the<br/>
endless, immature, back-and-forth child-like banter of &quot;Your character<br/>
sucks, and mine is SOOOO superior because...&quot; crap.  Thats all I was asking.<br/>
If this is too much, then fine, I will go away and look for the intelligent<br/>
correspondence I assumed this would be.</div>
