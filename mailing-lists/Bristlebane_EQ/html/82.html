<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538255244">You should also be to the point where you can take on skeletons over at the <br/>
ruins in butcher block... especialy if you have ward undead.  At worst, you <br/>
should be able to team with one other person and be able to take them out.  I <br/>
spent time vanquishing the undead there from levels 6 to 9.<br/>
