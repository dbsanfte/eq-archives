<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738169464"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hello again all. I&#39;ve recently arrived in Freeport and intend on staying<br/>
&gt;there for a while. However, my level 4 cleric can&#39;t yet use the spell Bind<br/>

&gt;someone who does, please drop me a line, (I&#39;m Fenwen in game).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Look for Drugar and Anaxia ( both dwarven clerics). They will charge you<br/>
about 1 plat or so, but you can try to bargain with them. Also, you can<br/>
always to a /who all 12 cl, or /who all 12 ma (and whatever druid is)... and<br/>
that will give you a list of the people at the levels with bind. (Though<br/>
many, like Drugar, are anonymous and won&#39;t show up).<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I make the journey from Felwithe all the way to Freeport without much<br/>
&gt;trouble. I&#39;m wandering around the outsides of Freeport, and I see an asp. I<br/>
&gt;say, there&#39;s low-level stuff around here, it can&#39;t be that hard. Well,<br/>

&gt;the Ocean of Tears, miles away from my destination, with my corpse slowing<br/>
&gt;decaying. So, I says to myself, what now? Well, I decided to swim for it. I<br/>
&gt;make it from 210, 300 to about 210, -8000 (An hour swim, adding in the fact<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, if you lose connection on a boat, you log back in in the ocean. Or, if<br/>
you are very lucky, like me, you&#39;ll log in in a nonexistent spot, and fall<br/>
off the map, ending up under the earth in Butcherblock, unable to get to<br/>
your corpes. A GM got it back for me (about 9 hours later), but it shouldn&#39;t<br/>
have happened in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
I asked the GM if they were going to fix the thing were you log back in from<br/>
the water, and he was like, &#39;No, I think that&#39;s the way it should be - it is<br/>
a dangerous trip!&#39; Well, I totally disagree. To me, if losing link is like<br/>
&#39;passing out&#39; in the virtual world. If you pass out while fighting a<br/>
monster, you&#39;ll die. If you pass out while standing in a field, you&#39;ll be<br/>
standing in a field. If you pass out on a boat - you should still be on the<br/>
boat when you wake up!! The idea that you&#39;d end up in the water is<br/>
ridiculous.<br/>
