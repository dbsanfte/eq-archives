<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126046083">Hello All,<br/>
I am Froogal, a Dwarven Paladin, doing the work of Brell where I may. After<br/>
playing another character on another server, I decided I liked Froogal and<br/>
Bristlebane better than my other Character and Server. I do try to RP a bit,<br/>
but lacking in imagination and practice; my RP skills are weak. I am willing<br/>
to group with just about anyone, provided they are friendly and willing to<br/>
help others when they can. If you see Froogal, be sure and say hello and<br/>
offer him some good deals. He is always in search of a bargain.<br/>
Froogal,<br/>
10th level Paladin,<br/>
