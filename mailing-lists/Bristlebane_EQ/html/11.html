<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059681800">Hello everyone. I play a level 4 mage (seemingly the only class on this <br/>
mailing list) <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I am a level9 Shaman!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and I have a few questions about spells and such. Sorry for the <br/>
list, but it&#39;s the easiest way to get it across. <br/>
1. Since you can only use Bind Affinity at level 12, are you basically stuck<br/>
<br/>
in your home town until then? I find this hard to believe, since warriors <br/>
might not be able to cast it, but some people have said this to be true.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;That is correct.  But, you are not limited to staying at home, just limit<br/>
 </span></blockquote>how far you go in your travels.  If that&#39;s Erudin, then  yeah, maybe you are<br/>
stuck at home.<br/>
<br/>
2. I started training in piercing, and lately I&#39;ve seen most fellow Erudites<br/>
<br/>
carrying staffs or clubs. Was this a mistake? Does it even matter latter on,<br/>
<br/>
as you&#39;ll be fighting in a group and not using melee weapons?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I think that is right too.  At higher levels you wont care about melee<br/>
 </span></blockquote>at all I think.  Then again, I&#39;ve never played a wizard.  My shaman can<br/>
fight melee pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
3. Hey, where&#39;s the music?!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I think I&#39;ve heard that music is only set up for SBLive and &quot;SoundFont&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>cards.  However, I saw a post that they will soon release a patch so it<br/>
works with other sound cards as well.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all. Any help will be greatly appreciated. <br/>
