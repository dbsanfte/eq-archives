&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions on how to keep a debate running smoothly? <br/>
&gt; Maybe call on people to talk.  I don&#39;t want it to be so crazy that noone hears<br/>
&gt; what anyone says.<br/>

looking totems, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we could use what I belive is an American Indian custom. Only the<br/>
person holding the &quot;stick&quot; may speak, then they must pass it on.</div>
