<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121141273">Since shout is for roleplaying I was thinking of holding it there.  The previous<br/>
2 ideas are great but I think it would be almost imposible to keep a running<br/>
list while everyone is speaking.  Messages scroll by too fast.  Instead of holding<br/>
a stick maybe have a speaking block and a line behind it.  So everyone lines<br/>
up and gets to talk for a minute or so. (Gets 3 messages) and gets back in line<br/>
if he chooses.  Maybe we can try it free style at first and then move to ordered<br/>
if needed.</div>
