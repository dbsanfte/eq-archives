<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377847923">I think it would work if someone took charge and drew up a schedule.  Post<br/>
on all the news site that you wanted to have the weekly festival and ask for<br/>
guild or volenteers to host it.  So anyone or any guild has the chance to host<br/>
their own gathering.  That way not one group controls the tunnel on Sundays<br/>
and there ends up being a festival every week.  I hope that made sense =)</div>
