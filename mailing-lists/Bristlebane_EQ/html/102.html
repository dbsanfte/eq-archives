<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606863891">Hehe....Ya, Sneak can be DAMN valuable.  I had a buddy running around<br/>
Blackburrow, and he fell into that Tree Pit Trap.  You know the one, it<br/>
drops you JUST outside the attack radius of several nasties.   He used his<br/>
Sneak, and Hide, to walk right out.  If you work on it, and train in it, you<br/>
too can have remarkable success.<br/>

&gt;What skills?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Also, has anyone noticed that sometimes the &quot;Sneak&quot; skill just doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; work?  You hit Sneak and you continue to walk/run at normal speed?  Then<br/>

&gt;When you move at half speed, it&#39;s working.<br/>

&gt;Sneak does not equate to invisibility or anything approaching such I<br/>
&gt;fear.<br/>
&gt;If anyone here has had any good experiences with it, I&#39;d love to hear<br/>
&gt;them, otherwise, as far as I can tell, it&#39;s pretty useless.<br/>
