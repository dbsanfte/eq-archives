<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715689393">We now have ~75 subscribers, yet all I see are messages from me and a couple<br/>
of crazy magicky types.  What&#39;s up with that?  Please everyone jump in and<br/>
introduce yourself.  You can role play or not, but share who your char. is and<br/>
where you often adventure.  Never know who you might run into out there.<br/>
<br/>
Zardoz, to submit any information or questions or topics to this forum, just<br/>
email (to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bristlebane_eq@onelist.com">bristlebane_eq@onelist.com</a>) just like you did!  It is automatically<br/>
distributed to everyone.  Currently I am not monitoring/appproving each mail,<br/>
and I hope not to ever have to.<br/>
<br/>
Itan, I would love to join you someday in your quest to rid Norrath of those<br/>
wretched necros.  There is little that pleases me more than kicking a skelly<br/>
to bits.  My land is especially infected as we have those pointy-eared inkies<br/>
running about with their boney pets.<br/>
