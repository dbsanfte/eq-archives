<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782696066">Do these skills ever go &quot;up&quot; at all?<br/>
�<br/>
I mean, they are not listed in the skill list to &quot;put points into&quot; and I&#39;ve<br/>
never seen the skill increase through usage.<br/>
�<br/>
I have built a Halfling Druid, who has these abilities.� Am I to expect that<br/>
these abilities will work just as well now as they will when I attain level<br/>
20?<br/>
�<br/>
Also, has anyone noticed that sometimes the &quot;Sneak&quot; skill just doesn&#39;t<br/>
work?� You hit Sneak and you continue to walk/run at normal speed?� Then it<br/>
becomes available to use it again and you try again etc.� Sooner or later it<br/>
&quot;works.&quot;<br/>
�<br/>
To top it off, how do you know if it&#39;s &quot;really&quot; working?<br/>
�<br/>
I&#39;ve had aggressive monsters run right past me while I was sneaking, only to<br/>
have them see me on other occasions.� Same monsters.<br/>
�<br/>
These are very interesting skills, but I need to know how they really work!<br/>
�<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
