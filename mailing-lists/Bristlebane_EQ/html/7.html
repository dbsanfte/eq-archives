<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264940838">Yes Itan, I can imagne you have a lot of work to be done: mostly in <br/>
striving to get even the most meager grasp of the Arcane Arts, which I, <br/>
the Great Zardoz, am most supreme at using!  Hah!<br/>
<br/>
OOC: anyone got a clue as to how to get from the wood elves tree city to <br/>
the city of the dwarves?   <br/>

Zardoz you weak minded fool!<br/>
<br/>
I accept without arguement that High Elves have been around a while, <br/>
butthen, so have the Giants.  Age is no guarantee of intellect.  Face it <br/>
Elf, Erud and all his followers have perfected the art of magic to a <br/>
degree that you can simply never achieve.<br/>
<br/>
We are more intelligent than you, get over it.<br/>
<br/>
It is good to see, however, that even less intelligent people like <br/>
yourself can see the necros for what they are.  They should all be <br/>
rounded up and burned in the eternal fire of Solusek&#39;s wrath.  Perhaps <br/>
you would like to help gather wood for the pyre?<br/>
<br/>
Enough idle chatter, I have work to be done.<br/>
<br/>
Your Superior,<br/>
<br/>
Itan the Whistler.<br/>
