&gt; Thanks for the support Cronus.<br/>

&gt; I believe EQ is custom made for RP, and it&#39;s difficult to see how it could<br/>
&gt; survive without at least some RPers on each server.<br/>

Everquest is at it&#39;s roots, an lpc mud.<br/>
lpc muds are about hack and slash.<br/>
Everquest is very nicely graphical, but I&#39;d hardly say that it demands, or<br/>
even encourages Roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
To really encourage Roleplay, I&#39;d say that you need a much more indepth<br/>
background system. Something to help define and differntiate your<br/>
character from every other Halas Barbarian Warrior or Freeport Monk.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t to say that some roleplay isn&#39;t possible, or even enjoyable<br/>
when it does happen. <br/>
Merely that I continually fail to see why people continually say that<br/>
Everquest is 1)all about roleplaying 2)powergaming is a naughty word.<br/>
