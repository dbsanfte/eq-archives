I will agree that you have strengths and weaknesses like any other.  Indeed,<br/>
your speed is something to be in awe of; although somehow I doubt you could<br/>
out run everything, or even everybody.  Be careful of unfounded confidence<br/>
my barbarian friend.<br/>
<br/>
Let us agree to disagree as to which race is the superior.  It will be a<br/>
waste of energy (ooc: and upset a few people on this list no doubt), and<br/>
neither of us will convince the other, of that I am certain.<br/>
