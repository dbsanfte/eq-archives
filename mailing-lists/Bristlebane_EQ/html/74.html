&gt; OK, so if increased difficulty was EQ&#39;s goal... what is the point?  If we went<br/>
&gt; back in there 5 levels from now we would survive the &quot;hot&quot; spawns better, but<br/>
&gt; nothing would give us XP anymore.  If the goal was anti-camping then they<br/>
&gt; should lower the spawn rate a bit, as there is no way we could hack our way in<br/>
&gt; to our intended target, then hack our way back out through the near-immediate<br/>
&gt; respawns.  If we were high enough level to do so, again we&#39;d hardly get XP for<br/>
&gt; the accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think a reasonable parallel could be drawn between this, and design<br/>
tricks such as<br/>
the constant flow of wandering creatures in Japanese RPG&#39;s, and some of<br/>
the lenghty continual jumps needed in Tomb Raider. <br/>
They&#39;re all &#39;cheese&#39; attempts to lengthen gameplay that really don&#39;t add<br/>
any enjoyment to what you&#39;re doing. Does anyone really like dying the<br/>
first time they make an attempted jump in TR? Does anyone really like<br/>
fighting so many times in Final Fantasy 7 that it&#39;s not uncommon to<br/>
forget where you were going by the time you&#39;re halfway there?<br/>
No. <br/>
But game designers continually put such things in because these are easy<br/>
solutions to address serious level design flaws.<br/>
<br/>
In Everquest&#39;s case, I think we&#39;ve seen the results. While I was not in<br/>
Beta, there&#39;s a distinct lack of exploration and risk taking because of<br/>
all the sudden death monsters running around. I&#39;ve gotten the impression<br/>
that this was not the case in the beta tests.<br/>
<br/>
To expand on this a bit, let me point not at Befallen, but at the East<br/>
Commonlands as an example.<br/>
<br/>
How is it even plausibly defensible to put not one, but on occassion<br/>
FOUR griffins into what is designed as a 5-8 lvl area(yes parts of it<br/>
are higher level, but should be considered sub-zones for the point of<br/>
this discussion)?<br/>
<br/>
For those of you whom have not seen Griffins, let me explain. They are<br/>
invunerable to normal attacks and have been known to eat several<br/>
shopkeepers and a few guards before boredly flying away.  They are not<br/>
limited to the upper level sections of the zone, and frequently are seen<br/>
in the parts closest to East Freeport; the same parts where newbies just<br/>
beginning to leave the newbie zone outside of their city are beginning<br/>
to hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Let me also point out the latest patch revision. A paraphrased quote:<br/>
&#39;Safe zones were removed to prevent exploitation.&#39; <br/>
 <br/>
Examples such as these are haphazard solutions and hacks to poor<br/>
level(or zone if you will) design. Some will probably argue at this<br/>
point that they are most likely interim solutions only and will most<br/>
likely be changed in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, my view of this, is that such actions are becoming<br/>
increasingly characteristic of how EQ is run. Which is to say,<br/>
haphazardly slapdash solutions being applied without careful thought and<br/>
recognition of how to solve any problems that may arise. It adds to an<br/>
ever increasing feeling that this is just all some final beta test<br/>
before Everquest 2 comes out in a year or two. <br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t to say that I don&#39;t fully enjoy Everquest. I&#39;ve spent many a<br/>
sleepless day since the day this game came out playing it. This post is<br/>
not meant to be taken as &#39;Josh&#39;s thesis on Why Everquest Sucks&#39;. It&#39;s<br/>
merely that there are some serious issues that need to be brought up and<br/>
discussed. The game is good. It could have been a hell of a lot better.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;From a player point of view, the only solution to this situation is to wait<br/>
&gt; until there are enough PCs in a zone to make it safe to inhabit.  But then you<br/>
&gt; lose out on all the fun of being the few brave souls alone in a zone.  And you<br/>
&gt; also end up with previously deadly zones like Blackburrow reduced to a gaggle<br/>
&gt; of players standing around *WAITING* for something to spawn because they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; all killed everything.  I&#39;ve seen more suspense and danger at Wal-Mart.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re already seeing this in parts of Befallen. There&#39;s definitely the<br/>
beginnings of some crowding in certain area&#39;s, because of the dangers of<br/>
risk taking. It&#39;s infinitely safer to walk around the castle than it is<br/>
to explore the unknown. This is why I think we see the Insta-Death<br/>
critters and such. It&#39;s increasingly becoming a damned if you do, damned<br/>
if you don&#39;t situation and won&#39;t be resolved anytime soon.<br/>
