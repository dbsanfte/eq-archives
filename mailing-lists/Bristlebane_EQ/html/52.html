<div id="ygrps-yiv-572330610">Bits of advice for these email lists...<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t reply-as-attachment or forward-as-attachment to the group.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think people getting the digest version will get these attachments.<br/>
<br/>
If your email box starts getting spammy, consider signing up for the digest<br/>
version (compiles the whole day&#39;s group emails into one message).<br/>
<br/>
If you reply to a specific topic, consider editing out some of the extra bits<br/>
so your message stays as efficient as possible.<br/>
<br/>
**If you are going to give a SPOILER or discuss a QUEST, please state so in<br/>
the SUBJECT.  This gives people the chance to skip your mail if they want<br/>
to.**<br/>
<br/>
People getting the digest version will often seem to be &quot;behind&quot; the<br/>
conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Each person&#39;s email address appears in their message, so if you want to<br/>
contact them directly about something you can do so.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>
