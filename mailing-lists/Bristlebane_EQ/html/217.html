<b>Subject:</b> Update: Enlightenment Gathering on Bristlebane <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359832562">WHAT: Enlightenment Gathering<br/>
WHEN: Sunday, June 13th 3:00 PM Pacific (5:00 PM Central)<br/>
WHERE: The Ever-Popular Tunnel to North Ro Desert in the East Commonlands<br/>
WHO: All races and classes are welcomed<br/>
SERVER: Bristlebane<br/>
EVENTS: <br/>
    Philosophy Discussion<br/>
    Trade Discussion<br/>
    Language Lessons<br/>
    Low Level Scavenger Hunt<br/>
    Open Market<br/>
 <br/>
This is a ROLE-PLAYING EVENT.  On that note the only requirement is that there is to be no fighting or duels.  This is an event to expand the mind and not to lower the participants to the depths of violence and war.  <br/>
 <br/>
For those who wish to participate in the Philosophy Discussion please read the documents on the web page below, from the current response it will be a large topic of the discussion.<br/>
 <br/>
We are in need of people to share the language of their race.  Anyone who would help share their language please contact us.  (The normal languages, like Halfling, Ogre, Barbarian, and the like are what we are looking for.)<br/>
 <br/>
We are also in need people who wish to speak about their trade.  Anyone who would help share their knowledge of a trade please contact us.  (Anyone hosting a trade discussion will have the market on selling their trade items at the gathering ;) )<br/>
 <br/>
There will be a group lead from Qeynos to Freeport on Saturday.  We will advertise in Qeynos at 10:00 AM Pacific (12:00 AM Central) and try to leave about 11:00 AM Pacific (12:00 PM Central).  There may be another escort on Sunday depending on demand.  <br/>
