&gt; I asked the GM if they were going to fix the thing were you log back in from<br/>
&gt; the water, and he was like, &#39;No, I think that&#39;s the way it should be - it is<br/>
&gt; a dangerous trip!&#39; Well, I totally disagree. To me, if losing link is like<br/>
&gt; &#39;passing out&#39; in the virtual world. If you pass out while fighting a<br/>
&gt; monster, you&#39;ll die. If you pass out while standing in a field, you&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt; standing in a field. If you pass out on a boat - you should still be on the<br/>
&gt; boat when you wake up!! The idea that you&#39;d end up in the water is<br/>
&gt; ridiculous.<br/>

collision detection.<br/>
Here comes a kodiak through the back wall, and it&#39;s failing to trigger<br/>
the NPC as he claws me through it.<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of boat stories, here&#39;s mine:<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever gotten stuck between the sides of the boat and the<br/>
Freeport dock?<br/>
  more than once?<br/>
  four times?<br/>
  in a row?<br/>
  but managed to do the jump right in front of Fentil the GM after<br/>
/petitioning several times?<br/>
  but also managed to get some really cool screen shots of you floating<br/>
in the air?<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever explored the boat?<br/>
   And managed to walk through the walls of the bar into the ocean?<br/>
   And raise your swimming skill 30 points until the next boat came<br/>
back?<br/>
   And than swam back through the front of the boat into the bar?<br/>
   Only to have the game crash on you and kick you back into the ocean?<br/>
   And then do it again when you catch the boat again this way?<br/>
   And remember to /petition this time as well?<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever seen the message, &#39;You may only have one /petition in the<br/>
queue at a time&#39;?<br/>
    Multiple times?<br/>
    you have GM WHO as a hotkey so you know when to submit your<br/>
/petitions?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dirque.<br/>
I hate boats.</div>
