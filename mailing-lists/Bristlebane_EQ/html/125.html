<div id="ygrps-yiv-524167353">I am Heidrich, a 7th level Paladin. I reside in the city of Qeynos.  <br/>
Of late, I have spent the majority of my time slaying lions and <br/>
grizzly bears in the Karanas with my fellow adventurer Rastaman, who <br/>
is an 8th level warrior.  My point is, we started adventuring <br/>
together when we both hit level 5.  We found that I got 65-70% as <br/>
much xp as he did for killing enemies in a group.  Now I do not know <br/>
what the exact figure is, but that is what we found.  That is why he <br/>
has progressed to level 8 and I still remain at 7.  However, the <br/>
hybrid class benefits, in my opinion,  far outweigh any extra xp-<br/>
gaining time. <br/>
