<div id="ygrps-yiv-16770902"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Does anyone recommend using my coin to buy the higher order<br/>
&gt; armor for now or wait until higher levels where I can generate a<br/>
&gt; little more coin and just save my coin now for spells at level 9?<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions are certainly welcome.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I may be wrong here, but I believe that higher order armour is of little<br/>
use to a lower level character.  You will not gain the extra AC<br/>
benefit at lower levels as your character is deemed to not be<br/>
experienced enough to make the best use of it.<br/>
Go for the spells.  They are what make you a cleric my friend.<br/>
