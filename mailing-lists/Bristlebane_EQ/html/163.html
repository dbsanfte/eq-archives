<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435060880">Can any of you tell me where to get &quot;vials?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Are these items that can be made with pottery?  Also, concerning pottery,<br/>
have any of you made an actual &quot;profit&quot; off of this skill?<br/>
<br/>
I have heard that we need &quot;vials&quot; for Alchemy (I am a Shaman).  But no one<br/>
knows where to get the darn things.  If pottery is the secret to that, then<br/>
I guess I should dump those unused points into pottery!<br/>
