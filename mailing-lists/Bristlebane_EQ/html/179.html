<div id="ygrps-yiv-958797540">Hail all!<br/>
<br/>
  I have a question about the Paladin quest in Nfreeport. It&#39;s the one about <br/>
the tokens of courage and generosity, anyone know where i can find those <br/>
tokens he did not give any hints whatsoever:(  <br/>
   Also the dwarven ringmail tunic, i understand that&#39;s it&#39;s for small races <br/>
only? but I seen a couple of high-elves wearing them, so is it possible for <br/>
human to wear it as well? <br/>
  Any help will be greatly appreciated, thanx!<br/>
<br/>
