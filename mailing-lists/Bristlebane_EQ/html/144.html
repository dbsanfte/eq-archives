<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102342241">Personally I agree with you. As a cleric I heal everyone for free along<br/>
with any buffs provided my mana is stable and I&#39;m near healthy. In<br/>
fact, the only time I&#39;ve ever received coin for my services was a soul<br/>
who needed water and I was in need of food. He gave me an article I<br/>
could sell so that my needs were met as well. I realize the AI in the<br/>
game probably doesn&#39;t have the true equivalent of Karma but near as I<br/>
can tell &quot;what goes around comes around&quot;.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Just wondering what you meant by &quot;Almost<br/>
&gt; Last-Named&quot;. <br/>
&gt; &gt; When do you reach a point where you earn such a<br/>
&gt; thing?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lvl 20 or so I think.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; P.S. -&gt; If anyone has any spare putrid rib bones,<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; would be greatly appreciated as I&#39;m dying to get<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; next quest completed ;).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t help but feel greatly aggravated at the<br/>
&gt; number of people who sit<br/>
&gt; there and camp at the ruins in the hopes of taking<br/>
&gt; advantage of monks who<br/>
&gt; desperately need putrid rib bones. I find this<br/>
&gt; amazingly lame. It ranks up<br/>
&gt; there with clerics charging for heals and other such<br/>
&gt; things.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s like a tank charging to party with you or some<br/>
&gt; other such nonsense.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Those clerics who do keep it free have my undying<br/>
&gt; loyalty.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
