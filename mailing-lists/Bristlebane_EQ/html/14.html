<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101561500">(ooc: Itan I hope you get this.  I dearly love flaming you erudites, <br/>
hehe)<br/>
Izin, put down your play things and pay attention: you&#39;re about to <br/>
receive instruction from the fount of all knowledge.<br/>
*sigh* Once again I, Zardoz the Great High Elven Mage, shall instruct <br/>
those barbarians who call themselves Erudites.  You poor vacant skulled, <br/>
dabbler, it&#39;s simple.  Bribe someone to bind you to where you wish to <br/>
return.  In the great and marvelous city/fortress of Felwithe there are <br/>
lots of clerics and mages quite willing to take pity on one such as you <br/>
and will bind you.  Offering a few pp would probably help your cause a <br/>
lot also.  So, wherever it is you wish to return to, upon your demise, <br/>
have a more astute worker of the arcane arts perform this  binding for <br/>
you.<br/>
(OOC: most higher level clerics or mages will do it for free if you ask <br/>
nice.  at least I would.)<br/>
Concerning staffs: All who are wise in the way of the world know this, <br/>
my slow witted one, that staves and two handed staves do much more <br/>
damage than daggers. ( OOC: a one handed staff has the potential for <br/>
more damage than the timing penalty increase you incur for using it; <br/>
more bash for just a little more time.  however never neglect to pickup <br/>
that handy spell: summon dagger.   hehe  it insures you&#39;ll always have a <br/>
weapon if you need one.)<br/>
If any of you vastly uninformed erudites out there have more questions <br/>
that need answering, I will gladly help enlighten you.  After all is it <br/>
not the responsibility of the older, more astute races to guide, even <br/>
tolerate, the babbling of the youner, definitely more dim witted races, <br/>
like Erudites and Humans???<br/>

Hello everyone. I play a level 4 mage (seemingly the only class on this <br/>
mailing list) and I have a few questions about spells and such. Sorry <br/>
for the <br/>
list, but it&#39;s the easiest way to get it across. <br/>
1. Since you can only use Bind Affinity at level 12, are you basically <br/>
stuck <br/>
in your home town until then? I find this hard to believe, since <br/>
warriors <br/>
might not be able to cast it, but some people have said this to be true.<br/>
2. I started training in piercing, and lately I&#39;ve seen most fellow <br/>
Erudites <br/>
carrying staffs or clubs. Was this a mistake? Does it even matter latter <br/>
on, <br/>
as you&#39;ll be fighting in a group and not using melee weapons?<br/>
3. Hey, where&#39;s the music?!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all. Any help will be greatly appreciated. <br/>
<br/>
Izin<br/>
