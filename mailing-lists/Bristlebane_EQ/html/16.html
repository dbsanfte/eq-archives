&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello everyone. I play a level 4 mage (seemingly the<br/>
&gt; only class on this <br/>
&gt; mailing list) <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I am a level9 Shaman!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>nay, wizards are not the only class here... just the loudest!<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and I have a few questions about spells and such.<br/>
&gt; Sorry for the <br/>
&gt; list, but it&#39;s the easiest way to get it across. <br/>
&gt; 1. Since you can only use Bind Affinity at level 12,<br/>
&gt; are you basically stuck<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; in your home town until then? I find this hard to<br/>
&gt; believe, since warriors <br/>
&gt; might not be able to cast it, but some people have<br/>
&gt; said this to be true.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;That is correct.  But, you are not limited to<br/>
&gt; staying at home, just limit<br/>
&gt; how far you go in your travels.  If that&#39;s Erudin,<br/>
&gt; then  yeah, maybe you are<br/>
&gt; stuck at home.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>actually that is not completely correct.  you are only stuck there if<br/>
you rely completely on yourself.  Others can cast Bind Affinity upon<br/>
you.  If your travels take you across the ocean, try to find a<br/>
high-level wizard to Bind you there.  You spell-slingers all get along<br/>
pretty well, don&#39;t ya?<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2. I started training in piercing, and lately I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; seen most fellow Eruditescarrying staffs or clubs. <br/>
&gt; Was this a mistake? Does it even matter latter on,<br/>
&gt; as you&#39;ll be fighting in a group and not using melee<br/>
&gt; weapons?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I think that is right too.  At higher levels you<br/>
&gt; wont care about melee<br/>
&gt; at all I think.  Then again, I&#39;ve never played a<br/>
&gt; wizard.  My shaman can<br/>
&gt; fight melee pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Circumstances and your personality will dictate what you need.  If<br/>
you&#39;re a powergamer, then go to one of the EQ sites and check out the<br/>
stats.  I think most eventually prefer staves, but if you&#39;re not as<br/>
worried about the numbers you might just want to stick with the dagger.<br/>
 Otherwise you&#39;ve blown your investment...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3. Hey, where&#39;s the music?!<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I think I&#39;ve heard that music is only set up for<br/>
&gt; SBLive and &quot;SoundFont&quot;<br/>
&gt; cards.  However, I saw a post that they will soon<br/>
&gt; release a patch so it<br/>
&gt; works with other sound cards as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s all. Any help will be greatly appreciated. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Izin<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I heard the same thing.  I understand it&#39;s currently available on the<br/>
Test Server... and they could always use more help.<br/>
