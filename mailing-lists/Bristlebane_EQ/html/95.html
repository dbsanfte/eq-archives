&gt; After dabbling in a few races in a few homelands, I really start to hate<br/>
&gt; Freeport and the commonlands.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It does seem Freeport gets the short end of the stick so to speak.<br/>
You&#39;ve all heard my rants<br/>
on level design here, so I won&#39;t repeat.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Did you know that a Troll turn in 3 items (two found on a 1st level monster<br/>
&gt; almost all the time, and another available on 4th level monsters occasionally)<br/>
&gt; and get an item worth 2+ gp?  And they can do this repeatedly?  Not to mention<br/>
&gt; that the 1st and 4th level monsters will often have other items worth 1+ gp on<br/>
&gt; them?  Where else in Norrath can you find 1st level monsters dropping cloth<br/>
&gt; armor?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where else can a 10th lvl monk go fight blue and green critters and get<br/>
magically delicious armor as well?<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I had to hunt high and low in Freeport area for containers, yet in Everfrost<br/>
&gt; it seems like every other gnoll pup or goblin whelp drops a box, bag or belt<br/>
&gt; pouch.  Oh, and there are 10,000 decaying skels which seem to have a 1 gp<br/>
&gt; weapon about 25% of the time.  Also, of the races I&#39;ve seen it seems that the<br/>
&gt; Barbarians have the easiest shot at armoring themselves.  Cubs for bearskins<br/>
&gt; are about 4th level or so, and are everywhere.  Humans have to wait to kill<br/>
&gt; tougher pumas.  The Faydark folk have to fight over the 1 wolf that seems to<br/>
&gt; spawn every 10 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Neriak is much the same way. Freeport has a certain amount of mobility<br/>
and freedom in travel. However, the other races that are more trapped in<br/>
their areas(trolls, dark elves, barbarians) have areas that are much<br/>
better designed and allow for a person to stay in one zone and level way<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Oh well, just my little rant for the day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a lighter note, my most excellent traveling companions and I have set out<br/>
&gt; on a little adventure away from Freeport.  Currently we are on Faydwer and<br/>
&gt; have seen many cities and many zones.  I highly recommend travel for anyone of<br/>
&gt; sufficient levels.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thing is, the Faydark(both greater and lesser) really aren&#39;t all that<br/>
great. I&#39;ve hit a few zones there(Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron is *gorgeous* at<br/>
night), but never been all that impressed with the monsies in most of<br/>
the areas. Admittedly, this may have been because I was spending much of<br/>
my time sneaking and running like a little girl from them. The joys of<br/>
low level travel. Ah.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend however that much like Rivervale, Ak&#39;Anon should be<br/>
visited at least once for pure shock value.<br/>
