<br/>
I&#39;d like to add something to the Bristlebane community, so here&#39;s what I&#39;ve<br/>
learnt about skills.<br/>
<br/>
Your skill cap is 5 + 5 x current level. So, a level 1 character has a skill<br/>
cap of 10 in each of his skills, and a level 10 character has a skill cap of<br/>
55. You raise your skills by using them (once you have attained the basics),<br/>
so yes, they wil go up if you practice/use them until you reach your level<br/>
cap.<br/>
<br/>
Sneak is a tricky skill. Every time you use it you will turn invisible in<br/>
your external view and you will walk real slow but this does not mean that<br/>
it is working. I have heard that the only way to tell if sneak has worked is<br/>
to ask another NPC if you dissapeared from their view. I think the same is<br/>
true for the hide skill.<br/>

Do these skills ever go &quot;up&quot; at all?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, they are not listed in the skill list to &quot;put points into&quot; and I&#39;ve<br/>
never seen the skill increase through usage.<br/>
<br/>
I have built a Halfling Druid, who has these abilities. Am I to expect that<br/>
these abilities will work just as well now as they will when I attain level<br/>
20?<br/>
<br/>
Also, has anyone noticed that sometimes the &quot;Sneak&quot; skill just doesn&#39;t<br/>
work? You hit Sneak and you continue to walk/run at normal speed? Then it<br/>
becomes available to use it again and you try again etc. Sooner or later it<br/>
&quot;works.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To top it off, how do you know if it&#39;s &quot;really&quot; working?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had aggressive monsters run right past me while I was sneaking, only to<br/>
have them see me on other occasions. Same monsters.<br/>
<br/>
These are very interesting skills, but I need to know how they really work!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
