<div id="ygrps-yiv-302749656">This Gathering is an excellent idea, however Roleplayers may wish to take a<br/>
careful look at the guilds home page.<br/>
Apparently Mithaniel Marr and Erolisi Marr are respectively the Father of<br/>
Lies and The Seducing Goddess of War.  Sounds like a good way to start a<br/>
&quot;lively&quot; discussion with some Freeport Paladins anyway.  Barbarian Shaman<br/>
may also be miffed to note that apparently the Guards of Norrath follow The<br/>
Tribunal. (If only - those darkies in Neriak KOS me real bad, despite that<br/>
fact I worship The Six Hammers)<br/>
<br/>
Anyways I am sure Talorc will do his level best to show up and do some<br/>
&quot;discussing&quot;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;All are invited to debate in a somewhat ordered discussion of the gods,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;ignorance, and other important issues. (Of course this will be done in<br/>
&gt;character and will be a great opportunity for role-playing. We wish to also<br/>
&gt;argue some of the player written Norrathian history contained on the web<br/>
&gt;page above.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Trade Discussion<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We will devote a bit of time talking about each trade, including research.<br/>
&gt;Hopefully we will answer any questions and peak the interest of those who<br/>
&gt;havenï¿½t discovered the wonders of the different trades. (If you wish to<br/>

&gt;days.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Language Lessons<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This will mainly be devoted to sharing the normal race languages so that we<br/>
&gt;may all understand each other better. Any citizens wishing to share their<br/>
&gt;knowledge of the elder languages is certainly welcomed hold free classes,<br/>
&gt;but we ask that there be no selling of languages. Participants my tip their<br/>
&gt;teachers but (If you wish to share your language please contact me, I will<br/>
&gt;post a running list on the web page in a few days.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Scavenger Hunt<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This will be for some of our younger attendees (anyone 7th level or lower).<br/>
&gt;Participants may form groups if desired but must share their prize. All the<br/>
&gt;items will be found close to the tunnel (only in the zones adjacent to the<br/>
&gt;east commons). There will be prizes for all that partake in this quest.<br/>
&gt;(There will be a story to go with the hunt.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Open Market<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And of course as with every event in Norrath, there will be the selling of<br/>
&gt;goods. We would like mainly self-made goods to be sold here. Though the<br/>
&gt;selling of acquired items is not prohibited, we encourage tradesmen to make<br/>
&gt;a bigger showing. (The method of sales will be announced later on the web<br/>
&gt;page.)<br/>
