<div id="ygrps-yiv-386439463">Hail all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to take a moment to introduce myself. I am Kanamur of Khaladim. I am a cleric of the Dwarven race, many of you I already know through your hospitality, and kindness to me in times past. For those who I haven&#39;t had the pleasure of meeting yet, Well met! If you ever see me, and need a good healing, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Good day to all.<br/>
<br/>
Kanamur.</div>
