&gt; Speaking of Trolls and their cloth armor collected from level 1 kills, I<br/>
&gt; found a magic netted shirt that was 4AC.  This was equivalent of the AC on<br/>
&gt; my guild tunic but when I offered it to a merchant, they were ready to buy<br/>
&gt; it from me for 8 gold.  I still don&#39;t know what&#39;s magical about it though.<br/>
&gt; It doesn&#39;t improve any skills or stats that I can see.<br/>

being fully armored and under 15 lbs. <br/>
To be a bit more fair, gloves tend to be the real draw for monks at<br/>
first. They make your hand to hand attacks magical.<br/>
