Although I dare say that amongst your people you are most wise and<br/>
benevelant, but you are, by definition, Barbaric.<br/>
<br/>
You are the backward fathers of the backward human race.  We Erudites have<br/>
risen above both humans and Barbarians, and Elves too for that matter, by a<br/>
process of evolution.<br/>
<br/>
I do not mean to insult, but we are better than you.<br/>
<br/>
I am what I am, and you are unfortunate.<br/>
