<div id="ygrps-yiv-275375521">I&#39;m happy to see my friends and acquaintances joining this group!  I&#39;d name<br/>
names but I&#39;d undoubtedly miss someone and I&#39;d hate to offend.  This poor monk<br/>
is still a bit addled after some rather heinous deaths recently.  Its<br/>
especially nice to have a storyteller in our midst, as it gives me something<br/>
to do while I heal... and heal... and heal. <br/>
<br/>
Xeones - you greedy fiend.  One of these days you&#39;ll abandon your lust for<br/>
expensive bits of metal and learn the true art of combat.  That said, remind<br/>
me to examine our heads next time we romp around the Dervish camp.  Owie.<br/>
