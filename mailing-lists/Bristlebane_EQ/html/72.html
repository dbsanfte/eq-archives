&gt; I&#39;m happy to see my friends and acquaintances joining this group!  I&#39;d name<br/>
&gt; names but I&#39;d undoubtedly miss someone and I&#39;d hate to offend.  This poor monk<br/>
&gt; is still a bit addled after some rather heinous deaths recently.  Its<br/>
&gt; especially nice to have a storyteller in our midst, as it gives me something<br/>
&gt; to do while I heal... and heal... and heal.<br/>

those Orc Cents I am going to set a mocking hot key and hit it about 100<br/>
times next time I see you online.<br/>

these material goods!<br/>
