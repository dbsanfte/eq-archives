<br/>
I accept without arguement that High Elves have been around a while, but<br/>
then, so have the Giants.  Age is no guarantee of intellect.  Face it Elf,<br/>
Erud and all his followers have perfected the art of magic to a degree that<br/>
you can simply never achieve.<br/>
<br/>
We are more intelligent than you, get over it.<br/>
<br/>
It is good to see, however, that even less intelligent people like yourself<br/>
can see the necros for what they are.  They should all be rounded up and<br/>
burned in the eternal fire of Solusek&#39;s wrath.  Perhaps you would like to<br/>
help gather wood for the pyre?<br/>
<br/>
Enough idle chatter, I have work to be done.<br/>
<br/>
Your Superior,<br/>

Itan the Whistler.<br/>

OOC: I&#39;ll add you to my friends list and hope are paths cross at some point.</div>
