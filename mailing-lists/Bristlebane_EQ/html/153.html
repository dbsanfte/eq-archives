<div id="ygrps-yiv-952834386"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Fellow Norrathians:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would like to make a small change in my previous message regarding<br/>
&gt;the North Qeynos Auction/Trade show on the Bristlebane Server:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I said all good-aligned characters are invited,  I meant all<br/>
&gt;characters that will not be attacked by the Qeynos City Guards.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well actually, I think it may be interesting to formally invite ALL races,<br/>
namely because some things which are common in other places are rare in<br/>
Qeynos, etc, and thus would make the auction much more interesting.<br/>
<br/>
For things like this on other servers, they have offered &#39;invisible&#39;<br/>
services, allowing them to sneak past any relevant guards. My mage will be<br/>
willing to help out with this, as I&#39;m sure others will.<br/>
