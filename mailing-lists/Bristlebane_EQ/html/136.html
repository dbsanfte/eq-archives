<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242265132">Other than seeing those occasional &quot;your faction has increased with So-and-so&quot;<br/>
messages, does anyone else find it scary that you have NO idea what any<br/>
particular group might think of you and what that means for your general<br/>
safety?<br/>
<br/>
Members of the crew I regularly adventure with made a few enemies among the<br/>
Freeport militia.  Now many of the Freeport guards will attack them.  Ok, that<br/>
one was fairly predictable.  However, when we adventured to Kaladim, one of<br/>
these people was killed by a dwarven guard (StormGuard).  I&#39;m not sure that we<br/>
figured out exactly why.  The guard shouted something about his god, but he<br/>
shares a god with others in our group.  Was it related to the Freeport thing? <br/>
We may never know.<br/>
<br/>
I wish they would tell you when you select your god what the repercussions<br/>
might be.  Picking one of the ultra-evil ones has obvious drawbacks, but we<br/>
have no way of knowing what selecting any of the others will do to you.  And<br/>
once in the game what are you supposed to do?  Two PCs conning an NPC often<br/>
results in similar messages (&quot;regards you dubiously&quot; or something like that)<br/>
yet only one PC will be attacked.  Kind of an expensive guessing game.<br/>
<br/>
Just my ponder for the day.  Talk amongst yourselves.<br/>
