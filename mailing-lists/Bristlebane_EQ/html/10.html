<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989434631">Hello everyone. I play a level 4 mage (seemingly the only class on this <br/>
mailing list) and I have a few questions about spells and such. Sorry for the <br/>
list, but it&#39;s the easiest way to get it across. <br/>
1. Since you can only use Bind Affinity at level 12, are you basically stuck <br/>
in your home town until then? I find this hard to believe, since warriors <br/>
might not be able to cast it, but some people have said this to be true.<br/>
2. I started training in piercing, and lately I&#39;ve seen most fellow Erudites <br/>
carrying staffs or clubs. Was this a mistake? Does it even matter latter on, <br/>
as you&#39;ll be fighting in a group and not using melee weapons?<br/>
3. Hey, where&#39;s the music?!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all. Any help will be greatly appreciated. <br/>
<br/>
Izin</div>
