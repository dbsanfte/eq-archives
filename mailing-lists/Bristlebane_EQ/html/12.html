&gt;Hello everyone. I play a level 4 mage (seemingly the only class on this <br/>
&gt;mailing list) <br/>
&gt;and I have a few questions about spells and such. Sorry for the <br/>

My name is Relyn, and I&#39;m a 6th level Cleric of Innoruk.  To answer your <br/>

a 12th level+ caster cast it on you.<br/>
