<div id="ygrps-yiv-930258507">Required is a loose term here.  Since a bard can always sing the same tune.<br/>
However, using the wrong instrument or singing a song that &quot;requires&quot; an<br/>
instrument doesn&#39;t produce the same effect as singing the song with the<br/>
proper instrument.  For example, when singing Hymn of Restoration, the<br/>
Bard&#39;s healing song, you will gain roughly 3 hit points per &quot;round&quot;.<br/>
However, while playing a stringed instrument (which is the &quot;required&quot;<br/>
skill), you will gain 5 hit points per round.  Also, the effectiveness goes<br/>
up according to the Bard&#39;s abilities with the necessary skill.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this explains it better.<br/>
