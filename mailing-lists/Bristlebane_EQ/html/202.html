<b>Subject:</b> EQ and NT <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470973146">Is anyone running EQ under NT?  If so, could you please tell me how?  My<br/>
friend wants to join us all but can&#39;t get EQ to run under NT.  He is pulling<br/>
out what little is left of his hair.  LOL.  Seriously, we would appreciate<br/>
any help/advise you might be able to supply.  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Kachine will be selling netted armor at the Festival on Sunday and<br/>
will be buying Tentacle whips.  Problem is, she doesn&#39;t know the selling<br/>
prices these items bring.  Anyone know the going price on these items?  She<br/>
has netted pieces for: neck, face, head, arm, shoulders, chest, back and<br/>
legs (only one wristband).  Thanks.</div>
