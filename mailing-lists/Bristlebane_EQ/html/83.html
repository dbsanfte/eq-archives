<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746019462">If the Butcherblock is to far for some of you clerics the Toxxulia Forest <br/>
outside Erudin has plenty of skeletons that are perfect for a lv 6 cleric.  <br/>
Might be tough solo but with one other person you would be fine until lv 7-8. I <br/>
team up with one cleric all the time, he was of the 6th order and I was was of <br/>
the 5th and we had no trouble killing the skeletonss, Kobold Watchers, or Kobold<br/>
<br/>
Shamens.  All give xp for this level.  The Shamens also give the paw which is a <br/>
quest item for clerics, get them and turn them in for items. Just thought I <br/>
would let you know, our land doesn&#92;&#39;t see to many visitors.  Also the bears in <br/>
Qeynos hills are good opponents.  On another note another guildmember, Izum the <br/>
Providor, a cleric, are currently in the Kerra Plains on our way to adventure.  <br/>
If any would like to join us just stop us when we run by.<br/>
