<div id="ygrps-yiv-505915889">Itan!  I say to you, Bah!  Humbug!  What are fellow travelers for, if <br/>
not to help one another out in a pinch?  When I get there, to erudin, <br/>
and hopefully that will be soon, whatever you require you shall have!  <br/>
(After all, the more mentally fortunate should always help those poor <br/>
demented, lesser souls such as yourself.)  And then, it&#39;s off to see the <br/>
world.  Hopefully when I arrive some more worthies will have joined me, <br/>
having themselves been smitten by the same wanderlust that I feel.  I <br/>
feel now, and always have felt, that a good team, working together can <br/>
overcome any obstacle; even the dementia of some of its members, hehe.<br/>
Prepare yourself, I am coming!<br/>
