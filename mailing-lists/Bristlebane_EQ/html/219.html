<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105260716">&lt;&lt;It is tree huggers like you that have made the people of Norrath weak and <br/>
allowed the races of Gnolls and Orcs to overrun the lands that were once <br/>
ours.&gt;&gt;<br/>

reply to this Patty person, and The Hands of the Tranquil in general.::<br/>
<br/>
Ah, my dear barbarian woman.  By &quot;Tree-hugger&quot;, I assume you mean a Druid, as <br/>
that is what we have commonly been called.  However, I must point out that no <br/>
Druid in the history of Norrath, as far as I have seen, follows the path of <br/>
Quellious The Tranquil.  While I must agree with you on that the Hands of the <br/>
Tranquil have said some harsh things on many of the gods and goddesses we all <br/>
love and worship, I think it best we save this for the Gathering.  It will <br/>
surely be a heated topic of debate during the Philosophy segment, and I await <br/>
the oppertunity to debate this with those members of the guild.  Until then, <br/>
keep your cool and go have yourself an ale.  I think the Gathering will be <br/>
successful, as long as everyone remains patient.<br/>
<br/>
And as far as cleansing Norrath of all the orcs and gnolls... well give us a <br/>
chance. It&#39;s not easy.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Stay safe, and good tidings!<br/>
