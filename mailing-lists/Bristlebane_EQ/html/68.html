<b>Subject:</b> Hello all items for sale <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-483870900">Hail to all, I am Xeones, a 12th level Paladin of Mithaniel Marr.  I can be found in and about Freeport and the surrounding countryside.<br/>
<br/>
I have a few items for sale which i have picked up in my travels which may be of interest.  Firstly, i usually have Cutthroat insignia rings on hand.  These are magical items, adding +2 to dex and 1 to ac.  Two can be worn at once, adding +4 to your dexterity.  These are also a monk quest item, by the way. These go for 1 plat a piece.<br/>
<br/>
I also have 1 bronze main gauche, a piercing weapon that can be used even by wizards.  A very fast weapon, does 3 dmg with 23 atk delay. I&#39;m asking 4 plat for this rare item.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, a bronze rapier, with 4 dmg & 28 delay. I&#39;m asking 5 plat for this one.<br/>
<br/>
If you see me on, send me a tell.  If i don&#39;t have a ring currently, i&#39;m sure one of my companions will, and would be happy to sell one to you.<br/>
<br/>
Happy travels all,<br/>
Xeones<br/>
