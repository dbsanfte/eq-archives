<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298503208">Speaking of Trolls and their cloth armor collected from level 1 kills, I<br/>
found a magic netted shirt that was 4AC.  This was equivalent of the AC on<br/>
my guild tunic but when I offered it to a merchant, they were ready to buy<br/>
it from me for 8 gold.  I still don&#39;t know what&#39;s magical about it though.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t improve any skills or stats that I can see.<br/>
