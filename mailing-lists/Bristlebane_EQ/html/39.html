<b>Subject:</b> The Gates I mentioned <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054619113">OOC: Yes I was in Beta.  The gates I speak of are actually high level wizard<br/>
spells.  There is one spell for each of the major areas on the map, enabling<br/>
the powerful wiz to travel instantaneously around the world.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this information is useful to you, what with your font of knowledge<br/>
and everything.<br/>
