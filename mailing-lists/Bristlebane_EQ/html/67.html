    I would certainly favor the chance to escape my bland surroundings and<br/>
venture freely in the world for a time, however I  must warn you that (as I<br/>
said before) I have not yet found my Center, and therefore will not be able<br/>
to use my Monkish gifts as well as another would. &lt;OOC&gt; Like I said, I&#39;m<br/>
only sixth level &lt;OOC&gt; Having heard my final warning, if you still desire my<br/>
company I would gladly travel with you for a time. Since I have now heard<br/>
you speak of yourself a little by now, I have rather high expectations for<br/>
you. Not only do I expect you to be able to define in concise terms the<br/>
meaning of life, but also to be ten feet tall. *chuckles* All foolery aside<br/>
though, I await our meeting with a twang of impatience... Perhaps I am<br/>
overeager to berid of this place?<br/>

&lt;OOC&gt; EMail can be a unwieldy means of communication. My ICQ # is 5722550<br/>
I&#39;ll be on tonight until around 8 cst, as well as most other nights. I look<br/>
forward to meeting you and any others who would care to meet in-game. &lt;OOC&gt;</div>
