<div id="ygrps-yiv-994014209">Hello Again, World!<br/>
    For those of you who remember me, this is Sdaan, the friendly neighborhood Barbarian Fighter!  I&#39;ve been out of touch lately, mainly due to my recent move to Hawaii, and the difficulty of getting Roadrunner here.  But these problems have been overcome, and here I am again....<br/>
    Only I am now Sdaar, the friendly neighborhood Wizard, 10th level.  Anyway, just wanted to say Aloha All!</div>
