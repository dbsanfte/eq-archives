You sound like a necro.  I hope you are not, as I never speak kindly to a bone sucker.<br/>
<br/>
I assume that your reference to &quot;idle threats and poorly-written posturing&quot; was aimed at myself and my poor deluded friend Zardoz.<br/>
<br/>
ooc:  Let me assure you, that if I were to meet him in game, I would engage in much the same banter.  This list is a convenient way of extend the roleplay experience.  If it offends you, then I am sorry, but in the absence of any rules other than no profanity, I will leave it to the administrator to decide whether or not it needs curbing.<br/>
Maybe it is not offense that you wish to confer, but something more akin to mere displeasure.  If that is the case then I will make no apology.  If this list is going to consist solely of technical questions and ooc communication, then I think it will miss the point of being server specific.<br/>
I believe that it should be used as we have begun to use it, but let us see what the consensus of the growing numbers decides.<br/>
<br/>
Poorly written you say?  You must excuse Zardoz.  Apart from looking exactly like Sean Connery, his mind is not up to eloquent communication of the level which you seek.  Indeed, I have had to write to him in a simplistic manner, just so that he can get the general idea.<br/>
<br/>
As for idle threats,  I don&#39;t think we have threatened each other as yet, so you must mean someone else.<br/>
<br/>
ooc: Please try and join in character.  It will help build a strong community on the server, and I hope we&#39;ll show those Fennin Ro bods how to<br/>
roleplay in EQ.<br/>
