<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958248975">I expect there will be someone somewhere who will train in these skills,<br/>
although you may need to raise your standing within their guild before they<br/>
will consider it.  I would expect a thieves guild would train in Sneak, but<br/>
they will not train any non thief until you have gained their favour (don&#39;t<br/>
ask me how).<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I could be wrong, and it may be that you just have to keep<br/>
practising over and over.  Sense Heading has taken me a while to build<br/>
without training.  You only gain in the skill with success, and early<br/>
success is rare, but as your skill increases, so do the successes and the<br/>
builds.<br/>
