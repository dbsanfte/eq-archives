<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189003734">I am not sure but at level 21 I think I am one of the higher levels<br/>
on this list but I was hoping someone could help me.  I am looking to<br/>
find/buy/trade for a travelers pack or any pack that will reduce the weight<br/>
of carried goods.  I find I am carrying about 20 lbs of usful stuff wich is<br/>
all great but really hurts my ability to bring back good loot.<br/>
<br/>
	Wanted:<br/>
	Travelers pack or equivelent<br/>
	Magic Boots<br/>
	Bloodstained armor<br/>
	Ebony blade (yea right! hehe)<br/>
	Player made packs (will pay 15 plat for each .. I want 10)<br/>
<br/>
	I am also looking for good magic ranger armor and some player made<br/>
back packs.  <br/>
<br/>
	For trade I have <br/>
	2 screaming maces, 8 damage 35 delay casts yalp (Magic)<br/>
	2 Shiny Brass shields 10 AC +10 Magic Resistance<br/>
	1 Brass Idol 1 charge of divine aura (temperary invulnerability)<br/>
	Many words for spell research<br/>
	1 small mountain of banded armor (I am a Master smith)<br/>
	An Oak Bow (I will be a Master fletcher soon) BTW these babies cost<br/>
over 80 plat for each atempt ACK!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	I will also be willing to sell thes for a reasonable offer but I<br/>
really want to trade for other magic items.<br/>
