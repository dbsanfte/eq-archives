It would require some work on your part, but make a list. If someone wants<br/>
to speak, they give you a /tell with a specific phrase in it (&quot;Please add me<br/>
to the speaker list&quot; or similar). You add them to the bottom of the list.<br/>
When their turn comes, they can make their point then sit back down. Limit<br/>
the speaker to one or two /says, and if they want to rebute, they resubmit<br/>
their names into the list.<br/>
