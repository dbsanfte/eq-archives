<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768825648"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I personally find it interesting. Free enterprise at work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just like selling bone chips to necros, and so on...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am a cleric and I gladly heal for free. And undying loyalty<br/>
&gt;is greatly appreciated as well :) It&#39;s part of the reason I<br/>
&gt;chose to be a cleric. You always have a friend.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hear, hear. My most enjoyable RP moments come when, in the course of <br/>
my travels, I encounter a party of PCs resting after a terrible <br/>
battle. I stop to heal and bless each of them, discussing their <br/>
recent fortunes (or misfortunes) as I do so and as I meditate <br/>
afterwards. Invariably, I leave with new names in my friends list, <br/>
and having been blessed myself by their gratitude and vows of future <br/>
aid in my time of need. That type of experience is the distillation <br/>
of why this is the only class for me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;However, I&#39;ve encountered players who seem to think<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s all I do, or that I somehow *owe* them. I&#39;ll be kneedeep<br/>
&gt;in gnolls in black burrow, mana half gone, in a party, and get a<br/>
&gt;tell &quot;Can you heal me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, I&#39;ve never had someone &quot;demand&quot; healing from me. I&#39;m not even <br/>
sure how I&#39;d react to it. Most people are actually surprised that <br/>
another player would take time to stop and assist them without any <br/>
apparent motivation for personal gain- only a very few seem to <br/>
believe themselves entitled to that aid. And I can easily disenchant <br/>
them of that notion...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;When I finally meet up with the individual all they need is to be<br/>
&gt;&quot;topped off&quot; hp-wise. &lt;grrr&gt; It&#39;s repeat cases with individuals<br/>
&gt;like these that I&#39;ll ask for donations :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or claim to be out of mana, or type /ignore, or...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As long as they aren&#39;t screwing other people in the process,<br/>
&gt;I feel that if people have a service other people want, I think<br/>
&gt;its their perogative to charge for it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or not to charge, as the case may be. I&#39;m 10th level as well, still <br/>
trying to decide what I&#39;m going to do with my ability to bind at <br/>
level 14. I can easily see myself declaring open season for 15 <br/>
minutes, binding all comers, asking only that they repay me by <br/>
assisting others characters they encounter who may be in need. I can <br/>
also easily see myself charging everyone 5g to bind and buying a big <br/>
fat chainmail helmet with the proceeds...=-)<br/>
