<b>Subject:</b> Mesh shirt, 8 gold! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921973818">I believe that the draw of the mesh shirt is the weight.. or rather, lack of weight for the high AC.  I have never seen one, but I think I read somewhere that they were very light so were better protection for the weight<br/>
