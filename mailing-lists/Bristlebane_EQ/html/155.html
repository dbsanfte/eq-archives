<div id="ygrps-yiv-369582137">I&#39;m already to the point where i can bind and I generally do it by<br/>
donations when I do it.  I had one person i bound say &quot;I don&#39;t have<br/>
anything but i&#39;ll pay you later you don&#39;t know how much this means...&quot;<br/>
then ran off... bout a week later he walks up and hands me a greater<br/>
lightstone (4pp)... i&#39;ve been given upto 2pp in actually money and as low<br/>
as 20cp.  Seems to work pretty well though.  The only bad thing about bind<br/>
is this: 100mana cost. Ouch. =)<br/>

&gt; Or not to charge, as the case may be. I&#39;m 10th level as well, still <br/>
&gt; trying to decide what I&#39;m going to do with my ability to bind at <br/>
&gt; level 14. I can easily see myself declaring open season for 15 <br/>
&gt; minutes, binding all comers, asking only that they repay me by <br/>
&gt; assisting others characters they encounter who may be in need. I can <br/>
&gt; also easily see myself charging everyone 5g to bind and buying a big <br/>
&gt; fat chainmail helmet with the proceeds...=-) </span></blockquote></div>
