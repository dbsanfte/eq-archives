<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701108584"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;One last thing - why do people in the Oasis insist on training sand<br/>
&gt;giants into other people before they die? Can&#39;t they have the good<br/>
&gt;grace to just die AWAY from the medditating mages? Just something that<br/>
&gt;bugs me : )<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The worm turned on the past weekend.  Fed up of cowering from the ever<br/>
swarming Sand Giants, most of Oasis (about 25ppl) formed an agry mob by the<br/>
pier.  A quick bit of organisation saw casters and healers grouped, and the<br/>
nearest Giant was swiftly pulled to his death.  Not bad for a bunch of<br/>
lv15 - 20s, with a lv30 or so tank.  Made for some truly excellent<br/>
screenshots, the poor thing didnt know who he was meant to be hitting as he<br/>
swung from casters to healers to bashers and back.<br/>
<br/>
The following day, they had their revenge though.  Some fool trained an SG<br/>
onto Pillar1.  Total carnage, i and many others died staring at their spell<br/>
books.  I believe he then went on to whack a few of the gawping crowd on the<br/>
beach too, which serves em right for staring at the accident.  :)<br/>
<br/>
When i got back, there were a LOT of naked people running around.  :)<br/>
