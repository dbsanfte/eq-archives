<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244480111">I visited Highhold at level six on my first journey out of Western Antonica, and<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering the same thing, I got lucky and the huge orc that was killing me <br/>
started fighting the 10 townspeople or so.  There are so many bodies in the Hold<br/>
 <br/>
that it is hard not to trip.  I know that many are trying to get through and <br/>
hope they banked their belongings before the trip.<br/>
<br/>
I just gave directions to a lv10 human to make the trip.  He said that it was <br/>
still full of bodies but he had heeded my warnings and made it safely through, <br/>
also did the trip naked, which was wise.  If people desire to goto Rivervale <br/>
from Qeynos I recommend Highhold, is a little easier.  I personally take <br/>
Beholder, tis a scarier but shorter sprint.  I am a lv 8 wiz and did Beholder, <br/>
of course I was half up a mountain face and avoinding even the cockroaches, but <br/>
I made it through.  Highhold is interesting, but with orcs raiding into town it <br/>
is definatly not safe for any lv 8 characters.  Not that the minotuars of <br/>
Beholder are any better for us.<br/>
