<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507569118">Greetings Again, All:<br/>
    Let&#39;s see what we&#39;ve learned so far...All Elves hate Dark Elves, Dwarves<br/>
hate Ogres and Trolls, Barbarians hate Erudites, and Erudites hate everyone.<br/>
&lt;Yawn&gt;  Very interesting.  For about 5 minutes, 50 some-odd messages ago.<br/>
    This is not what I wanted to be reading when I signed up for this<br/>
emailing list.  I had hoped for some rousing tales from the bards, some bug<br/>
info, event notices, maybe even some auctions.  Not child-like, immature,<br/>
boring pissing contests.  I have been on the list for only a day, and it<br/>
will be my last, if I continue to receive this mindless banter.   If you<br/>
feel you must continue with your &quot;My character hates your character<br/>
because...&quot; spam, please do the rest of us the favor of exchange email<br/>
addresses with the relevant party, or ICQ numbers, so that you may bore each<br/>
other in private, not us.   Otherwise, please log into the game and take it<br/>
to the chat room, so that the rest of us may #ignore &lt;you&gt;.<br/>
    I do not, by any stretch of the imagination, presume to speak for the<br/>
moderator of this site, nor do I wish to come across as overbearing.  Let us<br/>
have a democratic vote on keeping these postings aligned with relevant<br/>
topics, please.  If not a vote, then at least we can try to use our own<br/>
self-discipline and refrain from such topics as &quot;All &lt;insert relevant race<br/>
here&gt; SUCK!!&quot;.  Thank you.</div>
