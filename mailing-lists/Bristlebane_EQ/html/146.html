faction standings really are an iffy thing, cuz one may have or not <br/>
have, as the case may be a decent standing and may get wacked and our <br/>
brother monk said, without warning. <br/>
<br/>
 Also, I tried out a Troll in the beta and had a lot of fun with her <br/>
but now if I play a troll, there is no way I can go into qeynos or <br/>
any of the other civilized cities.  So it kinda limits your play.  <br/>
But picture this, a Troll warrior grouped up with some high elven <br/>
wizards, in a dungeon!!!!!  talk about kicking some monster tail!! <br/>
hehe  but how can it happen???  no way I know of.. *sigh*  <br/>
<br/>
  Also someone needs to let EQ know they gotta work on their player <br/>
to player communication; it&#39;s, in my opinion, incredibly combersome.  <br/>
Does not lend itself to striking up casual conversations.<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I really like this game and I still think its <br/>
yards ahead of UO but......<br/>

Other than seeing those occasional &quot;your faction has increased with <br/>
So-and-so&quot;<br/>
messages, does anyone else find it scary that you have NO idea what <br/>
any<br/>
particular group might think of you and what that means for your <br/>
general<br/>
safety?<br/>
<br/>
Members of the crew I regularly adventure with made a few enemies <br/>
among the<br/>
Freeport militia.  Now many of the Freeport guards will attack them.  <br/>
Ok, that<br/>
one was fairly predictable.  However, when we adventured to Kaladim, <br/>
one of<br/>
these people was killed by a dwarven guard (StormGuard).  I&#39;m not <br/>
sure that we<br/>
figured out exactly why.  The guard shouted something about his god, <br/>
but he<br/>
shares a god with others in our group.  Was it related to the <br/>
Freeport thing? <br/>
We may never know.<br/>
<br/>
I wish they would tell you when you select your god what the <br/>
repercussions<br/>
might be.  Picking one of the ultra-evil ones has obvious drawbacks, <br/>
but we<br/>
have no way of knowing what selecting any of the others will do to <br/>
you.  And<br/>
once in the game what are you supposed to do?  Two PCs conning an NPC <br/>
often<br/>
results in similar messages (&quot;regards you dubiously&quot; or something <br/>
like that)<br/>
yet only one PC will be attacked.  Kind of an expensive guessing game.<br/>
<br/>
Just my ponder for the day.  Talk amongst yourselves.<br/>

Phoeble, Monk of Freeport, Almost Last-Named <br/>
