<br/>
When will you realise that you Elves are not the most enlightened race?<br/>
<br/>
Your intellect, although undoubtably superior to most, will not compare to<br/>
weakest of Erudite brains.<br/>
<br/>
Please my friend, prepare yourself for a humbling experience when you enter<br/>
our land.  There is a guard at the port who has forgotten more knowledge<br/>
that you&#39;ll ever know.  It will just get worse for you from there my friend.<br/>
<br/>
You will find me in and around the city of Erudin.  Alas, I fell foul of the<br/>
local heavy yesterday night, and I have lost a sizeable some of monies.  My<br/>
quest for adventure will have to go on hold for a while. (OOC: Not only<br/>
that, it&#39;s taking forever to level, so I&#39;m too weak to travel as yet)<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to seeing you in person my friend.  I will be glad to offer<br/>
my shoulder for you to cry on when the truth hits.<br/>
<br/>
