I am a Ranger in Qeynos and basically have found that Black\r<br/>\n&gt; Burrow or the Karana plains are about it for levels 6-9 that I can find.\r<br/>\n&gt; Where else in the Qeynos area (or other areas) have great exp potential?\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; Are there other &#92;&quot;dungeons&#92;&quot; in the areas (I know of the aquaducks, but they\r<br/>\n&gt; are a bit slow)? \r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; Karim / Alladine\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Go to The toxxullia forest my fine Ranger.  The Tox has much less people in the \r<br/>\nzone than anyplace around Qeynos.  Also it is mostly spell casters so your \r<br/>\nfighting skills are needed.  Another good point is the fact that you can track, \r<br/>\nand the Toxullia forest is a dark foggy place that is hard to see in.  There are<br/>\n\r<br/>\npleanty of poachers and undead to slay can gain from (xp for lv 6-8).  Not to \r<br/>\nsure of above that in the Tox, but you can go to Kerra Isle with a good group \r<br/>\nand survive if you make sure to con everything first.  These are good places for<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRangers, I have partied with a few in Qeynos and crossed the boat to Erudin and \r<br/>\nhad a non-stop hunting spree (except for my resting to get mana that is) for \r<br/>\nsome great gains in my powers.  So it is one option that you can consider my \r<br/>\nfine Ranger.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nZakrul The Traveler\r<br/>\nCompanion\r<br/>\nWizard\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThis mail sent through IMP: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.horde.org/imp/\">http://web.horde.org/imp/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
