Greetings.  I <br/>\njust landed in Freeport last night, getting off the ship by the port <br/>\nauthority: I was so glad to get off that boat; do you have any idea what <br/>\nseasick dwarves smell like? Ugh!  I&#39;m on a quest to see the world and <br/>\nfind Itan so I can insult him to his dim-witted, empty-headed face, <br/>\nhehe.  Care to join me in my travels???  My plan was to restock <br/>\nmalachite in Freeport and set off for Rivervale.  I believe that retard, <br/>\nItan, is somewhere to the west, perhaps as far as the land of Erud: oh <br/>\nbrother, another boat crossing!<br/>\nSo, Madoc, if you are up for it, or for that fact any other adventurous <br/>\nsoul, except necros, in or about Freeport, let me know and we&#39;ll get <br/>\ntogether and set out tonight.<br/>\nItan: prepare yourself for my august presence!  When we first meet I <br/>\nrealize my scintillating intellect will probably, since you are a lower <br/>\nform of life, overwhelm you with awe! &lt;OOC: Itan, where you hiding out? <br/>\nSince I&#39;m headed that way it would be nice to know where you are, hehe&gt;<br/>\n&lt;ooc: personally, I think it would be really cool if we could get a band <br/>\nof crazies together and roam all over Norrath; terrorizing necros and <br/>\nhelping folks out along the way.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
