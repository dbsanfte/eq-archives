After<br/>\nplaying another character on another server, I decided I liked Froogal and<br/>\nBristlebane better than my other Character and Server. I do try to RP a bit,<br/>\nbut lacking in imagination and practice; my RP skills are weak. I am willing<br/>\nto group with just about anyone, provided they are friendly and willing to<br/>\nhelp others when they can. If you see Froogal, be sure and say hello and<br/>\noffer him some good deals. He is always in search of a bargain.<br/>\nFroogal,<br/>\n10th level Paladin,<br/>\nFreeport</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
