(Hence the OOC title... &lt;grin&gt;) The new list is not meant as an offense, merely as a solution to what is obviously becoming a problem on this list. I&#39;ve seen a new list on the EQVault page dedicated to roleplaying on another server, so I suppose that there is a demand for RP in mailing lists. But since some of us want purely OOC discussion, I thought the obvious solution would be to create a second list.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecca<br/>\na.k.a.
