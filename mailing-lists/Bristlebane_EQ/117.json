I don&#39;t know what<br/>\n&quot;skill level&quot; this translates to, but for illustration lets say it is 75.<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on your class, you may or may not get the *class ability* to sneak<br/>\nand hide.  If your class does get it, it will be at a certain level (your<br/>\nguild trainers will show you what level) and you cannot put more practices<br/>\ninto it until that level.  Furthermore, using the skill will not increase the<br/>\nskill until such a time as your class gets the skill.  Argh, hope I&#39;m being<br/>\nclear.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore on this... lets say you have the racial skill at 75, and your class gets<br/>\nthe ability to learn the skill at level 10.  At level 10 the skill would be<br/>\ncapped at (level*5)+5 or 55.  So even though at 10th level your guild will now<br/>\ntrain you in it, they wont because you are already maxed out in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know any of the specific numbers, nor how often this wierd stuff<br/>\nhappens (although there are a number of races that get sneak or hide), but<br/>\nthis is how it has been explained to me.  Use the skill if it helps you, but<br/>\ndon&#39;t expect it to improve at all until such a time as your guild would train<br/>\nyou in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhoeble, Traveling Monk of Freeport.0</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
