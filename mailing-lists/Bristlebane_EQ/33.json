I thought that I should take a moment to introduce <br/>\nmyself to ye all.  I am Lexcanium, a Human Paladin who has currently attained <br/>\nthe tenth numerical rank within his training.  I can be found, generally, all <br/>\nthroughout Norrath, as I wander the land often, making my way from one place <br/>\nto the next.  Most often, as of late, I can be found on the beautiful <br/>\ncontinent of Faydwer slaying the evil Orcs of the Clan Crushbone, which, by <br/>\nthe way, seem to hold a vendetta against me...  At least that is the <br/>\nimpression I infer when they scream things such as, &quot;Your actions and history <br/>\nare a personal affront to all I stand for!&quot; when trying in vain to beat me to <br/>\na bloody pulp.<br/>\n\tIf our paths shall ever cross, feel free to stop and talk for a <br/>\nwhile, I am usually always free for some friendly chatter.  Fare thee well, <br/>\nand may we purge the wonderful lands of Norrath from all evil in given time!<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe travels,<br/>\n\tLexcanium MacCrege<br/>\n\tHoly Knight of Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
