Your skill cap is 5 + 5 x current","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1282649185\">Hail Bristlebane players!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to add something to the Bristlebane community, so here&#39;s what I&#39;ve<br/>\nlearnt about skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour skill cap is 5 + 5 x current level. So, a level 1 character has a skill<br/>\ncap of 10 in each of his skills, and a level 10 character has a skill cap of<br/>\n55. You raise your skills by using them (once you have attained the basics),<br/>\nso yes, they wil go up if you practice/use them until you reach your level<br/>\ncap.<br/>\n<br/>\nSneak is a tricky skill. Every time you use it you will turn invisible in<br/>\nyour external view and you will walk real slow but this does not mean that<br/>\nit is working. I have heard that the only way to tell if sneak has worked is<br/>\nto ask another NPC if you dissapeared from their view. I think the same is<br/>\ntrue for the hide skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nArmistar, Ranger of Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: TRAVISL &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TRAVIS@...\">TRAVIS@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bristlebane_eq@onelist.com\">bristlebane_eq@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bristlebane_eq@onelist.com\">bristlebane_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: 12 April 1999 21:51<br/>\nSubject: [Bristlebane_EQ] (no subject)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo these skills ever go &quot;up&quot; at all?<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, they are not listed in the skill list to &quot;put points into&quot; and I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever seen the skill increase through usage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have built a Halfling Druid, who has these abilities. Am I to expect that<br/>\nthese abilities will work just as well now as they will when I attain level<br/>\n20?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, has anyone noticed that sometimes the &quot;Sneak&quot; skill just doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork? You hit Sneak and you continue to walk/run at normal speed? Then it<br/>\nbecomes available to use it again and you try again etc. Sooner or later it<br/>\n&quot;works.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo top it off, how do you know if it&#39;s &quot;really&quot; working?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had aggressive monsters run right past me while I was sneaking, only to<br/>\nhave them see me on other occasions. Same monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are very interesting skills, but I need to know how they really work!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nTravis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:travis@...\">travis@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:travis@...\">travis@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
