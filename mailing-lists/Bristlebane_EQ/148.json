I find this amazingly lame.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I personally find it interesting. Free enterprise at work. It is lame if it<br/>\ngets to the point that they are stealing kills from monks and then trying<br/>\nto sell them back to the monks. That&#39;s taking advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It ranks up<br/>\n&gt;there with clerics charging for heals and other such things.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why does this bother you? You are asking a favor of somebody. You don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to pay. Clerics aren&#39;t there for your convience. How about charging<br/>\nfor binding?  Or having somebody help find your corpse? Is this lame as<br/>\nwell? I can understand that it would be lame if the cleric is in your own<br/>\nparty and charges you. I would dump that party member awful quick. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It&#39;s like a tank charging to party with you or some other such nonsense.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, its like paying a tank to take something out for you if you can&#39;t and<br/>\nthey aren&#39;t in your party. I believe the difference lies in whether you are<br/>\npartied or not. One is working for the profit of the whole, the other is a<br/>\nfavor. I once died in a very sticky situation and there was no way I&#39;ld<br/>\nevery be able to retrieve my stuff. I had a tank go in and get it for me,<br/>\nand glady payed the individual (even though they didn&#39;t ask), knowing that<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t something they particularly wanted to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Those clerics who do keep it free have my undying loyalty.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am a cleric and I gladly heal for free. And undying loyalty is greatly<br/>\nappreciated as well :) It&#39;s part of the reason I chose to be a cleric. You<br/>\nalways have a friend. However, I&#39;ve encountered players who seem to think<br/>\nthat&#39;s all I do, or that I somehow *owe* them. I&#39;ll be kneedeep in gnolls<br/>\nin black burrow, mana half gone, in a party, and get a tell &quot;Can you heal<br/>\nme?&quot; When I finally meet up with the individual all they need is to be<br/>\n&quot;topped off&quot; hp-wise. &lt;grrr&gt; It&#39;s repeat cases with individuals like these<br/>\nthat I&#39;ll ask for donations :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs long as they aren&#39;t screwing other people in the process, I feel that if<br/>\npeople have a service other people want, I think its their perogative to<br/>\ncharge for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Rebecca<br/>\nSeby, 10th level cleric who will happily heal in exchange for gratitude</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
