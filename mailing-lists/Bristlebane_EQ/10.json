I play a level 4 mage (seemingly the only class on this <br/>\nmailing list) and I have a few questions about spells and such. Sorry for the <br/>\nlist, but it&#39;s the easiest way to get it across. <br/>\n1. Since you can only use Bind Affinity at level 12, are you basically stuck <br/>\nin your home town until then? I find this hard to believe, since warriors <br/>\nmight not be able to cast it, but some people have said this to be true.<br/>\n2. I started training in piercing, and lately I&#39;ve seen most fellow Erudites <br/>\ncarrying staffs or clubs. Was this a mistake? Does it even matter latter on, <br/>\nas you&#39;ll be fighting in a group and not using melee weapons?<br/>\n3. Hey, where&#39;s the music?!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all. Any help will be greatly appreciated. <br/>\n<br/>\nIzin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
