I had one person i bound say &quot;I don&#39;t have<br/>\nanything but i&#39;ll pay you later you don&#39;t know how much this means...&quot;<br/>\nthen ran off... bout a week later he walks up and hands me a greater<br/>\nlightstone (4pp)... i&#39;ve been given upto 2pp in actually money and as low<br/>\nas 20cp.  Seems to work pretty well though.  The only bad thing about bind<br/>\nis this: 100mana cost. Ouch. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nShads<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; [SNiP]<br/>\n&gt; Or not to charge, as the case may be. I&#39;m 10th level as well, still <br/>\n&gt; trying to decide what I&#39;m going to do with my ability to bind at <br/>\n&gt; level 14. I can easily see myself declaring open season for 15 <br/>\n&gt; minutes, binding all comers, asking only that they repay me by <br/>\n&gt; assisting others characters they encounter who may be in need. I can <br/>\n&gt; also easily see myself charging everyone 5g to bind and buying a big <br/>\n&gt; fat chainmail helmet with the proceeds...=-) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
