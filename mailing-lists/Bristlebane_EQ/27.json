Your problem Zardoz my friend, is that although you claim to be &quot;Most Supreme User of Magics&quot;, and &quot;Proud possessor of the greatest intellect in all of Norrath!&quot;, you have yet to master the gates which exist within our grand world.  Until you do, please do not insult the rest of us with your &quot;poorly-written posturing&quot; (ooc: I love that).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe younger races are the result of the gods error correcting.  You were a prototype reject elf, whereas we are the cream of an already superior race.  You are just going to have to get used to the fact that Elves have had their day.  If you want to feel superior so badly, go find a troll to talk to.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nItan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
