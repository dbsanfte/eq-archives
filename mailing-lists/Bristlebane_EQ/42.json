So then, all of the negative aspects of my<br/>\n&quot;Barbaric&quot; heritage are overcome by my mighty Earthling controller, me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat leaves me with the superior physical conditioning of my race, the hardy<br/>\nBarbarians.  Also, with the power of the Shaman, a lost art that you newer<br/>\nraces may not even learn.  Long ago, we determined to hide these secrets<br/>\nfrom the younger races.<br/>\n<br/>\nI pity you, with your frail body.  You spend all your energies on matters of<br/>\nthe mind, yet never fully coming to know the powers of nature around you.<br/>\nYou may blast an opponent with mighty force, but what are you to do once<br/>\nyour manna is spent?  Will you die, or run?  And if you run, will you have<br/>\nthe Spirit of the Wolf to speed you?  No, you won&#39;t.  I dare say that no<br/>\ncreature on all of Norrath can keep up with me.  I can both grind an enemy<br/>\nto a halt, and run at speeds the fastest leopard envies.  If I run at all,<br/>\nfor my mighty staff can damage an opponent nearly as well as my magics can.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbarian Shaman</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
