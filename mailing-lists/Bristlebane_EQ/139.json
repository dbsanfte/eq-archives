Maybe he means killing faeries... but<br/>\npixie tricksters need to be exterminated because they are setting fires to<br/>\nthe forest, and if they continue, our beloved Faydark will soon be gone (or<br/>\nso my Ranger guildmaster told me). I can&#39;t believe the Rangers would have us<br/>\nkilling a &#39;nice&#39; creature.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I&#39;m willing to bet it is faeries... because one time my earth<br/>\nelemental attacked a faerie (the faeries appear aggressive, even though they<br/>\ndon&#39;t attack me at my level, and the pet picks up on this aggressiveness)<br/>\nand though I told him to back off, the faerie killed my pet and proceeded to<br/>\nchase after me (I took off running when I saw my elemental was dying). I ran<br/>\nto the guards, and they did nothing at all... and it wasn&#39;t one of those<br/>\n&#39;the guard didn&#39;t see&#39; kind of things, because I had a very good start on<br/>\nthe faerie, and there were several minutes of me running back and forth in<br/>\nfront of the guards while they snickered at me and rolled their eyes!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, one of the things I hope to never hear again is, &#39;Jobaner says, &#39;Time<br/>\nto die a faerie guard.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nScylla</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
