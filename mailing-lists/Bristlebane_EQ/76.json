I&#39;m wandering around the outsides of Freeport, and I see an asp. I<br/>\n&gt;say, there&#39;s low-level stuff around here, it can&#39;t be that hard. Well,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>killed<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;me in three hits, needless to say. So, I get sent back to Felwithe.

I log back on, only to find myself wading in<br/>\n&gt;the Ocean of Tears, miles away from my destination, with my corpse slowing<br/>\n&gt;decaying. So, I says to myself, what now? Well, I decided to swim for it. I<br/>\n&gt;make it from 210, 300 to about 210, -8000 (An hour swim, adding in the fact<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;swam in circles for a good half hour) and I see a boat heading for me<br/>\n&gt;straight on.

Or, if<br/>\nyou are very lucky, like me, you&#39;ll log in in a nonexistent spot, and fall<br/>\noff the map, ending up under the earth in Butcherblock, unable to get to<br/>\nyour corpes. A GM got it back for me (about 9 hours later), but it shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave happened in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked the GM if they were going to fix the thing were you log back in from<br/>\nthe water, and he was like, &#39;No, I think that&#39;s the way it should be - it is<br/>\na dangerous trip!&#39; Well, I totally disagree. To me, if losing link is like<br/>\n&#39;passing out&#39; in the virtual world. If you pass out while fighting a<br/>\nmonster, you&#39;ll die. If you pass out while standing in a field, you&#39;ll be<br/>\nstanding in a field. If you pass out on a boat - you should still be on the<br/>\nboat when you wake up!! The idea that you&#39;d end up in the water is<br/>\nridiculous.<br/>\n<br/>\nScylla</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
