There are so many bodies in the Hold<br/>\n \r<br/>\nthat it is hard not to trip.  I know that many are trying to get through and \r<br/>\nhope they banked their belongings before the trip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI just gave directions to a lv10 human to make the trip.  He said that it was \r<br/>\nstill full of bodies but he had heeded my warnings and made it safely through, \r<br/>\nalso did the trip naked, which was wise.  If people desire to goto Rivervale \r<br/>\nfrom Qeynos I recommend Highhold, is a little easier.  I personally take \r<br/>\nBeholder, tis a scarier but shorter sprint.  I am a lv 8 wiz and did Beholder, \r<br/>\nof course I was half up a mountain face and avoinding even the cockroaches, but \r<br/>\nI made it through.  Highhold is interesting, but with orcs raiding into town it \r<br/>\nis definatly not safe for any lv 8 characters.  Not that the minotuars of \r<br/>\nBeholder are any better for us.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nZakrul The Traveler\r<br/>\nCompanion\r<br/>\nWizard\r<br/>\nWhereabouts unknown\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Please tell... What do you mean by this?  It seems you are saying that\r<br/>\n&gt; Enchanters frequent HighPass?  Beginning at level 8?  Why in the world\r<br/>\n&gt; would\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThis mail sent through IMP: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.horde.org/imp/\">http://web.horde.org/imp/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
