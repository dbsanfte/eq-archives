Sounds like a good way to start a<br/>\n&gt;&quot;lively&quot; discussion with some Freeport Paladins anyway.  Barbarian Shaman<br/>\n&gt;may also be miffed to note that apparently the Guards of Norrath follow The<br/>\n&gt;Tribunal. (If only - those darkies in Neriak KOS me real bad, despite that<br/>\n&gt;fact I worship The Six Hammers)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyways I am sure Talorc will do his level best to show up and do some<br/>\n&gt;&quot;discussing&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Talorc<br/>\n&gt;Shaman of Halas, follower of The Tribunal<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
