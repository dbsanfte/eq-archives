I know there is a formula to gaining skills per level, but is it harder to start and advance in a skill when you start later in levels or does it matter when you start a skill at all?  For instance I have a character who just picked up skills (kicking, hand to hand, and swimming) and I can&#39;t seem to hit the same levels I do with my other skills (offense, defense, 1h slashing).  And do I ever practice!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
