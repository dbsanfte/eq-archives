(it is located in east commons, with an entrance to it also from north <br/>\nro) i think that this would be a great place for players to bring thier rare <br/>\nor hand made items and try and sell or trade them.  looking to sell that <br/>\nrare polished tomahawk, or that hand made high quality bow? looking to find <br/>\na smith selling banded armor, or trying to find that peice of bronze plate <br/>\nthat you are missing? just found some rubicite armor and want to fetch a top <br/>\nprice for it? i think that this game is already awesome, but we can make it <br/>\nbetter with weekly events like this, or other events. i suggest it be held <br/>\nevery saturday at 3PM EST. this should be a time when most players can get <br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nother possibilities for this weelky trade festival can be a place for guilds <br/>\nto try and recruit other players. players can get together and discuss <br/>\nquests or what certain lore items are for (for example i have a pirates <br/>\nearing, a lore item, and have no idea what is it for). maybe rich guilds <br/>\nand/or rich players can even hold some contests with prizes.<br/>\n<br/>\nif this sounds like a good idea, please reply to the list with your comments <br/>\nand/or let players know about it in the game. verant has given us a grand <br/>\nstart, but it is up to us to make it even better!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
