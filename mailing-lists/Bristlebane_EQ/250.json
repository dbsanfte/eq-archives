My guildmaster is hard but fair.  He keeps my<br/>\ndevelopment slow to<br/>\nensure that my desire for power will only come with a true respect for that<br/>\nwhich may be<br/>\nwrought from it.  For that I am thankful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am of the 5th circle (lv 16)  within my Guild.  I can be found many aday<br/>\nstudying and experimenting<br/>\nwithin the hall of the Academy in Freeport.  But I also take childlike pleasure<br/>\nin exploring, and<br/>\nhave recently begun to find mastery over elementals throughout Norrath that have<br/>\novercome<br/>\ntheir masters to break those tentative bonds that we magicians hold sway upon<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel it is also time for me to take on an apprentice.  My guildmaster says<br/>\nthat it will help me learn<br/>\ncompassion and help to gain further understanding in areas of knowledge that I<br/>\nmayhap only<br/>\nperused upon in the past (my unyielding desire to come of age, no doubt!).  My<br/>\napprentice must<br/>\nhave a good and open heart and a desire to open all doors allowed us as<br/>\nmagicians.  He can<br/>\nbe of any race, for my spirit is touched not by the despicable hand of prejudice<br/>\n( I see that humans<br/>\nmay well be the ONLY race not mired by that foul characteristics).  I ask only<br/>\nthat he or she also<br/>\nhold their tongue in regards to any prejudiced remarks or situations.  I shall<br/>\nnot tolerate babblings<br/>\nof prejudice, our time upon Norrath is too short to be mired by such idiocy!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would prefer, for now, that the apprentice either be based out of Freeport, or<br/>\nwilling to move here.<br/>\nI have but meager lodgings to offer my apprentice, and will not be a crutch for<br/>\nhim/her.  I believe too<br/>\nstrongly that experience in Norrath is our greatest teacher.  As I have been<br/>\nguided by experience, so<br/>\nshall my apprentice.  I will rather, give guidance in all things of the Art that<br/>\nI know.  I will occasionally<br/>\nintroduce new game to my apprentice in a controlled environment, as well as<br/>\noffering rewards for<br/>\ntasks completed (my disgression of course).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are aspiring magicians in this land that would like to spend a time<br/>\nlearning, please call<br/>\nout to me here.<br/>\n<br/>\nDhimmid deThon, Defender of the Art.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
