I am looking for<br/>\na few adventuring souls of level 11-12 (13 is ok, but preferably not a<br/>\nlot of folks cause I like equal ep distribution) distinction to hunt in<br/>\nbefallen level 2 with me. An additional cleric would be cool as 1 could<br/>\nheal while 1 wards and certain need a tank or two. Mages and bards are<br/>\nnice as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefallen doesn&#39;t have to be where we hunt but its a good dungeon and<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem too overcrowded even at peak times. If you have other<br/>\nsuggested places I&#39;m certainly open to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can either reply to the list or send me an email. I typically play<br/>\nin the evenings betweek 8pm and 12am eastern time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know if you wanna have some fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nVrachit, virgo with venus rising &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nps, is this the beginning of EQ personal ads? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
