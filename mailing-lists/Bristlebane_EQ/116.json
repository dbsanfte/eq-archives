I&#39;m in no<br/>\n&gt; great hurry, and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; certainly not a power player, but I get the feeling<br/>\n&gt; that some class/race<br/>\n&gt; combos have a much easier time of it than others,<br/>\n&gt; perhaps too much for<br/>\n&gt; balance.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in about the same boat as you.  I don&#39;t get to play as often as I&#39;d<br/>\nlike and I enjoy experimenting with different race/class combos just to<br/>\nsee if I&#39;m missing something.  My two favorite characters (and most<br/>\noften played) are a Dark Elf Warrior and Half-Elf Bard.  I give them<br/>\nabout equal time and my warrior is 5th level and my bard 3rd.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nsurfed a good bit to find stats about a variety of topics, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink I&#39;ve found a good source to compare experience levels (or if I<br/>\nhave, I&#39;ve forgotten).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know the hybrid classes have to earn more<br/>\n&gt; experience, but does anyone know<br/>\n&gt; any details?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Steve<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I find some good stats, I&#39;ll post them and if anyone has some stats<br/>\nor a link, I would be interested to know as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nCatch you on-line,<br/>\n<br/>\nDrew<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
