I am a warrior of noble heart from the depths of Kaladim.  With the powers vested in me by the father of dwarvenkind, Brell Serilis, i hunt down and kill the evils of the land, assist the helpless, explore the unknown, and get drunk.  I love to chat about the times and ponder the workings of the universe anytime, and you may be asking me to keep quiet as i gab between swings of my mighty halberd while we hack at those foul smelling minotaurs.  I am just, i am honest, and i&#39;ve been told i brag heavily while stumbling about in a stupor.  My loyalty is golden and share what i have.  I despise greed and arrogance.  I believe respect is the key to peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am seeking a fellowship of friends to join in adventure throughout Norrath, i guarantee my company will be pleasant.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKahnan of Kaladim</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
