Since a bard can always sing the same tune.<br/>\nHowever, using the wrong instrument or singing a song that &quot;requires&quot; an<br/>\ninstrument doesn&#39;t produce the same effect as singing the song with the<br/>\nproper instrument.  For example, when singing Hymn of Restoration, the<br/>\nBard&#39;s healing song, you will gain roughly 3 hit points per &quot;round&quot;.<br/>\nHowever, while playing a stringed instrument (which is the &quot;required&quot;<br/>\nskill), you will gain 5 hit points per round.
