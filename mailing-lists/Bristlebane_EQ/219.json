By &quot;Tree-hugger&quot;, I assume you mean a Druid, as <br/>\nthat is what we have commonly been called.  However, I must point out that no <br/>\nDruid in the history of Norrath, as far as I have seen, follows the path of <br/>\nQuellious The Tranquil.  While I must agree with you on that the Hands of the <br/>\nTranquil have said some harsh things on many of the gods and goddesses we all <br/>\nlove and worship, I think it best we save this for the Gathering.  It will <br/>\nsurely be a heated topic of debate during the Philosophy segment, and I await <br/>\nthe oppertunity to debate this with those members of the guild.  Until then, <br/>\nkeep your cool and go have yourself an ale.  I think the Gathering will be <br/>\nsuccessful, as long as everyone remains patient.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as far as cleansing Norrath of all the orcs and gnolls... well give us a <br/>\nchance. It&#39;s not easy.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nStay safe, and good tidings!<br/>\n<br/>\n����Fennris McKay����<br/>\n����Guardian Wolf of The RainKeeper����<br/>\n����The Council of Truth����<br/>\n<br/>\n... dancin&#39; in the rain.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
