As a cleric I heal everyone for free along<br/>\nwith any buffs provided my mana is stable and I&#39;m near healthy. In<br/>\nfact, the only time I&#39;ve ever received coin for my services was a soul<br/>\nwho needed water and I was in need of food. He gave me an article I<br/>\ncould sell so that my needs were met as well. I realize the AI in the<br/>\ngame probably doesn&#39;t have the true equivalent of Karma but near as I<br/>\ncan tell &quot;what goes around comes around&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nVrachit, your humble (and slightly poor) Dwarven Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n--- JW IV &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:phule@...\">phule@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: JW IV &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:phule@...\">phule@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Wed, 21 Apr 1999, Ward Richardson wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Ward Richardson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jonah_right_here@...\">jonah_right_here@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just wondering what you meant by &quot;Almost<br/>\n&gt; Last-Named&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; When do you reach a point where you earn such a<br/>\n&gt; thing?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lvl 20 or so I think.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Crossbones the Monk, Kicking &#39;round in Queynos.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; P.S. -&gt; If anyone has any spare putrid rib bones,<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would be greatly appreciated as I&#39;m dying to get<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; next quest completed ;).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t help but feel greatly aggravated at the<br/>\n&gt; number of people who sit<br/>\n&gt; there and camp at the ruins in the hopes of taking<br/>\n&gt; advantage of monks who<br/>\n&gt; desperately need putrid rib bones.
