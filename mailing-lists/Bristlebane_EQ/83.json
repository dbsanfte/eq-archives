I \r<br/>\nteam up with one cleric all the time, he was of the 6th order and I was was of \r<br/>\nthe 5th and we had no trouble killing the skeletonss, Kobold Watchers, or Kobold<br/>\n\r<br/>\nShamens.  All give xp for this level.  The Shamens also give the paw which is a \r<br/>\nquest item for clerics, get them and turn them in for items. Just thought I \r<br/>\nwould let you know, our land doesn&#92;&#39;t see to many visitors.  Also the bears in \r<br/>\nQeynos hills are good opponents.  On another note another guildmember, Izum the \r<br/>\nProvidor, a cleric, are currently in the Kerra Plains on our way to adventure.  \r<br/>\nIf any would like to join us just stop us when we run by.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n                                       Zakrul the Traveler\r<br/>\n                                       Guildmaster of The Companions\r<br/>\n                                       Erudite Wizard \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThis mail sent through IMP: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.horde.org/imp/\">http://web.horde.org/imp/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
