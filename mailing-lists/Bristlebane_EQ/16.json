I play a level 4 mage (seemingly the<br/>\n&gt; only class on this <br/>\n&gt; mailing list) <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I am a level9 Shaman!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>nay, wizards are not the only class here... just the loudest!<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and I have a few questions about spells and such.<br/>\n&gt; Sorry for the <br/>\n&gt; list, but it&#39;s the easiest way to get it across. <br/>\n&gt; 1. Since you can only use Bind Affinity at level 12,<br/>\n&gt; are you basically stuck<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; in your home town until then? I find this hard to<br/>\n&gt; believe, since warriors <br/>\n&gt; might not be able to cast it, but some people have<br/>\n&gt; said this to be true.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;That is correct.  But, you are not limited to<br/>\n&gt; staying at home, just limit<br/>\n&gt; how far you go in your travels.  If that&#39;s Erudin,<br/>\n&gt; then  yeah, maybe you are<br/>\n&gt; stuck at home.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>actually that is not completely correct.  you are only stuck there if<br/>\nyou rely completely on yourself.  Others can cast Bind Affinity upon<br/>\nyou.  If your travels take you across the ocean, try to find a<br/>\nhigh-level wizard to Bind you there.  You spell-slingers all get along<br/>\npretty well, don&#39;t ya?<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. I started training in piercing, and lately I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; seen most fellow Eruditescarrying staffs or clubs. <br/>\n&gt; Was this a mistake? Does it even matter latter on,<br/>\n&gt; as you&#39;ll be fighting in a group and not using melee<br/>\n&gt; weapons?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I think that is right too.  At higher levels you<br/>\n&gt; wont care about melee<br/>\n&gt; at all I think.  Then again, I&#39;ve never played a<br/>\n&gt; wizard.  My shaman can<br/>\n&gt; fight melee pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Circumstances and your personality will dictate what you need.  If<br/>\nyou&#39;re a powergamer, then go to one of the EQ sites and check out the<br/>\nstats.  I think most eventually prefer staves, but if you&#39;re not as<br/>\nworried about the numbers you might just want to stick with the dagger.<br/>\n Otherwise you&#39;ve blown your investment...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. Hey, where&#39;s the music?!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I think I&#39;ve heard that music is only set up for<br/>\n&gt; SBLive and &quot;SoundFont&quot;<br/>\n&gt; cards.  However, I saw a post that they will soon<br/>\n&gt; release a patch so it<br/>\n&gt; works with other sound cards as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s all. Any help will be greatly appreciated. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Izin<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I heard the same thing.  I understand it&#39;s currently available on the<br/>\nTest Server... and they could always use more help.<br/>\n<br/>\nJantis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Have you visited our new web site?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Onelist: Helping to create Internet communities<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Come check out our brand new web site!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Onelist: Making the Internet intimate<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
