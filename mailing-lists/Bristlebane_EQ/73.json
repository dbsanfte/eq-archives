Places like Befallen used to be<br/>\nhappy hunting grounds where you could easily identify what portion was safe<br/>\nfor you and stick to that.  To discourage &quot;campers&quot; and other such things, EQ<br/>\nadded anti-camping spawns and other such things.  Now, you can be a low-level<br/>\nplayer happily slaying even /cons when some red, hit-only-by-magic creature<br/>\nspawns in your lap.<br/>\n<br/>\nI freely admit I died in Befallen last night.  We were in an area that our<br/>\ngroup could reasonably handle, we goofed a bit, and one unlucky anti-camping<br/>\nspawn finished me off.  I&#39;m fine with that as it was really our mistakes that<br/>\nkilled me.  However, as I&#39;m running back to Befallen I get to listen as the<br/>\nremainder of my party runs into something *worse* (dark elf dragoon) and madly<br/>\nflees Befallen.  After retrieving my corpse we prepare to leave and a ghoul<br/>\nspawns on us.  DOH!<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, so if increased difficulty was EQ&#39;s goal... what is the point?  If we went<br/>\nback in there 5 levels from now we would survive the &quot;hot&quot; spawns better, but<br/>\nnothing would give us XP anymore.  If the goal was anti-camping then they<br/>\nshould lower the spawn rate a bit, as there is no way we could hack our way in<br/>\nto our intended target, then hack our way back out through the near-immediate<br/>\nrespawns.  If we were high enough level to do so, again we&#39;d hardly get XP for<br/>\nthe accomplishment.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a player point of view, the only solution to this situation is to wait<br/>\nuntil there are enough PCs in a zone to make it safe to inhabit.  But then you<br/>\nlose out on all the fun of being the few brave souls alone in a zone.  And you<br/>\nalso end up with previously deadly zones like Blackburrow reduced to a gaggle<br/>\nof players standing around *WAITING* for something to spawn because they&#39;ve<br/>\nall killed everything.  I&#39;ve seen more suspense and danger at Wal-Mart.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhoeble, Monk of Freeport, Fan of wide-open spaces</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
