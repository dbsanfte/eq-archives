The first time I took a boat I had my 6th level wizard<br/>\nand I had about 10 pieces of cloth armor, great staff... the works.  I took<br/>\na ride to qeynos only to be killed by a shark through the boat.  i lost<br/>\neverything.  In dismay I made a new character, an enchater.  I got to forth<br/>\nlevel, bought a guild tunic for 8g and set off for Qeynos, on my way back I<br/>\nwas memorizing spells and all of a sudden I was attacked by a fire elemental<br/>\nand a zombie salior.  I died and lost everything.  I was told that a GM<br/>\nwould be notified, that was last friday and I have heard nothing.  I have<br/>\nbeen so unhappy.<br/>\n------<br/>\nWhen the people we love are stolen from us, the way to have them live on is<br/>\nto never stop loving them.  Buildings burn, people die, but real love is<br/>\nforever.  -- The Crow<br/>\n-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
