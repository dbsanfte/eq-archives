The events will commence 3:00 PM Pacific (5:00 PM Central). All<br/>\nraces and classes are welcomed to come and share in this festival of<br/>\nknowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\n(So far these are the events planned to take place. More may be added later.<br/>\nThe information for this gathering will be updated daily at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stonepool.com/hands.\">http://www.stonepool.com/hands.</a> This event is sponsored by a newly forming<br/>\nguild, The Hands of Quellious.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPhilosophy Discussion<br/>\n<br/>\nAll are invited to debate in a somewhat ordered discussion of the gods, war,<br/>\nignorance, and other important issues. (Of course this will be done in<br/>\ncharacter and will be a great opportunity for role-playing. We wish to also<br/>\nargue some of the player written Norrathian history contained on the web<br/>\npage above.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTrade Discussion<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will devote a bit of time talking about each trade, including research.<br/>\nHopefully we will answer any questions and peak the interest of those who<br/>\nhavenï¿½t discovered the wonders of the different trades. (If you wish to lead<br/>\nthe discussion of a particular trade, especially if you are experienced,<br/>\nplease contact me, I will post a running list on the web page in a few<br/>\ndays.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLanguage Lessons<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will mainly be devoted to sharing the normal race languages so that we<br/>\nmay all understand each other better. Any citizens wishing to share their<br/>\nknowledge of the elder languages is certainly welcomed hold free classes,<br/>\nbut we ask that there be no selling of languages. Participants my tip their<br/>\nteachers but (If you wish to share your language please contact me, I will<br/>\npost a running list on the web page in a few days.)<br/>\n<br/>\nScavenger Hunt<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will be for some of our younger attendees (anyone 7th level or lower).<br/>\nParticipants may form groups if desired but must share their prize. All the<br/>\nitems will be found close to the tunnel (only in the zones adjacent to the<br/>\neast commons). There will be prizes for all that partake in this quest.<br/>\n(There will be a story to go with the hunt.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOpen Market<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course as with every event in Norrath, there will be the selling of<br/>\ngoods. We would like mainly self-made goods to be sold here. Though the<br/>\nselling of acquired items is not prohibited, we encourage tradesmen to make<br/>\na bigger showing. (The method of sales will be announced later on the web<br/>\npage.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny questions or comments can be sent to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weeze@...\">weeze@...</a> or message Gwynn<br/>\nthe Enchatress on Bristlebane.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
