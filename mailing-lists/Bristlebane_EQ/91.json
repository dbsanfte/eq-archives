And they can do this repeatedly?  Not to mention<br/>\nthat the 1st and 4th level monsters will often have other items worth 1+ gp on<br/>\nthem?  Where else in Norrath can you find 1st level monsters dropping cloth<br/>\narmor?<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to hunt high and low in Freeport area for containers, yet in Everfrost<br/>\nit seems like every other gnoll pup or goblin whelp drops a box, bag or belt<br/>\npouch.  Oh, and there are 10,000 decaying skels which seem to have a 1 gp<br/>\nweapon about 25% of the time.  Also, of the races I&#39;ve seen it seems that the<br/>\nBarbarians have the easiest shot at armoring themselves.  Cubs for bearskins<br/>\nare about 4th level or so, and are everywhere.  Humans have to wait to kill<br/>\ntougher pumas.  The Faydark folk have to fight over the 1 wolf that seems to<br/>\nspawn every 10 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, just my little rant for the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a lighter note, my most excellent traveling companions and I have set out<br/>\non a little adventure away from Freeport.  Currently we are on Faydwer and<br/>\nhave seen many cities and many zones.  I highly recommend travel for anyone of<br/>\nsufficient levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhoeble, Wandering Monk of Freeport</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
