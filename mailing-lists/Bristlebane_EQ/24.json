I can be found there quite often and if not there, in Butcherblock singing those songs that make warriors stronger and heal their wounds and occasionally the one that finds their corpses....\r<br/>\nI am most often in the company of Grimm the Dwarven Paladin, and my woodelf Brother Rendal.  The three of us are a motley crew occasionally joined by Aradial the Cleric... sometimes we are found just sitting around telling brave war stories but more often than that we are found near the crossroads slaying anything that gets in our path....\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHopefully our paths will cross with those who need our assistance, I am always willing to lend a song to someone who has misplaced a corpse.... and Grim is never long without a set of patchwork for sale.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\ntravel safely and may our paths cross in friendship\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nQuin\r<br/>\nBard of Kelethin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
