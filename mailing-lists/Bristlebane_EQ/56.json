I<br/>\n\r<br/>\nmust say you all sure do go about how great you are but I have never heard of \r<br/>\nyou through any bard songs or even rumor.  Well I know that talkers are just \r<br/>\nthat.  So as I travel around Norrath I will stop by to say hello Zardoz in his \r<br/>\nelven city.  Itan I have yet to see you in my travels and I live in Erudin.  \r<br/>\nWell I think that is because I am out proving myself adventuring with all sorts \r<br/>\nwhile you two write each other thinly vieled love letters.  Well I let my \r<br/>\nactions speak for me.  If we meet in the future you can be sure to team with me.<br/>\n \r<br/>\nWe shall then find who is the mightiest.  For I work as a team which always nets<br/>\n\r<br/>\nthe best results.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI the great Zakrul have also decided to extend and invitation to anybody \r<br/>\ninterested in becoming an officer in The Companions.  We are an adventure guild \r<br/>\nthat is neutral and ultimate goal it to travel the land of Norrath to meet our \r<br/>\nfate.  If you are interested there are two officer slots open.  First come first<br/>\n\r<br/>\nserve. We currently have chapters started in Freeport, Qeynos and Erudin and \r<br/>\nwelcome the chance to start in other cities.  Drow, Trolls and Ogres need not \r<br/>\napply.\r<br/>\n                                                   Farewell,\r<br/>\n                                                          Zakrul The Travler\r<br/>\n                                                          \r<br/>\nOOC: Please email <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zdogg@...\">zdogg@...</a> with any interest.
