Hear!  <br/>\nfaction standings really are an iffy thing, cuz one may have or not <br/>\nhave, as the case may be a decent standing and may get wacked and our <br/>\nbrother monk said, without warning. <br/>\n<br/>\n Also, I tried out a Troll in the beta and had a lot of fun with her <br/>\nbut now if I play a troll, there is no way I can go into qeynos or <br/>\nany of the other civilized cities.  So it kinda limits your play.  <br/>\nBut picture this, a Troll warrior grouped up with some high elven <br/>\nwizards, in a dungeon!!!!!  talk about kicking some monster tail!! <br/>\nhehe  but how can it happen???  no way I know of.. *sigh*  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Also someone needs to let EQ know they gotta work on their player <br/>\nto player communication; it&#39;s, in my opinion, incredibly combersome.  <br/>\nDoes not lend itself to striking up casual conversations.<br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, I really like this game and I still think its <br/>\nyards ahead of UO but......<br/>\nKebas/Rugga/Zardoz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----Original Message Follows----<br/>\nFrom: Virginia Renaut &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vrenaut@...\">vrenaut@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nReply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bristlebane_EQ@onelist.com\">Bristlebane_EQ@onelist.com</a><br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bristlebane_eq@onelist.com\">bristlebane_eq@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [Bristlebane_EQ] Faction shmaction<br/>\nDate: 20 Apr 99 19:10:36 CDT<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Virginia Renaut &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vrenaut@...\">vrenaut@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than seeing those occasional &quot;your faction has increased with <br/>\nSo-and-so&quot;<br/>\nmessages, does anyone else find it scary that you have NO idea what <br/>\nany<br/>\nparticular group might think of you and what that means for your <br/>\ngeneral<br/>\nsafety?<br/>\n<br/>\nMembers of the crew I regularly adventure with made a few enemies <br/>\namong the<br/>\nFreeport militia.  Now many of the Freeport guards will attack them.  <br/>\nOk, that<br/>\none was fairly predictable.  However, when we adventured to Kaladim, <br/>\none of<br/>\nthese people was killed by a dwarven guard (StormGuard).  I&#39;m not <br/>\nsure that we<br/>\nfigured out exactly why.  The guard shouted something about his god, <br/>\nbut he<br/>\nshares a god with others in our group.  Was it related to the <br/>\nFreeport thing? <br/>\nWe may never know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish they would tell you when you select your god what the <br/>\nrepercussions<br/>\nmight be.  Picking one of the ultra-evil ones has obvious drawbacks, <br/>\nbut we<br/>\nhave no way of knowing what selecting any of the others will do to <br/>\nyou.  And<br/>\nonce in the game what are you supposed to do?  Two PCs conning an NPC <br/>\noften<br/>\nresults in similar messages (&quot;regards you dubiously&quot; or something <br/>\nlike that)<br/>\nyet only one PC will be attacked.  Kind of an expensive guessing game.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my ponder for the day.  Talk amongst yourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhoeble, Monk of Freeport, Almost Last-Named <br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--<br/>\nDid you know that we add over 1,000 new e-mail communities every day?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nExplore a new hobby, discover a new friend, laugh at a new joke!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
