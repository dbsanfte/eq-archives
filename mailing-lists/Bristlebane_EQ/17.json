I play a level 4 mage (seemingly the only class on this<br/>\n&gt; mailing list) and I have a few questions about spells and such. Sorry for the<br/>\n&gt; list, but it&#39;s the easiest way to get it across.<br/>\n&gt; 1. Since you can only use Bind Affinity at level 12, are you basically stuck<br/>\n&gt; in your home town until then? I find this hard to believe, since warriors<br/>\n&gt; might not be able to cast it, but some people have said this to be true.<br/>\n&gt; 2. I started training in piercing, and lately I&#39;ve seen most fellow Erudites<br/>\n&gt; carrying staffs or clubs. Was this a mistake? Does it even matter latter on,<br/>\n&gt; as you&#39;ll be fighting in a group and not using melee weapons?<br/>\n&gt; 3. Hey, where&#39;s the music?!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s all. Any help will be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Izin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Have you visited our new web site?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Onelist: Helping to create Internet communities </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
