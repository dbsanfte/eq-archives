I would expect a thieves guild would train in Sneak, but<br/>\nthey will not train any non thief until you have gained their favour (don&#39;t<br/>\nask me how).<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I could be wrong, and it may be that you just have to keep<br/>\npractising over and over.  Sense Heading has taken me a while to build<br/>\nwithout training.  You only gain in the skill with success, and early<br/>\nsuccess is rare, but as your skill increases, so do the successes and the<br/>\nbuilds.<br/>\n<br/>\nItan the Whistler</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
