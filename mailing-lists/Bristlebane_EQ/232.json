I am a Dark Elf Necromancer and go at will between the<br/>\ntwo zones via this tunnel.  I&#39;ve even traded with the only NPC there and<br/>\nhave not been attacked.  A gnome such as yourself should be more liked than<br/>\nme, thus I don&#39;t think you should have any problem.  Thus your only concern<br/>\nis getting through Freeport to the tunnel, which isn&#39;t very hard either.  If<br/>\nyou have Gather Shadows, then use it and you won&#39;t have to worry about<br/>\nguards or any other Freeport citizen.  Head south from the South gate of<br/>\nFreeport (actually within East Freeport zone) and enter North Ro, then<br/>\nfollow the right zone wall and you&#39;ll find the tunnel easily.  Keep going<br/>\nuntil you find an open area with the Swashbuckler inside (and hopefully<br/>\neveryone else that is there to trade).  The alternate route is to stay<br/>\ninvisible and make your way from East Freeport to West Freeport and then to<br/>\nEast Commonlands where you can follow the left zone wall and you&#39;ll find the<br/>\ntunnel inset in a hill.  Shouldn&#39;t be too hard.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kendrath<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWhat do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nThey both have communities at ONElist.
