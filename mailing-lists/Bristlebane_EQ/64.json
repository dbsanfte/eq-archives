I enjoy hearing of tales from<br/>\nafar, of wondrous sights to behold in the characters&#39; home cities, or of<br/>\ntheir abilities against the beasties.  What I asked to have stopped was the<br/>\nendless, immature, back-and-forth child-like banter of &quot;Your character<br/>\nsucks, and mine is SOOOO superior because...&quot; crap.  Thats all I was asking.<br/>\nIf this is too much, then fine, I will go away and look for the intelligent<br/>\ncorrespondence I assumed this would be.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
