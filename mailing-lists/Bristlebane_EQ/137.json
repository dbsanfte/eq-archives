Now many of the Freeport guards will attack them.  Ok, that<br/>\n&gt; one was fairly predictable.  However, when we adventured to Kaladim, one of<br/>\n&gt; these people was killed by a dwarven guard (StormGuard).  I&#39;m not sure that we<br/>\n&gt; figured out exactly why.  The guard shouted something about his god, but he<br/>\n&gt; shares a god with others in our group.  Was it related to the Freeport thing?<br/>\n&gt; We may never know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wish they would tell you when you select your god what the repercussions<br/>\n&gt; might be.  Picking one of the ultra-evil ones has obvious drawbacks, but we<br/>\n&gt; have no way of knowing what selecting any of the others will do to you.  And<br/>\n&gt; once in the game what are you supposed to do?  Two PCs conning an NPC often<br/>\n&gt; results in similar messages (&quot;regards you dubiously&quot; or something like that)<br/>\n&gt; yet only one PC will be attacked.  Kind of an expensive guessing game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just my ponder for the day.
