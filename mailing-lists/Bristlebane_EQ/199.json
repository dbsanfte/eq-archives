I&#39;m in need of help, and I thought that this would be the perfect place to get it.  I am the editor-in-chief of the EverGuide website, an &quot;unofficial&quot; companion guide to the EverQuest game (although, we did have a direct link to our site from EverQuest&#39;s news section during the first 3 wks of the opening of the game to the public).  Anyway, here&#39;s what I&#39;m after - info about you and your character.  Well, actually just about your character.  We&#39;ve had a shortage of writers for our site who have time to rp and write guide for their characters.  And honestly, not everyone can be every race or class.  So, then I thought, &quot;why not go and ask the people who are playing the parts about their experiences.&quot;  This will be posted on the site as, sort of an &quot;authority&quot; on that character or class.  So, you&#39;re input WILL BE HIGHLY VALUABLE!  I am requesting an onling interview of sorts.  Where I ask the questions and you answer, and also provide any other helpful info that would make the guide as thorough as possible.  In order that you all can get an idea of what I mean, please take a look at our few guides that we have published, and check out our cool (and busy) message guides @  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.missvalley.com/everguide/.\">http://www.missvalley.com/everguide/.</a>  Okay, so please, there are 115 of us here, I NEED SOME HELP!  It&#39;ll be fun and I&#39;m very friendly.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOkay have a great time rping today and all this week.  I envy you all more than you could know.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGod bless you all!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSerna (of EverGuide online).</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
