And they can do this repeatedly?  Not to mention<br/>\n&gt; that the 1st and 4th level monsters will often have other items worth 1+ gp on<br/>\n&gt; them?  Where else in Norrath can you find 1st level monsters dropping cloth<br/>\n&gt; armor?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Where else can a 10th lvl monk go fight blue and green critters and get<br/>\nmagically delicious armor as well?<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I had to hunt high and low in Freeport area for containers, yet in Everfrost<br/>\n&gt; it seems like every other gnoll pup or goblin whelp drops a box, bag or belt<br/>\n&gt; pouch.  Oh, and there are 10,000 decaying skels which seem to have a 1 gp<br/>\n&gt; weapon about 25% of the time.  Also, of the races I&#39;ve seen it seems that the<br/>\n&gt; Barbarians have the easiest shot at armoring themselves.  Cubs for bearskins<br/>\n&gt; are about 4th level or so, and are everywhere.  Humans have to wait to kill<br/>\n&gt; tougher pumas.  The Faydark folk have to fight over the 1 wolf that seems to<br/>\n&gt; spawn every 10 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Neriak is much the same way. Freeport has a certain amount of mobility<br/>\nand freedom in travel. However, the other races that are more trapped in<br/>\ntheir areas(trolls, dark elves, barbarians) have areas that are much<br/>\nbetter designed and allow for a person to stay in one zone and level way<br/>\nup.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Oh well, just my little rant for the day.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On a lighter note, my most excellent traveling companions and I have set out<br/>\n&gt; on a little adventure away from Freeport.  Currently we are on Faydwer and<br/>\n&gt; have seen many cities and many zones.  I highly recommend travel for anyone of<br/>\n&gt; sufficient levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thing is, the Faydark(both greater and lesser) really aren&#39;t all that<br/>\ngreat. I&#39;ve hit a few zones there(Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron is *gorgeous* at<br/>\nnight), but never been all that impressed with the monsies in most of<br/>\nthe areas. Admittedly, this may have been because I was spending much of<br/>\nmy time sneaking and running like a little girl from them. The joys of<br/>\nlow level travel. Ah.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend however that much like Rivervale, Ak&#39;Anon should be<br/>\nvisited at least once for pure shock value.<br/>\n<br/>\nDirque<br/>\nFollower of Quellios<br/>\nSometimes servant of the Dark Elves</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
