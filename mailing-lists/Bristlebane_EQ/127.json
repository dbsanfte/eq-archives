I reside in the city of Qeynos.<br/>\n&gt; Of late, I have spent the majority of my time slaying lions and<br/>\n&gt; grizzly bears in the Karanas with my fellow adventurer Rastaman, who<br/>\n&gt; is an 8th level warrior.  My point is, we started adventuring<br/>\n&gt; together when we both hit level 5.  We found that I got 65-70% as<br/>\n&gt; much xp as he did for killing enemies in a group.  Now I do not know<br/>\n&gt; what the exact figure is, but that is what we found.  That is why he<br/>\n&gt; has progressed to level 8 and I still remain at 7.  However, the<br/>\n&gt; hybrid class benefits, in my opinion,  far outweigh any extra xp-<br/>\n&gt; gaining time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Steve Price&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silten@...\">silten@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bristlebane_EQ@onelist.com\">Bristlebane_EQ@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: &quot;Bristlebane EQ Onelist&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bristlebane_EQ@onelist.com\">Bristlebane_EQ@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [Bristlebane_EQ] Level progression<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Wed, 14 Apr 1999 10:23:30 +0100<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Steve Price&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silten@...\">silten@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve not been able to get online for a week or so (except email),<br/>\n&gt; due to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;moving house, and I feel a bit out of touch.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My character is still a lowly 3rd level Erudite Wizard, due to<br/>\n&gt; limited<br/>\n&gt; &gt;playing time, but it has taken a lot more work than my beta<br/>\n&gt; character did<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(Barby Shamen).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;How are you all finding progression?
