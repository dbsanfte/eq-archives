I can be found in and about Freeport and the surrounding countryside.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a few items for sale which i have picked up in my travels which may be of interest.  Firstly, i usually have Cutthroat insignia rings on hand.  These are magical items, adding +2 to dex and 1 to ac.  Two can be worn at once, adding +4 to your dexterity.  These are also a monk quest item, by the way. These go for 1 plat a piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have 1 bronze main gauche, a piercing weapon that can be used even by wizards.  A very fast weapon, does 3 dmg with 23 atk delay. I&#39;m asking 4 plat for this rare item.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, a bronze rapier, with 4 dmg & 28 delay. I&#39;m asking 5 plat for this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you see me on, send me a tell.  If i don&#39;t have a ring currently, i&#39;m sure one of my companions will, and would be happy to sell one to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy travels all,<br/>\nXeones<br/>\n&lt;hr size=1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do You Yahoo!?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get your free @... address at &lt;a href=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com/&quot;\">http://mail.yahoo.com/&quot;</a>&gt;Yahoo!
