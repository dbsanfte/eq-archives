He also did a &quot;Bind&quot; for me <br/>\nand it has helped immensely.  I must warn you though, if you decide to <br/>\nhunt the common lands, do so after you have a &quot;bind&quot; done: the <br/>\nGriffons strike without warning and do more damage than guards do in a <br/>\nsingle swipe of their claws!  I have been felled 4 times by Griffons, <br/>\nbut thanks to Drugar, it was no major catastrophe, only a minor <br/>\ninconvenience.

As for getting bound, ask Drugar, he <br/>\nbound me <br/>\nto Freeport for only a platinum (and had the kindness to wait while I <br/>\nstumbled about the maze that is Freeport city). If you do venture into <br/>\nthe <br/>\ndeserts, I warn you to watch out for that character Dorn. He beat me <br/>\nup good, <br/>\nand his buddies didn&#39;t look very friendly either. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nFenwen <br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--<br/>\nLooking for the perfect gift for a friend?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nTell them about ONElist&#39;s 115,000 free e-mail communities!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
