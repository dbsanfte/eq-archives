Free enterprise at work.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just like selling bone chips to necros, and so on...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I am a cleric and I gladly heal for free. And undying loyalty<br/>\n&gt;is greatly appreciated as well :) It&#39;s part of the reason I<br/>\n&gt;chose to be a cleric. You always have a friend.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hear, hear. My most enjoyable RP moments come when, in the course of <br/>\nmy travels, I encounter a party of PCs resting after a terrible <br/>\nbattle. I stop to heal and bless each of them, discussing their <br/>\nrecent fortunes (or misfortunes) as I do so and as I meditate <br/>\nafterwards. Invariably, I leave with new names in my friends list, <br/>\nand having been blessed myself by their gratitude and vows of future <br/>\naid in my time of need. That type of experience is the distillation <br/>\nof why this is the only class for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;However, I&#39;ve encountered players who seem to think<br/>\n&gt;that&#39;s all I do, or that I somehow *owe* them. I&#39;ll be kneedeep<br/>\n&gt;in gnolls in black burrow, mana half gone, in a party, and get a<br/>\n&gt;tell &quot;Can you heal me?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm, I&#39;ve never had someone &quot;demand&quot; healing from me. I&#39;m not even <br/>\nsure how I&#39;d react to it. Most people are actually surprised that <br/>\nanother player would take time to stop and assist them without any <br/>\napparent motivation for personal gain- only a very few seem to <br/>\nbelieve themselves entitled to that aid. And I can easily disenchant <br/>\nthem of that notion...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;When I finally meet up with the individual all they need is to be<br/>\n&gt;&quot;topped off&quot; hp-wise. &lt;grrr&gt; It&#39;s repeat cases with individuals<br/>\n&gt;like these that I&#39;ll ask for donations :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Or claim to be out of mana, or type /ignore, or...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;As long as they aren&#39;t screwing other people in the process,<br/>\n&gt;I feel that if people have a service other people want, I think<br/>\n&gt;its their perogative to charge for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Or not to charge, as the case may be. I&#39;m 10th level as well, still <br/>\ntrying to decide what I&#39;m going to do with my ability to bind at <br/>\nlevel 14. I can easily see myself declaring open season for 15 <br/>\nminutes, binding all comers, asking only that they repay me by <br/>\nassisting others characters they encounter who may be in need. I can <br/>\nalso easily see myself charging everyone 5g to bind and buying a big <br/>\nfat chainmail helmet with the proceeds...=-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWalbort, Cleric of Brell Sirilis<br/>\nBristlebane Server<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
