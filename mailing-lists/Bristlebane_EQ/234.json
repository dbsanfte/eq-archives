Fed up of cowering from the ever<br/>\nswarming Sand Giants, most of Oasis (about 25ppl) formed an agry mob by the<br/>\npier.  A quick bit of organisation saw casters and healers grouped, and the<br/>\nnearest Giant was swiftly pulled to his death.  Not bad for a bunch of<br/>\nlv15 - 20s, with a lv30 or so tank.  Made for some truly excellent<br/>\nscreenshots, the poor thing didnt know who he was meant to be hitting as he<br/>\nswung from casters to healers to bashers and back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following day, they had their revenge though.  Some fool trained an SG<br/>\nonto Pillar1.  Total carnage, i and many others died staring at their spell<br/>\nbooks.  I believe he then went on to whack a few of the gawping crowd on the<br/>\nbeach too, which serves em right for staring at the accident.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen i got back, there were a LOT of naked people running around.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAunoa.<br/>\nCleric of the 16th.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
