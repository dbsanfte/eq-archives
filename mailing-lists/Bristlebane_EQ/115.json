I&#39;m in no great hurry, and I&#39;m<br/>\ncertainly not a power player, but I get the feeling that some class/race<br/>\ncombos have a much easier time of it than others, perhaps too much for<br/>\nbalance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the hybrid classes have to earn more experience, but does anyone know<br/>\nany details?<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
