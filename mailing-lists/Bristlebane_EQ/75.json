I&#39;ve recently arrived in Freeport and intend on staying <br/>\nthere for a while. However, my level 4 cleric can&#39;t yet use the spell Bind <br/>\nAffinity, and I&#39;m having trouble finding someone who can (or will) bind me to <br/>\nthe town. If anyone is located around there and has the spell, or knows <br/>\nsomeone who does, please drop me a line, (I&#39;m Fenwen in game). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for those of you who like hellish stories, here&#39;s one for you;<br/>\n<br/>\nI make the journey from Felwithe all the way to Freeport without much <br/>\ntrouble. I&#39;m wandering around the outsides of Freeport, and I see an asp. I <br/>\nsay, there&#39;s low-level stuff around here, it can&#39;t be that hard. Well, killed <br/>\nme in three hits, needless to say. So, I get sent back to Felwithe. I make it <br/>\nall the way to the docks at Kaladim, catch the boat, and I&#39;m on my way again. <br/>\nThis isn&#39;t so bad, I tell myself. Wrong again. I accidentally hit the windows <br/>\nkey and get thrown out of EQ. I log back on, only to find myself wading in <br/>\nthe Ocean of Tears, miles away from my destination, with my corpse slowing <br/>\ndecaying. So, I says to myself, what now? Well, I decided to swim for it. I <br/>\nmake it from 210, 300 to about 210, -8000 (An hour swim, adding in the fact I <br/>\nswam in circles for a good half hour) and I see a boat heading for me <br/>\nstraight on. I get a crafty idea and swim right into it - and right into the <br/>\nhold! But, it&#39;s going the wrong way.. it takes me back to Kaladim! So I wait <br/>\nthe trip out and finally arrive in Freeport. I run all the way to where I <br/>\ndied, and my corpse is, amazingly, still there. I&#39;ve never been so frustrated <br/>\nin my life.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
