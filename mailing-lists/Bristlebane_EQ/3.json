My ears are always open, and my powers are at your service.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf you are of the lesser races, then bow before my mighty intellect and humble thyself appropriately.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf you are a Necro of any race, then I swear to smite you and all your family from Norrath in due course.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRemember my name.  One day it will matter.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
