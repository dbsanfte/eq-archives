They must listen closely <br/>\nto hear his dizzy mutterings...&quot;... ratty ratty... h-h-h .. r-ratt rat rat.  <br/>\nh-h-h..  shhhhh... must... shhhhh.. still... still... ratty... h-h-h...&quot;Lying <br/>\nweak, disfigured and still in the desert dust the sickly figure feigns-death <br/>\nin a desperate attempt to lure a possible meal.  Too weak to move, too weak <br/>\nto beg, the hint of survival instinct is the only clue that intelligence once <br/>\nresided in the wretched, blood and dust heap of a man.&quot;shhhhh... shhhhh...,&quot; <br/>\nthe sound is like a swamp outgassing, until... &quot;Arr-ha!&quot; Sudden and quick the <br/>\nform closes on it&#39;s prey like a predatory plant... weak arms and legs curl to <br/>\nthe chest to encircle the curious visitor.  And then, too weak of fist or leg <br/>\nto seriously injure his prey, and lacking the needed teeth to be menacing, <br/>\nthe reeking pile of human waste wrestles furiously with the mottled <br/>\nbeast!&quot;Grrrr.. Grrrrgrrrrrr.... h-h-h-h.. grrrr grrrr.  RAA... grrrr.. <br/>\nahhhhaaaa!  grrrrr...,&quot;  the wrestling match goes on! And then, seizing his <br/>\nrat-assailant firmly between his two boney hands, and with a ferocity never <br/>\nseen by innocent eyes, the broken man begins beating his captive over and <br/>\nover and over again against his own head!  ...beating the biting and clawing <br/>\nbeast until his own forehead and face is covered in blood, who knows whose... <br/>\nand the match goes on. &quot;Arrrr... grrr....&quot;  ::squeek:: ::squeek::  ::squeek:: <br/>\n :squeeeek::Dear God, the guards each think quietly in turn.  They&#39;ve seen <br/>\nexamples of the effect of poverty upon mankind, but this is insane! And then, <br/>\nin a gesture of supreme jest, one guard reaches over and does the quick <br/>\n&quot;push/pull&quot; gag on his friend.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood Fortune,<br/>\nBeodog, Freeport Monk and Witness to Our World<br/>\nwww.gatheringorder.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
