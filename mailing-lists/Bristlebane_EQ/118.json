When I first created<br/>\nhim his ability was a couple of name levels above &quot;feeble&quot;... something<br/>\nlike &quot;fairly bad&quot;.  I have since been able to increase my skill once<br/>\nnumeric level, although I do not hide very often.  Also, my character<br/>\nis a warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not start out maxxed in my Hide skill, and I would assume that<br/>\nother races are the same.  Perhaps there is a separate racial limit<br/>\nthat is separate from the class limit.  Maybe this is Dark Elf only...<br/>\nI don&#39;t know<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I am sure of is that I did not start out with my maximum skill in<br/>\nHiding and it certainly is separate from my class (as it is not a class<br/>\nskill and I am only 5th level).  Perhaps the max for the race is 75 but<br/>\nyou actually start out with 25 or 30.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Drew<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way... thank you all for your quick replies to my previous<br/>\nquestions.  I will try again with the alcohol... perhaps brandy this<br/>\ntime.  If you see me around, remind me that I owe you a drink.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI knew my dark elf would have some troubles with KoS, but there may at<br/>\nleast be a chance I could train somewhere.  Perhaps I will try to get<br/>\nbound to the area BEFORE I inquire.... *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Virginia Renaut &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vrenaut@...\">vrenaut@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Virginia Renaut &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vrenaut@...\">vrenaut@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OK, here is the FULL scoop on this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Halflings have the *racial ability* to sneak and<br/>\n&gt; hide.  I don&#39;t know what<br/>\n&gt; &quot;skill level&quot; this translates to, but for<br/>\n&gt; illustration lets say it is 75.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Depending on your class, you may or may not get the<br/>\n&gt; *class ability* to sneak<br/>\n&gt; and hide.  If your class does get it, it will be at<br/>\n&gt; a certain level (your<br/>\n&gt; guild trainers will show you what level) and you<br/>\n&gt; cannot put more practices<br/>\n&gt; into it until that level.  Furthermore, using the<br/>\n&gt; skill will not increase the<br/>\n&gt; skill until such a time as your class gets the<br/>\n&gt; skill.  Argh, hope I&#39;m being<br/>\n&gt; clear.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; More on this... lets say you have the racial skill<br/>\n&gt; at 75, and your class gets<br/>\n&gt; the ability to learn the skill at level 10.  At<br/>\n&gt; level 10 the skill would be<br/>\n&gt; capped at (level*5)+5 or 55.  So even though at 10th<br/>\n&gt; level your guild will now<br/>\n&gt; train you in it, they wont because you are already<br/>\n&gt; maxed out in it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know any of the specific numbers, nor how<br/>\n&gt; often this wierd stuff<br/>\n&gt; happens (although there are a number of races that<br/>\n&gt; get sneak or hide), but<br/>\n&gt; this is how it has been explained to me.  Use the<br/>\n&gt; skill if it helps you, but<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t expect it to improve at all until such a time<br/>\n&gt; as your guild would train<br/>\n&gt; you in it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Phoeble, Traveling Monk of Freeport.0<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; shop.theglobe.com * One Stop Shopping * Free<br/>\n&gt; Shipping in the U.S.!   <br/>\n&gt; Live Personal Shopper * Satisfaction Guaranteed * No<br/>\n&gt; Hassle Returns!    <br/>\n&gt; Accessories, Apparel, Gourmet, Jewelry, Kids,<br/>\n&gt; Outdoors, Sports, More!<br/>\n&gt;              <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
