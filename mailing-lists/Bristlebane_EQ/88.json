I finally made<br/>\nlevel 7! As the previous advice suggested, I finally found a kind L17<br/>\ncleric named Zebediah who bound me to east Freeport. I managed to help<br/>\nlead some parties in the east Commonlands and will the final strike on<br/>\na Giant Scarab I obtained the 7th order of the Cleric Order. Nothing<br/>\nmuch happens there but I had been stuck on 6 so long it was a welcome<br/>\nchange. Now I can&#39;t wait til 8 so I can meditate and 9 where I start<br/>\ngetting some cool spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I&#39;m trying to raise the coin to purchase a sewing kit so I<br/>\ncan try my hand at making patchwork armor. I&#39;m a little low on the AC<br/>\nfor a Cleric of my size and could certainly use the help. Does anyone<br/>\nrecommend using my coin to buy the higher order armor for now or wait<br/>\nuntil higher levels where I can generate a little more coin and just<br/>\nsave my coin now for spells at level 9? Any suggestions are certainly<br/>\nwelcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour humble Cleric,<br/>\n<br/>\nVrachit<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Doc Lotus &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:doclotus@...\">doclotus@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Doc Lotus &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:doclotus@...\">doclotus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Greetings everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is your friendly neighborhood Dwarfen Cleric,<br/>\n&gt; Vrachit. Just wanted<br/>\n&gt; to say hello and also ask if others are finding it<br/>\n&gt; as hard as I am from<br/>\n&gt; level 6 and up. I am 6 now and having hard time<br/>\n&gt; finding good things to<br/>\n&gt; kill or parties to kill them will. I am often found<br/>\n&gt; in freeport but<br/>\n&gt; spend most of my time in Butcherblock, as it is<br/>\n&gt; easier to fetch my<br/>\n&gt; corpse (which I seem to be doing a lot of lately).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any advice you have for this struggling healer would<br/>\n&gt; be most<br/>\n&gt; appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You can now easily share photos and documents with<br/>\n&gt; your fellow list members<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out our homepage for details on how to use our<br/>\n&gt; new shared files feature!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
