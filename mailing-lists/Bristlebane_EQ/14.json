I dearly love flaming you erudites, <br/>\nhehe)<br/>\nIzin, put down your play things and pay attention: you&#39;re about to <br/>\nreceive instruction from the fount of all knowledge.<br/>\n*sigh* Once again I, Zardoz the Great High Elven Mage, shall instruct <br/>\nthose barbarians who call themselves Erudites.  You poor vacant skulled, <br/>\ndabbler, it&#39;s simple.  Bribe someone to bind you to where you wish to <br/>\nreturn.  In the great and marvelous city/fortress of Felwithe there are <br/>\nlots of clerics and mages quite willing to take pity on one such as you <br/>\nand will bind you.  Offering a few pp would probably help your cause a <br/>\nlot also.  So, wherever it is you wish to return to, upon your demise, <br/>\nhave a more astute worker of the arcane arts perform this  binding for <br/>\nyou.<br/>\n(OOC: most higher level clerics or mages will do it for free if you ask <br/>\nnice.  at least I would.)<br/>\nConcerning staffs: All who are wise in the way of the world know this, <br/>\nmy slow witted one, that staves and two handed staves do much more <br/>\ndamage than daggers. ( OOC: a one handed staff has the potential for <br/>\nmore damage than the timing penalty increase you incur for using it; <br/>\nmore bash for just a little more time.  however never neglect to pickup <br/>\nthat handy spell: summon dagger.   hehe  it insures you&#39;ll always have a <br/>\nweapon if you need one.)<br/>\nIf any of you vastly uninformed erudites out there have more questions <br/>\nthat need answering, I will gladly help enlighten you.  After all is it <br/>\nnot the responsibility of the older, more astute races to guide, even <br/>\ntolerate, the babbling of the youner, definitely more dim witted races, <br/>\nlike Erudites and Humans???<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Zardoz, the great and magnificent High Elven Mage, supreme weilder <br/>\nof the Arcane Arts<br/>\n<br/>\n----Original Message Follows----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Ratsmak106@...\">Ratsmak106@...</a><br/>\nReply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bristlebane_EQ@onelist.com\">Bristlebane_EQ@onelist.com</a><br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bristlebane_EQ@onelist.com\">Bristlebane_EQ@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [Bristlebane_EQ] A couple questions..<br/>\nDate: Mon, 5 Apr 1999 11:06:42 EDT<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Ratsmak106@...\">Ratsmak106@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHello everyone. I play a level 4 mage (seemingly the only class on this <br/>\nmailing list) and I have a few questions about spells and such. Sorry <br/>\nfor the <br/>\nlist, but it&#39;s the easiest way to get it across. <br/>\n1. Since you can only use Bind Affinity at level 12, are you basically <br/>\nstuck <br/>\nin your home town until then? I find this hard to believe, since <br/>\nwarriors <br/>\nmight not be able to cast it, but some people have said this to be true.<br/>\n2. I started training in piercing, and lately I&#39;ve seen most fellow <br/>\nErudites <br/>\ncarrying staffs or clubs. Was this a mistake? Does it even matter latter <br/>\non, <br/>\nas you&#39;ll be fighting in a group and not using melee weapons?<br/>\n3. Hey, where&#39;s the music?!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all. Any help will be greatly appreciated. <br/>\n<br/>\nIzin<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nHave you visited our new web site?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nOnelist: Helping to create Internet communities<br/>\n<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
