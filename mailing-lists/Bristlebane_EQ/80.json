As for getting bound, ask Drugar, he bound me <br/>\nto Freeport for only a platinum (and had the kindness to wait while I <br/>\nstumbled about the maze that is Freeport city). If you do venture into the <br/>\ndeserts, I warn you to watch out for that character Dorn. He beat me up good, <br/>\nand his buddies didn&#39;t look very friendly either. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nFenwen</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
