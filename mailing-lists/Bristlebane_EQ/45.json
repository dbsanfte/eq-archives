For about 5 minutes, 50 some-odd messages ago.<br/>\n    This is not what I wanted to be reading when I signed up for this<br/>\nemailing list.  I had hoped for some rousing tales from the bards, some bug<br/>\ninfo, event notices, maybe even some auctions.  Not child-like, immature,<br/>\nboring pissing contests.  I have been on the list for only a day, and it<br/>\nwill be my last, if I continue to receive this mindless banter.   If you<br/>\nfeel you must continue with your &quot;My character hates your character<br/>\nbecause...&quot; spam, please do the rest of us the favor of exchange email<br/>\naddresses with the relevant party, or ICQ numbers, so that you may bore each<br/>\nother in private, not us.   Otherwise, please log into the game and take it<br/>\nto the chat room, so that the rest of us may #ignore &lt;you&gt;.<br/>\n    I do not, by any stretch of the imagination, presume to speak for the<br/>\nmoderator of this site, nor do I wish to come across as overbearing.  Let us<br/>\nhave a democratic vote on keeping these postings aligned with relevant<br/>\ntopics, please.  If not a vote, then at least we can try to use our own<br/>\nself-discipline and refrain from such topics as &quot;All &lt;insert relevant race<br/>\nhere&gt; SUCK!!&quot;.  Thank you.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
