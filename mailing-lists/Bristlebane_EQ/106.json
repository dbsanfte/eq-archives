Everyone has two<br/>\ncombat skills in addition to their chosen weapon<br/>\nskills known as offense and defense... offense, as it<br/>\nrises, allows you to get the most out of your weapon,<br/>\nincreasing both damage potential and likelihood of an<br/>\nattack succeeding. Defense, on the other hand, allows<br/>\nyou to get the most out of your armor, and as it<br/>\nincreases, so does the effectiveness of your chosen<br/>\narmor. <br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, a level one character could, indeed, put on<br/>\na full set of plate mail, but it would have nowhere<br/>\nnear the same effectivenes as the exact same suit on a<br/>\n20 level character, but would still be a darn sight<br/>\nbetter than any other level one&#39;s armor class running<br/>\naround without plate mail... so good armor is<br/>\ndefinately of use to lower level characters, just not<br/>\nnearly as effective as it will become as the charatcer<br/>\ndevelops.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I may be wrong here, but I believe that higher order<br/>\n&gt; armour is of little<br/>\n&gt; use to a lower level character.  You will not gain<br/>\n&gt; the extra AC<br/>\n&gt; benefit at lower levels as your character is deemed<br/>\n&gt; to not be<br/>\n&gt; experienced enough to make the best use of it.<br/>\n&gt; Go for the spells.
