Personally, even though I didn&#39;t attack the giants, I<br/>\nloved it - the beach was empty! All the deepwater crocs were wandering<br/>\naimlessly around, not being attacked from 3 people at once as usual!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone know where I can stop my second name from being repeated? Must<br/>\nhave signed up late one night, that&#39;s the best excuse I can think of<br/>\nfor why it&#39;s doubled :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun all, give me a yell if you need a shadow knight in the group<br/>\nto hunt Cazic, nearly 20th at long last (15 deaths last weekend didn&#39;t<br/>\nhelp I guess)<br/>\n<br/>\nKhalabbil<br/>\n<br/>\n--- SB &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bbail05@...\">bbail05@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: SB &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bbail05@...\">bbail05@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;One last thing - why do people in the Oasis insist<br/>\n&gt; on training sand<br/>\n&gt; &gt;giants into other people before they die? Can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; they have the good<br/>\n&gt; &gt;grace to just die AWAY from the medditating mages?<br/>\n&gt; Just something that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bugs me : )<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The worm turned on the past weekend.  Fed up of<br/>\n&gt; cowering from the ever<br/>\n&gt; swarming Sand Giants, most of Oasis (about 25ppl)<br/>\n&gt; formed an agry mob by the<br/>\n&gt; pier.  A quick bit of organisation saw casters and<br/>\n&gt; healers grouped, and the<br/>\n&gt; nearest Giant was swiftly pulled to his death.  Not<br/>\n&gt; bad for a bunch of<br/>\n&gt; lv15 - 20s, with a lv30 or so tank.  Made for some<br/>\n&gt; truly excellent<br/>\n&gt; screenshots, the poor thing didnt know who he was<br/>\n&gt; meant to be hitting as he<br/>\n&gt; swung from casters to healers to bashers and back.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The following day, they had their revenge though. <br/>\n&gt; Some fool trained an SG<br/>\n&gt; onto Pillar1.  Total carnage, i and many others died<br/>\n&gt; staring at their spell<br/>\n&gt; books.  I believe he then went on to whack a few of<br/>\n&gt; the gawping crowd on the<br/>\n&gt; beach too, which serves em right for staring at the<br/>\n&gt; accident.  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When i got back, there were a LOT of naked people<br/>\n&gt; running around.  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aunoa.<br/>\n&gt; Cleric of the 16th.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
