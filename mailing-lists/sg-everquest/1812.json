As you guys know, SOO cost at least 400-600pp <br/>\nin the realm.  Thus I think it&#39;s only fair that all who need the staff AND <br/>\nphysically participate in the hunt pay at least 50pp to Garren for his 3 <br/>\nhrs service, so that he get at least 200pp for the assistance (ie if 2 <br/>\nperson coming, each pay him 100pp, if 4 person coming, pay him 50pp each). <br/>\n Of coz it&#39;s up to dearest Garren if he choose not to charge us any fee for <br/>\nthe service, hehehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, make it a short and sweet hunt.  We will camp for Borxx the CB EYE. <br/>\n Every one (including Garren himself, which mean u guys who cant make it <br/>\nfor the trip can pay him 500pp for ths staff, hehe) get a lens and I will <br/>\ngate all back to GF (ok I offer this service FOC, thou&#39; I got 50pp last <br/>\nnight gating a party of 5 from GF to WC last night, hehe).  Once in GF, we <br/>\nwill &#39;chong&#39; to the the Gnome observer. Someone will create an enchanter <br/>\ngnome with MAX CHA, then we pass lens one by one to him and he get the SOO <br/>\none by one for us.  Once done, I will gate all to WC, for free again! ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow we just need Garren to nod his head ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh last note.  Borxx can charm.  So participants pls get ya CANCEL MAGIC <br/>\nspell rdy.  If u haven&#39;t got it, u can buy it from Felwithe.  It&#39;s a very <br/>\nuseful spell against those debuff spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus Planeswalker<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: Another msg coming up on general comments for group hunt.
