I don&#39;t<br/>\nplay Quake though. I would get motion sickness in 5mins. Anyway, I do use<br/>\nthe other view type, the top down view. There are bonus to hit and damage<br/>\nif u attack from behind (at least that&#39;s what I heard from a player. And I<br/>\ndo find that I hit more often and damage higher sometimes).<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;The good thing about using the ass-cam etc is so you can look behind you<br/>\nand around to spot oncoming monsters &lt;gnolls are good are creeping from the<br/>\nback and if I see Fippy/Garrax Darkpaw, I&#39;m gonna kick them real hard!&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo idea on this one. I&#39;m a Monk. I&#39;m my weapon and armor itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;My sentiments exactly! Welcome Brother!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne hour in real life is like 1 whole day in EverQuest &lt;morning til night&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yeah, and I hate that. You can hardly see at nite if u&#39;re human or don&#39;t<br/>\nhave any lightsource with u.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;For those unlucky shumacks humans without infravision or the other &quot;talent&quot;<br/>\ngo buy a large lantern at 2gp++ to save banging your head in the walls when<br/>\nwalking. BTW, banging your head on the wall for 1 hour takes up 150<br/>\ncalories.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, generating 3ds are quite space and memory consuming...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Never thought of that. Stupid me!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Marcoing is still present but MUCH MUCH SO MUCH MUCH SO MUCH more less<br/>\neffective.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Aye, actually what marcoing?? That game u bascially use hotkeys to play<br/>\nthe game. And better brush up on the typing skills. U&#39;ll want to type very<br/>\nfast in certain situation. Heheh.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Marcoing the continous pressing/meshing of the same button to train a<br/>\ncertain skill. Eg, I sit and keep pressing the Sense Heading keys while<br/>\nwatching Friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;If your Lawyer or your Boss is drowning, would you choose going to the<br/>\nmovies or to StarBucks? &lt;drafted&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; If Starwars in being screen then, it&#39;s Starwars!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Right on Dude!!! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
