No doubt TSK is cool, but I think we need a wiz for group gate at<br/>\n&gt;higher lvl.  Moveover, with the previous experience, I feel more<br/>\n&gt;comfortable making one.  Comparing all races available for wizard, gnome<br/>\n&gt;seem to be the best (in fact they are more suitable for magical class then<br/>\n&gt;other races).  They may not have the highest INT (acually 2nd highest), but<br/>\n&gt;their overall stats are more suitable as a wiz - high INT, DEX & AGI.  Only<br/>\n&gt;problem is their low CHA, which mean I&#39;m buying scrolls are 10-20% higher<br/>\n&gt;than my High Elf wiz - gate scroll at 6gp instead of 5 in Felwithe.  On the<br/>\n&gt;other hand, having high AGI and DEX allow me to avoid more enemies attacks<br/>\n&gt;and cast faster.  I only throw in 5 for my STR, coz 60 is too low to carry<br/>\n&gt;loot around.  I top up my AGI and DEX with 5 points each to 90, the rest<br/>\n&gt;goes to my INT, making it 123.  A wiz life is hard for pple like me, since<br/>\n&gt;I do not have more time to play as compared to those who are having their<br/>\n&gt;study holiday now, but I guess I&#39;m already get used to it ;)  On yeah, with<br/>\n&gt;my previous experience in Innoruuk, I can also save more money from not<br/>\n&gt;buying those useless spells, hehe.  That makes up for the higher price I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;paying due to low CHA.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I spend 5 hrs last night, getting my char to lvl 4.  No doubt Prexus got<br/>\n&gt;the most players (900) amg all servers when I first login, but I encounter<br/>\n&gt;no lag at all.  The whole newbie hunting ground outside gnome city is very<br/>\n&gt;crowded when I just login around 7pm but at 8pm onwards, the crowded<br/>\n&gt;reduced by alot, guess it&#39;s working/schooling time for most US/Canada<br/>\n&gt;players then.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway I&#39;ve changed my name.  Zilxxx is a nice name which I like very much,<br/>\n&gt;but it&#39;s my last resort coz most of my favourite mage names are taken up in<br/>\n&gt;Innoruuk.  In this new server I managed to get my favourite big bad evil<br/>\n&gt;archwizard name - Mondain.  For those who grow with the 3 most popular RPG<br/>\n&gt;PC games (Utlima, Wizardry, M&M), Mondain is a name that strike fear in<br/>\n&gt;many Ultima players hearts.  Yes, he is the evil archwiward that fight with<br/>\n&gt;Lord British in the very 1st series of Ultima!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now that we have a wiz, a necro, bard and a ranger.  I think it&#39;s time we<br/>\n&gt;need a shaman/cleric and one more tank - warrior/paladin.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mondain (Wizard, Prexus)<br/>\n&gt;Ziltus (Wizard, Innoruuk)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;p/s: At least now I&#39;m not always the last one to loot, LOL ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Wednesday, June 09, 1999 12:13 AM, Leshrec [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Leshrec&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I created a necro already, dark elven too ) Hes level 3 now but i hope i<br/>\n&gt;can<br/>\n&gt;&gt; get him to 4 b4 tomorrow ) Name is same, Leshrec.

So coincident, we always select the same race and class,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;great minds think alike?  LOL.  I guess I better change char liao this<br/>\n&gt;time<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;(thou I always fancy the Life Tap spells of necro), so that we can pair<br/>\n&gt;up<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;to hunt.  How abt a TSK?  More evil than u leh.  Hehe, since u wanna<br/>\n&gt;play<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;evil, play dark-evil necro lor, ;)  We can meet and tag team (tank and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;caster) to destroy all light in Prexus server!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Regarding the XP thing, not sure if new EQ server gain xp faster, but<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;very true for UO new server.  In mature server it takes months to make a<br/>\n&gt;GM<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;smith but in new server it only take a week or two. I guess it&#39;s not a<br/>\n&gt;bad<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;time for us to try it out, esp our chars are all pretty young in<br/>\n&gt;Innoruuk.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; No harm trying too, say spend few days to a week there.  Maybe we all<br/>\n&gt;gain<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;much higher lvl in new server as compare to few weeks play in Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;I think DE Necro and TSK will make a great EVIL team.  One more shaman<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;(healer/buffer)  will be nice for a evil party, whahahahahahah!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Btw Les, Gandalf is more for good char.  Not so suitable for evil char<br/>\n&gt;leh.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;On Tuesday, June 08, 1999 3:40 PM, Leshrec [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As you guys might have known, the new server Prexus is up already.<br/>\n&gt;Being<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;a wizard, I have always wanted to play the dark side and have always<br/>\n&gt;been<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;fascinated by the necromancer&#39;s array of spells. Therefore i have<br/>\n&gt;decided<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;to make a Gnomish Necromancer in the Prexus server and see how it goes.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Being a new server, less people would probably be there, and thus the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;initial xp gain should be speedy enough. Anyone who is willing to switch<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;servers for a while to try out the class they always wanted, but not<br/>\n&gt;able<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;to bear to leave their main characters can always join me. )<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; My nick there would probably be Gandalf but if server does not allow<br/>\n&gt;it,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;then Khadgar or Leshrac.
