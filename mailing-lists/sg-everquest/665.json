Im here, some of us are always here.<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Race server?? Oooh, nice BUT im still on innoorruk, Good to take a look see how race server is like..but INNORRUK still the BASE.<br/>\n     <br/>\n    If some of u guys r not sure where u r goin to be, here&#39;s my suggestion.<br/>\n    1) have a base char here in Innorruuk. Go play at Race server .u still have a fix char in Innorruk.<br/>\n    2) Go to other servers and moonlight in all the servers and still be at  a lvl  6th 12months from now :P<br/>\n    3) Quit Playing EQ and get a life<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Regarding resources... I hope we dont have a mis-understanding here..on what im about to say.<br/>\n    We (the ppl on Innorruuk) would be most happy to share our resouces(money, items, time,life etx) with the not so &quot;regular&quot; players in Innorruuk but I dont think im going to share a 100pp item and not see it being used. It doesnt make sense. You still have my friendship, that is free and without condition :)<br/>\n     <br/>\n    I love to play with u guys. I give a Singapore Guild my prority. SOme of U knows that im in a Guild already. I recommend any player approaching 20th lvl to be on a guild for &quot;networking&quot;, resoucring and the utimate gaming experiences.<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Lvling is NOT the game or just a goal. Enjoy the journey and take in the adventure. Xp comes along with it.<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Stick to 1-2 chars for heavens Sake ! wait till u reach lvl 30 or so to have muti char.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n    Yiyang&#39;ing Loudy at Innorruuk<br/>\n     <br/>\n      -----Original Message-----<br/>\n      From: Sereph &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n      To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n      Date: Wednesday, June 16, 1999 2:22 PM<br/>\n      Subject: [sg-everquest] Must read!!!<br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      This is an atempt to make us a tad more organise <br/>\n      We will from now onwards, be 100% base on Innoruuk. Anyone who disagree, give me your address and I&#39;ll force you to agree with a parang. <br/>\n<br/>\n      This is the short list of characters we have, please fill it up. <br/>\n<br/>\n        Name     Character    Class     Race       Level   Location <br/>\n        ----------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/>\n        Sereph   Sereph       Bard       Half Elf  3       Greater Faydark <br/>\n        ------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/>\n        LKW      Ziltus       Wizard     High Elf  12      Freeport <br/>\n        ----------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/>\n        Alex     Yiyang       Monk       Human     17      Freeport <br/>\n        -------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/>\n        Entreri  Radeon       Monk       Human     4       Freeport<br/>\n      <br/>\n      Groups will be form base on levels. Each member in the group should not have a level difference of more than 3/4 from each other. This is to make grouping worth doing for the high level guys, and the lower level ones. <br/>\n<br/>\n      If possible, please summit a character report every friday night indicating your current level/where you are/what items you&#39;ve found etc......... <br/>\n<br/>\n      So far, here are the groups: <br/>\n<br/>\n      Group 1, Level 15-19 -&gt; Alex(Tank) <br/>\n      Group 2, Level 10-14 -&gt; LKW(Magic support) <br/>\n      Group 3, Level 5-9 -&gt; ??? <br/>\n      The rest who are still very low level-&gt; Enteri(Tank), Sereph(Secondary Support) <br/>\n<br/>\n      Anyone who change server, or propose a change of server without a valid reason will be forced to treat everyone on the list to lunch, for a week, so, don&#39;t anyhow change servers.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
