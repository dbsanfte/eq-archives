The SBS is given to Einan, our only local kakis cleric.  Due <br/>\nto time constraint, we are unable to hunt for more.  Furthermore, becoz of <br/>\nthe anti camp thingy that was implemented, the spawning of SBS are even <br/>\nmore rare.<br/>\n<br/>\nNevertheless I will con&#39;t to look for more SBS for local kakis like <br/>\nTrifrost, Sereph and other tanks once I go back Faydark.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight is Friday night, as per usual I will be training at NRo derv camp <br/>\nnext to mountain till morning.  All kakis who wish to join me are most <br/>\nwelcome to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
