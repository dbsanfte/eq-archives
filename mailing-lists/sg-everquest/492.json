This is becoz too many pple wanna get the <br/>\ngoodies from TSK or Necro but yet wanna enjoy good faction after killing <br/>\nhundreds of orcs by selecting agnostic (coz it help in improving ya <br/>\nfaction).  Afterall evil classes are made more powerful to compensate their <br/>\nfaction hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nDark Elf alone shld be quite easy to improve faction - Kenven once did it <br/>\nb4 as a DE warrior, by killing many orcs and he can enter Freeport at lvl 9 <br/>\nI think (but some npc merchants at commonlands still refuse to do biz with <br/>\nhim).  But DEN is more evil, so u will need more time to gain good faction.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not we create a Dark Elves/Trolls evil team, forget abt the good <br/>\nfaction thingy and bash the good races city, hehe.  I read some high lvl <br/>\ndark elf wizards/shadow knights actually attack Freeport guards in other <br/>\nservers (no need to find monsters to hunt, lol), sound kewl!<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, Leshrec also got a DEN in Prexus server.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMondain<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Monday, June 14, 1999 9:07 AM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ok... im not sure if its true... ive read up article from either Everlore <br/>\n </span></blockquote>or EQVault... or EQ Stratics... in one of the necro guides... it mentioned <br/>\nno able to choose agnostic fer Dark Elves anymore... wonder if its true...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fred aka SilverHand.<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Entreri<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Monday, June 14, 1999 9:55 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [sg-everquest] Something...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   To improve faction,there are 2 ways<br/>\n&gt;   1.If possible,choose agnostic when choosing ya race...<br/>\n&gt;   2.kill as many orcs as possible<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Entreri<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a><br/>\n&gt;   ICQ UIN: 2326860<br/>\n&gt;   Previewer, Singularity Gaming Network<br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sg-gaming.net\">http://www.sg-gaming.net</a><br/>\n&gt;   Your Single Source of Everything Gaming<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   .plan at<br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=\">http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;     From: Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     To: SG-Everquest Mailing List &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Date: Monday, June 14, 1999 8:30 AM<br/>\n&gt;     Subject: [sg-everquest] Something...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     hi all,<br/>\n&gt;     it seems that quite abit had happened over the pass weekend when i <br/>\n </span></blockquote>wasnt around...  the party got formed... n stuff like that... n ive readup <br/>\nabit on the few websites over the weekend... i think in general... the <br/>\nnecromancer has spells that spread over a pretty wide range... from <br/>\nsummoning... to direct damage... to healing... that no one spellcasting <br/>\nclass can provide... however this is with the drawback of faction.... so i <br/>\nguess my first char in EQ will most likely be a Necromancer... but i havent <br/>\ndecide to make a Erudite or Dark Elf Necro ... most likely Dark Elf... but <br/>\ni think i need to do more research on faction n stuff like that.... maybe <br/>\nsome of u guys can help me out here... esp Leshrec...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     1. is it that bad that a Dark Elf Necro is KOS in other towns/cities?<br/>\n&gt;     2. how difficult is to be able to better the faction so that one can <br/>\n </span></blockquote>enter those cities without KOS? n how can u do it?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     3. what about Eruite Necro?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Pls advice :) although i havent got my EQ here yet... but i would <br/>\n </span></blockquote>like to be fully prepared fer it b4 it comes... :) hopefully within this <br/>\nweek... otherwise next... as i can only play during the weekend...
