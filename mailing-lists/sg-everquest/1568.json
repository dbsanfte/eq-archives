Normally I use root and nuke (with my most powerful <br/>\nspell) tactics.  But when the mob resist my root for the 2nd time, I will <br/>\nswitch to melee and nuke (with my 2nd most powerful spell, 40% less dam, <br/>\n40% less mana but cast much faster).  And surprisingly, I still managed to <br/>\nsurvive in Lake Rathetear using these 2 method till now. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who are pondering between lvl 20 to 24 who cant still solo a <br/>\naviak guard now, I offer FOC Power-Leveling-Training sessions in Lake ;) <br/>\n I&#39;ve helped Deadflower and Flyingfox to lvl few times using this method, <br/>\nand will be willing to help all others local kakis if u need my training <br/>\nsessions.  Basically we will go to the 2-birds isle and try to spread the <br/>\nspawning of the aviak guards one after another instead of both at the same <br/>\ntime.  The trainee will solo the bird, and I will monitor both HP.  Once <br/>\nmob HP drop to below 50%, I will start nuking it to death. In this way, the <br/>\ntrainee can solo safely.  At lvl 26, some of the green chicks still give me <br/>\nxp, and best of all, no faction hit.  Come to think of it, Lake loot in <br/>\nterm of money is not bad.  With one night hunting, I normally get ard <br/>\n20pp-30pp (but also spend alot buying my leather skin reagent, 5gp plus per <br/>\ncast, one night can spend 10-20pp), that&#39;s after I sell all the rusty and <br/>\nbronze weaps.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only condition is that if there is any aviak guard con blue to me, I <br/>\nwill get it.  Reason is becoz 50% of the green chick no more giving me xp, <br/>\nwhereas they still con blue to the trainee.  Of coz sometime when blue bird <br/>\nspawn 3 in a row and I&#39;m oom after the 2nd bird, trainee can get it. <br/>\n Trainee also get to hunt all those bird con green to me, which more than <br/>\n50% of the time con blue to them (if u r below lvl 22, no bird will be con <br/>\ngreen to u, hehe).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how long further can the Lake give my xp, esp when I reach lvl <br/>\n27.  If birds still give me xp at lvl 27, I will stay there and offer <br/>\ntraining sessions, if not I will go elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, during the training session, we dun hunt in group.  Instead we hunt <br/>\nsolo so tat trainee can get ALL the xp.  Based on my past experience, <br/>\nkilling 2 birds in a group of 2 will give less xp killing 1 bird by solo. <br/>\n I still believe in this principle.  For those magi/necro out there, we <br/>\nhave confirm with GM that pet is treated as one of ya team member even if u <br/>\nare soloing.  Basically pet will eat the summoner&#39;s xp regardless if it <br/>\nkill the mob or not.  They say mob only eat xp from other group members if <br/>\nit kill the mob, this I&#39;m not sure but it definitely will eat the summoner <br/>\nxp.  When I train FF, I will ask him to dismiss pet so tat he can get all <br/>\nthe xp.  EQ is quite balance - with pet u can hunt tougher mob with better <br/>\nloot, but u will get less xp ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus, the PLT (Power Leveling Trainer)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, 05 August, 1999 8:51 PM, Entreri [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Entreri&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ive created a new chr .Hes a bard,level2 :)..but In faydark,so u might <br/>\n </span></blockquote>wanna<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hunt with me :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Entreri<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a><br/>\n&gt; ICQ UIN: 2326860<br/>\n&gt; Previewer, Singularity Gaming Network<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sg-gaming.net\">http://www.sg-gaming.net</a><br/>\n&gt; Your Single Source of Everything Gaming<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; .plan at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=\">http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thursday, August 05, 1999 5:13 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [sg-everquest] Starting a new char<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;At lvl 26 with 2 bubb more to lvl 27, I really hate to restart, thou&#39; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;personally would LOVE to have a new dream char tat start with lvl 20<br/>\n&gt; &gt;*grin*.
