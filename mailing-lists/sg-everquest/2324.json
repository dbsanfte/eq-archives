They have pretty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interesting points from both sides of the views.  If u visit the newgrps<br/>\n&gt; &gt; alt.games.everyquest, take a look at this tread ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sine wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, what your comparing is someone with a career and is working all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; day vs. someone without a career and doesn&#39;t work. While I agree that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there may be issues about the wisdom of how one spends their time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (real life OR game time), if you don&#39;t respect others then you&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; viewed by the majority as a Jerk(tm). You can&#39;t bring your real life<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;ve got a great career&quot; high-and-mighty attitude into the game and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; say, &quot;You&#39;re camping? Obviously your time is worthless. I&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; moving to the front of the line now.&quot; without having a lot of people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; make a rude gesture at you. How do you survive waiting in traffic?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I survive waiting in traffic because traffic runs in an orderly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; progression that&#39;s set up by the laws of our country. For the most part,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is a very effective means of transportation and in addition to that,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t really have any other choice. Camping is a player-decided<br/>\n&gt; &gt; method, that is not enforced or endorsed by Verant. You mentioned<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;moving to the front of the line.&quot; Who is their to say that their&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; line? A group of players atht decide there is a line. What if I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; choose to see a line? Camping for jboots is not a good analogy with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; traffic, because it&#39;s not effective to the majority. Camping and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lines are effective for people that have the time and devotion to spend<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 17 hours straight looking for the item. But what about people that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have that time? I guess they are completely exluded from ever<br/>\n&gt; &gt; having the chance to own a pair, because they don&#39;t choose to follow a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; set of guidelines that players create to take advantage of a problem<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with gameplay. In my perfect EQ world, there would be no camping, which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is why I despise it in some forms so much. Before I really knew all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; these unwritten rules, I went to the derv camps in ro once. There was a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group of 6 there. I sat by and waited and watched as they killed 6 or 7<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dervs. I figured they were camping so I let them do it. After their 6<br/>\n&gt; &gt; derv, I saw one spawn near me (it was pretty far away from them), and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; attacked it. Next thing I know the group runs up and starts to lay a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beating on it. I get the exp, and then proceeded to get cussed out by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the group for attacking the derv. I had no idea what I had done wrong.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I hadn&#39;t thought I had KSed since I attacked it first and it wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anywhere near them, and I figured I wasn&#39;t being a hog since I let 6<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dervs spawn for them before I attacked it. It turns out I was in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wrong because I hadn&#39;t asked for their permission to attack it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; According to EQ logic, since they were there first and had a group, they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;owned&quot; the camp and all it&#39;s spawns, and I was being an asshole for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; taking one of their spawns and not asking for permission to have it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s sad whenever i&#39;m in a group and a soloer comes up and says &quot;can I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have next?&quot; What would they do if we said no? I don&#39;t necessarily know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a solution, but the fact that people think that because verant designed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it poorly, they have a right to it makes me sick. I solo a lot, and it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is almost impossible to do that at most camps. So I just go to a camp,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wait until the other groups have had a sufficent and reasonable number<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of spawns, and then attack one and drag it away out of group range. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; usually leave after that kill because EQ culture has produced this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; environment where players feel guilty about taking another player&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spawn. I follow this culture for the most part. I NEVER atatck<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something that another player has already engaged, regardless of whether<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m &quot;camping&quot; it or not, and if there appears to be a line for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something, I usually blend in with it. But don&#39;t ever try to tell me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that you &quot;own&quot; a kill because you have created a line. You don&#39;t own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything in the game until it&#39;s in your inventory. And although I may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; follow the same general practices of everyone else, I won&#39;t buy into the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; concept that players have more right to an item than others.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You&#39;re taking a liberal approach (indivual oriented) vs a conservative<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approach (group oriented). You&#39;re only concerned about yourself, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to hell with everyone else.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; An individual approach is conservative, while a group approach is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; liberal.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ATTENTION ONElist MEMBERS:  Get your ONElist news!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Join our MEMBER NEWSLETTER here:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gary Qui Hong Loong<br/>\n&gt; Technical Support Executive<br/>\n&gt; Pacific Internet Technical Support Department .<br/>\n&gt; Pacific Internet Limited.<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt; Pacific Surf : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pacific.net.sg\">http://www.pacific.net.sg</a><br/>\n&gt; Technical Support Helpline : 1800-8723330<br/>\n&gt; Customer Support Helpline : 1800-8725055<br/>\n&gt; 89 Science Park Drive<br/>\n&gt; #04-09/12 The Rutherford <br/>\n&gt; Singapore 118261<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!
