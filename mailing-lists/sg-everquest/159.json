But later at<br/>\nsoloing, a paladin, Ranger, Shadow Knight and Warrior (yes warrior) would be<br/>\nbetter. They can melee well enough, Paladin, Ranger can heal themselves easily.<br/>\nShadow Knight can do lots of damage (harm touch I think) and has a pet with<br/>\nhim. Warrior can dual wield, double attack and kick, and with squad ring, u can<br/>\nkinda act like a low level paladin ^_^.<br/>\n<br/>\nLKW wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Entreri&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sorry my nick called  Kenven so many of u cant add me :P<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyway the DarkElves are a cool bunch of ppl with the &quot;Hi Breathen and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Greetings Brother&quot; showered me with scimitars and such..reallllly cool<br/>\n&gt; ppl!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No wonder I keep using the tell/friend command but cannot get u.<br/>\n&gt; So u insist in training a dark-elf?  Cool.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Only problem...I die too much :( and keep getting lost around...Currently<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Only saw Yiyang on the server..<br/>\n&gt; What class are you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night I didnt advance much, dun see u guys online.  I team with a lvl<br/>\n&gt; 6 dward cleric who is blur sotong, hunting orc.  He keep healing only<br/>\n&gt; himself and let me die.  Die 4 times on a straight row and lost a bar of<br/>\n&gt; XP.  I disband and hunt solo.  After play for an hr or so just to recover<br/>\n&gt; what I lost.  ;(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone can help me getting a great staff (not worn)? ;)<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m now trying to gather money by hunting small animals/monsters outside<br/>\n&gt; Felwithe, quite time consuming, worse is no XP gain, hunt for the sake of<br/>\n&gt; loot only and sell.  Earn 4pp so far but spend all on getting a senior<br/>\n&gt; apprentice robe for mage.  On the other hand, no kakis to team up hunting<br/>\n&gt; for bigger monsters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe gotta start training a cleric to hunt for money/xp, at least cleric<br/>\n&gt; got melee skill and can stand as a semi-tank, yet can cast some spells ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus (ok call me Zil, heh).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; How many communities do you think join ONElist each day?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; More than 1,000!
