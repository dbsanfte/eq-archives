After that, I happilly log out of CT, and went to<br/>\nInno, to do a bit of the Stein quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, while I was hunting birdies with Kalandra in lake, using my<br/>\ncleric, I ganna GM warp to Qeynos Aquaducts(aka GM torture room) for<br/>\nquestioning. During this time, I was totally LD, and Kalandra&#39;s HP was<br/>\nquite criticle when I got back.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did the damn GM teleport me for? Well, they think that the reason<br/>\nwhy my enchanter is leveling up so quicky is because I&#39;m either hacking<br/>\ntheir servers or exploiting bugs. I yell at them for several minutes,<br/>\nmade some rude signs, and they agree to let me go, while they<br/>\ninvestigate the matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning, log in to CT, play for a while, then another blasted GM,<br/>\nthis time an a Verant admin, and he/she/it apologize for the treatment<br/>\nthey did and will discuss some more, about my request, to keep this<br/>\nthing harsh harsh.<br/>\n<br/>\nPray that the request is done because..... my request was for a server<br/>\nteleport to Innoruuk :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSabella Anna Estasis, Enchanter of the 12th Rank.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Ogre bouncers gives relative good XP if you can kill them.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
