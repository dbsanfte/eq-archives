Now FF got a FBR, he will then pass the Thug robe to the <br/>\n&gt;next kakis who can use it.  This way we can practice kakis heritage system <br/>\n&gt;which will benefit more kakis.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Hunting,<br/>\n<br/>\nFlyingFox Everest, Level 29 Magician </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
