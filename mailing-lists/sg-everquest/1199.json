I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1581023185\">I dun think u can get banned for stealing kills personally, but I&#39;m unhappy <br/>\nto see own guild members doing it so obvious with a guild abbrev on his <br/>\nhead.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agreed with Leshrec tat maybe that Lionessa bitch know GM, but if I got <br/>\nbanned for such thing (esp kena accused), this game doesnt worth me staying <br/>\non.  But good news tat GMs are aware that wiz are always finger-pointed for <br/>\nstealing.  It&#39;s unavoidable for wiz to nuke much faster than other races, <br/>\nbut again nuking is different from stealing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thank Garren for his support.  As a matter of fact, Sereph and I have <br/>\nlaunched a big complaint to Wylven.  Wylven is fully awared of it now, and <br/>\nVoy has admitted his mistake on stealing from his guild mates.  But frankly <br/>\nspeaking, my bigger concern is when he steal kills with our guild abbrev on <br/>\nhis head.  I&#39;m confident that I won&#39;t lose kill to Voy, just that my whole <br/>\ngroup is meleeing the mob that day so I dun see the need to waste mana and <br/>\nVoy come in to steal.  I remember when I first meet Fiona, a lvl 12 wiz <br/>\nfrom Higher Order of Arcane and she help me to bind and retrieve my corpse, <br/>\nI really think very high of her guild.  But nowadays I see Higher Order Of <br/>\nArcane members stealing kills everywhere, I think they kinda sux.  I&#39;m not <br/>\nsure if u guys agree with me, but if Wylven only restricted Voy from <br/>\nstealing on others but not restricted Voy for been a &#39;well-reputatable&#39; <br/>\nstealer, I think I will quit from the guild.  Knn my UO guild is so <br/>\nwell-known in Baja shard for been so honorable, my UO kakis will beat me up <br/>\nif they knew I join a stealer guild (which is as bad as looter/pking guild <br/>\nin UO).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I see, Wylven didnt clarify if he restricted Voy from plain <br/>\nstealing or just stealing from members.  Coz according to &#39;spy&#39;, Voy is <br/>\nstealing again this afternoon in HH.  Let see what our boss said b4 I make <br/>\nany decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus, High Elf Wizard of the Sixth Circle<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: Kakis like Garren shld know how sickening when his BCC is kena stolen, <br/>\nhehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sunday, 11 July, 1999 6:26 PM, Leshrec [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Leshrec&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hmm I don&#39;t understand why kill stealing will make a person kenna banned.<br/>\n&gt; Well, its fustrating to players, yes but its in no way illegal.

But he is too weak to steal from our group of lvl 18-20, and he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mentioned he just wanna hit once to gain faction.  We have no objection<br/>\n&gt; &gt;over this and we also try not to attack his prey.  He gain from lvl 9 to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lvl 13 within the weekend, which is pretty fast.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;H/w, last night while hunting at HH, I noticed he started to steal from <br/>\n </span></blockquote>our<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;group.

I ask him why is he doing such thing to his own guildmate and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>he<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;said he just need 1-3 more kills b4 he log.  The true fact is tat he is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;actually stay longer than that.  He is stealing at HH, and he steal from<br/>\n&gt; &gt;from another groups as well.  He steal so ofen that one players from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;other guild, Lionessa, started to make noise.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I started to observe how this Voy hunt and at one time I was even <br/>\n </span></blockquote>accused<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;by Lionessa for stealing her kill, while it&#39;s actually Voy who did it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(I&#39;m<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;just watching with OOM!).  I&#39;m kinda pissed to get such accuse.  Shortly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Lionessa page for a GM, and Voy log immediatelywhen GM Glim arrvived<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(guilty I guess).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;When GM Glim arrive, I explained to him, and he understand the situation<br/>\n&gt; &gt;which wiz are always accused of stealing kills.  He also understand it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Voy who did the stealing and I&#39;m innocent.  GM Glim then went off <br/>\n </span></blockquote>shortly.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Later part of the hunt, this Lionessa come over and drop comments saying<br/>\n&gt; &gt;she have make few stealers banned by GM since she played EQ for 4 mths.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; WTF?  My problem if she kill too slow?  I wanna stressed again that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;casters in my groups NEVER steal kill, in the sense that we never wait <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;other teams to hurt the mobs for 30-40% HP b4 we start to nuke.  Members<br/>\n&gt; &gt;like Ling, Flyingfox, Satoru and myself hunt often but I&#39;m firm to say <br/>\n </span></blockquote>we<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;gain xp with our hard work.  When there are groups of lvl 20s steal from<br/>\n&gt; &gt;us, we hardly make any noise but to hunt elsewhere, so I can&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>understand<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;why cry babies like Lionessa make so much noise.  Anyway later Demitry<br/>\n&gt; &gt;suggest to all group members to petition for players harrassment (since <br/>\n </span></blockquote>her<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;words sounded SO threatening, hehe), and well, no GM come, haha.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This is just a note to all local kakis to watch out for this member<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Voyesbian.  Not that we are not helpful but I caution all to think twice<br/>\n&gt; &gt;before helping this kinda players.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Our boss Wylven (who is unaware of this incident) made Voyesbian a guild<br/>\n&gt; &gt;officer last weekend, and the thought of sharing an officer post with <br/>\n </span></blockquote>such<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;player make me sick.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Ziltus.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;p/s: U guys noticed we got more wiz in guild nowadays?
