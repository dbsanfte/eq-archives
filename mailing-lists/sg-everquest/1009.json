The  princple is actually very<br/>\n&gt; straigh forward - buy a chicken or 5 eggs 1st.  If u buy 5 eggs, u can<br/>\n&gt; either eat them up (spend on items) or hatch them for chickens (buy<br/>\nscrolls<br/>\n&gt; and use them to hunt for money, but take longer time at ya lvl,  imagine<br/>\n&gt; the time & money u need to spend to keep the chickens, hehe).<br/>\n&gt;  Alternatively, u can buy a chicken (train ya brewing) and let it lay eggs<br/>\n&gt; (money).  In the short run, spending money on eggs more shiok, in the med<br/>\n&gt; run, spending on chicken is more practical.  In the long run, ultimately<br/>\n&gt; both achieve the same result, hahaha.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nice chicken and egg theory huh, LOL ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just a comparison.  U spend 4 night hunting earning 40pp.  H/w, u can also<br/>\n&gt; spend 5-8pp to max brewing to 135 in 2 hrs, and another 2 hrs to make<br/>\n20pp.<br/>\n&gt;  So first night u make 20pp plus max skill.  Just spend another 3 nights<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; 4 hrs u can get 140pp (MIN) in total easily, hehe.  At this rate u can<br/>\nearn<br/>\n&gt; a FBR in 1 week.  This remind me of my UO kakis Asmandi Dragon who used to<br/>\n&gt; spend 1 whole week just chopping tree making wooden shields and sell to<br/>\nnpc<br/>\n&gt; in order to buy his 2-storey house, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hope this msg will motivate u guys to pick up brewing, it&#39;s really worth<br/>\n&gt; spending time and effort.  Of coz, I dun expect u to brew for 4 whole day,<br/>\n&gt; I myself brew 2 hrs also bu ta han liao.  With brewing skill, rather than<br/>\n&gt; hunting desperately for $ (which can be a pain when u face a whole camp of<br/>\n&gt; stealers or no one wanna team with u), u can actually spend 1 hr daily<br/>\n&gt; brewing to give yaself some stable source of money.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Leshrec got a good point on buying scrolls.  For the 1st 2 cycles, I try<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; buy all scrolls only to find out that I only used 2-3 at most.  In the end<br/>\n&gt; I spend so much money on useless scrolls.  When I come to 3rd circle<br/>\n&gt; spells, I seek Leshrec&#39;s advice on which scrolls to buy (since we both<br/>\nwiz,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s nice to have someone ahead of u sometime to share with u his<br/>\n&gt; experience, hehe).  Coming to 4th circle I more or less know wat kinda<br/>\n&gt; spell is impt for wiz.  Lvl 5 there is more useful spells, so I buy more<br/>\n&gt; scrolls.  With the help of my brewing, I already got all the wanted<br/>\nscrolls<br/>\n&gt; for my lvl 20 (all gate, dd and armor spells except instill which I heard<br/>\n&gt; need research?), and still saving for my Gossmer Robe or FBR.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Btw, if u can, try to get the dimension bag scroll 1st. This is a VERY<br/>\n&gt; useful spells for low str caster coz this summoned bag can carry stuffs at<br/>\n&gt; weightless(?)!  The only thing u need to remember is to empty them b4 u<br/>\nlog<br/>\n&gt; since they will disappear when u log.  At high lvl, u will loot stuffs<br/>\nlike<br/>\n&gt; bronze weap and ring/rawhide armors which r pretty heavy.  So this bag<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; come in VERY handy.  U can even sell it to non-magi for some money if they<br/>\n&gt; intend to camp at wulu wulu place w/o merchants & bank! Since magi can<br/>\n&gt; summon bandage, u guys got the cheapest mean to train bind wound, which is<br/>\n&gt; a very nice skills to have when soloing with a pet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One &#39;mis&#39;-concept abt binding is tat many casters take it as a source of<br/>\n&gt; income, but frankly speaking I only take it as a utility spells.  I never<br/>\n&gt; bother to offer bind for a fee unless I&#39;m in good mood or I&#39;m abt to log -<br/>\n&gt; for free.  Of coz donation welcome.  So far I heard the max amt pple<br/>\n&gt; willing to pay is 1pp, and so far I leave it to other to give me as a<br/>\n&gt; donation - max 5gp so far, hehe.  The power of binding cannot be measure<br/>\n&gt; via monetary term.  It&#39;s one of the most useful spells casters have, not<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; a trade but as the ability to adventure.  Comparing with the tank who cant<br/>\n&gt; bind, we casters are so fortunate that we dun have to spend time running<br/>\n&gt; all the way to our corpse.  U r right that lvl shld come first b4 money,<br/>\n&gt; esp when u r below lvl 16.  Dun complain too much abt lousy loot.  We used<br/>\n&gt; to hunt caimen and croc at oasis and the best loot on them is a piece of<br/>\n&gt; meat tat we can sell for 7cp, hahaha.  Most of the pple dun even bother to<br/>\n&gt; pick them up.  Only poor wiz like me go around picking the rubbish, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m also picking up smithy slowly now, after spending 20 skill point on<br/>\nit.<br/>\n&gt;  H/w, when camping at HH I&#39;m now having problems buying sharpening stone.<br/>\n&gt;  Anyone know where can I get that in HH?  Does HH got a bank?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Monday, 05 July, 1999 1:07 PM, Leshrec [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Leshrec&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My suggestions on buying spell. Usually, unless i have money to burn, I<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; buy the required spells. For me its usually 3 spells per spell circle<br/>\n&gt; since<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most of the other spells are useless. I only buy the rest of the spells<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a circle higher since I like to have a full spellbook ) I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know about magicians since I never played one, but I think a DD spell<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Water E summoning spell at each circle would be best if yer trying to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; economise since u never know when a person is gonna sell a much needed<br/>\n&gt; armor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; piece or weapon. Of course, maybe there are other spells a magician<br/>\nneed,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but as I said I don&#39;t know. As for trade, once you get to about level<br/>\n20,<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think its much more profitable to do dungeons such as Unrest. Each mob<br/>\n&gt; there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; holds 1pp so in a group of 6, getting 20 pp is no problem within about<br/>\n&gt; 1-2<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hours since lotsa mobs there.. Of course trade skills like blacksmithy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; surely gonna be damn profitable in long run since can make a few hundred<br/>\n&gt; pp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in an hour, but thats gonna be a long time before you can start<br/>\n&gt; attempting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on it (heard cost price very high).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Synzzz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hannibal@...\">hannibal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, July 06, 1999 12:41 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [sg-everquest] Money money money, hehe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot;Synzzz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hannibal@...\">hannibal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Hey Ziltus,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Wah lau, don&#39;t make it sound like we&#39;re begging for money leh.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I know I complained i&#39;m broke but i didn&#39;t say I wanted you guys<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to give me any :P Donations are always accepted lah of course<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;but the key thing, i believe, is that I don&#39;t go around hoping for them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;or asking you guys for any.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;It&#39;s just that i spent 3 whole nights making 40+ pp from hunting? And i<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;spent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;them all on my lvl8 spells which cost 3pp 9gp 8scp per spell.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m almost lvl 11 and i&#39;m just thinking at this rate...when i hit lvl<br/>\n12<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;buy those  new spells at 5-6pp each...i need at least another 60pp??<br/>\n&gt; Wah..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;siong man<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I did hear of the brewing thing...just that when first heard of<br/>\nit...was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;sure of the details...but i guess now i probably would try.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;One more thing is that in my area where i&#39;ve been hunting of late...you<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;better exp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;but only shitty bones for loot. (Mummies, skeletons,chessboard Skel<br/>\n&gt; Pawns,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;etc...)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;So i had to choose between levelling and making money. I chose<br/>\nlevelling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cos<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;i want to hit lvl 12 faster...the bind affinity spell i thought can use<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;make some money!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Alot of ppl are willing to pay 1pp at least for a bind somewhere. Best<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;man...if got 20 ppl<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;in one night...20pp liaoz...LOL Don&#39;t think so easy lah hehe Besides<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;only do that when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;i&#39;m short on cash (which is most of the time).

I think brewing<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; very useful trade skill which can easily fulfill ya financial needs,<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that it&#39;s kinda boring and take times.  Nevertheless comparing with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hunting, brewing still give me better and faster return than hunting<br/>\n&gt; so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; far.  If we can spend 1-3 hrs a day brewing, I dun see why the new<br/>\n&gt; chaps<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cant do the same ;)  No doubt we try to help by sponsoring abit, but<br/>\nu<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;guys<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; have to help us to help yaself sometimes ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; One thing for sure, we the local kakis always keep items which we<br/>\n&gt; think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; other kakis can used (eg I keep cutt ring for newbies, ring mails for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tanks, garren keep thu robe for me, les keep woven for me etc).  We<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; try to help as and when we can, but one must understand the fact tat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; utimately u r the one playing the game and handling ya own char,<br/>\nhehe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; IMHO, brewing can make some quick buck.  At lvl 10 u shld be able to<br/>\n&gt; save<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; up to 10pp.  Of coz I know pple will use them to buy stuffs like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; weap/armor/scrolls.  But just ponder - if u spend it on brewing, u<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;earn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; even more to buys stuffs, at the same time maxing ya skill.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; At lvl 18 now, I&#39;m still picking up bone chips, rusty weaps, animal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skins,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; beetle eyes and even rat tooth (7cp) to sell.  FYI I&#39;m a wiz with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; weakest STR amg all races and I keep SIX bags on me to carry loot.<br/>\n&gt;  Many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; times u see me walking between EC and WC while I&#39;m actually running<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 200% overload on me, haha.    If I can try so hard to save up money,<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dun<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; see why others cant do it. ;P<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Ziltus.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; p/s:  Just FYI, the npc at tunnel buy at a lower price than FP npc,<br/>\nso<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; die die gotta &#39;walk&#39; back to FP sell.  Now u see I earn all my money<br/>\n&gt; &gt; using<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all my blood, sweat and tears, hehe ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist<br/>\nSponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;With more than 20 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;...ONElist is home to the liveliest discussions on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
