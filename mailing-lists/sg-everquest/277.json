Leshrec, Trifrost and I was suposed to go to<br/>\nFaydwek. I was looking forward to it. too bad the ship didnt come. it was<br/>\n&quot;under repair&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Call a GM, my friend was given a free transportation from Freeport to<br/>\nQeynos. Wheew...surely saved him alot of travelling time. Haha, but make<br/>\nsure to be really polite.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know if any of u guys r keen on any of this expedition.<br/>\nHit Frogglocks, get woven and mesh and get out. I should think that Guk is<br/>\na whole day trip of 6 hrs(real Time), including hunting. Getting there is<br/>\npretty fast. about 15 mins(real time).<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;6 hours will get you very little. Not enough to go around. Trying to get<br/>\nnetted armour as loot is hard enough. I believe in just saving up and then<br/>\nbuy it from some merchant. BTW, Guk has a reputation for being an easy<br/>\ndungeon near the first few areas. Then its hell...especially with the<br/>\ntrains. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
