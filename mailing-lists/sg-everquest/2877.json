They are both my closest<br/>\n&gt; buddies in UO Baja, and have gone thru&#39;s numerous live & death battles<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; me in my entire UO life.  Both of them are veteran online RPGers, so you<br/>\n&gt; guys dun have to worry abt them behaving like a newbie, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They are Mistaya (lvl 30? wood elf ranger) and Yura (lvl 9 high-elf<br/>\n&gt; enchanter).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mistaya is playing in US time zone, so for those US players, if you are<br/>\n&gt; training ya twink at ya timezone, do consider her as a team member.  ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yura is now staying in Australia, and is playing around S&#39;pore time zone.<br/>\n&gt;  So for S&#39;pore twinks, you know who to ask for hunting ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Both of them are mature players, so you know you can count on them at all<br/>\n&gt; times.  Pls be nice to them if u happen to meet them online, thx.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As Mistaya is playing in US timezone, she might be better off joining US<br/>\n&gt; guild.  Yura, on the other hand, play in our timezone.  Maybe some of u<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; team with her and find out more abt her.  I really wish to invite her to<br/>\n&gt; the guild and I know she will contribute well in EQ, just like my UO guild<br/>\n&gt; in Baja.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thx.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Remember four years of good friends, bad clothes, explosive chemistry<br/>\n&gt; experiments.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4051/8/_/436545/_/960350449/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4051/8/_/436545/_/960350449/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
