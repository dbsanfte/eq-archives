Now I intend to help her to camp for dvinn dagger and dwarven chain <br/>\ntunic (these 2 mobs spawn quite often right?), can I do so?  Coz CB tower <br/>\nsure crowded with newbies.  If I walk in like a newbie (with all my stuffs <br/>\nkept in bank), can they use the Yield rule to chase me out? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThx.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
