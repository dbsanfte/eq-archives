I will not be entering your credit card<br/>\n&gt; number. If you are willing to help, I&#39;ll send you my The Station user<br/>\n&gt; name and password.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All you have to do is to edit my account info,  by filling in the<br/>\n&gt; credit card number and your house address.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The info will be sent to Sony and no matter what i do, I can&#39;t check<br/>\n&gt; the number oif the credit card. If you don&#39;t believe, try to edit your<br/>\n&gt; own account. It won&#39;t show you the number.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And now on Guk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a rough plan up now *search around and pull out an A0 size<br/>\n&gt; paper covered with tiny words*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let&#39;s see.... First off, I need to know the agility(modified and<br/>\n&gt; unmodified) of the following tanks. This is to determind who be<br/>\n&gt; primary tank and who be the secondary one<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Garren<br/>\n&gt; Yiyang<br/>\n&gt; Aaleku<br/>\n&gt; Yutaka<br/>\n&gt; Kenven/Kellindel<br/>\n&gt; Sunblade<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Next, int value of these nukers, so that I can plan what time you guys<br/>\n&gt; should nuke (remember guk has a high spawn rate. Nuking on site is too<br/>\n&gt; mana ineffective)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt; Leshrec<br/>\n&gt; Nicademous<br/>\n&gt; Zanderion<br/>\n&gt; Kalandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wis base casters don&#39;t need to report. See your face knows how much<br/>\n&gt; mana you have already.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Each group there, will have to assign someone to be the &quot;kamikaze<br/>\n&gt; piolet&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Function of this guy? If a big train is started, this guy will be<br/>\n&gt; responsible of taunting the WHOLE train, and die, while the rest<br/>\n&gt; gate/run out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For the 20+ group, I&#39;ll volunteer for this since I get a incredible<br/>\n&gt; 50% exp bonus while in a full group and my area effect DOT songs can<br/>\n&gt; taunt like no tomorrow. For the other 2, decide who gets to die among<br/>\n&gt; yourself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now on supplies. The 2 magician and 3(2 if Neriss go MIA) wis base<br/>\n&gt; casters will be required to provide enought supplies to last the whole<br/>\n&gt; gang. Nicademous, Kenven and Kellendil can help them out by going into<br/>\n&gt; Grobb and I and Sunblade can forage a bit to help out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Spell casters, please remember to get 100 each of your spell<br/>\n&gt; components. 200+ for pet reagents to be KS.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No alpha loot will be in place. Instead, auto split will be turn on,<br/>\n&gt; and 1 person of each group will be delicated to looting everything.<br/>\n&gt; Please report whatever you get to all 3 groups. We will decide by vote<br/>\n&gt; who requires the item the most and hand it to him/her first.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This event will be a 2 day, 3 night event. We will make our way to guk<br/>\n&gt; on Saturday night and fight from Saturday night to National day. When<br/>\n&gt; TV showing fire works, those present will atempt to choing the frogloc<br/>\n&gt; paladin if we gather enough force, and no one is camping the goon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For this act, I have to do some calculation during that time to see if<br/>\n&gt; we can take it on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If this works out, next spot will be Cazic Thule or Najera. Will take<br/>\n&gt; out the whole plan after I get my ideas together.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Synzzz wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Seraph, I can understand how it feels to put all your effort into EQ<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and now face the prospect of losing it all.And since i think you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;&gt; a nice guy/gal (heh) who helps ppl out and all that...i&#39;m willing to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; help you here.
