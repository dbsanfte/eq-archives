I team with a lvl <br/>\n6 dward cleric who is blur sotong, hunting orc.  He keep healing only <br/>\nhimself and let me die.  Die 4 times on a straight row and lost a bar of <br/>\nXP.  I disband and hunt solo.  After play for an hr or so just to recover <br/>\nwhat I lost.  ;(<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone can help me getting a great staff (not worn)? ;)<br/>\nI&#39;m now trying to gather money by hunting small animals/monsters outside <br/>\nFelwithe, quite time consuming, worse is no XP gain, hunt for the sake of <br/>\nloot only and sell.  Earn 4pp so far but spend all on getting a senior <br/>\napprentice robe for mage.  On the other hand, no kakis to team up hunting <br/>\nfor bigger monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe gotta start training a cleric to hunt for money/xp, at least cleric <br/>\ngot melee skill and can stand as a semi-tank, yet can cast some spells ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus (ok call me Zil, heh).</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
