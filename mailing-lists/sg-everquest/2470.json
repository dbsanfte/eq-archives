There are about 8 rangers there that spawn every<br/>\n5 minutes and are exactly level 25. These rangers drop 2 weapons that<br/>\ncan be sold for 15pp there with max cha. Best thing to do is have a dupe<br/>\ncharacter waiting there and fill all your inventory up and drop your<br/>\nbags and relog and sell to the merchant conveniently placed right inside<br/>\nthe hut! ANY high level player around 40-44 can easily wipe out the<br/>\nentire camp because there&#39;s a huge pathing bug there. Seems like lesser<br/>\nfaydark is split into several zones and if you run a few paces towards<br/>\nthe road near the camp the rangers wont follow. Run back toward the hut<br/>\nwait a few and they run back at ya. I have personally seen level 49 pets<br/>\njust walk in there and kill the whole camp with some help from the<br/>\nplayer though, but for parties or weaker level soloer&#39;s using the<br/>\npathing exploit is great way to make money. Just saying the rangers are<br/>\nonly 25, have about 700 hp so if youre high one nuke/dot, harmony, lull,<br/>\netc. can easily destroy the camp. If you got a good strategy worked out<br/>\nyou can milk the camp real nice. Hope I contributed something. Keep up<br/>\nthe good work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ndont know if u all know....to bad i m low lvled</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
