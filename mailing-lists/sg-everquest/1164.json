From: LKW","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1100382325\">I&#39;m resending this due to popular demand on brewing.<br/>\n(Hey come buy my banded armors lah, support ya friendly guild smithy man!!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust an update of Sereph&#39;s Brewing Guide.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. 1 x Mend requires 1 hops, 1 malt (not barley), 1 yeast, 1 cask<br/>\n2. ? x Short beer requires 1 barley, 1 hops, 1 malt, 1 cask<br/>\n3. 3 x Short ale requires 1 barley, 1 hops, 1 flast of water, 1 cask<br/>\n4. ? x Ogre Swill requires 1 froglok meat, 1 malt, 1 yeast, 1 cask<br/>\n5. 5 x Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew requires 1 Yeast, 1 hops, 1 Barley, 1 Malt, <br/>\n1 Cask<br/>\n<br/>\nAll ingredients (1s7c) except froglok meat and cask can be found on the <br/>\nfemale npc merchant near West FP zone to North FP.  Cask can be found <br/>\ninside tavern (outside bank at North FP) at 3s5c.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestion is to buy at least 20-40 sets of ingredient before you start <br/>\nmaking brews.  This will reduce the zoning time used up in buying <br/>\ningredients (West and North FP).  H/w, Sereph mentioned a brew barrel in <br/>\nWest FP, maybe that&#39;s better in reducing traveling time.  Purchasing time <br/>\ncan also be reduced if you have packpack on you, they are sold at the Monk <br/>\nGuild at 6g4s<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on further experiment last night, seem like we can improve the <br/>\ntraining by abit:<br/>\nSkill 0-40:<br/>\nMake mend. Buy 40 sets of ingredients.<br/>\nDO NOT spend any skill points on brewing if it&#39;s already in your skill list <br/>\n(under Persona Screen).  Just buy the ingredient and start making, your <br/>\nskill will rise to 1.  Seem like for low skill lvl, you skill rise by one <br/>\neverytime you make a mend, whether sucess or fail.<br/>\nSkill 40-65<br/>\nMake short ale, Buy 40 sets of ingredient<br/>\nSkill 66-max<br/>\nMake Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew.  Buy 80 sets of ingredients.<br/>\nMax skill for me is 135 instead of Sereph&#39;s 138.  Seem like the cap is not <br/>\nfixed between 135 and 138.  Maybe race and class play a part here.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce max, continue making Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew.  The profit may not be <br/>\nattractive for high lvl players but it&#39;s definitely good money for low lvl <br/>\nplayers, esp newbies.  The max initially investment of 10pp should be more <br/>\nthan enough to max out skill in 2-3 hrs.  I think rather than giving basic <br/>\nstuffs to newbie kakis, teaching them this skill and contribute 5-8 pp for <br/>\ntheir training shld be more than enough to get them to stand on their own <br/>\nfeet.<br/>\n<br/>\nMillion thx to Sereph for sharing his precious trade skill power-training <br/>\ninfo with us ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus.<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: Latest add-on from Sereph:<br/>\nGypsy Wine: Grapes, Wine yeast, Fire beetle eye, Bottle<br/>\nRed Wine: Grapes, Wine yeast, Foraged berries, Bottle<br/>\nWhite Wine: Grapes, Wine yeast, Foraged fruit, Bottle</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
