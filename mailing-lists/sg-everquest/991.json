Usually, unless i have money to burn, I just<br/>\nbuy the required spells. For me its usually 3 spells per spell circle since<br/>\nmost of the other spells are useless. I only buy the rest of the spells when<br/>\nI&#39;m a circle higher since I like to have a full spellbook ) I don&#39;t really<br/>\nknow about magicians since I never played one, but I think a DD spell and a<br/>\nWater E summoning spell at each circle would be best if yer trying to<br/>\neconomise since u never know when a person is gonna sell a much needed armor<br/>\npiece or weapon. Of course, maybe there are other spells a magician need,<br/>\nbut as I said I don&#39;t know. As for trade, once you get to about level 20, I<br/>\nthink its much more profitable to do dungeons such as Unrest. Each mob there<br/>\nholds 1pp so in a group of 6, getting 20 pp is no problem within about 1-2<br/>\nhours since lotsa mobs there.. Of course trade skills like blacksmithy<br/>\nsurely gonna be damn profitable in long run since can make a few hundred pp<br/>\nin an hour, but thats gonna be a long time before you can start attempting<br/>\non it (heard cost price very high).<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Synzzz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hannibal@...\">hannibal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, July 06, 1999 12:41 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [sg-everquest] Money money money, hehe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Synzzz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hannibal@...\">hannibal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hey Ziltus,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wah lau, don&#39;t make it sound like we&#39;re begging for money leh.<br/>\n&gt;I know I complained i&#39;m broke but i didn&#39;t say I wanted you guys<br/>\n&gt;to give me any :P Donations are always accepted lah of course<br/>\n&gt;but the key thing, i believe, is that I don&#39;t go around hoping for them<br/>\n&gt;or asking you guys for any.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s just that i spent 3 whole nights making 40+ pp from hunting?

I think brewing is a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; very useful trade skill which can easily fulfill ya financial needs, just<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that it&#39;s kinda boring and take times.  Nevertheless comparing with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; hunting, brewing still give me better and faster return than hunting so<br/>\n&gt;&gt; far.  If we can spend 1-3 hrs a day brewing, I dun see why the new chaps<br/>\n&gt;&gt; cant do the same ;)  No doubt we try to help by sponsoring abit, but u<br/>\n&gt;guys<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have to help us to help yaself sometimes ;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; One thing for sure, we the local kakis always keep items which we think<br/>\n&gt;&gt; other kakis can used (eg I keep cutt ring for newbies, ring mails for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; tanks, garren keep thu robe for me, les keep woven for me etc).  We will<br/>\n&gt;&gt; try to help as and when we can, but one must understand the fact tat<br/>\n&gt;&gt; utimately u r the one playing the game and handling ya own char, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; IMHO, brewing can make some quick buck.  At lvl 10 u shld be able to save<br/>\n&gt;&gt; up to 10pp.  Of coz I know pple will use them to buy stuffs like<br/>\n&gt;&gt; weap/armor/scrolls.  But just ponder - if u spend it on brewing, u can<br/>\n&gt;earn<br/>\n&gt;&gt; even more to buys stuffs, at the same time maxing ya skill.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; At lvl 18 now, I&#39;m still picking up bone chips, rusty weaps, animal<br/>\n </span></blockquote>skins,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; beetle eyes and even rat tooth (7cp) to sell.  FYI I&#39;m a wiz with the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; weakest STR amg all races and I keep SIX bags on me to carry loot.  Many<br/>\n&gt;&gt; times u see me walking between EC and WC while I&#39;m actually running with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 200% overload on me, haha.
