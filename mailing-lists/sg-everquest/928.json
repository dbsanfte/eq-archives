Since I haven&#39;t reach lvl 20, I can&#39;t comments on <br/>\nmonsters higher than that.  So far I haven&#39;t meet any mobs that can see me <br/>\nwith invis.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally talking, ooc, etc wont reveal yaself.  But if u try to loot, <br/>\ninspect others, cast spells or attack, you will reveal yaself.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>\ngive any AC bonus, only give u the ability to remain invisible to others.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for CB, I mean soloing.  If u can find a full group with tanks and <br/>\nhealers, u shld be able to survive quite well in the CB camp, but not in <br/>\nthe CB dungeon, due to the higher lvl mobs like dvinn, emperor etc.  I ever <br/>\ngroup with a team of 1 warrior, 1 ranger, 1 cleric, 1 wiz, 1 magi when I&#39;m <br/>\nlvl 5 and 6, we did quite well in CB camp.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, maybe u wanna consider coming to FP when u reach lvl 8 and buy the new <br/>\nscrolls, coz most of the kakis r in FP and we can help one another better. <br/>\n I just met a high elf friend last night, who is 2 lvl above me when I <br/>\nleave for FP, now she is 4 lvl below me.  FP basically got more monsters to <br/>\nhunt, better xp and loot too.  Most imptly all our kakis are there, dun <br/>\nhave to worry abt been bullied, hehehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, 01 July, 1999 10:10 PM, Synzzz [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hannibal@...\">hannibal@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Synzzz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hannibal@...\">hannibal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi LKW aka Ziltus!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One question i really want answered: Does invisiblity really keep you <br/>\n </span></blockquote>unseen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to monsters?<br/>\n&gt; Like if i don&#39;t attack them..they won&#39;t see me?
