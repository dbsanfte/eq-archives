Funny is that IT<br/>\n&gt; IS a guided<br/>\n&gt; &gt; missile! ;)  Maybe it is lag, but last night, when Fesse and I were<br/>\n&gt; kiting the qeynos<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guard, I can hit the guard with my cinder bolt even he is behind me!  The<br/>\n&gt; only thing u<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have to make sure is that there is nothing blocking on the way.  With the<br/>\n&gt; shock, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mob should stand within your view else it will failed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Guided mean u can cast on a mob behind u wor.  I thot for bolt to be<br/>\n&gt; effective, u must at least see the mob on ya screen (no need exactly<br/>\n&gt; center)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have found something quite interesting here.  Just yesterday, I got the<br/>\n&gt; staff of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Writhing when I was in HH.  Once I tried to melee the pickclaw, they will<br/>\n&gt; come to me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instead of my partners.  This may either due to 1)  the - CHA effect that<br/>\n&gt; makes u most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hated 2) u hit the mob too hard together with your staff and DD.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If the chaotic effect goes off, it&#39;s 48dam, on top of ya melee dam.  Maybe<br/>\n&gt; the total dam of ya 1st strike is more the tank&#39;s, tat&#39;s why it goes to u.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The real problem is most high lvl hunting place is dungeon where a magi<br/>\n&gt; is not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; welcomed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As long as u dun summon pet or summon but command ya pet properly, I guess<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s still good to have a magi ard to finish those fleeing mob.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
