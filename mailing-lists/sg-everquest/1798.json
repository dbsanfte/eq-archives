However, I really think it is<br/>\n&gt; a good idea.. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for the recruiting procedure, I think there should be at least 3 to 5 ppl in the guild<br/>\n&gt; who say yes to get a new one join.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well... I dun care who is incharge.  The person should devote some of his/her time to<br/>\n&gt; organize killing/auction event.  QHD is too inactive.  Sigh.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For the website, I have a personal website(around 20M) from my ISP that is<br/>\n&gt; untouched.  If u want, I can offer it to u BUT i&#39;m not good at website design.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Sun, 15 Aug 1999 14:14:27 +0800, Sereph wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Sereph &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;General opinion of our SG kakis, whose names shall be hidden, states<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that we, want a SG kaki guild, by next week.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Why?

When was the last time, the guild got together<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to do something? It acts more like a glorified shout channel. Also, when<br/>\n&gt; &gt;we are planning kakis only activities and have to resort to guildsay to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;communicate, random goons might join in, and ruin the experience for us.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;As a result, I propose that we get this thing together and prepare for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the guild formation by Wednesday.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Basically, what I want you to do is answer this question:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Quit QHD and form a local kaki guild, yay or nay?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Then these question if you say yay:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Who should be the goondu in charge?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Who should be the officals for recruiting?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The charter, who is willing to type it?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Website, for the thousand time, anyone can get one ASAP?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Recruting guidlines, think, and give me your opinion.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Start a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;For details on ONElist&#39;s NEW FRIENDS & FAMILY program, go to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best Regards,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tommy Fong<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Transfer your big list to ONElist and earn $500!<br/>\n&gt; For program details, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
