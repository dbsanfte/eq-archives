What is the best combo of this team, average lvl?<br/>\n2. Is the eye pulling method a bannable offence (ie use eye spell to pull <br/>\nPA to zone in).<br/>\n3. Alternatively is to invis all the way to ledge, how siong is it to kill <br/>\nthe 4 SS, guardians and PA?<br/>\n4. Anything to watch out when fighting PA and its kakis?<br/>\n5. I thinking of parking a druid at KK zone in, with max 125 tracking <br/>\nskill, I wonder if he can track PA from zone in or have to swim deeper to <br/>\ntrack?  Is it true that all mobs in KK cannot see invis except guardians <br/>\nand PA?  Is there any safe room near PA where I can invis a druid and park <br/>\nthere to check if PA is up?  If k, then it&#39;s better to track 1st then call <br/>\ngrp than the other way round.<br/>\n<br/>\nThx.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZil.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
