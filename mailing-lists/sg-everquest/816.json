Trust me, even when u<br/>\nreach my lvl, u will still be struggling for $$$). The party consist of<br/>\nGarren (ie me), Ironbuket, Iyenya, Senorn and Phenix. We were lucky that<br/>\nthe first Troll SK we killed had the BBC. That was the end of the good<br/>\npart. Phenix then immediately stole the BBC and refuses to pass over the<br/>\nBBC to me (funny thing was that they agreed to do alpha loot and my name<br/>\nended up as first. But I did said that the group can buy the BBC and<br/>\nI&#39;ll spilt the cash with the group). And when he (ie Phenix) tried to<br/>\nrun out of Befallen, he died. Okie, that would have been end of story.<br/>\nGuy looted group BBC and died on his way out, and loses his stuff. But,<br/>\nwe&#39;re kind hearted enough to help him to get his stuff back. Then his<br/>\nfriend Senorn was given permission to loot his corpse. Okie, letting his<br/>\nfriend Senorn loot the Phenix is almost as good as losing the BBC. They<br/>\nare friends. But, dued to some lag and wierd shit, Senorn dropped his<br/>\nSBH, and lost the BBC too. Now, Iyenya picked up the SBH. Okie, so we<br/>\ngotten the SBH instead of the BBC, well it&#39;s better than nothing. But,<br/>\nwe didn&#39;t sell it. We held on to it and see who claim to lose his SBH.<br/>\nBoth Phenix and Senorn claimed to have dropped the SBH and both claimed<br/>\nthat each other had the BBC. But, why did I choose to believe that<br/>\nPhenix had stolen the BBC (the 2nd time and also con the SBH off Iyenya,<br/>\nwhich is likely to belong to Senorn)? B&#39;cos when I went down to Oasis<br/>\nand asked 1 day later, ppl beside him said that he&#39;s holding a BBC. I<br/>\nstarted to taunt him (PRICK was about the kindest thing I said about<br/>\nhim) and challenged him to a duel which Phenix refused. One thing I&#39;m<br/>\nsaying is that I&#39;ll never ever want to be in a group with Phenix (who<br/>\nstole the group BBC and stole/sold his friend Senorn SBH, which Senorn<br/>\n(a warrior) had to sell off his armor to get another SBH). So if you<br/>\never have to band with Phenix, think again.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nGary Qui Hong Loong<br/>\nTechnical Support Executive<br/>\nPacific Internet Technical Support Department .<br/>\nPacific Internet Limited.<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nPacific Surf : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pacific.net.sg\">http://www.pacific.net.sg</a><br/>\nTechnical Support Helpline : 1800-8723330<br/>\nCustomer Support Helpline : 1800-8725055<br/>\n89 Science Park Drive<br/>\n#04-09/12 The Rutherford<br/>\nSingapore 118261</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
