Even my newbie char can ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-647051476\">After playing my char to lvl 12 in the recent D2 stress test, here are my <br/>\nfindings:<br/>\n1.\tThe game in stress test is easy, far too easy.  Even my newbie char can <br/>\nclear all the dungeon with ease, solve both quests and kill all the bosses. <br/>\n I believe the retailed version will be much tougher.<br/>\n2.\tThe game is far too easy, and this make teaming a redundant choice. <br/>\n Most of the players I&#39;ve teamed with so far (with the intention to enjoy <br/>\nteam work) end up with 2 outcomes:<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t enough xp/items/mobs/bosses to be shared among us.<br/>\nPker(s) reveal his true color in the hunting ground and the game turn to a <br/>\npredator vs prey game.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I do understand pvp is part of the game, like UO, period.  But I <br/>\nbelieve players shld also be given the rights to decide if they wanna play <br/>\na pvp+ or pvp- games, like in EQ.  Unfortunately D2 do not support this <br/>\nconcept.  As a matter of fact, even UO now recognise the need and demand of <br/>\npvp- gameplay and that&#39;s why the recent huge patch has divide UO world into <br/>\n2, a pvp+ world and a pvp- world.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince this concept is not implemented in D2, I guess we can still make it <br/>\ncomes true.  What I&#39;m suggesting now is to form an Singapore D2 <br/>\norganization, (guild, clan, whatever you call it).  The objective is <br/>\nsimple:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.\tFor those who don&#39;t wanna play under the fear of been pk&#39;d, or enjoy <br/>\ncooperative games, this organization will provide you with trust-worthy <br/>\ncompanions which you can hunt safely under a cooperation mode.<br/>\n2.\tFor those who enjoy pk, to ensure you dun get to pk our own pple, and <br/>\nyou can find some trust-worthy companions which will fight on ya side <br/>\n(instead of group with one unknown player to pk others, and when only 2 of <br/>\nyou are left in the game, he turn his blade and stuck it into ya back?).<br/>\n3.\tFor those who wanna enjoy both #1 and #2, we provide you will <br/>\ntrust-worthy companions for cooperative mode, either for mobs hunt or pk <br/>\nhunt ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the guildname, I&#39;m opened to suggestion, subject to one condition, <br/>\nthe name must be easily identified as a S&#39;pore guild so we won&#39;t end up <br/>\nwith a situation fighting our own pple ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyone interested?<br/>\n<br/>\nP/S: This guild for Blizzard client/server b.net mode only (ie chars saved <br/>\nin Blizzard server to avoid cheating) and it&#39;s not a hard-core guild (ie <br/>\nnot the die once die forever mode, I believe someone already set a <br/>\nhard-core guild out there for those interested).</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
