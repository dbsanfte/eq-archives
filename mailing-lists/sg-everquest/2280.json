Najena is a very popular dungeon","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1394494625\">Najena<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an &quot;old&quot; article i saved in my EQ folder of Dungeons.<br/>\nI hope is still relevent, with all em&#39; patches and stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nNajena is a very popular dungeon for characters level 15-30 that is located<br/>\nin the zone of lavastorm. To find Najena you can take a right upon entering<br/>\nlavastorm and follow the mountains. You will see the<br/>\nNajena ruins in the distance. Najena is a spooky dungeon filled with a green<br/>\nfog throughout.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe entrance area is not too easy you will find greater skeletons and ogre<br/>\nguards that range in the 15ish level range. Deeper in you will find elements<br/>\nand tentacle terrors. The first few rooms are the ones most<br/>\noften occupied by characters level 15-20. There are two other areas in the<br/>\ndungeon however for characters of higher levels. They must be visited in<br/>\norder.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first area is a secret room that will be to the left down on of the<br/>\nhallways. This room lies behind an illusionary wall that you can walk right<br/>\nthrough. From this room you will see two passages. The door to the<br/>\nleft of here leads to some level 20ish skeletons. The passage downstairs<br/>\nleads to the meat of this portion of the dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will find many necromancers and ogre&#39;s down in this area. However the<br/>\nprized opponents in this area are Bonecrusher, the Ogre Captain and the Ogre<br/>\nOfficer.<br/>\n<br/>\nBonecrusher is in a room to the left near the bottom of the stairs. He is in<br/>\na room with 2 necromancers. Bonecrusher is a froglock ghoul who is level 24.<br/>\nHe is sought after for the magic items that he carries. This<br/>\nincludes flesh rings and barbed leather whips.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the right of the bottom of the stairs and down a corridor you will find<br/>\nthe captains room. The captain is a level 27ish mob who is quite deadly. He<br/>\nis guarded by several ogres including an officer who is in the<br/>\nlevel 24-25ish range. The captain carries a key to Rathyl&#39;s room as well as<br/>\nthe occasional ogre maul or large bronze platemail piece of armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe keys you get from the monsters in this area will allow you to go to the<br/>\nreal juicy part of this dungeon: behind the Najena sign. If you continued<br/>\nstraight when entering the dungeon you would undoubtedly<br/>\nhave noticed a Najena sign with some magicians guarding the entrance. Behind<br/>\nthis sign lies the three major spellcasting NPC&#39;s in this zone: Rathyl,<br/>\nDrelzna and Najena.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese NPC&#39;s must be visited in that order. Each NPC has the key to the other<br/>\nones chamber as well as having a key out of their chamber(to hand out to<br/>\nparty members). The Drelzna and Najena keys are no<br/>\nrent meaning that if you log out they will dissapear. None of these NPC&#39;s<br/>\nspawn every time and there is an anti camp radius code implemented so that<br/>\nyou cannot simply camp by their lairs. This can be frustrating<br/>\nat first but with a little practice you will be able to learn their<br/>\npatterns.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to get into specifics here as something has to be left to<br/>\nchance(and it would be hard to describe anyway) so i&#39;m just going to roughly<br/>\ndescribe each NPC and an example of what you might find on<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nRathyl is a necromancer who is guarded by several magicians. He is a deadly<br/>\nfoe even after death as his reincarnation will appear and have to be<br/>\ndestroyed all over again! A typical item you might find from<br/>\nRathyl would be a traveller&#39;s backpack.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrelzna is guarded by 2 necromancers. Both the necromancers as well as<br/>\nDrelzna can charm. This may be the toughest fight of them all perhaps even<br/>\ntougher than Najena. One of Drelzna&#39;s prized possessions<br/>\nis the journeyman boots.<br/>\n<br/>\nNajena is guarded by a couple of magicians. Najena is perhaps the rarest of<br/>\nthem all and is the most powerful alone. Drelzna may be a tougher kill but<br/>\nthis is only because of her guards. One of Najena&#39;s prized<br/>\npossessions is the flowing black robe.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy<br/>\n<br/>\nYY<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw. get a map.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;* Singapore EQ Mailing List&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, September 02, 1999 10:10 AM<br/>\nSubject: [sg-everquest] Need info for JBoot camping<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;May I know which mob carry the key to Jboot room?
