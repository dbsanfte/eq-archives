Not sure about it<br/>\ntho, save up for damask if yer don&#39;t like woven.<br/>\nHighpass is mainly gnolls and orcs. Spawn there is good, and if yer the only<br/>\ngroup there, xp moves quite fast too. But its mostly camped out and ya need<br/>\nto be at least 15-16 levels since the orcs are around that level. Gnolls<br/>\ntend to be lower level and lesser too so if yer can try there. As for loot,<br/>\nthe orcs give anywhere from silver to gold and sometimes rusty weapons and<br/>\nringmail armor. Named orc and gnoll will spawn occasionally who will<br/>\nSOMETIMES load Shiny brass halberd and Polished granite tomahawk<br/>\nrespectively. They are about 20+ level i think but mostly, people will camp<br/>\nthere to steal kill them since the weapons fetch quite a good price on the<br/>\nmarket.<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, June 21, 1999 11:27 AM<br/>\nSubject: [sg-everquest] Higpass<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Noticed that the higher lvl guys always visit highpass nowadays.  May I<br/>\n&gt;know where is it?  What monsters (lvl?), loots can be found there?  Thx.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Until now, I still dun get it why armor like woven cost so much higher than<br/>\n&gt;clothes if woven is just 1 AC more than clothe items?  No doubt they r<br/>\n&gt;magical, but does the &#39;magical&#39; feature give extra protection other than<br/>\n&gt;the 1 AC more?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m now looking for a nice pair of earrings, preferably something that can<br/>\n&gt;boost my INT or AGI by at least 2.
