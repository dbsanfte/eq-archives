Of coz, he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kena killed many times and Garren, Wylven and I were the last 3 who stayed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with him to get most of his corpses.  At the end he still claimed he lost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; few pp, dvinn dagger etc which Wylven and Garren were kind enough to pass<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some of their loot to him.  So that was my 1st encounter with this DE wiz<br/>\n&gt; &gt; name Voyesbian.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Over the weekend, he was hunting at HH solo, and attacked some of our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; preys.  But he is too weak to steal from our group of lvl 18-20, and he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mentioned he just wanna hit once to gain faction.  We have no objection<br/>\n&gt; &gt; over this and we also try not to attack his prey.  He gain from lvl 9 to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lvl 13 within the weekend, which is pretty fast.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; H/w, last night while hunting at HH, I noticed he started to steal from our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group.  He no longer nuke once or twice but nuke full force to get the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kill.  FYI he is WAITING for the tanks in the group to hurt mob b4 he start<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to nuke.  I ask him why is he doing such thing to his own guildmate and he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; said he just need 1-3 more kills b4 he log.  The true fact is tat he is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; actually stay longer than that.  He is stealing at HH, and he steal from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from another groups as well.  He steal so ofen that one players from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other guild, Lionessa, started to make noise.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I started to observe how this Voy hunt and at one time I was even accused<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by Lionessa for stealing her kill, while it&#39;s actually Voy who did it (I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just watching with OOM!).  I&#39;m kinda pissed to get such accuse.  Shortly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lionessa page for a GM, and Voy log immediatelywhen GM Glim arrvived<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (guilty I guess).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When GM Glim arrive, I explained to him, and he understand the situation<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which wiz are always accused of stealing kills.  He also understand it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Voy who did the stealing and I&#39;m innocent.  GM Glim then went off shortly.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Later part of the hunt, this Lionessa come over and drop comments saying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she have make few stealers banned by GM since she played EQ for 4 mths.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  WTF?  My problem if she kill too slow?  I wanna stressed again that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; casters in my groups NEVER steal kill, in the sense that we never wait for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other teams to hurt the mobs for 30-40% HP b4 we start to nuke.  Members<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like Ling, Flyingfox, Satoru and myself hunt often but I&#39;m firm to say we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gain xp with our hard work.  When there are groups of lvl 20s steal from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us, we hardly make any noise but to hunt elsewhere, so I can&#39;t understand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; why cry babies like Lionessa make so much noise.  Anyway later Demitry<br/>\n&gt; &gt; suggest to all group members to petition for players harrassment (since her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; words sounded SO threatening, hehe), and well, no GM come, haha.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is just a note to all local kakis to watch out for this member<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Voyesbian.  Not that we are not helpful but I caution all to think twice<br/>\n&gt; &gt; before helping this kinda players.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Our boss Wylven (who is unaware of this incident) made Voyesbian a guild<br/>\n&gt; &gt; officer last weekend, and the thought of sharing an officer post with such<br/>\n&gt; &gt; player make me sick.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ziltus.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; p/s: U guys noticed we got more wiz in guild nowadays?  After me, Les, Sat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (high elf) and Ling (erudite), the rest of the new wiz are all from DE.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Hehe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\n<br/>\nGary Qui Hong Loong<br/>\nTechnical Support Executive<br/>\nPacific Internet Technical Support Department .<br/>\nPacific Internet Limited.<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nPacific Surf : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pacific.net.sg\">http://www.pacific.net.sg</a><br/>\nTechnical Support Helpline : 1800-8723330<br/>\nCustomer Support Helpline : 1800-8725055<br/>\n89 Science Park Drive<br/>\n#04-09/12 The Rutherford<br/>\nSingapore 118261</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
