It was a great place for me as i went up 2 levels from 14 to 16 pretty quickly there. Much thanks<br/>\nSereph for having helped me gain that last bubble to 16 hehe..as a yellow DW Caiman certainly helps with exp.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got killed twice by SGs so far...one spawned on me i think and another was trained by someone running past me. Hell..<br/>\nalmost got killed by a Spectre once too! Lucky i Gated while pet tanked it!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn to spell research...i know it&#39;s gonna be tough road from now on having to research...but i think it&#39;s only<br/>\nsummoning spells right? (i hope!) I don&#39;t mean to be a smart aleck but i think lvl 16 and lvl20 pet spells can be bought<br/>\nbut beyond that..probably unlikely. Dunno about that though..Thanks though to FF and Sereph for having<br/>\ninformed me of the tough road ahead. At least i&#39;ll be mentally prepared..sigh..<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas on practice points though? I&#39;ve saved up about 50 practice points..not sure what to use them for right now.<br/>\nThinking of keeping them for specialization? Hmm..any comments?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been in Oasis for awhile..but i was wondering..which mobs there are good for looting? I need more money..i&#39;m down<br/>\nto only 45 pp now!! Getting poor again. The orcs there any good? Only found one bronze weapon on them so far..but i&#39;ve been<br/>\nperhaps abit cautious in my attacks as i&#39;m still soloing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks once again and Good Hunting!<br/>\n<br/>\nZanderion (lvl 16 mage)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
