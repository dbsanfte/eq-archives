Leshrec is rising lvl fast? well...errr..hehehehe).  So far what <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; did is to attack the moment when the mob spawn, which normally draw the<br/>\n&gt; mob<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to me and turn to a melee + casting battle.  This way is quite ok, but<br/>\n&gt; some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pple at Ro still call me a stealer.  They forget that my down time is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>so<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; long (normally used up at least 80% of my mana and 1-2 bubb of my HP).<br/>\n&gt; For<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this kinda pple I normally scold back or use the ignore command on <br/>\n </span></blockquote>them.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  Those wizs in HH really &quot;aim&#39; nicely and start nuking when the mob hp<br/>\n&gt; drop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by 30-40% (At one time I just sit next to them and observe how they <br/>\n </span></blockquote>hunt).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  Btw the time mob turn to them, the mob only left 10-20% HP.  If I were <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; follow their style, I think I will lvl much faster, coz this method <br/>\n </span></blockquote>means<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; they just nuke 2 times (hurt more than 50%) and let others finish their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kill, and they got less down time and more loot.  H/w, this method also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spoil a wiz reputation and not very nice to do, so I choose the harder<br/>\n&gt; way.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  So for all the new comers out there, pls do not make noise if a wiz is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; using his body to tank and got a kill just becoz he kill faster then u.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Make him frustrated he may change his mind and start &quot;stealing&quot; from <br/>\n </span></blockquote>u,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; hehe.  If u wish to take turns to kill, pls ask when u enter a camp. <br/>\n </span></blockquote> Me<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; personally quite bo chap if those high lvl players just step in and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>start<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; hunting.  My opinion is - if they just step in and hunt, they are <br/>\n </span></blockquote>trying<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; compete for kills, so no need to give way.  I ever come across a necro<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Higher Order of Arcane at lvl 16 (name is Malten), and he spam me for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stealing his kill, simply becoz I nuke and his pet attack same time. <br/>\n </span></blockquote> Of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; coz, my nuking is far more damaging than his little pet, draw the mob <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and he spam all the way.  So irritating that I use the ignore command <br/>\n </span></blockquote>on<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; him, heheh.  Btw, one of the big stealers at HH now is Senear, the lvl <br/>\n </span></blockquote>17<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; wiz, also from Higher Order of Arcane.  He and another guildmate of his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were nuking whole day at HH yesterday.  They steal from groups of lvl<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 18-20+ melee fighters.  In the end the other groups all invite me to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>join<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; theirs becoz they can see I only nuke and dun steal, and my nuking plus<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their melee can take back some kills.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Last piece of advice, if u are camping at certain spot, and a wiz of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>lvl<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 16<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (below lvl 16 we still quite sux, hehe) and above is also camping <br/>\n </span></blockquote>there,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; either ask for rotation or move elsewhere.  A wiz can steal from a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>melee<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; char of 8-10 lvl above him.  No joke.  Even if you are are in a full <br/>\n </span></blockquote>house<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; of melee chars of the same lvl as that wiz, the wiz can still steal, if <br/>\n </span></blockquote>he<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; wants.  So if the newcomers come across this kinda CB players, it&#39;s <br/>\n </span></blockquote>wiser<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; to move on to another camp, coz it&#39;s only waste of time to stay there <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(u<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; are helpnig him to kill only).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Btw, even wiz can be quite guai lan at time, but IMHO the most seah-lan <br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; high lvl enchanter.  Not only they just hunt by charming mobs to kill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; themselves (ie hunt without even using their hands, heh). Make them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; frustrated they can train all the mobs on u, hehe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; FYI, if u hunt around NRo, there is a PvP dwarf name Broughm who like <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; train SG to non-PvP players, I bet this is the only way he can kill <br/>\n </span></blockquote>those<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; non-PvP players.
