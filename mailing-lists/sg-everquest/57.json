(five if you include kick)<br/>\n(All fighter-type)<br/>\n<br/>\nDUAL WIELD: you can wield two weapons at same time<br/>\nagain you do not swing with both weapons all the time...<br/>\nthose with both dual wield and double-attack can attack up to 4 times<br/>\n(5 if you include kick)<br/>\nPaladins would rather concentrate upon hitting ones foe with the ONE weapon<br/>\nyou are holding instead of spreading out ones attention.<br/>\n(only Warrior and Ranger)<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE: combat abilities like KICK, BASH, and SLAM can only be used<br/>\nONE AT A TIME...<br/>\nyou cannot KICK then BASH, then SLAM... no I don&#39;t know why...<br/>\n<br/>\nfor all warrior classes there are a few choices for optimal combat:<br/>\n(for these purposes Rogues and Bards will not be compared)<br/>\n<br/>\n1)1H weapon and Shield<br/>\n(Warrior, Paladin, ShadowKnight)<br/>\nthis includes the use of a 1-handed weapon, and a shield...  attacking once<br/>\nor twice with weapon<br/>\nand bashing with shield.. this combat techniques give the best Armor, but<br/>\nleast damage for all parties.<br/>\n**please note Rangers CAN use shields.. but you will seldom find high-level<br/>\nrangers<br/>\nusing shields as they cannot BASH they can however kick as can warriors... **<br/>\n<br/>\n2)Two 1H weapons<br/>\n(Warrior, Ranger)<br/>\nthis tends to be the most optimal damage solution for warriors above level 15<br/>\nand rangers above level 17 WITH NORMAL STORE_BOUGHT WEAPONS..... without<br/>\nquest weapons, this is the best damage possibility and is argueably the most<br/>\nconsistant damage for any fighter-type<br/>\n<br/>\n3)One 2H weapon<br/>\n(All warrior types)<br/>\nthis tends to do the most damage for each swing.. but to be more effective<br/>\nthan dual wield<br/>\nrequires quest items such as the Bone Bladed Claymore....<br/>\n(my 21st level paladin has hit for up to 74 damage in a combat round with his<br/>\nBBC!!)<br/>\n<br/>\npaladins get the skills for options 1 and 3.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
