Cask can be found<br/>\n&gt;inside tavern (outside bank at North FP) at 3s5c.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Suggestion is to buy at least 20-40 sets of ingredient before you start<br/>\n&gt;making brews.  This will reduce the zoning time used up in buying<br/>\n&gt;ingredients (West and North FP).  H/w, Sereph mentioned a brew barrel in<br/>\n&gt;West FP, maybe that&#39;s better in reducing traveling time.  Purchasing time<br/>\n&gt;can also be reduced if you have packpack on you, they are sold at the Monk<br/>\n&gt;Guild at 6g4s<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Based on further experiment last night, seem like we can improve the<br/>\n&gt;training by abit:<br/>\n&gt;Skill 0-40:<br/>\n&gt;Make mend. Buy 40 sets of ingredients.<br/>\n&gt;DO NOT spend any skill points on brewing if it&#39;s already in your skill list<br/>\n&gt;(under Persona Screen).  Just buy the ingredient and start making, your<br/>\n&gt;skill will rise to 1.  Seem like for low skill lvl, you skill rise by one<br/>\n&gt;everytime you make a mend, whether sucess or fail.<br/>\n&gt;Skill 40-65<br/>\n&gt;Make short ale, Buy 40 sets of ingredient<br/>\n&gt;Skill 66-max<br/>\n&gt;Make Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew.  Buy 80 sets of ingredients.<br/>\n&gt;Max skill for me is 135 instead of Sereph&#39;s 138.  Seem like the cap is not<br/>\n&gt;fixed between 135 and 138.  Maybe race and class play a part here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Once max, continue making Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew.  The profit may not be<br/>\n&gt;attractive for high lvl players but it&#39;s definitely good money for low lvl<br/>\n&gt;players, esp newbies.  The max initially investment of 10pp should be more<br/>\n&gt;than enough to max out skill in 2-3 hrs.  I think rather than giving basic<br/>\n&gt;stuffs to newbie kakis, teaching them this skill and contribute 5-8 pp for<br/>\n&gt;their training shld be more than enough to get them to stand on their own<br/>\n&gt;feet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Million thx to Sereph for sharing his precious trade skill power-training<br/>\n&gt;info with us ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ziltus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All prices mentioned above may differ due to ya CHA.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Thursday, June 24, 1999 11:57 PM, Sereph [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Sereph &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; In 2 1/2 hours, I&#39;ve reach the maximum skill level (138, can&#39;t find the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; recipe for harder drinks) and made around 20 plat<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s the steps I followed for those interested. All ingredients can be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; found at West Freeport. The cask in found in inns or tarven. All the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; stuff need to be place in a brew barrel. There&#39;s no need to buy that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; lousy book, just buy the ingredients and the cask.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 1. Make sure you have 5-7plat<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 2. Dump 10 practice points into Brewing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 3. Make Mend till you reach 40 in brewing<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Mend requires:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 1 Hops, 1 Barley, 1 Yeast and a Cask<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; You will make a lost at the time<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 4. At 40, make Ale till you reach 65<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Ale requires:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 1 Barley, 1 Malt, a flask of Water and a Cask<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Lost will be smaller<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 5. At 65, make Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew till max<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew requires:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 1 Yeast, 1 hops, 1 Barley, 1 Malt and A Cask<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; You will make a lost until 80, where you start break even from the sales<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of your drinks to the bar. At 100, you will start to make money.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Will try out pottery tomorrow and tell you people the results I get.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Last of all, thanks Yiyang for that 5 plat donation which fund a large<br/>\n&gt;&gt; part of this &quot;project&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; ONElist has 175,000 e-mail communities from which to choose!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What do fashion and football have in common?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;They both have communities at ONElist.
