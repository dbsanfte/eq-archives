Dun see the word<br/>\n&gt; POKEmon then get SEXited lah.  LOL!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway back to POKEmon. ;P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m now stucked.  ;(  I fight thru&#39; the tunnel that contain moonstone and<br/>\n&gt; fossil.  Becoz my pokemon is near to death, I quickly jump, jump and jump<br/>\n&gt; across all grass to find the next town to get a pokemon center.  After<br/>\n&gt; healing all my pets, I then realised I&#39;m stucked in that town (since I can<br/>\n&gt; only jump down but not up)!  I dun have the CUT HM and I can&#39;t cut across<br/>\n&gt; the tree.  Any idea I can get out of the town?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I got few HMs so far, like watergun (ok Garren dun let ya imagination run<br/>\n&gt; wild again pls, hehe), lighting something etc.  H/w, all my 6 pokemons<br/>\n&gt; already got 3-4 skills.  I dunno which shld to learn the new skills.  I<br/>\n&gt; worry I will find some pokemon more powerful and I will have to switch to<br/>\n&gt; them.  If that&#39;s so, those HM will be wasted.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thx.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Sunday, 26 December, 1999 10:13 PM, Gary Qui Hong Loong<br/>\n&gt; [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Gary Qui Hong Loong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       omg.

His aide is in a building you will meet later, but you need to catch<br/>\n&gt; 20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or more pokemons to get it. The aide is in a room where there are<br/>\n&gt; telescopes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (I think, can&#39;t remember)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. You have to find HM like cut to be able to use it and you must teach<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HM to a pokemon. Cut is on the captain of the ship.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4.Carry 6 always, it doesn&#39;t hurt to carry those extra pokemons just in<br/>\n&gt; case<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the pokemons faint or you need to counter another pokemon.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Water strong against Earth and Fire<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thunder strong against water and flying pokemons but weak against earth<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fire good against ice but weak against water<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Earth good against physical attacks like scratch but weak against water<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Still got some others but I can&#39;t remember, maybe try searching the<br/>\n&gt; web.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5.If you complete finish liao, DON&#39;T use the megaball on anything less<br/>\n&gt; than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a mewtwo, since the megaball is 100% catch. Btw, the blue and red no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; difference in terms of gameplay, except the different pokemons<br/>\n&gt; available and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the rarity of a certain pokemon in an area. The final dungeon also<br/>\n&gt; same,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; except for the yellow version where the final dungeon is different.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Leshrec<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &#39;* Singapore EQ Mailing List&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, December 24, 1999 9:50 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [sg-everquest] Pokemon (Blue) Query<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.
