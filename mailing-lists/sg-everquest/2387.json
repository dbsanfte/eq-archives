So","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1539589547\">As you all know by now, alot of quest artifacts are now NODROP, <br/>\nand that includes the Koalindl Fish Corpse that is so crucial to the <br/>\nGlowing Stein quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the sequence goes like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nFish corpse NODROP (plus some other items) -----&gt; Bartender&#39;s <br/>\nCompendium NODROP in Freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\nBartender&#39;s Compendium NODROP ------&gt; Glowing Stein in Oggok<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, the chain of items is NODROP all the way. This <br/>\nmakes it alot trickier, since the person who eventually goes to <br/>\nOggok (most likely an enchanter or someone with good faction with <br/>\nogres) MUST be the one to loot the fish for it&#39;s corpse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only safe way around this is to again use the mule character <br/>\ntactic, but this time, the person actually doing the quest must be <br/>\nthere, ready to pounce and loot the fish corpse. The corpse will be <br/>\nlootable solely by the person who gets the kill/xp, for the first 2 <br/>\nminutes, after which it becomes free-looting. So all you have to do <br/>\nis wait for 2 minutes... This method has been confirmed through <br/>\ntesting by me, Sereph and Trifrost. Just watch out for other players <br/>\nwaiting for such an oppurtunity as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn alternative method, which has not been tested, and could have <br/>\nmore potential risk, is to group with the mule character who kills <br/>\nthe fish, but stay far far away.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheoretically, because you do not personally initiate combat with <br/>\nthe fish, the guards/clerics/paladins should not KOS you, and you <br/>\nshould not get faction hits. But you should still be able to loot the <br/>\ncorpse since you are in the same group as the killer, so no need to <br/>\nwait for 2 minutes. This method not tested yet...<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all for now I guess...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLove is in the air...<br/>\nGet me a gas mask, quick!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nCya,<br/>\nPraetor<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Praetor@...\">Praetor@...</a><br/>\nICQ 1767778</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
