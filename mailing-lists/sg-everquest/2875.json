They are both my closest <br/>\nbuddies in UO Baja, and have gone thru&#39;s numerous live & death battles with <br/>\nme in my entire UO life.  Both of them are veteran online RPGers, so you <br/>\nguys dun have to worry abt them behaving like a newbie, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are Mistaya (lvl 30? wood elf ranger) and Yura (lvl 9 high-elf <br/>\nenchanter).<br/>\n<br/>\nMistaya is playing in US time zone, so for those US players, if you are <br/>\ntraining ya twink at ya timezone, do consider her as a team member.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nYura is now staying in Australia, and is playing around S&#39;pore time zone. <br/>\n So for S&#39;pore twinks, you know who to ask for hunting ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of them are mature players, so you know you can count on them at all <br/>\ntimes.  Pls be nice to them if u happen to meet them online, thx.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Mistaya is playing in US timezone, she might be better off joining US <br/>\nguild.  Yura, on the other hand, play in our timezone.  Maybe some of u can <br/>\nteam with her and find out more abt her.  I really wish to invite her to <br/>\nthe guild and I know she will contribute well in EQ, just like my UO guild <br/>\nin Baja.<br/>\n<br/>\nThx.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
