Ziltus Planeswalker ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nCan I check with u guys, if I stop payment for my EQ acct, will Verant <br/>\ndelete my chars?  I&#39;ve not been playing EQ for almost 1/2 yr and was paying <br/>\nU$9.95 every month.  With the new land coming up in UO, I intend to <br/>\nre-activate my 2nd UO acct (more chars to own house) and stop paying for my <br/>\nEQ acct.  Say if Verant dun allow me to stop pym (provided I wanna keep my <br/>\nchars), how much can I sell my wiz acct in EQ (with the best enchanter <br/>\njewelries for wiz, Jboot, robe and staff etc)?<br/>\n<br/>\nThx.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
