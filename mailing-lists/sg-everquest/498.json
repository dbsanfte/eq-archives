This is becoz too many pple wanna get the<br/>\n&gt; goodies from TSK or Necro but yet wanna enjoy good faction after killing<br/>\n&gt; hundreds of orcs by selecting agnostic (coz it help in improving ya<br/>\n&gt; faction).  Afterall evil classes are made more powerful to compensate their<br/>\n&gt; faction hit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dark Elf alone shld be quite easy to improve faction - Kenven once did it<br/>\n&gt; b4 as a DE warrior, by killing many orcs and he can enter Freeport at lvl 9<br/>\n&gt; I think (but some npc merchants at commonlands still refuse to do biz with<br/>\n&gt; him).  But DEN is more evil, so u will need more time to gain good faction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why not we create a Dark Elves/Trolls evil team, forget abt the good<br/>\n&gt; faction thingy and bash the good races city, hehe.  I read some high lvl<br/>\n&gt; dark elf wizards/shadow knights actually attack Freeport guards in other<br/>\n&gt; servers (no need to find monsters to hunt, lol), sound kewl!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Btw, Leshrec also got a DEN in Prexus server.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mondain<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Monday, June 14, 1999 9:07 AM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy<br/>\n&gt; [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ok... im not sure if its true... ive read up article from either Everlore<br/>\n&gt; or EQVault... or EQ Stratics... in one of the necro guides... it mentioned<br/>\n&gt; no able to choose agnostic fer Dark Elves anymore... wonder if its true...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Fred aka SilverHand.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: Entreri<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Monday, June 14, 1999 9:55 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: [sg-everquest] Something...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   To improve faction,there are 2 ways<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   1.If possible,choose agnostic when choosing ya race...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   2.kill as many orcs as possible<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Entreri<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;   ICQ UIN: 2326860<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Previewer, Singularity Gaming Network<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sg-gaming.net\">http://www.sg-gaming.net</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Your Single Source of Everything Gaming<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   .plan at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=\">http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     From: Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     To: SG-Everquest Mailing List &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Date: Monday, June 14, 1999 8:30 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Subject: [sg-everquest] Something...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     hi all,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     it seems that quite abit had happened over the pass weekend when i<br/>\n&gt; wasnt around...  the party got formed... n stuff like that... n ive readup<br/>\n&gt; abit on the few websites over the weekend... i think in general... the<br/>\n&gt; necromancer has spells that spread over a pretty wide range... from<br/>\n&gt; summoning... to direct damage... to healing... that no one spellcasting<br/>\n&gt; class can provide... however this is with the drawback of faction.... so i<br/>\n&gt; guess my first char in EQ will most likely be a Necromancer... but i havent<br/>\n&gt; decide to make a Erudite or Dark Elf Necro ... most likely Dark Elf... but<br/>\n&gt; i think i need to do more research on faction n stuff like that.... maybe<br/>\n&gt; some of u guys can help me out here... esp Leshrec...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     1. is it that bad that a Dark Elf Necro is KOS in other towns/cities?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     2. how difficult is to be able to better the faction so that one can<br/>\n&gt; enter those cities without KOS? n how can u do it?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     3. what about Eruite Necro?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Pls advice :) although i havent got my EQ here yet... but i would<br/>\n&gt; like to be fully prepared fer it b4 it comes... :) hopefully within this<br/>\n&gt; week... otherwise next... as i can only play during the weekend... BTW...<br/>\n&gt; count me in... in ya guild.... i should be in the same server as u guys...<br/>\n&gt; but i guess i will be progressing slowly... most likely i will be using<br/>\n&gt; SilverHand. :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Also, not sure about Trade Skills... anyone has any advice fer<br/>\n&gt; Necros? Also, u think it will be better to have 1 trade skills on a char<br/>\n&gt; rather than 2? or does it matter? thats all i got fer now...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     cheers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Fred<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     --------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     SC Cheng, Freddy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Mobile-Internet Laboratory, Multimedia Laboratory,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     NTT DoCoMo R&D Center C212,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     3-5, Hikari no Oka, Yokosuka-Shi,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Kanagawa, 239-8536, Japan<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Tel : +81 468-40-3497<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Fax: +81 468-40-3788<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Email : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &lt;&lt; File: ATT00012.htm &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
