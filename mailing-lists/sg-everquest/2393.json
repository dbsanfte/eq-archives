This<br/>\n&gt; makes it alot trickier, since the person who eventually goes to<br/>\n&gt; Oggok (most likely an enchanter or someone with good faction with<br/>\n&gt; ogres) MUST be the one to loot the fish for it&#39;s corpse.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The only safe way around this is to again use the mule character<br/>\n&gt; tactic, but this time, the person actually doing the quest must be<br/>\n&gt; there, ready to pounce and loot the fish corpse. The corpse will be<br/>\n&gt; lootable solely by the person who gets the kill/xp, for the first 2<br/>\n&gt; minutes, after which it becomes free-looting. So all you have to do<br/>\n&gt; is wait for 2 minutes... This method has been confirmed through<br/>\n&gt; testing by me, Sereph and Trifrost. Just watch out for other players<br/>\n&gt; waiting for such an oppurtunity as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; An alternative method, which has not been tested, and could have<br/>\n&gt; more potential risk, is to group with the mule character who kills<br/>\n&gt; the fish, but stay far far away.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Theoretically, because you do not personally initiate combat with<br/>\n&gt; the fish, the guards/clerics/paladins should not KOS you, and you<br/>\n&gt; should not get faction hits. But you should still be able to loot the<br/>\n&gt; corpse since you are in the same group as the killer, so no need to<br/>\n&gt; wait for 2 minutes. This method not tested yet...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s all for now I guess...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Love is in the air...<br/>\n&gt; Get me a gas mask, quick!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cya,<br/>\n&gt; Praetor<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Praetor@...\">Praetor@...</a><br/>\n&gt; ICQ 1767778<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!
