His aide is in a building you will meet later, but you need to catch 20<br/>\n&gt; or more pokemons to get it. The aide is in a room where there are telescopes<br/>\n&gt; (I think, can&#39;t remember)<br/>\n&gt; 2. You have to find HM like cut to be able to use it and you must teach the<br/>\n&gt; HM to a pokemon. Cut is on the captain of the ship.<br/>\n&gt; 4.Carry 6 always, it doesn&#39;t hurt to carry those extra pokemons just in case<br/>\n&gt; the pokemons faint or you need to counter another pokemon.<br/>\n&gt; Water strong against Earth and Fire<br/>\n&gt; Thunder strong against water and flying pokemons but weak against earth<br/>\n&gt; Fire good against ice but weak against water<br/>\n&gt; Earth good against physical attacks like scratch but weak against water<br/>\n&gt; Still got some others but I can&#39;t remember, maybe try searching the web.<br/>\n&gt; 5.If you complete finish liao, DON&#39;T use the megaball on anything less than<br/>\n&gt; a mewtwo, since the megaball is 100% catch. Btw, the blue and red no<br/>\n&gt; difference in terms of gameplay, except the different pokemons available and<br/>\n&gt; the rarity of a certain pokemon in an area. The final dungeon also same,<br/>\n&gt; except for the yellow version where the final dungeon is different.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Leshrec<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;* Singapore EQ Mailing List&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, December 24, 1999 9:50 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [sg-everquest] Pokemon (Blue) Query<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1.
