Ask a kakis to create a mule, u team with kakis mule.<br/>\n2. Kakis do and kill fish while u stay on land.<br/>\n3. Once kakis kills fish, u jump in to loot (u can loot immediately since u <br/>\n2 r grp&#39;d).<br/>\n4. U will not get faction hit coz u did not involved in the fight and stay <br/>\na distant from the battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote than some pple say they got faction msg sometime even they didnt <br/>\ninvolve in the fight, which is TRUE coz it happened to me b4.  The reason <br/>\nbehind is bcoz u r the PRIMARY target the mob intend to attack in the 1st <br/>\nplace and someone pull from u b4 it hit u.  In this case, you are consider <br/>\n&#39;involved&#39; in the fight and get faction hit ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nStein price is dropping, since it&#39;s still quite easy to do it (just like <br/>\nFBR, seem like it&#39;s so common to see any tom, dick and harry caster owning <br/>\nthis 2).  I suggest all quickly lvl to 40 and go hunt ROO b4 the value drop <br/>\nlike FBR :)  At least it&#39;s a sure spawn, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, 16 September, 1999 4:39 PM, Ebon Praetor <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kelc@...\">kelc@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Ebon Praetor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kelc@...\">kelc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As you all know by now, alot of quest artifacts are now NODROP,<br/>\n&gt; and that includes the Koalindl Fish Corpse that is so crucial to the<br/>\n&gt; Glowing Stein quest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So the sequence goes like this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fish corpse NODROP (plus some other items) -----&gt; Bartender&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Compendium NODROP in Freeport.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bartender&#39;s Compendium NODROP ------&gt; Glowing Stein in Oggok<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As you can see, the chain of items is NODROP all the way. This<br/>\n&gt; makes it alot trickier, since the person who eventually goes to<br/>\n&gt; Oggok (most likely an enchanter or someone with good faction with<br/>\n&gt; ogres) MUST be the one to loot the fish for it&#39;s corpse.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only safe way around this is to again use the mule character<br/>\n&gt; tactic, but this time, the person actually doing the quest must be<br/>\n&gt; there, ready to pounce and loot the fish corpse. The corpse will be<br/>\n&gt; lootable solely by the person who gets the kill/xp, for the first 2<br/>\n&gt; minutes, after which it becomes free-looting. So all you have to do<br/>\n&gt; is wait for 2 minutes... This method has been confirmed through<br/>\n&gt; testing by me, Sereph and Trifrost. Just watch out for other players<br/>\n&gt; waiting for such an oppurtunity as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; An alternative method, which has not been tested, and could have<br/>\n&gt; more potential risk, is to group with the mule character who kills<br/>\n&gt; the fish, but stay far far away.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Theoretically, because you do not personally initiate combat with<br/>\n&gt; the fish, the guards/clerics/paladins should not KOS you, and you<br/>\n&gt; should not get faction hits. But you should still be able to loot the<br/>\n&gt; corpse since you are in the same group as the killer, so no need to<br/>\n&gt; wait for 2 minutes. This method not tested yet...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s all for now I guess...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Love is in the air...<br/>\n&gt; Get me a gas mask, quick!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cya,<br/>\n&gt; Praetor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Praetor@...\">Praetor@...</a><br/>\n&gt; ICQ 1767778<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!
