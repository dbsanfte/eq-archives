This npc drop the <br/>\nTeant Stave which has Root effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeen greedy and impatient, I start by root it and nuke all the way (b4 <br/>\nothers see it and start attacking it and when I get the kill call me Kill <br/>\nStealer...).  Normal teant will die after 500-600 dam nuking but this one, <br/>\nafter nuking for more than 800-1000 dam, is still alive!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I OOM, die die melee with it, and most tu-long is tat it killed me <br/>\nwith less than 3% HP!!!  KNN!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nShld I be more patient and cast Leatherskin (give me 200HP), I would have <br/>\nkilled it instead it killed me, sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeen in SK so many times, this is the 1st time I meet this rare spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a lesson to share with all - be patient and plan, or we are just <br/>\nwasting time looting our corpse.  And remember server down last night?  And <br/>\nhow big SK is?  I die ard 15 min b4 server down and lucky managed to get my <br/>\ncorpse back before server down (thanks to my sense direction and loc <br/>\nskills), otherwise I cannot sleep ;P<br/>\n<br/>\nNevertheless I still lost half a bubb xp for this fatal mistake I made - <br/>\nanother 2 hrs hunting in HH.  The only good thing is tat, been so moody <br/>\nafter the death, I dun bother to wait for server to come up and play.  In <br/>\nthe end sleep at 11pm plus and wake up this morning FRESH AND ENERGETIC!!! <br/>\n;))<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight gonna power train my wiz to 30 b4 the hunts.  I will be in HH keep <br/>\nwarrior room early, probably b4 8pm, till morning ;)  Die die must lvl!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus Planeswalker<br/>\nStill tu-long over the incident of letting the teant stave &#39;fly&#39; away from <br/>\nhis hands....</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
