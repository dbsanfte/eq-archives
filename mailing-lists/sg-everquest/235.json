This is actually a big bad point for<br/>\n&gt; wiz.  I noticed we wiz have the ability to learn bind wound skill - our<br/>\n&gt; ONLY source of self-healing.  So far I  never train on it as I do not have<br/>\n&gt; much money to spend on bandages (this skill required bandages).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If anyone train on this skill, pls share ya experience:<br/>\n&gt; - What&#39;s the sucessful rate when you start to train in this skill?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    No idea, bascially from my meager xp with it, u will acceralate the healing<br/>\nby 2. eg, when u sit down,u heal at the rate of 2hp per cycle. it will kinda be<br/>\nlike around 3hp per cycle with bind (?). Troll heals 4hp per cycle when<br/>\nsitting. and this bind wound accerating applies only up to 50% of ur hp.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; - At the begining stage, I believe I will fail many times.  May I know if I<br/>\n&gt; fail, what&#39;s the implication?  Does failure means heal less or the bandage<br/>\n&gt; is totally wasted and heal nothing at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    No idea on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; - So far I didnt anyhow use my practice point.  I think I have around<br/>\n&gt; 35points balance at lvl 8.  To minimise the cost of bandage, is it<br/>\n&gt; advisable to throw them all into bind wound skill?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    Uhm, i would advise u to ask an enchanter to summon some bandages for u. at<br/>\n5sp plus a pop it&#39;s too expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Can this bind wound skill heal other than self?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    U can heal others too. Kinda like a medic. heheh<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - What is the healing effect of this skill, does it have a delay time?  Eg<br/>\n&gt; some spells have range damage plus certain points of dam per lvl.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    As for the delay, it&#39;s quite short if I remember it correctly, but u can&#39;t<br/>\nuse it in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - If it&#39;s not advisable to use practice points on this skill (maybe these r<br/>\n&gt; some other skills which is more impt?), how can one rise the skill fast?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    uhm, u could put some points into it. bascially ur other skills will raise<br/>\nthrough constant use.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - Can wiz use this skill while fighting?  Or we must quit for attack mode<br/>\n&gt; to use this skill?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    nope, u need to be staying still for it to work. and get the best effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - What is the lvl ceiling of this skill for wiz?  3+3/lvl (like our melee<br/>\n&gt; skill) or 5+5/lvl (like our magery skill)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    no idea,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thx.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
