Those who can USE the artifact(s) themselves AND are PHYSICALLY involved <br/>\nin the hunting.<br/>\n2. Those who are PHYSICALLY involved in the hunting AND hunt it for their <br/>\nsecondary char.<br/>\n3. Those who are PHYSICALLY involved in the hunting AND hunt it for friend <br/>\nor cash.<br/>\n(NB: Since it&#39;s a lore item, you cannot ask someone who have the artifact <br/>\nto loot on your behalf.  U can only ask someone to hunt on ya behalf <br/>\nPROVIDED they dun need one, as in #3).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dangers:<br/>\n1. JK Skull & RTS r dropped by the gnolls (high sha and emi) at the zone <br/>\nentrance from SK to LR (during the day).  The gnolls, gnoll guards and <br/>\ngnoll shamans lvl below 18 I think, but the shaman will heal the high sha <br/>\nand emi (both ard lvl 20) when we fight, even thou they themselves are con <br/>\ngreen to us and will not be involved in the fight.  I think those below 15, <br/>\nwhen trying to walk thru the camp, will invite a train of 3+4+3=10 gnolls <br/>\non you! ;)<br/>\nThe camp will turn to undead ruins at night, where skeletons, greater <br/>\nmummies (lvl 23-24) and dry bones (lvl 24-25) will haunt the place.  Again, <br/>\nany one below lvl 20 and walk pass the camp may invite a train of undeads <br/>\n;)<br/>\n=&gt;Our plan is to camp near zone and the high lvls will help to kill the <br/>\nmobs and ask those lower lvls to come in to loot.  Of coz, in this case, <br/>\npriority will give to those who phyically involved in the fighting 1st ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Water Crystal Staff<br/>\nIt&#39;s dropped by a OVERPOWERED lvl 24-26 aqua goblin called Webclaw.  Webbie <br/>\ncan found in serveral spots in LR.  Its magical hit VERY HARD and is VERY <br/>\nAGRO in water, and thing get worse if we enagaed it in the water (we get <br/>\ndisturbed more often when casting, and swim slower, if we lose, chances is <br/>\nthat we will get killed and corpse sinks into the deep lake, then corpse <br/>\nseeking and looting session will start).  After much investigation (I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen camping in LR from lvl 20 to 27), I will lead the team to the spawn <br/>\nspot of Webbie, which is the tower isle (extreme end from zone, that mean <br/>\nthere is NO way to flee if we lose UNLESS we bind near zone, gate out and <br/>\nzone).  The plan is to root Webbie (btw it also run VERY fast) the moment <br/>\nit spawn before it run towards shore.  I&#39;ve tried rooting Web in water (I <br/>\nknow other spots it shows its face) but seem like a bug will make it <br/>\ndisappear the moment it is rooted in water (I won&#39;t advise to melee it in <br/>\nwater unless Garren is coming, coz it&#39;s not funny to search for ya corpse <br/>\nin the deep blue lake).<br/>\nThere is 2 concerns regarding the danger for this hunt:<br/>\na. To get to the tower isle, you have to swim across the whole lake. <br/>\n Danger arise when u meet some giant fresh sharks (bigger size than orge) , <br/>\nfrogloks, aqua goblin, water snakes, or worse, Webclaw itself and Froglok <br/>\nPrince (lvl 30 plus, very powerful, con red, and very very agro, out to <br/>\nkill EVERYTHING in lake).  This problem can be overcome by taking a boat <br/>\nfrom gnoll camp to tower isle (but take much longer).<br/>\nb. The spawn spot for Webclaw, UNFORTUNATELY, is also the spawn spot of the <br/>\nFroglok Prince (lvl 30 plus, very powerful and agro) and a deep sea goblin <br/>\npet (lvl 22 to 25 I think).  With FF and me, it&#39;s no big deal taking Web, <br/>\nor even when the pet spawn at the same time.  H/w, SUAY SUAY, if the Prince <br/>\nspawn during the fight or come to us, both of us will be the one to gate <br/>\nfirst, since we will have NO fight versus the Prince ;(<br/>\n<br/>\nThis hunting trip is NOT for anyone below 4th circle (even if we buff u to <br/>\nfull and guard u all time). Unlike the Guk hunt, it&#39;s VERY difficult to <br/>\nfind ya corpse if u died in lake, and chances is that u will lose ya stuffs <br/>\nforever.  To prevent wasting more than half of the time finding/looting <br/>\ncorpses, this trip is STRICTLY for 4th & above circle chars (lvl 12 for <br/>\ncasters, not sure for others) only.  Frankly speaking I believe all kakis <br/>\ngot at least a 4th circle chars, whether primarily or secondary chars. <br/>\n Just dun bring ya newbie char along pls.<br/>\n<br/>\nLAST NOTE:  This is not a XP or $$$ hunting trip.  There will be no hunting <br/>\nof aviak guards etc for xp and coins.  It&#39;s a very task-specific trip - get <br/>\nthe 3 artifacts for those who need them and get out of the place (I can <br/>\ngate to Fay, Tox, NK by then).  Anyone who are impatient while waiting for <br/>\nthe spawn and turn to hunt others will bear their own risk soloing it (lvl <br/>\n20 to 22), coz we will not waste time and mana helping anyone to gain xp <br/>\nthere.  Webclaw spawn and run very fast from tower to shore, maybe within 5 <br/>\nseconds or so, we can&#39;t afford to miss it, given that it&#39;s a rare spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nPREPARATION:  Everyone please get ready AT LEAST 40 foods, 40 drinks and 40 <br/>\nof your spell reagients (if applicable). I&#39;m trying to make it a sharp and <br/>\nsweet fruitful trip, so pls dun come to assembly area then asking for <br/>\nfood/drink etc.  FF can summon 20 bandages each for those who need (thx <br/>\nFF!) but I dun wanna see him wasting time summoning food/drinks unless we <br/>\n really took so long to camp for the stuffs (40 food/drinks can last me 10 <br/>\nhrs hunt I think).  FF and I can actually do all these by ourselves but we <br/>\nhave decided to help all others (esp casters) to get also, so pls do <br/>\neveryone a favor by preparing yourself ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBINDING:  All casters will bind once they zone into LR.  We then move on to <br/>\narena (which many lamers invis inside and KOS whoever that zone in, it&#39;s <br/>\nthe only binding zone in the region, sigh).  FF and I will go in to scout <br/>\nthe entrance to ensure it&#39;s cleared.  We will then take turn to invis <br/>\n(guarding) and binding, asking the others to come in one by one.  Once all <br/>\nbinded, we then go back to gnoll camp and start the hunting.  NO arguement <br/>\non hunting at gnoll camp 1st then bind the non-casters, coz if anyone died, <br/>\nthey will have to run few zones back to LR and it&#39;s a total WASTE of time. <br/>\n Make it an effective and efficient hunt pls!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHUNT PHASE ONE:  Below lvl 20 all sit at zone, above lvl 20s will move in <br/>\nto hunt.  Once we got what we want, we continue to hunt and ask those at <br/>\nzone come in to loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nHUNT PHASE TWO:  We will all move to tower isle.  Once there, all lvl 25 <br/>\nand above will stay at the mid way of the Webclaw running path, all INVIS. <br/>\n We will root and nuke the mob once it spawn and run towards water.  The <br/>\nrest will sit further away to see show and prepare to loot ;)  The lvl 25+ <br/>\nwill camp at a safe distant from the Prince spawn spot. If Prince spawn, <br/>\njust stay invis and let it run to water.  When Web spawn, KILL IT!  If <br/>\nPrince spawn when we fighting Webclaw, all GATE.  Those who cannot gate - <br/>\nMay God bless you ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hunt is scheduled on Friday night (14th August, S&#39;pore/HK time) <br/>\nstarting at 11pm (tentative plan is 3 hrs hunt), interested parties please <br/>\nmeet at the Guard Tower at North Karana (just before the zone to SK, at the <br/>\nbridge).  Those who dunno the way, pls find someone to bring you there.  I <br/>\npersonally will be opening a portal from Felwithe Gate at 10.50pm to NK, <br/>\nyou can tag along my portal if you want ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus Planeswalker<br/>\nOrganizer, Mission WRJ (WCS/RTS/JKS)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
