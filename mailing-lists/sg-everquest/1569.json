Let distribute those stuffs only can be used by those who are <br/>\nphysically involved in the hunt.  I&#39;m merely joking when I say I want those <br/>\nnon-wiz stuffs for sales.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother alternative it to use alpha loot, we sort out how we wanna exchange <br/>\nlater, coz when there is only 1 bard item with 2 bards ard, it&#39;s hard to <br/>\ndecide who to get it ;)  Anyway the magi can summon dimension bag, u can <br/>\nkeep it at weightless, so no problem in carrying loot.  Even for caster, <br/>\nour reagents r only 0.1 stone each, carry 100 only weight 10 stones.  Using <br/>\ndimension bag sure no problem.  But when it come to junk, throw it awat or <br/>\ngive to those who can carry and sell la.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhap we shld find another day get those weightless containers ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: If u LD, the dimension bags and the content will still be there when u <br/>\nrelogin, tested with myself few times.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Friday, 06 August, 1999 6:28 AM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ok, alot of stuff is wanted by everyone, so we better work something out <br/>\n </span></blockquote>becos its obvious that we may (or even maynot) get one of those stuff and <br/>\neveryone wants them. Judging from this, maybe i should just go n work on my <br/>\nlevels instead of getting items since everyone wants so many things... how <br/>\nbout everyone just is able to list ONE item that he really really wants... <br/>\nor several of lesser value... otherwise the trip is gonna turn out to be <br/>\nmore of a nitemare than benefit for us...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nicademous<br/>\n&gt; p/s : i think those that want stuff for their 2nd or 3rd char is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>unfair... bcos theres just too many folks queueing up for the stuff... <br/>\nunless u want to bring ya 2nd or 3rd char along then thats another story. <br/>\nthats wat i think... pls feedback...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------  <br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; SC Cheng, Freddy<br/>\n&gt; Mobile-Internet Laboratory, Multimedia Laboratory,<br/>\n&gt; NTT DoCoMo R&D Center C212,<br/>\n&gt; 3-5, Hikari no Oka, Yokosuka-Shi,<br/>\n&gt; Kanagawa, 239-8536, Japan<br/>\n&gt; Tel : +81 468-40-3497<br/>\n&gt; Fax: +81 468-40-3788<br/>\n&gt; Email : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a><br/>\n&gt;  &lt;&lt; File: ATT00004.html &gt;&gt;  &lt;&lt; File: Cheng, Shan Chieh.vcf &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
