In addition, mind tellling me which trade skills you are persuding? <br/>\n<br/>\n  The reason I asked about trade skills is to reduce the amount of money the whole group needs to spend in the long term before we can get useful stuff like armor from the skills. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Additional Info <br/>\n<br/>\n  Name        Time played              How often         Trade skill <br/>\n  Kelvyn      2pm to 12am, with        Daily, at least   Baking or tailoring <br/>\n              regular breaks in        until school <br/>\n              between                  reopens </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
