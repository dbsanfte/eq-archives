Let me<br/>\neloborate..<br/>\n1. Force shock gets resisted 20-30% of time even on blue mobs.<br/>\n2. Delay for force shock is SIGNIFICANT. Can&#39;t cast it again unlike our<br/>\nother spells.<br/>\n3. In regard to number 2, I have to use flame shock after that which only<br/>\ndoes 110 damage. Adding to the first force shock, its only about 280 damage<br/>\nIF force shock does not get resisted. I believe magicians can do about<br/>\n250-260 damage with 2 of their level 20 spells and no delay like force<br/>\nshock. Its also firebased so seldom gets resisted.<br/>\nI&#39;m not whining about anything, since I like my Tishan&#39;s clash which Stuns<br/>\nopponent for about 5 seconds. Very useful for DVinn mobs which hit for 100+<br/>\ndamage in 2 seconds. I just feel uncomfortable that magicians are doing so<br/>\nmuch damage on their DD spells and they get pets too ) Of course we get<br/>\ntravel spells so thats a Major Plus point for Wizards in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, July 06, 1999 6:25 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [sg-everquest] Solo&#39;ing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s very sad to see Trifrost changing sex, ops, I mean changing class,<br/>\n&gt;hehe.  I&#39;ll missed all the good old days of having free SOWing ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From my personal experience, my hardest days as a wiz is between lvl 6-11.<br/>\n&gt; This is the time where our dd spell sux, our melee sux, we cant steal, we<br/>\n&gt;cant block, we cant melee and has to live like a parasite begging everyone<br/>\n&gt;to let us tag along, haha (loss count of how many times I spaming the zone<br/>\n&gt;shouting for group and no one ever reply).  After lvl 12, we start to pick<br/>\n&gt;up some face with the more &#39;presentable&#39; shock spell, and our market value<br/>\n&gt;incease with lvl 16 lighing shock spell.  I heard at lvl 20, we will start<br/>\n&gt;to get our very 1st mana efficient &#39;mass dd&#39; spell - force shiok, ops I<br/>\n&gt;mean shock, hehe.  Maybe Leshrec can elaborate more on this. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been teaming with a magi and a bard since lvl 8 - Flyingfox and<br/>\n&gt;Deadflower.  DF&#39;s song has save our butts many times but he is now having<br/>\n&gt;his hardest day finding a magical weap to attack mobs tat can only be<br/>\n&gt;hurted by magic means.  His melee is also lossing out when comparing with<br/>\n&gt;paladin/shadowknight/warriors.  For the past 2 night DF has died at least 2<br/>\n&gt;times trying to tank in the group. Fox also start to face a hard time<br/>\n&gt;losing kills to those wiz of similar lvl.   According to Sereph, magi will<br/>\n&gt;have a hard time getting their summoning spells from lvl 16 onwards, necro<br/>\n&gt;from lvl 20+ and wiz from lvl 30+ onwards.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On the other hand I feel I&#39;m playing at the peak of my wiz life so far, coz<br/>\n&gt;with the shieldskin, invis and root, I have no problem travelling and<br/>\n&gt;fighting a mob white or sometime yellow to me.  Of coz, I still need a<br/>\n&gt;group for long term survival, but I start to feel the joy of playing as a<br/>\n&gt;wiz.  I remember the days I whine alot of been a weakling wiz during newbie<br/>\n&gt;time coz I&#39;ve so much problem in both soloing and grouping - very often I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;the first one who died in a group ;)  Now I feel I have to ability to solo<br/>\n&gt;at times when I cant find a good team to join.  (Hopefully I dun have to<br/>\n&gt;whine again at higher lvl, hehe).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I ever mentioned abt an articles I read on UOVault or UOSS abt soloing,<br/>\n&gt;which the author ranking the race/class combo best for soloing in the<br/>\n&gt;following order:<br/>\n&gt;- Troll anything<br/>\n&gt;- Wiz<br/>\n&gt;- Shaman<br/>\n&gt;- Dwarven Cleric<br/>\n&gt;- Monk<br/>\n&gt;He also mentioned monk, been the lowest in soloing order, will ultimately<br/>\n&gt;become the easiest to solo above lvl 30.  Dunno if this is still true, but<br/>\n&gt;I just hope wiz remains to be a possible choice for soloing at high lvl.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Last night there is a big stealing party at HH.  90% of the participants<br/>\n&gt;are pure casters, and melee chars all have to stand aside, hehe.  Even<br/>\n&gt;combining Ling (lvl 18 wiz), Fox (lvl 17 magi) and I, we only have a 50%<br/>\n&gt;successful rate in getting a kill (well we are competing with lvl 20s<br/>\n&gt;there).  Frankly speaking if thing con&#39;t to stay on like tat, I would<br/>\n&gt;rather hunt at oasis orc camp, thou the loot is much more lousy and<br/>\n&gt;inconvenient due to the wulu wulu location.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Come to think of it, I dun think TF is taking too long lvling his shaman,<br/>\n&gt;coz he has MIA for quite a while.  If he find it too long, then he shld<br/>\n&gt;compare me and Les - which I&#39;m at one time 6 to 7 lvl lag behind him coz of<br/>\n&gt;house shifting - dun forget Les is also training his necro while I only<br/>\n&gt;focusing on 1 char.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;No doubt a magi can solo well, coz he&#39;s like a provisional shop keeper with<br/>\n&gt;most of the stuffs avilable at his summoning.  H/w, I think we have to<br/>\n&gt;consider 2 sides of soloing - roleplaying aspect and realplaying aspect.<br/>\n&gt;As a magi, u can have all the supplies at a wave of ya hand, but when it<br/>\n&gt;come to hunting and lvling, you still need somone to tank, someone to nuke<br/>\n&gt;for u.  A soloing magi will get no where at high lvl, coz wiz will steal<br/>\n&gt;from u, tankers can last longer than u, and worse, half of ya XP goes to ya<br/>\n&gt;pet!  So I will consider magi a very good choice for roleplaying but not<br/>\n&gt;REALplaying.  I guess necro is a better choice for REALplaying, since they<br/>\n&gt;can dot and drain hp (ie heal).  Magi is next to enchanter when coming to<br/>\n&gt;&#39;group&#39; caster.  I&#39;ve nothing against it, but hope TF can consider the l/t<br/>\n&gt;implication instead of just current situation.  Yes, the 1st lvl 8 I met in<br/>\n&gt;Prexus is a magi and a necro, who guard the Kobold camp whole day with<br/>\n&gt;their pets.  But imagine like a place like HH pass, ya guarding pet only<br/>\n&gt;provide a tank for those nukers - which they use ya pet to tank them while<br/>\n&gt;they laughing behind, nuking and stealing ya kill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;EQ is a group game, personally I dun think any of the char I mentioned<br/>\n&gt;above is a good soloing choice.  At most they can only be a good PART-TIME<br/>\n&gt;soloer, where u can still do a bit soloing when you dun feel like teaming<br/>\n&gt;with others sometime (err who knows?  some gals are in bad mood certain<br/>\n&gt;time of the month, hehe).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At least we have a big pool of local kakis which we can rely and dependent<br/>\n&gt;on, trusty worthy as well.  I used to vioce out the loot order when I join<br/>\n&gt;other groups as a newbie, but now I prefer free loot coz I knew I can trust<br/>\n&gt;our own kakis to bahave themselves.  With all of us under the same guild, I<br/>\n&gt;dun think we will encounter much problem getting a descent group using the<br/>\n&gt;guildsay.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As for the backward trick, it&#39;s not working for casters.  Once we lose a<br/>\n&gt;lvl, we lose the mana, which reduce our casting ability.  Losing a lvl at<br/>\n&gt;those critical lvl where we gain new spells will disable us to cast the new<br/>\n&gt;spells, even if I&#39;ve memo it (already try it, not on purpose but I always<br/>\n&gt;seem to die the moment I gain the lvl to cast new spells, hehe).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I agreed with YY abt sometime we tends to slow down abit when grouping.<br/>\n&gt; When I gain my last bubb of xp at lvl 18, I only need an hr, where I took<br/>\n&gt;whole Sunday grouping with others to gain 4 bubb, and mind u, I&#39;m playing<br/>\n&gt;the &#39;legal&#39; nuking for my last bubb of xp. The worse time-vs-xp rate is<br/>\n&gt;when I team with DF (ok, just for elaborate purpose), I&#39;m basically nuking<br/>\n&gt;95% of the time while he stand nearby singing song.  I won&#39;t blame him coz<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s really very diifficult for him to assist in kill the mobs.  1st most<br/>\n&gt;of the mobs are red to him, 2nd he dun have a good weap.  H/w, I still<br/>\n&gt;enjoy sharing xp with him coz I enjoy his company.  Of coz I can simply act<br/>\n&gt;blur and solo, coz it dun really make much different for me, but DF has do<br/>\n&gt;me a big favor during my newbie time and I really dun mind sharing my xp<br/>\n&gt;with him.  I think this is the other element which we will come across when<br/>\n&gt;playing EQ - friendship.<br/>\n&gt;DF ever to come all the way from Felwithe to escort me to get my corpse<br/>\n&gt;from mino cave and lead me back to Felwithe during my 1st trip to<br/>\n&gt;Steamfont.  He was killed at lesser Faydark when we meet with a train of<br/>\n&gt;orcs half way thru the journey.  If u guys hunt with him often, u will<br/>\n&gt;notice DF always LD at night, and given the fact that he almost logout that<br/>\n&gt;night and change him mind after getting my seek help msg, I will never<br/>\n&gt;forget his kindness.  That&#39;s why until now I will try my very best to help<br/>\n&gt;him, and hopefully contribute back to those who ever help me (Leshrec,<br/>\n&gt;Garren, YY etc).  OPs, side track more than YY liao, pai seh, hahaha.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;YY, let organise a Paw/Permfrost trip tonight if HH is flooded with<br/>\n&gt;stealers again? I&#39;m the first one who is more than willing to follow.  I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;been begging around for pple to bring me to Paw, heard too much of the<br/>\n&gt;goodies there, yet fairly safe for group hunting.  I propose we form 2<br/>\n&gt;groups there -the higher lvls protect and help the lower lvls to get some<br/>\n&gt;descent equipments.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Someone train a damn SOWer pls, hahahahahahah ;-?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Tuesday, 06 July, 1999 4:58 PM, Alex [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leealex@...\">leealex@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Alex&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leealex@...\">leealex@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Today TriFrost just started a magician Char. He finds its takes too long<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Solo-Lvl at 16th for a Shaman. I dont blame him,casters will find it more<br/>\n&gt;&gt; diff to Solo when they get higer lvl. I have read that  monks too will<br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; some diff. when monks reach 25th. it going to be tougher. Con&#39; msg<br/>\n&gt;changes<br/>\n&gt;&gt; again to 2 types of Green, 3-4 types of Blue msg.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; EQ being a Group game will &quot;force&quot; player to be group and team. An &quot;old&quot;<br/>\n&gt;EQ<br/>\n&gt;&gt; monk friend name  &quot;Chien&quot; whom started off the same time as me is now a<br/>\n&gt;Lvl<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 36th monk. He been trying to avoid being &quot;guilded&quot; into a Guild. But now<br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with the &quot;Apo Knights&quot; becos his regualr Kakis r in that Guild and I<br/>\n&gt;noticed<br/>\n&gt;&gt; a slowed down on his lvling , my guess is that so he could &quot;group&quot; with<br/>\n&gt;his<br/>\n&gt;&gt; buddies , partly also is get tougher to lvl as u go higer.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the following parargrah is not about xp lvling is bout soloing and<br/>\n&gt;enjoying<br/>\n&gt;&gt; killin the nasties that u like to kill over and over again. 8-)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I had tried a &quot;back-ward&quot; lvling trick(original idea) to hit nasties that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; cons Green to me at 19th lvl but r Blue at 18th. I max out melee skills<br/>\n&gt;at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 19th on the first bubble. Commited sucide and be killed 3-4 times and go<br/>\n&gt;&gt; back to 18th. I killed the &quot;Blue&quot; nasties easy since my melee is max at<br/>\n&gt;19th<br/>\n&gt;&gt; lvl. The purpose is obviously not for xp or lvls. It for easy money and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; kills. Now i&#39;ve tried this on lvl 20th it didnt work too well since i got<br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; new skill, &quot;Eagle strike&quot; on this lvl. When i backward lvl. I &quot;Lost&quot; that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; new Skill, since  &quot;Eagle Strike&quot; is not avaible for lvl 19.Ok i have side<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Tracked. sorri.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Any suggestions to overcome some of the Soloing problem?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps more informal expeditions and Gatherings need to be organise, not<br/>\n&gt;&gt; only for weekends but any other days.
