I<br/>\nheard before this command is not very good since it will attempt to attack<br/>\nanything that glares threateninly at you or scowls at you, even if the mob<br/>\nhasn&#39;t attack you. Not sure so better try on lower level stuff before you<br/>\nlearn it the hard way...<br/>\n<br/>\nThese commands must be given when quite close to the pet, otherwise the pet<br/>\nwon&#39;t respond. Anyways, gotta be careful when you leave your pet lying<br/>\naround, cause if something attacks it and kill it, it WILL come to you no<br/>\nmatter how far ya are =)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: whirlnuc &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:whirlnuc@...\">whirlnuc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, July 07, 1999 4:38 PM<br/>\nSubject: [sg-everquest] Pet&#39;s commands<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: whirlnuc &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:whirlnuc@...\">whirlnuc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This may sound silly but can any1 tell me about the pets command.
