I&#39;m talking abt those <br/>\nskills which used to be easy to max out initially but later made difficult <br/>\nto do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now we have 2 great guides on brewing and pottery, I think all better <br/>\ntreasure this oppporities and max them out.  Who know EQ may twist the 2 <br/>\nskills later and make them as difficult to train as smithing and make them <br/>\none of the most profitable skills around?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn ever-revoluting online games like EQ and UO, nothing is impossible.  No <br/>\nmatter how easy or difficult to trade as trade skill, I will always try to <br/>\nmaster it when opportunity arises.  I thank Ebon for the great guide on <br/>\npottery, and I will try it on pretty soon.  The only problem I may <br/>\nencounter is where to train pottery within Dfaydark zone?  I&#39;m bind to PF <br/>\nand gate to GF for supplies/unloading.  This is the only place I can go.  I <br/>\nknow FP is a good places to train all skills but meantime I will have to <br/>\nfind means to do it in GF.  Any suggestion where to buy the raw materials & <br/>\nstuffs?  Same for smithing.  I dun seem to find any npc smithing vendors in <br/>\nFelwithe.  How abt the woodelf city?  Jeeze, dun tell me I gotta run all <br/>\nthe way to gnome or dwarf city man!<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\nOn his training path to the Master of all Trades</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
