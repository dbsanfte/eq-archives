However, the down time is too long (Ulir <br/>\nneed 2.5 bubb mana on avaerage, and Ein need 4 bubb mana).  The worst case <br/>\nis I managed to kill Ein with OOM.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsidering the long down time of mediating after taking every Ein, I <br/>\ninvited a lvl 31 driud, helping him to snare Ulir for him to kite.  Then <br/>\nonce he finish Ulir, I will start on Ein.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a pretty good lvling method, as both of us enjoyed fast xp last <br/>\nnight.  Now I would like to invite any lvl 30ish member who can join me for <br/>\ntraining.  I dun mind taking more fraction hits for snaring Ulir, coz the <br/>\nloneliness is really driving me mad, esp when the perverts are not online <br/>\nto spam the guildsay.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother alternative is another lvl 35-40 member, we team and take Ulir and <br/>\nEin together.  Shouldn&#39;t be a problem, this method dun even need kiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, anyone interested?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\nThe lonely kiting pervert in WK<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: My login time will be S&#39;pore time 9pm till 1am.  So guys, I&#39;m coming <br/>\nback for good.  Any spare stuffs pls donate to me lah! ;P</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
