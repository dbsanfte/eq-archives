Of coz, I still need a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; group for long term survival, but I start to feel the joy of playing as a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; wiz.

Dunno if this is still true,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I just hope wiz remains to be a possible choice for soloing at high lvl.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Last night there is a big stealing party at HH.  90% of the participants<br/>\n&gt;&gt; are pure casters, and melee chars all have to stand aside, hehe.  Even<br/>\n&gt;&gt; combining Ling (lvl 18 wiz), Fox (lvl 17 magi) and I, we only have a 50%<br/>\n&gt;&gt; successful rate in getting a kill (well we are competing with lvl 20s<br/>\n&gt;&gt; there).  Frankly speaking if thing con&#39;t to stay on like tat, I would<br/>\n&gt;&gt; rather hunt at oasis orc camp, thou the loot is much more lousy and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; inconvenient due to the wulu wulu location.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Come to think of it, I dun think TF is taking too long lvling his shaman,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; coz he has MIA for quite a while.  If he find it too long, then he shld<br/>\n&gt;&gt; compare me and Les - which I&#39;m at one time 6 to 7 lvl lag behind him coz<br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; house shifting - dun forget Les is also training his necro while I only<br/>\n&gt;&gt; focusing on 1 char.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; No doubt a magi can solo well, coz he&#39;s like a provisional shop keeper<br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; most of the stuffs avilable at his summoning.  H/w, I think we have to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; consider 2 sides of soloing - roleplaying aspect and realplaying aspect.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; As a magi, u can have all the supplies at a wave of ya hand, but when it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; come to hunting and lvling, you still need somone to tank, someone to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>nuke<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; for u.  A soloing magi will get no where at high lvl, coz wiz will steal<br/>\n&gt;&gt; from u, tankers can last longer than u, and worse, half of ya XP goes to<br/>\n&gt;ya<br/>\n&gt;&gt; pet!
