(now i cant unless i get into a group)...<br/>\n    the last time i checked... u r already level 11... *sigh*... everyone that started a new char... or started playing eq have already taken over me :( and zan is already level 15... my god!!! just have to blame myself fer not getting a pc at home... anyway... will try to play more often... n level as fast n steady as i can (i will still prefer to get most of my skills max out)...<br/>\n<br/>\n    one question... i noticed that the 5x5+5 fomula doesnt apply to my combat skills... its more like 10-15 points less than that... also... once i attain another level... my skill starts to increase again... anyone have any idea on this? im trying to max out my piercing/ 1-hand blunt/ 2-hand blunt... with just recent change to 2-h blunt... but i might just settle fer 2... since we wont really be much in melee in later stages of the game...<br/>\n<br/>\n    so whats the new plan? Kellindel... if u guys get too far ahead... then i guess i wont be able to group with u guys... but off course u guys can watch my back when we hunt together in east commons :)<br/>\n<br/>\n    thast all fer now...<br/>\n    Nic<br/>\n      ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n      From: Entreri <br/>\n      To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n      Sent: Monday, July 12, 1999 10:26 PM<br/>\n      Subject: [sg-everquest] Crushbone Quests<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Hi again,<br/>\n      Ive heard from some players that theres a banded orc vest quest in Crushbone.How do I get the quest and what is the min level for it?Im 7/1/2..heh..near 8 lah!<br/>\n       <br/>\n      Being hanging out with kalandra aka runewaver for awhile..oei where are u katorak! ;) Any others on Faydwer to join us?Freddy,u can only play on SAT right?I hope I can reach 9[get spells] by Sat then I will come over to fp to join u!Cya there1<br/>\n       <br/>\n      And abt the previous mail abt tentacle whip?Is it good to pair up with a combine longsword..been dreaming and drooling over that ;P<br/>\n       <br/>\n      Kellindel 7th Circle Ranger<br/>\n       <br/>\n      Entreri<br/>\n       <br/>\n      Email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a><br/>\n      ICQ UIN: 2326860<br/>\n      Previewer, Singularity Gaming Network<br/>\n      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sg-gaming.net\">http://www.sg-gaming.net</a><br/>\n      Your Single Source of Everything Gaming<br/>\n       <br/>\n      .plan at<br/>\n      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=\">http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
