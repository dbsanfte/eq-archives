Thou&#39; it&#39;s a very <br/>\nsmall file but it&#39;s not my habit to send attached files over mailing list <br/>\n(scare kena whacked).  Those who are interested can d/l them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw now I really regret allocating 20 points on my STR, and the remaining <br/>\non STA and INT, sigh.<br/>\nIf I have an opportunity restart a char, I will still play a wiz, but for <br/>\nrace, I will either choose:<br/>\n1. Human<br/>\nDump max point into INT, the rest to DEX.  Since all other stats are quite <br/>\nbalance, I will buy all INT jewelries to boost my INT further.  With no xp <br/>\npenalty, shld be able to lvl quite fast.  The night vision problem can be <br/>\nsolved using lightglobe (lvl 1 spell) or light bank (lvl 16 spell).<br/>\nOR<br/>\n2. Erudite<br/>\nDump max point into INT, the rest to DEX.  Thou&#39; got more INT, but also got <br/>\n10% xp penalty, kinda offset as compared to human.  Night vision thingy <br/>\napplies.  This race is the best option for ultimate killer-nuker at lvl 50, <br/>\nhehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf coz, if I dun mind the look and short sight, I can select gnome for <br/>\npower play - best choice for solo caster in my opinion, due to the high <br/>\nINT, DEX and AGI.<br/>\n<br/>\nDark Elf is out of question since i dun really like to role-play as an evil <br/>\nrace, where in RL or in game, unless the power-play capability is worth <br/>\nbeen a evil char ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, anyone ever think of playing in the race war server? Heheh OK OK, dun <br/>\nthrow parang first lah.  I&#39;m only asking, hehe.  Read quite a few articles <br/>\nin the net on the coming race war server (eg analysing which group is more <br/>\nor less powerful), sound pretty fun and have lot of role-play elements. <br/>\n One thing for sure, it&#39;s gonna be a VERY difficult server to survive <br/>\n(since u will be KOS in many places), hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
