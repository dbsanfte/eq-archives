However, I am loyal only to Innoruuk himself<br/>\nand for that, I say HAIL INNORUUK. Seeing the humans die shall always be my<br/>\njoy, however i always welcome another ally in Evil.-----&gt;Mondain )<br/>\nooc Although the gnomish necro has the best stats, I chose dark elf after<br/>\nseeing a fully equipped Tier&#39;dal necro wearing full Gossmer armor, not sure<br/>\nof the spelling who looked really nice . I saw many gnomish warriors wear<br/>\narmor and they look kinda stumpy hehe.<br/>\nbtw, the human guards in commons won&#39;t attack, neither do the guards in<br/>\nfreeport, they are evil. I got a dubious con on most of them, but those with<br/>\nSIR, u better watch out. They are the self proclaimed paladins and are fools<br/>\nimho. Innkeepers in commons are KOS to us tho, so if u plan on coming<br/>\ncommons, don&#39;t go near them. They are better martial arts expert than the<br/>\nguards.<br/>\nAny yes, if possible i would like to wipe out a goody town when i&#39;m very<br/>\nhigh level. imagine seeing the bodies of those pale skin beings lying on the<br/>\nfloor in a bloody heap.

Somehow I agree coz seem like I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;nothing much to do other than blasting monsters in EQ, hehe.   Dunno how<br/>\n&gt;long can this &#39;blasting&#39; will last me in EQ ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Btw, I&#39;m having a hard time in Steamfont Mountain after my wiz achieve lvl<br/>\n&gt;5 via soloing, AGAIN.  As in Felwithe, I&#39;m having a hard time finding a<br/>\n&gt;good team to gain XP to higher lvl. 90% of the team I mixed so far sux -<br/>\n&gt;some members even disband and flee when a train of monsters killed our<br/>\n&gt;tanks and rushed towards the casters, LOL. (Oh remember the name David,<br/>\n&gt;this guy looted everything in group hunting and said &quot;who loot also nimnd&quot;,<br/>\n&gt;hehe, and he is always the first one who disband and flee when danger arise<br/>\n&gt;- his name disappear in group list not becoz he LD but I personally see him<br/>\n&gt;running off, hehe).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyone make a gnomish char?  Need a buddy badly there ;)  If not, I will<br/>\n&gt;create a TSK or TSH (someone said we need more cleric/shaman chars in<br/>\n&gt;Prexus guild?) and solo all the way - ie make the darkest evil char.  Kinda<br/>\n&gt;sian finding pple to team with.  Been a lawful good char in UO, maybe it &#39;s<br/>\n&gt;time to make a chaotic evil one in EQ, wahahahaha!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Btw, Leshrec, need to check with u.  Regarding ya DEN, do u intend to<br/>\n&gt;role-play evil or intend to &quot;turn over a new leave&quot; (ie improve ya faction<br/>\n&gt;with other races)?  Anyone ever think of building a high lvl EVIL char and<br/>\n&gt;wipe off an npc town? hehehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mondain<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
