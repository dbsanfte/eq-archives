What I did is to hunt orcs in a grp with some kakis, at HH pass. <br/>\n Decent xp and loot, plus the fact tat zone is nearby.  Surviving is more <br/>\nimpt than taking risk for higher xp.  Once died, hrs of effort can be gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nOasis croc is another good place which I heard from others, but didnt do it <br/>\nmyself, mainly due to lousy loot (orc give better loot) and SG roaming ard <br/>\n(suay suay kena hit to death, all effort will be gone again).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Friday, 27 August, 1999 4:19 PM, Ebon Praetor [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kelc@...\">kelc@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Ebon Praetor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kelc@...\">kelc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I need some tips from you guys...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As of now, I am still stuck at Level 17, and going nowhere fast.
