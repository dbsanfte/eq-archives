The whole journey is pretty much Mob free, my bard made it to FP at level 5-6 I think. <br/>\n  And nope, I don&#39;t get on Kali much. My nick there is Garford anyway. I use Sereph ONLY for RPG games <br/>\n<br/>\n  [Useless fact of the day: I never ever played a male character in an RPG game(be it PnP ones or electronic ones), unless I have no choice in the gender and the 2 most used names are Sabella and Sereph in that order] <br/>\n<br/>\n  And hell no, I&#39;m not a castration fanatic. I only castrated Enteri as it took him so long to do a task for me and some people I dislike in not so real life. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Always remember this fact: Sereph is a female name. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sereph, door to door parang saleswoman who won&#39;t take no for an answer. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Synzzz wrote: <br/>\n<br/>\n     Freeport???

You must now make your way over to Freeport for your &quot;parang ceremony&quot; held by me then the trial period where we monitor you.
