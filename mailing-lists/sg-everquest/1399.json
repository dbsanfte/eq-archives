If <br/>\nyou can make him &#39;happy&#39;, he may &#39;fill&#39; you up with those enchanted <br/>\njewelries which he get from his &quot;boyfriend&quot; Kellendil , hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, our hairy chest Trifrost is not a preferred kind, he is the hairy <br/>\nkind, like to touch here touch there.  The only reason for him to follow <br/>\nthe path of shaman is to gain SoW at early lvl, so that his victim can <br/>\nnever escape from his hairy &#39;hands&#39;, haha.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only eception is the aqua gu niang, Sereph, which can sing faster than <br/>\nSoW.  SHe is a BI, her speed song allow her to train anyone SHe like to <br/>\nleave her/his hands on.  Sometime SHe play SM with her parang and has <br/>\nrecord of mis-chop at vital &quot;part&quot; of some players.<br/>\n<br/>\nWatch out!<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus (How straight you wanna be today?)<br/>\n<br/>\np/s:  I think I can go to FP practice smithing tonight.  I will make only <br/>\nbanded gorget since they are the cheapest banded to make - with 2-3pp cost <br/>\neach I think.  If anyone wanna buy cheap medium size banded gorget at cost, <br/>\ngive me a tell tonight around 11pm.
