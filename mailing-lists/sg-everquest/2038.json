Based on my gnome wiz and woodelf druid <br/>\nexperience, one can hit lvl 4 easily in one night training of 3-4hrs at <br/>\nmost.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo where are we having this newbies bashing?  How abt this coming Mon? <br/>\n Everyone make a human char in Qeynos and start hunting fishes? <br/>\n Hahahahahah ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSeem like we have lots of intereting activities, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Friday, 20 August, 1999 2:46 PM, Ebon Praetor [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kelc@...\">kelc@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Ebon Praetor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kelc@...\">kelc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have just read on EQ Enchanters that the Koalindl fish corpse is<br/>\n&gt; now a NODROP item on the test servers!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This means that anyone who wants to complete the quest MUST<br/>\n&gt; take the major faction hits that come with killing the fish! Now that<br/>\n&gt; it is NODROP, no more mule character to take faction hits then<br/>\n&gt; transfer to your main character...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A bit of back ground about the fish... when you kill it, Qeynos<br/>\n&gt; Inhabitants, Barbarians, even RODCET NIFE himself, not just his<br/>\n&gt; clerics, drop faction with you, and because the corpse doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; always load, this means that you might have to kill it several times,<br/>\n&gt; and will quickly become KOS to these factions. (Maybe Rodcet will<br/>\n&gt; throw down lightning bolt to strike thee down? *heh*)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, we had better start camping for that fucking fish with our group<br/>\n&gt; of level 3 mules (fish is level 2 to 3) before they implement the<br/>\n&gt; change on the actual servers! Don&#39;t care when you want to do the<br/>\n&gt; quest, just fucking snatch as many fish corpse from under the<br/>\n&gt; nose of Rodcet first!!!! That is the HARDEST part of the quest!!! We<br/>\n&gt; better get our asses moving before the next patch comes along!!!!<br/>\n&gt; KNN!!!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unless, of course, you all dowan this 7/43 1H blunt wpn that gives<br/>\n&gt; +10INT +5DEX... blah blah that is the Stein of Moggok...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I suggest this... we all create throwaway characters in Qeynos,<br/>\n&gt; level them up to 3 or so, and we group to smack fishes. It should<br/>\n&gt; be fun too, imagine a horde of level 1 &quot;newbies&quot; swarming Qeynos<br/>\n&gt; hunting grounds...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This group must be well planned, however, with a proper mix of<br/>\n&gt; classes to optimise our abilities... and if possible, make all human,<br/>\n&gt; level up faster...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Love is in the air...<br/>\n&gt; Get me a gas mask, quick!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cya,<br/>\n&gt; Praetor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Praetor@...\">Praetor@...</a><br/>\n&gt; ICQ 1767778<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.<br/>\n&gt; Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.<br/>\n&gt; For details, go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
