U can only ask someone to hunt on ya behalf<br/>\n&gt; &gt;PROVIDED they dun need one, as in #3).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The dangers:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;1. JK Skull & RTS r dropped by the gnolls (high sha and emi) at the zone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;entrance from SK to LR (during the day).  The gnolls, gnoll guards and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;gnoll shamans lvl below 18 I think, but the shaman will heal the high <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sha<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;and emi (both ard lvl 20) when we fight, even thou they themselves are <br/>\n </span></blockquote>con<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;green to us and will not be involved in the fight.  I think those below <br/>\n </span></blockquote>15,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;when trying to walk thru the camp, will invite a train of 3+4+3=10 <br/>\n </span></blockquote>gnolls<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;on you! ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The camp will turn to undead ruins at night, where skeletons, greater<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mummies (lvl 23-24) and dry bones (lvl 24-25) will haunt the place. <br/>\n </span></blockquote> Again,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;any one below lvl 20 and walk pass the camp may invite a train of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>undeads<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;=&gt;Our plan is to camp near zone and the high lvls will help to kill the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mobs and ask those lower lvls to come in to loot.  Of coz, in this case,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;priority will give to those who phyically involved in the fighting 1st <br/>\n </span></blockquote>;)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2. Water Crystal Staff<br/>\n&gt; &gt;It&#39;s dropped by a OVERPOWERED lvl 24-26 aqua goblin called Webclaw. <br/>\n </span></blockquote> Webbie<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;can found in serveral spots in LR.  Its magical hit VERY HARD and is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>VERY<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;AGRO in water, and thing get worse if we enagaed it in the water (we get<br/>\n&gt; &gt;disturbed more often when casting, and swim slower, if we lose, chances <br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;that we will get killed and corpse sinks into the deep lake, then corpse<br/>\n&gt; &gt;seeking and looting session will start).  After much investigation (I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt;been camping in LR from lvl 20 to 27), I will lead the team to the spawn<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spot of Webbie, which is the tower isle (extreme end from zone, that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>mean<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;there is NO way to flee if we lose UNLESS we bind near zone, gate out <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;zone).  The plan is to root Webbie (btw it also run VERY fast) the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>moment<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;it spawn before it run towards shore.  I&#39;ve tried rooting Web in water <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;know other spots it shows its face) but seem like a bug will make it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;disappear the moment it is rooted in water (I won&#39;t advise to melee it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;water unless Garren is coming, coz it&#39;s not funny to search for ya <br/>\n </span></blockquote>corpse<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;in the deep blue lake).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;There is 2 concerns regarding the danger for this hunt:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a. To get to the tower isle, you have to swim across the whole lake.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Danger arise when u meet some giant fresh sharks (bigger size than <br/>\n </span></blockquote>orge) ,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;frogloks, aqua goblin, water snakes, or worse, Webclaw itself and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Froglok<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;Prince (lvl 30 plus, very powerful, con red, and very very agro, out to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;kill EVERYTHING in lake).  This problem can be overcome by taking a boat<br/>\n&gt; &gt;from gnoll camp to tower isle (but take much longer).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;b. The spawn spot for Webclaw, UNFORTUNATELY, is also the spawn spot of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;Froglok Prince (lvl 30 plus, very powerful and agro) and a deep sea <br/>\n </span></blockquote>goblin<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;pet (lvl 22 to 25 I think).  With FF and me, it&#39;s no big deal taking <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Web,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;or even when the pet spawn at the same time.  H/w, SUAY SUAY, if the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Prince<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;spawn during the fight or come to us, both of us will be the one to gate<br/>\n&gt; &gt;first, since we will have NO fight versus the Prince ;(<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This hunting trip is NOT for anyone below 4th circle (even if we buff u <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;full and guard u all time). Unlike the Guk hunt, it&#39;s VERY difficult to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;find ya corpse if u died in lake, and chances is that u will lose ya <br/>\n </span></blockquote>stuffs<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;forever.  To prevent wasting more than half of the time finding/looting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;corpses, this trip is STRICTLY for 4th & above circle chars (lvl 12 for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;casters, not sure for others) only.  Frankly speaking I believe all <br/>\n </span></blockquote>kakis<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;got at least a 4th circle chars, whether primarily or secondary chars.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just dun bring ya newbie char along pls.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;LAST NOTE:  This is not a XP or $$$ hunting trip.  There will be no <br/>\n </span></blockquote>hunting<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;of aviak guards etc for xp and coins.  It&#39;s a very task-specific trip - <br/>\n </span></blockquote>get<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;the 3 artifacts for those who need them and get out of the place (I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;gate to Fay, Tox, NK by then).  Anyone who are impatient while waiting <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;the spawn and turn to hunt others will bear their own risk soloing it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(lvl<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;20 to 22), coz we will not waste time and mana helping anyone to gain xp<br/>\n&gt; &gt;there.  Webclaw spawn and run very fast from tower to shore, maybe <br/>\n </span></blockquote>within 5<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;seconds or so, we can&#39;t afford to miss it, given that it&#39;s a rare spawn.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;PREPARATION:  Everyone please get ready AT LEAST 40 foods, 40 drinks and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>40<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;of your spell reagients (if applicable). I&#39;m trying to make it a sharp <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;sweet fruitful trip, so pls dun come to assembly area then asking for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;food/drink etc.  FF can summon 20 bandages each for those who need (thx<br/>\n&gt; &gt;FF!) but I dun wanna see him wasting time summoning food/drinks unless <br/>\n </span></blockquote>we<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; really took so long to camp for the stuffs (40 food/drinks can last me <br/>\n </span></blockquote>10<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;hrs hunt I think).  FF and I can actually do all these by ourselves but <br/>\n </span></blockquote>we<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;have decided to help all others (esp casters) to get also, so pls do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;everyone a favor by preparing yourself ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;BINDING:  All casters will bind once they zone into LR.  We then move on <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;arena (which many lamers invis inside and KOS whoever that zone in, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the only binding zone in the region, sigh).  FF and I will go in to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>scout<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;the entrance to ensure it&#39;s cleared.  We will then take turn to invis<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(guarding) and binding, asking the others to come in one by one.  Once <br/>\n </span></blockquote>all<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;binded, we then go back to gnoll camp and start the hunting.  NO <br/>\n </span></blockquote>arguement<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;on hunting at gnoll camp 1st then bind the non-casters, coz if anyone <br/>\n </span></blockquote>died,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;they will have to run few zones back to LR and it&#39;s a total WASTE of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>time.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Make it an effective and efficient hunt pls!!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;HUNT PHASE ONE:  Below lvl 20 all sit at zone, above lvl 20s will move <br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;to hunt.  Once we got what we want, we continue to hunt and ask those at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;zone come in to loot.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;HUNT PHASE TWO:  We will all move to tower isle.  Once there, all lvl 25<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and above will stay at the mid way of the Webclaw running path, all <br/>\n </span></blockquote>INVIS.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; We will root and nuke the mob once it spawn and run towards water.
