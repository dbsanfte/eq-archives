The following is a description of issues and functionality that <br/>\nhave changed since beta, or will be changed in the future - this also <br/>\nincludes planned new features and/or changes to existing features.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note that the following information takes precedence over <br/>\ninformation that may be included in the EverQuest manual, strategy guide, <br/>\nand other official documents previously released.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease also note that changes or additions are targeted to be implemented <br/>\nshort term unless otherwise indicated, however there is no commitment to a <br/>\nspecific date.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------<br/>\nFuture Development<br/>\n------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nZones<br/>\n<br/>\nThree new areas, tentatively titled, Temple of Solusek Ro, The Hole and <br/>\nPaineel, will be accessable via the Toxxullia Forest on Erudin. The zones <br/>\nwill be free of charge and available via an optional patch. More <br/>\ninformation regarding these new zones will be made available as their <br/>\nrelease date nears.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Temple of Solusek Ro should be on-line and available to our <br/>\ncustomers, free of charge, by mid-October. A release date for The Hole and <br/>\nPaineel has not been set.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGeneral Issues<br/>\n<br/>\nThough a majority of the EverQuest development team&#39;s time has been <br/>\ndedicated to the enhancement of current game play related features, such as <br/>\ndungeon and class tuning and balancing, item/weapon implementation, and <br/>\nspell functionality, we have been able to work on the following.<br/>\n<br/>\n- We are working to make it possible for players to manually organize <br/>\nspells within their spell book.<br/>\n- Level 35+ characters meditating automatically when they sit down - <br/>\nwithout the spell book being brought up.<br/>\n- When a player or NPC speaks in a langauge other than &quot;Common Tongue&quot;, <br/>\ndenoting the langauge being spoken (if their skill in that langauge is high <br/>\nenough) proceeding the text.<br/>\n- The ability for the user to manually adjust their clipping plane (the <br/>\npoint at which the 3D geometry is drawn in) on the fly via an in-game <br/>\nslider bar to not only enhance performance, but to also allow the clipping <br/>\nplane to be moved out much further than it is currently set to.<br/>\n- Approximately 20+ new character animations to be mated with the /text <br/>\nsocials which were recently added last week.<br/>\n- Allowing the ability for guilds to be at war with multiple guilds.<br/>\n- Functionality is being added to allow Enchanters to enchant items.<br/>\n- The ability to send messages to everyone in a players Friend&#39;s List whom <br/>\nare currently on-line.<br/>\n- Adding the option for players to not allow looting before a guild war is <br/>\ninitiated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSpells<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note that Beta was used for testing spells. Some spells did not make <br/>\nthe final cut for release. This is what Beta was used for - testing the <br/>\nviability of spells and their impact upon game balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless noted below, all spells work with their intended effects.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nScheduled Changes<br/>\n<br/>\nDetect Magic: This spell will be replaced with a new spell sometime in the <br/>\nnear future. All players who have purchased this spell will have it <br/>\nautomatically updated into their spell books.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nRemoved<br/>\n<br/>\nWinged Courier<br/>\nUmbral Messenger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
