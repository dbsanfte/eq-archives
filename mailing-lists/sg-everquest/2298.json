No doubts it&#39;s easier to train a char with somebody<br/>\n&gt; &gt; twinking you, but you will lost the fun, the good, the bad, the sad, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fear, the frustration, the joy etc...all the experiences u are supposed to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; encounter when playing this game.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For those twinked chars you come across, most of them has a high-lvl char<br/>\n&gt; &gt; behind supporting.  This means that those players also spend their time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going thru&#39; the newbie stage.  If everything comes so easily, u will soon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lost interest in the game.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Personally I think quite number of those exisitng kakis can easily spare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 10-20pp for a newbie kakis buying a descent set of newbie<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weap/armor/stuffs.  I think with this &#39;twinking&#39;, it&#39;s already good enuff<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to start off training ya char.  On the other hand, sometime it&#39;s best for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; new-comers to spend a week or so, playing a brand new char w/o any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; twinking, to get the feel of the game and decide if it is the class/race<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that you are going for.  If every new comers come into server and suga<br/>\n&gt; suga<br/>\n&gt; &gt; create new char, we help to twink abit, and delete char to re-create<br/>\n&gt; &gt; another one and expect twinking again, then it&#39;s not tat fair to those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; helping.  So it&#39;s always a 2-sided coins ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just like playing RTS game.  If u hack a saved game and play the game by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; building only the more powerful units to rush ya opponents, u will never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; learn the usefulness of other units.  For most of the solo campaign game,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; normally there is 1 or 2 missions where the most powerful unit (which is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; normally slowest) is no longer a useful element in completing the mission.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  At this stage, only those players who really play from scatch will be<br/>\n&gt; able<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to tackle the problems and complete the mission safely.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Some players reached lvl 50 first, some reach lvl 50 later.  Ultimately we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will all be lvl 50s.  Just ask yaself, what kinda lvl 50 u wanna be? ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  FYI there are some lvl 49 players in EQ who even lost their way in South<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Karan, si-bek jiat-lat, hahahah ;P<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I myself is one of those few amg local kakis tat started a char in Prexus<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when it&#39;s first up.  With my wiz experience in Inno, I make a really cool<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wiz char in Prexus.  H/w, dun to the lack of kakis, I find training there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is very boring.  In the end I follow the rest back to Inno.  Now u may<br/>\n&gt; say,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s not tat difficult to find grp members to hunt with, but I must<br/>\n&gt; comment<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that it&#39;s VERY difficult to find TRUST-WORHTY kakis in the game.  Ask<br/>\n&gt; &gt; veteran players like Sereph and Garren, their feeling when someone in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grp looted the camped stuffs, disband and run off? ;)  At least in Inno, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know who I can fight together...to death.  Until now I still remember the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; newbie named David in Prexus, who disband from the team when we striked a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skelly train near Ak&#39;non dragon bone land.  When some of the team members<br/>\n&gt; &gt; asked him why he disband after the battle, he said he was LD, while I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself saw him running to guards with my own eyes ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; p/s: I read form a EQ site that the numbers of casters armors discovered<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only less than 10% of all the casters armors in the game ;)  Just tat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; casters sux in adventuring (we are better in camping) due to train and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; random spawn, we dun discover as many casters stuffs like those tanks out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Friday, 03 September, 1999 2:44 PM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if u r looking to get twinked... i suggest u go prexus...
