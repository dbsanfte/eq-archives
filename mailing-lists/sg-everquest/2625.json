For <br/>\neach piece of armor, you need to do three things. <br/>\n<br/>\n1) You need to get the mold for the item.  You do this by fetching <br/>\nthe quest items and turning them in to the NPC who gives the<br/>\nitem quest.  You need to develop a high faction with the NPC&#39;s <br/>\nGuild before he or she will give you the quest.  You can get the<br/>\nquests immediately from those who view you warmly.  Those who <br/>\nview you amiably will request that you go to their guild and talk<br/>\nto someone there first before getting the quest.  Those below <br/>\namiable will not talk to you.  Below are the people who start the<br/>\nquests and the methods of getting the molds for each item.  All <br/>\nmolds are no drop lore items, so whoever turns in the items must<br/>\nfinish the quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 2 involves making a metal called ronium, and step 3 is to <br/>\ncombine the mould and the metal in a forge.<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe steps seem very complicated, and you need high smithing <br/>\nskill. Not sure if it&#39;s worth it or not....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLove is in the air...<br/>\nGet me a gas mask, quick!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nCya,<br/>\nPraetor<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Praetor@...\">Praetor@...</a><br/>\nICQ 1767778</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
