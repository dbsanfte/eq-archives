Ice crystal staff, found in Permafrost. Fesse pls provide info so we can<br/>\n&gt; go see see look look when camping for runed circlet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3. The deceiver mask (cant remember exact name, turn u to DE).  Dropped by<br/>\n&gt; lower guk assasin.  Anyone got map to the spot? Also how tough is the<br/>\n&gt; assasin?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tDuno, they say need a full group. Guk is very train prone. Me and my<br/>\nfriend (40th Paladin and 41th Ranger) made our way but we can still kana<br/>\ntrain. a Full party trained like 20 of the frogs on to us but we&#39;re<br/>\nclose to zone so heng heng. I want the mask too. heheh.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4. Hidden water tunnel in Paw.  It spawns named mobs.  Mob lvl not high but<br/>\n&gt; was thinking to go there see see look look when too bored in EQ.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 5. Polished bone bracer.  Dropped by what mob, where?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tThe Ogres at WK??? or is it the evil eye at Beholder.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 6. Fesse pls advise me the reasonable price for the following jewelry:<br/>\n&gt; - 7int/7str necklace<br/>\n&gt; - 4int earring (a pair)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 7. Is there any INT bracers out there? Stats? Drop by who and where?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just a feedback, my max dam with less than 30 1HB skill using the staff of<br/>\n&gt; writhing is 19 (melee) + 48 (chaotic effect), ie 67 dam per hit.  At such a<br/>\n&gt; low 1HB skill, the chaotic effect appears like once every 5 fights.  I<br/>\n&gt; still got 30 skill points with me (after dumping 90 skills points and<br/>\n&gt; 200+pp to rise my research skill from zero to 90 odd), wonder if I shld<br/>\n&gt; throw them all into 1HB (since I seldom melee but the skill does help alot<br/>\n&gt; when I try to kill mob for fractions).  Is there any skill a wiz shld look<br/>\n&gt; into at mid-30?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tMelee skill for magis? heheh like I need to be part time monk when I&#39;m<br/>\nnude. 8). Bascially just point 1 point and let it raise on it own,<br/>\nalthough it&#39;s hard to do from scratch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ??
