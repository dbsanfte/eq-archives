Impressive right? And they<br/>\nkeep<br/>\n&gt; going : /shout You better get the hell outta there before train comes blah<br/>\n&gt; blah blah &lt;big talk&gt;. I am powerful etc...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lets take a look after they die in the deep deep dungeons....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; XXX : Errr....couldst any spare me a rusty weapon? Perhaps even some<br/>\n&gt; PatchWork?<br/>\n&gt; They are almost useless without their armour and weapon, when they go to<br/>\n&gt; retrieve their things in Dungeons etc. I doubt those LvL 20+ even get pass<br/>\n&gt; those Elite/Guards Gnolls. That means 300PP worth of things gone?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lets take a look at the Monks now...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mr-I-Wear-Only-Cloth stands alone in the dungeon and dies. But he just<br/>\nneed<br/>\n&gt; some food to get everything going right. The Monks can just fight their<br/>\nway<br/>\n&gt; through to where they died without worries and EASILY. Been there, done<br/>\n&gt; that. And at the same time kick some ass while on their journey. Whereas<br/>\n&gt; those other classes take big detours around monsters to avoid being killed<br/>\n&gt; and trying to retrieve corpse.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, enough of my biase remarks now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wilson aka Yutaka<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Alex &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leealex@...\">leealex@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Why I choose to play a monk ...... &lt;Snip&gt; &lt;Pai seh&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
