We either need more ppl or we need more guild events.<br/>\n    Probably the former.Problem is Ziltus and Leshrec no longer play their wizards. Fesse is also semi retired. <br/>\n    I already have problems finding ppl to group with as it has been last few weeks. Also we dont seem to have<br/>\n    much of an enthusiasm. No offence but i think some things need fixing. Or maybe i&#39;m the only one feeling it hmm...<br/>\n    <br/>\n    Unlike a few guilds i&#39;ve come to know...we really haven&#39;t had much of a union as a guild. Lvls pobably play one<br/>\n    part as it prevents effective guild outings. Other is we seem to have bad luck with any so far hehe.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    I&#39;d like and hope to see something good that can be done for us all...if not maybe one day i might just leave..<br/>\n    no offence i like you guys but i need to be able to have some fun too..it&#39;s hardly fun anymore now for me.<br/>\n    I&#39;ll still be on mailing list if i ever leave and i will still give my best at providing any info that no one might have<br/>\n    or help if i ever can...<br/>\n    <br/>\n    Of course that&#39;s only if i leave (which is unlikely) but i&#39;d thought i just bring it up to you all to be fair...<br/>\n    Thaks for your time<br/>\n    <br/>\n    Zanderion Stormseeker <br/>\n    lvl 36 mage<br/>\n    <br/>\n    and yes double xp penalty for dying after every hell lvl...ARGH!<br/>\n    just found that out when one whole bubble disappeared</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
