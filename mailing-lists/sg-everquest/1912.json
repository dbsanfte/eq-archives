Like my RL friend who just start playing EQ. <br/>\n KNN I spend so much time giving his stuffs and helping him to go here and <br/>\nthere.  Everytime he got killed and cant find corpse, I gotta help him <br/>\nrefill equipment, hehe, until now he more or less settled with a Erudite <br/>\nwiz ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think general case - help to seek corpse can be done by asking in the <br/>\nzone, or any one in guild if they r available to do so.  But when it come <br/>\nto problematic situation, there must be someone in the guild who is <br/>\n&quot;idling&quot; ard and can offer help, esp when we play almost in the same time <br/>\nframe.  Basically I just dun like to see pple abusing such aid.  And first <br/>\nthing 1st, as in many EQ guidelines, it&#39;s better to explore a new place <br/>\nwith some kakis.  Dun suga suga explore some high lvl dungeon which u dun <br/>\neven know if u can handle.  If u r not sure of the hunting spot, at least <br/>\nasking in guidesay or in mailing list, or best, check the net.  With the <br/>\nexisitng kakis, most are ard lvl 20, so shldnt have such problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn ya case when u fall into Befallen&#39;s wall, it shld be ok to seek help <br/>\nfrom guild.  Definitely someone will be there to help, but dun expect all <br/>\nto stop everything they r doing to come, esp those who need to take boats <br/>\nand run 10 zones to reach u ;)  If a newbie just suga suga go najena, <br/>\nhoping to get some good loot by luck, and definitely he cant cope with the <br/>\nmob, then good luck to him.  If someone in guild is available to save him, <br/>\ngood.  If not, I will let this newbie die and learn his lesson ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have to set a general guideline and view ah-hoc case by case.  If <br/>\neverytime there is a SOS and all is expected to go rescue, this kinda guild <br/>\nI also dun wanna join, since been a wiz who is expected to travel easier, <br/>\nI&#39;m to &#39;expected&#39; to be the 1st one to turn up for the rescue ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is once a UO guild member&#39;s younger bro who play UO and always got <br/>\nkilled in the game, and start icqing all to save him.  So much so that in <br/>\nthe end there is one time where no one turn up to help him (not willing or <br/>\nno one online) and he send a mass icq barking at everyone.  All I did is to <br/>\nreply his icq, f**k him upside down and tell him if he dun apologize to all <br/>\nand change his manner, I will ban him out of guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the day, it all depend if individual can think maturely.  If <br/>\nany member cannot learn to be independent and too reliance on others, I <br/>\nwill give no face and f**k him upside. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wednesday, 18 August, 1999 1:32 PM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; my mail already... then your mail even longer.. so i will try not to say<br/>\n&gt; much this time...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ok... swaping equipments between char is one thing... this one u use SOS <br/>\n </span></blockquote>u<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; kenna fucked by all... but imagine like me the last time.. dropped into <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; well of befallen... and no fuckers wanna help... this if SOS sent and no <br/>\n </span></blockquote>one<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; can be bothered... then i dont see the point of the guild... the guild <br/>\n </span></blockquote>shoud<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; be about helping each other (esp when u really need it) and hunting <br/>\n </span></blockquote>together<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; at times... if u wanna swap stuff... thats more of a favor rather than a<br/>\n&gt; SOS... pls differentiate the 2 things! if u have 2 bloody chars... and 1 <br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; high level... then is easy lah... just give consent and let ya other char<br/>\n&gt; come in n loot lor... but if someone seriously needs help... help should <br/>\n </span></blockquote>be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; given...
