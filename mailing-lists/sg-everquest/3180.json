But if you look<br/>\nat AO just prerelease, there were people complaining about the problems with<br/>\nits fundamentals which were shot down by the fanbois then. This just appear<br/>\nto me to be the same thing happening all over again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll i can say is, even if there are problems, even fundamental ones, they<br/>\ncan be fixed, but only within a certain time window (witness the AO 12.6<br/>\ndecable for a good example of exceeding that time window). Only time will<br/>\ntell.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this list does seem very dead.
