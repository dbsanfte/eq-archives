Here&#39;s the quest:<br/>\n<br/>\nThis item is obtainable by completing a quest in the Erudian Mage Guild <br/>\nHouse. What you do is hail Vasile Jahnir and Say &quot;The power of the <br/>\ngatecallers is Summoning&quot;. If you have good faction with the Gatecallers he <br/>\nwill tell you to bring him 2 summoned food and 2 summoned Daggers. Give <br/>\nthese items to him making sure the food is not stacked when you give it to <br/>\nhim. Once you do this, you will receive the gloves. If your faction is not <br/>\nup to par, kill Eliah Brooks (a Necromancer near the docks in Tox Forest, <br/>\nloc +140, +1200).<br/>\n<br/>\nI killed tat necro only 7-8 times b4 I got enudd faction to do the quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, after u get the glove, there is a 2nd quest from the same npc - to <br/>\nkill a lvl 4 or 5 troll at the bridge.  That troll con green to me and will <br/>\ncast blindness (which is useless to us). U will get its head (no drop, no <br/>\nstats) and pass to the npc, u will get a low lvl magi spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith 75 str, I now need the black boot do complete my &quot;Dark Flame&quot; style of <br/>\nblack outfit, hehe.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
