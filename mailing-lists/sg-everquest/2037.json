Now that <br/>\nit is NODROP, no more mule character to take faction hits then <br/>\ntransfer to your main character...<br/>\n<br/>\nA bit of back ground about the fish... when you kill it, Qeynos <br/>\nInhabitants, Barbarians, even RODCET NIFE himself, not just his <br/>\nclerics, drop faction with you, and because the corpse doesn&#39;t <br/>\nalways load, this means that you might have to kill it several times, <br/>\nand will quickly become KOS to these factions. (Maybe Rodcet will <br/>\nthrow down lightning bolt to strike thee down? *heh*)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we had better start camping for that fucking fish with our group <br/>\nof level 3 mules (fish is level 2 to 3) before they implement the <br/>\nchange on the actual servers! Don&#39;t care when you want to do the <br/>\nquest, just fucking snatch as many fish corpse from under the <br/>\nnose of Rodcet first!!!! That is the HARDEST part of the quest!!! We <br/>\nbetter get our asses moving before the next patch comes along!!!! <br/>\nKNN!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless, of course, you all dowan this 7/43 1H blunt wpn that gives <br/>\n+10INT +5DEX... blah blah that is the Stein of Moggok...<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest this... we all create throwaway characters in Qeynos, <br/>\nlevel them up to 3 or so, and we group to smack fishes. It should <br/>\nbe fun too, imagine a horde of level 1 &quot;newbies&quot; swarming Qeynos <br/>\nhunting grounds...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis group must be well planned, however, with a proper mix of <br/>\nclasses to optimise our abilities... and if possible, make all human, <br/>\nlevel up faster...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLove is in the air...<br/>\nGet me a gas mask, quick!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nCya,<br/>\nPraetor<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Praetor@...\">Praetor@...</a><br/>\nICQ 1767778</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
