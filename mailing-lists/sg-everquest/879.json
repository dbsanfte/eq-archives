Cask can be found <br/>\ninside tavern (outside bank at North FP) at 3s5c.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestion is to buy at least 20-40 sets of ingredient before you start <br/>\nmaking brews.  This will reduce the zoning time used up in buying <br/>\ningredients (West and North FP).  H/w, Sereph mentioned a brew barrel in <br/>\nWest FP, maybe that&#39;s better in reducing traveling time.  Purchasing time <br/>\ncan also be reduced if you have packpack on you, they are sold at the Monk <br/>\nGuild at 6g4s<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on further experiment last night, seem like we can improve the <br/>\ntraining by abit:<br/>\nSkill 0-40:<br/>\nMake mend. Buy 40 sets of ingredients.<br/>\nDO NOT spend any skill points on brewing if it&#39;s already in your skill list <br/>\n(under Persona Screen).  Just buy the ingredient and start making, your <br/>\nskill will rise to 1.  Seem like for low skill lvl, you skill rise by one <br/>\neverytime you make a mend, whether sucess or fail.<br/>\nSkill 40-65<br/>\nMake short ale, Buy 40 sets of ingredient<br/>\nSkill 66-max<br/>\nMake Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew.  Buy 80 sets of ingredients.<br/>\nMax skill for me is 135 instead of Sereph&#39;s 138.  Seem like the cap is not <br/>\nfixed between 135 and 138.  Maybe race and class play a part here.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce max, continue making Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew.  The profit may not be <br/>\nattractive for high lvl players but it&#39;s definitely good money for low lvl <br/>\nplayers, esp newbies.  The max initially investment of 10pp should be more <br/>\nthan enough to max out skill in 2-3 hrs.  I think rather than giving basic <br/>\nstuffs to newbie kakis, teaching them this skill and contribute 5-8 pp for <br/>\ntheir training shld be more than enough to get them to stand on their own <br/>\nfeet.<br/>\n<br/>\nMillion thx to Sereph for sharing his precious trade skill power-training <br/>\ninfo with us ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll prices mentioned above may differ due to ya CHA.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, June 24, 1999 11:57 PM, Sereph [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Sereph &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In 2 1/2 hours, I&#39;ve reach the maximum skill level (138, can&#39;t find the<br/>\n&gt; recipe for harder drinks) and made around 20 plat<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s the steps I followed for those interested. All ingredients can be<br/>\n&gt; found at West Freeport. The cask in found in inns or tarven. All the<br/>\n&gt; stuff need to be place in a brew barrel. There&#39;s no need to buy that<br/>\n&gt; lousy book, just buy the ingredients and the cask.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. Make sure you have 5-7plat<br/>\n&gt; 2. Dump 10 practice points into Brewing<br/>\n&gt; 3.
