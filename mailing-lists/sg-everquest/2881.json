She is also those hard-working type who is<br/>\n&gt; willing to spend time in training her chars.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Misty, on the other hand, is a born leader and know how to take care of<br/>\n&gt; those newer members very much (should I say &quot;motherlike&quot;? hehe). She is<br/>\n&gt; also very experience in RPG training and very independent.  She actually<br/>\n&gt; has her RL son, a lvl 40ish monk, and her RL husband, lvl 46 shaman playing<br/>\n&gt; in the same server.  I would like to get all of them in but due to the big<br/>\n&gt; difference in timezone, I leave it to u guys to vote.  Of coz I would love<br/>\n&gt; to get her in, but I also wanan ensure she can contributed and also enjoy<br/>\n&gt; full benefit & fun if she were to join us.  She is also the first female<br/>\n&gt; pioneer in my UO guild and work all the way to her vice-GM position.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Talk abt contribution, I&#39;m very sure both of them will be a great asset to<br/>\n&gt; our guild in time to come ;) So more support pls, thx thx!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Wednesday, 07 June, 2000 4:29 PM, Alex [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leealex@...\">leealex@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Invit him/her lor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; U get my vote.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; BIBI, Handsomes Druid , Anywhere.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &#39;* Singapore EQ Mailing List&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@egroups.com\">sg-everquest@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 07, 2000 11:25 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [sg-everquest] Introducing a new friend ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve 2 UO friends who join us in EQ Innoruuk.  They are both my closest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; buddies in UO Baja, and have gone thru&#39;s numerous live & death battles<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me in my entire UO life.  Both of them are veteran online RPGers, so<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guys dun have to worry abt them behaving like a newbie, hehe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; They are Mistaya (lvl 30? wood elf ranger) and Yura (lvl 9 high-elf<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enchanter).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mistaya is playing in US time zone, so for those US players, if you are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; training ya twink at ya timezone, do consider her as a team member.  ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yura is now staying in Australia, and is playing around S&#39;pore time<br/>\n&gt; zone.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  So for S&#39;pore twinks, you know who to ask for hunting ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Both of them are mature players, so you know you can count on them at<br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; times.  Pls be nice to them if u happen to meet them online, thx.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As Mistaya is playing in US timezone, she might be better off joining<br/>\n&gt; US<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guild.  Yura, on the other hand, play in our timezone.  Maybe some of u<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; team with her and find out more abt her.  I really wish to invite her<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the guild and I know she will contribute well in EQ, just like my UO<br/>\n&gt; guild<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in Baja.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thx.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ziltus.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Remember four years of good friends, bad clothes, explosive chemistry<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiments.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4051/8/_/436545/_/960350449/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4051/8/_/436545/_/960350449/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get your cash there fast.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Use PayPal to send money via email.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sign up today.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/5025/8/_/436545/_/960366249/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/5025/8/_/436545/_/960366249/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
