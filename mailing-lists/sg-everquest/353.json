Lvl 12 means a<br/>\n&gt; big deal to me as it open my knowledge to one of the most important spells<br/>\n&gt; for wizard - bind aff.  If anyone need bind in Freeport, pls feel free to<br/>\n&gt; give me a tell.  Most probably I will stay around FP until I get to lvl 16<br/>\n&gt; which I need to buy need spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Meanwhile, I&#39;ve bought shock of lighting, bind & halo of light spells.<br/>\n&gt;  Leshrec can advise what other impt scrolls I shld buy?  I&#39;m also looking<br/>\n&gt; for a runed totem stave.  I&#39;ve got 15pp in bank right now.  If you guys<br/>\n&gt; know any friend who is willing to sell at 25pp and below, pls let me know<br/>\n&gt; (Leshrec got his at 20pp, very good buy).  Tonight I will con&#39;t to group<br/>\n&gt; our local kakis for more xp and money, hahahahahaahh! ;-?
