How do I go about researching spells.  Do I really need to buy those <br/>\nbooks, in the sense that the books are PART of the ingredients in <br/>\nresearching spells or they are just for info purpose?  If I can find the <br/>\ninfo for the spell from internet I dun need those books right?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. How do I go abt DOING spell research.  Say for wiz I got the runes <br/>\nrequired for a certain spell, how do I go abt &#39;mixing&#39; the runes?  Is there <br/>\nany container I need to find like brewing barrel or forge, put the runes <br/>\ninside and click &#39;COMBINE&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I heard from Leshrec tat we can now put a point on all specialization of <br/>\nmagery skills, ie evoke, adjure, conjure, divin, alter.  That&#39;s what I&#39;ve <br/>\ndone.  However, out of 5 skills, my main concern is on evoke (afterall I&#39;m <br/>\na nuker mah).  How to I go abt &#39;specializing&#39; in evoke?<br/>\n<br/>\n4. I intend to go into tailoring skill once I max out my smith.  Can I know <br/>\nother than tailoring skill tat can &#39;mix&#39; with smithing skill, is there any <br/>\nother skills which can work along with smith skill?<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Is enchanter the only class that can made &#39;enchanted&#39; jewelry?  Say if I <br/>\ntrain jewelry skills using non-enchanted metal (eg silver), can I rise the <br/>\njewelcraft skill?  So once I can make a certain jewelry with pretty high <br/>\nsuccessful rate, I can buy those &#39;enchanted&#39; metal from enchanters and make <br/>\n&#39;enchanted&#39; jewelry myself?  OR I must make an enchanters char to make <br/>\n&#39;enchanted&#39; jewelry?<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Anyone got any tips on trade skills like tailoring, jewelcrafting, etc? <br/>\n Particularly those &#39;throw-PP-into-drain-kinda power-training&quot;, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus (the future Grandmaster of all Trades, hehe)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
