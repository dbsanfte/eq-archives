Helping my RL friend to tat extend is personal <br/>\ndecision, he been my games kakis since paper AD&D, hmm, tat&#39;s 16 yrs ago <br/>\n(know him since kid time, neighbour, classmates, collegue, kakis, hehe)?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, when there is serious SOS msg, I will be helping also. :)<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: Same thing applies for me ;)  But generally speaking, if others not <br/>\nhelpful, and when they seek SOS and I&#39;m free, I still dun mind helping. <br/>\n Just not to the extend tat I (or whole guild) must stop wat they are doing <br/>\nand rush to the player.  With guildsay, it&#39;s not very difficult to see who <br/>\nis nearest and available to help ;)  The purpose of forming our own kakis <br/>\nis to help as and when we can.  Unlike QHD so many faces I never seen b4, <br/>\nif I can help, I help, if I&#39;m not free, I won&#39;t bother also.  But for own <br/>\nkakis guild, I presume is small group of pple we know in RL or EQ, and have <br/>\ntrust with one another. Under this kinda situation, I&#39;m more willing to <br/>\nextend my help.  If really no one online when a kakis SOS msg is send out, <br/>\nI die die camp for 10 hrs liao will also rush to help.  That&#39;s all I have <br/>\nto say - all depending on situation ;)  One good thing abt this lengthy <br/>\ndiscussion is tat, by now I think all kakis know when to send a SOS msg <br/>\nliao instead of abusing it ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, 19 August, 1999 8:35 AM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; well... then i suggest u guys state the guild guidelines properly... then<br/>\n&gt; see how... becos i want a guild that whenever i need help (and i <br/>\n </span></blockquote>seriously<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; mean it) i wanna get some serious help... like i said... its not gonna be<br/>\n&gt; abused... that kid thing is a fucked up story... but if serious help is<br/>\n&gt; required ... someone must be there to help... that my minimum<br/>\n&gt; requirement.... if u just wanna have a guild for exploring then whats the<br/>\n&gt; point? can always form group and explore what....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; no body ask u to help your RL friend to that extend what... its you who<br/>\n&gt; wanna do that... i never say we MUST do that to all guild members... all<br/>\n&gt; shoud learn how to survive... as a guild... we should also do stuff <br/>\n </span></blockquote>like...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; GIVE HIM A FISH, FEED HIM A DAY<br/>\n&gt; TEACH HIM TO FISH, FEED HIM FOR LIFE.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; if u get what im trying to say... enough said...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nicademous<br/>\n&gt; The &#39;supposed&#39; to be evil Necromancer<br/>\n&gt; p/s: i never ever forget how i was saved by Garren when i needed help and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>if<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; he ever needs  any (which is unlikely now, hehe), i&#39;ll do all i can to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>help<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; him out.... its just the same, if i needed help and no one fuck care bout<br/>\n&gt; helping me... then when im much higher level, u think i still wanna help <br/>\n </span></blockquote>out<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; thesame folks? guess not... </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
