I think brewing is a <br/>\nvery useful trade skill which can easily fulfill ya financial needs, just <br/>\nthat it&#39;s kinda boring and take times.  Nevertheless comparing with <br/>\nhunting, brewing still give me better and faster return than hunting so <br/>\nfar.  If we can spend 1-3 hrs a day brewing, I dun see why the new chaps <br/>\ncant do the same ;)  No doubt we try to help by sponsoring abit, but u guys <br/>\nhave to help us to help yaself sometimes ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing for sure, we the local kakis always keep items which we think <br/>\nother kakis can used (eg I keep cutt ring for newbies, ring mails for <br/>\ntanks, garren keep thu robe for me, les keep woven for me etc).  We will <br/>\ntry to help as and when we can, but one must understand the fact tat <br/>\nutimately u r the one playing the game and handling ya own char, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO, brewing can make some quick buck.  At lvl 10 u shld be able to save <br/>\nup to 10pp.  Of coz I know pple will use them to buy stuffs like <br/>\nweap/armor/scrolls.  But just ponder - if u spend it on brewing, u can earn <br/>\neven more to buys stuffs, at the same time maxing ya skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt lvl 18 now, I&#39;m still picking up bone chips, rusty weaps, animal skins, <br/>\nbeetle eyes and even rat tooth (7cp) to sell.  FYI I&#39;m a wiz with the <br/>\nweakest STR amg all races and I keep SIX bags on me to carry loot.  Many <br/>\ntimes u see me walking between EC and WC while I&#39;m actually running with <br/>\n200% overload on me, haha.    If I can try so hard to save up money, I dun <br/>\nsee why others cant do it. ;P<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus.<br/>\n<br/>\np/s:  Just FYI, the npc at tunnel buy at a lower price than FP npc, so I <br/>\ndie die gotta &#39;walk&#39; back to FP sell.  Now u see I earn all my money using <br/>\nall my blood, sweat and tears, hehe ;)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
