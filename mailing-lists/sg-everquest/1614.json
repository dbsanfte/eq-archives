How often is the dropping of FS weap?  Hehe I&#39;m <br/>\ninterest leh, can loot and gate back to GF to sell to those newbies (lots <br/>\nof them, hehe).<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, I dun understand why certain item are so damn exp in the game. Compare <br/>\nFS and normal weap, the dam difference is not that great right?  Same for <br/>\nnetted armor and woven armor, the ac at most is plus 1 or 2 more only, <br/>\ndunno why pple willing to pay so much for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, heck care man, most impt is to sell the loot at good price, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; BTW...anyone who needs fine steel weapons for their alternate chars or<br/>\n&gt; something...<br/>\n&gt; check out the hermit living in South Karana. He&#39;s dropped FS Long sword, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>FS<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Short sword,<br/>\n&gt; FS 2 handed Sword before. They&#39;re expensive at npcs right if u try to buy<br/>\n&gt; them? Was thinking of selling<br/>\n&gt; them to PCs but i think those damned ppl nowadays all twinked..who even<br/>\n&gt; wants them man? Unless<br/>\n&gt; i  can find good low lvl chars to sell to in maybe more newbie<br/>\n&gt; territory..i&#39;ll just sell to NPC loh..no choice.<br/>\n&gt; Any ideas? Need cash as always...sigh... BTW..that hermit is lvl 20 FYI.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Zanderion Magi of the 6th Rank </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
