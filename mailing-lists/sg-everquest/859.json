At the gnoll respawn, theres the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; famous<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Polished Granite tomahawk which is VERY camped. As the guy was my friend, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;decided to help him get the tomahawk. We had a full group of six and when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;killed the named gnoll, a group member IMMEDIATELY looted the gnoll. Now,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;was very obvious that the gnoll was carrying a weapon, most likely the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tommy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;since he dosen&#39;t load anything else other then the shield, but that guy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;played dumb and pretended he didn&#39;t understand english. As the group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; decided<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;on a alpha loot on the tommy, my friend was the first to get, but that dude<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;who stole the tommy just kept saying &quot;No axe, shield only&quot; And when my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;friend asked for the shield since he should get the first loot, he said<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Shield no with me. In bank&quot; But in the end he just ran away. To think we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;had internal conflict as well as external conflict (A cleric named Kagana<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;kept bitching to my friend that she was bringing a druid which could help<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;her steal kill the gnoll. In the end when the gnoll spawned, they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;mana. lol.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Anyways, I think we Singaporeans should group together OURSELF and only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;trusted friends to do Equipment runs.
