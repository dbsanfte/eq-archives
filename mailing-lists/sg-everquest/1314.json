Thou&#39; it&#39;s a very<br/>\n&gt; small file but it&#39;s not my habit to send attached files over mailing list<br/>\n&gt; (scare kena whacked).  Those who are interested can d/l them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Btw now I really regret allocating 20 points on my STR, and the remaining<br/>\n&gt; on STA and INT, sigh.<br/>\n&gt; If I have an opportunity restart a char, I will still play a wiz, but for<br/>\n&gt; race, I will either choose:<br/>\n&gt; 1. Human<br/>\n&gt; Dump max point into INT, the rest to DEX.  Since all other stats are quite<br/>\n&gt; balance, I will buy all INT jewelries to boost my INT further.  With no xp<br/>\n&gt; penalty, shld be able to lvl quite fast.  The night vision problem can be<br/>\n&gt; solved using lightglobe (lvl 1 spell) or light bank (lvl 16 spell).<br/>\n&gt; OR<br/>\n&gt; 2. Erudite<br/>\n&gt; Dump max point into INT, the rest to DEX.  Thou&#39; got more INT, but also<br/>\ngot<br/>\n&gt; 10% xp penalty, kinda offset as compared to human.  Night vision thingy<br/>\n&gt; applies.  This race is the best option for ultimate killer-nuker at lvl<br/>\n50,<br/>\n&gt; hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of coz, if I dun mind the look and short sight, I can select gnome for<br/>\n&gt; power play - best choice for solo caster in my opinion, due to the high<br/>\n&gt; INT, DEX and AGI.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dark Elf is out of question since i dun really like to role-play as an<br/>\nevil<br/>\n&gt; race, where in RL or in game, unless the power-play capability is worth<br/>\n&gt; been a evil char ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh, anyone ever think of playing in the race war server? Heheh OK OK, dun<br/>\n&gt; throw parang first lah.  I&#39;m only asking, hehe.  Read quite a few articles<br/>\n&gt; in the net on the coming race war server (eg analysing which group is more<br/>\n&gt; or less powerful), sound pretty fun and have lot of role-play elements.<br/>\n&gt;  One thing for sure, it&#39;s gonna be a VERY difficult server to survive<br/>\n&gt; (since u will be KOS in many places), hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; See homepage for details, including our weekly drawing!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
