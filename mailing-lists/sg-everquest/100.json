Hopefully can reach lvl 4 tonight.  The <br/>\n&quot;consider&quot; command is not true, I con a bear and it say fair chance.  When <br/>\nI start to fight, my hp drop so fast!  Lucky someone leave an advice to die <br/>\nat somewhere easy to find.  I always run back to some place I know well b4 <br/>\nI die.  Me start going to east commonland at lvl 2 - coz bats/rats take too <br/>\nlong for me to rise lvl, so I decided to take a risk to go out.
