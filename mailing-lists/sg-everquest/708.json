UO really need battle <br/>\ntactics, esp during PvP.  UO battles also have more tactics, strategies <br/>\nthan EQ since it may involved a big fight of more than 20 players or so (ah <br/>\nremind me of our big crash with MacRonald and his PK gang in Hythloth, <br/>\nalmost 20 of us fighting in the orcish room).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn EQ, u r fighting more often as a 2-6 players team.  The strategy is more <br/>\nstraight forward.  Mainly - tank, buff & support.  Lvl matters ALOT in EQ. <br/>\n Even for the best PvP, most experienced player - ya chances is VERY SLIM <br/>\nvs monsters which is 2 lvl above u ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the fighting tactics is pretty straight forward, it&#39;s really very <br/>\nimpt, IMHO, to get xp first.  That&#39;s why I go for XP more than loot.  With <br/>\nmore xp and higher lvl - I have no worry in getting better loot in future <br/>\n;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOf coz, helping them with items & $$ is also a good way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAiya, dun bother so much lah, make a cleric and all on the list will be <br/>\nvery happy, hehee.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Friday, June 18, 1999 8:36 AM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; i do agree that LKW have some good ideas on how to beat those <br/>\n </span></blockquote>creatures... but i dont think they somehow benefit the low levels... even <br/>\nif they managed to level up fast... it may not be good unless they can <br/>\nincrease their skills as fast at the same time... otherwise i think they <br/>\nwill have a hard time at the later stages... which is even worse...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; i think the best thing one can do to help out a newbie is to provide him/ <br/>\n </span></blockquote>her with some basic armor n perhaps a weapon... since those r the real <br/>\ndifficult to obtain stuff... n maybe help em buy spells :) well... this is <br/>\njust my point of view and i aint in the game yet.... oh well.... comments r <br/>\nwelcome... these r just what i thought from all those reading... n also... <br/>\nim kinda flickle minded about a Necromancer or a Mage... since theres no <br/>\nclear cut bout em... but i think the mage has too many pets... n they aint <br/>\nthey great as compared to the Dark Elf Necromancer... well... see how <br/>\nlah... when the time comes... ill decide... or maybe ill try playing <br/>\nboth... and will decide at some stage...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; cheers,<br/>\n&gt; Fred<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------  <br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; SC Cheng, Freddy<br/>\n&gt; Mobile-Internet Laboratory, Multimedia Laboratory,<br/>\n&gt; NTT DoCoMo R&D Center C212,<br/>\n&gt; 3-5, Hikari no Oka, Yokosuka-Shi,<br/>\n&gt; Kanagawa, 239-8536, Japan<br/>\n&gt; Tel : +81 468-40-3497<br/>\n&gt; Fax: +81 468-40-3788<br/>\n&gt; Email : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a><br/>\n&gt;  &lt;&lt; File: ATT00006.htm &gt;&gt;  &lt;&lt; File: Cheng, Shan Chieh.vcf &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
