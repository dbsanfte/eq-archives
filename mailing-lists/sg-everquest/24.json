Together with","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1150504993\">Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure which UO shard you played but The Dark Wardens (tDw) is always the <br/>\n#2-#4 biggest veteran guild in Baja (check OSI Baja guild list).  Together <br/>\nwith TTW and DWN, we are always fighting for the #2 biggest.  #1 in Baja is <br/>\nAsia, which is made up of several HK/TW guilds.  tDw is one pure guild that <br/>\nstarted off as local guild (formed within 2 weeks after UO launched in <br/>\nS&#39;pore) and slowly expanded to the the biggest single international guild <br/>\n(includes members from US, HK, Japan, S. Korea, Taiwan, Austrialia, UK, <br/>\netc).  TWW, I think, is also one guild by itself while DWN is form by <br/>\nseveral groups of players to make up the player-run town called Kingdom of <br/>\nDawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are very well established in term of skills and resources (we have 20 <br/>\nover guild buildings, including keep, tower, 2-Ss, big brick etc, at one <br/>\ntime, but reduced after the house patch is in as we do not have so many <br/>\nmules to hold the buildings).  Other than GM mage/tank mages in the guild, <br/>\nwe also have several GM smiths, GM bowyers, GM alchemists, GM scribes, GM <br/>\nbards (provokers), GM carpenters/tinkers etc.  We even have GM poisoner <br/>\n(assasin) and GM detective, hehe.  As as today, I still have a castle deed, <br/>\na keep deed and a tower deed reserved for future guild village in T2A, not <br/>\nto include other 2-S, big brick, big smithy house deeds ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also own one of the most popular shops in Baja, The Asmandi (a big brick <br/>\nhouse within west britain guard zone), which have more than 3000 visitors <br/>\nhits, selling only GM suberb stuffs at very reasonable price.  In the shop <br/>\nwe have standard price list which all vendors owners must comply (imagine <br/>\n600gp for full AR30 plate set, all reagents at 1gp above npc shop etc) to <br/>\nensure the best quality stuffs sold as the most reasonable prices.  The <br/>\nshop is also well-known for it Charity Chest (a shop wreck metal chest <br/>\nlocked-down in the shop), where players can leave their unwanted suffs so <br/>\nthat newbies can find something useful from it.  Pls do not think that the <br/>\nchest is a trash bin, as newbies always find goodies inside, including <br/>\nmagical weapons ;)  I myself can throw 20-30 magical stuffs inside in one <br/>\nshot.  The shop also provide free usage of training/thief dummies, forge, <br/>\nanvil etc open to all players.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you play around Baja server down time, often you will see a horde of <br/>\nblack horsemen in Cov entrance, Britain X-road or Britain cemetry, esp Cov, <br/>\nwhere we rules the place most of the time.  Our guild page is also the <br/>\nhosted in Singularity Game site.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanna introduce tDw to more locals players ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDark Flame<br/>\nThe Dark Wardens Guild Master<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://reddawn.s-one.net.sg/uo/tdw/\">http://reddawn.s-one.net.sg/uo/tdw/</a><br/>\n<br/>\np/s: tDw is one of the most reputatable ANTIS guilds in Baja.  No noto <br/>\nhunting, looting, murdering, stealing is allowed in guild, offenders may <br/>\neven face severve punishment of guild KOS.  No tDws will hunt any grey <br/>\nplayers in the game, unless:<br/>\n- We know from past experiences that the grey chap is a baddy.<br/>\n- We see it with our own eyes that the grey chap has done something bad.<br/>\nWhen we said we are ANTIS, we role-played as one.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tuesday, April 27, 1999 5:07 PM, Wilson [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ritzbits@...\">ritzbits@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Wilson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ritzbits@...\">ritzbits@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry, I used to play strictly on UO.
