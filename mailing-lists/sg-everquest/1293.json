Learning Pottery Fast, by Kellendil, Master","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-54248539\">After a weekend of travelling and trading, I now feel confident <br/>\nenough to present you this guide on Pottery.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning Pottery Fast, by Kellendil, Master Brewer, Master Potter, <br/>\nAlways-broke Jeweller. (WIS 95, INT 127, CHR 98)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe nice thing about pottery is that it&#39;s quite cheap to train up, <br/>\nalmost as cheap as Brewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a start, with abosloutely no skill at all, I started making Medium <br/>\nJars. The raw materials for this item are:<br/>\n<br/>\nBlock of Clay (43)<br/>\nMedium Jar Sketch (11)<br/>\nFlask of Water (11)<br/>\n<br/>\nfor a grand total of 65 coppers. These are combined on a Pottery <br/>\nWheel, and a successful skill roll will produce an Unfired Medium <br/>\nJar. This must be placed in a Kiln together with a Quality Firing <br/>\nSheet (22) to produce the final product, which I managed to sell for <br/>\n93 coppers. At this stage, your skill should be rising very fast. I got <br/>\na skill rise on every attempt, whether pass or not, and every time I <br/>\nfired the item in the kiln with the firing sheet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis should be good until your skill goes over 40, at which point <br/>\nyou stop making Clay Jars and get on to Pie Tins. These require:<br/>\n<br/>\n2 Blocks of Clay (86)<br/>\nPie Tin Sketch (11)<br/>\nFlask of Water (11)<br/>\n<br/>\nwhich is a total of 108 coppers in raw materials. Combine these <br/>\nsuccessfully on the Pottery Wheel, then combine in the Kiln <br/>\ntogether with a High Quality Firing Sheet (43). Making these is <br/>\nwhat you will be doing to earn money as well, for they sell at the <br/>\nvendors for 652 copper. Since each Pie Tin&#39;s raw materials plus <br/>\nfiring sheet cost only 151 copper, this is a significant profit.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow making Pie Tins will bring your skill to around 115 points, at <br/>\nwhich point they become trivial. However, just like Jewelcraft, even <br/>\nwhen an item becomes trivial, the failure rate for that item can still <br/>\nbe quite high. I noticed that my Pie Tin failure rate was still about 3 <br/>\nto 4 out of 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to increase my skill to 127, at which the failure rate <br/>\nbecame about 1 in 10, I made Large Bowls from the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nLarge Block of Clay (107)<br/>\nGlass Shards (86)<br/>\nLarge Bowl Sketch (11)<br/>\nFlask of Water (11)<br/>\n<br/>\nwhich came up to a total of 215 coppers per attempt. Again, after <br/>\ncombining on the pottery wheel, firing in the Kiln with a High <br/>\nQuality Firing Sheet (43) was necessary, and each large bowl sold <br/>\nfor 280 coppers; obviously an inferior profit margin. It took me only <br/>\n34 or so attempts to raise my skill from 115 to 127, out of which I <br/>\nestimate half were successes. This means I spent only about 3 <br/>\nplats to raise 12 points from 115.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to recap,<br/>\n<br/>\nSTAGE ONE: Skill 0 to 35 or 40:<br/>\n<br/>\nMedium Jar (Block of Clay, Medium Jar Sketch, Flask of Water <br/>\nand Quality Firing Sheet) 87 coppers each, sold for 93<br/>\n<br/>\nSTAGE TWO (money making stage): Skill 35+ to 115:<br/>\n<br/>\nPie Tin (2 Blocks of Clay, Pie Tin Sketch, Flask of Water and High <br/>\nQuality Firing Sheet) 151 coppers each, sell them for 652 coppers <br/>\neach.<br/>\n<br/>\nOPTIONAL STAGE: Skill 115 to 127++<br/>\n<br/>\nLarge Bowl (Large Block of Clay, Glass Shards, Large Bowl <br/>\nSketch Flask of Water and High Quality Firing Sheet) 258 coppers <br/>\neach, sold for 280 coppers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLove is in the air...<br/>\nGet me a gas mask, quick!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nCya,<br/>\nPraetor<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Praetor@...\">Praetor@...</a><br/>\nICQ 1767778</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
