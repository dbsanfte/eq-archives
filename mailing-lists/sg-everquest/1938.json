How to train it and how much skill u <br/>\nneed b4 u got a high chance (say 80%) to research a particular lvl spell?<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve it or not, at lvl 29 I never do a single research so far and I got <br/>\nall the necessary spells (as a nuker and traveller) I need, either buying <br/>\nfrom wiz guild or getting from &#39;some&#39; other sources ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSay now I never train or use research skill b4, shld I dump in max skill <br/>\npoints (and pay pp also) to max out the skill 1st, or ???<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA!<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: VS guild is formed last night, with 10 kakis, with GM Sereph the flat <br/>\nchest babe, hehe.  To faciliate discussion with non SG kakis (FF & DF) and <br/>\nSG kakis in overseas (Nica), I propose a guild chat in EQ over the weekend <br/>\nto sort things out, preferably last night Fri or Sat.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
