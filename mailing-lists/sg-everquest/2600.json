So you&#39;re absolutely sure you&#39;re<br/>\nnot coming back ever?<br/>\nIf that is the case, i will distribute your stuff sooner than 1 week but<br/>\nonly if you confirm here<br/>\nthat you will absolutely not return anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. You put a Luna on my list and i have only seen a Lunatictiara on who so<br/>\nfar...<br/>\nis this the same Luna you want to give your Rubicite Helm to? Kindly<br/>\nconfirm..<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Will you be on this mailint list still or are you also going to cancel<br/>\nthe subscription?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that&#39;s it for my questions. I wish you&#39;d change your mind friend but<br/>\nI understand your<br/>\nfeelings. Perhaps it really takes one real nasty experience to get ppl off<br/>\nEQ even when<br/>\nthey have been thinking about it for awhile. I experienced it when camping<br/>\nJboots 12 hrs<br/>\nand then getting &quot;voted&quot; out of the queue by some selfish asses after i fell<br/>\nasleep for awhile<br/>\ndespite having done most of the killing and work and having been in first<br/>\nposition 4 hrs.<br/>\nI still will have my revenge! Heh...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you all the best Garren be it in another MMORPG in future or in real<br/>\nlife.<br/>\nBut  most important of all you get to enjoy your REAL life now =)<br/>\nNot the alternate one we&#39;ve been wasting time on hehe..Evercrack it is!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Regards,<br/>\nZand<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Gary Qui Hong Loong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 27, 1999 2:36 AM<br/>\nSubject: [sg-everquest] Fw: I have quit Everquest<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Gary Qui Hong Loong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Gary Qui Hong Loong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 26, 1999 17:26<br/>\n&gt; Subject: I have quit Everquest<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Dued to my failure at PoF which got alot of ppl into trouble<br/>\n&gt; (which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; involved dying and losing the major portion of their stuff) and with<br/>\n&gt; little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; else to do (except like camping for stuff, which I have gotten very sick<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tired of), I have cancelled my account as from today, Oct 26th 1999.<br/>\nZand,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; please give out the items to the people as I have listed down with you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Especially Weadaenye, whom I&#39;m guilty as hell to got her into a living<br/>\n&gt; hell.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Please help me tell the follow people of my quiting and hope to<br/>\n&gt; see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them again sometime on another game another time and Best wishes to<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Daedor, Aildiin, Iyenya, Ironbuket, Hoppy, Kitiarra, Stella,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Saintly, Valadine, Millie, Silph, Lunatictiara, Ader, Fost, Sparrow,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Demitry, Wlyven, Anima and Nismo/Volk (they are brothers sharing the<br/>\nsame<br/>\n&gt; &gt; account).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Everquest was, had been and enjoyable game at the beginning but<br/>\n&gt; due<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the way that the game is designed it reminds me more of Evercamp,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Everbitch etc etc. It has become a torture to enter the &quot;game&quot; each day<br/>\n&gt; now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This incident has at least freed me from Evercrack as some would say it<br/>\n&gt; is.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So farewell my fellow guildmates.
