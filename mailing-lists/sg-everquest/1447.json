1.Guild:Okay,lets<br/>\n&gt;           face it,for normal servers,Guild aint of much fan<br/>\n&gt;           except of a tag there.I foresee that if a guild is<br/>\n&gt;           set up in Tallon Zek,it would be much more<br/>\n&gt;           meaningfull in the sense that when everyone has a<br/>\n&gt;           common goal and at the same time roleplaying WHAT<br/>\n&gt;           it should be[huh?A paladin and SK chatting with<br/>\n&gt;           each other?].Serious roleplaying could be carried<br/>\n&gt;           to the fullest and the tension when going over<br/>\n&gt;           zones which WILL encourage grouping 2.New<br/>\n&gt;           Server.Since its new,it would be nice that there<br/>\n&gt;           will be players around to group. 3.MAIN POINT:The<br/>\n&gt;           tension!This time,you would be much more carefull<br/>\n&gt;           going through zones and when buddies come the<br/>\n&gt;           fullest and where racism too :).Although all the<br/>\n&gt;           Singaporean EQ Players would be best if same<br/>\n&gt;           group,however we could have some not in this group<br/>\n&gt;           so they could set up their own guild and wage war<br/>\n&gt;           with us which WILL defintely improve the SG EQ<br/>\n&gt;           community.If we could not be friends,we could be<br/>\n&gt;           still foes :) 4.ok..high level players..ahem<br/>\n&gt;           Garren...There seems to be a quest to switch<br/>\n&gt;           servers though I do not encourage this coz it<br/>\n&gt;           would be more fun if everyone same level. 5.SG<br/>\n&gt;           Mauling:heh..Imagine all 35SG players on this list<br/>\n&gt;           play same group and have a FULLSCALE invasion on<br/>\n&gt;           Freeport?hehe...imagine the fun.. 6.The spirit<br/>\n&gt;           bond BTW on SG players will defintely tighten with<br/>\n&gt;           this..:) 7.Makes higher lv SGs get good items for<br/>\n&gt;           their lower SG counterparts so our SG strength<br/>\n&gt;           could be increased.[Note:Coz 300levels4s could<br/>\n&gt;           maul a level50?] 8.We could have serious planning<br/>\n&gt;           on what class to use so we would not be as messy<br/>\n&gt;           as now... 9.We had PROBABLY wrongly configured our<br/>\n&gt;           chr in the past so it would be a nice<br/>\n&gt;           change 10.SGs players are now split into 2..mainly<br/>\n&gt;           the highlevels and low levels..It would be nice if<br/>\n&gt;           this everyone would be same level again Thx for<br/>\n&gt;           reading...just my 2cents      Entreri Email:<br/>\n&gt;           <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a><br/>\n&gt;           ICQ UIN: 2326860<br/>\n&gt;           Previewer, Singularity Gaming Network<br/>\n&gt;           <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sg-gaming.net\">http://www.sg-gaming.net</a><br/>\n&gt;           Your Single Source of Everything Gaming .plan at<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;           ttp://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
