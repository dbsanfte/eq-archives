I earned my <br/>\nlvl 13, 14 and 15 there, still giving me so-so xp and good loot at lvl 15. <br/>\n I hunt with Ser/Einan.  They team and we take turn to kill.  Sometime the <br/>\nplace can be quite crowded and pple can just come in without any words and <br/>\nstart hunting themselves (ie act blur even they see we already there).  For <br/>\nthis type of pple wiz always got the best mean to teach them a lesson - <br/>\nsteal their kills when they hunt monsters ard 40% dam, hehe.  No joke, even <br/>\na lvl 19 warrior lost kill to me, hehehe.  I guess that&#39;s the best <br/>\n&#39;ability&#39; a wiz pocess. ;)<br/>\nOnce I get lvl 16, I will go camp 2 since there is more thugs spawning <br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbove lvl 16 I dunno, still havent reach there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Oasis hunting caimen and croc also not bad xp for lvl 10-15, but <br/>\nthe loot is pretty lousy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I&#39;m quite &#39;conservative&#39; in hunting - only been to BB, G Faydark, <br/>\nCB, EC, WC, Ro and Oasis.  Places like Guk or L Faydark not counted coz I <br/>\ngo there kena killed very fast - not to mentioned any xp or loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s time we go Ak&#39;Anon for some mino hunting?  Garren, Yiyang and <br/>\nLeshrec can take mino knight/hero while the rest take mino slave, hehe. <br/>\n Alternatively is to go back CB hunt trainer (for small shinny shield) and <br/>\nderv - always wanna go back CB hunt coz I died too many times there, can&#39;t <br/>\nforget the damn place, haha.  If u like role-playing quest, I dun mind we <br/>\ngo back CB one day and do the quest for screaming mace.  I think that will <br/>\nbe the best item currently we can give to our SOWer Trifrost and healer <br/>\nEinan (must get this healer lvl up fast).<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight I will con&#39;t to brew for 1-2 hrs b4 going to Ro derv camp again. <br/>\n Ser & Ein, join me if interested ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Monday, June 28, 1999 10:06 AM, Alex [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leealex@...\">leealex@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Alex&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leealex@...\">leealex@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any one of u guys pls give tips and info on places with decent xp-lvling <br/>\n </span></blockquote>.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Im sick of HH pass.
