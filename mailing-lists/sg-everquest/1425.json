Ever since we play EQ for so long, I bet by now <br/>\nmost of us know what we wanna be, how to train what our char and possess <br/>\nwith, at least, the basic survival knowledge.  Compared to the time when I <br/>\nstart EQ w/o been a beta player, I was wrong at that time when making <br/>\ncertain decisions, particularly how my char is created.<br/>\n<br/>\nNevertheless, I will stick to Wiz even if we were to shift over to the new <br/>\nserver.  Life is gonna be tough (esp the the begining stage, like wanna die <br/>\ncannot die, wanna live cannot live) but if it&#39;s a race war server, that <br/>\nmean we better select to be under the same team.  With the same team, I bet <br/>\nit will be much easier for us to hunt together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m for Erudite Wiz - with max INT pump in.  Life will be harder than a HE <br/>\nsince ER dun have infravision (tried once in Prexus making a ER Wiz and <br/>\nfind it VERY difficult to play w/o light, kena whack up-down-left-right <br/>\nshortly after I walked out of city).<br/>\n<br/>\nI leave the decision to the majority and my heart follow the majority. Just <br/>\nmake sure this is the LAST migration, IF we have decided to shift.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, can someone enllighten me on the following:<br/>\nIn normal server, npc only KOS char of different alignment (eg DE kena KOS <br/>\nin all elfs settlements, human kena KOS in Troll/Ogre territory, BUT human <br/>\nwont be KOS in elf terrority).  May I know if a char of good race walk into <br/>\nthe city of ANOTHER TEAM which is ALSO a good race, will the char kena KOS? <br/>\n Eg HE and Human are considered good races yet under different team, will a <br/>\nhuman who walk into Felwithe kena KOS by HE npcs?<br/>\n- If the answer is yes, then evil races will be a good choice, since based <br/>\non EQ&#39;Lizer&#39;s article abt race war team comparison, evil races (DE, troll, <br/>\nOgre) have some of the best races for most of the classes.  They also have <br/>\nadvantages since they have more access to the better lvling dungeons.<br/>\n- If the answer is no (ie human char can go to elf shop buying supplies w/o <br/>\nbeen KOS), I will go for human, erudite and barbarian, they can lvl <br/>\nfastest.  Thou life is hard in the begining w/o light, but the reward will <br/>\npay off at the later stage.  Erudite makes the most powerful casters at <br/>\nhigh lvl, Barbarian make excellent tankers and human is the most flexible <br/>\namg all races, plus no xp penalty - see how someone in Inno lvl so damn <br/>\nfast? hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tuesday, 27 July, 1999 9:25 PM, Entreri [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi guys,<br/>\n&gt; I propose that we all move to Tallon Zek[PvP Teams].Okay here are my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>SUGGESTIONS on why we MIGHT wanna move there.However if there isnt much <br/>\nsupport,I will stay in Innoruuk with u guys.All critisims are welcomed!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1.Guild:Okay,lets face it,for normal servers,Guild aint of much fan <br/>\n </span></blockquote>except of a tag there.I foresee that if a guild is set up in Tallon Zek,it <br/>\nwould be much more meaningfull in the sense that when everyone has a common <br/>\ngoal and at the same time roleplaying WHAT it should be[huh?A paladin and <br/>\nSK chatting with each other?].Serious roleplaying could be carried to the <br/>\nfullest and the tension when going over zones which WILL encourage grouping<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2.New Server.Since its new,it would be nice that there will be players <br/>\n </span></blockquote>around to group.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3.MAIN POINT:The tension!This time,you would be much more carefull going <br/>\n </span></blockquote>through zones and when buddies come the fullest and where racism too <br/>\n:).Although all the Singaporean EQ Players would be best if same <br/>\ngroup,however we could have some not in this group so they could set up <br/>\ntheir own guild and wage war with us which WILL defintely improve the SG EQ <br/>\ncommunity.If we could not be friends,we could be still foes :)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4.ok..high level players..ahem Garren...There seems to be a quest to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>switch servers though I do not encourage this coz it would be more fun if <br/>\neveryone same level.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 5.SG Mauling:heh..Imagine all 35SG players on this list play same group <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and have a FULLSCALE invasion on Freeport?hehe...imagine the fun..<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 6.The spirit bond BTW on SG players will defintely tighten with this..:)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 7.Makes higher lv SGs get good items for their lower SG counterparts so <br/>\n </span></blockquote>our SG strength could be increased.[Note:Coz 300levels4s could maul a <br/>\nlevel50?]<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 8.We could have serious planning on what class to use so we would not be <br/>\n </span></blockquote>as messy as now...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 9.We had PROBABLY wrongly configured our chr in the past so it would be a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>nice change<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 10.SGs players are now split into 2..mainly the highlevels and low <br/>\n </span></blockquote>levels..It would be nice if this everyone would be same level again<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thx for reading...just my 2cents<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Entreri<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a><br/>\n&gt; ICQ UIN: 2326860<br/>\n&gt; Previewer, Singularity Gaming Network<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sg-gaming.net\">http://www.sg-gaming.net</a><br/>\n&gt; Your Single Source of Everything Gaming<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; .plan at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=\">http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &lt;&lt; File: ATT00004.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
