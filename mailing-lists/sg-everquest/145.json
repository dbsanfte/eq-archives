I got a<br/>\n&gt; cutthroat ring from Leshrec (thx, hehe).  That&#39;s my only magical item so<br/>\n&gt; far, +1ac and +2 dex.  Can u tell us what&#39;s the stats for Dervish ring?<br/>\n&gt;  Also, mana ring is generating 5mana/sec or what?  What u mean by &quot;5<br/>\nsec&quot;?.<br/>\n&gt;  Is is advisable to buy for a char with 40 mediation skill?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, managed to earn a lvl with the help o fa lvl 10 Hong Kong cleric<br/>\n&gt; last night at bandit camp in GF.  I&#39;ll be meeting him again tonight for<br/>\n&gt; hunting again.  Hopefully I can make it to lvl 8 and earn new spells.  Any<br/>\n&gt; recommendation for wiz&#39;s armor?  So far I&#39;m wearing lousy clothings only,<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t survive too long with low AC.  Not aware of any better armors which<br/>\n&gt; are available for wiz (still new, no chance to see yet, hehe).  I&#39;m saving<br/>\n&gt; money for a great staff but the price is damn (*#$@ expensive - 20pp!!!  I<br/>\n&gt; think when I reached lvl 8, the money in my bank is not even enuff for me<br/>\n&gt; to buy all the new spells, sigh.  Maybe I have a spend a night hunting all<br/>\n&gt; minor monsters like wisp, skeleton and bat, no xp gain but at least can<br/>\n&gt; loot stuffs to sell (waste of time sia!).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 7 Wizard<br/>\n&gt; (Wee!
