(All<br/>\nthis hunting for 1/4 of a bubble)<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone there was shock when they saw the SG attack me and though that<br/>\nI&#39;m going to die and a few shaman dash forth to cast SOW on me, until<br/>\nthey see me<br/>\n<br/>\nTashan-&gt; Whirl-&gt; Melee-&gt; Suffocate-&gt; Arnachy-&gt; Frost Shock-&gt; Arnarchy-&gt;<br/>\nMelee-&gt; Whirl-&gt; Melee-&gt; Whirl-&gt; Frost Shock -&gt; Dead SG<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout taking a single point of damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I did the bloody mistake of turning off Anon, and I got a screen of<br/>\ntells, begging for Clarity and Buffs. I end up giving one who annoyed<br/>\nthe hell out of me with Curse of the Simple Mind(-20 intelligence).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, a level 20+ wiz tried to steal my kill and I response by casting<br/>\nmemory blur and cancel magic on the SG I was fighting + buff the SG<br/>\nattack speed<br/>\n<br/>\nFun seeing the SG killing the wiz in a few sec, then got itself chop by<br/>\nanimated my shield and parang in a minute without doing a single point<br/>\nof damage to my pet. (Animations + attack speed buff + berserker<br/>\nstrength does a hell lot of damage and bash around twice per round)<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I can use Cajoling Whispers(Charm, Invoke Fear(Fear),<br/>\nImmobilise(Root), Mind Wipe(Memory Blur), Resist Magic, Shade(AC buff),<br/>\nInsight(Damn, they&#39;re changing the spell from an INT buff to a WIS one),<br/>\nCelerity(Attack speed increase), Rampage(Berzeker Strength) and<br/>\nPacify(Lull) + the 2 illusion spells which I&#39;ve keep in the bank for so<br/>\ndamn long.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank god that enchanters don&#39;t rely on Research much and I can get all<br/>\nthe spells I need.<br/>\n<br/>\nSabella Estasis, High Elven Enchanter of the 10th Circle and expert in<br/>\nteaching steal killers how to behave.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
