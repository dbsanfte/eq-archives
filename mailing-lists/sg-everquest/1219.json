I know pple is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-84928845\">I&#39;m at CB.  I still got a pair of banded brac and a banded gorget.  I&#39;m <br/>\nthinking of selling each at 1pp for 1 ac, is the price reasonable?  I know <br/>\npple is selling at 1.5pp per ac.  I do not intend to make anymore at this <br/>\nstage, maybe spend another 100pp making skewer till I get master smith. <br/>\n FYI so far I have spend 150pp making the following:<br/>\n- 1 banded boot<br/>\n- 2 banded gorget<br/>\n- 4 banded brac (ie 2 pairs)<br/>\n- less then 30 skewers<br/>\n- 30 to 40 scalar<br/>\nNow u see my &#39;cost&#39; for making this banded stuffs, hehe.  It&#39;s like <br/>\nthrowing pp into the deep blue sea.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;ve got the stuffs (goss robe, dragoon dirk etc) and lvl (finally the <br/>\nturning point of a wiz) I need, I&#39;m going to spend Thurs and Fri night <br/>\nmaximizing my smithing skill.  I got 90pp in bank, plus the hunting <br/>\ntonight, shld be able to save up up 100pp.  Pls pray hard for me to max out <br/>\nmy smithing skill so tat I can make cheap cheap banded stuffs for own <br/>\nkakis.  FYI full set of banded is sold between 50-70pp, I think the cost is <br/>\n20-30pp.  For local kakis, I sure sell at cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny rich guys (hint hint) who wish to contribute/sponsor me are most <br/>\nwelcome.  Btw, it tooks me 2-3 nights to get my skills up from 20 to 70 <br/>\nnow, with 150pp, and during this period FF actually rise a lvl above me <br/>\nwhen he used to be half to 1 lvl behind me.  U can see the &#39;pain&#39; I go <br/>\nthru&#39; in training smithing, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus (The Master Brewer and Half-F*** Smith)<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: I will be leaving Felwithe tonight to FP and I wont return until I get <br/>\nlvl 24.  All those who wanna go FP with me tonight pls give me a tell (esp <br/>\nZanderion).  The estimated time is to leave Felwithe gate at ard 12am <br/>\nmidnight.  If u need to buy anything from me, pls give me a tell b4 11.30pm <br/>\nand meet me at bank, thx.<br/>\np/s: I will try to get a SBS after helping FF to get the Dirk tonight, <br/>\nprovided I got time to camp at trainer hill.  Dun expect too much, coz I <br/>\nused to kill 16 trainers b4 getting one SBS for Einan ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wednesday, 14 July, 1999 2:21 PM, Entreri [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Entreri&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; YOUR AT CB?Sell me banded and another thing,got free SBS from u? ;P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Entreri<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a><br/>\n&gt; ICQ UIN: 2326860<br/>\n&gt; Previewer, Singularity Gaming Network<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sg-gaming.net\">http://www.sg-gaming.net</a><br/>\n&gt; Your Single Source of Everything Gaming<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; .plan at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=\">http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;* Singapore EQ Mailing List&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, July 14, 1999 11:11 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [sg-everquest] FFA<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hey guys, just to share an &#39;interesting&#39; thing I came across last night.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;B4 I met Garren and the guys for Dragoon Dirk hunt, I went to trainer <br/>\n </span></blockquote>hill,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;hoping to get an SBS for some quick buck.  I was invis all the way, as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;usual hehe, and saw this lvl 15 magi from Higher Order of Arcane, Amii <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;few other players.  So I ask her is there any killing order which I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;join, she said no, it&#39;s FFA.  Ok fine then, I love FFA, hehe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Later when a trainer spawn, everyone rush in and this Amii also nuke <br/>\n </span></blockquote>with<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;her pet, one force shock from me killed the mob.  I looted the mob and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;found nothing.  Then this Amii keep asking me what lvl and I refused to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tell her.  She then start to &#39;order&#39; me to take turns.  What is this <br/>\n </span></blockquote>man?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; When things are good for her, she ask for FFA, when thing turns against<br/>\n&gt; &gt;her she ask to take turn.  I didnt wanna refuse directly and keep saying<br/>\n&gt; &gt;since she want FFA, it shalll be a FFA.  She then start shouting all <br/>\n </span></blockquote>over<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;and say I&#39;m a stealer who is not willing to take turns.

Later <br/>\n </span></blockquote>she<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;even auction to offer 2pp for anyone who hurt Dvinn to almost death, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>train<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;it to her and zone off so that she can kill Dvinn for the loot and xp, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>LOL.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; Knn I will pay her 3pp to do it for me man.
