With the help of <br/>\nmy cleric friend (only heal), I managed to kill the dwarf.  When I loot his <br/>\nbody, I&#39;m surprised to find a tongue of that npc!  It&#39;s dunno K????&#39;s <br/>\ntongue.  When I try to sell it, it says the tongue is a lore item which <br/>\ncannot be sold, dropped or trade.  I wonder if anyone can enlighten me on 2 <br/>\npoints:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Why out of so many players near that house, the npc dwarf only attack me <br/>\n(and leave my gnome cleric friend alone)?  I dun think the dwarf is a <br/>\nspawned monster.  I&#39;m using my high-elf wiz at that time, any factoring <br/>\nconflict?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Is there any quest or use of that disgusting tongue?<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
