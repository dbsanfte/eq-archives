Team with<br/>\n&gt;a lvl 6 ranger, lvl 6 cleric and a lvl 7 bard last night in CB (crashbone<br/>\n&gt;lair lah, not chxx bxx).  B4 the fight tat cleric so ya ya (he is so<br/>\n&gt;confident that he make his char a pk char when he started off).  Keep<br/>\n&gt;telling me he is very solid, can fight, can heal and cast spell.  The bard<br/>\n&gt;also ya ya, say she always solo at CB entrance (but she really got a kick<br/>\n&gt;ass axe from divnn).  In the end when we crashed with a train of 5 orc cen,<br/>\n&gt;bard disband and flee herself.  Cleric kena killed very fast (too confident<br/>\n&gt;that he charge whenever he see orc, even I keep asking him to let the rest<br/>\n&gt;heal/med 1st).  In the end he is the 1st one who kena killed and restart<br/>\n&gt;back in Felwithe.  After he run to CB entrance, got killed by orc again b4<br/>\n&gt;he finish looting his corpse, and this thing happened ard 3~4, sigh.  The<br/>\n&gt;ranger is quite ok, he always try to help, but I guess he is not familar<br/>\n&gt;with the area and dunno how to use zone to stay alive when the opponents<br/>\n&gt;are too strong, in the end he also died 3 times.  I myself left solo alone<br/>\n&gt;and earn xp for them, by using travelling across zone to keep myself alive.<br/>\n&gt; After 1.5 hrs of hunting, I also quite sian and logout liao.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Didnt get to meet Les last night, so dunno how to go freeport.  Anyone play<br/>\n&gt;in GFaydark wanna team with me?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Thursday, May 27, 1999 11:09 PM, Gary Qui Hong Loong<br/>\n&gt;[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Gary Qui Hong Loong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     I hope to reach either lvl 8 or maybe lvl 9 tonite. heheh<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Wilson wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Wilson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ritzbits@...\">ritzbits@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;d be doing 2 homepages in the June holidays.
