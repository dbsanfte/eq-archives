Tanks<br/>\nfor hell sake can taunt mobs off you, unless your hand itchy and keep pressing nuke<br/>\nnuke nuke.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf want to go dungeon camping, you NEED to mem Evac, even if you evac to nek<br/>\nforest, I also don&#39;t care, evac is the most important thing a wiz can contribute to<br/>\na group in times of trouble. Nuking is secondary.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s way better for the monks etc to hit a mob to death and for you to finish it<br/>\noff when it runs, instead of nuking all the time, since in a decent group, the<br/>\npuller will pull often, and nuking on sight is dangerous, even if the tanks have<br/>\nperfect taunt skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf want to camp Sol or any other dungeon for extended period of time, we need at<br/>\nleast 2 to 3 tanks to whack mobs into dust, a cleric(or a shaman, druids has the<br/>\ntendency to use wiz style of playing at high levels which is to go pure nuking), a<br/>\nsecondary healer(post battle healing and to heal when the cleric goes OOM and need<br/>\nto med) and a offensive spell slinger to finish off runner while the tanks engage<br/>\nthe other mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Garren is willing to get his arse out of lizard land, he can act as the puller +<br/>\ntank + secondary healer.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric is comfirm fill by me since I&#39;m the only damn person of the guild who can<br/>\nthrow heals better then a g.healing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of both of the other tank can be filled with Zanderion&#39;s or Flyingfox&#39;s pet,<br/>\nbut it&#39;s hard for me to keep track of the pet&#39;s HP, not the mention how stressful<br/>\nit will be for them to keep their pets under control. They can also do the mob<br/>\nfinishing parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nDemitry or Valadine can also fill in Garren&#39;s and the pet spots since they can heal<br/>\nand tank and they can also act as pullers.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, Leshrec, Ziltus and maybe Ling are needed to act as a get out of train<br/>\nbutton and to finish mob off.<br/>\n<br/>\nLKW wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sol A entrance is bugged.  Weeks ago me went with some guys and we managed<br/>\n&gt; to zone in.  Last week I went with Fes/FF/Febon but this time when we try<br/>\n&gt; to zone in, it teleport us to somewhere in Lava.  Fes said Sol A mob are<br/>\n&gt; deeper (refer to those tat give us xp), while Sol B mob (blue) are closing<br/>\n&gt; to zone, so in a sense safer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Asking wiz below 40 to standby for eva means he can&#39;t nuke much.  Eva,<br/>\n&gt; thou&#39; take shorter casting time than portal spells, still take longer than<br/>\n&gt; nornal gate spells and can easily disturbed.  The only situation I can<br/>\n&gt; think of eva been useful is when the team has at least 1-2 tanks and wiz<br/>\n&gt; only nuke after mob&#39;s HP drop to below 50%, meaning wiz&#39;s nuking will NOT<br/>\n&gt; taunt mob to him/her (wiz heavy nuking outshine all tanks&#39; taunt, and u<br/>\n&gt; tanks should be ashame of yaself, hehe).  H/w, most of the time wiz need to<br/>\n&gt; eva is when a train is activated, and chances it that wiz will have already<br/>\n&gt; nuke some mobs and draw them to him/her.  Of coz, wiz can always standby<br/>\n&gt; all time to eva (ie once trains come, eva),  but it will be very boring.<br/>\n&gt;  Worst scenerio I can think of, is when wiz fizzy until he dun have enuff<br/>\n&gt; mana to eva and he gate out instead, meaning those tanks who cannot gate<br/>\n&gt; out is left to rot, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One thing for sure, no casters will wanna team with those cowboys (ie those<br/>\n&gt; pple who are impatient most of the time and wanna chiong all the way, w/o<br/>\n&gt; giving warning msg to those casters who are oom and med).  For this type of<br/>\n&gt; team-mate, I will be the 1st one who gate out - since u never bother abt my<br/>\n&gt; survival, why shld I? ;)  So if there is any cowboy in this ML, pls ponder<br/>\n&gt; abit b4 you complain why no casters wanna team with u.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, my saliver already start dropping with so many goodies in Sol A.<br/>\n&gt;  If we can get 1 or 2 tank, I sure go, since we already got nukers and<br/>\n&gt; healer , heh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Monday, 20 September, 1999 6:28 PM, Gary Qui Hong Loong<br/>\n&gt; [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Gary Qui Hong Loong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       U know where is Najena rite? It&#39;s on the rite hand side of Lavamnt when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; u zone in from the DE newbie hunting grounds. U turn left instead. Then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; go until u reach the merchant at the druid stone. then from there head<br/>\n&gt; &gt; north and East abit. When u c a goblin camp u&#39;re close alreadi. Sol A<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and Sol B entrance is close to each other. Valadine has been to Sol A.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He can bring u there if needed. Btw, go Sol A if u can. They give alot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of good stuff. I can agag bring u ppl around but make sure for a druid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or Wizzie to gate out hor, b&#39;cos there are sooo many secret walls and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stuff. There are certain places I can bring u to b&#39;cos it&#39;s close to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; zone, eg the Foreman Tunic spawn. The goblin capt one is harder b&#39;cos is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; deeper and alot of greenie goblins too. It gives the Charred Plate Armor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (Boots and Gloves). Then there is the EXG clockwork (chicken Feed to win<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but it hits hard. But me (at lvl 40) and a 34th Ranger just bash it to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; death without healing. U just need to make sure u kill it away from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bridge so that the gnomes don&#39;t help it. EXG gives the Charred Plate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Armor or The Charred Guardian Shield (plus 9 Wis). And at the gnome<br/>\n&gt; &gt; castle there is the Dibble (?) give the molten cloak (plus 4 int and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wis). And then there is the little imp called Flint(??). It gives the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; imp skin gloves (plus 5int (??)). Then there is a small little drake<br/>\n&gt; &gt; called Singe (??). It gives Drakescale Belt (forgot stats alreadi) but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give some dex and agi? or it gives the earring that gives mana and plus<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4int. And then there is the Goblin King that gives a good ring (plus<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4int and 4 Str) and the Scepter that gives wis?.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; LKW wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm, for those who stuck at 30s like me, maybe we have to start grping<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lower guk or permafrost...I&#39;m not sure if HH warrior & raider still<br/>\n&gt; give<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; good xp for a grp of lvl 30-35s....<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone got loc of Sol B pls post in ML, thx.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday, 20 September, 1999 5:43 PM, Sereph<br/>\n&gt; [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Sereph &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Garren, thinking of running to Guk to camp for my last 16 levels of<br/>\n&gt; hell,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; how&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; place?
