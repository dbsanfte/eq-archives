So at lvl 20, the most we can","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1757110837\">Err, we wizards wear only clothes.  Weapon is quite useless for us too <br/>\nsince we sux in melee - our lvl lceiling is only 3+3/lvl.  So at lvl 20, <br/>\nthe most we can only have melee skill of 63.  Armor mean nothing much to <br/>\nus, coz full clothes armor only add less than 20ac to us.  When I die at <br/>\norc camp, I normally memo all spells b4 I go get for my corpse. Wearing <br/>\nnothing doesn&#39;t reduce my ac too much, same for my offensive ability coz I <br/>\ndepend on my spells 95% of the time.  Imagine my worn great stuff only hit <br/>\n14 max per hit, while my spell hit max 45 (at lvl 8, and at lvl 20 we can <br/>\nblast 100 over dam per cast).  For wiz, there is no such thing as <br/>\nwell-balance weap.  The only true weap we got is our spells ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, so far didnt come across any patchwork armors, can wiz wear that too? <br/>\n I&#39;ve been wearing clothes so far, and can get quite easily from dwarf <br/>\nskeletons/orcs cen.  Of coz, compare to monk who doesnt wear or hold much <br/>\nstuffs, they death is &#39;cheaper&#39; in the sense that they can afford not to <br/>\nrecover their corpse and start afresh elsewhere, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I never asked any pple for armor/weap after I died - since they <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help much and I&#39;m prepare to die again in the course of retrieving <br/>\nmy corpse, hehe, so dun waste others&#39; money ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I hate is to travel to and fro to buy food/drink.  Best if I <br/>\ncan team with cleric or magi or wood-elf coz they can provide free food.<br/>\n<br/>\nH/w, I&#39;ve just shifted house last wekkend and now my house is in a mess - <br/>\nno phone line, PC not assemble yet, no table etc.  Guess I have to stop EQ <br/>\nfor a week.  Hopefully u guys dun increase lvl too much, so that I can <br/>\nstill group with u guys, hahahahahahahah ;-?<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sunday, May 23, 1999 6:18 PM, Gary Qui Hong Loong <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Gary Qui Hong Loong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Aye, u&#39;re rite. but ranger would have not problem with getting their<br/>\n&gt; stuff back.
