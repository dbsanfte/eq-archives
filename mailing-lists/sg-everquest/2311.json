Frankly speaking, at lvl 32 I dun get XP for some of the trees<br/>\n&gt;chopped (2 persons I still get xp from ALL trees).  Thus, we told him we<br/>\n&gt;are unable to accpet him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Next round, Fatez start to nuke after we casted, and he get a kill.  Fine,<br/>\n&gt;we said, if he capable of FFA, so shall it be (NOTE: We have no objection<br/>\n&gt;against FFA, but we hate pple use us to tank for them to hunt for xp).  So<br/>\n&gt;next round, we let him take both.  In the end, he almost died and we nuke a<br/>\n&gt;bit.  I even bandage him and explain to him why we cant let him joined.<br/>\n&gt; This bastard say yes, and YET after he recover, he KS again! WTF?  In the<br/>\n&gt;end, Les/Zan take front tree, I take back tree, he get nothing.  He then<br/>\n&gt;started to curse and sweat me, no big deal, I see lots of cry babies like<br/>\n&gt;him all the time, but really sux to see a wiz like him cry, LOL.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;After seeing no response from me, he threatened me to get his lvl 40 wiz<br/>\n&gt;friends come.  No big deal, I told our guys, and Les said the most we leave<br/>\n&gt;if that lvl 40 wiz get all kills lor.  Anyway Fatez also won&#39;t get any xp<br/>\n&gt;teaming with lvl 40.  So we stayed and waited.  Asshole really called a lvl<br/>\n&gt;40 & a lvl 31 wiz, all 3 from same guild called Order of the Black &quot;Cocks&quot;<br/>\n&gt;(ok it&#39;s not cocks, but they are so stupid tat we called them cocks).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So...War of Century Nuking started!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Been a lvl 40 wiz, that DE is casting using the same spells we are using<br/>\n&gt;(most powerful lvl 29 dd spells), but that spell dam rise with lvl.  By<br/>\n&gt;right, he shld have won all the kills.  In the end, guess wat?  We got more<br/>\n&gt;than 95% of the kills! LOL!  It&#39;s really no faces for a grp of 3 wiz (lvl<br/>\n&gt;40, 31, 30) to lose kill to a grp of 2 wiz (lvl 32/31) /1 magi (lvl 31),<br/>\n&gt;esp Zan is doing more like a traffice control in the camp (to kill<br/>\n&gt;wandering animals to prevent them blocking our target).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To me, it&#39;s just a very simple tricks that we are doing, but I&#39;m not going<br/>\n&gt;to disclose here ;)  More like a common sense for nukers but the 3 DE wiz<br/>\n&gt;dun seems to know it, which make us ponder how they get their lvl, esp the<br/>\n&gt;lvl 40 wiz.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Funny thing is that after an hr or so, that lvl 40 wiz started to msg me,<br/>\n&gt;saying he gave up and asking how we win kills (Les and me always cast b4<br/>\n&gt;them).  Of coz I wont say lah, since that grp got no honor, heal them help<br/>\n&gt;them still fight with us.  So we make up of 2 stupid reasons, which they<br/>\n&gt;believe at least one of them:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1. Our guild has pool resources of 1000k pp, and buy this artifact from GM.<br/>\n&gt; This artifact works like HT, and it allows us to get kills most of the<br/>\n&gt;time. LOL.<br/>\n&gt;2. When asked abt how we cast faster, I told him we got OC10 (I also dunno<br/>\n&gt;what&#39;s tat, Zan taught me to sian), which is pipeline for internet, blah<br/>\n&gt;blah blah, and we see mobs 1-2 secs b4 them, and that&#39;s why we won most of<br/>\n&gt;the kills.  This they believed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m right - after I told them, 3 bastards still try to fight for kills,<br/>\n&gt;LOL.  And of coz, they lost all.  In the end the lvl 40 & lvl 31 wiz left,<br/>\n&gt;left that fu*ker Fatez, who still hang ard for 30 min or so, trying to get<br/>\n&gt;a kill.  In the end we gloat and suan him alot, he so pissed that he said<br/>\n&gt;he wanna beat us up in RL, LOL.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Never been my EQ life I feel so shiok wining a lvl 40 wiz, good work guys.<br/>\n&gt;FYI, I&#39;m using only 56k and Les 28k/32k.  We all know Les got a slow system<br/>\n&gt;yet he also cast b4 that grp, really solid!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Funny thing is that Les and me are not KSer, yet we can do it very well.<br/>\n&gt; Shld we KS, I believe we will get better loot and higher lvls.  But alas,<br/>\n&gt;KS is not our cup of tea ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The fact that it&#39;s a grp of HE (lower INT, lower LVL, less nukers) wons a<br/>\n&gt;grp of DE (higher INT, higher LVL, more nukers) make the victory a special<br/>\n&gt;one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;LONG LIVE HIGH ELVES!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ziltus Planeswalker.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
