That&#39;s why those stealer wait for others to hit the mob till 30-40% <br/>\nb4 they start to nuke.  If they nuke at the begining which I did (which <br/>\nshow I&#39;m not a stealer), it will draw the mob to them coz mob will go after <br/>\nthe one tat hit him most.  So when other hit mob at 40%, I nuke 1 time, <br/>\nhiting it for 35%, the mob still attack others, by the time I nukle the 2nd <br/>\ntime, the others will hit it for another 5% (ie total 45%) I can kill the <br/>\nmob b4 it come to me.  Now THAT&#39;s stealing ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it come to group, I&#39;m not too sure.  I read from the net that if 2 gps <br/>\ngo after 1 mob, sometime depending which player from a gp hit the mob most, <br/>\nthe kill will go to tat gp.  By right the kill shld go to the gp tat hurt <br/>\nit most, but seem like some players encounter the kill go to the gp with <br/>\nthe PLAYER that hit it most.  Maybe other can verify?<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night when I login at HH pass, there is a lvl 26 wiz stealing there. <br/>\n He is a damn cunning, he nuke and invis while mediating or watching other <br/>\nstarting the fight and he nuke when pple hurt mob for more than 30%.  He is <br/>\nonly using the 3 lvl shock spells and he nuke so fast that even my fire <br/>\nshock lost to him.  I lost 2 kills and then decided to leave the place coz <br/>\nno point arguing or try to steal back.  When the opponent is so much higher <br/>\nlvl than me plus the fact tat he is a wiz, it&#39;s just a waste of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater I join the guild hunt at befallen.  I managed to survive during the <br/>\nwhole hunting, but I get killed twice by Gix the *(&$#@ dark elf npc at WC. <br/>\n Lost all the xp I gained for the night and drop b4 where I 1st login, <br/>\nhehe.  FYI that bastard can see me invis and can see far!<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight I&#39;m organising a xp hunting, to recover the lost last night, at <br/>\noasis (near mountain next to zone).  The loot there is kinda lousy but the <br/>\nxp is not bad (still not as good as HH).  H/w, with the place just next to <br/>\nzone, it&#39;s much safer to hunt tat.  And becoz there r lots of orcs spawn <br/>\n(can have train of red orcs of 8 one shot) and the loot is lousy, few high <br/>\nlvl stealers go there.  The place is for pple above 16, come join me if <br/>\ninterested.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tuesday, 06 July, 1999 9:14 PM, Synzzz [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hannibal@...\">hannibal@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Synzzz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hannibal@...\">hannibal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Guys,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s very sad that wiz get to steal kills like that.
