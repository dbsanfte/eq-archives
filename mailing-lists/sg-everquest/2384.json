I rarely get any disconnection anymore. Prior to that, I always get<br/>\ndisconnected 7 to 8 times per hour. I am using 56K Analog dial-up from<br/>\nCyberway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you need to be subscribed for at least 3 months before you can<br/>\nterminate your account for Cyberway. The same goes for Pacific Net but I am<br/>\nnot sure about SingNet.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that Verant has fixed the network problem. I will encouraged you to get<br/>\nCyberway to play your EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 16, 1999 10:49 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [sg-everquest] Signing up PacNet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m also thinking of getting a unlimited usage acct, and I know cyberway<br/>\n&gt; got this $48 unlimited usage plan.
