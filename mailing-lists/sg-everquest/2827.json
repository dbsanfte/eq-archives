I&#39;m <br/>\nhoping to get some lvl 50 lao jiao who has nothing to do after reaching 50 <br/>\nto PL me abit ;)  Think abt last time I used to help others lvl abit but <br/>\nthis time round only Les and Mas help so far.  Guess the rest r busy with <br/>\nthe plane hunting? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I&#39;m also very surprised to see pple booking date to hunt this, camp <br/>\nthat.  I find it pretty rediculous.  Unlike last time we can whack any <br/>\nplace we want (even have some KS fights with other players, still quite fun <br/>\nwhether we win or lose the KS fights), now I hardly see other members, esp <br/>\nthose high 40ish or lvl 50s, probably I&#39;m too weak to join them for their <br/>\nhunting too.<br/>\n<br/>\nZan, if u come back anytime, give us a guildsay spam, I kinda miss it <br/>\nnowadays.
