BUT there are certain stuff that made me think twice bout this<br/>\ngame...<br/>\n1. i feel that this game is all about levels... u gain levels u kill<br/>\nstuff... u gain more levels to kill more powerful stuff... and its goes on n<br/>\non n on... never ending...<br/>\n2. nothing so interesting... initially i thought u can create items using<br/>\ntrade skills n stuff... so its not so bad... BUT verant decided that trade<br/>\nskill shouldnt let u earn marnee... so they nerfed it... sad...<br/>\n3. all the servers are wayyyyyyyyyyyy too packed... everywhere is camped...<br/>\ncan u imagine when ur in a fantasy world... theres folks killing everything<br/>\nn u dont even get to see any mobs for u to kill? off course timing is<br/>\nanotehr thing...<br/>\n4. verant start nerfing classes when they reach level 50 in one month<br/>\ninstead of the 1 year they  claimed... maybe u guys dont play Shaman, Druid,<br/>\nor Necro... so u dont really feel it... but they practically remove my<br/>\nability to fight (if u have some knowledge bout the new DOT patch they are<br/>\ngoing to implement)...  the mob just needs to keep moving at me and it wont<br/>\nbe harmed... pvp will be a joke... then u will see every necro go play a<br/>\nmage or wiz...<br/>\n5. like all the points... this game is become more meaningless... im<br/>\nstarting to think that UO is actually a better game... more depth... (not<br/>\nthat UO is without its own problems)... but i can be sure that when UO 2<br/>\ncomes out in Dec 2000, it will certainly beat all the games outta it.... or<br/>\nperhaps not since Middle Earth is due bout that time... hehe...<br/>\n<br/>\ndespite all those ranting... hehe... i will still play the stupid eq... bcos<br/>\ni paid until december... (what to do)... and perhaps i will change my view<br/>\nwhen the time comes... for now... im a wiz (to be honest i find that wiz<br/>\nperform good in group... but they suck when solo - totally opposite of<br/>\nnecro)...<br/>\n<br/>\nthast all i have to say...<br/>\nNicademous<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 03, 1999 4:57 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [sg-everquest] How many of u guys at Tribunal?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hmm, u mentioned that Inno economy is all screwed, can u elaborate abit<br/>\n&gt; more?  *scratch head* ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I feel tat every servers will ultimately grow &quot;mature&quot;, meaning more<br/>\n&gt; twinked chars will show up as the time goes by.<br/>\n&gt; The joy of playing online RPG like UO and EQ comes from the different<br/>\n&gt; stages of char development in the game (newbie, intermediate, experienced,<br/>\n&gt; veteran, god-like).  No doubts it&#39;s easier to train a char with somebody<br/>\n&gt; twinking you, but you will lost the fun, the good, the bad, the sad, the<br/>\n&gt; fear, the frustration, the joy etc...all the experiences u are supposed to<br/>\n&gt; encounter when playing this game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For those twinked chars you come across, most of them has a high-lvl char<br/>\n&gt; behind supporting.  This means that those players also spend their time<br/>\n&gt; going thru&#39; the newbie stage.  If everything comes so easily, u will soon<br/>\n&gt; lost interest in the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Personally I think quite number of those exisitng kakis can easily spare<br/>\n&gt; 10-20pp for a newbie kakis buying a descent set of newbie<br/>\n&gt; weap/armor/stuffs.  I think with this &#39;twinking&#39;, it&#39;s already good enuff<br/>\n&gt; to start off training ya char.  On the other hand, sometime it&#39;s best for<br/>\n&gt; new-comers to spend a week or so, playing a brand new char w/o any<br/>\n&gt; twinking, to get the feel of the game and decide if it is the class/race<br/>\n&gt; that you are going for.  If every new comers come into server and suga<br/>\nsuga<br/>\n&gt; create new char, we help to twink abit, and delete char to re-create<br/>\n&gt; another one and expect twinking again, then it&#39;s not tat fair to those<br/>\n&gt; helping.  So it&#39;s always a 2-sided coins ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just like playing RTS game.  If u hack a saved game and play the game by<br/>\n&gt; building only the more powerful units to rush ya opponents, u will never<br/>\n&gt; learn the usefulness of other units.  For most of the solo campaign game,<br/>\n&gt; normally there is 1 or 2 missions where the most powerful unit (which is<br/>\n&gt; normally slowest) is no longer a useful element in completing the mission.<br/>\n&gt;  At this stage, only those players who really play from scatch will be<br/>\nable<br/>\n&gt; to tackle the problems and complete the mission safely.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some players reached lvl 50 first, some reach lvl 50 later.  Ultimately we<br/>\n&gt; will all be lvl 50s.  Just ask yaself, what kinda lvl 50 u wanna be? ;)<br/>\n&gt;  FYI there are some lvl 49 players in EQ who even lost their way in South<br/>\n&gt; Karan, si-bek jiat-lat, hahahah ;P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I myself is one of those few amg local kakis tat started a char in Prexus<br/>\n&gt; when it&#39;s first up.  With my wiz experience in Inno, I make a really cool<br/>\n&gt; wiz char in Prexus.  H/w, dun to the lack of kakis, I find training there<br/>\n&gt; is very boring.  In the end I follow the rest back to Inno.  Now u may<br/>\nsay,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s not tat difficult to find grp members to hunt with, but I must<br/>\ncomment<br/>\n&gt; that it&#39;s VERY difficult to find TRUST-WORHTY kakis in the game.  Ask<br/>\n&gt; veteran players like Sereph and Garren, their feeling when someone in the<br/>\n&gt; grp looted the camped stuffs, disband and run off? ;)  At least in Inno, I<br/>\n&gt; know who I can fight together...to death.  Until now I still remember the<br/>\n&gt; newbie named David in Prexus, who disband from the team when we striked a<br/>\n&gt; skelly train near Ak&#39;non dragon bone land.  When some of the team members<br/>\n&gt; asked him why he disband after the battle, he said he was LD, while I<br/>\n&gt; myself saw him running to guards with my own eyes ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p/s: I read form a EQ site that the numbers of casters armors discovered<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; only less than 10% of all the casters armors in the game ;)  Just tat<br/>\n&gt; casters sux in adventuring (we are better in camping) due to train and<br/>\n&gt; random spawn, we dun discover as many casters stuffs like those tanks out<br/>\n&gt; there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Friday, 03 September, 1999 2:44 PM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy<br/>\n&gt; [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if u r looking to get twinked... i suggest u go prexus...
