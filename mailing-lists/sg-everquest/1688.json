U can only ask someone to hunt on ya behalf<br/>\n&gt; &gt; PROVIDED they dun need one, as in #3).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The dangers:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1. JK Skull & RTS r dropped by the gnolls (high sha and emi) at the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>zone<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; entrance from SK to LR (during the day).  The gnolls, gnoll guards and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gnoll shamans lvl below 18 I think, but the shaman will heal the high <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sha<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; and emi (both ard lvl 20) when we fight, even thou they themselves are <br/>\n </span></blockquote>con<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; green to us and will not be involved in the fight.

Of coz, in this <br/>\n </span></blockquote>case,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; priority will give to those who phyically involved in the fighting 1st <br/>\n </span></blockquote>;)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2. Water Crystal Staff<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s dropped by a OVERPOWERED lvl 24-26 aqua goblin called Webclaw. <br/>\n </span></blockquote> Webbie<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; can found in serveral spots in LR.  Its magical hit VERY HARD and is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>VERY<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; AGRO in water, and thing get worse if we enagaed it in the water (we <br/>\n </span></blockquote>get<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; disturbed more often when casting, and swim slower, if we lose, chances <br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; that we will get killed and corpse sinks into the deep lake, then <br/>\n </span></blockquote>corpse<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; seeking and looting session will start).  After much investigation <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(I&#39;ve<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; been camping in LR from lvl 20 to 27), I will lead the team to the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>spawn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; spot of Webbie, which is the tower isle (extreme end from zone, that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>mean<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; there is NO way to flee if we lose UNLESS we bind near zone, gate out <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; zone).  The plan is to root Webbie (btw it also run VERY fast) the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>moment<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; it spawn before it run towards shore.  I&#39;ve tried rooting Web in water <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; know other spots it shows its face) but seem like a bug will make it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disappear the moment it is rooted in water (I won&#39;t advise to melee it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; water unless Garren is coming, coz it&#39;s not funny to search for ya <br/>\n </span></blockquote>corpse<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; in the deep blue lake).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There is 2 concerns regarding the danger for this hunt:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a. To get to the tower isle, you have to swim across the whole lake.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Danger arise when u meet some giant fresh sharks (bigger size than <br/>\n </span></blockquote>orge) ,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; frogloks, aqua goblin, water snakes, or worse, Webclaw itself and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Froglok<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Prince (lvl 30 plus, very powerful, con red, and very very agro, out to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kill EVERYTHING in lake).  This problem can be overcome by taking a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>boat<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; from gnoll camp to tower isle (but take much longer).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; b. The spawn spot for Webclaw, UNFORTUNATELY, is also the spawn spot of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Froglok Prince (lvl 30 plus, very powerful and agro) and a deep sea <br/>\n </span></blockquote>goblin<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; pet (lvl 22 to 25 I think).  With FF and me, it&#39;s no big deal taking <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Web,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; or even when the pet spawn at the same time.  H/w, SUAY SUAY, if the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Prince<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; spawn during the fight or come to us, both of us will be the one to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>gate<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; first, since we will have NO fight versus the Prince ;(<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This hunting trip is NOT for anyone below 4th circle (even if we buff u <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; full and guard u all time). Unlike the Guk hunt, it&#39;s VERY difficult to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; find ya corpse if u died in lake, and chances is that u will lose ya <br/>\n </span></blockquote>stuffs<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; forever.  To prevent wasting more than half of the time finding/looting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; corpses, this trip is STRICTLY for 4th & above circle chars (lvl 12 for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; casters, not sure for others) only.  Frankly speaking I believe all <br/>\n </span></blockquote>kakis<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; got at least a 4th circle chars, whether primarily or secondary chars.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Just dun bring ya newbie char along pls.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; LAST NOTE:  This is not a XP or $$$ hunting trip.  There will be no <br/>\n </span></blockquote>hunting<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; of aviak guards etc for xp and coins.  It&#39;s a very task-specific trip - <br/>\n </span></blockquote>get<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; the 3 artifacts for those who need them and get out of the place (I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gate to Fay, Tox, NK by then).  Anyone who are impatient while waiting <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; the spawn and turn to hunt others will bear their own risk soloing it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(lvl<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; 20 to 22), coz we will not waste time and mana helping anyone to gain <br/>\n </span></blockquote>xp<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; there.  Webclaw spawn and run very fast from tower to shore, maybe <br/>\n </span></blockquote>within 5<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; seconds or so, we can&#39;t afford to miss it, given that it&#39;s a rare <br/>\n </span></blockquote>spawn.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; PREPARATION:  Everyone please get ready AT LEAST 40 foods, 40 drinks <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and 40<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; of your spell reagients (if applicable). I&#39;m trying to make it a sharp <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; sweet fruitful trip, so pls dun come to assembly area then asking for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; food/drink etc.  FF can summon 20 bandages each for those who need (thx<br/>\n&gt; &gt; FF!) but I dun wanna see him wasting time summoning food/drinks unless <br/>\n </span></blockquote>we<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  really took so long to camp for the stuffs (40 food/drinks can last me <br/>\n </span></blockquote>10<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; hrs hunt I think).
