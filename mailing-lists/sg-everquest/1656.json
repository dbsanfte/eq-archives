No time for my <br/>\nZiltus liao, how to spare time for other server? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, I use mana calculator and confirm at lvl 30, my mana (INT 107) is more <br/>\nthan 200 mana points lesser than a erudite wiz of max INT (and I think at <br/>\nlvl 50 I will cast 2 less ice comet than other wiz, sigh).  Very tempted to <br/>\nstart a new wiz char once Ziltus hit lvl 30 (Zil can help new char to get <br/>\nitem to make him start off, just like tat gu niang Fesse who start a lvl 1 <br/>\ncleric with full bronze plate, undead collor and lots of pp, hehe).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe prob with Eru wiz is his night blindness and how to get him to FP and <br/>\nmeet u guys.  Can anyone tell me how to take boat from Eru city to Q city <br/>\nand run to FP?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I will get him a large light stone to start off with, preferably <br/>\nwith water crystal staff and JK skull, plus all useful circle 1 and 2 <br/>\nspells, ful clothes amor and some cheapo jewelries from Kellendil, hehe. <br/>\n(quite easy to get from lvl 1 to 4 in a night, tried in Prexus b4).<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, with so many kakis making new chars, we better have another round of <br/>\nroster list liao ;)  Hey when is the next newbie hunt? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus Planeswalker, lvl 28 High-elf Wiz (Master <br/>\nSmith/Brewwe/Swimmer/Healer/Sense Direction/7 Casting skills/Spec Evoke)<br/>\nApathaz, lvl 1 Erudite Wiz (Potential Nuke King, hehe)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wednesday, 11 August, 1999 12:20 AM, Tan Lychin <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:raterak@...\">raterak@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Tan Lychin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:raterak@...\">raterak@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Ehhh so who&#39;s in Vallon Zek right now?
