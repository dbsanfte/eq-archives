Several reasons for<br/>\nthis..<br/>\n1. Certain necro spells like Vampiric embrace require you to hit your<br/>\nopponent for it to take effect. Since piercing has lesser delay than blunt,<br/>\nit should mean more chances of hiting.<br/>\n2. The best 2hblunt, which i think is the staff of observers is NOT<br/>\nwieldable by necros, only other caster types. I read this from a EQ<br/>\nequipment guide, but it may be wrong, so please check it out first.<br/>\n3. If possible, max out your piercing skills during the first few levels,<br/>\nits much easier since from level 1-4, the pet is DAMN useless, a little more<br/>\npowerful than a decaying skeleton. From level 4 onwards, the pet is a little<br/>\nbetter, but once you get to level 6, either you must group with a warrior or<br/>\nwizard, since your pet can only take 2-3 blows from the white and sometimes<br/>\nblue stuff....<br/>\nThis is from my experience from playing a necro to level 8 so after that yer<br/>\non your own ) Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, June 23, 1999 9:51 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [sg-everquest] Getting a starter kit...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Come to freeport, I will provided u with full clothes armor & stave, plus<br/>\n&gt;binding somemore ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Oh, as a DE, I suggest u train in 2H blunt weap (ie 2H stave), since u dun<br/>\n&gt;need an extra hand to carry lantern and stuffs.  Also dun bother to spend<br/>\n&gt;any points on ya magery skills, they are already available on ya personal<br/>\n&gt;skill list.  Also dun spend any points on piercing (ie dagger) skill.  The<br/>\n&gt;only time u need to spend ya skill points is when u get a worn great stave.<br/>\n&gt; Spend just 1 point on 2H blunt and keep the rest for future.  I was conned<br/>\n&gt;by the net stating that we need to spend a point in magery skills, which I<br/>\n&gt;tested to prove it wrong using my gnome wiz.  We dun have to train in it,<br/>\n&gt;just keep casting in town will do.  Most impt thing is once u start ya<br/>\n&gt;char, train ya magery skills to lvl ceiling, u will automatically get<br/>\n&gt;improvement on these skills.  Do the lvl ceiling training everytime u gain<br/>\n&gt;a lvl.  For magery classes, our lvl ceiling is (lvl+1)X5.  Eg lvl 1 ceiling<br/>\n&gt;is skill 10, lvl 2 is skill 15 etc.  For melee our lvl ceiling is<br/>\n&gt;(lvl+1)X3.  During lvl 1-4, it doesnt matter if ya piercing skill is zero,<br/>\n&gt;u can gain lvl easily - just endure until u can get a 2H stave and start<br/>\n&gt;training it.  Once u reach lvl 4, spend another skill point on mediation.<br/>\n&gt; The rest dun bother - keep the skill points until u wanna learn a trade<br/>\n&gt;skills or special magery skill like research or specialization.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Remember Dragco from our UO allies TAA?  Tat chap get his lvl 11 wiz in<br/>\n&gt;just a week in other server, so hard to pull him over to innoruuk now ;(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;p/s: Maybe I also start a DE char with u and test play it, provided I got<br/>\n&gt;time ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Wednesday, June 23, 1999 8:31 AM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy<br/>\n&gt;[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; hi,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; i will most likely be starting out this coming weekend... although im<br/>\n&gt;still expecting the game (but should be here quite soon)... just wondering<br/>\n&gt;if any of u guys will be kind enough to donate some freebies to a newbie<br/>\n&gt;with a starter kit?
