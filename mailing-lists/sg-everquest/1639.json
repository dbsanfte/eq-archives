The grand resurrection of the SG kakis guild!<br/>\n*starts to hear ppl groaning*<br/>\n<br/>\nOi! All get a bit alive leh, and stop leaving the hall, or else!<br/>\n*flashes 2 dual-bladed dicoted katanas*<br/>\n<br/>\nGood, now sit down and listen. We currently got these problems:<br/>\n<br/>\n1: Existing goons in QHD how???<br/>\n2: Kakis not united leh, how???<br/>\n3. Server getting conjested how???<br/>\n<br/>\nFor 1, I suggest that if enough people here wishes to quit QHD and form<br/>\na local guild, we all gather at the wizard spire in NK, and get Ling to<br/>\nteleport Wylven there, and we talk to him, face to face, about leaving.<br/>\n<br/>\n2, We SG kakis are not really united as a whole. All run here run there,<br/>\nrarely got chance to meet each other, and on top of that. Only when they<br/>\nget drag, do we see them.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. As all you people know, Innoruuk is getting very congested, and<br/>\nseveral places are made dangerous, due to the high level people, camping<br/>\nitems for their friends. If a local guild is to be form, will be still<br/>\nbe in Innoruuk, or change to a new server, and restart anew, with each<br/>\nkaki helping one another out from the start.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I have to yell this out again. WHO THE FISH HAS FREE WEBSPACE<br/>\nTO SPARE!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m getting some web servers for reselling purpose and if this is not<br/>\ndone soon, I&#39;ll keep one of the server, and we&#39;ll split up the<br/>\nmaintanace fee of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE: This is NOT that big change I&#39;m talking about. Just a minor step<br/>\nto getting more organise.<br/>\n<br/>\nSereph wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Expected.
