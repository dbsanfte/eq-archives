Which shard<br/>\n&gt;u play?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Actually Asia has approached us for alliance b4, but problem is the guild<br/>\n&gt;expands so fast that many noto hunters/pkers are also inside Asia now (some<br/>\n&gt;of them even fight with us before when they noto hunt).  It make us very<br/>\n&gt;uncomfortable allied with them, esp they asked for war-declared allies (ie<br/>\n&gt;both side declare war, not for the sake of fighting but more for helping<br/>\n&gt;one another when in need).  When we talked abt allies, we refer to those<br/>\n&gt;long-term trust-worthy ones, like our more than a yr ally - TAA.  As<br/>\n&gt;allies, we share lots of our resources with them, eg providing free vendor<br/>\n&gt;shop for them, invitation them for most guild activities etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Problem in UO is land is so scare that there is NO WAY to put anything<br/>\n&gt;bigger than a small house.  On the other hand, there r so many stuffs to<br/>\n&gt;store in UO, haha.  I really look forward to see how EQ manage inventory.<br/>\n&gt; Any exisitng EQ players can share your experience?  How many items can u<br/>\n&gt;carry in UO, how u keep &#39;stock&#39;, how to transfer stuffs amg chars of same<br/>\n&gt;acct etc? ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Oh, is Innoruuk the one Gary mentioned w/o any lag?  Maybe we shld set up a<br/>\n&gt;Local EQ msg board  for all local players to get togather discussing the<br/>\n&gt;game.  I dun mind setting up one as my UO site already shifted to<br/>\n&gt;Singularity ;)  Maybe 1st thing we need to discuss which server is the best<br/>\n&gt;and has more locals, then new comers at least know which way they shld go<br/>\n&gt;;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Tuesday, April 27, 1999 6:48 PM, Wilson [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ritzbits@...\">ritzbits@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Wilson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ritzbits@...\">ritzbits@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Kudos to you.

I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;&gt; heard of Asia, like you said, most HKs.

Korea, Taiwan, Austrialia, UK,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; etc).  TWW, I think, is also one guild by itself while DWN is form by<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; several groups of players to make up the player-run town called Kingdom<br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dawn.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; We are very well established in term of skills and resources (we have<br/>\n&gt;20<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; over guild buildings, including keep, tower, 2-Ss, big brick etc, at<br/>\n&gt;one<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; time, but reduced after the house patch is in as we do not have so many<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mules to hold the buildings).  Other than GM mage/tank mages in the<br/>\n&gt;guild,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; we also have several GM smiths, GM bowyers, GM alchemists, GM scribes,<br/>\n&gt;GM<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; bards (provokers), GM carpenters/tinkers etc.  We even have GM poisoner<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (assasin) and GM detective, hehe.  As as today, I still have a castle<br/>\n&gt;&gt; deed,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a keep deed and a tower deed reserved for future guild village in T2A,<br/>\n&gt;not<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to include other 2-S, big brick, big smithy house deeds ;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; We also own one of the most popular shops in Baja, The Asmandi (a big<br/>\n&gt;&gt; brick<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; house within west britain guard zone), which have more than 3000<br/>\n&gt;visitors<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; hits, selling only GM suberb stuffs at very reasonable price.  In the<br/>\n&gt;shop<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; we have standard price list which all vendors owners must comply<br/>\n&gt;(imagine<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 600gp for full AR30 plate set, all reagents at 1gp above npc shop etc)<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ensure the best quality stuffs sold as the most reasonable prices.  The<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; shop is also well-known for it Charity Chest (a shop wreck metal chest<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; locked-down in the shop), where players can leave their unwanted suffs<br/>\n&gt;so<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that newbies can find something useful from it.  Pls do not think that<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; chest is a trash bin, as newbies always find goodies inside, including<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; magical weapons ;)  I myself can throw 20-30 magical stuffs inside in<br/>\n&gt;one<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; shot.  The shop also provide free usage of training/thief dummies,<br/>\n&gt;forge,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; anvil etc open to all players.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If you play around Baja server down time, often you will see a horde of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; black horsemen in Cov entrance, Britain X-road or Britain cemetry, esp<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Cov,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; where we rules the place most of the time.  Our guild page is also the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; hosted in Singularity Game site.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Just wanna introduce tDw to more locals players ;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dark Flame<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The Dark Wardens Guild Master<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://reddawn.s-one.net.sg/uo/tdw/\">http://reddawn.s-one.net.sg/uo/tdw/</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; p/s: tDw is one of the most reputatable ANTIS guilds in Baja.
