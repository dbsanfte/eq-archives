Then<br/>\nI&#39;ll go Guk to camp for Slivered plate for Trifrost And Kellindel for a week<br/>\nbefore going back to PF again to lvl up to 30, then go SG hunting :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSereph, Bard desperate for platemail and more plat.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Goblins give a hell lot of money to teams. Solo, they don&#39;t give much cash.<br/>\n<br/>\nLKW wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Permafrost is quite a nice place for xp and loot (only refers to those<br/>\n&gt; tougher gobs beyond the flag room).  I spend 5 hrs there last night<br/>\n&gt; soloing, and half of the time I&#39;m the only soul in the zone.  If we can<br/>\n&gt; find a full house of lvl 18-22 to camp there, I believe all will lvl pretty<br/>\n&gt; fast.  The normal gob, thou mostly green to me, hit pretty hard.  I also<br/>\n&gt; lost count how many times I zone last night, due to train, probably more<br/>\n&gt; than 30 times ;)  The casters give pretty good loot and xp, and some even<br/>\n&gt; drop bronze armors.  Initially we go there as a 3 wiz, 1 magi, 1 bard and 1<br/>\n&gt; shaman team.  Frankly speaking the fire power is pretty strong but down<br/>\n&gt; time is long due to the fact that we have to tank alot and spend time<br/>\n&gt; resting and med.  I believe if we can get 2 real-tanks, life will be much<br/>\n&gt; easier.  The place got a good mixture of melee & caster mobs.  Tanks also<br/>\n&gt; have problem soloing due to the caster mobs.  Last night a lvl 20 shaman<br/>\n&gt; and a lvl 20 warrior come in as a group (the other is a lvl 17 wiz, solo),<br/>\n&gt; they also kena bang out of zone due to those gob diviner, medi and priest.<br/>\n&gt;  Those caster mobs&#39; HP is pretty low, can killed them normally within 2-3<br/>\n&gt; casts.  H/w, the tricky part is some of them heal VERY fast and hit VERY<br/>\n&gt; hard (lighting shock ~ 120dam per cast).  If u dun waste them b4 they heal<br/>\n&gt; themselves, u will find yaself in a very tough fight.  Tat&#39;s how the lvl 20<br/>\n&gt; warrior get killed at zone - he thought only 1 gob medi small fry and I was<br/>\n&gt; monitoring the gob medi HP.  I see it drop below 50% 3-4 times and when it<br/>\n&gt; heals, it go back to at least 75%.  In the end the warrior kena whacked<br/>\n&gt; till death.  Another problem that u need a caster in the group is becoz<br/>\n&gt; thos gob are very cunning mobs.  When u hit them to 10-20% hp, they sure<br/>\n&gt; flee into the tunnel, and within 30-60 sec, u will see a train of 3-5 gobs<br/>\n&gt; charging out ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I spend 5 hrs there (until 4am) just to fill up one bubb.  Unless there is<br/>\n&gt; kakis interested to camp there, I will go Lake to fight birdman tonight.<br/>\n&gt;  PF is very wulu wulu (thanks to Sereph&#39;s recommendation), usually not more<br/>\n&gt; than 10 (last night not even 5 during my 5 hrs stay) and it&#39;s really a<br/>\n&gt; power lvling ground for those who can survive.  Sereph said he spend a<br/>\n&gt; month there for his enchanter to gain from lvl 20 to 30, so must be good<br/>\n&gt; lah.  If u guys wanna bash SG like what Sereph&#39;s enchanter is doing, come<br/>\n&gt; join me, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p/s:  Unless u go beyond flag room and hunt, otherwise the loot is pretty<br/>\n&gt; lousy for those gob outside enar zone.  I earn less than 10pp last night<br/>\n&gt; for a 5 hrs hunt.  HH probably give much better loot but not as good xp for<br/>\n&gt; the lvl 20s.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Best Place to Buy Movies - Reel.com<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
