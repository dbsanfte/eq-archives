I chao chao also have endure EQ for nearly<br/>\n&gt; 2 years now and stil manage to tahan the camping etc..... by NOT camping for<br/>\n&gt; items unless friends are camping or if soloing for XP, spam guildsay or talk<br/>\n&gt; cock with other people.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They way with EQ is as you say level level level then at 50 camp items blah blah<br/>\n&gt; blah, but you can do other things like run around the various karana plains and<br/>\n&gt; admire the sight or enter a low level dungeon and help newbies survive, else if<br/>\n&gt; you everday camp item also can go gila.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can also do the long boring quest that eq has, heck, if you want to kill<br/>\n&gt; Lucan, just send a tell and I help take 1 HT from him before dying......<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Else do the most common thing people do when they are sick of EQ, restart! This<br/>\n&gt; time around, go more slowly, wait for kakis to join up, play a diferent class,<br/>\n&gt; go to other hunting grounds you have never hunt in before. This will make it<br/>\n&gt; slightly more enjoyable and is a good chance to meet up with new people.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The over level 30 population in Inno is now at at all time low with you<br/>\n&gt; leaving.......
