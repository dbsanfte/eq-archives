I <br/>\nmyself also use 400k-500k to power train my GM smith.  It&#39;s also not like <br/>\nlast time where u can spar with pets to rise melee skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nPower training to a kickass player in one month is not a problem, but <br/>\nunlike EQ, tactics do play an impt part in UO.  Lag is also a big issue <br/>\nhere.  I got 5 power-trained chars in UO, but lag also force me to migrate <br/>\ninto EQ.  I&#39;m now keeping the account hoping lag will improve in future, <br/>\nthen I will go back UO.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, 15 July, 1999 2:48 PM, Wilson [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ritzbits@...\">ritzbits@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Pardon me people.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hey LKW, if I head down to Baja, think you can scrap me into a kickass <br/>\n </span></blockquote>player in 1 month time?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wilson </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
