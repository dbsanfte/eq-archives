The goblin caster can be found at igloo located along the<br/>\nmountain near the big plain to Permafrost. For lvl 5 shaman , u ned at least 1<br/>\nppl to grp with u to survive, unless u chose to stand on surface and hunt the<br/>\nweaker gnolls (Not so good since lots of ppl r doing the same thing and oni 3<br/>\nor 4 gnoll spawn there) And be prepared to die a few times since there&#39;s<br/>\nalways train appearing and they loved to slice up lvl 5 shaman :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically once u reach lvl 5 , u ned to go BB to hunt . No choice here since<br/>\nthe monsters at everfrost con green when u reach lvl 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nDexter Wong wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Dexter Wong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dexterw@...\">dexterw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone has a character in Halas???
