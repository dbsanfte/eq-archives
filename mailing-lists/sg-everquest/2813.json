Have<br/>\nany of u experience bad lag?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ping/lag used to be very good until 2 days ago. Since then, everyday I went<br/>\nhome from work (around 8pm) and log into EQ, my lag meter show constant 60%<br/>\npacket lost for incoming and outgoing data. The strange thing is my ping is VERY<br/>\ngood, it&#39;s around 200-300 constantly for incoming and outgoing data. Because of<br/>\nthe huge packet lost, I was not able to enjoy the game. But things started to<br/>\nget better at around 10:45pm, my ping remains the same and my packet lost drop<br/>\ntill less than 10% for incoming and outgoing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is wrong with Magix? Should I switch to cable? Cable user pls comment.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
