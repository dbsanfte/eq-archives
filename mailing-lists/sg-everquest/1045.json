The marnek Dagger will only be needed for the next higer quest which includes the Skull of Jhen&#39;Tra from the gnoll embalmers and The Zaharns Coronet from the High Priest Himself at permafrost, Zaharns would have about 3 other lvl 31 with him. Sooo i dont think im doin that quest anytime soon. like 15 lvl more to go ? :P<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;ll loan the Dagger of Marnek to U till i hit lvl 35 Currently 20th only) or when i get another one , u can keep it.
