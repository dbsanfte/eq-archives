But discussion like the <br/>\nprevious msgs are also pretty fun and informative.  Frankly speaking high <br/>\nelven wiz is my all time favourite in AD&D but too bad it eats dust when <br/>\ncoming to EQ.  Only thru&#39; this kinda discussion then we can bring in <br/>\ndifferent sources of opinion & knowledge and every one gain from it ;)  So <br/>\ndun take the different views too hard, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nMondain<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Monday, June 14, 1999 4:42 PM, Wilson [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ritzbits@...\">ritzbits@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Wilson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ritzbits@...\">ritzbits@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, all of you give very good points. However, they all contradict each<br/>\n&gt; others&#39;. Like LKW and Sereph, both are solid facts but they &quot;kick&quot; each<br/>\n&gt; other. In the end, its each to his own. Why can&#39;t we just play a game for<br/>\n&gt; fun sake? But of course, who doesn&#39;t want to get all the goodies and hit<br/>\n&gt; Level 50 &lt;smiles&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; EG, Paldines was collecting dust because Gary found that Garren had <br/>\n </span></blockquote>better<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; strength to balance out his character in the long run.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, I just answered my question.

They have the harm spells<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which is as good as Paladin&#39;s healing ability (no saving throw or<br/>\n&gt; failure),<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yet they have the ability of regenerating HP ability.  I made a troll<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shaman in Innoruuk for testing, at lvl 1 my first victim is a monster<br/>\n&gt; which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is yellow to me.
