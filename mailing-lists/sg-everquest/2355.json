Slime crystal staff, dropped by a slime element in the bigger slime<br/>\npool<br/>\n&gt; in Runnyeye.  Garren know what is the mob lvl?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe slime crystal staff is not dropped by the slime elemental in Runnyeye.<br/>\nThe slime elemental in runnyeye drops the Beaded Slime Necklace +5 INT. The<br/>\nslime crystal staff is found in Beholder on King Xorbb. Rare spawn on 1 of<br/>\nthe 2 evil eye spots in beholder.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. Ice crystal staff, found in Permafrost. Fesse pls provide info so we<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; go see see look look when camping for runed circlet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought it for 50pp in auction. Currently collecting all the different<br/>\nelemental staffs. Found on ice goblin scryer in Perma. Low 20s i think.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3. The deceiver mask (cant remember exact name, turn u to DE).  Dropped by<br/>\n&gt; lower guk assasin.  Anyone got map to the spot? Also how tough is the<br/>\n&gt; assasin?<br/>\n<br/>\nGuise of the deceiver. Go to the dead side in lguk. Swim to bedroom, take<br/>\nthe leftmost path and hug the right wall until you see the 2 froglok ghoul<br/>\nwalk straight and turn left at the end. You will see a ladder up. Up the<br/>\nladder is the assassin/supplier room. There will be 3 spawn spots. Middle<br/>\nspot is supplier spot. Assassin is right spot. All the while you will need<br/>\ninvs to undead to make it there.<br/>\n<br/>\n*WARNING* Uniques can see through invis, just like the ghoul assassin, so<br/>\nget ready to rush up the ladder and start beating the froglok ghouls.<br/>\nUsually there will be 2 or 3 low lvl 30 froglok ghouls. The assassin is<br/>\nabout 35 and he can backstab for 80 X 2 and drops guise of the deceiver (brd<br/>\nrog wearable +12 cha (?) +7 sv magic ac4) as common and serrated bone dirk,<br/>\nrogues best weapon as rare. The supplier is also about 35 and drops some bag<br/>\n(8 slots and reduces 75% (?) weight) as common and the thick banded belt (+1<br/>\n5 str all/all weight 1.0(?)) as rare.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4. Hidden water tunnel in Paw.  It spawns named mobs.  Mob lvl not high<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; was thinking to go there see see look look when too bored in EQ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNever went Paw before. Cant say anything sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 5. Polished bone bracer.  Dropped by what mob, where?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEvil eye lords in Beholder. Rare drop (ac2 +3 wis +3 int) lords are about<br/>\nlevel 23-24.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 6. Fesse pls advise me the reasonable price for the following jewelry:<br/>\n&gt; - 7int/7str necklace<br/>\n&gt; - 4int earring (a pair)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlatinum sapphire necklace. Cost price is 105pp + 100pp = 205pp. Market<br/>\nprice can range anywhere from 600pp to 3000pp. 1200pp is a reasonable price<br/>\nfrom the jeweler to ask from you.<br/>\n<br/>\nGolden sapphire earring. Cost price is 10.5pp + 100pp = 110.5pp. Ranges from<br/>\n300pp to 1400pp. 600pp is a good price. 1000pp for 2 earrings.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the buyer, its always the cheaper the better. The best is to be a<br/>\njeweler yourself. Like me and just make yourself those items and forget<br/>\nabout the hassle of bargaining.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 7. Is there any INT bracers out there? Stats? Drop by who and where?<br/>\n<br/>\nBracelet of woven grass. (+3 int +12hp) froglok scryer in upperguk. easy<br/>\nkill. low 20s.<br/>\nGolden chitin bracers (+5 int +5 agi) noxious spider rare drop in solusek B.<br/>\nalso drops the green silken drape (?) as common. level 42+<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Just a feedback, my max dam with less than 30 1HB skill using the staff of<br/>\n&gt; writhing is 19 (melee) + 48 (chaotic effect), ie 67 dam per hit.  At such<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; low 1HB skill, the chaotic effect appears like once every 5 fights.  I<br/>\n&gt; still got 30 skill points with me (after dumping 90 skills points and<br/>\n&gt; 200+pp to rise my research skill from zero to 90 odd), wonder if I shld<br/>\n&gt; throw them all into 1HB (since I seldom melee but the skill does help alot<br/>\n&gt; when I try to kill mob for fractions).  Is there any skill a wiz shld look<br/>\n&gt; into at mid-30?<br/>\n<br/>\nDex + Skill in 1H blunt affects the chance of chaotic feedback from<br/>\nappearing. I used a cracked staff since level 1 to level 29 and I use it<br/>\nwhenever im in a group and my skill in 1h blunt is now 100. Doesnt seem to<br/>\nrise anymore. Anyway, for a wizard, its totally crap to use Staff of the<br/>\nobservers. Its a 2h blunt weapon (heavy like hell) that only gives +5 int.<br/>\nYou would be better off in a staff of the wheel (1h blunt and 1.0 weight) +<br/>\nglowing stein combo = 20int and adds other stats too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSave all your skill points from level 1. Put 1 into those that need to be<br/>\nstarted off and dont waste it on any others and just let time improve them.<br/>\nBecause at higher levels, these points will come in very handy. Max out<br/>\nresearch to 175 and Spec: evoc to 200 which will need quite a lot of skill<br/>\npoints. Then at the end of the day (level 50), you will have plenty of<br/>\npoints to mold your character as you like. (ie. maybe you would like to max<br/>\nout alteration for less fizzle evacs...)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMazy<br/>\nLevel 48 Wizard desperately collecting rods<br/>\nPrexus </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
