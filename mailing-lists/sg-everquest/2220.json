She is now a &quot;hunted&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;person by most of the high levels in the realm.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;She can be recognized by her new name Umriistin (or something like<br/>\nthat).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;She is the green eyed darkelf (the pretty one unforunately), wearing an<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;oracle robe, carrying a glowing stein and staff of writhing (same<br/>\ngraphic<br/>\n&gt; &gt;as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;POD&#39;s staff). She is in role-playing mode and may or may not still be in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;guild &lt;Qui&#39;Hadom&gt;(or however thats spelled). She is in the low level<br/>\n30s.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Why is she hunted by the high levels? Well, she tagged along on our<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;serverwide event of the slaying of Nagefen (40+ people involved). When<br/>\nwe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;killed 2 of the 3 named level 52 bosses, she looted them immediately<br/>\nonce<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;the killing party&#39;s loot period was over (they were NO DROP items, and<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;group that killed it didnt have priority over the item). Whats more, she<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;didnt admit to it when asked &quot;Who looted?&quot;. Even worse, when people SAW<br/>\n&gt; her<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;loot the 2nd kill (the 1st one noone saw because we still had to deal<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;fire giants after killing the boss monster), she denied and said she was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;ducking&quot;, thats 2 different and obvious graphics from ducking and<br/>\n&gt; looting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Then she pushed the blame to Holyomen saying he looted. But Holyomen was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;halfway across the room! So, Kelseferious was called in (after checking<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;his supervisor) and low and behold... he did an inventory check and u<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;guessed it! It was in her inventory! He destroyed it and created a new<br/>\n&gt; one<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;and gave it to its elected owner. We told her to leave after, but she<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;wouldnt (only dragon left at this time). She went invis and stood in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;corner. We couldnt do anything... so we went for nag... well, we failed<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;many died several times. During CR, our rogues actually found Maquis&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;corpse in lava under nagafen! We were overjoyed! We did everyones CR but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;hers, she deserved nothing less. Then we all gated out. Only leaving 2<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;people. One of them decided to take pity on her and actually managed to<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Maquis&#39;s corpse back! DAMN! Well, Umriistin has got her equipment back<br/>\n&gt; now,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;much to the dismay of the other 40 of us who wanted to leave her clothed<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;corpse in the lava to rot (even the GMs wont do anything). She alone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spoiled<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;what would have been an enjoyable event.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, this is just a warning to all u out there as to what this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;individual<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;is capable of. Whether u want to take heed to this or not is up to u. Im<br/>\n&gt; &gt;not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;in the mood to argue or debate about ethics and stuff. If u dont agree<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;me, so be it. If u do, just beware of this person. She hangs around<br/>\n&gt; bosses<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;and ninja loots them once the loot time is over. She has also been seen<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;around Solusek B and Cazic Thule recently. Oh and she does talk ALOT. Do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;check out the /ooc in these areas and u will probably see her talking<br/>\n&gt; away<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;(she never stops!). She trains alot too.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Silvera<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;One disgusted Lil Gnome<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist now has T-SHIRTS!<br/>\n&gt; For details and to order, go to:<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
