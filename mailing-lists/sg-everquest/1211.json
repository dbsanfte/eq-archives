I was invis all the way, as <br/>\nusual hehe, and saw this lvl 15 magi from Higher Order of Arcane, Amii and <br/>\nfew other players.  So I ask her is there any killing order which I can <br/>\njoin, she said no, it&#39;s FFA.  Ok fine then, I love FFA, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater when a trainer spawn, everyone rush in and this Amii also nuke with <br/>\nher pet, one force shock from me killed the mob.  I looted the mob and <br/>\nfound nothing.  Then this Amii keep asking me what lvl and I refused to <br/>\ntell her.  She then start to &#39;order&#39; me to take turns.  What is this man? <br/>\n When things are good for her, she ask for FFA, when thing turns against <br/>\nher she ask to take turn.  I didnt wanna refuse directly and keep saying <br/>\nsince she want FFA, it shalll be a FFA.  She then start shouting all over <br/>\nand say I&#39;m a stealer who is not willing to take turns.  Later, Einan join <br/>\nin the fun and managed to win the kill out of her, even he is actually 1 <br/>\nlvl below Amii, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis Amii is giving everyone lot of problem, and FF also told me she give <br/>\nhim hell lots of shit the night b4 when FF hunt at trainer hill.  Later she <br/>\neven auction to offer 2pp for anyone who hurt Dvinn to almost death, train <br/>\nit to her and zone off so that she can kill Dvinn for the loot and xp, LOL. <br/>\n Knn I will pay her 3pp to do it for me man.  To think she wear gossmer <br/>\nrobe at lvl 15, I dunno how many kills/SBS she already got after camping <br/>\nwhole day in trainer hill ;).<br/>\n<br/>\nI say, nuke the hell out of her, if anyone camp at CB, hahahahahaha!<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
