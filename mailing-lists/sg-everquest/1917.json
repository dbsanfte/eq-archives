I&#39;m <br/>\nusing the swap item as an example, cool down man ;)  I&#39;m just trying to <br/>\npoint out that, to u, ya matter is the most impt, but to other, they will <br/>\nto feel that way for their own matter.  Back to my illustration, if I&#39;ve <br/>\ncamp the shield for 5 hrs, and I know it will be dropped anytime in the <br/>\nnext hr, while someone need a help to retrieve his corpse, and this CAN be <br/>\ndone by other kakis online, I see no reason why ALL (including myself) have <br/>\nto drop what they are doing and come to ya rescue.  Whether in RL or in EQ, <br/>\nwe do have to be &#39;efficient&#39; sometimes. ;)  Helping a member to get his <br/>\ncorpse is not something that required ALL other kakis to participate.  Just <br/>\nlike in UO, do u respond to all SOS icq? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell if u still insist when there is a SOS msg, and expect ALL kakis online <br/>\nto rush to him, then I will perosnally think that my 5hrs camping is more <br/>\nimportant than saving that stupid corpse ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also very flexible in such things, but general guidelines must still be <br/>\nlay down.  Ah-hoc cases and individual members&#39; atttitude and playing style <br/>\nmust also be considered.  If you can name me any guild in EQ where ALL will <br/>\nrush to any SOS msg send in guildsay, tell me, I also wanan join ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
