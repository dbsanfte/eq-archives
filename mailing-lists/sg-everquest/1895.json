I will get to level 30 asap or <br/>\neven more and will not be stopping until i am happy with my level. It seems <br/>\nto be that when u have the level, camping any shit will be easy and you <br/>\ndont have to rely on anyones help.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is VERY true, once u got the lvl, u can start hunting for stuffs.  See <br/>\nI&#39;m still wearing my lvl 16 armor mainly?  See I undergo the power training <br/>\nin Lake Rathetear for the past weeks - I mixed so often with aviak guards <br/>\ntat pple start calling me birdman, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; some stuff bout the guild charter.<br/>\n&gt; 1. when a SOS (not to be abused) is being sent (e.g., such that a person <br/>\n </span></blockquote>died in a terrible spot and impossible to get back, then everyone is online <br/>\nand is capable MUST BE there to help irregardless of what dman thing u r <br/>\ndoing).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate to say this but i think the SOS WILL be abused.  No way to avoid. <br/>\n See too many abused case in UO and it will be the same in EQ (from the <br/>\nnewbies&#39; shouts every now and then).  I&#39;m totally against such SOS rescue <br/>\nwhere everyone online has to help regardless what u r doing. Imagine I can <br/>\nget up to 10 msg asking for party gate within 30 min I login (some even <br/>\ntell me &quot;ah finally wait till u login&quot;, LOL), no way I gonna response to <br/>\nevery SOS msg.  One of the most hated msg I get from UO is some newbie <br/>\nmembers SOS msg tat pop up on my screen every now and then.  This is esp <br/>\nworse in EQ when traveling is time-consuming, even with teleport spell we <br/>\nalso need time to run and find the corpse.  In UO, once I noticed any <br/>\nmember abusing this aid, I will let other veteran members know so as to let <br/>\nthem stay in dungeon as a ghost or learn to walk back to town and get <br/>\nresurrection ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally proposed those within the zone offer their help if only they <br/>\ncan help (eg was buying, selling or solo random hunting).  Imagine if I <br/>\nkill 24 orc trainer (5-6 hr waiting) in a row and I know SBS will spawn in <br/>\nthe next 2-3 spawn, I would think it will be better for the member to spend <br/>\n5-30 min searching his corpse instead.  Sometime it is more practice and <br/>\neffective to seek help from the zone rather than waiting for own member to <br/>\ndo it.  Eg 2 nights ago, I need someone to help in transferring stuffs from <br/>\nZil to my new char, I start with guildsay, no response.  I msg few kakis, <br/>\nsome no response, some response saying they r few zones away hunting, I <br/>\nalso didnt expect them to run all the way to help me, coz I think it&#39;s <br/>\nkinda impractical for them to do so.  In the end when I was abt to find a <br/>\nquiet place drop the item and login my new char to get it, I got msg from <br/>\nFF who is coming to GF for some camping and offer his help.  I&#39;m not trying <br/>\nto blame anyone but in such situation, I think it&#39;s perfectly alright to <br/>\nsolve the problem by myself, in the sense of efficiency and effectiveness. <br/>\n We all start as a newbie w/o helps, we learn thing the hard way.  As in <br/>\nUO, every hunting trips as a newbie, I walk with my kakis from town to <br/>\ndungeon, back to town b4 the last save.  When we all reach tank-mage stage <br/>\nand we start helping newbie members to mark rune, to gate them here and <br/>\nthere.  So much so tat in the end they dun even know how to walk from <br/>\ndungeon to town if they get killed as a lvl 8 caster and no member online <br/>\n;)  Just to share my personal experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. i also suggest someone to be in-charge of hunts and stuff (one of the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>officers, thats i propose Ziltus and one other person).<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, gotta turn down this job abt hunting and stuffs.  I dun mind doing <br/>\nsome recruiting job, PROVIDED I am available to do the recruiting, since <br/>\nwiz has the advantage of travelling spells.  H/w, UO event organiser is <br/>\nenuff for me.  During my time as a GM, I hold more events than the total <br/>\nevents organised by the rest of the guild.  Now for EQ, I dun mind doing <br/>\npart-time, esp during this transition period when QHD dun have much <br/>\nactivities, but I guess I wont wanna be the official person in charge, heh, <br/>\nthx for the nomination tho&#39; ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. As for banking and equipment, i propsed those 2 person, instead of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>using their banks, get them to create a char just for the purpose of <br/>\nbanking. So it will be easier for them to keep track of money and stuff and <br/>\nthose money is not to be abused. We can have a store of items and LOAN them <br/>\nto members in the guild (e.g., RTS and other stuff), when these members are <br/>\ncapable of geting one, they will return it or pass it to another member <br/>\nrequiring it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLoaning items is abit difficult in EQ, due to:<br/>\n- Not easy to meet to borrow and return stuffs.<br/>\n- Loading a char in EQ can be quite time consuming, unlike UO.  So if the <br/>\nperson in charge need to logout and relogin the storeman char, it will post <br/>\nsome kinda inconveniences for the player.  Due to the limited items slot in <br/>\nEQ (unlike UO where only wt limit), it&#39;s not easy to keep stuffs too, esp <br/>\nlore item like RTS, u can only keep 1 per char.  I think it will be more <br/>\neffective for higher lvl to help lower lvl to get some cool items once in a <br/>\nwhile, and provided the lower lvl can physically participate the hunting <br/>\n(and not turning it to a corpse looting session).  Of coz, for those lower <br/>\nlvl, dun expect to get something more than 5 lvls than u la.  If a lvl 1 <br/>\nwanna get JBoot, I think even if u got a lvl 50 wiz with u, it&#39;s also <br/>\ndifficult for him to even bring u to see Najena.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; NOTE: i have a slightly crazy idea bout something. Instead of creating <br/>\n </span></blockquote>one guild, we will form 2 guilds. one for lower levels, one higher. All our <br/>\nlow level chars will form one and high level another. maybe level 1-20 one <br/>\nguild, 20 upwards another (or maybe even make it level 30). This way, we <br/>\ncan recruit newbies and train them the way of our guild. if our guild is <br/>\nactive all the time and is nice to all of the folks, i dont believe there <br/>\nis any reason for them to quit the guild. That will continue to point 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm, pardon me, I dun see the need to create 2 guilds, since we dun have to <br/>\nstart a warfare sub-division like in UO for guild war (to protect those <br/>\nnon-war chars).  Actually it shld be alright to have all lvl in the guild. <br/>\n Plus the fact tat with our own kakis, we dun have to hide where we r <br/>\nhunting.  As long as u got the lvl requirement for hunt, u are most welcome <br/>\nto join us (which mean we must have strict recruitment to get only those <br/>\ntrust-worthy and loyal kakis la).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4. We will help lower levels folks to break spwan and stuff BUT it doesnt <br/>\n </span></blockquote>mean helping them to kill all the stuff and let them loot for many many <br/>\nhours. Crap stuff like RTS i say it doesnt hurt to let most members have, <br/>\nBUT if we are talking bout FBRs or more useful items as we gain more power, <br/>\nthen that we must state a certain level or unless they can get it <br/>\nthemselves (usually this is a few levels b4 they can get it themselves).<br/>\n<br/>\nTat&#39;s why I organise the RTS hunt and limit the hunt to those above lvl 12 <br/>\n ;)  Problem is, in order to prevent camping, EQ is patched anti-camp. <br/>\n During the last trip, we camp for 2 hrs or so (?) and not even a RTS or <br/>\nskull.  YY mentioned webclaw spaw at 10 min interval, which sound very <br/>\ntempting for me to get it, hehe.  Kellendil also got a WCS liao, maybe u <br/>\ncan share with us how u got it (how u kill it, melee, nuke or wat), where <br/>\n(which part of Lake)?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5. i have also by chance came to talk to the guildmaster of Disciples of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Discord. All members are red (PvP). So if any members decided to be funny  <br/>\n with the guild or spoil the reputation of the guild then they will be <br/>\nhunted down for the rest of their fucking EQ lives That i believe is <br/>\nsomewhat good protection, but it requires members to be PvP and ourselves <br/>\nto be also which is a bad thing or good thing. IF ANY MEMBERS CREATE <br/>\nTROUBLE FOR THE GUILD, THEY ARE BANNED FROM THE GUILD. NOT REMOVED.so they <br/>\nwont have their other chars pretend and join our guild again and get to <br/>\ncheat the guild and stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy stand is to remain non-PvP, even until I reach lvl 50 ;)  Personally I <br/>\ndun really enjoy PvP all time, but some duels here and there shld be ok ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 6. we certainly dont want war with other guilds. if we dont steal kills <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and stuff i dont forsee a guildwar happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo many stealers in EQ, and so far I havent heard any war starts due to <br/>\nkill stealing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 7. Make it unique, maybe someone that wants to be officer or elder or <br/>\n </span></blockquote>watever u call that, he must be highly nominated by 2/3 of the elder/ <br/>\nofficer council OR he can gain it by challenging one to a duel and WIN IT. <br/>\n=) some pvp action. if the guild gets large enough, we can have some sort <br/>\nof arena fights n stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm, lvls or PvP capablity shldnt be the factor used to determine officer <br/>\npost.  No use asking a lvl 50 wiz who win the duel for the position, go ard <br/>\nmaking havoc and spoil guild reputation until we dismiss him - damange <br/>\nalready  done to our reputation.  Instead, leadership, commitment, loyalty <br/>\nand contribution shld be looked into when determining the officer <br/>\ncandidates.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 8. ok i said enough, now bloody feedback for all i have said...<br/>\n&gt; p/s: cant imagine i went on a camping trip and gain one level =) and also <br/>\n </span></blockquote>found some true friends and jerks...<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like tax and death in RL, you see friends and jerks everywhere in EQ <br/>\n;)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
