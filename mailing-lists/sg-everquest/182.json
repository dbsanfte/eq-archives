I<br/>\nlike spell plays in RPG , but  i have only 2 hours a nite to play EQ. so a<br/>\n&quot;quickie&quot; char would be ideal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI looked thru all the pros and cons of all the Chars types on EQ, Both evil<br/>\nand the  good. I was very interested in the Cleric and Shadow Knight char.<br/>\nYou know , the special effects department. :) , Cleric is ALLWAYS in demand<br/>\nfor thier skills and the S.Knight kick ass.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, i thought the monk is simple enuff. No need to memories spells, mana ,<br/>\nweapons, etc.now i have to save money to buy armor . i dont need weapons<br/>\nlike swords and staff. but  still needs money. Currently , im about 30 pp in<br/>\nthe red  :-P<br/>\n<br/>\nMonks will be a really powerful after the 20 lvl , with 100 skill points in<br/>\nthe mend , a good dual wield and double punch. It goin to kick ass. For now,<br/>\nthe progress is slow but steady. I something look in envy of other char type<br/>\nof the same lvl. hell, they do much more damages than a monk....for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts to get off my chest. What&#39;s yours?<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk&#39;eying around.<br/>\n&quot;Yiyang&quot; the munk fro Freeport, Innorruk.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
