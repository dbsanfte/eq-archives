I did notice the excitement we<br/>\n&gt; once had b4 is not there no more. partly the game is not as<br/>\n&gt; interesting anymore.these r just thoughts. i didnt think them thru .<br/>\n&gt; just jot it down as it comes to mind. no spell checks too.1) Lvling<br/>\n&gt; and lvling , nothing but just lvling.....sux.2) questing is much more<br/>\n&gt; interesting(personal perference).i think with a small group is even<br/>\n&gt; better.3) I dun mind NOT lvling sometimes. , I enjoy beening able to<br/>\n&gt; PL some of u guys at mobs. its fun in group of local kakis. no xp..<br/>\n&gt; big deal :P4) I have group with Galarion, Kailli, Avengeline and Kalli<br/>\n&gt; at lake. I hope to group again with them.But my nite game timely sux.<br/>\n&gt; long time ago...was with Leshrec , Zandaerion adn the gang.....5) I<br/>\n&gt; make friends with other guild and indiviuals...enemies too.. lol. I<br/>\n&gt; get invits to some guild grouping at times.6) Guild outing ,  i<br/>\n&gt; suggest should be a quest or specific mob target, LOWER (blue) for<br/>\n&gt; most so it doent become  corpse retriveing excerise. Whats the point ?<br/>\n&gt; low blue? propbaly items got already? well. the point is we do things<br/>\n&gt; together. pass the stuff to lower level, sell them whatever.hell,<br/>\n&gt; start a guild war!. Just enjoy.7) wanna hit 50th lvl? now at 35th..<br/>\n&gt; hey . spend another 6 months lor. if not what to do?( see above)8) i<br/>\n&gt; enjoy lvl 15th to 25th the most. why?9) will all of us be around EQ 6<br/>\n&gt; months from now? some. prob. 50%. maybe less10) Im waiting for a cool<br/>\n&gt; new on-line game. pull some of u guys along. We need new refreshing<br/>\n&gt; STUFF!11) one day...... Im nerfing EQ. and u know what?  im NOT<br/>\n&gt; patching it. BiBi  .,...going out of his mind..... psss..

We either need more ppl or we need more guild<br/>\n&gt;      events.Probably the former.Problem is Ziltus and Leshrec no<br/>\n&gt;      longer play their wizards. Fesse is also semi retired.I<br/>\n&gt;      already have problems finding ppl to group with as it has<br/>\n&gt;      been last few weeks. Also we dont seem to havemuch of an<br/>\n&gt;      enthusiasm. No offence but i think some things need fixing.<br/>\n&gt;      Or maybe i&#39;m the only one feeling it hmm... Unlike a few<br/>\n&gt;      guilds i&#39;ve come to know...we really haven&#39;t had much of a<br/>\n&gt;      union as a guild. Lvls pobably play onepart as it prevents<br/>\n&gt;      effective guild outings. Other is we seem to have bad luck<br/>\n&gt;      with any so far hehe. I&#39;d like and hope to see something<br/>\n&gt;      good that can be done for us all...if not maybe one day i<br/>\n&gt;      might just leave..no offence i like you guys but i need to<br/>\n&gt;      be able to have some fun too..it&#39;s hardly fun anymore now<br/>\n&gt;      for me.I&#39;ll still be on mailing list if i ever leave and i<br/>\n&gt;      will still give my best at providing any info that no one<br/>\n&gt;      might haveor help if i ever can... Of course that&#39;s only if<br/>\n&gt;      i leave (which is unlikely) but i&#39;d thought i just bring it<br/>\n&gt;      up to you all to be fair...Thaks for your time Zanderion<br/>\n&gt;      Stormseekerlvl 36 mage and yes double xp penalty for dying<br/>\n&gt;      after every hell lvl...ARGH!just found that out when one<br/>\n&gt;      whole bubble disappeared<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
