BTW... count me in... in ya guild.... i should be in the same server as u guys... but i guess i will be progressing slowly... most likely i will be using SilverHand. :)<br/>\n    <br/>\n    Also, not sure about Trade Skills... anyone has any advice fer Necros? Also, u think it will be better to have 1 trade skills on a char rather than 2? or does it matter? thats all i got fer now...<br/>\n    <br/>\n    cheers,<br/>\n    Fred<br/>\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n    SC Cheng, Freddy<br/>\n    Mobile-Internet Laboratory, Multimedia Laboratory,<br/>\n    NTT DoCoMo R&D Center C212,<br/>\n    3-5, Hikari no Oka, Yokosuka-Shi,<br/>\n    Kanagawa, 239-8536, Japan<br/>\n    Tel : +81 468-40-3497<br/>\n    Fax: +81 468-40-3788<br/>\n    Email : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
