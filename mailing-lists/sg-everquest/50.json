As for guild meeting, we hope as <br/>\nmany members can join as possible, but we expected much lesser coz members <br/>\ncome from all timezone, hard for them to login at certain time.  That&#39;s the <br/>\nmain reason why we have timezone commanders, so that when the local <br/>\npioneers not online, other trust-worthy members can lead the guild ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;Hehehe, I lost my 2-storey and I was really sad cos I hardly play and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; took long to save up...not to mention what was in my chests etc! Now to<br/>\n&gt; EQ...<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah I understand...if I lost my main houses, most probably I will quit too. <br/>\n It&#39;s a 2-S & small smithy blocked by mountain, build more than a yr ago. <br/>\n I got my own mining space which no one else can enter.  Even bug users <br/>\ncan&#39;t break in as they cannot even reach my door steps.  In house got 20 <br/>\nover bags of GM assasin poisoned GM smith weapons/bows, more than 15 bags <br/>\nof magical stuffs (1/3 is silver), 10 over vanq weap, 20 over bags of GM <br/>\nalchemist potions (2/3 are GH and GE), &gt;5k reg each, tons of house add-on <br/>\ndeeds etc etc.  Even though I got 3 over million worth of GPs in bank (coz <br/>\nof house deeds), if I kena looted, also very sian to restart everything and <br/>\ngo around buying/making the stuffs again...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Basic Inventory is 8 spaces/slots. To widen it, you will have to put a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>bag<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in a slot to make it have more space since a bag itself has 4-8slots. So <br/>\n </span></blockquote>max<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is 8x8 = 64 slots. To transfer items amg chars, it like UO, drop is in a<br/>\n&gt; secluded place then pick it up before it vanishes. Or just do Friend to<br/>\n&gt; Yourself.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah, so no house to store stuffs.  Can misc items (like potions) be stacked? <br/>\n I presumed it will then required 1-2 mules to act like storage house? ;) <br/>\n Or there are much lesser stuffs in EQ that i dun need much storage space?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;Why the MSG Board since we already have this list? Pardon me...<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Msg board allowed everyone to read and leave their msg, and it can store <br/>\nmuch more stuffs unlike email which once u deleted, it&#39;s gone fast.  Also, <br/>\nsometime several pple replies to one query and the msg roll big very fast. <br/>\n For eg, if I start a topic asking which server to start off, many players <br/>\nwill reply to this list and the topics may end up several emails.  But in <br/>\nmsg board, it&#39;s more organised.  We used to think of starting a mailing <br/>\nlist for guild, but end up with 2 msg boards coz members find it easier to <br/>\ncommunicate.  Anyway it&#39;s just a supplement to this mailing list, not a <br/>\nreplacement ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDF</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
