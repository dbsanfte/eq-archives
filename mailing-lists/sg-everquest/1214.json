I have been observing this<br/>\n&quot;stealin&quot; trend . The bottom line is usually 2 things 1) lvling-xp  2) loot<br/>\nitems. Well, the others cool stuffs in EQ is often neglected. LOL  , some<br/>\ndoes,nt even know whats &quot;life&quot; outside of Xp and loots.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs more player lvl upwards., prime named mobs will be the main target of<br/>\n&#39;desire&#39; . there  r only a handful of named mob with special items on then<br/>\nas compared to a orc or Derv camp of 5-6 mobs. Stealin is gotta get  very<br/>\nvery bad. Its not goin to get any better.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow we, an individual and as a Guild/Group distinguish ourselves is the<br/>\npoint here. I believe we should established ourselves as a dignified group<br/>\nof people who  stands up against unethical thievery .<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone like Voyerbian has no place among us. Unless he repent of his ways.<br/>\nThe loud mouth type of people like &quot;Amii&quot;  is just  plain ol&#39; loud mouth. we<br/>\nstake our stand and give this type of ppl hell. we tracked them down . train<br/>\nmob to them(ethical?) and make their life hell if need be.<br/>\n<br/>\nANy one of u spoken to Wylven besides Ziltus about Voy?  Qui H&#39;oom dai aint<br/>\ntoo bad, with almost 60 members it gives us access to a bigger pool of ppl<br/>\nto group . Wylven is not a bad guy too. BUT if it comes to the crunch im for<br/>\nu guys to have our guild. U hav emy support......  and a contribution of<br/>\n1pp.....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYiyang<br/>\nMonk&#39;eying at RiverVale<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;* Singapore EQ Mailing List&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, July 14, 1999 11:09 AM<br/>\nSubject: [sg-everquest] FFA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hey guys, just to share an &#39;interesting&#39; thing I came across last night.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;B4 I met Garren and the guys for Dragoon Dirk hunt, I went to trainer hill,<br/>\n&gt;hoping to get an SBS for some quick buck.  I was invis all the way, as<br/>\n&gt;usual hehe, and saw this lvl 15 magi from Higher Order of Arcane, Amii and<br/>\n&gt;few other players.  So I ask her is there any killing order which I can<br/>\n&gt;join, she said no, it&#39;s FFA.  Ok fine then, I love FFA, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Later when a trainer spawn, everyone rush in and this Amii also nuke with<br/>\n&gt;her pet, one force shock from me killed the mob.  I looted the mob and<br/>\n&gt;found nothing.  Then this Amii keep asking me what lvl and I refused to<br/>\n&gt;tell her.  She then start to &#39;order&#39; me to take turns.  What is this man?<br/>\n&gt; When things are good for her, she ask for FFA, when thing turns against<br/>\n&gt;her she ask to take turn.  I didnt wanna refuse directly and keep saying<br/>\n&gt;since she want FFA, it shalll be a FFA.  She then start shouting all over<br/>\n&gt;and say I&#39;m a stealer who is not willing to take turns.  Later, Einan join<br/>\n&gt;in the fun and managed to win the kill out of her, even he is actually 1<br/>\n&gt;lvl below Amii, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This Amii is giving everyone lot of problem, and FF also told me she give<br/>\n&gt;him hell lots of shit the night b4 when FF hunt at trainer hill.  Later she<br/>\n&gt;even auction to offer 2pp for anyone who hurt Dvinn to almost death, train<br/>\n&gt;it to her and zone off so that she can kill Dvinn for the loot and xp, LOL.<br/>\n&gt; Knn I will pay her 3pp to do it for me man.  To think she wear gossmer<br/>\n&gt;robe at lvl 15, I dunno how many kills/SBS she already got after camping<br/>\n&gt;whole day in trainer hill ;).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I say, nuke the hell out of her, if anyone camp at CB, hahahahahaha!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ziltus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Attention ONElist list owners!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html</a><br/>\n&gt;Check out the new &quot;DEFAULT MODERATED STATUS&quot; option.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
