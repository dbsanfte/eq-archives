Garren know what is the mob lvl?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Ice crystal staff, found in Permafrost. Fesse pls provide info so we can <br/>\ngo see see look look when camping for runed circlet.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. The deceiver mask (cant remember exact name, turn u to DE).  Dropped by <br/>\nlower guk assasin.  Anyone got map to the spot? Also how tough is the <br/>\nassasin?<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Hidden water tunnel in Paw.  It spawns named mobs.  Mob lvl not high but <br/>\nwas thinking to go there see see look look when too bored in EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Polished bone bracer.  Dropped by what mob, where?<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Fesse pls advise me the reasonable price for the following jewelry:<br/>\n- 7int/7str necklace<br/>\n- 4int earring (a pair)<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Is there any INT bracers out there? Stats? Drop by who and where?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a feedback, my max dam with less than 30 1HB skill using the staff of <br/>\nwrithing is 19 (melee) + 48 (chaotic effect), ie 67 dam per hit.  At such a <br/>\nlow 1HB skill, the chaotic effect appears like once every 5 fights.  I <br/>\nstill got 30 skill points with me (after dumping 90 skills points and <br/>\n200+pp to rise my research skill from zero to 90 odd), wonder if I shld <br/>\nthrow them all into 1HB (since I seldom melee but the skill does help alot <br/>\nwhen I try to kill mob for fractions).  Is there any skill a wiz shld look <br/>\ninto at mid-30?<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
