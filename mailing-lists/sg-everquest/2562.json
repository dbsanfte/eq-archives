Let&#39;s face <br/>\nit, there isn&#39;t much we can do in EQ others than the 3 things I mentioned. <br/>\n With those coming major patch in UO, I start to think UO is a much better <br/>\ngame (esp in term of role-playing elements).  I can organise tournaments, <br/>\nPvP training, PK hunting, server wars, big sales in my guild shop Asmandi, <br/>\nor even spend time training my craftman char (yes, you can earn big buck in <br/>\nUO by role-playing a trademan).  Other than the hunting, most of the other <br/>\nelements in EQ are kinda screwed - economy is unrealistic, merchants are <br/>\neating grass, guild war are not well-established, grp hunting for more than <br/>\n1 grp damn messy.  In fact, now I start to think the lvl limitation in EQ <br/>\nis not as team-friendly as UO (probably due to UO is skill-based while EQ <br/>\nis lvl-based).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs stated in CGW few months back, EQ is a great hack & slash RPG, where <br/>\nhunting will  take up 80% of the events (the bulk of the remaining time <br/>\nspend on idleing and running, hehe), while UO has much deeper RPG elements. <br/>\n I think both games are great, and depending on my perference, EQ just give <br/>\nme a feeling that it has lesser &#39;keep-on-playing&#39; value.  In fact, the <br/>\ninitial reasons I came to EQ from UO is becoz UO is laggy, and I got a <br/>\ndemi-god acct in UO, nothing more to do.  H/w, after coming to EQ, I <br/>\nnoticed I grow bored even faster, hehe.  Now with the coming new feature of <br/>\nUO, I&#39;ll for sure go back to UO.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think my wiz is a high, err, very high lvl char, but I have no <br/>\nproblem doing most of the things I wanna do - travelling all ard, lvling <br/>\nsololy, KS (if I want), grping etc.  I think I&#39;m those kind who like to <br/>\nsolo at least half the time, and yet able to grp with others when team-work <br/>\nis required (That&#39;s why I never select bard, which is a almost grp-based <br/>\nchar.  No offence DF, just personal perference, heh).  In UO, I also spend <br/>\nmore than half the time doing my own stuffs, and UO does have lots of <br/>\nthings for me to do sololy, other than hunting/lvling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I need to cut my gaming expense.  I&#39;ve been crazy for the past 2 <br/>\nyrs, playing so many online RPG (max record is 3 UO accts and 1 EQ acct). <br/>\n I think I need to spend more time with family.  I&#39;ve already terminated my <br/>\n2nd UO acct, and will do the same for my 3rd UO acct.  I&#39;m still keeping my <br/>\nmain UO acct, since it is my &quot;blood & tear baby&quot; for 2 yrs.  As for EQ...I <br/>\nguess I will con&#39;t to hold on to end of this yr, I try.  If there aren&#39;t <br/>\nmuch good new attractions, I guess I will sell away the acct by end of Dec <br/>\n99.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m now looking for those session RPG online game like Neverwinter night <br/>\n(Baldur&#39;s Gate like), Diablo 2 and few others cool games coming this X&#39;mas <br/>\nseason.  Basically I wish to avoid touching those games which will get me <br/>\naddicted day and night (boy you can&#39;t imagine I wake up 3 times a night <br/>\nmacroing my GM smith, for more than a week), those &#39;full-time online RPG&#39;s <br/>\nlike UO and EQ.  Good thing about &#39;session&#39; online RPG is that you can play <br/>\nfor 2-3 hrs and forget abt it, and doesn&#39;t cost you an extra cent.  I even <br/>\nbuy Baldur&#39;s Gate expansion last night, thinking of solving it over the <br/>\nweekend (I complete Baldur&#39;s Gate solo, since too many cheaters in the <br/>\nnet).  I&#39;m also looking for good scary adventure games (seem dying off now, <br/>\nthe only title I&#39;m expecting is Gabriel Knight 3), any recommendation?<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ is a nice game, and I&#39;m glad to know so many PERVERT kakis in the game. <br/>\n I believe there is still chances for us to meet again other than EQ.  Oh <br/>\nwell, this msg sound as if I&#39;m quiting, hell NO, not at this time, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow back to the main thing.  Frankly speaking I enjoy the guild as it is <br/>\nnow ;P.  Like I say, I&#39;m those who enjoy soloing but yet grping sometimes <br/>\nwhen required.  I want to be able to solo or grp with others.  Currently <br/>\nthis is how I play in EQ.  Not that I&#39;m anti-social, I will still give <br/>\nfull-support to whatever guild events, provided I&#39;m logging in ;P<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guild is good, the guildsay spaming even better - best is all the <br/>\nlow-lifeform conversation and pervert talks, haha.  I really enjoy been in <br/>\nthe guild.  Let&#39;s hope EQ will come up with something better - and worth my <br/>\npayment every month other than my UO acct.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus Planeswalker<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: I strongly recommend Jagged Alliance 2.  It&#39;s a solid game for real <br/>\nhardcore gamers.  If you looking for brainless/rushing strategy game, you <br/>\ncan forget abt it.  This game required LOTS of planning and coordination, <br/>\neven if you play the easiest level.  There are many non-linear missions and <br/>\nquests for you to enjoy.  I&#39;ll say this is the best strategy game I come <br/>\nacross this yr (ok, I admit I dun play alot of strategy games this yrs, but <br/>\nI play all big titles like C&C2, AOE2, Warzone 2100 etc).  Btw, it&#39;s a solo <br/>\nturn-based strategy game, no multiplayer feature. Abit slow paced but trust <br/>\nme, you NEED the slow pace for ya brain to work, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wednesday, 13 October, 1999 10:38 PM, Alex [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leealex@...\">leealex@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have not been playing for 3 days.
