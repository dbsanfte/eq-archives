Now my wiz is lvl 3.  So far I&#39;ve spend my practice points on 2H <br/>\nblunt, chanelling, adjure, evoke and alter.  I still have 10 points with <br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestion what other skills to train?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how the skills thingy work, if there is a total skill cap for <br/>\nyour char.  I wish to learn some  $$$ skills which do not required much $$$ <br/>\n(eg on buying material, initial investment and l/t investment), any <br/>\nsuggestion?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I didnt spend any practice points in melee skills.  I started off <br/>\nwith a dagger and when I earn enuff $$$ to buy worn great stave, I keep on <br/>\nusing it.  The skills rise when I hunt with the staves.  I would also like <br/>\nto seek advice if it&#39;s worth to train unarmed melee skills for wiz (like in <br/>\nmonk).  If there is a total skill cap, I will try to specialize in 1 or 2 <br/>\nmelee skills.  If not skill cap, I dun mind training unarmed combat skill <br/>\nsince after the newbie period, I wouldn&#39;t resurrect with a dagger, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny recommendation what spells are good for wiz?  Also, is there any way to <br/>\nmake medation a hotkey? (sorry for those who reply me on my previous <br/>\nmediation query, I need to ask again coz I dunno what u mean)<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, my wiz is a high-elf, name is Ziltus, after his long-lost brother <br/>\nZilred (enchanter) ;)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
