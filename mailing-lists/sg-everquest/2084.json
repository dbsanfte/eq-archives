This npc drop the<br/>\n&gt; Teant Stave which has Root effect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Been greedy and impatient, I start by root it and nuke all the way (b4<br/>\n&gt; others see it and start attacking it and when I get the kill call me Kill<br/>\n&gt; Stealer...).  Normal teant will die after 500-600 dam nuking but this one,<br/>\n&gt; after nuking for more than 800-1000 dam, is still alive!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After I OOM, die die melee with it, and most tu-long is tat it killed me<br/>\n&gt; with less than 3% HP!!!  KNN!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shld I be more patient and cast Leatherskin (give me 200HP), I would have<br/>\n&gt; killed it instead it killed me, sigh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Been in SK so many times, this is the 1st time I meet this rare spawn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just a lesson to share with all - be patient and plan, or we are just<br/>\n&gt; wasting time looting our corpse.  And remember server down last night?<br/>\nAnd<br/>\n&gt; how big SK is?  I die ard 15 min b4 server down and lucky managed to get<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; corpse back before server down (thanks to my sense direction and loc<br/>\n&gt; skills), otherwise I cannot sleep ;P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nevertheless I still lost half a bubb xp for this fatal mistake I made -<br/>\n&gt; another 2 hrs hunting in HH.  The only good thing is tat, been so moody<br/>\n&gt; after the death, I dun bother to wait for server to come up and play.  In<br/>\n&gt; the end sleep at 11pm plus and wake up this morning FRESH AND ENERGETIC!!!<br/>\n&gt; ;))<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tonight gonna power train my wiz to 30 b4 the hunts.  I will be in HH keep<br/>\n&gt; warrior room early, probably b4 8pm, till morning ;)  Die die must<br/>\nlvl!!!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus Planeswalker<br/>\n&gt; Still tu-long over the incident of letting the teant stave &#39;fly&#39; away from<br/>\n&gt; his hands....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html\">http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html</a><br/>\n&gt; With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
