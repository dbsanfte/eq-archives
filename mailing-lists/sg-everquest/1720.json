To get to the tower isle, you have to swim across the whole lake.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Danger arise when u meet some giant fresh sharks (bigger size than <br/>\n </span></blockquote>orge)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; frogloks, aqua goblin, water snakes, or worse, Webclaw itself and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Froglok<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; Prince (lvl 30 plus, very powerful, con red, and very very agro, out <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; kill EVERYTHING in lake).  This problem can be overcome by taking a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>boat<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; from gnoll camp to tower isle (but take much longer).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; b.
