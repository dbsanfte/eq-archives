After playing EQ for a month or so, I guess it&#39;s time for us to <br/>\nponder abit on how we can play & enjoy EQ better, in term of adventuring, <br/>\ngrouping, lvling or camping for artifacts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe the local kakis are lvling pretty fast, some even managed to <br/>\ntrain 2 or more mid-lvl chars by now within the short period.  This is most <br/>\nobvious when we take a look in QHD, where the local kakis lvl much faster <br/>\nthan the other members (without stealing kills).  H/w, I think there is <br/>\nstill room for improvement, in all areas.  In this msg, I will only be <br/>\nfocusing on group(s) hunting, so as to get the BALLS start rolling (wait, <br/>\nYY kena scared by ya wife until ya balls drop again? hehehe).<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Be realistic.<br/>\nSo far, all the hunting events turn out to be a corpse looting session, <br/>\nwhich take up more than 50% of the hunt.  IMGO (in my goon opinion), I <br/>\nthink everyone has to be realistic.  If we are going to camp for a lvl 20 <br/>\nmob, and we know that in order to reach the mob, we need to go thru&#39; <br/>\nseveral lvl 15 mobs, it&#39;s definitely inefficient to bring along any lvl 18 <br/>\nor below kakis coz we will then be spending most of the time protecting the <br/>\nlower lvl kakis, if not helping him/her to loot corpse.  For eg, to camp <br/>\nfor Dvinn, a lvl 20 mob, it will be best to bring in a team of all lvl 20 <br/>\nand above, so that we can concentrate our time camping for the mob, hunt it <br/>\ndown and get out of the place FAST, since all other mobs will not attack u <br/>\nas they con green to us.  (NB:  This point exclude those hunting event <br/>\nwhich we are out to wipe and rule the whole place.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Be grateful to those who help, be considerate<br/>\nEveryone on the list is paying for the EQ monthly usage, the telephone fee, <br/>\nand many hrs of sleepless night playing the game. If a group of tanks of <br/>\nenuff lvl wish to hunt certain mob but need a high lvl caster to help <br/>\nnuking the mob, I think it&#39;s only fair if the low lvl tanks show their <br/>\nappreciation by offering some token to the high lvl who help.  Just like  <br/>\n the Staff of Observer hunt, I think it&#39;s only fair for Garren if we paid <br/>\nhim some nominal amt for his time and service.  Whether he wanna accept the <br/>\ntoken is another story, it&#39;s the thought that counts.  Friend friend is one <br/>\nthing, but this friend thingy shldnt be abused.  Can anyone imagine Garren <br/>\nget msg every now and then asking him to get stuffs for his friends? <br/>\n  C&#39;mon, not tat I&#39;m calculative but we shld learn to appreciate helps from <br/>\nothers, and be considerate at times ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Most people don&#39;t PLAN to fail, but they fail to PLAN<br/>\na. See the key word? PLAN PLAN PLAN! ;)  Before any event, someone pls at <br/>\nleast dig out some info of the artifact, quest or the mob dropping the item <br/>\nfrom the net - it&#39;s easily accessible.<br/>\nb. Be puntual.  Ok I know this is hard, esp when we have students, working <br/>\nclass, idling personal (ops sorry Garren, hehe) etc in the local community. <br/>\n That&#39;s why I always plan events on Fri/Sat night, where most pple are free <br/>\nand dun have to worry abt working the next day.  Getting the relevant lvl <br/>\nplayers to participate in the event is also impt, so that no time is waste <br/>\nto fetch other pple.  If u wanan participate in the event, at least arrange <br/>\nto meet those who know the assembly venue to bring u there, IN ADVANCED. <br/>\n Dun wait till last mintue than msg all say &quot;I&#39;m at xxx, can someone come <br/>\nto fetch me blah blah blah&quot;.  If my UO members from all over the world can <br/>\nmeet at certain time (some even wake up at 4am for guild meeting), I see no <br/>\nreason the local kakis cant make an effort to achieve it ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nc. Be prepared.  Nothing is more anoying than to see the following <br/>\nsituation.<br/>\nA : Ah, everyone is so puntual today, let ROCK!<br/>\nB, C, D, E : Yeah yeah, let rock! WOWOWOWO!<br/>\nF : Sorry guys, no more food, drink and reagents, can someone spare me <br/>\nsome, summon for me, OR gate me back to town purchasing, OR teleport to <br/>\ntown and buy for me?<br/>\n&quot;NAH!&quot; *A, B, C, D, E all point their middle fingers to F&#39;s nose, mouse, <br/>\nearholes, assxxxx*<br/>\n<br/>\n4.Patient, Effective, Efficient<br/>\n- Patient.  If we set our mind to hunt Dvinn, then be patient to wait for <br/>\nit to spawn.  Dun suga suga show off and hunt other mobs with one swing or <br/>\none nuke.  Yeah no doubt it&#39;s very facinating to show those newbies how <br/>\npowerful you are, but hey, why are you here in the first place?  And when <br/>\nthe mob spawn, you are either resting or OOM.<br/>\n- Efficient.  At places which is heavily camped, casting the 1st spell on <br/>\nthe mob may mean you get it or not.  Eg, when I camp in Ziltus Hill (hehe), <br/>\ngroup of lvl 20 casters wanna fight kill with me.  When the trainer spawn, <br/>\nI&#39;m always the 1st one to hit it with a spell that hurt it more than 50%, <br/>\nand the other casters r jus helping me to finish up the job.  Do some <br/>\ntiming (eg aviak guards take 6-7 min to spawn, pickclaw 13 min, trainer 16 <br/>\nmin etc), manage your time so that you can get fully med and rest b4 the <br/>\nspawn.  You can chit chat and sing song, but when the spawn is near, you <br/>\nbetter stay alert and watch out for it.<br/>\n- Effective. Sometime nuking with the most damaging spell is not always a <br/>\nsure-win situation.  Eg, when a lvl 40 enchanter help her friend to get <br/>\nkills in Ziltus Hill, I think she is casting the most powerful nuking spell <br/>\nshe has.  H/w, I only using the 3rd most powerful spell I got to get all <br/>\nthe kills.  Wonder why?  COZ...my 3rd most powerful spell, no doubt not as <br/>\npowerful as the lvl 40 enchanter, but it cast FASTER and hurt the train for <br/>\nmore than 50% HP.  So when the enchanter&#39;s spell hit the mob, she is just <br/>\nhelping me to wipe the floor.  Simple as it is ;)  Nuking with the most <br/>\npowerful spell is not always the one who stand up with a wining smile - we <br/>\nhave to &quot;eat brain&quot; sometimes, not &quot;eat grass&quot; ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Get the RIGHT team<br/>\nGet the right party for the hunt.  For train-proned places like dungeons, <br/>\ndimiss the pet.  For places with fast random spawns, get some tanks and at <br/>\nleast a healer.  For places where firepower mean sure-win (eg double or <br/>\nsolo aviak guards), get some bombers with u.  For places of unknown and <br/>\ndanger, get a balance group.  Having good team work is a good starting step <br/>\nto a successful hunting trip, but getting the wrong party combo may mean <br/>\nyou r stepping on the wrong path.  Eg when there is so many players crowded <br/>\nin the CB tower, one lvl 29 wiz will work better than a group of 3 lvl 30 <br/>\nwarriors.  On the other hand, in Runnyeye, a lvl 29 paladin can last longer <br/>\nthan a group of 3 lvl 30 wiz.  See the light? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not the best player around, but merely rising some points which I think <br/>\nwe have to ponder them in depth.  No doubt it&#39;s sometime fun to have those <br/>\n&quot;U DIE I DIE&quot; kinda hunting, but in the long run, we shld work out <br/>\nsomething better and more enjoyable  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2c.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus Planeswalker</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
