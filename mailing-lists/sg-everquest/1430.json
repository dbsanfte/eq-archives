Ever since we play EQ for so long, I bet by now<br/>\n&gt;most of us know what we wanna be, how to train what our char and possess<br/>\n&gt;with, at least, the basic survival knowledge.  Compared to the time when I<br/>\n&gt;start EQ w/o been a beta player, I was wrong at that time when making<br/>\n&gt;certain decisions, particularly how my char is created.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Nevertheless, I will stick to Wiz even if we were to shift over to the new<br/>\n&gt;server.  Life is gonna be tough (esp the the begining stage, like wanna die<br/>\n&gt;cannot die, wanna live cannot live) but if it&#39;s a race war server, that<br/>\n&gt;mean we better select to be under the same team.  With the same team, I bet<br/>\n&gt;it will be much easier for us to hunt together.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m for Erudite Wiz - with max INT pump in.  Life will be harder than a HE<br/>\n&gt;since ER dun have infravision (tried once in Prexus making a ER Wiz and<br/>\n&gt;find it VERY difficult to play w/o light, kena whack up-down-left-right<br/>\n&gt;shortly after I walked out of city).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I leave the decision to the majority and my heart follow the majority. Just<br/>\n&gt;make sure this is the LAST migration, IF we have decided to shift.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Btw, can someone enllighten me on the following:<br/>\n&gt;In normal server, npc only KOS char of different alignment (eg DE kena KOS<br/>\n&gt;in all elfs settlements, human kena KOS in Troll/Ogre territory, BUT human<br/>\n&gt;wont be KOS in elf terrority).  May I know if a char of good race walk into<br/>\n&gt;the city of ANOTHER TEAM which is ALSO a good race, will the char kena KOS?<br/>\n&gt; Eg HE and Human are considered good races yet under different team, will a<br/>\n&gt;human who walk into Felwithe kena KOS by HE npcs?<br/>\n&gt;- If the answer is yes, then evil races will be a good choice, since based<br/>\n&gt;on EQ&#39;Lizer&#39;s article abt race war team comparison, evil races (DE, troll,<br/>\n&gt;Ogre) have some of the best races for most of the classes.  They also have<br/>\n&gt;advantages since they have more access to the better lvling dungeons.<br/>\n&gt;- If the answer is no (ie human char can go to elf shop buying supplies w/o<br/>\n&gt;been KOS), I will go for human, erudite and barbarian, they can lvl<br/>\n&gt;fastest.  Thou life is hard in the begining w/o light, but the reward will<br/>\n&gt;pay off at the later stage.  Erudite makes the most powerful casters at<br/>\n&gt;high lvl, Barbarian make excellent tankers and human is the most flexible<br/>\n&gt;amg all races, plus no xp penalty - see how someone in Inno lvl so damn<br/>\n&gt;fast? hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Tuesday, 27 July, 1999 9:25 PM, Entreri [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hi guys,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I propose that we all move to Tallon Zek[PvP Teams].Okay here are my<br/>\n&gt;SUGGESTIONS on why we MIGHT wanna move there.However if there isnt much<br/>\n&gt;support,I will stay in Innoruuk with u guys.All critisims are welcomed!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 1.Guild:Okay,lets face it,for normal servers,Guild aint of much fan<br/>\n&gt;except of a tag there.I foresee that if a guild is set up in Tallon Zek,it<br/>\n&gt;would be much more meaningfull in the sense that when everyone has a common<br/>\n&gt;goal and at the same time roleplaying WHAT it should be[huh?A paladin and<br/>\n&gt;SK chatting with each other?].Serious roleplaying could be carried to the<br/>\n&gt;fullest and the tension when going over zones which WILL encourage grouping<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 2.New Server.Since its new,it would be nice that there will be players<br/>\n&gt;around to group.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 3.MAIN POINT:The tension!This time,you would be much more carefull going<br/>\n&gt;through zones and when buddies come the fullest and where racism too<br/>\n&gt;:).Although all the Singaporean EQ Players would be best if same<br/>\n&gt;group,however we could have some not in this group so they could set up<br/>\n&gt;their own guild and wage war with us which WILL defintely improve the SG EQ<br/>\n&gt;community.If we could not be friends,we could be still foes :)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 4.ok..high level players..ahem Garren...There seems to be a quest to<br/>\n&gt;switch servers though I do not encourage this coz it would be more fun if<br/>\n&gt;everyone same level.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 5.SG Mauling:heh..Imagine all 35SG players on this list play same group<br/>\n&gt;and have a FULLSCALE invasion on Freeport?hehe...imagine the fun..<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 6.The spirit bond BTW on SG players will defintely tighten with this..:)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 7.Makes higher lv SGs get good items for their lower SG counterparts so<br/>\n&gt;our SG strength could be increased.[Note:Coz 300levels4s could maul a<br/>\n&gt;level50?]<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 8.We could have serious planning on what class to use so we would not be<br/>\n&gt;as messy as now...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 9.We had PROBABLY wrongly configured our chr in the past so it would be a<br/>\n&gt;nice change<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 10.SGs players are now split into 2..mainly the highlevels and low<br/>\n&gt;levels..It would be nice if this everyone would be same level again<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Thx for reading...just my 2cents<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Entreri<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; ICQ UIN: 2326860<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Previewer, Singularity Gaming Network<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sg-gaming.net\">http://www.sg-gaming.net</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; Your Single Source of Everything Gaming<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; .plan at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=\">http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  &lt;&lt; File: ATT00004.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations DALMATIANRESCUE.
