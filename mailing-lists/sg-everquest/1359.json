Happened that <br/>\none day he know all other locals play in Innoruuk.  He wanna join us so <br/>\nmuch tat he make a non-returnable path - he deleted his LVL 40 enchanter <br/>\nand create a band new gu niang bard to join us at Innoruuk, we are all so <br/>\ntouched and everyone help him to regain his lvl - by giving him stuffs, <br/>\npower-training him etc.  Now he is lvl 20 bard who can start to kick asses <br/>\nard.<br/>\n<br/>\nHey why are you still in Cazic???  Delete ya lvl 18 magi and come to join <br/>\nus at Innoruuk lah.  There is SO MUCH fun and benefits playing with all of <br/>\nus:<br/>\n- Free goodies.  We practice family &quot;pass-down&quot;.  When Garren get a thug <br/>\nrobe which he cannot used, he pass to me FOC!  When I get a goss robe, I <br/>\npass my thug robe to flyingfox.  Basically we pass all the goodies ard - <br/>\nesp when we looted something which our char cant use.  So far I got <br/>\nwoven/das stuffs from Yiyang and Leshrec, Robes from Garren, JK Skill from <br/>\nSereph etc etc.  I also pass RTS, Skull etc ard.<br/>\n- Easy teaming.  As compare to my japanese wiz friend, who is 3-4 lvl above <br/>\nme b4 I join the local kakis teams, I lvl much more faster.  The 2nd time I <br/>\nsee my jap friend, I&#39;m already 4 lvl above him!  Now he also join us and <br/>\nshortly after joining us, he boost his lvl from 14 to 20 in a very short <br/>\ntime.  PLUS the fact tat local kakis are are VERY UNITED and TRUST-WORTHY - <br/>\nwe will never leave u behind when it come to life-&-death situation, except <br/>\nfor YY, haha.  On top of that, you will never have problem getting hunting <br/>\nparty in server coz anytime you login, u see local kakis.  We play till as <br/>\nlate as 4am during weekdays, and till morning for weekends ;)<br/>\n- We are all under the same guild.  Tat means it&#39;s very easy to get in <br/>\ntouch using the guildsay command.  Limited to 20 friends only?  NP man, use <br/>\nguildsay and get everyone with ya fingers.<br/>\n- So far we have all classes except SK, ranger and rogue.  For local kakis <br/>\nwe got 2 wiz, 1 magi, 1 enchant, 1 necro for casters.<br/>\n- BEST OF ALL, you can borrow money from our rich man Garren.  He offer <br/>\ninterest free loan.  Sometime u can even confuse him (since he lent money <br/>\nto so many pple) and no need to return, hahah.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus (Master Brewer, Excellent Smith, 6th circle Wiz).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sunday, 25 July, 1999 9:10 PM, Entreri [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Entreri&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Im not too sure who plays on Cazic Thule..sereph?hehe<br/>\n&gt; However,most singaporeans reside on the Innoruuk Server.You might wanna <br/>\n </span></blockquote>join<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; us here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kenven<br/>\n&gt; DarkElven Warrior of the 15th Circle<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Entreri<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a><br/>\n&gt; ICQ UIN: 2326860<br/>\n&gt; Previewer, Singularity Gaming Network<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sg-gaming.net\">http://www.sg-gaming.net</a><br/>\n&gt; Your Single Source of Everything Gaming<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; .plan at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=\">http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polarcoordinates@...\">polarcoordinates@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polarcoordinates@...\">polarcoordinates@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Sunday, July 25, 1999 5:20 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [sg-everquest] Anyone playing on Cazic Thule?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polarcoordinates@...\">polarcoordinates@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am playing on Cazic, level 18 Mage.
