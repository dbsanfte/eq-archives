FYI...Galarion, Kellendil, Merns, Leshrec,<br/>\nBibi, Massiah and myself (Zanderion)<br/>\nwere there and in fact all of us except Bibi (who was busy with wife) went<br/>\nfor a drink at the nearby<br/>\nStarbucks after the dinner.<br/>\nRecalling the good old times and just chatting about gaming brought back<br/>\nmany good memories and funny<br/>\nconversation. Pity Ziltus wasn&#39;t able to join us much but i&#39;m sure he&#39;s<br/>\nhappily busy right now kekekeke!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and we missed you too Fesse! Were hoping we could see you and put a face<br/>\nto that sexy Dark Elf butt i&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen staring at soooo mucchhh!!!!!
