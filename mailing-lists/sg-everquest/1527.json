Anyway I think u shld have no prob, since u sleep in office, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; no  i am not complaining that u (LKW) didnt give me stuff... i only to<br/>\n&gt; mention that theres no guild unity in QHD at all... since someone having<br/>\n&gt; like 5 RTS dont even bother to give it to others and keep insiting on<br/>\n&gt; money... as for lake rathetear... i guess when i have reached the level <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(20<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; if i am not wrong, pls correct)... u can show me the area and i can get <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; myself... no worries on that one...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dun worry I understand, just pull ya leg.<br/>\nJust that u also have to understand tat unlike our UO guild, where all <br/>\nmembers meet and hunt togather, our current guild dun have so much contact <br/>\nand not tat close (except amg local kakis).  So sometime it&#39;s not easy for <br/>\nthem to part with such stuffs to members which they may not even hunt with <br/>\nb4.  Even for myself, if non-local member ask me for free RTS, I will ask <br/>\nhim to fly kite (hehe but I won&#39;t go ard annouce I got 5 RTS in guardsay in <br/>\nthe first place).  I will only secret tell those local kakis whom I know <br/>\ncan use them and most probably want them - just like those who get msg from <br/>\nme for free RTS and free skulls.  Basically the main problem I think is tat <br/>\nwe are not close to other members in the group except for our own local <br/>\nkakis and friends (like flyingfox hunt with me almost every night), the <br/>\nrest I dun even meet them b4 ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; i am now 1 bubbble away from level 18 and hope to get to level 20 or 21 <br/>\n </span></blockquote>over<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the weekend... from then i will start to hunt aviaks... which i strongly<br/>\n&gt; believe i can solo em until level 24-25... thast wat i heard... then the<br/>\n&gt; treant hunting starts...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The only problem with soloing is tat u may have to fight for kill with <br/>\nothers.  If a wiz of not less than a circle lvl is there, u are as good as <br/>\nhopeless if he dun choose to share.  On the other hand, u have an upper <br/>\nhand over tankers, hehe.  I start soloing at lvl 21 or 22, cant remember, <br/>\nusing the root & nuke tactics.  I also know some stealer magi who solo at <br/>\n20 with their pets (read the word STEAL, that mean they make use of others <br/>\nto get XP).  I guess there are few kakis close lvl to yours and u guys shld <br/>\ntry to form a group for hunting instead of soloing.  There is a 3 bird <br/>\ntower there, where 3 bird spawn at same time.  If u lose kill in soloing, <br/>\njust for a group of 3 to hunt there, the reture is the same - 3 bird for 3 <br/>\nchars VS 1 bird for 1 char ;)  If a wiz can solo 3 birds in lake, the place <br/>\nwill give him no xp ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hmmm... let see wat else did i miss... oh yea... words... if anyone of u<br/>\n&gt; guys come across necro words... pls kindly keep em for me... as my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>research<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; have just began.... and pls refer to the follow passge for research<br/>\n&gt; information...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure if everyone know it, u dun have to BUY all the spells:<br/>\n- Ultility spells, buy only those tat u MIGHT use (eg buying light spell <br/>\nfor DE with ultravision is a waste).<br/>\n- Dam spells, buy only those that u will place in ya spell icons (eg I dun <br/>\nbuy AE spells and even when I buy for my 1st 2 circle, I never use them - <br/>\nno chance to memo them, which is a waster of money, only make me die <br/>\nfaster).<br/>\n- Check the site for those spells not available in your guild, are they <br/>\nbeen casted by other classes?  If yes, u can buy instead of research.  So <br/>\nfar I buy those useful spells that need wiz to research from other classes&#39; <br/>\nguilds - enstill from cleric guild, leviate from druid guild etc.  When <br/>\nthere is a faster, cheaper and easier way to get a spell, why not? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I dun undertstand what u mean by the research rquest.  Do u mean <br/>\nfinding the correct ingredient to make new spells?  If that&#39;s the case, dun <br/>\nbother, there are some site that give all the research info.
