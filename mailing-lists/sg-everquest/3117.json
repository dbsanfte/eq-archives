But how -- other than threatening to send it to jail <br/>\n-- do architects and contractors get a tall building to go <br/>\nstraight?<br/>\n<br/>\nShhh. Can you keep a secret? Tall buildings aren&#39;t perfectly <br/>\nvertical! They don&#39;t have to be. Flexibility is built into <br/>\ntheir construction -- valuable in itself on a windy day or in <br/>\nan earthquake zone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes to the straight up-and-down of it, close is <br/>\ngood enough. They achieve that by putting cables on the <br/>\nsupporting vertical columns when they start to build <br/>\nthe first two floors.  Surveying equipment -- plumb and <br/>\ntransit -- indicates if those columns are going straight up.  <br/>\nIf they&#39;re off, the cables are tightened to adjust the <br/>\nvertical columns so they&#39;re perpendicular before the <br/>\nhorizontal beams are bolted to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nget both of this everyday edu-info from :<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://go.mailbits.com/Trivia.asp?590825.1\">http://go.mailbits.com/Trivia.asp?590825.1</a><br/>\n<br/>\nor better yet, be an affiliate! at..:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aff.webowner.com/info/earn.asp?590825\">http://aff.webowner.com/info/earn.asp?590825</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYours,<br/>\nAZWAN</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
