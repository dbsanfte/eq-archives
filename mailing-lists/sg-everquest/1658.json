(imagine I gate to Cazic and died <br/>\non the gate spot the moment i gate in, how to go there hunt like Garren?).<br/>\n<br/>\nAll servers will get congested someday, and quite a few of us already got <br/>\nthe &quot;mid-range&#39; chars.  It&#39;s just a matter of time we can lvl up, so gotta <br/>\nbe patient ah.  At lvl 29 wiz get a 257 dam spell. Recently I have been <br/>\nhunting in HH keep and a lvl 34 wiz (I believe he got higher than 257 dd <br/>\nspell) sometime steal from my group, we also LPPL say nothing, hehe.  It&#39;s <br/>\nkinda furstrated I understand, but it&#39;s part of the game.  When you are <br/>\nnewbie, u wanna know the lvl 50, when you are lvl 50, everyone wanna know u <br/>\n;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I think Wylven has banned some misbehaved members but he is not <br/>\nonline at all time, so it&#39;s not easy for him to maintain 100% discipline, <br/>\nesp when QHD do not have any formal ranking of higher rank members who can <br/>\nmaintain guild order.  I&#39;m neutral to stay in QHD or form SG guild, err, ok <br/>\nlah, abit more to forming SG guild ;)  I guess EQ guild emphasize more on <br/>\nteam work than UO guilds, so making a trust-worthy guild with kakis who <br/>\nknow our communication style is impt. By now we shld more or less start to <br/>\nsettle down with the final char we wanna play ;)  It&#39;s a good time to <br/>\ndiscuss abt this AGAIN.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus Planeswalker<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wednesday, 11 August, 1999 12:00 AM, Sereph <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Okay, since the server is still down, despite me traveling half of<br/>\n&gt; S&#39;pore for supper and took a taxi back, so stuff about the local SG<br/>\n&gt; community and EQ in general<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As we know, more and more kakis are getting unhappy about QHD, due to<br/>\n&gt; the sheer number of newbies, lamers and goons there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, for this again.

All get a bit alive leh, and stop leaving the hall, or else!<br/>\n&gt; *flashes 2 dual-bladed dicoted katanas*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good, now sit down and listen. We currently got these problems:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1: Existing goons in QHD how???<br/>\n&gt; 2: Kakis not united leh, how???<br/>\n&gt; 3. Server getting conjested how???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For 1, I suggest that if enough people here wishes to quit QHD and form<br/>\n&gt; a local guild, we all gather at the wizard spire in NK, and get Ling to<br/>\n&gt; teleport Wylven there, and we talk to him, face to face, about leaving.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2, We SG kakis are not really united as a whole. All run here run there,<br/>\n&gt; rarely got chance to meet each other, and on top of that. Only when they<br/>\n&gt; get drag, do we see them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3. As all you people know, Innoruuk is getting very congested, and<br/>\n&gt; several places are made dangerous, due to the high level people, camping<br/>\n&gt; items for their friends. If a local guild is to be form, will be still<br/>\n&gt; be in Innoruuk, or change to a new server, and restart anew, with each<br/>\n&gt; kaki helping one another out from the start.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Finally, I have to yell this out again. WHO THE FISH HAS FREE WEBSPACE<br/>\n&gt; TO SPARE!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m getting some web servers for reselling purpose and if this is not<br/>\n&gt; done soon, I&#39;ll keep one of the server, and we&#39;ll split up the<br/>\n&gt; maintanace fee of it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; NOTE: This is NOT that big change I&#39;m talking about.
