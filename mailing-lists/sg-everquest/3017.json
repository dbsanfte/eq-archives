On and off login and play with us. <br/>\n Better than quit and later kena attracted to another massive online RPG, u <br/>\nknow the effect - countless sleepless nights, no day no night no life etc. <br/>\n At least after playing so long in EQ, kinda immune to the temptation of <br/>\nPLing.  Keep ya acct la.  If grow tired of mage then make a new char like <br/>\nme lor.  Play play other char, or even other sex ;)  I now playing a mage, <br/>\nmaybe u can make a wiz lor, we team like the good old days, hehe.   I still <br/>\nwaiting for ya pet to help my twink get jboot ah ;P<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I like abt EQ is tat I can totally forget abt it when I dun feel <br/>\nlike playing it.  Unlike UO, I gotta login 1-2 times per week to refresh <br/>\nhouses ;(  I also thinking of further study next yr, so very hesitated to <br/>\npick up new games (if u join the SG-Online-RPGers mailing list, u know <br/>\nthere are few very solid massive RPG coming up).  If I stick with EQ and/or <br/>\nUO accts, at least the monthly payment will prevent me from forking our <br/>\nmore money to play new games, u know lah, married man, gotta think abt <br/>\nfamily budget, hehe (unless u pple all quit UO/EQ then I will also go <br/>\nover).<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw Bibi and Zan, still playing D2?  Lesh is also taking exam soon. <br/>\n Hopefully I can get lvl 51 by the time he come back and we can get 52 <br/>\ntogether.  After tat, we will slow down our pace and spend more time with <br/>\nguild pple.  Expect more taxi in near future ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZil</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
