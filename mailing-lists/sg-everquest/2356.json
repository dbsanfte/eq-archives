Slime crystal staff, dropped by a slime element in the bigger slime pool<br/>\n&gt; in Runnyeye.  Garren know what is the mob lvl?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. Ice crystal staff, found in Permafrost. Fesse pls provide info so we can<br/>\n&gt; go see see look look when camping for runed circlet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3. The deceiver mask (cant remember exact name, turn u to DE).  Dropped by<br/>\n&gt; lower guk assasin.  Anyone got map to the spot? Also how tough is the<br/>\n&gt; assasin?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4. Hidden water tunnel in Paw.  It spawns named mobs.  Mob lvl not high but<br/>\n&gt; was thinking to go there see see look look when too bored in EQ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 5. Polished bone bracer.  Dropped by what mob, where?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 6. Fesse pls advise me the reasonable price for the following jewelry:<br/>\n&gt; - 7int/7str necklace<br/>\n&gt; - 4int earring (a pair)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 7. Is there any INT bracers out there? Stats? Drop by who and where?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just a feedback, my max dam with less than 30 1HB skill using the staff of<br/>\n&gt; writhing is 19 (melee) + 48 (chaotic effect), ie 67 dam per hit.  At such a<br/>\n&gt; low 1HB skill, the chaotic effect appears like once every 5 fights.  I<br/>\n&gt; still got 30 skill points with me (after dumping 90 skills points and<br/>\n&gt; 200+pp to rise my research skill from zero to 90 odd), wonder if I shld<br/>\n&gt; throw them all into 1HB (since I seldom melee but the skill does help alot<br/>\n&gt; when I try to kill mob for fractions).  Is there any skill a wiz shld look<br/>\n&gt; into at mid-30?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ??
