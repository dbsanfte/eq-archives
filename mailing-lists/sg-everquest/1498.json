Coins are good, up <br/>\nto 3pp, but I dun get any magical artifacts or fine steel weaps.  Worse is <br/>\nthe faction msg I got, feel kinda uneasy.  So in the end hunt for 1 hr with <br/>\nFlyingfox and ciao liao.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who dun bother abt faction (mainly with the druids), the trees <br/>\nare lvl 24 to 28 I think.  They cast swarming which is a DoT spell, as well <br/>\nas AE spells (have to run away from those burning areas will do).  Most <br/>\nimpt is to have 2 faster nukers - we try with a lvl 26 wiz, a lvl 24 magi <br/>\nand a lvl 24 earth pet, quite easy as the mobs have low HP.  2 casts from <br/>\neach of us, at most, will slain 1 tree, while the pet tank.  The trees <br/>\nspawn in pair, at specific location.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally speaking I think they hit very hard, the earth pet always leaves <br/>\nless than 40% HP after every battle and the trees spawn faster than we can <br/>\nrecover (mainly have to wait for pet to regain HP).  Other than coins, they <br/>\nalso give wood shards (anyone know wat it&#39;s for?) and light stone (can sell <br/>\nat 1pp to PC and 9gp to NPC).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested to hunt for some quick XP, here is the loc:<br/>\nWhen you zone from NK to SK, turn left and run all the way.  The camp is <br/>\nsomewhere 2-3 screen from the leftmost corner.  It&#39;s often filled with DE <br/>\ncasters as they dun really bother about the faction.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus (7th circle nuker)<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: Anyone can suggest a good hunting ground for a lvl 26 wiz and lvl 24 <br/>\nmagi combo (with a lvl 24 pet if necessary)?  Places with random <br/>\nspawns/trains are not suitable for us (eg dungeons), our death experiences <br/>\nhave tested it ;)  Preferably some camps with fixed mobs, good xp and good <br/>\nloot, hehe, say between lvl 24 to lvl 28 mobs (we can get more pple if the <br/>\nmobs are of higher lvls).  Thx.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
