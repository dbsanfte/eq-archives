Better don&#39;t promise money to Garren, else if we<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have enough money to pay, all our female characters, other than Aaleku<br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; obvious reasons, are doom. He&#39;s a damn pimping Paladin for Tunare&#39;s sake!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hehe not pay full amt la, but at least show some nominal appreciation mah.<br/>\n&gt; If u lvl 1 and ask Garren to camp SOO for u, he where got so free, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, the last Rathetear hunt, we were quite puntual, if not for the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; freaking crash of NK. Generally, we are quite Punctual for day 1 of most<br/>\n&gt;hunt.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Day 2 is a different affair altogether.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is really unavoidable &#39;sway&#39;.  FF and I kena EQ crash and have to<br/>\n&gt;reinstall and re-download all patches, took us almost an hr ;(  That&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt;2nd gate spell I cast, I thought my gate so powerful that it crashed NK,<br/>\n&gt;hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Think we hot blooded youngsters as patient as you old mans ah? We<br/>\n&gt;bored, find<br/>\n&gt;&gt; something to do liao, heck care about you ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Then what is the objective for the hunt?  If we organised a camping event,<br/>\n&gt;then camp lor.  Otherwise make it an adventuring event.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;To prevent this from happening, we should always have a non-meditating<br/>\n&gt;class<br/>\n&gt;&gt; aka monks, bards, rogues and warriors during a camp to look for spawn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Actually not necessary always, coz we can invis ourselves and med.  If we<br/>\n&gt;got for those fixed number mob, fixed spawning rate hunting spot, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;always more than enuff time to get fully med and rest b4 the next spawn.<br/>\n&gt; This sentence dun apply to those dungeons or random spawn region.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Agree, but, the problem with us right now is that we are freaking<br/>\n&gt;&gt; disorganise. Most of the times, we have rojak groups, with huge level<br/>\n&gt;&gt; difference, due to lack of participation of other kakis.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tat&#39;s why I mentioned, categorise the hunting lvl.  If it&#39;s a lvl 30 mob,<br/>\n&gt;just open it for the lvl 30 & above kakis.  If it&#39;s a lvl 10 hunt, open to<br/>\n&gt;those lvl 10 and above (high lvl can join if they choose to help) and<br/>\n&gt;invite 1 or 2 high lvl to help.<br/>\n&gt;As for participation, I think our kakis are the active bunch in QHD. So far<br/>\n&gt;we can get at least 1 full group for the events. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Prepare your group gate at all times loh, tanks gonna die, GG first,<br/>\n&gt;think<br/>\n&gt;&gt; later.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My gate spell cost 300 mana.  Wiz can be act as the last resort for<br/>\n&gt;fleeing, just make sure<br/>\n&gt;- No mob disturb me during the 10-15 second casting (yes, gate spell got<br/>\n&gt;the longest casting time).<br/>\n&gt;- I have enuff mana (in fact I advise all casters to at least reserve 1<br/>\n&gt;bubb mana for self gating out, and 2 bubb if u can cast party gate spell).<br/>\n&gt;If wiz cannot gate out, it will be a &quot;I DIE U ALL DIE&quot; situation, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Another concern I have is the limited spell slots.<br/>\n&gt;My 8 spell icons are:<br/>\n&gt;- 1st nuke (120 dam, for finishing running mob)<br/>\n&gt;- 2nd nuke (180 dam, for doing last kill if mob not running yet left ard 1<br/>\n&gt;bubb HP and save mana)<br/>\n&gt;- 3rd nuke (260 dam, for normal hunting)<br/>\n&gt;- Major shield (rise HP and AC)<br/>\n&gt;- Shield<br/>\n&gt;- Root<br/>\n&gt;- Gate (last resort for myself)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As u can see, all the above r essential for my survival and hunting.  If I<br/>\n&gt;replace last slot with party gate, I can not longer gate myself out when<br/>\n&gt;the party gate fail or low mana.  ;(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So unless it&#39;s like the ROO tactics I mentioned, where wiz main task is tp<br/>\n&gt;party gate once we kill and loot oracle, portal spell never shown on my<br/>\n&gt;normal spell icon slots.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Only 2 cents? So cheapskate? at least give S$2 lah<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Be humble ma, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
