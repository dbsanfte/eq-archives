Oooh, nice BUT im still on innoorruk, Good to take a look see how race server is like..but INNORRUK still the BASE. If some of u guys r not sure where u r goin to be, here&#39;s my suggestion.1) have a base char here in Innorruuk. Go play at Race server .u still have a fix char in Innorruk.2) Go to other servers and moonlight in all the servers and still be at  a lvl  6th 12months from now :P3) Quit Playing EQ and get a life Regarding resources... I hope we dont have a mis-understanding here..on what im about to say.We (the ppl on Innorruuk) would be most happy to share our resouces(money, items, time,life etx) with the not so &quot;regular&quot; players in Innorruuk but I dont think im going to share a 100pp item and not see it being used. It doesnt make sense. You still have my friendship, that is free and without condition :) I love to play with u guys. I give a Singapore Guild my prority. SOme of U knows that im in a Guild already. I recommend any player approaching 20th lvl to be on a guild for &quot;networking&quot;, resoucring and the utimate gaming experiences. Lvling is NOT the game or just a goal. Enjoy the journey and take in the adventure. Xp comes along with it. Stick to 1-2 chars for heavens Sake ! wait till u reach lvl 30 or so to have muti char.
