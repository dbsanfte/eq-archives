That asshole is <br/>\neither a retarded idiot OR he think you guys are retarded idiots, hehehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far other than the local kakis, I only trust my other 2 HK friends (both <br/>\nlvl 14, bard and magi).  The rest not so reliable, thou&#39; occasionally I <br/>\nmeet some really nice guys.  Last night I was hunting at Ro with my magi <br/>\nfriend, helping him to lvl to 14 (until he gained lvl at 2am then I logout <br/>\nand bath).  During the hunt I must thank Garren running all the way from <br/>\nBefallen to bring me the desmask collar (I wonder which is better? desmask <br/>\nor woven collor, both ac2 and sell same price to npc).  Anyway aother group <br/>\nof lvl 9-12 was there, and they always act blur and attack our kills. H/w, <br/>\nwe use the magi nuke, wiz root and pet tank followed by both magi/wiz nuke <br/>\nfurther, and killed all our preys within 10 sec.  So they lan lan keep <br/>\napologized saying they confused blah blah blah...and the same excuse again <br/>\nand again.  Initially we also smile smile explaining to them since they <br/>\njust killed the previous, so this is our etc (I think they also thought we <br/>\nare retarded idiots who cannot see they hunting cutt when we mediating, <br/>\nactually we can &#39;see&#39; using the targetting hokey to sense monster <br/>\nspawning).  In the end we also sian liao and we just kill when our turn <br/>\ncomes - no word or explaination.  THEN they learn their lesson - they still <br/>\nkeep running to the cutt, but the moment they see our spells hitting the <br/>\ncutt, they start to backoff, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 1am, the whole damn camp is very crowded, and many groups come in and <br/>\nanyhow killed.  So my friend and I just heck care abt the order (since no <br/>\none is following) - we just nuke, climb hill med, then come down again <br/>\nstart nuking w/o bothering who kills is that.  No one make noise, coz we <br/>\nalso take few min to med and chance is there are few cutt spawned in <br/>\nbetween.<br/>\n<br/>\nA thumb of rule when everybody stealing kill - either steal FASTER than <br/>\nthem, or proceed to next spawning ground (no point wasting time, mana and <br/>\nHP helping the bastards to get kills).<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, June 24, 1999 9:55 PM, Leshrec [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Leshrec&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This happened to me too in Highhold.

In bank&quot; But in the end he just ran away. To think we<br/>\n&gt; had internal conflict as well as external conflict (A cleric named Kagana<br/>\n&gt; kept bitching to my friend that she was bringing a druid which could help<br/>\n&gt; her steal kill the gnoll. In the end when the gnoll spawned, they don&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; mana. lol.)<br/>\n&gt; Anyways, I think we Singaporeans should group together OURSELF and only<br/>\n&gt; trusted friends to do Equipment runs.

I remember teaming with a guy name<br/>\n&gt; similar<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and he is the KNN CCB PCB HGK who loot everything whenever he got the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; chance even thou we all agreed to do alpha loot b4 the hunt.  I think<br/>\n&gt; there<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are always bastards and looters everywhere, whether in UO or EQ.  My<br/>\n&gt; style<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is simple - steal kill from these bastards.  These few days I&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; hunting solo in Ro Derv Camp, and there are always 1-3 groups who <br/>\n </span></blockquote>hunting<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; at the same camp.  As a weak wiz, I can easily used up my mana for <br/>\n </span></blockquote>every<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; cutt I killed.  Fine, so I will climb to the mountain and med,<br/>\n&gt; occasionally<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; stand up and see what are the other guys doing.   So far it&#39;s kinda<br/>\n&gt; normal<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that other parties will get at least 1 kills b4 I come down from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mountain with full mana, if not 2 kills per groups.  Yet many players<br/>\n&gt; still<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; got the cheek to attack my kill.  Simple right? It&#39;s so obvious to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>rotate<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; kills with just 2-3 groups, but there is forever cock-face who &#39;blur<br/>\n&gt; blur&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rush ahead and attacking the cutt.  What I will just do is to wait, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>wait<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; till they hurt the monster by 30-40%, then I start to nuke and steal <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; kill.  Hehe, this is something I like most about wiz - nuking - swift <br/>\n </span></blockquote>as<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; wind, hehe.  And most of the time they will learn to share after the<br/>\n&gt; lesson<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; - sometime it&#39;s kinda surprised to see how these players suddently <br/>\n </span></blockquote>turn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &#39;alert&#39; and finally know whose&#39;s kill is the next spawn, LOL.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Another occasion I was hunting with a ranger (both solo), a 3 men <br/>\n </span></blockquote>group<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; come and ask to take turn to kill.  Fine with me, no harm share abit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  However, once the ranger and the group each take a kill, the group<br/>\n&gt; attack<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the 3rd monsters when I was abt to root&nuke!  WTF??!  I heck care and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; start nuking what is rightfully mine.  Within 10 sec the cutt is down <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; go and loot it.  Guess wat?  I receive a tell from a DE from the group<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; saying something like this &quot;WTF YOU IDIOT KILL STEALER, THAT KILL IS<br/>\n&gt; OUR!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  YOU DICK HEAD!!&quot;  Pardon me WTF?  They just tool a kill and they <br/>\n </span></blockquote>shout<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; me for stealing their kill? Hehe, so I start to quarrel with that guy <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; realised that what he meant by &#39;sharing&#39; in the first place is to let<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; EVERYONE at the camp to take a kill!  That mean - if it&#39;s a 6 men <br/>\n </span></blockquote>team, I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; will have to wait for them to kill 6 times b4 I get mine, hehe.  Kinda<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; shocked, but can anyone on the list enlighten me - is this the way EQ<br/>\n&gt; share<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; kills?  I myself so far join several groups but none practice this.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m wrong but it really sound kinda funny to me ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On Thursday, June 24, 1999 5:44 PM, Gary Qui Hong Loong<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; From: Gary Qui Hong Loong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;     2 days ago, I was at Befallen hunting for a BBC (which I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; need,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; just wanna get one to sell of cash, I&#39;m broke. Trust me, even when u<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reach my lvl, u will still be struggling for $$$). The party consist <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Garren (ie me), Ironbuket, Iyenya, Senorn and Phenix. We were lucky<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the first Troll SK we killed had the BBC. That was the end of the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>good<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; part. Phenix then immediately stole the BBC and refuses to pass over<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; BBC to me (funny thing was that they agreed to do alpha loot and my<br/>\n&gt; name<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ended up as first. But I did said that the group can buy the BBC and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll spilt the cash with the group). And when he (ie Phenix) tried <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; run out of Befallen, he died. Okie, that would have been end of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>story.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Guy looted group BBC and died on his way out, and loses his stuff. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>But,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; we&#39;re kind hearted enough to help him to get his stuff back. Then <br/>\n </span></blockquote>his<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; friend Senorn was given permission to loot his corpse. Okie, letting<br/>\n&gt; his<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; friend Senorn loot the Phenix is almost as good as losing the BBC. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>They<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are friends. But, dued to some lag and wierd shit, Senorn dropped <br/>\n </span></blockquote>his<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; SBH, and lost the BBC too. Now, Iyenya picked up the SBH. Okie, so <br/>\n </span></blockquote>we<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; gotten the SBH instead of the BBC, well it&#39;s better than nothing. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>But,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; we didn&#39;t sell it. We held on to it and see who claim to lose his <br/>\n </span></blockquote>SBH.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Both Phenix and Senorn claimed to have dropped the SBH and both <br/>\n </span></blockquote>claimed<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that each other had the BBC. But, why did I choose to believe that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Phenix had stolen the BBC (the 2nd time and also con the SBH off<br/>\n&gt; Iyenya,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; which is likely to belong to Senorn)? B&#39;cos when I went down to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oasis<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and asked 1 day later, ppl beside him said that he&#39;s holding a BBC. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; started to taunt him (PRICK was about the kindest thing I said about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; him) and challenged him to a duel which Phenix refused. One thing <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; saying is that I&#39;ll never ever want to be in a group with Phenix <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(who<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; stole the group BBC and stole/sold his friend Senorn SBH, which <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Senorn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (a warrior) had to sell off his armor to get another SBH).
