My UO guild started off with only 4-5 <br/>\nlocals, purely for the sake of helping one another, play together rather <br/>\nthan to form an formal guild.  I also can&#39;t remember since when more and <br/>\nmore players seek to join us ;)  Most importantly, no matter we role-play <br/>\nas good or evil, dun &#39;seah shui&#39; S&#39;poreans&#39; faces, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion is the existing players can post more info abt the game, <br/>\nparticularly the game play performance in each shard.  I bet most of the <br/>\nlocal players are still in a stage of below lvl 20, and it&#39;s still not too <br/>\ndifficult for all to shift to the best shard to play in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m now waiting for my copy of EQ, and sincerely appreciate all in-game <br/>\ninfo posted by local players ;)  I personally look for a lag-free server <br/>\nwith good server down time close to our timezone, so that I dun have to <br/>\ncome back home from work just to wait for server to come up *grin*.<br/>\n<br/>\nDark Flame<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tuesday, April 27, 1999 5:26 PM, Wilson [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ritzbits@...\">ritzbits@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Wilson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ritzbits@...\">ritzbits@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Greetings,<br/>\n&gt; In one of my last posts, I mentioned that I would doubt a Singapore Guild<br/>\n&gt; forming for at least the next 8 months cos...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A)You need at least 10 regular memebers that play frequently.<br/>\n&gt; B)You need to upkeep the guild *IF* I am right ;-)<br/>\n&gt; C)You have to have a reputation...<br/>\n&gt; D)The guild must be organised I guess, not like UO where I go around <br/>\n </span></blockquote>seeing<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; people with titles above their head like [1800-Suk-Ass] or [Masta <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Blasta,FG]<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I never meant to sound so negative.
