And i<br/>\nspent<br/>\nthem all on my lvl8 spells which cost 3pp 9gp 8scp per spell.<br/>\nI&#39;m almost lvl 11 and i&#39;m just thinking at this rate...when i hit lvl 12 and<br/>\nbuy those  new spells at 5-6pp each...i need at least another 60pp?? Wah..<br/>\nsiong man<br/>\n<br/>\nI did hear of the brewing thing...just that when first heard of it...was not<br/>\nvery<br/>\nsure of the details...but i guess now i probably would try.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing is that in my area where i&#39;ve been hunting of late...you get<br/>\nbetter exp<br/>\nbut only shitty bones for loot. (Mummies, skeletons,chessboard Skel Pawns,<br/>\netc...)<br/>\nSo i had to choose between levelling and making money. I chose levelling cos<br/>\ni want to hit lvl 12 faster...the bind affinity spell i thought can use to<br/>\nmake some money!<br/>\nAlot of ppl are willing to pay 1pp at least for a bind somewhere. Best<br/>\nman...if got 20 ppl<br/>\nin one night...20pp liaoz...LOL Don&#39;t think so easy lah hehe Besides I&#39;ll<br/>\nonly do that when<br/>\ni&#39;m short on cash (which is most of the time). I prefer to do for free<br/>\nactually. Nice guy here :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk that&#39;s it for me...off to work (late again hiaks)<br/>\n<br/>\nZanderion  [lvl 10 magi] Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\np.s Thanks for the advice Ziltus!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 06, 1999 10:16 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [sg-everquest] Money money money, hehe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jus a thought.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Everyone start off been very poor, and even at lvl 18, I&#39;m still very<br/>\npoor,<br/>\n&gt; unlike our rich man Garren, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We guys gotta learn to stand on our feet sometime.  I think brewing is a<br/>\n&gt; very useful trade skill which can easily fulfill ya financial needs, just<br/>\n&gt; that it&#39;s kinda boring and take times.  Nevertheless comparing with<br/>\n&gt; hunting, brewing still give me better and faster return than hunting so<br/>\n&gt; far.  If we can spend 1-3 hrs a day brewing, I dun see why the new chaps<br/>\n&gt; cant do the same ;)  No doubt we try to help by sponsoring abit, but u<br/>\nguys<br/>\n&gt; have to help us to help yaself sometimes ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One thing for sure, we the local kakis always keep items which we think<br/>\n&gt; other kakis can used (eg I keep cutt ring for newbies, ring mails for<br/>\n&gt; tanks, garren keep thu robe for me, les keep woven for me etc).  We will<br/>\n&gt; try to help as and when we can, but one must understand the fact tat<br/>\n&gt; utimately u r the one playing the game and handling ya own char, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; IMHO, brewing can make some quick buck.  At lvl 10 u shld be able to save<br/>\n&gt; up to 10pp.  Of coz I know pple will use them to buy stuffs like<br/>\n&gt; weap/armor/scrolls.  But just ponder - if u spend it on brewing, u can<br/>\nearn<br/>\n&gt; even more to buys stuffs, at the same time maxing ya skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At lvl 18 now, I&#39;m still picking up bone chips, rusty weaps, animal skins,<br/>\n&gt; beetle eyes and even rat tooth (7cp) to sell.  FYI I&#39;m a wiz with the<br/>\n&gt; weakest STR amg all races and I keep SIX bags on me to carry loot.  Many<br/>\n&gt; times u see me walking between EC and WC while I&#39;m actually running with<br/>\n&gt; 200% overload on me, haha.    If I can try so hard to save up money, I dun<br/>\n&gt; see why others cant do it. ;P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p/s:  Just FYI, the npc at tunnel buy at a lower price than FP npc, so I<br/>\n&gt; die die gotta &#39;walk&#39; back to FP sell.  Now u see I earn all my money using<br/>\n&gt; all my blood, sweat and tears, hehe ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
