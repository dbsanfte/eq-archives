No doubts it&#39;s easier to train a char with somebody <br/>\ntwinking you, but you will lost the fun, the good, the bad, the sad, the <br/>\nfear, the frustration, the joy etc...all the experiences u are supposed to <br/>\nencounter when playing this game.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those twinked chars you come across, most of them has a high-lvl char <br/>\nbehind supporting.  This means that those players also spend their time <br/>\ngoing thru&#39; the newbie stage.  If everything comes so easily, u will soon <br/>\nlost interest in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I think quite number of those exisitng kakis can easily spare <br/>\n10-20pp for a newbie kakis buying a descent set of newbie <br/>\nweap/armor/stuffs.  I think with this &#39;twinking&#39;, it&#39;s already good enuff <br/>\nto start off training ya char.  On the other hand, sometime it&#39;s best for <br/>\nnew-comers to spend a week or so, playing a brand new char w/o any <br/>\ntwinking, to get the feel of the game and decide if it is the class/race <br/>\nthat you are going for.  If every new comers come into server and suga suga <br/>\ncreate new char, we help to twink abit, and delete char to re-create <br/>\nanother one and expect twinking again, then it&#39;s not tat fair to those <br/>\nhelping.  So it&#39;s always a 2-sided coins ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like playing RTS game.  If u hack a saved game and play the game by <br/>\nbuilding only the more powerful units to rush ya opponents, u will never <br/>\nlearn the usefulness of other units.  For most of the solo campaign game, <br/>\nnormally there is 1 or 2 missions where the most powerful unit (which is <br/>\nnormally slowest) is no longer a useful element in completing the mission. <br/>\n At this stage, only those players who really play from scatch will be able <br/>\nto tackle the problems and complete the mission safely.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome players reached lvl 50 first, some reach lvl 50 later.  Ultimately we <br/>\nwill all be lvl 50s.  Just ask yaself, what kinda lvl 50 u wanna be? ;) <br/>\n FYI there are some lvl 49 players in EQ who even lost their way in South <br/>\nKaran, si-bek jiat-lat, hahahah ;P<br/>\n<br/>\nI myself is one of those few amg local kakis tat started a char in Prexus <br/>\nwhen it&#39;s first up.  With my wiz experience in Inno, I make a really cool <br/>\nwiz char in Prexus.  H/w, dun to the lack of kakis, I find training there <br/>\nis very boring.  In the end I follow the rest back to Inno.  Now u may say, <br/>\nit&#39;s not tat difficult to find grp members to hunt with, but I must comment <br/>\nthat it&#39;s VERY difficult to find TRUST-WORHTY kakis in the game.  Ask <br/>\nveteran players like Sereph and Garren, their feeling when someone in the <br/>\ngrp looted the camped stuffs, disband and run off? ;)  At least in Inno, I <br/>\nknow who I can fight together...to death.  Until now I still remember the <br/>\nnewbie named David in Prexus, who disband from the team when we striked a <br/>\nskelly train near Ak&#39;non dragon bone land.  When some of the team members <br/>\nasked him why he disband after the battle, he said he was LD, while I <br/>\nmyself saw him running to guards with my own eyes ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: I read form a EQ site that the numbers of casters armors discovered is <br/>\nonly less than 10% of all the casters armors in the game ;)  Just tat <br/>\ncasters sux in adventuring (we are better in camping) due to train and <br/>\nrandom spawn, we dun discover as many casters stuffs like those tanks out <br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Friday, 03 September, 1999 2:44 PM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; if u r looking to get twinked... i suggest u go prexus...
