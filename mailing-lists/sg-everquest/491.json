Somehow I agree coz seem like I&#39;ve <br/>\nnothing much to do other than blasting monsters in EQ, hehe.   Dunno how <br/>\nlong can this &#39;blasting&#39; will last me in EQ ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, I&#39;m having a hard time in Steamfont Mountain after my wiz achieve lvl <br/>\n5 via soloing, AGAIN.  As in Felwithe, I&#39;m having a hard time finding a <br/>\ngood team to gain XP to higher lvl. 90% of the team I mixed so far sux - <br/>\nsome members even disband and flee when a train of monsters killed our <br/>\ntanks and rushed towards the casters, LOL. (Oh remember the name David, <br/>\nthis guy looted everything in group hunting and said &quot;who loot also nimnd&quot;, <br/>\nhehe, and he is always the first one who disband and flee when danger arise <br/>\n- his name disappear in group list not becoz he LD but I personally see him <br/>\nrunning off, hehe).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone make a gnomish char?  Need a buddy badly there ;)  If not, I will <br/>\ncreate a TSK or TSH (someone said we need more cleric/shaman chars in <br/>\nPrexus guild?) and solo all the way - ie make the darkest evil char.  Kinda <br/>\nsian finding pple to team with.  Been a lawful good char in UO, maybe it &#39;s <br/>\ntime to make a chaotic evil one in EQ, wahahahaha!<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, Leshrec, need to check with u.  Regarding ya DEN, do u intend to <br/>\nrole-play evil or intend to &quot;turn over a new leave&quot; (ie improve ya faction <br/>\nwith other races)?  Anyone ever think of building a high lvl EVIL char and <br/>\nwipe off an npc town? hehehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nMondain</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
