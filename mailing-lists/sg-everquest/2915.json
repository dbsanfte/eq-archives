Probably becoz there are many more players now than stress test <br/>\n(but still have to blame that Korean server, down more than 1/2 of the <br/>\ntime).  Seem like the &#39;server down&#39; is becoz of our connection and not the <br/>\nreal server down.

As I didn&#39;t find much goodies, I spend most <br/>\nof my money buying swords and test out their dam.  My last buy is a great <br/>\nhelm, 22k which drain me dry up totally.  Btw, all my resis is zero, my <br/>\ngears are mainly with fastest run/walk, fastest hit recovery, increase <br/>\nchances getting magical items, life regeneration and attacker kena hit by <br/>\nspikes kind, no resis type.  Maybe becoz of that I use TONS of potions, esp <br/>\nhealing potions.  For every big fights (I use ard 10 healing potions). <br/>\n Does resis really help?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yes, seem like it&#39;s more powerful using 1 fast/heavy dam weap than 2 <br/>\nvery fast/medium dam weap?  Also swords got more varity right?  My barb <br/>\nonly train in sword mastery...<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: Les, I just noticed the crystal sword only has 10 druability, no <br/>\nwonder it breaks down so often.  But its dam is the highest I got so far.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
