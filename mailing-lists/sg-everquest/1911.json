I will get to level 30 asap or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even more and will not be stopping until i am happy with my level. It seems<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be that when u have the level, camping any shit will be easy and you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dont have to rely on anyones help.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is VERY true, once u got the lvl, u can start hunting for stuffs.  See<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m still wearing my lvl 16 armor mainly?  See I undergo the power training<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in Lake Rathetear for the past weeks - I mixed so often with aviak guards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tat pple start calling me birdman, hehe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some stuff bout the guild charter.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. when a SOS (not to be abused) is being sent (e.g., such that a person<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; died in a terrible spot and impossible to get back, then everyone is online<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and is capable MUST BE there to help irregardless of what dman thing u r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hate to say this but i think the SOS WILL be abused.  No way to avoid.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  See too many abused case in UO and it will be the same in EQ (from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; newbies&#39; shouts every now and then).  I&#39;m totally against such SOS rescue<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; where everyone online has to help regardless what u r doing. Imagine I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get up to 10 msg asking for party gate within 30 min I login (some even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tell me &quot;ah finally wait till u login&quot;, LOL), no way I gonna response to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; every SOS msg.  One of the most hated msg I get from UO is some newbie<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; members SOS msg tat pop up on my screen every now and then.  This is esp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worse in EQ when traveling is time-consuming, even with teleport spell we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; also need time to run and find the corpse.  In UO, once I noticed any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; member abusing this aid, I will let other veteran members know so as to let<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them stay in dungeon as a ghost or learn to walk back to town and get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; resurrection ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I personally proposed those within the zone offer their help if only they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can help (eg was buying, selling or solo random hunting).  Imagine if I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kill 24 orc trainer (5-6 hr waiting) in a row and I know SBS will spawn in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the next 2-3 spawn, I would think it will be better for the member to spend<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5-30 min searching his corpse instead.  Sometime it is more practice and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; effective to seek help from the zone rather than waiting for own member to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do it.  Eg 2 nights ago, I need someone to help in transferring stuffs from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Zil to my new char, I start with guildsay, no response.  I msg few kakis,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some no response, some response saying they r few zones away hunting, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; also didnt expect them to run all the way to help me, coz I think it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kinda impractical for them to do so.  In the end when I was abt to find a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quiet place drop the item and login my new char to get it, I got msg from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; FF who is coming to GF for some camping and offer his help.  I&#39;m not trying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to blame anyone but in such situation, I think it&#39;s perfectly alright to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; solve the problem by myself, in the sense of efficiency and effectiveness.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  We all start as a newbie w/o helps, we learn thing the hard way.  As in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; UO, every hunting trips as a newbie, I walk with my kakis from town to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dungeon, back to town b4 the last save.  When we all reach tank-mage stage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and we start helping newbie members to mark rune, to gate them here and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there.  So much so tat in the end they dun even know how to walk from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dungeon to town if they get killed as a lvl 8 caster and no member online<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ;)  Just to share my personal experience.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. i also suggest someone to be in-charge of hunts and stuff (one of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; officers, thats i propose Ziltus and one other person).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, gotta turn down this job abt hunting and stuffs.  I dun mind doing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some recruiting job, PROVIDED I am available to do the recruiting, since<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wiz has the advantage of travelling spells.  H/w, UO event organiser is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enuff for me.  During my time as a GM, I hold more events than the total<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; events organised by the rest of the guild.  Now for EQ, I dun mind doing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; part-time, esp during this transition period when QHD dun have much<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; activities, but I guess I wont wanna be the official person in charge, heh,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thx for the nomination tho&#39; ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. As for banking and equipment, i propsed those 2 person, instead of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; using their banks, get them to create a char just for the purpose of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; banking. So it will be easier for them to keep track of money and stuff and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; those money is not to be abused. We can have a store of items and LOAN them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to members in the guild (e.g., RTS and other stuff), when these members are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; capable of geting one, they will return it or pass it to another member<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; requiring it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Loaning items is abit difficult in EQ, due to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Not easy to meet to borrow and return stuffs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Loading a char in EQ can be quite time consuming, unlike UO.  So if the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person in charge need to logout and relogin the storeman char, it will post<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some kinda inconveniences for the player.  Due to the limited items slot in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; EQ (unlike UO where only wt limit), it&#39;s not easy to keep stuffs too, esp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lore item like RTS, u can only keep 1 per char.  I think it will be more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; effective for higher lvl to help lower lvl to get some cool items once in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; while, and provided the lower lvl can physically participate the hunting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (and not turning it to a corpse looting session).  Of coz, for those lower<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lvl, dun expect to get something more than 5 lvls than u la.  If a lvl 1<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wanna get JBoot, I think even if u got a lvl 50 wiz with u, it&#39;s also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; difficult for him to even bring u to see Najena.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NOTE: i have a slightly crazy idea bout something. Instead of creating<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one guild, we will form 2 guilds. one for lower levels, one higher. All our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; low level chars will form one and high level another. maybe level 1-20 one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guild, 20 upwards another (or maybe even make it level 30). This way, we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can recruit newbies and train them the way of our guild. if our guild is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; active all the time and is nice to all of the folks, i dont believe there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is any reason for them to quit the guild. That will continue to point 4.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm, pardon me, I dun see the need to create 2 guilds, since we dun have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; start a warfare sub-division like in UO for guild war (to protect those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; non-war chars).  Actually it shld be alright to have all lvl in the guild.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Plus the fact tat with our own kakis, we dun have to hide where we r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hunting.  As long as u got the lvl requirement for hunt, u are most welcome<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to join us (which mean we must have strict recruitment to get only those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trust-worthy and loyal kakis la).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. We will help lower levels folks to break spwan and stuff BUT it doesnt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mean helping them to kill all the stuff and let them loot for many many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hours. Crap stuff like RTS i say it doesnt hurt to let most members have,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BUT if we are talking bout FBRs or more useful items as we gain more power,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then that we must state a certain level or unless they can get it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves (usually this is a few levels b4 they can get it themselves).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tat&#39;s why I organise the RTS hunt and limit the hunt to those above lvl 12<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  ;)  Problem is, in order to prevent camping, EQ is patched anti-camp.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  During the last trip, we camp for 2 hrs or so (?) and not even a RTS or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; skull.  YY mentioned webclaw spaw at 10 min interval, which sound very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tempting for me to get it, hehe.  Kellendil also got a WCS liao, maybe u<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can share with us how u got it (how u kill it, melee, nuke or wat), where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (which part of Lake)?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. i have also by chance came to talk to the guildmaster of Disciples of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Discord. All members are red (PvP). So if any members decided to be funny<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  with the guild or spoil the reputation of the guild then they will be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hunted down for the rest of their fucking EQ lives That i believe is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat good protection, but it requires members to be PvP and ourselves<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be also which is a bad thing or good thing. IF ANY MEMBERS CREATE<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; TROUBLE FOR THE GUILD, THEY ARE BANNED FROM THE GUILD. NOT REMOVED.so they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wont have their other chars pretend and join our guild again and get to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cheat the guild and stuff.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My stand is to remain non-PvP, even until I reach lvl 50 ;)  Personally I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dun really enjoy PvP all time, but some duels here and there shld be ok ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. we certainly dont want war with other guilds. if we dont steal kills<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and stuff i dont forsee a guildwar happening.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Too many stealers in EQ, and so far I havent heard any war starts due to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kill stealing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Make it unique, maybe someone that wants to be officer or elder or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; watever u call that, he must be highly nominated by 2/3 of the elder/<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; officer council OR he can gain it by challenging one to a duel and WIN IT.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =) some pvp action. if the guild gets large enough, we can have some sort<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of arena fights n stuff.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm, lvls or PvP capablity shldnt be the factor used to determine officer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; post.  No use asking a lvl 50 wiz who win the duel for the position, go ard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; making havoc and spoil guild reputation until we dismiss him - damange<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; already  done to our reputation.  Instead, leadership, commitment, loyalty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and contribution shld be looked into when determining the officer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; candidates.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8. ok i said enough, now bloody feedback for all i have said...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p/s: cant imagine i went on a camping trip and gain one level =) and also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; found some true friends and jerks...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just like tax and death in RL, you see friends and jerks everywhere in EQ<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gary Qui Hong Loong<br/>\n&gt; Technical Support Executive<br/>\n&gt; Pacific Internet Technical Support Department .<br/>\n&gt; Pacific Internet Limited.<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt; Pacific Surf : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pacific.net.sg\">http://www.pacific.net.sg</a><br/>\n&gt; Technical Support Helpline : 1800-8723330<br/>\n&gt; Customer Support Helpline : 1800-8725055<br/>\n&gt; 89 Science Park Drive<br/>\n&gt; #04-09/12 The Rutherford<br/>\n&gt; Singapore 118261<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
