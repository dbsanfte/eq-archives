EQ has turn out to be such a zombie-camping-training game that<br/>\n&gt; eliminated most of the fun provided by the multi-race/class char<br/>\n&gt; development concept.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To tell the truth, even after I stop playing EQ, I didn&#39;t login UO every<br/>\n&gt; night.  But every time I login, there are quite a lot of stuffs I can do,<br/>\n&gt; other than camping/hunting.  Both UO and EQ are not as attractive as b4,<br/>\n&gt; but it&#39;s sad that say EQ has more &#39;push&#39; factor than UO.  I feel more sick<br/>\n&gt; when thinking of logging into EQ than UO ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p/s: Garren shld have sold ya acct in eBay instead of just quit.
