Patches: &quot;We are tuning x, y and z in the next patch. ER, we are NOT<br/>\ntuning x or y, but we are removing item q from the game. ER, we are NOT NOT<br/>\ntuning x and y, and q will NOT be removed from the game. ER, in the next<br/>\npatch there may or may not be some changes. BTW, we sure are glad you all<br/>\npay by credit card.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Trades: &quot; YAY! After 2 months level 25! Time to try some alchemy. What?<br/>\nIt&#39;s broken? Ah well, at least I still have Rogue poison to look forward<br/>\nto.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Class manipulation: &quot;I started out as an Magician, but after 5 months of<br/>\npatches I&#39;m now playing a fire breathing skunk with a pet bat.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Magic-item placement: &quot;What? You&#39;ve been waiting 20 hours for<br/>\nJboots/Rubicite? Well expect to wait 20 more days, I just dialed 911 on<br/>\nguildsay and our 50 wiz is coming to outfit our whole clan. Hope you don&#39;t<br/>\nmind.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n5. The &quot;cooperation&quot; illusion: &quot;Hey guys it&#39;s great to be co-operatin&#39; with<br/>\nyall in a good group. This is how the game should be played. Now let&#39;s go<br/>\nsteal that spawn from the other group. too bad they aren&#39;t PVP!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Disconnections: &quot;Yeah I was almost level 50 but got disconnected. When<br/>\nI logged back in I was over lava and fell in.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Dumb ass players: &quot;Sorry you died buddy. but I thought DDing that Ice<br/>\nGiant was a better idea than healing you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Crazy travel times: &quot;You&#39;re where? Ok, I&#39;ll meet you in 2 hours. I have<br/>\nto run from Kaladim, I&#39;m way overweight, I just missed the boat, and that<br/>\ndamn Druid wouldn&#39;t SOW me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Overcrowding: &quot;This spawn is ours, that spawn is theirs and those guys<br/>\nhave that other spawn. but if you want to wait, there is a group after those<br/>\nguys you can be after if their friends don&#39;t show up first.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n10. Immature players: &quot;Hey fuk u dweb I saw it first you didn&#39;t it&#39;s mine<br/>\nno get lost b4 I paatition u.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n2 BONUS reasons:<br/>\n<br/>\n11. Lack of strategy: &quot;Ok, we&#39;re all buffed up and ready to go. Joe you do<br/>\nthe zig here, Biff you zag there and I&#39;ll do the ol&#39; one-two over thataway.<br/>\nWhen the timing is just right we&#39;ll all. wait. LOOKOUT! Another newbie with<br/>\na train! ACK! &lt;all dead&gt;.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n12. Everything is real-time: Girlfriend: &quot;Honey the house is on fire, an<br/>\nasteroid is on a collision course with the earth, and the phone is for you.<br/>\ncan you take it?&quot; Boyfriend: &quot;Sorry dear, I can&#39;t leave now or I&#39;ll die and<br/>\nlose 10 hours of game time.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
