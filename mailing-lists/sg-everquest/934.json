Only comsumption will.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO brewing is a very easy and nice trade to develop.  If u got 5-10pp and <br/>\n2 hrs to spare, why not max it out?  If omeday your char corrupted and all <br/>\nthe items on u and ya bank kena wiped off, you still have a skill to make <br/>\nsome money ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
