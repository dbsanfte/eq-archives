This make CR very difficult unless can get necro to summon corpse <br/>\n(which can be quite jiatlat to trouble others if happens often).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone can suggest what other place is fast and good xp for wiz, and when <br/>\nkilled at least easier to do resurrection? (best got place to do quad-kite <br/>\nsince it&#39;s best xp for mana).  Thx.<br/>\n<br/>\nps: Spiroc xp very slow for my lvl liao ;(</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
