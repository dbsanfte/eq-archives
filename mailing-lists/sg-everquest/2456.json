Later a low 20 <br/>\nnecro join the team and he invited a train of 2 TT, 1 necro, 5-6 ogre and <br/>\nmob&#39;s pet (dunno how he did it).  All 5 players in the team kena killed and <br/>\nI&#39;m the only one who managed to gate out with 1/2 bubb mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nTat wiz later revive inside Derz room and it happened that Derz & her 2 <br/>\nnecro spawn at that time.  Guess what, he was killed 8 times on a row until <br/>\nhe pull out his modem line (he come back 2 hrs later and tell me).  He told <br/>\nme he lost more than 3 bubb xp and drop a lvl.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I better blind outside Najena zone.  The room is always crowded <br/>\nwith campers, so no way u can gate in and kill (and by the time u gate in, <br/>\npple may have beat Derz to half death liao) ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, 23 September, 1999 10:14 AM, Lim Choong Ee <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:choongee@...\">choongee@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Lim Choong Ee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:choongee@...\">choongee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; jboots is pure camping no much tip can be given to help hehe<br/>\n&gt; there is one thing though, since u wizard, u can bind yourself<br/>\n&gt; inside the drelna room, so when it spawn u can immeidiatey tele<br/>\n&gt; in without delay n get the kills first.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lim Choong Ee<br/>\n&gt; Assistant Engineer<br/>\n&gt; 100 Eunos Ave 7, Singapore 409572<br/>\n&gt; Tel: (65)7476666-362 Fax: (65)7416066<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
