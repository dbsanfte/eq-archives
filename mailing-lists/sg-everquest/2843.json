Everyone gonna have enuff place to put their houses <br/>\n(of coz in time to come, land will get scare again but this time they going <br/>\nto implement 1 house per acct per shard).<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of exciting changes now, plus a party system coming up.  UO has learn <br/>\nalot from EQ and given the fact that it has more RP elements than EQ, I <br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s gonna rock!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for UO2, I&#39;m not putting any hope on it.
