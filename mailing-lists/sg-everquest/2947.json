I<br/>\nsuddenly have the urge to play with some old classic games. Have been<br/>\nsearching some emulator websites but cant find them. If you have the<br/>\nfollowing emulator pls email them to me(shouldnt be too big) thanks<br/>\n<br/>\nNintendo/familycom(those 8 bit ones)<br/>\n<br/>\nKonami World-One of the best games created at that time(1980s) I found it<br/>\non one website, but its faulty :( everytime I use the teleport to get back<br/>\nto the lab the graphics go crazy. Anyone got a working copy?<br/>\n<br/>\nLegend of Zelda:the advantures of Link-This is not Legend of link. Legend<br/>\nof link is part 1 this is part 2<br/>\n<br/>\nDragonballZ 2-The RPG game...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSega MegaDrive<br/>\n<br/>\nHerzog Zwei-Strangely, although its a popular game, there isnt any game<br/>\nwhich is similar to it right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBahamut Wars-A Fantasy War game. Donno name correct anot since its in<br/>\nJapanese. The cover of the game is a Dragon with a rider on it. Title is in<br/>\nJapanese but it ends with the chinese character Zhan Ji(War history).<br/>\nGame has 8 characters+1 hidden char to choose from and is for 1-4 players<br/>\nwith the others play by computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone links to emulator websites pls email to me too. Setting up a<br/>\nlinks page for them :p<br/>\nThanks in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n               &#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;////     <br/>\n               / ^   _ &#92;    <br/>\n              ( (o) (o) ) <br/>\n *=======oOOO=====(_)=====OOOo=========*<br/>\n |              Dexter Wong            |  <br/>\n |        <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dexterw@...\">dexterw@...</a>       |<br/>\n |      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dexterwong@...\">dexterwong@...</a>      |<br/>\n |          ICQ Uni:1301686            |<br/>\n |        www.gamezonesg.cjb.net       |<br/>\n |     www.geocities.com/gamezonesg    |<br/>\n *===================Oooo.=============*<br/>\n             .oooO   (  |<br/>\n             (   )   ) /<br/>\n              &#92; (   (_/<br/>\n               &#92;_)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
