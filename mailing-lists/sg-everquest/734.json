It&#39;s a total failure to team a lvl <br/>\n6, a lvl 12 and a lvl 19 - big &quot;generation&quot; gap.  I think we spend more <br/>\nthan 2-3 hrs in order to get everyone their stuffs back SAFETY at <br/>\ncommonland/freeport. LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust imagine a weak wiz like me carrying more than double my STR allows me, <br/>\nhehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I wont go that CB place until I get invisible spell a lvl 16.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight I&#39;m going to Befallen with 2 HK friends - a lvl 13 bard and a lvl <br/>\n13 magi.  Any lvl 12-14 who wanna join us feel free to give me a tell when <br/>\nu login.  Advice welcome.  Btw, which lvl is safe for us, considering those <br/>\nundead train?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZil<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Saturday, June 19, 1999 3:59 AM, Sereph [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Sereph &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I declare the raid to be a total failure. We didn&#39;t get much of what we<br/>\n&gt; want and in the end, Gary and I died while trying to get out of<br/>\n&gt; Innothule swamp and LKW got lost. We resorted to all sort of funny ways<br/>\n&gt; and manage to get our stuff back. (The whole process can be summarised<br/>\n&gt; by 1 word, Cheebye)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I took some useless screenshots. Anyone interested, request from me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW, I still need to be power leveled. I got some equipment from Gary(my<br/>\n&gt; character&#39;s rear is still bear........) but I still lack levels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
