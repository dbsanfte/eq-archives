I pay him15pp for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told Webclaw Murkwave spawn randomly.<br/>\nWhen i was 3 birds tower it appears more that 10 times. The group kills its<br/>\nlike 14 times. He guild all about 10 guild members over and everyone got<br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday at Tower, Webclaw didnt appear.<br/>\nI have deduce the following. Im guessing, so dun flame me .<br/>\n1) Webclaw spawn from towers. Be it the old small tower with the Plank or<br/>\nthe 3 bird tower.<br/>\n2) how many towers r there at Lake Rathe???<br/>\n3) Very likely will spawn from the same tower for the same day or after a<br/>\nFIX numbers of death it has. then it changes location.<br/>\n4) I saw webcalw at 2 locations so far. The plank and 3 birds towers. ..and<br/>\nit always runs towards the west direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nYY<br/>\nStill at Lake Rathetear<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;* Singapore EQ Mailing List&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, August 19, 1999 4:51 PM<br/>\nSubject: [sg-everquest] YY pls reply - WCS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Heard tat u managed to get WCS.
