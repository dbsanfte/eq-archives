Hmm, I think it&#39;s the other way round leh.  Bolt cast faster than shock, <br/>\n&gt;but it&#39;s non-guided missle and normally slightly higher dam, LOS is also a <br/>\n&gt;factor when targeting.  Let me check my bolt and shock casting time <br/>\n&gt;tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bolt takes longer to cast as least for my current lvl.  Funny is that IT IS a guided <br/>\nmissile! ;)  Maybe it is lag, but last night, when Fesse and I were kiting the qeynos <br/>\nguard, I can hit the guard with my cinder bolt even he is behind me!  The only thing u <br/>\nhave to make sure is that there is nothing blocking on the way.  With the shock, the <br/>\nmob should stand within your view else it will failed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2. Alamak, every class also complain, hehe, grass-elsewhere-greener <br/>\n&gt;syndrome I guess.  At least u magi nuke next to wiz, PLUS u got a pet to <br/>\n&gt;tank for u..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think Verant has made a pretty balance class system here. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3. I&#39;m talking abt the range lvl 34-38.  Magi dd inflict higher dam than <br/>\n&gt;Wiz lah, no arguement on that.  FF&#39;s lvl 34 dd is more than 310, while my <br/>\n&gt;lvl 34 dd is only 30X.  But even magi with a higher dd, I can easily draw <br/>\n&gt;mob to me but not the other way round.  My death at lvl 35 with FF (lvl 34 <br/>\n&gt;magi) and Zan (lvl 35 magi) prove it ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have found something quite interesting here.  Just yesterday, I got the staff of <br/>\nWrithing when I was in HH.  Once I tried to melee the pickclaw, they will come to me <br/>\ninstead of my partners.  This may either due to 1)  the - CHA effect that makes u most <br/>\nhated 2) u hit the mob too hard together with your staff and DD.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;4. Magi is more of a supporting/nuking role in a grp, where wiz is pure <br/>\n&gt;nuker.  There is no arguement magi is the 2nd best nuker after wiz.  And <br/>\n&gt;with ya lvl 49 dd spell of 900dam, you guys are not 1/2 wiz coz our highest <br/>\n&gt;dd spell is only 1200 (ie ya&#39;s is 75% of ours, not 50%), plus the fact u <br/>\n&gt;guys can get tat spell easier and cast faster.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The real problem is most high lvl hunting place is dungeon where a magi is not <br/>\nwelcomed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;5. Overall speaking, other than dungeon, magi shld survive better than wiz, <br/>\n&gt;if u play well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Hunting,<br/>\n<br/>\nFlyingFox Everest, Magician at his 35</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
