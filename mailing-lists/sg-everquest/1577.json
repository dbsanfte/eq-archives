Judging from this, maybe i should just go n work on my levels instead of getting items since everyone wants so many things... how bout everyone just is able to list ONE item that he really really wants... or several of lesser value... otherwise the trip is gonna turn out to be more of a nitemare than benefit for us...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Nicademous<br/>\n  p/s : i think those that want stuff for their 2nd or 3rd char is unfair... bcos theres just too many folks queueing up for the stuff... unless u want to bring ya 2nd or 3rd char along then thats another story. thats wat i think... pls feedback...<br/>\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  SC Cheng, Freddy<br/>\n  Mobile-Internet Laboratory, Multimedia Laboratory,<br/>\n  NTT DoCoMo R&D Center C212,<br/>\n  3-5, Hikari no Oka, Yokosuka-Shi,<br/>\n  Kanagawa, 239-8536, Japan<br/>\n  Tel : +81 468-40-3497<br/>\n  Fax: +81 468-40-3788<br/>\n  Email : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
