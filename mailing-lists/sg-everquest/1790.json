Shouldn&#39;t QHD be enough? Could be the question you are going to<br/>\nthrow at me later, and I&#39;ll answer them AGAIN.<br/>\n<br/>\nQHD has several lamers these days, and on top of that, it&#39;s hyper<br/>\ninactive in activities. When was the last time, the guild got together<br/>\nto do something? It acts more like a glorified shout channel. Also, when<br/>\nwe are planning kakis only activities and have to resort to guildsay to<br/>\ncommunicate, random goons might join in, and ruin the experience for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a result, I propose that we get this thing together and prepare for<br/>\nthe guild formation by Wednesday.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, what I want you to do is answer this question:<br/>\n<br/>\nQuit QHD and form a local kaki guild, yay or nay?<br/>\n<br/>\nThen these question if you say yay:<br/>\n<br/>\nWho should be the goondu in charge?<br/>\n<br/>\nWho should be the officals for recruiting?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe charter, who is willing to type it?<br/>\n<br/>\nWebsite, for the thousand time, anyone can get one ASAP?<br/>\n<br/>\nRecruting guidlines, think, and give me your opinion.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
