Points I&#39;ve considered:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Been a pioneer in the new server, I guess I won&#39;t be far from the <br/>\nhighest lvl group of players (well, maybe a big diff since I can&#39;t play EQ <br/>\n16 hrs a day, but I guess it&#39;s still better than Innoruuk).<br/>\n2. All the local kakis&#39; chars are pretty new - none above lvl 20 I guess. <br/>\n So it&#39;s still &#39;affordable&#39; to start a new one in Prexus.<br/>\n3. Now we are all starting from scratch, chances is that we will be having <br/>\nsimilar lvls as we progress in the game, that means it&#39;s much easier for us <br/>\nhunt as a team in future.<br/>\n4. Been a pioneer also give us the oportunity to be one of the earliest <br/>\nguilds in Prexus.  Imagine next time you  tell ya EQ friend abt our guild <br/>\n&quot;Ahem, my guild is the first guild in Prexus, blah blah blah...&quot; Kinda cool <br/>\nif u ask me ;)<br/>\n5. Lastly, been the pioneer players, our chances of becoming one of the <br/>\nhighest lvl in the new server is much higher, and this give us advantages <br/>\nin role-playing in the game and the ability to help new in-coming local <br/>\nplayers.  If now we set up a guild in Innoruuk, we are just one of the many <br/>\nmany guild available in the server and not many pple heard of us.  But if <br/>\nwe all have our new guild abbrev in our chars in Prexus, surely it will <br/>\ncatch lots of attention - since more pple will get to notice our name as <br/>\ncompared to Innoruuk.  Once we make a name, our guild will start to kill <br/>\nasses ard. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it&#39;s not easy to give up an existing veteran char and move to start <br/>\na new one, it&#39;s really kinda pain in the ass to do so.  I myself also <br/>\ninsisted on staying in UO Baja shard when someone proposed in the Singnet <br/>\nGaming List to shift to a new lagless shard.  I can totally understand the <br/>\n&#39;heart-pain&#39;.  BUT, on the other hand, I believe none of the local EQ char <br/>\nis as established as mine in UO (more than 5 millions worth of assets & gp, <br/>\nseveral GM mules including smith, tinker, alchemist, poisoner, etc, and a <br/>\nguild which is #3 biggest out of 1000 over guilds at that time).  Thus <br/>\ngiving up a lvl 12 wiz in Innoruuk is quite and easy decision for me, thou&#39; <br/>\nI&#39;m pretty excited with the new spells, hehe.  Of coz, different pple has <br/>\ndifferent opinion, it all really depends on you yaself.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, I played betweem 8pm to 2am.<br/>\n<br/>\nMondain, Gnomish Wizard.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, June 10, 1999 3:38 PM, Sereph [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Sereph &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Both are fine for me, but considering the fact that our characters in<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuk are of vastly different levels, restarting in Prexus and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>grouping<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; from the beginning is not a bad idea.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW, everyone, mind telling me the time you usually play EQ?
