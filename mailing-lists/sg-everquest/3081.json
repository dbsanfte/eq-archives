Instead, the PC just freeze and I have <br/>\nto reboot the PC (ie auto scandisk etc) and restart EQ.  Sometime the PC <br/>\nautomatically restart by itself just b4 I get to Win98 desktop.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome other SCV cable modem users are also facing the same problem (eg <br/>\nMerns, Trifrost) while some didn&#39;t (eg Leshrec).  This problem can occurs <br/>\nseveral times a night, or none at all.  On average I will have 2-3 <br/>\noccurance every night.  Surprisingly sometime I got no freezing on <br/>\nweekends, when the server is very crowded.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is related to some configurations (eg DataRate file) as well <br/>\nas SCV modem.  I just wanna check with those EQ SCV users, what is your <br/>\ndatarate setting (5.0 to 9.0)?  Anyone else got the same problem?  If yes, <br/>\ndid you manage to solve this, thx!<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus (AdV), Innoruuk.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
