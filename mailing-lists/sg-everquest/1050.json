One slot can <br/>\ntake 20 sets, 8 slots can take 160 sets.  I remember that time I filled 5 <br/>\nbackpack full, so it shld be 200 sets instead, hehe.  I use the ctrl-click <br/>\nmethod, but still brewing until vomit blood.  No more brewing for me after <br/>\ntat until now, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for skill gaining, as long as u r fighting mobs which u can get xp after <br/>\nkilling it (some green mobs also give xp), u will gain skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think brewing is quite a nice source of money for lvl 1-20.  Now it&#39;s <br/>\nstill giving me a faster and better return rate.  I wonder if there is <br/>\nhigher range of brews which we can make to further increase our skills. <br/>\n Dunno where to find those brewing book, anyone got any idea?  Of coz if u <br/>\nare looking for cool stuffs like FBR, u need to brew alot to afford it <br/>\nstill.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZil<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, 08 July, 1999 12:15 PM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; well... from all the necro guides n stuff... i have decided to pump up my<br/>\n&gt; INT to 120 and DEX to 100... i dont know if this enough... but i suppose <br/>\n </span></blockquote>it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; will be... since a Human Necro will have much lesser INT and will also be<br/>\n&gt; able to manage... i guess the main reason fer using more pp to max out<br/>\n&gt; brewing  is not bcos of low INT... its bcos of LOW CHARISMA.... thats <br/>\n </span></blockquote>very<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; impt... i thnk... i spend more gold getting the stuff... n sell back fer<br/>\n&gt; less... thats the way it is... definetely cant compare to a high chr bard<br/>\n&gt; rite?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; also... another thing i noticed... fighting a mob that u got upper hand<br/>\n&gt; on... will also gain skill in fighting (proven)... i guess u just need to<br/>\n&gt; fight alot... thats all.... since i gain 1 point when fighting a level 1 <br/>\n </span></blockquote>mob<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; when i was level 4...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; back to brewing... u buy 160 sets of everything??!!?!?!?!  7 backpacks<br/>\n&gt; enough meh? might teaching me some tricks to brewing?.... like the ctrl +<br/>\n&gt; click thingy someone said earlier (oops.. forgot who... but that really<br/>\n&gt; helps)...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i guess i will not try to learn any other trade skills fer awhile... <br/>\n </span></blockquote>least<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; not till ive level to i think high enough... or perhaps abit of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>everything<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; every now n then....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nic<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, July 08, 1999 12:56 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [sg-everquest] Crazy + Brewing...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wah, ya necro abit goon leh, need 10pp to max out skill, hehehe. <br/>\n </span></blockquote> Someone<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; just mentioned he max out using only 5pp+ with 75int.
