This is actually a big bad point for <br/>\nwiz.  I noticed we wiz have the ability to learn bind wound skill - our <br/>\nONLY source of self-healing.  So far I  never train on it as I do not have <br/>\nmuch money to spend on bandages (this skill required bandages).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone train on this skill, pls share ya experience:<br/>\n- What&#39;s the sucessful rate when you start to train in this skill?<br/>\n- At the begining stage, I believe I will fail many times.  May I know if I <br/>\nfail, what&#39;s the implication?  Does failure means heal less or the bandage <br/>\nis totally wasted and heal nothing at all?<br/>\n- So far I didnt anyhow use my practice point.  I think I have around <br/>\n35points balance at lvl 8.  To minimise the cost of bandage, is it <br/>\nadvisable to throw them all into bind wound skill?<br/>\n- Can this bind wound skill heal other than self?<br/>\n- What is the healing effect of this skill, does it have a delay time?  Eg <br/>\nsome spells have range damage plus certain points of dam per lvl.<br/>\n- If it&#39;s not advisable to use practice points on this skill (maybe these r <br/>\nsome other skills which is more impt?), how can one rise the skill fast?<br/>\n- Can wiz use this skill while fighting?  Or we must quit for attack mode <br/>\nto use this skill?<br/>\n- What is the lvl ceiling of this skill for wiz?  3+3/lvl (like our melee <br/>\nskill) or 5+5/lvl (like our magery skill)?<br/>\n<br/>\nThx.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
