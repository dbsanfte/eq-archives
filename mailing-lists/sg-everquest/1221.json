Leshrec also contribute<br/>\n&gt; his part by &#39;accidentally&#39; steal from Voy :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since the anti-camp thingy, stealing is becoming a trend - and sad to say,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s mostly the case of a caster stealing from melee.  As for high lvl win<br/>\n&gt; the kill from low lvl, I have nothing to say.  Afterall it&#39;s a fair game<br/>\n&gt; and the high lvl dun owe the low lvl anything tat they have to give up<br/>\n&gt; their chance in getting special artifacts.  H/w, I&#39;m very against stealing<br/>\n&gt; even thou&#39; I myself got capability to do so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As I&#39;ve mentioned earlier, Wylven has stated his point in giving Voy a<br/>\n&gt; chance to turn over, but Wylven himself is not clear as to what &#39;changes&#39;<br/>\n&gt; he expected from Voy:<br/>\n&gt; - No more stealing from guildmates but ok to steal from others, OR<br/>\n&gt; - No stealing from anyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My stand is very clear, if stealing from others is allowed in the guild, I<br/>\n&gt; quit.  It doesn&#39;t matter if any guild member dun steal from other members,<br/>\n&gt; the key factor here is stealing, regardless of stealing from who.  Even<br/>\n&gt; thou I&#39;m always anon (easier for me to teach the cry babes and stealer a<br/>\n&gt; lesson w/o giving any trouble to the guild), I&#39;ll feel shameful if I walk<br/>\n&gt; pass and pple starting throwing comments like &quot;here come another stealers<br/>\n&gt; from Qui Hoon Dai...&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for cry babes like Amii, I raise both my hands and legs with Yiyang -<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; train them, steal from them (since they accused us for stealing, so why<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; satisfy her &#39;needs&#39;? hehe), and make their life like hell.    Btw I<br/>\nnoticed<br/>\n&gt; u DO can block pple when they trying to zone pass a narrow passage.  A wee<br/>\nk<br/>\n&gt; ago there is this stealer name Senear at HH who keep stealing kill.  What<br/>\n&gt; my group did is to block at the HH pass.  When there is a train after him,<br/>\n&gt; he cant run to zone and was beaten till death, hahaha.  Then we start to<br/>\n&gt; wipe all the mobs.  Later this Senear comes back, he looted his corpse and<br/>\n&gt; went off, heh.  This way does not work 100% - depending on ya blocking<br/>\n&gt; positions.  If someone try to block u, u can run pass them using the jump<br/>\n&gt; features - but it&#39;ll still hinder ya running speed by a bit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve nothing against Qui Hoon Dai except this CB Voy.  So far I only hunt<br/>\n&gt; with those pple I knew b4 they join the guild, like Ling, Megu, Sat, FF,<br/>\nDF<br/>\n&gt; etc, and local kakis.  One exception is Demitry, which I only know him<br/>\n&gt; after joining the guild.  Frankly speaking I found our kakis occupying the<br/>\n&gt; medium and high lvls in the guild.  If Wylven remain silent on Voy&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; behaviour I&#39;ll support a new local guild, and I contribute 1 pp more than<br/>\n&gt; YY, ie 2pp,. heheh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus (still w/o a 2nd name).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Wednesday, 14 July, 1999 12:42 PM, Alex [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leealex@...\">leealex@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Alex&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leealex@...\">leealex@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I guess most of u know my stand on steal killin. I have been observing<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;stealin&quot; trend . The bottom line is usually 2 things 1) lvling-xp  2)<br/>\n&gt; loot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; items. Well, the others cool stuffs in EQ is often neglected. LOL  ,<br/>\nsome<br/>\n&gt; &gt; does,nt even know whats &quot;life&quot; outside of Xp and loots.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As more player lvl upwards., prime named mobs will be the main target of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &#39;desire&#39; . there  r only a handful of named mob with special items on<br/>\n&gt; then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as compared to a orc or Derv camp of 5-6 mobs. Stealin is gotta get<br/>\nvery<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very bad. Its not goin to get any better.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How we, an individual and as a Guild/Group distinguish ourselves is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; point here. I believe we should established ourselves as a dignified<br/>\n&gt; group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of people who  stands up against unethical thievery .<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Someone like Voyerbian has no place among us. Unless he repent of his<br/>\n&gt; ways.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The loud mouth type of people like &quot;Amii&quot;  is just  plain ol&#39; loud<br/>\nmouth.<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stake our stand and give this type of ppl hell. we tracked them down .<br/>\n&gt; train<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mob to them(ethical?) and make their life hell if need be.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ANy one of u spoken to Wylven besides Ziltus about Voy?  Qui H&#39;oom dai<br/>\n&gt; aint<br/>\n&gt; &gt; too bad, with almost 60 members it gives us access to a bigger pool of<br/>\n&gt; ppl<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to group . Wylven is not a bad guy too. BUT if it comes to the crunch im<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; u guys to have our guild. U hav emy support......  and a contribution of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1pp.....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yiyang<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Monk&#39;eying at RiverVale<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &#39;* Singapore EQ Mailing List&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Date: Wednesday, July 14, 1999 11:09 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [sg-everquest] FFA<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Hey guys, just to share an &#39;interesting&#39; thing I came across last<br/>\nnight.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;B4 I met Garren and the guys for Dragoon Dirk hunt, I went to trainer<br/>\n&gt; hill,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;hoping to get an SBS for some quick buck.  I was invis all the way, as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;usual hehe, and saw this lvl 15 magi from Higher Order of Arcane, Amii<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;few other players.  So I ask her is there any killing order which I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;join, she said no, it&#39;s FFA.  Ok fine then, I love FFA, hehe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Later when a trainer spawn, everyone rush in and this Amii also nuke<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;her pet, one force shock from me killed the mob.  I looted the mob and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;found nothing.  Then this Amii keep asking me what lvl and I refused to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;tell her.  She then start to &#39;order&#39; me to take turns.  What is this<br/>\n&gt; man?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When things are good for her, she ask for FFA, when thing turns<br/>\nagainst<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;her she ask to take turn.  I didnt wanna refuse directly and keep<br/>\nsaying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;since she want FFA, it shalll be a FFA.  She then start shouting all<br/>\n&gt; over<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and say I&#39;m a stealer who is not willing to take turns.  Later, Einan<br/>\n&gt; join<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;in the fun and managed to win the kill out of her, even he is actually<br/>\n1<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;lvl below Amii, hehe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;This Amii is giving everyone lot of problem, and FF also told me she<br/>\n&gt; give<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;him hell lots of shit the night b4 when FF hunt at trainer hill.  Later<br/>\n&gt; she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;even auction to offer 2pp for anyone who hurt Dvinn to almost death,<br/>\n&gt; train<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;it to her and zone off so that she can kill Dvinn for the loot and xp,<br/>\n&gt; LOL.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Knn I will pay her 3pp to do it for me man.  To think she wear gossmer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;robe at lvl 15, I dunno how many kills/SBS she already got after<br/>\ncamping<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;whole day in trainer hill ;).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I say, nuke the hell out of her, if anyone camp at CB, hahahahahaha!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Ziltus.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist<br/>\nSponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Attention ONElist list owners!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Check out the new &quot;DEFAULT MODERATED STATUS&quot; option.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Enjoy 120+ unique music channels right from your desktop!
