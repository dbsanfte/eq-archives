Just like the disease in EQ, it will cure by itself.  EQ<br/>\n&gt; spining is still not as bad as those REAL 1st person 3D arcade game.  Go<br/>\n&gt; try Tribes and u will know wat I mean, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I personally max out all my 6 out of my 7 magery skills in town everytime<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; gain a lvl - ie mediating, chanelling, evoke, divine, alter and adjure.<br/>\n&gt;  The only one left out is conjure coz wiz dun get scolls of this skill<br/>\n&gt; until later stage.  I also try to max out my melee skills whenever<br/>\n&gt; possible, but when I reach lvl 13, melee skill is no longer useful.  If I<br/>\n&gt; try to fight and cast, I will get disturbed pretty often and hp also<br/>\n&gt; reduced fast.  I used root & nuke whenever possible.  H/w, I met a lvl 18<br/>\n&gt; wiz last week, he ofter his help in using melee when I hunt derv<br/>\ncutthroat,<br/>\n&gt; saying that he still get very lttile xp in killing those derv but his main<br/>\n&gt; concern is to rise his melee skill.  Seem that ya melee skill will rise<br/>\n&gt; even if u fight with something green to u, as long as u still gain xp from<br/>\n&gt; killing it (but u dun have to kill it to gain skill).  Maybe at later<br/>\nstage<br/>\n&gt; when it&#39;s impractical to use ya melee for hunting, u can go ard helping<br/>\n&gt; lower lvl players to hunt and at the same time train ya melee?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for trading skill, I recommend brewing.  It only take an initial<br/>\n&gt; investment of 5-8pp and can max out in 2 hrs or so.  Even at my lvl I<br/>\nstill<br/>\n&gt; find the profit quite attractive.  I can only earn around 10pp a night<br/>\n&gt; hunting at my lvl (4 hrs average) but brewing give me that profit (or<br/>\nmore)<br/>\n&gt; in a hr time with max skill.  Maybe u may wanna max out this skill when u<br/>\n&gt; earn enough pp at lvl 4 instead of buying scroll 1st.  Afterall, once u<br/>\nget<br/>\n&gt; the max brewing skill, u can easily earn back the money required to buy<br/>\nall<br/>\n&gt; ya scrolls ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wait, Nicademous?  I think I saw that name somewhere b4, or something<br/>\n&gt; similar?  Where r u located now?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Monday, June 28, 1999 10:27 AM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy<br/>\n&gt; [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hey guys,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; played my EQ last weekend (actually only on SAT)... and was a whole new<br/>\n&gt; nitemare... i re-started n re-started more than 3 times in total... in the<br/>\n&gt; end... i have finally learn the way to survive n handle everything... find<br/>\n&gt; my corpse.. etc...  although still below level 4... but i m quite<br/>\nconfident<br/>\n&gt; in the game now...
