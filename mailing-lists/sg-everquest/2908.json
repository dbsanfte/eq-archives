Notice how many necro and sor<br/>\n&gt; out there?  KNN I think even pally is more than barb. The least shld be<br/>\nama<br/>\n&gt; and barb. I think there is a bug in D2.  The last game which I play to lvl<br/>\n&gt; 10, kena kick out of game, and when I return, I go back to lvl 5!!!!<br/>\n*&%&%#<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the end play again till 3am, managed to get back to lvl 9 only.  Good<br/>\n&gt; thing is tat I find a very good staff tat increase quite a few of casting<br/>\n&gt; skills and a set armor tunic.  Both I used to &#39;twink&#39; my sor later.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any sor tips pls share, I&#39;m training my barb to look for gp and magical<br/>\n&gt; stuffs (barb got a skill to increase %age to find magical stuff).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also go a luck amulet, which I found 2 fire, 2 ruby, 3 skull and 1 emer<br/>\n&gt; gems after I wear it, but knn all these gems are gone when my char<br/>\ncrashed.<br/>\n&gt;  Lucky I still got the amulet and found 1 fire, 1 ice and 1 skull gem<br/>\n&gt; later...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Friday, 30 June, 2000 4:08 AM, Davis Tuea [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dtfp@...\">dtfp@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bought it .<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Play it .<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now lvl 14 paly (argh...
