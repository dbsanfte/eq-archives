I was grouping with Eldor (lvl 12) and Yiyang (lvl 14~15)<br/>\n&gt; over the weekend, and I&#39;m lvl 9.  No doubt I got the gaining XP msg, but<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; a whole my xp gain very slow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the other hand I solo last night fighting only rattlesnake (blue/green<br/>\n&gt; to me), my xp gain faster.  This shows that no doubt grouping allows u to<br/>\n&gt; hunt more powerful monsters, but it&#39;s more advisable to hunt with someone<br/>\n&gt; close to you lvl.  Yiyang and I also try a trick he mentioned previously -<br/>\n&gt; ie we group and fight a monster, b4 the monster dies, he quit from group<br/>\n&gt; and let me get the xp.  Np doubt I will get the xp but I think it&#39;s still<br/>\n&gt; lesser from my solo hunt last night.  I think this trick dones&#39;t work very<br/>\n&gt; well, but I must thank Yiyang for his time training me and let me getting<br/>\n&gt; the loot ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve decided to delete Zilred (enchanter tonight) and concentrate on my<br/>\n&gt; wiz.  Can someone help me to transfer items from Zilred to Ziltus tonight?<br/>\n&gt;  Both are now at Freeport. Actually Zilred got nothing much except few<br/>\n&gt; cloth and a staff, but I really need $$$ badly to buy scrolls.  Lvl 9 now<br/>\n&gt; but my lvl 3 spells are not even half-filled, sigh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For those lvl 8-9 players (lvl 8 tank and lvl 9 mages), the desert behind<br/>\n&gt; inn 2 of east commonland is quite a nice place to hunt solo.  U still have<br/>\n&gt; to con the skeleton and rattlesnake b4 u fight them, thou&#39; so far most r<br/>\n&gt; blue to me.  When fighting rattlesnake, make sure you life never drop<br/>\nbelow<br/>\n&gt; 2.5 bubbles coz if it poisons u b4 it die, the poison will take around 1<br/>\n&gt; bubble (for a weak wiz like me) b4 it cure by itself.  The snake skin can<br/>\n&gt; be found quite easily and cost 1 gp each.  Occasionally u can also find<br/>\n&gt; puma there, which is less dangerous than rattlesnake.  H/w, the spot is<br/>\n&gt; pretty close to a mummy lair, u gotta be careful when hunting there coz<br/>\n&gt; sometime mummy will come out and it&#39;s agro.  I got killed 3 times last<br/>\n&gt; night by mummy while fighting snake/skeletonm, but the place is pretty<br/>\n&gt; close to freeport gate so running there is not a problem.  Most of the<br/>\ntime<br/>\n&gt; if u r alert, you shld be able to run back to the inn and let the guard<br/>\n&gt; protect u (not when u are stunned by mummy, like in my case).  As wiz has<br/>\n&gt; very low HP and AC, I have to mediate after every 1-2 battle.  Also note<br/>\n&gt; that graffin visit inn 2 quite often (as compared with inn 4 which I<br/>\nhunted<br/>\n&gt; earlier).  If u wanna see guard died, stay there for 10~15 min and u will<br/>\n&gt; get to see the big fight between graffin and guard, hehe, of coz guard<br/>\n&gt; always got killed lor ;)  Due to the danger outside inn, it&#39;s safer to<br/>\n&gt; maediate INSIDE inn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One last thing, try not to attack asp even thou it&#39;s con blue to u.  This<br/>\n&gt; CB snake is damn poisonous as compare to rattlesnake.  Once poisoned, it<br/>\n&gt; will drain up to 2.5 bubbles HP.  And remember this (&%&$^%#@# Arrowmage,<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; think he is a lvl 20~30 char.  I was poisoned last night by an asp and<br/>\n&gt; managed to run back to inn but my HP keep dropping very fast.  I keep<br/>\n&gt; asking him to heal me and he simply bo chap.  He stand and see my HP keep<br/>\n&gt; dropping steady.  Lucky the poison cure by itself when I left 5 HP!  He<br/>\n&gt; then ask &quot;help of what huh?&quot;, damn KNN CB.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the other hand, if you meet a lvl 15 lady wood elf druid at freeport<br/>\n&gt; gate, name Arsafil, greet her nicely.  She is a very helpful Japanese<br/>\n&gt; player who have help me several times.  She always give food/drink to me,<br/>\n&gt; not 5 or 10 each but 20~30 each!  She will also bind/SoW/armor/invis u for<br/>\n&gt; free if u ask her, one of the nicest helpful players I met in EQ.  ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any lvl 8~10 players wanna group hunting in EC?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; See homepage for details.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
