This is to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-964165718\">hehe dun call me senior wizard lah, my elf looks younger than yours =P. As<br/>\nfor binding, it is actually target based but can only be used in group. This<br/>\nis to prevent abuse of it, like u walk anywhere, and u feel like it u just<br/>\nbind someone. So no need to ungroup to bind yourself, just target yourself<br/>\nand bind. To bind group members, u have to target individually and bind, no<br/>\nshortcut. And yes u can bind yourself anywhere u want, but not group<br/>\nmembers. As for the shiny brass shield, you gotta camp there for at least<br/>\n2-3 days to get one unless u damn lucky. I camp there and killed 10 trainers<br/>\nand i only got some raw hide armor. Of course wizard there no problem cos<br/>\nits so easy to steal kills )<br/>\nWoven armor is best Mid level armor for wiz. Later there is gossimer and<br/>\ndamask armor which looks real cool, but woven will do for now. Its same AC<br/>\nas Patchwork but MUCH lighter. As for the area which u get, must be at least<br/>\nlevel 16+. If u wanna hunt in the swamp, have to be careful of troll guards<br/>\nand named troll NPCs. Of course u can hunt in guk, but beware of trains<br/>\nthere. I went there today and got killed twice before i got a mesh leggings<br/>\nand some other netted and woven stuff.<br/>\nbtw, crook seldom loads on LJ, maybe as rare as trainer i dunno, but trainer<br/>\ncan be done at level 12+, maybe con blue i&#39;m not sure. He hits for about 20<br/>\nbut usually theres someone tank so u just shoot at it.<br/>\nRabies is treated as a disease so a cure disease should do it, and it lasts<br/>\nquite long. Can&#39;t remember how long 45 mins real time i think.<br/>\nBtw, anyone interested to hunt in Najena, the dungeon in Lavestorm? We<br/>\nshould get together one day and go there. Xp quite good, and unlike the<br/>\nother dungeons, its quite bright and airy ) Of course an expedition to guk<br/>\nwould be cool too.<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, June 16, 1999 5:51 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [sg-everquest] Runed Totem Staff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hehe, thx for the help for getting me a runed totem staff.  Actually I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;already saving money for that, just that meanwhile cant afford to pay it<br/>\n&gt;yet.  If anyone come across pple selling this staffs below 25pp, pls give<br/>\n&gt;for me.  I wil pay back ASAP ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Btw, is woven armor good?  How is the AC and wt compare to clothes?  Any<br/>\n&gt;special features?  I heard abt some swampy area quite easy to get netted<br/>\n&gt;armors which can be sold at fairly good price.  Can a group of 2-3 lvl<br/>\n&gt;10-12 go that place?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, oh senior wiz, pls grant me knowledge abt binding.  If I&#39;m in a<br/>\n&gt;group, and we come to a town, who shld I target on in order to bind ALL<br/>\n&gt;group members to the town (or do I have to target one by one and cast<br/>\n&gt;bind?).  Say later we went to desert cave entrance as a group and I wanna<br/>\n&gt;bind ONLY myself at the entrance (anyway out town I can only bind myself<br/>\n&gt;and not the group right?), targetting myself and cast bind will only bind<br/>\n&gt;myself or will affect the rest of the members?  Or, do I have to quit from<br/>\n&gt;group, bind myself there then re-join group?  Any tips for binding myself<br/>\n&gt;near hunting ground - so that I dun have to run so far if I die, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Wednesday, June 16, 1999 5:18 PM, Leshrec [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Leshrec&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Alamak I also using almost full cloth armor lah. Woven very ex when those<br/>\n&gt;&gt; smelly trolls sell them and the only one i got was a mask which i bought<br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 5pp from a wooden elf. As for the magical staff, u can try to get high<br/>\n&gt;level<br/>\n&gt;&gt; magicians to sell u a summon one. Most of them would do it for free, but<br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; prepared to pay a few gold for them. They are almost same stats as the<br/>\n&gt;great<br/>\n&gt;&gt; staff, but magical and nosave. I will try to get you the staff, and i<br/>\n&gt;think<br/>\n&gt;&gt; should be easier cos its pending lore and no one would want to get stuck<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with them. bbc is Bone bladed claymore. Its quite sucky actually,<br/>\n&gt;-agility i<br/>\n&gt;&gt; think.
