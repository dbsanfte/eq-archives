Name will be <br/>\nVeteran, last name (when I hit 20) will be Soldier :)<br/>\nSince no people Druid there I think I can survive lah. But damn cham, how to <br/>\ncatch up with all of you har? I power level my Cazic Druid for 6 hours and <br/>\nmanaged to hit 7 in Misty, almost 8 liao. At that rate I have to powergame <br/>\nlike xiao to get even with all of you all.<br/>\nDon&#39;t know if can do the same in Innoruk anot, hope can lah, or I also damn <br/>\nsianz. See all of you level 20 I level 10 cannot group :(<br/>\nOne more thing, what&#39;s is everyone&#39;s name in Innoruk? List down leh, if not <br/>\nI go in I also blur blur one, and what name is the guild ah? I new to this <br/>\nlist so don&#39;t know.<br/>\nBTW, I just found this out yesterday. I am on a mapping expedition in <br/>\nE.Karana and came across a spot where Gnoll Reaver (Day) and Undead Reavers <br/>\n(Night) spawn. It&#39;s at the lower left corner of E.Karana and all I can say <br/>\nis that they give obscene XP for their level. All con blue to my level 18 <br/>\nMage and after killing abt. 40 in a group of 3, I am almost 19 liao(from <br/>\nonly 1 bubble), just abt. 1/2 a bubble more. The number may be wrong, but in <br/>\na 3 way XP split, I can always see the change in my XP bar when my group <br/>\nkill one. Go check it out and see for yourself. Loot wise is sucks, they <br/>\ndrop occasional RawHide armor and at most carry 1pp. Most is abt. a few sp <br/>\nto 3gp. Last, don&#39;t think of soloing there, those Undeads ones will ignore <br/>\nthe pet and go straight for you. Other also cannot solo, they hit for like <br/>\n30-40 and can stun.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
