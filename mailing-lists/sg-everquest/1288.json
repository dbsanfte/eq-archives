I thot at least can make some easy banded liao, but spend my last few pp to make 2 banded gorgets (easiest banded","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-746125499\">So far spend 200pp to get my smithing to 95.  I thot at least can make some <br/>\neasy banded liao, but spend my last few pp to make 2 banded gorgets <br/>\n(easiest banded to make) yet both FAILED!  *(%%$#   Problem is, at skill <br/>\n95, skewers no longer give me anymore skill, tat means I need to throw in <br/>\nMORE money to start making banded stuffs to rise my skill!  So far I&#39;m <br/>\nstill making loss when I make banded gorget and sell back to npc, not to <br/>\nconsidered the failure yet.  The cheapest banded also cost me close to 2pp <br/>\nto make, sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m broke again, and have been staying at lvl 20 for a week (due to <br/>\ncamping for dirk and smithing).  It will take me at least another week to <br/>\nhard work b4 I can earn enuff money for the next round of smith training ;(<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: Met a barbarian shaman at bird island over weekend, his smithing is <br/>\n104.  He told me he spend 300pp so far, and the reason for spending so much <br/>\nmore is due to his low INT.  For those who wanna take up smithing, better <br/>\ncreate a new high INT char to do so instead of using the existing char (if <br/>\nINT below 100), otherwise not only will u smith until vomit blood like me, <br/>\nu will smith until u cry man!
