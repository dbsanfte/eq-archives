I got it from UOSS, <br/>\nre-formatted it into MS word for you guys to print out for reading and <br/>\nreference.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main points are:<br/>\n- Form an XP efficient group (dun get a full house hunting 1 single blue <br/>\nmob)<br/>\n- Move as a group, dun leave the slow ones behind (Bard pls take note of <br/>\nthis point, dun leave those with slow system and run by yaself, hehe.  In <br/>\nthe end all get killed or lost all over the place).<br/>\n- Get prepared and rdy for the hunt (For God sake dun come to hunt and <br/>\nstart begging for foods/drinks, there are many npc merchants that sell this <br/>\nat 1 sp plus.  I get at least 40 of each when time I buy my supplies.  FYI <br/>\nwhen teaming with FF so far, I never ask a single food and drink from him, <br/>\nthou he can summon alot.  Those players who have the habit of begging <br/>\nfood/drink every where they go, I will ask them to fly kite, hehe).<br/>\n- PLAN, most impt, PLAN.  Tanks dun act cowboy and charge b4 casters are <br/>\nrdy.  Magi keep ya pet at ya side or dismiss it when hunt at heavily <br/>\ntrained places.  Casters dun scare of OOM and use ya mana at the right <br/>\ntime.  Make up an escape plan b4 hunting.  Set a sentry when casters <br/>\nmediating.  Stated a clear looting order b4 members start to fight for <br/>\nloot. Etc etc.<br/>\n- Always compromise and be patient.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake a good look inside.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
