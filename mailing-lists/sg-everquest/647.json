If","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1135602836\">Hehe, thx for the help for getting me a runed totem staff.  Actually I&#39;m <br/>\nalready saving money for that, just that meanwhile cant afford to pay it <br/>\nyet.  If anyone come across pple selling this staffs below 25pp, pls give <br/>\nfor me.  I wil pay back ASAP ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, is woven armor good?  How is the AC and wt compare to clothes?  Any <br/>\nspecial features?  I heard abt some swampy area quite easy to get netted <br/>\narmors which can be sold at fairly good price.  Can a group of 2-3 lvl <br/>\n10-12 go that place?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, oh senior wiz, pls grant me knowledge abt binding.  If I&#39;m in a <br/>\ngroup, and we come to a town, who shld I target on in order to bind ALL <br/>\ngroup members to the town (or do I have to target one by one and cast <br/>\nbind?).  Say later we went to desert cave entrance as a group and I wanna <br/>\nbind ONLY myself at the entrance (anyway out town I can only bind myself <br/>\nand not the group right?), targetting myself and cast bind will only bind <br/>\nmyself or will affect the rest of the members?  Or, do I have to quit from <br/>\ngroup, bind myself there then re-join group?  Any tips for binding myself <br/>\nnear hunting ground - so that I dun have to run so far if I die, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wednesday, June 16, 1999 5:18 PM, Leshrec [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Leshrec&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Alamak I also using almost full cloth armor lah.
