To recover my usage fee so far.  I wanna enjoy the game FOC whenever <br/>\npossible, and earn abit for sacrifacing my time for my sleep, heh.<br/>\n2. It&#39;s really a waste to terminate an acct with high lvl wiz, afterall it <br/>\ntook me several months to achieve it.  I will rather sell it and let <br/>\nsomeone else to con&#39;t playing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve come up with a nice idea, using wiz to camp for item and earn RL <br/>\nmoney.  My main purpose of play games is to enjoy it instead of making <br/>\nmoney.  If it doesn&#39;t take up much time to use ya method to earn some quick <br/>\nbuck, I will give it a try.  But if it required days of camping like Jboot, <br/>\nI will rather spend time playing UO, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, 14 October, 1999 10:05 AM, Lim Choong Ee <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:choongee@...\">choongee@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Lim Choong Ee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:choongee@...\">choongee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i dunno for u guys why u want to sell EQ?<br/>\n&gt; I dun play EQ for fun actually,hheeh maybe<br/>\n&gt; some but main concent is to make real life<br/>\n&gt; outta EQ :p<br/>\n&gt; Sold a few K of pp n some rare item already<br/>\n&gt; make a total of about 600(S$1000) us dollar.<br/>\n&gt; If u think EQ as a money making media , maybe<br/>\n&gt; it will hook on u back to EQ if u can see the<br/>\n&gt; fortune it will bring to u :p<br/>\n&gt; And it really stupid to sell the account<br/>\n&gt; of a high 30 plus char away :p<br/>\n&gt; it better to playn milk more pp n item to sell<br/>\n&gt; like this u make more money.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was thinking this upcoming of new server<br/>\n&gt; wether u guys want to switch server with me<br/>\n&gt; where we gather all singapore player to the new<br/>\n&gt; server?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lim Choong Ee<br/>\n&gt; System Engineer<br/>\n&gt; 100 Eunos Ave 7, Singapore 409572<br/>\n&gt; Tel: (65)7476666-362 Fax: (65)7416066<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
