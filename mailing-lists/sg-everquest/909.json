Zanderion... i think if u can made it to freeport u will certainly gain alot more than u r currently... i wish i could though BUT i think almost everything will KOS me... so gotta wait abit...  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  and actually dying 7-8 times is not that much lah... since i died more than 10 times b4 i got to level 2... in fact... i die n die again b4 i even get to my corpse... perhaps i chose the wrong class to start since i think Dark Elf got a harder starting area... BUT THEN... i guess this will teach me survival in a hard area b4 i suffer any penalties... :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Fred<br/>\n  p/s : i think names are impt... quite an impt aspect of roleplay... <br/>\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  SC Cheng, Freddy<br/>\n  Mobile-Internet Laboratory, Multimedia Laboratory,<br/>\n  NTT DoCoMo R&D Center C212,<br/>\n  3-5, Hikari no Oka, Yokosuka-Shi,<br/>\n  Kanagawa, 239-8536, Japan<br/>\n  Tel : +81 468-40-3497<br/>\n  Fax: +81 468-40-3788<br/>\n  Email : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
