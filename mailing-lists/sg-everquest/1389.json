My RL friend, also kena name change by GM when he use a goon <br/>\nname (something meaningless in RL, like those u select).  GM told him &quot;Very <br/>\ncreative name but not suitable, let me change it for you&quot;.  He is still <br/>\nlucky tat GM tell him personally, but many others&#39; name kena change w/o <br/>\nnotice.  They just login and find themselves &#39;another person&#39; ;)  Those <br/>\npple who kena complaints alot - esp those who make a name for the trade <br/>\nskill service they provide, their customers no longer recognise or able to <br/>\nfind him.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, GM didnt give my friend a choice when changing his name, he just give <br/>\nhim a msg, change his name (using the random name engine I guess) and <br/>\n*poof*, gone! ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: FYI, Garren&#39;s 2nd name is Irongrip, but I myself see another tank in <br/>\nLake Rathetear call Irongrip, ONLY Irongrip (1st name).  I thot you cannot <br/>\nselect a 2nd name which other use it as a 1st name but seem like I&#39;m wrong. <br/>\n Anyway I have no intention to get a 2nd name now, I enjoy the secrective <br/>\nindentity, esp when some lvl 20 casters behave yaya until they see my <br/>\nspells, hahahaha ;)  For those who wanna get or gonna get a 2nd name, try <br/>\nto create a dummy char using that name 1st, at least it&#39;s safer.  So now <br/>\nthere is 2 Irongrip in Innoruuk, I really dunno why these sex pervert like <br/>\nto &quot;grip&#39; so much, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tuesday, 27 July, 1999 1:43 AM, Chen Lizhi <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polarcoordinates@...\">polarcoordinates@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Chen Lizhi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polarcoordinates@...\">polarcoordinates@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I cannot use Veteran in Innoruk, cos my Druid in Cazic already called<br/>\n&gt; Veteran liao.
