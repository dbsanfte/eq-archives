I remember teaming with a guy name similar <br/>\nand he is the KNN CCB PCB HGK who loot everything whenever he got the <br/>\nchance even thou we all agreed to do alpha loot b4 the hunt.  I think there <br/>\nare always bastards and looters everywhere, whether in UO or EQ.  My style <br/>\nis simple - steal kill from these bastards.  These few days I&#39;ve been <br/>\nhunting solo in Ro Derv Camp, and there are always 1-3 groups who hunting <br/>\nat the same camp.  As a weak wiz, I can easily used up my mana for every <br/>\ncutt I killed.  Fine, so I will climb to the mountain and med, occasionally <br/>\nstand up and see what are the other guys doing.   So far it&#39;s kinda normal <br/>\nthat other parties will get at least 1 kills b4 I come down from the <br/>\nmountain with full mana, if not 2 kills per groups.  Yet many players still <br/>\ngot the cheek to attack my kill.  Simple right? It&#39;s so obvious to rotate <br/>\nkills with just 2-3 groups, but there is forever cock-face who &#39;blur blur&#39; <br/>\nrush ahead and attacking the cutt.  What I will just do is to wait, wait <br/>\ntill they hurt the monster by 30-40%, then I start to nuke and steal the <br/>\nkill.  Hehe, this is something I like most about wiz - nuking - swift as <br/>\nwind, hehe.  And most of the time they will learn to share after the lesson <br/>\n- sometime it&#39;s kinda surprised to see how these players suddently turn so <br/>\n&#39;alert&#39; and finally know whose&#39;s kill is the next spawn, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother occasion I was hunting with a ranger (both solo), a 3 men group <br/>\ncome and ask to take turn to kill.  Fine with me, no harm share abit. <br/>\n However, once the ranger and the group each take a kill, the group attack <br/>\nthe 3rd monsters when I was abt to root&nuke!  WTF??!  I heck care and <br/>\nstart nuking what is rightfully mine.  Within 10 sec the cutt is down and I <br/>\ngo and loot it.  Guess wat?  I receive a tell from a DE from the group <br/>\nsaying something like this &quot;WTF YOU IDIOT KILL STEALER, THAT KILL IS OUR!! <br/>\n YOU DICK HEAD!!&quot;  Pardon me WTF?  They just tool a kill and they shout at <br/>\nme for stealing their kill? Hehe, so I start to quarrel with that guy and <br/>\nrealised that what he meant by &#39;sharing&#39; in the first place is to let <br/>\nEVERYONE at the camp to take a kill!  That mean - if it&#39;s a 6 men team, I <br/>\nwill have to wait for them to kill 6 times b4 I get mine, hehe.  Kinda <br/>\nshocked, but can anyone on the list enlighten me - is this the way EQ share <br/>\nkills?  I myself so far join several groups but none practice this.  Maybe <br/>\nI&#39;m wrong but it really sound kinda funny to me ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, June 24, 1999 5:44 PM, Gary Qui Hong Loong <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Gary Qui Hong Loong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     2 days ago, I was at Befallen hunting for a BBC (which I don&#39;t need,<br/>\n&gt; just wanna get one to sell of cash, I&#39;m broke. Trust me, even when u<br/>\n&gt; reach my lvl, u will still be struggling for $$$). The party consist of<br/>\n&gt; Garren (ie me), Ironbuket, Iyenya, Senorn and Phenix. We were lucky that<br/>\n&gt; the first Troll SK we killed had the BBC. That was the end of the good<br/>\n&gt; part. Phenix then immediately stole the BBC and refuses to pass over the<br/>\n&gt; BBC to me (funny thing was that they agreed to do alpha loot and my name<br/>\n&gt; ended up as first. But I did said that the group can buy the BBC and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll spilt the cash with the group). And when he (ie Phenix) tried to<br/>\n&gt; run out of Befallen, he died. Okie, that would have been end of story.<br/>\n&gt; Guy looted group BBC and died on his way out, and loses his stuff. But,<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re kind hearted enough to help him to get his stuff back. Then his<br/>\n&gt; friend Senorn was given permission to loot his corpse. Okie, letting his<br/>\n&gt; friend Senorn loot the Phenix is almost as good as losing the BBC. They<br/>\n&gt; are friends. But, dued to some lag and wierd shit, Senorn dropped his<br/>\n&gt; SBH, and lost the BBC too. Now, Iyenya picked up the SBH. Okie, so we<br/>\n&gt; gotten the SBH instead of the BBC, well it&#39;s better than nothing. But,<br/>\n&gt; we didn&#39;t sell it. We held on to it and see who claim to lose his SBH.<br/>\n&gt; Both Phenix and Senorn claimed to have dropped the SBH and both claimed<br/>\n&gt; that each other had the BBC. But, why did I choose to believe that<br/>\n&gt; Phenix had stolen the BBC (the 2nd time and also con the SBH off Iyenya,<br/>\n&gt; which is likely to belong to Senorn)? B&#39;cos when I went down to Oasis<br/>\n&gt; and asked 1 day later, ppl beside him said that he&#39;s holding a BBC. I<br/>\n&gt; started to taunt him (PRICK was about the kindest thing I said about<br/>\n&gt; him) and challenged him to a duel which Phenix refused. One thing I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; saying is that I&#39;ll never ever want to be in a group with Phenix (who<br/>\n&gt; stole the group BBC and stole/sold his friend Senorn SBH, which Senorn<br/>\n&gt; (a warrior) had to sell off his armor to get another SBH). So if you<br/>\n&gt; ever have to band with Phenix, think again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gary Qui Hong Loong<br/>\n&gt; Technical Support Executive<br/>\n&gt; Pacific Internet Technical Support Department .<br/>\n&gt; Pacific Internet Limited.<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt; Pacific Surf : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pacific.net.sg\">http://www.pacific.net.sg</a><br/>\n&gt; Technical Support Helpline : 1800-8723330<br/>\n&gt; Customer Support Helpline : 1800-8725055<br/>\n&gt; 89 Science Park Drive<br/>\n&gt; #04-09/12 The Rutherford<br/>\n&gt; Singapore 118261<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Attention ONElist list owners.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out the new &quot;DEFAULT MODERATED STATUS&quot; option.
