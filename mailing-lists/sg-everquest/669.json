Woven very ex when those<br/>\n&gt; smelly trolls sell them and the only one i got was a mask which i bought for<br/>\n&gt; 5pp from a wooden elf. As for the magical staff, u can try to get high level<br/>\n&gt; magicians to sell u a summon one. Most of them would do it for free, but be<br/>\n&gt; prepared to pay a few gold for them. They are almost same stats as the great<br/>\n&gt; staff, but magical and nosave. I will try to get you the staff, and i think<br/>\n&gt; should be easier cos its pending lore and no one would want to get stuck<br/>\n&gt; with them. bbc is Bone bladed claymore. Its quite sucky actually, -agility i<br/>\n&gt; think. Only good thing bout it its its damage cos its a 2hander.<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, June 16, 1999 12:22 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [sg-everquest] Back to Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Wah piang, u pple so half-hearted, come to Prexus and go back &*^%!#@.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *balls kena bang*  OK lor, left me alone also sian, I also come back lah<br/>\n&gt; &gt;;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Btw, we got high lvls and low lvls - me lvl 12 wiz - simi class?
