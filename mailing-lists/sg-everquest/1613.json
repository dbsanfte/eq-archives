In the end it became a corpse retrieving session, some of us even <br/>\ndied few times, ouch.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter everypne get their corpses, we proceed to upper guk.  Loot is quite <br/>\nok, everyone get something I guess, mainly mesh (mostly given to YY, see he <br/>\nlaughting at the corner? hehe), woven & netted stuffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, come to the later part, we started to trigger trains, and pple <br/>\nstarts to die again.  Worst is Deadflower, who is binded in FP and died FEW <br/>\ntimes in a row, running from FP to Guk.  He is the most unlucky person for <br/>\nthat night, coz he died so many times tat he dropped lvl, PLUS his SBS is <br/>\ndeleted coz when we loot his and AA&#39;s corpse, both got SBS (lore item).<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to the high number of casulties in Guk, we decided to go elsewhere for <br/>\nhunting on Sat.  H/w, I&#39;m unable to join becoz I was busy helping <br/>\nDeadflower to get back his lvl in Lake Rathetear and also camp for his SBS <br/>\n(YES, got it after the 21th trainer I killed, better than last time, where <br/>\nI need to kill 24 for AA&#39;s SBS).  Boy that will be the last time I camp for <br/>\ndirk or SBS man, next time I gonna gate u guys to camp yaself liao. I feel <br/>\nso pai seh when everybody leave the hill when I camp there (one nuke <br/>\nalready hurt trainer more than 50%, no horse run, hehe).  Some even renamed <br/>\nthe trainer hill after my name for that few hours - Ziltus Hill, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a last note, I think it&#39;s best to have at least lvl 20 (I mean everybody <br/>\nin the group) b4 u start to chong Guk.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
