The  princple is actually very straigh","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1031991555\">Hehe no lah, just trying to suggest to u guys to throw in 5-8pp on brewing <br/>\n1st rather than spending on other stuffs.  The  princple is actually very <br/>\nstraigh forward - buy a chicken or 5 eggs 1st.  If u buy 5 eggs, u can <br/>\neither eat them up (spend on items) or hatch them for chickens (buy scrolls <br/>\nand use them to hunt for money, but take longer time at ya lvl,  imagine <br/>\nthe time & money u need to spend to keep the chickens, hehe). <br/>\n Alternatively, u can buy a chicken (train ya brewing) and let it lay eggs <br/>\n(money).  In the short run, spending money on eggs more shiok, in the med <br/>\nrun, spending on chicken is more practical.  In the long run, ultimately <br/>\nboth achieve the same result, hahaha.<br/>\n<br/>\nNice chicken and egg theory huh, LOL ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a comparison.  U spend 4 night hunting earning 40pp.  H/w, u can also <br/>\nspend 5-8pp to max brewing to 135 in 2 hrs, and another 2 hrs to make 20pp. <br/>\n So first night u make 20pp plus max skill.  Just spend another 3 nights of <br/>\n4 hrs u can get 140pp (MIN) in total easily, hehe.  At this rate u can earn <br/>\na FBR in 1 week.  This remind me of my UO kakis Asmandi Dragon who used to <br/>\nspend 1 whole week just chopping tree making wooden shields and sell to npc <br/>\nin order to buy his 2-storey house, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this msg will motivate u guys to pick up brewing, it&#39;s really worth <br/>\nspending time and effort.  Of coz, I dun expect u to brew for 4 whole day, <br/>\nI myself brew 2 hrs also bu ta han liao.  With brewing skill, rather than <br/>\nhunting desperately for $ (which can be a pain when u face a whole camp of <br/>\nstealers or no one wanna team with u), u can actually spend 1 hr daily <br/>\nbrewing to give yaself some stable source of money.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeshrec got a good point on buying scrolls.  For the 1st 2 cycles, I try to <br/>\nbuy all scrolls only to find out that I only used 2-3 at most.  In the end <br/>\nI spend so much money on useless scrolls.  When I come to 3rd circle <br/>\nspells, I seek Leshrec&#39;s advice on which scrolls to buy (since we both wiz, <br/>\nit&#39;s nice to have someone ahead of u sometime to share with u his <br/>\nexperience, hehe).  Coming to 4th circle I more or less know wat kinda <br/>\nspell is impt for wiz.  Lvl 5 there is more useful spells, so I buy more <br/>\nscrolls.  With the help of my brewing, I already got all the wanted scrolls <br/>\nfor my lvl 20 (all gate, dd and armor spells except instill which I heard <br/>\nneed research?), and still saving for my Gossmer Robe or FBR.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, if u can, try to get the dimension bag scroll 1st. This is a VERY <br/>\nuseful spells for low str caster coz this summoned bag can carry stuffs at <br/>\nweightless(?)!  The only thing u need to remember is to empty them b4 u log <br/>\nsince they will disappear when u log.  At high lvl, u will loot stuffs like <br/>\nbronze weap and ring/rawhide armors which r pretty heavy.  So this bag will <br/>\ncome in VERY handy.  U can even sell it to non-magi for some money if they <br/>\nintend to camp at wulu wulu place w/o merchants & bank! Since magi can <br/>\nsummon bandage, u guys got the cheapest mean to train bind wound, which is <br/>\na very nice skills to have when soloing with a pet.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne &#39;mis&#39;-concept abt binding is tat many casters take it as a source of <br/>\nincome, but frankly speaking I only take it as a utility spells.  I never <br/>\nbother to offer bind for a fee unless I&#39;m in good mood or I&#39;m abt to log - <br/>\nfor free.  Of coz donation welcome.  So far I heard the max amt pple <br/>\nwilling to pay is 1pp, and so far I leave it to other to give me as a <br/>\ndonation - max 5gp so far, hehe.  The power of binding cannot be measure <br/>\nvia monetary term.  It&#39;s one of the most useful spells casters have, not as <br/>\na trade but as the ability to adventure.  Comparing with the tank who cant <br/>\nbind, we casters are so fortunate that we dun have to spend time running <br/>\nall the way to our corpse.  U r right that lvl shld come first b4 money, <br/>\nesp when u r below lvl 16.  Dun complain too much abt lousy loot.  We used <br/>\nto hunt caimen and croc at oasis and the best loot on them is a piece of <br/>\nmeat tat we can sell for 7cp, hahaha.  Most of the pple dun even bother to <br/>\npick them up.  Only poor wiz like me go around picking the rubbish, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also picking up smithy slowly now, after spending 20 skill point on it. <br/>\n H/w, when camping at HH I&#39;m now having problems buying sharpening stone. <br/>\n Anyone know where can I get that in HH?  Does HH got a bank?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Monday, 05 July, 1999 1:07 PM, Leshrec [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Leshrec&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My suggestions on buying spell.
