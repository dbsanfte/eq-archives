U can only access it in ur spellbook anyway.<br/>\nOne thing about melee skill ofr wiz, forget it. U can&#39;t do much with it at<br/>\nlater level, though it&#39;s better than nothing. heheh. There is no total skill<br/>\ncpa like in UO but there is a maximum skill u can get at a lvl depending on<br/>\nthe skill and the class/race of ur character. eg, a lvl 1 druid can heal<br/>\nmuch better than my lvl 9 paladin.<br/>\n<br/>\n    The trade skills are not meant for beginner players. U gotta to have<br/>\nlots of cash to play around with, though tailoring is good for beginning<br/>\nplayers (as like in UO, go figures. heheh).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;* Singapore EQ Mailing List&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 14, 1999 09:14<br/>\nSubject: [sg-everquest] Skills for wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yo,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since no one has made an wizard amg our kakis, I&#39;ve decided to make one 2<br/>\n&gt; days ago.  Now my wiz is lvl 3.  So far I&#39;ve spend my practice points on<br/>\n2H<br/>\n&gt; blunt, chanelling, adjure, evoke and alter.  I still have 10 points with<br/>\n&gt; me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any suggestion what other skills to train?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how the skills thingy work, if there is a total skill cap for<br/>\n&gt; your char.  I wish to learn some  $$$ skills which do not required much<br/>\n$$$<br/>\n&gt; (eg on buying material, initial investment and l/t investment), any<br/>\n&gt; suggestion?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So far I didnt spend any practice points in melee skills.  I started off<br/>\n&gt; with a dagger and when I earn enuff $$$ to buy worn great stave, I keep on<br/>\n&gt; using it.  The skills rise when I hunt with the staves.  I would also like<br/>\n&gt; to seek advice if it&#39;s worth to train unarmed melee skills for wiz (like<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; monk).  If there is a total skill cap, I will try to specialize in 1 or 2<br/>\n&gt; melee skills.  If not skill cap, I dun mind training unarmed combat skill<br/>\n&gt; since after the newbie period, I wouldn&#39;t resurrect with a dagger, right?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any recommendation what spells are good for wiz?  Also, is there any way<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; make medation a hotkey? (sorry for those who reply me on my previous<br/>\n&gt; mediation query, I need to ask again coz I dunno what u mean)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Btw, my wiz is a high-elf, name is Ziltus, after his long-lost brother<br/>\n&gt; Zilred (enchanter) ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; How many communities do you think join ONElist each day?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; More than 1,000!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
