Died<br/>\nthere 3 times but managed to get gossimer armor tho. Big thanks to Yiyang<br/>\nand Garren for their help although we didn&#39;t managed to get any BBC ( Btw,<br/>\nif yer sticking to 1st level, its quite safe but beware of trains. Usually<br/>\nyou don&#39;t manage to zone out becos of locked doors or there are too many<br/>\nstuff hitting ya. Trains there can go up to about 10+ mobs and its not<br/>\npretty when they are all ghouls and elf skeletons....<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, June 21, 1999 11:27 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [sg-everquest] Report on Guk expedition<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Err, I would said it&#39;s worst than CB.  It&#39;s a total failure to team a lvl<br/>\n&gt;6, a lvl 12 and a lvl 19 - big &quot;generation&quot; gap.  I think we spend more<br/>\n&gt;than 2-3 hrs in order to get everyone their stuffs back SAFETY at<br/>\n&gt;commonland/freeport. LOL.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just imagine a weak wiz like me carrying more than double my STR allows me,<br/>\n&gt;hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I guess I wont go that CB place until I get invisible spell a lvl 16.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tonight I&#39;m going to Befallen with 2 HK friends - a lvl 13 bard and a lvl<br/>\n&gt;13 magi.  Any lvl 12-14 who wanna join us feel free to give me a tell when<br/>\n&gt;u login.  Advice welcome.  Btw, which lvl is safe for us, considering those<br/>\n&gt;undead train?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Zil<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Saturday, June 19, 1999 3:59 AM, Sereph [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Sereph &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I declare the raid to be a total failure. We didn&#39;t get much of what we<br/>\n&gt;&gt; want and in the end, Gary and I died while trying to get out of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Innothule swamp and LKW got lost. We resorted to all sort of funny ways<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and manage to get our stuff back.
