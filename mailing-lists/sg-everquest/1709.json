Those who can USE the artifact(s) themselves AND are PHYSICALLY<br/>\n&gt; involved<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the hunting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Those who are PHYSICALLY involved in the hunting AND hunt it for<br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; secondary char.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Those who are PHYSICALLY involved in the hunting AND hunt it for<br/>\n&gt; friend<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or cash.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (NB: Since it&#39;s a lore item, you cannot ask someone who have the<br/>\n&gt; artifact<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to loot on your behalf.  U can only ask someone to hunt on ya behalf<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; PROVIDED they dun need one, as in #3).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The dangers:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. JK Skull & RTS r dropped by the gnolls (high sha and emi) at the<br/>\n&gt; zone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; entrance from SK to LR (during the day).  The gnolls, gnoll guards and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gnoll shamans lvl below 18 I think, but the shaman will heal the high<br/>\n&gt; sha<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and emi (both ard lvl 20) when we fight, even thou they themselves are<br/>\n&gt; con<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; green to us and will not be involved in the fight.  I think those below<br/>\n&gt; 15,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when trying to walk thru the camp, will invite a train of 3+4+3=10<br/>\n&gt; gnolls<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on you! ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The camp will turn to undead ruins at night, where skeletons, greater<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mummies (lvl 23-24) and dry bones (lvl 24-25) will haunt the place.<br/>\n&gt;  Again,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any one below lvl 20 and walk pass the camp may invite a train of<br/>\n&gt; undeads<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =&gt;Our plan is to camp near zone and the high lvls will help to kill the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mobs and ask those lower lvls to come in to loot.  Of coz, in this<br/>\n&gt; case,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; priority will give to those who phyically involved in the fighting 1st<br/>\n&gt; ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Water Crystal Staff<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s dropped by a OVERPOWERED lvl 24-26 aqua goblin called Webclaw.<br/>\n&gt;  Webbie<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can found in serveral spots in LR.  Its magical hit VERY HARD and is<br/>\n&gt; VERY<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; AGRO in water, and thing get worse if we enagaed it in the water (we<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disturbed more often when casting, and swim slower, if we lose, chances<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that we will get killed and corpse sinks into the deep lake, then<br/>\n&gt; corpse<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seeking and looting session will start).  After much investigation<br/>\n&gt; (I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been camping in LR from lvl 20 to 27), I will lead the team to the<br/>\n&gt; spawn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spot of Webbie, which is the tower isle (extreme end from zone, that<br/>\n&gt; mean<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is NO way to flee if we lose UNLESS we bind near zone, gate out<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; zone).  The plan is to root Webbie (btw it also run VERY fast) the<br/>\n&gt; moment<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it spawn before it run towards shore.  I&#39;ve tried rooting Web in water<br/>\n&gt; (I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know other spots it shows its face) but seem like a bug will make it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disappear the moment it is rooted in water (I won&#39;t advise to melee it<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; water unless Garren is coming, coz it&#39;s not funny to search for ya<br/>\n&gt; corpse<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the deep blue lake).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is 2 concerns regarding the danger for this hunt:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a. To get to the tower isle, you have to swim across the whole lake.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Danger arise when u meet some giant fresh sharks (bigger size than<br/>\n&gt; orge) ,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; frogloks, aqua goblin, water snakes, or worse, Webclaw itself and<br/>\n&gt; Froglok<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Prince (lvl 30 plus, very powerful, con red, and very very agro, out to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kill EVERYTHING in lake).  This problem can be overcome by taking a<br/>\n&gt; boat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from gnoll camp to tower isle (but take much longer).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; b. The spawn spot for Webclaw, UNFORTUNATELY, is also the spawn spot of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Froglok Prince (lvl 30 plus, very powerful and agro) and a deep sea<br/>\n&gt; goblin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pet (lvl 22 to 25 I think).  With FF and me, it&#39;s no big deal taking<br/>\n&gt; Web,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or even when the pet spawn at the same time.  H/w, SUAY SUAY, if the<br/>\n&gt; Prince<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spawn during the fight or come to us, both of us will be the one to<br/>\n&gt; gate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; first, since we will have NO fight versus the Prince ;(<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This hunting trip is NOT for anyone below 4th circle (even if we buff u<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; full and guard u all time). Unlike the Guk hunt, it&#39;s VERY difficult to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; find ya corpse if u died in lake, and chances is that u will lose ya<br/>\n&gt; stuffs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; forever.  To prevent wasting more than half of the time finding/looting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; corpses, this trip is STRICTLY for 4th & above circle chars (lvl 12 for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; casters, not sure for others) only.  Frankly speaking I believe all<br/>\n&gt; kakis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; got at least a 4th circle chars, whether primarily or secondary chars.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Just dun bring ya newbie char along pls.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; LAST NOTE:  This is not a XP or $$$ hunting trip.  There will be no<br/>\n&gt; hunting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of aviak guards etc for xp and coins.  It&#39;s a very task-specific trip -<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the 3 artifacts for those who need them and get out of the place (I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gate to Fay, Tox, NK by then).  Anyone who are impatient while waiting<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the spawn and turn to hunt others will bear their own risk soloing it<br/>\n&gt; (lvl<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 20 to 22), coz we will not waste time and mana helping anyone to gain<br/>\n&gt; xp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there.  Webclaw spawn and run very fast from tower to shore, maybe<br/>\n&gt; within 5<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seconds or so, we can&#39;t afford to miss it, given that it&#39;s a rare<br/>\n&gt; spawn.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; PREPARATION:  Everyone please get ready AT LEAST 40 foods, 40 drinks<br/>\n&gt; and 40<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of your spell reagients (if applicable). I&#39;m trying to make it a sharp<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sweet fruitful trip, so pls dun come to assembly area then asking for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; food/drink etc.  FF can summon 20 bandages each for those who need (thx<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; FF!) but I dun wanna see him wasting time summoning food/drinks unless<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  really took so long to camp for the stuffs (40 food/drinks can last me<br/>\n&gt; 10<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hrs hunt I think).  FF and I can actually do all these by ourselves but<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have decided to help all others (esp casters) to get also, so pls do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone a favor by preparing yourself ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BINDING:  All casters will bind once they zone into LR.  We then move<br/>\n&gt; on to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; arena (which many lamers invis inside and KOS whoever that zone in,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the only binding zone in the region, sigh).  FF and I will go in to<br/>\n&gt; scout<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the entrance to ensure it&#39;s cleared.  We will then take turn to invis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (guarding) and binding, asking the others to come in one by one.  Once<br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; binded, we then go back to gnoll camp and start the hunting.  NO<br/>\n&gt; arguement<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on hunting at gnoll camp 1st then bind the non-casters, coz if anyone<br/>\n&gt; died,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they will have to run few zones back to LR and it&#39;s a total WASTE of<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Make it an effective and efficient hunt pls!!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HUNT PHASE ONE:  Below lvl 20 all sit at zone, above lvl 20s will move<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to hunt.  Once we got what we want, we continue to hunt and ask those<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; zone come in to loot.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HUNT PHASE TWO:  We will all move to tower isle.  Once there, all lvl<br/>\n&gt; 25<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and above will stay at the mid way of the Webclaw running path, all<br/>\n&gt; INVIS.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  We will root and nuke the mob once it spawn and run towards water.<br/>\n&gt;  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rest will sit further away to see show and prepare to loot ;)  The lvl<br/>\n&gt; 25+<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will camp at a safe distant from the Prince spawn spot. If Prince<br/>\n&gt; spawn,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just stay invis and let it run to water.  When Web spawn, KILL IT!  If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Prince spawn when we fighting Webclaw, all GATE.  Those who cannot gate<br/>\n&gt; -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; May God bless you ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The hunt is scheduled on Friday night (14th August, S&#39;pore/HK time)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; starting at 11pm (tentative plan is 3 hrs hunt), interested parties<br/>\n&gt; please<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; meet at the Guard Tower at North Karana (just before the zone to SK, at<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bridge).  Those who dunno the way, pls find someone to bring you there.<br/>\n&gt;  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; personally will be opening a portal from Felwithe Gate at 10.50pm to<br/>\n&gt; NK,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you can tag along my portal if you want ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ziltus Planeswalker<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Organizer, Mission WRJ (WCS/RTS/JKS)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; How do you enter ONElist&#39;s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; By joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
