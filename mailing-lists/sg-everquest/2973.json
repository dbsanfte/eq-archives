Now I <br/>\nknow why BB always stop gaming so early, coz there are so many things else <br/>\nto do at the later part of the night, kkekekekekek ;P<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway the honor is mine.  Thx a million to u guys from coming to my <br/>\nwedding dinner.  I really enjoy myself very much during the dinner (and <br/>\nafter the dinner of coz, kekekeke ;P).  I&#39;m also pretty surprised to meet u <br/>\nguys coz u guys dun &#39;fit&#39; into my imagination, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nEg Merns - handsome dark-tone model-like young man, I really can&#39;t imagine <br/>\nthis young man pulling train and cause so many deaths, muhahahhaha ;P. <br/>\n Massiah - KNN also handsome but more to playboy style.  Dunno whether if <br/>\nhe is telling me the truth when he say he dun really speak up much.  Perhap <br/>\nhis seducive face already do all the talking, hehe.  Anson, he looks too <br/>\nyoung to have achieve so much in RL, in term of career.  Like a student but <br/>\nalready doing own business. KNN baby face woman pker, hehe.  Kellendil, i <br/>\nthink I didnt remember u wrongly, the one with sexy moustache?  I think you <br/>\nmust be always hanging at Mdm Wond seducing those young gals.  Gala - Wah <br/>\nliao, look youngest ah!  Another woman seducer with baby face.  Leshrec - <br/>\nno wonder once college open, never see ya face.   Got the height and look, <br/>\nI think if ah qua come also kena attracted by u, kekek.  Last but not <br/>\nleast, our big brother BiBi - face of &#39;satistifed&#39; married man with <br/>\nhappiness all over his face - I guess I will follow his foot step very <br/>\nsoon, muhahahah ;P<br/>\n<br/>\nThx to Garren and Tri for the blessings.  I might be cutting my gaming a <br/>\nbit but dun worry I cut down too much.  My wife already know my style many <br/>\nyrs ago and as long as I dun overplay, she won&#39;t nag at me, hehe.  Frankly <br/>\nspeaking, I really think we shld come out for a gathering every now and <br/>\nthen, like my UO kakis (some also in D2 and EQ).  Even it&#39;s just a coffee <br/>\ntalk-cock-sing-song session, it will help to bring us closer and understand <br/>\none another.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again, thx a million to all u guys who have fork out your precious <br/>\ntime to attend my wedding dinner.  I hope very soon we will have an <br/>\nopportunity to attend another kakis&#39;s wedding dinner ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus (de married man)<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: Zan, I&#39;m in office now.
