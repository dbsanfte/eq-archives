(wiz no need to go<br/>\n&gt; OOT to buy scrolls right?).  Btw, anyone try swiming to OOT b4?  During<br/>\n&gt; newbie time I once crash on boat and fall into OOT, swim to an isle and<br/>\n&gt; gate back to GF.  I&#39;m thinking maybe now it&#39;s time I can swim to OOT, if I<br/>\n&gt; happened to kill that npc too much, hehe.<br/>\n&gt; I have not travel by boating since lvl 20 liao, hehe....<br/>\n&gt; Btw wat&#39;s the lvl of that npc?  I heard it wont affect ya faction with<br/>\n&gt; dwarf city, true?<br/>\n&gt; U are a druid right?  Can teleport anywhere other then OOT (swim lor).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Come to think it, Fes and I used to be so concern abt factions with good<br/>\n&gt; npc, in the end we also killed until KOS by treants.  Compared with those<br/>\n&gt; kakis who hunt whole day in HH pass, it&#39;s very hard to reject the<br/>\n&gt; temptation to kill treants, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Thursday, 23 September, 1999 3:32 PM, Lim Choong Ee<br/>\n&gt; [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:choongee@...\">choongee@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Lim Choong Ee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:choongee@...\">choongee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yes the dwarf npc good to kill n great loot :p<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i once though so too until a point i realised something<br/>\n&gt; &gt; n i stop :p u r a wizard u can kill of coz, i&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ...u see the little dwarf female by the port where people needed to wait<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for boat?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kill enough of te dwarf n u never get to boat ride again in bucher:p<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Lim Choong Ee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:choongee@...\">choongee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one thing, there no way to riase the faction with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this npc dwarf as at moment :p<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think twice if u wanna travel to oot via butcher to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; roo :p<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; At 03:22 PM 9/23/99 +0800, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Finally I found some very good spots to hunt and lvling again, killing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;guards.  No, not killing evil guards, their spawns sux like hell.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wandering Nek forest one of the nights with FF, Fes and Feb, only<br/>\n&gt; whimpy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;guards, no dragoons.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Today I read tat at lvl 30-35, it&#39;s best to kill good guards, LOL.  See<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;those dwarf npc merchant in Buthcerblock? KILL THEM!  See the fisherman<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the port?  KILL THEM!!!  They dropped 2H axe tat can be sold for 22pp.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pple just need to hunt 10 days and they get 10,000pp!  Talk abt<br/>\n&gt; faction,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;who care?  Verant make it such that killing these npcs will not affect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;faction of similar race npc in elsewhere (eg u kill dawrf at dock but<br/>\n&gt; wont<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;get KOS in dwarf city).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;One of the main attractions tat EQ used to attract me is alighnment<br/>\n&gt; policy,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;just like my good old D&D games.  Now the faction thingy is so broken<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;we have to follow everyone to kill good races npc.  Sigh, at least<br/>\n&gt; killing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;innocent npc in UO DOES give a REAL faction (so call karma and title<br/>\n&gt; hit)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;hit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;What? U insist not to follow the rest to kill good races npc?  Ah, then<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;prepared to kena KS by those powerlvl gamers...Where else can casters<br/>\n&gt; solo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;hunting and lvling?  Yes...those 1-3 mob camps...now ya choice widen<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;solo guards hunting.  Yes, Verant think Yield Rule will fail (I&#39;m one of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;those who say I WILL NOT YIELD!  BAN ME MF!!!)..so they make more guards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;for all to kill/lvl.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;What? Not enuff guards to kill?  Try gnome guards, EK guards, Qeynos<br/>\n&gt; guard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;or even Halas guard if you dun wanan enter tat cold freezing city..hehe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Maybe when Ziltus reach lvl 50, it&#39;s time to leave EQ... ;P<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;And no, after UO and EQ, I will TRY not to touch any long-term online<br/>\n&gt; RPG.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess I will only try those session RPG like Winternight (Baldur&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Gate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;interface, AD&D rules) and Diablo 2 (Diablo kick ass, I have faith in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Diablo 2).  Sometime I wonder, how to cope up with more than 1 online<br/>\n&gt; RPG<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;like UO and EQ? Sad to say when EQ server down these 2 weeks, I login UO<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and find UO really DOES have more role-playing elements than EQ.  At<br/>\n&gt; least<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;when I dun feel like sticking my backside on the treant hill for 5 hrs<br/>\n&gt; in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;row, I dun have to do the same in UO.  I login my miner and mine some<br/>\n&gt; ores,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;make some tinkering items (jeeze I havent make any of the cool new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;tinkering stuffs since the patch) and branded weap (my craftman is GM<br/>\n&gt; smith<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;& tinker)...and I spend 20 min or so to make some furniture to<br/>\n&gt; redecorate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the rooms I used to trap polar bear for sparring (all deleted by GM, my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;craftman also master lumberjack and carpenter)...boy I start to miss UO<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;after 4 mths of playing EQ, hehe....<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Talk abt AC, I really very scare to go in...hehe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Ziltus<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lim Choong Ee<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Assistant Engineer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 100 Eunos Ave 7, Singapore 409572<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tel: (65)7476666-362 Fax: (65)7416066<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
