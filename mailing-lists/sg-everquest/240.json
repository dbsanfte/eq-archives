Team with <br/>\na lvl 6 ranger, lvl 6 cleric and a lvl 7 bard last night in CB (crashbone <br/>\nlair lah, not chxx bxx).  B4 the fight tat cleric so ya ya (he is so <br/>\nconfident that he make his char a pk char when he started off).  Keep <br/>\ntelling me he is very solid, can fight, can heal and cast spell.  The bard <br/>\nalso ya ya, say she always solo at CB entrance (but she really got a kick <br/>\nass axe from divnn).  In the end when we crashed with a train of 5 orc cen, <br/>\nbard disband and flee herself.  Cleric kena killed very fast (too confident <br/>\nthat he charge whenever he see orc, even I keep asking him to let the rest <br/>\nheal/med 1st).  In the end he is the 1st one who kena killed and restart <br/>\nback in Felwithe.  After he run to CB entrance, got killed by orc again b4 <br/>\nhe finish looting his corpse, and this thing happened ard 3~4, sigh.  The <br/>\nranger is quite ok, he always try to help, but I guess he is not familar <br/>\nwith the area and dunno how to use zone to stay alive when the opponents <br/>\nare too strong, in the end he also died 3 times.  I myself left solo alone <br/>\nand earn xp for them, by using travelling across zone to keep myself alive. <br/>\n After 1.5 hrs of hunting, I also quite sian and logout liao.<br/>\n<br/>\nDidnt get to meet Les last night, so dunno how to go freeport.  Anyone play <br/>\nin GFaydark wanna team with me?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, May 27, 1999 11:09 PM, Gary Qui Hong Loong <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Gary Qui Hong Loong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I hope to reach either lvl 8 or maybe lvl 9 tonite. heheh<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wilson wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Wilson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ritzbits@...\">ritzbits@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d be doing 2 homepages in the June holidays.
