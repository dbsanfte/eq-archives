Coins are good, up<br/>\n&gt; to 3pp, but I dun get any magical artifacts or fine steel weaps.  Worse is<br/>\n&gt; the faction msg I got, feel kinda uneasy.  So in the end hunt for 1 hr with<br/>\n&gt; Flyingfox and ciao liao.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For those who dun bother abt faction (mainly with the druids), the trees<br/>\n&gt; are lvl 24 to 28 I think.  They cast swarming which is a DoT spell, as well<br/>\n&gt; as AE spells (have to run away from those burning areas will do).  Most<br/>\n&gt; impt is to have 2 faster nukers - we try with a lvl 26 wiz, a lvl 24 magi<br/>\n&gt; and a lvl 24 earth pet, quite easy as the mobs have low HP.  2 casts from<br/>\n&gt; each of us, at most, will slain 1 tree, while the pet tank.  The trees<br/>\n&gt; spawn in pair, at specific location.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Personally speaking I think they hit very hard, the earth pet always leaves<br/>\n&gt; less than 40% HP after every battle and the trees spawn faster than we can<br/>\n&gt; recover (mainly have to wait for pet to regain HP).  Other than coins, they<br/>\n&gt; also give wood shards (anyone know wat it&#39;s for?) and light stone (can sell<br/>\n&gt; at 1pp to PC and 9gp to NPC).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you are interested to hunt for some quick XP, here is the loc:<br/>\n&gt; When you zone from NK to SK, turn left and run all the way.  The camp is<br/>\n&gt; somewhere 2-3 screen from the leftmost corner.  It&#39;s often filled with DE<br/>\n&gt; casters as they dun really bother about the faction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good luck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus (7th circle nuker)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p/s: Anyone can suggest a good hunting ground for a lvl 26 wiz and lvl 24<br/>\n&gt; magi combo (with a lvl 24 pet if necessary)?  Places with random<br/>\n&gt; spawns/trains are not suitable for us (eg dungeons), our death experiences<br/>\n&gt; have tested it ;)  Preferably some camps with fixed mobs, good xp and good<br/>\n&gt; loot, hehe, say between lvl 24 to lvl 28 mobs (we can get more pple if the<br/>\n&gt; mobs are of higher lvls).
