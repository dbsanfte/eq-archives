Knowing that Bind wound will be effective","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1184522130\">Have always be wondering about the following.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I have 12 skills points on Bind wound. My current lvl caps is 105.<br/>\nKnowing that Bind wound will be effective if HP is 50% below. Let say I did<br/>\na Bind wound above 50% hp , a msg pops up and  tells me its not working and<br/>\ni usedup a Bandage. The question is DID i contribute some factor to increase<br/>\nthe Bind wound skill or its just wasted.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I have a new Skill. eg: Eagle Strike. I go to Monk Guild to put 1<br/>\npractice point in it. Configure a hot key . Go to a zone and hunt Nasties,<br/>\nEg: orcs, Gnolls, Wiz, bears, etc,,(oops, not the wiz.. soorri, maybe<br/>\nPaladin...hmm..maybe not. hehehe)<br/>\nNOW, I con a nasties Orc for BLUE. I use eagle strike..It misses..Hit<br/>\nagain..1 hit.. hit again missies. THE question. DID the missed hits<br/>\ncontribute to any factor of Increase to the Eagle Strike skill overtime????<br/>\n<br/>\n3)Eagle Strike skill again. This time I con a Orc for Green. I use new Eagle<br/>\nstrike to hit it. It hits for 8 Damage...hit again 5 Damages. I keep killing<br/>\nGreenies but skill doest seem to go up. Or does it??????. I know that KiIlin<br/>\nBlue nasties up the skills ,what about greenies?<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Was at the oasis yesterday. A Sand Giant was chasing a guy. I was at the<br/>\n1st pillar. The Guy ran toward me. THe SG follows behind. SG went INTO the<br/>\nWATER!!!!. Hit the guy bad. he died. SG look at me !. I smile. Wave. Says<br/>\nHello! Bow, offer him Freddy as a Sacrifice and  it still  hits me for 48<br/>\ndamages. I did  a Feign Death. It stop hitting me. It hovers around my fake<br/>\ncorpse for a while b4 going away..whew..<br/>\nNOW.. I looked around no SG . very the safe liao. Got up and went over to<br/>\nnear 2nd Pillar. Use a Shrikens to lure a DWC. I fight Crocs till its Almost<br/>\ndie. From the horizon I see a BIG Black Shadow coming towards me. i Con it.<br/>\nIts a SG!.its far..np. looked at it again. It getting closer. I didnt see it<br/>\nwas chasing anyone. It came straight at ME!. I ran.It hits me. I feign<br/>\ndeath. it goes away. i got up. After a while the SG appear from a Sand Dune.<br/>\nI didnt see it  this time. It hits me bad. I feign death. Failed.. I died!<br/>\n&^%$%$#%@.<br/>\nQUESTION: SG Gunning me down! WHY???? it has a &quot;link&quot; on me since i Feign<br/>\ndeath??? lotsa ppl saw it and says my FAction was low with SG. Ya sure. I<br/>\nkilled hundreds of SG alreadi. :P .Some says i Killed it Baby SG...hmm......<br/>\nMaybe, becos of the Parang Sereph lompang to me, parang got some smelly<br/>\nblood from last ritual Sereph did on Einan. I tellin u , Sereph is NOT<br/>\nwell.Trifrost, Garren , Leshrec  and Zitus should have a good talk with<br/>\nher/him/it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk long questions. Give me good short answers please.<br/>\n<br/>\nA puzzle Yiyang</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
