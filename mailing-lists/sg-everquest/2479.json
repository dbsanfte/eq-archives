RIP HIM OFF!!!  ASK HIM PAY YOU 1,000PP AS COMPENSATION, <br/>\nAND PAY ALL IN MAILING LIST 10,000PP EACH  ;P<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway all caster kakis who hit lvl 35 hell lvl better camp for jboot now. <br/>\n It seem like only those higher than lvl 35 will get the quest note.  Those <br/>\nat 35 (myself) will still get the boot.  Start camping around 6-7pm is a <br/>\ngood time, and give yaself up to next day noon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason we MUST get jboot is to lvl beyond hell lvl.  FYI I died 3 times <br/>\nin a row with half bubb xp and still didnt drop lvl, as compared to drop <br/>\nmore than half bubb at lvl 34.  From this we can see that hell lvl is NOT a <br/>\nrumor.  Gaining xp at hell lvl is really a pain in the ass, REAL pain! <br/>\n Solo kiting will become our best choice, which required u to have jboot.<br/>\n<br/>\nWiz w/o jboot can also kite using bond of force (I did it once last night, <br/>\nforget to turn on my turbo speed, hehe), but if mob resist ya bond spell, <br/>\nyou can be 95% dead meat, unless u can zone out safely.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually we can go for red mob (eg spectre) as a 2-3 men grp, but it still <br/>\nrequired all to have jboots.  I know it&#39;s boring but trust me, it really <br/>\nworth it.  Solo kiting a mob 3-4 lvl below u is MUCH safer and better xp <br/>\nthan hunting a white/black mob with a team of 2-3.  Grp kiting a red mob <br/>\nwill take some time to get hold of the coordination, but<br/>\nI believe it pays.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo pain no gain, no gain no glory.<br/>\nZiltus.<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: I&#39;m forever banished from Qeynos region liao.  Now kill treants or <br/>\nqeynos npc also no faction msg.  My faction already hit the &#39;beyond repair&quot; <br/>\nstage, hehe.
