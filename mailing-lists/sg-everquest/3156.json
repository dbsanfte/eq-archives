What is the best combo of this team, average lvl?<br/>\n&gt; 2. Is the eye pulling method a bannable offence (ie use eye spell to pull<br/>\n&gt; PA to zone in).<br/>\n&gt; 3. Alternatively is to invis all the way to ledge, how siong is it to kill<br/>\n&gt; the 4 SS, guardians and PA?<br/>\n&gt; 4. Anything to watch out when fighting PA and its kakis?<br/>\n&gt; 5. I thinking of parking a druid at KK zone in, with max 125 tracking<br/>\n&gt; skill, I wonder if he can track PA from zone in or have to swim deeper to<br/>\n&gt; track?  Is it true that all mobs in KK cannot see invis except guardians<br/>\n&gt; and PA?  Is there any safe room near PA where I can invis a druid and park<br/>\n&gt; there to check if PA is up?  If k, then it&#39;s better to track 1st then call<br/>\n&gt; grp than the other way round.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thx.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Zil.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
