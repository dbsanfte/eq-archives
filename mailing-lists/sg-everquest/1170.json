Which part of oasis u hunt?  Is it the one near zone<br/>\n&gt;along the coast?  That side can be quite crowded at times.  Any good lobang<br/>\n&gt;to introduce?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As for the deepwater, they resis my spells often when I lvl 16 (esp dw<br/>\n&gt;croc).  I wonder if things work better at lvl 19.<br/>\n&gt;Btw, I got a VERY unluck day yesterday. Play from 2pm to night 1am, died 3<br/>\n&gt;times, kena accused for stealing (when it&#39;s another guildmate who steal, a<br/>\n&gt;separate msg on this matter), lost more than 1.5 bubb.  Cant find good<br/>\n&gt;kakis to team up, run from HH to oasis (1. killed by a SG trained by some<br/>\n&gt;gu niang, was looting didnt see SG 2. killed by a yellow orc warrior when<br/>\n&gt;it left less than 3% HP, sigh), then back to HH (killed when I was justed<br/>\n&gt;ONE stop away from zone).  Killed the named ocr at HH but no loot on it!<br/>\n&gt; Wah piang, really kena sai man.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ziltus De&#39;Damn&#39;To-Lan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Saturday, 10 July, 1999 12:39 PM, Leshrec [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Just a note to all caster types out there. If you really want to gain xp<br/>\n&gt;fast at level 18+, you should try out Oasis and do it SOLO. At level 21, I<br/>\n&gt;managed to get about a bubble of xp per hour. Although the loot here is<br/>\n&gt;poor, there is not much steal killing going on around here (Perfect for<br/>\n&gt;those wizards who like to use their body as tanks *hint* *hint*) and if<br/>\n&gt;really in trouble, usually can make to zone before you die. The caimans and<br/>\n&gt;crocs also not very resistant to root spells and they are not very buff<br/>\n&gt;either (4-5 flame shocks to take out a Deepsea caiman) Remember, the key<br/>\n&gt;word is solo, if you wanna group, maybe max is 2, but best if solo.
