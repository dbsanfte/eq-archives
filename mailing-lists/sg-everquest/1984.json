All go download the new ver. It<br/>\nbasically act as a RL msg board, and is intergrated intpo your contact list.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. You mail Red Dawn loh. My e-mail too cluttered liao<br/>\n<br/>\n3. General organisation, you and I do, BUT we only plan activities for across<br/>\nthe guild. Those who wishes to volunteer for the lvl event thingy, doi so now,<br/>\nor I&#39;ll saboh you.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Your story starting to get old...... *yawns*<br/>\n<br/>\nLKW wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. Mailing list is good.  Maybe we can consider if msg board can do the job<br/>\n&gt; better?  Esp a password protected one to prevent other retarded goons<br/>\n&gt; anyhow jump in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. FF got web space, but it&#39;s his personal&#39;s.  I wonder what if we get<br/>\n&gt; those free space from some webspace provider?  Singularity boss Red Dawn<br/>\n&gt; also mentioned a EQ space reserved for us.  I guess we just need to get<br/>\n&gt; from him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3. Appoint one Events Officer for each 10-lvl categories.  At least one lvl<br/>\n&gt; guild hunt per fortnight?  Eg Lvl 30-40 Event Officer to organise at least<br/>\n&gt; 1 lvl 30-40 guild hunt once every 2 weeks.  He can also &#39;arrow&#39; another lvl<br/>\n&gt; 30-40 kakis to do the organisation once a month (ie 2 events per month,<br/>\n&gt; officer must organise one of the 2 events, the other he can assign other<br/>\n&gt; lvl 30-40 kakis to organise).  Best is each one in the lvl category has a<br/>\n&gt; chance to organise.  Everyone must contribute mah, right? ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4. Kakis Heritage System<br/>\n&gt; If any kakis found an artifact which he dun bother to sell or none of his<br/>\n&gt; chars can use it, he can pass to another kakis who can use it.  Say Garren<br/>\n&gt; found a Thug robe which he or his other chars can&#39;t use, and he dun bother<br/>\n&gt; to sell.  In the end he gave to Ziltus.  Later when Ziltus got a Goss robe,<br/>\n&gt; he is NOT supposed to sell the Thug robe for his own benefit.  Instead, he<br/>\n&gt; pass it to FF.  Now FF got a FBR, he will then pass the Thug robe to the<br/>\n&gt; next kakis who can use it.  This way we can practice kakis heritage system<br/>\n&gt; which will benefit more kakis.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Contribution welcome.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best place to EXPLORE topics, SHARE ideas, and<br/>\n&gt; CONNECT to people with the same interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
