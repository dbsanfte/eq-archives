Even though its made in such a<br/>\nway that a low level player when grouped with a tougher one will earn<br/>\nextremely little exp, but there is also another way out ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW,What type of drinks and food do u guyz usually buy?Cant seem to find the<br/>\ntype where u get when u die during ya first 4 levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Those types can be bought at certain stores. Those cakes can be found at<br/>\nthe bakers in Qeynos. However, I only eat Muffins and Milk. &lt;&lt;Cheapest and<br/>\nlast just as long as Iron Rations that go for about 1 gold.&gt;&gt; However at<br/>\nhunting, don&#39;t stintch &lt;spello&gt; just buy those Water Flasks and Bread<br/>\nLoaves. Helps to clear the money weight too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWilson aka Yutaka </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
