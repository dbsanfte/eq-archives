Anyway I think u shld have no prob, since u sleep in office, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; no  i am not complaining that u (LKW) didnt give me stuff... i only to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mention that theres no guild unity in QHD at all... since someone having<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like 5 RTS dont even bother to give it to others and keep insiting on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; money... as for lake rathetear... i guess when i have reached the level<br/>\n&gt; (20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if i am not wrong, pls correct)... u can show me the area and i can get<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself... no worries on that one...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dun worry I understand, just pull ya leg.<br/>\n&gt; Just that u also have to understand tat unlike our UO guild, where all<br/>\n&gt; members meet and hunt togather, our current guild dun have so much contact<br/>\n&gt; and not tat close (except amg local kakis).  So sometime it&#39;s not easy for<br/>\n&gt; them to part with such stuffs to members which they may not even hunt with<br/>\n&gt; b4.  Even for myself, if non-local member ask me for free RTS, I will ask<br/>\n&gt; him to fly kite (hehe but I won&#39;t go ard annouce I got 5 RTS in guardsay<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; the first place).  I will only secret tell those local kakis whom I know<br/>\n&gt; can use them and most probably want them - just like those who get msg<br/>\nfrom<br/>\n&gt; me for free RTS and free skulls.  Basically the main problem I think is<br/>\ntat<br/>\n&gt; we are not close to other members in the group except for our own local<br/>\n&gt; kakis and friends (like flyingfox hunt with me almost every night), the<br/>\n&gt; rest I dun even meet them b4 ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i am now 1 bubbble away from level 18 and hope to get to level 20 or 21<br/>\n&gt; over<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the weekend... from then i will start to hunt aviaks... which i strongly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; believe i can solo em until level 24-25... thast wat i heard... then the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; treant hunting starts...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only problem with soloing is tat u may have to fight for kill with<br/>\n&gt; others.  If a wiz of not less than a circle lvl is there, u are as good as<br/>\n&gt; hopeless if he dun choose to share.  On the other hand, u have an upper<br/>\n&gt; hand over tankers, hehe.  I start soloing at lvl 21 or 22, cant remember,<br/>\n&gt; using the root & nuke tactics.  I also know some stealer magi who solo at<br/>\n&gt; 20 with their pets (read the word STEAL, that mean they make use of others<br/>\n&gt; to get XP).  I guess there are few kakis close lvl to yours and u guys<br/>\nshld<br/>\n&gt; try to form a group for hunting instead of soloing.  There is a 3 bird<br/>\n&gt; tower there, where 3 bird spawn at same time.  If u lose kill in soloing,<br/>\n&gt; just for a group of 3 to hunt there, the reture is the same - 3 bird for 3<br/>\n&gt; chars VS 1 bird for 1 char ;)  If a wiz can solo 3 birds in lake, the<br/>\nplace<br/>\n&gt; will give him no xp ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hmmm... let see wat else did i miss... oh yea... words... if anyone of u<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guys come across necro words... pls kindly keep em for me... as my<br/>\n&gt; research<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have just began.... and pls refer to the follow passge for research<br/>\n&gt; &gt; information...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure if everyone know it, u dun have to BUY all the spells:<br/>\n&gt; - Ultility spells, buy only those tat u MIGHT use (eg buying light spell<br/>\n&gt; for DE with ultravision is a waste).<br/>\n&gt; - Dam spells, buy only those that u will place in ya spell icons (eg I dun<br/>\n&gt; buy AE spells and even when I buy for my 1st 2 circle, I never use them -<br/>\n&gt; no chance to memo them, which is a waster of money, only make me die<br/>\n&gt; faster).<br/>\n&gt; - Check the site for those spells not available in your guild, are they<br/>\n&gt; been casted by other classes?  If yes, u can buy instead of research.  So<br/>\n&gt; far I buy those useful spells that need wiz to research from other<br/>\nclasses&#39;<br/>\n&gt; guilds - enstill from cleric guild, leviate from druid guild etc.  When<br/>\n&gt; there is a faster, cheaper and easier way to get a spell, why not? ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, I dun undertstand what u mean by the research rquest.  Do u mean<br/>\n&gt; finding the correct ingredient to make new spells?  If that&#39;s the case,<br/>\ndun<br/>\n&gt; bother, there are some site that give all the research info.  No need to<br/>\n&gt; learn languages.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Research for Good Alignment<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This quest will make it easier for the good aligned researchers gain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; experience in Research rather than wasting precious runes that would be<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; value to create real spells. The quest begins (and ends, really) with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mrysila of the Gypsy camp in North Karanas (Loc -672, -162). Hail her,<br/>\n&gt; she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will talk to you about the [Concordance of Research] and it&#39;s sister<br/>\n&gt; books<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Runes and Research Volumes one and two. Then tell her you are<br/>\n&gt; [Interested]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in researching spells. If you bring her a lightstone, she will give you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whichever book she has more of at the moment. If you bring her a Greater<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lightstone, she will give you the Concordance of Research, which is the<br/>\n&gt; book<br/>\n&gt; &gt; used to combine the items much like the Lexicon. To view the recipe<br/>\n&gt; books,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; click on the appropriate book links here.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Research for Evil Alignment<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Within the Desert of South Ro (loc +100, +500. Straight South from the<br/>\n&gt; Oasis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of Marr zoneline), there is a camp with a female Teir&#39;Dal, named Smith<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tv&#39;ysa, selling research assistance items. In exchange for a Greater<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lightstone, you get a Concordance of Research Tome, which has spaces to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; combine items much like the Lexicon. If you give her a few lightstones,<br/>\n&gt; she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will give you the Runes and Research Tomes Volumes one and two.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the reference web site is...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.graffe.com/\">http://www.graffe.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hope this helps...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nicademous<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dark Elf Necromancer that is currently pissed with QHD bcos they are<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; &gt; too many &#39;kids&#39; in there...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 04, 1999 10:22 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [sg-everquest] Skull of Jhen & Dragoon Dirk.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. You dun have to kill dvinn, u just have to wait for me to kill for<br/>\n&gt; u,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; probably u can wait at CB entrance and I will call u in to loot once I<br/>\n&gt; got<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one.  Find a time during weekend, I can teleport there pretty fast ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. I&#39;ve given u RTS right? Hehe, we all practice &#39;family pass down&#39;,<br/>\nno<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worry, once we upgrade our stuffs, sure pass down.  Btw, if u can come<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lake Rathetear, I can help u get a skull FOC. Again this is lore item,<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can&#39;t loot anymore since I already got 1 on me.  I throw away quite<br/>\n&gt; alot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; skulls and RTSs so far at gnoll camp, kinda wasted (can tell how happy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; those lvl 12 to 20 who wander there for free stuffs, heh).  Too bad I<br/>\n&gt; dun<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; go Lake anymore coz the aviak guards no longer give me xp.  But when I<br/>\n&gt; go,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will annouce in guildsay.  Meanwhile just go and find out how to go<br/>\n&gt; Lake<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1st, in case I give u a call, hehe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3.  For all kakis between lvl 18 to 20, you can form a group of 3-6<br/>\n&gt; pple<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and hunt whole day in Lake Rathetear until lvl 26, or solo when u<br/>\nreach<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lvl<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 22 or so.  It&#39;s a pretty safe place to hunt as the are 1 bird, 2 birds<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3 birds camps.  Depending how many pple in ya group, u jus go to the<br/>\n&gt; right<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; place.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. I tried to hunt webclaw yesterday but he disappear once I root him<br/>\n&gt; (the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; targeting just disappear after I see the rooted msg).  Anyone know<br/>\n&gt; where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spawn so that I can root and nuke him once he is out? How to lure him<br/>\n&gt; up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; land if that is possible, since I get disturbed often in water with<br/>\n&gt; skill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 135 ;(.
