So coincident, we always select the same race and class, <br/>\ngreat minds think alike?  LOL.  I guess I better change char liao this time <br/>\n(thou I always fancy the Life Tap spells of necro), so that we can pair up <br/>\nto hunt.  How abt a TSK?  More evil than u leh.  Hehe, since u wanna play <br/>\nevil, play dark-evil necro lor, ;)  We can meet and tag team (tank and <br/>\ncaster) to destroy all light in Prexus server!<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the XP thing, not sure if new EQ server gain xp faster, but it&#39;s <br/>\nvery true for UO new server.  In mature server it takes months to make a GM <br/>\nsmith but in new server it only take a week or two. I guess it&#39;s not a bad <br/>\ntime for us to try it out, esp our chars are all pretty young in Innoruuk. <br/>\n No harm trying too, say spend few days to a week there.  Maybe we all gain <br/>\nmuch higher lvl in new server as compare to few weeks play in Innoruuk ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think DE Necro and TSK will make a great EVIL team.  One more shaman <br/>\n(healer/buffer)  will be nice for a evil party, whahahahahahah!<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw Les, Gandalf is more for good char.  Not so suitable for evil char leh. \r<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tuesday, June 08, 1999 3:40 PM, Leshrec [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As you guys might have known, the new server Prexus is up already.

Therefore i have decided <br/>\nto make a Gnomish Necromancer in the Prexus server and see how it goes. <br/>\nBeing a new server, less people would probably be there, and thus the <br/>\ninitial xp gain should be speedy enough. Anyone who is willing to switch <br/>\nservers for a while to try out the class they always wanted, but not able <br/>\nto bear to leave their main characters can always join me. )<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My nick there would probably be Gandalf but if server does not allow it, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>then Khadgar or Leshrac.
