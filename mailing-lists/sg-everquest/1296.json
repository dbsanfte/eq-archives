Initially <br/>\nI didnt specifically train them until I heard from some players tat the <br/>\nbenefits (faster casting time and less failure) only start come in when ya <br/>\nskill reach 50.  So I spend one afternoon casting the lowest lvl evoke <br/>\nspell on myself, med, cast, med, cast....until I reach 50 (very boring). <br/>\n Then I leave it alone.  Some players said once a particular skill reach <br/>\n50, it means it will be your primary specialization, dunno how true it is <br/>\ncoz the other 4 spec con&#39;t to rise even my evoke is already above 50.  The <br/>\nlvl ceiling still apply I guess. so probably I will spend another night <br/>\ntrying to max evoke spec out.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Monday, 19 July, 1999 10:00 PM, Synzzz [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hannibal@...\">hannibal@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would like to thank all of you who have provided info/tips and much <br/>\n </span></blockquote>guidance on the game.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thanks especially to Ziltus,Flyingfox for bringing me to FP and also to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sereph (and uh that Ae*** person..hehe..)for having<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; brought me to Oasis.
