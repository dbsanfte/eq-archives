He sticks with me despite my level. But<br/>\nhe is going to play a druid now so that he won&#39;t be too high above me. Great<br/>\npal he is. Love him. and he laughs easy, even if he doesn&#39;t understand your<br/>\njoke. Hehehe!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the only monks here are me and Yiyang. Why I love monks? 10 reasons I<br/>\nguess.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)I don&#39;t have to worry about those cool looking weapons, armours etc. While<br/>\nyou people are reaching for those GhoulBane, Bloodforge, Rubicite etc. I<br/>\njust need to /ooc &quot;Paying 12pp for Mesh Glove.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n2)After I die, I don&#39;t feel helpless without my arsenal. I fight almost just<br/>\nas well.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)When you semi-mage guys are thinking &quot;To root or to nuke or ...&quot; I just<br/>\nstand there and kick ass and toggle the view points to see if my partner is<br/>\nin dire need for help.<br/>\n<br/>\n4)At higher levels, we &quot;decide&quot; with MOB dies first.<br/>\n<br/>\n5)Feign Death can be used to lure MOB without its partners coming along. At<br/>\nmost, you get a mini train.<br/>\n<br/>\n6)Our STA &quot;never&quot; drops even with continuous fights. While others holding<br/>\nheavy weapons have to watch their yellow bar.<br/>\n<br/>\n7)We need mostly DEX and AGI booasters. Some come at high price like those<br/>\nPlat Enchanted jewelries but hey, how many jewel slots have we? 5 I believe.<br/>\n&lt;I know this point it closely related to PT 1 but I need to fill the space<br/>\n;-)&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n8)We smack 5 hits into you before you even lift your weapon.<br/>\nPunch,Punch,Punch,Punch,Flying Kick. Oh boy, that hurts. Flying Kick goes<br/>\nfor 70hps minimum from what I hear.<br/>\n<br/>\n9)Chicks dig the flying kicks.<br/>\n<br/>\n10)I&#39;ll let Yiyang fill this. And if he doesn&#39;t ... we don&#39;t pick up &quot;loot&quot;<br/>\nonly cash. So we don&#39;t have to make runs to the stores.<br/>\n<br/>\nWilson. Do call me Wilson. But in-game name&#39;s Yutaka. Take care!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i suppose its not easy to raise a char to high level... as i can imagine<br/>\n&gt; levelling is exponential... :( in terms of difficulty... anyway... i will<br/>\n&gt; concentrate on one char... fer now at least....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nic<br/>\n&gt; p/s: how much u all like monk so much ? any special reasons? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
