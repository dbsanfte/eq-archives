I set hotkey 4, 5, 6 <br/>\nto sense direction and link it to my keypad for movement (ie front, left, <br/>\nright).  Like that everytime I move, I use the skill.  Now the skill reach <br/>\nmy lvl ceiling.  When I rise lvl, it&#39;s easier and faster for me to increase <br/>\nit further till the new lvl ceiling.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those spell casters, the magery skill ceiling is 5+5/lvl.  If u are lvl <br/>\n7, ya ceiling for all magery skills is 5+(7x5)=40.  Once u rise a lvl, stay <br/>\nin town and keep casting & mediating until you reach lvl ceiling b4 u <br/>\nventure out.  (Unlike UO casting in EQ doesnt require reagents, so keep <br/>\ncasting and mediating) This will help u, coz at higher lvl, magery skills <br/>\nrise faster.  It&#39;s very time consuming to max all magery kills to lvl <br/>\nceiling everytime u gain a lvl, but at least do it for mediation, <br/>\nchanelling and ya main magery skills.  For eg, I&#39;m a wiz, so I always max <br/>\nout my evoke (offense) and adjure (defence) skills, not forgetting <br/>\nmediation and chanelling.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, dun forget abt ya melee skills.  Thou ya melee sux, but u will sux <br/>\nfurther if u dun train at all.  Ask the tankers in ya group to start the <br/>\nattack, when monsters fight them, u move close and hit with ya melee weap <br/>\nand at the same time keep casting ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;You will only be able to have two name lines once you hit level 20. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you can call a GM and ask him to add, so you might want to use Chen <br/>\n </span></blockquote>first.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Once you hit LvL 20 then ask him to add YuYun in ;-) Hahaha!<br/>\n&gt; BallBall...aiyo.
