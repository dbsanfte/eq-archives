Can someone comfirm? Or must sit and <br/>\nwait to see which is less crowded? I don&#39;t think it matters, since we will <br/>\nbe playing during off-peak hours anyway. Maybe except for weekends, but I <br/>\nestimate should have the same number of players playing as before, maybe an <br/>\nextra of 100(off-peak) to 1000(peak)(Duh).
