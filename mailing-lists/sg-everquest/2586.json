Saw many rangers getting most of the Ivy Etched in 2 days with<br/>\nsome teleporting aid.<br/>\n<br/>\nShaman quest is relatively easy. Mostly involve buying some items + a<br/>\npiece of banded armor + a rare item from a common mob. Problem is that<br/>\nTrolls and Ogres are KOS by the NPC who gives the quest which IMO is the<br/>\nright thing to do. Trolls and Ogres are just too dumb to use advance<br/>\narmor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSK as usual are the most screwed up. The skeleton that gives the quest<br/>\nspawns semi rarely and is usually killed........<br/>\n<br/>\nPaly quest is a major pain since they involve faction AND have to kill<br/>\nmobs to get the items to trade for the mold AND have to figure out what<br/>\nthe heck to do with the mold (Hint: There&#39;s a shorty you should visit<br/>\nsome where)<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric one is about as screwed up as Paly. Half of the items needed are<br/>\nitems that pop up in a place and if the item is taken away, it takes 6<br/>\nhrs for it to respawn. On top of that, only 2 armor parts are easily<br/>\nobtainable and the stats is disappointing......<br/>\n<br/>\nWarrior still have their crafted and with the new stat bonus, I wonder<br/>\nwhy the heck is cleric&#39;s one so hard to quest for compare to<br/>\ncrafted......<br/>\n<br/>\nRouge armor as most of you know now spawn in CT as a replacement for<br/>\nRubicite. Interesting thing is that the chestguard has an<br/>\n&quot;Effect:         &quot; line there. Maybe it has the rubicite aura effect<br/>\nlike the old armor. Anyone care to clarify?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the casters quest are quite easy to get, except those that<br/>\ninvolves Shadow man since shadow man items are no rent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe jboots quest is interesting. A quest leading to 2 other. I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave the full spoiler but at it&#39;s current stage, only high level players<br/>\nwill have the patient to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s about all on my opinion which as usual is bias.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
