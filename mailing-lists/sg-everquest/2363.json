","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-26542528\">Hail! And welcome to the 2nd edition of<br/>\n<br/>\n---===Exploit of The Week===---<br/>\n<br/>\nThis weeks exploit is brought to you by: Angry Shamans Across Norrath<br/>\n(ASAN). Quit fucking nerfing our characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week Angry Shamans brought you a way to trade no-drop items. We<br/>\nhope some people were able to benefit from this. This week Shamans had<br/>\ntheir Pets Nerfed. Our dogs were already ten levels below us (at<br/>\nbest), and were never in any way better than a warrior or monk of equal<br/>\nlevel. Verant didn&#39;t bother to mention our pets in any update, just<br/>\nMagician&#39;s and Necro&#39;s pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis week&#39;s exploit is mostly for people on PvP servers, but can also<br/>\nbe handy for you carebears in a duel.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently Verant made a patch which made it impossible for someone to<br/>\nloot from Melee or Range slots when they are killed by a PC. I have<br/>\ndiscovered a way around this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlright, before you go on your killing spree tonight, fill up all your<br/>\ngeneral inventory slots, including backpacks. Something cheap will do<br/>\njust fine (bait, milk, muffins) just make sure all inventory slots are<br/>\nfull. Now find a poor helpless warrior with a big, shiny weapon or<br/>\nshield. Kill him. When looting his corpse RIGHT CLICK on his weapon.<br/>\nYou should get a message saying &quot;You have no more room and item falls<br/>\nto the ground&quot;. Look down and his weapon will be sitting there, ready<br/>\nfor you to pick up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeheh! And you melee classes thought pets were unfair ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
