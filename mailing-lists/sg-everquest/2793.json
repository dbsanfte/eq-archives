Some S&#39;pore <br/>\nplayers play in Hotuko (something like tat, a Japanese server but give <br/>\npretty good connection for most local players).  Few days back my kakis <br/>\nfound a house which is going to decay, so he stay there to place a house. <br/>\n Later some S&#39;pore players and Jap players come.  Those S&#39;pore players who <br/>\ncome, know my friend is also a local player, kill him so they can place a <br/>\nhouse at the spot, and the Jap players laugh at them fighting amg their own <br/>\ncountry man, sigh.<br/>\nThis news really upset me.  I dun understand why our own countrymen have to <br/>\nfight amg ourselves and become others&#39; laughting stocks.<br/>\nIf anyone of you also play in UO, pls dun fight ya own countrymen unless <br/>\nboth are role-playing good and evil parties.  If other country players (eg <br/>\nJap, they are very unite) can unite even in a game, I dun see why we S&#39;p  <br/>\norean, can&#39;t do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus (aka Dark Flame in Baja server)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sunday, 02 January, 2000 11:05 PM, Gabriel Kang <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chaotic@...\">chaotic@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Gabriel Kang &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chaotic@...\">chaotic@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (Press Release -  Singapore)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We ushered in the new year with parties and great<br/>\n&gt; celebrations , many of us were on holiday and may<br/>\n&gt; have even leveled up .
