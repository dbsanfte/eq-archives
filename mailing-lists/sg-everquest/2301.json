This will not only earn you exp but also cash.<br/>\nDoing trade might earn you more but at the expense of exp unless you&#39;re not<br/>\nkeen to level :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLike yesterday I was alone for about 5 hrs at the bandit camp(not the sister<br/>\ncamp, the other)  in LFay . I made 50pp selling the loot from the bandits I<br/>\nkilled and got 2 1/2 bubbs exp at same time. Which I think is not too bad<br/>\nfor a lvl15 char, I guess the trick is finding the right place to hunt<br/>\nwithout the crowd.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBardman Melodeuss of 15th</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
