Hmm, I think it&#39;s the other way round leh.  Bolt cast faster than shock, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s non-guided missle and normally slightly higher dam, LOS is also a <br/>\nfactor when targeting.  Let me check my bolt and shock casting time <br/>\ntonight.<br/>\n2. Alamak, every class also complain, hehe, grass-elsewhere-greener <br/>\nsyndrome I guess.  At least u magi nuke next to wiz, PLUS u got a pet to <br/>\ntank for u..<br/>\n3. I&#39;m talking abt the range lvl 34-38.  Magi dd inflict higher dam than <br/>\nWiz lah, no arguement on that.  FF&#39;s lvl 34 dd is more than 310, while my <br/>\nlvl 34 dd is only 30X.  But even magi with a higher dd, I can easily draw <br/>\nmob to me but not the other way round.  My death at lvl 35 with FF (lvl 34 <br/>\nmagi) and Zan (lvl 35 magi) prove it ;)<br/>\n4. Magi is more of a supporting/nuking role in a grp, where wiz is pure <br/>\nnuker.  There is no arguement magi is the 2nd best nuker after wiz.  And <br/>\nwith ya lvl 49 dd spell of 900dam, you guys are not 1/2 wiz coz our highest <br/>\ndd spell is only 1200 (ie ya&#39;s is 75% of ours, not 50%), plus the fact u <br/>\nguys can get tat spell easier and cast faster.<br/>\n5.
