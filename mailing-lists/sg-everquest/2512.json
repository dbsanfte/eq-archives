Have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------- cut here -----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following is posted by Angturil on Eq stratics board. I found<br/>\nit<br/>\nvery helpful so paste it here. Thanks Angturil for this wonderful<br/>\npost.<br/>\n<br/>\nBinbini<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following are the tactics I use, and have worked for me till<br/>\n50,<br/>\nand now 30 (I have 2 wizards). I have also played a paladin to a<br/>\ndecent (38) level, and can see the other side of the equation. <br/>\n1. Much as I like to melee, there is rarely a point above 20th<br/>\nlevel<br/>\nto do so. Below 20, a wizard with a good staff CAN contribute<br/>\ngreatly<br/>\nin combat, and should , once mana runs out. It will help keep their<br/>\ncombat skills up, and those skills are critical in keeping you<br/>\nalive<br/>\nlater. Above 20, melee only to finish off runners (in a controlled<br/>\nenvironment), and to build skill with FM and an easy foe.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. This is CRITICAL and completely missed by 90% (random high<br/>\nnumber)<br/>\nof the wizards out there. DO NOT run, or backup from a mob, nor<br/>\nface<br/>\naway from it. Your defence will plummet, and so will your life. If<br/>\nyou<br/>\nneed a mob off you, do the following...<br/>\n<br/>\nStop casting<br/>\nStop attacking<br/>\nask a tank to get it off you <br/>\n<br/>\nin open spaces, rooting the mob, and RUNNING forward through the<br/>\nmob<br/>\nwill work best. NEVER backup, or run around, you will die. <br/>\n<br/>\n( Actually I found you can backup a little slowly. This will make<br/>\nyour<br/>\ntank easy to pick the mob up. However, Never Never run --- Binbini)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. 2 bubbles of health, under attack, and you have to run? don&#39;t<br/>\nbother. cast gate, you have a 50% chance of making it, running, you<br/>\nhave 0. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n4. In open spaces, root is your friend. Use it as intened, to keep<br/>\nmobs OUT of combat. Once rooted, DO NOT nuke the mob, let it stand<br/>\nthere till you&#39;re done with the others.<br/>\n<br/>\n( Just remember, once the mob breaks the root, you are his primary<br/>\ntarget. But it can easily pulled off by a tank. --- Binbini)<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Use AOE&#39;s. they rock, and have low agro. Just make sure you have<br/>\nmore than one tank, and they keep things engaged. You can often do<br/>\n1.5x more damage than is usually possible at your level. AOE&#39;s<br/>\nbecome<br/>\nvery hard to use past 30 ( at least I have yet to figure out a way<br/>\nto... working on it), but are very effective below 30th level.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Tactics. If multiple mobs come, you and the tanks pick the<br/>\nweakest<br/>\nmob. You FULL burn the mob, tanking it as required. The key is<br/>\nkilling<br/>\n1-2 mobs fast, relieving the pressure from your tanks and clerics.<br/>\nThis is CRITICAL. Once done, you med, and finish runners as needed.<br/>\nWhile full burning the mob, DO NOT attack/assist in melee. It will<br/>\nkeep the mob from sticking to you. This works even with ice comet<br/>\nand<br/>\nother high damage spells. Multiple mobs are BAD for your group,<br/>\nthey<br/>\nhit people in the back for MUCH more damage than if they were<br/>\nengaged<br/>\nin 1 to 1 melee. It&#39;s your job to kill them fast and make the fight<br/>\nmanageable. Root is another means to do this, but requires much<br/>\nmore<br/>\nspace and skill.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Get an enchanter in your group, and keep it there  they control<br/>\nthe<br/>\nbattle, you burn the targets. you can win almost any fight with<br/>\nthem.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve killed 9-12 yellows with a 4 person group with an enchanter<br/>\nin<br/>\none fight. and this is in the 30s.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Use your shield skins religiously, they are one of your most<br/>\npowerful spells. with them, you can tank for ages.<br/>\n<br/>\n( Yep, always keep the shieldskin up. If a mob beats you to 4<br/>\nbubble<br/>\nless and a tank taunts it off, backup and cast shieldskin again,<br/>\nthen<br/>\nyou have better chance to survive the next melee. -- Binbini)<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t give up on your wizard. They are probably the 2nd most<br/>\npowerful<br/>\nclass in the game (clerics being first). The trouble is, most<br/>\npeople<br/>\njust don&#39;t know how to play one.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you ever see a wizard run around your group yelling &quot;get it off<br/>\nme&quot;, asking for heals, saying OOM after one mob, do yourself a<br/>\nfavor<br/>\nand find another member. <br/>\n<br/>\nA wizard should NEVER require heals in a fight or take a heal that<br/>\nshould go to a tank. Keep that in mind. You can tank, but you must<br/>\nNEVER do so at the expense of heals to your tank members who are<br/>\nmuch<br/>\nbetter than you at it. Use your shieldskins instead of heals. pace<br/>\nthem out. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s my advice for today, have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngturil, a lvl 50 wizard somewhere :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nTommy Fong</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
