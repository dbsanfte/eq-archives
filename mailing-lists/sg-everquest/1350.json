Nuking on site is too<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mana ineffective)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sigh, as I&#39;ve said many times, I regret putting 20 stats point on STR when<br/>\n&gt; I create Ziltus, for f**k?  Knn I&#39;m not creating a labour worker ;(<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, my buffed INT is 111.<br/>\n&gt; Kellendil, what are the best INT stuffs u can make now?  I need them<br/>\nbadly,<br/>\n&gt; esp earrings (wtf I&#39;m wearing AGI earring?  I&#39;m not a sand bag, hehe).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wis base casters don&#39;t need to report. See your face knows how much mana<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you have already.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hahahahahaahahaha!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Function of this guy? If a big train is started, this guy will be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; responsible of taunting the WHOLE train, and die, while the rest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gate/run out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Monk willl be the best candidate since they can feign death, plus they<br/>\n&gt; carry very few items.  So cannot retrieve coprse also nmind, hahahahah ;-P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For the 20+ group, I&#39;ll volunteer for this since I get a incredible 50%<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exp bonus while in a full group and my area effect DOT songs can taunt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like no tomorrow. For the other 2, decide who gets to die among<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yourself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Huh?  Not 25% extra xp bonus meh?  50%?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now on supplies. The 2 magician and 3(2 if Neriss go MIA) wis base<br/>\n&gt; &gt; casters will be required to provide enought supplies to last the whole<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gang. Nicademous, Kenven and Kellendil can help them out by going into<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Grobb and I and Sunblade can forage a bit to help out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually if possible, I would like to bring flyingfox (lvl 21 magi),<br/>\n&gt; deadflower (lvl 19 bard) and Ling (lvl 24 wiz) along. They are my hunting<br/>\n&gt; buddies for pretty long time and very trust-worthy.  Of coz, priority will<br/>\n&gt; be given to locals 1st, just in case we have slots to put them in ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Spell casters, please remember to get 100 each of your spell components.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 200+ for pet reagents to be KS.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 100???  How long we going to stay there?  I buy 40 of my spell reagents<br/>\n&gt; each time and can last for a week or so.  Wt and cost is one thing.  I&#39;m<br/>\nso<br/>\n&gt; damn poor after buying the 5 lvl 24 teleport scrolls and in the end have<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; borrow money from Ling to get the 5th scroll, where got cash to buy so<br/>\nmany<br/>\n&gt; cat eye agate? ;(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; No alpha loot will be in place. Instead, auto split will be turn on, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1 person of each group will be delicated to looting everything. Please<br/>\n&gt; &gt; report whatever you get to all 3 groups. We will decide by vote who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; requires the item the most and hand it to him/her first.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sugestion: I&#39;m not sure how this single looter works, but sometime pple<br/>\ndun<br/>\n&gt; bother to loot those rusty weaps and cheap stuffs.  It&#39;s also impractical<br/>\n&gt; for the single looter to loot everything on sight.  Maybe looters just<br/>\nloot<br/>\n&gt; those better stuffs and leave the cheapo stuffs like rusty for others to<br/>\n&gt; free loot (poor wise like me even loot animal skin or bat wing leh). FYI,<br/>\n&gt; even if auto split is turn on, auto split DO NOT split the coin evenly.<br/>\n&gt;  The person who loot the coins will be much more than other individuals in<br/>\n&gt; the group, not sure if this is a bug but 101% confirm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This event will be a 2 day, 3 night event. We will make our way to guk<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on Saturday night and fight from Saturday night to National day. When TV<br/>\n&gt; &gt; showing fire works, those present will atempt to choing the frogloc<br/>\n&gt; &gt; paladin if we gather enough force, and no one is camping the goon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hope I can join most of the time, Aug is a very heavy work load month<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; me.  Maybe have to work on National Day ;(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus, power training at Lake Rathetear for the coming Guk expedition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Start a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; See homepage for details on ONElist&#39;s new &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY&quot; program.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can WIN $100 to Amazon.com!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nIf you join ONElist&#39;s FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
