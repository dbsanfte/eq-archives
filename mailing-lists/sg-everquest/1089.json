DONT BUY THEM... persoally i think.. the most impt thing is ya char... build up the skills well... n u can be as good if u use rite strategies when in combat... BUT if someone decides to give u those stuff... then thats another story... hehehee :) *thanks again YY*...<br/>\n<br/>\ni believe with the sg community... we have a high chance of getting the items we need... esp when theres only 1 of your type... so if someone else have got someone u want... they will most likely give it (or loan it) to u.... am i rite guys? i think there r a couple of sites u can have a look at... they provide useful info...
