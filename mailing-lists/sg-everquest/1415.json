She does not have 2000-2500 hp, I think 3 to 4 Inferno Shocks can<br/>\nkill her. (240 damage each) Usually 2 or 3 magicians will come along with<br/>\nher and their pets too. Just get a full party of level 27+ to avoid those<br/>\nirritatting ogre guards without having to invs/camo and it will be safe to<br/>\ncamp Najena. Beware of Rathyl Incarnate though, he is rather strong and<br/>\nalmost wiped out my party of level 27s.<br/>\n    I dont think its Najena that HTs, more like Drelza (the necro with<br/>\nJboots) that HTs.<br/>\n    FBR is almost sure drop on Najena.<br/>\n<br/>\nMazy<br/>\nLevel 30 Wizard<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Chen Lizhi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polarcoordinates@...\">polarcoordinates@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 28, 1999 2:41 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [sg-everquest] Staff of Observe/FBR/ROO<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Chen Lizhi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polarcoordinates@...\">polarcoordinates@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you want to fight Najena, you better get 2-3 nukers along. She got some<br/>\n&gt; kakis guarding here, Necro or Mage and each of them have a pet.So makes a<br/>\n&gt; grand total of abt. 5-7 MOBs in total. Plus, last I heard, she can cast<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; melee also, plus she can HarmTouch ppl. Sometimes she can do up to 4-7 HT<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; a round alone, but rare lar. Average is abt. 2-3. Want to kill her better<br/>\n&gt; get some REAL serious firepower to kill her hor, HP wise is around<br/>\n&gt; 2000-2500(estimate). Expect to lose a few ppl. in fighting her, her HT<br/>\nkicks<br/>\n&gt; some serious butt.<br/>\n&gt; The Oracle in OOT is around 34-36. Don&#39;t think of soloing him, he got<br/>\n&gt; someone protecting him one, abt. 30-31 level guy. Small fries I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow,<br/>\n&gt; but I think a few level 20ish MOB around the oracle also.<br/>\n&gt; FBR is a rare drop on Najena(I think) So hunting J.Boots that time also<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; hunt for FBR.<br/>\n&gt; Staff of Observer? A rare spawn EvilEye in the King&#39;s room in RunnyEye has<br/>\n&gt; it on him occasionally. He can charm, summon pet and get all his Goblins<br/>\n&gt; kakis to help him kill you. Level around low 30s. Not sure, but don&#39;t<br/>\nthink<br/>\n&gt; of soloing him.<br/>\n&gt; This one is rumor, there is another way of getting StaffofObserver. Go to<br/>\n&gt; Paw underwater room. Kill the HighShaman there and wait for the Drow Nixx<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; spawn. If you see the Drow wearing a staff, if may be StaffofObserver.<br/>\nJust<br/>\n&gt; rumor only hor, try if you have the time. DrowNixx is around 20-24 in<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n&gt; and he got some bitching Rune 2 or 3 protecting him. I tried to kill it at<br/>\n&gt; 18 with 3 others. All end up Gating out :p<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Transfer your big list to ONElist and earn $500!<br/>\n&gt; For program details, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
