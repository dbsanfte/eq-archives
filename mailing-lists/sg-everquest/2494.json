In fact, in most places other than dungeon, I mean after lvl <br/>\n30, magi can solo better than wiz (remember u can solo in HH at lvl 30 but <br/>\nI cant?).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt high lvl, ya lava spell (900dd) can be purchased easily while we have to <br/>\nquest or research for our ice comet (1200dd).  Ya casting time is also much <br/>\nshorter I believe (bolt spell casting time is shorter than shocl spells). <br/>\n Most of magi buff are &#39;stored buff&#39;, where u can summon till u log.  I <br/>\nbasically think magi is pretty cool.  H/w, above lvl 34, we really need to <br/>\nfind good team and right place to adventure (same for other classes).<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, I dun think u need root spell coz ya EE can root for u.  Ever notice <br/>\nhow the mob get &#39;rooted&#39; by ya pet when u send pet in and nuke?  When I <br/>\nteam with u, I always wonder why is it so, esp when ya dd is now higher <br/>\nthan mine.  I think this is how Verant compensate magi for &#39;rooting&#39;. <br/>\n Unlike u, when we team, u send in pet and nuke, mob wont come to u, but it <br/>\ncome to me the moment I nuke.  I think Verant make it such tat mob will <br/>\ntreat ya pet as part of u.  So when u nuke harder, ya pet can still take <br/>\nthe punishment from u.  Most impt of all, when wiz oom, we are dead meat <br/>\n99% of the time unless we are just next to zone.   Magi, on the other hand, <br/>\ncan make use of pet to die for u while u flee to zone.  Of coz once ya pet <br/>\ndied, mob will still out run u, but at least u got longer fleeing time than <br/>\nwiz.<br/>\n<br/>\nNecro pet is also cool, but their spells are mainly dot.  There is no tank <br/>\n(nuking) mage in EQ, but I believe magi is the only tank AND mage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can still solo a bit coz of jboot.  U shld know I&#39;m also bad luck like <br/>\nu..but I guess we just have to keep trying. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tuesday, 28 September, 1999 11:04 PM, Tommy Fong <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tommyfong@...\">tommyfong@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Tommy Fong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tommyfong@...\">tommyfong@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Garren,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m ok.
