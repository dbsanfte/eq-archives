But there are short cuts I think. The one that I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>accdentially found is that when picking up stuff from ur body, by rite<br/>\nclicking on the item, it will pop into ur item slots instead of having to<br/>\nleft click on it and drag it to the item slots. But this of course wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nauto equipe ur armors/weapons. U still need to click and drop it into ur<br/>\nchar. Still exploring the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2)First person view is the main view but able to switch to ass-cam &lt;tomb<br/>\nraider&gt; for the more professional players&#39; choice. There are a total of 5<br/>\ndifferent views if I&#39;m right.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; As for the view, I usually use the first person view (al Quake). I don&#39;t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>play Quake though. I would get motion sickness in 5mins. Anyway, I do use<br/>\nthe other view type, the top down view. There are bonus to hit and damage<br/>\nif u attack from behind (at least that&#39;s what I heard from a player. And I<br/>\ndo find that I hit more often and damage higher sometimes).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n3)Hunting in groups are encouraged due to trains and tough mobs with<br/>\nsplendid loots.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; For EQ it&#39;s group or die. Within a group, u need some1 to heal and cure,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>some1 to provide firepower support and tanks to take hits from the<br/>\nmonsters. It&#39;s all about co-operating to survive and gain from the hunts. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n4)Minotour Axes are like the best non-magic weapon in the game. Price range<br/>\nfrom 5pp-10pp.<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; No idea on this one. I&#39;m a Monk. I&#39;m my weapon and armor itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>5)If you love interaction, then this is the game. Meridian 59 is also<br/>\nrecommended.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Aye, player interaction is really important in the game<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>6)One hour in real life is like 1 whole day in EverQuest &lt;morning til night&gt;<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Yeah, and I hate that. You can hardly see at nite if u&#39;re human or don&#39;t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>have any lightsource with u.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n7)Face choices variety needs a HUGE update.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Well, generating 3ds are quite space and memory consuming...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>8)Almost bug-free....now now, lets not talk about UO. &lt;grins&gt;<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; heheh<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>9)Marcoing is still present but MUCH MUCH SO MUCH MUCH SO MUCH more less<br/>\neffective.<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Aye, actually what marcoing?? That game u bascially use hotkeys to play<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the game. And better brush up on the typing skills. U&#39;ll want to type very<br/>\nfast in certain situation. Heheh.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n10)Mules are like useless.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Aye, u need to level up if u want to have trade skills eg smithing &#39;cos<br/>\n </span></blockquote>there&#39;s skill points limit u can attain for a lvl.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n11)If your Lawyer or your Boss is drowning, would you choose going to the<br/>\nmovies or to StarBucks? &lt;drafted&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; If Starwars in being screen then, it&#39;s Starwars!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cheers,<br/>\nWilson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWar does not determine who is right....<br/>\nonly who is left.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Bertrand Russell<br/>\n<br/>\nGary Qui Hong Loong<br/>\nTechnical Support Executive<br/>\nPacific Internet Limited<br/>\n89 Science Park Drive, #04-09 <br/>\nThe Rutherford, Lobby B <br/>\nSingapore 118261 <br/>\nTel: 1800-872-3330        Fax: 7736812 <br/>\n================================== <br/>\nHomepage: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pacific.net.sg/TS\">http://www.pacific.net.sg/TS</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
