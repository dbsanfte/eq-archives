I saw your message in the Pacific Internet <br/>\nnewsgroup, and have taken the liberty of posting it in this mailing <br/>\nlist we have running.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe address of the mailing list is in the CC: field of this message.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour post is as follows (this poster is from the Pacnet newsgroup, <br/>\nguys; maybe Sereph can &quot;convince&quot; him of which server to choose. <br/>\n*heh*):<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: I hope you don&#39;t mind seeing your whole post again, Dexter. I <br/>\nam e-mailing to you as well as the newsgroup in one shot.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Dexter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dexterw@...\">dexterw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nNewsgroups: sg.pacnet.games.discuss,sg.marketplace<br/>\nSubject: EQ Everquest players pls read<br/>\n<br/>\nHi to all the Singapore Everquest players. I&#39;ll get straight to the<br/>\npoint :) I wish to compile a list of the Singapore players in EQ. <br/>\nWhy would I wanna do this? Well with this list we can easily know <br/>\nwhich server has the most Singaporeans and also for future EQ <br/>\nplayers another reason why they should choose a particular server. <br/>\nAlso this allows the already in EQ players a chance to make a new <br/>\nchar on those singaporan populated servers as when we play at <br/>\nnight it&#39;ll be early morning in USA so your friends will not be online <br/>\nand so you can maybe choose to make a new char in those server <br/>\nwith singaporeans to play with them together. So if you play EQ, <br/>\nplease email me with the main server you play in, as well as the <br/>\nother servers which you sometimes go to(if any). When I have a list <br/>\nI&#39;ll email you back together with the list. Might also be posting the <br/>\nlist to my homepage. Lastly I need a small favour from anyone of <br/>\nyou. I bought EQ on the 1st day it was released in Singapore but I <br/>\nHAVENT GOT A CHANCE TO PLAY IT YET haha. This is bcos I <br/>\ndont have a credit card :( . I&#39;ll be able to apply for a card in 2 <br/>\nmonths time(after my b/day) so in the mean time I wont be able to <br/>\nplay it. So Im hoping if anyone can help me by activating my <br/>\naccount for me. I have registered, but have not bill my account yet. <br/>\nI hope someone can make a 3 months payment for me. 3 <br/>\nmonthscost US$25. I&#39;ll send you S$50, and when you receive the <br/>\nmoney, then activate my account for 3 months, and you can keep <br/>\nthe amount thats left, as a token of my appreciation. If you&#39;ll like to <br/>\nhelp please state this in your email. Anyway please email me the <br/>\nserver list. Helping or dont help activate my account is another <br/>\nissue its ok nothing to do with this. I wanted to make a list to <br/>\nbenefit everyone. The account thingy, at most I wait until I apply for <br/>\na card :( so pls pls email me with the server list. Thanks!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
