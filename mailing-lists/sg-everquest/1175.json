Of coz, he <br/>\nkena killed many times and Garren, Wylven and I were the last 3 who stayed <br/>\nwith him to get most of his corpses.  At the end he still claimed he lost <br/>\nfew pp, dvinn dagger etc which Wylven and Garren were kind enough to pass <br/>\nsome of their loot to him.  So that was my 1st encounter with this DE wiz <br/>\nname Voyesbian.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the weekend, he was hunting at HH solo, and attacked some of our <br/>\npreys.  But he is too weak to steal from our group of lvl 18-20, and he <br/>\nmentioned he just wanna hit once to gain faction.  We have no objection <br/>\nover this and we also try not to attack his prey.  He gain from lvl 9 to <br/>\nlvl 13 within the weekend, which is pretty fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nH/w, last night while hunting at HH, I noticed he started to steal from our <br/>\ngroup.  He no longer nuke once or twice but nuke full force to get the <br/>\nkill.  FYI he is WAITING for the tanks in the group to hurt mob b4 he start <br/>\nto nuke.  I ask him why is he doing such thing to his own guildmate and he <br/>\nsaid he just need 1-3 more kills b4 he log.  The true fact is tat he is <br/>\nactually stay longer than that.  He is stealing at HH, and he steal from <br/>\nfrom another groups as well.  He steal so ofen that one players from the <br/>\nother guild, Lionessa, started to make noise.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started to observe how this Voy hunt and at one time I was even accused <br/>\nby Lionessa for stealing her kill, while it&#39;s actually Voy who did it (I&#39;m <br/>\njust watching with OOM!).  I&#39;m kinda pissed to get such accuse.  Shortly <br/>\nLionessa page for a GM, and Voy log immediatelywhen GM Glim arrvived <br/>\n(guilty I guess).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen GM Glim arrive, I explained to him, and he understand the situation <br/>\nwhich wiz are always accused of stealing kills.  He also understand it&#39;s <br/>\nVoy who did the stealing and I&#39;m innocent.  GM Glim then went off shortly.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater part of the hunt, this Lionessa come over and drop comments saying <br/>\nshe have make few stealers banned by GM since she played EQ for 4 mths. <br/>\n WTF?  My problem if she kill too slow?  I wanna stressed again that the <br/>\ncasters in my groups NEVER steal kill, in the sense that we never wait for <br/>\nother teams to hurt the mobs for 30-40% HP b4 we start to nuke.  Members <br/>\nlike Ling, Flyingfox, Satoru and myself hunt often but I&#39;m firm to say we <br/>\ngain xp with our hard work.  When there are groups of lvl 20s steal from <br/>\nus, we hardly make any noise but to hunt elsewhere, so I can&#39;t understand <br/>\nwhy cry babies like Lionessa make so much noise.  Anyway later Demitry <br/>\nsuggest to all group members to petition for players harrassment (since her <br/>\nwords sounded SO threatening, hehe), and well, no GM come, haha.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just a note to all local kakis to watch out for this member <br/>\nVoyesbian.  Not that we are not helpful but I caution all to think twice <br/>\nbefore helping this kinda players.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur boss Wylven (who is unaware of this incident) made Voyesbian a guild <br/>\nofficer last weekend, and the thought of sharing an officer post with such <br/>\nplayer make me sick.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus.<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: U guys noticed we got more wiz in guild nowadays?  After me, Les, Sat <br/>\n(high elf) and Ling (erudite), the rest of the new wiz are all from DE. <br/>\n Hehe.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
