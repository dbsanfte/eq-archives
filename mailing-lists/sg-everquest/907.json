Just bank<br/>\neverything and sprint to BB and take the boot to FP. The whole journey<br/>\nis pretty much Mob free, my bard made it to FP at level 5-6 I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd nope, I don&#39;t get on Kali much. My nick there is Garford anyway. I<br/>\nuse Sereph ONLY for RPG games<br/>\n<br/>\n[Useless fact of the day: I never ever played a male character in an RPG<br/>\ngame(be it PnP ones or electronic ones), unless I have no choice in the<br/>\ngender and the 2 most used names are Sabella and Sereph in that order]<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd hell no, I&#39;m not a castration fanatic. I only castrated Enteri as it<br/>\ntook him so long to do a task for me and some people I dislike in not so<br/>\nreal life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlways remember this fact: Sereph is a female name.<br/>\n<br/>\nSereph, door to door parang saleswoman who won&#39;t take no for an answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSynzzz wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  Freeport???
