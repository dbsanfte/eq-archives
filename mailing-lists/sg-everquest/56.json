For","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1337619575\">Greetings Everyone,<br/>\nWell, everytime before you hit the &quot;Generate Character&quot; button. They will<br/>\ntell you the difficulty rate. For monk, its Moderate. For Barbarian, its<br/>\neasy etc... Race will effect the rate for at least 30% in my opinion. I<br/>\nbelieve Entreri is going to have a time of his life playing a baddy DarkElf<br/>\nhahaha!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, HighElves and other races such as Erudites don&#39;t speak the common<br/>\ntongue. So you have to practise and learn their language to interact with<br/>\nthem, if not the following will happen. &lt;You being the human&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman : Hello Mr Erudite with that super long forehead!<br/>\nErudite : Pfdhhaf, ahfdhrejuyj. jhjlsdsu ghrdth! &lt;nshht&gt;<br/>\nHuman : Huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for classes, Shaman is best all rounder mage. Magicians kick SERIOUS-ass<br/>\nonce they hit Level 48. 2 shots of their Ice Spell will kill any average<br/>\nplayer. Not sure about the effects on monsters though. Monsters will last<br/>\nlonger than players, I THINK!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for skills, you can&#39;t choose them. They are there for you and for you<br/>\nonly. However, you won&#39;t be able to use the skill until certain levels. Lets<br/>\ntake monks for example cos they are the most simple to understand...<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you hit Level 5, you will have a new skill &quot;Round Kick&quot; added to your<br/>\nlist. It is only then, that you are able to use it. So before you reach<br/>\nlevel 5, you are stuck with normal punch and kick. At Level 13, you will get<br/>\n&quot;Tiger Claw&quot; So at Level 13, you will get an extra alternative for your<br/>\nfighting style. Hence you can either choose to Kick, Punch, Round Kick or<br/>\nTiger Claw.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer sophisticated fights, not like Bruce Lee. But most people are like<br/>\nBruce Lee. Short swift death for enemies. So they will KEEP USING ONLY the<br/>\nbest special attacks like Flying Kick and Dragon Punch. I however will stick<br/>\nto a few normal punches then let out one Flying Kick then few normal kicks<br/>\nthen a Tiger Claw etc. More variety in my fighting style...nicer for the<br/>\nonlookers also ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for ranting,<br/>\nWilson<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can anyone share their experience in char creation, esp for newbies (hmm,<br/>\n&gt; more for all-rounded chars with best &#39;advantages&#39; in the game):<br/>\n&gt; - Which race?<br/>\n&gt; - Which character?<br/>\n&gt; - Which skills you pick in the begining, and what skills you intend to<br/>\npick<br/>\n&gt; up later?<br/>\n&gt; - Stats? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
