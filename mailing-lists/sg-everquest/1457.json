The only bad thing is getting the<br/>\n&gt; skill up and it requires... Skill 5-20 Edible Goo - Fire Beetle Eye +<br/>\n&gt; Rat EarSkill 20-35 Bat Wing Crunchies - Frosting + Bat WingSkill 35-82<br/>\n&gt; Fish Fillet - Fish + Jug of SauceI have only managed to get to 82.<br/>\n&gt; From skill 60 onwards, I start to make some money... perhaps enough to<br/>\n&gt; cover the cost for the fish n sauce... i didnt take note of the<br/>\n&gt; numbers as I was spending time trying to up my fishing skill as<br/>\n&gt; well... so not sure bout that bit... when my fishing skill max out fer<br/>\n&gt; my level... i started buying fish n sauce... n thast when i discover i<br/>\n&gt; make some moeny... from what i see... this is as good as brewing... in<br/>\n&gt; fact slightly better... bcos u only need 2 components...  below is the<br/>\n&gt; breakdown (from neriak).1 fish sell for 3sp 1cp1 jug of sauce sell for<br/>\n&gt; 1sp 3 cpTotal Cost = 4sp 4cp If successful, i make 2 fish fillet, each<br/>\n&gt; sell for 4sp 8cp so 2 will make 9sp 6cp. Profit of 100% At close to 70<br/>\n&gt; i get like 70% successful... so profit is pretty good... 80 as well...<br/>\n&gt; but sometimes do get down on the luck n fail quite a few in a<br/>\n&gt; row... another way to get those items to go to Freeport and ask<br/>\n&gt; newbies to get those items... i tried to get most myself... so that<br/>\n&gt; explains the long time taken... at the final stage... i auction for 20<br/>\n&gt; batwings fer 5gp... tons of em will rush to get those wings fer u...<br/>\n&gt; so it worked pretty fine...if u guys are bored of fighting stuff...<br/>\n&gt; maybe u can give it a try and gain some useful skills... maybe just<br/>\n&gt; enough to buy our spells... but IMHO thats enough... least till level<br/>\n&gt; 20... :) thast all bout baking...NicademousA Dark Elf Necromancer that<br/>\n&gt; stayed up all nite just to make some fish<br/>\n&gt; fillets...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; SC Cheng, Freddy<br/>\n&gt; Mobile-Internet Laboratory, Multimedia Laboratory,<br/>\n&gt; NTT DoCoMo R&D Center C212,<br/>\n&gt; 3-5, Hikari no Oka, Yokosuka-Shi,<br/>\n&gt; Kanagawa, 239-8536, Japan<br/>\n&gt; Tel : +81 468-40-3497<br/>\n&gt; Fax: +81 468-40-3788<br/>\n&gt; Email : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\n<br/>\nGary Qui Hong Loong<br/>\nTechnical Support Executive<br/>\nPacific Internet Technical Support Department .<br/>\nPacific Internet Limited.<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nPacific Surf : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pacific.net.sg\">http://www.pacific.net.sg</a><br/>\nTechnical Support Helpline : 1800-8723330<br/>\nCustomer Support Helpline : 1800-8725055<br/>\n89 Science Park Drive<br/>\n#04-09/12 The Rutherford<br/>\nSingapore 118261</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
