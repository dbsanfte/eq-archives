Also dun bother to spend <br/>\nany points on ya magery skills, they are already available on ya personal <br/>\nskill list.  Also dun spend any points on piercing (ie dagger) skill.  The <br/>\nonly time u need to spend ya skill points is when u get a worn great stave. <br/>\n Spend just 1 point on 2H blunt and keep the rest for future.  I was conned <br/>\nby the net stating that we need to spend a point in magery skills, which I <br/>\ntested to prove it wrong using my gnome wiz.  We dun have to train in it, <br/>\njust keep casting in town will do.  Most impt thing is once u start ya <br/>\nchar, train ya magery skills to lvl ceiling, u will automatically get <br/>\nimprovement on these skills.  Do the lvl ceiling training everytime u gain <br/>\na lvl.  For magery classes, our lvl ceiling is (lvl+1)X5.  Eg lvl 1 ceiling <br/>\nis skill 10, lvl 2 is skill 15 etc.  For melee our lvl ceiling is <br/>\n(lvl+1)X3.  During lvl 1-4, it doesnt matter if ya piercing skill is zero, <br/>\nu can gain lvl easily - just endure until u can get a 2H stave and start <br/>\ntraining it.  Once u reach lvl 4, spend another skill point on mediation. <br/>\n The rest dun bother - keep the skill points until u wanna learn a trade <br/>\nskills or special magery skill like research or specialization.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember Dragco from our UO allies TAA?  Tat chap get his lvl 11 wiz in <br/>\njust a week in other server, so hard to pull him over to innoruuk now ;(<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: Maybe I also start a DE char with u and test play it, provided I got <br/>\ntime ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wednesday, June 23, 1999 8:31 AM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hi,<br/>\n&gt; i will most likely be starting out this coming weekend... although im <br/>\n </span></blockquote>still expecting the game (but should be here quite soon)... just wondering <br/>\nif any of u guys will be kind enough to donate some freebies to a newbie <br/>\nwith a starter kit?
