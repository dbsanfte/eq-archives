Mines only 4 but raises &quot;quite&quot; fast.<br/>\n<br/>\n- At the begining stage, I believe I will fail many times.  May I know if I<br/>\nfail, what&#39;s the implication?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;You can&#39;t tell from the screen if you fail or succeed.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Does failure means heal less or the bandage is totally wasted and heal<br/>\nnothing at all?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I believe less but if below skill pt of 20. I think its practically waste<br/>\nof bandages.<br/>\n<br/>\n- So far I didnt anyhow use my practice point.  I think I have around<br/>\n35points balance at lvl 8.  To minimise the cost of bandage, is it advisable<br/>\nto throw them all into bind wound skill?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Nah but then you might, IF you have no other trade skills or hard to train<br/>\nmagic spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Can this bind wound skill heal other than self?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Yes! Good for saving lives! I saved mine and others saved mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n- What is the healing effect of this skill, does it have a delay time?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;It heals up to 20hps. Delay time is quite short so you don&#39;t have to<br/>\nworry. When you heal, it does the &quot;looting&quot; action.<br/>\n<br/>\n- How can one rise the skill fast?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Get a magician or some kind of mage class to conjure them for you. Do play<br/>\nthem though &lt;grins&gt; About the market price, I&#39;ve no idea cos I got mine<br/>\nfree.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Can wiz use this skill while fighting?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Once the healing target moves, you are interrupted so the answer is no.<br/>\n<br/>\n- What is the lvl ceiling of this skill for wiz?  3+3/lvl (like our melee<br/>\nskill) or 5+5/lvl (like our magery skill)?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Pardon me but for this, I&#39;ve no idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nWilson aka Yutaka </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
