This quest is currently doable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following are the components needed for the quest...<br/>\n<br/>\nInitial Stage Components:<br/>\n<br/>\n3 Honeycombs (from bixie corpses) and 5 gold TO GET Honey <br/>\nJum(LORE) in Rivervale.<br/>\n<br/>\n1 Innoruuk&#39;s Kiss of Death(LORE) bought in Erudin TO GET 1 <br/>\nErud&#39;s Tonic(LORE) in Erudin.<br/>\n<br/>\n2nd Stage components:<br/>\n<br/>\nHoney Jum(LORE) as above.<br/>\n<br/>\nErud&#39;s Tonic(LORE) as above.<br/>\n<br/>\nKiola Nut bought in Ocean of Tears, Sisterhood Island for 2 gold.<br/>\n<br/>\nKoalindl Fish(LORE) from Koalindl fish corpses. These fish can <br/>\nonly be found in Qeynos&#39; Temple of Life. Killing these fish to get <br/>\ntheir corpses will cause faction to go down with Qeynos Guards, <br/>\nClerics of Life and the god Rodcet Nife himself. I have heard <br/>\nrumours that fishing in the temple lake can sometimes drag up one <br/>\nof these fishes, but a high skill is required. Whether this is true, <br/>\nand exactly what &quot;high&quot; means, I do not know. Perhaps any <br/>\nmaster fishers might like to try?<br/>\n<br/>\n3rd Stage Component:<br/>\n<br/>\nBarkeeps&#39; Compendium(LORE)(NODROP) from Gregor in East <br/>\nFreeport, who wants the Honey Jum, Erud&#39;s Tonic, Kiola Nut and <br/>\nKoalindl Fish for the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter getting the book, this stage involves making a run to Oggok, <br/>\nwhere there are LOTS of big, ugly (and very red) ogres, and giving <br/>\nthis book to Clurg the bartender there. He will then cough up a <br/>\nStein.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter much hunting by our scavenger team comprising Einan, <br/>\nLeshrec and Ziltus, led by Sereph and myself, we managed to get <br/>\n1st and 2nd stage components.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur FedEx operative Ziltus then pieced together all these pieces <br/>\nand passed them to my Enchanter waiting in Freeport. I then <br/>\nexchanged the four 3rd stage items to get the Barkeeps&#39; <br/>\nCompendium(NODROP), ran to Oggok, where I &quot;became&quot; a Dark <br/>\nElf, waltzed in to see Clurg, cast Alliance to improve my faction, <br/>\nand made the exchange. Then, I gated outta there faster than you <br/>\ncan say &quot;stinky ogre ass&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only worry I have is this negative faction with Kazon <br/>\nStormhammer, the Dwarven King.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, all you kakis who want to get their hands on a Stein, better <br/>\nstart hunting those stage 1 and 2 components. (We&#39;ve got lots of <br/>\nKiola Nuts though...)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also seems a good source of income. I believe the Steins can <br/>\neasily go for 400 plat a pop, probably more. Hey, Fedex Ziltus... <br/>\nneed some extra cash? *heh*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLove is in the air...<br/>\nGet me a gas mask, quick!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nCya,<br/>\nPraetor<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Praetor@...\">Praetor@...</a><br/>\nICQ 1767778</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
