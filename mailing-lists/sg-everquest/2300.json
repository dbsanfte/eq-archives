Seem like","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-853175641\">We are hunting FBR tat day, not boot.  She was hunting there naked, and 1 <br/>\nday later we heard from her friend auction in SK tat she is selling FBR. <br/>\n Seem like she hunt FBR for income, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm, as for the tin pie, not sure if it&#39;s as bad as u mentioned, but I <br/>\nheard u actually need to do something to make it rather than to buy it.  I <br/>\nthink the impact is not tat extreme.  Anway even for new servers, there is <br/>\nstill exploits which pple use to make tons and tons of money. Say by tat <br/>\ntime u got a lvl 40 char and u are not aware of the bug where others have <br/>\nused it to make tons of pp, what u gonna do? ;)  Just like the gp dupe in <br/>\nUO, everyone still live with it. Over time, houses will decay...players <br/>\nquit...the economy will slowly go back to normal (macro-economics? hahaha).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe nerfing of necro pet is just a rumor.  Dun take everythig in test <br/>\ncenter as 100% confirmed.  Some they tested but decide not to implement <br/>\ninstead.  Anyway, I dun think necro need 3x longer casting time than wiz. <br/>\n I got some necro friends and when we hunt, I can see their spells hit the <br/>\nmob almost the same time as us.  Talk abt disturbance, wiz can &#39;taunt&#39; <br/>\nbetter than any tanks out there.  With my nuke, I always invite mob to <br/>\nfocus full attention on me, that why I bring at least 50 gems for <br/>\nleatherskin everytime I hunt (5gp each).  When mob on me, it&#39;s more like I <br/>\nget disturbed most amg all casters (dun believe, ask FF when we hunt in HH, <br/>\nthe mob desert him and his pet the moment I nuke it).<br/>\n<br/>\nDEX is not the only element to decide u get disturbed when casting.  At <br/>\nhigh lvl, spec also play a part.  Many times I I got hit by mob but I see <br/>\nmsg tat I regain and con&#39;t casting.  I think for those caster with pets, u <br/>\nshld let pet tank for the 1st 30% dam b4 u cast.  We wiz got no choice, no <br/>\npet to tank, so we have to nuke mob to hell b4 it kills us.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for lvl 31 wiz soloing 2 treants, I&#39;m the one who has done it last <br/>\nnight, b4 Fesse, Zan, FF and DF join me ;)  All I need it to cast leather <br/>\nskin, ele shield on myself, and nuke a tree using 3 nukes (2x243, 1x187). <br/>\n After taking the 1st tree, my leatherskin is gone (but still 90% HP), then <br/>\nI started nuking the 2nd.  I left 20% mana and 50% HP after killing the 2nd <br/>\n(and boy, I got half bubb xp!).  I dun have any SoW or buff from other <br/>\nplayers, just plain wiz buff and nuke ;)  One thing to highlight tat at DEX <br/>\n83 only, I dun get disturbed often even when tree hit me using melee, maybe <br/>\ndue to my high evoke spec skill.  I also move ard when tree cast AE on me, <br/>\nbut I cast at the right time such tat I dun get disturbed by my own <br/>\nmovements.  I dunno why Maquis is so jiat-lat handling the treants (esp I <br/>\nknow he got Jboot), maybe becoz he only know how to steal kill and not <br/>\nother wiz tactics.  See, that&#39;s why I say experiences and tactics counts ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think my wiz stats is one of the worst ard, yet I&#39;m still <br/>\nsurviving.  I also whine sometime when I see other casters using they pets <br/>\nto lvl, but deep inside I know if there is a server wipe, I will still go <br/>\nback to wiz ;)  I hope u have found a right choice for youself. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Friday, 03 September, 1999 5:20 PM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; trade skill is a joke in EQ... besides jewelcraft... since <br/>\n </span></blockquote>blacksmithing...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; u can only make banded... is stupid i think... there should be more<br/>\n&gt; options.. also tailoring... where int he world got a tailor that can make<br/>\n&gt; leather stuff BUT not cloth? also... the bonding cost so much more... in <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; end tailoring is harder than blacksmithing....in terms of trade skill... <br/>\n </span></blockquote>i<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; think UO did a much much better job... only thing they lack is magical<br/>\n&gt; items...
