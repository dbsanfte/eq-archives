Come to think of it..is anyone even interested?<br/>\n&gt;       FP far meh? level 6 more than enough to travel there. Just<br/>\n&gt;      bank everything and sprint to BB and take the boot to FP.<br/>\n&gt;      The whole journey is pretty much Mob free, my bard made it<br/>\n&gt;      to FP at level 5-6 I think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      And nope, I don&#39;t get on Kali much.

I use Sereph ONLY for RPG games<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      [Useless fact of the day: I never ever played a male<br/>\n&gt;      character in an RPG game(be it PnP ones or electronic ones),<br/>\n&gt;      unless I have no choice in the gender and the 2 most used<br/>\n&gt;      names are Sabella and Sereph in that order]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      And hell no, I&#39;m not a castration fanatic.
