Then if you have a compass, you will be able to get to the body easily ;-) Where to get the compass? Near the wharf at Qeynos, around Mermaid&#39;s Lure.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually if I know I&#39;m gonna die, I will just run to the nearest road path and fight til my last. So when retrieving, I&#39;d just run along the main road and will sure be able to stumble upon it ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nWilson</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
