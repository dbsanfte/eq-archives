U can only ask someone to hunt on ya behalf<br/>\n&gt;&gt; PROVIDED they dun need one, as in #3).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The dangers:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 1. JK Skull & RTS r dropped by the gnolls (high sha and emi) at the zone<br/>\n&gt;&gt; entrance from SK to LR (during the day).  The gnolls, gnoll guards and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; gnoll shamans lvl below 18 I think, but the shaman will heal the high sha<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and emi (both ard lvl 20) when we fight, even thou they themselves are<br/>\n </span></blockquote>con<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; green to us and will not be involved in the fight.  I think those below<br/>\n </span></blockquote>15,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; when trying to walk thru the camp, will invite a train of 3+4+3=10 gnolls<br/>\n&gt;&gt; on you! ;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The camp will turn to undead ruins at night, where skeletons, greater<br/>\n&gt;&gt; mummies (lvl 23-24) and dry bones (lvl 24-25) will haunt the place.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; any one below lvl 20 and walk pass the camp may invite a train of undeads<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; =&gt;Our plan is to camp near zone and the high lvls will help to kill the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; mobs and ask those lower lvls to come in to loot.  Of coz, in this case,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; priority will give to those who phyically involved in the fighting 1st ;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 2. Water Crystal Staff<br/>\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s dropped by a OVERPOWERED lvl 24-26 aqua goblin called Webclaw.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Webbie<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; can found in serveral spots in LR.  Its magical hit VERY HARD and is VERY<br/>\n&gt;&gt; AGRO in water, and thing get worse if we enagaed it in the water (we get<br/>\n&gt;&gt; disturbed more often when casting, and swim slower, if we lose, chances<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; that we will get killed and corpse sinks into the deep lake, then corpse<br/>\n&gt;&gt; seeking and looting session will start).  After much investigation (I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;&gt; been camping in LR from lvl 20 to 27), I will lead the team to the spawn<br/>\n&gt;&gt; spot of Webbie, which is the tower isle (extreme end from zone, that mean<br/>\n&gt;&gt; there is NO way to flee if we lose UNLESS we bind near zone, gate out and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; zone).  The plan is to root Webbie (btw it also run VERY fast) the moment<br/>\n&gt;&gt; it spawn before it run towards shore.  I&#39;ve tried rooting Web in water (I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; know other spots it shows its face) but seem like a bug will make it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; disappear the moment it is rooted in water (I won&#39;t advise to melee it in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; water unless Garren is coming, coz it&#39;s not funny to search for ya corpse<br/>\n&gt;&gt; in the deep blue lake).<br/>\n&gt;&gt; There is 2 concerns regarding the danger for this hunt:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; a. To get to the tower isle, you have to swim across the whole lake.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Danger arise when u meet some giant fresh sharks (bigger size than orge)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; frogloks, aqua goblin, water snakes, or worse, Webclaw itself and Froglok<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Prince (lvl 30 plus, very powerful, con red, and very very agro, out to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; kill EVERYTHING in lake).  This problem can be overcome by taking a boat<br/>\n&gt;&gt; from gnoll camp to tower isle (but take much longer).<br/>\n&gt;&gt; b. The spawn spot for Webclaw, UNFORTUNATELY, is also the spawn spot of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Froglok Prince (lvl 30 plus, very powerful and agro) and a deep sea<br/>\n </span></blockquote>goblin<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; pet (lvl 22 to 25 I think).  With FF and me, it&#39;s no big deal taking Web,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; or even when the pet spawn at the same time.  H/w, SUAY SUAY, if the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Prince<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; spawn during the fight or come to us, both of us will be the one to gate<br/>\n&gt;&gt; first, since we will have NO fight versus the Prince ;(<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; This hunting trip is NOT for anyone below 4th circle (even if we buff u<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; full and guard u all time). Unlike the Guk hunt, it&#39;s VERY difficult to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; find ya corpse if u died in lake, and chances is that u will lose ya<br/>\n </span></blockquote>stuffs<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; forever.  To prevent wasting more than half of the time finding/looting<br/>\n&gt;&gt; corpses, this trip is STRICTLY for 4th & above circle chars (lvl 12 for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; casters, not sure for others) only.  Frankly speaking I believe all kakis<br/>\n&gt;&gt; got at least a 4th circle chars, whether primarily or secondary chars.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Just dun bring ya newbie char along pls.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; LAST NOTE:  This is not a XP or $$$ hunting trip.  There will be no<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hunting<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; of aviak guards etc for xp and coins.  It&#39;s a very task-specific trip -<br/>\n </span></blockquote>get<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; the 3 artifacts for those who need them and get out of the place (I can<br/>\n&gt;&gt; gate to Fay, Tox, NK by then).  Anyone who are impatient while waiting<br/>\n </span></blockquote>for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; the spawn and turn to hunt others will bear their own risk soloing it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(lvl<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; 20 to 22), coz we will not waste time and mana helping anyone to gain xp<br/>\n&gt;&gt; there.  Webclaw spawn and run very fast from tower to shore, maybe within<br/>\n </span></blockquote>5<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; seconds or so, we can&#39;t afford to miss it, given that it&#39;s a rare spawn.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; PREPARATION:  Everyone please get ready AT LEAST 40 foods, 40 drinks and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>40<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; of your spell reagients (if applicable).

FF and I can actually do all these by ourselves but<br/>\n </span></blockquote>we<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; have decided to help all others (esp casters) to get also, so pls do<br/>\n&gt;&gt; everyone a favor by preparing yourself ;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; BINDING:  All casters will bind once they zone into LR.  We then move on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; arena (which many lamers invis inside and KOS whoever that zone in, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the only binding zone in the region, sigh).  FF and I will go in to scout<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the entrance to ensure it&#39;s cleared.  We will then take turn to invis<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (guarding) and binding, asking the others to come in one by one.  Once<br/>\n </span></blockquote>all<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; binded, we then go back to gnoll camp and start the hunting.  NO<br/>\n </span></blockquote>arguement<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; on hunting at gnoll camp 1st then bind the non-casters, coz if anyone<br/>\n </span></blockquote>died,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; they will have to run few zones back to LR and it&#39;s a total WASTE of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>time.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;  Make it an effective and efficient hunt pls!!!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; HUNT PHASE ONE:  Below lvl 20 all sit at zone, above lvl 20s will move in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to hunt.
