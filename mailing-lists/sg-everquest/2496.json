If not, Bolt <br/>\ngenerally needs longer than Shock.<br/>\n2)Necro&#39;s pets are bugged now, if you give them a weapon, they will take the <br/>\nspeed of the weapon and the base damage of the MOB of their level. That <br/>\nmeans that if you give it a weapon with 13 delay at level 49 it will hit <br/>\nwith 13 delay and for about 50-60 a pop. That is why they toned down both <br/>\nthe Mage and Necro pet the previous patch. But from what I can see from the <br/>\nscreams and flames in a msg. board, I think Necro&#39;s pet still no change, <br/>\nonly lower damage. They still take the speed of the weapon you give it.<br/>\n3)Mages nuke never draw the MOB to us because for level 29 to 33 and level <br/>\n39 to 44 Wizards can do almost twice the damage a Mage can. This is because <br/>\nMages gets a new DD or Bolt spell every 10 levels. That is why MOBs seems to <br/>\nbe attracted to Wizards like ants to sugar.<br/>\n4)Our buffs are &#39;store buffs&#39;... I hate to burst you bubble, but the only <br/>\nthing Mages have worth summoning that is useful to a group is RingofFlight. <br/>\nOur other &#39;store buffs&#39;/weapon summoning spell also useful, if everyone dies <br/>\nand need to get their body back from the middle of a dungeon. Even then, the <br/>\nweapon&#39;s stats is pathetic for their level. Imagine using a <br/>\nBarbedLeatherWhip at level 38 to fight without any armor.<br/>\n5)Pets tank for you while you flee. No arguement, my Mage have saved my <br/>\nparty numerous time by making my pet to tank the stupid GreaterDarkBone that <br/>\ndrops through the ceiling in the Unrest Bartender room.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [sg-everquest] Magi Talk<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 29 Sep 1999 09:37:58 +0800<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I disagree Magi is lousy, and also disagreed tat magi w/o pet is 1/2 wiz<br/>\n&gt;w/o rooting.  In fact, in most places other than dungeon, I mean after lvl<br/>\n&gt;30, magi can solo better than wiz (remember u can solo in HH at lvl 30 but<br/>\n&gt;I cant?).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At high lvl, ya lava spell (900dd) can be purchased easily while we have to<br/>\n&gt;quest or research for our ice comet (1200dd).  Ya casting time is also much<br/>\n&gt;shorter I believe (bolt spell casting time is shorter than shocl spells).<br/>\n&gt;  Most of magi buff are &#39;stored buff&#39;, where u can summon till u log.  I<br/>\n&gt;basically think magi is pretty cool.  H/w, above lvl 34, we really need to<br/>\n&gt;find good team and right place to adventure (same for other classes).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Btw, I dun think u need root spell coz ya EE can root for u.  Ever notice<br/>\n&gt;how the mob get &#39;rooted&#39; by ya pet when u send pet in and nuke?  When I<br/>\n&gt;team with u, I always wonder why is it so, esp when ya dd is now higher<br/>\n&gt;than mine.  I think this is how Verant compensate magi for &#39;rooting&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;  Unlike u, when we team, u send in pet and nuke, mob wont come to u, but <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;come to me the moment I nuke.  I think Verant make it such tat mob will<br/>\n&gt;treat ya pet as part of u.  So when u nuke harder, ya pet can still take<br/>\n&gt;the punishment from u.  Most impt of all, when wiz oom, we are dead meat<br/>\n&gt;99% of the time unless we are just next to zone.   Magi, on the other hand,<br/>\n&gt;can make use of pet to die for u while u flee to zone.  Of coz once ya pet<br/>\n&gt;died, mob will still out run u, but at least u got longer fleeing time than<br/>\n&gt;wiz.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Necro pet is also cool, but their spells are mainly dot.  There is no tank<br/>\n&gt;(nuking) mage in EQ, but I believe magi is the only tank AND mage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can still solo a bit coz of jboot.  U shld know I&#39;m also bad luck like<br/>\n&gt;u..but I guess we just have to keep trying. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Tuesday, 28 September, 1999 11:04 PM, Tommy Fong<br/>\n&gt;[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tommyfong@...\">tommyfong@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Tommy Fong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tommyfong@...\">tommyfong@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Garren,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m ok.  Dun take it seriously.  I was just tired of Magician.  Without<br/>\n&gt;the pets, he is only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1/2 wiz without the rooting ability.  That sux.  Most high lvl hunting<br/>\n&gt;place are dungeon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that pets pose a high risk.  Maybe time to switch to my shaman.
