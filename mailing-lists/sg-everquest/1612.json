Also anyone has an idea of how many lvls a mob has to be<br/>\n&gt; above you to resist your spells?<br/>\n&gt; I was getting totally resisted by one red conned griffene which was really<br/>\n&gt; tough as even the lvl 22 tanks in our group<br/>\n&gt; was doing much much less than his normal max dmg. And a lvl 18 ranger was<br/>\n&gt; either getting riposted or only doing 1 dmg<br/>\n&gt; max!<br/>\n&gt; Hope to hear some comments/opinions!<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Zanderion lvl 21 magi </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
