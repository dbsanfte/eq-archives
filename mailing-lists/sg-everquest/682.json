In Prexus, the first lvl 8","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2107282772\">If I&#39;ve make more R&D b4 playing EQ, I would have made a magi instead of <br/>\nwiz ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nA magi is a tank AND a mage, thou&#39; not a tank mage.  In Prexus, the first <br/>\nlvl 8 I met in the 2nd day server is up are a lvl 8 magi and a lvl 8 necro. <br/>\n They just camp some distance from the kobold camp and order their pet to <br/>\nguard (ie to &#39;book&#39;) the camp whole night and take all the kills, while <br/>\nthey sit and watch at a distance and collect XP.<br/>\n<br/>\nMagi is a very special class when it come to buff.  Unlike druid, shaman, <br/>\nenchanter and cleric, their buffing more of a &#39;storage&#39; type.  For eg, when <br/>\na druid cast levitation spell, the spell last for some time and had to <br/>\nre-cast when it wore off.  H/w, when a magi summon a levitation ring, this <br/>\nring can be given to any other chars and last until they logoff.  That&#39;s <br/>\nwhy I said magi buffing is more of a &#39;storage&#39; nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn top of that, gnome got the BEST vital and DAI points for a magi, hehe. <br/>\n But if u decide to be a high elf, it&#39;s also not bad, just that it&#39;ll not <br/>\nbe a power-played char coz u have to pump up high elf str inorder to armed <br/>\nyaself and carry some decent loots (err, I mean loot for magery classes, I <br/>\ndun expect u to carry something a warrior is carrying).<br/>\n<br/>\nMost important, try not to select 1H or 2H blunt weapon as ya weapon <br/>\nchoice, coz if u see the weapon summoning spells of magi, the best they can <br/>\nsummon is a magical dagger.  As a whole, I would say a magi is in par with <br/>\nnecro when it come to soloing.  Many pple complaints that necro pets r more <br/>\npowerful that magi.  From what I read from a article written by a EQ <br/>\nprogrammer (who himself is a magi), necro pet got higher lvl but it&#39;s magi <br/>\npet that got better stats (ops, cant remember which is which, hehe).  But <br/>\none thing for sure - magi pets got more variety and magi normally fail to <br/>\nsummon the right ele pets most of the time, that why their pet doesn&#39;t <br/>\nfight as good as necro.  According to the author, if a magi know his pets <br/>\nwell, generally speaking, summoning the right pet at the right time give <br/>\nmagi pet an advanage over necro&#39;s most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThou magi do not have the tap life spells, but they can summon bandages, <br/>\nfood, drink, phantom bag , armors, rings, lightstone, ultravision artifact <br/>\netc.  That&#39;s why I feel that they are more well-balanced for soloing. <br/>\n Sometimes I keep thinking them as carrying a provisional shop behind their <br/>\nback!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile other magery classes have to spend lots fo time earning money to buy <br/>\nmagical weap - magi do not have such problem.  Not only can they summon <br/>\nweap for themselves, they can also transfer summoned stuffs to their group <br/>\nmembers.  Best when the whole group just die and magi can summoned magical <br/>\nweap for their melee group members to &#39;tong&#39; for a while b4 getting their <br/>\ncorpse back.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck creating a magi, and may the &#39;force&#39; be with u, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus (aka DF in UO)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, June 17, 1999 8:17 AM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ive read up some papers (YES! i forgot which one, so dont ask me)... that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Varent has more surprises fer Magician than what we have seen.... i suppose <br/>\nsome &#39;hidden&#39; spells... or some boost fer em at some stages... but then... <br/>\nthast a paper fer mages... so i suppose they wanted to encourage more folks <br/>\nto take up as i believe there r only a small community playing em...
