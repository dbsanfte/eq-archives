Like my RL friend who just start playing<br/>\nEQ.<br/>\n&gt;  KNN I spend so much time giving his stuffs and helping him to go here and<br/>\n&gt; there.  Everytime he got killed and cant find corpse, I gotta help him<br/>\n&gt; refill equipment, hehe, until now he more or less settled with a Erudite<br/>\n&gt; wiz ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think general case - help to seek corpse can be done by asking in the<br/>\n&gt; zone, or any one in guild if they r available to do so.  But when it come<br/>\n&gt; to problematic situation, there must be someone in the guild who is<br/>\n&gt; &quot;idling&quot; ard and can offer help, esp when we play almost in the same time<br/>\n&gt; frame.  Basically I just dun like to see pple abusing such aid.  And first<br/>\n&gt; thing 1st, as in many EQ guidelines, it&#39;s better to explore a new place<br/>\n&gt; with some kakis.  Dun suga suga explore some high lvl dungeon which u dun<br/>\n&gt; even know if u can handle.  If u r not sure of the hunting spot, at least<br/>\n&gt; asking in guidesay or in mailing list, or best, check the net.  With the<br/>\n&gt; exisitng kakis, most are ard lvl 20, so shldnt have such problem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In ya case when u fall into Befallen&#39;s wall, it shld be ok to seek help<br/>\n&gt; from guild.  Definitely someone will be there to help, but dun expect all<br/>\n&gt; to stop everything they r doing to come, esp those who need to take boats<br/>\n&gt; and run 10 zones to reach u ;)  If a newbie just suga suga go najena,<br/>\n&gt; hoping to get some good loot by luck, and definitely he cant cope with the<br/>\n&gt; mob, then good luck to him.  If someone in guild is available to save him,<br/>\n&gt; good.  If not, I will let this newbie die and learn his lesson ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have to set a general guideline and view ah-hoc case by case.  If<br/>\n&gt; everytime there is a SOS and all is expected to go rescue, this kinda<br/>\nguild<br/>\n&gt; I also dun wanna join, since been a wiz who is expected to travel easier,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m to &#39;expected&#39; to be the 1st one to turn up for the rescue ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is once a UO guild member&#39;s younger bro who play UO and always got<br/>\n&gt; killed in the game, and start icqing all to save him.  So much so that in<br/>\n&gt; the end there is one time where no one turn up to help him (not willing or<br/>\n&gt; no one online) and he send a mass icq barking at everyone.  All I did is<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; reply his icq, f**k him upside down and tell him if he dun apologize to<br/>\nall<br/>\n&gt; and change his manner, I will ban him out of guild.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At the end of the day, it all depend if individual can think maturely.  If<br/>\n&gt; any member cannot learn to be independent and too reliance on others, I<br/>\n&gt; will give no face and f**k him upside. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Wednesday, 18 August, 1999 1:32 PM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy<br/>\n&gt; [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my mail already... then your mail even longer.. so i will try not to say<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much this time...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ok... swaping equipments between char is one thing... this one u use SOS<br/>\n&gt; u<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kenna fucked by all... but imagine like me the last time.. dropped into<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; well of befallen... and no fuckers wanna help... this if SOS sent and no<br/>\n&gt; one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can be bothered... then i dont see the point of the guild... the guild<br/>\n&gt; shoud<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be about helping each other (esp when u really need it) and hunting<br/>\n&gt; together<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at times... if u wanna swap stuff... thats more of a favor rather than a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; SOS... pls differentiate the 2 things! if u have 2 bloody chars... and 1<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; high level... then is easy lah... just give consent and let ya other<br/>\nchar<br/>\n&gt; &gt; come in n loot lor... but if someone seriously needs help... help should<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; given...

I will get to level 30<br/>\n&gt; asap<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even more and will not be stopping until i am happy with my level. It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seems<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be that when u have the level, camping any shit will be easy and<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dont have to rely on anyones help.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is VERY true, once u got the lvl, u can start hunting for stuffs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; See<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m still wearing my lvl 16 armor mainly?  See I undergo the power<br/>\n&gt; &gt; training<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in Lake Rathetear for the past weeks - I mixed so often with aviak<br/>\n&gt; guards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tat pple start calling me birdman, hehe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some stuff bout the guild charter.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. when a SOS (not to be abused) is being sent (e.g., such that a<br/>\n&gt; person<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; died in a terrible spot and impossible to get back, then everyone is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; online<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and is capable MUST BE there to help irregardless of what dman thing u<br/>\n&gt; r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hate to say this but i think the SOS WILL be abused.  No way to<br/>\n&gt; avoid.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  See too many abused case in UO and it will be the same in EQ (from<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; newbies&#39; shouts every now and then).  I&#39;m totally against such SOS<br/>\n&gt; rescue<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; where everyone online has to help regardless what u r doing. Imagine I<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get up to 10 msg asking for party gate within 30 min I login (some<br/>\neven<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tell me &quot;ah finally wait till u login&quot;, LOL), no way I gonna response<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; every SOS msg.  One of the most hated msg I get from UO is some newbie<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; members SOS msg tat pop up on my screen every now and then.  This is<br/>\n&gt; esp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worse in EQ when traveling is time-consuming, even with teleport spell<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; also need time to run and find the corpse.  In UO, once I noticed any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; member abusing this aid, I will let other veteran members know so as<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; let<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them stay in dungeon as a ghost or learn to walk back to town and get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; resurrection ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I personally proposed those within the zone offer their help if only<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can help (eg was buying, selling or solo random hunting).  Imagine if<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kill 24 orc trainer (5-6 hr waiting) in a row and I know SBS will<br/>\nspawn<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the next 2-3 spawn, I would think it will be better for the member to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spend<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5-30 min searching his corpse instead.  Sometime it is more practice<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; effective to seek help from the zone rather than waiting for own<br/>\nmember<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do it.  Eg 2 nights ago, I need someone to help in transferring stuffs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Zil to my new char, I start with guildsay, no response.  I msg few<br/>\n&gt; kakis,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some no response, some response saying they r few zones away hunting,<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; also didnt expect them to run all the way to help me, coz I think it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kinda impractical for them to do so.  In the end when I was abt to<br/>\nfind<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quiet place drop the item and login my new char to get it, I got msg<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; FF who is coming to GF for some camping and offer his help.  I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to blame anyone but in such situation, I think it&#39;s perfectly alright<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; solve the problem by myself, in the sense of efficiency and<br/>\n&gt; effectiveness.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  We all start as a newbie w/o helps, we learn thing the hard way.  As<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; UO, every hunting trips as a newbie, I walk with my kakis from town to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dungeon, back to town b4 the last save.  When we all reach tank-mage<br/>\n&gt; stage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and we start helping newbie members to mark rune, to gate them here<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there.  So much so tat in the end they dun even know how to walk from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dungeon to town if they get killed as a lvl 8 caster and no member<br/>\n&gt; online<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ;)  Just to share my personal experience.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. i also suggest someone to be in-charge of hunts and stuff (one of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; officers, thats i propose Ziltus and one other person).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, gotta turn down this job abt hunting and stuffs.  I dun mind<br/>\n&gt; doing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some recruiting job, PROVIDED I am available to do the recruiting,<br/>\n&gt; since<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wiz has the advantage of travelling spells.  H/w, UO event organiser<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enuff for me.  During my time as a GM, I hold more events than the<br/>\n&gt; total<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; events organised by the rest of the guild.  Now for EQ, I dun mind<br/>\n&gt; doing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; part-time, esp during this transition period when QHD dun have much<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; activities, but I guess I wont wanna be the official person in charge,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; heh,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thx for the nomination tho&#39; ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. As for banking and equipment, i propsed those 2 person, instead<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; using their banks, get them to create a char just for the purpose of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; banking. So it will be easier for them to keep track of money and<br/>\nstuff<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; those money is not to be abused. We can have a store of items and LOAN<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to members in the guild (e.g., RTS and other stuff), when these<br/>\nmembers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; capable of geting one, they will return it or pass it to another<br/>\nmember<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; requiring it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Loaning items is abit difficult in EQ, due to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Not easy to meet to borrow and return stuffs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Loading a char in EQ can be quite time consuming, unlike UO.  So if<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person in charge need to logout and relogin the storeman char, it will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; post<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some kinda inconveniences for the player.  Due to the limited items<br/>\n&gt; slot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; EQ (unlike UO where only wt limit), it&#39;s not easy to keep stuffs too,<br/>\n&gt; esp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lore item like RTS, u can only keep 1 per char.  I think it will be<br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; effective for higher lvl to help lower lvl to get some cool items once<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; while, and provided the lower lvl can physically participate the<br/>\n&gt; hunting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (and not turning it to a corpse looting session).  Of coz, for those<br/>\n&gt; lower<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lvl, dun expect to get something more than 5 lvls than u la.  If a lvl<br/>\n&gt; 1<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wanna get JBoot, I think even if u got a lvl 50 wiz with u, it&#39;s also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; difficult for him to even bring u to see Najena.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NOTE: i have a slightly crazy idea bout something. Instead of<br/>\n&gt; creating<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one guild, we will form 2 guilds. one for lower levels, one higher.<br/>\nAll<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; low level chars will form one and high level another. maybe level 1-20<br/>\n&gt; one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guild, 20 upwards another (or maybe even make it level 30). This way,<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can recruit newbies and train them the way of our guild. if our guild<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; active all the time and is nice to all of the folks, i dont believe<br/>\n&gt; there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is any reason for them to quit the guild. That will continue to point<br/>\n&gt; 4.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm, pardon me, I dun see the need to create 2 guilds, since we dun<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; start a warfare sub-division like in UO for guild war (to protect<br/>\nthose<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; non-war chars).  Actually it shld be alright to have all lvl in the<br/>\n&gt; guild.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Plus the fact tat with our own kakis, we dun have to hide where we r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hunting.  As long as u got the lvl requirement for hunt, u are most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; welcome<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to join us (which mean we must have strict recruitment to get only<br/>\n&gt; those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trust-worthy and loyal kakis la).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. We will help lower levels folks to break spwan and stuff BUT it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesnt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mean helping them to kill all the stuff and let them loot for many<br/>\nmany<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hours. Crap stuff like RTS i say it doesnt hurt to let most members<br/>\n&gt; have,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BUT if we are talking bout FBRs or more useful items as we gain more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; power,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then that we must state a certain level or unless they can get it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves (usually this is a few levels b4 they can get it<br/>\n&gt; themselves).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tat&#39;s why I organise the RTS hunt and limit the hunt to those above<br/>\nlvl<br/>\n&gt; 12<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  ;)  Problem is, in order to prevent camping, EQ is patched anti-camp.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  During the last trip, we camp for 2 hrs or so (?) and not even a RTS<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; skull.  YY mentioned webclaw spaw at 10 min interval, which sound very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tempting for me to get it, hehe.  Kellendil also got a WCS liao, maybe<br/>\n&gt; u<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can share with us how u got it (how u kill it, melee, nuke or wat),<br/>\n&gt; where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (which part of Lake)?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. i have also by chance came to talk to the guildmaster of<br/>\nDisciples<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Discord. All members are red (PvP). So if any members decided to be<br/>\n&gt; funny<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  with the guild or spoil the reputation of the guild then they will be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hunted down for the rest of their fucking EQ lives That i believe is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat good protection, but it requires members to be PvP and<br/>\n&gt; ourselves<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be also which is a bad thing or good thing. IF ANY MEMBERS CREATE<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; TROUBLE FOR THE GUILD, THEY ARE BANNED FROM THE GUILD. NOT REMOVED.so<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wont have their other chars pretend and join our guild again and get<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cheat the guild and stuff.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My stand is to remain non-PvP, even until I reach lvl 50 ;)<br/>\nPersonally<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dun really enjoy PvP all time, but some duels here and there shld be<br/>\nok<br/>\n&gt; ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. we certainly dont want war with other guilds. if we dont steal<br/>\n&gt; kills<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and stuff i dont forsee a guildwar happening.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Too many stealers in EQ, and so far I havent heard any war starts due<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kill stealing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Make it unique, maybe someone that wants to be officer or elder<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; watever u call that, he must be highly nominated by 2/3 of the elder/<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; officer council OR he can gain it by challenging one to a duel and WIN<br/>\n&gt; IT.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =) some pvp action. if the guild gets large enough, we can have some<br/>\n&gt; sort<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of arena fights n stuff.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm, lvls or PvP capablity shldnt be the factor used to determine<br/>\n&gt; officer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; post.  No use asking a lvl 50 wiz who win the duel for the position,<br/>\ngo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; making havoc and spoil guild reputation until we dismiss him - damange<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; already  done to our reputation.  Instead, leadership, commitment,<br/>\n&gt; loyalty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and contribution shld be looked into when determining the officer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; candidates.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8. ok i said enough, now bloody feedback for all i have said...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p/s: cant imagine i went on a camping trip and gain one level =) and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; found some true friends and jerks...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just like tax and death in RL, you see friends and jerks everywhere in<br/>\n&gt; EQ<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Transfer your big list to ONElist and earn $500!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For program details, go to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congrats to our GROW TO GIVE winners, ZENtertainment & ROTInews!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out ONElist&#39;s latest program, FRIENDS & FAMILY.
