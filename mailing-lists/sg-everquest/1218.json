Leshrec also contribute his part by accidentally steal from Voy :) Since the anti-camp thingy, stealing is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1501576553\">Sereph contribute his part in complain to Wylven.  Leshrec also contribute <br/>\nhis part by &#39;accidentally&#39; steal from Voy :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the anti-camp thingy, stealing is becoming a trend - and sad to say, <br/>\nit&#39;s mostly the case of a caster stealing from melee.  As for high lvl win <br/>\nthe kill from low lvl, I have nothing to say.  Afterall it&#39;s a fair game <br/>\nand the high lvl dun owe the low lvl anything tat they have to give up <br/>\ntheir chance in getting special artifacts.  H/w, I&#39;m very against stealing <br/>\neven thou&#39; I myself got capability to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;ve mentioned earlier, Wylven has stated his point in giving Voy a <br/>\nchance to turn over, but Wylven himself is not clear as to what &#39;changes&#39; <br/>\nhe expected from Voy:<br/>\n- No more stealing from guildmates but ok to steal from others, OR<br/>\n- No stealing from anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy stand is very clear, if stealing from others is allowed in the guild, I <br/>\nquit.  It doesn&#39;t matter if any guild member dun steal from other members, <br/>\nthe key factor here is stealing, regardless of stealing from who.  Even <br/>\nthou I&#39;m always anon (easier for me to teach the cry babes and stealer a <br/>\nlesson w/o giving any trouble to the guild), I&#39;ll feel shameful if I walk <br/>\npass and pple starting throwing comments like &quot;here come another stealers <br/>\nfrom Qui Hoon Dai...&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for cry babes like Amii, I raise both my hands and legs with Yiyang - to <br/>\ntrain them, steal from them (since they accused us for stealing, so why not <br/>\nsatisfy her &#39;needs&#39;? hehe), and make their life like hell.    Btw I noticed <br/>\nu DO can block pple when they trying to zone pass a narrow passage.  A week <br/>\nago there is this stealer name Senear at HH who keep stealing kill.  What <br/>\nmy group did is to block at the HH pass.  When there is a train after him, <br/>\nhe cant run to zone and was beaten till death, hahaha.  Then we start to <br/>\nwipe all the mobs.  Later this Senear comes back, he looted his corpse and <br/>\nwent off, heh.  This way does not work 100% - depending on ya blocking <br/>\npositions.  If someone try to block u, u can run pass them using the jump <br/>\nfeatures - but it&#39;ll still hinder ya running speed by a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve nothing against Qui Hoon Dai except this CB Voy.  So far I only hunt <br/>\nwith those pple I knew b4 they join the guild, like Ling, Megu, Sat, FF, DF <br/>\netc, and local kakis.  One exception is Demitry, which I only know him <br/>\nafter joining the guild.  Frankly speaking I found our kakis occupying the <br/>\nmedium and high lvls in the guild.  If Wylven remain silent on Voy&#39;s <br/>\nbehaviour I&#39;ll support a new local guild, and I contribute 1 pp more than <br/>\nYY, ie 2pp,. heheh.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus (still w/o a 2nd name).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wednesday, 14 July, 1999 12:42 PM, Alex [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leealex@...\">leealex@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Alex&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leealex@...\">leealex@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess most of u know my stand on steal killin.
