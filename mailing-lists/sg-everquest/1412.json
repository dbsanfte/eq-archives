She got some <br/>\nkakis guarding here, Necro or Mage and each of them have a pet.So makes a <br/>\ngrand total of abt. 5-7 MOBs in total. Plus, last I heard, she can cast and <br/>\nmelee also, plus she can HarmTouch ppl. Sometimes she can do up to 4-7 HT in <br/>\na round alone, but rare lar. Average is abt. 2-3. Want to kill her better <br/>\nget some REAL serious firepower to kill her hor, HP wise is around <br/>\n2000-2500(estimate). Expect to lose a few ppl. in fighting her, her HT kicks <br/>\nsome serious butt.<br/>\nThe Oracle in OOT is around 34-36. Don&#39;t think of soloing him, he got <br/>\nsomeone protecting him one, abt. 30-31 level guy. Small fries I don&#39;t know, <br/>\nbut I think a few level 20ish MOB around the oracle also.<br/>\nFBR is a rare drop on Najena(I think) So hunting J.Boots that time also can <br/>\nhunt for FBR.<br/>\nStaff of Observer? A rare spawn EvilEye in the King&#39;s room in RunnyEye has <br/>\nit on him occasionally. He can charm, summon pet and get all his Goblins <br/>\nkakis to help him kill you. Level around low 30s. Not sure, but don&#39;t think <br/>\nof soloing him.<br/>\nThis one is rumor, there is another way of getting StaffofObserver. Go to <br/>\nPaw underwater room. Kill the HighShaman there and wait for the Drow Nixx to <br/>\nspawn. If you see the Drow wearing a staff, if may be StaffofObserver. Just <br/>\nrumor only hor, try if you have the time. DrowNixx is around 20-24 in level <br/>\nand he got some bitching Rune 2 or 3 protecting him. I tried to kill it at <br/>\n18 with 3 others. All end up Gating out :p</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
