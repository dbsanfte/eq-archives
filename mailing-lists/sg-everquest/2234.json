Somethings i really got<br/>\n&gt; to say. The lower levels for wizard is hard and necro is much easy<br/>\n&gt; during those levels since root get resisted alot and wizards heavily<br/>\n&gt; rely on tanks for support. However, wizard down its target real fast<br/>\n&gt; after level 8. Imagine i kill dw snakes and wisp at level 9-10 when my<br/>\n&gt; necro cant do that until level 12 then i stand half a chance.Another<br/>\n&gt; thing, with my dark elf wizard being agnostic, i start with dubious to<br/>\n&gt; most good people (yes include freeport) and i was told that the<br/>\n&gt; faction can be improved to a extend that i can trade in freeport n use<br/>\n&gt; the bank (BUT i dont its impossible in fay since elves really hate<br/>\n&gt; dark elves). Also, i spoken to a few, alot of high level folks<br/>\n&gt; restarting in this server - couple of level 40-50s. So far the highest<br/>\n&gt; i have seen is level 21 by today!Thast all for now, will keep u guys<br/>\n&gt; updated. hehee.. FreedDark Elf Wizard in his 10th evil years (The<br/>\n&gt; Tribunal)p/s : anyone want to join me when you are bored? main reason<br/>\n&gt; im here bcos Innoruuk is all screwed and at least it wont for this for<br/>\n&gt; quite some<br/>\n&gt; time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; SC Cheng, Freddy<br/>\n&gt; Mobile-Internet Laboratory, Multimedia Laboratory,<br/>\n&gt; NTT DoCoMo R&D Center S103,<br/>\n&gt; 3-5, Hikari no Oka, Yokosuka-Shi,<br/>\n&gt; Kanagawa, 239-8536, Japan<br/>\n&gt; Tel : +81 468-40-3497<br/>\n&gt; Fax: +81 468-40-3788<br/>\n&gt; Email : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
