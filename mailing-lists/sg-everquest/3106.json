The boy died. <br>\n<br>\nOn Tuesday, Bragg, 24, pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter and was\nsentenced to 15 years in prison. <br>\nBragg had been playing the online fantasy role-playing computer game for\nhours and appeared to get annoyed by his son&#39;s crying, said prosecutor\nSuzanne Rossomondo. <br>\n<br>\nBragg discovered his son by his playpen at least 24 hours after the child\ndied. The infant&#39;s heart had been punctured, causing him to bleed to\ndeath. His ribs and left collarbone were fractured. <br>\n<br>\nProsecutors originally charged Bragg with first-degree murder, but\naccepted his guilty plea to the lesser charge because they did not\nbelieve he intended to kill his son. &quot;I think it was a horrible case\nof neglect,&quot; Rossomondo said. <br>\nCircuit Judge Rex Barbas added five years&#39; probation to the end of\nBragg&#39;s prison sentence. <br>\n<br>\nBragg&#39;s former wife, Brandy L. Rozier, left their son with Bragg after\nshe lost electricity at her home. She also dropped off Bragg&#39;s 4-year-old\nstepson. <br>\n<br>\nBragg kept his 9-month-old in a playpen in a 4- by 8-foot utility closet\nthat contained the air conditioner and heater. Authorities found pizza in\nthe kitchen, but an associate medical examiner said the infant was\nundernourished. <br>\nBragg originally said he was carrying his son when the child&#39;s head,\nchest and shoulder slammed into a door frame. <br>\nBefore he was supposed to drop off his son at a relative&#39;s home, Bragg\nnoticed his son was not breathing. He called 911. <br>\nThe boy&#39;s mother, who is separated from Bragg, has two other children.\nBoth are in state custody. <br>\nRossomondo said she told the child&#39;s mother about the plea deal.\n&quot;She was very happy about it,&quot; Rossomondo said. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n- David Karp can be reached at (813) 226-3376 or\n<font color=\"#0000FF\"><u>karp@...</u></font>. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n====================================================================================<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTHIS PART QUOTED FROM\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stratics.com/content/thundolfe/barnyard.shtml\">http://www.stratics.com/content/thundolfe/barnyard.shtml</a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI play EverQuest, therefore I am going straight to Hell (I have to kill\nsomeone first, though, hang on) <br>\nWednesday, January 3, 2001 - 2:01 PM EST Just when you thought it was\nsafe to have some fun. Bleh.<br>\n<br>\nThe <font color=\"#0000FF\"><u>St. Petersburg Times</u></font> is reporting\nthat Tony Bragg, 24, has been sentenced to <font color=\"#0000FF\"><u>15\nyears in prison</u></font> for the murder of his 9-month-old son. Since\nthis is an MMOG - related website (Your Massively Multiplayer Network!),\nyou&#39;ve probably guessed that it has to be tied in here somewhere,\nright?<br>\n<br>\nSadly, yes. From the <font color=\"#0000FF\"><u>article</u></font>:<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTAMPA -- As his 9-month-old son cried last July, Tony Lamont Bragg Sr.&#39;s\nmind was on something else: a computer game called\n<font color=\"#0000FF\"><b><u>Everquest</u></b></font>.<br>\n<br>\nAuthorities believe Bragg squeezed Tony Jr. to keep him quiet, then left\nhim unattended in a utility closet in their Temple Terrace apartment for\nmore than 24 hours. The boy died.<br>\n<br>\nBragg had been playing the online fantasy role-playing computer game for\nhours and appeared to get annoyed by his son&#39;s crying.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou know, I&#39;m not here to scold the father because he put a video game\nabove his child as much as I&#39;m concerned that video games are gonna be\nscapegoated again. I think everyone can think of choice words for him in\nregards to what he did (&quot;HELLO. YOU&#39;RE A GOD DAMN IDIOT.&quot;).\nWhat I&#39;m most upset about is people are not going to focus on the fact\nthat someone <b>KILLED THEIR OWN KID</b>, but that there was a certain\n<font color=\"#0000FF\"><u>video game</u></font> involved. And, of course,\nwe all know that <font color=\"#0000FF\"><u>Dungeons and Dragons is\nevil</u></font>.<br>\n<br>\nD&amp;D has become the scapegoat of suicides, murders, rapings, Mickey\nMouse sightings, depression, and any other number of various childhood\nincidents. <font color=\"#0000FF\"><u>Articles abound</u></font> from\nfanatics that claim that these games <font color=\"#0000FF\"><u>are\nevil</u></font>.<br>\n<br>\nStratics writer <font color=\"#0000FF\"><u>Darien Kane</u></font> recently\npublished an outstanding essay on <font color=\"#0000FF\"><u>this very\ntopic</u></font>:<br>\n<br>\n From then on, all kinds of &#39;renowned&#39; authors started attacking RPGs,\nmainly poor Dungeons and Dragons. <b><i>&#39;The Truth about Dungeons and\nDragons&#39;</i></b>, by a lady called Joan Hake Robie, attains a level of\nintellect matched only once in history when OSI decided to implement Stat\nLoss in Ultima Online. The author writes: <b><i>&quot;Dungeons and\nDragons is not a game. Some believe it to be a teaching [sic] the\nfollowing:&quot;</i></b>. She then lists 22 activities, including\nblasphemy, assassination, insanity, sexual perversion, homosexuality,\nprostitution, Satan worship, and necromancy.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWell, you know what? I&#39;m sick of that crap. <br>\n<br>\nI play EverQuest. Guess what! I:<br>\n<br>\n<font face=\"Symbol\">┬À &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> Am\nnot Christian.<br>\n<font face=\"Symbol\">┬À &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> Am\nsocially active.<br>\n<font face=\"Symbol\">┬À &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> Am\nresponsible for my well-being.<br>\n<font face=\"Symbol\">┬À &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> Am\nnot going to Hell.<br>\n<font face=\"Symbol\">┬À &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> Okay\nmaybe I am going to Hell, but for different reasons.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe fact is is that video games, movies, and other products of the\nentertainment industry have fast become the best excuse for parents who\ndon&#39;t feel like keeping an eye on what their kids are doing. It&#39;s quite\neasy to place blame on EverQuest and such just because you don&#39;t feel\nlike rocking your damn baby to sleep. There are games out there that\nmight not be appropriate, sure. But it is NOT THE GOVERNMENT&#39;S JOB to\nkeep an eye on your kids. That&#39;s YOUR responsibility.<br>\n<br>\nHell, the issue here isn&#39;t games at all. You can make all sorts of new\nsentences out of that newspaper article. For example:<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAs his 9-month-old son cried last July, Tony Lamont Bragg Sr.&#39;s mind was\non something else: his last OTB bet.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nor<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAs his 9-month-old son cried last July, Tony Lamont Bragg Sr.&#39;s mind was\non something else: where his next hit of heroin was coming from.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nor<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAs his 9-month-old son cried last July, Tony Lamont Bragg Sr.&#39;s mind was\non something else: the mutant space-donkey from the planet Zanzabar\nthat&#39;s bearing his illegitimate child.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOr insert your favorite misdemeanor. It doesn&#39;t matter.<br>\n<br>\nIf you don&#39;t want your children to play video games, that&#39;s fine. I\nassure you that game developers want the best for your kids. Conversely,\nyou should *probably* (note sarcasm) take care of your baby first before\nyou settle down for some D&amp;D action. One of my guildmembers has a\n9-month old son. He has cut back on his playtime drastically because he\nrealizes that THE KID COMES FIRST. We miss him, sure. But we&#39;re equally\nglad that he realizes what his priorities are. Another of my dear friends\nis an EQ addict, MARRIED to one, yet still finds the time to raise a 12\nyear old son and a 10 year old daughter, both wonderfully healthy and\nhappy.<br>\n<br>\nYou shouldn&#39;t blame the game. It&#39;s not the game&#39;s fault. Suck it up and\ntake some damn responsibility.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNecroGod, of the <font color=\"#0000FF\"><u>EQSS Westwood Tavern</u></font>\n(you can find a busy thread about this topic\n<font color=\"#0000FF\"><u>here</u></font>) says it quite nicely.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe mother is <b>FRIGGIN HAPPY</b> that he got a lesser sentence! <b>WAKE\nUP BITCH, YOUR SON IS DEAD, MURDERED BY HIS FATHER!</b> In my opinion,\nshe should join him in prison.<br>\n<br>\nThis is also yet ANOTHER example of not pinning the blame where blame is\ndue. The very first line of the article plainly sets the scene that it\nwas the father&#39;s involvement in EQ that made him kill his son, not his\never-present drug problem or mental deficiencies or anything like\nthat.<br>\n<br>\nWhy the hell can&#39;t people take responsibility for their own actions, and\nwhy is the press so afraid to blame somebody directly? Why must it be a\nvideo game that made somebody tweak, or a movie that made somebody freak\nout?<br>\n<br>\nScrew the media, burn the father, bury the mother. All I can picture over\nand over is that poor, innocent child alone and lost inside a CLOSET\nwhile he bled to death.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAmen.<br>\n<br>\nI think my feelings are best summed up by this Usenet post:<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n...D&amp;D is not to blame for the problems with youth, as well as video\ngames. It is honestly the parents&#39; fault, and you all are too damn\ndelusional to deal with the fact that maybe you aren&#39;t the biblical,\nsaintly parents you think youselves to be. Get a life and deal with your\nown problems. It&#39;s your fault, not the video games, music or Dungeons and\nDragons or other such RPG. Learn about something before you go judging\nit. Thank you for your time and please go to hell.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMaybe, Mr. Bragg, you should have held off on camping that Ghoul Lord and\nLEARNED HOW TO BE A PARENT FIRST.<br>\n<br>\nQuit giving people who play these games a bad name.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Update:</b> <font color=\"#0000FF\"><u>AVault</u></font> updated their\ncoverage with this <font color=\"#0000FF\"><u>story</u></font> that\nminimizes the role, if any, EverQuest played in the homicide. Here&#39;s a\nclip:<br>\n<br>\nEverQuest was merely the preoccupation of the moment for Bragg, Littman\nadded, saying it could have just have easily been televised football or\nany other occupation of men in their twenties, instead. &quot;Bragg is\nsadly typical of many young people today,&quot; said Littman. &quot;He\nhad children before he was ready to take care of them.&quot;<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWhile I&#39;m glad that both sides realize the game really wasn&#39;t a factor, I\nstand by my original point. Disclaimer or not, this is simply more fuel\nfor the fire for right-wing groups that claim D&amp;D-type games are a\ncause of this type of behavior.<br>\n<br>\n<font color=\"#0000FF\"><u>Lum writes a fantastic piece</u></font> on this\nsubject as well. - <font color=\"#0000FF\"><u>Thundolfe<br>\n<br>\n</u></font></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
