He can&#39;t fight <br/>\nhis way as a semi tank + healer.  On the other hand, if we r talking abt <br/>\nundead terriority, I think he can fight on par with warrior due to his holy <br/>\nskills ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nTroll dun have cleric btw, only shaman. Talk abt shaman, I think they can <br/>\nfight better than cleric, but their healing abilities is somewhat one step <br/>\nbehind cleric&#39;s.  Comparing cleric and shaman, cleric is better in defend <br/>\n(healing) while the latter is better in offence, both healer/fighters. <br/>\n Troll shaman gain additional edge by regenerating HP, so still can &#39;tong&#39; <br/>\na while.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing abt high lvl cleric (lvl 40 and above), they will be healing 95% <br/>\nof the time.  Kinda boring if u ask me. But they will be forever welcome by <br/>\nall groups.  Esp high lvl cleric can help to train low lvl char by bringing <br/>\nthem to fight high lvl monsters and healing them.  Oh, they are so damn <br/>\nholy - basically serving others more than themselves!  If u know a lvl 40+ <br/>\ncleric who is willing to spend a day with u in high lvl dungeon, I think u <br/>\ncan easily gain 10-20 lvl (someone in Innoruuk ever told me a high lvl <br/>\ncleric help a newbie to gain up to lvl 22 in just 1 day!).<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, u got any high lvl cleric friend to introduce? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMondain<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Monday, June 14, 1999 4:57 PM, Wilson [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ritzbits@...\">ritzbits@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well, Sereph said something about Clerics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are somethings special about Clerics....<br/>\n&gt; a)They tank<br/>\n&gt; b)They stand back and heal<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Its useless to have a Troll Cleric &lt;&lt;RPG sake&gt;&gt; but he tanks.
