I&#39;ve only 15 plat in the bank. My hard earned savings playing in odd hours during the exams. &lt;sob sob&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI managed to get a netted tunic from Mikrin for only 5 gold. Man That guys is an angel, extremely friendly too. He too is a monk of the 6th circle &lt;lvl 6 back then&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much money do you guys make anyways? I can bank in only max 1 plat per hour but that affects my EXP gain very much considering the meagre hours I play...<br/>\n<br/>\nWilson<br/>\n&lt;The Semi-Bruce Lee Fan&gt;<br/>\n&lt;The Ever Newbie&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
