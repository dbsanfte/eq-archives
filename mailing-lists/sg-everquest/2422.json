Weeks ago me went with some guys and we managed <br/>\nto zone in.  Last week I went with Fes/FF/Febon but this time when we try <br/>\nto zone in, it teleport us to somewhere in Lava.  Fes said Sol A mob are <br/>\ndeeper (refer to those tat give us xp), while Sol B mob (blue) are closing <br/>\nto zone, so in a sense safer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsking wiz below 40 to standby for eva means he can&#39;t nuke much.  Eva, <br/>\nthou&#39; take shorter casting time than portal spells, still take longer than <br/>\nnornal gate spells and can easily disturbed.  The only situation I can <br/>\nthink of eva been useful is when the team has at least 1-2 tanks and wiz <br/>\nonly nuke after mob&#39;s HP drop to below 50%, meaning wiz&#39;s nuking will NOT <br/>\ntaunt mob to him/her (wiz heavy nuking outshine all tanks&#39; taunt, and u <br/>\ntanks should be ashame of yaself, hehe).  H/w, most of the time wiz need to <br/>\neva is when a train is activated, and chances it that wiz will have already <br/>\nnuke some mobs and draw them to him/her.  Of coz, wiz can always standby <br/>\nall time to eva (ie once trains come, eva),  but it will be very boring. <br/>\n Worst scenerio I can think of, is when wiz fizzy until he dun have enuff <br/>\nmana to eva and he gate out instead, meaning those tanks who cannot gate <br/>\nout is left to rot, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing for sure, no casters will wanna team with those cowboys (ie those <br/>\npple who are impatient most of the time and wanna chiong all the way, w/o <br/>\ngiving warning msg to those casters who are oom and med).  For this type of <br/>\nteam-mate, I will be the 1st one who gate out - since u never bother abt my <br/>\nsurvival, why shld I? ;)  So if there is any cowboy in this ML, pls ponder <br/>\nabit b4 you complain why no casters wanna team with u.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my saliver already start dropping with so many goodies in Sol A. <br/>\n If we can get 1 or 2 tank, I sure go, since we already got nukers and <br/>\nhealer , heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Monday, 20 September, 1999 6:28 PM, Gary Qui Hong Loong <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Gary Qui Hong Loong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tU know where is Najena rite? It&#39;s on the rite hand side of Lavamnt when<br/>\n&gt; u zone in from the DE newbie hunting grounds. U turn left instead. Then<br/>\n&gt; go until u reach the merchant at the druid stone. then from there head<br/>\n&gt; north and East abit. When u c a goblin camp u&#39;re close alreadi. Sol A<br/>\n&gt; and Sol B entrance is close to each other. Valadine has been to Sol A.<br/>\n&gt; He can bring u there if needed. Btw, go Sol A if u can. They give alot<br/>\n&gt; of good stuff. I can agag bring u ppl around but make sure for a druid<br/>\n&gt; or Wizzie to gate out hor, b&#39;cos there are sooo many secret walls and<br/>\n&gt; stuff. There are certain places I can bring u to b&#39;cos it&#39;s close to the<br/>\n&gt; zone, eg the Foreman Tunic spawn. The goblin capt one is harder b&#39;cos is<br/>\n&gt; deeper and alot of greenie goblins too. It gives the Charred Plate Armor<br/>\n&gt; (Boots and Gloves). Then there is the EXG clockwork (chicken Feed to win<br/>\n&gt; but it hits hard. But me (at lvl 40) and a 34th Ranger just bash it to<br/>\n&gt; death without healing. U just need to make sure u kill it away from the<br/>\n&gt; bridge so that the gnomes don&#39;t help it. EXG gives the Charred Plate<br/>\n&gt; Armor or The Charred Guardian Shield (plus 9 Wis). And at the gnome<br/>\n&gt; castle there is the Dibble (?) give the molten cloak (plus 4 int and<br/>\n&gt; wis). And then there is the little imp called Flint(??). It gives the<br/>\n&gt; imp skin gloves (plus 5int (??)). Then there is a small little drake<br/>\n&gt; called Singe (??). It gives Drakescale Belt (forgot stats alreadi) but<br/>\n&gt; give some dex and agi? or it gives the earring that gives mana and plus<br/>\n&gt; 4int. And then there is the Goblin King that gives a good ring (plus<br/>\n&gt; 4int and 4 Str) and the Scepter that gives wis?.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; LKW wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hmm, for those who stuck at 30s like me, maybe we have to start grping <br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; lower guk or permafrost...I&#39;m not sure if HH warrior & raider still <br/>\n </span></blockquote>give<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; good xp for a grp of lvl 30-35s....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyone got loc of Sol B pls post in ML, thx.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Monday, 20 September, 1999 5:43 PM, Sereph <br/>\n </span></blockquote>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>]<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Sereph &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Garren, thinking of running to Guk to camp for my last 16 levels of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>hell,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; how&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; place?
