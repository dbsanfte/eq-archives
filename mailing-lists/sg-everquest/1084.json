I<br/>\n&gt; am e-mailing to you as well as the newsgroup in one shot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Dexter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dexterw@...\">dexterw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Newsgroups: sg.pacnet.games.discuss,sg.marketplace<br/>\n&gt; Subject: EQ Everquest players pls read<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi to all the Singapore Everquest players. I&#39;ll get straight to the<br/>\n&gt; point :) I wish to compile a list of the Singapore players in EQ.<br/>\n&gt; Why would I wanna do this? Well with this list we can easily know<br/>\n&gt; which server has the most Singaporeans and also for future EQ<br/>\n&gt; players another reason why they should choose a particular server.<br/>\n&gt; Also this allows the already in EQ players a chance to make a new<br/>\n&gt; char on those singaporan populated servers as when we play at<br/>\n&gt; night it&#39;ll be early morning in USA so your friends will not be online<br/>\n&gt; and so you can maybe choose to make a new char in those server<br/>\n&gt; with singaporeans to play with them together. So if you play EQ,<br/>\n&gt; please email me with the main server you play in, as well as the<br/>\n&gt; other servers which you sometimes go to(if any). When I have a list<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll email you back together with the list. Might also be posting the<br/>\n&gt; list to my homepage. Lastly I need a small favour from anyone of<br/>\n&gt; you. I bought EQ on the 1st day it was released in Singapore but I<br/>\n&gt; HAVENT GOT A CHANCE TO PLAY IT YET haha. This is bcos I<br/>\n&gt; dont have a credit card :( . I&#39;ll be able to apply for a card in 2<br/>\n&gt; months time(after my b/day) so in the mean time I wont be able to<br/>\n&gt; play it. So Im hoping if anyone can help me by activating my<br/>\n&gt; account for me. I have registered, but have not bill my account yet.<br/>\n&gt; I hope someone can make a 3 months payment for me. 3<br/>\n&gt; monthscost US$25. I&#39;ll send you S$50, and when you receive the<br/>\n&gt; money, then activate my account for 3 months, and you can keep<br/>\n&gt; the amount thats left, as a token of my appreciation. If you&#39;ll like to<br/>\n&gt; help please state this in your email. Anyway please email me the<br/>\n&gt; server list. Helping or dont help activate my account is another<br/>\n&gt; issue its ok nothing to do with this. I wanted to make a list to<br/>\n&gt; benefit everyone. The account thingy, at most I wait until I apply for<br/>\n&gt; a card :( so pls pls email me with the server list.
