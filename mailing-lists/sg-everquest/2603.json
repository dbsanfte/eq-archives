I chao chao also have endure EQ for nearly<br/>\n2 years now and stil manage to tahan the camping etc..... by NOT camping for<br/>\nitems unless friends are camping or if soloing for XP, spam guildsay or talk<br/>\ncock with other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey way with EQ is as you say level level level then at 50 camp items blah blah<br/>\nblah, but you can do other things like run around the various karana plains and<br/>\nadmire the sight or enter a low level dungeon and help newbies survive, else if<br/>\nyou everday camp item also can go gila.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also do the long boring quest that eq has, heck, if you want to kill<br/>\nLucan, just send a tell and I help take 1 HT from him before dying......<br/>\n<br/>\nElse do the most common thing people do when they are sick of EQ, restart! This<br/>\ntime around, go more slowly, wait for kakis to join up, play a diferent class,<br/>\ngo to other hunting grounds you have never hunt in before. This will make it<br/>\nslightly more enjoyable and is a good chance to meet up with new people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe over level 30 population in Inno is now at at all time low with you<br/>\nleaving....... Once either Zan, FF or Merns leave, I better pack up and zhao as<br/>\nwell.....<br/>\n<br/>\nBottomline, get your arse back into EQ and slave with the rest of us........ and<br/>\nif you do return, don&#39;t play for so long, play for shorter periods and forcus<br/>\nmore of fun and interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nFesse Estasis, Cleric who is working on her KOS faction.<br/>\n<br/>\nGary Qui Hong Loong wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Gary Qui Hong Loong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Gary Qui Hong Loong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kanglun@...\">kanglun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 26, 1999 17:26<br/>\n&gt; Subject: I have quit Everquest<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Dued to my failure at PoF which got alot of ppl into trouble<br/>\n&gt; (which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; involved dying and losing the major portion of their stuff) and with<br/>\n&gt; little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; else to do (except like camping for stuff, which I have gotten very sick<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tired of), I have cancelled my account as from today, Oct 26th 1999. Zand,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; please give out the items to the people as I have listed down with you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Especially Weadaenye, whom I&#39;m guilty as hell to got her into a living<br/>\n&gt; hell.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Please help me tell the follow people of my quiting and hope to<br/>\n&gt; see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them again sometime on another game another time and Best wishes to them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Daedor, Aildiin, Iyenya, Ironbuket, Hoppy, Kitiarra, Stella,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Saintly, Valadine, Millie, Silph, Lunatictiara, Ader, Fost, Sparrow,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Demitry, Wlyven, Anima and Nismo/Volk (they are brothers sharing the same<br/>\n&gt; &gt; account).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Everquest was, had been and enjoyable game at the beginning but<br/>\n&gt; due<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the way that the game is designed it reminds me more of Evercamp,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Everbitch etc etc. It has become a torture to enter the &quot;game&quot; each day<br/>\n&gt; now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This incident has at least freed me from Evercrack as some would say it<br/>\n&gt; is.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So farewell my fellow guildmates.
