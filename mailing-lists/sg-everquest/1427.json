Ever since we play EQ for so long, I bet by now<br/>\n&gt; most of us know what we wanna be, how to train what our char and possess<br/>\n&gt; with, at least, the basic survival knowledge.  Compared to the time when I<br/>\n&gt; start EQ w/o been a beta player, I was wrong at that time when making<br/>\n&gt; certain decisions, particularly how my char is created.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nevertheless, I will stick to Wiz even if we were to shift over to the new<br/>\n&gt; server.  Life is gonna be tough (esp the the begining stage, like wanna<br/>\ndie<br/>\n&gt; cannot die, wanna live cannot live) but if it&#39;s a race war server, that<br/>\n&gt; mean we better select to be under the same team.  With the same team, I<br/>\nbet<br/>\n&gt; it will be much easier for us to hunt together.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m for Erudite Wiz - with max INT pump in.  Life will be harder than a HE<br/>\n&gt; since ER dun have infravision (tried once in Prexus making a ER Wiz and<br/>\n&gt; find it VERY difficult to play w/o light, kena whack up-down-left-right<br/>\n&gt; shortly after I walked out of city).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I leave the decision to the majority and my heart follow the majority.<br/>\nJust<br/>\n&gt; make sure this is the LAST migration, IF we have decided to shift.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Btw, can someone enllighten me on the following:<br/>\n&gt; In normal server, npc only KOS char of different alignment (eg DE kena KOS<br/>\n&gt; in all elfs settlements, human kena KOS in Troll/Ogre territory, BUT human<br/>\n&gt; wont be KOS in elf terrority).  May I know if a char of good race walk<br/>\ninto<br/>\n&gt; the city of ANOTHER TEAM which is ALSO a good race, will the char kena<br/>\nKOS?<br/>\n&gt;  Eg HE and Human are considered good races yet under different team, will<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; human who walk into Felwithe kena KOS by HE npcs?<br/>\n&gt; - If the answer is yes, then evil races will be a good choice, since based<br/>\n&gt; on EQ&#39;Lizer&#39;s article abt race war team comparison, evil races (DE, troll,<br/>\n&gt; Ogre) have some of the best races for most of the classes.  They also have<br/>\n&gt; advantages since they have more access to the better lvling dungeons.<br/>\n&gt; - If the answer is no (ie human char can go to elf shop buying supplies<br/>\nw/o<br/>\n&gt; been KOS), I will go for human, erudite and barbarian, they can lvl<br/>\n&gt; fastest.  Thou life is hard in the begining w/o light, but the reward will<br/>\n&gt; pay off at the later stage.  Erudite makes the most powerful casters at<br/>\n&gt; high lvl, Barbarian make excellent tankers and human is the most flexible<br/>\n&gt; amg all races, plus no xp penalty - see how someone in Inno lvl so damn<br/>\n&gt; fast? hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Tuesday, 27 July, 1999 9:25 PM, Entreri [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi guys,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I propose that we all move to Tallon Zek[PvP Teams].Okay here are my<br/>\n&gt; SUGGESTIONS on why we MIGHT wanna move there.However if there isnt much<br/>\n&gt; support,I will stay in Innoruuk with u guys.All critisims are welcomed!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1.Guild:Okay,lets face it,for normal servers,Guild aint of much fan<br/>\n&gt; except of a tag there.I foresee that if a guild is set up in Tallon Zek,it<br/>\n&gt; would be much more meaningfull in the sense that when everyone has a<br/>\ncommon<br/>\n&gt; goal and at the same time roleplaying WHAT it should be[huh?A paladin and<br/>\n&gt; SK chatting with each other?].Serious roleplaying could be carried to the<br/>\n&gt; fullest and the tension when going over zones which WILL encourage<br/>\ngrouping<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2.New Server.Since its new,it would be nice that there will be players<br/>\n&gt; around to group.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3.MAIN POINT:The tension!This time,you would be much more carefull going<br/>\n&gt; through zones and when buddies come the fullest and where racism too<br/>\n&gt; :).Although all the Singaporean EQ Players would be best if same<br/>\n&gt; group,however we could have some not in this group so they could set up<br/>\n&gt; their own guild and wage war with us which WILL defintely improve the SG<br/>\nEQ<br/>\n&gt; community.If we could not be friends,we could be still foes :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4.ok..high level players..ahem Garren...There seems to be a quest to<br/>\n&gt; switch servers though I do not encourage this coz it would be more fun if<br/>\n&gt; everyone same level.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 5.SG Mauling:heh..Imagine all 35SG players on this list play same group<br/>\n&gt; and have a FULLSCALE invasion on Freeport?hehe...imagine the fun..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 6.The spirit bond BTW on SG players will defintely tighten with this..:)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 7.Makes higher lv SGs get good items for their lower SG counterparts so<br/>\n&gt; our SG strength could be increased.[Note:Coz 300levels4s could maul a<br/>\n&gt; level50?]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 8.We could have serious planning on what class to use so we would not be<br/>\n&gt; as messy as now...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 9.We had PROBABLY wrongly configured our chr in the past so it would be<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; nice change<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 10.SGs players are now split into 2..mainly the highlevels and low<br/>\n&gt; levels..It would be nice if this everyone would be same level again<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thx for reading...just my 2cents<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Entreri<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; ICQ UIN: 2326860<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Previewer, Singularity Gaming Network<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sg-gaming.net\">http://www.sg-gaming.net</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your Single Source of Everything Gaming<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; .plan at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=\">http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &lt;&lt; File: ATT00004.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations DALMATIANRESCUE.
