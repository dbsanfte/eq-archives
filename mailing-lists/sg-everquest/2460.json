Btw, anyone try swiming to OOT b4?  During <br/>\nnewbie time I once crash on boat and fall into OOT, swim to an isle and <br/>\ngate back to GF.  I&#39;m thinking maybe now it&#39;s time I can swim to OOT, if I <br/>\nhappened to kill that npc too much, hehe.<br/>\nI have not travel by boating since lvl 20 liao, hehe....<br/>\nBtw wat&#39;s the lvl of that npc?  I heard it wont affect ya faction with <br/>\ndwarf city, true?<br/>\nU are a druid right?  Can teleport anywhere other then OOT (swim lor).<br/>\n<br/>\nCome to think it, Fes and I used to be so concern abt factions with good <br/>\nnpc, in the end we also killed until KOS by treants.  Compared with those <br/>\nkakis who hunt whole day in HH pass, it&#39;s very hard to reject the <br/>\ntemptation to kill treants, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, 23 September, 1999 3:32 PM, Lim Choong Ee <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:choongee@...\">choongee@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Lim Choong Ee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:choongee@...\">choongee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; yes the dwarf npc good to kill n great loot :p<br/>\n&gt; i once though so too until a point i realised something<br/>\n&gt; n i stop :p u r a wizard u can kill of coz, i&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; ...u see the little dwarf female by the port where people needed to wait<br/>\n&gt; for boat?<br/>\n&gt; kill enough of te dwarf n u never get to boat ride again in bucher:p<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Lim Choong Ee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:choongee@...\">choongee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; one thing, there no way to riase the faction with<br/>\n&gt; this npc dwarf as at moment :p<br/>\n&gt; think twice if u wanna travel to oot via butcher to get<br/>\n&gt; roo :p<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 03:22 PM 9/23/99 +0800, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Finally I found some very good spots to hunt and lvling again, killing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;guards.
