To","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-248705038\">(This e-mail is send to all my UO and EQ kakis, $ingnet Internet Gaming <br/>\nList, SG-EQ Mailing List, UO S&#39;pore Mailing List and SG-Online-RPGers <br/>\nMailing List.  To avoid spamming, I&#39;ve hidden all addressees.  If you are <br/>\nkeen in this project, pls subscribe to SG-Online-RPGers Mailing List below. <br/>\n Before I send out this mail, I&#39;m glad that one of our local ISP game admin <br/>\nhas agreed to help us in promoting the local online RPGers community, and <br/>\nhe does have contacts with many big players in the gaming industry.  His <br/>\nultimate aim is to establish an online RPGing community for asian players. <br/>\n Of coz that will be a later target.  Meanwhile, let&#39;s work amg our own <br/>\nfellow Singaporean players first!!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all,<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter knowing there are over hundred of local players in both EQ and UO, <br/>\nit&#39;s kinda sian to know that we are all split over different shards and <br/>\nservers.  Same thing happening in D2 USwest, USeast and Asia servers. Thus <br/>\nI was thinking, if most, if not all, of the local players all playing in <br/>\nthe same server, even under different guilds/clans (like tDw, TAA and <br/>\nCelestials in UO Baja shard), it&#39;ll be good to have so many of us playing <br/>\ntogether.  We can conduct large-scale events, organize RL gatherings, form <br/>\nalliance, talk-cock-sing-song using Singlish and many other happenings. <br/>\n Most important of all, our local players can take care of one another, <br/>\nshare tips and knowledge etc.  I still missed the days when UO Baja server <br/>\ndown at 3-4am and our gang of UO kakis went Geylang to makan frog leg <br/>\nporride, carrot cake etc and go back home at 5am and continue UOing when <br/>\nthe server is up ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, in order to promote SG online RPGing, I&#39;ve setup a mailing list <br/>\ncalled SG-Online-RPGers at eGroup. To subscribe, simply send a mail to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SG-Online-RPGers-subscribe@egroups.com\">SG-Online-RPGers-subscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this mailing list will help to promote online RPG gaming in <br/>\nSingapore.  Eg, whenever a new player cannot decide which servers to join, <br/>\nhe can find the answer here; or if anyone is aware of any new online RPG, <br/>\npls update everyone on the list, even for beta testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all for the time being, thx folks ;P<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLKW (not related to LKY)<br/>\n(aka Dark Flame in UO Baja)<br/>\n(aka Ziltus Planeswalker in EQ Innorruk)<br/>\n(aka Ziltus in D2 B.net USwest)<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: Appreicate if you can fwd this mail to all your online RPGer friends, <br/>\nthx!!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
