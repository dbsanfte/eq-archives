I&#39;m now camping inside CB (ok, Crushbone, not<br/>\n&gt; ch** by* hor), and will take a boat back to FP either late tonight or<br/>\n&gt; tomorrow.  U can give me a tell if u dunno the way to port. I can bring u<br/>\n&gt; there.  But I guess I can&#39;t bring u along to CB trainer hill coz all orc<br/>\n&gt; cen will attack u on sight.  For Einan I also keep casting invis on him,<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; least he is not tat bad since he can tank quite well and his lvl higher<br/>\n&gt; than yours, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If u prefer to stay in Faydark, u can try to go BB.  There is a place with<br/>\n&gt; few stone blocks, and inside the stone blocks center is a npc merchant.<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;ve been training there since lvl 7 to 9.  The 4 skellies there spawn at<br/>\n&gt; fixed place and will not run ard, so pretty safe for u to kill one by one.<br/>\n&gt;  H/w, the skellies r also lvl 7-9, that mean I have to team with a tank b4<br/>\n&gt; I go there.  For magi, maybe ya pet can help u solo.  Once u get above 9,<br/>\n&gt; try the bandit camp between the highelf and woodelf city.  There r 3<br/>\n&gt; bandits there which r non-agro, but if u attack one, all 3 will come to u.<br/>\n&gt;  U can bring a tank there safer.  Once u get to lvl 10-11, u can try<br/>\nharder<br/>\n&gt; places like mino cave for mino slaves or BB chestboard for skeleton<br/>\n&gt; king/bishop (as a group hor).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Personally I dun advised any caster below lvl 10 to go CB, coz the loot<br/>\n&gt; doesnt justify the trains.  I myself start to go there since lvl 5, and<br/>\n&gt; died until I lost count liao.   Unless u can solo a train of 3-4 orc cen<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; solo an orc leg, dun bother to go there.  Places like bandit camps or BB<br/>\n&gt; skellies can give better loot, better xp and most impt, better SURVIAL ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p/s: Already confirmed with GM that 2nd name must be one word, but can<br/>\n&gt; separate using the &#39; sighn, like Ziltus de&#39;Guailan, not bad right?  Hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p/s2: Ple pray for me to get a SBS for both Einan, Trifrost and myself<br/>\n&gt; tonight.  Heard from Garren now they implement the anti-camp thingy, so<br/>\n&gt; very hard to camp for item. ;(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Thursday, July 01, 1999 10:00 AM, Synzzz [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hannibal@...\">hannibal@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi Again Everyone,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Oh yes...here comes that favourite newbie question....<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I&#39;m currently a Lvl 7 Magician. Any tips on where to go hunting around<br/>\n&gt; this lvl?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I desperately need plats and exp! (think plats come first...). I have<br/>\n&gt; only got about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 5 plats at lvl 7...this is pathetic right?? Have yet to even buy<br/>\n&gt; armor/weapons...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so far all those i use were picked up...yeah..had to scavenge orcs and<br/>\n&gt; pixies... =(<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Of course i&#39;m still on Fawdyer...think I&#39;ll be here awhile more...i even<br/>\n&gt; got killed by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Giant Spiders/Zombies in Lesser Faydark. Think i really need a lvl 8<br/>\npet!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So back to main point...if you guys can make any recommendations...would<br/>\n&gt; be much appreciated!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Preferably an area in Fawdyer first..then more later =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; BTW, I know fishing probably doesn&#39;t even come close to trade skills at<br/>\n&gt; making money...but is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it actually even worth trying for some cash? In Felwithe, one fish can<br/>\n&gt; sell for about 4 silver plus..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so ten is 4 gp. 100 is 4 plats!! Siong man.... Unless got better fishing<br/>\n&gt; ponds? Maybe got those with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stingray or shark? Then BBQ the stingray can charge more right?? *LOL*<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; One last thing...can we actually buy and sell stuff to different towns<br/>\n&gt; and make $$$??<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hope to hear from you guys,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Synzzz aka Zanderion (EQ)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &lt;&lt; File: ATT00000.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Check out this week&#39;s ONElist of the week.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; How is ONElist changing YOUR life?
