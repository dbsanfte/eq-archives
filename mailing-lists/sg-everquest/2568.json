He start the disease 1st, but I get it more serious than he <br/>\n;)<br/>\n<br/>\nJA2 is very very cool.  I&#39;m also looking for Homeworld, heard it&#39;s also <br/>\nvery cool from some UO kakis.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, one way to judge if ya enemies can shoot you is whether they look <br/>\nred/black to you, just like how u decide if u can shoot them.  This is just <br/>\na 70% rough guide, since sometime ya enemies on roof they can see you but <br/>\nnot vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nHey I forget how to climb to roof, can teach me?  During my 1st mission I <br/>\ndid it once, coz one enemy on roof, but later forget how to go abt doing it <br/>\nagain ;)  CGW Nov issue has some good tips on how to rise ya merc&#39;s stats <br/>\nand skills.  Worth take a look.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis weekend I will play Baldur&#39;s gate expansion : Sword Coast while <br/>\nwaiting for the major UO item patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, 14 October, 1999 10:40 AM, Ebon Praetor <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kelc@...\">kelc@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Ebon Praetor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kelc@...\">kelc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From:           \tLKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:        \tRE: [sg-everquest] Guild Matters<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think I&#39;ve stopped playing EQ for almost 2 weeks or more, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; surprisingly I didn&#39;t missed it at all.  ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I login UO once every 2-3 nights, to help my UO guild to settle some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; training and guild matters, I play Jagged Alliance 2 (wow it&#39;s a damn <br/>\n </span></blockquote>cool<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; game, the content is really solid), I watch VCDs etc...I just don&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>missed<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; EQ, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I seem to have got what you&#39;ve got, Ziltus... this &quot;Bored-with-<br/>\n&gt; levelling-and-nothing-much-else-to-do&quot; EQ disease... you pass to<br/>\n&gt; me one isit?! *heh*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I really enjoy JA2 too...
