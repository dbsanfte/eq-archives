Banded is commonly sold at <br/>\n1pp per AC, how abt bronze?  U mentioned abt silvered plate, is it better <br/>\nthan bronze?  U too late liao, the only bronze legging I got is sold to a <br/>\nfriend at 15pp, am I selling too cheap?  It&#39;s from a red gob at flag room, <br/>\none of the worst battle I fought there, with 5 or 6HP left after I killed <br/>\nit with the help of another group.  My very first bronze, knn shld have <br/>\nkeep it as souvenir, hehe.<br/>\nIf I get more, I will reserve for u lor ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best loot I got from soloing is 2pp (the first and last pp loot I got <br/>\nin PF so far) from a normal blue gob, but 95% only got 2-3gp and below.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\nIntend to stay in PF training camp until he can bash SG with Sereph, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tuesday, 20 July, 1999 3:42 PM, Sereph [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Sereph &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Zil, you have any med bronze plate left over?
