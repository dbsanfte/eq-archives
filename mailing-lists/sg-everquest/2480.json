RIP HIM OFF!!!  ASK HIM PAY YOU 1,000PP AS COMPENSATION,<br/>\n&gt;AND PAY ALL IN MAILING LIST 10,000PP EACH  ;P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway all caster kakis who hit lvl 35 hell lvl better camp for jboot now.<br/>\n&gt; It seem like only those higher than lvl 35 will get the quest note.  Those<br/>\n&gt;at 35 (myself) will still get the boot.  Start camping around 6-7pm is a<br/>\n&gt;good time, and give yaself up to next day noon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The reason we MUST get jboot is to lvl beyond hell lvl.  FYI I died 3 times<br/>\n&gt;in a row with half bubb xp and still didnt drop lvl, as compared to drop<br/>\n&gt;more than half bubb at lvl 34.  From this we can see that hell lvl is NOT a<br/>\n&gt;rumor.  Gaining xp at hell lvl is really a pain in the ass, REAL pain!<br/>\n&gt; Solo kiting will become our best choice, which required u to have jboot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wiz w/o jboot can also kite using bond of force (I did it once last night,<br/>\n&gt;forget to turn on my turbo speed, hehe), but if mob resist ya bond spell,<br/>\n&gt;you can be 95% dead meat, unless u can zone out safely.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Actually we can go for red mob (eg spectre) as a 2-3 men grp, but it still<br/>\n&gt;required all to have jboots.  I know it&#39;s boring but trust me, it really<br/>\n&gt;worth it.  Solo kiting a mob 3-4 lvl below u is MUCH safer and better xp<br/>\n&gt;than hunting a white/black mob with a team of 2-3.  Grp kiting a red mob<br/>\n&gt;will take some time to get hold of the coordination, but<br/>\n&gt;I believe it pays.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;No pain no gain, no gain no glory.<br/>\n&gt;Ziltus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;p/s: I&#39;m forever banished from Qeynos region liao.  Now kill treants or<br/>\n&gt;qeynos npc also no faction msg.  My faction already hit the &#39;beyond repair&quot;<br/>\n&gt;stage, hehe.
