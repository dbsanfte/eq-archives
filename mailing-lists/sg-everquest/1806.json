When was the last time, the guild got together<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to do something? It acts more like a glorified shout channel. Also, when<br/>\n&gt;&gt; we are planning kakis only activities and have to resort to guildsay to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; communicate, random goons might join in, and ruin the experience for us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Agree.  Pple like Maquis is so damn ya ya, and seem like he is stealing<br/>\n&gt;kill from some guild members.  Bram for sure hate this guys.  And the local<br/>\n&gt;kakis definitely got more activites organised than the total number of<br/>\n&gt;guild activities held since the guild is formed day one I guess, hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; As a result, I propose that we get this thing together and prepare for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the guild formation by Wednesday.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*Rise his 2 hands, 2 legs and his....*  Pls draft out the guild email and<br/>\n&gt;we all send a copy to EQ (need 10 min to form a guild).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Basically, what I want you to do is answer this question:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Quit QHD and form a local kaki guild, yay or nay?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Then these question if you say yay:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Who should be the goondu in charge?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Not me of coz.  Handling UO guild for more than 1.5 yrs is more than enuff<br/>\n&gt;for me.  Nevertheless I will still support and contribute my assistance to<br/>\n&gt;the GOON-IN-CHARGE. hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Who should be the officals for recruiting?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyone will do, PROVIDED we have a guideline on what players to recruit.<br/>\n&gt; Preferably someone of higher lvls (at least can survive to reach the<br/>\n&gt;candidates and recruit them la.  If died on the way to recruit candidates,<br/>\n&gt;damn no face, hehe).  And I suggest not more than 5 recruiting officers.<br/>\n&gt; Each recruitment MUST be recommended by an exisiting members of membership<br/>\n&gt;not less than 1 week.  No any tom, dick, harry suga suga join the guild and<br/>\n&gt;introduce his big gang of 20 kakis into the guild and mess up the whole<br/>\n&gt;thing.  I hope to see some kinda council formed to make certain kinda major<br/>\n&gt;decisions for the guild, like to approve or not approve certain candidates<br/>\n&gt;as members, mass hunting etc.  It&#39;s always good to have odd numbers of pple<br/>\n&gt;in the council, so when different views arised, majority vote will win.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, simply, my proposal:<br/>\n&gt;- GIC (Goon-In-Charge).  MUST be someone who is DAMN free (look out for<br/>\n&gt;those who can power train several chars in same or diff servers, OR someone<br/>\n&gt;who can play when working).<br/>\n&gt;- Elders council (including GIC to make up odd number of council members so<br/>\n&gt;tat we can vote when different views arise).<br/>\n&gt;- Officers (It may be good idea to make officer from players of all lvls -<br/>\n&gt;eg 10, 20, 30, 40, so tat officers of diff lvls can hunt with the<br/>\n&gt;potiential candidates of relevant lvls to see if they r worthy to join our<br/>\n&gt;guild).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The charter, who is willing to type it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;GIC or the next player who is very free.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Website, for the thousand time, anyone can get one ASAP?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;GIC or the 3rd player who is very free<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Recruting guidlines, think, and give me your opinion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- NO KILL STEALING.  Nuking/Camping is ok thou&#39; ;)  I dun wanna be a<br/>\n&gt;all-times nice guys, true nuetral most of the time.  For the sake of the<br/>\n&gt;guild, at most I can be Neutral Good alignment.<br/>\n&gt;- Willing to commit and stay loyal to the guild.<br/>\n&gt;- Wanna set some minimal lvl for member entry?  Otherwise some lvl 1 newbie<br/>\n&gt;just join us, saying he will stay loyal forever, got protection, training<br/>\n&gt;and stuffs from us and then say bye bye to the guild, simply becoz he has<br/>\n&gt;got what he want from the guild.  How abt someone of min 4th circle (eg lvl<br/>\n&gt;12 for wiz).  4th circle is normally the lvl where a char start to achieve<br/>\n&gt;some &#39;power&#39; for his class.  Just a suggestion ;)<br/>\n&gt;- Team-players.  When grping, dun anyhow loot and stealing loot.  Group<br/>\n&gt;discipline is impt and must be observed all time.<br/>\n&gt;- Helpful to other grp members (not to the extend of baby sitting la)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ziltus Planeswalker<br/>\n&gt;Been busy camping stuffs for my new Druid char over the weekends.  Back to<br/>\n&gt;&#39;normal&#39; now, starting his &quot;hell training&#39; tonight for lvl 30....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
