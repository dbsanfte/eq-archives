Maybe we can consider if msg board can do the job <br/>\nbetter?  Esp a password protected one to prevent other retarded goons <br/>\nanyhow jump in.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. FF got web space, but it&#39;s his personal&#39;s.  I wonder what if we get <br/>\nthose free space from some webspace provider?  Singularity boss Red Dawn <br/>\nalso mentioned a EQ space reserved for us.  I guess we just need to get <br/>\nfrom him.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Appoint one Events Officer for each 10-lvl categories.  At least one lvl <br/>\nguild hunt per fortnight?  Eg Lvl 30-40 Event Officer to organise at least <br/>\n1 lvl 30-40 guild hunt once every 2 weeks.  He can also &#39;arrow&#39; another lvl <br/>\n30-40 kakis to do the organisation once a month (ie 2 events per month, <br/>\nofficer must organise one of the 2 events, the other he can assign other <br/>\nlvl 30-40 kakis to organise).  Best is each one in the lvl category has a <br/>\nchance to organise.  Everyone must contribute mah, right? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Kakis Heritage System<br/>\nIf any kakis found an artifact which he dun bother to sell or none of his <br/>\nchars can use it, he can pass to another kakis who can use it.  Say Garren <br/>\nfound a Thug robe which he or his other chars can&#39;t use, and he dun bother <br/>\nto sell.  In the end he gave to Ziltus.  Later when Ziltus got a Goss robe, <br/>\nhe is NOT supposed to sell the Thug robe for his own benefit.  Instead, he <br/>\npass it to FF.  Now FF got a FBR, he will then pass the Thug robe to the <br/>\nnext kakis who can use it.  This way we can practice kakis heritage system <br/>\nwhich will benefit more kakis.<br/>\n<br/>\nContribution welcome.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
