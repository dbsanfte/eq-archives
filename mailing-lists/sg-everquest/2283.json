To find Najena you can take a right upon<br/>\nentering<br/>\n&gt; lavastorm and follow the mountains. You will see the<br/>\n&gt; Najena ruins in the distance. Najena is a spooky dungeon filled with a<br/>\ngreen<br/>\n&gt; fog throughout.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The entrance area is not too easy you will find greater skeletons and ogre<br/>\n&gt; guards that range in the 15ish level range. Deeper in you will find<br/>\nelements<br/>\n&gt; and tentacle terrors. The first few rooms are the ones most<br/>\n&gt; often occupied by characters level 15-20. There are two other areas in the<br/>\n&gt; dungeon however for characters of higher levels. They must be visited in<br/>\n&gt; order.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The first area is a secret room that will be to the left down on of the<br/>\n&gt; hallways. This room lies behind an illusionary wall that you can walk<br/>\nright<br/>\n&gt; through. From this room you will see two passages. The door to the<br/>\n&gt; left of here leads to some level 20ish skeletons. The passage downstairs<br/>\n&gt; leads to the meat of this portion of the dungeon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You will find many necromancers and ogre&#39;s down in this area. However the<br/>\n&gt; prized opponents in this area are Bonecrusher, the Ogre Captain and the<br/>\nOgre<br/>\n&gt; Officer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bonecrusher is in a room to the left near the bottom of the stairs. He is<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; a room with 2 necromancers. Bonecrusher is a froglock ghoul who is level<br/>\n24.<br/>\n&gt; He is sought after for the magic items that he carries. This<br/>\n&gt; includes flesh rings and barbed leather whips.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To the right of the bottom of the stairs and down a corridor you will find<br/>\n&gt; the captains room. The captain is a level 27ish mob who is quite deadly.<br/>\nHe<br/>\n&gt; is guarded by several ogres including an officer who is in the<br/>\n&gt; level 24-25ish range. The captain carries a key to Rathyl&#39;s room as well<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; the occasional ogre maul or large bronze platemail piece of armor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The keys you get from the monsters in this area will allow you to go to<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; real juicy part of this dungeon: behind the Najena sign. If you continued<br/>\n&gt; straight when entering the dungeon you would undoubtedly<br/>\n&gt; have noticed a Najena sign with some magicians guarding the entrance.<br/>\nBehind<br/>\n&gt; this sign lies the three major spellcasting NPC&#39;s in this zone: Rathyl,<br/>\n&gt; Drelzna and Najena.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; These NPC&#39;s must be visited in that order. Each NPC has the key to the<br/>\nother<br/>\n&gt; ones chamber as well as having a key out of their chamber(to hand out to<br/>\n&gt; party members). The Drelzna and Najena keys are no<br/>\n&gt; rent meaning that if you log out they will dissapear. None of these NPC&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; spawn every time and there is an anti camp radius code implemented so that<br/>\n&gt; you cannot simply camp by their lairs. This can be frustrating<br/>\n&gt; at first but with a little practice you will be able to learn their<br/>\n&gt; patterns.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to get into specifics here as something has to be left to<br/>\n&gt; chance(and it would be hard to describe anyway) so i&#39;m just going to<br/>\nroughly<br/>\n&gt; describe each NPC and an example of what you might find on<br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rathyl is a necromancer who is guarded by several magicians. He is a<br/>\ndeadly<br/>\n&gt; foe even after death as his reincarnation will appear and have to be<br/>\n&gt; destroyed all over again! A typical item you might find from<br/>\n&gt; Rathyl would be a traveller&#39;s backpack.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Drelzna is guarded by 2 necromancers. Both the necromancers as well as<br/>\n&gt; Drelzna can charm. This may be the toughest fight of them all perhaps even<br/>\n&gt; tougher than Najena. One of Drelzna&#39;s prized possessions<br/>\n&gt; is the journeyman boots.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Najena is guarded by a couple of magicians. Najena is perhaps the rarest<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; them all and is the most powerful alone. Drelzna may be a tougher kill but<br/>\n&gt; this is only because of her guards. One of Najena&#39;s prized<br/>\n&gt; possessions is the flowing black robe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Enjoy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; YY<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; btw. get a map.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;* Singapore EQ Mailing List&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thursday, September 02, 1999 10:10 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [sg-everquest] Need info for JBoot camping<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;May I know which mob carry the key to Jboot room?
