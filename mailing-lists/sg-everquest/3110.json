I just come back from a 2 week trips and this thing <br/>\nhappened out of nowhere.  No body wanan tell me what happened (I asked in <br/>\nprivate many times, pple either tell me they dunno or just dun wanna talk <br/>\nabt it), yet I kena screwed for nothing (damn u BB, soemore I&#39;m the 1st on <br/>\nya screw list, hehe).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever happened is over.  What Alex said is true, S&#39;pore is such a small <br/>\nworld, why fight amg ourselves.  That&#39;s the reason why I setup the <br/>\nSG_Online_RPGers mailing list for our local kakis, hopefully we can share <br/>\nMMORPG info and help one another in the game, and hopefully get as many <br/>\nS&#39;porean as possible to join the same server whenever possible.  To <br/>\nsubscribe, pls send an empty mail to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SG-Online-RPGers-subscribe@egroups.com\">SG-Online-RPGers-subscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n(Wowow, thx for the opportunity to advertise my list, muhahahahah!!!)  But <br/>\nI&#39;m telling the truth?  When if all the S&#39;porean players join a server, we <br/>\nare still a minority (just like s&#39;pore on earth, so small), we got more and <br/>\nbetter target out there to fight, why fight mg ourselves???<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway to be frank lah, I hope we dun forget why we setup the guild in the <br/>\n1st place.  Ask yaself, are we closer or further from our initial <br/>\nobjective?  For me, my objective to form a guild is simple: to gather all <br/>\nlocal kakis and help one another, to promote the reputation of S&#39;porean <br/>\nplayers in the server.  Like in UO, there are certain very good <br/>\nKorean/Japan players when the game first started, so when we talked abt <br/>\nthem, we know they are good.  Same here, I really hope that when pple talk <br/>\nof S&#39;porean players one day, they think we are good and reputatable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no right or wrong in this arguement, since I dunno what is wrong <br/>\nand why the damn thing started in the first place (KNN CCB KNS OCBC POSB <br/>\nDBS CPF PCB etc to those who start this thing, get me screwed for nothing <br/>\nand didnt tell me why, LOL).  Either we all forget abt it, let bygones be <br/>\nbegones, be good friends again (well, I&#39;m sure we will meet again in <br/>\nHorizon) or let meet somewhere else in RL and settle everything once and <br/>\nfor all ;)  At least this is better than letting the whole Inno population <br/>\nknow that within a S&#39;porean founded grp, S&#39;poreans fight amg ourselves ;((<br/>\n<br/>\nSOMEONE TELL ME WTF IS HAPPENING???<br/>\n<br/>\nZil.<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: Also, where to read the k-po postings?  Which board? ;P<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 06 January, 2001 7:26 PM, Bobby Tan [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trifrost@...\">trifrost@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hmm my name appeared, i must be getting quite famous<br/>\n&gt; nowsaday :P Must be my manly fragrance, come all and<br/>\n&gt; worship me :P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok just some humor for this tread, dont flame me )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- Alex &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leealex@...\">leealex@...</a>&gt; wrote: &gt; aiya,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We are not 3 yrs old liao.
