Or do your use pets?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm, unlike enchanter, magi and necro, we wiz do not have summoning spells, <br/>\nsigh.  Those spell casters with summoning spells are actually a tank *and* <br/>\na mage, thou they are not tank mage.  On the other hand, our offensive <br/>\nspells are the most damaging amg all spell casters, esp at the higher lvl. <br/>\n Our style is simple - all out offense - not u doom then I die ;)  I read <br/>\nfrom an online guide which said the best defend is offense, afterall, no <br/>\nneed defend if u wipe all ya enemies, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So far I never asked any pple for armor/weap after I died - since they<br/>\n&gt;  doesn&#39;t help much and I&#39;m prepare to die again in the course of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>retrieving<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  my corpse, hehe, so dun waste others&#39; money ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Cool! Same pattern as you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heheh.  On the other hand, I come across few lvl 4-6 players who approach <br/>\nme for stuffs after they died, one time is when I just died 4 times on a <br/>\nstraight row.  Really dunno how these pple play.  If they want good XP, <br/>\nthey must group up so as to take tougher monsters.  Yet they wanan take the <br/>\nrisk of gaining all XP solo, and when they died, they merely go ard asking <br/>\nfor stuff rather than making an effort to find their corpse.  .<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;Aiyo!
