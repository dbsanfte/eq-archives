&gt; Hello all you spoiler people.... this may be the ultimate spoiler: I found<br/>
&gt; this on Allakazam&#39;s Magical Realm... someone wrote in to him with the<br/>
details<br/>
&gt; to the FA quest... even if this is a hoax it sounds really really cool!<br/>
ALSO<br/>
&gt; NOTE: I DIDN&#39;T WRITE THIS... I AM JUST TRANSFERRING WHAT IS WRITTEN ON<br/>
Alla&#39;s<br/>
&gt; site to HERE... now... on with the FA QUEST!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; MAJOR WARNING:  This quest was sent to me unsolicited and has not been<br/>
&gt; verified in any way.  I am printing it belwo exactly<br/>
&gt; as sent to me.  It is either acurate or a very impressive hoax, because<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; detail is amazing and enough of the information<br/>
&gt; corresponds to items and quests which I can verify actually exist to make<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; seem valid.  If you do this, be aware that it will<br/>
&gt; require a huge amount of time to complete as well aas the sacrifice of<br/>
&gt; several highly sought after items such as Soulfire.  The<br/>
&gt; reward is said to be the best sword in the game, which is wielded by<br/>
Aradune<br/>
&gt; yourself.  If you do it all and get nothing, just<br/>
&gt; consider yourself forewarned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The following information is undisclosed. No you did not read it here; you<br/>
&gt; did not read anything at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Below is an account of the steps taken in order to acquire an elusive,<br/>
highly<br/>
&gt; prized sword.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You will require extraordinary faction with the paladins of North<br/>
Freeport,<br/>
&gt; and with the paladins in Erudin. When considering an<br/>
&gt; individual of either faction, &quot;judges you amiably&quot; will not suffice. You<br/>
need<br/>
&gt; to be one step above this, &quot;smiles/considers you<br/>
&gt; kindly/warmly&quot;.   In order to raise faction with the paladins of Erudin,<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; can acquire a quest to gather zombie skins. Slay<br/>
&gt; zombie sailors in Erud&#39;s Crossing, harvest 4 flesh and return them for<br/>
&gt; faction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Part 1:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is a high elf paladin in the Felwithe Paladin guild, in the basement<br/>
&gt; that will reward you for completing the quest of returning<br/>
&gt; Dvinn&#39;s Black Heart to him. There is a hidden quest here that he will not<br/>
&gt; reveal to you unless you take the initiative. Slay Lord<br/>
&gt; Grimrot in South Karana to earn &quot;Lord Grimrot&#39;s Misshapen Heart&quot;. Trade<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; to the paladin and with appropriate faction, he<br/>
&gt; will reveal to you that a former knight one quested after a &quot;sword that<br/>
&gt; purifies evil with fire&quot;. Take the note he gives to you and<br/>
&gt; seek out the Drunk, a high elf, former knight it seems, wandering in<br/>
Greater<br/>
&gt; Faydark. Give him the note, which he reads, but<br/>
&gt; decides not to give his information freely. The Drunk hands you a bottle,<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; two container slot, and requests an unusual drink<br/>
&gt; before he &quot;spills his secrets&quot;.  The first of two drinks is the<br/>
&quot;Tagglefoot<br/>
&gt; Tingle Drink&quot;. This item is sometimes awarded by<br/>
&gt; returning Runnyeye Warbeads to Rivervale in a side quest.  The second<br/>
drink<br/>
&gt; is created through Brewing. Find a craftsman to<br/>
&gt; brew an Ogre Swill. The ingredients for this mix are a malt, yeast,<br/>
froglock<br/>
&gt; meat, and a cask. Combine the two drinks in the<br/>
&gt; bottle, and return this to the Drunk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Part 2:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The drunkard is impressed by the drink and unravels his tale. Apparently<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; once sought a &quot;sword of fire&quot;, but inevitably gave<br/>
&gt; up. He hands you an &quot;Obsidian Key&quot;, and when you check your inventory,<br/>
there<br/>
&gt; is also a &quot;Key Ring&quot; present. He mentions that<br/>
&gt; there are three keys he was after, but does not explain further, nor what<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; purpose of the keys is for.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The second key is the &quot;Shiny Brass Key&quot;. This item is found off the Ghoul<br/>
&gt; Magi in Unrest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The third key is a bit more elusive. In the Abbey of the Muse in Ak&#39;anon,<br/>
&gt; city of gnomes, you will find the cleric AND rogue<br/>
&gt; guilds. The rogue guild is behind an illusionary wall, and behind an<br/>
&gt; additional hidden wall within this complex is a gnome rogue, a<br/>
&gt; master locksmith. Hailing him he talks about a &quot;skeleton key&quot; that is<br/>
rumored<br/>
&gt; to open many kinds of locks. When you ask him<br/>
&gt; about the key, he hints that a rogue carried this key, but drowned long<br/>
ago<br/>
&gt; with a sinking ship.  Venture to the Ocean of Tears.<br/>
&gt; Directly north of the small island with the dinosaur, and slightly to the<br/>
&gt; left (near the isle of aviaks), dive deep under the water and<br/>
&gt; near the bottom is an alcove with a zombie sailor type.  Killing him you<br/>
find<br/>
&gt; find the key on his body, which is actually called the<br/>
&gt; &quot;Mythral Key&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Combine the three keys in the &quot;Key Ring&quot;, a 3 slot container, and create<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &quot;Key Set&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Part 3:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Venture to Erudin, to a chamber in one of the zones that constitutes the<br/>
&gt; city. It is a long hallway with doors on both sides, one set<br/>
&gt; of which leads to the bank. On the wall opposite the side with the &quot;Bank<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; Erudin&quot;, enter the chamber and locate the illusionary<br/>
&gt; wall.  What is surprising about this setup is that the lower half of the<br/>
wall<br/>
&gt; is an illusion and fake, but the upper half is real! If you<br/>
&gt; simply walk into the wall you not be able to pass, but your feet will<br/>
stick<br/>
&gt; through the base of the wall. In order to pass through this<br/>
&gt; obstacle, you must be of gnome size and crouch low, or as of a recent<br/>
patch,<br/>
&gt; have a Shaman cast the spell &quot;Shrink&quot; on you. When<br/>
&gt; you pass through the wall, you will come to a lobby room of sorts, a<br/>
cubical<br/>
&gt; with a door before you. Hold the &quot;Key Set&quot; with the<br/>
&gt; mouse cursor and click on the door. The door will unlock and allow you to<br/>
&gt; enter.  Inside is a study room of sorts, but also a living<br/>
&gt; space and inside a human paladin in chain armor (not plate like the guild<br/>
&gt; knights in Freeport and Qeynos).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hail the man and he mentions two things. He asks for his keys to the<br/>
chamber<br/>
&gt; that he lost (ignore this for now), or you can ask<br/>
&gt; him who he is.  Apparently he is a former knight, seeking sanction in<br/>
Erudin<br/>
&gt; from the oppresive world. He is a bit<br/>
&gt; curious/suspicious of your presence and requests/demands that you prove<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; worth.  He hands you a small bag, with four<br/>
&gt; container slots. The knight says that the &quot;spawn of the burning prince&quot;<br/>
must<br/>
&gt; be stopped, and his skin brought back as proof of<br/>
&gt; his demise. The Burning Prince is the name of Solusek Ro, god of fire, and<br/>
&gt; the spawn is none other than Lord Nagafen.  You are<br/>
&gt; required to obtain not one, but three red dragon scales off the wyrm. &quot;Red<br/>
&gt; Dragon Scales&quot; is a moderately uncommon treasure<br/>
&gt; item on the beast. Zero to as many as three (rarely) can be found on any<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; of his corpses. You will most likely have to slay the<br/>
&gt; dragon three of four times to<br/>
&gt; acquire an adequate supply.  The fourth item to be placed in the bag is a<br/>
&gt; hammer. The reclusive paladin mentions a magic<br/>
&gt; hammer to forge a blade like none other. The hammer he speaks of is the<br/>
&quot;Thex<br/>
&gt; Mallet&quot;, which is involved or referred to in at<br/>
&gt; least two other quests, or can be used as a weapon after obtaining it.  To<br/>
&gt; acquire the Mallet, slay the Elf Skeleton behind the<br/>
&gt; third locked door in Befallen. He drops either the &quot;Head&quot; or &quot;Hilt&quot;, so<br/>
kill<br/>
&gt; the undead several times to get both pieces.  Also on<br/>
&gt; the third floor is Commander Windstream, a level 20 or so zombie. He<br/>
carries<br/>
&gt; the &quot;stem&quot;, a two slot container in which you place<br/>
&gt; both mallet pieces. Combine and create the hammer.  Place the dragon<br/>
scales<br/>
&gt; and mallet into the bag and return to Erudin to the<br/>
&gt; hermit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Part 4:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hand the combined quest items to the knight. When you hail the knight now,<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; does mention &quot;returning his keys&quot;, or &quot;proving<br/>
&gt; your worth&quot;. Instead he presents a different option.  He mentions<br/>
&quot;supplies&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Upon questioning his further, he hands you a piece<br/>
&gt; of paper, a &quot;list&quot; of sorts, with various blacksmithing components noted,<br/>
&gt; such as sheet of metal, ore, etc. Keep the list and gather<br/>
&gt; the blacksmithing craft items. You will need to find a blacksmith to forge<br/>
&gt; you some pieces. It is important to hail him along two<br/>
&gt; different quest lines, in order to obtain both the list, and the backpack<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; combine all the smithing supplies.  (Similar to the Ice<br/>
&gt; Comet quest in which you get both a book and the wheel container, but<br/>
&gt; separately).  Return the backpack to the knight and he<br/>
&gt; will tell you to return at sunrise, in one day&#39;s time. At this point he<br/>
&gt; poofs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Note: The knight will return to the room at 6am. Use the /time command to<br/>
&gt; keep track. However it is important to realize that<br/>
&gt; twenty four hours must have also passed in order for the room to be<br/>
occupied<br/>
&gt; once again.  Example: If you returned the<br/>
&gt; blacksmithing backpack to him at 11pm, he will not be there at 6am because<br/>
&gt; only seven hours passed, so an extra day must pass.<br/>
&gt; However if you return the supplies to him at 5am, you will only have to<br/>
wait<br/>
&gt; 25 hours.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Part 5:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The following morning, the knight will be back in the room, available for<br/>
&gt; passers-by to initiate the quest. Hailing him he requests<br/>
&gt; the return of his keys, or proving your worth, just as before. This time<br/>
&gt; return the keys which you should have kept up until now.<br/>
&gt; He thanks you, and on the side, asks if you have seen his list. You should<br/>
&gt; still have the list of supplies as well. By giving him the<br/>
&gt; list, you open up the next part of the quest.  He says that while you were<br/>
&gt; gone, he had the Deepwater Knights forge a sword in<br/>
&gt; reward for your heroism and courage, using the supplies and magical<br/>
&gt; properties of the dragon scales. That is no doubt where the<br/>
&gt; need for the mallet came into play. In any case, you are awarded a &quot;Forged<br/>
&gt; Deepwater Blade&quot;.  [Forged Deepwater Blade Dmg:<br/>
&gt; 18 Dly: 40 Class: Paladin]  Venture to North Freeport, where the Paladin<br/>
&gt; Guild of the Marr twins can be found. Find the guild<br/>
&gt; master of the guild, the one that a level 1 paladin human would present<br/>
his<br/>
&gt; guild note to. Hailing him will not present any<br/>
&gt; recognition of the journey you have completed so far.   At this point, you<br/>
&gt; must have the &quot;Soulfire&quot;. This holy sword is a<br/>
&gt; prequisite for the last and final phase of this quest. In the trade window<br/>
&gt; with the paladin knight, place both the Soulfire AND the<br/>
&gt; Forged Deepwater Blade. If one OR the other is placed in the window alone,<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; will simply say &quot;thank you&quot;, and your sword will<br/>
&gt; vanish. Killing the knight will not get the sword(s) back from his corpse.<br/>
&gt; You gain experience upon delivering both swords. Your<br/>
&gt; additional reward is a scroll, as the knight speaks of a &quot;flaming sword&quot;<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; champion justice.  The &quot;Forged Deepwater Blade&quot; will<br/>
&gt; be found in your inventory once again (placed their automatically), but<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &quot;Soulfire&quot; is sacrificed at this stage.  Take the blade<br/>
&gt; and the scroll and consult the leader of the Cleric guild in North<br/>
Freeport,<br/>
&gt; the temple of Marr. Hand the sealed scroll (you cannot<br/>
&gt; read its contents) to the guild master, who casts some form of<br/>
blessing/spell<br/>
&gt; upon you. No effect will be readily noticeable, but<br/>
&gt; upon searching your inventory:  The &quot;Forged Deepwater Blade&quot; of the<br/>
Deepwater<br/>
&gt; Knights of Erudin is replaced/transformed<br/>
&gt; into a/the Fiery Avenger.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fiery Avenger<br/>
&gt; Dmg: 33<br/>
&gt; Dly: 33<br/>
&gt; Effect: Combust (182 dmg proc)<br/>
&gt; Class: Paladin<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This sword is not an artifact, but the quest is long and involved,<br/>
demanding<br/>
&gt; the pursuit of not just the deepwater blade, but the<br/>
&gt; Soulfire as well.<br/>
