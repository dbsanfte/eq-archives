&gt; Zil, you have any med bronze plate left over? If have, I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; beg/steal/borrow/murder/chop/plunder/rob/mug/scrifice/castrate someone to get<br/>
&gt; the money to buy it from you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I&#39;m going back to PF this Sunday and stay there till National day. Then<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll go Guk to camp for Slivered plate for Trifrost And Kellindel for a week<br/>
&gt; before going back to PF again to lvl up to 30, then go SG hunting :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sereph, Bard desperate for platemail and more plat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS: Goblins give a hell lot of money to teams. Solo, they don&#39;t give much cash.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Permafrost is quite a nice place for xp and loot (only refers to those<br/>
&gt; &gt; tougher gobs beyond the flag room).  I spend 5 hrs there last night<br/>
&gt; &gt; soloing, and half of the time I&#39;m the only soul in the zone.  If we can<br/>
&gt; &gt; find a full house of lvl 18-22 to camp there, I believe all will lvl pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; fast.  The normal gob, thou mostly green to me, hit pretty hard.  I also<br/>
&gt; &gt; lost count how many times I zone last night, due to train, probably more<br/>
&gt; &gt; than 30 times ;)  The casters give pretty good loot and xp, and some even<br/>
&gt; &gt; drop bronze armors.  Initially we go there as a 3 wiz, 1 magi, 1 bard and 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; shaman team.  Frankly speaking the fire power is pretty strong but down<br/>
&gt; &gt; time is long due to the fact that we have to tank alot and spend time<br/>
&gt; &gt; resting and med.  I believe if we can get 2 real-tanks, life will be much<br/>
&gt; &gt; easier.  The place got a good mixture of melee & caster mobs.  Tanks also<br/>
&gt; &gt; have problem soloing due to the caster mobs.  Last night a lvl 20 shaman<br/>
&gt; &gt; and a lvl 20 warrior come in as a group (the other is a lvl 17 wiz, solo),<br/>
&gt; &gt; they also kena bang out of zone due to those gob diviner, medi and priest.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Those caster mobs&#39; HP is pretty low, can killed them normally within 2-3<br/>
&gt; &gt; casts.  H/w, the tricky part is some of them heal VERY fast and hit VERY<br/>
&gt; &gt; hard (lighting shock ~ 120dam per cast).  If u dun waste them b4 they heal<br/>
&gt; &gt; themselves, u will find yaself in a very tough fight.  Tat&#39;s how the lvl 20<br/>
&gt; &gt; warrior get killed at zone - he thought only 1 gob medi small fry and I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; monitoring the gob medi HP.  I see it drop below 50% 3-4 times and when it<br/>
&gt; &gt; heals, it go back to at least 75%.  In the end the warrior kena whacked<br/>
&gt; &gt; till death.  Another problem that u need a caster in the group is becoz<br/>
&gt; &gt; thos gob are very cunning mobs.  When u hit them to 10-20% hp, they sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; flee into the tunnel, and within 30-60 sec, u will see a train of 3-5 gobs<br/>
&gt; &gt; charging out ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I spend 5 hrs there (until 4am) just to fill up one bubb.  Unless there is<br/>
&gt; &gt; kakis interested to camp there, I will go Lake to fight birdman tonight.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  PF is very wulu wulu (thanks to Sereph&#39;s recommendation), usually not more<br/>
&gt; &gt; than 10 (last night not even 5 during my 5 hrs stay) and it&#39;s really a<br/>
&gt; &gt; power lvling ground for those who can survive.  Sereph said he spend a<br/>
&gt; &gt; month there for his enchanter to gain from lvl 20 to 30, so must be good<br/>
&gt; &gt; lah.  If u guys wanna bash SG like what Sereph&#39;s enchanter is doing, come<br/>
&gt; &gt; join me, hehe.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ziltus<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; p/s:  Unless u go beyond flag room and hunt, otherwise the loot is pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; lousy for those gob outside enar zone.  I earn less than 10pp last night<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a 5 hrs hunt.  HH probably give much better loot but not as good xp for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the lvl 20s.<br/>
