<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150504993">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Not sure which UO shard you played but The Dark Wardens (tDw) is always the <br/>
#2-#4 biggest veteran guild in Baja (check OSI Baja guild list).  Together <br/>
with TTW and DWN, we are always fighting for the #2 biggest.  #1 in Baja is <br/>
Asia, which is made up of several HK/TW guilds.  tDw is one pure guild that <br/>
started off as local guild (formed within 2 weeks after UO launched in <br/>
S&#39;pore) and slowly expanded to the the biggest single international guild <br/>
(includes members from US, HK, Japan, S. Korea, Taiwan, Austrialia, UK, <br/>
etc).  TWW, I think, is also one guild by itself while DWN is form by <br/>
several groups of players to make up the player-run town called Kingdom of <br/>
Dawn.<br/>
<br/>
We are very well established in term of skills and resources (we have 20 <br/>
over guild buildings, including keep, tower, 2-Ss, big brick etc, at one <br/>
time, but reduced after the house patch is in as we do not have so many <br/>
mules to hold the buildings).  Other than GM mage/tank mages in the guild, <br/>
we also have several GM smiths, GM bowyers, GM alchemists, GM scribes, GM <br/>
bards (provokers), GM carpenters/tinkers etc.  We even have GM poisoner <br/>
(assasin) and GM detective, hehe.  As as today, I still have a castle deed, <br/>
a keep deed and a tower deed reserved for future guild village in T2A, not <br/>
to include other 2-S, big brick, big smithy house deeds ;)<br/>
<br/>
We also own one of the most popular shops in Baja, The Asmandi (a big brick <br/>
house within west britain guard zone), which have more than 3000 visitors <br/>
hits, selling only GM suberb stuffs at very reasonable price.  In the shop <br/>
we have standard price list which all vendors owners must comply (imagine <br/>
600gp for full AR30 plate set, all reagents at 1gp above npc shop etc) to <br/>
ensure the best quality stuffs sold as the most reasonable prices.  The <br/>
shop is also well-known for it Charity Chest (a shop wreck metal chest <br/>
locked-down in the shop), where players can leave their unwanted suffs so <br/>
that newbies can find something useful from it.  Pls do not think that the <br/>
chest is a trash bin, as newbies always find goodies inside, including <br/>
magical weapons ;)  I myself can throw 20-30 magical stuffs inside in one <br/>
shot.  The shop also provide free usage of training/thief dummies, forge, <br/>
anvil etc open to all players.<br/>
<br/>
If you play around Baja server down time, often you will see a horde of <br/>
black horsemen in Cov entrance, Britain X-road or Britain cemetry, esp Cov, <br/>
where we rules the place most of the time.  Our guild page is also the <br/>
hosted in Singularity Game site.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanna introduce tDw to more locals players ;)<br/>

<br/>
p/s: tDw is one of the most reputatable ANTIS guilds in Baja.  No noto <br/>
hunting, looting, murdering, stealing is allowed in guild, offenders may <br/>
even face severve punishment of guild KOS.  No tDws will hunt any grey <br/>
players in the game, unless:<br/>
- We know from past experiences that the grey chap is a baddy.<br/>
- We see it with our own eyes that the grey chap has done something bad.<br/>
When we said we are ANTIS, we role-played as one.  ;)<br/>
