<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486053596">Anyone know how many sailing routes in EQ?<br/>
<br/>
There is a boat from BB, and in between the way to FP, there are 3-4 stops <br/>
I guess.  Anyone know what places are those stops?<br/>
<br/>
Is there any sea transport from erudin to freeport?  If yes, is the erudin <br/>
port far (dangerous?) from the erudin city? Thx.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, other than boat, spells, is there any other means to travel between <br/>
different continents (eg natural portal like UO moongate, air ship etc) ?<br/>
