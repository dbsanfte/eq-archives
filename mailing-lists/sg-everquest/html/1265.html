<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623091311">1. Book only contain recipe, and yes, they are only for info purpose. BUT, if<br/>
you have the book, your chance in researching the spell will increase.<br/>
<br/>
2. Buy the research book of your class (don&#39;t ask me for the name, I only know<br/>
enchanter&#39;s stuff) throw in the runes and hit combine. Sacrifice a goat to the<br/>
random number generator and pray that a scroll comes out. (I&#39;ve dump in at<br/>
least 500 plat into research and I still fail at researching lvl 16 spells.<br/>
Grrrrr)<br/>
<br/>
3. Dump 1 point into all 5 magical specialization, then dump one more into the<br/>
one you want to specialize.<br/>
<br/>
4. Cooking<br/>
<br/>
5. You can raise your skills making normal jewelry and can make enchanted<br/>
jewelry by asking an enchanter to enchant the metal for you. BUT enchanters<br/>
have a special class bonus in making enchanted jewelry.<br/>
<br/>
6. There are 2 more than can make money by selling to NPCs. Cooking and<br/>
Pottery. Cooking you do it in Rivervale. Go to the lake there and fish, then<br/>
use the fish to make fish fillets. around 5 gold profit per fillet sold.<br/>
Pottery is a trade skill that I gave up on. Unless you go to Halas, I can&#39;t<br/>
tahan trying to find the bloody merchant that sell firing sheets in e-commons.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. How do I go about researching spells.  Do I really need to buy those<br/>
&gt; books, in the sense that the books are PART of the ingredients in<br/>
&gt; researching spells or they are just for info purpose?  If I can find the<br/>
&gt; info for the spell from internet I dun need those books right?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. How do I go abt DOING spell research.  Say for wiz I got the runes<br/>
&gt; required for a certain spell, how do I go abt &#39;mixing&#39; the runes?  Is there<br/>
&gt; any container I need to find like brewing barrel or forge, put the runes<br/>
&gt; inside and click &#39;COMBINE&#39;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. I heard from Leshrec tat we can now put a point on all specialization of<br/>
&gt; magery skills, ie evoke, adjure, conjure, divin, alter.  That&#39;s what I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; done.  However, out of 5 skills, my main concern is on evoke (afterall I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; a nuker mah).  How to I go abt &#39;specializing&#39; in evoke?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. I intend to go into tailoring skill once I max out my smith.  Can I know<br/>
&gt; other than tailoring skill tat can &#39;mix&#39; with smithing skill, is there any<br/>
&gt; other skills which can work along with smith skill?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5. Is enchanter the only class that can made &#39;enchanted&#39; jewelry?  Say if I<br/>
&gt; train jewelry skills using non-enchanted metal (eg silver), can I rise the<br/>
&gt; jewelcraft skill?  So once I can make a certain jewelry with pretty high<br/>
&gt; successful rate, I can buy those &#39;enchanted&#39; metal from enchanters and make<br/>
&gt; &#39;enchanted&#39; jewelry myself?  OR I must make an enchanters char to make<br/>
&gt; &#39;enchanted&#39; jewelry?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 6. Anyone got any tips on trade skills like tailoring, jewelcrafting, etc?<br/>
&gt;  Particularly those &#39;throw-PP-into-drain-kinda power-training&quot;, hehe.<br/>
