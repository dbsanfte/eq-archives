<br/>
Not necassary have to be a wiz, if u think that only wiz steals , u r wrong.<br/>
All type of Classes steals, from Monk to Shaman(and those not so important<br/>
Classes in between,  8-)  ).<br/>
&quot;U spot a nastis no one is fighting . U r the first and only one fighting it<br/>
now. A spellcaster is invis/sitting pretty  at a safe distance watching u<br/>
fighting alone , U hit and kick and bite and scream at that nasties till its<br/>
down to about 55% HP left on it (U probaly have about 80% hp left).The<br/>
Spellcaster stands up throw a heavy nuke and Kills it on the spot. He hits<br/>
it with 55% damage, u hit only 45%. He gets the loot AND the Xp.U get<br/>
NOTHIN. oh..not really nothing , if u happened to be a tank-monk(VIC -aka<br/>
VERY Important Class) , u get the injuries and the pissed. Tough :P<br/>
<br/>
Even seen a Enchanter &quot;steal&quot;?. He waits till another naties is about.<br/>
&quot;Charm&quot; the nasties u r fighting. The Charmed nasties(the one your WERE<br/>
fighting) turn around and fight the other nasties.  He spellcasted and hit<br/>
the other nasties with the help of the Charmed . ah.. interesting... SUX.<br/>

&gt;Guys,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think it&#39;s very sad that wiz get to steal kills like that. I&#39;m a magi and<br/>
&gt;i&#39;ve yet to encounter it...<br/>
&gt;but i&#39;m not jealous or anything..but i think this really spoils a game when<br/>
&gt;ppl steal kills.<br/>
&gt;I never steal kill even when i&#39;m a sole caster around and can nuke. I mean<br/>
&gt;if everyone<br/>
&gt;could just be nicer...this game would be so much better. Then again..the<br/>
&gt;WORLD would be much<br/>
&gt;better...hehe...guess real life gets into everything *sigh*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just feel kinda demoralised at hearing such stuff about the game.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not very sure on this but can you guys clarify?<br/>
&gt;When you and others attack a mob..the one that gets last kill has what<br/>
&gt;rewards? Loot?<br/>
&gt;I thought that as long as you contribute significant (50%?) of dmg to<br/>
&gt;mob..you get exp too?<br/>
&gt;Maybe someone can explain this to me =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I got alot to find out man...played a few days till now..still blur on<br/>
&gt;several things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;p.s. What is IMHO???? &quot;I Make Huge Oreos&quot;?? &quot;I aM a Horny Ogre&quot;??<br/>

&gt;&gt; It&#39;s very sad to see Trifrost changing sex, ops, I mean changing class,<br/>
&gt;&gt; hehe.  I&#39;ll missed all the good old days of having free SOWing ;)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; From my personal experience, my hardest days as a wiz is between lvl<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve been teaming with a magi and a bard since lvl 8 - Flyingfox and<br/>
&gt;&gt; Deadflower.  DF&#39;s song has save our butts many times but he is now having<br/>
&gt;&gt; his hardest day finding a magical weap to attack mobs tat can only be<br/>
&gt;&gt; hurted by magic means.  His melee is also lossing out when comparing with<br/>
&gt;&gt; paladin/shadowknight/warriors.  For the past 2 night DF has died at least<br/>
&gt;2<br/>
&gt;&gt; times trying to tank in the group. Fox also start to face a hard time<br/>
&gt;&gt; losing kills to those wiz of similar lvl.   According to Sereph, magi<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; On the other hand I feel I&#39;m playing at the peak of my wiz life so far,<br/>
&gt;coz<br/>
&gt;&gt; with the shieldskin, invis and root, I have no problem travelling and<br/>
&gt;&gt; fighting a mob white or sometime yellow to me.  Of coz, I still need a<br/>
&gt;&gt; group for long term survival, but I start to feel the joy of playing as a<br/>
&gt;&gt; wiz.  I remember the days I whine alot of been a weakling wiz during<br/>
&gt;newbie<br/>
&gt;&gt; time coz I&#39;ve so much problem in both soloing and grouping - very often<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;&gt; the first one who died in a group ;)  Now I feel I have to ability to<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; at times when I cant find a good team to join.  (Hopefully I dun have to<br/>
&gt;&gt; whine again at higher lvl, hehe).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I ever mentioned abt an articles I read on UOVault or UOSS abt soloing,<br/>
&gt;&gt; which the author ranking the race/class combo best for soloing in the<br/>
&gt;&gt; following order:<br/>
&gt;&gt; - Troll anything<br/>
&gt;&gt; - Wiz<br/>
&gt;&gt; - Shaman<br/>
&gt;&gt; - Dwarven Cleric<br/>
&gt;&gt; - Monk<br/>
&gt;&gt; He also mentioned monk, been the lowest in soloing order, will ultimately<br/>
&gt;&gt; become the easiest to solo above lvl 30.  Dunno if this is still true,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I just hope wiz remains to be a possible choice for soloing at high lvl.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Last night there is a big stealing party at HH.  90% of the participants<br/>
&gt;&gt; are pure casters, and melee chars all have to stand aside, hehe.  Even<br/>
&gt;&gt; combining Ling (lvl 18 wiz), Fox (lvl 17 magi) and I, we only have a 50%<br/>
&gt;&gt; successful rate in getting a kill (well we are competing with lvl 20s<br/>
&gt;&gt; there).  Frankly speaking if thing con&#39;t to stay on like tat, I would<br/>
&gt;&gt; rather hunt at oasis orc camp, thou the loot is much more lousy and<br/>
&gt;&gt; inconvenient due to the wulu wulu location.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Come to think of it, I dun think TF is taking too long lvling his shaman,<br/>
&gt;&gt; coz he has MIA for quite a while.  If he find it too long, then he shld<br/>
&gt;&gt; compare me and Les - which I&#39;m at one time 6 to 7 lvl lag behind him coz<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;&gt; house shifting - dun forget Les is also training his necro while I only<br/>
&gt;&gt; focusing on 1 char.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; No doubt a magi can solo well, coz he&#39;s like a provisional shop keeper<br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;&gt; most of the stuffs avilable at his summoning.  H/w, I think we have to<br/>
&gt;&gt; consider 2 sides of soloing - roleplaying aspect and realplaying aspect.<br/>
&gt;&gt; As a magi, u can have all the supplies at a wave of ya hand, but when it<br/>
&gt;&gt; come to hunting and lvling, you still need somone to tank, someone to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>nuke<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; for u.  A soloing magi will get no where at high lvl, coz wiz will steal<br/>
&gt;&gt; from u, tankers can last longer than u, and worse, half of ya XP goes to<br/>
&gt;ya<br/>
&gt;&gt; pet!  So I will consider magi a very good choice for roleplaying but not<br/>
&gt;&gt; REALplaying.  I guess necro is a better choice for REALplaying, since<br/>
 </span></blockquote>they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; can dot and drain hp (ie heal).  Magi is next to enchanter when coming to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &#39;group&#39; caster.  I&#39;ve nothing against it, but hope TF can consider the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>l/t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; implication instead of just current situation.  Yes, the 1st lvl 8 I met<br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;&gt; Prexus is a magi and a necro, who guard the Kobold camp whole day with<br/>
&gt;&gt; their pets.  But imagine like a place like HH pass, ya guarding pet only<br/>
&gt;&gt; provide a tank for those nukers - which they use ya pet to tank them<br/>
 </span></blockquote>while<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; they laughing behind, nuking and stealing ya kill.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; EQ is a group game, personally I dun think any of the char I mentioned<br/>
&gt;&gt; above is a good soloing choice.  At most they can only be a good<br/>

&gt;&gt; with others sometime (err who knows?  some gals are in bad mood certain<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; As for the backward trick, it&#39;s not working for casters.  Once we lose a<br/>
&gt;&gt; lvl, we lose the mana, which reduce our casting ability.  Losing a lvl at<br/>
&gt;&gt; those critical lvl where we gain new spells will disable us to cast the<br/>
&gt;new<br/>
&gt;&gt; spells, even if I&#39;ve memo it (already try it, not on purpose but I always<br/>
&gt;&gt; seem to die the moment I gain the lvl to cast new spells, hehe).<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;&gt; been begging around for pple to bring me to Paw, heard too much of the<br/>
&gt;&gt; goodies there, yet fairly safe for group hunting.  I propose we form 2<br/>
&gt;&gt; groups there -the higher lvls protect and help the lower lvls to get some<br/>
&gt;&gt; descent equipments.<br/>
