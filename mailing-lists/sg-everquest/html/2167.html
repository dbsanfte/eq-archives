<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029327420">HH keep give better xp than treant, tested last night.  But treants give <br/>
better loot than HH keep 1st floor.  On the other hand, if u go to war & <br/>
rad room, they drop bronze armor more, so better loot than treants.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I see many DE kena KOS near HH keep, I guess the place is not for evil <br/>
races , unless u got some faction adjustment.  You can easily rise 1 bubb <br/>
in half an hr soloing in 1st floor, from lvl 25-29 (good for magi who has <br/>
pet to tank).  I know pple who rise from lvl 25 to 36 and still training <br/>
hard there, quite a good place for power lvling.<br/>
<br/>
The con system is bugged after lvl 25.  All blues con formidable to me...<br/>
