<b>Subject:</b> EQ Problem after 27/3/01 patch <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998633573">Hi pple, it&#39;s me again.<br/>
<br/>
After getting some advice from the list, I decided to do the most tedious <br/>
thing: plug out all cards except gfx card, and re-insert 1 by 1.  H/w, this <br/>
DOES NOT solve my problem.  In the end everytime I plug in 1 card or change <br/>
1 card slot, I try to login to EQ server.  Finally I see some light but I <br/>
gonna need advice from the hardware experts again.<br/>
<br/>
1. If I only have my gfx card (ie w/o sound & LAN card), I can login EQ <br/>
with no prob at all.<br/>
2. If I insert both gfx and LAN card (for my 2PC network, not for <br/>
connection to SCV), I CAN login when the LAN card is at certain slots.  In <br/>
fact, not much of a big problem which slot I insert my LAN card.<br/>
3. The REAL problem is my sound card.  No matter which slots I tried, or <br/>
which Sound + LAN cards slot combo I tried, I CANNOT login to EQ server.<br/>
<br/>
Very funny right?  WTH a sound card gotta do with logging in EQ?  Other <br/>
than logging to EQ, I dun have any problem accessing internet, d/ling big <br/>
files etc.  If it&#39;s IRQ conflict, it shld be solved when I try switching <br/>
cards right?<br/>
<br/>
Now I need some helps on this:<br/>
Does this mean my sound card is faulty?  I&#39;m using SB Live Player.  I dun <br/>
have any ISA slots, only 5 PCI and 1 AGP slot.  Shld I buy a new PCI sound <br/>
card?  If yes, which card is reliable.  (Funny thing is tat some of my EQ <br/>
kakis is using the same card but dun have this prob).  Previously I never <br/>
got such login problem when I use this sound card for the past yr.  This <br/>
prob only starts with the latest patch ;(<br/>
<br/>
Thx again!<br/>

2 day b4 the patch I encounter one funny problem.  After porting someone<br/>
from Sebilis to DL, I find my char stucked in DL wiz spire.  Stucked in the <br/>
sense that out of the 3 latency figures on my screen, the leftmost figure<br/>
raise to 59,000!  I cannot cast spell, cannot camp, cannot hail etc.  In<br/>
the end I login my friend char using my 2nd PC and look for guide to help<br/>
me by porting me out out DL.  Guide came and port me to GF, where my<br/>
connection goes back to normal.  Guide advise me to delete the DL zone<br/>
files and repatch them, which I did.  But after repatch we do a test again<br/>
by gating to DL, same prob occurred ;(  In the end guide port me back to GF <br/>
and ask me not to port to DL atm until I get technical support.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday after patch, I was asked to re-select my primary display card<br/>
(did all of you get the same thing?).  I only got 1 Hercules GeForce Pro<br/>
DDR DVI, so only 1 choice.  After tat I login my char in Qeynos Hill, blah, <br/>
same latency problem stucked again.  I guess maybe QH files was screwed.<br/>
 So I login another char in GF, no problem.  But the moment I gate to TT<br/>
sebilis orb, dang, the same problem comes again, with the leftmost latency<br/>
figure raise to 50,000++.  I cannot zone into Seb, cannot talk (actually I<br/>
can but those surrounding me can&#39;t hear, same for /gu, I can /gu but my<br/>
guildmates dun hear me).  I do a /q and try agin, same problem.<br/>
<br/>
In the end I backup all the opt files and eqclient.ini, un-install my<br/>
EQ+SoV, re-install and re-patch all.  This time round I got a new problem.<br/>
;(  At the main menu, after I key in my ID and PW, and click the CONNECT<br/>
button, nothing happened for a min or so, then this error msg pops up:<br/>
<br/>
Error 1001: Could not connect to the EverQuest server!  Please try again<br/>
shortly!<br/>
<br/>
I tried and tried for an hour plus, still got same error msg.  I try to use <br/>
my friend&#39;s EQ acct to login, same problem.  I try to use my 2nd PC to<br/>
login (with latest patch but didn&#39;t uninstall/reinstall EQ) both accts,<br/>
same problem.  I try all above after disable my firewall and norton<br/>
anti-virus proetction, same problem.<br/>
<br/>
I check EQ technical support forum, and found alot of pple also got the<br/>
same problem after the latest patch.  Some pple say it&#39;s my ISP (which is<br/>
SCV cable modem), but Leshrec is using the same cable modem yet he dun have <br/>
this prob.<br/>
<br/>
Trifrost do u have this problem?<br/>
<br/>
I try again this morning b4 I go to work, still the same error msg.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can help?<br/>
<br/>
Thx.<br/>
