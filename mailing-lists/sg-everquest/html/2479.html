Anyway all caster kakis who hit lvl 35 hell lvl better camp for jboot now. <br/>
 It seem like only those higher than lvl 35 will get the quest note.  Those <br/>
at 35 (myself) will still get the boot.  Start camping around 6-7pm is a <br/>
good time, and give yaself up to next day noon.<br/>
<br/>
The reason we MUST get jboot is to lvl beyond hell lvl.  FYI I died 3 times <br/>
in a row with half bubb xp and still didnt drop lvl, as compared to drop <br/>
more than half bubb at lvl 34.  From this we can see that hell lvl is NOT a <br/>
rumor.  Gaining xp at hell lvl is really a pain in the ass, REAL pain! <br/>
 Solo kiting will become our best choice, which required u to have jboot.<br/>
<br/>
Wiz w/o jboot can also kite using bond of force (I did it once last night, <br/>
forget to turn on my turbo speed, hehe), but if mob resist ya bond spell, <br/>
you can be 95% dead meat, unless u can zone out safely.<br/>
<br/>
Actually we can go for red mob (eg spectre) as a 2-3 men grp, but it still <br/>
required all to have jboots.  I know it&#39;s boring but trust me, it really <br/>
worth it.  Solo kiting a mob 3-4 lvl below u is MUCH safer and better xp <br/>
than hunting a white/black mob with a team of 2-3.  Grp kiting a red mob <br/>
will take some time to get hold of the coordination, but<br/>
I believe it pays.<br/>
<br/>
No pain no gain, no gain no glory.<br/>

p/s: I&#39;m forever banished from Qeynos region liao.  Now kill treants or <br/>
qeynos npc also no faction msg.  My faction already hit the &#39;beyond repair&quot; <br/>
stage, hehe.  Welcome to hell man!<br/>
