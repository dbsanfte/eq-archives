&gt; Hey Massiah,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dun quit lah.  Keep the account lor.  On and off login and play with us.<br/>
&gt;  Better than quit and later kena attracted to another massive online RPG,<br/>
u<br/>
&gt; know the effect - countless sleepless nights, no day no night no life etc.<br/>
&gt;  At least after playing so long in EQ, kinda immune to the temptation of<br/>
&gt; PLing.  Keep ya acct la.  If grow tired of mage then make a new char like<br/>
&gt; me lor.  Play play other char, or even other sex ;)  I now playing a mage,<br/>
&gt; maybe u can make a wiz lor, we team like the good old days, hehe.   I<br/>
still<br/>
&gt; waiting for ya pet to help my twink get jboot ah ;P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One thing I like abt EQ is tat I can totally forget abt it when I dun feel<br/>
&gt; like playing it.  Unlike UO, I gotta login 1-2 times per week to refresh<br/>
&gt; houses ;(  I also thinking of further study next yr, so very hesitated to<br/>
&gt; pick up new games (if u join the SG-Online-RPGers mailing list, u know<br/>
&gt; there are few very solid massive RPG coming up).  If I stick with EQ<br/>
and/or<br/>
&gt; UO accts, at least the monthly payment will prevent me from forking our<br/>
&gt; more money to play new games, u know lah, married man, gotta think abt<br/>
&gt; family budget, hehe (unless u pple all quit UO/EQ then I will also go<br/>
&gt; over).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Btw Bibi and Zan, still playing D2?  Lesh is also taking exam soon.<br/>
&gt;  Hopefully I can get lvl 51 by the time he come back and we can get 52<br/>
&gt; together.  After tat, we will slow down our pace and spend more time with<br/>
&gt; guild pple.  Expect more taxi in near future ;)<br/>
