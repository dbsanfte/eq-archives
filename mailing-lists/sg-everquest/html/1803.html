&gt; General opinion of our SG kakis, whose names shall be hidden, states<br/>
&gt; that we, want a SG kaki guild, by next week.<br/>
<br/>
YAY!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why? Shouldn&#39;t QHD be enough? Could be the question you are going to<br/>
&gt; throw at me later, and I&#39;ll answer them AGAIN.<br/>
<br/>
YES!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; QHD has several lamers these days, and on top of that, it&#39;s hyper<br/>
&gt; inactive in activities. When was the last time, the guild got together<br/>
&gt; to do something? It acts more like a glorified shout channel. Also, when<br/>
&gt; we are planning kakis only activities and have to resort to guildsay to<br/>
&gt; communicate, random goons might join in, and ruin the experience for us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As a result, I propose that we get this thing together and prepare for<br/>
&gt; the guild formation by Wednesday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Basically, what I want you to do is answer this question:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Quit QHD and form a local kaki guild, yay or nay?<br/>
<br/>
YAY!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then these question if you say yay:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Who should be the goondu in charge?<br/>
<br/>
ANY GOON ALSO CAN AS LONG AS NOT ME!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Who should be the officals for recruiting?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ANY GOONS ALSO CAN... BUT NOT EVERYONE AND I THINK ITS GOOD TO TRY OUT THE<br/>
PERSON HE JOIN&gt; ANY CHANCE OF RUIN THE GUILD NAME HES OUT. NOT CLEAN, HES<br/>
OUT. TALK TOO MUCH, HES OUT.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The charter, who is willing to type it?<br/>
<br/>
THOSE DAMN FREE ONES LOR. WHO ELSE GOT DFAMN HOLIDAYS TO PLAY?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Website, for the thousand time, anyone can get one ASAP?<br/>
<br/>
ERR.. TOT WE HAD ONE WITH  SG  RITE?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Recruting guidlines, think, and give me your opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
SAY ALREADY<br/>
