<b>Subject:</b> Butcher Block quest? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-816081264">Last night when I ventured into Butcher Block with a lvl 9 cleric, we come <br/>
to a small house close to the entrance from GFaydark to Butcher Block. <br/>
 Suddenly one mad dwarf npc chased after me and attacked.  With the help of <br/>
my cleric friend (only heal), I managed to kill the dwarf.  When I loot his <br/>
body, I&#39;m surprised to find a tongue of that npc!  It&#39;s dunno K????&#39;s <br/>
tongue.  When I try to sell it, it says the tongue is a lore item which <br/>
cannot be sold, dropped or trade.  I wonder if anyone can enlighten me on 2 <br/>
points:<br/>
<br/>
1. Why out of so many players near that house, the npc dwarf only attack me <br/>
(and leave my gnome cleric friend alone)?  I dun think the dwarf is a <br/>
spawned monster.  I&#39;m using my high-elf wiz at that time, any factoring <br/>
conflict?<br/>
<br/>
2. Is there any quest or use of that disgusting tongue?<br/>
<br/>
TIA!</div>
