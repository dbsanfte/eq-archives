<b>Subject:</b> Clerics <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141050546">Well, Sereph said something about Clerics.<br/>
<br/>
There are somethings special about Clerics....<br/>
a)They tank<br/>
b)They stand back and heal<br/>
<br/>
Its useless to have a Troll Cleric &lt;&lt;RPG sake&gt;&gt; but he tanks. Rather have a Gnome/Human Cleric that stands back and heal. I&#39;ve had many bad experiences like you guys where your Dear Cleric is trying to tank those Dervs/Crocos. That is complete crap. But of course, you have got to let him take a few go at the monsters if not SI BEI SIAN!<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents...</div>
