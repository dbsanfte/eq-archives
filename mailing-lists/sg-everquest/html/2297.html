<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929633126">trade skill is a joke in EQ... besides jewelcraft... since blacksmithing...<br/>
u can only make banded... is stupid i think... there should be more<br/>
options.. also tailoring... where int he world got a tailor that can make<br/>
leather stuff BUT not cloth? also... the bonding cost so much more... in the<br/>
end tailoring is harder than blacksmithing....in terms of trade skill... i<br/>
think UO did a much much better job... only thing they lack is magical<br/>
items... NOT SAY THEY DONT HAVE.. its just that one wont be willing to<br/>
sacrifice your vanquishing weapon to fight... hehe... at least i wont...<br/>
<br/>
lol... im surprised that vampira still havent got her boots... bcos when i<br/>
was camping... shes also camping for it that time... genreally shes a nice<br/>
lady... she helped us out alot... BTW she wasnt from my guild that time<br/>
(dont know that she came over)... she was from Iron League....<br/>
heres how the pie tin thingy works... the day b4 patch... maybe a pie tin<br/>
cost 1 silver... so i buy alot ... until all my backpacksin the bank n those<br/>
im carrying are full of them... the next day when the patch goes in... each<br/>
now sell for 1 plat (for example)... so u make like 100 times or 1000 times<br/>
the amount u used to have... u think this is fair? worse part... verant did<br/>
nothing about it... tbey claim that they will do something... but i can say<br/>
its almost impossible to trace...<br/>
if u think i got a pet left? fyi... verant is nerfing the pet as well...<br/>
sucks rite? as for life tap line of spells.. they do like half or less the<br/>
damage for the level compared to a wizard... n takes like 3x as long to<br/>
cast... they are certainly not as useful as u imagine it to be... with dex<br/>
of 100... i still get disrupted often....<br/>
<br/>
not sure bout a level 31 wiz hunting 2 treants... since i saw maquis being<br/>
chased n not even able to kill any of em... LOL... anyway... my mind is<br/>
pretty set now to play my wiz till the necro problem is solved... from all<br/>
the mails from GZ (not to me - those i read) and forums theres 3 playable<br/>
class so far... DRUID, SHAMAN, and MAGICIAN... they he considered them<br/>
balanced... not sure bout wiz since i havent read any of em...  the good<br/>
thing bout wiz is all the transport spells... but i think druid is very<br/>
close in fact... could be better than wiz.... oh well... despite all the<br/>
rant... i will still be playing this game... perhaps until my account run<br/>
dry and another better game comes... DIABLO2 in mind... hehe...<br/>
<br/>
Freed<br/>
p/s : i quit UO becos i have achieved all the trade skills n stuff... so<br/>
nothing to look forward to... i guess be the same when u have got level50...<br/>
hopefully a cross between UO (all the trade skills and housing comes to<br/>
mind) and EQ... will be good... ARGH! ENOUGH OF MY RANT...<br/>

&gt; Ah, now I get wat u mean.  U mean the economy is screwed in all older<br/>
&gt; servers, not just Inno ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure abt how the pie tin thingy can earn u 10,000s of pp a night<br/>
&gt; (sure or not?) last time, but talk abt brewing, it really give good money<br/>
&gt; for LOW lvls.  At mid lvl onwards, it will be more fruitful to hunt rather<br/>
&gt; than to trade.  H/w, the joy of trade skills is not only earn money, I<br/>
&gt; personally feel the satisfaction of been a master in some trade skills.<br/>
&gt;  None of my trade skills can give my more than 30pp a night of 4 hrs now,<br/>
&gt; but I&#39;m still willing to max them out when I have the money to spend on<br/>
raw<br/>
&gt; material.  Reason is simply personal satisfaction.  The only regret I have<br/>
&gt; is tat wiz is unable to train in jewel crafting (can make but cant<br/>
enchant)<br/>
&gt; and tinkering.  ;(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for ya remarks....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. EQ is all abt lvl. Quite true, unlike UO we got more things (eg GM<br/>
trade<br/>
&gt; skils, vendor, properties) there.  H/w, there will also be a stage in UO<br/>
&gt; where u achieved everything u want and in the end feel so aimless and<br/>
&gt; boring, just to login every week to refresh houses.  I think Verant<br/>
&gt; initially wanna make lvl so difficult tat it will take a a yr to gain lvl<br/>
&gt; 50 but things just dun turn out that way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. So far enchanter is still making good money, and gnome&#39;s thinkering is<br/>
&gt; still not explored much yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. I think local kakis is lucky in the sense that server is least packed<br/>
&gt; when we play from 7pm to 10pm.  So far my gang camp few days in Najena and<br/>
&gt; only 1 time there is a DE magi b4 us.  Nica u may know her - Vampira, from<br/>
&gt; ya DE guild in Inno.  She is so scare tat she start shouting over the zone<br/>
&gt; b4 we nuke her kills, annoucing all that we are KSers, lol.  She is yellow<br/>
&gt; to me and FF at tat time, who r the highest lvl in the grp - she is damn<br/>
no<br/>
&gt; ball, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. It&#39;s more like a &#39;grass is greener elsewhere&#39; sydrome ;)  Tanks is so<br/>
&gt; much better than casters at early stages, but we still see lots of casters<br/>
&gt; out there ;)  Necro and Magi is so much better than wiz and enchanter in<br/>
&gt; the newbie stage, but we still see tons of wiz and enchanters ard.  Druid<br/>
&gt; is getting dd as powerful as wiz, only 5 lvl behind, not to forget they<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; buff, can kite, melee.  Even if Verant nerfs kiting, druid is still a very<br/>
&gt; powerful class to play.  Talk abt necro, u think the Dot is nerfed, but<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; still got a pet.  Ya pet normally got higher lvl than magi&#39;s pet, not<br/>
&gt; forgeting that you can tap-life-heal-yaself.  At lvl 49 u can drain life<br/>
&gt; from a party of mob at the same time.  So u think wiz&#39;s dd is cool, but<br/>
&gt; have u thot of we fighting a mob and they killed us with only 3% hp left?<br/>
&gt;  Necro, on the other hand, can hurt mob and at the same time, drain HP.<br/>
&gt;  Not to forget u have a pet to tank for u.  ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5. I think both UO and EQ are equally good, coz they belongs to 2<br/>
different<br/>
&gt; kinda online RPG.  Again, &quot;grass is greener elsewhere&quot; sydrome, hehe.  UO<br/>
&gt; got lag, I mean BAD lag, blue pker, house breakin etc problems.  I think<br/>
&gt; sometime we have to be firm on what we wanna be, and I admit this is not<br/>
&gt; easy.  Once we set our mind to play certain char, I believe we can do it<br/>
&gt; well.  Of coz, sometime u will make a wrong decision in select the wrong<br/>
&gt; class/race, but human ma, sure got mistake.  Try again lor, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for magical items, there are alot out there, much more than UO I think.<br/>
&gt;  U just need the lvl to hunt for them, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wiz can solo sometime, in certain situation.  We are good in places with<br/>
&gt; fixed number of spawns, which mobs tat hit hard but low HP (eg treant<br/>
&gt; camp).  If u ask a lvl 31 warrior to solo 2 treants, he will died much<br/>
&gt; faster than he can heck the trees.  Lvl 31 wiz, on the other hand, can<br/>
solo<br/>
&gt; 2 trees, since we nuke faster than treants nuke us.  In train-proned<br/>
&gt; dungeons or places with random spawn, tanks can outshine us.  I think that<br/>
&gt; EQ classes are pretty balance, just tat u have to look for a situation<br/>
&gt; which benefit u most.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ziltus<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ok... when i mean econ is screwed... doesnt mean twinking... that<br/>
happens<br/>
&gt; &gt; all the time... i mean the pie tin thingy... that many many folks just<br/>
&gt; earn<br/>
&gt; &gt; like 10s of thousands of pp just overnight... also... when the server is<br/>
&gt; &gt; very established... many low level stuff are no longer useful and dont<br/>
&gt; fetch<br/>
&gt; &gt; any money... where in the new server... a minor item can be very<br/>
&gt; prized...<br/>
&gt; &gt; i do agree that frens are impt in any game... and still will be... some<br/>
&gt; &gt; gamers just power level their way thru and theres nothing to stop em<br/>
&gt; &gt; there... BUT there are certain stuff that made me think twice bout this<br/>
&gt; &gt; game...<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1. i feel that this game is all about levels... u gain levels u kill<br/>
&gt; &gt; stuff... u gain more levels to kill more powerful stuff... and its goes<br/>
&gt; on n<br/>
&gt; &gt; on n on... never ending...<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2. nothing so interesting... initially i thought u can create items<br/>
using<br/>
&gt; &gt; trade skills n stuff... so its not so bad... BUT verant decided that<br/>
&gt; trade<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill shouldnt let u earn marnee... so they nerfed it... sad...<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3. all the servers are wayyyyyyyyyyyy too packed... everywhere is<br/>
&gt; camped...<br/>
&gt; &gt; can u imagine when ur in a fantasy world... theres folks killing<br/>
&gt; everything<br/>
&gt; &gt; n u dont even get to see any mobs for u to kill? off course timing is<br/>
&gt; &gt; anotehr thing...<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4. verant start nerfing classes when they reach level 50 in one month<br/>
&gt; &gt; instead of the 1 year they  claimed... maybe u guys dont play Shaman,<br/>
&gt; Druid,<br/>
&gt; &gt; or Necro... so u dont really feel it... but they practically remove my<br/>
&gt; &gt; ability to fight (if u have some knowledge bout the new DOT patch they<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to implement)...  the mob just needs to keep moving at me and it<br/>
&gt; wont<br/>
&gt; &gt; be harmed... pvp will be a joke... then u will see every necro go play a<br/>
&gt; &gt; mage or wiz...<br/>
&gt; &gt; 5. like all the points... this game is become more meaningless... im<br/>
&gt; &gt; starting to think that UO is actually a better game... more depth...<br/>
(not<br/>
&gt; &gt; that UO is without its own problems)... but i can be sure that when UO 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; comes out in Dec 2000, it will certainly beat all the games outta it....<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; perhaps not since Middle Earth is due bout that time... hehe...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; despite all those ranting... hehe... i will still play the stupid eq...<br/>
&gt; bcos<br/>
&gt; &gt; i paid until december... (what to do)... and perhaps i will change my<br/>
&gt; view<br/>
&gt; &gt; when the time comes... for now... im a wiz (to be honest i find that wiz<br/>
&gt; &gt; perform good in group... but they suck when solo - totally opposite of<br/>
&gt; &gt; necro)...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; thast all i have to say...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm, u mentioned that Inno economy is all screwed, can u elaborate<br/>
abit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; more?  *scratch head* ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I feel tat every servers will ultimately grow &quot;mature&quot;, meaning more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; twinked chars will show up as the time goes by.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The joy of playing online RPG like UO and EQ comes from the different<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stages of char development in the game (newbie, intermediate,<br/>
&gt; experienced,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; veteran, god-like).  No doubts it&#39;s easier to train a char with<br/>
&gt; somebody<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; twinking you, but you will lost the fun, the good, the bad, the sad,<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fear, the frustration, the joy etc...all the experiences u are<br/>
supposed<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; encounter when playing this game.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; For those twinked chars you come across, most of them has a high-lvl<br/>
&gt; char<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; behind supporting.  This means that those players also spend their<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; going thru&#39; the newbie stage.  If everything comes so easily, u will<br/>
&gt; soon<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lost interest in the game.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Personally I think quite number of those exisitng kakis can easily<br/>
&gt; spare<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 10-20pp for a newbie kakis buying a descent set of newbie<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; weap/armor/stuffs.  I think with this &#39;twinking&#39;, it&#39;s already good<br/>
&gt; enuff<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to start off training ya char.  On the other hand, sometime it&#39;s best<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; new-comers to spend a week or so, playing a brand new char w/o any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; twinking, to get the feel of the game and decide if it is the<br/>
&gt; class/race<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that you are going for.  If every new comers come into server and suga<br/>
&gt; &gt; suga<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; create new char, we help to twink abit, and delete char to re-create<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; another one and expect twinking again, then it&#39;s not tat fair to those<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; helping.  So it&#39;s always a 2-sided coins ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just like playing RTS game.  If u hack a saved game and play the game<br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; building only the more powerful units to rush ya opponents, u will<br/>
&gt; never<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; learn the usefulness of other units.  For most of the solo campaign<br/>
&gt; game,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; normally there is 1 or 2 missions where the most powerful unit (which<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; normally slowest) is no longer a useful element in completing the<br/>
&gt; mission.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  At this stage, only those players who really play from scatch will be<br/>
&gt; &gt; able<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to tackle the problems and complete the mission safely.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Some players reached lvl 50 first, some reach lvl 50 later.<br/>
Ultimately<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will all be lvl 50s.  Just ask yaself, what kinda lvl 50 u wanna be?<br/>
;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  FYI there are some lvl 49 players in EQ who even lost their way in<br/>
&gt; South<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Karan, si-bek jiat-lat, hahahah ;P<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I myself is one of those few amg local kakis tat started a char in<br/>
&gt; Prexus<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; when it&#39;s first up.  With my wiz experience in Inno, I make a really<br/>
&gt; cool<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wiz char in Prexus.  H/w, dun to the lack of kakis, I find training<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is very boring.  In the end I follow the rest back to Inno.  Now u may<br/>
&gt; &gt; say,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s not tat difficult to find grp members to hunt with, but I must<br/>
&gt; &gt; comment<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that it&#39;s VERY difficult to find TRUST-WORHTY kakis in the game.  Ask<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; veteran players like Sereph and Garren, their feeling when someone in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; grp looted the camped stuffs, disband and run off? ;)  At least in<br/>
&gt; Inno, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; know who I can fight together...to death.  Until now I still remember<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; newbie named David in Prexus, who disband from the team when we<br/>
striked<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; skelly train near Ak&#39;non dragon bone land.  When some of the team<br/>
&gt; members<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; asked him why he disband after the battle, he said he was LD, while I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; myself saw him running to guards with my own eyes ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ziltus<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; p/s: I read form a EQ site that the numbers of casters armors<br/>
&gt; discovered<br/>
&gt; &gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; only less than 10% of all the casters armors in the game ;)  Just tat<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; casters sux in adventuring (we are better in camping) due to train and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; random spawn, we dun discover as many casters stuffs like those tanks<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there.<br/>
