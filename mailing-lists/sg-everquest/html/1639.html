<b>Subject:</b> Re: EQ Servers down.. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132300428">Okay, since the server is still down, despite me traveling half of<br/>
S&#39;pore for supper and took a taxi back, so stuff about the local SG<br/>
community and EQ in general<br/>
<br/>
As we know, more and more kakis are getting unhappy about QHD, due to<br/>
the sheer number of newbies, lamers and goons there.<br/>
<br/>
Now, for this again. The grand resurrection of the SG kakis guild!<br/>
*starts to hear ppl groaning*<br/>
<br/>
Oi! All get a bit alive leh, and stop leaving the hall, or else!<br/>
*flashes 2 dual-bladed dicoted katanas*<br/>
<br/>
Good, now sit down and listen. We currently got these problems:<br/>
<br/>
1: Existing goons in QHD how???<br/>
2: Kakis not united leh, how???<br/>
3. Server getting conjested how???<br/>
<br/>
For 1, I suggest that if enough people here wishes to quit QHD and form<br/>
a local guild, we all gather at the wizard spire in NK, and get Ling to<br/>
teleport Wylven there, and we talk to him, face to face, about leaving.<br/>
<br/>
2, We SG kakis are not really united as a whole. All run here run there,<br/>
rarely got chance to meet each other, and on top of that. Only when they<br/>
get drag, do we see them.<br/>
<br/>
3. As all you people know, Innoruuk is getting very congested, and<br/>
several places are made dangerous, due to the high level people, camping<br/>
items for their friends. If a local guild is to be form, will be still<br/>
be in Innoruuk, or change to a new server, and restart anew, with each<br/>
kaki helping one another out from the start.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I have to yell this out again. WHO THE FISH HAS FREE WEBSPACE<br/>
TO SPARE!!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting some web servers for reselling purpose and if this is not<br/>
done soon, I&#39;ll keep one of the server, and we&#39;ll split up the<br/>
maintanace fee of it.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: This is NOT that big change I&#39;m talking about. Just a minor step<br/>
to getting more organise.<br/>
