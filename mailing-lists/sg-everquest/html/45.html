&gt; Nope, never heard of them, maybe Magnus (few of them in Baja).  Which<br/>
shard<br/>
&gt; u play?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Great Lakes and oh boy, it sure is boring!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Actually Asia has approached us for alliance b4, but problem is the guild<br/>
&gt; expands so fast that many noto hunters/pkers are also inside Asia now<br/>
(some<br/>
&gt; of them even fight with us before when they noto hunt)...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;I was in a guild but op-ed out cos I don&#39;t like planned schedules etc.<br/>
Freedom for me, I&#39;d say.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Problem in UO is land is so scare that there is NO WAY to put anything<br/>
&gt; bigger than a small house.  On the other hand, there r so many stuffs to<br/>
&gt; store in UO, haha.  I really look forward to see how EQ manage inventory.<br/>
&gt;  Any exisitng EQ players can share your experience?  How many items can u<br/>
&gt; carry in UO, how u keep &#39;stock&#39;, how to transfer stuffs amg chars of same<br/>
&gt; acct etc? ;)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Hehehe, I lost my 2-storey and I was really sad cos I hardly play and it<br/>
took long to save up...not to mention what was in my chests etc! Now to<br/>
EQ...<br/>
<br/>
Basic Inventory is 8 spaces/slots. To widen it, you will have to put a bag<br/>
in a slot to make it have more space since a bag itself has 4-8slots. So max<br/>
is 8x8 = 64 slots. To transfer items amg chars, it like UO, drop is in a<br/>
secluded place then pick it up before it vanishes. Or just do Friend to<br/>
Yourself.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Oh, is Innoruuk the one Gary mentioned w/o any lag?  Maybe we shld set up<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; Local EQ msg board  for all local players to get togather discussing the<br/>
&gt; game.  I dun mind setting up one as my UO site already shifted to<br/>
&gt; Singularity ;)  Maybe 1st thing we need to discuss which server is the<br/>
best<br/>
&gt; and has more locals, then new comers at least know which way they shld go<br/>
&gt; ;)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Why the MSG Board since we already have this list? Pardon me...<br/>
