<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045835465">Sweet.  Maybe u can advise a newbie wiz like me:<br/>
<br/>
1. Where shld I hunt at beholder?  Deep or near zone?  I&#39;m a lvl 25 wiz and <br/>
have a lvl 23 magi buddy who hunt with me most of the time.  He got both <br/>
lvl 20 air and earth elements.  I will die die help him to lvl tonight and <br/>
get a lvl 24 pet.  Can we team at beholder till lvl 29?<br/>
<br/>
2. Where is this Treants?  What lvl are they?  Do they spawn one by one or <br/>
random spawn?  R they agro?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, u r right, I spend too much time on training skills (eg casting in <br/>
town, swiming in paladin pool, traveling between FP gates to but/train <br/>
trade skills etc) and camping for dirk and SBS (but less than a week leh). <br/>
 Finding a good hunting place is really VERY impt.  I&#39;ve been soloing <br/>
yesterday (on leave) and I gain 1 lvl from 24 fresh to 25 1 bubb (in 1 day) <br/>
b4 I go to HH keep.<br/>
<br/>
For all those who is between lvl 20 to 24, Lake Rathetear is a VERY good <br/>
place for xp, thou loot really sux big time.  If u are a lvl 20 caster, esp <br/>
wiz, u shld have no problem soloing at the single birdman isle.  I did it <br/>
from lvl 21 to 25, mainly soloing, and I only died once when soloing, due <br/>
to LD. I will recommend all early lvl 20s to give it a try there.  Btw, the <br/>
key factor is to SOLO!  When I team with pple, green chick give me no xp <br/>
but when I hunt solo, ALL green chicks give me xp.  I think when u play <br/>
solo, u get more xp by killing 1 mob than killing 2 mobs with another <br/>
partners at same lvl, this is esp true for blue and green mob, tested!<br/>
<br/>
(Disclaimer: I max out all casting skills, ie mean my root spell is max <br/>
alteration skill at lvl ceiling.  There is a DE wiz who try to steal my <br/>
kill but he failure more than 10 times trying to root it, in the end he <br/>
kena whacked upside down by aviak guard, heh.  If u kena killed when <br/>
soloing, dun blame me).<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>

&gt;     If you think i level so fast its because I don&#39;t camp for any special<br/>

&gt; Awesome loot (money, gems, polished bone hoop, polished bone bracelet<br/>
&gt; [rare]) and pretty good xp.<br/>

&gt;     Then level 29 onwards hunt Treants (about 3 Min spawn time & very <br/>
