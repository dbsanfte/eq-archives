<b>Subject:</b> Need info for JBoot camping <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138828039">May I know which mob carry the key to Jboot room?  Where can I find it? <br/>
 What lvl is the mob carrying the key and does it has other guard mobs also <br/>
(what lvl if yes)?<br/>
<br/>
How abt the room tat drops Jboot?  What mobs and lvl inside?  I heard tat <br/>
room is tougher than Najena room (of coz Najena herself is still the <br/>
toughest mob in the dungeon) due to those necro guards which can charm <br/>
players.  What other artifacts can we find in the room?<br/>
<br/>
All info welcome, thx.<br/>
