<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151711602">/pet sit down - Order pet to sit<br/>
/pet stand up - Order pet to stand<br/>
/pet follow me - Order pet to follow you<br/>
/pet kill - Order pet to attack, must have target selected<br/>
/pet attack - Same as /pet kill<br/>
/pet back off - Order pet to back off from an attack, but if monster<br/>
continues beating on it, it will NOT back off so use with caution.<br/>
/pet as you were - Order pet to forget all commands and stand there like a<br/>
goon.<br/>
/pet report health - Order pet to give you its health status as a<br/>
percentage.<br/>
/pet guard me - Order pet to attack anything that is going to attack you. I<br/>
heard before this command is not very good since it will attempt to attack<br/>
anything that glares threateninly at you or scowls at you, even if the mob<br/>
hasn&#39;t attack you. Not sure so better try on lower level stuff before you<br/>
learn it the hard way...<br/>
<br/>
These commands must be given when quite close to the pet, otherwise the pet<br/>
won&#39;t respond. Anyways, gotta be careful when you leave your pet lying<br/>
around, cause if something attacks it and kill it, it WILL come to you no<br/>
matter how far ya are =)<br/>

&gt;This may sound silly but can any1 tell me about the pets command. The<br/>
&gt;guide book does not mention this.<br/>
