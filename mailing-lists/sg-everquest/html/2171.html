Good morning. Had a viewer send me asking about a new robe that is <br/>
supposedly found by completing a quest. Any information on this item would <br/>
be very much appreciated. The robe is called the Phoenix Diamond Robe and <br/>
has the following attributes: AC 27. +19 int, +19 dex, +19 agil, +55 mana.</div>
