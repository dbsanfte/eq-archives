<div id="ygrps-yiv-418566239">LETs Do it.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that we want to be able to invit non Singaporean to the guild.,<br/>
There maybe  other non-&quot;Kiasu&quot; ppl who might want to join this guild. The<br/>
name should be relevant and yet &quot;neutral.<br/>
Whatever it is, get it started.<br/>
Get 10 ppl and let msg the GM&#39;s<br/>

<br/>
Creating Guilds<br/>
 If you decide that none of the existing guilds are quite what you<br/>
 are looking for, you may found your own guild. In order to establish your<br/>
guild you<br/>
 must have an acceptable name, charter, and a membership of 10 players who<br/>
 wish to form this guild.<br/>
<br/>
 The following process needs to be followed to gain approval for you<br/>
guild:The<br/>
 leader of the guild must email <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqguilds@...">eqguilds@...</a>. The subject of this<br/>
email<br/>
 must contain the NAME of the guild. In the body of this email the leader<br/>
must<br/>
 include his station name, his chat handle, the name of the character that<br/>
will be the<br/>
 leader of the guild, the name of the primary server of the guild, and a<br/>
list of the<br/>
 other 9 players who have agreed to establish this guild.<br/>
<br/>
 In addition to the above information, the guild leader must include a<br/>
charter for<br/>
 their guild. This charter should detail their guild&#39;s goals and role in<br/>
Norrath.The 9<br/>
 founding members of the guild must email <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqguilds@...">eqguilds@...</a>. The subject<br/>
of<br/>
 this email must contain the NAME of the guild. In the body of this email<br/>
the<br/>
 founding members must include their station name, their chat handle, and<br/>
their<br/>
 character name. Please do not have more than 9 people send in the<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
 Once all of the information has been received, it will be reviewed by the<br/>
staff at<br/>
 Verant Interactive. If any reservations about either the name or the<br/>
charter arise,<br/>
 the guild leader will be notified via email and be offered an opportunity<br/>
to modify<br/>
 either as required.Once the name and charter have been approved, the guild<br/>
 leader will be notified via email that the guild is ready to be<br/>
created.Once the guild<br/>
 leader has received notification that the guild has been approved, it is<br/>
his<br/>
 responsibility to meet with the designated guild creation GM on his server<br/>
during<br/>
 the designated time.</div>
