<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-492427223">If possible, I will vote Prexus over Innoruuk. Points I&#39;ve considered:<br/>
<br/>
1. Been a pioneer in the new server, I guess I won&#39;t be far from the <br/>
highest lvl group of players (well, maybe a big diff since I can&#39;t play EQ <br/>
16 hrs a day, but I guess it&#39;s still better than Innoruuk).<br/>
2. All the local kakis&#39; chars are pretty new - none above lvl 20 I guess. <br/>
 So it&#39;s still &#39;affordable&#39; to start a new one in Prexus.<br/>
3. Now we are all starting from scratch, chances is that we will be having <br/>
similar lvls as we progress in the game, that means it&#39;s much easier for us <br/>
hunt as a team in future.<br/>
4. Been a pioneer also give us the oportunity to be one of the earliest <br/>
guilds in Prexus.  Imagine next time you  tell ya EQ friend abt our guild <br/>
&quot;Ahem, my guild is the first guild in Prexus, blah blah blah...&quot; Kinda cool <br/>
if u ask me ;)<br/>
5. Lastly, been the pioneer players, our chances of becoming one of the <br/>
highest lvl in the new server is much higher, and this give us advantages <br/>
in role-playing in the game and the ability to help new in-coming local <br/>
players.  If now we set up a guild in Innoruuk, we are just one of the many <br/>
many guild available in the server and not many pple heard of us.  But if <br/>
we all have our new guild abbrev in our chars in Prexus, surely it will <br/>
catch lots of attention - since more pple will get to notice our name as <br/>
compared to Innoruuk.  Once we make a name, our guild will start to kill <br/>
asses ard. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s not easy to give up an existing veteran char and move to start <br/>
a new one, it&#39;s really kinda pain in the ass to do so.  I myself also <br/>
insisted on staying in UO Baja shard when someone proposed in the Singnet <br/>
Gaming List to shift to a new lagless shard.  I can totally understand the <br/>
&#39;heart-pain&#39;.  BUT, on the other hand, I believe none of the local EQ char <br/>
is as established as mine in UO (more than 5 millions worth of assets & gp, <br/>
several GM mules including smith, tinker, alchemist, poisoner, etc, and a <br/>
guild which is #3 biggest out of 1000 over guilds at that time).  Thus <br/>
giving up a lvl 12 wiz in Innoruuk is quite and easy decision for me, thou&#39; <br/>
I&#39;m pretty excited with the new spells, hehe.  Of coz, different pple has <br/>
different opinion, it all really depends on you yaself.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I played betweem 8pm to 2am.<br/>

&gt; Both are fine for me, but considering the fact that our characters in<br/>
&gt; Innoruuk are of vastly different levels, restarting in Prexus and <br/>
