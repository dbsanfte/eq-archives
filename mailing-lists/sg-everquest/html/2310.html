<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399138866">Venue			- Treant Camp<br/>
Kakis Party		- Ziltus (32 HE wiz), Leshrec (31 HE wiz), Zanderion (31 HE <br/>
magi)<br/>
Opposition Party	- Nanxxxxx (40 DE wiz), Maar (31 DE wiz), Fatez (30 wiz)<br/>
<br/>
3 of us is chopping trees happily at camp, while this Fatez come over to <br/>
join.  Frankly speaking, at lvl 32 I dun get XP for some of the trees <br/>
chopped (2 persons I still get xp from ALL trees).  Thus, we told him we <br/>
are unable to accpet him.<br/>
<br/>
Next round, Fatez start to nuke after we casted, and he get a kill.  Fine, <br/>
we said, if he capable of FFA, so shall it be (NOTE: We have no objection <br/>
against FFA, but we hate pple use us to tank for them to hunt for xp).  So <br/>
next round, we let him take both.  In the end, he almost died and we nuke a <br/>
bit.  I even bandage him and explain to him why we cant let him joined. <br/>
 This bastard say yes, and YET after he recover, he KS again! WTF?  In the <br/>
end, Les/Zan take front tree, I take back tree, he get nothing.  He then <br/>
started to curse and sweat me, no big deal, I see lots of cry babies like <br/>
him all the time, but really sux to see a wiz like him cry, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
After seeing no response from me, he threatened me to get his lvl 40 wiz <br/>
friends come.  No big deal, I told our guys, and Les said the most we leave <br/>
if that lvl 40 wiz get all kills lor.  Anyway Fatez also won&#39;t get any xp <br/>
teaming with lvl 40.  So we stayed and waited.  Asshole really called a lvl <br/>
40 & a lvl 31 wiz, all 3 from same guild called Order of the Black &quot;Cocks&quot; <br/>
(ok it&#39;s not cocks, but they are so stupid tat we called them cocks).<br/>
<br/>
So...War of Century Nuking started!<br/>
<br/>
Been a lvl 40 wiz, that DE is casting using the same spells we are using <br/>
(most powerful lvl 29 dd spells), but that spell dam rise with lvl.  By <br/>
right, he shld have won all the kills.  In the end, guess wat?  We got more <br/>
than 95% of the kills! LOL!  It&#39;s really no faces for a grp of 3 wiz (lvl <br/>
40, 31, 30) to lose kill to a grp of 2 wiz (lvl 32/31) /1 magi (lvl 31), <br/>
esp Zan is doing more like a traffice control in the camp (to kill <br/>
wandering animals to prevent them blocking our target).<br/>
<br/>
To me, it&#39;s just a very simple tricks that we are doing, but I&#39;m not going <br/>
to disclose here ;)  More like a common sense for nukers but the 3 DE wiz <br/>
dun seems to know it, which make us ponder how they get their lvl, esp the <br/>
lvl 40 wiz.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is that after an hr or so, that lvl 40 wiz started to msg me, <br/>
saying he gave up and asking how we win kills (Les and me always cast b4 <br/>
them).  Of coz I wont say lah, since that grp got no honor, heal them help <br/>
them still fight with us.  So we make up of 2 stupid reasons, which they <br/>
believe at least one of them:<br/>
<br/>
1. Our guild has pool resources of 1000k pp, and buy this artifact from GM. <br/>
 This artifact works like HT, and it allows us to get kills most of the <br/>
time. LOL.<br/>
2. When asked abt how we cast faster, I told him we got OC10 (I also dunno <br/>
what&#39;s tat, Zan taught me to sian), which is pipeline for internet, blah <br/>
blah blah, and we see mobs 1-2 secs b4 them, and that&#39;s why we won most of <br/>
the kills.  This they believed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m right - after I told them, 3 bastards still try to fight for kills, <br/>
LOL.  And of coz, they lost all.  In the end the lvl 40 & lvl 31 wiz left, <br/>
left that fu*ker Fatez, who still hang ard for 30 min or so, trying to get <br/>
a kill.  In the end we gloat and suan him alot, he so pissed that he said <br/>
he wanna beat us up in RL, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Never been my EQ life I feel so shiok wining a lvl 40 wiz, good work guys. <br/>
FYI, I&#39;m using only 56k and Les 28k/32k.  We all know Les got a slow system <br/>
yet he also cast b4 that grp, really solid!<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is that Les and me are not KSer, yet we can do it very well. <br/>
 Shld we KS, I believe we will get better loot and higher lvls.  But alas, <br/>
KS is not our cup of tea ;)<br/>
<br/>
The fact that it&#39;s a grp of HE (lower INT, lower LVL, less nukers) wons a <br/>
grp of DE (higher INT, higher LVL, more nukers) make the victory a special <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
LONG LIVE HIGH ELVES!!!<br/>
