<b>Subject:</b> RE: Wah, all in Innoruk ah? -Oh ya. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127322466">Not to forget, Yiyang will sponsor ya with all ya lvl 1 to 20 scrolls.  If <br/>
you can make him &#39;happy&#39;, he may &#39;fill&#39; you up with those enchanted <br/>
jewelries which he get from his &quot;boyfriend&quot; Kellendil , hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, our hairy chest Trifrost is not a preferred kind, he is the hairy <br/>
kind, like to touch here touch there.  The only reason for him to follow <br/>
the path of shaman is to gain SoW at early lvl, so that his victim can <br/>
never escape from his hairy &#39;hands&#39;, haha.<br/>
<br/>
The only eception is the aqua gu niang, Sereph, which can sing faster than <br/>
SoW.  SHe is a BI, her speed song allow her to train anyone SHe like to <br/>
leave her/his hands on.  Sometime SHe play SM with her parang and has <br/>
record of mis-chop at vital &quot;part&quot; of some players.<br/>
<br/>
Watch out!<br/>

Ziltus (How straight you wanna be today?)<br/>
<br/>
p/s:  I think I can go to FP practice smithing tonight.  I will make only <br/>
banded gorget since they are the cheapest banded to make - with 2-3pp cost <br/>
each I think.  If anyone wanna buy cheap medium size banded gorget at cost, <br/>
give me a tell tonight around 11pm.  Thx.<br/>
