&gt; Last night Garren, Einan, Flyingfox, Deadflower and I went hunting for the<br/>
&gt; Dvinn dagger in CB.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We managed to kill Dvinn few times but only found ONE Dragoon Dirk, with<br/>
&gt; the following &quot;price&quot;:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Garren died once.<br/>
&gt; - Ziltus died 3 times (one in water) and drop lvl.<br/>
&gt; - FF died 2-3 times and drop lvl.<br/>
&gt; - Einan died ?? times (lost count, hehe).<br/>
&gt; - DF died at least 2 times.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Later FF and I managed to lvl back but one more death we will drop lvl<br/>
&gt; again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just to let everyone know, so far all the Dvinns we killed are lvl 20.<br/>
&gt;  H/w, he is very tough as a lvl 20 mob and can inflict 40 dam on Garren<br/>
&gt; (lvl 26 paladin), not to mentioned how he whack the casters<br/>
&gt; up-down-left-right.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; His dagger, Dragoon Dirk, is a piercing weap but u can arm it as a<br/>
throwing<br/>
&gt; weap if you are using 2HB, it gives u extra Dex and some SV.  One thing to<br/>
&gt; take note, u MUST armed ya main weap AFTER arming the dagger, otherwise<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; dagger will become ya default weap even if u put it as a throwing weap.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hopefully we can get FF a dagger by tonight and we can all go back to HH<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; camp for PGT with Leshrec (money money money, here we come!), heh.<br/>
