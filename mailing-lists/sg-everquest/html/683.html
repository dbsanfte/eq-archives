<b>Subject:</b> Re: Training - will this work? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-689653466">Actually I&#39;ve think of a way for high lvl players to help the lower lvl <br/>
players to gain XP, while high lvl play gain stuffs (win-win situation for <br/>
both):<br/>
<br/>
- high lvl player tank and hit a monster left 60% HP.<br/>
- lower lvl player start to nuke while high lvl player stop attacking and <br/>
just tank.<br/>
- once monser kena killed, lower lvl player will get all the xp coz he does <br/>
more dam than the high lvl player (both not in a group)<br/>
- this method is more effective than to team with high lvl player, whack <br/>
together and high lvl player quit from team when monsters abt to die <br/>
(anyway this method also need the lower lvl member to do more than 50% of <br/>
the dam).<br/>
<br/>
This method is best for helping classes with high nuking ability, since the <br/>
lower lvl player have to do more than 50% of the dam.  H/w, we can be <br/>
flexible in using this method as the team can be made up of 1 high lvl <br/>
player to tank and do 40% of the dam, while the remaining r made up of a <br/>
group of low lvl players (so that after the high lvl player inflict 40% dam <br/>
and the low lvl group finish the monster off with the remaining 60% dam). <br/>
 This method required NO group between the high lvl player and the low lvl <br/>
players.<br/>
<br/>
To be fair, I guess the low lvl players won&#39;t mind to let the high lvl <br/>
player to get all the loot for spending his time tanking and training them <br/>
;)<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, the high lvl player and the low lvl player group can take <br/>
turn to kill/loot, which to me it&#39;s  fairer for both side.<br/>
<br/>
Oh b4 i forget, guys pls dun buy anymore runed totem staff on my behalf.  I <br/>
got it from a dark elf last night after long negotiation to a price of 20pp <br/>
;)  With that staff, now I can hunt wisp liao.<br/>
