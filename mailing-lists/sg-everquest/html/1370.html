&gt; I going to start a Druid in Innoruk, Halfling to be exact. Name will be<br/>
&gt; Veteran, last name (when I hit 20) will be Soldier :)<br/>
&gt; Since no people Druid there I think I can survive lah. But damn cham, how<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; catch up with all of you har? I power level my Cazic Druid for 6 hours and<br/>
&gt; managed to hit 7 in Misty, almost 8 liao. At that rate I have to powergame<br/>
&gt; like xiao to get even with all of you all.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t know if can do the same in Innoruk anot, hope can lah, or I also<br/>
damn<br/>
&gt; sianz. See all of you level 20 I level 10 cannot group :(<br/>
&gt; One more thing, what&#39;s is everyone&#39;s name in Innoruk? List down leh, if<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; I go in I also blur blur one, and what name is the guild ah? I new to this<br/>
&gt; list so don&#39;t know.<br/>
&gt; BTW, I just found this out yesterday. I am on a mapping expedition in<br/>
&gt; E.Karana and came across a spot where Gnoll Reaver (Day) and Undead<br/>
Reavers<br/>
&gt; (Night) spawn. It&#39;s at the lower left corner of E.Karana and all I can say<br/>
&gt; is that they give obscene XP for their level. All con blue to my level 18<br/>
&gt; Mage and after killing abt. 40 in a group of 3, I am almost 19 liao(from<br/>
&gt; only 1 bubble), just abt. 1/2 a bubble more. The number may be wrong, but<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; a 3 way XP split, I can always see the change in my XP bar when my group<br/>
&gt; kill one. Go check it out and see for yourself. Loot wise is sucks, they<br/>
&gt; drop occasional RawHide armor and at most carry 1pp. Most is abt. a few sp<br/>
&gt; to 3gp. Last, don&#39;t think of soloing there, those Undeads ones will ignore<br/>
&gt; the pet and go straight for you. Other also cannot solo, they hit for like<br/>
&gt; 30-40 and can stun.<br/>
