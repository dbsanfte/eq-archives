<div id="ygrps-yiv-376549468">(Press Release -  Singapore)<br/>
<br/>
We ushered in the new year with parties and great<br/>
celebrations , many of us were on holiday and may<br/>
have even leveled up . With the aftermath of the new<br/>
year , and the assurance that our servers have not crashed<br/>
and all the user records were not deleted .....<br/>
<br/>
2 servers have celebrated in cool fashion with creation of 2 sisters guilds .<br/>
After a much heated debated on the guild names...<br/>
(Actually we just spent 10-15mins<br/>
 everyone wanted to get back to EQ)<br/>
<br/>
On Erollisi Marr we have ...<br/>
The &quot;Lions of Erollisi&quot;<br/>
(*Estimated 30+ members)<br/>
<br/>
On Lanys T&#39;Vyl we have ...<br/>
The &quot;Lions of Lanys&quot;<br/>
(*Estimated 15+ members)<br/>
<br/>
*Estimates based on number of known singaporeans<br/>
 based there .<br/>
<br/>
Both guilds have agreed to work together to provide a solid<br/>
enviroment for EQ&#39;ers in Singapore . (Duh!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year and Let the the Good Times Roll...<br/>

WOOHOO !<br/>
Those of u still undecided whether or not<br/>
to start in a new server should give Lanys<br/>
a try . Its quite a good playing enviroment .<br/>
There are actually quite a large number of<br/>
newbies who just got the game for christmas<br/>
or never got beyond level 20 in their old servers...<br/>
<br/>
Come on .... Guk is still EMPTY...<br/>
What are u waiting for ? =)<br/>
