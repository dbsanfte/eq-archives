<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581656760">Extraction from the EQ Newsgroup, abt camping.  They have pretty <br/>
interesting points from both sides of the views.  If u visit the newgrps <br/>
alt.games.everyquest, take a look at this tread ;)<br/>

&gt; So, what your comparing is someone with a career and is working all<br/>
&gt; day vs. someone without a career and doesn&#39;t work. While I agree that<br/>
&gt; there may be issues about the wisdom of how one spends their time<br/>
&gt; (real life OR game time), if you don&#39;t respect others then you&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt; viewed by the majority as a Jerk(tm). You can&#39;t bring your real life<br/>
&gt; &quot;I&#39;ve got a great career&quot; high-and-mighty attitude into the game and<br/>
&gt; say, &quot;You&#39;re camping? Obviously your time is worthless. I&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt; moving to the front of the line now.&quot; without having a lot of people<br/>
&gt; make a rude gesture at you. How do you survive waiting in traffic?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I survive waiting in traffic because traffic runs in an orderly<br/>
progression that&#39;s set up by the laws of our country. For the most part,<br/>
it is a very effective means of transportation and in addition to that,<br/>
I don&#39;t really have any other choice. Camping is a player-decided<br/>
method, that is not enforced or endorsed by Verant. You mentioned<br/>
&quot;moving to the front of the line.&quot; Who is their to say that their&#39;s a<br/>
line? A group of players atht decide there is a line. What if I don&#39;t<br/>
choose to see a line? Camping for jboots is not a good analogy with<br/>
traffic, because it&#39;s not effective to the majority. Camping and the<br/>
lines are effective for people that have the time and devotion to spend<br/>
17 hours straight looking for the item. But what about people that<br/>
don&#39;t have that time? I guess they are completely exluded from ever<br/>
having the chance to own a pair, because they don&#39;t choose to follow a<br/>
set of guidelines that players create to take advantage of a problem<br/>
with gameplay. In my perfect EQ world, there would be no camping, which<br/>
is why I despise it in some forms so much. Before I really knew all<br/>
these unwritten rules, I went to the derv camps in ro once. There was a<br/>
group of 6 there. I sat by and waited and watched as they killed 6 or 7<br/>
dervs. I figured they were camping so I let them do it. After their 6<br/>
derv, I saw one spawn near me (it was pretty far away from them), and<br/>
attacked it. Next thing I know the group runs up and starts to lay a<br/>
beating on it. I get the exp, and then proceeded to get cussed out by<br/>
the group for attacking the derv. I had no idea what I had done wrong.<br/>
I hadn&#39;t thought I had KSed since I attacked it first and it wasn&#39;t<br/>
anywhere near them, and I figured I wasn&#39;t being a hog since I let 6<br/>
dervs spawn for them before I attacked it. It turns out I was in the<br/>
wrong because I hadn&#39;t asked for their permission to attack it.<br/>
According to EQ logic, since they were there first and had a group, they<br/>
&quot;owned&quot; the camp and all it&#39;s spawns, and I was being an asshole for<br/>
taking one of their spawns and not asking for permission to have it.<br/>
It&#39;s sad whenever i&#39;m in a group and a soloer comes up and says &quot;can I<br/>
have next?&quot; What would they do if we said no? I don&#39;t necessarily know<br/>
a solution, but the fact that people think that because verant designed<br/>
it poorly, they have a right to it makes me sick. I solo a lot, and it<br/>
is almost impossible to do that at most camps. So I just go to a camp,<br/>
wait until the other groups have had a sufficent and reasonable number<br/>
of spawns, and then attack one and drag it away out of group range. I<br/>
usually leave after that kill because EQ culture has produced this<br/>
environment where players feel guilty about taking another player&#39;s<br/>
spawn. I follow this culture for the most part. I NEVER atatck<br/>
something that another player has already engaged, regardless of whether<br/>
I&#39;m &quot;camping&quot; it or not, and if there appears to be a line for<br/>
something, I usually blend in with it. But don&#39;t ever try to tell me<br/>
that you &quot;own&quot; a kill because you have created a line. You don&#39;t own<br/>
anything in the game until it&#39;s in your inventory. And although I may<br/>
follow the same general practices of everyone else, I won&#39;t buy into the<br/>
concept that players have more right to an item than others.<br/>
