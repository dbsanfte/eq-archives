<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286937736">Hi Again Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes...here comes that favourite newbie question....<br/>
&quot; I&#39;m currently a Lvl 7 Magician. Any tips on where to go hunting around this lvl?&quot;<br/>
I desperately need plats and exp! (think plats come first...). I have only got about<br/>
5 plats at lvl 7...this is pathetic right?? Have yet to even buy armor/weapons...<br/>
so far all those i use were picked up...yeah..had to scavenge orcs and pixies... =(<br/>
Of course i&#39;m still on Fawdyer...think I&#39;ll be here awhile more...i even got killed by <br/>
Giant Spiders/Zombies in Lesser Faydark. Think i really need a lvl 8 pet!<br/>
<br/>
So back to main point...if you guys can make any recommendations...would be much appreciated!<br/>
Preferably an area in Fawdyer first..then more later =)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I know fishing probably doesn&#39;t even come close to trade skills at making money...but is<br/>
it actually even worth trying for some cash? In Felwithe, one fish can sell for about 4 silver plus..<br/>
so ten is 4 gp. 100 is 4 plats!! Siong man.... Unless got better fishing ponds? Maybe got those with<br/>
stingray or shark? Then BBQ the stingray can charge more right?? *LOL*<br/>
<br/>
One last thing...can we actually buy and sell stuff to different towns and make $$$??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope to hear from you guys,<br/>
