&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I always do fishing even if I max fishing out already cos&#39; that is when<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; get to talk and talk and talk! You should see man! Pier has 5 person.<br/>
&gt; After<br/>
&gt; &gt; 30 mins, all ciao liaw! See, I can get quite scary sometimes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can rise fishing skill by merely fishing at pier?  How u know ya skill max<br/>
&gt; out?  How can u make $ via fishing?  Do u really catch fishes and sell?  So<br/>
&gt; far I cannot buy decent food/drink. I buy those grapes and wines and in the<br/>
&gt; end dunno how to consume them ;(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    From what I calculated, U need to get at least 6 fresh fish to recoup those<br/>
us spent on the bait and rod. Anything after that is pure profit. But take note<br/>
that the rod breaks after maybe like around 30 or 40 attempts to fish<br/>
(successful or not). Not sure of that. Maybe the fishing experts can add on<br/>
that? I only got like 50 in fishing.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; I met Yiyang last night and he given me some clothing, so touched, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; been searchinig/hunting few days and not yet find a decent piece of pant<br/>
&gt; &gt; (hard to buy the right stuffs coz most of them r for other race or too<br/>
&gt; &gt;  expensive for me).  Thx Yiyang ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Nice going, that will save me a plat. Hahaha! I recommend cloth for<br/>
&gt; now. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; gave up on patchwork armours...too heavy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I just bought a old great stave.  Better than my dagger.  Can I max out<br/>
&gt; my 2H blunt skill by using the stave to hunt all time, w/o using up<br/>
&gt; practising point on it?  When I rise a lvl, I use the points on some skills<br/>
&gt; but yet it remain awkful, why?  Now I use my skill points on those skills<br/>
&gt; with the coin symbols - chanelling and alteration, is it ok?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    I would suggest that u spend only 1 point in the skills. Skill will and do<br/>
rise when u use them. I only spent 1 point in block and now it&#39;s almost 60<br/>
after constant use. As for u spell casters, u would use spells everytime.<br/>
Things would accelate when u guys get the mediation skill as it allows u to<br/>
recoup back ur mana and memorise spell faster. There is also a max skill u can<br/>
attain at a level depending on race/class.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Any other skills which we shld practice more often to rise it rather than<br/>
&gt; spending practice points on it?  Can someone list some useful items which<br/>
&gt; we shld get?  Eg beetle eye can help u to see in dark, even if I use both<br/>
&gt; hands to arm my weapon. Any sites I can read up more on these items info?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    If u&#39;re thsoe races that can see in the dark, u shouldn&#39;t need much light<br/>
source. I&#39;m not sure if u can carry a lantern in ur hand if u have a 2h weapon<br/>
equiped. If u can afford it get a Greater Lightstone. It&#39;s around 5pp. Great<br/>
for moving around in dungeons. As for skills, as I&#39;ve said, they improve over<br/>
usage, so cast spells to help ppl. Buff ppl when u have spare mana and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, where can I find bank in freeport?  Any bank close to west gate?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thx.<br/>
