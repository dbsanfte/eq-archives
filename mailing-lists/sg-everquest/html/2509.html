<div id="ygrps-yiv-518937442">Okay, some info about magis from me:<br/>
<br/>
1. Earth Ele cast a short duration stun spell. This is noticeable if you fight spell<br/>
casting mobs with your pet like treants. The stun part is often resisted.<br/>
<br/>
2. Bolt as long as you have a clear line of vision before you cast the spell will chase<br/>
the mob around, even if it went behind you.<br/>
<br/>
3. Bolt for hell sake is slower then shock but does more damage.<br/>

&gt; &gt;1. Hmm, I think it&#39;s the other way round leh.  Bolt cast faster than shock,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but it&#39;s non-guided missle and normally slightly higher dam, LOS is also a<br/>
&gt; &gt;factor when targeting.  Let me check my bolt and shock casting time<br/>
&gt; &gt;tonight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bolt takes longer to cast as least for my current lvl.  Funny is that IT IS a guided<br/>
&gt; missile! ;)  Maybe it is lag, but last night, when Fesse and I were kiting the qeynos<br/>
&gt; guard, I can hit the guard with my cinder bolt even he is behind me!  The only thing u<br/>
&gt; have to make sure is that there is nothing blocking on the way.  With the shock, the<br/>
&gt; mob should stand within your view else it will failed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2. Alamak, every class also complain, hehe, grass-elsewhere-greener<br/>
&gt; &gt;syndrome I guess.  At least u magi nuke next to wiz, PLUS u got a pet to<br/>
&gt; &gt;tank for u..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think Verant has made a pretty balance class system here. ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;3. I&#39;m talking abt the range lvl 34-38.  Magi dd inflict higher dam than<br/>
&gt; &gt;Wiz lah, no arguement on that.  FF&#39;s lvl 34 dd is more than 310, while my<br/>
&gt; &gt;lvl 34 dd is only 30X.  But even magi with a higher dd, I can easily draw<br/>
&gt; &gt;mob to me but not the other way round.  My death at lvl 35 with FF (lvl 34<br/>
&gt; &gt;magi) and Zan (lvl 35 magi) prove it ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have found something quite interesting here.  Just yesterday, I got the staff of<br/>
&gt; Writhing when I was in HH.  Once I tried to melee the pickclaw, they will come to me<br/>
&gt; instead of my partners.  This may either due to 1)  the - CHA effect that makes u most<br/>
&gt; hated 2) u hit the mob too hard together with your staff and DD.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;4. Magi is more of a supporting/nuking role in a grp, where wiz is pure<br/>
&gt; &gt;nuker.  There is no arguement magi is the 2nd best nuker after wiz.  And<br/>
&gt; &gt;with ya lvl 49 dd spell of 900dam, you guys are not 1/2 wiz coz our highest<br/>
&gt; &gt;dd spell is only 1200 (ie ya&#39;s is 75% of ours, not 50%), plus the fact u<br/>
&gt; &gt;guys can get tat spell easier and cast faster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The real problem is most high lvl hunting place is dungeon where a magi is not<br/>
&gt; welcomed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;5. Overall speaking, other than dungeon, magi shld survive better than wiz,<br/>
&gt; &gt;if u play well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; See?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good Hunting,<br/>
