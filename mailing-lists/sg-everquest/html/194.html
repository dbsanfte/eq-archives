<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757110837">Err, we wizards wear only clothes.  Weapon is quite useless for us too <br/>
since we sux in melee - our lvl lceiling is only 3+3/lvl.  So at lvl 20, <br/>
the most we can only have melee skill of 63.  Armor mean nothing much to <br/>
us, coz full clothes armor only add less than 20ac to us.  When I die at <br/>
orc camp, I normally memo all spells b4 I go get for my corpse. Wearing <br/>
nothing doesn&#39;t reduce my ac too much, same for my offensive ability coz I <br/>
depend on my spells 95% of the time.  Imagine my worn great stuff only hit <br/>
14 max per hit, while my spell hit max 45 (at lvl 8, and at lvl 20 we can <br/>
blast 100 over dam per cast).  For wiz, there is no such thing as <br/>
well-balance weap.  The only true weap we got is our spells ;)<br/>
<br/>
Btw, so far didnt come across any patchwork armors, can wiz wear that too? <br/>
 I&#39;ve been wearing clothes so far, and can get quite easily from dwarf <br/>
skeletons/orcs cen.  Of coz, compare to monk who doesnt wear or hold much <br/>
stuffs, they death is &#39;cheaper&#39; in the sense that they can afford not to <br/>
recover their corpse and start afresh elsewhere, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
So far I never asked any pple for armor/weap after I died - since they <br/>
doesn&#39;t help much and I&#39;m prepare to die again in the course of retrieving <br/>
my corpse, hehe, so dun waste others&#39; money ;)<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I hate is to travel to and fro to buy food/drink.  Best if I <br/>
can team with cleric or magi or wood-elf coz they can provide free food.<br/>
<br/>
H/w, I&#39;ve just shifted house last wekkend and now my house is in a mess - <br/>
no phone line, PC not assemble yet, no table etc.  Guess I have to stop EQ <br/>
for a week.  Hopefully u guys dun increase lvl too much, so that I can <br/>
still group with u guys, hahahahahahahah ;-?<br/>
