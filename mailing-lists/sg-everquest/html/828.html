<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235643239">Is Phenix a human melee player?  I remember teaming with a guy name similar <br/>
and he is the KNN CCB PCB HGK who loot everything whenever he got the <br/>
chance even thou we all agreed to do alpha loot b4 the hunt.  I think there <br/>
are always bastards and looters everywhere, whether in UO or EQ.  My style <br/>
is simple - steal kill from these bastards.  These few days I&#39;ve been <br/>
hunting solo in Ro Derv Camp, and there are always 1-3 groups who hunting <br/>
at the same camp.  As a weak wiz, I can easily used up my mana for every <br/>
cutt I killed.  Fine, so I will climb to the mountain and med, occasionally <br/>
stand up and see what are the other guys doing.   So far it&#39;s kinda normal <br/>
that other parties will get at least 1 kills b4 I come down from the <br/>
mountain with full mana, if not 2 kills per groups.  Yet many players still <br/>
got the cheek to attack my kill.  Simple right? It&#39;s so obvious to rotate <br/>
kills with just 2-3 groups, but there is forever cock-face who &#39;blur blur&#39; <br/>
rush ahead and attacking the cutt.  What I will just do is to wait, wait <br/>
till they hurt the monster by 30-40%, then I start to nuke and steal the <br/>
kill.  Hehe, this is something I like most about wiz - nuking - swift as <br/>
wind, hehe.  And most of the time they will learn to share after the lesson <br/>
- sometime it&#39;s kinda surprised to see how these players suddently turn so <br/>
&#39;alert&#39; and finally know whose&#39;s kill is the next spawn, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Another occasion I was hunting with a ranger (both solo), a 3 men group <br/>
come and ask to take turn to kill.  Fine with me, no harm share abit. <br/>
 However, once the ranger and the group each take a kill, the group attack <br/>
the 3rd monsters when I was abt to root&nuke!  WTF??!  I heck care and <br/>
start nuking what is rightfully mine.  Within 10 sec the cutt is down and I <br/>
go and loot it.  Guess wat?  I receive a tell from a DE from the group <br/>
saying something like this &quot;WTF YOU IDIOT KILL STEALER, THAT KILL IS OUR!! <br/>
 YOU DICK HEAD!!&quot;  Pardon me WTF?  They just tool a kill and they shout at <br/>
me for stealing their kill? Hehe, so I start to quarrel with that guy and <br/>
realised that what he meant by &#39;sharing&#39; in the first place is to let <br/>
EVERYONE at the camp to take a kill!  That mean - if it&#39;s a 6 men team, I <br/>
will have to wait for them to kill 6 times b4 I get mine, hehe.  Kinda <br/>
shocked, but can anyone on the list enlighten me - is this the way EQ share <br/>
kills?  I myself so far join several groups but none practice this.  Maybe <br/>
I&#39;m wrong but it really sound kinda funny to me ;)<br/>

&gt;     2 days ago, I was at Befallen hunting for a BBC (which I don&#39;t need,<br/>
&gt; just wanna get one to sell of cash, I&#39;m broke. Trust me, even when u<br/>
&gt; reach my lvl, u will still be struggling for $$$). The party consist of<br/>
&gt; Garren (ie me), Ironbuket, Iyenya, Senorn and Phenix. We were lucky that<br/>
&gt; the first Troll SK we killed had the BBC. That was the end of the good<br/>
&gt; part. Phenix then immediately stole the BBC and refuses to pass over the<br/>
&gt; BBC to me (funny thing was that they agreed to do alpha loot and my name<br/>
&gt; ended up as first. But I did said that the group can buy the BBC and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll spilt the cash with the group). And when he (ie Phenix) tried to<br/>
&gt; run out of Befallen, he died. Okie, that would have been end of story.<br/>
&gt; Guy looted group BBC and died on his way out, and loses his stuff. But,<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re kind hearted enough to help him to get his stuff back. Then his<br/>
&gt; friend Senorn was given permission to loot his corpse. Okie, letting his<br/>
&gt; friend Senorn loot the Phenix is almost as good as losing the BBC. They<br/>
&gt; are friends. But, dued to some lag and wierd shit, Senorn dropped his<br/>
&gt; SBH, and lost the BBC too. Now, Iyenya picked up the SBH. Okie, so we<br/>
&gt; gotten the SBH instead of the BBC, well it&#39;s better than nothing. But,<br/>
&gt; we didn&#39;t sell it. We held on to it and see who claim to lose his SBH.<br/>
&gt; Both Phenix and Senorn claimed to have dropped the SBH and both claimed<br/>
&gt; that each other had the BBC. But, why did I choose to believe that<br/>
&gt; Phenix had stolen the BBC (the 2nd time and also con the SBH off Iyenya,<br/>
&gt; which is likely to belong to Senorn)? B&#39;cos when I went down to Oasis<br/>
&gt; and asked 1 day later, ppl beside him said that he&#39;s holding a BBC. I<br/>
&gt; started to taunt him (PRICK was about the kindest thing I said about<br/>
&gt; him) and challenged him to a duel which Phenix refused. One thing I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; saying is that I&#39;ll never ever want to be in a group with Phenix (who<br/>
&gt; stole the group BBC and stole/sold his friend Senorn SBH, which Senorn<br/>
&gt; (a warrior) had to sell off his armor to get another SBH). So if you<br/>
&gt; ever have to band with Phenix, think again.<br/>
