<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368721719">A few guys was at the tower killing webclaw. They killed it so many time<br/>
they run out of people to give it to.<br/>
It LOre item, so only one item per person. I pay him15pp for it.<br/>
<br/>
I told Webclaw Murkwave spawn randomly.<br/>
When i was 3 birds tower it appears more that 10 times. The group kills its<br/>
like 14 times. He guild all about 10 guild members over and everyone got<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday at Tower, Webclaw didnt appear.<br/>
I have deduce the following. Im guessing, so dun flame me .<br/>
1) Webclaw spawn from towers. Be it the old small tower with the Plank or<br/>
the 3 bird tower.<br/>
2) how many towers r there at Lake Rathe???<br/>
3) Very likely will spawn from the same tower for the same day or after a<br/>
FIX numbers of death it has. then it changes location.<br/>
4) I saw webcalw at 2 locations so far. The plank and 3 birds towers. ..and<br/>
it always runs towards the west direction.<br/>

Still at Lake Rathetear<br/>
