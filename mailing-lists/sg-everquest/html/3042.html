<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014322581">hi guys and gals...<br/>
<br/>
this is eliza,  hope u guys are doing good!!  anyways, i logged in a couple<br/>
of days ago and found my lupine dagger missing...=(..havent been playing for<br/>
2 months so havent really touched my eq account for that period....was<br/>
wondering whether there were any patches or any bug that might have caused<br/>
the disappearance of my dagger.....kinda weird that it just disappeared<br/>
without any reason....<br/>
<br/>
if any of u guys has experienced something similar to this, hope u can get<br/>
back to me...<br/>
