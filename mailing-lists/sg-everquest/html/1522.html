<b>Subject:</b> RE: Skull of Jhen & Dragoon Dirk. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795218574">1. You dun have to kill dvinn, u just have to wait for me to kill for u, <br/>
probably u can wait at CB entrance and I will call u in to loot once I got <br/>
one.  Find a time during weekend, I can teleport there pretty fast ;)<br/>
<br/>
2. I&#39;ve given u RTS right? Hehe, we all practice &#39;family pass down&#39;, no <br/>
worry, once we upgrade our stuffs, sure pass down.  Btw, if u can come to <br/>
Lake Rathetear, I can help u get a skull FOC. Again this is lore item, I <br/>
can&#39;t loot anymore since I already got 1 on me.  I throw away quite alot of <br/>
skulls and RTSs so far at gnoll camp, kinda wasted (can tell how happy <br/>
those lvl 12 to 20 who wander there for free stuffs, heh).  Too bad I dun <br/>
go Lake anymore coz the aviak guards no longer give me xp.  But when I go, <br/>
I will annouce in guildsay.  Meanwhile just go and find out how to go Lake <br/>
1st, in case I give u a call, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
3.  For all kakis between lvl 18 to 20, you can form a group of 3-6 pple <br/>
and hunt whole day in Lake Rathetear until lvl 26, or solo when u reach lvl <br/>
22 or so.  It&#39;s a pretty safe place to hunt as the are 1 bird, 2 birds and <br/>
3 birds camps.  Depending how many pple in ya group, u jus go to the right <br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
4. I tried to hunt webclaw yesterday but he disappear once I root him (the <br/>
targeting just disappear after I see the rooted msg).  Anyone know where he <br/>
spawn so that I can root and nuke him once he is out? How to lure him up to <br/>
land if that is possible, since I get disturbed often in water with skill <br/>
135 ;(.  Thx.<br/>
<br/>
