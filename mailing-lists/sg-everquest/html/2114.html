<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108126785">Ahhh... today we managed to distribute the Glowing Stein to more <br/>
kakis who helped get one or more of the various crucial <br/>
components for the quest. Only Einan (as alternate soul Febon), <br/>
our bixie-killer expert, has not yet recieved his Stein. Anyone else <br/>
who helped, either by running miles and miles, or training mule <br/>
characters to be slaughtered for fish, or spending time and energy <br/>
hunting bixies, but has not received a Stein yet, please contact <br/>
ASAP... here&#39;s why...<br/>
<br/>
Today is Tuesday liao... there is a high chance that a patch will be <br/>
forthcoming at 7 am PST (10 pm tonight). In this patch, there are <br/>
rumoured to be several changes that will be made to this quest.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, the Koalindl Fish will become NODROP, which means that <br/>
the PC who gets the fish MUST be the one going to Oggok to get <br/>
the Stein, and I&#39;m certainly not going to risk Kellendil&#39;s faction in <br/>
Qeynos for it. Secondly, the Glowing Stein will become the Stein of <br/>
Moggok. (In fact, when I cast Identify, it says &quot;Stein of Moggok&quot; <br/>
already.) This is a 7dam 43 dly 1H blunt magical weapon that has <br/>
all the bonuses of the Glowing Stein. A really good weapon for <br/>
clerics and casters... *hint hint for Einan, come get it!!!*<br/>
<br/>
We are running out of supplies, especially Fish and Erud&#39;s Tonic, <br/>
so anyone who wants one now has to come up with these 2 things.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, BTW, Ziltus or Leshrec, can you please help with one more <br/>
FedEx job tomorrow? Need to fetch a fish from Einan&#39;s character, <br/>
Rendi, before the patch makes it useless.<br/>
<br/>
And lastly, thanks guys, for all the help and co-ordination. Our <br/>
guild shall vanquish enemies by bonking them over the head with <br/>
our beer mugs!!!<br/>
<br/>

Love is in the air...<br/>
Get me a gas mask, quick!!!<br/>
