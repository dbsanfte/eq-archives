<b>Subject:</b> D2 Patch 1.02 & Realm Status <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466971086">Patch 1.02 is Live - Gaile [11:36:PST]<br/>
<br/>
Battle.net now automatically updates when you open with Version 1.02 of <br/>
Diablo II. So, what have we here, in the patch?<br/>
<br/>
Major Bug repairs include eliminating the &quot;same character name&quot; deletion <br/>
error; corrections for a memory usage problem that sometimes made the game <br/>
slow down after playing for a while; a fix on CD ejection problems.<br/>
<br/>
Minor Bug repairs will make the &quot;Esc&quot; key work more smoothly in closing <br/>
boxes and pop-up screens and will allow faster drawing of the auto-map<br/>
<br/>
Improvements will close some NPC menus when necessary; allow toggling of <br/>
the automap when a waypoint is active; reformat game log file names to <br/>
follow the D2YearMonthDay.txt format.<br/>
<br/>
Also repaired in the &quot;Game Hint/Spoiler&quot; category is a portal bug in Act <br/>
II, details of which you can learn about in the &quot;update&quot; file when you <br/>
patch.<br/>
The servers remain down, and the scrolling red text on Battle.net mentions <br/>
they will probably be up about Noon PDT today.<br/>
