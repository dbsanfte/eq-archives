&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just thought I&#39;d let everyone know that Ziltus has<br/>
&gt; been happily married<br/>
&gt; &gt; today to a pretty lady he<br/>
&gt; &gt; now calls his wife! (officially at least)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It was a fun time for all of us who attended as we<br/>
&gt; finally got to put<br/>
&gt; faces<br/>
&gt; &gt; to all the nicks we&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; &gt; calling each other by online. FYI...Galarion,<br/>
&gt; Kellendil, Merns, Leshrec,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bibi, Massiah and myself (Zanderion)<br/>
&gt; &gt; were there and in fact all of us except Bibi (who<br/>
&gt; was busy with wife) went<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a drink at the nearby<br/>
&gt; &gt; Starbucks after the dinner.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Recalling the good old times and just chatting<br/>
&gt; about gaming brought back<br/>
&gt; &gt; many good memories and funny<br/>
&gt; &gt; conversation. Pity Ziltus wasn&#39;t able to join us<br/>
&gt; much but i&#39;m sure he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; happily busy right now kekekeke!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh and we missed you too Fesse! Were hoping we<br/>
&gt; could see you and put a<br/>
&gt; face<br/>
&gt; &gt; to that sexy Dark Elf butt i&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; been staring at soooo mucchhh!!!!! Oh well there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; always a next time!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Finally, this is also a chance for those of you<br/>
&gt; who weren&#39;t there to give<br/>
&gt; &gt; him your congrats! :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lets all wish him a great happy (productive!)<br/>
&gt; future with his newly wedded<br/>
&gt; &gt; beautiful wife!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; C O N G R A T S!! Ziltus from all of us...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Was great fun and i hope to see all of you<br/>
&gt; sometime again! Tata for now...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Signing off,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yours truly - Zanderion (D2 username as well!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; bought for you with me, Kar<br/>
