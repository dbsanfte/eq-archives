<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759414273">Err, wiz who like to use their body as tank?  *scatch head* hehe.<br/>
<br/>
I used to hunt in oasis for croc and caimen, but they dun seem to give xp <br/>
like HH&#39;s orcs leh.  Which part of oasis u hunt?  Is it the one near zone <br/>
along the coast?  That side can be quite crowded at times.  Any good lobang <br/>
to introduce?<br/>
<br/>
As for the deepwater, they resis my spells often when I lvl 16 (esp dw <br/>
croc).  I wonder if things work better at lvl 19.<br/>
Btw, I got a VERY unluck day yesterday. Play from 2pm to night 1am, died 3 <br/>
times, kena accused for stealing (when it&#39;s another guildmate who steal, a <br/>
separate msg on this matter), lost more than 1.5 bubb.  Cant find good <br/>
kakis to team up, run from HH to oasis (1. killed by a SG trained by some <br/>
gu niang, was looting didnt see SG 2. killed by a yellow orc warrior when <br/>
it left less than 3% HP, sigh), then back to HH (killed when I was justed <br/>
ONE stop away from zone).  Killed the named ocr at HH but no loot on it! <br/>
 Wah piang, really kena sai man.<br/>

managed to get about a bubble of xp per hour. Although the loot here is <br/>
poor, there is not much steal killing going on around here (Perfect for <br/>
those wizards who like to use their body as tanks *hint* *hint*) and if <br/>
really in trouble, usually can make to zone before you die. The caimans and <br/>
crocs also not very resistant to root spells and they are not very buff <br/>
either (4-5 flame shocks to take out a Deepsea caiman) Remember, the key <br/>
word is solo, if you wanna group, maybe max is 2, but best if solo. Hope <br/>
this helps =)<br/>
