<b>Subject:</b> Macroing skills <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-236317591">I read from the net that tat are few wulu wulu places which allow us to <br/>
macro some skills like swiming.<br/>
<br/>
Some pools are so shallow that when we sleep, we can set our char auto <br/>
forward swiming.  Thou stamina will drop, we will not drown when we stop <br/>
swiming since the pool is shallow.  I dunno those wulu wulu place mentioned <br/>
but wonder any any kakis got lobang near FP?  If yes I can leave my PC on <br/>
and macro swimming.  They say when u reach master swimmer, u can swim <br/>
faster than u run, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
FYI, fishing is another macro-able skills using the fishing bot.<br/>
<br/>
If there is any more macro-able skills, pls share share hor ;)<br/>
