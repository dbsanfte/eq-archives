<div id="ygrps-yiv-421067612">For those who have send me mails abt hacking, just wanna let u know tat <br/>
hacking ONLY works for open chars.  My only objective is to test out all <br/>
the skills.  This hacking WILL NOT WORK on closed char :)<br/>
<br/>
There are few methods in hacking:<br/>
<br/>
1. FPE2000 (Fixed People Expert 2000)  The most popular hacking tool in <br/>
taiwan. I guess all those who read chinese game magazines or play chinese <br/>
games will find it familiar.  Basically this s/w allow u to &#39;memorise&#39; <br/>
memoery and track all the memory when a certain stats changes (eg xp). <br/>
 After tracking few times it will ultimately find out the memory place to <br/>
store this particular stats.  So far there is no single solo game I can&#39;t <br/>
hack with this s/w.  Pretty powerful but only work if u can read chinese. <br/>
 This s/w allow many taiwanese to whack the american upside down during D1, <br/>
hehe.  Cannot d/l, must get from SLS, CD version.<br/>
<br/>
2. Cheat&#39;O&#39;matic.  Work same concept as FPE2000.  Allow memory hacking. <br/>
 But less powerful, can hack one stats at a time (but u can open few <br/>
windows at a time, one for each stats like money, hp, xp etc).  The only <br/>
advanages over FEP2000:<br/>
- very small program, can d/l from the net, shareware I think.<br/>
- some games will crash when I use FPE2000, but this one less prone to <br/>
crash, slower btw.<br/>
<br/>
3. Ice/hexedit<br/>
Only for those who know hex editing.  Basically only works on save game <br/>
files.  Since open chars are stored in ya PC, u can find tat file and hack. <br/>
 Bear in mind tat Diablo dun use straight numbers.  Eg in D1, ya hp is a <br/>
fornula of x4, ie if ya hp is 100, u have to hack the hp data to 25 (since <br/>
25x4=100).<br/>
Hededite is a file tat can be d/l from the net.<br/>
<br/>
HAPPY HACKING!!! ;P<br/>
<br/>
p/s: Anyone got any D2 cheat/hack pls share with me.  ;P</div>
