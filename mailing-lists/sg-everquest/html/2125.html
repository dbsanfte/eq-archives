<b>Subject:</b> Sabella Anna Estasis vs GMs in CT <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497206086">Yesterday, at around 10:30am, I finally attain the 12th rank of spells<br/>
for my enchanter. After that, I happilly log out of CT, and went to<br/>
Inno, to do a bit of the Stein quest.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, while I was hunting birdies with Kalandra in lake, using my<br/>
cleric, I ganna GM warp to Qeynos Aquaducts(aka GM torture room) for<br/>
questioning. During this time, I was totally LD, and Kalandra&#39;s HP was<br/>
quite criticle when I got back.<br/>
<br/>
Why did the damn GM teleport me for? Well, they think that the reason<br/>
why my enchanter is leveling up so quicky is because I&#39;m either hacking<br/>
their servers or exploiting bugs. I yell at them for several minutes,<br/>
made some rude signs, and they agree to let me go, while they<br/>
investigate the matter.<br/>
<br/>
This morning, log in to CT, play for a while, then another blasted GM,<br/>
this time an a Verant admin, and he/she/it apologize for the treatment<br/>
they did and will discuss some more, about my request, to keep this<br/>
thing harsh harsh.<br/>
<br/>
Pray that the request is done because..... my request was for a server<br/>
teleport to Innoruuk :)<br/>
<br/>
Sabella Anna Estasis, Enchanter of the 12th Rank.<br/>
<br/>
PS: Ogre bouncers gives relative good XP if you can kill them.</div>
