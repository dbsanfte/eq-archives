<div id="ygrps-yiv-400345982">Aye, what I can say for the lag is lmost non-existence. But currently<br/>
they are facing packet losses problem which is kinda like freeze lag in uo<br/>
,but that is not as critical as UO in which u&#39;re totally screwed as in EQ,<br/>
u&#39;re usually with a party. And the freeze isn&#39;t that bad that u need to<br/>
relogin. It&#39;s just for that few seconds. And the server I played on is<br/>
usually somewhere close to the least number of players online at the same<br/>
time. For eg, Fenin Ro can hit close to 1.5k while Inno just hit around 1.2<br/>
or less so u can see that it&#39;s less lag in Inno.<br/>

&gt; Nope, never heard of them, maybe Magnus (few of them in Baja).  Which<br/>
shard<br/>
&gt; u play?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually Asia has approached us for alliance b4, but problem is the guild<br/>
&gt; expands so fast that many noto hunters/pkers are also inside Asia now<br/>
(some<br/>
&gt; of them even fight with us before when they noto hunt).  It make us very<br/>
&gt; uncomfortable allied with them, esp they asked for war-declared allies (ie<br/>
&gt; both side declare war, not for the sake of fighting but more for helping<br/>
&gt; one another when in need).  When we talked abt allies, we refer to those<br/>
&gt; long-term trust-worthy ones, like our more than a yr ally - TAA.  As<br/>
&gt; allies, we share lots of our resources with them, eg providing free vendor<br/>
&gt; shop for them, invitation them for most guild activities etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Problem in UO is land is so scare that there is NO WAY to put anything<br/>
&gt; bigger than a small house.  On the other hand, there r so many stuffs to<br/>
&gt; store in UO, haha.  I really look forward to see how EQ manage inventory.<br/>
&gt;  Any exisitng EQ players can share your experience?  How many items can u<br/>
&gt; carry in UO, how u keep &#39;stock&#39;, how to transfer stuffs amg chars of same<br/>
&gt; acct etc? ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, is Innoruuk the one Gary mentioned w/o any lag?  Maybe we shld set up<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; Local EQ msg board  for all local players to get togather discussing the<br/>
&gt; game.  I dun mind setting up one as my UO site already shifted to<br/>
&gt; Singularity ;)  Maybe 1st thing we need to discuss which server is the<br/>
best<br/>
&gt; and has more locals, then new comers at least know which way they shld go<br/>
&gt; ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Kudos to you. You must be good at handling people. If you come over to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Innoruuk where Gary, YinYang and I are, might stick around with you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;smiles&gt;. Regarding the info about the game, I&#39;d do another post.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Good to know your guild are Antis, paradox/ironic to the Guild Name.<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; heard of Asia, like you said, most HKs. Never knew the Asians are so<br/>
&gt; united.<br/>
&gt; &gt; In my years of online gaming, the Asians that I meet are selfish<br/>
&gt; %^&*$%@^#$.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;grins&gt; Maybe that creates the negative image.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Do you know Dundee? Damocles? Jeff Boy? Canticle? Magnus? Those are<br/>
great<br/>
&gt; &gt; guys. I sure do look forward to meeting them in E&#39;ci.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Regarding the GMs and Tower deeds etc...doesn&#39;t everyone own one?<br/>
&lt;grins&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry, my rastic humour is up again. Must be the exam stress....<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure which UO shard you played but The Dark Wardens (tDw) is<br/>
always<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; #2-#4 biggest veteran guild in Baja (check OSI Baja guild list).<br/>
&gt;  Together<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with TTW and DWN, we are always fighting for the #2 biggest.  #1 in<br/>
&gt; Baja<br/>
&gt; &gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Asia, which is made up of several HK/TW guilds.  tDw is one pure guild<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; started off as local guild (formed within 2 weeks after UO launched in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; S&#39;pore) and slowly expanded to the the biggest single international<br/>
&gt; guild<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (includes members from US, HK, Japan, S. Korea, Taiwan, Austrialia,<br/>
UK,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; etc).  TWW, I think, is also one guild by itself while DWN is form by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; several groups of players to make up the player-run town called<br/>
Kingdom<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dawn.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We are very well established in term of skills and resources (we have<br/>
&gt; 20<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; over guild buildings, including keep, tower, 2-Ss, big brick etc, at<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; time, but reduced after the house patch is in as we do not have so<br/>
many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mules to hold the buildings).  Other than GM mage/tank mages in the<br/>
&gt; guild,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we also have several GM smiths, GM bowyers, GM alchemists, GM scribes,<br/>
&gt; GM<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bards (provokers), GM carpenters/tinkers etc.  We even have GM<br/>
poisoner<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (assasin) and GM detective, hehe.  As as today, I still have a castle<br/>
&gt; &gt; deed,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a keep deed and a tower deed reserved for future guild village in T2A,<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to include other 2-S, big brick, big smithy house deeds ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We also own one of the most popular shops in Baja, The Asmandi (a big<br/>
&gt; &gt; brick<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; house within west britain guard zone), which have more than 3000<br/>
&gt; visitors<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hits, selling only GM suberb stuffs at very reasonable price.  In the<br/>
&gt; shop<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we have standard price list which all vendors owners must comply<br/>
&gt; (imagine<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 600gp for full AR30 plate set, all reagents at 1gp above npc shop etc)<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ensure the best quality stuffs sold as the most reasonable prices.<br/>
The<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; shop is also well-known for it Charity Chest (a shop wreck metal chest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; locked-down in the shop), where players can leave their unwanted suffs<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that newbies can find something useful from it.  Pls do not think that<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; chest is a trash bin, as newbies always find goodies inside, including<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; magical weapons ;)  I myself can throw 20-30 magical stuffs inside in<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; shot.  The shop also provide free usage of training/thief dummies,<br/>
&gt; forge,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anvil etc open to all players.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you play around Baja server down time, often you will see a horde<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; black horsemen in Cov entrance, Britain X-road or Britain cemetry, esp<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cov,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; where we rules the place most of the time.  Our guild page is also the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hosted in Singularity Game site.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just wanna introduce tDw to more locals players ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; p/s: tDw is one of the most reputatable ANTIS guilds in Baja.  No noto<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hunting, looting, murdering, stealing is allowed in guild, offenders<br/>
&gt; may<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; even face severve punishment of guild KOS.  No tDws will hunt any grey<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; players in the game, unless:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - We know from past experiences that the grey chap is a baddy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - We see it with our own eyes that the grey chap has done something<br/>
&gt; bad.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; When we said we are ANTIS, we role-played as one.  ;)<br/>
