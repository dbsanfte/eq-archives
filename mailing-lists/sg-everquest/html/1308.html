<b>Subject:</b> National Day Celebration. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-668243022">Not really. Silvered plate has slightly lousier AC but is light. However, they are on mobs that<br/>
are of higher lvl than mob who has bronze stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My plan is that I&#39;ll hopefully hit lvl 22-24 by 2 days before National Day and we can form 3<br/>
groups to dash guk.<br/>
<br/>
Group 1:<br/>
<br/>
Garren (tank, predicated to hit 30 at that time.)<br/>
Leshrec (nuker)<br/>
Ziltus (nuker)<br/>
Yiyang (tank)<br/>
Sereph (talk cork, sing song and play mahjong)<br/>
Trifrost (all-in-one sans crowd control)<br/>
<br/>
Group 2 and 3 (decide who joins who among yourself and who act as the leader. If ponteng,<br/>
please send an MC to me)<br/>
Einan (healer)<br/>
Kellendil (nuker, crowd control)<br/>
Zanderion (nuker, tank provider)<br/>
Kalandra (nuker, tank provider)<br/>
Nicademous (tank provider)<br/>
Aaleku (healer, tank)<br/>
Kellindel (healer, tank)<br/>
Sunblade (healer, tank)<br/>
Yutaka (as if he&#39;ll EVER join, rank 1ST on my TBCNC, to be chop and castrated, list)<br/>
Neriss (all-in-one, but like no response one.....)<br/>
<br/>
If possible, we get a few of our guild people to join us. BUT the max is we form at most 3 FULL<br/>
groups to fight in Guk. Too many will cause lag.<br/>
<br/>
We will ALL be binded at Grobb by Kellendil and Nicademous since they can get past the guards<br/>
without invis. The rest of us will be invis and wait patiently for them to bind us and zone<br/>
when you sight a ogre<br/>
<br/>
Will put up more info a week before the hunt.<br/>
<br/>
While people fly flag to celebrate National days, we let out DANGEROUS fireworks and chop frog<br/>
to celebrate it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Permafrost is quite a nice place for xp and loot (only refers to those<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tougher gobs beyond the flag room).  I spend 5 hrs there last night<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; soloing, and half of the time I&#39;m the only soul in the zone.  If we can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; find a full house of lvl 18-22 to camp there, I believe all will lvl pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fast.  The normal gob, thou mostly green to me, hit pretty hard.  I also<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lost count how many times I zone last night, due to train, probably more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; than 30 times ;)  The casters give pretty good loot and xp, and some even<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; drop bronze armors.  Initially we go there as a 3 wiz, 1 magi, 1 bard and 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; shaman team.  Frankly speaking the fire power is pretty strong but down<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; time is long due to the fact that we have to tank alot and spend time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; resting and med.  I believe if we can get 2 real-tanks, life will be much<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; easier.  The place got a good mixture of melee & caster mobs.  Tanks also<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have problem soloing due to the caster mobs.  Last night a lvl 20 shaman<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and a lvl 20 warrior come in as a group (the other is a lvl 17 wiz, solo),<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they also kena bang out of zone due to those gob diviner, medi and priest.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Those caster mobs&#39; HP is pretty low, can killed them normally within 2-3<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; casts.  H/w, the tricky part is some of them heal VERY fast and hit VERY<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hard (lighting shock ~ 120dam per cast).  If u dun waste them b4 they heal<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves, u will find yaself in a very tough fight.  Tat&#39;s how the lvl 20<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; warrior get killed at zone - he thought only 1 gob medi small fry and I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; monitoring the gob medi HP.  I see it drop below 50% 3-4 times and when it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; heals, it go back to at least 75%.  In the end the warrior kena whacked<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; till death.  Another problem that u need a caster in the group is becoz<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thos gob are very cunning mobs.  When u hit them to 10-20% hp, they sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; flee into the tunnel, and within 30-60 sec, u will see a train of 3-5 gobs<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; charging out ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I spend 5 hrs there (until 4am) just to fill up one bubb.  Unless there is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; kakis interested to camp there, I will go Lake to fight birdman tonight.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  PF is very wulu wulu (thanks to Sereph&#39;s recommendation), usually not more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; than 10 (last night not even 5 during my 5 hrs stay) and it&#39;s really a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; power lvling ground for those who can survive.  Sereph said he spend a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; month there for his enchanter to gain from lvl 20 to 30, so must be good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lah.  If u guys wanna bash SG like what Sereph&#39;s enchanter is doing, come<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; join me, hehe.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ziltus<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; p/s:  Unless u go beyond flag room and hunt, otherwise the loot is pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lousy for those gob outside enar zone.  I earn less than 10pp last night<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for a 5 hrs hunt.  HH probably give much better loot but not as good xp for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the lvl 20s.<br/>
