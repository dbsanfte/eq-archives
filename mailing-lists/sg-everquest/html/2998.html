<b>Subject:</b> Welcome to the S&#39;pore Online RPGers Mailing List <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-248705038">(This e-mail is send to all my UO and EQ kakis, $ingnet Internet Gaming <br/>
List, SG-EQ Mailing List, UO S&#39;pore Mailing List and SG-Online-RPGers <br/>
Mailing List.  To avoid spamming, I&#39;ve hidden all addressees.  If you are <br/>
keen in this project, pls subscribe to SG-Online-RPGers Mailing List below. <br/>
 Before I send out this mail, I&#39;m glad that one of our local ISP game admin <br/>
has agreed to help us in promoting the local online RPGers community, and <br/>
he does have contacts with many big players in the gaming industry.  His <br/>
ultimate aim is to establish an online RPGing community for asian players. <br/>
 Of coz that will be a later target.  Meanwhile, let&#39;s work amg our own <br/>
fellow Singaporean players first!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
After knowing there are over hundred of local players in both EQ and UO, <br/>
it&#39;s kinda sian to know that we are all split over different shards and <br/>
servers.  Same thing happening in D2 USwest, USeast and Asia servers. Thus <br/>
I was thinking, if most, if not all, of the local players all playing in <br/>
the same server, even under different guilds/clans (like tDw, TAA and <br/>
Celestials in UO Baja shard), it&#39;ll be good to have so many of us playing <br/>
together.  We can conduct large-scale events, organize RL gatherings, form <br/>
alliance, talk-cock-sing-song using Singlish and many other happenings. <br/>
 Most important of all, our local players can take care of one another, <br/>
share tips and knowledge etc.  I still missed the days when UO Baja server <br/>
down at 3-4am and our gang of UO kakis went Geylang to makan frog leg <br/>
porride, carrot cake etc and go back home at 5am and continue UOing when <br/>
the server is up ;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in order to promote SG online RPGing, I&#39;ve setup a mailing list <br/>
called SG-Online-RPGers at eGroup. To subscribe, simply send a mail to:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SG-Online-RPGers-subscribe@egroups.com">SG-Online-RPGers-subscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I hope this mailing list will help to promote online RPG gaming in <br/>
Singapore.  Eg, whenever a new player cannot decide which servers to join, <br/>
he can find the answer here; or if anyone is aware of any new online RPG, <br/>
pls update everyone on the list, even for beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all for the time being, thx folks ;P<br/>
