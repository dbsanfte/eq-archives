<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093316863">Hmm I might be wrong but I don&#39;t think the Earth Elemental roots, maybe<br/>
ensnare but I don&#39;t think it roots. In fact after the EE casts, I don&#39;t<br/>
really see any difference in speed of the mob especially if its running to<br/>
you.<br/>

&gt;I disagree Magi is lousy, and also disagreed tat magi w/o pet is 1/2 wiz<br/>
&gt;w/o rooting.  In fact, in most places other than dungeon, I mean after lvl<br/>
&gt;30, magi can solo better than wiz (remember u can solo in HH at lvl 30 but<br/>
&gt;I cant?).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At high lvl, ya lava spell (900dd) can be purchased easily while we have to<br/>
&gt;quest or research for our ice comet (1200dd).  Ya casting time is also much<br/>
&gt;shorter I believe (bolt spell casting time is shorter than shocl spells).<br/>
&gt; Most of magi buff are &#39;stored buff&#39;, where u can summon till u log.  I<br/>
&gt;basically think magi is pretty cool.  H/w, above lvl 34, we really need to<br/>
&gt;find good team and right place to adventure (same for other classes).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Btw, I dun think u need root spell coz ya EE can root for u.  Ever notice<br/>
&gt;how the mob get &#39;rooted&#39; by ya pet when u send pet in and nuke?  When I<br/>
&gt;team with u, I always wonder why is it so, esp when ya dd is now higher<br/>
&gt;than mine.  I think this is how Verant compensate magi for &#39;rooting&#39;.<br/>
&gt; Unlike u, when we team, u send in pet and nuke, mob wont come to u, but it<br/>
&gt;come to me the moment I nuke.  I think Verant make it such tat mob will<br/>
&gt;treat ya pet as part of u.  So when u nuke harder, ya pet can still take<br/>
&gt;the punishment from u.  Most impt of all, when wiz oom, we are dead meat<br/>
&gt;99% of the time unless we are just next to zone.   Magi, on the other hand,<br/>
&gt;can make use of pet to die for u while u flee to zone.  Of coz once ya pet<br/>
&gt;died, mob will still out run u, but at least u got longer fleeing time than<br/>
&gt;wiz.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Necro pet is also cool, but their spells are mainly dot.  There is no tank<br/>
&gt;(nuking) mage in EQ, but I believe magi is the only tank AND mage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can still solo a bit coz of jboot.  U shld know I&#39;m also bad luck like<br/>
&gt;u..but I guess we just have to keep trying. ;)<br/>

&gt;&gt; I&#39;m ok.  Dun take it seriously.  I was just tired of Magician.  Without<br/>
&gt;the pets, he is only<br/>
&gt;&gt; 1/2 wiz without the rooting ability.  That sux.  Most high lvl hunting<br/>
&gt;place are dungeon<br/>
&gt;&gt; that pets pose a high risk.  Maybe time to switch to my shaman.  Sigh.<br/>
