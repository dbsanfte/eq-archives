<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-210681497">I&#39;m neutral to the shifting, I just follow the majority kakis&#39;s decision, <br/>
even thou my wiz is just half bubb to lvl 24 (shld have lvl if not becoz of <br/>
server down last night).<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think TZ server will be a very difficult server yet filled <br/>
with roleplay elements.  Ever since we play EQ for so long, I bet by now <br/>
most of us know what we wanna be, how to train what our char and possess <br/>
with, at least, the basic survival knowledge.  Compared to the time when I <br/>
start EQ w/o been a beta player, I was wrong at that time when making <br/>
certain decisions, particularly how my char is created.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, I will stick to Wiz even if we were to shift over to the new <br/>
server.  Life is gonna be tough (esp the the begining stage, like wanna die <br/>
cannot die, wanna live cannot live) but if it&#39;s a race war server, that <br/>
mean we better select to be under the same team.  With the same team, I bet <br/>
it will be much easier for us to hunt together.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m for Erudite Wiz - with max INT pump in.  Life will be harder than a HE <br/>
since ER dun have infravision (tried once in Prexus making a ER Wiz and <br/>
find it VERY difficult to play w/o light, kena whack up-down-left-right <br/>
shortly after I walked out of city).<br/>
<br/>
I leave the decision to the majority and my heart follow the majority. Just <br/>
make sure this is the LAST migration, IF we have decided to shift.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, can someone enllighten me on the following:<br/>
In normal server, npc only KOS char of different alignment (eg DE kena KOS <br/>
in all elfs settlements, human kena KOS in Troll/Ogre territory, BUT human <br/>
wont be KOS in elf terrority).  May I know if a char of good race walk into <br/>
the city of ANOTHER TEAM which is ALSO a good race, will the char kena KOS? <br/>
 Eg HE and Human are considered good races yet under different team, will a <br/>
human who walk into Felwithe kena KOS by HE npcs?<br/>
- If the answer is yes, then evil races will be a good choice, since based <br/>
on EQ&#39;Lizer&#39;s article abt race war team comparison, evil races (DE, troll, <br/>
Ogre) have some of the best races for most of the classes.  They also have <br/>
advantages since they have more access to the better lvling dungeons.<br/>
- If the answer is no (ie human char can go to elf shop buying supplies w/o <br/>
been KOS), I will go for human, erudite and barbarian, they can lvl <br/>
fastest.  Thou life is hard in the begining w/o light, but the reward will <br/>
pay off at the later stage.  Erudite makes the most powerful casters at <br/>
high lvl, Barbarian make excellent tankers and human is the most flexible <br/>
amg all races, plus no xp penalty - see how someone in Inno lvl so damn <br/>
fast? hehe.<br/>

would be much more meaningfull in the sense that when everyone has a common <br/>

SK chatting with each other?].Serious roleplaying could be carried to the <br/>
fullest and the tension when going over zones which WILL encourage grouping<br/>

group,however we could have some not in this group so they could set up <br/>
their own guild and wage war with us which WILL defintely improve the SG EQ <br/>
community.If we could not be friends,we could be still foes :)<br/>
