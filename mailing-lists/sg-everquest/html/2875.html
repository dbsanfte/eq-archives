<b>Subject:</b> Introducing a new friend ;) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112159123">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve 2 UO friends who join us in EQ Innoruuk.  They are both my closest <br/>
buddies in UO Baja, and have gone thru&#39;s numerous live & death battles with <br/>
me in my entire UO life.  Both of them are veteran online RPGers, so you <br/>
guys dun have to worry abt them behaving like a newbie, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
They are Mistaya (lvl 30? wood elf ranger) and Yura (lvl 9 high-elf <br/>
enchanter).<br/>
<br/>
Mistaya is playing in US time zone, so for those US players, if you are <br/>
training ya twink at ya timezone, do consider her as a team member.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Yura is now staying in Australia, and is playing around S&#39;pore time zone. <br/>
 So for S&#39;pore twinks, you know who to ask for hunting ;)<br/>
<br/>
Both of them are mature players, so you know you can count on them at all <br/>
times.  Pls be nice to them if u happen to meet them online, thx.<br/>
<br/>
As Mistaya is playing in US timezone, she might be better off joining US <br/>
guild.  Yura, on the other hand, play in our timezone.  Maybe some of u can <br/>
team with her and find out more abt her.  I really wish to invite her to <br/>
the guild and I know she will contribute well in EQ, just like my UO guild <br/>
in Baja.<br/>
<br/>
Thx.<br/>
<br/>
Ziltus.</div>
