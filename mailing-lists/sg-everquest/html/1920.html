  Hi,<br/>
  just wanna know who plays a nero on Innoruuk and needs the level 16 research only spells? if i m not wrong, i have the following 2 spells in my bank.<br/>
  1. Hungry Earth<br/>
  2. Banshee Aura<br/>
<br/>
  If u want them, pls either email me or post here and collect from me this coming weekend when i log on. Bcos my bank is all full and i need to clear some space for more research words. Otherwise just create a mule and get from me or something, if not i have to sell them to someone else that badly needs them or someone in my current guild (or soon to be previous)... first priority here... GRAB IT QUICK!<br/>
