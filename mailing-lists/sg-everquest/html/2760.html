<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206325566">1. His aide is in a building you will meet later, but you need to catch 20<br/>
or more pokemons to get it. The aide is in a room where there are telescopes<br/>
(I think, can&#39;t remember)<br/>
2. You have to find HM like cut to be able to use it and you must teach the<br/>
HM to a pokemon. Cut is on the captain of the ship.<br/>
4.Carry 6 always, it doesn&#39;t hurt to carry those extra pokemons just in case<br/>
the pokemons faint or you need to counter another pokemon.<br/>
Water strong against Earth and Fire<br/>
Thunder strong against water and flying pokemons but weak against earth<br/>
Fire good against ice but weak against water<br/>
Earth good against physical attacks like scratch but weak against water<br/>
Still got some others but I can&#39;t remember, maybe try searching the web.<br/>
5.If you complete finish liao, DON&#39;T use the megaball on anything less than<br/>
a mewtwo, since the megaball is 100% catch. Btw, the blue and red no<br/>
difference in terms of gameplay, except the different pokemons available and<br/>
the rarity of a certain pokemon in an area. The final dungeon also same,<br/>
except for the yellow version where the final dungeon is different.<br/>
