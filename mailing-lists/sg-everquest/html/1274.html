<div id="ygrps-yiv-343785123">Wah liao, make me so SEXited to see ya email topics, come in just to see <br/>
nothing ;(<br/>
<br/>
Anyway not very sure also, but personally I think the all xp gathered by a <br/>
group shld be divided equally by the number of members.  THEN, depending on <br/>
the lvl of the member, the allocated xp then multiple by a factor (the <br/>
higher ya lvl, the lower is this factor) to decide the final amt of xp <br/>
gained by individual.<br/>
<br/>
If the lvl 17 get all the xp, then pple can power train their lower lvl <br/>
friends liao.  I believe the lvl 17 is getting lots of xp becoz the mob lvl <br/>
is higher than his and even thou&#39; he only get a share of the xp, it&#39;s still <br/>
quite alot for him.  Personally I dun think he will get ALOT of xp.<br/>
