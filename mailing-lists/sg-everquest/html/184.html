<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708451493">Look at those LvL 20 and above Warriors,Rangers,Wizards standing in groups<br/>
in banded armour with well-balanced weapons. Impressive right? And they keep<br/>
going : /shout You better get the hell outta there before train comes blah<br/>
blah blah &lt;big talk&gt;. I am powerful etc...<br/>
<br/>
Lets take a look after they die in the deep deep dungeons....<br/>
<br/>
XXX : Errr....couldst any spare me a rusty weapon? Perhaps even some<br/>
PatchWork?<br/>
They are almost useless without their armour and weapon, when they go to<br/>
retrieve their things in Dungeons etc. I doubt those LvL 20+ even get pass<br/>
those Elite/Guards Gnolls. That means 300PP worth of things gone?<br/>
<br/>
Lets take a look at the Monks now...<br/>
<br/>
Mr-I-Wear-Only-Cloth stands alone in the dungeon and dies. But he just need<br/>
some food to get everything going right. The Monks can just fight their way<br/>
through to where they died without worries and EASILY. Been there, done<br/>
that. And at the same time kick some ass while on their journey. Whereas<br/>
those other classes take big detours around monsters to avoid being killed<br/>
and trying to retrieve corpse.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, enough of my biase remarks now.<br/>
