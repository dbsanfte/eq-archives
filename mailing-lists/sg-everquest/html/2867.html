<b>Subject:</b> Does anyone have this odd thing in there bills for EQ? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-102206892">I have been having this odd entry in my bills ever since I subscribe to EQ. <br/>
It is called Butterfly to Boom, not sure what it is, but it&#39;s been billing <br/>
me ever since I started playing EQ. It&#39;s the same price as EQ, US$9.98 so I <br/>
assumed earlier it&#39;s just the company handling the subscribtion for EQ, but <br/>
when I stopped subscribtion for 3 months during BMT, I am still getting <br/>
billed for it. Anyone knows if this entry is part of the subscribtion for <br/>
EQ?<br/>
