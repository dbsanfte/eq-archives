<div id="ygrps-yiv-101227293">Hmm I don&#39;t understand why kill stealing will make a person kenna banned.<br/>
Well, its fustrating to players, yes but its in no way illegal. As for<br/>
harrassment, if you find someone steal killing from you, just go to another<br/>
spot. If that guy follows you EVERWHERE and steals ALL your kills then thats<br/>
harrasment. Prolly that Lionessa knew the GM or something otherwise I don&#39;t<br/>
think GMs care much about this issue..<br/>
As of such, I don&#39;t think steal killing is right, but was just wondering<br/>
about the ban stuff..<br/>
btw, I&#39;m not passing through Oasis so soon, maybe in a week or two, after I<br/>
manage to get my black robe )<br/>

&gt;Just to inform all kakis that we have a stealer from the guild, who even<br/>
&gt;steal from own guild mates.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For those who went for the guild bash in Befallen last week, some may<br/>
&gt;remember a lvl 9 DE wiz who went to lvl 3 of Bafallen at lvl 9.  Of coz, he<br/>
&gt;kena killed many times and Garren, Wylven and I were the last 3 who stayed<br/>
&gt;with him to get most of his corpses.  At the end he still claimed he lost<br/>
&gt;few pp, dvinn dagger etc which Wylven and Garren were kind enough to pass<br/>
&gt;some of their loot to him.  So that was my 1st encounter with this DE wiz<br/>
&gt;name Voyesbian.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Over the weekend, he was hunting at HH solo, and attacked some of our<br/>
&gt;preys.  But he is too weak to steal from our group of lvl 18-20, and he<br/>
&gt;mentioned he just wanna hit once to gain faction.  We have no objection<br/>
&gt;over this and we also try not to attack his prey.  He gain from lvl 9 to<br/>
&gt;lvl 13 within the weekend, which is pretty fast.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;H/w, last night while hunting at HH, I noticed he started to steal from our<br/>
&gt;group.  He no longer nuke once or twice but nuke full force to get the<br/>
&gt;kill.  FYI he is WAITING for the tanks in the group to hurt mob b4 he start<br/>
&gt;to nuke.  I ask him why is he doing such thing to his own guildmate and he<br/>
&gt;said he just need 1-3 more kills b4 he log.  The true fact is tat he is<br/>
&gt;actually stay longer than that.  He is stealing at HH, and he steal from<br/>
&gt;from another groups as well.  He steal so ofen that one players from the<br/>
&gt;other guild, Lionessa, started to make noise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I started to observe how this Voy hunt and at one time I was even accused<br/>
&gt;by Lionessa for stealing her kill, while it&#39;s actually Voy who did it (I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;just watching with OOM!).  I&#39;m kinda pissed to get such accuse.  Shortly<br/>
&gt;Lionessa page for a GM, and Voy log immediatelywhen GM Glim arrvived<br/>
&gt;(guilty I guess).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When GM Glim arrive, I explained to him, and he understand the situation<br/>
&gt;which wiz are always accused of stealing kills.  He also understand it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;Voy who did the stealing and I&#39;m innocent.  GM Glim then went off shortly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Later part of the hunt, this Lionessa come over and drop comments saying<br/>
&gt;she have make few stealers banned by GM since she played EQ for 4 mths.<br/>
&gt; WTF?  My problem if she kill too slow?  I wanna stressed again that the<br/>
&gt;casters in my groups NEVER steal kill, in the sense that we never wait for<br/>
&gt;other teams to hurt the mobs for 30-40% HP b4 we start to nuke.  Members<br/>
&gt;like Ling, Flyingfox, Satoru and myself hunt often but I&#39;m firm to say we<br/>
&gt;gain xp with our hard work.  When there are groups of lvl 20s steal from<br/>
&gt;us, we hardly make any noise but to hunt elsewhere, so I can&#39;t understand<br/>
&gt;why cry babies like Lionessa make so much noise.  Anyway later Demitry<br/>
&gt;suggest to all group members to petition for players harrassment (since her<br/>
&gt;words sounded SO threatening, hehe), and well, no GM come, haha.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is just a note to all local kakis to watch out for this member<br/>
&gt;Voyesbian.  Not that we are not helpful but I caution all to think twice<br/>
&gt;before helping this kinda players.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Our boss Wylven (who is unaware of this incident) made Voyesbian a guild<br/>
&gt;officer last weekend, and the thought of sharing an officer post with such<br/>
&gt;player make me sick.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ziltus.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;p/s: U guys noticed we got more wiz in guild nowadays?  After me, Les, Sat<br/>
&gt;(high elf) and Ling (erudite), the rest of the new wiz are all from DE.<br/>
&gt; Hehe.<br/>
