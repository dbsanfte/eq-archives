<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-898899577">So how did my guild suggestion go?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, imagine this:<br/>
<br/>
Scenario: party consist of Garren, Yiyang, Sereph, Enteri&#39;s character, Ziltus<br/>
and Leshrec Place, Upper Guk, fighting to find Ghoulbane.<br/>
<br/>
Yiyang: Finally killed the NPC, Garren, your turn to loot<br/>
<br/>
*Enteri quickly loot the corpse, disband and run away&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ziltus: Look, thief!!!<br/>
<br/>
Garren: Camp so long, yet the weapon ganna stolen<br/>
<br/>
Message appear on screen: Sereph has been removed from the party<br/>
<br/>
Leshrec: What happen to Sereph?<br/>
<br/>
Ziltus: Maybe his PC ganna overheated as usual?<br/>
<br/>
*Sereph grabs trusty parang in RL, went downstairs and called up contacts.<br/>
Manage to find where Enteri stay*<br/>
<br/>
Sereph: On the count of 3, I want you and you to remove the gate. You 3 ram open<br/>
the main door. You, follow me in and break into the bedroom. Do not touch him,<br/>
he&#39;s mine.<br/>
<br/>
*Events started*<br/>
<br/>
Sereph: Enteri, we warn you liao, steal loots and we&#39;ll chop you. What are your<br/>
last words to your penis?<br/>
<br/>
Enteri: Wha, what are you doing in my house???<br/>
<br/>
Sereph: Hold him<br/>
<br/>
*Perform messy castrasion*<br/>
<br/>
Sereph: If you call the corpse, I&#39;ll diao more zui over to humtum your whole<br/>
family!!!<br/>
<br/>
Morale of the story: People who steal loots will end up with shorter penis.<br/>
<br/>
Enteri ganna saboh to be used as victim. Hee hee<br/>

&gt; Ya, kaki people easy to trust, if kakis play play we all list him on the BAD<br/>
&gt; BAD listing and get Sereph to parang toh him.<br/>
&gt; LOL,<br/>
&gt; Garren , Demitry and I was in HH Pass last nite, killed that named orc and<br/>
&gt; we loot FAST. That was a good idea. Loot the corpse first talk later. We<br/>
&gt; work out the split later among the group.<br/>
&gt; Aiya, join guild helps alot too., some of u not in guild yet &quot;tell&#39;&#39;&quot; garren<br/>
&gt; or me.<br/>
&gt; Pay us 100pp for membership, I take 80pp garren 20pp. and must go thru<br/>
&gt; Parang ritual by Sereph and Enteri(their rewards r the spare parts :P  )<br/>
&gt; J/k..(but not about joining Guild).<br/>

&gt; &gt;This happened to me too in Highhold. At the gnoll respawn, theres the<br/>
&gt; famous<br/>
&gt; &gt;Polished Granite tomahawk which is VERY camped. As the guy was my friend, I<br/>
&gt; &gt;decided to help him get the tomahawk. We had a full group of six and when<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt;killed the named gnoll, a group member IMMEDIATELY looted the gnoll. Now,<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt;was very obvious that the gnoll was carrying a weapon, most likely the<br/>
&gt; tommy<br/>
&gt; &gt;since he dosen&#39;t load anything else other then the shield, but that guy<br/>
&gt; &gt;played dumb and pretended he didn&#39;t understand english. As the group<br/>
&gt; decided<br/>
&gt; &gt;on a alpha loot on the tommy, my friend was the first to get, but that dude<br/>
&gt; &gt;who stole the tommy just kept saying &quot;No axe, shield only&quot; And when my<br/>
&gt; &gt;friend asked for the shield since he should get the first loot, he said<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Shield no with me. In bank&quot; But in the end he just ran away. To think we<br/>
&gt; &gt;had internal conflict as well as external conflict (A cleric named Kagana<br/>
&gt; &gt;kept bitching to my friend that she was bringing a druid which could help<br/>
&gt; &gt;her steal kill the gnoll. In the end when the gnoll spawned, they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt;mana. lol.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;Anyways, I think we Singaporeans should group together OURSELF and only<br/>
&gt; &gt;trusted friends to do Equipment runs. Sucks to trust these assholes who<br/>
&gt; &gt;don&#39;t have any conscience at all.<br/>
