<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241618297">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
Remember the &quot;Wolverine&quot; thing I was speaking about? Its called a Death Claw. Some one spotted a GM with one....<br/>
<br/>
Mua Hahaha! Mwa Hahahaha! &lt;&lt;Sinister Laugh&gt;&gt; But what if it turns out to be a 1H Slash instead...?<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, if I manage to get my sorry ass to Freeport. Make sure you people bring me around sightseeing. I visited the Aviak Village yesterday and will be making my way to the Centaur Village.<br/>
<br/>
I am still looking to get Netted/Woven/Mesh.<br/>
