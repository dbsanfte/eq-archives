<div id="ygrps-yiv-864960710">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s time something is done about our guild. We either need more ppl or we need more guild events.<br/>
Probably the former.Problem is Ziltus and Leshrec no longer play their wizards. Fesse is also semi retired. <br/>
I already have problems finding ppl to group with as it has been last few weeks. Also we dont seem to have<br/>
much of an enthusiasm. No offence but i think some things need fixing. Or maybe i&#39;m the only one feeling it hmm...<br/>
<br/>
Unlike a few guilds i&#39;ve come to know...we really haven&#39;t had much of a union as a guild. Lvls pobably play one<br/>
part as it prevents effective guild outings. Other is we seem to have bad luck with any so far hehe.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like and hope to see something good that can be done for us all...if not maybe one day i might just leave..<br/>
no offence i like you guys but i need to be able to have some fun too..it&#39;s hardly fun anymore now for me.<br/>
I&#39;ll still be on mailing list if i ever leave and i will still give my best at providing any info that no one might have<br/>
or help if i ever can...<br/>
<br/>
Of course that&#39;s only if i leave (which is unlikely) but i&#39;d thought i just bring it up to you all to be fair...<br/>
Thaks for your time<br/>
