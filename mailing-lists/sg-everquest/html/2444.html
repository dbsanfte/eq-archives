	It seems like that the connection for the last 2 days are really<br/>
terrible. This afternoon around 2pm, I went to Lavastorm Mnt from North<br/>
Freeport. It took me 4 lds to get there....<br/>

&gt; I tried a friend cyberway connection last night, 80% I&#39;m flashing between<br/>
&gt; yellow and red connection.  Average PL is 30%, and got freeze many times,<br/>
&gt; from 5sec to 2 min (that&#39;s when I was killed in najena, by bonecracker).<br/>
&gt;  With this kinda connection, better dun hunt and do some maintenance<br/>
&gt; instead, like selling stuffs, casting spells in town to rise casting skills<br/>
&gt; or do some inventory spring cleaning ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now I gotta think twice b4 getting cyberway $48 unlimited plan.  The<br/>
&gt; surfing also sux as compared to $ingnet.  Is cyberway abnormally laggy last<br/>
&gt; night and just as per normal days?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hmm...... I think it was u who ask me to accept u to my group? LOL......<br/>
&gt;  I think it is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; good idea to quit hunting once U got bad PL or lag.   Last time when we<br/>
&gt; move to<br/>
&gt; &gt; perma,  I LD quite a few times but still wanna go there.  In the end,  I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t help out at<br/>
&gt; &gt; all but got killed.  Heehee.<br/>
