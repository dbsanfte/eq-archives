<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105201196">Wizards are really nice, their pyrotechnics are second to none and the awe on ppl&#39;s faces  when the creature is at half of his hp and one blast and hes dead. But the problem is this, the wizs do nothing in combat cept for blast blast blast. No strat, cept u dun blast too much until the victim comes running towards you. Sure they get the portal spells at later levels which are very very nice and convinent, but unless you are gonna enjoy just clicking on your DD spells, since the AE spells and the other combat spells would mean suicide, you are going to be bored of it, just like a high level warrior would be when he sees his friends casting spells and turning the tide of the battle. )<br/>

    *shakes head* <br/>
    The grass will always appear greener on the other side unless you&#39;ve been there before. so far, with my experience of EQ since the 3rd beta, I have mess around with Shadow Knights, Paladins, Enchanters, Necros, Shamans and Magicians. The other classes I have not much experiences with so I won&#39;t comment. <br/>
<br/>
    The problem with Shadow knight is this. <br/>
<br/>
    At first glance, harm touch appears to be very powerful, dealing 10 X level + 1 damage, but what many people don&#39;t know is that: <br/>
<br/>
    1. Harm Touch is counted as an alteration spell. IOWs, it can be resisted. <br/>
    2. Being alteration in nature, part of its damage can be resisted. <br/>
<br/>
    On average, with a level 13 TSK, I constantly do around 70-80 damage, not the full 131 I expect it to do and miss twice ever 10 times I tyr. <br/>
<br/>
    Unless you choose Dark Elf or Humans as a SK, you would not be able to cast spells the level you get them, as Ogres and Trolls have an aweful intelligence score, which bring about another problem, Troll/Orge Shadow Knight gains skills at a painful pace. They often find themselves unable to reach the skill cap of their level. <br/>
<br/>
    On regenaration, at low levels, it is a fantastic thing, but at high level, nothing functions better than a real healing spell. <br/>
<br/>
    At level 40, an average TSK is expected to have around 1200 hp and would expect to take any where from 200-800 hp worth of damage per battle. Even with regenaration, it is still take around 10-20mins to regenerate the amount. <br/>
<br/>
    Thus, the TSK is not really able to solo at high levels. Level 1-15 is easy, but after this range, due to slow level advancement and an unreliable way of healing, they can&#39;t solo well. <br/>
<br/>
    The advantage TSK have over other hybrid warrior classes is that they can still bash when using 2 handed slashing weapons. <br/>
<br/>
    Troll Shamans are worse off. Being a priest class, they will never gain additional attack, and damage they deal is capped. At level 16, you reach your melee damage cap. <br/>
<br/>
    In addition Shamans don&#39;t really have fantastic direct damage spells nor good healing ability so soloing past 16 is hard/near impossible. <br/>
<br/>
    Troll Warriors fair slightly better than TSK as they hit harder, faster and has more HP, but they still need reliable backup to reach high levels. <br/>
<br/>
    Monks I agree is one of the best class to solo with. The various special attacks do a lot of damage and mend, at high level almost never fail. Healing 1/4 of your HP every 6 minutes is damn useful. <br/>
<br/>
    Priest class can never solo well unless they go to areas where their wards spell can be use (Befallen for Clerics, Elemental Planes for Druids) else they fare very badly against normal enermies <br/>
<br/>
    For Wizards, the only way they solo is Root -&gt; Damage spells, damage spells....... <br/>
<br/>
    If root runs out, they&#39;re toast, and most would dash towards the entrance bringing trains....... A very common sight. <br/>
<br/>
    IMO, these class can solo pretty well from mid to high levels. <br/>
<br/>
    Monks <br/>
    Necros (Provided that nessesary spells could be researched) <br/>
    Magicians (Same as Necro) <br/>
    Enchanters (Only after Tashani, Beguile and Clam) <br/>

        There is no doubt a TSK can solo best in EQ.  They have the harm spells <br/>
        which is as good as Paladin&#39;s healing ability (no saving throw or failure), <br/>
        yet they have the ability of regenerating HP ability.  I made a troll <br/>
        shaman in Innoruuk for testing, at lvl 1 my first victim is a monster which <br/>
        is yellow to me.  And within the first 10 min I play, I gain a lvl. <br/>
<br/>
        Btw, all classes always complain that they are weaker than other classes, <br/>
        seem to be a norm, hehe.  I even read from the net how a lvl 40+ warrior <br/>
        complained abt his char as compare to a shadowknight who is few lvl below <br/>
        him - coz in term of soloing, this warrior can&#39;t handle big monster like <br/>
        that shadowknight. <br/>
<br/>
        EQSS also have an article abt soloing - and they rank troll anything as the <br/>
        easiest soloing char, esp TSK, followed by wiz, shaman, dwarf cleric and <br/>
        monk.  One thing abt monk, at lvl 35+ they will jump to 2nd in the list, ie <br/>
        the next best soloing class after Troll something, due to the new kick ass <br/>
        skills they achieve at higher level. <br/>
