<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477916367">Hope Gary would add some of his opinions to my brief ones.<br/>
<br/>
1)Inventory is a pain in the ass with little space and time-consuming movement period compared to UO.<br/>
<br/>
2)First person view is the main view but able to switch to ass-cam &lt;tomb raider&gt; for the more professional players&#39; choice. There are a total of 5 different views if I&#39;m right.<br/>
<br/>
3)Hunting in groups are encouraged due to trains and tough mobs with splendid loots.<br/>
<br/>
4)Minotour Axes are like the best non-magic weapon in the game. Price range from 5pp-10pp.<br/>
<br/>
5)If you love interaction, then this is the game. Meridian 59 is also recommended.<br/>
<br/>
6)One hour in real life is like 1 whole day in EverQuest &lt;morning til night&gt;<br/>
<br/>
7)Face choices variety needs a HUGE update.<br/>
<br/>
8)Almost bug-free....now now, lets not talk about UO. &lt;grins&gt;<br/>
<br/>
9)Marcoing is still present but MUCH MUCH SO MUCH MUCH SO MUCH more less effective.<br/>
<br/>
10)Mules are like useless.<br/>
<br/>
11)If your Lawyer or your Boss is drowning, would you choose going to the movies or to StarBucks? &lt;drafted&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
