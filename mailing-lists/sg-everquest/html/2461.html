<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368704846">Illusion: Spirit Wolf outdoor only....... how the heck do I pull giants<br/>
and such out safely (FYI, before the patch, I can run to Vox, wave at<br/>
her without her attacking me while in Spirit wolf form.)????<br/>
<br/>
Illusion: Werewolve Damn, this illusion is now OVER powerful. I cast<br/>
this and together with swift like the wind and had a bard sing a battle<br/>
song, I did a constant 4 attacks every 2 to 3 sec! Weap is a FSS as<br/>
usual, which has 22 delay.<br/>
<br/>
Pets, damn, you can give weaps to them now! With a FS dagger, my pet was<br/>
double attack for 36-40+ dmg a pierce in 2sec which is quite near the<br/>
damage output of a magi and necro pet, after the pet downgrade for the<br/>
other 2 classes. A pair of flying swords sure looks better then a<br/>
floating sword and sheild.</div>
