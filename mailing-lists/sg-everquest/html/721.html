<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928324574">I declare the raid to be a total failure. We didn&#39;t get much of what we<br/>
want and in the end, Gary and I died while trying to get out of<br/>
Innothule swamp and LKW got lost. We resorted to all sort of funny ways<br/>
and manage to get our stuff back. (The whole process can be summarised<br/>
by 1 word, Cheebye)<br/>
<br/>
I took some useless screenshots. Anyone interested, request from me.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I still need to be power leveled. I got some equipment from Gary(my<br/>
character&#39;s rear is still bear........) but I still lack levels.</div>
