<b>Subject:</b> SG kakis guild, MUST READ and MUST reply. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-842972321">General opinion of our SG kakis, whose names shall be hidden, states<br/>
that we, want a SG kaki guild, by next week.<br/>
<br/>
Why? Shouldn&#39;t QHD be enough? Could be the question you are going to<br/>
throw at me later, and I&#39;ll answer them AGAIN.<br/>
<br/>
QHD has several lamers these days, and on top of that, it&#39;s hyper<br/>
inactive in activities. When was the last time, the guild got together<br/>
to do something? It acts more like a glorified shout channel. Also, when<br/>
we are planning kakis only activities and have to resort to guildsay to<br/>
communicate, random goons might join in, and ruin the experience for us.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, I propose that we get this thing together and prepare for<br/>
the guild formation by Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, what I want you to do is answer this question:<br/>
<br/>
Quit QHD and form a local kaki guild, yay or nay?<br/>
<br/>
Then these question if you say yay:<br/>
<br/>
Who should be the goondu in charge?<br/>
<br/>
Who should be the officals for recruiting?<br/>
<br/>
The charter, who is willing to type it?<br/>
<br/>
Website, for the thousand time, anyone can get one ASAP?<br/>
<br/>
Recruting guidlines, think, and give me your opinion.</div>
