<div id="ygrps-yiv-482355129">Ziltus,<br/>
There are merchants selling sheet metal and banded mold in Kelethin and i<br/>
think<br/>
it is the one at the priest lift, one selling scaler mold and other at the<br/>
platform to the right.<br/>
<br/>
The pottery merchant is in Kelethin also but i forgot exactly where<br/>
.Freeport is not so good for<br/>
pottery as you have to buy firing sheet at east commonland.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and BS tunic is Bloodstain Tunic, there is also a Bloodstain Mantle<br/>
