<b>Subject:</b> EQ Screen freeze <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-920355506">Since the sov patch, my EQ screen can freeze unpectedly all of a sudden. <br/>
 This is not the normal LD, where I will get the disconnected msg and get <br/>
kicked back to the EQ login screen.  Instead, the PC just freeze and I have <br/>
to reboot the PC (ie auto scandisk etc) and restart EQ.  Sometime the PC <br/>
automatically restart by itself just b4 I get to Win98 desktop.<br/>
<br/>
Some other SCV cable modem users are also facing the same problem (eg <br/>
Merns, Trifrost) while some didn&#39;t (eg Leshrec).  This problem can occurs <br/>
several times a night, or none at all.  On average I will have 2-3 <br/>
occurance every night.  Surprisingly sometime I got no freezing on <br/>
weekends, when the server is very crowded.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is related to some configurations (eg DataRate file) as well <br/>
as SCV modem.  I just wanna check with those EQ SCV users, what is your <br/>
datarate setting (5.0 to 9.0)?  Anyone else got the same problem?  If yes, <br/>
did you manage to solve this, thx!<br/>
