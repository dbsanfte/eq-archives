<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275343626">From my visit to KK...., Phinny and his 4 guardians are extremely MR so<br/>
apart from wizard lures, the other casters can do absoutely nothing. You<br/>
will need at least 3 groups, preferbly with 1 cleric, 1 chanter , 1 evaccer<br/>
and the rest tanks per group. It takes a HIGH 50 char to single pull the<br/>
guardians. or else you will get all 4 guardians and phinny. Good luck.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Just to make some noise here: Need tips to kill PA in Kedge Keep with 1<br/>
&gt; team:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. What is the best combo of this team, average lvl?<br/>
&gt; 2. Is the eye pulling method a bannable offence (ie use eye spell to pull<br/>
&gt; PA to zone in).<br/>
&gt; 3. Alternatively is to invis all the way to ledge, how siong is it to kill<br/>
&gt; the 4 SS, guardians and PA?<br/>
&gt; 4. Anything to watch out when fighting PA and its kakis?<br/>
&gt; 5. I thinking of parking a druid at KK zone in, with max 125 tracking<br/>
&gt; skill, I wonder if he can track PA from zone in or have to swim deeper to<br/>
&gt; track?  Is it true that all mobs in KK cannot see invis except guardians<br/>
&gt; and PA?  Is there any safe room near PA where I can invis a druid and park<br/>
&gt; there to check if PA is up?  If k, then it&#39;s better to track 1st then call<br/>
&gt; grp than the other way round.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thx.<br/>
