<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477443101">About MM faction, it depends on whether you have killed any MM guys before.<br/>
Killing about 50 in wolf form will make your faction threateningly. Usually<br/>
when you kill a bard you gain about 1 point of faction while killing a MM<br/>
guy may lose about 5 point  of faction (ratio)..... So just wolfform and con<br/>
a guy.<br/>
<br/>
You kill the dino for level 49 research words,pages,runes and he will<br/>
occasionally drop diamonds, jacinths and very nice gems.... and he spawns<br/>
very fast too about 4 min if ph doesnt spawn.<br/>
<br/>
For solo kiting wiz from 40 can do EK guards at the EK villages, gnome<br/>
guards or dwarf guards up to you depending on whose faction you wanna ruin.<br/>
The single spectre in ferrott is not too bad too cause they run pretty slow<br/>
giving you time to nuke, however ferrott terrain sucks making you run up and<br/>
down hills and spectres can suck your life which is irritating and increases<br/>
downtime. While pulling the spectre make sure you pull away from the spectre<br/>
cave so another spectre doesnt join you.<br/>
<br/>
Its root all the way coz its costs the least mana and its a level 4 spell<br/>
which means that no matter how bad u kenna whack , at level 50 99% you can<br/>
channel it off. I would believe that the resist rate of root is lower than<br/>
immobilize and enstill since its a lower level spell. However immobilize is<br/>
used cause its 1.8 sec compared to root 2.0 sec and immobilize can last<br/>
pretty  long (if you are lucky and you dont whack it[for separating spawns])<br/>
<br/>
I dont know about OOT stuff but i know therse a spectre island with 4<br/>
spectres together, pulling one will pull all i think. Theres also the<br/>
seafury cyclops island where level 40 cyclops spawn.... lots of hp and this<br/>
special level 37(?) named HG. I dont think they are good xp.. Maybe in a<br/>
group you can do seafury cyclops or the HG , dont think you can do that<br/>
solo.<br/>
<br/>
The preacher is a shaman or cleric and shaman mobs are wussies hehe. As long<br/>
as the stuff around preacher are green you should have no prob soloing them<br/>
in my opinion. Guarding the preacher should be level 24 (?) mobs so at about<br/>
34-36 they should be green.<br/>
<br/>
Hadden is about level 28. He spawns every 8 hours 20 mins + - 15 min due to<br/>
server lag. I dont have exact loc but in qeynos hills in the NW corner of<br/>
the map there is this enlongated lake and there will be this hut with a boat<br/>
beside it. He spawns outside the hut next to the boat, on land. Many people<br/>
believe that he drops the FB earring 50% but so far I have killed him 19<br/>
times and all have been FB earring. IMO simple camp and you can trade it for<br/>
VERY nice items even though its not that hard to get it. BUT since innoruuk<br/>
is a old server, you may/will face a problem of 5 level 50s all camping him<br/>
at the same time. Careful the FB earring is lore so if you intend to farm it<br/>
give it to your secondary char :)<br/>
<br/>
Most undead (except Befallen and yard trash in Unrest garden) will kill you<br/>
even if they are green/ultragreen to you. Befallen, however, I believe the<br/>
stuff there will not attack you because they belong to the<br/>
BefallenInhabitants faction.<br/>
<br/>
The method I mentioned is not an exploit. Its just a method of pulling the<br/>
mob. It will still come after you and hit you (not stuck). Its easier this<br/>
way because you dont have to chiong up the house staircase and risk getting<br/>
beaten up by green mobs (mobs outside dont hit you). He is pretty decent xp<br/>
but he will HT you... spawns very often and drops both the common drop (BS<br/>
mantle) and rare (BS tunic) pretty often. Hp maybe around 1200 and is good<br/>
till 36? Decent xp while camping for the mystic cloak mob.<br/>
<br/>
Well there is a kobold section, bug section, imp section and FG section<br/>
(naggy). The kobold section is the first section you will meet which<br/>
includes level 33-42 kobolds and the next section is the bug section.<br/>
Running without sow from the bug section to the zoneline is about 10-15 secs<br/>
at most so its pretty close. Bats are the lowest level around 39-41, lava<br/>
beetles 41-43, and lava duct crawlers 42-45. Bats have a 5-10 sec stun as a<br/>
proc, beetles a 100 dmg (?) fire DD proc while the LDC procs a 400+ or 600<br/>
dmg dot (blood boil).<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I have killed more than enuff bard so far (beyond repair liao), even the<br/>
&gt; green bard in Felwithe attacks me everytime I go near him, does that mean<br/>
&gt; my fraction with mistmoore is very good? ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I heard from Fesse that the dino in OOT give lousy loot, so no point to<br/>
&gt; camp for it, but it will be fun to form a grp to bangbang it for once or<br/>
&gt; twice, shiok ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m now 39, shld be getting my lvl 40 hell in 1 or 2 days time.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; solo kiting Ulir and Ein in WK.  I understand once I reach 42 Ulir will be<br/>
&gt; super green to me and give no xp.  What other places r there for a soli<br/>
&gt; kiting wiz from 40 to say, 45?  (NB: The single sprectre I heard is good<br/>
&gt; xp, under which lvl?  Thou&#39; pple said it&#39;s always camp but same thing is<br/>
&gt; said for barb village in WK yet I always can find a seat there w/o any<br/>
&gt; prob).  Anything to take note when kiting the single sprectre?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So at 39, I can solo ancient croc.  Btw, is root still good for my lvl?  I<br/>
&gt; mean, there are enstill and immobolize on top so which one is more<br/>
&gt; effective?  I heard some pple saying root is still better at high lvl<br/>
&gt; whereas others said it&#39;s often resisted by high lvl mobs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; OK, I give up on WK ogre, didn&#39;t know it&#39;s so high lvl.  Btw Mass say the<br/>
&gt; batskull is a rare drop...doesn&#39;t worth the time and effort. ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Seem like OOT got good kills and good loots for high 30s till mid 40s, can<br/>
&gt; elaborate further (both for wiz solo and grp).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fesse tell me must be at least lvl 40 to solo runed circlet (I know<br/>
&gt; halfling warrior who solo got it at 36 btw), so which is true?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Got the exact loc of Hadden?  What is his lvl?  How long is his spawn<br/>
time?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Btw, is it true tat super green undead will attack u regardless how high<br/>
ya<br/>
&gt; lvl is (in both bafallen and unrest)?  Or the normal rules applies (ie if<br/>
&gt; too high lvl, they won&#39;t attack u?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for unrest, is the method u mention an exploitt?  I read from the net<br/>
&gt; that sometime GM hide there and teleport u to the mobs instead.  ;(  Tat<br/>
&gt; knight good xp and money for what lvl till wat lvl, what&#39;s his hp and lvl?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wat abt the bug section in Sol b, can elaborate further?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ziltus, solo kiter...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p/s: I wonder other than febon, kell and mass, do we have anymore early<br/>
40s<br/>
&gt; members which we can form grp to explore the tougher dungone?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Heh theres no mob in Mistmoore called Mayong Mistmoore. Though mistmoore<br/>
&gt; &gt; stuff belong to Mayong Mistmoore faction, believed to be a level 53<br/>
&gt; vampire.<br/>
&gt; &gt; But in actual fact, Mistmoore is a very easy dungeon to solo at level<br/>
&gt; 50...<br/>
&gt; &gt; about 95% of the mobs in the castle are level 35 or below. Only problem<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; that you need to have wolf form and havent ruined mistmoore faction<br/>
&gt; before<br/>
&gt; &gt; so you dont agro everything around you.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Alliwaezeur (sp?) is always level 50 but has much less hp than an<br/>
average<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 50 mob... necro and maybe shamans are the only classes able to<br/>
solo<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 50 mob in 1 round without going oom<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For gator armor in Uguk, i recommend at least 39.... new nuke and you<br/>
&gt; should<br/>
&gt; &gt; be able to solo a level 30 ancient croc with root nuke<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For runed circlet, 32+? is good enough when you get your fire nuke and<br/>
&gt; able<br/>
&gt; &gt; to solo pull the mobs (ie. all green)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For fishbone earring, you almost must have jboots/sow or Rephas, an<br/>
&gt; &gt; enchanter beside Hadden is green to you so he wouldn&#39;t jump into the<br/>
&gt; &gt; fight... About high 30s for Rephas to be green to you i think...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wk ogre shaman you need about level 48+ to solo. 1) The 4 ogre guards<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt; agro everyone within their HUGE agro radius (as huge as the furthest<br/>
&gt; point<br/>
&gt; &gt; you can nuke them from) 2) If the ogre guards are green only 1 will come<br/>
&gt; &gt; after you and give you a nasty HT 3) Magic resist gear is very important<br/>
&gt; &gt; since you are taking a lot of HTs 4) If the shamans and chief goonda is<br/>
&gt; &gt; still blue to you they will jump in as well 5) Assuming you are level<br/>
48+<br/>
&gt; &gt; where everything is green to you, you pull 1 ogre guard, kill, 1 ogre<br/>
&gt; guard,<br/>
&gt; &gt; then try to pull either goonda or the shaman directly beside him. 6)<br/>
&gt; Ultra<br/>
&gt; &gt; tough camp if you are soloing.. no clarity and no heal and hard to keep<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; &gt; with spawns 7) Very long spawn time...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; OOT oracle and his body guard. oracle is 35 guard is 42. lose neriak<br/>
&gt; &gt; merchants faction i think when you kill them. I recommend only trying<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; after getting ice comet as oracle is a nuker. Elemental shield and<br/>
&gt; &gt; diamondskin up. Root the guard. And kite the oracle using root nuke or<br/>
&gt; run<br/>
&gt; &gt; nuke. After oracle is dead immediately gate out or if you feel confident<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; can kill the guard who drops standard level 40+ mob jewelry (mithril<br/>
&gt; amulet<br/>
&gt; &gt; 92pp to merchants) If root breaks then you have to be skilful to try to<br/>
&gt; root<br/>
&gt; &gt; the guard without taking too much damage from oracleagain.....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; OOT dunnoe what ogre heh but theres a special named Hill Giant who<br/>
spawns<br/>
&gt; &gt; very often.. Kite nuke at level 49+ with ice comet<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; No pet in unrest means serious downtime for you have to clear all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; greenies. But if you intend to camp the undead knight theres a trick...<br/>
&gt; At<br/>
&gt; &gt; about level 40 where most mobs are green to you, cast levitate on<br/>
&gt; yourself<br/>
&gt; &gt; and walk to the hill with a stream downwards in the garden (east of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; map), standing at the highest point of the small hill, you can target<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; knight or his ph and nuke it, after a while the knight will go down the<br/>
&gt; &gt; stairs and come out the door and look for you, since all mobs should be<br/>
&gt; &gt; green nothing will agro you and you can kite nuke in the garden. Seems<br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt; normal invis works for about 40% of the mobs (the weaker mobs like<br/>
&gt; mummies<br/>
&gt; &gt; and dark bones) in there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Befallen is pretty easy but you have to find a good place to med or else<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; will get whacked. Level 30+ you can solo everything including bottom<br/>
&gt; floor.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sola .. some parts like foreman and predator only need about 30+ to solo<br/>
&gt; &gt; camp but if you wanna do lava elemental, gabbie and maybe some parts of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; castle, you will need to have ice comet...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; SG is simply kite nuke kite nuke but bad xp and not efficient in terms<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; time you have to med up (SG has much more hp than same level mob) / heal<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; &gt; (if you get hit) / and the time you spend trying to gain speed so you<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; &gt; nuke the SG<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe SolB you can do that since bugs section is pretty close to<br/>
&gt; lavastorm<br/>
&gt; &gt; zone line. Maybe can pull bats, beetles and if you feel powerful you can<br/>
&gt; try<br/>
&gt; &gt; lava duct crawlers...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The lvl 50ishs in guild always busy hunting in planes or dragons, ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thought of hunting some other lvl 50ish+ mobs in Norrath?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Eg<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - &quot;Gozilla&quot; (a dinosaur) in OOT, &gt;lvl 50<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - Mist Castle Lord, the lvl 50 dracula<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - etc<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Btw, what&#39;s the min lvl for wiz to solo the following zones/mobs:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - Lguk (think it&#39;s time to camp for some gator armors)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - Permafrost (for runed circlet)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - Hadden (for fishbone earring)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - WK Ogre shaman (for batskull earring, what&#39;s the min lvl for me to<br/>
&gt; &gt; attack<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ths shaman while the other 5 guards won&#39;t swarm against me?)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - OOT Oracle and her body guard (heard oracle robe is good money)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - OOT ogre and hill giant<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - Unrest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - Befallen<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - Sol A<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - SG in Sro/Oasis (kite and nuke)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thx.<br/>

to<br/>
