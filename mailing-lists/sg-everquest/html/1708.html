<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053946724"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Ive got a friend who wants to play EQ but well he didnt manage<br/>

does it work?Thx in advance<br/>
<br/>
I think most local banks should now offer debit cards, but you <br/>
might want to check with DBS first... I vaguely recall them <br/>
advertising it.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, a debit card account is like a current account, but <br/>
instead of writing checks, you flash your credit card.<br/>
<br/>
Like a current account, you must have cash in the account before <br/>
you start signing your name every-which-way. However, unlike a <br/>
current account, you can use this money anywhere credit cards <br/>
are accepted.<br/>
<br/>
Because you must put your money with the bank first, you do not <br/>
need to fulfill all those stringent requirements that credit card <br/>
owners must.<br/>
<br/>
Ask your friend to visit the websites of local banks, starting with <br/>
DBS/POSB. If that fails, call their customer service line... they&#39;re <br/>
only too willing to talk to new people from whom they can su... I <br/>
mean, who they can help financially.<br/>
