<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374901086">You can get up to 6pp  (3pp and 30+ gold) in 1 tree.<br/>
1/3 Chance of getting a lightstone worth about 9.5 gp to NPC.<br/>
1/10 chance of getting a great staff worth 17pp to NPC.<br/>
Woodshards are useless unless desperate for money (Destroy them)<br/>
<br/>
Fraction lost is not much to me. I play an Erudite wizard and never gonna<br/>
intend on going back to Qeynos or Surefall Glade anymore. And after<br/>
killing like 500+ treants. Treants Kos me. Qeynos guards judge me amiably.<br/>
Surefall Glade guards judge me amiably. That place is suitable for levels 24<br/>
to 33. At 34 no more xp.<br/>
<br/>
When hunting treants, cast see invs before any buffs. Then buff fully, then<br/>
off see invs and memorise cancel magic. If they dot you cast cancel magic<br/>
and dot is gone. You can cancel dot on pet too.<br/>
<br/>
I get about 1/4 a bub of xp when grouping with another guy around 2 levels<br/>
lower than me killing 2 treants each time at levels 30,31.<br/>
Slightly slower at levels 32 and 33 but much faster than dungeons and<br/>
virtually no chance of death, though its quite boring but the cash justifies<br/>
for it.<br/>

You can hunt in Beholder. Easier than treants. First time you go there, the<br/>
2 eyes will have pet. Kill one eye quick (2 frost shock + 1 magi spell<br/>
should kill it) then enstill pet, go to the other side and med and wait for<br/>
pet to autodie. The other eye will not join in the fight. Do the same for<br/>
the other eye.<br/>
<br/>
After 2 eyes are dead go up in between the eyes to med to avoid those<br/>
irritating minotaurs. See one with axe and feel happy? Shoot them for easy<br/>
3pp to NPC (mino axe) Catch the eyes as they spawn before they summon pet.<br/>
Shoot them from your medding position in between the 2 eyes (their spawn<br/>
location is very obviously fixed)<br/>
Repeat process and get xp, loot about 5gp to 3pp, get gems, get runes words<br/>
pages, get polished bone hoop, get polished bone bracer (very good item).<br/>
onyx ring, quartz crystal.<br/>
<br/>
Just beware of their charm. So keep cancel magic memorised. If you are<br/>
charmed dont cast any spells. Charm should be easy to resist though because<br/>
of our high magic resist.<br/>

&gt; Yep, the place has good xp, but not really good loot.  Coins are good, up<br/>
&gt; to 3pp, but I dun get any magical artifacts or fine steel weaps.  Worse is<br/>
&gt; the faction msg I got, feel kinda uneasy.  So in the end hunt for 1 hr<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; Flyingfox and ciao liao.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those who dun bother abt faction (mainly with the druids), the trees<br/>
&gt; are lvl 24 to 28 I think.  They cast swarming which is a DoT spell, as<br/>
well<br/>
&gt; as AE spells (have to run away from those burning areas will do).  Most<br/>
&gt; impt is to have 2 faster nukers - we try with a lvl 26 wiz, a lvl 24 magi<br/>
&gt; and a lvl 24 earth pet, quite easy as the mobs have low HP.  2 casts from<br/>
&gt; each of us, at most, will slain 1 tree, while the pet tank.  The trees<br/>
&gt; spawn in pair, at specific location.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Personally speaking I think they hit very hard, the earth pet always<br/>
leaves<br/>
&gt; less than 40% HP after every battle and the trees spawn faster than we can<br/>
&gt; recover (mainly have to wait for pet to regain HP).  Other than coins,<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; also give wood shards (anyone know wat it&#39;s for?) and light stone (can<br/>
sell<br/>
&gt; at 1pp to PC and 9gp to NPC).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you are interested to hunt for some quick XP, here is the loc:<br/>
&gt; When you zone from NK to SK, turn left and run all the way.  The camp is<br/>
&gt; somewhere 2-3 screen from the leftmost corner.  It&#39;s often filled with DE<br/>
&gt; casters as they dun really bother about the faction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ziltus (7th circle nuker)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p/s: Anyone can suggest a good hunting ground for a lvl 26 wiz and lvl 24<br/>
&gt; magi combo (with a lvl 24 pet if necessary)?  Places with random<br/>
&gt; spawns/trains are not suitable for us (eg dungeons), our death experiences<br/>
&gt; have tested it ;)  Preferably some camps with fixed mobs, good xp and good<br/>
&gt; loot, hehe, say between lvl 24 to lvl 28 mobs (we can get more pple if the<br/>
&gt; mobs are of higher lvls).  Thx.<br/>
