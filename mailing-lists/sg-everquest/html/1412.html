<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842466297">If you want to fight Najena, you better get 2-3 nukers along. She got some <br/>
kakis guarding here, Necro or Mage and each of them have a pet.So makes a <br/>
grand total of abt. 5-7 MOBs in total. Plus, last I heard, she can cast and <br/>
melee also, plus she can HarmTouch ppl. Sometimes she can do up to 4-7 HT in <br/>
a round alone, but rare lar. Average is abt. 2-3. Want to kill her better <br/>
get some REAL serious firepower to kill her hor, HP wise is around <br/>
2000-2500(estimate). Expect to lose a few ppl. in fighting her, her HT kicks <br/>
some serious butt.<br/>
The Oracle in OOT is around 34-36. Don&#39;t think of soloing him, he got <br/>
someone protecting him one, abt. 30-31 level guy. Small fries I don&#39;t know, <br/>
but I think a few level 20ish MOB around the oracle also.<br/>
FBR is a rare drop on Najena(I think) So hunting J.Boots that time also can <br/>
hunt for FBR.<br/>
Staff of Observer? A rare spawn EvilEye in the King&#39;s room in RunnyEye has <br/>
it on him occasionally. He can charm, summon pet and get all his Goblins <br/>
kakis to help him kill you. Level around low 30s. Not sure, but don&#39;t think <br/>
of soloing him.<br/>
This one is rumor, there is another way of getting StaffofObserver. Go to <br/>
Paw underwater room. Kill the HighShaman there and wait for the Drow Nixx to <br/>
spawn. If you see the Drow wearing a staff, if may be StaffofObserver. Just <br/>
rumor only hor, try if you have the time. DrowNixx is around 20-24 in level <br/>
and he got some bitching Rune 2 or 3 protecting him. I tried to kill it at <br/>
18 with 3 others. All end up Gating out :p</div>
