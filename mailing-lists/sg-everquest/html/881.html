<b>Subject:</b> Re: new uncamp places?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-360770901">I suggest North Ro Derv Camp next to mountain for lvl 10-15.  I earned my <br/>
lvl 13, 14 and 15 there, still giving me so-so xp and good loot at lvl 15. <br/>
 I hunt with Ser/Einan.  They team and we take turn to kill.  Sometime the <br/>
place can be quite crowded and pple can just come in without any words and <br/>
start hunting themselves (ie act blur even they see we already there).  For <br/>
this type of pple wiz always got the best mean to teach them a lesson - <br/>
steal their kills when they hunt monsters ard 40% dam, hehe.  No joke, even <br/>
a lvl 19 warrior lost kill to me, hehehe.  I guess that&#39;s the best <br/>
&#39;ability&#39; a wiz pocess. ;)<br/>
Once I get lvl 16, I will go camp 2 since there is more thugs spawning <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Above lvl 16 I dunno, still havent reach there.<br/>
<br/>
I think Oasis hunting caimen and croc also not bad xp for lvl 10-15, but <br/>
the loot is pretty lousy.<br/>
<br/>
So far I&#39;m quite &#39;conservative&#39; in hunting - only been to BB, G Faydark, <br/>
CB, EC, WC, Ro and Oasis.  Places like Guk or L Faydark not counted coz I <br/>
go there kena killed very fast - not to mentioned any xp or loot.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s time we go Ak&#39;Anon for some mino hunting?  Garren, Yiyang and <br/>
Leshrec can take mino knight/hero while the rest take mino slave, hehe. <br/>
 Alternatively is to go back CB hunt trainer (for small shinny shield) and <br/>
derv - always wanna go back CB hunt coz I died too many times there, can&#39;t <br/>
forget the damn place, haha.  If u like role-playing quest, I dun mind we <br/>
go back CB one day and do the quest for screaming mace.  I think that will <br/>
be the best item currently we can give to our SOWer Trifrost and healer <br/>
Einan (must get this healer lvl up fast).<br/>
<br/>
Tonight I will con&#39;t to brew for 1-2 hrs b4 going to Ro derv camp again. <br/>
 Ser & Ein, join me if interested ;)<br/>
