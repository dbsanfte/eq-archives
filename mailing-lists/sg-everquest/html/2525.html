<div id="ygrps-yiv-479874689">Time: 20 00 CST, 9th of October Saturday<br/>
Server: Innoruuk<br/>
Event: Guild meeting + farewell party for Trifrost<br/>
Meeting place: South Karana Plains, at the centaur village<br/>
<br/>
Note that ALL on Inno should attend. We would have a meeting to discuss<br/>
some of the crap we have never get to agree on (guild requirements, SOS<br/>
calls, member position blah blah blah).<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t give me the pathetic excuse of &quot;I want to level so I cannot<br/>
attend&quot; I take that as a clear sign of munchkinism, and I don&#39;t tolerate<br/>
that.<br/>
