<div id="ygrps-yiv-703619679">Roleplaying a taxi is good lah, anyway, I sort of miss your perverted jokes.<br/>
Zan is trying to fill in for that but his jokes still not as R(A) as yours.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, try to log in sometime and do the Sol quest. A bit of camping is<br/>
involve but it&#39;s fun to do if you can drag kakis along. Also, if you want to<br/>
catch up on leveling, just drop me a tell. You sit at a corner of Unrest<br/>
Basement and I pull the whole place for you to kill for xp.<br/>

&gt; *tsk tsk*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What to say leh?  No motivation to login leh.  Think of the camping and<br/>
&gt; lvling also sian liao.  Esp so many kakis already reach lvl 40 plus, me too<br/>
&gt; weak to hunt those big mobs with u guys, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I didn&#39;t login EQ, and seldom login UO too (coz very laggy due to some<br/>
&gt; hardware problems at server side).  Every night play Revenant, very cool<br/>
&gt; game, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess I also lost track with all the new stuffs in EQ (heard there is<br/>
&gt; dunno simi new temple, new quests etc).  Anyone can advise me what to do<br/>
&gt; when I login, other than role-playing a public transport? ;P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Freddy invited me into AC mailing list I also dun dare to join, scare to<br/>
&gt; kena hook-up again (took me so long to &#39;lose&#39; some interest in EQ and UO),<br/>
&gt; hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ziltus<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p/s: Also busy with my RL house renovation ;)  If I dun get everything done<br/>
&gt; by X&#39;mas, next year I have to stay in those cheapskate Hotel 81 liao, hehe.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Not in any particular order: Leshrec, Yutaka, Ziltus, Shinji, Trifrost<br/>
&gt; &gt; and Ling has went MIA from Innoruuk for way too long.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Trifrost and Ling has more or less state their excuse, what about the<br/>
&gt; &gt; rest of you for still being MIA?<br/>
