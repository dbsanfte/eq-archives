<b>Subject:</b> My opinion on the new quest that replace Rubicite <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-342926794">For rangers, their quest is damn easy, except for the greaves and boots<br/>
quest. Saw many rangers getting most of the Ivy Etched in 2 days with<br/>
some teleporting aid.<br/>
<br/>
Shaman quest is relatively easy. Mostly involve buying some items + a<br/>
piece of banded armor + a rare item from a common mob. Problem is that<br/>
Trolls and Ogres are KOS by the NPC who gives the quest which IMO is the<br/>
right thing to do. Trolls and Ogres are just too dumb to use advance<br/>
armor.<br/>
<br/>
SK as usual are the most screwed up. The skeleton that gives the quest<br/>
spawns semi rarely and is usually killed........<br/>
<br/>
Paly quest is a major pain since they involve faction AND have to kill<br/>
mobs to get the items to trade for the mold AND have to figure out what<br/>
the heck to do with the mold (Hint: There&#39;s a shorty you should visit<br/>
some where)<br/>
<br/>
Cleric one is about as screwed up as Paly. Half of the items needed are<br/>
items that pop up in a place and if the item is taken away, it takes 6<br/>
hrs for it to respawn. On top of that, only 2 armor parts are easily<br/>
obtainable and the stats is disappointing......<br/>
<br/>
Warrior still have their crafted and with the new stat bonus, I wonder<br/>
why the heck is cleric&#39;s one so hard to quest for compare to<br/>
crafted......<br/>
<br/>
Rouge armor as most of you know now spawn in CT as a replacement for<br/>
Rubicite. Interesting thing is that the chestguard has an<br/>
&quot;Effect:         &quot; line there. Maybe it has the rubicite aura effect<br/>
like the old armor. Anyone care to clarify?<br/>
<br/>
Also, the casters quest are quite easy to get, except those that<br/>
involves Shadow man since shadow man items are no rent.<br/>
<br/>
The jboots quest is interesting. A quest leading to 2 other. I don&#39;t<br/>
have the full spoiler but at it&#39;s current stage, only high level players<br/>
will have the patient to get it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about all on my opinion which as usual is bias.</div>
