<div id="ygrps-yiv-764293896">I can agreed wit u in most part.<br/>
<br/>
Accept for some points which we differs that r personal view. i cannot say<br/>
that u r wrong. It just a point where we differ.<br/>
<br/>
There is this element of char role-playing . somehow im more &quot;acceptable&quot; to<br/>
Evil char having bad practices than a &quot;Good&quot; char like a Paladin or monk.<br/>
well i have seen asshole Monk around.<br/>
<br/>
I agreed wit u and Garren on groups and FFA. I once when into HH pass and<br/>
asked if the Groups there (more than 1)  are &quot;Splitting&quot; kills. They said<br/>
nope. is FFA. All the groups r full or not avaible. so Im solo to go against<br/>
them. That I think is VERy FAIR game. that sessions was FFA for all Orcs.<br/>
That is COMPETITIONS. i can accept that that kind of attitude and gameplay.<br/>
It only like what u have describe when a Tank(me) did enuff damages than a<br/>
caster waiting invis or med cast a kill on my &#39;con THAT is stealin.<br/>
<br/>
You did open up some perceptive for me to consider, from the point of view<br/>
as a wiz or a magic caster. I have only played a monk and not any other char<br/>
b4. Those views are refreshing and i have to admit, it did some adjustment<br/>
to my views of things.<br/>
Like UO,  good game should have differing Morals views on stuff.That, I<br/>
would truly enjoy. Thx u leshrec for your refreshing view.<br/>
<br/>
NOW, Pass me that bloody parang, im gotta chop em&#39; stealin ( i meant REAL<br/>
stealin) %$#$#% Thieves and Prositutes.hehehe<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is a rather long post. You have been warned =)<br/>
&gt;This is that I think of steal killing in Highhold. If a tank or warriors<br/>
&gt;starts attacking the mob, then I don&#39;t think its wrong to blast it, IF you<br/>
&gt;start blasting when hes just started on the mob. This is for a very simple<br/>
&gt;reason, if all the mob he attacks is gonna by his, he will get everything,<br/>
&gt;especially those in groups, where there are clerics in it. Since there is<br/>
&gt;practically no downtime. Anyways, if you start blasting it, the mob will<br/>

&gt;are just helping you to get kill. I have seen orc fanatics that have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>spawned<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and die in 1 sec after, becos 6-7 casters shoot at it at the same time.<br/>
&gt;Usually the player who does the most damage with one spell , usually the<br/>
&gt;magician or the wizard would get branded a stealer just because he is a<br/>
&gt;loner and has no group. Of course those assholes which are really out to<br/>
&gt;steal kill can be seen very obviously, like what ziltus has mentioned,<br/>
&gt;waiting for tank to do 20-30% damage before shooting. However, In my<br/>
 </span></blockquote>opinion<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;if i shoot a mob when you are just starting on it and I kill it after he<br/>
&gt;beats on me, although a tank type or some other caster shoots at it, I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>don&#39;t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;really care if you brand me a kill stealer. If I spend 30% of my mana on a<br/>
&gt;mob instead of 80%, its not because I want to, but rather its because other<br/>
&gt;caster are trying to blast my mob, so that they can get kill and when they<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t get it, they get pissed and call you names again. Thats why its very<br/>
&gt;important to get a group, since you have your own tankers tanking and you<br/>
&gt;nuking. As for named NPC, its FFA but when you do get the kill ppl will<br/>
&gt;curse and swear saying they waited 20 hrs for the named NPC. Well, If you<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t get the kill yourself, get a damn caster who can nuke for you. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;sick of ppl whining cos they can&#39;t get kills especially when I shoot at the<br/>
&gt;named one and even when he comes to me, the other tanks from other groups<br/>
&gt;continue to beat at him and expect to get kill. I myself have always<br/>

&gt;scouts. Seeing he was about to lose, I became visible (I am invis when<br/>
&gt;medding) and he asked for help. Of course I helped him out, but he still<br/>
&gt;called me names later on. However that was the only time I soloed like that<br/>
&gt;and of course it was very lonely not to mention getting tells on &quot;Thats not<br/>
&gt;very nice. But I don&#39;t think you care anyways&quot; Well, hes right on I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;care. I once heard of a guy in Nektulos forest saying &quot;If I can train a<br/>
&gt;skeleton on you. Then its your problem&quot;. If that is one guy attitude, there<br/>
&gt;must be many others who have this type of attitude too.THat happened when I<br/>
&gt;was in Prexus server playing my necro. I myself have kenna like that, I sit<br/>
&gt;on floor medding and suddenly 2 skeletons jump on me. I was like level 6-7<br/>
&gt;and that meant instant death. Of course the skeletons were not spawned on<br/>

&gt;you don&#39;t wanna share your loot, DON&#39;T GROUP and DON&#39;T whine if you can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;get the kill. If you want to steal kill, go make a wizard or magician or<br/>
&gt;druid and see how hard it is to get your XP, especially at the lower<br/>
 </span></blockquote>levels.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I have seen a druid which purposely did 50% of damage and let tanks finish<br/>
&gt;it off, so that he could get the xp, and he was soloing. Another time at<br/>
&gt;gnolls, my friend received tells from another group on how he can&#39;t get the<br/>
&gt;kill on the named NPC because that guy had a druid friend which he claimed<br/>
&gt;could outblast him. So my friend ask me to help him get the kill and we did<br/>
&gt;get the named NPC. Of course this resulted in the other group being<br/>
&gt;extremely unhappy and cursed at us. However in the end we still got what we<br/>
&gt;wanted and the other group with nothing.<br/>
