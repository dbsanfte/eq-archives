<div id="ygrps-yiv-633888054">Hello Garren,<br/>
<br/>
A few quick questions.<br/>
<br/>
1. Have you acutally cancelled your EQ a/c? So you&#39;re absolutely sure you&#39;re<br/>
not coming back ever?<br/>
If that is the case, i will distribute your stuff sooner than 1 week but<br/>
only if you confirm here<br/>
that you will absolutely not return anymore.<br/>
<br/>
2. You put a Luna on my list and i have only seen a Lunatictiara on who so<br/>
far...<br/>
is this the same Luna you want to give your Rubicite Helm to? Kindly<br/>
confirm..<br/>
<br/>
3. Will you be on this mailint list still or are you also going to cancel<br/>
the subscription?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess that&#39;s it for my questions. I wish you&#39;d change your mind friend but<br/>
I understand your<br/>
feelings. Perhaps it really takes one real nasty experience to get ppl off<br/>
EQ even when<br/>
they have been thinking about it for awhile. I experienced it when camping<br/>
Jboots 12 hrs<br/>
and then getting &quot;voted&quot; out of the queue by some selfish asses after i fell<br/>
asleep for awhile<br/>
despite having done most of the killing and work and having been in first<br/>
position 4 hrs.<br/>
I still will have my revenge! Heh...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wish you all the best Garren be it in another MMORPG in future or in real<br/>
life.<br/>
But  most important of all you get to enjoy your REAL life now =)<br/>
Not the alternate one we&#39;ve been wasting time on hehe..Evercrack it is!<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards,<br/>
Zand<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Dued to my failure at PoF which got alot of ppl into trouble<br/>
&gt; (which<br/>
&gt; &gt; involved dying and losing the major portion of their stuff) and with<br/>
&gt; little<br/>
&gt; &gt; else to do (except like camping for stuff, which I have gotten very sick<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; tired of), I have cancelled my account as from today, Oct 26th 1999.<br/>
Zand,<br/>
&gt; &gt; please give out the items to the people as I have listed down with you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Especially Weadaenye, whom I&#39;m guilty as hell to got her into a living<br/>
&gt; hell.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Please help me tell the follow people of my quiting and hope to<br/>
&gt; see<br/>
&gt; &gt; them again sometime on another game another time and Best wishes to<br/>
them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Daedor, Aildiin, Iyenya, Ironbuket, Hoppy, Kitiarra, Stella,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Saintly, Valadine, Millie, Silph, Lunatictiara, Ader, Fost, Sparrow,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Demitry, Wlyven, Anima and Nismo/Volk (they are brothers sharing the<br/>
same<br/>
&gt; &gt; account).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Everquest was, had been and enjoyable game at the beginning but<br/>
&gt; due<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the way that the game is designed it reminds me more of Evercamp,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Everbitch etc etc. It has become a torture to enter the &quot;game&quot; each day<br/>
&gt; now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This incident has at least freed me from Evercrack as some would say it<br/>
&gt; is.<br/>
&gt; &gt; So farewell my fellow guildmates. And may your time in Everquest be as<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; first day, with new and exciting adventures each day.<br/>
