&gt; Subject: [sg-everquest] S&#39;pore Diablo 2 Guild (Client/server, non-hard-core<br/>
&gt; mode)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; After playing my char to lvl 12 in the recent D2 stress test, here are my<br/>
&gt; &gt; findings:<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1. The game in stress test is easy, far too easy.  Even my newbie char can<br/>
&gt; &gt; clear all the dungeon with ease, solve both quests and kill all the<br/>
&gt; bosses.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I believe the retailed version will be much tougher.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2. The game is far too easy, and this make teaming a redundant choice.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Most of the players I&#39;ve teamed with so far (with the intention to enjoy<br/>
&gt; &gt; team work) end up with 2 outcomes:<br/>
&gt; &gt; There isn&#39;t enough xp/items/mobs/bosses to be shared among us.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pker(s) reveal his true color in the hunting ground and the game turn to a<br/>
&gt; &gt; predator vs prey game.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now I do understand pvp is part of the game, like UO, period.  But I<br/>
&gt; &gt; believe players shld also be given the rights to decide if they wanna play<br/>
&gt; &gt; a pvp+ or pvp- games, like in EQ.  Unfortunately D2 do not support this<br/>
&gt; &gt; concept.  As a matter of fact, even UO now recognise the need and demand<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; pvp- gameplay and that&#39;s why the recent huge patch has divide UO world<br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2, a pvp+ world and a pvp- world.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Since this concept is not implemented in D2, I guess we can still make it<br/>
&gt; &gt; comes true.  What I&#39;m suggesting now is to form an Singapore D2<br/>
&gt; &gt; organization, (guild, clan, whatever you call it).  The objective is<br/>
&gt; &gt; simple:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1. For those who don&#39;t wanna play under the fear of been pk&#39;d, or enjoy<br/>
&gt; &gt; cooperative games, this organization will provide you with trust-worthy<br/>
&gt; &gt; companions which you can hunt safely under a cooperation mode.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2. For those who enjoy pk, to ensure you dun get to pk our own pple, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; you can find some trust-worthy companions which will fight on ya side<br/>
&gt; &gt; (instead of group with one unknown player to pk others, and when only 2 of<br/>
&gt; &gt; you are left in the game, he turn his blade and stuck it into ya back?).<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3. For those who wanna enjoy both #1 and #2, we provide you will<br/>
&gt; &gt; trust-worthy companions for cooperative mode, either for mobs hunt or pk<br/>
&gt; &gt; hunt ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As for the guildname, I&#39;m opened to suggestion, subject to one condition,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the name must be easily identified as a S&#39;pore guild so we won&#39;t end up<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a situation fighting our own pple ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So anyone interested?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; P/S: This guild for Blizzard client/server b.net mode only (ie chars saved<br/>
&gt; &gt; in Blizzard server to avoid cheating) and it&#39;s not a hard-core guild (ie<br/>
&gt; &gt; not the die once die forever mode, I believe someone already set a<br/>
&gt; &gt; hard-core guild out there for those interested).<br/>
