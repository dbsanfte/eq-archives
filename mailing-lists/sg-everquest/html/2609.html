<div id="ygrps-yiv-843152006">Me have one thing to say EQ is fun if u dunt camp for items like me everyday kill go<br/>
diff places sumtimes sick of sol b go guk sick of guk go karanas still sick go spam<br/>
guildsay =), bottomline is dunt everyday log on think of i want to camp this i was<br/>
to camp that. i stopped lvling to wait for ppl like fesse,DF,FF,Galarion, Kailligan<br/>
to catch up then can organise guild trip to places heck if all 50 fesse can show us<br/>
POF somemore ppl in innoruk are idiots like merlain who like to kamikaze in POF so<br/>
much. So take my advice take some time off lvling do some fun things like recently<br/>
guild trip to WK ogres we managed to PL bibi and kell and got some nice stuff for<br/>
ourselves =). Like fesse tell me item not impt having fun with the game is.<br/>

&gt; Don&#39;t you think this is a bit rashed? I chao chao also have endure EQ for nearly<br/>
&gt; 2 years now and stil manage to tahan the camping etc..... by NOT camping for<br/>
&gt; items unless friends are camping or if soloing for XP, spam guildsay or talk<br/>
&gt; cock with other people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They way with EQ is as you say level level level then at 50 camp items blah blah<br/>
&gt; blah, but you can do other things like run around the various karana plains and<br/>
&gt; admire the sight or enter a low level dungeon and help newbies survive, else if<br/>
&gt; you everday camp item also can go gila.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can also do the long boring quest that eq has, heck, if you want to kill<br/>
&gt; Lucan, just send a tell and I help take 1 HT from him before dying......<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Else do the most common thing people do when they are sick of EQ, restart! This<br/>
&gt; time around, go more slowly, wait for kakis to join up, play a diferent class,<br/>
&gt; go to other hunting grounds you have never hunt in before. This will make it<br/>
&gt; slightly more enjoyable and is a good chance to meet up with new people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The over level 30 population in Inno is now at at all time low with you<br/>
&gt; leaving....... Once either Zan, FF or Merns leave, I better pack up and zhao as<br/>
&gt; well.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bottomline, get your arse back into EQ and slave with the rest of us........ and<br/>
&gt; if you do return, don&#39;t play for so long, play for shorter periods and forcus<br/>
&gt; more of fun and interaction.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;         Dued to my failure at PoF which got alot of ppl into trouble<br/>
&gt; &gt; (which<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; involved dying and losing the major portion of their stuff) and with<br/>
&gt; &gt; little<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; else to do (except like camping for stuff, which I have gotten very sick<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tired of), I have cancelled my account as from today, Oct 26th 1999. Zand,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; please give out the items to the people as I have listed down with you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Especially Weadaenye, whom I&#39;m guilty as hell to got her into a living<br/>
&gt; &gt; hell.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;         Please help me tell the follow people of my quiting and hope to<br/>
&gt; &gt; see<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them again sometime on another game another time and Best wishes to them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Demitry, Wlyven, Anima and Nismo/Volk (they are brothers sharing the same<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; account).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;         Everquest was, had been and enjoyable game at the beginning but<br/>
&gt; &gt; due<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the way that the game is designed it reminds me more of Evercamp,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Everbitch etc etc. It has become a torture to enter the &quot;game&quot; each day<br/>
&gt; &gt; now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This incident has at least freed me from Evercrack as some would say it<br/>
&gt; &gt; is.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So farewell my fellow guildmates. And may your time in Everquest be as<br/>
&gt; &gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; first day, with new and exciting adventures each day.<br/>
