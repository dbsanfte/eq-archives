<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963342334">Hi Ziltus!!<br/>
<br/>
Stealing is when you attack someone else&#39;s target which they are currently<br/>
fighting is it?<br/>
If i see one first and nuke it before anyone else touches it...it&#39;s not<br/>
considered<br/>
stealing?Just need to clarify...i&#39;m not that high lvl yet and i&#39;m only a<br/>
magician<br/>
but i think we&#39;re supposed to be the next nukers after wiz. Not too sure<br/>
though.<br/>
I never interrupt someone&#39;s battle unless it looks like they really need<br/>
help so<br/>
i guess it&#39;s ok hmmmm....<br/>
<br/>
BTW...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So if the newcomers come across this kinda CB players, it&#39;s wiser<br/>
to move on to another camp, coz it&#39;s only waste of time to stay there (u<br/>
are helpnig him to kill only).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This CB is CrushBone right? *Innocent look* LOL<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m now based at HH, soloing.  Downtime is long but get all the xp.<br/>
&gt;  Actually if wiz wanna play punk we can rise lvl pretty fast, by stealing<br/>
&gt; (huh? Leshrec is rising lvl fast? well...errr..hehehehe).  So far what I<br/>
&gt; did is to attack the moment when the mob spawn, which normally draw the<br/>
mob<br/>
&gt; to me and turn to a melee + casting battle.  This way is quite ok, but<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; pple at Ro still call me a stealer.  They forget that my down time is so<br/>
&gt; long (normally used up at least 80% of my mana and 1-2 bubb of my HP).<br/>
For<br/>
&gt; this kinda pple I normally scold back or use the ignore command on them.<br/>
&gt;  Those wizs in HH really &quot;aim&#39; nicely and start nuking when the mob hp<br/>
drop<br/>
&gt; by 30-40% (At one time I just sit next to them and observe how they hunt).<br/>
&gt;  Btw the time mob turn to them, the mob only left 10-20% HP.  If I were to<br/>
&gt; follow their style, I think I will lvl much faster, coz this method means<br/>
&gt; they just nuke 2 times (hurt more than 50%) and let others finish their<br/>
&gt; kill, and they got less down time and more loot.  H/w, this method also<br/>
&gt; spoil a wiz reputation and not very nice to do, so I choose the harder<br/>
way.<br/>
&gt;  So for all the new comers out there, pls do not make noise if a wiz is<br/>
&gt; using his body to tank and got a kill just becoz he kill faster then u.<br/>
&gt;  Make him frustrated he may change his mind and start &quot;stealing&quot; from u,<br/>
&gt; hehe.  If u wish to take turns to kill, pls ask when u enter a camp.  Me<br/>
&gt; personally quite bo chap if those high lvl players just step in and start<br/>
&gt; hunting.  My opinion is - if they just step in and hunt, they are trying<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; compete for kills, so no need to give way.  I ever come across a necro<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; Higher Order of Arcane at lvl 16 (name is Malten), and he spam me for<br/>
&gt; stealing his kill, simply becoz I nuke and his pet attack same time.  Of<br/>
&gt; coz, my nuking is far more damaging than his little pet, draw the mob to<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; and he spam all the way.  So irritating that I use the ignore command on<br/>
&gt; him, heheh.  Btw, one of the big stealers at HH now is Senear, the lvl 17<br/>
&gt; wiz, also from Higher Order of Arcane.  He and another guildmate of his<br/>
&gt; were nuking whole day at HH yesterday.  They steal from groups of lvl<br/>
&gt; 18-20+ melee fighters.  In the end the other groups all invite me to join<br/>
&gt; theirs becoz they can see I only nuke and dun steal, and my nuking plus<br/>
&gt; their melee can take back some kills.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last piece of advice, if u are camping at certain spot, and a wiz of lvl<br/>
16<br/>
&gt; (below lvl 16 we still quite sux, hehe) and above is also camping there,<br/>
&gt; either ask for rotation or move elsewhere.  A wiz can steal from a melee<br/>
&gt; char of 8-10 lvl above him.  No joke.  Even if you are are in a full house<br/>
&gt; of melee chars of the same lvl as that wiz, the wiz can still steal, if he<br/>
&gt; wants.  So if the newcomers come across this kinda CB players, it&#39;s wiser<br/>
&gt; to move on to another camp, coz it&#39;s only waste of time to stay there (u<br/>
&gt; are helpnig him to kill only).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Btw, even wiz can be quite guai lan at time, but IMHO the most seah-lan is<br/>
&gt; high lvl enchanter.  Not only they just hunt by charming mobs to kill<br/>
&gt; themselves (ie hunt without even using their hands, heh). Make them<br/>
&gt; frustrated they can train all the mobs on u, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FYI, if u hunt around NRo, there is a PvP dwarf name Broughm who like to<br/>
&gt; train SG to non-PvP players, I bet this is the only way he can kill those<br/>
&gt; non-PvP players.  Kinda sick minded - kill for the fun of killing.  He<br/>
&gt; train cutts to me twice, one time almost kill me and 2nd time killed<br/>
&gt; himself, heh.<br/>
