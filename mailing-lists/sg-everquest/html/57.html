<div id="ygrps-yiv-867205322">I see you are interested in joining the ranks of the Paladins<br/>
and I see you have a few questions regarding our combat techniques<br/>
<br/>
In order to understand our abilities.. you must understand all warrior<br/>
abilities<br/>
(i am not including Bards and Rogues)<br/>
<br/>
Weaponskills: all fighter-classes get high (5+5/level) skill in weapons<br/>
<br/>
KICK: does moderate damage (24th level ranger max skill does 12 damage!)<br/>
and is an extra attack, but is not magic unless you get magic boots<br/>
this is kind of frowned upon by Paladins as dishonorable<br/>
(Warrior and Ranger only)<br/>
<br/>
BASH: requires a shield and does less damage (21st level Paladin with 105<br/>
skill does 9 damage)<br/>
but STUNS also.... characters with magic shield do MAGIC damage!!!!<br/>
(Warrior,Paladin,Shadowknight)<br/>
<br/>
DOUBLE ATTACK: sometimes you swing twice with weapon or weapons!<br/>
it does not work every time... and secondary attacks seem to miss more......<br/>
those with dual-wield can get up to 4 attacks!! (five if you include kick)<br/>
(All fighter-type)<br/>
<br/>
DUAL WIELD: you can wield two weapons at same time<br/>
again you do not swing with both weapons all the time...<br/>
those with both dual wield and double-attack can attack up to 4 times<br/>
(5 if you include kick)<br/>
Paladins would rather concentrate upon hitting ones foe with the ONE weapon<br/>
you are holding instead of spreading out ones attention.<br/>
(only Warrior and Ranger)<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: combat abilities like KICK, BASH, and SLAM can only be used<br/>
ONE AT A TIME...<br/>
you cannot KICK then BASH, then SLAM... no I don&#39;t know why...<br/>
<br/>
for all warrior classes there are a few choices for optimal combat:<br/>
(for these purposes Rogues and Bards will not be compared)<br/>
<br/>
1)1H weapon and Shield<br/>
(Warrior, Paladin, ShadowKnight)<br/>
this includes the use of a 1-handed weapon, and a shield...  attacking once<br/>
or twice with weapon<br/>
and bashing with shield.. this combat techniques give the best Armor, but<br/>
least damage for all parties.<br/>
**please note Rangers CAN use shields.. but you will seldom find high-level<br/>
rangers<br/>
using shields as they cannot BASH they can however kick as can warriors... **<br/>
<br/>
2)Two 1H weapons<br/>
(Warrior, Ranger)<br/>
this tends to be the most optimal damage solution for warriors above level 15<br/>
and rangers above level 17 WITH NORMAL STORE_BOUGHT WEAPONS..... without<br/>
quest weapons, this is the best damage possibility and is argueably the most<br/>
consistant damage for any fighter-type<br/>
<br/>
3)One 2H weapon<br/>
(All warrior types)<br/>
this tends to do the most damage for each swing.. but to be more effective<br/>
than dual wield<br/>
requires quest items such as the Bone Bladed Claymore....<br/>
(my 21st level paladin has hit for up to 74 damage in a combat round with his<br/>
BBC!!)<br/>
<br/>
paladins get the skills for options 1 and 3.</div>
