Ah, then maybe it will be a good source of income right?  Any other skills<br/>
 to recommand for an adventuring enchanter? :)<br/>
&gt;&gt;I always do fishing even if I max fishing out already cos&#39; that is when I<br/>
get to talk and talk and talk! You should see man! Pier has 5 person. After<br/>
30 mins, all ciao liaw! See, I can get quite scary sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Yesterday I spoke to Leshrec but it seemed my /tell Leshrec wasn&#39;t working<br/>
well. Kept getting the WildServer.Player Not Found kinda message so I was<br/>
irritated.<br/>
<br/>
I met Yiyang last night and he given me some clothing, so touched, I&#39;ve<br/>
been searchinig/hunting few days and not yet find a decent piece of pant<br/>
(hard to buy the right stuffs coz most of them r for other race or too<br/>
 expensive for me).  Thx Yiyang ;)<br/>
&gt;&gt;Nice going, that will save me a plat. Hahaha! I recommend cloth for now. I<br/>
gave up on patchwork armours...too heavy.<br/>
