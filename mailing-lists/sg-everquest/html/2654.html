&gt; &gt; This is an easy quest that can get you a great ring for pure casters except<br/>
&gt; &gt; for Necromancers. First of all you must get your faction to amiable with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Temple of Life. I did this by giving Lashun Novashine 2 bone chips at a time<br/>
&gt; &gt; and paying him 2 gp for a cure disease.(Faction can be raised by killing<br/>
&gt; &gt; Putrid Skeletons in South Karana or by performing the blessed oil quest as<br/>
&gt; &gt; well as donating 2gp to Lashun) Once your faction is amiable you can do the<br/>
&gt; &gt; quest. Talk to Enic Rulkin by the Temple of Life Pool within Qeynos (he is<br/>
&gt; &gt; usually glitched and is swimming in the water by the Koalindl fish). He will<br/>
&gt; &gt; tell you of a problem that he has. It seems that Frostbite (McMannus&#39;s pet<br/>
&gt; &gt; dog in West Karanas) has eaten a Koalindl fish. Enic must get the corpse<br/>
&gt; &gt; back because even the fish&#39;s corpse is still considered to be holy. Here is<br/>
&gt; &gt; the trick... instead of killing Frostbite, which may be too high level to<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill and not always drop the fish corpse, simply create a level 1 character<br/>
&gt; &gt; with your friend doing the same (Shadow Knights are the best for this<br/>
&gt; &gt; because of Harm Touch) and go into the pool by the Temple of Life and kill a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Koalindl. The Koalindl will usually drop its scales. Now log out the level 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; character and loot the fish with your real character. I thought that this<br/>
&gt; &gt; would be the best way to do the quest, otherwise you would lose faction with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Temple of Life if you kill the Koalindl Fish with your true character.<br/>
&gt; &gt; (To be safe, gate out of the zone and come back in before you do the next<br/>
&gt; &gt; step. One has been killed for simply looting the corpse) Now simply give the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Koalindl Fish Scales to Enic Rulkin, and if he cons amiable, you may get the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Band of Rodcet Nife. The quest booby prize is Prayer Beads.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Band of Rodcet Nife stats: Lore Nodrop 3int 10mana<br/>
&gt; &gt; which means it is better than a platinum rose engagement ring 4int, unless<br/>
&gt; &gt; you are level 50 then they are equal.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Good luck,<br/>
