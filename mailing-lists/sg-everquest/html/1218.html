<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501576553">Sereph contribute his part in complain to Wylven.  Leshrec also contribute <br/>
his part by &#39;accidentally&#39; steal from Voy :)<br/>
<br/>
Since the anti-camp thingy, stealing is becoming a trend - and sad to say, <br/>
it&#39;s mostly the case of a caster stealing from melee.  As for high lvl win <br/>
the kill from low lvl, I have nothing to say.  Afterall it&#39;s a fair game <br/>
and the high lvl dun owe the low lvl anything tat they have to give up <br/>
their chance in getting special artifacts.  H/w, I&#39;m very against stealing <br/>
even thou&#39; I myself got capability to do so.<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve mentioned earlier, Wylven has stated his point in giving Voy a <br/>
chance to turn over, but Wylven himself is not clear as to what &#39;changes&#39; <br/>
he expected from Voy:<br/>
- No more stealing from guildmates but ok to steal from others, OR<br/>
- No stealing from anyone.<br/>
<br/>
My stand is very clear, if stealing from others is allowed in the guild, I <br/>
quit.  It doesn&#39;t matter if any guild member dun steal from other members, <br/>
the key factor here is stealing, regardless of stealing from who.  Even <br/>
thou I&#39;m always anon (easier for me to teach the cry babes and stealer a <br/>
lesson w/o giving any trouble to the guild), I&#39;ll feel shameful if I walk <br/>
pass and pple starting throwing comments like &quot;here come another stealers <br/>
from Qui Hoon Dai...&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As for cry babes like Amii, I raise both my hands and legs with Yiyang - to <br/>
train them, steal from them (since they accused us for stealing, so why not <br/>
satisfy her &#39;needs&#39;? hehe), and make their life like hell.    Btw I noticed <br/>
u DO can block pple when they trying to zone pass a narrow passage.  A week <br/>
ago there is this stealer name Senear at HH who keep stealing kill.  What <br/>
my group did is to block at the HH pass.  When there is a train after him, <br/>
he cant run to zone and was beaten till death, hahaha.  Then we start to <br/>
wipe all the mobs.  Later this Senear comes back, he looted his corpse and <br/>
went off, heh.  This way does not work 100% - depending on ya blocking <br/>
positions.  If someone try to block u, u can run pass them using the jump <br/>
features - but it&#39;ll still hinder ya running speed by a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve nothing against Qui Hoon Dai except this CB Voy.  So far I only hunt <br/>
with those pple I knew b4 they join the guild, like Ling, Megu, Sat, FF, DF <br/>
etc, and local kakis.  One exception is Demitry, which I only know him <br/>
after joining the guild.  Frankly speaking I found our kakis occupying the <br/>
medium and high lvls in the guild.  If Wylven remain silent on Voy&#39;s <br/>
behaviour I&#39;ll support a new local guild, and I contribute 1 pp more than <br/>
YY, ie 2pp,. heheh.<br/>
