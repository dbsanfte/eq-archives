<div id="ygrps-yiv-371620613">It would be sweet to meet each other but I think those in Qeynos or ard that area would have trouble coming to Freeport. Heard the journey is very dangerous and have to cross many zones. So unless yer level 8 or above, please don&#39;t try to make your way to Freeport from Qeynos yourself unless you have someone with you.<br/>
