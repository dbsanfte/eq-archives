<b>Subject:</b> Power-lvl for EQ wiz? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031203872">Anyone got good lobang to PL lvl 53 wiz other than quad-kite raptors? <br/>
 Raptors is too siong coz my scv connection will at least LD 1-2 times per <br/>
night, this excludes LDing when I zone (like 1 LD per 2-3 zoning, anyone <br/>
have any advice to solve this problem?)<br/>
<br/>
If LD when kiting, surely will kena killed and corpse sink into the deep <br/>
big sea.  This make CR very difficult unless can get necro to summon corpse <br/>
(which can be quite jiatlat to trouble others if happens often).<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can suggest what other place is fast and good xp for wiz, and when <br/>
killed at least easier to do resurrection? (best got place to do quad-kite <br/>
since it&#39;s best xp for mana).  Thx.<br/>
<br/>
ps: Spiroc xp very slow for my lvl liao ;(</div>
