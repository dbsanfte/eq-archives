&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have temporarily changed the rules on the test server in order to<br/>
&gt; test our new PvP - Teams code. This test will last approximately one<br/>
&gt; week. If you choose to play during this time, please understand that<br/>
&gt; it will be under PvP - Teams rules and that you are subject to being<br/>
&gt; player killed. If you are not confortable with this, we suggest<br/>
&gt; playing on our live servers until we return to the test server to<br/>
&gt; regular rules.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In addition to testing the PvP Teams code, we will also be testing the<br/>
&gt; balance of the initial teams, the allowable PK level spread, etc.<br/>
&gt; Please keep in mind that any or all of these rules are subject to<br/>
&gt; change at any time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The teams are as follows:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Team 1<br/>
&gt; High Elf<br/>
&gt; Wood Elf<br/>
&gt; Half-Elf<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Team 2<br/>
&gt; Dwarf<br/>
&gt; Gnome<br/>
&gt; Halfling<br/>
&gt; Team 3<br/>
&gt; Human<br/>
&gt; Barbarian<br/>
&gt; Erudite<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Team 4<br/>
&gt; Ogre<br/>
&gt; Troll<br/>
&gt; Dark Elf<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This means that any member of one team may be PK&#39;d by a member of any<br/>
&gt; of the other 3 teams, but not my a member of their own team.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have increased the level limits for PvP to +/-8 levels as opposed<br/>
&gt; to the +/-4 that exists in Rallos Zek (normal PvP server).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here is a short list of some other changes:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PvP Faction Hits have been removed until we can implement an aggressor<br/>
&gt; flag (IF we decide to).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If a character is killed by someone with his or her PK flag ON (+pvp),<br/>
&gt; they will return from death with Zero Mana. This is to address the<br/>
&gt; &#39;naked mage syndrome&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Warriors have been upgraded with more Hit Points, better innate<br/>
&gt; magical resistance, and a chance to critical hit above and beyond<br/>
&gt; normal critical hits in combat.<br/>
