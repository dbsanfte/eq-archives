I copied and pasted one of the posts by Maziron and sent it to GZ. I began the email with an intro explaining that I had copied it from a Mage board. <br/>
I think the post I copied was the one by the high level mage that says GZ hates Magicians. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here is his response. <br/>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
  As a young Arch-Mage I was traumatized by a rogue Air Elemental who for<br/>
  some reason sung &quot;I am Henry the 5th, I am&quot; for fourteen hours without stop.<br/>
  Because of this, I have hated Magicians for most of my career. <br/>
  Seriously though, the reason that we toned down the really high level<br/>
  pets is that they were doing excessive damage. As you can probably guess,<br/>
  we don&#39;t like to tone things down - we get a lot of bad press, and I get a<br/>
  ton of unhappy e-mail. I dislike both. Therefore, the only time we do nerf<br/>
  things is if we feel they are broken enough to warrent the change. This was<br/>
  something where we felt that we needed to make the change. <br/>
<br/>
  There are a few new things going in for Magicians this patch, and a few<br/>
  for the next patch. These are aimed both at making the Magicians more fun<br/>
  to play and helping them to find a place in a party. <br/>
<br/>
  Check the next few patches and see what you think. <br/>
