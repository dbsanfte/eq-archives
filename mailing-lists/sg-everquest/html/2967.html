&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just thought I&#39;d let everyone know that Ziltus has been happily married<br/>
&gt; today to a pretty lady he<br/>
&gt; now calls his wife! (officially at least)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It was a fun time for all of us who attended as we finally got to put<br/>
faces<br/>
&gt; to all the nicks we&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; calling each other by online. FYI...Galarion, Kellendil, Merns, Leshrec,<br/>
&gt; Bibi, Massiah and myself (Zanderion)<br/>
&gt; were there and in fact all of us except Bibi (who was busy with wife) went<br/>
&gt; for a drink at the nearby<br/>
&gt; Starbucks after the dinner.<br/>
&gt; Recalling the good old times and just chatting about gaming brought back<br/>
&gt; many good memories and funny<br/>
&gt; conversation. Pity Ziltus wasn&#39;t able to join us much but i&#39;m sure he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; happily busy right now kekekeke!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh and we missed you too Fesse! Were hoping we could see you and put a<br/>
face<br/>
&gt; to that sexy Dark Elf butt i&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been staring at soooo mucchhh!!!!! Oh well there&#39;s always a next time!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Finally, this is also a chance for those of you who weren&#39;t there to give<br/>
&gt; him your congrats! :)<br/>
&gt; Lets all wish him a great happy (productive!) future with his newly wedded<br/>
&gt; beautiful wife!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; C O N G R A T S!! Ziltus from all of us...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Was great fun and i hope to see all of you sometime again! Tata for now...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Signing off,<br/>
&gt; Yours truly - Zanderion (D2 username as well!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s. Got a barbarian Diablo2 action figure i bought for you with me, Kar<br/>
&gt; Wai! Collect it from me<br/>
&gt; sometime eh? Didn&#39;t want to embarass you by giving it to you in front of<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; many ppl lah hehe..<br/>
&gt; Then we all got excuse to go LAN gaming or something! hehehe<br/>
