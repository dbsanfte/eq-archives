I&#39;d be making a trip down once I hit the 11th Circle. I spoke to Trifrost as well. &lt;Barbarian Shaman&gt; Maybe he would make the trip down with me together with my Half-Elf friend. But that would be the first SAT in June.<br/>

  It would be sweet to meet each other but I think those in Qeynos or ard that area would have trouble coming to Freeport. Heard the journey is very dangerous and have to cross many zones. So unless yer level 8 or above, please don&#39;t try to make your way to Freeport from Qeynos yourself unless you have someone with you. </span></blockquote></div>
