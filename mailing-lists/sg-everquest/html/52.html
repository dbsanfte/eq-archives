Even though I got 3 over million worth of GPs in bank (coz<br/>
of house deeds), if I kena looted, also very sian to restart everything and<br/>
go around buying/making the stuffs again...<br/>
&gt;&gt; Hahaha! Me too!<br/>
<br/>
Ah, so no house to store stuffs.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Only guilds can have houses but even that, houses are so expensive, you<br/>
won&#39;t have money to buy things to store in it ;-) Also, UO houses beat EQ&#39;s<br/>
100-1.<br/>
<br/>
Can misc items (like potions) be stacked?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Yes, small ones and &quot;special&quot; ones.<br/>
<br/>
I presumed it will then required 1-2 mules to act like storage house? ;)<br/>
Or there are much lesser stuffs in EQ that i dun need much storage space?<br/>
&gt;&gt;For me, I have hardly any need for a bank ;-)<br/>
<br/>
 Anyway it&#39;s just a supplement to this mailing list, not a<br/>
replacement ;)<br/>
&gt;&gt;Darn, I love this phrase. Its going into my &quot;phrase&quot; storage bain.<br/>
