<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208554029">Yep, no more agnostic for necro. This is becoz too many pple wanna get the <br/>
goodies from TSK or Necro but yet wanna enjoy good faction after killing <br/>
hundreds of orcs by selecting agnostic (coz it help in improving ya <br/>
faction).  Afterall evil classes are made more powerful to compensate their <br/>
faction hit.<br/>
<br/>
Dark Elf alone shld be quite easy to improve faction - Kenven once did it <br/>
b4 as a DE warrior, by killing many orcs and he can enter Freeport at lvl 9 <br/>
I think (but some npc merchants at commonlands still refuse to do biz with <br/>
him).  But DEN is more evil, so u will need more time to gain good faction.<br/>
<br/>
Why not we create a Dark Elves/Trolls evil team, forget abt the good <br/>
faction thingy and bash the good races city, hehe.  I read some high lvl <br/>
dark elf wizards/shadow knights actually attack Freeport guards in other <br/>
servers (no need to find monsters to hunt, lol), sound kewl!<br/>
<br/>
Btw, Leshrec also got a DEN in Prexus server.<br/>

&gt;     hi all,<br/>
&gt;     it seems that quite abit had happened over the pass weekend when i <br/>
 </span></blockquote>wasnt around...  the party got formed... n stuff like that... n ive readup <br/>
abit on the few websites over the weekend... i think in general... the <br/>
necromancer has spells that spread over a pretty wide range... from <br/>
summoning... to direct damage... to healing... that no one spellcasting <br/>
class can provide... however this is with the drawback of faction.... so i <br/>
guess my first char in EQ will most likely be a Necromancer... but i havent <br/>
decide to make a Erudite or Dark Elf Necro ... most likely Dark Elf... but <br/>
i think i need to do more research on faction n stuff like that.... maybe <br/>
some of u guys can help me out here... esp Leshrec...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     1. is it that bad that a Dark Elf Necro is KOS in other towns/cities?<br/>
&gt;     2. how difficult is to be able to better the faction so that one can <br/>
 </span></blockquote>enter those cities without KOS? n how can u do it?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     3. what about Eruite Necro?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Pls advice :) although i havent got my EQ here yet... but i would <br/>
 </span></blockquote>like to be fully prepared fer it b4 it comes... :) hopefully within this <br/>
week... otherwise next... as i can only play during the weekend... BTW... <br/>
count me in... in ya guild.... i should be in the same server as u guys... <br/>
but i guess i will be progressing slowly... most likely i will be using <br/>
SilverHand. :)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;     Also, not sure about Trade Skills... anyone has any advice fer <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Necros? Also, u think it will be better to have 1 trade skills on a char <br/>
rather than 2? or does it matter? thats all i got fer now...<br/>
