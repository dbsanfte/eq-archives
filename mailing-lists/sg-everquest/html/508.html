<div id="ygrps-yiv-216842844">Well, all of you give very good points. However, they all contradict each<br/>
others&#39;. Like LKW and Sereph, both are solid facts but they &quot;kick&quot; each<br/>
other. In the end, its each to his own. Why can&#39;t we just play a game for<br/>
fun sake? But of course, who doesn&#39;t want to get all the goodies and hit<br/>
Level 50 &lt;smiles&gt;<br/>
<br/>
EG, Paldines was collecting dust because Gary found that Garren had better<br/>
strength to balance out his character in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I just answered my question. Now I know why I play only a Monk. Simple.<br/>
Kick and punch and trash the shit out of others. I heard Calofia &lt;40 Monk&gt;<br/>
was dishing out devastating damage. I wonder when its my turn....laterz.<br/>

&gt; There is no doubt a TSK can solo best in EQ.  They have the harm spells<br/>
&gt; which is as good as Paladin&#39;s healing ability (no saving throw or<br/>
failure),<br/>
&gt; yet they have the ability of regenerating HP ability.  I made a troll<br/>
&gt; shaman in Innoruuk for testing, at lvl 1 my first victim is a monster<br/>
which<br/>
&gt; is yellow to me.  And within the first 10 min I play, I gain a lvl.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Btw, all classes always complain that they are weaker than other classes,<br/>
&gt; seem to be a norm, hehe.  I even read from the net how a lvl 40+ warrior<br/>
&gt; complained abt his char as compare to a shadowknight who is few lvl below<br/>
&gt; him - coz in term of soloing, this warrior can&#39;t handle big monster like<br/>
&gt; that shadowknight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; EQSS also have an article abt soloing - and they rank troll anything as<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; easiest soloing char, esp TSK, followed by wiz, shaman, dwarf cleric and<br/>
&gt; monk.  One thing abt monk, at lvl 35+ they will jump to 2nd in the list,<br/>
ie<br/>
&gt; the next best soloing class after Troll something, due to the new kick ass<br/>
&gt; skills they achieve at higher level. </span></blockquote></div>
