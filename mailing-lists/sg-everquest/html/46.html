<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231957212">This is actaully what I see...<br/>
<br/>
1)People walking/fighting around and only people fighting/walking around..&lt;Everyone is using /tell /group messaging&gt;<br/>
<br/>
2)Guage says out of character &lt;/ooc, something like broadcasting so everyone can &quot;hear&quot;&gt; &quot;Am I able to start a whorehouse?&quot; BlahBlahBlah says out of character &quot;Oh shutup before I call a GM&quot; And on and on, people are /ooc their opinions and you get flooded &lt;grins&gt;<br/>
<br/>
3)Doh! Dwarf has Handphone? Issit the lastest CDMA version? &lt;Grins&gt;<br/>
<br/>
4)MrBarbarian ruffles MrDwarf&#39;s hair. This is a fact but the Dwarf took it in his stride. He was really comical actaully. Running around a bunch of Barbarians dodging past them. He was good fun to his hunting party. <br/>

  Not at all,hehe..I rather like all the information thats been pumping up for the past few days :) Though I would like to know if there are players here that actually ROLE-PLAY their characters meaning<br/>
   <br/>
  1.I would never see a DarkElf cleric curing an elf :)<br/>
  2.An orge getting killed for a damsel in distress<br/>
  3.Some dwarf that said someone called him on his mobile phone<br/>
