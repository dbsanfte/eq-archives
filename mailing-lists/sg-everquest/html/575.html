<br/>
1.HighLv Group:Leshrec,Trifrost,Garren,Yutaka,Yiyang<br/>

    Going back again? <br/>
    *bang head against the wall* <br/>
<br/>
    We are sure a bunch of unorganise goondus....... <br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;m going back to Cazic Thule until we can work this out. See whether I can hit level 50 by the end of the month. <br/>
<br/>
    Game gets very boring at high levels, without friends to be with....... <br/>
