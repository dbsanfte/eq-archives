<div id="ygrps-yiv-23382031">I bought the game and don&#39;t know where to start so I just randomly choose a<br/>
server. It just happen to be EM. I will check out Innoruuk server one of<br/>
these days and when I do so, I will look for u guys. Don&#39;t have much time to<br/>
start another character nowadays. Got to work, take care of my girlfriend<br/>
and my family. Wish I could be like your Enchanter friend.<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, I will try to frequent this mailing list.<br/>

&gt; 95% of us play in Innoruuk server.  One chao-ah-aqua got a lvl 49<br/>
enchanter<br/>
&gt; in CT server but he still managed to train a lvl 20 plus cleric & a lvl 20<br/>
&gt; plus bard in Innoruuk in a short time. Why?  Becoz all kakis very close<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; helpful.  We even intend to start a SG guild and accept mainly local kakis<br/>
&gt; and those trust-worthy friends from other nations.  We also got a big rich<br/>
&gt; guy in Innoruuk who can extend any financial loan service to you.  ;-P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How come u are still in EM server???<br/>
