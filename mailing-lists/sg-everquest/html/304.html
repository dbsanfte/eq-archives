<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796280410">I agree, no matter what name u guys select, I will still join and support <br/>
the guild ;)  Just thinking of attracting more S&#39;pore players by making the <br/>
name related to us.  There are many other names other than what we have <br/>
mentioned which are also related to S&#39;pore I think.  Let start cracking our <br/>

singapore guild and i think everyone would still support it wholeheartedly <br/>
