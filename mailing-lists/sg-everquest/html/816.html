<b>Subject:</b> A very sad story (and one that made me very pissed off) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782440169">2 days ago, I was at Befallen hunting for a BBC (which I don&#39;t need,<br/>
just wanna get one to sell of cash, I&#39;m broke. Trust me, even when u<br/>
reach my lvl, u will still be struggling for $$$). The party consist of<br/>
Garren (ie me), Ironbuket, Iyenya, Senorn and Phenix. We were lucky that<br/>
the first Troll SK we killed had the BBC. That was the end of the good<br/>
part. Phenix then immediately stole the BBC and refuses to pass over the<br/>
BBC to me (funny thing was that they agreed to do alpha loot and my name<br/>
ended up as first. But I did said that the group can buy the BBC and<br/>
I&#39;ll spilt the cash with the group). And when he (ie Phenix) tried to<br/>
run out of Befallen, he died. Okie, that would have been end of story.<br/>
Guy looted group BBC and died on his way out, and loses his stuff. But,<br/>
we&#39;re kind hearted enough to help him to get his stuff back. Then his<br/>
friend Senorn was given permission to loot his corpse. Okie, letting his<br/>
friend Senorn loot the Phenix is almost as good as losing the BBC. They<br/>
are friends. But, dued to some lag and wierd shit, Senorn dropped his<br/>
SBH, and lost the BBC too. Now, Iyenya picked up the SBH. Okie, so we<br/>
gotten the SBH instead of the BBC, well it&#39;s better than nothing. But,<br/>
we didn&#39;t sell it. We held on to it and see who claim to lose his SBH.<br/>
Both Phenix and Senorn claimed to have dropped the SBH and both claimed<br/>
that each other had the BBC. But, why did I choose to believe that<br/>
Phenix had stolen the BBC (the 2nd time and also con the SBH off Iyenya,<br/>
which is likely to belong to Senorn)? B&#39;cos when I went down to Oasis<br/>
and asked 1 day later, ppl beside him said that he&#39;s holding a BBC. I<br/>
started to taunt him (PRICK was about the kindest thing I said about<br/>
him) and challenged him to a duel which Phenix refused. One thing I&#39;m<br/>
saying is that I&#39;ll never ever want to be in a group with Phenix (who<br/>
stole the group BBC and stole/sold his friend Senorn SBH, which Senorn<br/>
(a warrior) had to sell off his armor to get another SBH). So if you<br/>
ever have to band with Phenix, think again.<br/>
