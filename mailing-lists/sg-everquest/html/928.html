<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411131724">Most low lvl mobs can&#39;t see invisibility, so it&#39;s safe most of the time <br/>
travelling with it on.  Since I haven&#39;t reach lvl 20, I can&#39;t comments on <br/>
monsters higher than that.  So far I haven&#39;t meet any mobs that can see me <br/>
with invis.<br/>
<br/>
Normally talking, ooc, etc wont reveal yaself.  But if u try to loot, <br/>
inspect others, cast spells or attack, you will reveal yaself.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
give any AC bonus, only give u the ability to remain invisible to others.<br/>
<br/>
As for CB, I mean soloing.  If u can find a full group with tanks and <br/>
healers, u shld be able to survive quite well in the CB camp, but not in <br/>
the CB dungeon, due to the higher lvl mobs like dvinn, emperor etc.  I ever <br/>
group with a team of 1 warrior, 1 ranger, 1 cleric, 1 wiz, 1 magi when I&#39;m <br/>
lvl 5 and 6, we did quite well in CB camp.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, maybe u wanna consider coming to FP when u reach lvl 8 and buy the new <br/>
scrolls, coz most of the kakis r in FP and we can help one another better. <br/>
 I just met a high elf friend last night, who is 2 lvl above me when I <br/>
leave for FP, now she is 4 lvl below me.  FP basically got more monsters to <br/>
hunt, better xp and loot too.  Most imptly all our kakis are there, dun <br/>
have to worry abt been bullied, hehehe.<br/>

&gt; Hi LKW aka Ziltus!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One question i really want answered: Does invisiblity really keep you <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to monsters?<br/>
&gt; Like if i don&#39;t attack them..they won&#39;t see me? And if i do attack while<br/>
&gt; invis..does it<br/>
&gt; give any bonus of any kind eg. AC ??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the tips!! I can&#39;t cope with trains of 3 centurions now...so <br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Personally I dun advised any caster below lvl 10 to go CB, coz the loot<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesnt justify the trains.  I myself start to go there since lvl 5, and<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; 5 plats at lvl 7...this is pathetic right?? Have yet to even buy<br/>
