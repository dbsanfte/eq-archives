<div id="ygrps-yiv-94875859">Attached is a pretty useful article for grouping. I got it from UOSS, <br/>
re-formatted it into MS word for you guys to print out for reading and <br/>
reference.<br/>
<br/>
The main points are:<br/>
- Form an XP efficient group (dun get a full house hunting 1 single blue <br/>
mob)<br/>
- Move as a group, dun leave the slow ones behind (Bard pls take note of <br/>
this point, dun leave those with slow system and run by yaself, hehe.  In <br/>
the end all get killed or lost all over the place).<br/>
- Get prepared and rdy for the hunt (For God sake dun come to hunt and <br/>
start begging for foods/drinks, there are many npc merchants that sell this <br/>
at 1 sp plus.  I get at least 40 of each when time I buy my supplies.  FYI <br/>
when teaming with FF so far, I never ask a single food and drink from him, <br/>
thou he can summon alot.  Those players who have the habit of begging <br/>
food/drink every where they go, I will ask them to fly kite, hehe).<br/>
- PLAN, most impt, PLAN.  Tanks dun act cowboy and charge b4 casters are <br/>
rdy.  Magi keep ya pet at ya side or dismiss it when hunt at heavily <br/>
trained places.  Casters dun scare of OOM and use ya mana at the right <br/>
time.  Make up an escape plan b4 hunting.  Set a sentry when casters <br/>
mediating.  Stated a clear looting order b4 members start to fight for <br/>
loot. Etc etc.<br/>
- Always compromise and be patient.<br/>
<br/>
Take a good look inside.<br/>
