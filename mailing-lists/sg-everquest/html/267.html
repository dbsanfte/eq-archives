<b>Subject:</b> Troll SIMI - Solo info <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-465669735">Yesterday I create a troll shaman and the damn troll really rock!  My firs <br/>
prey is a giant rat which is yellow to me (kill it like bu la-sa), and in <br/>
the 1st 10 min I play, I gain a lvl!  Now the other BIG problem with troll <br/>
is its evil faction.  The regenerating ability simply rocks.  If anyone <br/>
wish to start a solo char and u dun hack care abt faction (ie u dun EVEN <br/>
intend to enter other races&#39; cities), troll is definitely a good choice.  I <br/>
read that troll can STILL enter other races&#39; cities, provided you kill A <br/>
LOT of evil creature to improve ya faction - and this can take u LONG LONG <br/>
time.  I play with a gnome necromancer (lvl 10), a wiz (lvl 11) and a bard <br/>
(lvl 10) last night hunting undead spawn, the necro can solo take one spawn <br/>
while the 3 of us take another.  This show how powerful class like necro <br/>
is.  On the other hand, at lvl 10 that gnome neco is still KOS by npc <br/>
guards, he need to walk very carefully in case any guard show up and he got <br/>
to make a big detour to passby some npc huts to prevent KOS.  Imagine a <br/>
dark elf has much worse faction than a gnome necro and a troll is an even <br/>
worse faction than dark elf ;(  So u gotta slowly wait b4 u can get other <br/>
races NOT to KOS u, not to mentioned how long more the npc is willing to <br/>
trade with u.  And even if they do, never expect the &#39;similar&#39; price other <br/>
races r getting, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, the first lvl 50 char ever in EQ (during beta time) is a dark elf <br/>
wizard, and he reach lvl 46 b4 the lvl 29 spells are even out, other wise <br/>
he will attain lvl 50 much faster!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found a plain land near Butcherblock entrance which spawn lvl 8-10 <br/>
creatures/animals.  One of my favorite is lowland bersilik, which give a <br/>
loot of its tongue that u can sell for 1g2s.  Problem with this animal is <br/>
tat it will stone u for few moment.  If got a tank out there who is lvl <br/>
8-10 in Faydark, I would like to team with u to kill them.  Last night I <br/>
team with a lvl 10 bard, he tank while I blast.  Thou&#39; he also get stoned <br/>
by becoz of his melee skill, he dun get much dam.  The bersilik is actually <br/>
quite weak other than its stoning ability.  I just need to blast from the <br/>
side and can kill it pretty fast.  It&#39;s quite a nice place for lvl 9~11 I <br/>
guess.  Any taker? ;)<br/>
