<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539589547">As you all know by now, alot of quest artifacts are now NODROP, <br/>
and that includes the Koalindl Fish Corpse that is so crucial to the <br/>
Glowing Stein quest.<br/>
<br/>
So the sequence goes like this:<br/>
<br/>
Fish corpse NODROP (plus some other items) -----&gt; Bartender&#39;s <br/>
Compendium NODROP in Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Bartender&#39;s Compendium NODROP ------&gt; Glowing Stein in Oggok<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, the chain of items is NODROP all the way. This <br/>
makes it alot trickier, since the person who eventually goes to <br/>
Oggok (most likely an enchanter or someone with good faction with <br/>
ogres) MUST be the one to loot the fish for it&#39;s corpse.<br/>
<br/>
The only safe way around this is to again use the mule character <br/>
tactic, but this time, the person actually doing the quest must be <br/>
there, ready to pounce and loot the fish corpse. The corpse will be <br/>
lootable solely by the person who gets the kill/xp, for the first 2 <br/>
minutes, after which it becomes free-looting. So all you have to do <br/>
is wait for 2 minutes... This method has been confirmed through <br/>
testing by me, Sereph and Trifrost. Just watch out for other players <br/>
waiting for such an oppurtunity as well.<br/>
<br/>
An alternative method, which has not been tested, and could have <br/>
more potential risk, is to group with the mule character who kills <br/>
the fish, but stay far far away.<br/>
<br/>
Theoretically, because you do not personally initiate combat with <br/>
the fish, the guards/clerics/paladins should not KOS you, and you <br/>
should not get faction hits. But you should still be able to loot the <br/>
corpse since you are in the same group as the killer, so no need to <br/>
wait for 2 minutes. This method not tested yet...<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all for now I guess...<br/>
