&gt; Since D2 use acct name (instead of char name) to send tell, maybe we can<br/>
&gt; maintain a list here:<br/>

&gt; Btw, we play in Asia server, channel &quot;Singapore&quot; (this channel is on most<br/>
&gt; of the time, many local players).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve tested both USeast and USwest server, seem like it&#39;s not much better<br/>
&gt; than Asia.  Probably becoz there are many more players now than stress<br/>
test<br/>
&gt; (but still have to blame that Korean server, down more than 1/2 of the<br/>
&gt; time).  Seem like the &#39;server down&#39; is becoz of our connection and not the<br/>
&gt; real server down.  Someone say if u cannot open a game, try to join a<br/>
&gt; Korean game then quit and create your own one will help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Btw Les and I in act 3 liao.  As I didn&#39;t find much goodies, I spend most<br/>
&gt; of my money buying swords and test out their dam.  My last buy is a great<br/>
&gt; helm, 22k which drain me dry up totally.  Btw, all my resis is zero, my<br/>
&gt; gears are mainly with fastest run/walk, fastest hit recovery, increase<br/>
&gt; chances getting magical items, life regeneration and attacker kena hit by<br/>
&gt; spikes kind, no resis type.  Maybe becoz of that I use TONS of potions,<br/>
esp<br/>
&gt; healing potions.  For every big fights (I use ard 10 healing potions).<br/>
&gt;  Does resis really help?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh yes, seem like it&#39;s more powerful using 1 fast/heavy dam weap than 2<br/>
&gt; very fast/medium dam weap?  Also swords got more varity right?  My barb<br/>
&gt; only train in sword mastery...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ziltus<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p/s: Les, I just noticed the crystal sword only has 10 druability, no<br/>
&gt; wonder it breaks down so often.  But its dam is the highest I got so far.<br/>
