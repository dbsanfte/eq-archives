<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899191153">I disagree Magi is lousy, and also disagreed tat magi w/o pet is 1/2 wiz <br/>
w/o rooting.  In fact, in most places other than dungeon, I mean after lvl <br/>
30, magi can solo better than wiz (remember u can solo in HH at lvl 30 but <br/>
I cant?).<br/>
<br/>
At high lvl, ya lava spell (900dd) can be purchased easily while we have to <br/>
quest or research for our ice comet (1200dd).  Ya casting time is also much <br/>
shorter I believe (bolt spell casting time is shorter than shocl spells). <br/>
 Most of magi buff are &#39;stored buff&#39;, where u can summon till u log.  I <br/>
basically think magi is pretty cool.  H/w, above lvl 34, we really need to <br/>
find good team and right place to adventure (same for other classes).<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I dun think u need root spell coz ya EE can root for u.  Ever notice <br/>
how the mob get &#39;rooted&#39; by ya pet when u send pet in and nuke?  When I <br/>
team with u, I always wonder why is it so, esp when ya dd is now higher <br/>
than mine.  I think this is how Verant compensate magi for &#39;rooting&#39;. <br/>
 Unlike u, when we team, u send in pet and nuke, mob wont come to u, but it <br/>
come to me the moment I nuke.  I think Verant make it such tat mob will <br/>
treat ya pet as part of u.  So when u nuke harder, ya pet can still take <br/>
the punishment from u.  Most impt of all, when wiz oom, we are dead meat <br/>
99% of the time unless we are just next to zone.   Magi, on the other hand, <br/>
can make use of pet to die for u while u flee to zone.  Of coz once ya pet <br/>
died, mob will still out run u, but at least u got longer fleeing time than <br/>
wiz.<br/>
<br/>
Necro pet is also cool, but their spells are mainly dot.  There is no tank <br/>
(nuking) mage in EQ, but I believe magi is the only tank AND mage.<br/>
<br/>
I can still solo a bit coz of jboot.  U shld know I&#39;m also bad luck like <br/>
u..but I guess we just have to keep trying. ;)<br/>
