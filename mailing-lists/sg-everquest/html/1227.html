<b>Subject:</b> Rare Spawn for lower levelers! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325802144">Greetings Guys!<br/>
<br/>
Found a rare spawn in East Karanas near the ramp. That named mob, I think his name is Yutaka. Its a Human Monk. Judging from me point of view, he is only around Level 13. He should be quite good for exp I guess. I believe he&#39;d spawn there on Friday near 9pm Singapore time.<br/>
<br/>
So you lower level guys wanna &quot;camp&quot; there? &lt;grins&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll need the protection from all those dark stalkers that pop out from no where...<br/>
<br/>
Safe Travels,<br/>
