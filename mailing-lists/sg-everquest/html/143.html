I think we have this huge communication problem. &lt;grins widely&gt; This the second time liaw. Hahaha! I am at the Karanas still....I dare not take on HighHold Pass alone. A LvL16 Cleric ask me to stay away until at least LvL15. However, I&#39;d be taking the risk on Sat and try to go there with my best friend.<br/>
<br/>
He managed to kill a LvL20+ Skele that conned red to him with a help of a cleric. He gained HALF a Tube/Bubble. Shoik man! Too bad I went to sleep liaw....was like 6am &lt;grins&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Take care!<br/>
