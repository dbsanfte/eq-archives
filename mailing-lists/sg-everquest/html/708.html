<div id="ygrps-yiv-759775162">Actually EQ hunting is kinda different from UO.  UO really need battle <br/>
tactics, esp during PvP.  UO battles also have more tactics, strategies <br/>
than EQ since it may involved a big fight of more than 20 players or so (ah <br/>
remind me of our big crash with MacRonald and his PK gang in Hythloth, <br/>
almost 20 of us fighting in the orcish room).<br/>
<br/>
In EQ, u r fighting more often as a 2-6 players team.  The strategy is more <br/>
straight forward.  Mainly - tank, buff & support.  Lvl matters ALOT in EQ. <br/>
 Even for the best PvP, most experienced player - ya chances is VERY SLIM <br/>
vs monsters which is 2 lvl above u ;)<br/>
<br/>
Since the fighting tactics is pretty straight forward, it&#39;s really very <br/>
impt, IMHO, to get xp first.  That&#39;s why I go for XP more than loot.  With <br/>
more xp and higher lvl - I have no worry in getting better loot in future <br/>
;)<br/>
<br/>
Of coz, helping them with items & $$ is also a good way.<br/>
<br/>
Aiya, dun bother so much lah, make a cleric and all on the list will be <br/>
very happy, hehee.<br/>

just my point of view and i aint in the game yet.... oh well.... comments r <br/>
welcome... these r just what i thought from all those reading... n also... <br/>
im kinda flickle minded about a Necromancer or a Mage... since theres no <br/>
clear cut bout em... but i think the mage has too many pets... n they aint <br/>
they great as compared to the Dark Elf Necromancer... well... see how <br/>
lah... when the time comes... ill decide... or maybe ill try playing <br/>
both... and will decide at some stage...<br/>
