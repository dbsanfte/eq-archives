&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Guk hunt on last Fri night is not very sucessful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Initially we plan to get some FBRs but many of us died when travelling in<br/>
&gt; Nek.  In the end it became a corpse retrieving session, some of us even<br/>
&gt; died few times, ouch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After everypne get their corpses, we proceed to upper guk.  Loot is quite<br/>
&gt; ok, everyone get something I guess, mainly mesh (mostly given to YY, see he<br/>
&gt; laughting at the corner? hehe), woven & netted stuffs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, come to the later part, we started to trigger trains, and pple<br/>
&gt; starts to die again.  Worst is Deadflower, who is binded in FP and died FEW<br/>
&gt; times in a row, running from FP to Guk.  He is the most unlucky person for<br/>
&gt; that night, coz he died so many times tat he dropped lvl, PLUS his SBS is<br/>
&gt; deleted coz when we loot his and AA&#39;s corpse, both got SBS (lore item).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Due to the high number of casulties in Guk, we decided to go elsewhere for<br/>
&gt; hunting on Sat.  H/w, I&#39;m unable to join becoz I was busy helping<br/>
&gt; Deadflower to get back his lvl in Lake Rathetear and also camp for his SBS<br/>
&gt; (YES, got it after the 21th trainer I killed, better than last time, where<br/>
&gt; I need to kill 24 for AA&#39;s SBS).  Boy that will be the last time I camp for<br/>
&gt; dirk or SBS man, next time I gonna gate u guys to camp yaself liao. I feel<br/>
&gt; so pai seh when everybody leave the hill when I camp there (one nuke<br/>
&gt; already hurt trainer more than 50%, no horse run, hehe).  Some even renamed<br/>
&gt; the trainer hill after my name for that few hours - Ziltus Hill, LOL.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As a last note, I think it&#39;s best to have at least lvl 20 (I mean everybody<br/>
&gt; in the group) b4 u start to chong Guk.<br/>
