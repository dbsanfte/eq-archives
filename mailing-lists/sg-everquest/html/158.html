Last night I didnt advance much, dun see u guys online.  I team with a lvl <br/>
6 dward cleric who is blur sotong, hunting orc.  He keep healing only <br/>
himself and let me die.  Die 4 times on a straight row and lost a bar of <br/>
XP.  I disband and hunt solo.  After play for an hr or so just to recover <br/>
what I lost.  ;(<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can help me getting a great staff (not worn)? ;)<br/>
I&#39;m now trying to gather money by hunting small animals/monsters outside <br/>
Felwithe, quite time consuming, worse is no XP gain, hunt for the sake of <br/>
loot only and sell.  Earn 4pp so far but spend all on getting a senior <br/>
apprentice robe for mage.  On the other hand, no kakis to team up hunting <br/>
for bigger monsters.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe gotta start training a cleric to hunt for money/xp, at least cleric <br/>
got melee skill and can stand as a semi-tank, yet can cast some spells ;)<br/>
