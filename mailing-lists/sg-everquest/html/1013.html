<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-226115313">According to EQ-lizer, Fiery Avanger is a 1H at beta, so they put it under <br/>
the 1H category.  In AD&D, it&#39;s a paladin ONLY weap and according to EQ, <br/>
it&#39;s the most powerful weap in the game.   During beta, it&#39;s a weap for all <br/>
melee classes, maybe EQ wanna advertised it, but I believe now it shld be a <br/>
paladin ONLY weap.  Garren must be laughing at the corner now, heheh.<br/>
<br/>
As for using brewing to sponsor smithing, I&#39;m thinking abt it too but dunno <br/>
how to go abt doing it, anyone can teach me?  My guildmaster can only teach <br/>
me up to 20 or 21 skills, and from there onward I need to find rusty weap <br/>
which can be sold to npc above 1gp to rise my skill further.  Unlike <br/>
brewing it took much longer time.  If u guys got any lobang to rise it <br/>
fast, even if it mean throwing 200pp into it, even if it mean I need to <br/>
brew whole damn week, I die die will also do it, hehe.<br/>
