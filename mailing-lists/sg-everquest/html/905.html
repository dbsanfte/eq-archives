Since you&#39;re an S&#39;porean, you have already clear part 1 of our joining<br/>
ritual. You must now make your way over to Freeport for your &quot;parang<br/>
ceremony&quot; held by me then the trial period where we monitor you. Then<br/>
we&#39;ll officially accept you as one of us.<br/>
<br/>
Only when you travel to FP can we aid you and besides, everyone is<br/>
around FP<br/>
