That&#39;s a long way off for me now! Heck, I just reached level 6...think i&#39;ll die b4 i can even step on the boat...come to think of it,.,,<br/>
i might never see the boat hehe<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll probably try and come over later...like when i reach at least level 8-10?<br/>
Hmm.....<br/>
<br/>
Can i get monetary support if i&#39;m one of you? (typical sg mentality hehe)<br/>

  When the fish did we have rice cookers??? <br/>
  Since you&#39;re an S&#39;porean, you have already clear part 1 of our joining ritual. You must now make your way over to Freeport for your &quot;parang ceremony&quot; held by me then the trial period where we monitor you. Then we&#39;ll officially accept you as one of us. <br/>
<br/>
  Only when you travel to FP can we aid you and besides, everyone is around FP <br/>

  Sereph, your expert in parangs and fast castrations. <br/>
