Enchanter&#39;s &quot;stuff&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
For your case since you are new, get cloth armour or woven. Woven being the better though more costly. A full suit of woven compared to a full suit of cloth will be slightly lightly, thus reduces less STAMINA.<br/>
<br/>
Enchanters ain&#39;t normally the fighters, they stand back and watch and control the fight/show. At later stages, you are open to a variety of &quot;transforming&quot;. You can morph into monsters as well as animals. Whichever creature you morph into, you have its powers. Like you morph into wolf, you run faster and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Do not take up Jewel Craft cos&#39; its useless and cost too much to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Keep to eating muffins and milk/water. If I am right, you can get them in The Office whatever in Freeport since you are based there. Ask Yiyang aka Alex for help as well as Gary ;-)<br/>
