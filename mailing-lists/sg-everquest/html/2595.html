<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836423387">Hello guys... can someone help me out with my Singtel Magix <br/>
problems? I just got it, and I can&#39;t seem to get into the EQ login <br/>
server. I always get stuck after entering my password, as if the <br/>
server was down.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the patch server update screen (during EQ startup) <br/>
doesn&#39;t work always work the first time... I will get an error the first <br/>
time, and only on the 2nd try will I get in. The optional update patch <br/>
never works, though. I will always get the standard error message.<br/>
<br/>
Seems like a problem with my network configs, but I&#39;ve played <br/>
around with it, disabling everything except TCP/IP drivers, etc, but <br/>
no luck.<br/>
<br/>
I need some help. Everything else works fine, mailing, browsing, <br/>
ICQ... all ok. Only EQ... Aaarrgggghhh!<br/>
<br/>
