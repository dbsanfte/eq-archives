Is it possible to switch weapons instantly w/o going into inventory?As I am a bard,I need to switch from a weapon to a musical weapon or vice versa instantly.For example,this group of orcs might be hard to kill then I join the party to attack orc but the whole team seems to be losing so I need to switch to a drum and use speed song to get through but time is precious is this typa situation so any ideas to recommend if its not possible to switch weapon immediately?<br/>
