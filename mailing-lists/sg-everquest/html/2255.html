<b>Subject:</b> Black Glove & Boot Quest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047992509">Stat of glove is dunno ac 3 or 5, 5.5wt, heavy but give a black glove look <br/>
when u wear it.   Here&#39;s the quest:<br/>
<br/>
This item is obtainable by completing a quest in the Erudian Mage Guild <br/>
House. What you do is hail Vasile Jahnir and Say &quot;The power of the <br/>
gatecallers is Summoning&quot;. If you have good faction with the Gatecallers he <br/>
will tell you to bring him 2 summoned food and 2 summoned Daggers. Give <br/>
these items to him making sure the food is not stacked when you give it to <br/>
him. Once you do this, you will receive the gloves. If your faction is not <br/>
up to par, kill Eliah Brooks (a Necromancer near the docks in Tox Forest, <br/>
loc +140, +1200).<br/>
<br/>
I killed tat necro only 7-8 times b4 I got enudd faction to do the quest.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, after u get the glove, there is a 2nd quest from the same npc - to <br/>
kill a lvl 4 or 5 troll at the bridge.  That troll con green to me and will <br/>
cast blindness (which is useless to us). U will get its head (no drop, no <br/>
stats) and pass to the npc, u will get a low lvl magi spell.<br/>
<br/>
With 75 str, I now need the black boot do complete my &quot;Dark Flame&quot; style of <br/>
black outfit, hehe.</div>
