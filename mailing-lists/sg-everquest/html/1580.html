<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-433024885">Just made Ziltus a master wound binder last night at skill 100.  Every <br/>
bandaging will now heal around 50HP till the target is 50% HP.  FYI <br/>
bandaging only work when ya health is below 50% (otherwise cleric will be <br/>
out of job).  Nevertheless it still great in reducing risk and downtime for <br/>
all classes.<br/>
<br/>
This skill is especially useful if u are a soloing non-healers, and it&#39;s my <br/>
only source of healing when I soloing.  From skill 0 to 100, I have used up <br/>
less than 3 full bags of bandages (u may use up more due to ya INT).  1 <br/>
bandage is 5sp plus, a roll of 20 is 1pp, 3 full bags is 24 rolls of 24pp <br/>
only.  All u need is to spend 1 night, nuke yaself to below 50% and use the <br/>
skill on yaself.  For those who cannot nuke, u can try jumping off from <br/>
height and get yaself hurted  (try wood elf city?).<br/>
<br/>
For me, I nuke myself in Felwithe (please do it in a quiet corner, or pple <br/>
start pointing u as a SM manic) and use the skill on myself.  I do it for 1 <br/>
night, ard 2-3 hrs I think, and max it out to skill 100.  Once I reach 100, <br/>
I try to use another 2 rolls of bandage but it dun seem to rise anymore. <br/>
 Anyone can enlighten me as to whether this skill use lvl ceiling or strict <br/>
100 cap?  Thx.<br/>

P/s: For all the magi out there, there is NO reason for not maxing this <br/>
skills with ya summon bandages spell.  For all others, be nice to magi, u <br/>
can max out this skill FOC or at a much lower cost if u have a magi to help <br/>
u out. ;)<br/>
<br/>
P/s: YY the SM manic can train this skill anywhere he want, since he is a <br/>
well-known SM King liao.  Probably he dun need since the bald heads got <br/>
their own self-healing skill at certain lvl.  Bards also dun need since <br/>
they got healing song.  But if u got extra 24pp to spend, no harm maxing <br/>
this skill (u can sing mana song and heal at same time, or sing and bind <br/>
wound to speed up the healing process).  When training others w/o grouping, <br/>
at least u can use this skill to heal ya trainee and reduce his downtime. <br/>
 Btw, rumor say if u group for healing and disband, u will still get the <br/>
group xp instead of solo xp, not sure if it&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
P/s: I wonder if a bald head wanna train this skill, yet he cant nuke <br/>
himself and wont get hurted when he jump from height (safe fall skill), how <br/>
can he power train this skill?  EQ shld allow players to crash their balls <br/>
so tat the bald head, if need to play SM, can hurt themselves by squeezing <br/>
their own balls, hahahahaha ;P</div>
