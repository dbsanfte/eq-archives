<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056227672">Open to	: Lvl 30 and above.<br/>
Venue	: Rivervale Bank<br/>
Date 	: 21/8/99 (Sat)<br/>
Time	: 11.00PM - 2.00AM<br/>
VIP	: Garren the BIG tank<br/>
<br/>
OK, I hope this time will work (ie no more corpse looting, hehe).<br/>
<br/>
This trip required a tank, which I would like to invite Garren to offer his <br/>
service (not for free la).  As you guys know, SOO cost at least 400-600pp <br/>
in the realm.  Thus I think it&#39;s only fair that all who need the staff AND <br/>
physically participate in the hunt pay at least 50pp to Garren for his 3 <br/>
hrs service, so that he get at least 200pp for the assistance (ie if 2 <br/>
person coming, each pay him 100pp, if 4 person coming, pay him 50pp each). <br/>
 Of coz it&#39;s up to dearest Garren if he choose not to charge us any fee for <br/>
the service, hehehe.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, make it a short and sweet hunt.  We will camp for Borxx the CB EYE. <br/>
 Every one (including Garren himself, which mean u guys who cant make it <br/>
for the trip can pay him 500pp for ths staff, hehe) get a lens and I will <br/>
gate all back to GF (ok I offer this service FOC, thou&#39; I got 50pp last <br/>
night gating a party of 5 from GF to WC last night, hehe).  Once in GF, we <br/>
will &#39;chong&#39; to the the Gnome observer. Someone will create an enchanter <br/>
gnome with MAX CHA, then we pass lens one by one to him and he get the SOO <br/>
one by one for us.  Once done, I will gate all to WC, for free again! ;)<br/>
<br/>
Now we just need Garren to nod his head ;)<br/>
<br/>
Oh last note.  Borxx can charm.  So participants pls get ya CANCEL MAGIC <br/>
spell rdy.  If u haven&#39;t got it, u can buy it from Felwithe.  It&#39;s a very <br/>
useful spell against those debuff spells.<br/>
