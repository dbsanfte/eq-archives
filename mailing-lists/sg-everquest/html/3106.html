TAMPA -- As his 9-month-old son cried last July, Tony Lamont Bragg Sr.&#39;s
mind was on something else: a computer game called Everquest. <br>
<br>
Authorities believe Bragg squeezed Tony Jr. to keep him quiet, then left
him unattended in a utility closet in their Temple Terrace apartment for
more than 24 hours. The boy died. <br>
<br>
On Tuesday, Bragg, 24, pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter and was
sentenced to 15 years in prison. <br>
Bragg had been playing the online fantasy role-playing computer game for
hours and appeared to get annoyed by his son&#39;s crying, said prosecutor
Suzanne Rossomondo. <br>
<br>
Bragg discovered his son by his playpen at least 24 hours after the child
died. The infant&#39;s heart had been punctured, causing him to bleed to
death. His ribs and left collarbone were fractured. <br>
<br>
Prosecutors originally charged Bragg with first-degree murder, but
accepted his guilty plea to the lesser charge because they did not
believe he intended to kill his son. &quot;I think it was a horrible case
of neglect,&quot; Rossomondo said. <br>
Circuit Judge Rex Barbas added five years&#39; probation to the end of
Bragg&#39;s prison sentence. <br>
<br>
Bragg&#39;s former wife, Brandy L. Rozier, left their son with Bragg after
she lost electricity at her home. She also dropped off Bragg&#39;s 4-year-old
stepson. <br>
<br>
Bragg kept his 9-month-old in a playpen in a 4- by 8-foot utility closet
that contained the air conditioner and heater. Authorities found pizza in
the kitchen, but an associate medical examiner said the infant was
undernourished. <br>
Bragg originally said he was carrying his son when the child&#39;s head,
chest and shoulder slammed into a door frame. <br>
Before he was supposed to drop off his son at a relative&#39;s home, Bragg
noticed his son was not breathing. He called 911. <br>
The boy&#39;s mother, who is separated from Bragg, has two other children.
Both are in state custody. <br>
Rossomondo said she told the child&#39;s mother about the plea deal.
&quot;She was very happy about it,&quot; Rossomondo said. <br>

I play EverQuest, therefore I am going straight to Hell (I have to kill
someone first, though, hang on) <br>
Wednesday, January 3, 2001 - 2:01 PM EST Just when you thought it was
safe to have some fun. Bleh.<br>
<br>
The <font color="#0000FF"><u>St. Petersburg Times</u></font> is reporting
that Tony Bragg, 24, has been sentenced to <font color="#0000FF"><u>15
years in prison</u></font> for the murder of his 9-month-old son. Since
this is an MMOG - related website (Your Massively Multiplayer Network!),
you&#39;ve probably guessed that it has to be tied in here somewhere,
right?<br>
<br>
Sadly, yes. From the <font color="#0000FF"><u>article</u></font>:<br>
<br>
<br>
TAMPA -- As his 9-month-old son cried last July, Tony Lamont Bragg Sr.&#39;s
mind was on something else: a computer game called
<font color="#0000FF"><b><u>Everquest</u></b></font>.<br>
<br>
Authorities believe Bragg squeezed Tony Jr. to keep him quiet, then left
him unattended in a utility closet in their Temple Terrace apartment for
more than 24 hours. The boy died.<br>
<br>
Bragg had been playing the online fantasy role-playing computer game for
hours and appeared to get annoyed by his son&#39;s crying.<br>
<br>
<br>
You know, I&#39;m not here to scold the father because he put a video game
above his child as much as I&#39;m concerned that video games are gonna be
scapegoated again. I think everyone can think of choice words for him in
regards to what he did (&quot;HELLO. YOU&#39;RE A GOD DAMN IDIOT.&quot;).
What I&#39;m most upset about is people are not going to focus on the fact
that someone <b>KILLED THEIR OWN KID</b>, but that there was a certain
<font color="#0000FF"><u>video game</u></font> involved. And, of course,
we all know that <font color="#0000FF"><u>Dungeons and Dragons is
evil</u></font>.<br>
<br>
D&amp;D has become the scapegoat of suicides, murders, rapings, Mickey
Mouse sightings, depression, and any other number of various childhood
incidents. <font color="#0000FF"><u>Articles abound</u></font> from
fanatics that claim that these games <font color="#0000FF"><u>are
evil</u></font>.<br>
<br>
Stratics writer <font color="#0000FF"><u>Darien Kane</u></font> recently
published an outstanding essay on <font color="#0000FF"><u>this very
topic</u></font>:<br>
<br>
 From then on, all kinds of &#39;renowned&#39; authors started attacking RPGs,
mainly poor Dungeons and Dragons. <b><i>&#39;The Truth about Dungeons and
Dragons&#39;</i></b>, by a lady called Joan Hake Robie, attains a level of
intellect matched only once in history when OSI decided to implement Stat
Loss in Ultima Online. The author writes: <b><i>&quot;Dungeons and
Dragons is not a game. Some believe it to be a teaching [sic] the
following:&quot;</i></b>. She then lists 22 activities, including
blasphemy, assassination, insanity, sexual perversion, homosexuality,
prostitution, Satan worship, and necromancy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, you know what? I&#39;m sick of that crap. <br>
<br>
I play EverQuest. Guess what! I:<br>
<br>
<font face="Symbol">┬À &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> Am
not Christian.<br>
<font face="Symbol">┬À &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> Am
socially active.<br>
<font face="Symbol">┬À &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> Am
responsible for my well-being.<br>
<font face="Symbol">┬À &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> Am
not going to Hell.<br>
<font face="Symbol">┬À &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> Okay
maybe I am going to Hell, but for different reasons.<br>
<br>
<br>
The fact is is that video games, movies, and other products of the
entertainment industry have fast become the best excuse for parents who
don&#39;t feel like keeping an eye on what their kids are doing. It&#39;s quite
easy to place blame on EverQuest and such just because you don&#39;t feel
like rocking your damn baby to sleep. There are games out there that
might not be appropriate, sure. But it is NOT THE GOVERNMENT&#39;S JOB to
keep an eye on your kids. That&#39;s YOUR responsibility.<br>
<br>
Hell, the issue here isn&#39;t games at all. You can make all sorts of new
sentences out of that newspaper article. For example:<br>
<br>
<br>
As his 9-month-old son cried last July, Tony Lamont Bragg Sr.&#39;s mind was
on something else: his last OTB bet.<br>
<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
<br>
As his 9-month-old son cried last July, Tony Lamont Bragg Sr.&#39;s mind was
on something else: where his next hit of heroin was coming from.<br>
<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
<br>
As his 9-month-old son cried last July, Tony Lamont Bragg Sr.&#39;s mind was
on something else: the mutant space-donkey from the planet Zanzabar
that&#39;s bearing his illegitimate child.<br>
<br>
<br>
Or insert your favorite misdemeanor. It doesn&#39;t matter.<br>
<br>
If you don&#39;t want your children to play video games, that&#39;s fine. I
assure you that game developers want the best for your kids. Conversely,
you should *probably* (note sarcasm) take care of your baby first before
you settle down for some D&amp;D action. One of my guildmembers has a
9-month old son. He has cut back on his playtime drastically because he
realizes that THE KID COMES FIRST. We miss him, sure. But we&#39;re equally
glad that he realizes what his priorities are. Another of my dear friends
is an EQ addict, MARRIED to one, yet still finds the time to raise a 12
year old son and a 10 year old daughter, both wonderfully healthy and
happy.<br>
<br>
You shouldn&#39;t blame the game. It&#39;s not the game&#39;s fault. Suck it up and
take some damn responsibility.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NecroGod, of the <font color="#0000FF"><u>EQSS Westwood Tavern</u></font>
(you can find a busy thread about this topic
<font color="#0000FF"><u>here</u></font>) says it quite nicely.<br>
<br>
<br>
The mother is <b>FRIGGIN HAPPY</b> that he got a lesser sentence! <b>WAKE
UP BITCH, YOUR SON IS DEAD, MURDERED BY HIS FATHER!</b> In my opinion,
she should join him in prison.<br>
<br>
This is also yet ANOTHER example of not pinning the blame where blame is
due. The very first line of the article plainly sets the scene that it
was the father&#39;s involvement in EQ that made him kill his son, not his
ever-present drug problem or mental deficiencies or anything like
that.<br>
<br>
Why the hell can&#39;t people take responsibility for their own actions, and
why is the press so afraid to blame somebody directly? Why must it be a
video game that made somebody tweak, or a movie that made somebody freak
out?<br>
<br>
Screw the media, burn the father, bury the mother. All I can picture over
and over is that poor, innocent child alone and lost inside a CLOSET
while he bled to death.<br>
<br>
<br>
Amen.<br>
<br>
I think my feelings are best summed up by this Usenet post:<br>
<br>
<br>
...D&amp;D is not to blame for the problems with youth, as well as video
games. It is honestly the parents&#39; fault, and you all are too damn
delusional to deal with the fact that maybe you aren&#39;t the biblical,
saintly parents you think youselves to be. Get a life and deal with your
own problems. It&#39;s your fault, not the video games, music or Dungeons and
Dragons or other such RPG. Learn about something before you go judging
it. Thank you for your time and please go to hell.<br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe, Mr. Bragg, you should have held off on camping that Ghoul Lord and
LEARNED HOW TO BE A PARENT FIRST.<br>
<br>
Quit giving people who play these games a bad name.<br>
<br>
<b>Update:</b> <font color="#0000FF"><u>AVault</u></font> updated their
coverage with this <font color="#0000FF"><u>story</u></font> that
minimizes the role, if any, EverQuest played in the homicide. Here&#39;s a
clip:<br>
<br>
EverQuest was merely the preoccupation of the moment for Bragg, Littman
added, saying it could have just have easily been televised football or
any other occupation of men in their twenties, instead. &quot;Bragg is
sadly typical of many young people today,&quot; said Littman. &quot;He
had children before he was ready to take care of them.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
While I&#39;m glad that both sides realize the game really wasn&#39;t a factor, I
stand by my original point. Disclaimer or not, this is simply more fuel
for the fire for right-wing groups that claim D&amp;D-type games are a
cause of this type of behavior.<br>
