<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940540456">Alamak, been doing that since D&D (yes, I&#39;m a bloody old school PnP RPG<br/>
player) you complain some more, will end up with some flying parangs.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, sometimes, a friend of mine uses my EQ account when I&#39;m MIA for<br/>
a long time and she&#39;s a real S&#39;pore female......<br/>
<br/>
You all might be seeing her a bit since school is about to reopen<br/>
soon......<br/>

&gt; (Subjective) Anyhow...this really breaks my heart...all those babes<br/>
&gt; might not be babes after all...below that lacy leather armor lies a<br/>
&gt; hairy chest??Guess I&#39;d better check if Ricecooker is actually male or<br/>
&gt; female...LOL No offense Sereph...just that you crushed my hopes of<br/>
&gt; finding some medievial virgins and such... *grin*<br/>

&gt;      Singapore!! Come to think of it..is anyone even interested?<br/>
&gt;       FP far meh? level 6 more than enough to travel there. Just<br/>
&gt;      bank everything and sprint to BB and take the boot to FP.<br/>
&gt;      The whole journey is pretty much Mob free, my bard made it<br/>
&gt;      to FP at level 5-6 I think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      And nope, I don&#39;t get on Kali much. My nick there is Garford<br/>
&gt;      anyway. I use Sereph ONLY for RPG games<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      [Useless fact of the day: I never ever played a male<br/>
&gt;      character in an RPG game(be it PnP ones or electronic ones),<br/>
&gt;      unless I have no choice in the gender and the 2 most used<br/>
&gt;      names are Sabella and Sereph in that order]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      And hell no, I&#39;m not a castration fanatic. I only castrated<br/>
&gt;      Enteri as it took him so long to do a task for me and some<br/>
&gt;      people I dislike in not so real life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Always remember this fact: Sereph is a female name.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Sereph, door to door parang saleswoman who won&#39;t take no for<br/>
&gt;      an answer.<br/>
