Both of u may have better chance.  Like I say, I nuke it for 800-1000 dam but it still alive.  It cast DoT and hit very hard.  If u can stand him hiting u like 50-60 dam per hit, and got confident to survive it&#39;s DoT and nuke it 1200 dam, I think u 2 can get it.  <br/>

It&#39;s a very rare spawn, need a ranger to track it.  I go SK so many times and only see once, when I&#39;m not prepared at all ;(</div>
