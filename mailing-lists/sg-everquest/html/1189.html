<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427545775">I finally hit 39 in Cazic after 8 hours of SG hunting in Oasis. (All<br/>
this hunting for 1/4 of a bubble)<br/>
<br/>
Everyone there was shock when they saw the SG attack me and though that<br/>
I&#39;m going to die and a few shaman dash forth to cast SOW on me, until<br/>
they see me<br/>
<br/>
Tashan-&gt; Whirl-&gt; Melee-&gt; Suffocate-&gt; Arnachy-&gt; Frost Shock-&gt; Arnarchy-&gt;<br/>
Melee-&gt; Whirl-&gt; Melee-&gt; Whirl-&gt; Frost Shock -&gt; Dead SG<br/>
<br/>
Without taking a single point of damage.<br/>
<br/>
Then I did the bloody mistake of turning off Anon, and I got a screen of<br/>
tells, begging for Clarity and Buffs. I end up giving one who annoyed<br/>
the hell out of me with Curse of the Simple Mind(-20 intelligence).<br/>
<br/>
Then, a level 20+ wiz tried to steal my kill and I response by casting<br/>
memory blur and cancel magic on the SG I was fighting + buff the SG<br/>
attack speed<br/>
<br/>
Fun seeing the SG killing the wiz in a few sec, then got itself chop by<br/>
animated my shield and parang in a minute without doing a single point<br/>
of damage to my pet. (Animations + attack speed buff + berserker<br/>
strength does a hell lot of damage and bash around twice per round)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I can use Cajoling Whispers(Charm, Invoke Fear(Fear),<br/>
Immobilise(Root), Mind Wipe(Memory Blur), Resist Magic, Shade(AC buff),<br/>
Insight(Damn, they&#39;re changing the spell from an INT buff to a WIS one),<br/>
Celerity(Attack speed increase), Rampage(Berzeker Strength) and<br/>
Pacify(Lull) + the 2 illusion spells which I&#39;ve keep in the bank for so<br/>
damn long.<br/>
<br/>
Thank god that enchanters don&#39;t rely on Research much and I can get all<br/>
the spells I need.<br/>
