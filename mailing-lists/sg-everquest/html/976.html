<div id="ygrps-yiv-622033821">Ah, To each his own.<br/>
<br/>
The following does not refer to ZIltus or anyone. Zil does raise an issue<br/>
for me to make my stand.<br/>
Bearing in mind that reputation supersede Lvling. I for one has left and<br/>
break off  from groups at HH Pass becos of stealin and &quot;Unfair&quot; spliting of<br/>
Kills.<br/>
Im much much more tolerant on Friends and Guild Members ( double Standard?)<br/>
Look. There R lotsa Orcs in HH pass and they do Spawn Fast. so i dont see<br/>
how ppl dont want to &quot;share&quot; kill. there r alway just one guy there that<br/>
will steal kill. Usally magic caster. The Copper trick works sometime and i<br/>
do used that on them. Or , the whole group could go to the tunnel and lets<br/>
all the orcs hit him hard.If there r more than one group, that be difficult<br/>
<br/>
I personnlly do NOT want to Steal just so i can  lvl. I will leave that spot<br/>
to pratice some other stuff (safefall, throwing or melee). And im VERY vocal<br/>
about steals there too. I&#39;ll use comments like &quot;Thieves and Prostitutes&quot; ,<br/>
Yes i offend ppl with my statement . It suppose too!If / When im invited in<br/>
a Group and one of a &quot;Balcklisted&quot; Stealer is there, I&#39;ll disband and not<br/>
join and Publicly announced why i did that.  Im a Monk  and i Rolepaly it<br/>
some of the time. So if the Char is Bad, neutral, good, etc,so  i dont<br/>
expect a evil char to have good moral.<br/>
 Personlly, It crazy to spend my Time and Money(isp charges) to &quot;Fight&quot; over<br/>
Orcs.I want to enjoy the game. Lvling is no Big deal :P<br/>
Hmm... maybe thats one of the reasons I lvl so slowly...I dont mind.<br/>
<br/>
There were good times at HH pass when 2 groups cna agree and share turns on<br/>
kills, 6/6 or 10/10 orcs. After a good hunt there. I will OOC to praised and<br/>
Salute the other group Civil and High standard of conduct. I will mentioned<br/>
the name of the group leader and indiviual persons in the group. I believe<br/>
this could encourage ppl to have  civility<br/>
and good behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead steal, and i&#39;ll go ahead to comment and critiize.<br/>
To each his own.  ... and bear the consequences  of bad reputations<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m now based at HH, soloing.  Downtime is long but get all the xp.<br/>
&gt; Actually if wiz wanna play punk we can rise lvl pretty fast, by stealing<br/>
&gt;(huh? Leshrec is rising lvl fast? well...errr..hehehehe).  So far what I<br/>
&gt;did is to attack the moment when the mob spawn, which normally draw the mob<br/>
&gt;to me and turn to a melee + casting battle.  This way is quite ok, but some<br/>
&gt;pple at Ro still call me a stealer.  They forget that my down time is so<br/>
&gt;long (normally used up at least 80% of my mana and 1-2 bubb of my HP).  For<br/>
&gt;this kinda pple I normally scold back or use the ignore command on them.<br/>
&gt; Those wizs in HH really &quot;aim&#39; nicely and start nuking when the mob hp drop<br/>
&gt;by 30-40% (At one time I just sit next to them and observe how they hunt).<br/>
&gt; Btw the time mob turn to them, the mob only left 10-20% HP.  If I were to<br/>
&gt;follow their style, I think I will lvl much faster, coz this method means<br/>
&gt;they just nuke 2 times (hurt more than 50%) and let others finish their<br/>
&gt;kill, and they got less down time and more loot.  H/w, this method also<br/>
&gt;spoil a wiz reputation and not very nice to do, so I choose the harder way.<br/>
&gt; So for all the new comers out there, pls do not make noise if a wiz is<br/>
&gt;using his body to tank and got a kill just becoz he kill faster then u.<br/>
&gt; Make him frustrated he may change his mind and start &quot;stealing&quot; from u,<br/>
&gt;hehe.  If u wish to take turns to kill, pls ask when u enter a camp.  Me<br/>
&gt;personally quite bo chap if those high lvl players just step in and start<br/>
&gt;hunting.  My opinion is - if they just step in and hunt, they are trying to<br/>
&gt;compete for kills, so no need to give way.  I ever come across a necro from<br/>
&gt;Higher Order of Arcane at lvl 16 (name is Malten), and he spam me for<br/>
&gt;stealing his kill, simply becoz I nuke and his pet attack same time.  Of<br/>
&gt;coz, my nuking is far more damaging than his little pet, draw the mob to me<br/>
&gt;and he spam all the way.  So irritating that I use the ignore command on<br/>
&gt;him, heheh.  Btw, one of the big stealers at HH now is Senear, the lvl 17<br/>
&gt;wiz, also from Higher Order of Arcane.  He and another guildmate of his<br/>
&gt;were nuking whole day at HH yesterday.  They steal from groups of lvl<br/>
&gt;18-20+ melee fighters.  In the end the other groups all invite me to join<br/>
&gt;theirs becoz they can see I only nuke and dun steal, and my nuking plus<br/>
&gt;their melee can take back some kills.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Last piece of advice, if u are camping at certain spot, and a wiz of lvl 16<br/>
&gt;(below lvl 16 we still quite sux, hehe) and above is also camping there,<br/>
&gt;either ask for rotation or move elsewhere.  A wiz can steal from a melee<br/>
&gt;char of 8-10 lvl above him.  No joke.  Even if you are are in a full house<br/>
&gt;of melee chars of the same lvl as that wiz, the wiz can still steal, if he<br/>
&gt;wants.  So if the newcomers come across this kinda CB players, it&#39;s wiser<br/>
&gt;to move on to another camp, coz it&#39;s only waste of time to stay there (u<br/>
&gt;are helpnig him to kill only).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Btw, even wiz can be quite guai lan at time, but IMHO the most seah-lan is<br/>
&gt;high lvl enchanter.  Not only they just hunt by charming mobs to kill<br/>
&gt;themselves (ie hunt without even using their hands, heh). Make them<br/>
&gt;frustrated they can train all the mobs on u, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;FYI, if u hunt around NRo, there is a PvP dwarf name Broughm who like to<br/>
&gt;train SG to non-PvP players, I bet this is the only way he can kill those<br/>
&gt;non-PvP players.  Kinda sick minded - kill for the fun of killing.  He<br/>
&gt;train cutts to me twice, one time almost kill me and 2nd time killed<br/>
&gt;himself, heh.<br/>
