 1. Been a pioneer in the new server, I guess I won&#39;t be far from the<br/>
 highest lvl group of players (well, maybe a big diff since I can&#39;t play EQ<br/>
 16 hrs a day, but I guess it&#39;s still better than Innoruuk).<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;I&#39;d think again because people who can afford to switch servers have more<br/>
than 16 hours a day to spare. The first guy to hit Level 50 in EQ took only<br/>
2 months.<br/>
<br/>
3. Now we are all starting from scratch, chances is that we will be having<br/>
 similar lvls as we progress in the game, that means it&#39;s much easier for us<br/>
 hunt as a team in future.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;For this, you will have to define &quot;hunt&quot;. My friend is hitting Level 19<br/>
soon but he still sticks with me in the game whenever I page him.<br/>
<br/>
4. Imagine next time you  tell ya EQ friend abt our guild &quot;Ahem, my guild is<br/>
the first guild in Prexus, blah blah blah...&quot; Kinda cool if u ask me ;)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;You have been a guildmaster before. You know its not easy to run. I&#39;ve<br/>
been playing Online Games since I was Primary 6. Not that long you might<br/>
say, but long enough to have a &quot;good view&quot; of things. Did and seen things...<br/>
<br/>
5. Lastly, been the pioneer players, our chances of becoming one of the<br/>
 highest lvl in the new server is much higher, and this give us advantages<br/>
 in role-playing in the game<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Firstly, it seems we never ever did Role-Play with all the<br/>
&quot;lah-loh-mah-ones&quot; (grins)<br/>
<br/>
If now we set up a guild in Innoruuk, we are just one of the many<br/>
 many guild available in the server and not many pple heard of us.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Once more as you know, old doesn&#39;t mean best. When I was playing in<br/>
Meridian 59. I pked 2 members from the first ever guild formed in ALL<br/>
servers, that means the first and biggest gang around. They didn&#39;t lay much<br/>
hands on me though (grins) You just need to kick them hard enough to know<br/>
you mean business? Lets not talk about EQ cos I&#39;m only Level 12 (blushes)<br/>
<br/>
But if we all have our new guild abbrev in our chars in Prexus, surely it<br/>
will catch lots of attention - since more pple will get to notice our name<br/>
as<br/>
 compared to Innoruuk.  Once we make a name, our guild will start to kill<br/>
 asses ard. ;)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;This I totally agree THOUGH it sounds contradicting to what i said before. </span></blockquote></div>
