<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; armour. I will try to assist you in finding out if I ever get the chance.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, that I&#39;m really not too sure.  But I believe the only non-clothes armor <br/>
we wiz can wear must be those super-expensive magical armor, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;I heard tanking was tough? Or do your use pets?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, unlike enchanter, magi and necro, we wiz do not have summoning spells, <br/>
sigh.  Those spell casters with summoning spells are actually a tank *and* <br/>
a mage, thou they are not tank mage.  On the other hand, our offensive <br/>
spells are the most damaging amg all spell casters, esp at the higher lvl. <br/>
 Our style is simple - all out offense - not u doom then I die ;)  I read <br/>
from an online guide which said the best defend is offense, afterall, no <br/>
need defend if u wipe all ya enemies, hehe.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;Cool! Same pattern as you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heheh.  On the other hand, I come across few lvl 4-6 players who approach <br/>
me for stuffs after they died, one time is when I just died 4 times on a <br/>
straight row.  Really dunno how these pple play.  If they want good XP, <br/>
they must group up so as to take tougher monsters.  Yet they wanan take the <br/>
risk of gaining all XP solo, and when they died, they merely go ard asking <br/>
for stuff rather than making an effort to find their corpse.  .<br/>
