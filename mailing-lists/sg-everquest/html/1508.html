<b>Subject:</b> So which RW server are we going to? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093247855">TZ or VZ?<br/>
Confirm leh, if not half go TZ half go VZ then have to start all over leh<br/>
Anyway, I think I will play a Halfling Druid. My brother wants to play a DE <br/>
Necro. So he can join the evil guild you guys are forming.<br/>
If you see me don&#39;t kill me hor, at most I cast SoW on you guys when I see <br/>
you all lah ok?<br/>
But the real question is, TZ or VZ? Can someone comfirm? Or must sit and <br/>
wait to see which is less crowded? I don&#39;t think it matters, since we will <br/>
be playing during off-peak hours anyway. Maybe except for weekends, but I <br/>
estimate should have the same number of players playing as before, maybe an <br/>
extra of 100(off-peak) to 1000(peak)(Duh). But I still want to confirm, if <br/>
not some of us end up having to change server.</div>
