<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-397228671">Hi all.  After playing EQ for a month or so, I guess it&#39;s time for us to <br/>
ponder abit on how we can play & enjoy EQ better, in term of adventuring, <br/>
grouping, lvling or camping for artifacts.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the local kakis are lvling pretty fast, some even managed to <br/>
train 2 or more mid-lvl chars by now within the short period.  This is most <br/>
obvious when we take a look in QHD, where the local kakis lvl much faster <br/>
than the other members (without stealing kills).  H/w, I think there is <br/>
still room for improvement, in all areas.  In this msg, I will only be <br/>
focusing on group(s) hunting, so as to get the BALLS start rolling (wait, <br/>
YY kena scared by ya wife until ya balls drop again? hehehe).<br/>
<br/>
1. Be realistic.<br/>
So far, all the hunting events turn out to be a corpse looting session, <br/>
which take up more than 50% of the hunt.  IMGO (in my goon opinion), I <br/>
think everyone has to be realistic.  If we are going to camp for a lvl 20 <br/>
mob, and we know that in order to reach the mob, we need to go thru&#39; <br/>
several lvl 15 mobs, it&#39;s definitely inefficient to bring along any lvl 18 <br/>
or below kakis coz we will then be spending most of the time protecting the <br/>
lower lvl kakis, if not helping him/her to loot corpse.  For eg, to camp <br/>
for Dvinn, a lvl 20 mob, it will be best to bring in a team of all lvl 20 <br/>
and above, so that we can concentrate our time camping for the mob, hunt it <br/>
down and get out of the place FAST, since all other mobs will not attack u <br/>
as they con green to us.  (NB:  This point exclude those hunting event <br/>
which we are out to wipe and rule the whole place.)<br/>
<br/>
2. Be grateful to those who help, be considerate<br/>
Everyone on the list is paying for the EQ monthly usage, the telephone fee, <br/>
and many hrs of sleepless night playing the game. If a group of tanks of <br/>
enuff lvl wish to hunt certain mob but need a high lvl caster to help <br/>
nuking the mob, I think it&#39;s only fair if the low lvl tanks show their <br/>
appreciation by offering some token to the high lvl who help.  Just like  <br/>
 the Staff of Observer hunt, I think it&#39;s only fair for Garren if we paid <br/>
him some nominal amt for his time and service.  Whether he wanna accept the <br/>
token is another story, it&#39;s the thought that counts.  Friend friend is one <br/>
thing, but this friend thingy shldnt be abused.  Can anyone imagine Garren <br/>
get msg every now and then asking him to get stuffs for his friends? <br/>
  C&#39;mon, not tat I&#39;m calculative but we shld learn to appreciate helps from <br/>
others, and be considerate at times ;)<br/>
<br/>
3. Most people don&#39;t PLAN to fail, but they fail to PLAN<br/>
a. See the key word? PLAN PLAN PLAN! ;)  Before any event, someone pls at <br/>
least dig out some info of the artifact, quest or the mob dropping the item <br/>
from the net - it&#39;s easily accessible.<br/>
b. Be puntual.  Ok I know this is hard, esp when we have students, working <br/>
class, idling personal (ops sorry Garren, hehe) etc in the local community. <br/>
 That&#39;s why I always plan events on Fri/Sat night, where most pple are free <br/>
and dun have to worry abt working the next day.  Getting the relevant lvl <br/>
players to participate in the event is also impt, so that no time is waste <br/>
to fetch other pple.  If u wanan participate in the event, at least arrange <br/>
to meet those who know the assembly venue to bring u there, IN ADVANCED. <br/>
 Dun wait till last mintue than msg all say &quot;I&#39;m at xxx, can someone come <br/>
to fetch me blah blah blah&quot;.  If my UO members from all over the world can <br/>
meet at certain time (some even wake up at 4am for guild meeting), I see no <br/>
reason the local kakis cant make an effort to achieve it ;)<br/>
<br/>
c. Be prepared.  Nothing is more anoying than to see the following <br/>
situation.<br/>
A : Ah, everyone is so puntual today, let ROCK!<br/>
B, C, D, E : Yeah yeah, let rock! WOWOWOWO!<br/>
F : Sorry guys, no more food, drink and reagents, can someone spare me <br/>
some, summon for me, OR gate me back to town purchasing, OR teleport to <br/>
town and buy for me?<br/>
&quot;NAH!&quot; *A, B, C, D, E all point their middle fingers to F&#39;s nose, mouse, <br/>
earholes, assxxxx*<br/>
<br/>
4.Patient, Effective, Efficient<br/>
- Patient.  If we set our mind to hunt Dvinn, then be patient to wait for <br/>
it to spawn.  Dun suga suga show off and hunt other mobs with one swing or <br/>
one nuke.  Yeah no doubt it&#39;s very facinating to show those newbies how <br/>
powerful you are, but hey, why are you here in the first place?  And when <br/>
the mob spawn, you are either resting or OOM.<br/>
- Efficient.  At places which is heavily camped, casting the 1st spell on <br/>
the mob may mean you get it or not.  Eg, when I camp in Ziltus Hill (hehe), <br/>
group of lvl 20 casters wanna fight kill with me.  When the trainer spawn, <br/>
I&#39;m always the 1st one to hit it with a spell that hurt it more than 50%, <br/>
and the other casters r jus helping me to finish up the job.  Do some <br/>
timing (eg aviak guards take 6-7 min to spawn, pickclaw 13 min, trainer 16 <br/>
min etc), manage your time so that you can get fully med and rest b4 the <br/>
spawn.  You can chit chat and sing song, but when the spawn is near, you <br/>
better stay alert and watch out for it.<br/>
- Effective. Sometime nuking with the most damaging spell is not always a <br/>
sure-win situation.  Eg, when a lvl 40 enchanter help her friend to get <br/>
kills in Ziltus Hill, I think she is casting the most powerful nuking spell <br/>
she has.  H/w, I only using the 3rd most powerful spell I got to get all <br/>
the kills.  Wonder why?  COZ...my 3rd most powerful spell, no doubt not as <br/>
powerful as the lvl 40 enchanter, but it cast FASTER and hurt the train for <br/>
more than 50% HP.  So when the enchanter&#39;s spell hit the mob, she is just <br/>
helping me to wipe the floor.  Simple as it is ;)  Nuking with the most <br/>
powerful spell is not always the one who stand up with a wining smile - we <br/>
have to &quot;eat brain&quot; sometimes, not &quot;eat grass&quot; ;)<br/>
<br/>
5. Get the RIGHT team<br/>
Get the right party for the hunt.  For train-proned places like dungeons, <br/>
dimiss the pet.  For places with fast random spawns, get some tanks and at <br/>
least a healer.  For places where firepower mean sure-win (eg double or <br/>
solo aviak guards), get some bombers with u.  For places of unknown and <br/>
danger, get a balance group.  Having good team work is a good starting step <br/>
to a successful hunting trip, but getting the wrong party combo may mean <br/>
you r stepping on the wrong path.  Eg when there is so many players crowded <br/>
in the CB tower, one lvl 29 wiz will work better than a group of 3 lvl 30 <br/>
warriors.  On the other hand, in Runnyeye, a lvl 29 paladin can last longer <br/>
than a group of 3 lvl 30 wiz.  See the light? ;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not the best player around, but merely rising some points which I think <br/>
we have to ponder them in depth.  No doubt it&#39;s sometime fun to have those <br/>
&quot;U DIE I DIE&quot; kinda hunting, but in the long run, we shld work out <br/>
something better and more enjoyable  ;)<br/>
