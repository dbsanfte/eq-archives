<div id="ygrps-yiv-402106411">If u WAIT for others to hurt mobs first (esp mob HP drop by 10-40% already) <br/>
then u start nuking, IMHO tat&#39;s stealing.  But if u start nuking the moment <br/>
u see mob spawn, and u hit it SLIGHTLY slower than those melee classes <br/>
simply bcoz u need some casting time, I dun take it as stealing.   I dunno <br/>
what others in the list think, but tat&#39;s how I play ;)<br/>

&gt; Hi Ziltus!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stealing is when you attack someone else&#39;s target which they are <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; fighting is it?<br/>
&gt; If i see one first and nuke it before anyone else touches it...it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; considered<br/>
&gt; stealing?Just need to clarify...i&#39;m not that high lvl yet and i&#39;m only a<br/>
&gt; magician<br/>
&gt; but i think we&#39;re supposed to be the next nukers after wiz. Not too sure<br/>
&gt; though.<br/>
&gt; I never interrupt someone&#39;s battle unless it looks like they really need<br/>
&gt; help so<br/>
&gt; i guess it&#39;s ok hmmmm....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;So if the newcomers come across this kinda CB players, it&#39;s wiser<br/>
&gt; to move on to another camp, coz it&#39;s only waste of time to stay there (u<br/>
&gt; are helpnig him to kill only).&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This CB is CrushBone right? *Innocent look* LOL<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m now based at HH, soloing.  Downtime is long but get all the xp.<br/>

&gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; pple at Ro still call me a stealer.  They forget that my down time is <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; they just nuke 2 times (hurt more than 50%) and let others finish their<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill, and they got less down time and more loot.  H/w, this method also<br/>
&gt; &gt; spoil a wiz reputation and not very nice to do, so I choose the harder<br/>
&gt; way.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  So for all the new comers out there, pls do not make noise if a wiz is<br/>
&gt; &gt; using his body to tank and got a kill just becoz he kill faster then u.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; theirs becoz they can see I only nuke and dun steal, and my nuking plus<br/>
