<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843593283">Hi guys, still remember me?  Ziltus Planeswalker ;)<br/>
<br/>
Can I check with u guys, if I stop payment for my EQ acct, will Verant <br/>
delete my chars?  I&#39;ve not been playing EQ for almost 1/2 yr and was paying <br/>
U$9.95 every month.  With the new land coming up in UO, I intend to <br/>
re-activate my 2nd UO acct (more chars to own house) and stop paying for my <br/>
EQ acct.  Say if Verant dun allow me to stop pym (provided I wanna keep my <br/>
chars), how much can I sell my wiz acct in EQ (with the best enchanter <br/>
jewelries for wiz, Jboot, robe and staff etc)?<br/>
<br/>
Thx.</div>
