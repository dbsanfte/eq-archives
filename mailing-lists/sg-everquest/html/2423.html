<div id="ygrps-yiv-712821063">Candidates	- All lvl 30 & above kakis who wish to have a ROO<br/>
		  (Only 1 team, priority will be given to casters w/o ROO and Fesse)	<br/>
Venue		- OOT, Oracle Island<br/>
Date		- Coming soon<br/>
<br/>
The oracle has a sure 100% drop for ROO, a dream robe for casters.  She is <br/>
lvl 35.  The main problem is the lvl 40 paladin that guard her (overpowered <br/>
I presume).<br/>
<br/>
Plan is to let Fesse cast Atone on paladin, so that he will not attack, <br/>
while the rest nuke the hell out of the oracle and loot it.  I will then <br/>
gate the whole party out. Not sure how fast the oracle will spawn.  But we <br/>
can always go for it again.<br/>
