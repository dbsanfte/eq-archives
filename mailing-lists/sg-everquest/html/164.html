 If U need a Tank,U could call on me..Currently a Level3 DarkElf Warrior :P<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Hehe, too bad I&#39;m not near your province. Even though its made in such a<br/>
way that a low level player when grouped with a tougher one will earn<br/>
extremely little exp, but there is also another way out ;-)<br/>
<br/>
BTW,What type of drinks and food do u guyz usually buy?Cant seem to find the<br/>
type where u get when u die during ya first 4 levels.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Those types can be bought at certain stores. Those cakes can be found at<br/>
the bakers in Qeynos. However, I only eat Muffins and Milk. &lt;&lt;Cheapest and<br/>
last just as long as Iron Rations that go for about 1 gold.&gt;&gt; However at<br/>
hunting, don&#39;t stintch &lt;spello&gt; just buy those Water Flasks and Bread<br/>
Loaves. Helps to clear the money weight too.<br/>
