&gt; Yesterday, at around 10:30am, I finally attain the 12th rank of spells<br/>
&gt; for my enchanter. After that, I happilly log out of CT, and went to<br/>
&gt; Inno, to do a bit of the Stein quest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night, while I was hunting birdies with Kalandra in lake, using my<br/>
&gt; cleric, I ganna GM warp to Qeynos Aquaducts(aka GM torture room) for<br/>
&gt; questioning. During this time, I was totally LD, and Kalandra&#39;s HP was<br/>
&gt; quite criticle when I got back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why did the damn GM teleport me for? Well, they think that the reason<br/>
&gt; why my enchanter is leveling up so quicky is because I&#39;m either hacking<br/>
&gt; their servers or exploiting bugs. I yell at them for several minutes,<br/>
&gt; made some rude signs, and they agree to let me go, while they<br/>
&gt; investigate the matter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This morning, log in to CT, play for a while, then another blasted GM,<br/>
&gt; this time an a Verant admin, and he/she/it apologize for the treatment<br/>
&gt; they did and will discuss some more, about my request, to keep this<br/>
&gt; thing harsh harsh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pray that the request is done because..... my request was for a server<br/>
&gt; teleport to Innoruuk :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sabella Anna Estasis, Enchanter of the 12th Rank.<br/>
