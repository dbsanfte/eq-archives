<div id="ygrps-yiv-172281001">Wah kow, just looted a shield and said it&#39;s in the bank?  That asshole is <br/>
either a retarded idiot OR he think you guys are retarded idiots, hehehe.<br/>
<br/>
So far other than the local kakis, I only trust my other 2 HK friends (both <br/>
lvl 14, bard and magi).  The rest not so reliable, thou&#39; occasionally I <br/>
meet some really nice guys.  Last night I was hunting at Ro with my magi <br/>
friend, helping him to lvl to 14 (until he gained lvl at 2am then I logout <br/>
and bath).  During the hunt I must thank Garren running all the way from <br/>
Befallen to bring me the desmask collar (I wonder which is better? desmask <br/>
or woven collor, both ac2 and sell same price to npc).  Anyway aother group <br/>
of lvl 9-12 was there, and they always act blur and attack our kills. H/w, <br/>
we use the magi nuke, wiz root and pet tank followed by both magi/wiz nuke <br/>
further, and killed all our preys within 10 sec.  So they lan lan keep <br/>
apologized saying they confused blah blah blah...and the same excuse again <br/>
and again.  Initially we also smile smile explaining to them since they <br/>
just killed the previous, so this is our etc (I think they also thought we <br/>
are retarded idiots who cannot see they hunting cutt when we mediating, <br/>
actually we can &#39;see&#39; using the targetting hokey to sense monster <br/>
spawning).  In the end we also sian liao and we just kill when our turn <br/>
comes - no word or explaination.  THEN they learn their lesson - they still <br/>
keep running to the cutt, but the moment they see our spells hitting the <br/>
cutt, they start to backoff, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
At 1am, the whole damn camp is very crowded, and many groups come in and <br/>
anyhow killed.  So my friend and I just heck care abt the order (since no <br/>
one is following) - we just nuke, climb hill med, then come down again <br/>
start nuking w/o bothering who kills is that.  No one make noise, coz we <br/>
also take few min to med and chance is there are few cutt spawned in <br/>
between.<br/>
<br/>
A thumb of rule when everybody stealing kill - either steal FASTER than <br/>
them, or proceed to next spawning ground (no point wasting time, mana and <br/>
HP helping the bastards to get kills).<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Is Phenix a human melee player?  I remember teaming with a guy name<br/>
&gt; similar<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; and he is the KNN CCB PCB HGK who loot everything whenever he got the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; chance even thou we all agreed to do alpha loot b4 the hunt.  I think<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; are always bastards and looters everywhere, whether in UO or EQ.  My<br/>
&gt; style<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; is simple - steal kill from these bastards.  These few days I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; hunting solo in Ro Derv Camp, and there are always 1-3 groups who <br/>

&gt; normal<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; that other parties will get at least 1 kills b4 I come down from the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; mountain with full mana, if not 2 kills per groups.  Yet many players<br/>

&gt; attack<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the 3rd monsters when I was abt to root&nuke!  WTF??!  I heck care and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; start nuking what is rightfully mine.  Within 10 sec the cutt is down <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; go and loot it.  Guess wat?  I receive a tell from a DE from the group<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt; will have to wait for them to kill 6 times b4 I get mine, hehe.  Kinda<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; shocked, but can anyone on the list enlighten me - is this the way EQ<br/>
&gt; share<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; kills?  I myself so far join several groups but none practice this.<br/>
&gt; Maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m wrong but it really sound kinda funny to me ;)<br/>
