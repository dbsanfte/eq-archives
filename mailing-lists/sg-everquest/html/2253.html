  Ok..on to in game stuff....anyone care to let us know how to get Glove of Gatecaller Quest? No idea who to go to for it.<br/>
  Also any idea on price of Oracle Robe? Zilt said he got offer of 600pp before..but i never saw any one selling it so far<br/>
  They are definitely much less common than FBR and i believe resale value will be there for quite long..so i don&#39;t mind buying<br/>
  one for 600pp actually...hmmm<br/>
<br/>
