    Subject: [sg-everquest] Crazy + Brewing...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    hiya guys,<br/>
    thanks again to u guys fer helping me out last nite for the small donation...  (i.e., Ziltus n Sereph)... i guess i took slightly more than the 5-7pp range... more like 10pp... but i was starting to make money by the 9th or 10th pp... so now i have a reasonable amount :) after brewing it fer awhile... but can be pretty boring brewing.... ok... just a few quick questions... how many of each stuff do u guys buy usuaully when u go on brewing fer 1 round? i have like 40 of each materials (ie.., hops, malt, etc)... and filled up all my backups (yes! i bought 5 backups)... n start brewing... any better method? or faster method? also.. i said b4 i m gonna return the money... although sereph u said i can keep em... if u still want em... do let me know... i will return em to ya...<br/>
<br/>
    now... im thinking of picking up another trade skill... maybe tailoring... since i can make woven fer myself... can i? or cant? any advice on that? or perhaps i will work abit on my levels b4 i start going into something... as fer that dagger yiyang is selling... someone was selling his fer 40pp only...<br/>
<br/>
    once again... thanks guys fer the help...<br/>
