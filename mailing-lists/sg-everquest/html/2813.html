<b>Subject:</b> 256k Magix + EverQuest = Low Lag ??? Please comment! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-7428226">Who is using Magix to play EverQuest? Care to share ur experience with us? Have<br/>
any of u experience bad lag?<br/>
<br/>
My ping/lag used to be very good until 2 days ago. Since then, everyday I went<br/>
home from work (around 8pm) and log into EQ, my lag meter show constant 60%<br/>
packet lost for incoming and outgoing data. The strange thing is my ping is VERY<br/>
good, it&#39;s around 200-300 constantly for incoming and outgoing data. Because of<br/>
the huge packet lost, I was not able to enjoy the game. But things started to<br/>
get better at around 10:45pm, my ping remains the same and my packet lost drop<br/>
till less than 10% for incoming and outgoing.<br/>
<br/>
What is wrong with Magix? Should I switch to cable? Cable user pls comment.</div>
