&gt; May I know which mob carry the key to Jboot room?  Where can I find it?<br/>
&gt;  What lvl is the mob carrying the key and does it has other guard mobs also<br/>
&gt; (what lvl if yes)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How abt the room tat drops Jboot?  What mobs and lvl inside?  I heard tat<br/>
&gt; room is tougher than Najena room (of coz Najena herself is still the<br/>
&gt; toughest mob in the dungeon) due to those necro guards which can charm<br/>
&gt; players.  What other artifacts can we find in the room?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All info welcome, thx.<br/>
