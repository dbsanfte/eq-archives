 </span></blockquote>  Since I am playing a warrior,Do u think I should skip buying cloth armour and save for leather instead?Heres my plan on buying stuff ,plz sent any comments or opinions<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply">   &gt;&gt;Just stick to PatchWork Armour. Costs about 2pp a full suit so its darn cheap. Later in the game then slowly upgrade. I started off with PW too then slowly change to cloth &lt;monk&gt;. From cloth tunic to Snakeskin, from cap to Headband etc. You get my point right? But seriously, I&#39;d just save money for a combine weapon first. Then get a full suit of banded. Then a well-balanced long sword ;-)<br/>
