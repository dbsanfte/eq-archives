<b>Subject:</b> RE: SG kakis guild, MUST READ and MUST reply. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-44446457">See below.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From: Sereph the ParanGOON with airport runway &quot;chest&quot;<br/>
&gt; QHD has several lamers these days, and on top of that, it&#39;s hyper<br/>
&gt; inactive in activities. When was the last time, the guild got together<br/>
&gt; to do something? It acts more like a glorified shout channel. Also, when<br/>
&gt; we are planning kakis only activities and have to resort to guildsay to<br/>
&gt; communicate, random goons might join in, and ruin the experience for us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agree.  Pple like Maquis is so damn ya ya, and seem like he is stealing <br/>
kill from some guild members.  Bram for sure hate this guys.  And the local <br/>
kakis definitely got more activites organised than the total number of <br/>
guild activities held since the guild is formed day one I guess, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As a result, I propose that we get this thing together and prepare for<br/>
&gt; the guild formation by Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*Rise his 2 hands, 2 legs and his....*  Pls draft out the guild email and <br/>
we all send a copy to EQ (need 10 min to form a guild).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Basically, what I want you to do is answer this question:<br/>
&gt; Quit QHD and form a local kaki guild, yay or nay?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Then these question if you say yay:<br/>
&gt; Who should be the goondu in charge?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not me of coz.  Handling UO guild for more than 1.5 yrs is more than enuff <br/>
for me.  Nevertheless I will still support and contribute my assistance to <br/>
the GOON-IN-CHARGE. hehe.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Who should be the officals for recruiting?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Anyone will do, PROVIDED we have a guideline on what players to recruit. <br/>
 Preferably someone of higher lvls (at least can survive to reach the <br/>
candidates and recruit them la.  If died on the way to recruit candidates, <br/>
damn no face, hehe).  And I suggest not more than 5 recruiting officers. <br/>
 Each recruitment MUST be recommended by an exisiting members of membership <br/>
not less than 1 week.  No any tom, dick, harry suga suga join the guild and <br/>
introduce his big gang of 20 kakis into the guild and mess up the whole <br/>
thing.  I hope to see some kinda council formed to make certain kinda major <br/>
decisions for the guild, like to approve or not approve certain candidates <br/>
as members, mass hunting etc.  It&#39;s always good to have odd numbers of pple <br/>
in the council, so when different views arised, majority vote will win.<br/>
<br/>
So, simply, my proposal:<br/>
- GIC (Goon-In-Charge).  MUST be someone who is DAMN free (look out for <br/>
those who can power train several chars in same or diff servers, OR someone <br/>
who can play when working).<br/>
- Elders council (including GIC to make up odd number of council members so <br/>
tat we can vote when different views arise).<br/>
- Officers (It may be good idea to make officer from players of all lvls - <br/>
eg 10, 20, 30, 40, so tat officers of diff lvls can hunt with the <br/>
potiential candidates of relevant lvls to see if they r worthy to join our <br/>
guild).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The charter, who is willing to type it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>GIC or the next player who is very free.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Website, for the thousand time, anyone can get one ASAP?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>GIC or the 3rd player who is very free<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Recruting guidlines, think, and give me your opinion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>- NO KILL STEALING.  Nuking/Camping is ok thou&#39; ;)  I dun wanna be a <br/>
all-times nice guys, true nuetral most of the time.  For the sake of the <br/>
guild, at most I can be Neutral Good alignment.<br/>
- Willing to commit and stay loyal to the guild.<br/>
- Wanna set some minimal lvl for member entry?  Otherwise some lvl 1 newbie <br/>
just join us, saying he will stay loyal forever, got protection, training <br/>
and stuffs from us and then say bye bye to the guild, simply becoz he has <br/>
got what he want from the guild.  How abt someone of min 4th circle (eg lvl <br/>
12 for wiz).  4th circle is normally the lvl where a char start to achieve <br/>
some &#39;power&#39; for his class.  Just a suggestion ;)<br/>
- Team-players.  When grping, dun anyhow loot and stealing loot.  Group <br/>
discipline is impt and must be observed all time.<br/>
- Helpful to other grp members (not to the extend of baby sitting la)<br/>
