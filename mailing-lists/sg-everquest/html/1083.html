Subject: EQ Everquest players pls read<br/>
<br/>
Hi to all the Singapore Everquest players. I&#39;ll get straight to the<br/>
point :) I wish to compile a list of the Singapore players in EQ. <br/>
Why would I wanna do this? Well with this list we can easily know <br/>
which server has the most Singaporeans and also for future EQ <br/>
players another reason why they should choose a particular server. <br/>
Also this allows the already in EQ players a chance to make a new <br/>
char on those singaporan populated servers as when we play at <br/>
night it&#39;ll be early morning in USA so your friends will not be online <br/>
and so you can maybe choose to make a new char in those server <br/>
with singaporeans to play with them together. So if you play EQ, <br/>
please email me with the main server you play in, as well as the <br/>
other servers which you sometimes go to(if any). When I have a list <br/>
I&#39;ll email you back together with the list. Might also be posting the <br/>
list to my homepage. Lastly I need a small favour from anyone of <br/>
you. I bought EQ on the 1st day it was released in Singapore but I <br/>
HAVENT GOT A CHANCE TO PLAY IT YET haha. This is bcos I <br/>
dont have a credit card :( . I&#39;ll be able to apply for a card in 2 <br/>
months time(after my b/day) so in the mean time I wont be able to <br/>
play it. So Im hoping if anyone can help me by activating my <br/>
account for me. I have registered, but have not bill my account yet. <br/>
I hope someone can make a 3 months payment for me. 3 <br/>
monthscost US$25. I&#39;ll send you S$50, and when you receive the <br/>
money, then activate my account for 3 months, and you can keep <br/>
the amount thats left, as a token of my appreciation. If you&#39;ll like to <br/>
help please state this in your email. Anyway please email me the <br/>
server list. Helping or dont help activate my account is another <br/>
issue its ok nothing to do with this. I wanted to make a list to <br/>
benefit everyone. The account thingy, at most I wait until I apply for <br/>
a card :( so pls pls email me with the server list. Thanks!</div>
