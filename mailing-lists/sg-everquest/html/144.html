<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170580265">I come across players selling mana rings at 5pp in Felwithe.  I got a <br/>
cutthroat ring from Leshrec (thx, hehe).  That&#39;s my only magical item so <br/>
far, +1ac and +2 dex.  Can u tell us what&#39;s the stats for Dervish ring? <br/>
 Also, mana ring is generating 5mana/sec or what?  What u mean by &quot;5 sec&quot;?. <br/>
 Is is advisable to buy for a char with 40 mediation skill?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, managed to earn a lvl with the help o fa lvl 10 Hong Kong cleric <br/>
last night at bandit camp in GF.  I&#39;ll be meeting him again tonight for <br/>
hunting again.  Hopefully I can make it to lvl 8 and earn new spells.  Any <br/>
recommendation for wiz&#39;s armor?  So far I&#39;m wearing lousy clothings only, <br/>
can&#39;t survive too long with low AC.  Not aware of any better armors which <br/>
are available for wiz (still new, no chance to see yet, hehe).  I&#39;m saving <br/>
money for a great staff but the price is damn (*#$@ expensive - 20pp!!!  I <br/>
think when I reached lvl 8, the money in my bank is not even enuff for me <br/>
to buy all the new spells, sigh.  Maybe I have a spend a night hunting all <br/>
minor monsters like wisp, skeleton and bat, no xp gain but at least can <br/>
loot stuffs to sell (waste of time sia!).<br/>
