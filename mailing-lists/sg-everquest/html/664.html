  If people start shifting to the race war server and then turn back to Innoruuk, I&#39;ll be doing...... <br/>
  4) Stop playing EQ and systematically plan the murder of the people who can&#39;t decided WTH to do. <br/>
<br/>
  The reason I still stay on this list is because of the hope that we&#39;ll some how band together and advanture around doing quest, role playing etc...... Leveling up is plain boring at high levels without friends to joke around with. Heck, I even try to bribe people to group up with me....... <br/>

     Ah, Cheng , come to Innorruk. Im here, some of us are always here. Race server?? Oooh, nice BUT im still on innoorruk, Good to take a look see how race server is like..but INNORRUK still the BASE. If some of u guys r not sure where u r goin to be, here&#39;s my suggestion.1) have a base char here in Innorruuk. Go play at Race server .u still have a fix char in Innorruk.2) Go to other servers and moonlight in all the servers and still be at  a lvl  6th 12months from now :P3) Quit Playing EQ and get a life Regarding resources... I hope we dont have a mis-understanding here..on what im about to say.We (the ppl on Innorruuk) would be most happy to share our resouces(money, items, time,life etx) with the not so &quot;regular&quot; players in Innorruuk but I dont think im going to share a 100pp item and not see it being used. It doesnt make sense. You still have my friendship, that is free and without condition :) I love to play with u guys. I give a Singapore Guild my prority. SOme of U knows that im in a Guild already. I recommend any player approaching 20th lvl to be on a guild for &quot;networking&quot;, resoucring and the utimate gaming experiences. Lvling is NOT the game or just a goal. Enjoy the journey and take in the adventure. Xp comes along with it. Stick to 1-2 chars for heavens Sake ! wait till u reach lvl 30 or so to have muti char.  Yiyang&#39;ing Loudy at Innorruuk  <br/>

       This is an atempt to make us a tad more organise <br/>
      We will from now onwards, be 100% base on Innoruuk. Anyone who disagree, give me your address and I&#39;ll force you to agree with a parang. <br/>
<br/>
      This is the short list of characters we have, please fill it up. <br/>
<br/>
        Name     Character    Class     Race       Level   Location <br/>
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/>
        Sereph   Sereph       Bard       Half Elf  3       Greater Faydark <br/>
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/>
        LKW      Ziltus       Wizard     High Elf  12      Freeport <br/>
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/>

        Entreri  Radeon       Monk       Human     4       Freeport<br/>
      <br/>
      Groups will be form base on levels. Each member in the group should not have a level difference of more than 3/4 from each other. This is to make grouping worth doing for the high level guys, and the lower level ones. <br/>
<br/>
      If possible, please summit a character report every friday night indicating your current level/where you are/what items you&#39;ve found etc......... <br/>
<br/>
      So far, here are the groups: <br/>
<br/>
      Group 1, Level 15-19 -&gt; Alex(Tank) <br/>
      Group 2, Level 10-14 -&gt; LKW(Magic support) <br/>
      Group 3, Level 5-9 -&gt; ??? <br/>
      The rest who are still very low level-&gt; Enteri(Tank), Sereph(Secondary Support) <br/>
<br/>
      Anyone who change server, or propose a change of server without a valid reason will be forced to treat everyone on the list to lunch, for a week, so, don&#39;t anyhow change servers.</div>
