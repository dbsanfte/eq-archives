<b>Subject:</b> Sorry, I&#39;ll be staying in CT <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-632205353">Sorry, but I think I&#39;ll be better of staying in CT. It&#39;s pointless for me to <br/>
play in Innoruk, considering the fact that most of you people there are in <br/>
their mid-30s. My lowly Rogue will take too long a time to even catch up <br/>
with all of you, if ever. So I have decided to stay in CT. Good luck in <br/>
Innoruk.<br/>

If you ever come to CT drop me a msg<br/>
<br/>
PS. I love playing shorty races :)</div>
