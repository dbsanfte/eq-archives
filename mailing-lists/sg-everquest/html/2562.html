<div id="ygrps-yiv-235029230">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve stopped playing EQ for almost 2 weeks or more, and <br/>
surprisingly I didn&#39;t missed it at all.  ;)<br/>
I login UO once every 2-3 nights, to help my UO guild to settle some <br/>
training and guild matters, I play Jagged Alliance 2 (wow it&#39;s a damn cool <br/>
game, the content is really solid), I watch VCDs etc...I just don&#39;t missed <br/>
EQ, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m very tired with the lvling, hunting and camping.  Let&#39;s face <br/>
it, there isn&#39;t much we can do in EQ others than the 3 things I mentioned. <br/>
 With those coming major patch in UO, I start to think UO is a much better <br/>
game (esp in term of role-playing elements).  I can organise tournaments, <br/>
PvP training, PK hunting, server wars, big sales in my guild shop Asmandi, <br/>
or even spend time training my craftman char (yes, you can earn big buck in <br/>
UO by role-playing a trademan).  Other than the hunting, most of the other <br/>
elements in EQ are kinda screwed - economy is unrealistic, merchants are <br/>
eating grass, guild war are not well-established, grp hunting for more than <br/>
1 grp damn messy.  In fact, now I start to think the lvl limitation in EQ <br/>
is not as team-friendly as UO (probably due to UO is skill-based while EQ <br/>
is lvl-based).<br/>
<br/>
As stated in CGW few months back, EQ is a great hack & slash RPG, where <br/>
hunting will  take up 80% of the events (the bulk of the remaining time <br/>
spend on idleing and running, hehe), while UO has much deeper RPG elements. <br/>
 I think both games are great, and depending on my perference, EQ just give <br/>
me a feeling that it has lesser &#39;keep-on-playing&#39; value.  In fact, the <br/>
initial reasons I came to EQ from UO is becoz UO is laggy, and I got a <br/>
demi-god acct in UO, nothing more to do.  H/w, after coming to EQ, I <br/>
noticed I grow bored even faster, hehe.  Now with the coming new feature of <br/>
UO, I&#39;ll for sure go back to UO.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think my wiz is a high, err, very high lvl char, but I have no <br/>
problem doing most of the things I wanna do - travelling all ard, lvling <br/>
sololy, KS (if I want), grping etc.  I think I&#39;m those kind who like to <br/>
solo at least half the time, and yet able to grp with others when team-work <br/>
is required (That&#39;s why I never select bard, which is a almost grp-based <br/>
char.  No offence DF, just personal perference, heh).  In UO, I also spend <br/>
more than half the time doing my own stuffs, and UO does have lots of <br/>
things for me to do sololy, other than hunting/lvling.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I need to cut my gaming expense.  I&#39;ve been crazy for the past 2 <br/>
yrs, playing so many online RPG (max record is 3 UO accts and 1 EQ acct). <br/>
 I think I need to spend more time with family.  I&#39;ve already terminated my <br/>
2nd UO acct, and will do the same for my 3rd UO acct.  I&#39;m still keeping my <br/>
main UO acct, since it is my &quot;blood & tear baby&quot; for 2 yrs.  As for EQ...I <br/>
guess I will con&#39;t to hold on to end of this yr, I try.  If there aren&#39;t <br/>
much good new attractions, I guess I will sell away the acct by end of Dec <br/>
99.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m now looking for those session RPG online game like Neverwinter night <br/>
(Baldur&#39;s Gate like), Diablo 2 and few others cool games coming this X&#39;mas <br/>
season.  Basically I wish to avoid touching those games which will get me <br/>
addicted day and night (boy you can&#39;t imagine I wake up 3 times a night <br/>
macroing my GM smith, for more than a week), those &#39;full-time online RPG&#39;s <br/>
like UO and EQ.  Good thing about &#39;session&#39; online RPG is that you can play <br/>
for 2-3 hrs and forget abt it, and doesn&#39;t cost you an extra cent.  I even <br/>
buy Baldur&#39;s Gate expansion last night, thinking of solving it over the <br/>
weekend (I complete Baldur&#39;s Gate solo, since too many cheaters in the <br/>
net).  I&#39;m also looking for good scary adventure games (seem dying off now, <br/>
the only title I&#39;m expecting is Gabriel Knight 3), any recommendation?<br/>
<br/>
EQ is a nice game, and I&#39;m glad to know so many PERVERT kakis in the game. <br/>
 I believe there is still chances for us to meet again other than EQ.  Oh <br/>
well, this msg sound as if I&#39;m quiting, hell NO, not at this time, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Now back to the main thing.  Frankly speaking I enjoy the guild as it is <br/>
now ;P.  Like I say, I&#39;m those who enjoy soloing but yet grping sometimes <br/>
when required.  I want to be able to solo or grp with others.  Currently <br/>
this is how I play in EQ.  Not that I&#39;m anti-social, I will still give <br/>
full-support to whatever guild events, provided I&#39;m logging in ;P<br/>
<br/>
The guild is good, the guildsay spaming even better - best is all the <br/>
low-lifeform conversation and pervert talks, haha.  I really enjoy been in <br/>
the guild.  Let&#39;s hope EQ will come up with something better - and worth my <br/>
payment every month other than my UO acct.<br/>
<br/>
Ziltus Planeswalker<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
p/s: I strongly recommend Jagged Alliance 2.  It&#39;s a solid game for real <br/>
hardcore gamers.  If you looking for brainless/rushing strategy game, you <br/>
can forget abt it.  This game required LOTS of planning and coordination, <br/>
even if you play the easiest level.  There are many non-linear missions and <br/>
quests for you to enjoy.  I&#39;ll say this is the best strategy game I come <br/>
across this yr (ok, I admit I dun play alot of strategy games this yrs, but <br/>
I play all big titles like C&C2, AOE2, Warzone 2100 etc).  Btw, it&#39;s a solo <br/>
turn-based strategy game, no multiplayer feature. Abit slow paced but trust <br/>
me, you NEED the slow pace for ya brain to work, hehe.<br/>
