<b>Subject:</b> I start a Druid in Innoruk, <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-78046608">I going to start a Druid in Innoruk, Halfling to be exact. Name will be <br/>
Veteran, last name (when I hit 20) will be Soldier :)<br/>
Since no people Druid there I think I can survive lah. But damn cham, how to <br/>
catch up with all of you har? I power level my Cazic Druid for 6 hours and <br/>
managed to hit 7 in Misty, almost 8 liao. At that rate I have to powergame <br/>
like xiao to get even with all of you all.<br/>
Don&#39;t know if can do the same in Innoruk anot, hope can lah, or I also damn <br/>
sianz. See all of you level 20 I level 10 cannot group :(<br/>
One more thing, what&#39;s is everyone&#39;s name in Innoruk? List down leh, if not <br/>
I go in I also blur blur one, and what name is the guild ah? I new to this <br/>
list so don&#39;t know.<br/>
BTW, I just found this out yesterday. I am on a mapping expedition in <br/>
E.Karana and came across a spot where Gnoll Reaver (Day) and Undead Reavers <br/>
(Night) spawn. It&#39;s at the lower left corner of E.Karana and all I can say <br/>
is that they give obscene XP for their level. All con blue to my level 18 <br/>
Mage and after killing abt. 40 in a group of 3, I am almost 19 liao(from <br/>
only 1 bubble), just abt. 1/2 a bubble more. The number may be wrong, but in <br/>
a 3 way XP split, I can always see the change in my XP bar when my group <br/>
kill one. Go check it out and see for yourself. Loot wise is sucks, they <br/>
drop occasional RawHide armor and at most carry 1pp. Most is abt. a few sp <br/>
to 3gp. Last, don&#39;t think of soloing there, those Undeads ones will ignore <br/>
the pet and go straight for you. Other also cannot solo, they hit for like <br/>
30-40 and can stun.</div>
