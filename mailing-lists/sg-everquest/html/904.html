<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-900727493">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m one of the newest lousiest additions to EQ. And with advice from one or two chappies,<br/>
I chose the Innoruuk Server to start and END my life. YES..END...cos I&#39;ve died like 7-8 times <br/>
bringing my Magician up to level 5. Yep...had 2 days of leave to start my char building...<br/>
hehehe...major addict potential here...<br/>
<br/>
Now that I&#39;ve reached level 5..i still feel BROKE as always...think i only got 2plats 1 gp 1 slv 1 copper<br/>
hahahahaha<br/>
Someone tell me..are those trade skills the only way to make money fast???<br/>
Of course the only highest level beastie I&#39;ve fought so far is the Orc Centurion at their camp<br/>
in Greater Faydark...so maybe that&#39;s why the cash is kinda tight?<br/>
<br/>
Any locals feel free to say hi or wave when you see me...I&#39;d hope to see you guys too..esp. guys<br/>
closer to my level then we can groupie...er..i meant group...don&#39;t get wrong ideas hehehe<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to send some plats/gps to me!!! borrowed line from freddie aka Nicodem..uh...etc....<br/>
Tips too!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Slaying,<br/>
Synzzz aka EQ nick Zanderion <br/>
<br/>
p.s I thought you had to have fantastical names!! Until i saw RICECOOKER????<br/>
Man...i should have taken an easier nick</div>
