Greetings, denizen of Norrath! We hope this letter finds you well rested <br/>
and ready for your next adventure. This is the first monthly EverQuest <br/>
newsletter from your friends at The Station, where EverQuest reigns as the <br/>
No. 1 fantasy role-playing game on the Net.<br/>
<br/>
Check out what&#39;s new this month in EverQuest and beyond:<br/>
<br/>
***A NEW CONTINENT IS DISCOVERED!!!***<br/>

***A NEW CONTINENT IS DISCOVERED!!!***<br/>
<br/>
Intrepid explorers have returned from the edge of the EverQuest world <br/>
bearing tidings that will forever alter the history of Norrath. A new <br/>
continent, Kunark, has been found south of Faydwer beyond the Timorous <br/>
Deep. It is rumored that ships will soon set sail from Antonica and Faydwer <br/>
bound for this new world.<br/>
<br/>
You will be able to explore this new land in March of 2000, when the The <br/>
Ruins of Kunark Expansion Pack becomes available. The Ruins of Kunark <br/>
Expansion Pack will add startling new features to EverQuest, including more <br/>
than 20 new zones - lakes, jungles, crypts, dungeons, ancient towers and <br/>
underground castles.<br/>
<br/>
Kunark will contain breathtaking graphics and more object animations such <br/>
as earthquakes and other violent natural phenomena. There will be a new <br/>
playable race -- the Iksar (Lizardmen who can play as Monks). And you&#39;ll <br/>
meet visually stunning new creatures such as grey dragons, giant scorpions <br/>
and man-eating plants.<br/>
<br/>
With the Expansion Pack, you&#39;ll even be able to go beyond level 50!<br/>
<br/>
