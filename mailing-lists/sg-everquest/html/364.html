<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-682784482">I created a gnomish wizard last night, after considering all the pro and <br/>
cons.  No doubt TSK is cool, but I think we need a wiz for group gate at <br/>
higher lvl.  Moveover, with the previous experience, I feel more <br/>
comfortable making one.  Comparing all races available for wizard, gnome <br/>
seem to be the best (in fact they are more suitable for magical class then <br/>
other races).  They may not have the highest INT (acually 2nd highest), but <br/>
their overall stats are more suitable as a wiz - high INT, DEX & AGI.  Only <br/>
problem is their low CHA, which mean I&#39;m buying scrolls are 10-20% higher <br/>
than my High Elf wiz - gate scroll at 6gp instead of 5 in Felwithe.  On the <br/>
other hand, having high AGI and DEX allow me to avoid more enemies attacks <br/>
and cast faster.  I only throw in 5 for my STR, coz 60 is too low to carry <br/>
loot around.  I top up my AGI and DEX with 5 points each to 90, the rest <br/>
goes to my INT, making it 123.  A wiz life is hard for pple like me, since <br/>
I do not have more time to play as compared to those who are having their <br/>
study holiday now, but I guess I&#39;m already get used to it ;)  On yeah, with <br/>
my previous experience in Innoruuk, I can also save more money from not <br/>
buying those useless spells, hehe.  That makes up for the higher price I&#39;m <br/>
paying due to low CHA.<br/>
<br/>
I spend 5 hrs last night, getting my char to lvl 4.  No doubt Prexus got <br/>
the most players (900) amg all servers when I first login, but I encounter <br/>
no lag at all.  The whole newbie hunting ground outside gnome city is very <br/>
crowded when I just login around 7pm but at 8pm onwards, the crowded <br/>
reduced by alot, guess it&#39;s working/schooling time for most US/Canada <br/>
players then.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I&#39;ve changed my name.  Zilxxx is a nice name which I like very much, <br/>
but it&#39;s my last resort coz most of my favourite mage names are taken up in <br/>
Innoruuk.  In this new server I managed to get my favourite big bad evil <br/>
archwizard name - Mondain.  For those who grow with the 3 most popular RPG <br/>
PC games (Utlima, Wizardry, M&M), Mondain is a name that strike fear in <br/>
many Ultima players hearts.  Yes, he is the evil archwiward that fight with <br/>
Lord British in the very 1st series of Ultima!<br/>
<br/>
Now that we have a wiz, a necro, bard and a ranger.  I think it&#39;s time we <br/>
need a shaman/cleric and one more tank - warrior/paladin.<br/>
<br/>
Mondain (Wizard, Prexus)<br/>
Ziltus (Wizard, Innoruuk)<br/>
<br/>
p/s: At least now I&#39;m not always the last one to loot, LOL ;)<br/>
