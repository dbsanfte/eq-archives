<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662619812">Don&#39;t you think this is a bit rashed? I chao chao also have endure EQ for nearly<br/>
2 years now and stil manage to tahan the camping etc..... by NOT camping for<br/>
items unless friends are camping or if soloing for XP, spam guildsay or talk<br/>
cock with other people.<br/>
<br/>
They way with EQ is as you say level level level then at 50 camp items blah blah<br/>
blah, but you can do other things like run around the various karana plains and<br/>
admire the sight or enter a low level dungeon and help newbies survive, else if<br/>
you everday camp item also can go gila.<br/>
<br/>
You can also do the long boring quest that eq has, heck, if you want to kill<br/>
Lucan, just send a tell and I help take 1 HT from him before dying......<br/>
<br/>
Else do the most common thing people do when they are sick of EQ, restart! This<br/>
time around, go more slowly, wait for kakis to join up, play a diferent class,<br/>
go to other hunting grounds you have never hunt in before. This will make it<br/>
slightly more enjoyable and is a good chance to meet up with new people.<br/>
<br/>
The over level 30 population in Inno is now at at all time low with you<br/>
leaving....... Once either Zan, FF or Merns leave, I better pack up and zhao as<br/>
well.....<br/>
<br/>
Bottomline, get your arse back into EQ and slave with the rest of us........ and<br/>
if you do return, don&#39;t play for so long, play for shorter periods and forcus<br/>
more of fun and interaction.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Dued to my failure at PoF which got alot of ppl into trouble<br/>
&gt; (which<br/>
&gt; &gt; involved dying and losing the major portion of their stuff) and with<br/>
&gt; little<br/>
&gt; &gt; else to do (except like camping for stuff, which I have gotten very sick<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; tired of), I have cancelled my account as from today, Oct 26th 1999. Zand,<br/>
&gt; &gt; please give out the items to the people as I have listed down with you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Especially Weadaenye, whom I&#39;m guilty as hell to got her into a living<br/>
&gt; hell.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Please help me tell the follow people of my quiting and hope to<br/>
&gt; see<br/>
&gt; &gt; them again sometime on another game another time and Best wishes to them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Saintly, Valadine, Millie, Silph, Lunatictiara, Ader, Fost, Sparrow,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Demitry, Wlyven, Anima and Nismo/Volk (they are brothers sharing the same<br/>
&gt; &gt; account).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Everquest was, had been and enjoyable game at the beginning but<br/>
&gt; due<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the way that the game is designed it reminds me more of Evercamp,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Everbitch etc etc. It has become a torture to enter the &quot;game&quot; each day<br/>
&gt; now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This incident has at least freed me from Evercrack as some would say it<br/>
&gt; is.<br/>
&gt; &gt; So farewell my fellow guildmates. And may your time in Everquest be as<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; first day, with new and exciting adventures each day.<br/>
