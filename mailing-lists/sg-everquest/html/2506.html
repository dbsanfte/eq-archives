&gt;1. Hmm, I think it&#39;s the other way round leh.  Bolt cast faster than shock, <br/>
&gt;but it&#39;s non-guided missle and normally slightly higher dam, LOS is also a <br/>
&gt;factor when targeting.  Let me check my bolt and shock casting time <br/>
&gt;tonight.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bolt takes longer to cast as least for my current lvl.  Funny is that IT IS a guided <br/>
missile! ;)  Maybe it is lag, but last night, when Fesse and I were kiting the qeynos <br/>
guard, I can hit the guard with my cinder bolt even he is behind me!  The only thing u <br/>
have to make sure is that there is nothing blocking on the way.  With the shock, the <br/>
mob should stand within your view else it will failed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think Verant has made a pretty balance class system here. ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;3. I&#39;m talking abt the range lvl 34-38.  Magi dd inflict higher dam than <br/>
&gt;Wiz lah, no arguement on that.  FF&#39;s lvl 34 dd is more than 310, while my <br/>
&gt;lvl 34 dd is only 30X.  But even magi with a higher dd, I can easily draw <br/>
&gt;mob to me but not the other way round.  My death at lvl 35 with FF (lvl 34 <br/>
&gt;magi) and Zan (lvl 35 magi) prove it ;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have found something quite interesting here.  Just yesterday, I got the staff of <br/>
Writhing when I was in HH.  Once I tried to melee the pickclaw, they will come to me <br/>
instead of my partners.  This may either due to 1)  the - CHA effect that makes u most <br/>
hated 2) u hit the mob too hard together with your staff and DD.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;4. Magi is more of a supporting/nuking role in a grp, where wiz is pure <br/>
&gt;nuker.  There is no arguement magi is the 2nd best nuker after wiz.  And <br/>
&gt;with ya lvl 49 dd spell of 900dam, you guys are not 1/2 wiz coz our highest <br/>
&gt;dd spell is only 1200 (ie ya&#39;s is 75% of ours, not 50%), plus the fact u <br/>
&gt;guys can get tat spell easier and cast faster.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The real problem is most high lvl hunting place is dungeon where a magi is not <br/>
welcomed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;5. Overall speaking, other than dungeon, magi shld survive better than wiz, <br/>
&gt;if u play well.<br/>
