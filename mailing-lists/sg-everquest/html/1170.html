<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280013111">Hunt along the entire length of the oasis beach but go to pillar when rest.<br/>
Quite safe, especially if many ppl at pillar since SG can only target one<br/>
person at a time ) Should have enough time to run away since SG need at<br/>
least 2-3 hits to kill a person... Btw, hunt mostly crocs and deepwater<br/>
caimans at 19 since deepwater crocs are too hard for 19 (I spent almost all<br/>
my mana on deepwater croc at level 21)<br/>
Loot sucks tho, but can get about 1bub xp per hr if not very crowded, 30+ppl<br/>
in zone.<br/>

&gt;Err, wiz who like to use their body as tank?  *scatch head* hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I used to hunt in oasis for croc and caimen, but they dun seem to give xp<br/>
&gt;like HH&#39;s orcs leh.  Which part of oasis u hunt?  Is it the one near zone<br/>
&gt;along the coast?  That side can be quite crowded at times.  Any good lobang<br/>
&gt;to introduce?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As for the deepwater, they resis my spells often when I lvl 16 (esp dw<br/>
&gt;croc).  I wonder if things work better at lvl 19.<br/>
&gt;Btw, I got a VERY unluck day yesterday. Play from 2pm to night 1am, died 3<br/>
&gt;times, kena accused for stealing (when it&#39;s another guildmate who steal, a<br/>
&gt;separate msg on this matter), lost more than 1.5 bubb.  Cant find good<br/>
&gt;kakis to team up, run from HH to oasis (1. killed by a SG trained by some<br/>
&gt;gu niang, was looting didnt see SG 2. killed by a yellow orc warrior when<br/>
&gt;it left less than 3% HP, sigh), then back to HH (killed when I was justed<br/>
&gt;ONE stop away from zone).  Killed the named ocr at HH but no loot on it!<br/>
&gt; Wah piang, really kena sai man.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Just a note to all caster types out there. If you really want to gain xp<br/>
&gt;fast at level 18+, you should try out Oasis and do it SOLO. At level 21, I<br/>
&gt;managed to get about a bubble of xp per hour. Although the loot here is<br/>
&gt;poor, there is not much steal killing going on around here (Perfect for<br/>
&gt;those wizards who like to use their body as tanks *hint* *hint*) and if<br/>
&gt;really in trouble, usually can make to zone before you die. The caimans and<br/>
&gt;crocs also not very resistant to root spells and they are not very buff<br/>
&gt;either (4-5 flame shocks to take out a Deepsea caiman) Remember, the key<br/>
&gt;word is solo, if you wanna group, maybe max is 2, but best if solo. Hope<br/>
&gt;this helps =)<br/>
