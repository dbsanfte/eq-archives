<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771920310">we havent put down on blood whats the requirement, but have ssaid that when<br/>
3 offiers agree to the recuitment then go ahead. I think u have to give some<br/>
face to our guild mistress even though She/He/it may not be one of the 3<br/>
officers that agreed. GIve her face to make up for the flat  chest. make her<br/>
happy lor. Her parang is still very sharp.....also u may need the chestnut<br/>
thingy from her too.<br/>
<br/>
I support u on your recuitment. Your RL kakis mah. If u cannot recuit your<br/>
own RL friend then where got face?<br/>
So u have my &quot;approve&quot; vote :)<br/>
