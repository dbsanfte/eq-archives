               - A Role Playing switched has been added so that players may<br/>
identify other<br/>
                 characters who wish to make known they are Role Playing.<br/>
To activate the<br/>
                 Role Playing switch, target your character and type<br/>
&quot;/roleplay&quot;, if the character<br/>
                 is +PvP, the name tag above their head will appear as a<br/>
darker shade of Red,<br/>
                 whereas a non-PvP players name will appear purple. NOTE -<br/>
There is<br/>
                 currently a BUG with this switch. While in rp mode, you<br/>
will appear as<br/>
                 anonomous to anyone who does a /who on you. If guilded<br/>
however, your guild<br/>
                 title will still show.<br/>
