<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037144880">As many are awared, human races have the problems of night blindness.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to know how BAD this night blindness is, esp from the eyes of <br/>
a Erudite Wiz.  As a high elf, my lvl 1 light globe spell does help to <br/>
lighten my sight abit (as well as making my corpse glow and easy to find <br/>
it), but I&#39;m not sure if the same applies to those w/o infravision.<br/>
<br/>
At lvl 16 wiz will get a halo of light spell, which give a brighter effect <br/>
that large light stone and AC3.  Everytime I login, I sure cast this spell <br/>
and summon the head band.  I personally find the headband DOES help to <br/>
brighten my screen.  Yet again I need human race wiz to confirm that they <br/>
share the same experience.<br/>
<br/>
I once started a eru wiz in Prexus server but the night hunting really sux <br/>
for me, esp tox forest is so damn foggy.  In the end I died few times, <br/>
couldnt retrieve corpse and deleted the char liao.<br/>
<br/>
Appreciate all feedback on how to solve this night vision thingy.  Other <br/>
than this, Eru wiz shld kick ass.<br/>
