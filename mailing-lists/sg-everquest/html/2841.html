<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868631705">Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
EQ login server was down yesterday night?  Coz I&#39;ve been trying to login <br/>
for 1-2 hrs and it keep saying the login/patch server is congested, try <br/>
again in the new few min, really )*@$@$#...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ll be going back to UO for a short while, probably after this <br/>
week (at least will get to lvl 40 1st lor, hehe, hey remember u say u will <br/>
help me get staff of wheel once I get lvl 40? hehe).  The new UO land patch <br/>
is coming soon and also a reminder to those UO+EQ player in this list like <br/>
me, better start searching for a spot to place house.  I&#39;m may be given up <br/>
all my exisiting houses (including guard zone house, blocked 2S and blocked <br/>
smithy with own private mining mountain etc) for a castle in the new land.<br/>
<br/>
Wish me good luck in searching a wonder nice place to put up in UO :)<br/>
