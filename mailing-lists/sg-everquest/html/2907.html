<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941732296">I also got it, play it to lvl 10 barbarian.  Notice how many necro and sor <br/>
out there?  KNN I think even pally is more than barb. The least shld be ama <br/>
and barb. I think there is a bug in D2.  The last game which I play to lvl <br/>
10, kena kick out of game, and when I return, I go back to lvl 5!!!! *&%&%# <br/>
<br/>
In the end play again till 3am, managed to get back to lvl 9 only.  Good <br/>
thing is tat I find a very good staff tat increase quite a few of casting <br/>
skills and a set armor tunic.  Both I used to &#39;twink&#39; my sor later.<br/>
<br/>
Any sor tips pls share, I&#39;m training my barb to look for gp and magical <br/>
stuffs (barb got a skill to increase %age to find magical stuff).<br/>
<br/>
I also go a luck amulet, which I found 2 fire, 2 ruby, 3 skull and 1 emer <br/>
gems after I wear it, but knn all these gems are gone when my char crashed. <br/>
 Lucky I still got the amulet and found 1 fire, 1 ice and 1 skull gem <br/>
later...<br/>
