<div id="ygrps-yiv-740543702">I&#39;m kinda stucked at lvl 8 with no reliable kakis to team with.  Team with <br/>
a lvl 6 ranger, lvl 6 cleric and a lvl 7 bard last night in CB (crashbone <br/>
lair lah, not chxx bxx).  B4 the fight tat cleric so ya ya (he is so <br/>
confident that he make his char a pk char when he started off).  Keep <br/>
telling me he is very solid, can fight, can heal and cast spell.  The bard <br/>
also ya ya, say she always solo at CB entrance (but she really got a kick <br/>
ass axe from divnn).  In the end when we crashed with a train of 5 orc cen, <br/>
bard disband and flee herself.  Cleric kena killed very fast (too confident <br/>
that he charge whenever he see orc, even I keep asking him to let the rest <br/>
heal/med 1st).  In the end he is the 1st one who kena killed and restart <br/>
back in Felwithe.  After he run to CB entrance, got killed by orc again b4 <br/>
he finish looting his corpse, and this thing happened ard 3~4, sigh.  The <br/>
ranger is quite ok, he always try to help, but I guess he is not familar <br/>
with the area and dunno how to use zone to stay alive when the opponents <br/>
are too strong, in the end he also died 3 times.  I myself left solo alone <br/>
and earn xp for them, by using travelling across zone to keep myself alive. <br/>
 After 1.5 hrs of hunting, I also quite sian and logout liao.<br/>
<br/>
Didnt get to meet Les last night, so dunno how to go freeport.  Anyone play <br/>
in GFaydark wanna team with me?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Good choice Gary. Best to have a great long run character then being<br/>
&gt; &gt; stubborn ;-) However, I always learn my lessons too late.<br/>
