<div id="ygrps-yiv-457758908">Did u try using the /corpse comand or page for GM?<br/>
<br/>
If ya corpse is nearby, u can use the /corpse command to draw it to u. <br/>
 This command is also useful when ya corpse is nearby major spawn and u can <br/>
use it to draw ya corpse instead of looting at a dangerous area.<br/>
