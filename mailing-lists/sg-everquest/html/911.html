<b>Subject:</b> CB Hunt tonight <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604262090">Ok, this is not the normal &#39;CB&#39; we used to say in local community, for <br/>
those who are new to EQ, this CB is Crushbone.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, I mean this morning 4am, Sereph and I took a boat from FP back <br/>
to BB.  I&#39;m going to hold a CB hunt tonight, with main objectives to <br/>
collect as many SBS (Shinny Bass Shield) for local kakis and for my own <br/>
sales.  I will nuke all the orc trainers that spawn in 2-3 hrs session, <br/>
hopefully there is no higher lvl wiz ard the same place.  H/w, while <br/>
mediating, I need pple to protect me.  XP is not a concern tonight, loot <br/>
and money is.<br/>
<br/>
If u need a SBS, come to meet me and sereph at the wood elf city PoD <br/>
(Priest of Discord) Lift tonight at 9pm.  First comes first serves.  If <br/>
time allows, I will try to complete the screaming mace quest for me coming <br/>
new char ;)<br/>
<br/>
For those high lvl kakis who wish to contribute their part in helping our <br/>
pple, you are most welcome (imagine a group of 16-22 paladin, monks, wizs, <br/>
shaman etc wiping the whole CB camp, hahahahahah!)<br/>
