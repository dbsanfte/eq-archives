<b>Subject:</b> RE: Abit bout the guild thing. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-950069650">Ya ya, same opinion here.  Helping my RL friend to tat extend is personal <br/>
decision, he been my games kakis since paper AD&D, hmm, tat&#39;s 16 yrs ago <br/>
(know him since kid time, neighbour, classmates, collegue, kakis, hehe)?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when there is serious SOS msg, I will be helping also. :)<br/>
<br/>
p/s: Same thing applies for me ;)  But generally speaking, if others not <br/>
helpful, and when they seek SOS and I&#39;m free, I still dun mind helping. <br/>
 Just not to the extend tat I (or whole guild) must stop wat they are doing <br/>
and rush to the player.  With guildsay, it&#39;s not very difficult to see who <br/>
is nearest and available to help ;)  The purpose of forming our own kakis <br/>
is to help as and when we can.  Unlike QHD so many faces I never seen b4, <br/>
if I can help, I help, if I&#39;m not free, I won&#39;t bother also.  But for own <br/>
kakis guild, I presume is small group of pple we know in RL or EQ, and have <br/>
trust with one another. Under this kinda situation, I&#39;m more willing to <br/>
extend my help.  If really no one online when a kakis SOS msg is send out, <br/>
I die die camp for 10 hrs liao will also rush to help.  That&#39;s all I have <br/>
to say - all depending on situation ;)  One good thing abt this lengthy <br/>
discussion is tat, by now I think all kakis know when to send a SOS msg <br/>
liao instead of abusing it ;)<br/>
