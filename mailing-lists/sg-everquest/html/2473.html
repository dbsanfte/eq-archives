ROGUE BOOTIES <br/>
Apparently the Rogue in Rathe Mountains who drops the Journeyman Boots referred to in Drelzna&#39;s note is around the Level 40 mark and is usually protected by two Level 35ish wizards. This should provide a little more experience and challenge to higher level players seeking to obtain this popular item.</div>
