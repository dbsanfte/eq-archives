<b>Subject:</b> RE: Najena Camp <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280126488">Hmm, I have a friend who get Jboot in just few hrs camping - just camp at <br/>
the least peak hr - S&#39;pore time 4pm to 8 pm.  This is the timing when Inno <br/>
server got least players.<br/>
<br/>
Now we have 3 lvl 30 kakis in SG guild - Garren, Leshrec and FF.  I shld be <br/>
able to lvl b4 weekend.  4 of us - Lvl 35 Pala, 2 lvl 30 Wiz and 1 Lvl 30 <br/>
Magi with pet, shld be abt to handle quite well.  I propose the 1st troop <br/>
Najena hunt after the SOO hunt, maybe the weekend after this, for FBR and <br/>
Jboot.  It may be a Fri 7pm to 3am hunt (details to be spelled out later). <br/>
 All those who are lvl 20 plus still got 1 week plus to lvl to 30 and join <br/>
us for the hunt ;) (Zan & NIca especially, hehe)<br/>
