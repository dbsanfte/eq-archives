<div id="ygrps-yiv-27847301">Will be away from Inno for the next 3 days, as I&#39;m camping for a full<br/>
set of Cryosilk for my enchanter in Cazic.<br/>
<br/>
Will still log in to Inno to check for Wylven presence though, want to<br/>
explain to him our reasons for quitting QHD.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, some things about fear plane, for those who are interested.<br/>
<br/>
1. Gate spell DON&#39;T WORK! Wizard GG work though<br/>
2. You should always have levitate on. There are Wraiths there that cast<br/>
Gravity Flux for 300dmg a pop, to your whole group if you are without<br/>
levitate<br/>
3. Nearly everything in the plane can fear, so boast your magic resist<br/>
up<br/>
4. Many things here can Harm Touch too, and their HT is unresistable,<br/>
unlike PC SK&#39;s HT.<br/>
5. It rains blood there.<br/>
6. There is only one zone barrier to get back, if you are not a Wiz, but<br/>
the barrier is guarded by CT.<br/>
7. CT is fucked up huge. Around 1 and the half the height of an SG, and<br/>
has several pets(all con yellow to me)<br/>
8. If possible, do not get hit. You&#39;ll get randomly teleported and might<br/>
go LD during this period (happen to 2 members of the 2nd group that was<br/>
in CT this morning)<br/>
9. Zone is VERY unstable. Was about to crash, but heng my group GG off.<br/>
Other group, as sway as they were before, got killed when the zone get<br/>
back by CT himself.<br/>
10. If GM not online, don&#39;t think of going to CT, you need them to get<br/>
your corpse after the zone crash, else, it&#39;s impossible to get your<br/>
corpse.</div>
