<div id="ygrps-yiv-297441251">I&#39;m not trained in dagger, and so far never get any weap from the other <br/>
guys.  I bought my own RTS at 20pp.  I think u can get woven at guk, but <br/>
I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s worth doing so.  The place is damn dangerous even for <br/>
lvl 20, and woven armor is only 1 ac more than cloth + magical armor.  I <br/>
dunno why it cost so much for that extra ac and dunno what can tat &#39;magic&#39; <br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone selling or know anyone selling FBR, pls let me know, looking for <br/>
it badly.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Well the total cost for my red Sash quest is  worth at least  100pp.<br/>
&gt;   The last i checked , i was mistaken on the items need for the current <br/>
 </span></blockquote>quest. The marnek Dagger will only be needed for the next higer quest which <br/>
includes the Skull of Jhen&#39;Tra from the gnoll embalmers and The Zaharns <br/>
Coronet from the High Priest Himself at permafrost, Zaharns would have <br/>
about 3 other lvl 31 with him. Sooo i dont think im doin that quest anytime <br/>
soon. like 15 lvl more to go ? :P<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ll loan the Dagger of Marnek to U till i hit lvl 35 Currently 20th <br/>
 </span></blockquote>only) or when i get another one , u can keep it. Look me up tonite and i&#39;ll <br/>
pass it on to u :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;         hiya guys,<br/>
&gt;         thanks again to u guys fer helping me out last nite for the small <br/>
 </span></blockquote>donation...  (i.e., Ziltus n Sereph)... i guess i took slightly more than <br/>
the 5-7pp range... more like 10pp... but i was starting to make money by <br/>
the 9th or 10th pp... so now i have a reasonable amount :) after brewing it <br/>
fer awhile... but can be pretty boring brewing.... ok... just a few quick <br/>
questions... how many of each stuff do u guys buy usuaully when u go on <br/>
brewing fer 1 round? i have like 40 of each materials (ie.., hops, malt, <br/>
etc)... and filled up all my backups (yes! i bought 5 backups)... n start <br/>
brewing... any better method? or faster method? also.. i said b4 i m gonna <br/>
return the money... although sereph u said i can keep em... if u still want <br/>
em... do let me know... i will return em to ya...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;         now... im thinking of picking up another trade skill... maybe <br/>
 </span></blockquote>tailoring... since i can make woven fer myself... can i? or cant? any <br/>
advice on that? or perhaps i will work abit on my levels b4 i start going <br/>
into something... as fer that dagger yiyang is selling... someone was <br/>
selling his fer 40pp only...<br/>
