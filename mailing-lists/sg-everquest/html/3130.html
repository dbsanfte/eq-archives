<b>Subject:</b> How many still facing screen freezing problem in EQ? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209315018">I tried to use 2 PCs (2 diff accts) under same scv modem connection, and <br/>
after few occurrences, confirmed only my main PC (which is a more powerful <br/>
system with much faster video card & better sound card) has this problem.<br/>
<br/>
Usually when the main PC freeze, my 2nd PC char is still running well and <br/>
can see the main PC char turn to LD (he will disappear for like 3-5 sec and <br/>
then reappear with a LD sign on top of him).<br/>
<br/>
Merns managed to get his Silvermoon LAN shop friends to solve this problem <br/>
for him but he also dunno how they did it (ask him also no reply, argh). <br/>
 Anyway, anyone managed to find any soln so far?  Just to list down my PC <br/>
config if it helps:<br/>
<br/>
AMD K7-700 (no overclock)<br/>
Asus K7V m/b<br/>
128MB PC133 ram<br/>
Guillemot 3D Prophet GeForce Pro DDR-DVI<br/>
SB Live Digital<br/>
Maxtor 40.9GB HDD<br/>
Asus 50X Cdrom drive<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried directx 7.0, 7.0a, 8.0 and update my video & sound cards with <br/>
the latest drivers (I also flash my video card with the latest bios) but I <br/>
still get the screen freeze bug (average once a day, with max 4-5 times a <br/>
day).  I also reformat my HDD 3 times, reinstall Win98SE, EQ + all its <br/>
expansiona and patches, doesn&#39;t help also ;(<br/>
<br/>
I wonder anyone other than Merns managed to solve this problem can <br/>
enlighten me?  Playing EQ with a possible screen freeze anytime is like <br/>
playing with a bomb dunno when it will explode.  And everytime the screen <br/>
freeze, must reboot PC, go thru&#39; scandisk (40GB HDD...) and sometime also <br/>
have to wait few min for EQ to synchronize char, which means my char <br/>
already death with my corpse dunno end up where!!! ARGH!<br/>
<br/>
Pls help!  THX!!!</div>
