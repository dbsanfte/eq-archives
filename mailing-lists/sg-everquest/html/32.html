<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279039739">Hope Gary would add some of his opinions to my brief ones.<br/>
  <br/>
1)Inventory is a pain in the ass with little space and time-consuming<br/>
movement period compared to UO.<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Aye, Real Pain. But there are short cuts I think. The one that I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>accdentially found is that when picking up stuff from ur body, by rite<br/>
clicking on the item, it will pop into ur item slots instead of having to<br/>
left click on it and drag it to the item slots. But this of course wouldn&#39;t<br/>
auto equipe ur armors/weapons. U still need to click and drop it into ur<br/>
char. Still exploring the game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2)First person view is the main view but able to switch to ass-cam &lt;tomb<br/>
raider&gt; for the more professional players&#39; choice. There are a total of 5<br/>
different views if I&#39;m right.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; As for the view, I usually use the first person view (al Quake). I don&#39;t<br/>
 </span></blockquote>play Quake though. I would get motion sickness in 5mins. Anyway, I do use<br/>
the other view type, the top down view. There are bonus to hit and damage<br/>
if u attack from behind (at least that&#39;s what I heard from a player. And I<br/>
do find that I hit more often and damage higher sometimes).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
3)Hunting in groups are encouraged due to trains and tough mobs with<br/>
splendid loots.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; For EQ it&#39;s group or die. Within a group, u need some1 to heal and cure,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>some1 to provide firepower support and tanks to take hits from the<br/>
monsters. It&#39;s all about co-operating to survive and gain from the hunts. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
4)Minotour Axes are like the best non-magic weapon in the game. Price range<br/>
from 5pp-10pp.<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; No idea on this one. I&#39;m a Monk. I&#39;m my weapon and armor itself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>5)If you love interaction, then this is the game. Meridian 59 is also<br/>
recommended.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Aye, player interaction is really important in the game<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>6)One hour in real life is like 1 whole day in EverQuest &lt;morning til night&gt;<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Yeah, and I hate that. You can hardly see at nite if u&#39;re human or don&#39;t<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have any lightsource with u.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
7)Face choices variety needs a HUGE update.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Well, generating 3ds are quite space and memory consuming...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>8)Almost bug-free....now now, lets not talk about UO. &lt;grins&gt;<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; heheh<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>9)Marcoing is still present but MUCH MUCH SO MUCH MUCH SO MUCH more less<br/>
effective.<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Aye, actually what marcoing?? That game u bascially use hotkeys to play<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the game. And better brush up on the typing skills. U&#39;ll want to type very<br/>
fast in certain situation. Heheh.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
10)Mules are like useless.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Aye, u need to level up if u want to have trade skills eg smithing &#39;cos<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there&#39;s skill points limit u can attain for a lvl.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
11)If your Lawyer or your Boss is drowning, would you choose going to the<br/>
movies or to StarBucks? &lt;drafted&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; If Starwars in being screen then, it&#39;s Starwars!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cheers,<br/>
Wilson<br/>
