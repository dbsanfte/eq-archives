<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182430897">Noticed that the higher lvl guys always visit highpass nowadays.  May I <br/>
know where is it?  What monsters (lvl?), loots can be found there?  Thx.<br/>
<br/>
Until now, I still dun get it why armor like woven cost so much higher than <br/>
clothes if woven is just 1 AC more than clothe items?  No doubt they r <br/>
magical, but does the &#39;magical&#39; feature give extra protection other than <br/>
the 1 AC more?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m now looking for a nice pair of earrings, preferably something that can <br/>
boost my INT or AGI by at least 2.  Any advice?  Pricing?<br/>
