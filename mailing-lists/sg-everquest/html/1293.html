<div id="ygrps-yiv-54248539">After a weekend of travelling and trading, I now feel confident <br/>
enough to present you this guide on Pottery.<br/>
<br/>
Learning Pottery Fast, by Kellendil, Master Brewer, Master Potter, <br/>
Always-broke Jeweller. (WIS 95, INT 127, CHR 98)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The nice thing about pottery is that it&#39;s quite cheap to train up, <br/>
almost as cheap as Brewing.<br/>
<br/>
As a start, with abosloutely no skill at all, I started making Medium <br/>
Jars. The raw materials for this item are:<br/>
<br/>
Block of Clay (43)<br/>
Medium Jar Sketch (11)<br/>
Flask of Water (11)<br/>
<br/>
for a grand total of 65 coppers. These are combined on a Pottery <br/>
Wheel, and a successful skill roll will produce an Unfired Medium <br/>
Jar. This must be placed in a Kiln together with a Quality Firing <br/>
Sheet (22) to produce the final product, which I managed to sell for <br/>
93 coppers. At this stage, your skill should be rising very fast. I got <br/>
a skill rise on every attempt, whether pass or not, and every time I <br/>
fired the item in the kiln with the firing sheet.<br/>
<br/>
This should be good until your skill goes over 40, at which point <br/>
you stop making Clay Jars and get on to Pie Tins. These require:<br/>
<br/>
2 Blocks of Clay (86)<br/>
Pie Tin Sketch (11)<br/>
Flask of Water (11)<br/>
<br/>
which is a total of 108 coppers in raw materials. Combine these <br/>
successfully on the Pottery Wheel, then combine in the Kiln <br/>
together with a High Quality Firing Sheet (43). Making these is <br/>
what you will be doing to earn money as well, for they sell at the <br/>
vendors for 652 copper. Since each Pie Tin&#39;s raw materials plus <br/>
firing sheet cost only 151 copper, this is a significant profit.<br/>
<br/>
Now making Pie Tins will bring your skill to around 115 points, at <br/>
which point they become trivial. However, just like Jewelcraft, even <br/>
when an item becomes trivial, the failure rate for that item can still <br/>
be quite high. I noticed that my Pie Tin failure rate was still about 3 <br/>
to 4 out of 10.<br/>
<br/>
In order to increase my skill to 127, at which the failure rate <br/>
became about 1 in 10, I made Large Bowls from the following:<br/>
<br/>
Large Block of Clay (107)<br/>
Glass Shards (86)<br/>
Large Bowl Sketch (11)<br/>
Flask of Water (11)<br/>
<br/>
which came up to a total of 215 coppers per attempt. Again, after <br/>
combining on the pottery wheel, firing in the Kiln with a High <br/>
Quality Firing Sheet (43) was necessary, and each large bowl sold <br/>
for 280 coppers; obviously an inferior profit margin. It took me only <br/>
34 or so attempts to raise my skill from 115 to 127, out of which I <br/>
estimate half were successes. This means I spent only about 3 <br/>
plats to raise 12 points from 115.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So to recap,<br/>
<br/>
STAGE ONE: Skill 0 to 35 or 40:<br/>
<br/>
Medium Jar (Block of Clay, Medium Jar Sketch, Flask of Water <br/>
and Quality Firing Sheet) 87 coppers each, sold for 93<br/>
<br/>
STAGE TWO (money making stage): Skill 35+ to 115:<br/>
<br/>
Pie Tin (2 Blocks of Clay, Pie Tin Sketch, Flask of Water and High <br/>
Quality Firing Sheet) 151 coppers each, sell them for 652 coppers <br/>
each.<br/>
<br/>
OPTIONAL STAGE: Skill 115 to 127++<br/>
<br/>
Large Bowl (Large Block of Clay, Glass Shards, Large Bowl <br/>
Sketch Flask of Water and High Quality Firing Sheet) 258 coppers <br/>
each, sold for 280 coppers.<br/>
