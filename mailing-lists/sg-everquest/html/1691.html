&gt; Hi All,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just joined this after hearing from Kalandra of Innoruuk about this place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Currently I appear on Innoruuk as Yuffie the Cleric or Melodeuss the Bard. Or Ungaroth the TSK on Cazic Thule if anybody plays there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Give me a tell if you are looking for a party or questing, goodluck and Gud Bashing!<br/>

&gt; P.S Currently having problems trying to subscribe and suffering from withdrawal symptoms :(<br/>
