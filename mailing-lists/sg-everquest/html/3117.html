1)Why is that search engine called &quot;Lycos&quot;?<br/>
Answer: It&#39;s named after spiders.<br/>
<br/>
I called the company and asked their public<br/>
relations department about the unusual name.<br/>
As they explained to me, Lycos is short for<br/>
&quot;Lycosidae,&quot; the name of a family of fast-running<br/>
spiders.<br/>
<br/>
A spider, for those of you who aren&#39;t familiar<br/>
with Internet lingo, is a program used by search<br/>
engines to index Web sites.<br/>
<br/>
2)How do contractors get tall buildings to be perfectly <br/>
vertical? <br/>
<br/>
In no other profession is it more important to be upright.  <br/>
You don&#39;t want your builder to have a crooked slant on <br/>
things. But how -- other than threatening to send it to jail <br/>
-- do architects and contractors get a tall building to go <br/>
straight?<br/>
<br/>
Shhh. Can you keep a secret? Tall buildings aren&#39;t perfectly <br/>
vertical! They don&#39;t have to be. Flexibility is built into <br/>
their construction -- valuable in itself on a windy day or in <br/>
an earthquake zone.  <br/>
<br/>
When it comes to the straight up-and-down of it, close is <br/>
good enough. They achieve that by putting cables on the <br/>
supporting vertical columns when they start to build <br/>
the first two floors.  Surveying equipment -- plumb and <br/>
transit -- indicates if those columns are going straight up.  <br/>
If they&#39;re off, the cables are tightened to adjust the <br/>
vertical columns so they&#39;re perpendicular before the <br/>
horizontal beams are bolted to them.<br/>
