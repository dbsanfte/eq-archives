&gt; page for Everquest and since Singularity is currently going through a<br/>
&gt; major revamp along with the special page mentioned,it will not be up<br/>
&gt; too soon.However,this is how the page will work. The page could be<br/>
&gt; updated by anyone through an online form which will directly added to<br/>
&gt; the news section.This is a page specially dedicated to the Singaporean<br/>
&gt; Everquest Community so I HOPE no spamming or unrelated stuff to be<br/>
&gt; posted. All in all,I hope the Singaporean Community sprit will be<br/>
&gt; bolstered by this page.Thanks and show all your support by posting all<br/>
&gt; the juicy stuff you all want to let all the local players know.Since<br/>
