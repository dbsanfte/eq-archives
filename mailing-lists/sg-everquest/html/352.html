<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141861488">LOL, me already there with a gnomish necromancer too, let make an evil dark <br/>
twins, hehe.  So coincident, we always select the same race and class, <br/>
great minds think alike?  LOL.  I guess I better change char liao this time <br/>
(thou I always fancy the Life Tap spells of necro), so that we can pair up <br/>
to hunt.  How abt a TSK?  More evil than u leh.  Hehe, since u wanna play <br/>
evil, play dark-evil necro lor, ;)  We can meet and tag team (tank and <br/>
caster) to destroy all light in Prexus server!<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the XP thing, not sure if new EQ server gain xp faster, but it&#39;s <br/>
very true for UO new server.  In mature server it takes months to make a GM <br/>
smith but in new server it only take a week or two. I guess it&#39;s not a bad <br/>
time for us to try it out, esp our chars are all pretty young in Innoruuk. <br/>
 No harm trying too, say spend few days to a week there.  Maybe we all gain <br/>
much higher lvl in new server as compare to few weeks play in Innoruuk ;)<br/>
<br/>
I think DE Necro and TSK will make a great EVIL team.  One more shaman <br/>
(healer/buffer)  will be nice for a evil party, whahahahahahah!<br/>
<br/>
Btw Les, Gandalf is more for good char.  Not so suitable for evil char leh. <br/>

Being a new server, less people would probably be there, and thus the <br/>
initial xp gain should be speedy enough. Anyone who is willing to switch <br/>
servers for a while to try out the class they always wanted, but not able <br/>
to bear to leave their main characters can always join me. )<br/>
