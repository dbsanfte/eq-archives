&gt; Subject: [sg-everquest] EQ Problem after 27/3/01 patch<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2 day b4 the patch I encounter one funny problem.  After porting someone<br/>
&gt; from Sebilis to DL, I find my char stucked in DL wiz spire.  Stucked in the<br/>
&gt; sense that out of the 3 latency figures on my screen, the leftmost figure<br/>
&gt; raise to 59,000!  I cannot cast spell, cannot camp, cannot hail etc.  In<br/>
&gt; the end I login my friend char using my 2nd PC and look for guide to help<br/>
&gt; me by porting me out out DL.  Guide came and port me to GF, where my<br/>
&gt; connection goes back to normal.  Guide advise me to delete the DL zone<br/>
&gt; files and repatch them, which I did.  But after repatch we do a test again<br/>
&gt; by gating to DL, same prob occurred ;(  In the end guide port me back to GF<br/>
&gt; and ask me not to port to DL atm until I get technical support.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yesterday after patch, I was asked to re-select my primary display card<br/>
&gt; (did all of you get the same thing?).  I only got 1 Hercules GeForce Pro<br/>
&gt; DDR DVI, so only 1 choice.  After tat I login my char in Qeynos Hill, blah,<br/>
&gt; same latency problem stucked again.  I guess maybe QH files was screwed.<br/>
&gt;  So I login another char in GF, no problem.  But the moment I gate to TT<br/>
&gt; sebilis orb, dang, the same problem comes again, with the leftmost latency<br/>
&gt; figure raise to 50,000++.  I cannot zone into Seb, cannot talk (actually I<br/>
&gt; can but those surrounding me can&#39;t hear, same for /gu, I can /gu but my<br/>
&gt; guildmates dun hear me).  I do a /q and try agin, same problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the end I backup all the opt files and eqclient.ini, un-install my<br/>
&gt; EQ+SoV, re-install and re-patch all.  This time round I got a new problem.<br/>
&gt; ;(  At the main menu, after I key in my ID and PW, and click the CONNECT<br/>
&gt; button, nothing happened for a min or so, then this error msg pops up:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Error 1001: Could not connect to the EverQuest server!  Please try again<br/>
&gt; shortly!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I tried and tried for an hour plus, still got same error msg.  I try to use<br/>
&gt; my friend&#39;s EQ acct to login, same problem.  I try to use my 2nd PC to<br/>
&gt; login (with latest patch but didn&#39;t uninstall/reinstall EQ) both accts,<br/>
&gt; same problem.  I try all above after disable my firewall and norton<br/>
&gt; anti-virus proetction, same problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I check EQ technical support forum, and found alot of pple also got the<br/>
&gt; same problem after the latest patch.  Some pple say it&#39;s my ISP (which is<br/>
&gt; SCV cable modem), but Leshrec is using the same cable modem yet he dun have<br/>
&gt; this prob.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Trifrost do u have this problem?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I try again this morning b4 I go to work, still the same error msg.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone can help?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thx.<br/>
