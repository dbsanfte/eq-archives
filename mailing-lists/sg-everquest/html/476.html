<br/>
  We really need more support classes.5 tanks(and strangely enough, most are paladins) out of 9 people is not a balance group and Leshrac is playing the only evil character in the whole group. <br/>
  If more tanks are created, I might change class to a druid or shaman <br/>
<br/>
  Also, someone mind playing an evil character to support Leshrac? <br/>
<br/>
  Again, I ask you people to state the time/how frequent you play. In addition, mind tellling me which trade skills you are persuding? <br/>
<br/>
  The reason I asked about trade skills is to reduce the amount of money the whole group needs to spend in the long term before we can get useful stuff like armor from the skills. <br/>
<br/>
