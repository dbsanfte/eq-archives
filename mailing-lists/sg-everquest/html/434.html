<div id="ygrps-yiv-122407006">Same here, I love to read guide books -got around 50 of them at home, hehe.<br/>
Me also buy them for collection.  Problem is, out of all the guild books I <br/>
bought so far, I only play less them 20% of them, and not even 5% for those <br/>
that I play for more than a month.<br/>
<br/>
Getting UO is actually a good saving in the long run - it allow me to <br/>
concentrate on one game and spend less money on others, thou I have to pay <br/>
monthly fee.  As a whole, I think I spend much lesser.  Now I&#39;m going to <br/>
close my 2nd UO acct to divert the money to EQ acct - otherwise very jiat <br/>
luck - economy is bad, time is bad, heh.<br/>

&gt; Haha, I understand. Both UO Guide Books were &quot;useless&quot; but I did buy them<br/>
&gt; too. Ok, I bought them for collection...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Not worth buying. Your baby sister can type that guide out for you.<br/>
