<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112431230">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
Well, The Order of Manticore is not bad. Clan Red Lions is not bad. Well, I know you people want recognition for Singapore but seriously. The guild name doesn&#39;t sound appealing hehehe!<br/>
<br/>
I am on Enteri&#39;s side, on choosing Fantasy titles. They sound nicer, well at least to me, and they also fit into the game better.<br/>
<br/>
And lastly, like one of you mentioned and I&#39;m sure all of you agree. THAT THIS guild is also open to foreigners. So why make those French, Americans join &quot;Lee Kwan Yew&quot;? They would surely feel better with xxx&lt;Ridgerunners&gt; or xxx&lt;ClintonRules&gt; instead of xxx&lt;SiBeiKiasu&gt;. I believe you people get my point.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents,<br/>

&lt;&lt;Still waiting for Yiyang to arrive&gt;&gt;</div>
