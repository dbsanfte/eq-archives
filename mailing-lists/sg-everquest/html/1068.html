*ATTENTION* *IMPORTANT* *PLEASE READ* <br/>
We have temporarily changed the rules on the test server in order to test our new PvP - Teams code. This test will last approximately one week. If you choose to play during this time, please understand that it will be under PvP - Teams rules and that you are subject to being player killed. If you are not confortable with this, we suggest playing on our live servers until we return to the test server to regular rules. <br/>
<br/>
In addition to testing the PvP Teams code, we will also be testing the balance of the initial teams, the allowable PK level spread, etc. Please keep in mind that any or all of these rules are subject to change at any time. <br/>
<br/>
The teams are as follows: <br/>
<br/>
Team 1<br/>
High Elf <br/>
Wood Elf<br/>
Half-Elf <br/>
<br/>
Team 2<br/>
Dwarf<br/>
Gnome<br/>
Halfling<br/>
Team 3<br/>
Human<br/>
Barbarian<br/>
Erudite <br/>
<br/>
Team 4<br/>
Ogre<br/>
Troll<br/>
Dark Elf <br/>
<br/>
This means that any member of one team may be PK&#39;d by a member of any of the other 3 teams, but not my a member of their own team. <br/>
<br/>
We have increased the level limits for PvP to +/-8 levels as opposed to the +/-4 that exists in Rallos Zek (normal PvP server). <br/>
<br/>
------------- <br/>
<br/>
Here is a short list of some other changes: <br/>
<br/>
PvP Faction Hits have been removed until we can implement an aggressor flag (IF we decide to). <br/>
<br/>
If a character is killed by someone with his or her PK flag ON (+pvp), they will return from death with Zero Mana. This is to address the &#39;naked mage syndrome&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
Warriors have been upgraded with more Hit Points, better innate magical resistance, and a chance to critical hit above and beyond normal critical hits in combat. <br/>
<br/>
Pets can no longer open locked doors. <br/>
