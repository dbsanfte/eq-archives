        personally i think thats not a bad idea... and i will only move if majority does... and i think its quite hard as the previous time u guys try to switch... n wasnt very successful... anyway... do let me know what everyone decides... will be fun if all could shift though...<br/>

            <br/>
            Hi guys,<br/>
            I propose that we all move to Tallon Zek[PvP Teams].Okay here are my SUGGESTIONS on why we MIGHT wanna move there.However if there isnt much support,I will stay in Innoruuk with u guys.All critisims are welcomed!<br/>
             <br/>
            1.Guild:Okay,lets face it,for normal servers,Guild aint of much fan except of a tag there.I foresee that if a guild is set up in Tallon Zek,it would be much more meaningfull in the sense that when everyone has a common goal and at the same time roleplaying WHAT it should be[huh?A paladin and SK chatting with each other?].Serious roleplaying could be carried to the fullest and the tension when going over zones which WILL encourage grouping<br/>
             <br/>
            2.New Server.Since its new,it would be nice that there will be players around to group.<br/>
             <br/>
            3.MAIN POINT:The tension!This time,you would be much more carefull going through zones and when buddies come the fullest and where racism too :).Although all the Singaporean EQ Players would be best if same group,however we could have some not in this group so they could set up their own guild and wage war with us which WILL defintely improve the SG EQ community.If we could not be friends,we could be still foes :)<br/>
             <br/>
            4.ok..high level players..ahem Garren...There seems to be a quest to switch servers though I do not encourage this coz it would be more fun if everyone same level.<br/>
             <br/>
            5.SG Mauling:heh..Imagine all 35SG players on this list play same group and have a FULLSCALE invasion on Freeport?hehe...imagine the fun..<br/>
             <br/>
            6.The spirit bond BTW on SG players will defintely tighten with this..:)<br/>
             <br/>
            7.Makes higher lv SGs get good items for their lower SG counterparts so our SG strength could be increased.[Note:Coz 300levels4s could maul a level50?]<br/>
            <br/>
            8.We could have serious planning on what class to use so we would not be as messy as now...<br/>
             <br/>
            9.We had PROBABLY wrongly configured our chr in the past so it would be a nice change<br/>
            <br/>
            10.SGs players are now split into 2..mainly the highlevels and low levels..It would be nice if this everyone would be same level again<br/>
             <br/>
            Thx for reading...just my 2cents<br/>
