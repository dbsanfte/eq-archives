<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870898080">My specialty is going to ulu places, sure got lots of places to hunt (and die)<br/>
<br/>
15+ can go try Permafrost. Very good loot, but got a lot of ice giant running<br/>
around and not to mention Vox.......<br/>
<br/>
Another good place is Kerra Isle, but the loot there like shit. Full group of<br/>
around level 10 can hunt the high guards while 15+ can hunt necros<br/>
<br/>
Another place for the whole gang to hunt is at the Ocean of Tears. The Aqua<br/>
Goblin island has mobs ranging from level 14-22<br/>
<br/>
The 10-15 group can visit Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron while the 17++ one can go Unrest<br/>
there. This 2 are not so ulu and can be quite full.<br/>
<br/>
Rathe Mountains also not bad for exp, can handle people from level 1 to 50. But<br/>
there&#39;s 2 fucked up sphinx  there + hill giants, cyclops and griffons flying<br/>
around. Very risky.<br/>
<br/>
Beholder maze has good loot, but the XP is not good enough IMO.<br/>
<br/>
About Split Paw, the xp there quite good, and can get RTS from the NPC Necro in<br/>
there + Snakeskin armor and all sort of useful things. Train prone.<br/>
<br/>
Najena, a tad dangerous. 15-20 can hunt around the first few rooms, going<br/>
deeper is hard unless you can find a cleric or necro due to the necros and<br/>
their pets past this point. Good loot, good XP, but very train prone.<br/>
