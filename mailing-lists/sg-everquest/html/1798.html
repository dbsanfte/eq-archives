&gt; Though I&#39;m not a SG but I supposed I&#39;m welcome to join? ;)  Anyway, here goes my 2<br/>
&gt; cent :<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will join the new guild with my new char Soraman who currently stuck in Halas for his<br/>
&gt; new life --&gt; Brothers of Trifrost<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a pretty funny idea(to me), can we have the same surname within the guild?<br/>
&gt; Of course, in that case u have to be lvl 19- to join the guild.  However, I really think it is<br/>
&gt; a good idea.. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for the recruiting procedure, I think there should be at least 3 to 5 ppl in the guild<br/>
&gt; who say yes to get a new one join.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well... I dun care who is incharge.  The person should devote some of his/her time to<br/>
&gt; organize killing/auction event.  QHD is too inactive.  Sigh.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For the website, I have a personal website(around 20M) from my ISP that is<br/>
&gt; untouched.  If u want, I can offer it to u BUT i&#39;m not good at website design.<br/>

&gt; &gt;General opinion of our SG kakis, whose names shall be hidden, states<br/>
&gt; &gt;that we, want a SG kaki guild, by next week.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Why? Shouldn&#39;t QHD be enough? Could be the question you are going to<br/>
&gt; &gt;throw at me later, and I&#39;ll answer them AGAIN.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;QHD has several lamers these days, and on top of that, it&#39;s hyper<br/>
&gt; &gt;inactive in activities. When was the last time, the guild got together<br/>
&gt; &gt;to do something? It acts more like a glorified shout channel. Also, when<br/>
&gt; &gt;we are planning kakis only activities and have to resort to guildsay to<br/>
&gt; &gt;communicate, random goons might join in, and ruin the experience for us.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;As a result, I propose that we get this thing together and prepare for<br/>
&gt; &gt;the guild formation by Wednesday.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Basically, what I want you to do is answer this question:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Quit QHD and form a local kaki guild, yay or nay?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Then these question if you say yay:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Who should be the goondu in charge?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Who should be the officals for recruiting?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The charter, who is willing to type it?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Website, for the thousand time, anyone can get one ASAP?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Recruting guidlines, think, and give me your opinion.<br/>
