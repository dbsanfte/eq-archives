<br/>
EQ is a group game. when u get to group with assholes, its spolits the day.<br/>
<br/>
On the long run, we need to built parthership and play with ppl we know.<br/>
That could be diff somtimes when:<br/>
1) ppl u know and play with doent log-in at the same time as u do.They r<br/>
leaving when u just log in, or vice-vesa.<br/>
2) Level differences.<br/>
3) Location diff. Freeport, Qeynos etc.some of us r more comfortable playing<br/>
at our starting location than to emigate to a diff city. or at lower lvl, we<br/>
do not have the confident to venture out just yet.<br/>
<br/>
I hope the numbers of Singapore EQ player pool grows. It will be good for<br/>
all<br/>
singapore players. Most nite im on, i saw lotsa Japanese players grouping<br/>
together in<br/>
Freeport. I dont get invit or they wont join u becos they convers in Jap.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m kinda stucked at lvl 8 with no reliable kakis to team with.  Team with<br/>
&gt;a lvl 6 ranger, lvl 6 cleric and a lvl 7 bard last night in CB (crashbone<br/>
&gt;lair lah, not chxx bxx).  B4 the fight tat cleric so ya ya (he is so<br/>
&gt;confident that he make his char a pk char when he started off).  Keep<br/>
&gt;telling me he is very solid, can fight, can heal and cast spell.  The bard<br/>
&gt;also ya ya, say she always solo at CB entrance (but she really got a kick<br/>
&gt;ass axe from divnn).  In the end when we crashed with a train of 5 orc cen,<br/>
&gt;bard disband and flee herself.  Cleric kena killed very fast (too confident<br/>
&gt;that he charge whenever he see orc, even I keep asking him to let the rest<br/>
&gt;heal/med 1st).  In the end he is the 1st one who kena killed and restart<br/>
&gt;back in Felwithe.  After he run to CB entrance, got killed by orc again b4<br/>
&gt;he finish looting his corpse, and this thing happened ard 3~4, sigh.  The<br/>
&gt;ranger is quite ok, he always try to help, but I guess he is not familar<br/>
&gt;with the area and dunno how to use zone to stay alive when the opponents<br/>
&gt;are too strong, in the end he also died 3 times.  I myself left solo alone<br/>
&gt;and earn xp for them, by using travelling across zone to keep myself alive.<br/>
&gt; After 1.5 hrs of hunting, I also quite sian and logout liao.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Didnt get to meet Les last night, so dunno how to go freeport.  Anyone play<br/>
&gt;in GFaydark wanna team with me?<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;d be doing 2 homepages in the June holidays. One is for my EQ<br/>
&gt;Screenshots.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Tavis&#39; and Taka&#39;s EQ Journeys&gt;&gt; I sure would want the group shot too!<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;smiles&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Good choice Gary. Best to have a great long run character then being<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; stubborn ;-) However, I always learn my lessons too late.<br/>
