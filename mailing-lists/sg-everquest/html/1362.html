<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078952020">I used to think Paw is the only place with RTS but it&#39;s not true.<br/>
<br/>
The camp at Lake Rathetear entrance zone from South Karana spawn both RTS <br/>
and JK skull.  Camp at Lake Rathetear for 1 hr will get at least 1 of each <br/>
- the gnoll high shaman is below lvl 20.  If u r lvl 20, better nuke it <br/>
fast or the nearby shamans will heal him up.  Alternatively casters can <br/>
form a RTS/JKS expedition group to Lake Rothetear, I&#39;m sure it will be a <br/>
very fruitful trip for casters.   The camp spawns gnolls during the day and <br/>
undead during the night (watch out for dry bone, they r tougher than <br/>
birdman).<br/>
<br/>
Note that JKS is a lore item, ie u can only carry one at one time (whether <br/>
on u or in bank).  RTS is pending lore, u can get extra cash by selling <br/>
them off at lvl 10-30pp, before they make it a lore item (RTS sell better <br/>
at GF area, just like lighstone is highly demanded in FP).  My Jap friend <br/>
camp for 2 hrs or so and find 4 RTS and 3 JKS - and he is damn pissed when <br/>
he cannot pick up the JKS which I think can sometime sell at 30pp ;)<br/>
<br/>
At lvl 21 I can solo a high shaman but my lvl 21 magi died 2 times trying <br/>
to solo becoz he cannot kill the mob b4 the other gnolls shamans (at least <br/>
2-3 ard) heal it.  The rest of the gnolls are normally green to u and wont <br/>
join in the fight, but they will still heal.  Once ya HP drop to 2.5 bubb, <br/>
u better run to zone, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
The birdman guards give EXCELLENT xp to lvl 20-23 casters.  I highly <br/>
recommend the place for those lvl 18-23 tanks and lvl 20-23 casters.  The <br/>
only problem is tat the place is kinda wulu wulu (only 1 npc merchant <br/>
island), and u have to swim ALOT.  Put it in another way, this is the best <br/>
place to train swiming (now all my friends who hunt there max out their <br/>
swiming to lvl ceiling).  If possible, invis yaself when swiming, coz there <br/>
is a lvl 53 sea monster in the lake.  If u suay suay see it, u can buy 4D <br/>
liao.  For those below lvl 20, aqua gob and lizardman will attack u if they <br/>
see u.  If ya swiming skill is low, u will be very jia lat.  I have a lvl <br/>
24 rogue friend who suay suay met a lizardman in sea, and becoz his swiming <br/>
is very low, he almosted get killed!  Since 80% of the zone is filled with <br/>
water, I will wish u all the best finding ya corpse if u died in lake ;)<br/>
<br/>
Btw, birdman hit VERY hard - up to 40 per hit, and they stun u.  There is <br/>
no way for a lvl 24 casters to take 2 at a time, so having trust-worthy <br/>
buddies is very impt.  The most common place is the 3-birds tower at the <br/>
center island. The birdman, no matter how many hundreds time u killed them, <br/>
is forever non-agro (for me and my friends so far).  Just be careful not to <br/>
drop into lake when u are fighting one.  I ever fall to lake when a birdy <br/>
on me, and it follow me into the lake, where all my group members are all <br/>
above the tower.  The bird hit so hard that I die shortly after dropping <br/>
into the lake.  So beware.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, birdies only give coins up to 2pp (very seldom), bronze weap and rusty <br/>
weap. The nearest bank is HH bank (at least 3 zones away?) and the nearest <br/>
binding area is arena (1 zone).  For casters who can teleport to North <br/>
Karana, teleport there, run south-wards to the south brigde and zone into <br/>
South Karana.  Once u enter SK, run all the way South to Lake zone <br/>
entrance.  SK got pretty tough animal like mammoths (NEVER attack a young <br/>
mammoth when an adult is nearby), bull elephants, centaur etc.  Dun ask me <br/>
their lvl coz I never attack them ;)  I just know at lvl 22 the centaur <br/>
(horse man) are still blue to me.  Leshrec say with 4 legs they run very <br/>
slow since they have problem coordinating their movement, but I leave it to <br/>
u to believe him, hehehe.  Good luck.<br/>
