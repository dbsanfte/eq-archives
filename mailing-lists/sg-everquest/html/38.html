<div id="ygrps-yiv-719859361">Nope, never heard of them, maybe Magnus (few of them in Baja).  Which shard <br/>
u play?<br/>
<br/>
Actually Asia has approached us for alliance b4, but problem is the guild <br/>
expands so fast that many noto hunters/pkers are also inside Asia now (some <br/>
of them even fight with us before when they noto hunt).  It make us very <br/>
uncomfortable allied with them, esp they asked for war-declared allies (ie <br/>
both side declare war, not for the sake of fighting but more for helping <br/>
one another when in need).  When we talked abt allies, we refer to those <br/>
long-term trust-worthy ones, like our more than a yr ally - TAA.  As <br/>
allies, we share lots of our resources with them, eg providing free vendor <br/>
shop for them, invitation them for most guild activities etc.<br/>
<br/>
Problem in UO is land is so scare that there is NO WAY to put anything <br/>
bigger than a small house.  On the other hand, there r so many stuffs to <br/>
store in UO, haha.  I really look forward to see how EQ manage inventory. <br/>
 Any exisitng EQ players can share your experience?  How many items can u <br/>
carry in UO, how u keep &#39;stock&#39;, how to transfer stuffs amg chars of same <br/>
acct etc? ;)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, is Innoruuk the one Gary mentioned w/o any lag?  Maybe we shld set up a <br/>
Local EQ msg board  for all local players to get togather discussing the <br/>
game.  I dun mind setting up one as my UO site already shifted to <br/>
Singularity ;)  Maybe 1st thing we need to discuss which server is the best <br/>
and has more locals, then new comers at least know which way they shld go <br/>
;)<br/>

&gt; Kudos to you. You must be good at handling people. If you come over to<br/>
&gt; Innoruuk where Gary, YinYang and I are, might stick around with you<br/>
&gt; &lt;smiles&gt;. Regarding the info about the game, I&#39;d do another post.<br/>

&gt; Good to know your guild are Antis, paradox/ironic to the Guild Name. I&#39;ve<br/>

&gt; &gt; If you play around Baja server down time, often you will see a horde of<br/>
&gt; &gt; black horsemen in Cov entrance, Britain X-road or Britain cemetry, esp<br/>
&gt; Cov,<br/>
