<b>Subject:</b> Guild Stealer - Voyesbian <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538751274">Just to inform all kakis that we have a stealer from the guild, who even <br/>
steal from own guild mates.<br/>
<br/>
For those who went for the guild bash in Befallen last week, some may <br/>
remember a lvl 9 DE wiz who went to lvl 3 of Bafallen at lvl 9.  Of coz, he <br/>
kena killed many times and Garren, Wylven and I were the last 3 who stayed <br/>
with him to get most of his corpses.  At the end he still claimed he lost <br/>
few pp, dvinn dagger etc which Wylven and Garren were kind enough to pass <br/>
some of their loot to him.  So that was my 1st encounter with this DE wiz <br/>
name Voyesbian.<br/>
<br/>
Over the weekend, he was hunting at HH solo, and attacked some of our <br/>
preys.  But he is too weak to steal from our group of lvl 18-20, and he <br/>
mentioned he just wanna hit once to gain faction.  We have no objection <br/>
over this and we also try not to attack his prey.  He gain from lvl 9 to <br/>
lvl 13 within the weekend, which is pretty fast.<br/>
<br/>
H/w, last night while hunting at HH, I noticed he started to steal from our <br/>
group.  He no longer nuke once or twice but nuke full force to get the <br/>
kill.  FYI he is WAITING for the tanks in the group to hurt mob b4 he start <br/>
to nuke.  I ask him why is he doing such thing to his own guildmate and he <br/>
said he just need 1-3 more kills b4 he log.  The true fact is tat he is <br/>
actually stay longer than that.  He is stealing at HH, and he steal from <br/>
from another groups as well.  He steal so ofen that one players from the <br/>
other guild, Lionessa, started to make noise.<br/>
<br/>
I started to observe how this Voy hunt and at one time I was even accused <br/>
by Lionessa for stealing her kill, while it&#39;s actually Voy who did it (I&#39;m <br/>
just watching with OOM!).  I&#39;m kinda pissed to get such accuse.  Shortly <br/>
Lionessa page for a GM, and Voy log immediatelywhen GM Glim arrvived <br/>
(guilty I guess).<br/>
<br/>
When GM Glim arrive, I explained to him, and he understand the situation <br/>
which wiz are always accused of stealing kills.  He also understand it&#39;s <br/>
Voy who did the stealing and I&#39;m innocent.  GM Glim then went off shortly.<br/>
<br/>
Later part of the hunt, this Lionessa come over and drop comments saying <br/>
she have make few stealers banned by GM since she played EQ for 4 mths. <br/>
 WTF?  My problem if she kill too slow?  I wanna stressed again that the <br/>
casters in my groups NEVER steal kill, in the sense that we never wait for <br/>
other teams to hurt the mobs for 30-40% HP b4 we start to nuke.  Members <br/>
like Ling, Flyingfox, Satoru and myself hunt often but I&#39;m firm to say we <br/>
gain xp with our hard work.  When there are groups of lvl 20s steal from <br/>
us, we hardly make any noise but to hunt elsewhere, so I can&#39;t understand <br/>
why cry babies like Lionessa make so much noise.  Anyway later Demitry <br/>
suggest to all group members to petition for players harrassment (since her <br/>
words sounded SO threatening, hehe), and well, no GM come, haha.<br/>
<br/>
This is just a note to all local kakis to watch out for this member <br/>
Voyesbian.  Not that we are not helpful but I caution all to think twice <br/>
before helping this kinda players.<br/>
<br/>
Our boss Wylven (who is unaware of this incident) made Voyesbian a guild <br/>
officer last weekend, and the thought of sharing an officer post with such <br/>
player make me sick.<br/>
<br/>
Ziltus.<br/>
<br/>
p/s: U guys noticed we got more wiz in guild nowadays?  After me, Les, Sat <br/>
(high elf) and Ling (erudite), the rest of the new wiz are all from DE. <br/>
 Hehe.</div>
