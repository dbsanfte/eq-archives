<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297881565">Hey Massiah,<br/>
<br/>
Dun quit lah.  Keep the account lor.  On and off login and play with us. <br/>
 Better than quit and later kena attracted to another massive online RPG, u <br/>
know the effect - countless sleepless nights, no day no night no life etc. <br/>
 At least after playing so long in EQ, kinda immune to the temptation of <br/>
PLing.  Keep ya acct la.  If grow tired of mage then make a new char like <br/>
me lor.  Play play other char, or even other sex ;)  I now playing a mage, <br/>
maybe u can make a wiz lor, we team like the good old days, hehe.   I still <br/>
waiting for ya pet to help my twink get jboot ah ;P<br/>
<br/>
One thing I like abt EQ is tat I can totally forget abt it when I dun feel <br/>
like playing it.  Unlike UO, I gotta login 1-2 times per week to refresh <br/>
houses ;(  I also thinking of further study next yr, so very hesitated to <br/>
pick up new games (if u join the SG-Online-RPGers mailing list, u know <br/>
there are few very solid massive RPG coming up).  If I stick with EQ and/or <br/>
UO accts, at least the monthly payment will prevent me from forking our <br/>
more money to play new games, u know lah, married man, gotta think abt <br/>
family budget, hehe (unless u pple all quit UO/EQ then I will also go <br/>
over).<br/>
<br/>
Btw Bibi and Zan, still playing D2?  Lesh is also taking exam soon. <br/>
 Hopefully I can get lvl 51 by the time he come back and we can get 52 <br/>
together.  After tat, we will slow down our pace and spend more time with <br/>
guild pple.  Expect more taxi in near future ;)<br/>
