<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082379">If I quit, I will sell it off for 2 reasons:<br/>
1. To recover my usage fee so far.  I wanna enjoy the game FOC whenever <br/>
possible, and earn abit for sacrifacing my time for my sleep, heh.<br/>
2. It&#39;s really a waste to terminate an acct with high lvl wiz, afterall it <br/>
took me several months to achieve it.  I will rather sell it and let <br/>
someone else to con&#39;t playing it.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve come up with a nice idea, using wiz to camp for item and earn RL <br/>
money.  My main purpose of play games is to enjoy it instead of making <br/>
money.  If it doesn&#39;t take up much time to use ya method to earn some quick <br/>
buck, I will give it a try.  But if it required days of camping like Jboot, <br/>
I will rather spend time playing UO, hehe.<br/>

&gt; I dun play EQ for fun actually,hheeh maybe<br/>
&gt; some but main concent is to make real life<br/>
&gt; outta EQ :p<br/>
&gt; Sold a few K of pp n some rare item already<br/>
&gt; make a total of about 600(S$1000) us dollar.<br/>
&gt; If u think EQ as a money making media , maybe<br/>
&gt; it will hook on u back to EQ if u can see the<br/>
&gt; fortune it will bring to u :p<br/>
&gt; And it really stupid to sell the account<br/>
