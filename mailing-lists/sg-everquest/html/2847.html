<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730558115">I have killed more than enuff bard so far (beyond repair liao), even the <br/>
green bard in Felwithe attacks me everytime I go near him, does that mean <br/>
my fraction with mistmoore is very good? ;)<br/>
<br/>
I heard from Fesse that the dino in OOT give lousy loot, so no point to <br/>
camp for it, but it will be fun to form a grp to bangbang it for once or <br/>
twice, shiok ;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m now 39, shld be getting my lvl 40 hell in 1 or 2 days time.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
solo kiting Ulir and Ein in WK.  I understand once I reach 42 Ulir will be <br/>
super green to me and give no xp.  What other places r there for a soli <br/>
kiting wiz from 40 to say, 45?  (NB: The single sprectre I heard is good <br/>
xp, under which lvl?  Thou&#39; pple said it&#39;s always camp but same thing is <br/>
said for barb village in WK yet I always can find a seat there w/o any <br/>
prob).  Anything to take note when kiting the single sprectre?<br/>
<br/>
So at 39, I can solo ancient croc.  Btw, is root still good for my lvl?  I <br/>
mean, there are enstill and immobolize on top so which one is more <br/>
effective?  I heard some pple saying root is still better at high lvl <br/>
whereas others said it&#39;s often resisted by high lvl mobs.<br/>
<br/>
OK, I give up on WK ogre, didn&#39;t know it&#39;s so high lvl.  Btw Mass say the <br/>
batskull is a rare drop...doesn&#39;t worth the time and effort. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Seem like OOT got good kills and good loots for high 30s till mid 40s, can <br/>
elaborate further (both for wiz solo and grp).<br/>
<br/>
Fesse tell me must be at least lvl 40 to solo runed circlet (I know <br/>
halfling warrior who solo got it at 36 btw), so which is true?<br/>
<br/>
Got the exact loc of Hadden?  What is his lvl?  How long is his spawn time?<br/>
<br/>
Btw, is it true tat super green undead will attack u regardless how high ya <br/>
lvl is (in both bafallen and unrest)?  Or the normal rules applies (ie if <br/>
too high lvl, they won&#39;t attack u?)<br/>
<br/>
As for unrest, is the method u mention an exploitt?  I read from the net <br/>
that sometime GM hide there and teleport u to the mobs instead.  ;(  Tat <br/>
knight good xp and money for what lvl till wat lvl, what&#39;s his hp and lvl?<br/>
<br/>
Wat abt the bug section in Sol b, can elaborate further?<br/>
<br/>
Ziltus, solo kiter...<br/>
<br/>
p/s: I wonder other than febon, kell and mass, do we have anymore early 40s <br/>
members which we can form grp to explore the tougher dungone?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The lvl 50ishs in guild always busy hunting in planes or dragons, ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought of hunting some other lvl 50ish+ mobs in Norrath?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Eg<br/>
&gt; &gt; - &quot;Gozilla&quot; (a dinosaur) in OOT, &gt;lvl 50<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Mist Castle Lord, the lvl 50 dracula<br/>
&gt; &gt; - etc<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Btw, what&#39;s the min lvl for wiz to solo the following zones/mobs:<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Lguk (think it&#39;s time to camp for some gator armors)<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Permafrost (for runed circlet)<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Hadden (for fishbone earring)<br/>
&gt; &gt; - WK Ogre shaman (for batskull earring, what&#39;s the min lvl for me to<br/>
&gt; attack<br/>
&gt; &gt; ths shaman while the other 5 guards won&#39;t swarm against me?)<br/>
&gt; &gt; - OOT Oracle and her body guard (heard oracle robe is good money)<br/>
&gt; &gt; - OOT ogre and hill giant<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Unrest<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Befallen<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Sol A<br/>
&gt; &gt; - SG in Sro/Oasis (kite and nuke)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thx.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; p/s: Any high lvl zone spot where PL-trainer can pull a red mob (con to<br/>
&gt; lvl<br/>
&gt; &gt; 40ish), whack it to 10% HP, zone and let us finish it to get the &quot;reb <br/>
