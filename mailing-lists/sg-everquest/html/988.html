<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673486080">Jus a thought.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone start off been very poor, and even at lvl 18, I&#39;m still very poor, <br/>
unlike our rich man Garren, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
We guys gotta learn to stand on our feet sometime.  I think brewing is a <br/>
very useful trade skill which can easily fulfill ya financial needs, just <br/>
that it&#39;s kinda boring and take times.  Nevertheless comparing with <br/>
hunting, brewing still give me better and faster return than hunting so <br/>
far.  If we can spend 1-3 hrs a day brewing, I dun see why the new chaps <br/>
cant do the same ;)  No doubt we try to help by sponsoring abit, but u guys <br/>
have to help us to help yaself sometimes ;)<br/>
<br/>
One thing for sure, we the local kakis always keep items which we think <br/>
other kakis can used (eg I keep cutt ring for newbies, ring mails for <br/>
tanks, garren keep thu robe for me, les keep woven for me etc).  We will <br/>
try to help as and when we can, but one must understand the fact tat <br/>
utimately u r the one playing the game and handling ya own char, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, brewing can make some quick buck.  At lvl 10 u shld be able to save <br/>
up to 10pp.  Of coz I know pple will use them to buy stuffs like <br/>
weap/armor/scrolls.  But just ponder - if u spend it on brewing, u can earn <br/>
even more to buys stuffs, at the same time maxing ya skill.<br/>
<br/>
At lvl 18 now, I&#39;m still picking up bone chips, rusty weaps, animal skins, <br/>
beetle eyes and even rat tooth (7cp) to sell.  FYI I&#39;m a wiz with the <br/>
weakest STR amg all races and I keep SIX bags on me to carry loot.  Many <br/>
times u see me walking between EC and WC while I&#39;m actually running with <br/>
200% overload on me, haha.    If I can try so hard to save up money, I dun <br/>
see why others cant do it. ;P<br/>

<br/>
p/s:  Just FYI, the npc at tunnel buy at a lower price than FP npc, so I <br/>
die die gotta &#39;walk&#39; back to FP sell.  Now u see I earn all my money using <br/>
all my blood, sweat and tears, hehe ;)</div>
