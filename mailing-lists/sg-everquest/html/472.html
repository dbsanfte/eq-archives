<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262591810">We really need more support classes.5 tanks(and strangely enough, most<br/>
are paladins) out of 9 people is not a balance group and Leshrac is<br/>
playing the only evil character in the whole group.<br/>
<br/>
If more tanks are created, I might change class to a druid or shaman<br/>
<br/>
Also, someone mind playing an evil character to support Leshrac?<br/>
<br/>
Again, I ask you people to state the time/how frequent you play. In<br/>
addition, mind tellling me which trade skills you are persuding?<br/>
<br/>
The reason I asked about trade skills is to reduce the amount of money<br/>
the whole group needs to spend in the long term before we can get useful<br/>
stuff like armor from the skills.<br/>
<br/>
