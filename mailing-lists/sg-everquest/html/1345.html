<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-829805353">Hmm, we used to test play in Prexus when it 1st started.  More thsn half of <br/>
us join the new server but in the end all come back to innoruuk.  Guess the <br/>
new server wont work now, esp &quot;some pple&quot; already reach lvl 30, surely wont <br/>
join lah ;)<br/>
The only exception is the race war server, but again, by the time it&#39;s up, <br/>
I think half of us already at least lvl 20 in innoruuk, chance is slim to <br/>
move over.<br/>
<br/>
As for the min lvl requirement, I fully agreed.  My UO guild also have a <br/>
min stats/skills requirements for recruitment.  The main concern here is to <br/>
ensure we get those with at least intermediate game knowlegde and not those <br/>
who spam the guildsay day and night asking this and that.  Mentality and <br/>
play-style also must be considered at the same time (ie lvl 50 stealer also <br/>
cant join) H/w, I think lvl 16 is abit rigid, coz it&#39;s the 5th circle for <br/>
casters but not for hyrid or tanks.  My suggestion is to recruit members of <br/>
at least 5th circle.  Eg, wiz get new spells at lvl 1, 4, 8, 12, 16.  So <br/>
lvl 16 is our 5th circle.  H/w, for cleric, I think theirs is lvl 1, 5, 9, <br/>
etc, so their 5th circle will be 1 lvl higher or lower than us.  Maybe we <br/>
can consider using &#39;circle&#39; as a guildline instead of lvl.<br/>
<br/>
Of coz, since this is a mainly-local guild, local will have special <br/>
prevledge.  I&#39;ve no objection if we set no min requirement or much lower <br/>
requirement for local member entry as compared to other nation players.  As <br/>
for the entry requirement, my suggestion is to use it as a &#39;general&#39; <br/>
guildline.  If we know some very trusty-worhty and good players, even <br/>
thought they maybe below 5th circle, but based on their knowledge (eg they <br/>
do lots of research on EQ) and theie commitment, and we believe that they <br/>
will be very loyalty to guild, we can also submit them to the &#39;council&#39; for <br/>
recruitment.  Most impt these candidate must not do anything to spoil our <br/>
guild reputation.<br/>
<br/>
We shld also appoint only few pple to do recruitment and each recruitment <br/>
MUST be recommended by exisiting trusty-worthy members.  Recruiter shld be <br/>
those who know the geography pretty well and can travel fast (eg speed <br/>
song, SoW or teleport spells).<br/>
<br/>
Ultimate achievement is to make everyone who see our guild name, it remind <br/>
them on a all-time honorable, kang-ho kick ass guild ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;1. What kinda guild is this gonna be?  A friend-friend kinda guild <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(like<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;our curren QHD and when it grows, problematic members may pop up), a<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;role-playing guild with certain policy and discipline (ie insist to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>follow<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;the path of good and honor, so that when pple look at our abbrev, they<br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;we are the good guys, this type of guild will require some formal<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;organisation structure).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;// I feel a rping guild would be best, since I HATE trolls and ogres <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(They<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;smell bad and tend to take up too much of the dungeon corridors spaces.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Of course we would be a goody two shoes guild since all the ppl playing <br/>
 </span></blockquote>are<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;good chars<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;2. Will this guild going to be a Singaporean only, Asians only or<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;international guild?  If we were to open to other nations players, how <br/>
 </span></blockquote>can<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;we enforce discipline?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;//Make it mostly Singaporeans, MOSTLY. Maybe 5-10% foreigners such as <br/>
 </span></blockquote>very<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;close and trustworthy friends or those who live up to their names.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;3. Wylven&#39;s feeling, this is one of my most concern part - how would he<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;feel when we leave guild and form our own?  Will he think &quot;wah, last <br/>
 </span></blockquote>time<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;newbie I help u guys, u guys also find kakis to team in the guild, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>which<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;turn helps alot in lvling, now all feather grow up liao, wanna fly away<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;ah?&quot;?  If we were to leave QHD and form a new guild, we must be very<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;careful to handle this part since most of us, if not all, still respect<br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;as a good and honorable friend.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;//Yeah this would prolly be the most difficult part since we all joined <br/>
 </span></blockquote>QHD<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;while we were quite new and as I said, Wylven is a very nice guy, so we<br/>
&gt; &gt;would definately would not want to offend him.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;4. Do we consider forming alliance with QHD?  In UO, one of my pioneer<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;members leave us and form his guild.  H/w we never take it to heart and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;the end we form a very close alliance - whenever TAA need help, tDw <br/>
 </span></blockquote>will<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;ard, vice versa.  Until now, they are still our closest allies.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;//As of such, we should help the members of QHD as much as our own guild<br/>
&gt; &gt;members if we have an alliance with them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;5. How abt those players who join QHD due to our recommendation. <br/>
 </span></blockquote> Players<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;like Ling, Flyingfox, Deadflower, Satoru, Woodbridge etc will most<br/>
&gt; probably<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;leave QHD and join us if I leave also.  Same for other local kakis who<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;friends who will follow them to the new guild if we quit from QHD. <br/>
 </span></blockquote> This<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;will further increase the number of players leaving QHD, at least 1/3 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;the guild, I guess.  How are we going to explain to Wylven?  I&#39;m worry <br/>
 </span></blockquote>he<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;feel very dishearted with so many members leaving at one time, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;indirectly, again, it reflect something wrong with his guild and tat&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>why<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;we are leaving to form our own guild.  We must be very cautious <br/>
 </span></blockquote>handling<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;this matter.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;//We should tell him the main reason of leaving is because we want to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>form<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;our own local guild and not in any way his fault on handling guild <br/>
 </span></blockquote>issues.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;About the 1/3 of guild leaving, I think its not a problem. I see many <br/>
 </span></blockquote>new<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;members everyday being recruited in QHD. Might be other character&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;alternates, but from the guildsays I saw, I think not.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;6. How are we going to maintain members quality and guild reputation? <br/>
 </span></blockquote> I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;think to avoid misunderstanding in future (most importantly, not to end <br/>
 </span></blockquote>up<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;like wat is happening in QHD now), all new members shld be briefed abt <br/>
 </span></blockquote>our<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;guild policy and direction, what can or cannot be done when they are <br/>
 </span></blockquote>one<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;us.  This is something I did when I accept my UO guild membership.  My <br/>
 </span></blockquote>UO<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;guild has a membership application form in our guild site to fill up <br/>
 </span></blockquote>some<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;queries to enable us better understand the candidate and if he/she is<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;accepted, I will send the person a standard letter stating the general<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;policy of the guild.  For those which I find them not suitable to join <br/>
 </span></blockquote>us<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;(eg those players who enjoy pking, looting), I will also reply them to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>let<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;them know why they are not accepted and they will still be considered <br/>
 </span></blockquote>IF<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;they promise to follow our discipline.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;//I feel the guild should have a something like a council that decides <br/>
 </span></blockquote>if a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;member joins. It might take anywhere from a day to a week to recruit<br/>
&gt; &gt;someone, but this would mean better quality members.(Doing a quest would <br/>
 </span></blockquote>be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;cool too) As for guild policy, what if the member reads, then joins and<br/>
&gt; &gt;commits offences. Yes, we might sack him but he might have already <br/>
 </span></blockquote>damaged<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;our guild&#39;s reputation. I think the best way is to only recruit those we<br/>
&gt; &gt;know personally. On this issue, I feel we should only recruit outsiders<br/>
&gt; &gt;(Foreigners and other NEW members) that are above level 16. Although it <br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;unfair to those of lower levels, I feel this is the bare minimum that a<br/>
&gt; &gt;player should attain before joining a guild. Several reasons for it. 1. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>If<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;we let everyone join, then the guild might become kuching kurah guild. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>2.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Guild reputation is very important. What if he doesn&#39;t know anything, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;keep spamming in the whole zone &quot; Did anyone see my corpse? Can someone<br/>
&gt; help<br/>
&gt; &gt;me?&quot; 20 times (I saw it happen before). 3. Everyone WAS a newbie once, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;not ALL newbies ask lame questions like how to get this, how to get <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So<br/>
&gt; &gt;this would of course be very irritating to other members of the guild if <br/>
 </span></blockquote>he<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;repeats this over guildsay. 4. If we recruit someone of very low level, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>1-4<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt;he might just get recruited, go around spoiling our guild reputation and<br/>
&gt; &gt;just delete off his character. Of course the damage is already done..<br/>
