	Well, I had a very enjoyable nite playing with a Shaman Ogre. He roleplays<br/>
his char quite well and it was really enjoyable to play with some1 who<br/>
roleplays even if it&#39;s just semi roleplaying. Trust me give roleplaying a<br/>
try. Turn off the shout if u don&#39;t like it. But then again u would want to<br/>
