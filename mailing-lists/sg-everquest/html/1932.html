&gt; Oh, forget to reply this part:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; the guild should be about helping each other (esp when u really need it)<br/>
&gt; and hunting<br/>
&gt; &gt; together at times...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yep, at &#39;times&#39;, but not &#39;ALL time&#39; ;)<br/>
&gt; Like I said, yes, shld help one another.  But u mentioned 1 SOS and all<br/>
&gt; have to drop wat they doing to come and help, isn&#39;t it too &#39;ground<br/>
&gt; shaking&#39;? ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; if u wanna swap stuff... thats more of a favor rather than a<br/>
&gt; &gt; SOS... pls differentiate the 2 things! if u have 2 bloody chars... and 1<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; high level... then is easy lah... just give consent and let ya other<br/>
&gt; char<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; come in n loot lor... but if someone seriously needs help... help<br/>
&gt; should be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; given... THAST IS WHATS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER GUILD... if u think that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; camping a stupid shield is more impt that this matter... then i give<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; &gt; on this guild liaoz....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not the only one who think of dropping stuffs and let my other char<br/>
&gt; pick it, Les has done it before too when I wasn&#39;t online to help him last<br/>
&gt; time (initially we r the 1st 2 HE wiz and we dunno other kakis yet).  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; using the swap item as an example, cool down man ;)  I&#39;m just trying to<br/>
&gt; point out that, to u, ya matter is the most impt, but to other, they will<br/>
&gt; to feel that way for their own matter.  Back to my illustration, if I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; camp the shield for 5 hrs, and I know it will be dropped anytime in the<br/>
&gt; next hr, while someone need a help to retrieve his corpse, and this CAN be<br/>
&gt; done by other kakis online, I see no reason why ALL (including myself)<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; to drop what they are doing and come to ya rescue.  Whether in RL or in<br/>
EQ,<br/>
&gt; we do have to be &#39;efficient&#39; sometimes. ;)  Helping a member to get his<br/>
&gt; corpse is not something that required ALL other kakis to participate.<br/>
Just<br/>
&gt; like in UO, do u respond to all SOS icq? ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well if u still insist when there is a SOS msg, and expect ALL kakis<br/>
online<br/>
&gt; to rush to him, then I will perosnally think that my 5hrs camping is more<br/>
&gt; important than saving that stupid corpse ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m also very flexible in such things, but general guidelines must still<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; lay down.  Ah-hoc cases and individual members&#39; atttitude and playing<br/>
style<br/>
&gt; must also be considered.  If you can name me any guild in EQ where ALL<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; rush to any SOS msg send in guildsay, tell me, I also wanan join ;)<br/>
