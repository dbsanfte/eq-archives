<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846230789">From our ex-guild QHD:<br/>
<br/>
August 24, 1999 - sorry for the delay, i&#39;ve been really busy lately with <br/>
school starting and losing alot of my valuable Everquest time, members page <br/>
updated..not much else to do =) Another thing I would like to address is <br/>
that this guild may be in it&#39;s final days...many have left to start their <br/>
own guilds in groups which is fine but from the start we recruited way too <br/>
many people (like 80 at one point) and lost track and control over things. <br/>
I don&#39;t know for sure yet but /guilddelete may be used sometime soon =( <br/>
It&#39;s not that I no longer like this guild or anything but I have a limited <br/>
amount of time with school starting, etc. So email your thoughts if you <br/>
wish.</div>
