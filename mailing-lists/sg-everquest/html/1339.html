<br/>
I can understand how it feels to put all your effort into EQ and now face the prospect of losing it all.<br/>
And since i think you&#39;re a nice guy/gal (heh) who helps ppl out and all that...i&#39;m willing to help you here.<br/>
<br/>
However, i do first want to know how i can help you with my credit card. You have to enter the number right?<br/>
After all, much as i think you&#39;re a nice guy, money is still money and credit card numbers are dangerous<br/>
to pass around =) I&#39;m sure everyone can understand that.<br/>
<br/>
I delete all msgs upon reading and so forgot to keep that email add of yours... so here&#39;s mine<br/>
