<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192761038">The following has been posted to the patch server:<br/>
To accommodate the increased number of players, we will be bringing a new <br/>
server on-line. The server will be of the standard type, not unique, such <br/>
as the Rallos Zek (PvP) server. We estimate that it should be up and <br/>
running by either late Monday or Tuesday of next week. The name of the new <br/>
server will be released on Monday.<br/>
