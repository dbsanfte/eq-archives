&gt; I also got it, play it to lvl 10 barbarian.  Notice how many necro and sor<br/>
&gt; out there?  KNN I think even pally is more than barb. The least shld be<br/>
ama<br/>
&gt; and barb. I think there is a bug in D2.  The last game which I play to lvl<br/>
&gt; 10, kena kick out of game, and when I return, I go back to lvl 5!!!!<br/>
*&%&%#<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the end play again till 3am, managed to get back to lvl 9 only.  Good<br/>
&gt; thing is tat I find a very good staff tat increase quite a few of casting<br/>
&gt; skills and a set armor tunic.  Both I used to &#39;twink&#39; my sor later.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any sor tips pls share, I&#39;m training my barb to look for gp and magical<br/>
&gt; stuffs (barb got a skill to increase %age to find magical stuff).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also go a luck amulet, which I found 2 fire, 2 ruby, 3 skull and 1 emer<br/>
&gt; gems after I wear it, but knn all these gems are gone when my char<br/>
crashed.<br/>
&gt;  Lucky I still got the amulet and found 1 fire, 1 ice and 1 skull gem<br/>
&gt; later...<br/>
