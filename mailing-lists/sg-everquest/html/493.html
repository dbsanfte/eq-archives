<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144353190">Aye i&#39;m intending to improve my faction not for the sake of good, but rather<br/>
to fool the pale skinned beings, whom many of you call humans into believing<br/>
I am fighting for their cause. However, I am loyal only to Innoruuk himself<br/>
and for that, I say HAIL INNORUUK. Seeing the humans die shall always be my<br/>
joy, however i always welcome another ally in Evil.-----&gt;Mondain )<br/>
ooc Although the gnomish necro has the best stats, I chose dark elf after<br/>
seeing a fully equipped Tier&#39;dal necro wearing full Gossmer armor, not sure<br/>
of the spelling who looked really nice . I saw many gnomish warriors wear<br/>
armor and they look kinda stumpy hehe.<br/>
btw, the human guards in commons won&#39;t attack, neither do the guards in<br/>
freeport, they are evil. I got a dubious con on most of them, but those with<br/>
SIR, u better watch out. They are the self proclaimed paladins and are fools<br/>
imho. Innkeepers in commons are KOS to us tho, so if u plan on coming<br/>
commons, don&#39;t go near them. They are better martial arts expert than the<br/>
guards.<br/>
Any yes, if possible i would like to wipe out a goody town when i&#39;m very<br/>
high level. imagine seeing the bodies of those pale skin beings lying on the<br/>
floor in a bloody heap. Yummy )<br/>

&gt;Anyone read the recent EQ review in CGW June issue?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It pointed out that EQ is more of a hack and slash RPG while UO has more<br/>
&gt;stuffs other than hack & slash.   Somehow I agree coz seem like I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;nothing much to do other than blasting monsters in EQ, hehe.   Dunno how<br/>
&gt;long can this &#39;blasting&#39; will last me in EQ ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Btw, I&#39;m having a hard time in Steamfont Mountain after my wiz achieve lvl<br/>
&gt;5 via soloing, AGAIN.  As in Felwithe, I&#39;m having a hard time finding a<br/>
&gt;good team to gain XP to higher lvl. 90% of the team I mixed so far sux -<br/>
&gt;some members even disband and flee when a train of monsters killed our<br/>
&gt;tanks and rushed towards the casters, LOL. (Oh remember the name David,<br/>
&gt;this guy looted everything in group hunting and said &quot;who loot also nimnd&quot;,<br/>
&gt;hehe, and he is always the first one who disband and flee when danger arise<br/>
&gt;- his name disappear in group list not becoz he LD but I personally see him<br/>
&gt;running off, hehe).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone make a gnomish char?  Need a buddy badly there ;)  If not, I will<br/>
&gt;create a TSK or TSH (someone said we need more cleric/shaman chars in<br/>
&gt;Prexus guild?) and solo all the way - ie make the darkest evil char.  Kinda<br/>
&gt;sian finding pple to team with.  Been a lawful good char in UO, maybe it &#39;s<br/>
&gt;time to make a chaotic evil one in EQ, wahahahaha!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Btw, Leshrec, need to check with u.  Regarding ya DEN, do u intend to<br/>
&gt;role-play evil or intend to &quot;turn over a new leave&quot; (ie improve ya faction<br/>
&gt;with other races)?  Anyone ever think of building a high lvl EVIL char and<br/>
&gt;wipe off an npc town? hehehe.<br/>
