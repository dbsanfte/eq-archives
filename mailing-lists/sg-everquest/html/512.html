<div id="ygrps-yiv-396760628">But dun forget cleric is a lousy tank at high lvl abt 20.  He can&#39;t fight <br/>
his way as a semi tank + healer.  On the other hand, if we r talking abt <br/>
undead terriority, I think he can fight on par with warrior due to his holy <br/>
skills ;)<br/>
<br/>
Troll dun have cleric btw, only shaman. Talk abt shaman, I think they can <br/>
fight better than cleric, but their healing abilities is somewhat one step <br/>
behind cleric&#39;s.  Comparing cleric and shaman, cleric is better in defend <br/>
(healing) while the latter is better in offence, both healer/fighters. <br/>
 Troll shaman gain additional edge by regenerating HP, so still can &#39;tong&#39; <br/>
a while.<br/>
<br/>
One thing abt high lvl cleric (lvl 40 and above), they will be healing 95% <br/>
of the time.  Kinda boring if u ask me. But they will be forever welcome by <br/>
all groups.  Esp high lvl cleric can help to train low lvl char by bringing <br/>
them to fight high lvl monsters and healing them.  Oh, they are so damn <br/>
holy - basically serving others more than themselves!  If u know a lvl 40+ <br/>
cleric who is willing to spend a day with u in high lvl dungeon, I think u <br/>
can easily gain 10-20 lvl (someone in Innoruuk ever told me a high lvl <br/>
cleric help a newbie to gain up to lvl 22 in just 1 day!).<br/>
<br/>
Hey, u got any high lvl cleric friend to introduce? ;)<br/>
