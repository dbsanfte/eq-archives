<br/>
What to say leh?  No motivation to login leh.  Think of the camping and <br/>
lvling also sian liao.  Esp so many kakis already reach lvl 40 plus, me too <br/>
weak to hunt those big mobs with u guys, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Now I didn&#39;t login EQ, and seldom login UO too (coz very laggy due to some <br/>
hardware problems at server side).  Every night play Revenant, very cool <br/>
game, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I also lost track with all the new stuffs in EQ (heard there is <br/>
dunno simi new temple, new quests etc).  Anyone can advise me what to do <br/>
when I login, other than role-playing a public transport? ;P<br/>
<br/>
Freddy invited me into AC mailing list I also dun dare to join, scare to <br/>
kena hook-up again (took me so long to &#39;lose&#39; some interest in EQ and UO), <br/>
hehe.<br/>

p/s: Also busy with my RL house renovation ;)  If I dun get everything done <br/>
by X&#39;mas, next year I have to stay in those cheapskate Hotel 81 liao, hehe.<br/>

&gt; Not in any particular order: Leshrec, Yutaka, Ziltus, Shinji, Trifrost<br/>
&gt; and Ling has went MIA from Innoruuk for way too long.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Trifrost and Ling has more or less state their excuse, what about the<br/>
&gt; rest of you for still being MIA?<br/>
