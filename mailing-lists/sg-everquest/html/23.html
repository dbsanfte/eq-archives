<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611256004">Greetings,<br/>
In one of my last posts, I mentioned that I would doubt a Singapore Guild<br/>
forming for at least the next 8 months cos...<br/>
<br/>
A)You need at least 10 regular memebers that play frequently.<br/>
B)You need to upkeep the guild *IF* I am right ;-)<br/>
C)You have to have a reputation...<br/>
D)The guild must be organised I guess, not like UO where I go around seeing<br/>
people with titles above their head like [1800-Suk-Ass] or [Masta Blasta,FG]<br/>
<br/>
I never meant to sound so negative. Sorry but my type tone always seem so<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m guild master of The Dark Wardens of UO.  We haven&#39;t shifted over to EQ<br/>
&gt; and most probably won&#39;t as many of our members still stay loyal to UO ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; H/w, some of us are coming over to EQ (ie play both games, not migrate<br/>
&gt; totally), maybe as a new guild or using old guild name.  So far no<br/>
concrete<br/>
&gt; plan yet, we are all waiting for our copy of EQ, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Regards,<br/>
