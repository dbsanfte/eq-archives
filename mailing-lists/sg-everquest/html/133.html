<div id="ygrps-yiv-465443832">Yo,<br/>
<br/>
Since no one has made an wizard amg our kakis, I&#39;ve decided to make one 2 <br/>
days ago.  Now my wiz is lvl 3.  So far I&#39;ve spend my practice points on 2H <br/>
blunt, chanelling, adjure, evoke and alter.  I still have 10 points with <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestion what other skills to train?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how the skills thingy work, if there is a total skill cap for <br/>
your char.  I wish to learn some  $$$ skills which do not required much $$$ <br/>
(eg on buying material, initial investment and l/t investment), any <br/>
suggestion?<br/>
<br/>
So far I didnt spend any practice points in melee skills.  I started off <br/>
with a dagger and when I earn enuff $$$ to buy worn great stave, I keep on <br/>
using it.  The skills rise when I hunt with the staves.  I would also like <br/>
to seek advice if it&#39;s worth to train unarmed melee skills for wiz (like in <br/>
monk).  If there is a total skill cap, I will try to specialize in 1 or 2 <br/>
melee skills.  If not skill cap, I dun mind training unarmed combat skill <br/>
since after the newbie period, I wouldn&#39;t resurrect with a dagger, right?<br/>
<br/>
Any recommendation what spells are good for wiz?  Also, is there any way to <br/>
make medation a hotkey? (sorry for those who reply me on my previous <br/>
mediation query, I need to ask again coz I dunno what u mean)<br/>
<br/>
Btw, my wiz is a high-elf, name is Ziltus, after his long-lost brother <br/>
Zilred (enchanter) ;)</div>
