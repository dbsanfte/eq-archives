Here&#39;s a short excerpt...<br/>
<br/>
Paladin Armor of Ro:  This is an extremely involved quest.   For <br/>
each piece of armor, you need to do three things. <br/>
<br/>
1) You need to get the mold for the item.  You do this by fetching <br/>
the quest items and turning them in to the NPC who gives the<br/>
item quest.  You need to develop a high faction with the NPC&#39;s <br/>
Guild before he or she will give you the quest.  You can get the<br/>
quests immediately from those who view you warmly.  Those who <br/>
view you amiably will request that you go to their guild and talk<br/>
to someone there first before getting the quest.  Those below <br/>
amiable will not talk to you.  Below are the people who start the<br/>
quests and the methods of getting the molds for each item.  All <br/>
molds are no drop lore items, so whoever turns in the items must<br/>
finish the quest.<br/>
<br/>
Step 2 involves making a metal called ronium, and step 3 is to <br/>
combine the mould and the metal in a forge.<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
<br/>
The steps seem very complicated, and you need high smithing <br/>
skill. Not sure if it&#39;s worth it or not....<br/>
