&gt; &gt;This is a general warning to all u hardy adventurers.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;This above mentioned person (who has changed name twice because she is so<br/>
&gt; &gt;hated) is a known kill stealer and loot stealer. She is now a &quot;hunted&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;person by most of the high levels in the realm.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;She can be recognized by her new name Umriistin (or something like that).<br/>
&gt; &gt;She is the green eyed darkelf (the pretty one unforunately), wearing an<br/>
&gt; &gt;oracle robe, carrying a glowing stein and staff of writhing (same graphic<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt;POD&#39;s staff). She is in role-playing mode and may or may not still be in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;guild &lt;Qui&#39;Hadom&gt;(or however thats spelled). She is in the low level 30s.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Why is she hunted by the high levels? Well, she tagged along on our<br/>
&gt; &gt;serverwide event of the slaying of Nagefen (40+ people involved). When we<br/>
&gt; &gt;killed 2 of the 3 named level 52 bosses, she looted them immediately once<br/>
&gt; &gt;the killing party&#39;s loot period was over (they were NO DROP items, and the<br/>
&gt; &gt;group that killed it didnt have priority over the item). Whats more, she<br/>
&gt; &gt;didnt admit to it when asked &quot;Who looted?&quot;. Even worse, when people SAW her<br/>
&gt; &gt;loot the 2nd kill (the 1st one noone saw because we still had to deal with<br/>
&gt; 2<br/>
&gt; &gt;fire giants after killing the boss monster), she denied and said she was<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;ducking&quot;, thats 2 different and obvious graphics from ducking and looting.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Then she pushed the blame to Holyomen saying he looted. But Holyomen was<br/>
&gt; &gt;halfway across the room! So, Kelseferious was called in (after checking<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt;his supervisor) and low and behold... he did an inventory check and u<br/>
&gt; &gt;guessed it! It was in her inventory! He destroyed it and created a new one<br/>
&gt; &gt;and gave it to its elected owner. We told her to leave after, but she<br/>
&gt; &gt;wouldnt (only dragon left at this time). She went invis and stood in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;corner. We couldnt do anything... so we went for nag... well, we failed and<br/>
&gt; &gt;many died several times. During CR, our rogues actually found Maquis&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;corpse in lava under nagafen! We were overjoyed! We did everyones CR but<br/>
&gt; &gt;hers, she deserved nothing less. Then we all gated out. Only leaving 2<br/>
&gt; &gt;people. One of them decided to take pity on her and actually managed to get<br/>
&gt; &gt;Maquis&#39;s corpse back! DAMN! Well, Umriistin has got her equipment back now,<br/>
&gt; &gt;much to the dismay of the other 40 of us who wanted to leave her clothed<br/>
&gt; &gt;corpse in the lava to rot (even the GMs wont do anything). She alone<br/>
&gt; spoiled<br/>
&gt; &gt;what would have been an enjoyable event.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Anyway, this is just a warning to all u out there as to what this<br/>
&gt; individual<br/>
&gt; &gt;is capable of. Whether u want to take heed to this or not is up to u. Im<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt;in the mood to argue or debate about ethics and stuff. If u dont agree with<br/>
&gt; &gt;me, so be it. If u do, just beware of this person. She hangs around bosses<br/>
&gt; &gt;and ninja loots them once the loot time is over. She has also been seen<br/>
&gt; &gt;around Solusek B and Cazic Thule recently. Oh and she does talk ALOT. Do<br/>
&gt; &gt;check out the /ooc in these areas and u will probably see her talking away<br/>
&gt; &gt;(she never stops!). She trains alot too.<br/>
