<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232013277">Wat&#39;s the min lvl for VP ah?<br/>
<br/>
According to Higo, any char below 55 (or he mean 55 and below, pls clarify) <br/>
will not get any trakky tooth (regardless if he helps in the raid or not, <br/>
often or once in a blue moon).<br/>
<br/>
In that case does it mean those 55 and below shld spend our time lvling <br/>
instead of joining raids at the mean time?<br/>
<br/>
Say if later all high 50 and 60 got the keys while we (the lowbies) lvling, <br/>
will we get help from guild/alliance later when we reach tat kinda lvl? (eg <br/>
guess no event to get HS keys nowadays for those who can hunt there now).<br/>
<br/>
