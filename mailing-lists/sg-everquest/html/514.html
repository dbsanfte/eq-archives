<br/>
The grass will always appear greener on the other side unless you&#39;ve been there<br/>
before. so far, with my experience of EQ since the 3rd beta, I have mess around<br/>
with Shadow Knights, Paladins, Enchanters, Necros, Shamans and Magicians. The<br/>
other classes I have not much experiences with so I won&#39;t comment.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with Shadow knight is this.<br/>
<br/>
At first glance, harm touch appears to be very powerful, dealing 10 X level + 1<br/>
damage, but what many people don&#39;t know is that:<br/>
<br/>
1. Harm Touch is counted as an alteration spell. IOWs, it can be resisted.<br/>
2. Being alteration in nature, part of its damage can be resisted.<br/>
<br/>
On average, with a level 13 TSK, I constantly do around 70-80 damage, not the<br/>
full 131 I expect it to do and miss twice ever 10 times I tyr.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you choose Dark Elf or Humans as a SK, you would not be able to cast<br/>
spells the level you get them, as Ogres and Trolls have an aweful intelligence<br/>
score, which bring about another problem, Troll/Orge Shadow Knight gains skills<br/>
at a painful pace. They often find themselves unable to reach the skill cap of<br/>
their level.<br/>
<br/>
On regenaration, at low levels, it is a fantastic thing, but at high level,<br/>
nothing functions better than a real healing spell.<br/>
<br/>
At level 40, an average TSK is expected to have around 1200 hp and would expect<br/>
to take any where from 200-800 hp worth of damage per battle. Even with<br/>
regenaration, it is still take around 10-20mins to regenerate the amount.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the TSK is not really able to solo at high levels. Level 1-15 is easy,<br/>
but after this range, due to slow level advancement and an unreliable way of<br/>
healing, they can&#39;t solo well.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage TSK have over other hybrid warrior classes is that they can still<br/>
bash when using 2 handed slashing weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Troll Shamans are worse off. Being a priest class, they will never gain<br/>
additional attack, and damage they deal is capped. At level 16, you reach your<br/>
melee damage cap.<br/>
<br/>
In addition Shamans don&#39;t really have fantastic direct damage spells nor good<br/>
healing ability so soloing past 16 is hard/near impossible.<br/>
<br/>
Troll Warriors fair slightly better than TSK as they hit harder, faster and has<br/>
more HP, but they still need reliable backup to reach high levels.<br/>
<br/>
Monks I agree is one of the best class to solo with. The various special<br/>
attacks do a lot of damage and mend, at high level almost never fail. Healing<br/>
1/4 of your HP every 6 minutes is damn useful.<br/>
<br/>
Priest class can never solo well unless they go to areas where their wards<br/>
spell can be use (Befallen for Clerics, Elemental Planes for Druids) else they<br/>
fare very badly against normal enermies<br/>
<br/>
For Wizards, the only way they solo is Root -&gt; Damage spells, damage<br/>
spells.......<br/>
<br/>
If root runs out, they&#39;re toast, and most would dash towards the entrance<br/>
bringing trains....... A very common sight.<br/>
<br/>
IMO, these class can solo pretty well from mid to high levels.<br/>
<br/>
Monks<br/>
Necros (Provided that nessesary spells could be researched)<br/>
Magicians (Same as Necro)<br/>
Enchanters (Only after Tashani, Beguile and Clam)<br/>

&gt; There is no doubt a TSK can solo best in EQ.  They have the harm spells<br/>
&gt; which is as good as Paladin&#39;s healing ability (no saving throw or failure),<br/>
&gt; yet they have the ability of regenerating HP ability.  I made a troll<br/>
&gt; shaman in Innoruuk for testing, at lvl 1 my first victim is a monster which<br/>
&gt; is yellow to me.  And within the first 10 min I play, I gain a lvl.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Btw, all classes always complain that they are weaker than other classes,<br/>
&gt; seem to be a norm, hehe.  I even read from the net how a lvl 40+ warrior<br/>
&gt; complained abt his char as compare to a shadowknight who is few lvl below<br/>
&gt; him - coz in term of soloing, this warrior can&#39;t handle big monster like<br/>
&gt; that shadowknight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; EQSS also have an article abt soloing - and they rank troll anything as the<br/>
&gt; easiest soloing char, esp TSK, followed by wiz, shaman, dwarf cleric and<br/>
&gt; monk.  One thing abt monk, at lvl 35+ they will jump to 2nd in the list, ie<br/>
&gt; the next best soloing class after Troll something, due to the new kick ass<br/>
&gt; skills they achieve at higher level.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Troll Shadow Knights are surpose to be good??? Come on, they level up at<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; snail place (25% pentalty for being a hybrid class, additional 50% for<br/>
&gt; being a<br/>
&gt; &gt; troll I think) and Harm touch is useless as it can be resisted.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why you hear a lot of SK complaning on why they are weaker then<br/>
&gt; &gt; Paladins.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yep, no more agnostic for necro. This is becoz too many pple wanna get<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; goodies from TSK or Necro but yet wanna enjoy good faction after<br/>
&gt; killing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hundreds of orcs by selecting agnostic (coz it help in improving ya<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; faction).  Afterall evil classes are made more powerful to compensate<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; faction hit.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dark Elf alone shld be quite easy to improve faction - Kenven once did<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; b4 as a DE warrior, by killing many orcs and he can enter Freeport at<br/>
&gt; lvl 9<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think (but some npc merchants at commonlands still refuse to do biz<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; him).  But DEN is more evil, so u will need more time to gain good<br/>
&gt; faction.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why not we create a Dark Elves/Trolls evil team, forget abt the good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; faction thingy and bash the good races city, hehe.  I read some high<br/>
&gt; lvl<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; dark elf wizards/shadow knights actually attack Freeport guards in<br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; servers (no need to find monsters to hunt, lol), sound kewl!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Btw, Leshrec also got a DEN in Prexus server.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     it seems that quite abit had happened over the pass weekend when<br/>
&gt; i<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wasnt around...  the party got formed... n stuff like that... n ive<br/>
&gt; readup<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; abit on the few websites over the weekend... i think in general... the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; necromancer has spells that spread over a pretty wide range... from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; summoning... to direct damage... to healing... that no one spellcasting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; class can provide... however this is with the drawback of faction....<br/>
&gt; so i<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guess my first char in EQ will most likely be a Necromancer... but i<br/>
&gt; havent<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; decide to make a Erudite or Dark Elf Necro ... most likely Dark Elf...<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; i think i need to do more research on faction n stuff like that....<br/>
&gt; maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; some of u guys can help me out here... esp Leshrec...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     1. is it that bad that a Dark Elf Necro is KOS in other<br/>
&gt; towns/cities?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     2. how difficult is to be able to better the faction so that one<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; enter those cities without KOS? n how can u do it?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     3. what about Eruite Necro?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Pls advice :) although i havent got my EQ here yet... but i would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like to be fully prepared fer it b4 it comes... :) hopefully within<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; week... otherwise next... as i can only play during the weekend...<br/>
&gt; BTW...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; count me in... in ya guild.... i should be in the same server as u<br/>
&gt; guys...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but i guess i will be progressing slowly... most likely i will be using<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; SilverHand. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Also, not sure about Trade Skills... anyone has any advice fer<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Necros? Also, u think it will be better to have 1 trade skills on a<br/>
&gt; char<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rather than 2? or does it matter? thats all i got fer now...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     cheers,<br/>
