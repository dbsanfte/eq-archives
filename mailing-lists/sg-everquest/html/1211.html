<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796226658">Hey guys, just to share an &#39;interesting&#39; thing I came across last night.<br/>
<br/>
B4 I met Garren and the guys for Dragoon Dirk hunt, I went to trainer hill, <br/>
hoping to get an SBS for some quick buck.  I was invis all the way, as <br/>
usual hehe, and saw this lvl 15 magi from Higher Order of Arcane, Amii and <br/>
few other players.  So I ask her is there any killing order which I can <br/>
join, she said no, it&#39;s FFA.  Ok fine then, I love FFA, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Later when a trainer spawn, everyone rush in and this Amii also nuke with <br/>
her pet, one force shock from me killed the mob.  I looted the mob and <br/>
found nothing.  Then this Amii keep asking me what lvl and I refused to <br/>
tell her.  She then start to &#39;order&#39; me to take turns.  What is this man? <br/>
 When things are good for her, she ask for FFA, when thing turns against <br/>
her she ask to take turn.  I didnt wanna refuse directly and keep saying <br/>
since she want FFA, it shalll be a FFA.  She then start shouting all over <br/>
and say I&#39;m a stealer who is not willing to take turns.  Later, Einan join <br/>
in the fun and managed to win the kill out of her, even he is actually 1 <br/>
lvl below Amii, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
This Amii is giving everyone lot of problem, and FF also told me she give <br/>
him hell lots of shit the night b4 when FF hunt at trainer hill.  Later she <br/>
even auction to offer 2pp for anyone who hurt Dvinn to almost death, train <br/>
it to her and zone off so that she can kill Dvinn for the loot and xp, LOL. <br/>
 Knn I will pay her 3pp to do it for me man.  To think she wear gossmer <br/>
robe at lvl 15, I dunno how many kills/SBS she already got after camping <br/>
whole day in trainer hill ;).<br/>
<br/>
I say, nuke the hell out of her, if anyone camp at CB, hahahahahaha!<br/>
