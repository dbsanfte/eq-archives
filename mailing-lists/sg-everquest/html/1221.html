&gt; Sereph contribute his part in complain to Wylven.  Leshrec also contribute<br/>
&gt; his part by &#39;accidentally&#39; steal from Voy :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since the anti-camp thingy, stealing is becoming a trend - and sad to say,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s mostly the case of a caster stealing from melee.  As for high lvl win<br/>
&gt; the kill from low lvl, I have nothing to say.  Afterall it&#39;s a fair game<br/>
&gt; and the high lvl dun owe the low lvl anything tat they have to give up<br/>
&gt; their chance in getting special artifacts.  H/w, I&#39;m very against stealing<br/>
&gt; even thou&#39; I myself got capability to do so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As I&#39;ve mentioned earlier, Wylven has stated his point in giving Voy a<br/>
&gt; chance to turn over, but Wylven himself is not clear as to what &#39;changes&#39;<br/>
&gt; he expected from Voy:<br/>
&gt; - No more stealing from guildmates but ok to steal from others, OR<br/>
&gt; - No stealing from anyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My stand is very clear, if stealing from others is allowed in the guild, I<br/>
&gt; quit.  It doesn&#39;t matter if any guild member dun steal from other members,<br/>
&gt; the key factor here is stealing, regardless of stealing from who.  Even<br/>
&gt; thou I&#39;m always anon (easier for me to teach the cry babes and stealer a<br/>
&gt; lesson w/o giving any trouble to the guild), I&#39;ll feel shameful if I walk<br/>
&gt; pass and pple starting throwing comments like &quot;here come another stealers<br/>
&gt; from Qui Hoon Dai...&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for cry babes like Amii, I raise both my hands and legs with Yiyang -<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; train them, steal from them (since they accused us for stealing, so why<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; satisfy her &#39;needs&#39;? hehe), and make their life like hell.    Btw I<br/>
noticed<br/>
&gt; u DO can block pple when they trying to zone pass a narrow passage.  A wee<br/>
k<br/>
&gt; ago there is this stealer name Senear at HH who keep stealing kill.  What<br/>
&gt; my group did is to block at the HH pass.  When there is a train after him,<br/>
&gt; he cant run to zone and was beaten till death, hahaha.  Then we start to<br/>
&gt; wipe all the mobs.  Later this Senear comes back, he looted his corpse and<br/>
&gt; went off, heh.  This way does not work 100% - depending on ya blocking<br/>
&gt; positions.  If someone try to block u, u can run pass them using the jump<br/>
&gt; features - but it&#39;ll still hinder ya running speed by a bit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve nothing against Qui Hoon Dai except this CB Voy.  So far I only hunt<br/>
&gt; with those pple I knew b4 they join the guild, like Ling, Megu, Sat, FF,<br/>
DF<br/>
&gt; etc, and local kakis.  One exception is Demitry, which I only know him<br/>
&gt; after joining the guild.  Frankly speaking I found our kakis occupying the<br/>
&gt; medium and high lvls in the guild.  If Wylven remain silent on Voy&#39;s<br/>
&gt; behaviour I&#39;ll support a new local guild, and I contribute 1 pp more than<br/>
&gt; YY, ie 2pp,. heheh.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I guess most of u know my stand on steal killin. I have been observing<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;stealin&quot; trend . The bottom line is usually 2 things 1) lvling-xp  2)<br/>
&gt; loot<br/>
&gt; &gt; items. Well, the others cool stuffs in EQ is often neglected. LOL  ,<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; &gt; does,nt even know whats &quot;life&quot; outside of Xp and loots.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As more player lvl upwards., prime named mobs will be the main target of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &#39;desire&#39; . there  r only a handful of named mob with special items on<br/>
&gt; then<br/>
&gt; &gt; as compared to a orc or Derv camp of 5-6 mobs. Stealin is gotta get<br/>
very<br/>
&gt; &gt; very bad. Its not goin to get any better.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; How we, an individual and as a Guild/Group distinguish ourselves is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; point here. I believe we should established ourselves as a dignified<br/>
&gt; group<br/>
&gt; &gt; of people who  stands up against unethical thievery .<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Someone like Voyerbian has no place among us. Unless he repent of his<br/>
&gt; ways.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The loud mouth type of people like &quot;Amii&quot;  is just  plain ol&#39; loud<br/>
mouth.<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; stake our stand and give this type of ppl hell. we tracked them down .<br/>
&gt; train<br/>
&gt; &gt; mob to them(ethical?) and make their life hell if need be.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ANy one of u spoken to Wylven besides Ziltus about Voy?  Qui H&#39;oom dai<br/>
&gt; aint<br/>
&gt; &gt; too bad, with almost 60 members it gives us access to a bigger pool of<br/>
&gt; ppl<br/>
&gt; &gt; to group . Wylven is not a bad guy too. BUT if it comes to the crunch im<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; u guys to have our guild. U hav emy support......  and a contribution of<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1pp.....<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Hey guys, just to share an &#39;interesting&#39; thing I came across last<br/>
night.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;B4 I met Garren and the guys for Dragoon Dirk hunt, I went to trainer<br/>
&gt; hill,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;hoping to get an SBS for some quick buck.  I was invis all the way, as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;usual hehe, and saw this lvl 15 magi from Higher Order of Arcane, Amii<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;few other players.  So I ask her is there any killing order which I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;join, she said no, it&#39;s FFA.  Ok fine then, I love FFA, hehe.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Later when a trainer spawn, everyone rush in and this Amii also nuke<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;her pet, one force shock from me killed the mob.  I looted the mob and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;found nothing.  Then this Amii keep asking me what lvl and I refused to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;tell her.  She then start to &#39;order&#39; me to take turns.  What is this<br/>
&gt; man?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; When things are good for her, she ask for FFA, when thing turns<br/>
against<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;her she ask to take turn.  I didnt wanna refuse directly and keep<br/>
saying<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;since she want FFA, it shalll be a FFA.  She then start shouting all<br/>
&gt; over<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;and say I&#39;m a stealer who is not willing to take turns.  Later, Einan<br/>
&gt; join<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;in the fun and managed to win the kill out of her, even he is actually<br/>
1<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;lvl below Amii, hehe.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;This Amii is giving everyone lot of problem, and FF also told me she<br/>
&gt; give<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;him hell lots of shit the night b4 when FF hunt at trainer hill.  Later<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;even auction to offer 2pp for anyone who hurt Dvinn to almost death,<br/>
&gt; train<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;it to her and zone off so that she can kill Dvinn for the loot and xp,<br/>
&gt; LOL.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Knn I will pay her 3pp to do it for me man.  To think she wear gossmer<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;robe at lvl 15, I dunno how many kills/SBS she already got after<br/>
camping<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;whole day in trainer hill ;).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I say, nuke the hell out of her, if anyone camp at CB, hahahahahaha!<br/>
