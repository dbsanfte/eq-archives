&gt;Yesterday I create a troll shaman and the damn troll really rock!  My firs<br/>
&gt;prey is a giant rat which is yellow to me (kill it like bu la-sa), and in<br/>
&gt;the 1st 10 min I play, I gain a lvl!  Now the other BIG problem with troll<br/>
&gt;is its evil faction.  The regenerating ability simply rocks.  If anyone<br/>
&gt;wish to start a solo char and u dun hack care abt faction (ie u dun EVEN<br/>
&gt;intend to enter other races&#39; cities), troll is definitely a good choice.  I<br/>
&gt;read that troll can STILL enter other races&#39; cities, provided you kill A<br/>
&gt;LOT of evil creature to improve ya faction - and this can take u LONG LONG<br/>
&gt;time.  I play with a gnome necromancer (lvl 10), a wiz (lvl 11) and a bard<br/>
&gt;(lvl 10) last night hunting undead spawn, the necro can solo take one spawn<br/>
&gt;while the 3 of us take another.  This show how powerful class like necro<br/>
&gt;is.  On the other hand, at lvl 10 that gnome neco is still KOS by npc<br/>
&gt;guards, he need to walk very carefully in case any guard show up and he got<br/>
&gt;to make a big detour to passby some npc huts to prevent KOS.  Imagine a<br/>
&gt;dark elf has much worse faction than a gnome necro and a troll is an even<br/>
&gt;worse faction than dark elf ;(  So u gotta slowly wait b4 u can get other<br/>
&gt;races NOT to KOS u, not to mentioned how long more the npc is willing to<br/>
&gt;trade with u.  And even if they do, never expect the &#39;similar&#39; price other<br/>
&gt;races r getting, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Btw, the first lvl 50 char ever in EQ (during beta time) is a dark elf<br/>
&gt;wizard, and he reach lvl 46 b4 the lvl 29 spells are even out, other wise<br/>
&gt;he will attain lvl 50 much faster!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve found a plain land near Butcherblock entrance which spawn lvl 8-10<br/>
&gt;creatures/animals.  One of my favorite is lowland bersilik, which give a<br/>
&gt;loot of its tongue that u can sell for 1g2s.  Problem with this animal is<br/>
&gt;tat it will stone u for few moment.  If got a tank out there who is lvl<br/>
&gt;8-10 in Faydark, I would like to team with u to kill them.  Last night I<br/>
&gt;team with a lvl 10 bard, he tank while I blast.  Thou&#39; he also get stoned<br/>
&gt;by becoz of his melee skill, he dun get much dam.  The bersilik is actually<br/>
&gt;quite weak other than its stoning ability.  I just need to blast from the<br/>
&gt;side and can kill it pretty fast.  It&#39;s quite a nice place for lvl 9~11 I<br/>
&gt;guess.  Any taker? ;)<br/>
