&gt;Just made Ziltus a master wound binder last night at skill 100.  Every<br/>
&gt;bandaging will now heal around 50HP till the target is 50% HP.  FYI<br/>
&gt;bandaging only work when ya health is below 50% (otherwise cleric will be<br/>
&gt;out of job).  Nevertheless it still great in reducing risk and downtime for<br/>
&gt;all classes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This skill is especially useful if u are a soloing non-healers, and it&#39;s my<br/>
&gt;only source of healing when I soloing.  From skill 0 to 100, I have used up<br/>
&gt;less than 3 full bags of bandages (u may use up more due to ya INT).  1<br/>
&gt;bandage is 5sp plus, a roll of 20 is 1pp, 3 full bags is 24 rolls of 24pp<br/>
&gt;only.  All u need is to spend 1 night, nuke yaself to below 50% and use the<br/>
&gt;skill on yaself.  For those who cannot nuke, u can try jumping off from<br/>
&gt;height and get yaself hurted  (try wood elf city?).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For me, I nuke myself in Felwithe (please do it in a quiet corner, or pple<br/>
&gt;start pointing u as a SM manic) and use the skill on myself.  I do it for 1<br/>
&gt;night, ard 2-3 hrs I think, and max it out to skill 100.  Once I reach 100,<br/>
&gt;I try to use another 2 rolls of bandage but it dun seem to rise anymore.<br/>
&gt; Anyone can enlighten me as to whether this skill use lvl ceiling or strict<br/>
&gt;100 cap?  Thx.<br/>

&gt;casting skills and Master in Specialization of Evoke.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;P/s: For all the magi out there, there is NO reason for not maxing this<br/>
&gt;skills with ya summon bandages spell.  For all others, be nice to magi, u<br/>
&gt;can max out this skill FOC or at a much lower cost if u have a magi to help<br/>
&gt;u out. ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;P/s: YY the SM manic can train this skill anywhere he want, since he is a<br/>
&gt;well-known SM King liao.  Probably he dun need since the bald heads got<br/>
&gt;their own self-healing skill at certain lvl.  Bards also dun need since<br/>
&gt;they got healing song.  But if u got extra 24pp to spend, no harm maxing<br/>
&gt;this skill (u can sing mana song and heal at same time, or sing and bind<br/>
&gt;wound to speed up the healing process).  When training others w/o grouping,<br/>
&gt;at least u can use this skill to heal ya trainee and reduce his downtime.<br/>
&gt; Btw, rumor say if u group for healing and disband, u will still get the<br/>
&gt;group xp instead of solo xp, not sure if it&#39;s true.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;P/s: I wonder if a bald head wanna train this skill, yet he cant nuke<br/>
&gt;himself and wont get hurted when he jump from height (safe fall skill), how<br/>
&gt;can he power train this skill?  EQ shld allow players to crash their balls<br/>
&gt;so tat the bald head, if need to play SM, can hurt themselves by squeezing<br/>
&gt;their own balls, hahahahaha ;P<br/>
