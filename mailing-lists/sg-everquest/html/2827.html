<div id="ygrps-yiv-765717640">Hi Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Hehe too bad I didnt manage to see meet u so far after I return EQ.  I&#39;m <br/>
hoping to get some lvl 50 lao jiao who has nothing to do after reaching 50 <br/>
to PL me abit ;)  Think abt last time I used to help others lvl abit but <br/>
this time round only Les and Mas help so far.  Guess the rest r busy with <br/>
the plane hunting? ;)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I&#39;m also very surprised to see pple booking date to hunt this, camp <br/>
that.  I find it pretty rediculous.  Unlike last time we can whack any <br/>
place we want (even have some KS fights with other players, still quite fun <br/>
whether we win or lose the KS fights), now I hardly see other members, esp <br/>
those high 40ish or lvl 50s, probably I&#39;m too weak to join them for their <br/>
hunting too.<br/>
<br/>
Zan, if u come back anytime, give us a guildsay spam, I kinda miss it <br/>
nowadays.  Most of the perverts dun voice out much nowadays, hehe.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I go MIA now and you come back? LOL<br/>
&gt; This list seems to have goine quiet for some reason...hmm...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway for those wondering...yes i&#39;m still alive and well thank you<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been very busy of late...work has gotten very time consuming as<br/>
&gt; financial markets have<br/>
&gt; been very active last few months..something&#39;s always happening. Also i&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; started a business of<br/>
&gt; my own in a sense...it&#39;s still only a fledgling kinda busines...mostly<br/>
&gt; freelance but basically i do hardware<br/>
&gt; assembly and computer system sales..yeah it even comes with service<br/>
&gt; hehe...yep thats it.<br/>
&gt; With my real job and this start-up combined....i&#39;m really drained of any<br/>
&gt; spare time...it&#39;s certainly not enough<br/>
&gt; time to go EQ and join in a slay the dragons night or something..barely 1<br/>
&gt; hour free a night these days.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Whatever free time i can spare usually goes to my girlfriend and yes some<br/>
&gt; Unreal Tournament...man this is a GREAT game!<br/>
&gt; Not too time consuming if you can&#39;t spare the time and yet a major <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; fun game...especially CTF games.<br/>
&gt; Anyone who plays UT on local servers pls contact me :) I use my nice<br/>
&gt; Zanderion for UT as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I might return to EQ given the time...who knows i might try ROK...not too<br/>
&gt; sure though...sometimes i think<br/>
&gt; EQ has become like a schedule...time to do this..book to do that..it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; totally non-RPG anymore.<br/>
&gt; I miss those days i could go hunt with some guys and not have to think of<br/>
&gt; schedules and stuff...<br/>
&gt; when since did knights and wizards in RPG have to book a date???? Totally<br/>
&gt; crazy when you really care to admit it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well i hope all of you are well and should anyone wanna buy a computer<br/>
&gt; system...send me a mail :)<br/>
&gt; Can give you guys some discount hehe..got all sorts of systems..high end <br/>

&gt;   Hi guys,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ve tested last night, from I login till I logout, I can solo both <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   and Ein at WK using DD and Jboot.  However, the down time is too long<br/>
&gt; (Ulir<br/>
&gt;   need 2.5 bubb mana on avaerage, and Ein need 4 bubb mana).  The worst <br/>
 </span></blockquote>case<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   is I managed to kill Ein with OOM.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Considering the long down time of mediating after taking every Ein, I<br/>
&gt;   invited a lvl 31 driud, helping him to snare Ulir for him to kite. <br/>
 </span></blockquote> Then<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   once he finish Ulir, I will start on Ein.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   This is a pretty good lvling method, as both of us enjoyed fast xp last<br/>
&gt;   night.  Now I would like to invite any lvl 30ish member who can join me<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt;   training.  I dun mind taking more fraction hits for snaring Ulir, coz <br/>
