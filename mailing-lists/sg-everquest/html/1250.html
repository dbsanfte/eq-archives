<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-997076377">It all depend on yaself.  UO doesnt have much bugs right now to explore.  I <br/>
myself also use 400k-500k to power train my GM smith.  It&#39;s also not like <br/>
last time where u can spar with pets to rise melee skills.<br/>
<br/>
Power training to a kickass player in one month is not a problem, but <br/>
unlike EQ, tactics do play an impt part in UO.  Lag is also a big issue <br/>
here.  I got 5 power-trained chars in UO, but lag also force me to migrate <br/>
into EQ.  I&#39;m now keeping the account hoping lag will improve in future, <br/>
then I will go back UO.<br/>
