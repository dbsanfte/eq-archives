&gt;2. We are totally base in Innoruuk, and have a wide range of characters and<br/>
&gt;levels there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3. Nearly all of us are part of a guild called Qui Hoom Dai and are slowly<br/>
&gt;taking over the guild. those who are STILL not in it, you know what to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4. We have people playing all the classes of the game, except<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Shadowknights<br/>
&gt;- Druids<br/>
&gt;- Warrior<br/>
&gt;- Ranger<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;5. We have people of VASTLY different levels. Lowest is now 4 highest 24.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;6. I&#39;m VERY bossy AND sadistic, so don&#39;t piss me off, or you&#39;ll find some<br/>
&gt;parts of your body missing<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;7. A webpage delicate to the list will be up soon<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;8. Hmmm, you play M:TG, interested in buying some beta moxes, older cards or<br/>
&gt;my 3 year old Necro/Prison hybrid deck..... Wait a minute, this message is<br/>
&gt;getting out of point......<br/>
