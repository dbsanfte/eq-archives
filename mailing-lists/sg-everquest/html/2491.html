<div id="ygrps-yiv-331637603">Hey tat&#39;s INCORRECT.  U only see now I solo Treant with ease but did u see <br/>
my hardship when I try to solo them at lvl 29-30?  U never know how many <br/>
times I died ;)  Furthermore, these are only &#39;physical&#39; pain on my char, <br/>
the real pain is been KOS in Qeynos regions...u know how many Qeynos quests <br/>
I need to give up? ;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway 70% of the Treants (whether green or blue) still give me xp.  Of coz <br/>
it wont be as good as other lvl 30 mobs but at least it give me safe and <br/>
steady (low) xp...better than get killed 3 times in a row and lost a week <br/>
efforts and time, hehe.<br/>
