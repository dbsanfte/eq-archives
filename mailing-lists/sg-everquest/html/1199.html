<b>Subject:</b> RE: Guild Stealer - Voyesbian <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581023185">I dun think u can get banned for stealing kills personally, but I&#39;m unhappy <br/>
to see own guild members doing it so obvious with a guild abbrev on his <br/>
head.<br/>
<br/>
I agreed with Leshrec tat maybe that Lionessa bitch know GM, but if I got <br/>
banned for such thing (esp kena accused), this game doesnt worth me staying <br/>
on.  But good news tat GMs are aware that wiz are always finger-pointed for <br/>
stealing.  It&#39;s unavoidable for wiz to nuke much faster than other races, <br/>
but again nuking is different from stealing.<br/>
<br/>
I thank Garren for his support.  As a matter of fact, Sereph and I have <br/>
launched a big complaint to Wylven.  Wylven is fully awared of it now, and <br/>
Voy has admitted his mistake on stealing from his guild mates.  But frankly <br/>
speaking, my bigger concern is when he steal kills with our guild abbrev on <br/>
his head.  I&#39;m confident that I won&#39;t lose kill to Voy, just that my whole <br/>
group is meleeing the mob that day so I dun see the need to waste mana and <br/>
Voy come in to steal.  I remember when I first meet Fiona, a lvl 12 wiz <br/>
from Higher Order of Arcane and she help me to bind and retrieve my corpse, <br/>
I really think very high of her guild.  But nowadays I see Higher Order Of <br/>
Arcane members stealing kills everywhere, I think they kinda sux.  I&#39;m not <br/>
sure if u guys agree with me, but if Wylven only restricted Voy from <br/>
stealing on others but not restricted Voy for been a &#39;well-reputatable&#39; <br/>
stealer, I think I will quit from the guild.  Knn my UO guild is so <br/>
well-known in Baja shard for been so honorable, my UO kakis will beat me up <br/>
if they knew I join a stealer guild (which is as bad as looter/pking guild <br/>
in UO).<br/>
<br/>
From what I see, Wylven didnt clarify if he restricted Voy from plain <br/>
stealing or just stealing from members.  Coz according to &#39;spy&#39;, Voy is <br/>
stealing again this afternoon in HH.  Let see what our boss said b4 I make <br/>
any decision.<br/>

p/s: Kakis like Garren shld know how sickening when his BCC is kena stolen, <br/>
hehe.<br/>

&gt; Hmm I don&#39;t understand why kill stealing will make a person kenna banned.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Just to inform all kakis that we have a stealer from the guild, who even<br/>
&gt; &gt;steal from own guild mates.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;For those who went for the guild bash in Befallen last week, some may<br/>
&gt; &gt;remember a lvl 9 DE wiz who went to lvl 3 of Bafallen at lvl 9.  Of coz, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>wiz<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;name Voyesbian.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Over the weekend, he was hunting at HH solo, and attacked some of our<br/>
&gt; &gt;preys.  But he is too weak to steal from our group of lvl 18-20, and he<br/>
&gt; &gt;mentioned he just wanna hit once to gain faction.  We have no objection<br/>
&gt; &gt;over this and we also try not to attack his prey.  He gain from lvl 9 to<br/>
&gt; &gt;lvl 13 within the weekend, which is pretty fast.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;H/w, last night while hunting at HH, I noticed he started to steal from <br/>
 </span></blockquote>our<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;group.  He no longer nuke once or twice but nuke full force to get the<br/>
&gt; &gt;kill.  FYI he is WAITING for the tanks in the group to hurt mob b4 he <br/>

 </span></blockquote>he<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;said he just need 1-3 more kills b4 he log.  The true fact is tat he is<br/>
&gt; &gt;actually stay longer than that.  He is stealing at HH, and he steal from<br/>
&gt; &gt;from another groups as well.  He steal so ofen that one players from the<br/>
&gt; &gt;other guild, Lionessa, started to make noise.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I started to observe how this Voy hunt and at one time I was even <br/>
 </span></blockquote>accused<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;by Lionessa for stealing her kill, while it&#39;s actually Voy who did it <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(I&#39;m<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;just watching with OOM!).  I&#39;m kinda pissed to get such accuse.  Shortly<br/>
&gt; &gt;Lionessa page for a GM, and Voy log immediatelywhen GM Glim arrvived<br/>
&gt; &gt;(guilty I guess).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;When GM Glim arrive, I explained to him, and he understand the situation<br/>
&gt; &gt;which wiz are always accused of stealing kills.  He also understand it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;Voy who did the stealing and I&#39;m innocent.  GM Glim then went off <br/>
 </span></blockquote>shortly.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Later part of the hunt, this Lionessa come over and drop comments saying<br/>
&gt; &gt;she have make few stealers banned by GM since she played EQ for 4 mths.<br/>
&gt; &gt; WTF?  My problem if she kill too slow?  I wanna stressed again that the<br/>
&gt; &gt;casters in my groups NEVER steal kill, in the sense that we never wait <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;other teams to hurt the mobs for 30-40% HP b4 we start to nuke.  Members<br/>
&gt; &gt;like Ling, Flyingfox, Satoru and myself hunt often but I&#39;m firm to say <br/>
 </span></blockquote>we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;gain xp with our hard work.  When there are groups of lvl 20s steal from<br/>
&gt; &gt;us, we hardly make any noise but to hunt elsewhere, so I can&#39;t <br/>
 </span></blockquote>understand<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;why cry babies like Lionessa make so much noise.  Anyway later Demitry<br/>
&gt; &gt;suggest to all group members to petition for players harrassment (since <br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;This is just a note to all local kakis to watch out for this member<br/>
&gt; &gt;Voyesbian.  Not that we are not helpful but I caution all to think twice<br/>
&gt; &gt;before helping this kinda players.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Our boss Wylven (who is unaware of this incident) made Voyesbian a guild<br/>
