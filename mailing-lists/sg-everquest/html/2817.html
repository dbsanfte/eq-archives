<b>Subject:</b> Price reduction for SCV and Magix <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760270655">According to Zhao Bao today, both SCV and Magix is now in the process of <br/>
reducting the rate for cable modem and ADSL connection, ie lower than the <br/>
current rate.  I guess very soon we will hear some GOOD news.  For those <br/>
who can wait, better wait for the new rates before going for those one year <br/>
&#39;bond&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Not to forget StarHub&#39;s broadband.... ;)</div>
