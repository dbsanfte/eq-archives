<b>Subject:</b> Re: Solo&#39;ing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110472495">Today TriFrost just started a magician Char. He finds its takes too long to<br/>
Solo-Lvl at 16th for a Shaman. I dont blame him,casters will find it more<br/>
diff to Solo when they get higer lvl. I have read that  monks too will have<br/>
some diff. when monks reach 25th. it going to be tougher. Con&#39; msg changes<br/>
again to 2 types of Green, 3-4 types of Blue msg.<br/>
<br/>
EQ being a Group game will &quot;force&quot; player to be group and team. An &quot;old&quot; EQ<br/>
monk friend name  &quot;Chien&quot; whom started off the same time as me is now a Lvl<br/>
36th monk. He been trying to avoid being &quot;guilded&quot; into a Guild. But now is<br/>
with the &quot;Apo Knights&quot; becos his regualr Kakis r in that Guild and I noticed<br/>
a slowed down on his lvling , my guess is that so he could &quot;group&quot; with his<br/>
buddies , partly also is get tougher to lvl as u go higer.<br/>
<br/>
the following parargrah is not about xp lvling is bout soloing and enjoying<br/>
killin the nasties that u like to kill over and over again. 8-)<br/>
I had tried a &quot;back-ward&quot; lvling trick(original idea) to hit nasties that<br/>
cons Green to me at 19th lvl but r Blue at 18th. I max out melee skills at<br/>
19th on the first bubble. Commited sucide and be killed 3-4 times and go<br/>
back to 18th. I killed the &quot;Blue&quot; nasties easy since my melee is max at 19th<br/>
lvl. The purpose is obviously not for xp or lvls. It for easy money and<br/>
kills. Now i&#39;ve tried this on lvl 20th it didnt work too well since i got a<br/>
new skill, &quot;Eagle strike&quot; on this lvl. When i backward lvl. I &quot;Lost&quot; that<br/>
new Skill, since  &quot;Eagle Strike&quot; is not avaible for lvl 19.Ok i have side<br/>
Tracked. sorri.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions to overcome some of the Soloing problem?<br/>
Perhaps more informal expeditions and Gatherings need to be organise, not<br/>
only for weekends but any other days. Need not be to new far away places.<br/>
Some where need by with decent loot and decent xp. Whats imporatant  is the<br/>
enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
ANy one for Paw or Permfrost?<br/>
