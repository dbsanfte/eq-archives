<b>Subject:</b> RE: [sg-everquest] Short-break from EQ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516146364">Wah liao, cancel EQ?  I thot u will come back in near future ;(<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, UO now have LOTS and LOTS of changes, giving players more controls <br/>
over their chars (eg it&#39;s now possible to make 7gms char as u can decide <br/>
which skills to lock, which to rise, which to drop etc).<br/>
<br/>
The new land is coming out, it&#39;s a mirror image of the existing land but <br/>
pvp- (ie no pking).  Everyone gonna have enuff place to put their houses <br/>
(of coz in time to come, land will get scare again but this time they going <br/>
to implement 1 house per acct per shard).<br/>
<br/>
Lots of exciting changes now, plus a party system coming up.  UO has learn <br/>
alot from EQ and given the fact that it has more RP elements than EQ, I <br/>
believe it&#39;s gonna rock!<br/>
<br/>
As for UO2, I&#39;m not putting any hope on it. If I want 1st person 3D online <br/>
RPG, I will stick to EQ.  If take abt 3rd person 3D, I will stay on with UO <br/>
;)<br/>
