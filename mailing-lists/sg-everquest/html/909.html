<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054198482">Yeah...that&#39;s what I heard...DE + Necro = KOS<br/>
That&#39;s until you get Invisibility right? That spell is on my LVL 8 rank system...<br/>
Hope you ge it earlier =)<br/>
BTW...does it make any diff in real combat? or juz the cool factor??<br/>
<br/>
Just about to make lvl 7! (Groan....still LONG way to riches/big baddies...) A few more orc centurions and I&#39;ll be there...<br/>
apparently i ran into a local cleric in G-Faydark...anyone know a guy by nick of Anthar??]<br/>
We grouped up yesterday and lingered around the orc camp..one orc cent is ok...2 is ok if each<br/>
gets one...but 3 attacking one of us is mostly Death! Guess we can never underestimate anything<br/>
when we factor in strength of numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Has any of you actually encountered probs with faction? I always attack those pixie/faerie thingies...any <br/>
negative effects with regards to impt aspects of game? (like cannot go somewhere etc...)<br/>
<br/>
Cya all!<br/>

<br/>
  hi guys,<br/>
  just wondering if anyone got a update player list? bery confusing to get from here n there leh...<br/>
<br/>
  err.. Zanderion... i think if u can made it to freeport u will certainly gain alot more than u r currently... i wish i could though BUT i think almost everything will KOS me... so gotta wait abit...  :)<br/>
<br/>
  and actually dying 7-8 times is not that much lah... since i died more than 10 times b4 i got to level 2... in fact... i die n die again b4 i even get to my corpse... perhaps i chose the wrong class to start since i think Dark Elf got a harder starting area... BUT THEN... i guess this will teach me survival in a hard area b4 i suffer any penalties... :)<br/>
<br/>
  Fred<br/>
  p/s : i think names are impt... quite an impt aspect of roleplay... <br/>
