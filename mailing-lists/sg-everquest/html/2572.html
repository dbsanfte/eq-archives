Hmm, mechical is cool.  Now I got Magic in my team, he got 90 plus mech, <br/>
use him to go around picking locks and looting stuffs, save alot of money.<br/>
<br/>
As for explosion, never use so far.  When selecting merc, I go for one with <br/>
high markmanship, high stats. My char still stuck in STR, dunno what to <br/>
train with to increase STR.  CGW say find something to hit, I try those <br/>
sparring bags in Kingpin club but cannot use them.  Can teach? ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey I forget how to climb to roof, can teach me?  During my 1st<br/>
&gt; mission I<br/>
&gt; &gt; did it once, coz one enemy on roof, but later forget how to go abt <br/>

&gt; Get your merc right up next to the wall... then click and drag up...<br/>
&gt; all the way. Only flat roofs can be climbed up onto. It&#39;s just like<br/>
&gt; changing stance... for example, when changing stance from prone<br/>
&gt; to standing, you click on the merc and drag up, you will see 2 up<br/>
&gt; arrows next to him, right? Drag somemore, and you will see<br/>
&gt; another kind of &quot;ladder&quot; arrow if you are next to a roof.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By the time the CGW article came out, I had pumped my merc&#39;s<br/>
&gt; STR and AGI to +10 liao.... *heh* I regret one thing though... I<br/>
&gt; should have set explosives and mechanical to zero... *sigh*<br/>
