&gt;       personally i think thats not a bad idea... and i will only<br/>
&gt;      move if majority does... and i think its quite hard as the<br/>
&gt;      previous time u guys try to switch... n wasnt very<br/>
&gt;      successful... anyway... do let me know what everyone<br/>
&gt;      decides... will be fun if all could shift though... my<br/>

&gt;            Hi guys,I propose that we all move to Tallon<br/>
&gt;           Zek[PvP Teams].Okay here are my SUGGESTIONS on why<br/>
&gt;           we MIGHT wanna move there.However if there isnt<br/>
&gt;           much support,I will stay in Innoruuk with u<br/>
&gt;           guys.All critisims are welcomed! 1.Guild:Okay,lets<br/>
&gt;           face it,for normal servers,Guild aint of much fan<br/>
&gt;           except of a tag there.I foresee that if a guild is<br/>
&gt;           set up in Tallon Zek,it would be much more<br/>
&gt;           meaningfull in the sense that when everyone has a<br/>
&gt;           common goal and at the same time roleplaying WHAT<br/>
&gt;           it should be[huh?A paladin and SK chatting with<br/>
&gt;           each other?].Serious roleplaying could be carried<br/>
&gt;           to the fullest and the tension when going over<br/>
&gt;           zones which WILL encourage grouping 2.New<br/>
&gt;           Server.Since its new,it would be nice that there<br/>
&gt;           will be players around to group. 3.MAIN POINT:The<br/>
&gt;           tension!This time,you would be much more carefull<br/>
&gt;           going through zones and when buddies come the<br/>
&gt;           fullest and where racism too :).Although all the<br/>
&gt;           Singaporean EQ Players would be best if same<br/>
&gt;           group,however we could have some not in this group<br/>
&gt;           so they could set up their own guild and wage war<br/>
&gt;           with us which WILL defintely improve the SG EQ<br/>
&gt;           community.If we could not be friends,we could be<br/>
&gt;           still foes :) 4.ok..high level players..ahem<br/>
&gt;           Garren...There seems to be a quest to switch<br/>
&gt;           servers though I do not encourage this coz it<br/>
&gt;           would be more fun if everyone same level. 5.SG<br/>
&gt;           Mauling:heh..Imagine all 35SG players on this list<br/>
&gt;           play same group and have a FULLSCALE invasion on<br/>
&gt;           Freeport?hehe...imagine the fun.. 6.The spirit<br/>
&gt;           bond BTW on SG players will defintely tighten with<br/>
&gt;           this..:) 7.Makes higher lv SGs get good items for<br/>
&gt;           their lower SG counterparts so our SG strength<br/>
&gt;           could be increased.[Note:Coz 300levels4s could<br/>
&gt;           maul a level50?] 8.We could have serious planning<br/>
&gt;           on what class to use so we would not be as messy<br/>
&gt;           as now... 9.We had PROBABLY wrongly configured our<br/>
&gt;           chr in the past so it would be a nice<br/>
&gt;           change 10.SGs players are now split into 2..mainly<br/>
&gt;           the highlevels and low levels..It would be nice if<br/>
&gt;           this everyone would be same level again Thx for<br/>
