<div id="ygrps-yiv-134246336">Yep, the place has good xp, but not really good loot.  Coins are good, up <br/>
to 3pp, but I dun get any magical artifacts or fine steel weaps.  Worse is <br/>
the faction msg I got, feel kinda uneasy.  So in the end hunt for 1 hr with <br/>
Flyingfox and ciao liao.<br/>
<br/>
For those who dun bother abt faction (mainly with the druids), the trees <br/>
are lvl 24 to 28 I think.  They cast swarming which is a DoT spell, as well <br/>
as AE spells (have to run away from those burning areas will do).  Most <br/>
impt is to have 2 faster nukers - we try with a lvl 26 wiz, a lvl 24 magi <br/>
and a lvl 24 earth pet, quite easy as the mobs have low HP.  2 casts from <br/>
each of us, at most, will slain 1 tree, while the pet tank.  The trees <br/>
spawn in pair, at specific location.<br/>
<br/>
Personally speaking I think they hit very hard, the earth pet always leaves <br/>
less than 40% HP after every battle and the trees spawn faster than we can <br/>
recover (mainly have to wait for pet to regain HP).  Other than coins, they <br/>
also give wood shards (anyone know wat it&#39;s for?) and light stone (can sell <br/>
at 1pp to PC and 9gp to NPC).<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested to hunt for some quick XP, here is the loc:<br/>
When you zone from NK to SK, turn left and run all the way.  The camp is <br/>
somewhere 2-3 screen from the leftmost corner.  It&#39;s often filled with DE <br/>
casters as they dun really bother about the faction.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<br/>
p/s: Anyone can suggest a good hunting ground for a lvl 26 wiz and lvl 24 <br/>
magi combo (with a lvl 24 pet if necessary)?  Places with random <br/>
spawns/trains are not suitable for us (eg dungeons), our death experiences <br/>
have tested it ;)  Preferably some camps with fixed mobs, good xp and good <br/>
loot, hehe, say between lvl 24 to lvl 28 mobs (we can get more pple if the <br/>
mobs are of higher lvls).  Thx.</div>
