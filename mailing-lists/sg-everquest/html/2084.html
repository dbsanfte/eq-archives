What is the lvl of normal treants? And any idea about lvl of this named<br/>
Trean? I think Nic and I<br/>
will really have great use for this Treant Staff as it has something we&#39;d<br/>
both want - ROOT!!!<br/>
Since both of us are lvl 24 now..if possible..we&#39;d like to get it.<br/>
<br/>
Also..treants got good loot ah?<br/>

&gt; Last night I met this named npc in SK, con blue to me.  This npc drop the<br/>
&gt; Teant Stave which has Root effect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Been greedy and impatient, I start by root it and nuke all the way (b4<br/>
&gt; others see it and start attacking it and when I get the kill call me Kill<br/>
&gt; Stealer...).  Normal teant will die after 500-600 dam nuking but this one,<br/>
&gt; after nuking for more than 800-1000 dam, is still alive!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After I OOM, die die melee with it, and most tu-long is tat it killed me<br/>
&gt; with less than 3% HP!!!  KNN!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Shld I be more patient and cast Leatherskin (give me 200HP), I would have<br/>
&gt; killed it instead it killed me, sigh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Been in SK so many times, this is the 1st time I meet this rare spawn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just a lesson to share with all - be patient and plan, or we are just<br/>
&gt; wasting time looting our corpse.  And remember server down last night?<br/>
And<br/>
&gt; how big SK is?  I die ard 15 min b4 server down and lucky managed to get<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; corpse back before server down (thanks to my sense direction and loc<br/>
&gt; skills), otherwise I cannot sleep ;P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nevertheless I still lost half a bubb xp for this fatal mistake I made -<br/>
&gt; another 2 hrs hunting in HH.  The only good thing is tat, been so moody<br/>
&gt; after the death, I dun bother to wait for server to come up and play.  In<br/>
&gt; the end sleep at 11pm plus and wake up this morning FRESH AND ENERGETIC!!!<br/>
&gt; ;))<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tonight gonna power train my wiz to 30 b4 the hunts.  I will be in HH keep<br/>
&gt; warrior room early, probably b4 8pm, till morning ;)  Die die must<br/>
lvl!!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ziltus Planeswalker<br/>
&gt; Still tu-long over the incident of letting the teant stave &#39;fly&#39; away from<br/>
&gt; his hands....<br/>
