<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630428659">Ganna tua by GM. Today, purposely wake up early, log into GM and<br/>
petition, waiting for that damn GM to grant guild status. He got online,<br/>
I send tells to him, got the generic you must petition blah blah blah<br/>
crap. Wait here wait there, a good 4 hours past, and *poof* the goon is<br/>
off duty! So now, we have to wait for ANOTHER week, before the damn GM<br/>
gets around, and hopes he READ MY FUCKING PETITION</div>
