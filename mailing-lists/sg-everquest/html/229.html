<b>Subject:</b> Healing skill for mages <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479390334">There isn&#39;t many healing spells for spell casters, esp for Wiz, who <br/>
specialize purely on offensive spells. This is actually a big bad point for <br/>
wiz.  I noticed we wiz have the ability to learn bind wound skill - our <br/>
ONLY source of self-healing.  So far I  never train on it as I do not have <br/>
much money to spend on bandages (this skill required bandages).<br/>
<br/>
If anyone train on this skill, pls share ya experience:<br/>
- What&#39;s the sucessful rate when you start to train in this skill?<br/>
- At the begining stage, I believe I will fail many times.  May I know if I <br/>
fail, what&#39;s the implication?  Does failure means heal less or the bandage <br/>
is totally wasted and heal nothing at all?<br/>
- So far I didnt anyhow use my practice point.  I think I have around <br/>
35points balance at lvl 8.  To minimise the cost of bandage, is it <br/>
advisable to throw them all into bind wound skill?<br/>
- Can this bind wound skill heal other than self?<br/>
- What is the healing effect of this skill, does it have a delay time?  Eg <br/>
some spells have range damage plus certain points of dam per lvl.<br/>
- If it&#39;s not advisable to use practice points on this skill (maybe these r <br/>
some other skills which is more impt?), how can one rise the skill fast?<br/>
- Can wiz use this skill while fighting?  Or we must quit for attack mode <br/>
to use this skill?<br/>
- What is the lvl ceiling of this skill for wiz?  3+3/lvl (like our melee <br/>
skill) or 5+5/lvl (like our magery skill)?<br/>
<br/>
Thx.<br/>
