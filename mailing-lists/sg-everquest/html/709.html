&gt; Actually EQ hunting is kinda different from UO.  UO really need battle<br/>
&gt; tactics, esp during PvP.  UO battles also have more tactics, strategies<br/>
&gt; than EQ since it may involved a big fight of more than 20 players or so<br/>
(ah<br/>
&gt; remind me of our big crash with MacRonald and his PK gang in Hythloth,<br/>
&gt; almost 20 of us fighting in the orcish room).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In EQ, u r fighting more often as a 2-6 players team.  The strategy is<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; straight forward.  Mainly - tank, buff & support.  Lvl matters ALOT in EQ.<br/>
&gt;  Even for the best PvP, most experienced player - ya chances is VERY SLIM<br/>
&gt; vs monsters which is 2 lvl above u ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since the fighting tactics is pretty straight forward, it&#39;s really very<br/>
&gt; impt, IMHO, to get xp first.  That&#39;s why I go for XP more than loot.  With<br/>
&gt; more xp and higher lvl - I have no worry in getting better loot in future<br/>
&gt; ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of coz, helping them with items & $$ is also a good way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Aiya, dun bother so much lah, make a cleric and all on the list will be<br/>
&gt; very happy, hehee.<br/>

&gt; &gt; i do agree that LKW have some good ideas on how to beat those<br/>
&gt; creatures... but i dont think they somehow benefit the low levels... even<br/>
&gt; if they managed to level up fast... it may not be good unless they can<br/>
&gt; increase their skills as fast at the same time... otherwise i think they<br/>
&gt; will have a hard time at the later stages... which is even worse...<br/>
&gt; &gt; i think the best thing one can do to help out a newbie is to provide<br/>
him/<br/>
&gt; her with some basic armor n perhaps a weapon... since those r the real<br/>
&gt; difficult to obtain stuff... n maybe help em buy spells :) well... this is<br/>
&gt; just my point of view and i aint in the game yet.... oh well.... comments<br/>
r<br/>
&gt; welcome... these r just what i thought from all those reading... n also...<br/>
&gt; im kinda flickle minded about a Necromancer or a Mage... since theres no<br/>
&gt; clear cut bout em... but i think the mage has too many pets... n they aint<br/>
&gt; they great as compared to the Dark Elf Necromancer... well... see how<br/>
&gt; lah... when the time comes... ill decide... or maybe ill try playing<br/>
&gt; both... and will decide at some stage...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
