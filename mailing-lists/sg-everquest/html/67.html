Today i met another Singaporean, living and working in Canada.<br/>
His Character name: Kiasu (no second guess here)<br/>
&gt;&gt;Hahahaha!<br/>
<br/>
Some questions:<br/>
1) do u guys save on those practice points for something later? like.. Feign<br/>
Death?<br/>
&gt;&gt;I save them, haven&#39;t touched any yet. You might want to save pts for Safe<br/>
Fall instead of Feign Death.<br/>
<br/>
2) Any &quot;spare&quot; mesh armor u guy wanna sell? (to me)<br/>
&gt;&gt;I do want some if you have extra &lt;grins&gt; You must be a monk ;-)<br/>
<br/>
3) Whats the usual time U ppl play in EQ?<br/>
&gt;&gt;I clocked 7 hours on SAT, playing a barbarian and a human. Actaully, spent<br/>
most of the time talking about crap with people while fishing.<br/>
<br/>
Ever noticed majority of us Singys are monks? Will be happy to have Entreri<br/>
the DarkElf with us. Still wonder who would play a female ogre...&lt;Yikes, the<br/>
thought scares me...my lunch is comin&#39; up my throat&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Argh! Shucks, its all over my keyboard now&gt;<br/>
