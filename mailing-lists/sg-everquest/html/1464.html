For those who would be playing on Tallon Zek.A Singaporean Evil Guild would be formed,thus only the Darkelves would be accepted[Although a few orges and trolls would be allowed].Im still trying to find more SG members before we might open to the other TZ players.Heres some info on the guild and I will post the charter soon.<br/>
Interested SG TZ players,plz mail me ASAP if u wish to be a part of the Greatest House the other races have EVER known.<br/>
