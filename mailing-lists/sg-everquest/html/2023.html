    decay,<br/>
    dont bother to read those books lah... u just use the rite components... put em into the Book of Dark Bindings... and click combine... if u suceed... u get the thing... if not... u get nothing...<br/>
<br/>
    certain books requires certain languages to read... since i never bother to read those research books... i dont know which language is for which... but i have heard some in Old Erudin, Dragon, Elder Dragon, Elder Dark, Combine(sometihng and something)... etc...<br/>
<br/>
    hope this helps,<br/>
    Fred<br/>

        Hi,<br/>
        just wanna know who plays a nero on Innoruuk and needs the level 16 research only spells? if i m not wrong, i have the following 2 spells in my bank.<br/>
        1. Hungry Earth<br/>
        2. Banshee Aura<br/>
