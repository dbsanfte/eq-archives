<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107282772">If I&#39;ve make more R&D b4 playing EQ, I would have made a magi instead of <br/>
wiz ;)<br/>
<br/>
A magi is a tank AND a mage, thou&#39; not a tank mage.  In Prexus, the first <br/>
lvl 8 I met in the 2nd day server is up are a lvl 8 magi and a lvl 8 necro. <br/>
 They just camp some distance from the kobold camp and order their pet to <br/>
guard (ie to &#39;book&#39;) the camp whole night and take all the kills, while <br/>
they sit and watch at a distance and collect XP.<br/>
<br/>
Magi is a very special class when it come to buff.  Unlike druid, shaman, <br/>
enchanter and cleric, their buffing more of a &#39;storage&#39; type.  For eg, when <br/>
a druid cast levitation spell, the spell last for some time and had to <br/>
re-cast when it wore off.  H/w, when a magi summon a levitation ring, this <br/>
ring can be given to any other chars and last until they logoff.  That&#39;s <br/>
why I said magi buffing is more of a &#39;storage&#39; nature.<br/>
<br/>
On top of that, gnome got the BEST vital and DAI points for a magi, hehe. <br/>
 But if u decide to be a high elf, it&#39;s also not bad, just that it&#39;ll not <br/>
be a power-played char coz u have to pump up high elf str inorder to armed <br/>
yaself and carry some decent loots (err, I mean loot for magery classes, I <br/>
dun expect u to carry something a warrior is carrying).<br/>
<br/>
Most important, try not to select 1H or 2H blunt weapon as ya weapon <br/>
choice, coz if u see the weapon summoning spells of magi, the best they can <br/>
summon is a magical dagger.  As a whole, I would say a magi is in par with <br/>
necro when it come to soloing.  Many pple complaints that necro pets r more <br/>
powerful that magi.  From what I read from a article written by a EQ <br/>
programmer (who himself is a magi), necro pet got higher lvl but it&#39;s magi <br/>
pet that got better stats (ops, cant remember which is which, hehe).  But <br/>
one thing for sure - magi pets got more variety and magi normally fail to <br/>
summon the right ele pets most of the time, that why their pet doesn&#39;t <br/>
fight as good as necro.  According to the author, if a magi know his pets <br/>
well, generally speaking, summoning the right pet at the right time give <br/>
magi pet an advanage over necro&#39;s most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Thou magi do not have the tap life spells, but they can summon bandages, <br/>
food, drink, phantom bag , armors, rings, lightstone, ultravision artifact <br/>
etc.  That&#39;s why I feel that they are more well-balanced for soloing. <br/>
 Sometimes I keep thinking them as carrying a provisional shop behind their <br/>
back!<br/>
<br/>
While other magery classes have to spend lots fo time earning money to buy <br/>
magical weap - magi do not have such problem.  Not only can they summon <br/>
weap for themselves, they can also transfer summoned stuffs to their group <br/>
members.  Best when the whole group just die and magi can summoned magical <br/>
weap for their melee group members to &#39;tong&#39; for a while b4 getting their <br/>
corpse back.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck creating a magi, and may the &#39;force&#39; be with u, hehe.<br/>

some &#39;hidden&#39; spells... or some boost fer em at some stages... but then... <br/>
thast a paper fer mages... so i suppose they wanted to encourage more folks <br/>
to take up as i believe there r only a small community playing em... ALSO, <br/>
i believe.. necros, enchanters, or wizard should have that kinda stuff as <br/>
well... its just a different quest... or just somewhere u have to go... or <br/>
something u have to do... BUT nevertheless... that has somewhat encouraged <br/>
me to take up the mage... instead of sticking with the necro... since u <br/>
guys r all soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo &#39;holy&#39;... i guess it will take <br/>
ages b4 my necro can venture with u guys... so a mage might be a better <br/>
choice... YES! a High Elf Mage :) any comments on that?<br/>
