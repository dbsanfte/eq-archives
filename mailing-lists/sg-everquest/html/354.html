&gt; Being a wizard, I have always wanted to play the dark side and have<br/>
&gt; always been fascinated by the necromancer&#39;s array of spells. Therefore<br/>
&gt; i have decided to make a Gnomish Necromancer in the Prexus server and<br/>
&gt; see how it goes. Being a new server, less people would probably be<br/>
&gt; there, and thus the initial xp gain should be speedy enough. Anyone<br/>
&gt; who is willing to switch servers for a while to try out the class they<br/>
&gt; always wanted, but not able to bear to leave their main characters can<br/>
&gt; always join me. )My nick there would probably be Gandalf but if server<br/>
&gt; does not allow it, then Khadgar or Leshrac. Laters! Leshrec<br/>
