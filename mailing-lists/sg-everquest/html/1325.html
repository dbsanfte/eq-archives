<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-994110695">I share the same feeling as Leshrec.  On top of the reasons he brought up, <br/>
I think Wylven start to lose control of the guild, esp the members who go <br/>
around doing bad things with our guild abbrev.  No doubt Wylven is a very <br/>
nice and helpful player, he is also very soft-hearted and sometimes too <br/>
nice to members, even if certain members misbehave.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I wanna rise my concerns IF we were to form a new guild:<br/>
1. What kinda guild is this gonna be?  A friend-friend kinda guild (like <br/>
our curren QHD and when it grows, problematic members may pop up), a <br/>
role-playing guild with certain policy and discipline (ie insist to follow <br/>
the path of good and honor, so that when pple look at our abbrev, they know <br/>
we are the good guys, this type of guild will require some formal <br/>
organisation structure).<br/>
2. Will this guild going to be a Singaporean only, Asians only or <br/>
international guild?  If we were to open to other nations players, how can <br/>
we enforce discipline?<br/>
3. Wylven&#39;s feeling, this is one of my most concern part - how would he <br/>
feel when we leave guild and form our own?  Will he think &quot;wah, last time <br/>
newbie I help u guys, u guys also find kakis to team in the guild, which in <br/>
turn helps alot in lvling, now all feather grow up liao, wanna fly away <br/>
ah?&quot;?  If we were to leave QHD and form a new guild, we must be very <br/>
careful to handle this part since most of us, if not all, still respect him <br/>
as a good and honorable friend.<br/>
4. Do we consider forming alliance with QHD?  In UO, one of my pioneer <br/>
members leave us and form his guild.  H/w we never take it to heart and in <br/>
the end we form a very close alliance - whenever TAA need help, tDw will be <br/>
ard, vice versa.  Until now, they are still our closest allies.<br/>
5. How abt those players who join QHD due to our recommendation.  Players <br/>
like Ling, Flyingfox, Deadflower, Satoru, Woodbridge etc will most probably <br/>
leave QHD and join us if I leave also.  Same for other local kakis who have <br/>
friends who will follow them to the new guild if we quit from QHD.  This <br/>
will further increase the number of players leaving QHD, at least 1/3 of <br/>
the guild, I guess.  How are we going to explain to Wylven?  I&#39;m worry he <br/>
feel very dishearted with so many members leaving at one time, and <br/>
indirectly, again, it reflect something wrong with his guild and tat&#39;s why <br/>
we are leaving to form our own guild.  We must be very cautious handling <br/>
this matter.<br/>
6. How are we going to maintain members quality and guild reputation?  I <br/>
think to avoid misunderstanding in future (most importantly, not to end up <br/>
like wat is happening in QHD now), all new members shld be briefed abt our <br/>
guild policy and direction, what can or cannot be done when they are one of <br/>
us.  This is something I did when I accept my UO guild membership.  My UO <br/>
guild has a membership application form in our guild site to fill up some <br/>
queries to enable us better understand the candidate and if he/she is <br/>
accepted, I will send the person a standard letter stating the general <br/>
policy of the guild.  For those which I find them not suitable to join us <br/>
(eg those players who enjoy pking, looting), I will also reply them to let <br/>
them know why they are not accepted and they will still be considered IF <br/>
they promise to follow our discipline.<br/>
7. Guild site.  My UO guild is hosted in Singularity, and I&#39;ve also email <br/>
Red-Dawn once abt the local EQ site.  He agreed to look into it and shld <br/>
let us know very soon.  I think some local kakis also spoke to him on same <br/>
issue b4, so I think we won&#39;t have problem getting web space.  The only <br/>
problem I foresee is who is gonna maintain the guild site? ;)  I recommend <br/>
those pple who can play when they are working (one of my UO member is a IT <br/>
operation which company let him play UO to keep him awake when doing shift, <br/>
hehe), or those players who work in ISP company, heheh.<br/>
8. Guildname.  We settle on VS last time right?<br/>

&gt;     Recently, there has been many additions to the Singapapore Everquest <br/>

considerably larger than before. Although most of us are in the Qui H`oom <br/>
Dai guild, I feel we should set up our own guild. This is for several <br/>
reasons. Firstly, it would let us communicate easier with each other and <br/>
have a sense of belonging. Although Qui H`oom Dai contains quite a lot of <br/>
Singapore players, nothing beats having our own guild since we would not be <br/>
strangers to each other. Secondly, we have seen members in our present <br/>
guild who does things which are not of our principles. IE steal killing and <br/>
being too verbose. If we have our own guild, we could maintain a sense of <br/>
order in the guild and keep out the unwanted type of players. There are of <br/>
course other reasons but these I feel are the major ones. Of course, I have <br/>
nothing against Qui H`oom Dai guild or its leader, in fact I say the guild <br/>
is wholely very friendly and helpful. Although this issue has been brought <br/>
up before, I feel this is the time we should take it into consideration <br/>
since we are mostly of rather average levels and should be able to take <br/>
care of ourselves.<br/>
