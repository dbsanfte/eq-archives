<div id="ygrps-yiv-531913812">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
Trade skills dun seem to make much now except for maybe if you are into<br/>
Jewellery but then again an enchanter would be the perfect char for it.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, probably a better way to go is to kills monsters that will<br/>
drop some reasonable loot. This will not only earn you exp but also cash.<br/>
Doing trade might earn you more but at the expense of exp unless you&#39;re not<br/>
keen to level :)<br/>
<br/>
Like yesterday I was alone for about 5 hrs at the bandit camp(not the sister<br/>
camp, the other)  in LFay . I made 50pp selling the loot from the bandits I<br/>
killed and got 2 1/2 bubbs exp at same time. Which I think is not too bad<br/>
for a lvl15 char, I guess the trick is finding the right place to hunt<br/>
without the crowd.<br/>
