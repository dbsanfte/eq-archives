in prexus it so heavely camp i went back to east karana kill<br/>
the guard better at least the faction can be fix easy by<br/>
killing gnoll.<br/>
you can also try the single spectre in feerott too, not as good as<br/>
the guard but it drop 12 pp scythe once a while n black pearl too.<br/>
if u had a druid of 35 level, u can go kill gornit in oot too.<br/>
very easy , same as normal giant but had spawn time of 6 to 8min.<br/>
in norh karana there&#39;s a lvl 40(low resist to spell) gypsis lady too which<br/>
had a spawm time 18 min, she a warrior like so easy to kill n very good exp<br/>
since she be red to u. should be able move your 35 exp bar a clicth every kill.<br/>
