<b>Subject:</b> Info needed for BB guards hunting <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319518092">My guild in CT was planning for a Dwarf hunting trip but they have little <br/>
info on the location of the Dwarves. Anyone can give me some info on the <br/>
level of the Dwarves, which place to hunt them and how much HP do they have? <br/>
Our hunting party consist of (most likely)...<br/>
30 Ogre Sk, 31 DE SK, 35 DE Necro and a 31 Halfling Druid. Druid&#39;s role is <br/>
mainly post battle healing, can&#39;t take the faction hits with Dwarves :(, but <br/>
if got no choice then will step in. Our tactics will be probably Necro draw <br/>
with Darkness, slap DoTs, Fear it and let the 2 SKs beat it to pulp. I have <br/>
a few location in mind of hunting spot. One is the stone house with 2 guards <br/>
in 1 HE merchant. Another is slightly south at the guards near the NPC that <br/>
sells leather armor. Can this 2 spots be done by the group I mentioned <br/>
above? Any info will be apprieciated.</div>
