<b>Subject:</b> Any local necromancer? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-998659398">Hmm, seem like no one is training necromancer.  I&#39;m thinking of training <br/>
one once my wiz hit lvl 8.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone play around 9pm-12am midnight in Faydark?  I&#39;m having a hard time <br/>
getting trust-worthy buddies (team with a lvl 5 dwraven cleric 2 nights ago <br/>
and he only know how to heal himself, died 4 times in a row and lost a bar <br/>
of XP before I disband, sigh).  So far from experience I can team pretty <br/>
well with lvl 7-9 cleric or ranger, coz they can tank and heal while I keep <br/>
blasting from the side.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, any one play gnome?  I&#39;m thinking of making a gnome necromancer.  This <br/>
race comes with special ability &quot;improving tinkering&quot;, wonder what this <br/>
skill does. Appreciate all advice on gnome and necromancer.  Thx!<br/>

lonely, ie solo, hehe)</div>
