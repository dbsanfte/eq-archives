<b>Subject:</b> Re: Clarification on Stealing (TXT) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587756125">Wow, this is getting interesting, we seem to have 2 different opinions <br/>
here, the nukers and the melees, hehehe.  Well I think this is really fun <br/>
to discuss on, just like the days when we used to have a PK or non-PK <br/>
discussions in UO. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I think both sides got their own points and we do have something in common <br/>
- to role play and play maturely.  YY stressed on role-playing and believed <br/>
in sharing, but not everyone we met in EQ is like our good old YY.  We have <br/>
to recognise those assholes who surface every now and then.  For me, it&#39;s <br/>
all depends on how other treats me.  For eg, I once healed a GM Mage in UO <br/>
at T2A after he was hurted by evil mages to 30% HP.  I used up most of my <br/>
mana to heal him, only to see him suddenly started to nuke me!  What is <br/>
this?  I&#39;m trying to help him and in return he tried to pk me (Dr. <br/>
AnimalLover, still remember his name, a GM mage and GM tamer).  I managed <br/>
to recall out and for the rest of the week, my guild camped at the same <br/>
spot hunting him.  He died so many times that in the end he recalled out <br/>
the moment he see any player with our guild abbrev, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Leshrec is correct that we cannot please EVERYONE.  Pple like to whine when <br/>
they lost their kills, well..not their kills actually.  On the other hand, <br/>
have u wondered why they con&#39;t to hit the mob even they knew you start to <br/>
nuke?  Simply becoz they are also trying to get the kill.  To me, it&#39;s a <br/>
fair game if both side start to attack at the same time.  Tankers will <br/>
always hit the mob 1st since they dun have a casting time delay.  On my <br/>
part, I try not to nuke the moment I see the mob hp dropping by 5%, coz due <br/>
to lag the mob may be actually dropping more than 10% hp.  Even at HH, when <br/>
there is more than 1 spawn, I always try to position myself such that I can <br/>
target on the new mob which none has started to attack.  That&#39;s why unlike <br/>
those real stealers, I always get my HP drop below half after fighting one <br/>
battle.<br/>
<br/>
Players like Appleboy, Phenix and Senear had all invited me to join their <br/>
team b4, but I never bother to even reply them.  Where got time to tell <br/>
them why I dun wanna team with them?  Afterall, it better to make friends <br/>
than to make enemies.  Simply bo chap them and act blur lor.  H/w, if they <br/>
are in trouble, I 101% will just let him rotted.  My UO vice-GM (now the GM <br/>
after I retired) Wil, is damn too kind hearted to ressurect, heal and gate <br/>
those pkers after he hunt them down, I never do such things.  For me, if <br/>
others is guai-lan, then I will be more seah-lan, make them lan-pa-pa-lan, <br/>
hahahah ;)<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to named mob, many of us have the experienced teaming with <br/>
some loot stealers who run off after they looted.  That&#39;s why I would <br/>
rather solo when I cant find good team.  It may take long due to the down <br/>
time, but I feel more better that way.  Yesterday I team with Demistry, <br/>
Megu, Ling, Fox and Ezmacro.  Other than Ez, the rest are all team mates. <br/>
 We were fighting very vigorously for kills at HH becoz there are 2-3 big <br/>
groups there.  Later the named orc spawn and everybody start to whack.  We <br/>
got the kills in the end coz we have 2 wiz and 1 magi nuking non-stop.  Dem <br/>
got the kill but he is very nice to split with the rest.  Ez make any offer <br/>
to buy it at 30pp but Dem told us someone buying it at 90pp just one day <br/>
b4.  So in the end, since Ez is good friend of Ling, we settled with Ez <br/>
paying everyone in the team 10pp each.  Now that&#39;s what I mean by sharing, <br/>
and it can ONLY happened when everyone is mature enough to share.  Try <br/>
explaining to pple like Phenix?  Nah, save my breadth to steal all his <br/>
killb better, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
I still remember the hard life I used to have as a newbie wiz - almost solo <br/>
most of the time since we have no say in a group and no one wanna team with <br/>
us except our own kakis.  We got stolen many times as well.  Until now I <br/>
still cannot forget the lvl 12 cleric who steal all my kills at G Faydark <br/>
bandit camp.  I didnt say a word at that time - I tried to nuke but get <br/>
nothing.  In the end I just walk off quietly.<br/>
<br/>
While I was in HH yesterday soloing, I was invited by 2 gps to join them, <br/>
one even has a lvl 20 enchanter in the gp.  That show tat the experienced <br/>
mature players can tell who is the real stealer and who is the nuker.<br/>
<br/>
One last point.  Pls do not forget the down time we had while mediating. <br/>
 There are more than enough orcs spawn during the period which allow us to <br/>
take turns.  H/w, due to our class nature, it&#39;s impractical for us to take <br/>
turns, esp when we are soloing.  It may take us longer time than expected <br/>
to med, and very often the other groups wont be so &#39;nice&#39; to wait for us to <br/>
regain mana and take our kills (agreed?).  Thus in reality, soloing wiz <br/>
often nuke, hide somewhere mediating, come back nuke again etc etc.  This <br/>
is the way we nuker solo.  Of coz, until now I&#39;m refering to solo nuker and <br/>
not stealers.<br/>
<br/>
I remember joining Garren&#39;s team at lvl 10-12 hunting derv and orc, and I <br/>
must say that is the most organised group (but the worst group I ever <br/>
joined is also led by Garren, at Guk remember? Hahahahah!) I ever joined. <br/>
 Even at low lvl, we managed to hunt alot.  This show that with proper <br/>
organisation, group still gain in the long run, coz nukers cannot steal <br/>
forever, we need to mediate.  I understand very well at below lvl 12, <br/>
casters, esp wiz, is not welcome most of the time, since we do not <br/>
contributed much.  There goes my old days having a VERY hard time finding a <br/>
group to join.  Pay attention to those shouting, I really cant remember any <br/>
hunting group looking for casters, esp wiz.  The only time I heard someone <br/>
mentioned wiz is when they need to bind, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Read my char profile, I called myself a CHAOTIC good wiz.  Lawful good is <br/>
very hard to survive in game or in RL. ;)<br/>
It&#39;s not our fault that nukers get to kill faster, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
The only time I REALLY steal is when someone called me a stealer - this, I <br/>
never fail to satisfy them, hehe.<br/>

&gt; Usually the player who does the most damage with one spell , usually the<br/>
&gt; magician or the wizard would get branded a stealer just because he is a<br/>
&gt; loner and has no group. Of course those assholes which are really out to<br/>
&gt; steal kill can be seen very obviously, like what ziltus has mentioned,<br/>
