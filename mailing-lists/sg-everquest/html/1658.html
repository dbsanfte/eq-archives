<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075308385">Not that locals r not united, but hard to hunt together due to lvl <br/>
difference, other than the once-in-a-blue-moon loot trips, which I guess we <br/>
all dun really wanna make tat too often.  (imagine I gate to Cazic and died <br/>
on the gate spot the moment i gate in, how to go there hunt like Garren?).<br/>
<br/>
All servers will get congested someday, and quite a few of us already got <br/>
the &quot;mid-range&#39; chars.  It&#39;s just a matter of time we can lvl up, so gotta <br/>
be patient ah.  At lvl 29 wiz get a 257 dam spell. Recently I have been <br/>
hunting in HH keep and a lvl 34 wiz (I believe he got higher than 257 dd <br/>
spell) sometime steal from my group, we also LPPL say nothing, hehe.  It&#39;s <br/>
kinda furstrated I understand, but it&#39;s part of the game.  When you are <br/>
newbie, u wanna know the lvl 50, when you are lvl 50, everyone wanna know u <br/>
;)<br/>
<br/>
So far I think Wylven has banned some misbehaved members but he is not <br/>
online at all time, so it&#39;s not easy for him to maintain 100% discipline, <br/>
esp when QHD do not have any formal ranking of higher rank members who can <br/>
maintain guild order.  I&#39;m neutral to stay in QHD or form SG guild, err, ok <br/>
lah, abit more to forming SG guild ;)  I guess EQ guild emphasize more on <br/>
team work than UO guilds, so making a trust-worthy guild with kakis who <br/>
know our communication style is impt. By now we shld more or less start to <br/>
settle down with the final char we wanna play ;)  It&#39;s a good time to <br/>
discuss abt this AGAIN.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; As we know, more and more kakis are getting unhappy about QHD, due to<br/>
&gt; the sheer number of newbies, lamers and goons there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, for this again. The grand resurrection of the SG kakis guild!<br/>
&gt; *starts to hear ppl groaning*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oi! All get a bit alive leh, and stop leaving the hall, or else!<br/>
&gt; *flashes 2 dual-bladed dicoted katanas*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good, now sit down and listen. We currently got these problems:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1: Existing goons in QHD how???<br/>
&gt; 2: Kakis not united leh, how???<br/>
&gt; 3. Server getting conjested how???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For 1, I suggest that if enough people here wishes to quit QHD and form<br/>
&gt; a local guild, we all gather at the wizard spire in NK, and get Ling to<br/>
&gt; teleport Wylven there, and we talk to him, face to face, about leaving.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2, We SG kakis are not really united as a whole. All run here run there,<br/>
&gt; rarely got chance to meet each other, and on top of that. Only when they<br/>
&gt; get drag, do we see them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. As all you people know, Innoruuk is getting very congested, and<br/>
&gt; several places are made dangerous, due to the high level people, camping<br/>
&gt; items for their friends. If a local guild is to be form, will be still<br/>
&gt; be in Innoruuk, or change to a new server, and restart anew, with each<br/>
&gt; kaki helping one another out from the start.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Finally, I have to yell this out again. WHO THE FISH HAS FREE WEBSPACE<br/>
&gt; TO SPARE!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m getting some web servers for reselling purpose and if this is not<br/>
&gt; done soon, I&#39;ll keep one of the server, and we&#39;ll split up the<br/>
&gt; maintanace fee of it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; NOTE: This is NOT that big change I&#39;m talking about. Just a minor step<br/>
&gt; to getting more organise.<br/>
