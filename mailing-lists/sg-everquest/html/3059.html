<b>Subject:</b> i would like to draw your attention to some faults in everquest and maybe we can make sony/verant something about it... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-396263028">hello gamers on everquest...<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve been playing everquest (erollisi marr server) since may 1999... a<br/>
friend playing a lvl 40 char on one of the older servers convinced me to<br/>
fork out $60 to buy an original game (why can&#39;t i buy a pirate version from<br/>
sim lim?) and join in the online fun... over a year later i joined my fourth<br/>
guild... and i also bought another copy of eq for my girlfriend (i forsaw eq<br/>
becoming the third party in our relationship... so instead of fighting over<br/>
how much time i spend on eq and how much time i spend with her, i get her to<br/>
spend time on eq with me, nice threesome worked wonders)... the first guild<br/>
(brothers of obsidian) i joined cos of another singaporean friend... that<br/>
guild sucked and the leader was really stupid, but that&#39;s another story...<br/>
well, not ashamed to say, i was kicked out of the guild by the leader (some<br/>
lvl 18 guy) without warning... like ermm, whatever... soon after i joined my<br/>
rl friends in my second guild (The Raenore) which was great... except for<br/>
the fact that they were always a lot higher lvl than me... i would go run<br/>
around with them, me being lvl 30 and them being lvl 50, it was fun but i<br/>
would never get exp... that didn&#39;t matter to me much, as i was having fun<br/>
looking at new things and exploring new places, mind you i ran solo and<br/>
explored a little from felwithe to halas when i was in my mid teens... i<br/>
hate camping and doing repetitive things like stand up, kill, sit down,<br/>
stand up, kill, sit down, stand up, kill, sit down, (six hours later same<br/>
spot) stand up, kill, sit down, stand up, kill, sit down... then quite a few<br/>
of them got bored and quit soon after kunark expansion came out (sold their<br/>
char for quite a bit on e-bay)... this was when i joined my girlfriend&#39;s<br/>
guild (Lions of Erollisi), singaporean orientated guild with members of all<br/>
lvls... nice being with ka ki lang... talk cock sing song... one night or<br/>
rather early morning while playing eq, decided i was hungry and i asked if<br/>
anyone wanted to meet up for roti prata in holland village... aeawen(druid<br/>
55 now i think) met eliza(ranger currently 52, my girlfriend) and<br/>
myself(paly 47) at holland village for some good roti prata stuff... since<br/>
then, we have had a guild gathering which eliza and myself attended and also<br/>
went out with aeawen a couple of times to sole luna in holland and velvet<br/>
underground for drinks (plural, heh alcoholic here)... recently, lions of<br/>
erollisi was disbanded, well mostly all of the guys decide to leave and join<br/>
other guilds... dunno what actually happened there... maybe some one else<br/>
might want to elaborate... most of the older members of lions and recently<br/>
myself have joined my fourth guild (Divine Grace) of which i think i might<br/>
be the lowest lvl there... when you do a &quot;/w all &#39;divine grace&quot; command you<br/>
will find that the average lvl is about 55 plus/minus and the list is cut<br/>
short becos there are too many players... as you can see the guild is big<br/>
and quite high lvl guys only... i recently spoke to one of the officer (lvl<br/>
60 i think) in the guild casually, cos i saw him outside karnor in<br/>
dreadlands... i felt belittled by him, he didn&#39;t say anything offensive, but<br/>
i generally got the idea that i&#39;m not good enuff for him... it&#39;s like i<br/>
don&#39;t drive a ferrari and have elizabeth hurley for a girlfriend so look<br/>
down on me... damn this guy might be a 16 year old pubescent piss ant with a<br/>
bunch of zits for all we know and he&#39;s judging me??? how silly do i feel???<br/>
and it was then that i felt bad for one of our buddies from the old guild,<br/>
as he was what is known as &quot;marked&quot;... damn he pays his subscribtion like<br/>
the rest of us and i think he deserves a chance to have fun like the rest of<br/>
us have... afterall it&#39;s just a game... oh and i have some strong suspicions<br/>
about eliza losing her lupine dagger... one of us got her password, logged<br/>
in and took it (not pointing fingers here)... how low can we get... apart<br/>
from all that i have said, i&#39;m sure you know the rest of the common flaws of<br/>
eq, from kill stealing to taking over other people&#39;s camps and the old speed<br/>
looting and telling the group &quot;nothing on frenzied&quot; trick =)... btw i don&#39;t<br/>
have a fbss... i have included below a fitting post of which the contents i<br/>
will not include up here, but want to say that is how i feel too... and i<br/>
hate the guild japanese guild &quot;lallapallosa&quot; or however way its spelt... &quot;<br/>
what i just barged in to your camp with the whole guild and ks&#39;ed you for<br/>
the last hour? what do you mean, i dun understand english...&quot; i&#39;m sure all<br/>
of us on erollisi marr knows this guild... oh and gm&#39;s are never around and<br/>
they don&#39;t ever do anything... eq is losing it&#39;s appeal...<br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t believe we should make eq a better place, but i believe that is<br/>
sony/verant&#39;s job... bloody hell we pay them good money for entertainment<br/>
fun not stress... what i&#39;ve written is my opinion, you may have a different<br/>
one... so flaming me is unnecessary... i&#39;m not claiming to know shit from<br/>
shinenola...<br/>

Editorials - Bullies on the Playground by Skyrain of Rodcet Nife<br/>
11/19/00<br/>
This was posted on Sony&#39;s Official Boards but has been copied here for<br/>
prosperity since we all know that Verant deletes posts from time to time.<br/>
Part One: Bullies on the Playground<br/>
This is the first in a series of posts, prompted, but not entirely limited<br/>
to, a phenomenon that has appeared on the Rodcet Nife server, (and other<br/>
servers, if the posts on the boards are any indication). EQ is by no means<br/>
the only place we can observe the behavior, but by its very nature it is a<br/>
perfect breeding ground for it. To this writer it is only the most recent<br/>
example of fundamental flaws in EQ and how Verant chooses to address or<br/>
ignore them.<br/>
Who am I? Three weeks ago I played a 52 ranger on Rodcet named Skyrain<br/>
Dreamweaver. Now I don&#39;t. The fun is gone. There had been a number of issues<br/>
that had blunted the fun over the past months, but it is the following that<br/>
finally made me realize the stress level was higher than the fun level, and<br/>
for the present anyway it looks like that will remain. Here&#39;s what has<br/>
happened:<br/>
EQ is at its core a very simple game with very simple scoring. Players are<br/>
judged by their levels and the loot they&#39;ve acquired. There is nothing else.<br/>
There are no real-world rewards offered in the design of course (Ebay is a<br/>
whole other discussion), just these measurements of status in the game world<br/>
much as salaries and Porsches are used to measure status in real life.<br/>
Verant tell us there are others ways to play the game, and other reasons.<br/>
This point of view is seemingly blind to the reality of how the game is<br/>
played by the majority of the player base. We&#39;ll explore why this has<br/>
happened in Part Four: Verant&#39;s Adventure in Wonderland.<br/>
Verant is faced with a virtual baby boom of high level players. This has<br/>
caught them off guard. They expected it to take much longer for people to<br/>
reach high levels. They thought there would be enough new players coming in<br/>
to smooth the demographics. This hasn&#39;t happened. There are now hundreds of<br/>
46+ players on Rodcet, and more achieving that level every day. Their<br/>
response has been three-fold.<br/>
1) They added an extra ten levels.<br/>
2) The have added higher-level content from individual quests to new zones<br/>
to the Kunark expansion pack (and Vellious is now right around the corner).<br/>
3) Lastly, they have done everything they can apparently think of to make<br/>
achievement in the game harder and harder. Gordon Wrinn has more than once<br/>
expressed the Verant philosophy:<br/>
&quot;I do think that players should and can trust that we&#39;ll do what we can in<br/>
order to ensure that EverQuest remains a game that people want to play.<br/>
Afterall, it&#39;s been shown that people do no like to play games that are too<br/>
easy and where there is no challenge in playing. It&#39;s been shown that there<br/>
is no feeling of accomplishment that comes, for instance, in obtaining an<br/>
item that &quot;everyone&quot; else has, or has relatively unrestricted access to.&quot;<br/>
The fact is that the challenge seems to be simply increasing the amount of<br/>
experience points needed to level, or forcing players to wait for hours on<br/>
end to get a chance at a rare drop. Remember: levels and loot, that&#39;s all<br/>
there is.<br/>
There had been earlier instances of the phenomenon I call &quot;bullies on the<br/>
playground,&quot; but it was possible for other players to find different corners<br/>
of the playground to play in. With the demographic bulge of players at the<br/>
top of the xp ladder, this has now changed.<br/>
On Rodcet we have a couple dozen guilds at least who are capable of doing<br/>
planes raids, and taking down some of the most powerful mobs on their own.<br/>
It was crowded, but apart from the isolated incident, most guilds were<br/>
getting their chances at the uber-mobs and the planes because those that got<br/>
there first had moved on.<br/>
The most recent attempt to add higher level content has been the addition of<br/>
the epic quests. Because completion of many (most? all?) of them required<br/>
loot from uber-mobs and the planes, players who had their complete sets of<br/>
planes armor and uber-weapons needed to return there for the quests. Now the<br/>
over-crowding has reached the stage that famous psych experiment in<br/>
over-population reached decades ago. The mice are beginning to eat each<br/>
other. It used to be individuals screaming over a stolen kill, or the<br/>
pre-emption of someone&#39;s camp. Now entire groups of people are up in arms.<br/>
Take a look at the message boards. Listen in game.<br/>
What has happened is this: the bullies have taken over playground. In my<br/>
next post I&#39;ll describe how this is manifesting itself.<br/>
Part Two: Am I My Brother&#39;s Keeper? (Long)<br/>
The guild system in EQ was never implemented quite the way the designers<br/>
have intended. More than one has listed publicly some of the additional<br/>
things they wanted to do. But in fact guilds have prospered. In the<br/>
beginning it was individual hunters who grouped together, found some whom<br/>
they liked grouping with more than others, and eventually formalized these<br/>
relationships in guilds. This was by design. It helped foster community, a<br/>
necessity for the survival of any persistent world.<br/>
For a long time there were very few guilds. You could do a /who all on a<br/>
zone, find 35 people (overcrowding as defined in those days!), only one or<br/>
two had guild tags. GMs met in game with guild leaders to finalize each one.<br/>
Now the situation is reversed. Most players, even low levels who didn&#39;t need<br/>
to be in a guild in the past, now carry guild tags. In fact it&#39;s somewhat of<br/>
a stigma for high-level players not to have one. They are suspect. Maybe<br/>
they kill steal. maybe they can&#39;t play their characters well enough for<br/>
anyone to want them.<br/>
As the mobs became harder and harder, guilds increased in importance.<br/>
Consolidations and takeovers occurred, much like corporations, to increase<br/>
guild strength to the point where the highest mobs could finally be<br/>
conquered. The uber-guilds were born. These were made up for the most part<br/>
of those players who recognized the only signs of status in the game were<br/>
levels and loot, and a few others who wanted the greater strategic and<br/>
tactical challenges taking down a high-level mob offered.<br/>
And as long as there was enough loot to go around there were few problems.<br/>
But the players leveled and multiplied, and soon it was relatively easy for<br/>
the uber-guilds to take down a dragon or a god. And they were doing it so<br/>
much those people newly arrived at the higher levels weren&#39;t getting their<br/>
shot. Verant responded by the level cap on those who could fight dragons.<br/>
Did it work? That&#39;s another discussion. But there was a recognition at least<br/>
that something was &quot;unfair&quot; and needed to be addressed by Verant. Important<br/>
point to keep in mind: a precedent was set.<br/>
The number of higher-level players continued to increase. Squabbling over<br/>
the planes and uber-mobs increased as well. Verant looked at their options<br/>
for satisfying players, and rightly surmised that more content was needed.<br/>
But here is where they made their newest mistake. They made it necessary for<br/>
everybody, even those who had killed the biggest mobs enough times to feed<br/>
the biggest great white hunter&#39;s ego, to kill them even more times. To make<br/>
the quests &quot;harder&quot; they made the drops less frequent. So the mobs had to be<br/>
killed even more often. I have heard it said that Verant may actually limit<br/>
the number of epic weapons that can be obtained on any server. True or not,<br/>
result? People feel an even greater need to kill those few poor mobs, and<br/>
kill them now.<br/>
And in the rush to compete with all the other higher level guilds, toes are<br/>
getting stepped on. More and more. Impassioned and bitter arguments have<br/>
sprung up when two groups have collided in their attempt to hunt the same<br/>
mob or plane at the same time.<br/>
Some guilds are trying to work through diplomacy to settle disagreements.<br/>
Two casual &quot;notification&quot; systems have been attempted: posts in the EQ Vault<br/>
Rodcet Nife Forum (a forum that otherwise resembles the magic marker scrawls<br/>
on restroom stalls) and a calendar.<br/>
Both are of limited success because the bullies, emboldened by Verant&#39;s<br/>
hands off policy (&quot;You can&#39;t reserve the planes.&quot;), simply ignore them. They<br/>
have stated that they are going to kill anything they want, when they want,<br/>
because they can. Alliances have been formed. Uber alliances of uber guilds<br/>
routinely race to kill uber mobs before anyone else has a chance.<br/>
The two systems collide. More alliances are formed in opposition. (Check the<br/>
box your game came in. Was any of this listed on the cover? &quot;Have large<br/>
groups of roving strangers trample on your good time!&quot; &quot;Try and create a new<br/>
reservation system that others will respect!&quot;)<br/>
More hard feelings grow. The diplomacy at times mirrors the playground as<br/>
well. The bullies push people around, demanding they be asked first before<br/>
others can attempt the greatest prizes. You want to play on the swings? You<br/>
wait until we&#39;re done. If enough kids band together maybe they can beat the<br/>
bullies to the swings, and their larger numbers as a group may help protect<br/>
them!<br/>
The bullies have a response to the complaints about them monopolizing the<br/>
few high-level hunts: &quot;Why can&#39;t we share?&quot; Next we&#39;ll examine the<br/>
playground concept of sharing.<br/>
Part Three: A Child&#39;s Guide to Sharing (Long)<br/>
There are two common answers from the playground bullies on Rodcet when<br/>
these issues are raised. First we have impassioned defenses for their right<br/>
to have fun. They are big and strong. Why should they wait around for lesser<br/>
guilds to get their acts together? Why should they stand and wait, not<br/>
having fun, while others have fun? Interesting philosophy. I&#39;d be curious to<br/>
see how it would play out at Disney World. Oh wait, it couldn&#39;t. Disney<br/>
governs who goes on which rides when. Even has rules of conduct for the<br/>
millions who visit every year. Nevermind, doesn&#39;t apply to EQ I guess.<br/>
The other common answer from the bullies is that since there are so many<br/>
planes-capable guilds, and so few planes, the only solution is &quot;sharing.&quot;<br/>
Interesting use of the word. It is of course an attempt to claim some<br/>
reasonably high moral ground. &quot;But we want to share! What do you have<br/>
against sharing?&quot; But what is it really? It is another bully tactic. And<br/>
here is how it works.<br/>
Ashley has been playing with her favorite doll. Her friend Brittany wants to<br/>
play with it, but Ashley got there first. Brittany is older than Ashley, so<br/>
she takes the doll, promising to share after she&#39;s had her turn. The fact is<br/>
that what Brittany has done is not sharing, but coercion. Ashley has two<br/>
choices: to wait her &quot;turn,&quot; or to plead her case to a higher authority,<br/>
someone &quot;bigger&quot; than Ashley: an adult. But the damage has been done.<br/>
Because Brittany could take the doll, she did.<br/>
We see this behavior in children all the time. What do we call them? Ah yes:<br/>
Brats.<br/>
On a plane sharing means two things: incredible lag, and the larger guild<br/>
gets the most pulls. They can recover faster, get more statics, more loot,<br/>
etc.<br/>
Is there a higher authority in Everquest? No, not really. To their credit<br/>
Verant polices certain social aspects of the game: harassment, racism, and a<br/>
few others. Of course, if they didn&#39;t, they&#39;d risk legal action. But what<br/>
about something like disputes over the facilities, the activities, the fun<br/>
stuff in the game? The policy is explicitly to NOT get involved. But wait,<br/>
didn&#39;t we mention they nerfed the level limits on dragons? Wasn&#39;t that a<br/>
precedent?<br/>
Sharing has been institutionalized for adults, because believe it or not<br/>
there are adults how never learned all their social lessons properly. At a<br/>
tennis club for example you do indeed reserve courts for a set period of<br/>
time. And if someone steps on someone else&#39;s reservation, they risk<br/>
penalties imposed on them. If they refuse to accept the penalties, they can<br/>
get kicked out of the club. Even public courts post rules, but there is an<br/>
important distinction. Public courts are for the most part free. Tennis<br/>
clubs charge dues. You pay for your fun. And part of the responsibility of<br/>
the club is to do everything it can to guarantee the fun for all members.<br/>
Everquest is not free. We pay for our fun. You&#39;d think we&#39;d have a right to<br/>
expect those who govern Everquest to take the responsibility to do<br/>
everything they can to ensure we have it. What has gone wrong?<br/>
Part Four: Verant&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland (Long)<br/>
The fact is there is a great difference between the game originally<br/>
envisioned by the designers, the game I think they truly believe they -have-<br/>
designed, and the game their player base is actually playing.<br/>
They have trouble coming up with solutions because they don&#39;t -seem- to see<br/>
the problems. It&#39;s no wonder communication between players and Verant can at<br/>
times resemble the Mad Hatter&#39;s tea party.<br/>
1. In answer to players&#39; complaints about long camps, we&#39;re told that&#39;s only<br/>
one way to play the game. Players will be disappointed if that&#39;s all they<br/>
do.<br/>
But it&#39;s the -only- way to get the best items in the game. Even the epic<br/>
quests are simply longer strings of FedEx shipments and camps. And as was<br/>
pointed out in my first post there are only two ways to measure success in<br/>
the game: levels and loot. High-level players are judged as much by what<br/>
they are wearing than any skill they might have at playing their characters.<br/>
&quot;Is that a complete suit of thorny vine?! You rock, bro!&quot;<br/>
GM &quot;events&quot; like Halloween where nothing really happens except every low<br/>
level in the zone gets slaughtered until an uber guild moves in and reaps<br/>
the drops. I was intrigued by Absor&#39;s admission that he likes being a<br/>
victim. Bill Troost&#39;s defense of the player as victim as part of the<br/>
&quot;story-telling was equally illuminating. There&#39;s a word for people who like<br/>
to be victims. It&#39;s called masochism.<br/>
You REALLY think people are paying you their money to be VICTIMS? Not<br/>
heroes? But VICTIMS? Ignoring Joe Campbell, Tolkien, every action/adventure<br/>
film ever made, all tabletop RPGs and MUDs, Psychology 101, and god knows<br/>
what else, simply to try and defend an event structure that had not improved<br/>
one iota on the Halloween &quot;event&quot; from a year before? I guess you can&#39;t<br/>
really learn from mistakes, if you don&#39;t see you&#39;ve made any.<br/>
3. The recent comments in response to casual players is a perfect example of<br/>
how they fail to recognize the importance of the other game scoring device:<br/>
leveling.<br/>
I&#39;ve talked with a great many game designers. To a one all understand that<br/>
&quot;waiting&quot; as a game dynamic is a terrible thing to design into your game.<br/>
Yet it is at the core of the &quot;challenge&quot; in Everquest. Enforced boredom (You<br/>
want that Testament of Veneer? You wait.) brought on by static camps from<br/>
the lowest &quot;quest&quot; item to the highest uber-mob is a fundamental aspect of<br/>
the design of the game.<br/>
How can casual gamers possibly hope to compete for these drops. And who is<br/>
Verant to suggest that they&#39;re playing the game wrong if they even expect<br/>
to?<br/>
Yes, EQ HAS turned its back on casual gamers. Of course it has. And of<br/>
course they&#39;re penalized by the narrowness of what it means to &quot;advance.&quot;<br/>
The designers have been mesmerized by the hard core gamers, and their<br/>
demands for more and more. The baby boomers want their toys. And EQ has no<br/>
more ways to respond than make more items available, make more camps and<br/>
longer ones.<br/>
What the epic quests would do to competition among the higher levels for the<br/>
few resources should have been obvious. Gordon Wrinn should not have been<br/>
allowed to announce publicly how all the quests were working, and the long<br/>
time it took to design each one. How do these things happen? Here&#39;s one<br/>
possibility:<br/>
How many &quot;designers&quot; does Verant have working on Everquest? At times they<br/>
seem to outnumber Q&A.<br/>
I&#39;m reminded of a cartoon an artist friend had posted above his desk. It<br/>
showed a classically stereotypical artist complete with pointy beard, beret,<br/>
smock, palette and brush, poised before a blank canvas on a tripod. He is<br/>
standing at the end of a long table lined with men in suits. The caption<br/>
was: Art by Committee. Now, whether EQ is art or not is not the issue. But<br/>
the fact is that committees rarely manage to make ANYTHING great or<br/>
enduring. The Porsche was not designed by a committee. &quot;Hamlet&quot; was not<br/>
written by a committee. Neither was &quot;MULE&quot; for that matter.<br/>
One person can have a vision certainly. Two? Of course: Sid Meir and Bruce<br/>
Shelley. But every time you add another pair of eyes the vision starts to<br/>
blur. Without a guiding hand to hold all of the threads, and tie up all of<br/>
the loose ends, visions unravel. And what started out to be a sweater looks<br/>
more like an ever-growing expanse of patchwork.<br/>
The epic quests? Each one done by a different individual who apparently had<br/>
lost the telephone extension and email of all the others.<br/>
One final chapter will plant a signpost at the beginning of a route out of<br/>
Wonderland.<br/>
Part Five: Are we having fun yet? (Long)<br/>
Is addiction fun? Only part of the time.<br/>
What could Verant do about the fundamental problems of EQ, if they could<br/>
wake up one morning to a satori, and discover there ARE problems?<br/>
Well, they could take the road they have in the past. Deny there&#39;s a<br/>
problem, then scurry to address it in the next expansion (Trying in Kunark<br/>
to reduce those static spawns that are &quot;only one way&quot; to play the game for<br/>
example.) Then address it by adding more of the same. Higher mobs, higher<br/>
weapons, the need for 50 people to kill one thing instead of forty,<br/>
increasing rarity of drops. It is a game after all of levels and loot,<br/>
remember? If there were anything else to EQ, their solutions would address<br/>
it, wouldn&#39;t they?<br/>
I repeat: there is a great difference between the game originally envisioned<br/>
by the designers, the game I think they truly believe they -have- designed,<br/>
and the game their player base is playing.<br/>
Until some recognition of that occurs, don&#39;t expect anything approaching a<br/>
legitimate solution.<br/>
Wonder why they demographics are so skewed to the high end? The mantra we<br/>
hear chanted in the halls of Verant most often in the face of criticism is<br/>
that now there are over 300,000 registered players of EQ. More than AC or<br/>
UO, yes. But it&#39;s such a drop in the bucket of internet users, even internet<br/>
gamers, I&#39;d be embarrassed. And remember how long ago they announced that<br/>
first 200,000? And how long it took to get half of that this time? Do a<br/>
graph. Would you buy that stock?<br/>
The fact is that even the hardcore are getting restless, and there are<br/>
promising competitors emerging on the horizon.<br/>
So what are we left with in the meanwhile? More and more loot? More and more<br/>
waiting? And at the end a higher end game where the players are forced to<br/>
govern themselves like some teeming crucible of democracy disguised as<br/>
entertainment.<br/>
What about that signpost to a solution? There are two parts:<br/>
First, stop being defensive. As hard as that might be. Stop it. Stop blaming<br/>
your player base. Gordon Wrinn:<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s a bit depressing. On one hand we have a ton of players asking for more<br/>
GM interaction within the game, more quests, better stories, etc., and on<br/>
the other we have the hecklers who scream any time we make an attempt to<br/>
drag them away from their 4 hour stop-watch campfest that they complain<br/>
constantly about.<br/>
.There are many dynamic quests, and contrary to popular belief they usually<br/>
entail something beyond GMs just running out and killing everyone. If people<br/>
would take a second before nuking the central character, maybe they&#39;ll find<br/>
out what it is all about.&quot;<br/>
There was also a sad quote from one of the &quot;designers&quot; at the recent launch<br/>
party. I wish I could find it now, but basically he was insisting there was<br/>
a full, rich storyline in Everquest, and that people were simply failing to<br/>
uncover it. This is such a page from the amateur writer&#39;s scrapbook, it<br/>
needs to be mentioned. Successful writing is 1) inspiration and talent and<br/>
2) the ability to present the work to the audience so that it can experience<br/>
it. If you fail at number two, one is meaningless. Stop blaming your<br/>
audience if they don&#39;t get it!<br/>
People are simply playing the game you designed. If it isn&#39;t the one you<br/>
wanted to design, or thought you designed, then change it.<br/>
If you truly feel that the calendars and scheduling conflicts are immersing<br/>
players even more in the world of Norrath; if you truly feel the bullies<br/>
have a right to their fun more than others simply because they are bigger<br/>
and stronger; if you truly feel the uber-guilds should have fun at Halloween<br/>
events while lower level characters get to play victims; if this truly -is-<br/>
the vision, then sit back, and let the good times roll.<br/>
But if you suspect there may be serious problems, and you can get beyond<br/>
blaming your customers, start accepting responsibility. Re-examine the<br/>
design openly. Trust your players a bit more. If you play black box<br/>
management of your player base (&quot;Epic quests are all working.&quot; &quot;No problems<br/>
with rangers.&quot;), when you finally do try to improve something, you shouldn&#39;t<br/>
be surprised you get more backlash than thanks.<br/>
And govern the world you have created. Everquest is not a free public<br/>
playground. People pay money to play here. It is not their responsibility to<br/>
ensure that all players in the playground have fun. It is yours.<br/>
Believe it or not there is much that I find fine and entertaining and<br/>
beautiful about Everquest. I would have not spent the past three weeks<br/>
researching and writing this, if I didn&#39;t mourn what EQ could have been.<br/>
Might be. But it is a flawed gem, and it is fracturing along the fault<br/>
lines.<br/>
Is Everquest fun?<br/>
Not anymore. Not for Skyrain. Not at level 52. So he asked me to write this<br/>
to try and express his frustration and sadness. I hope I have in some small<br/>
way done him justice.</div>
