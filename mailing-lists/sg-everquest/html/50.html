<div id="ygrps-yiv-513755438"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; From: &quot;Wilson&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ritzbits@...">ritzbits@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I was in a guild but op-ed out cos I don&#39;t like planned schedules etc.<br/>
&gt; Freedom for me, I&#39;d say.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hehe, my guild dun have much planned schedules, I basically leave it to the <br/>
timezone commanders (US/Canade & Asia Pacific) to oragnize activities. <br/>
 Even the daily server war is just an unofficial events which there is no <br/>
hard and fast rule for members to attend.  As for guild meeting, we hope as <br/>
many members can join as possible, but we expected much lesser coz members <br/>
come from all timezone, hard for them to login at certain time.  That&#39;s the <br/>
main reason why we have timezone commanders, so that when the local <br/>
pioneers not online, other trust-worthy members can lead the guild ;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; took long to save up...not to mention what was in my chests etc! Now to<br/>
&gt; EQ...<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah I understand...if I lost my main houses, most probably I will quit too. <br/>
 It&#39;s a 2-S & small smithy blocked by mountain, build more than a yr ago. <br/>
 I got my own mining space which no one else can enter.  Even bug users <br/>
can&#39;t break in as they cannot even reach my door steps.  In house got 20 <br/>
over bags of GM assasin poisoned GM smith weapons/bows, more than 15 bags <br/>
of magical stuffs (1/3 is silver), 10 over vanq weap, 20 over bags of GM <br/>
alchemist potions (2/3 are GH and GE), &gt;5k reg each, tons of house add-on <br/>
deeds etc etc.  Even though I got 3 over million worth of GPs in bank (coz <br/>
of house deeds), if I kena looted, also very sian to restart everything and <br/>
go around buying/making the stuffs again...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in a slot to make it have more space since a bag itself has 4-8slots. So <br/>
 </span></blockquote>max<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is 8x8 = 64 slots. To transfer items amg chars, it like UO, drop is in a<br/>
&gt; secluded place then pick it up before it vanishes. Or just do Friend to<br/>
&gt; Yourself.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, so no house to store stuffs.  Can misc items (like potions) be stacked? <br/>
 I presumed it will then required 1-2 mules to act like storage house? ;) <br/>
 Or there are much lesser stuffs in EQ that i dun need much storage space?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;Why the MSG Board since we already have this list? Pardon me...<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Msg board allowed everyone to read and leave their msg, and it can store <br/>
much more stuffs unlike email which once u deleted, it&#39;s gone fast.  Also, <br/>
sometime several pple replies to one query and the msg roll big very fast. <br/>
 For eg, if I start a topic asking which server to start off, many players <br/>
will reply to this list and the topics may end up several emails.  But in <br/>
msg board, it&#39;s more organised.  We used to think of starting a mailing <br/>
list for guild, but end up with 2 msg boards coz members find it easier to <br/>
communicate.  Anyway it&#39;s just a supplement to this mailing list, not a <br/>
replacement ;)<br/>
