Subject: [sg-everquest] MIA: My long and naggy CR experience :(<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Got a very very bad day on Fri night, ops, Sat morning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Was hunting in Unrest with DF, he was helping me with the Acumen Mask<br/>
&gt; quest.  We took in 2 newbie healers, and the hunt supposed to end quite<br/>
&gt; early but one of the 2 healers was a damn CCB looter.  Already told them<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; advance they can get all the loot except the NO DROP, worthless darkbone<br/>
&gt; skull (while DF get some xp), yet this KNN idiot go and loot the 1st<br/>
skull.<br/>
&gt;  In the end no choice, hunt longer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Shortly after I got the skull, I stayed back with DF, hoping to get him a<br/>
&gt; BS tunic to sell, thanks for his companion and help.  While standing on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; fountain, suddenly my screen turned blue!  I tried all means to close the<br/>
&gt; blue screen (infamous win9x GPF) but system simply hanged.  No choice, so<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; turned off my PC and turned it on again.  When I rebooted, win98 did it<br/>
&gt; normal scandisk and this time it showed many corrupted files, crosslinks<br/>
&gt; etc.  No choice, I get all of them fixed.  Just before it reached the<br/>
win98<br/>
&gt; desktop screen, system halted again!  I kept trying to load my PC and the<br/>
&gt; same old thing keep coming back - files/directory corrupted and system had<br/>
&gt; to rename file/directories...until a stage it renamed my win.com file!!!<br/>
&gt;  Damn PC finally down as it can&#39;t even load it&#39;s win98! I struggled for 2<br/>
&gt; hrs (till 6am in the morning) and gave up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The next time, Sat, the saga continued.  Again I tried to boot from CDrom,<br/>
&gt; FDD etc but system simply dun worked.  In the end I selected boot from<br/>
&gt; win98 CDrom and reinstall win98.  Still got file errors during scandisk<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; I managed to install my win98.  Next I went on to install all drivers<br/>
&gt; etc...damn...pc lock-up again.  When I rebooted...scandisk got error, fix<br/>
&gt; file and rename...the same old cycle con&#39;t.  Everytime it scandisk, it<br/>
&gt; found more corrupted and crosslinked files (and it renamed more files just<br/>
&gt; to fixed them).  I kept on scandisk, reinstall win98 until I fall asleep<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; front of my PC (wake up and 6am Sunday and realized the damn thing still<br/>
&gt;  scandisking!!!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the end, Sun morning....gave up.  Try my very best to retrieve my data<br/>
&gt; using dos prompt but still lost many important files.  Some files, like<br/>
&gt; ICQ/DB/*.* files, all got cut-short becoz the filename &gt; 8 chars and dos<br/>
&gt; prompt can only copy max 8.3 files.  Anyway no choice.  Ard noon time,<br/>
&gt; completed data CR mission.  Becoz of so many corrupted and crosslink<br/>
files,<br/>
&gt; I decided to reformat my HDD thoroughly, by using LOW-LVL formnat!  The<br/>
&gt; format (8.4GB hdd) took me so long....from noon to night 10pm plus!!!<br/>
&gt;  After that, I spend like 3 hrs reinstalling all my drivers, ISP, MS<br/>
&gt; office, EQ (included patching online) etc.  By the time I finally patching<br/>
&gt; EQ, already 1am plus.  Login EQ just to get my char out of unrest (heng,<br/>
&gt; still alive, hehe).  Sigh, dun even got time to install UO (UO got longer<br/>
&gt; online patch than EQ).  Maybe tonight I will con&#39;t with my PC CR mission<br/>
;(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All my The Sim goodies are gone (gotta re-train my &#39;perfect-skilled&#39;<br/>
sims),<br/>
&gt; my chars and treasures found in BG and GB expanion, my UO and EQ<br/>
&gt; macro/hotkey list etc....sigh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I know the importance of HDD backup.  Anyone got any good CDRW machine<br/>
&gt; to introduce?  Shld I get internal or external one?  I dun think I can<br/>
&gt; afford SCSI, so any EIDE or parallel port version is good enuff.  Pls<br/>
&gt; recommend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p/s: Died by DROWNING (in DC) while trying to do the ice comet quest.  How<br/>
&gt; long can mage&#39;s water stone last?  Maybe someone can summon me a few when<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; do the quest again this or next week.  Ouch, also dropped lvl...gotta go<br/>
&gt; back kill dwarves again, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ziltus, the real CR man!<br/>
