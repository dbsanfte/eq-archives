<div id="ygrps-yiv-81542227">1. Mailing list is good.  Maybe we can consider if msg board can do the job <br/>
better?  Esp a password protected one to prevent other retarded goons <br/>
anyhow jump in.<br/>
<br/>
2. FF got web space, but it&#39;s his personal&#39;s.  I wonder what if we get <br/>
those free space from some webspace provider?  Singularity boss Red Dawn <br/>
also mentioned a EQ space reserved for us.  I guess we just need to get <br/>
from him.<br/>
<br/>
3. Appoint one Events Officer for each 10-lvl categories.  At least one lvl <br/>
guild hunt per fortnight?  Eg Lvl 30-40 Event Officer to organise at least <br/>
1 lvl 30-40 guild hunt once every 2 weeks.  He can also &#39;arrow&#39; another lvl <br/>
30-40 kakis to do the organisation once a month (ie 2 events per month, <br/>
officer must organise one of the 2 events, the other he can assign other <br/>
lvl 30-40 kakis to organise).  Best is each one in the lvl category has a <br/>
chance to organise.  Everyone must contribute mah, right? ;)<br/>
<br/>
4. Kakis Heritage System<br/>
If any kakis found an artifact which he dun bother to sell or none of his <br/>
chars can use it, he can pass to another kakis who can use it.  Say Garren <br/>
found a Thug robe which he or his other chars can&#39;t use, and he dun bother <br/>
to sell.  In the end he gave to Ziltus.  Later when Ziltus got a Goss robe, <br/>
he is NOT supposed to sell the Thug robe for his own benefit.  Instead, he <br/>
pass it to FF.  Now FF got a FBR, he will then pass the Thug robe to the <br/>
next kakis who can use it.  This way we can practice kakis heritage system <br/>
which will benefit more kakis.<br/>
<br/>
Contribution welcome.</div>
