<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042607216">wah Wisp is minor monster. I can only kill wisp safely by 10 lvl and<br/>
that means with maybe 1 to 2 bubble of hp left. Wiz spells really good man.<br/>
Or is the wisp at Felwithe easier?<br/>

&gt; I come across players selling mana rings at 5pp in Felwithe.  I got a<br/>
&gt; cutthroat ring from Leshrec (thx, hehe).  That&#39;s my only magical item so<br/>
&gt; far, +1ac and +2 dex.  Can u tell us what&#39;s the stats for Dervish ring?<br/>
&gt;  Also, mana ring is generating 5mana/sec or what?  What u mean by &quot;5<br/>
sec&quot;?.<br/>
&gt;  Is is advisable to buy for a char with 40 mediation skill?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, managed to earn a lvl with the help o fa lvl 10 Hong Kong cleric<br/>
&gt; last night at bandit camp in GF.  I&#39;ll be meeting him again tonight for<br/>
&gt; hunting again.  Hopefully I can make it to lvl 8 and earn new spells.  Any<br/>
&gt; recommendation for wiz&#39;s armor?  So far I&#39;m wearing lousy clothings only,<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t survive too long with low AC.  Not aware of any better armors which<br/>
&gt; are available for wiz (still new, no chance to see yet, hehe).  I&#39;m saving<br/>
&gt; money for a great staff but the price is damn (*#$@ expensive - 20pp!!!  I<br/>
&gt; think when I reached lvl 8, the money in my bank is not even enuff for me<br/>
&gt; to buy all the new spells, sigh.  Maybe I have a spend a night hunting all<br/>
&gt; minor monsters like wisp, skeleton and bat, no xp gain but at least can<br/>
&gt; loot stuffs to sell (waste of time sia!).<br/>

&gt; &gt; ManaRings go for about 12pp at my side. The cheapest I ever saw was 9pp.<br/>
&gt; However, they give only +5mana? Those a nurfed and a super-rip-off!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would recommend other rings instead....prolly the Dervish Ring. Or the<br/>
&gt; Cutthroat Insignia Ring.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My two cents,<br/>
