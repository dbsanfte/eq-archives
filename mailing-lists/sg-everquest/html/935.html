<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299893925">I think for all skills, even if u fail, you will still gain some <br/>
&#39;practicing points&#39; which will be contributed to ya skill points in the <br/>
r/l.  I also noticed that you dun need to allocate a skill point to any <br/>
skill to start training it.  I&#39;ve testing with my magery skills and <br/>
brewing.  I just practise them and they all start to rise from skill 0 to <br/>
skill 1.  I guess as long as u see the skill on ya persona skill list, you <br/>
can train it from zero.  Maybe u just need to use up abit more material. <br/>
 As for brewing case, my skill rise to 1 even I fail the 1st time I brew.<br/>
<br/>
As for the mob link, I think it&#39;s quite true.  I used to bind myself after <br/>
zoning into NRo at the tunnel exit until one day I kena hit by a thug. I <br/>
managed to gate out b4 mana run out.  I gate to the tunnel exit and sit <br/>
down to mediate.  All u guys know how far it is from mountain derv camp to <br/>
tunnel exit.  H/w, within few min the thug come all the way to me, and kill <br/>
me b4 I can run to zone.  Same thing happened in WC b4, where I was binded <br/>
at inn 4 and chased by lion near inn1.  I managed to gate to inn 4 with oom <br/>
and 50% hp, only to find out the lion chase all the way from inn 1 to inn 4 <br/>
for my ass.  As per normal, a weak wiz was killed....<br/>
<br/>
I think the only way to &#39;run&#39; away from it is to:<br/>
- zone<br/>
- death (not feign death)<br/>
- kill the monster b4 it kill u.<br/>
<br/>
Once thing that surprised me, YY u can kill SG at ya lvl?  Wowo!  Tat day I <br/>
join the SG hunt, 20 over of us, including few lvl 20s and a lvl 30 wiz. <br/>
 Took us few min to take it down.  Forget abt the shit that some players <br/>
said they gain LOTS of xp when if they managed to whack the SG once.  All <br/>
bullshit.  Only the party that kill it gain all the XP and only the looter <br/>
get all the loot - chance is that they dun share too.  So dun kena con by <br/>
the SG hunting groups, hehe.  Even as a lvl 16 wiz, SG resis ALL my spells.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have always be wondering about the following.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) I have 12 skills points on Bind wound. My current lvl caps is 105.<br/>
&gt; Knowing that Bind wound will be effective if HP is 50% below. Let say I <br/>
did<br/>
&gt; a Bind wound above 50% hp , a msg pops up and  tells me its not working <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; i usedup a Bandage. The question is DID i contribute some factor to <br/>
increase<br/>
&gt; the Bind wound skill or its just wasted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) I have a new Skill. eg: Eagle Strike. I go to Monk Guild to put 1<br/>
&gt; practice point in it. Configure a hot key . Go to a zone and hunt <br/>
Nasties,<br/>
&gt; Eg: orcs, Gnolls, Wiz, bears, etc,,(oops, not the wiz.. soorri, maybe<br/>
&gt; Paladin...hmm..maybe not. hehehe)<br/>
&gt; NOW, I con a nasties Orc for BLUE. I use eagle strike..It misses..Hit<br/>
&gt; again..1 hit.. hit again missies. THE question. DID the missed hits<br/>
&gt; contribute to any factor of Increase to the Eagle Strike skill <br/>
overtime????<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3)Eagle Strike skill again. This time I con a Orc for Green. I use new <br/>
Eagle<br/>
&gt; strike to hit it. It hits for 8 Damage...hit again 5 Damages. I keep <br/>
killing<br/>
&gt; Greenies but skill doest seem to go up. Or does it??????. I know that <br/>
KiIlin<br/>
&gt; Blue nasties up the skills ,what about greenies?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4) Was at the oasis yesterday. A Sand Giant was chasing a guy. I was at <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; 1st pillar. The Guy ran toward me. THe SG follows behind. SG went INTO <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; WATER!!!!. Hit the guy bad. he died. SG look at me !. I smile. Wave. Says<br/>
&gt; Hello! Bow, offer him Freddy as a Sacrifice and  it still  hits me for 48<br/>
&gt; damages. I did  a Feign Death. It stop hitting me. It hovers around my <br/>
fake<br/>
&gt; corpse for a while b4 going away..whew..<br/>
&gt; NOW.. I looked around no SG . very the safe liao. Got up and went over to<br/>
&gt; near 2nd Pillar. Use a Shrikens to lure a DWC. I fight Crocs till its <br/>
Almost<br/>
&gt; die. From the horizon I see a BIG Black Shadow coming towards me. i Con <br/>
it.<br/>
&gt; Its a SG!.its far..np. looked at it again. It getting closer. I didnt see <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; was chasing anyone. It came straight at ME!. I ran.It hits me. I feign<br/>
&gt; death. it goes away. i got up. After a while the SG appear from a Sand <br/>
Dune.<br/>
&gt; I didnt see it  this time. It hits me bad. I feign death. Failed.. I <br/>
died!<br/>
&gt; &^%$%$#%@.<br/>
&gt; QUESTION: SG Gunning me down! WHY???? it has a &quot;link&quot; on me since i Feign<br/>
&gt; death??? lotsa ppl saw it and says my FAction was low with SG. Ya sure. I<br/>
&gt; killed hundreds of SG alreadi. :P .Some says i Killed it Baby <br/>
SG...hmm......<br/>
&gt; Maybe, becos of the Parang Sereph lompang to me, parang got some smelly<br/>
&gt; blood from last ritual Sereph did on Einan. I tellin u , Sereph is NOT<br/>
&gt; well.Trifrost, Garren , Leshrec  and Zitus should have a good talk with<br/>
&gt; her/him/it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok long questions. Give me good short answers please.<br/>
