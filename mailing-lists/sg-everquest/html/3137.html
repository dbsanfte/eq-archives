&gt; &gt; I do not know about the other servers, but we are still going <br/>
strong on <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Innoruuk server (Avanguardia). Anyways, I encourage that you <br/>
switch <br/>
&gt; servers<br/>
&gt; &gt; to one of the other servers Kaen mentioned since theres a larger <br/>
&gt; singaporean<br/>
&gt; &gt; player base there. Just send a tell to Leshrec if you need help <br/>
or <br/>
&gt; anything<br/>
&gt; &gt; if you ever come to the Innoruuk server.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; P.S. Theres are quite a few people in Silvermoon lan shop (Tiong <br/>
Bahru<br/>
&gt; &gt; plaza) who plays everquest in our guild so feel free to drop in <br/>
and meet<br/>
&gt; &gt; some of our members ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; No Offence Kelvin but most of us here are lvl 50+ players<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and very bored people (most of which have NO life whatsoever) .<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If u want to find a server with lots of Singaporeans<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; head down to Erollisi Marr , Lanys T&#39;&#39;vyl or Innoruuk<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For those who are near freeport,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;go to desert of ro through freeport.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;there is an inn very near to the zone area that sells<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;large sewing kit.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;most of the other places selling this are far away<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I have heard from other boards that each of this can sell 5pp-<br/>
10pp<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;most people are lazy to find it or too low level to travel far.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I am trying it at my server i hope this work :P<br/>
