<b>Subject:</b> SG guild formation, speed up part III <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233756675">It is thereby agreed that Ziltus, Leshrec, Trifrost, Garren, Yiyang and<br/>
a certain &quot;flat chested&quot; bard will be officer for the SG guild. You<br/>
CAN&#39;T deny your duty, unless 5 other person agree that you make a terok<br/>
official.<br/>
<br/>
Ziltus and Leshrec will be in charge of Erudin and Faydark area<br/>
<br/>
Tri for Everfrost area when he return. In the mean time, my bard will be<br/>
taking charge of recruitment in this area and Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
Garren and YY will be in charge of recruitment in the FP area<br/>
<br/>
Now on name. The last time, we agreed on Valiant Saint. By 12:00 am<br/>
tonight, if no one objects, this will be the final name our kaki guild.<br/>
<br/>
Nomination for guildmaster, saboh away! If you thick skin want to<br/>
norminate yourself, also can. Those not in the official list and want to<br/>
be guildmaster or official, also can, just submit your name and let us<br/>
debate.<br/>
<br/>
We must get this done by tomorrow, 8pm.<br/>
<br/>
Guild charter, I volunteer to write it. Will be up by tonight if I can<br/>
resist logging into Cazic(Need lvl 50......) It might be more sappy than<br/>
Titanic, so please tahan, even if you can&#39;t stand it.<br/>
<br/>
Guild guidelines: This is a temporary ver of our guidelines, add your<br/>
comments.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, only one is agreed on. NO KILL STEALING OF ANY KIND!!! If we<br/>
come to knew that you have done such a thing, you will be suspended from<br/>
the guild for 2 weeks, to carry out investigation. This is a very severe<br/>
offence in my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Other stuffs:<br/>
<br/>
A guild bank will be set up, and 2 goons will be put in charge of this.<br/>
I propose Einan and Kellendil to be incharge since they are quite &quot;on&quot;<br/>
and trustworthy.<br/>
<br/>
How thiis bank work is like this: Each RL week. this 2 person, will go<br/>
around, collecting money from everyone in the guild, with the help of<br/>
the officer. The money will then be split evenly between the 2, and<br/>
stored in the regular EQ banks.<br/>
<br/>
When anyone need to borrow money, the person is expected to send a mail<br/>
to the list, stating how much and why do they need to borrow this amount<br/>
of money.<br/>
<br/>
The officer and guildmaster etc...... Will discuss this in game, and<br/>
when approve, the 2 treasurers will withdraw the money out, hand it to<br/>
the nearest official, and the official is expected to deliver the money<br/>
to the goon in need.<br/>
<br/>
To prevent lamers from borrowing money and disband from the guild, the<br/>
bank is ONLY open to those that have join for over 2 months, or have<br/>
proven to be trusty(basically, all the kakis who join the list before<br/>
August are clear)<br/>
<br/>
Recruitment:<br/>
<br/>
To join, one MUST be experience with the game. If they don&#39;t understand<br/>
what RTS, OOM, BBC, SBS, BIBS etc.... are, sorry, you cannot join yet.<br/>
Play the game a tad more.<br/>
<br/>
Character must be of a decent lvl and has to complete a &quot;fetching&quot; quest<br/>
before being admitted. Items being fetch will vary with level.<br/>
<br/>
Example, before a lvl 20 Necro can join, he/she must get a lightstone,<br/>
gator meet, netted gloves and a bronze long sword before being admitted.<br/>
<br/>
Those who have completed the quest, and join the guild, will undergo a<br/>
probation period, where they will randomly be visit by an official, and<br/>
checked on. This may range from things like an officer, being invisible,<br/>
to see whether the recruit is stealing kills to an OOC statement, to<br/>
check other people opinion of the new recruit.<br/>
<br/>
Quitting QHD:<br/>
<br/>
Tonight, I will start the ball rolling, by speaking with Wylven(if he&#39;s<br/>
on) or send him an e-mail, reguarding us, quitting the guild. By friday<br/>
LATEST I expect all those, who are in there, to get out of it.<br/>
<br/>
Time schedule:<br/>
<br/>
Monday-Wednesday : Intensive planning of guild<br/>
Wednesday night: Me, 8 other goondus and the guildmaster will be<br/>
submitting request to create our guild(guild creation has change now, we<br/>
do not need to send e-mail, just need to go to chat channel to register)<br/>
<br/>
Thursday-Friday: Rest leave QHD<br/>
Saturday: Ziltus&#39; SOO camping session, may beg the GM to approve the<br/>
guild on Saturday, instead of Sunday morning 5-6 am since all of us are<br/>
sleeping at that time.</div>
