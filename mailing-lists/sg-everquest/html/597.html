<div id="ygrps-yiv-150133612">Wah piang, u pple so half-hearted, come to Prexus and go back &*^%!#@. <br/>
 *balls kena bang*  OK lor, left me alone also sian, I also come back lah <br/>
;)<br/>
<br/>
Btw, we got high lvls and low lvls - me lvl 12 wiz - simi class?  Can <br/>
someone from HIGH lvl sponsor me a runed totem staff and 20pp to buy my lvl <br/>
12 scrolls? Heheh....dun be so stingy lah, help me mean help u man - me can <br/>
team will high lvl or low lvl (since I&#39;m at the half-f**k lvl), can bind, <br/>
and add extra firepower (ok, wiz sux b4 lvl 12, but at lvl 12, we get 80dam <br/>
spell, Lesrec right?).<br/>
<br/>
Really lah, desperately seeking a magical staff.  So difficult to hunt wisp <br/>
w/o magical weap.  Using spells alone can die man! Half-f**k lvl me still <br/>
