&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway I cant recruit them yet even with ya vote, else our GM will remove<br/>
&gt; me, hehehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; According our great leader, I need to get either of the followings to<br/>
&gt; recruit new members:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. 5 officers.<br/>
&gt; 2. 2 officers + 5 members.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can I get some more support from our guys? ;)  Thx!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To strengthen my stand, let me give a more detail description on both<br/>
&gt; players.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yura is well-known as a power-player in my UO guild, and she is one of my<br/>
&gt; UO members who established their chars fast yet w/o much assistance except<br/>
&gt; some advice and start-up fund.   She is also those hard-working type who is<br/>
&gt; willing to spend time in training her chars.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Misty, on the other hand, is a born leader and know how to take care of<br/>
&gt; those newer members very much (should I say &quot;motherlike&quot;? hehe). She is<br/>
&gt; also very experience in RPG training and very independent.  She actually<br/>
&gt; has her RL son, a lvl 40ish monk, and her RL husband, lvl 46 shaman playing<br/>
&gt; in the same server.  I would like to get all of them in but due to the big<br/>
&gt; difference in timezone, I leave it to u guys to vote.  Of coz I would love<br/>
&gt; to get her in, but I also wanan ensure she can contributed and also enjoy<br/>
&gt; full benefit & fun if she were to join us.  She is also the first female<br/>
&gt; pioneer in my UO guild and work all the way to her vice-GM position.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Talk abt contribution, I&#39;m very sure both of them will be a great asset to<br/>
&gt; our guild in time to come ;) So more support pls, thx thx!<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve 2 UO friends who join us in EQ Innoruuk.  They are both my closest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; buddies in UO Baja, and have gone thru&#39;s numerous live & death battles<br/>
&gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; me in my entire UO life.  Both of them are veteran online RPGers, so<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guys dun have to worry abt them behaving like a newbie, hehe.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; They are Mistaya (lvl 30? wood elf ranger) and Yura (lvl 9 high-elf<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; enchanter).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mistaya is playing in US time zone, so for those US players, if you are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; training ya twink at ya timezone, do consider her as a team member.  ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yura is now staying in Australia, and is playing around S&#39;pore time<br/>
&gt; zone.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  So for S&#39;pore twinks, you know who to ask for hunting ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Both of them are mature players, so you know you can count on them at<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; times.  Pls be nice to them if u happen to meet them online, thx.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As Mistaya is playing in US timezone, she might be better off joining<br/>
&gt; US<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guild.  Yura, on the other hand, play in our timezone.  Maybe some of u<br/>
&gt; &gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; team with her and find out more abt her.  I really wish to invite her<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the guild and I know she will contribute well in EQ, just like my UO<br/>
&gt; guild<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in Baja.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thx.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ziltus.<br/>
