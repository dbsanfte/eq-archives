&gt; For your case since you are new, get cloth armour or woven. Woven being <br/>

of cloth will be slightly lightly, thus reduces less STAMINA.<br/>
<br/>
Err, now I dun even have money to buy food and drink ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Enchanters ain&#39;t normally the fighters, they stand back and watch and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>control the fight/show. At later stages, you are open to a variety of <br/>
&quot;transforming&quot;. You can morph into monsters as well as animals. Whichever <br/>
creature you morph into, you have its powers. Like you morph into wolf, you <br/>
run faster and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Cool!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do not take up Jewel Craft cos&#39; its useless and cost too much to learn.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, I heard enchanter can only enchant jewel and silver bars, if I dun <br/>
train in fewel craft, my chanting target will be limited?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Keep to eating muffins and milk/water. If I am right, you can get them in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Office whatever in Freeport since you are based there. Ask Yiyang aka <br/>
Alex for help as well as Gary ;-)<br/>
Got office ah?  Free of charge?  Is it far away from the west gate?  I now <br/>
