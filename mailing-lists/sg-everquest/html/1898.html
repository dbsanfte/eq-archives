<b>Subject:</b> very easy quest for a marginally useful item <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814795499">Here is the info that Ziltus requested be put up... the 2nd paragraph <br/>
is the one you spell slingers will be interested in...<br/>
<br/>
Lucia&#39;s Dress:   Guard Elron at the gate tower has lost his <br/>
daughter in the sewers, and he wants you to find her.  <br/>
Unfortunately,she has been eaten by Cubert, a gelatinous cube.  <br/>
Kill Cubert and get her dress and return for experience, faction, <br/>
money and a decent item, sometimes a Golden Locket, A Lore <br/>
item that casts a courage spell with 5 charges.<br/>
<br/>
Or in the alternative, give the dress to The NPC standing by the <br/>
bridge to the bank in Qeynos who works in the aqueducts and he <br/>
will give you money and an item (usually a Golden Ear Stud).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Golden Ear Stud, +3 Int, ear-ring.<br/>
