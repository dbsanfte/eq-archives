<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can rise fishing skill by merely fishing at pier?  How u know ya skill max <br/>
out?  How can u make $ via fishing?  Do u really catch fishes and sell?  So <br/>
far I cannot buy decent food/drink. I buy those grapes and wines and in the <br/>
end dunno how to consume them ;(<br/>

&gt; been searchinig/hunting few days and not yet find a decent piece of pant<br/>

&gt;  expensive for me).  Thx Yiyang ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Nice going, that will save me a plat. Hahaha! I recommend cloth for <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now I just bought a old great stave.  Better than my dagger.  Can I max out <br/>
my 2H blunt skill by using the stave to hunt all time, w/o using up <br/>
practising point on it?  When I rise a lvl, I use the points on some skills <br/>
but yet it remain awkful, why?  Now I use my skill points on those skills <br/>
with the coin symbols - chanelling and alteration, is it ok?<br/>
<br/>
Any other skills which we shld practice more often to rise it rather than <br/>
spending practice points on it?  Can someone list some useful items which <br/>
we shld get?  Eg beetle eye can help u to see in dark, even if I use both <br/>
hands to arm my weapon. Any sites I can read up more on these items info?<br/>
<br/>
Also, where can I find bank in freeport?  Any bank close to west gate?<br/>
<br/>
Thx.</div>
