As for choosing AGI over DEX/STR or vice versa. Its all up to you. I&#39;d place<br/>
all in AGI though &lt;smiles&gt; One more thing, try not to use weapons until you<br/>
get really bored with your hands.<br/>

 Ok, dont mind a correction on Monk weight. Its 14 not 15 as was percived.<br/>
some sites still list it as 15. Tested it out myself  and confirmed by some<br/>
other monks. </span></blockquote></div>
