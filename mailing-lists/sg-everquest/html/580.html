  As seen as title,many of us are back to Innoruuk..hehe.Leshrec,me,Uian,Eriz and Kellendil so all those poineers that never move to prexus should be quite strong liao right?hehe..time to be helpfull..just 10-20pp for each guy back will be nice :PPP<br/>
   <br/>
  Anyway,Ive quite lost interest in seeting up a guild anymore ,just asking around if anybody still REALLY want it,maybe we could come up with something and we could ask someguy which is very xperience and highlv chr to guild us...ahem..Garren is now lv17 and loads of stuff...hehe*chuckle*<br/>
   <br/>
  Anyway,I was thinking of either using<br/>
  1.Monk<br/>
  2.Drow wizard<br/>
  3.Half-elf Paladin<br/>
   <br/>
  Was thinking which class is currently the least used by Singaporeans so I can use and which could solo the best so that I could ....ahem..catch up with garren..hehe....<br/>
   <br/>
  Any donations to my lv1 chr is WARMLY WELCOMED!! :PPP<br/>
