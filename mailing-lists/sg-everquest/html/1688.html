&gt; &gt; I&#39;m organising a local kakis (NOT GUILD HUNT) casters hunt for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; following LORE artifacts:<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Water Crystal Staff (1HB)<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Runed Totem Staff (2HB)<br/>
&gt; &gt; - JK Skull (misc)<br/>
&gt; &gt; (NB: LORE means you can only have ONE in ya backpack AND bank, ie each <br/>
 </span></blockquote>char<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; can only have ONE, extra will be deleted by game)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The looting priority is as follows:<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1. Those who can USE the artifact(s) themselves AND are PHYSICALLY <br/>
 </span></blockquote>involved<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; in the hunting.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2. Those who are PHYSICALLY involved in the hunting AND hunt it for <br/>
 </span></blockquote>their<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; secondary char.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3. Those who are PHYSICALLY involved in the hunting AND hunt it for <br/>
 </span></blockquote>friend<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; or cash.<br/>
&gt; &gt; (NB: Since it&#39;s a lore item, you cannot ask someone who have the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>artifact<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; to loot on your behalf.  U can only ask someone to hunt on ya behalf<br/>
&gt; &gt; PROVIDED they dun need one, as in #3).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The dangers:<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1. JK Skull & RTS r dropped by the gnolls (high sha and emi) at the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>zone<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; entrance from SK to LR (during the day).  The gnolls, gnoll guards and<br/>
&gt; &gt; gnoll shamans lvl below 18 I think, but the shaman will heal the high <br/>
 </span></blockquote>sha<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; and emi (both ard lvl 20) when we fight, even thou they themselves are <br/>
 </span></blockquote>con<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; green to us and will not be involved in the fight.  I think those below <br/>
 </span></blockquote>15,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; when trying to walk thru the camp, will invite a train of 3+4+3=10 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>gnolls<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; on you! ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; The camp will turn to undead ruins at night, where skeletons, greater<br/>
&gt; &gt; mummies (lvl 23-24) and dry bones (lvl 24-25) will haunt the place. <br/>
 </span></blockquote> Again,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; any one below lvl 20 and walk pass the camp may invite a train of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>undeads<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; =&gt;Our plan is to camp near zone and the high lvls will help to kill the<br/>
&gt; &gt; mobs and ask those lower lvls to come in to loot.  Of coz, in this <br/>
 </span></blockquote>case,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; priority will give to those who phyically involved in the fighting 1st <br/>
 </span></blockquote>;)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2. Water Crystal Staff<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s dropped by a OVERPOWERED lvl 24-26 aqua goblin called Webclaw. <br/>
 </span></blockquote> Webbie<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; can found in serveral spots in LR.  Its magical hit VERY HARD and is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>VERY<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; AGRO in water, and thing get worse if we enagaed it in the water (we <br/>
 </span></blockquote>get<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; disturbed more often when casting, and swim slower, if we lose, chances <br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; that we will get killed and corpse sinks into the deep lake, then <br/>
 </span></blockquote>corpse<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; seeking and looting session will start).  After much investigation <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(I&#39;ve<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; been camping in LR from lvl 20 to 27), I will lead the team to the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>spawn<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; spot of Webbie, which is the tower isle (extreme end from zone, that <br/>
 </span></blockquote>mean<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; there is NO way to flee if we lose UNLESS we bind near zone, gate out <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; zone).  The plan is to root Webbie (btw it also run VERY fast) the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>moment<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; it spawn before it run towards shore.  I&#39;ve tried rooting Web in water <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; know other spots it shows its face) but seem like a bug will make it<br/>
&gt; &gt; disappear the moment it is rooted in water (I won&#39;t advise to melee it <br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; water unless Garren is coming, coz it&#39;s not funny to search for ya <br/>
 </span></blockquote>corpse<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; in the deep blue lake).<br/>
&gt; &gt; There is 2 concerns regarding the danger for this hunt:<br/>
&gt; &gt; a. To get to the tower isle, you have to swim across the whole lake.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Danger arise when u meet some giant fresh sharks (bigger size than <br/>
 </span></blockquote>orge) ,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; frogloks, aqua goblin, water snakes, or worse, Webclaw itself and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Froglok<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Prince (lvl 30 plus, very powerful, con red, and very very agro, out to<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill EVERYTHING in lake).  This problem can be overcome by taking a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>boat<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; from gnoll camp to tower isle (but take much longer).<br/>
&gt; &gt; b. The spawn spot for Webclaw, UNFORTUNATELY, is also the spawn spot of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Froglok Prince (lvl 30 plus, very powerful and agro) and a deep sea <br/>
 </span></blockquote>goblin<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; pet (lvl 22 to 25 I think).  With FF and me, it&#39;s no big deal taking <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Web,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; or even when the pet spawn at the same time.  H/w, SUAY SUAY, if the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Prince<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; spawn during the fight or come to us, both of us will be the one to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>gate<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; first, since we will have NO fight versus the Prince ;(<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This hunting trip is NOT for anyone below 4th circle (even if we buff u <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; full and guard u all time). Unlike the Guk hunt, it&#39;s VERY difficult to<br/>
&gt; &gt; find ya corpse if u died in lake, and chances is that u will lose ya <br/>
 </span></blockquote>stuffs<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; forever.  To prevent wasting more than half of the time finding/looting<br/>
&gt; &gt; corpses, this trip is STRICTLY for 4th & above circle chars (lvl 12 for<br/>
&gt; &gt; casters, not sure for others) only.  Frankly speaking I believe all <br/>
 </span></blockquote>kakis<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; got at least a 4th circle chars, whether primarily or secondary chars.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Just dun bring ya newbie char along pls.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; LAST NOTE:  This is not a XP or $$$ hunting trip.  There will be no <br/>
 </span></blockquote>hunting<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; of aviak guards etc for xp and coins.  It&#39;s a very task-specific trip - <br/>
 </span></blockquote>get<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; the 3 artifacts for those who need them and get out of the place (I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; gate to Fay, Tox, NK by then).  Anyone who are impatient while waiting <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; the spawn and turn to hunt others will bear their own risk soloing it <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(lvl<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; 20 to 22), coz we will not waste time and mana helping anyone to gain <br/>
 </span></blockquote>xp<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; there.  Webclaw spawn and run very fast from tower to shore, maybe <br/>
 </span></blockquote>within 5<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; seconds or so, we can&#39;t afford to miss it, given that it&#39;s a rare <br/>
 </span></blockquote>spawn.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; PREPARATION:  Everyone please get ready AT LEAST 40 foods, 40 drinks <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and 40<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; of your spell reagients (if applicable). I&#39;m trying to make it a sharp <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; sweet fruitful trip, so pls dun come to assembly area then asking for<br/>
&gt; &gt; food/drink etc.  FF can summon 20 bandages each for those who need (thx<br/>
&gt; &gt; FF!) but I dun wanna see him wasting time summoning food/drinks unless <br/>
 </span></blockquote>we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;  really took so long to camp for the stuffs (40 food/drinks can last me <br/>
 </span></blockquote>10<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; hrs hunt I think).  FF and I can actually do all these by ourselves but <br/>
 </span></blockquote>we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; have decided to help all others (esp casters) to get also, so pls do<br/>
&gt; &gt; everyone a favor by preparing yourself ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; BINDING:  All casters will bind once they zone into LR.  We then move <br/>
 </span></blockquote>on to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; arena (which many lamers invis inside and KOS whoever that zone in, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; the only binding zone in the region, sigh).  FF and I will go in to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>scout<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; the entrance to ensure it&#39;s cleared.  We will then take turn to invis<br/>
&gt; &gt; (guarding) and binding, asking the others to come in one by one.  Once <br/>
 </span></blockquote>all<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; binded, we then go back to gnoll camp and start the hunting.  NO <br/>
 </span></blockquote>arguement<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; on hunting at gnoll camp 1st then bind the non-casters, coz if anyone <br/>
 </span></blockquote>died,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; they will have to run few zones back to LR and it&#39;s a total WASTE of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>time.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;  Make it an effective and efficient hunt pls!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; HUNT PHASE ONE:  Below lvl 20 all sit at zone, above lvl 20s will move <br/>

&gt; &gt; HUNT PHASE TWO:  We will all move to tower isle.  Once there, all lvl <br/>
