<div id="ygrps-yiv-320207900">well... from all the necro guides n stuff... i have decided to pump up my<br/>
INT to 120 and DEX to 100... i dont know if this enough... but i suppose it<br/>
will be... since a Human Necro will have much lesser INT and will also be<br/>
able to manage... i guess the main reason fer using more pp to max out<br/>
brewing  is not bcos of low INT... its bcos of LOW CHARISMA.... thats very<br/>
impt... i thnk... i spend more gold getting the stuff... n sell back fer<br/>
less... thats the way it is... definetely cant compare to a high chr bard<br/>
rite?<br/>
<br/>
also... another thing i noticed... fighting a mob that u got upper hand<br/>
on... will also gain skill in fighting (proven)... i guess u just need to<br/>
fight alot... thats all.... since i gain 1 point when fighting a level 1 mob<br/>
when i was level 4...<br/>
<br/>
back to brewing... u buy 160 sets of everything??!!?!?!?!  7 backpacks<br/>
enough meh? might teaching me some tricks to brewing?.... like the ctrl +<br/>
click thingy someone said earlier (oops.. forgot who... but that really<br/>
helps)...<br/>
<br/>
i guess i will not try to learn any other trade skills fer awhile... least<br/>
not till ive level to i think high enough... or perhaps abit of everything<br/>
every now n then....<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Wah, ya necro abit goon leh, need 10pp to max out skill, hehehe.  Someone<br/>
&gt; just mentioned he max out using only 5pp+ with 75int.  Dun tell me u didnt<br/>
&gt; pump up ya int when u create ya char, or u will sure to suffer at high<br/>
&gt; lvls.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For my brewing, I buy 160 sets of ingredients for my latest brewing, brew<br/>
&gt; until vomit.  I think I get ard 30pp during tat brewing, or maybe more,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not gonna try to brew so much at one short again.  Btw I carry 7<br/>
&gt; backpacks on me, the last slot is looting any containers during hunting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m thinking of picking up smithing, skill 25 now, but dunno what to make<br/>
&gt; or what to do to boost it further. ;(<br/>

&gt; &gt; hiya guys,<br/>
&gt; &gt; thanks again to u guys fer helping me out last nite for the small<br/>
&gt; donation...  (i.e., Ziltus n Sereph)... i guess i took slightly more than<br/>
&gt; the 5-7pp range... more like 10pp... but i was starting to make money by<br/>
&gt; the 9th or 10th pp... so now i have a reasonable amount :) after brewing<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; fer awhile... but can be pretty boring brewing.... ok... just a few quick<br/>
&gt; questions... how many of each stuff do u guys buy usuaully when u go on<br/>
&gt; brewing fer 1 round? i have like 40 of each materials (ie.., hops, malt,<br/>
&gt; etc)... and filled up all my backups (yes! i bought 5 backups)... n start<br/>
&gt; brewing... any better method? or faster method? also.. i said b4 i m gonna<br/>
&gt; return the money... although sereph u said i can keep em... if u still<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; em... do let me know... i will return em to ya...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; now... im thinking of picking up another trade skill... maybe<br/>
&gt; tailoring... since i can make woven fer myself... can i? or cant? any<br/>
&gt; advice on that? or perhaps i will work abit on my levels b4 i start going<br/>
&gt; into something... as fer that dagger yiyang is selling... someone was<br/>
&gt; selling his fer 40pp only...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; once again... thanks guys fer the help...<br/>
