<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-442475543">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d let everyone know that Ziltus has been happily married<br/>
today to a pretty lady he<br/>
now calls his wife! (officially at least)<br/>
<br/>
It was a fun time for all of us who attended as we finally got to put faces<br/>
to all the nicks we&#39;ve been<br/>
calling each other by online. FYI...Galarion, Kellendil, Merns, Leshrec,<br/>
Bibi, Massiah and myself (Zanderion)<br/>
were there and in fact all of us except Bibi (who was busy with wife) went<br/>
for a drink at the nearby<br/>
Starbucks after the dinner.<br/>
Recalling the good old times and just chatting about gaming brought back<br/>
many good memories and funny<br/>
conversation. Pity Ziltus wasn&#39;t able to join us much but i&#39;m sure he&#39;s<br/>
happily busy right now kekekeke!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh and we missed you too Fesse! Were hoping we could see you and put a face<br/>
to that sexy Dark Elf butt i&#39;ve<br/>
been staring at soooo mucchhh!!!!! Oh well there&#39;s always a next time!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, this is also a chance for those of you who weren&#39;t there to give<br/>
him your congrats! :)<br/>
Lets all wish him a great happy (productive!) future with his newly wedded<br/>
beautiful wife!<br/>
<br/>
C O N G R A T S!! Ziltus from all of us...<br/>
<br/>
Was great fun and i hope to see all of you sometime again! Tata for now...<br/>
<br/>
Signing off,<br/>
