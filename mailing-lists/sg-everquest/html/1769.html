&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kindly be reminded that the WCR/RTS/JKS hunt is tonight (Friday) 11.00PM at<br/>
&gt; North Karana Guard Tower next to zone to South Karana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pls get ya food/drink/spell reagents rdy.  No gating service will be<br/>
&gt; available once we reach Lake Rathetear (in order not to waste everybody&#39;s<br/>
&gt; time).  But we still welcome u to join us later if u cant make it at 11pm<br/>
&gt; and u know the way.  If not, pai seh la ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those who dunno the place, pls arrange with other kakis to bring u<br/>
&gt; there, or meet me at Felwithe gate at 10.45PM (take a boat from FP to GF at<br/>
&gt; 10pm, u shld be able to reach GH by 10.45pm), I will open portal to NK<br/>
&gt; (left 1 bubb to lvl 29 and I will login 2 hrs b4 the hunt to lvl, all<br/>
&gt; useful lvl 29 scolls are waiting for me in my bank liao, hehe).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the response is good, everyone behave themselves, I will organise the<br/>
&gt; next trip to Crush Bone, charging for:<br/>
&gt; - Dragoon Dirk (wowowo)<br/>
&gt; - Dwarven Chain (better than bronze breastplate? since it give +8 sv to<br/>
&gt; all)<br/>
&gt; - Shining Bass Shield (ok, welcome to Ziltus Hill, hehe)<br/>
&gt; - Screaming Mace (huh, Fesse start to drip saliver?), ONLY IF time allows<br/>
&gt; AND we have more than enuff artifact for the quest ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope the lvl 30 will also spend a night or so to participate in such<br/>
&gt; hunting (maybe we make Friday night an office LOOTING GATHERING?).  Thou we<br/>
&gt; dun gain anything from it, but at least it will be something different from<br/>
&gt; our routine hunting, gaining xp, kill kill kill only.  Most impt of all,<br/>
&gt; our own kakis can get together and play together.  Afterall, play game is<br/>
&gt; for the sake of having fun and knowing more ppls, hehe.<br/>
