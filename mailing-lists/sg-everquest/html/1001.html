<b>Subject:</b> Re: Solo&#39;ing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-892526855">It&#39;s very sad to see Trifrost changing sex, ops, I mean changing class, <br/>
hehe.  I&#39;ll missed all the good old days of having free SOWing ;)<br/>
<br/>
From my personal experience, my hardest days as a wiz is between lvl 6-11. <br/>
 This is the time where our dd spell sux, our melee sux, we cant steal, we <br/>
cant block, we cant melee and has to live like a parasite begging everyone <br/>
to let us tag along, haha (loss count of how many times I spaming the zone <br/>
shouting for group and no one ever reply).  After lvl 12, we start to pick <br/>
up some face with the more &#39;presentable&#39; shock spell, and our market value <br/>
incease with lvl 16 lighing shock spell.  I heard at lvl 20, we will start <br/>
to get our very 1st mana efficient &#39;mass dd&#39; spell - force shiok, ops I <br/>
mean shock, hehe.  Maybe Leshrec can elaborate more on this. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been teaming with a magi and a bard since lvl 8 - Flyingfox and <br/>
Deadflower.  DF&#39;s song has save our butts many times but he is now having <br/>
his hardest day finding a magical weap to attack mobs tat can only be <br/>
hurted by magic means.  His melee is also lossing out when comparing with <br/>
paladin/shadowknight/warriors.  For the past 2 night DF has died at least 2 <br/>
times trying to tank in the group. Fox also start to face a hard time <br/>
losing kills to those wiz of similar lvl.   According to Sereph, magi will <br/>
have a hard time getting their summoning spells from lvl 16 onwards, necro <br/>
from lvl 20+ and wiz from lvl 30+ onwards.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand I feel I&#39;m playing at the peak of my wiz life so far, coz <br/>
with the shieldskin, invis and root, I have no problem travelling and <br/>
fighting a mob white or sometime yellow to me.  Of coz, I still need a <br/>
group for long term survival, but I start to feel the joy of playing as a <br/>
wiz.  I remember the days I whine alot of been a weakling wiz during newbie <br/>
time coz I&#39;ve so much problem in both soloing and grouping - very often I&#39;m <br/>
the first one who died in a group ;)  Now I feel I have to ability to solo <br/>
at times when I cant find a good team to join.  (Hopefully I dun have to <br/>
whine again at higher lvl, hehe).<br/>
<br/>
I ever mentioned abt an articles I read on UOVault or UOSS abt soloing, <br/>
which the author ranking the race/class combo best for soloing in the <br/>
following order:<br/>
- Troll anything<br/>
- Wiz<br/>
- Shaman<br/>
- Dwarven Cleric<br/>
- Monk<br/>
He also mentioned monk, been the lowest in soloing order, will ultimately <br/>
become the easiest to solo above lvl 30.  Dunno if this is still true, but <br/>
I just hope wiz remains to be a possible choice for soloing at high lvl.<br/>
<br/>
Last night there is a big stealing party at HH.  90% of the participants <br/>
are pure casters, and melee chars all have to stand aside, hehe.  Even <br/>
combining Ling (lvl 18 wiz), Fox (lvl 17 magi) and I, we only have a 50% <br/>
successful rate in getting a kill (well we are competing with lvl 20s <br/>
there).  Frankly speaking if thing con&#39;t to stay on like tat, I would <br/>
rather hunt at oasis orc camp, thou the loot is much more lousy and <br/>
inconvenient due to the wulu wulu location.<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, I dun think TF is taking too long lvling his shaman, <br/>
coz he has MIA for quite a while.  If he find it too long, then he shld <br/>
compare me and Les - which I&#39;m at one time 6 to 7 lvl lag behind him coz of <br/>
house shifting - dun forget Les is also training his necro while I only <br/>
focusing on 1 char.<br/>
<br/>
No doubt a magi can solo well, coz he&#39;s like a provisional shop keeper with <br/>
most of the stuffs avilable at his summoning.  H/w, I think we have to <br/>
consider 2 sides of soloing - roleplaying aspect and realplaying aspect.<br/>
As a magi, u can have all the supplies at a wave of ya hand, but when it <br/>
come to hunting and lvling, you still need somone to tank, someone to nuke <br/>
for u.  A soloing magi will get no where at high lvl, coz wiz will steal <br/>
from u, tankers can last longer than u, and worse, half of ya XP goes to ya <br/>
pet!  So I will consider magi a very good choice for roleplaying but not <br/>
REALplaying.  I guess necro is a better choice for REALplaying, since they <br/>
can dot and drain hp (ie heal).  Magi is next to enchanter when coming to <br/>
&#39;group&#39; caster.  I&#39;ve nothing against it, but hope TF can consider the l/t <br/>
implication instead of just current situation.  Yes, the 1st lvl 8 I met in <br/>
Prexus is a magi and a necro, who guard the Kobold camp whole day with <br/>
their pets.  But imagine like a place like HH pass, ya guarding pet only <br/>
provide a tank for those nukers - which they use ya pet to tank them while <br/>
they laughing behind, nuking and stealing ya kill.<br/>
<br/>
EQ is a group game, personally I dun think any of the char I mentioned <br/>
above is a good soloing choice.  At most they can only be a good PART-TIME <br/>
soloer, where u can still do a bit soloing when you dun feel like teaming <br/>
with others sometime (err who knows?  some gals are in bad mood certain <br/>
time of the month, hehe).<br/>
<br/>
At least we have a big pool of local kakis which we can rely and dependent <br/>
on, trusty worthy as well.  I used to vioce out the loot order when I join <br/>
other groups as a newbie, but now I prefer free loot coz I knew I can trust <br/>
our own kakis to bahave themselves.  With all of us under the same guild, I <br/>
dun think we will encounter much problem getting a descent group using the <br/>
guildsay.<br/>
<br/>
As for the backward trick, it&#39;s not working for casters.  Once we lose a <br/>
lvl, we lose the mana, which reduce our casting ability.  Losing a lvl at <br/>
those critical lvl where we gain new spells will disable us to cast the new <br/>
spells, even if I&#39;ve memo it (already try it, not on purpose but I always <br/>
seem to die the moment I gain the lvl to cast new spells, hehe).<br/>
<br/>
I agreed with YY abt sometime we tends to slow down abit when grouping. <br/>
 When I gain my last bubb of xp at lvl 18, I only need an hr, where I took <br/>
whole Sunday grouping with others to gain 4 bubb, and mind u, I&#39;m playing <br/>
the &#39;legal&#39; nuking for my last bubb of xp. The worse time-vs-xp rate is <br/>
when I team with DF (ok, just for elaborate purpose), I&#39;m basically nuking <br/>
95% of the time while he stand nearby singing song.  I won&#39;t blame him coz <br/>
it&#39;s really very diifficult for him to assist in kill the mobs.  1st most <br/>
of the mobs are red to him, 2nd he dun have a good weap.  H/w, I still <br/>
enjoy sharing xp with him coz I enjoy his company.  Of coz I can simply act <br/>
blur and solo, coz it dun really make much different for me, but DF has do <br/>
me a big favor during my newbie time and I really dun mind sharing my xp <br/>
with him.  I think this is the other element which we will come across when <br/>
playing EQ - friendship.<br/>
DF ever to come all the way from Felwithe to escort me to get my corpse <br/>
from mino cave and lead me back to Felwithe during my 1st trip to <br/>
Steamfont.  He was killed at lesser Faydark when we meet with a train of <br/>
orcs half way thru the journey.  If u guys hunt with him often, u will <br/>
notice DF always LD at night, and given the fact that he almost logout that <br/>
night and change him mind after getting my seek help msg, I will never <br/>
forget his kindness.  That&#39;s why until now I will try my very best to help <br/>
him, and hopefully contribute back to those who ever help me (Leshrec, <br/>
Garren, YY etc).  OPs, side track more than YY liao, pai seh, hahaha.<br/>
<br/>
YY, let organise a Paw/Permfrost trip tonight if HH is flooded with <br/>
stealers again? I&#39;m the first one who is more than willing to follow.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been begging around for pple to bring me to Paw, heard too much of the <br/>
goodies there, yet fairly safe for group hunting.  I propose we form 2 <br/>
groups there -the higher lvls protect and help the lower lvls to get some <br/>
descent equipments.<br/>
<br/>
Someone train a damn SOWer pls, hahahahahahah ;-?<br/>
