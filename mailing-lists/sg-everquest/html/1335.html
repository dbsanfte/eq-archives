 </span></blockquote>Alternatively, you could apply for a Debit card... I think DBS has <br/>
one, or one of the other big 4 local banks.<br/>
<br/>
A debit card works just like a credit card, and allows you to do all <br/>
the things a credit card can, but you must GIVE money to the <br/>
bank first, then use the card to make purchase, instead of use card <br/>
first, then pay later.<br/>
<br/>
As such, application for a debit card is just like opening bank <br/>
account, where you need to have money to put in. And you don&#39;t <br/>
need all those things that credit card owners need, like a big <br/>
salary, big condo, car, club, blah blah blah... *heh*<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents...<br/>
