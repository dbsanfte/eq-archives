<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-56199676">Last night when I fight gob medi, they have very good healing capability. <br/>
 I wanna ask, if a tank hurt a gob medi to below 50% hp, it heals to 75%, <br/>
and this cycle repeat 2-3 times.  Say, in the end when the gob heal to 75% <br/>
and the tank seek for help and I nuke the medi to death (ie from 75% to <br/>
0%)- WHO will get the kill?  I didnt have the chance to try it out coz that <br/>
warrior died and naturnally the kill comes to me (didnt do it on purpose <br/>
but I start to nuke only when my mana gain back to the 50% mark).  I wait <br/>
for the warrior but he didnt come back till I login.  He said he was from <br/>
CB and pay a druid a couple of pp to teleport him there.  I think he will <br/>
have a problem getting his corpse if his bind spot is CB, hehe.<br/>
