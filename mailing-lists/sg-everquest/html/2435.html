<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042933124">I tried a friend cyberway connection last night, 80% I&#39;m flashing between <br/>
yellow and red connection.  Average PL is 30%, and got freeze many times, <br/>
from 5sec to 2 min (that&#39;s when I was killed in najena, by bonecracker). <br/>
 With this kinda connection, better dun hunt and do some maintenance <br/>
instead, like selling stuffs, casting spells in town to rise casting skills <br/>
or do some inventory spring cleaning ;)<br/>
<br/>
Now I gotta think twice b4 getting cyberway $48 unlimited plan.  The <br/>
surfing also sux as compared to $ingnet.  Is cyberway abnormally laggy last <br/>
night and just as per normal days?<br/>
