<div id="ygrps-yiv-912067190">FP far meh? level 6 more than enough to travel there. Just bank<br/>
everything and sprint to BB and take the boot to FP. The whole journey<br/>
is pretty much Mob free, my bard made it to FP at level 5-6 I think.<br/>
<br/>
And nope, I don&#39;t get on Kali much. My nick there is Garford anyway. I<br/>
use Sereph ONLY for RPG games<br/>
<br/>
[Useless fact of the day: I never ever played a male character in an RPG<br/>
game(be it PnP ones or electronic ones), unless I have no choice in the<br/>
gender and the 2 most used names are Sabella and Sereph in that order]<br/>
<br/>
And hell no, I&#39;m not a castration fanatic. I only castrated Enteri as it<br/>
took him so long to do a task for me and some people I dislike in not so<br/>
real life.<br/>
<br/>
Always remember this fact: Sereph is a female name.<br/>
<br/>
Sereph, door to door parang saleswoman who won&#39;t take no for an answer.<br/>

&gt;      Since you&#39;re an S&#39;porean, you have already clear part 1 of<br/>
&gt;      our joining ritual. You must now make your way over to<br/>
&gt;      Freeport for your &quot;parang ceremony&quot; held by me then the<br/>
&gt;      trial period where we monitor you. Then we&#39;ll officially<br/>
&gt;      accept you as one of us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Only when you travel to FP can we aid you and besides,<br/>
&gt;      everyone is around FP<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Sereph, your expert in parangs and fast castrations.<br/>
