&gt; Hi guys,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Surprised to say I didnt miss EQ over the weekend when I didn&#39;t login ;)<br/>
&gt;  Instead I login UO to settle some housing issues.  UO will be<br/>
implementing<br/>
&gt; a major item patch tomorrow, and I spend my weekend preparing for it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After this item patch, a skill management patch will come shortly, which<br/>
&gt; greatly enhance the role-playing element of UO.  With this skill patch, I<br/>
&gt; will do lots of macroing when I sleep at night, hehe, till I get all the<br/>
&gt; chars I want.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With all these new patches, UO is becoming a much better game.  I must<br/>
&gt; admit I&#39;m kinda bored with camping, lvling, hack and slash in EQ....and I<br/>
&gt; think there is a lack of motivation for me to login EQ, even when I have<br/>
&gt; nothing to do at home (in the end spend time watching TV series, hehe).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just to inform all that I will not show my face in EQ often in the month<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; Oct, mainly due to many things I need to settle with the new UO patches<br/>
&gt; (plus some guild matters too).  I hope EQ will still attract me after Oct,<br/>
&gt; or else I may consider selling away my acct, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other than sorting my house items during the weekend, I didnt go for any<br/>
&gt; hunting in UO.  Meeting all my good old buddies already take up half of my<br/>
&gt; UO login time (sparred with some of them and still kill them, hehe).<br/>
There<br/>
&gt; is no arguement that UO has better role-playing element than EQ.  With the<br/>
&gt; coming patches which UO will be implement teaming, pvp etc policies like<br/>
&gt; EQ, I think more ex-UO players will be draw back from EQ to UO (provided<br/>
&gt; they still have an active acct like me, coz UO just conduct a char purge<br/>
&gt; last Fri, to delete all chars under acct not active for 3 months).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you guys wanna play UO, I&#39;m in the Baja shard ;)<br/>

&gt; Ziltus Planeswalker (aka Dark Flame in UO Baja shard)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p/s: This is not a quiting-EQ msg, dun get me wrong.  Just need to take a<br/>
&gt; break from the plain hack-&-slash &#39;routine&#39; work, hehe. ;) </span></blockquote></div>
