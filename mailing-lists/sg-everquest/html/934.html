<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1) do u usaully sells the brew to NPC vendors ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So far I only sell to npc, since I cant find player who is willing to buy <br/>
200 over bottles of fiery brew from me at a time.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Gate potions or only alcoholics stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think u need alchemist to make potion, not via brewing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3) Knowing that over consumption of &quot;Drinks&quot; will lower your INT, does<br/>
&gt; brewing lower INT too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So far brewing dun lower my INT.   Only comsumption will.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO brewing is a very easy and nice trade to develop.  If u got 5-10pp and <br/>
2 hrs to spare, why not max it out?  If omeday your char corrupted and all <br/>
the items on u and ya bank kena wiped off, you still have a skill to make <br/>
some money ;)<br/>
