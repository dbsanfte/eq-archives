<div id="ygrps-yiv-868454226">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s need to be that bad for the borxx eye hunting. I can<br/>
almost solo the whole runnyeye now except for the king&#39;s room and the evil<br/>
eye spawn. The king room b&#39;cos of 4 elite guards and the king (wah super<br/>
hero also cannot 1 verus 5 what) and evil eye (including Borxx) bcos of 1<br/>
kaki and spells. with the full group this Sat, chicken feed lah<br/>

&gt; But come to think of it, I guess we can avoid such &#39;swayness&#39; most of the<br/>
&gt; time.  ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;No cash, pay simi? Better don&#39;t promise money to Garren, else if we<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; have enough money to pay, all our female characters, other than Aaleku<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; obvious reasons, are doom. He&#39;s a damn pimping Paladin for Tunare&#39;s<br/>
sake!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hehe not pay full amt la, but at least show some nominal appreciation mah.<br/>
&gt;  If u lvl 1 and ask Garren to camp SOO for u, he where got so free, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Well, the last Rathetear hunt, we were quite puntual, if not for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; freaking crash of NK. Generally, we are quite Punctual for day 1 of most<br/>
&gt; hunt.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Day 2 is a different affair altogether.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is really unavoidable &#39;sway&#39;.  FF and I kena EQ crash and have to<br/>
&gt; reinstall and re-download all patches, took us almost an hr ;(  That&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; 2nd gate spell I cast, I thought my gate so powerful that it crashed NK,<br/>
&gt; hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Think we hot blooded youngsters as patient as you old mans ah? We<br/>
&gt; bored, find<br/>
&gt; &gt; something to do liao, heck care about you ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then what is the objective for the hunt?  If we organised a camping event,<br/>
&gt; then camp lor.  Otherwise make it an adventuring event.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;To prevent this from happening, we should always have a non-meditating<br/>
&gt; class<br/>
&gt; &gt; aka monks, bards, rogues and warriors during a camp to look for spawn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually not necessary always, coz we can invis ourselves and med.  If we<br/>
&gt; got for those fixed number mob, fixed spawning rate hunting spot, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; always more than enuff time to get fully med and rest b4 the next spawn.<br/>
&gt;  This sentence dun apply to those dungeons or random spawn region.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Agree, but, the problem with us right now is that we are freaking<br/>
&gt; &gt; disorganise. Most of the times, we have rojak groups, with huge level<br/>
&gt; &gt; difference, due to lack of participation of other kakis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tat&#39;s why I mentioned, categorise the hunting lvl.  If it&#39;s a lvl 30 mob,<br/>
&gt; just open it for the lvl 30 & above kakis.  If it&#39;s a lvl 10 hunt, open to<br/>
&gt; those lvl 10 and above (high lvl can join if they choose to help) and<br/>
&gt; invite 1 or 2 high lvl to help.<br/>
&gt; As for participation, I think our kakis are the active bunch in QHD. So<br/>
far<br/>
&gt; we can get at least 1 full group for the events. ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Prepare your group gate at all times loh, tanks gonna die, GG first,<br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; &gt; later.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My gate spell cost 300 mana.  Wiz can be act as the last resort for<br/>
&gt; fleeing, just make sure<br/>
&gt; - No mob disturb me during the 10-15 second casting (yes, gate spell got<br/>
&gt; the longest casting time).<br/>
&gt; - I have enuff mana (in fact I advise all casters to at least reserve 1<br/>
&gt; bubb mana for self gating out, and 2 bubb if u can cast party gate spell).<br/>
&gt; If wiz cannot gate out, it will be a &quot;I DIE U ALL DIE&quot; situation, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another concern I have is the limited spell slots.<br/>
&gt; My 8 spell icons are:<br/>
&gt; - 1st nuke (120 dam, for finishing running mob)<br/>
&gt; - 2nd nuke (180 dam, for doing last kill if mob not running yet left ard 1<br/>
&gt; bubb HP and save mana)<br/>
&gt; - 3rd nuke (260 dam, for normal hunting)<br/>
&gt; - Major shield (rise HP and AC)<br/>
&gt; - Shield<br/>
&gt; - Root<br/>
&gt; - Gate (last resort for myself)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As u can see, all the above r essential for my survival and hunting.  If I<br/>
&gt; replace last slot with party gate, I can not longer gate myself out when<br/>
&gt; the party gate fail or low mana.  ;(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So unless it&#39;s like the ROO tactics I mentioned, where wiz main task is tp<br/>
&gt; party gate once we kill and loot oracle, portal spell never shown on my<br/>
&gt; normal spell icon slots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Only 2 cents? So cheapskate? at least give S$2 lah<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Be humble ma, hehe.<br/>
