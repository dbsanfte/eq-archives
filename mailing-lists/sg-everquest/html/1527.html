<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801911305"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; well, we can always do that when u guys are free... just gimme a tell on<br/>
&gt; when u r free... i should be online almost all the time over the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>weekend...<br/>
<br/>
K, but I normally go Felwithe only when 1 hr or so b4 I log (to sell <br/>
stuffs, unload, buy supplies, reload, logout), so expect to do it late <br/>
night.  Anyway I think u shld have no prob, since u sleep in office, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; no  i am not complaining that u (LKW) didnt give me stuff... i only to<br/>
&gt; mention that theres no guild unity in QHD at all... since someone having<br/>
&gt; like 5 RTS dont even bother to give it to others and keep insiting on<br/>
&gt; money... as for lake rathetear... i guess when i have reached the level <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(20<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if i am not wrong, pls correct)... u can show me the area and i can get <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; myself... no worries on that one...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dun worry I understand, just pull ya leg.<br/>
Just that u also have to understand tat unlike our UO guild, where all <br/>
members meet and hunt togather, our current guild dun have so much contact <br/>
and not tat close (except amg local kakis).  So sometime it&#39;s not easy for <br/>
them to part with such stuffs to members which they may not even hunt with <br/>
b4.  Even for myself, if non-local member ask me for free RTS, I will ask <br/>
him to fly kite (hehe but I won&#39;t go ard annouce I got 5 RTS in guardsay in <br/>
the first place).  I will only secret tell those local kakis whom I know <br/>
can use them and most probably want them - just like those who get msg from <br/>
me for free RTS and free skulls.  Basically the main problem I think is tat <br/>
we are not close to other members in the group except for our own local <br/>
kakis and friends (like flyingfox hunt with me almost every night), the <br/>
rest I dun even meet them b4 ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i am now 1 bubbble away from level 18 and hope to get to level 20 or 21 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>over<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the weekend... from then i will start to hunt aviaks... which i strongly<br/>
&gt; believe i can solo em until level 24-25... thast wat i heard... then the<br/>
&gt; treant hunting starts...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only problem with soloing is tat u may have to fight for kill with <br/>
others.  If a wiz of not less than a circle lvl is there, u are as good as <br/>
hopeless if he dun choose to share.  On the other hand, u have an upper <br/>
hand over tankers, hehe.  I start soloing at lvl 21 or 22, cant remember, <br/>
using the root & nuke tactics.  I also know some stealer magi who solo at <br/>
20 with their pets (read the word STEAL, that mean they make use of others <br/>
to get XP).  I guess there are few kakis close lvl to yours and u guys shld <br/>
try to form a group for hunting instead of soloing.  There is a 3 bird <br/>
tower there, where 3 bird spawn at same time.  If u lose kill in soloing, <br/>
just for a group of 3 to hunt there, the reture is the same - 3 bird for 3 <br/>
chars VS 1 bird for 1 char ;)  If a wiz can solo 3 birds in lake, the place <br/>
will give him no xp ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hmmm... let see wat else did i miss... oh yea... words... if anyone of u<br/>
&gt; guys come across necro words... pls kindly keep em for me... as my <br/>
 </span></blockquote>research<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have just began.... and pls refer to the follow passge for research<br/>
&gt; information...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure if everyone know it, u dun have to BUY all the spells:<br/>
- Ultility spells, buy only those tat u MIGHT use (eg buying light spell <br/>
for DE with ultravision is a waste).<br/>
- Dam spells, buy only those that u will place in ya spell icons (eg I dun <br/>
buy AE spells and even when I buy for my 1st 2 circle, I never use them - <br/>
no chance to memo them, which is a waster of money, only make me die <br/>
faster).<br/>
- Check the site for those spells not available in your guild, are they <br/>
been casted by other classes?  If yes, u can buy instead of research.  So <br/>
far I buy those useful spells that need wiz to research from other classes&#39; <br/>
guilds - enstill from cleric guild, leviate from druid guild etc.  When <br/>
there is a faster, cheaper and easier way to get a spell, why not? ;)<br/>
<br/>
Also, I dun undertstand what u mean by the research rquest.  Do u mean <br/>
finding the correct ingredient to make new spells?  If that&#39;s the case, dun <br/>
bother, there are some site that give all the research info.  No need to <br/>
learn languages.<br/>
