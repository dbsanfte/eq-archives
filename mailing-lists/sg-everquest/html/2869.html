<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036356592">Got a very very bad day on Fri night, ops, Sat morning.<br/>
<br/>
Was hunting in Unrest with DF, he was helping me with the Acumen Mask <br/>
quest.  We took in 2 newbie healers, and the hunt supposed to end quite <br/>
early but one of the 2 healers was a damn CCB looter.  Already told them in <br/>
advance they can get all the loot except the NO DROP, worthless darkbone <br/>
skull (while DF get some xp), yet this KNN idiot go and loot the 1st skull. <br/>
 In the end no choice, hunt longer.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after I got the skull, I stayed back with DF, hoping to get him a <br/>
BS tunic to sell, thanks for his companion and help.  While standing on the <br/>
fountain, suddenly my screen turned blue!  I tried all means to close the <br/>
blue screen (infamous win9x GPF) but system simply hanged.  No choice, so I <br/>
turned off my PC and turned it on again.  When I rebooted, win98 did it <br/>
normal scandisk and this time it showed many corrupted files, crosslinks <br/>
etc.  No choice, I get all of them fixed.  Just before it reached the win98 <br/>
desktop screen, system halted again!  I kept trying to load my PC and the <br/>
same old thing keep coming back - files/directory corrupted and system had <br/>
to rename file/directories...until a stage it renamed my win.com file!!! <br/>
 Damn PC finally down as it can&#39;t even load it&#39;s win98! I struggled for 2 <br/>
hrs (till 6am in the morning) and gave up.<br/>
<br/>
The next time, Sat, the saga continued.  Again I tried to boot from CDrom, <br/>
FDD etc but system simply dun worked.  In the end I selected boot from <br/>
win98 CDrom and reinstall win98.  Still got file errors during scandisk but <br/>
I managed to install my win98.  Next I went on to install all drivers <br/>
etc...damn...pc lock-up again.  When I rebooted...scandisk got error, fix <br/>
file and rename...the same old cycle con&#39;t.  Everytime it scandisk, it <br/>
found more corrupted and crosslinked files (and it renamed more files just <br/>
to fixed them).  I kept on scandisk, reinstall win98 until I fall asleep in <br/>
front of my PC (wake up and 6am Sunday and realized the damn thing still  <br/>
 scandisking!!!).<br/>
<br/>
In the end, Sun morning....gave up.  Try my very best to retrieve my data <br/>
using dos prompt but still lost many important files.  Some files, like <br/>
ICQ/DB/*.* files, all got cut-short becoz the filename &gt; 8 chars and dos <br/>
prompt can only copy max 8.3 files.  Anyway no choice.  Ard noon time, <br/>
completed data CR mission.  Becoz of so many corrupted and crosslink files, <br/>
I decided to reformat my HDD thoroughly, by using LOW-LVL formnat!  The <br/>
format (8.4GB hdd) took me so long....from noon to night 10pm plus!!! <br/>
 After that, I spend like 3 hrs reinstalling all my drivers, ISP, MS <br/>
office, EQ (included patching online) etc.  By the time I finally patching <br/>
EQ, already 1am plus.  Login EQ just to get my char out of unrest (heng, <br/>
still alive, hehe).  Sigh, dun even got time to install UO (UO got longer <br/>
online patch than EQ).  Maybe tonight I will con&#39;t with my PC CR mission ;(<br/>
<br/>
All my The Sim goodies are gone (gotta re-train my &#39;perfect-skilled&#39; sims), <br/>
my chars and treasures found in BG and GB expanion, my UO and EQ <br/>
macro/hotkey list etc....sigh.<br/>
<br/>
Now I know the importance of HDD backup.  Anyone got any good CDRW machine <br/>
to introduce?  Shld I get internal or external one?  I dun think I can <br/>
afford SCSI, so any EIDE or parallel port version is good enuff.  Pls <br/>
recommend.<br/>
<br/>
p/s: Died by DROWNING (in DC) while trying to do the ice comet quest.  How <br/>
long can mage&#39;s water stone last?  Maybe someone can summon me a few when I <br/>
do the quest again this or next week.  Ouch, also dropped lvl...gotta go <br/>
back kill dwarves again, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Ziltus, the real CR man!</div>
