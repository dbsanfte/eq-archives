Subject:        	[sg-everquest] PLay EQ and think UO<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, Kelethin is the best city to train pottery. Even better <br/>
than FP... in fact, FP is the worst for that particular skill.<br/>
<br/>
The vendors are all there in Kelethin, and they are &quot;open air&quot; <br/>
vendors, so they can&#39;t run around and take the day off.<br/>
<br/>
The vendor that sells the sketches is on the orc lift platform. The <br/>
vendor that sells the clay, glass shards and firing sheets is outside <br/>
the Emerald warriors.<br/>
<br/>
The pottery wheel is a bit far off though, and usually is camped by <br/>
quite a number of people. From the first lift platform (the one that <br/>
has the ramp leading up to the smithing forge), take the south <br/>
bridge to a platform with an armour/leather merchant. From there, <br/>
go up 2 ramps. The wheel/kiln is next to the merchant that makes <br/>
Banded Orc Vests from 2 legionaire shoulder pads, a crushbone <br/>
belt and 10 gold.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, would-be potters. I think I&#39;ll try cooking next. *heh*<br/>
