<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; train with to increase STR.  CGW say find something to hit, I try those <br/>
&gt; sparring bags in Kingpin club but cannot use them.  Can teach? ;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Training STR very sianz, basically keep forcing open doors and <br/>
chests. Don&#39;t use crowbar, that&#39;s too easy.<br/>
<br/>
Any locked door you see, whack until no energy left, rest awhile (in <br/>
the strategic map screen) then whack again. Don&#39;t care about the <br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t do it&quot; message. Usually, can whack until about 30 to 40 <br/>
times or more before increase one point... that&#39;s why damn sianz.<br/>
<br/>
Any door or chest can be opened with patience, that&#39;s why I prefer <br/>
to use my mechanical skills for repairing stuff. There&#39;s this guy, <br/>
VERY cheap one, from M.E.R.C, called Gasket. His mechanical is <br/>
pretty high, comabt skills like crap, but only 200 a day. I use him <br/>
as a base repairman. I just sit him down in my base of operations, <br/>
and get him to repair stuff that my comabt mercs have broken or <br/>
worn out... *heh*<br/>
