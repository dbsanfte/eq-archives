<b>Subject:</b> RE: Anyone playing on Cazic Thule? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-457183593">Ya, Sereph USED to play in Cazic with his LVL 40 enchanter.  Happened that <br/>
one day he know all other locals play in Innoruuk.  He wanna join us so <br/>
much tat he make a non-returnable path - he deleted his LVL 40 enchanter <br/>
and create a band new gu niang bard to join us at Innoruuk, we are all so <br/>
touched and everyone help him to regain his lvl - by giving him stuffs, <br/>
power-training him etc.  Now he is lvl 20 bard who can start to kick asses <br/>
ard.<br/>
<br/>
Hey why are you still in Cazic???  Delete ya lvl 18 magi and come to join <br/>
us at Innoruuk lah.  There is SO MUCH fun and benefits playing with all of <br/>
us:<br/>
- Free goodies.  We practice family &quot;pass-down&quot;.  When Garren get a thug <br/>
robe which he cannot used, he pass to me FOC!  When I get a goss robe, I <br/>
pass my thug robe to flyingfox.  Basically we pass all the goodies ard - <br/>
esp when we looted something which our char cant use.  So far I got <br/>
woven/das stuffs from Yiyang and Leshrec, Robes from Garren, JK Skill from <br/>
Sereph etc etc.  I also pass RTS, Skull etc ard.<br/>
- Easy teaming.  As compare to my japanese wiz friend, who is 3-4 lvl above <br/>
me b4 I join the local kakis teams, I lvl much more faster.  The 2nd time I <br/>
see my jap friend, I&#39;m already 4 lvl above him!  Now he also join us and <br/>
shortly after joining us, he boost his lvl from 14 to 20 in a very short <br/>
time.  PLUS the fact tat local kakis are are VERY UNITED and TRUST-WORTHY - <br/>
we will never leave u behind when it come to life-&-death situation, except <br/>
for YY, haha.  On top of that, you will never have problem getting hunting <br/>
party in server coz anytime you login, u see local kakis.  We play till as <br/>
late as 4am during weekdays, and till morning for weekends ;)<br/>
- We are all under the same guild.  Tat means it&#39;s very easy to get in <br/>
touch using the guildsay command.  Limited to 20 friends only?  NP man, use <br/>
guildsay and get everyone with ya fingers.<br/>
- So far we have all classes except SK, ranger and rogue.  For local kakis <br/>
we got 2 wiz, 1 magi, 1 enchant, 1 necro for casters.<br/>
- BEST OF ALL, you can borrow money from our rich man Garren.  He offer <br/>
interest free loan.  Sometime u can even confuse him (since he lent money <br/>
to so many pple) and no need to return, hahah.<br/>
