&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Dued to my failure at PoF which got alot of ppl into trouble<br/>
&gt; (which<br/>
&gt; &gt; involved dying and losing the major portion of their stuff) and with<br/>
&gt; little<br/>
&gt; &gt; else to do (except like camping for stuff, which I have gotten very sick<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; tired of), I have cancelled my account as from today, Oct 26th 1999.<br/>
Zand,<br/>
&gt; &gt; please give out the items to the people as I have listed down with you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Especially Weadaenye, whom I&#39;m guilty as hell to got her into a living<br/>
&gt; hell.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Please help me tell the follow people of my quiting and hope to<br/>
&gt; see<br/>
&gt; &gt; them again sometime on another game another time and Best wishes to<br/>
them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Daedor, Aildiin, Iyenya, Ironbuket, Hoppy, Kitiarra, Stella,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Saintly, Valadine, Millie, Silph, Lunatictiara, Ader, Fost, Sparrow,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Demitry, Wlyven, Anima and Nismo/Volk (they are brothers sharing the<br/>
same<br/>
&gt; &gt; account).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Everquest was, had been and enjoyable game at the beginning but<br/>
&gt; due<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the way that the game is designed it reminds me more of Evercamp,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Everbitch etc etc. It has become a torture to enter the &quot;game&quot; each day<br/>
&gt; now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This incident has at least freed me from Evercrack as some would say it<br/>
&gt; is.<br/>
&gt; &gt; So farewell my fellow guildmates. And may your time in Everquest be as<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; first day, with new and exciting adventures each day.<br/>
