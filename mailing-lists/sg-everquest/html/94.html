&gt; You will get used to it after 2 weeks ;-) I played at ODEO &lt;Paradise <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh, I try some other 1st person 3D shooters b4, none of them can attract <br/>
me for more than an hr b4 I need to turn off PC and lie on my bed to stop <br/>
my head spinning ;)  So how is your motion sickness towards EQ now?  I hope <br/>
I can slowly adapt to the &#39;spin&#39; ;)<br/>

Nope, been playing UO since day one it release in S&#39;pore (my guild now <br/>
within the top 2-5 biggest veteran guilds in Baja).  I just wish I can <br/>
remain in EQ for some RPing, provided I can stand the motion sickness.  UO <br/>
is too committed, surely I can&#39;t afford the same for EQ. But if I can play <br/>
some kinda unqiue uncommon chars in EQ, I&#39;ll be happy liao ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh, me not just simi-RPer, u can call me full-time RPer.  I played paper <br/>
AD&D since 1983, b4 Apple computer is even commonly available.  I played <br/>
all the major RPG series like Might & Magic, Wizardry and Ultima series, <br/>
all from volume one (some played with my Apple computer).  Actually I would <br/>
consider enchanter not someone powerful, but it&#39;s my dream to enchant <br/>
items, esp weapons.  I know from a lvl 11 enchanter than EQ enchanter can <br/>
only enchant jewelry and silver bar, but that is better than none. <br/>
 Hopefully they can patch this class later and allow us to enchant weapons, <br/>
hehe.  It&#39;s a dream but just imagine, the RP element behind an enchanter, <br/>
hehe.  Actually my UO friends ask me to start as a human monk or troll <br/>
shadow knight coz they r powerful & easier to train, but I really dun wanna <br/>
see duplication of my chars everywhere ;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway, you made a good choice to play enchanter, they are good once they<br/>
&gt; hit the 20+ region! Then they are LOTS LOTS and LOTS of fun!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh, actually other magery class r much better than enchanters when they <br/>
reach high lvl.  I think enchanter as not as powerful as their magic <br/>
counterparts but I dun care.  I might not even last to reach lvl 20 (due to <br/>
motion sickness), so meanwhile just RP someone I like ;)<br/>
