<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031991555">Hehe no lah, just trying to suggest to u guys to throw in 5-8pp on brewing <br/>
1st rather than spending on other stuffs.  The  princple is actually very <br/>
straigh forward - buy a chicken or 5 eggs 1st.  If u buy 5 eggs, u can <br/>
either eat them up (spend on items) or hatch them for chickens (buy scrolls <br/>
and use them to hunt for money, but take longer time at ya lvl,  imagine <br/>
the time & money u need to spend to keep the chickens, hehe). <br/>
 Alternatively, u can buy a chicken (train ya brewing) and let it lay eggs <br/>
(money).  In the short run, spending money on eggs more shiok, in the med <br/>
run, spending on chicken is more practical.  In the long run, ultimately <br/>
both achieve the same result, hahaha.<br/>
<br/>
Nice chicken and egg theory huh, LOL ;)<br/>
<br/>
Just a comparison.  U spend 4 night hunting earning 40pp.  H/w, u can also <br/>
spend 5-8pp to max brewing to 135 in 2 hrs, and another 2 hrs to make 20pp. <br/>
 So first night u make 20pp plus max skill.  Just spend another 3 nights of <br/>
4 hrs u can get 140pp (MIN) in total easily, hehe.  At this rate u can earn <br/>
a FBR in 1 week.  This remind me of my UO kakis Asmandi Dragon who used to <br/>
spend 1 whole week just chopping tree making wooden shields and sell to npc <br/>
in order to buy his 2-storey house, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this msg will motivate u guys to pick up brewing, it&#39;s really worth <br/>
spending time and effort.  Of coz, I dun expect u to brew for 4 whole day, <br/>
I myself brew 2 hrs also bu ta han liao.  With brewing skill, rather than <br/>
hunting desperately for $ (which can be a pain when u face a whole camp of <br/>
stealers or no one wanna team with u), u can actually spend 1 hr daily <br/>
brewing to give yaself some stable source of money.<br/>
<br/>
Leshrec got a good point on buying scrolls.  For the 1st 2 cycles, I try to <br/>
buy all scrolls only to find out that I only used 2-3 at most.  In the end <br/>
I spend so much money on useless scrolls.  When I come to 3rd circle <br/>
spells, I seek Leshrec&#39;s advice on which scrolls to buy (since we both wiz, <br/>
it&#39;s nice to have someone ahead of u sometime to share with u his <br/>
experience, hehe).  Coming to 4th circle I more or less know wat kinda <br/>
spell is impt for wiz.  Lvl 5 there is more useful spells, so I buy more <br/>
scrolls.  With the help of my brewing, I already got all the wanted scrolls <br/>
for my lvl 20 (all gate, dd and armor spells except instill which I heard <br/>
need research?), and still saving for my Gossmer Robe or FBR.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, if u can, try to get the dimension bag scroll 1st. This is a VERY <br/>
useful spells for low str caster coz this summoned bag can carry stuffs at <br/>
weightless(?)!  The only thing u need to remember is to empty them b4 u log <br/>
since they will disappear when u log.  At high lvl, u will loot stuffs like <br/>
bronze weap and ring/rawhide armors which r pretty heavy.  So this bag will <br/>
come in VERY handy.  U can even sell it to non-magi for some money if they <br/>
intend to camp at wulu wulu place w/o merchants & bank! Since magi can <br/>
summon bandage, u guys got the cheapest mean to train bind wound, which is <br/>
a very nice skills to have when soloing with a pet.<br/>
<br/>
One &#39;mis&#39;-concept abt binding is tat many casters take it as a source of <br/>
income, but frankly speaking I only take it as a utility spells.  I never <br/>
bother to offer bind for a fee unless I&#39;m in good mood or I&#39;m abt to log - <br/>
for free.  Of coz donation welcome.  So far I heard the max amt pple <br/>
willing to pay is 1pp, and so far I leave it to other to give me as a <br/>
donation - max 5gp so far, hehe.  The power of binding cannot be measure <br/>
via monetary term.  It&#39;s one of the most useful spells casters have, not as <br/>
a trade but as the ability to adventure.  Comparing with the tank who cant <br/>
bind, we casters are so fortunate that we dun have to spend time running <br/>
all the way to our corpse.  U r right that lvl shld come first b4 money, <br/>
esp when u r below lvl 16.  Dun complain too much abt lousy loot.  We used <br/>
to hunt caimen and croc at oasis and the best loot on them is a piece of <br/>
meat tat we can sell for 7cp, hahaha.  Most of the pple dun even bother to <br/>
pick them up.  Only poor wiz like me go around picking the rubbish, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also picking up smithy slowly now, after spending 20 skill point on it. <br/>
 H/w, when camping at HH I&#39;m now having problems buying sharpening stone. <br/>
 Anyone know where can I get that in HH?  Does HH got a bank?<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hey Ziltus,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Wah lau, don&#39;t make it sound like we&#39;re begging for money leh.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I know I complained i&#39;m broke but i didn&#39;t say I wanted you guys<br/>
&gt; &gt;to give me any :P Donations are always accepted lah of course<br/>
&gt; &gt;but the key thing, i believe, is that I don&#39;t go around hoping for them<br/>
&gt; &gt;or asking you guys for any.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It&#39;s just that i spent 3 whole nights making 40+ pp from hunting? And i<br/>
&gt; &gt;spent<br/>
&gt; &gt;them all on my lvl8 spells which cost 3pp 9gp 8scp per spell.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m almost lvl 11 and i&#39;m just thinking at this rate...when i hit lvl 12<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;buy those  new spells at 5-6pp each...i need at least another 60pp?? <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wah..<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;siong man<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I did hear of the brewing thing...just that when first heard of it...was<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt;very<br/>
&gt; &gt;sure of the details...but i guess now i probably would try.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;One more thing is that in my area where i&#39;ve been hunting of late...you <br/>
 </span></blockquote>get<br/>

&gt; &gt;but only shitty bones for loot. (Mummies, skeletons,chessboard Skel <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pawns,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;etc...)<br/>
&gt; &gt;So i had to choose between levelling and making money. I chose levelling<br/>
&gt; cos<br/>
&gt; &gt;i want to hit lvl 12 faster...the bind affinity spell i thought can use <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;make some money!<br/>
&gt; &gt;Alot of ppl are willing to pay 1pp at least for a bind somewhere. Best<br/>
&gt; &gt;man...if got 20 ppl<br/>
&gt; &gt;in one night...20pp liaoz...LOL Don&#39;t think so easy lah hehe Besides <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll<br/>

&gt; &gt;i&#39;m short on cash (which is most of the time). I prefer to do for free<br/>
&gt; &gt;actually. Nice guy here :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Ok that&#39;s it for me...off to work (late again hiaks)<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Jus a thought.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Everyone start off been very poor, and even at lvl 18, I&#39;m still very<br/>
&gt; &gt;poor,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; unlike our rich man Garren, hehe.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; We guys gotta learn to stand on our feet sometime.  I think brewing is <br/>

 </span></blockquote>just<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; hunting, brewing still give me better and faster return than hunting <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt; cant do the same ;)  No doubt we try to help by sponsoring abit, but u<br/>
&gt; &gt;guys<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; have to help us to help yaself sometimes ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; One thing for sure, we the local kakis always keep items which we <br/>
 </span></blockquote>think<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt; other kakis can used (eg I keep cutt ring for newbies, ring mails for<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt; try to help as and when we can, but one must understand the fact tat<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; utimately u r the one playing the game and handling ya own char, hehe.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; IMHO, brewing can make some quick buck.  At lvl 10 u shld be able to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>save<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt; up to 10pp.  Of coz I know pple will use them to buy stuffs like<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; weap/armor/scrolls.  But just ponder - if u spend it on brewing, u can<br/>
&gt; &gt;earn<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; even more to buys stuffs, at the same time maxing ya skill.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; At lvl 18 now, I&#39;m still picking up bone chips, rusty weaps, animal<br/>
&gt; skins,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; beetle eyes and even rat tooth (7cp) to sell.  FYI I&#39;m a wiz with the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; weakest STR amg all races and I keep SIX bags on me to carry loot. <br/>
 </span></blockquote> Many<br/>
