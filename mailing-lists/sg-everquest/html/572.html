&gt; OK, at high lvl, wiz basically can only root, nuke, root, nuke again, root<br/>
&gt; again...We stand no chance meleeing with those high lvl monsters that one<br/>
&gt; hit can send us back to our makers, hehe.  Dun ask me why I enjoy it.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the same principle for cleric - buff, heal, buff again, heal again...;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since we can only root & nuke, basically melee skills is kinda useless to<br/>
&gt; us (unless we just hunt monsters much lower lvl then us for the sake of $$$<br/>
&gt; but no XP), our market value thus based solely on our mana, which is again<br/>
&gt; solely dependent on INT.  Think in this way, having 10% INT, say will give<br/>
&gt; u 10% more mana for each lvl u gain, and this difference in gain is very<br/>
&gt; huge when u get to high lvl.  Thus having max INT is the dream of all spell<br/>
&gt; casters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; H/w, on the other hand, having high mana is only useful if you dun frizzle<br/>
&gt; or get disturbed while casting.  For every failure to cast a spell, half<br/>
&gt; the mana (not too sure, but definitely there is a cap) will still be<br/>
&gt; consumed.  Thus having high DEX comes into the picture.  With high DEX, you<br/>
&gt; can cast faster (ie recover faster after u cast a spell b4 u can cast the<br/>
&gt; next one).  Not just that, high AGI is also important as it allow u to<br/>
&gt; avoid been hit by monsters, ie lesser chance to be disturbed while casting.<br/>
&gt;  Now thou I mentioned wiz sux big time in melee, there are still certain<br/>
&gt; time we have to help to &#39;tong&#39; for few seconds for our tanks to take a<br/>
&gt; break (like I sometime help to tank when my group paladin need a break to<br/>
&gt; use lay hand).  Thus having high AGI can &#39;lengthen&#39; ya duration for tanking<br/>
&gt; since u can last longer without been hit by monsters, or been hit less.  At<br/>
&gt; low lvl, AGI is actually quite important for ya survival coz many times u<br/>
&gt; will still have to depend on ya melee skills to help in a battle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, let us look at the races available for wiz (in this analysis I will<br/>
&gt; leave out STA, which is supposed to be a critical stats for wiz but I<br/>
&gt; really dun see its usefulness as compared to DEX & AGI at high lvl).  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; also assuming creating a &#39;more&#39; all-rounded wiz (ie high AGI and DEX) than<br/>
&gt; a nuke-only wiz.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. Dark Elf<br/>
&gt; DEX 90, AGI 75, INT 107 = 272, bonus point 30.<br/>
&gt; I think there is a ceiling for INT for each race but I&#39;m not too sure abt<br/>
&gt; DE.  In order to make a 90 DEX and 90 AGI, I will then left 122 for INT,<br/>
&gt; making it total for 3 stats is 302.<br/>
&gt; Plus point - ultravision, hide<br/>
&gt; Neg point - evil (but easiest to improve faction amg the 3 evil races,<br/>
&gt; unless u r a DEN).<br/>
&gt; On one hand this race got lesser INT then Erudite and Gnome, but looking in<br/>
&gt; deeper you will realise that this race got 2nd place in term of DAI<br/>
&gt; (Dex+Agi+Int) at 302.  It&#39;s also the only evil race available for wiz and<br/>
&gt; it give much role-play elements in this combo.  Comparing with DEN, DE wiz<br/>
&gt; will walk an easier path in gaining good faction with other races.  If you<br/>
&gt; wanna role-play an evil yet powerful (look cool too) wiz, this is the<br/>
&gt; number one choice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. Erudite<br/>
&gt; DEX 70, AGI 70, INT 115 = 255, bonus point 30.<br/>
&gt; Max INT u can have is 115+27=142 (dun ask me why, that&#39;s the max INT I can<br/>
&gt; get from my trial char).  The remaining 3 pts I put to DEX making it 73.<br/>
&gt;  So total of 3 stats = 285<br/>
&gt; Plus point - highest INT for all races<br/>
&gt; Neg point - No infravision<br/>
&gt; Everyone is talking about INT, and Erudite is alway been preceived to be<br/>
&gt; the most potential among all races to be a wiz.  But on a 2nd look, the DAI<br/>
&gt; only amount to 285, which put them #3 on the list, in par with high elf but<br/>
&gt; better than human.  The inability to look in the dark will also pose<br/>
&gt; problem in the early stage of ya game, esp b4 you get the Halo of Light<br/>
&gt; spell at lvl 12.  For those who used to have infravision char like me, this<br/>
&gt; handicap is unbearable!  With the newbie candle, I was whacked upside down<br/>
&gt; when I try to hunt in the night by 3-4 skeletons.  I have so much problem<br/>
&gt; finding my way back to my corpse and I just delete off my erudite wiz ;(<br/>
&gt; This race is very good if you have reliable companions who always hunt with<br/>
&gt; u and tank everything.  Only then you can show ya color with 142 INT,<br/>
&gt; without disturbance from monsters hit.  Once enaged in normal battle, you<br/>
&gt; will find yaself got hit very often and casting get disturbed regularly.<br/>
&gt;  If you intend to play as a normal wiz (ie soloing + grouping), this will<br/>
&gt; be a difficult race to play with.  H/w, once u reach high lvl where you<br/>
&gt; value lies only on nuking, it&#39;s very cool to have the largest mana pool on<br/>
&gt; you.  All you need is the endurance to last till that lvl, coz life is<br/>
&gt; gonna be VERY hard on you.  This is especially true in the begining stage,<br/>
&gt; as Erudin is an isolated isle with mainly spell caster classes.  Err, yes,<br/>
&gt; you are right, the land also produce paladin but who wanna be an Erudite<br/>
&gt; paladin? ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. Gnome<br/>
&gt; DEX 85, AGI 85, INT 108 = 278, bonus point 30.<br/>
&gt; Topping up my DEX & AGI to 90, I left 128 for INT, making it total of 308.<br/>
&gt; Plus point - infravision, tinkering, faction<br/>
&gt; Neg point - short, ugly, look dumb and weak<br/>
&gt; OK, I know this race is short, look dumb, look weak, and worst, his eye lvl<br/>
&gt; cannot even meet the breast of an half-elf ;(  But hey, looking into the<br/>
&gt; DAI this race is no doubt the most powerful &#39;potential&#39; archwizard!  No<br/>
&gt; doubt abt it.  With high INT, I can finish most of my foes so far b4 I used<br/>
&gt; up my mana.  With high DEX I cast fast and I seldom get disturbed due to my<br/>
&gt; high AGI.  Generally speaking, I stand a higher chance in surviving when<br/>
&gt; fighting opponents on par with me.<br/>
&gt; I personally feel that this race is the &#39;power&#39; race for most spell<br/>
&gt; casters, not just wiz.  The unqiue tinkering skill is also commonly<br/>
&gt; welcomed by most humaniod races (infravision goggles).<br/>
&gt; H/w, main problem with this race is the outlook.  If you wanna flirt with<br/>
&gt; female chars in this game, gnome is a no no for you.  I agreed with Leshrec<br/>
&gt; abt their dumb look, hehe.  Another advantage of gnome is its neutral<br/>
&gt; faction towards all other races (only dwarf and gnome enjoy such faction).<br/>
&gt;  They will not be KOS by any other races, thou they will be treated like<br/>
&gt; 2nd class citizens in evil race communities.  This make them a fairly easy<br/>
&gt; to travel spell casters.<br/>
&gt; Sight is also a problem at times, since you eye lvl is low and will face<br/>
&gt; difficulty in sighting incoming monsters.<br/>
&gt; Conclusion.  If you wanna make a easy-to-play, easy-to-travel, potential<br/>
&gt; &quot;powerplay&#39; wiz, this is the race for you.<br/>
&gt; NB:  Gnome got the highest vital stats total (INT & DEX) AND DAI score for<br/>
&gt; necromancer among all races.  Thus making it the #1 choice for necromancer<br/>
&gt; if u dun mind the look, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. High Elf<br/>
&gt; DEX 85, AGI 70, INT 100 = 255, bonus point 30.<br/>
&gt; Making 90 DEX and 90 AGI leave me 105 for INT, ie total of 285.<br/>
&gt; Plus point - Infravision, CHA<br/>
&gt; Neg point - low STR<br/>
&gt; They have the same DAI as erudite, with advantage of infravision and<br/>
&gt; weakness of low STR (meaning you can&#39;t carry too many loot and have to go<br/>
&gt; town sell often).  On the other hand, they high CHA amg all wiz allow them<br/>
&gt; to buy low sell high.  Basically my gnome wiz buy his lvl 2 scrolls 1 gp<br/>
&gt; higher than my high elf wiz.  EQ is quite balance - u carry less, you sell<br/>
&gt; high and buy low, OR you carry more, you sell low and buy high ;)<br/>
&gt; At STR55, my advice is to throw in at least 5 bonus points on STR, and that<br/>
&gt; leave me only 25 points for my AGI and INT ;(  Note that this is the only<br/>
&gt; race that give both high INT and WIS.  Too bad EQ do not have kickass<br/>
&gt; hybrid classes like figher/cleric/mage, cleric/mage, fighter/thief/mage as<br/>
&gt; in  AD&D, otherwise its high DEX, INT and WIS shld make it the most<br/>
&gt; powerful char of all times.<br/>
&gt; Nevertheless, HE is a &#39;high social&#39; race.  If you wanna role-play as a<br/>
&gt; flirting around playboy, this is the race to go for. ;P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5. Human<br/>
&gt; DEX 75, AGI 75, INT 85 = 235, bonus point 30.<br/>
&gt; Making 90 AGI and 90 DEX is totally impractical, which leave you with 85<br/>
&gt; INT.  Can forget abt human wiz, unless you are only concern abt gaining lvl<br/>
&gt; faster than other races. Yet with this kinda sucking stats, you wont go far<br/>
&gt; even you are given the previldge of gaining xp faster.<br/>
&gt; Huh?  You still want my comments on human wiz? FORGET it, I&#39;ve NO COMMENT!<br/>
&gt; ;-P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lastly, to answer ya stats qeries.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Agility<br/>
&gt; This is your physical dexterity and is used to determine your defensive<br/>
&gt; abilities. The higher your agility, the less likely you are to be hit by<br/>
&gt; melee combat. This attribute is critical for rogues, who rely on deftness.<br/>
&gt; (Note, getting less hits from monsters means your casting will not be<br/>
&gt; disturbed so often)<br/>
&gt; Dexterity<br/>
&gt; This is your hand-eye coordination and is used in combat accuracy and<br/>
&gt; spell-casting capability. It is used in calculating your missile combat<br/>
&gt; skills and aids in determining what happens if you are interrupted when you<br/>
&gt; are hit while casting a spell. (Note, this mean how fast you can recover<br/>
&gt; and get rdy to cast the next spell after been hit, been disturbed or<br/>
&gt; encounter failure in casting, something like spell delay in UO)<br/>
&gt; Stamina<br/>
&gt; This is your health and constitution. It reflects your ability to perform<br/>
&gt; strenuous tasks without becoming exhausted. It is also used in calculating<br/>
&gt; your hit points.  (Note, I personally feel that, for high lvl wiz, having<br/>
&gt; high AGI is more important than having high STA - coz it&#39;ll be better to<br/>
&gt; have a higher percentage to avoid monsters&#39; hits than to take a 100 dam hit<br/>
&gt; with additional 25 HP gain due to STA).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hey Fred, did u read the 146 pages EQ guide which I send u?  I got that<br/>
&gt; from Game Guide , took me more than 2 hrs to copy/paste and complie it<br/>
&gt; nicely.  I even print out and bind it as a book for my own study and<br/>
&gt; refernce.  I do have another 100 over pages binded EQ reference, which I<br/>
&gt; have spend few days to print out char guides, char creation, spells<br/>
&gt; description etc, all abt char development from many EQ sites.  Too bad I<br/>
&gt; have problem copy/paste those articles into MS word (due to the boxes they<br/>
&gt; use), thus I gotta print online.  This book contains lots of tricks, tips<br/>
&gt; and player guides, but no way for me to email u ;(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyyway, depending on individual playing style, you might not wanna put 90<br/>
&gt; stats for DEX and AGI, and leave more bonus point for ya INT.  But for me,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m very happy with the way things going so far.  In order to carry more<br/>
&gt; loot, I also throw 5 points to my STR, making it 65 and my INT 123 instead<br/>
&gt; of 128.  That&#39;s all I can share for spell casters.  U might wanna consider<br/>
&gt; all these points for your necromancer ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; i personally think that getting others to join the guild (even if non-sg)<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; a good idea... esp when one need to get someone to team up fer<br/>
&gt; adventure...<br/>
&gt; &gt; although the guild might be sg based... :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyway.. LKW... have u tried surviving with a Erudite Wizard? isit that<br/>
&gt; &gt; difficult without light? is ultravision or infravision that good? but<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the additional INT u find any use? basically can anyone tell me at what<br/>
&gt; DEX,<br/>
&gt; &gt; AGI, or INT or whatever... what kinda gains can u have? i dont seems to<br/>
&gt; find<br/>
&gt; &gt; those in any web sites so far... the only findings i have is that from 70<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; 75 there isnt a big difference... only when 70 to 80 then its more<br/>
&gt; obvious.<br/>
&gt; &gt; i guess this also helps in creating new chars... wonder if anyone have<br/>
&gt; any<br/>
&gt; &gt; info on this...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; cheers,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Wonder if u let non-Singaporean come in?  I came across some nice<br/>
&gt; players<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in Prexus, and it will be great if them join us.  My UO guild also<br/>
&gt; started<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as a local only guild, but as time goes by, more foreigners join us.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Depending on the player, some can be very loyal when u accept them<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they are still newbie.  95% of our pioneer members either quited UO or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; still with the guild.<br/>
