<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-174397957">Hi guys,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tested last night, from I login till I logout, I can solo both Ulir <br/>
and Ein at WK using DD and Jboot.  However, the down time is too long (Ulir <br/>
need 2.5 bubb mana on avaerage, and Ein need 4 bubb mana).  The worst case <br/>
is I managed to kill Ein with OOM.<br/>
<br/>
Considering the long down time of mediating after taking every Ein, I <br/>
invited a lvl 31 driud, helping him to snare Ulir for him to kite.  Then <br/>
once he finish Ulir, I will start on Ein.<br/>
<br/>
This is a pretty good lvling method, as both of us enjoyed fast xp last <br/>
night.  Now I would like to invite any lvl 30ish member who can join me for <br/>
training.  I dun mind taking more fraction hits for snaring Ulir, coz the <br/>
loneliness is really driving me mad, esp when the perverts are not online <br/>
to spam the guildsay.<br/>
<br/>
Another alternative is another lvl 35-40 member, we team and take Ulir and <br/>
Ein together.  Shouldn&#39;t be a problem, this method dun even need kiting.<br/>
<br/>
So, anyone interested?<br/>
<br/>

The lonely kiting pervert in WK<br/>

p/s: My login time will be S&#39;pore time 9pm till 1am.  So guys, I&#39;m coming <br/>
back for good.  Any spare stuffs pls donate to me lah! ;P</div>
