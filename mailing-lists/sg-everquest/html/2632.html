<b>Subject:</b> @#$%^%#@#@# Gm event in Prexus <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971663934">Man the GMs in Prexus sucks to the max.They had a DarkElves invasion on Highhold and guess what..<br/>
<br/>
There are only 5Darkelves called TierDal Elite that slashes for 117dmg PER hit,and cast 500dmg+ spells...this is ridiculous..its UNWINNABLE and the GMs didnt think what level range guys would be doing in highhold..this sucks and worst of all u lose XPs...OMG[I died in 3secs ..]<br/>
<br/>
What a lame GM event,anyone participated in it too?heard it happened in all servers.<br/>
<br/>
