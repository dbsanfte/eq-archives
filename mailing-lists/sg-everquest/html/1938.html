<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169202512">Anyone got any reseach tips to share?  How to train it and how much skill u <br/>
need b4 u got a high chance (say 80%) to research a particular lvl spell?<br/>
<br/>
Believe it or not, at lvl 29 I never do a single research so far and I got <br/>
all the necessary spells (as a nuker and traveller) I need, either buying <br/>
from wiz guild or getting from &#39;some&#39; other sources ;)<br/>
<br/>
Say now I never train or use research skill b4, shld I dump in max skill <br/>
points (and pay pp also) to max out the skill 1st, or ???<br/>
<br/>
TIA!<br/>

p/s: VS guild is formed last night, with 10 kakis, with GM Sereph the flat <br/>
chest babe, hehe.  To faciliate discussion with non SG kakis (FF & DF) and <br/>
SG kakis in overseas (Nica), I propose a guild chat in EQ over the weekend <br/>
to sort things out, preferably last night Fri or Sat.</div>
