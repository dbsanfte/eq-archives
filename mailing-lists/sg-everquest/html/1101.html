<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501866102">Yep, so far I got some of my stuffs from garren, leshrec & yy.  When I get <br/>
better stuff, I pass down the old one to our own kakis instead of selling <br/>
it away.  I think this kinda tradition must be maintained and established <br/>
further - all kakis help one another.  Isn&#39;t it one of the main reasons we <br/>
all play in the same server? ;)<br/>
