<b>Subject:</b> RE: How many of u guys at Tribunal? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-122942126">Ah, now I get wat u mean.  U mean the economy is screwed in all older <br/>
servers, not just Inno ;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure abt how the pie tin thingy can earn u 10,000s of pp a night <br/>
(sure or not?) last time, but talk abt brewing, it really give good money <br/>
for LOW lvls.  At mid lvl onwards, it will be more fruitful to hunt rather <br/>
than to trade.  H/w, the joy of trade skills is not only earn money, I <br/>
personally feel the satisfaction of been a master in some trade skills. <br/>
 None of my trade skills can give my more than 30pp a night of 4 hrs now, <br/>
but I&#39;m still willing to max them out when I have the money to spend on raw <br/>
material.  Reason is simply personal satisfaction.  The only regret I have <br/>
is tat wiz is unable to train in jewel crafting (can make but cant enchant) <br/>
and tinkering.  ;(<br/>
<br/>
As for ya remarks....<br/>
<br/>
1. EQ is all abt lvl. Quite true, unlike UO we got more things (eg GM trade <br/>
skils, vendor, properties) there.  H/w, there will also be a stage in UO <br/>
where u achieved everything u want and in the end feel so aimless and <br/>
boring, just to login every week to refresh houses.  I think Verant <br/>
initially wanna make lvl so difficult tat it will take a a yr to gain lvl <br/>
50 but things just dun turn out that way.<br/>
<br/>
2. So far enchanter is still making good money, and gnome&#39;s thinkering is <br/>
still not explored much yet.<br/>
<br/>
3. I think local kakis is lucky in the sense that server is least packed <br/>
when we play from 7pm to 10pm.  So far my gang camp few days in Najena and <br/>
only 1 time there is a DE magi b4 us.  Nica u may know her - Vampira, from <br/>
ya DE guild in Inno.  She is so scare tat she start shouting over the zone <br/>
b4 we nuke her kills, annoucing all that we are KSers, lol.  She is yellow <br/>
to me and FF at tat time, who r the highest lvl in the grp - she is damn no <br/>
ball, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
4. It&#39;s more like a &#39;grass is greener elsewhere&#39; sydrome ;)  Tanks is so <br/>
much better than casters at early stages, but we still see lots of casters <br/>
out there ;)  Necro and Magi is so much better than wiz and enchanter in <br/>
the newbie stage, but we still see tons of wiz and enchanters ard.  Druid <br/>
is getting dd as powerful as wiz, only 5 lvl behind, not to forget they can <br/>
buff, can kite, melee.  Even if Verant nerfs kiting, druid is still a very <br/>
powerful class to play.  Talk abt necro, u think the Dot is nerfed, but you <br/>
still got a pet.  Ya pet normally got higher lvl than magi&#39;s pet, not <br/>
forgeting that you can tap-life-heal-yaself.  At lvl 49 u can drain life <br/>
from a party of mob at the same time.  So u think wiz&#39;s dd is cool, but <br/>
have u thot of we fighting a mob and they killed us with only 3% hp left? <br/>
 Necro, on the other hand, can hurt mob and at the same time, drain HP. <br/>
 Not to forget u have a pet to tank for u.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
5. I think both UO and EQ are equally good, coz they belongs to 2 different <br/>
kinda online RPG.  Again, &quot;grass is greener elsewhere&quot; sydrome, hehe.  UO <br/>
got lag, I mean BAD lag, blue pker, house breakin etc problems.  I think <br/>
sometime we have to be firm on what we wanna be, and I admit this is not <br/>
easy.  Once we set our mind to play certain char, I believe we can do it <br/>
well.  Of coz, sometime u will make a wrong decision in select the wrong <br/>
class/race, but human ma, sure got mistake.  Try again lor, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
As for magical items, there are alot out there, much more than UO I think. <br/>
 U just need the lvl to hunt for them, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Wiz can solo sometime, in certain situation.  We are good in places with <br/>
fixed number of spawns, which mobs tat hit hard but low HP (eg treant <br/>
camp).  If u ask a lvl 31 warrior to solo 2 treants, he will died much <br/>
faster than he can heck the trees.  Lvl 31 wiz, on the other hand, can solo <br/>
2 trees, since we nuke faster than treants nuke us.  In train-proned <br/>
dungeons or places with random spawn, tanks can outshine us.  I think that <br/>
EQ classes are pretty balance, just tat u have to look for a situation <br/>
which benefit u most.<br/>
<br/>
Ziltus<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hmm, u mentioned that Inno economy is all screwed, can u elaborate abit<br/>
&gt; &gt; more?  *scratch head* ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I feel tat every servers will ultimately grow &quot;mature&quot;, meaning more<br/>
&gt; &gt; twinked chars will show up as the time goes by.<br/>

&gt; &gt; create new char, we help to twink abit, and delete char to re-create<br/>
&gt; &gt; another one and expect twinking again, then it&#39;s not tat fair to those<br/>
