;)<br/>
<br/>
JA2 is very very cool.  I&#39;m also looking for Homeworld, heard it&#39;s also <br/>
very cool from some UO kakis.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, one way to judge if ya enemies can shoot you is whether they look <br/>
red/black to you, just like how u decide if u can shoot them.  This is just <br/>
a 70% rough guide, since sometime ya enemies on roof they can see you but <br/>
not vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
Hey I forget how to climb to roof, can teach me?  During my 1st mission I <br/>
did it once, coz one enemy on roof, but later forget how to go abt doing it <br/>
again ;)  CGW Nov issue has some good tips on how to rise ya merc&#39;s stats <br/>
and skills.  Worth take a look.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend I will play Baldur&#39;s gate expansion : Sword Coast while <br/>
waiting for the major UO item patch.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think I&#39;ve stopped playing EQ for almost 2 weeks or more, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; surprisingly I didn&#39;t missed it at all.  ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; I login UO once every 2-3 nights, to help my UO guild to settle some<br/>
&gt; &gt; training and guild matters, I play Jagged Alliance 2 (wow it&#39;s a damn <br/>

&gt; I seem to have got what you&#39;ve got, Ziltus... this &quot;Bored-with-<br/>
&gt; levelling-and-nothing-much-else-to-do&quot; EQ disease... you pass to<br/>
&gt; me one isit?! *heh*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I really enjoy JA2 too... I enjoy it so much, I bought the<br/>
&gt; original one... :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Frankly, the only gripe I have about the game is that it&#39;s hard to tell<br/>
&gt; whether the enemy can or cannot shoot you if you hide behind this<br/>
&gt; rock, or that tree...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also recently acquired Homeworld... this RTS not easy man...<br/>
