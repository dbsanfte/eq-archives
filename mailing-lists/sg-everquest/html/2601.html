Please stay. Play a druid ....until a new game is out.....but then agin..its<br/>
probably a good reason to leave EQ...<br/>
<br/>
Thx for alll your assists in the early days where there&#39;s only a few of us<br/>
local kakis (3 i think) in Innorruk. i was a monk then and u gave me a<br/>
earring and some gp.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;&gt;         Dued to my failure at PoF which got alot of ppl into trouble<br/>
&gt;(which<br/>
&gt;&gt; involved dying and losing the major portion of their stuff) and with<br/>
&gt;little<br/>
&gt;&gt; else to do (except like camping for stuff, which I have gotten very sick<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;&gt; tired of), I have cancelled my account as from today, Oct 26th 1999.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;         Please help me tell the follow people of my quiting and hope to<br/>
&gt;see<br/>
&gt;&gt; them again sometime on another game another time and Best wishes to them.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;         Everquest was, had been and enjoyable game at the beginning but<br/>
&gt;due<br/>
&gt;&gt; to the way that the game is designed it reminds me more of Evercamp,<br/>
&gt;&gt; Everbitch etc etc. It has become a torture to enter the &quot;game&quot; each day<br/>
&gt;now.<br/>
&gt;&gt; This incident has at least freed me from Evercrack as some would say it<br/>
&gt;is.<br/>
&gt;&gt; So farewell my fellow guildmates. And may your time in Everquest be as<br/>
&gt;your<br/>
&gt;&gt; first day, with new and exciting adventures each day.<br/>
