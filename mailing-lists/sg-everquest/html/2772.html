<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761632517">My cleric in EQ hit 50 donkey weeks ago........ And I still think pokemon is<br/>
evil, read this:<br/>
<br/>
* In South Carolina a 14-year-old stands<br/>
 accused of smashing a store window to steal<br/>
 $250 worth of Pok´┐¢mon cards ´┐¢ ignoring<br/>
 thousands of dollars worth of rare coins as he did so.<br/>
<br/>
 * Four children from one school in Philadelphia<br/>
 have been arrested for attacks upon other students.<br/>
 The motive for the assaults was to steal Pok´┐¢mon cards.<br/>
<br/>
 *Just last Thursday a man in North Carolina<br/>
 was charged with assault upon a Burger King<br/>
 cashier after he struck the cashier when he<br/>
 did not receive a Pok´┐¢mon toy with his meal.<br/>
<br/>
 *At Wilson Middle School, Philadelphia two<br/>
 boys assaulted an 11-year-old with a trash<br/>
 can before running off with two Pok´┐¢mon<br/>
 cards. The boys were arrested and charged<br/>
 with robbery as well as being suspended for<br/>
 five days.<br/>
<br/>
 * In Quebec a boy was stabbed with a<br/>
 four-inch knife when trying to retrieve the<br/>
 Pok´┐¢mon cards that had been stolen from his<br/>
 10-year old brother the day before.<br/>
<br/>
All from fgnonline a while back........ Bet there&#39;s some subliminal msg hidden<br/>
in that game that promotes violence......<br/>
