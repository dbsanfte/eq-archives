<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809959102">Heh theres no mob in Mistmoore called Mayong Mistmoore. Though mistmoore<br/>
stuff belong to Mayong Mistmoore faction, believed to be a level 53 vampire.<br/>
But in actual fact, Mistmoore is a very easy dungeon to solo at level 50...<br/>
about 95% of the mobs in the castle are level 35 or below. Only problem is<br/>
that you need to have wolf form and havent ruined mistmoore faction before<br/>
so you dont agro everything around you.<br/>
<br/>
Alliwaezeur (sp?) is always level 50 but has much less hp than an average<br/>
level 50 mob... necro and maybe shamans are the only classes able to solo a<br/>
level 50 mob in 1 round without going oom<br/>
<br/>
For gator armor in Uguk, i recommend at least 39.... new nuke and you should<br/>
be able to solo a level 30 ancient croc with root nuke<br/>
<br/>
For runed circlet, 32+? is good enough when you get your fire nuke and able<br/>
to solo pull the mobs (ie. all green)<br/>
<br/>
For fishbone earring, you almost must have jboots/sow or Rephas, an<br/>
enchanter beside Hadden is green to you so he wouldn&#39;t jump into the<br/>
fight... About high 30s for Rephas to be green to you i think...<br/>
<br/>
Wk ogre shaman you need about level 48+ to solo. 1) The 4 ogre guards will<br/>
agro everyone within their HUGE agro radius (as huge as the furthest point<br/>
you can nuke them from) 2) If the ogre guards are green only 1 will come<br/>
after you and give you a nasty HT 3) Magic resist gear is very important<br/>
since you are taking a lot of HTs 4) If the shamans and chief goonda is<br/>
still blue to you they will jump in as well 5) Assuming you are level 48+<br/>
where everything is green to you, you pull 1 ogre guard, kill, 1 ogre guard,<br/>
then try to pull either goonda or the shaman directly beside him. 6) Ultra<br/>
tough camp if you are soloing.. no clarity and no heal and hard to keep up<br/>
with spawns 7) Very long spawn time...<br/>
<br/>
OOT oracle and his body guard. oracle is 35 guard is 42. lose neriak<br/>
merchants faction i think when you kill them. I recommend only trying them<br/>
after getting ice comet as oracle is a nuker. Elemental shield and<br/>
diamondskin up. Root the guard. And kite the oracle using root nuke or run<br/>
nuke. After oracle is dead immediately gate out or if you feel confident you<br/>
can kill the guard who drops standard level 40+ mob jewelry (mithril amulet<br/>
92pp to merchants) If root breaks then you have to be skilful to try to root<br/>
the guard without taking too much damage from oracleagain.....<br/>
<br/>
OOT dunnoe what ogre heh but theres a special named Hill Giant who spawns<br/>
very often.. Kite nuke at level 49+ with ice comet<br/>
<br/>
No pet in unrest means serious downtime for you have to clear all the<br/>
greenies. But if you intend to camp the undead knight theres a trick... At<br/>
about level 40 where most mobs are green to you, cast levitate on yourself<br/>
and walk to the hill with a stream downwards in the garden (east of the<br/>
map), standing at the highest point of the small hill, you can target the<br/>
knight or his ph and nuke it, after a while the knight will go down the<br/>
stairs and come out the door and look for you, since all mobs should be<br/>
green nothing will agro you and you can kite nuke in the garden. Seems like<br/>
normal invis works for about 40% of the mobs (the weaker mobs like mummies<br/>
and dark bones) in there.<br/>
<br/>
Befallen is pretty easy but you have to find a good place to med or else you<br/>
will get whacked. Level 30+ you can solo everything including bottom floor.<br/>
<br/>
Sola .. some parts like foreman and predator only need about 30+ to solo<br/>
camp but if you wanna do lava elemental, gabbie and maybe some parts of the<br/>
castle, you will need to have ice comet...<br/>
<br/>
SG is simply kite nuke kite nuke but bad xp and not efficient in terms of<br/>
time you have to med up (SG has much more hp than same level mob) / heal up<br/>
(if you get hit) / and the time you spend trying to gain speed so you can<br/>
nuke the SG<br/>
<br/>
Maybe SolB you can do that since bugs section is pretty close to lavastorm<br/>
zone line. Maybe can pull bats, beetles and if you feel powerful you can try<br/>
lava duct crawlers...<br/>

Subject: [sg-everquest] Hunting questions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The lvl 50ishs in guild always busy hunting in planes or dragons, ever<br/>
&gt; thought of hunting some other lvl 50ish+ mobs in Norrath?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Eg<br/>
&gt; - &quot;Gozilla&quot; (a dinosaur) in OOT, &gt;lvl 50<br/>
&gt; - Mist Castle Lord, the lvl 50 dracula<br/>
&gt; - etc<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Btw, what&#39;s the min lvl for wiz to solo the following zones/mobs:<br/>
&gt; - Lguk (think it&#39;s time to camp for some gator armors)<br/>
&gt; - Permafrost (for runed circlet)<br/>
&gt; - Hadden (for fishbone earring)<br/>
&gt; - WK Ogre shaman (for batskull earring, what&#39;s the min lvl for me to<br/>
attack<br/>
&gt; ths shaman while the other 5 guards won&#39;t swarm against me?)<br/>
&gt; - OOT Oracle and her body guard (heard oracle robe is good money)<br/>
&gt; - OOT ogre and hill giant<br/>
&gt; - Unrest<br/>
&gt; - Befallen<br/>
&gt; - Sol A<br/>
&gt; - SG in Sro/Oasis (kite and nuke)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thx.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p/s: Any high lvl zone spot where PL-trainer can pull a red mob (con to<br/>
lvl<br/>
&gt; 40ish), whack it to 10% HP, zone and let us finish it to get the &quot;reb mob&quot;<br/>
&gt; xp? ;)<br/>
