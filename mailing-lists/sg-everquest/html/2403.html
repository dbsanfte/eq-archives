<div id="ygrps-yiv-625097685">Sabella Anna Estasis is the FULL name of my enchanter. At 20, you get a last name<br/>
for your character, which in my case is &quot;Estasis&quot;, and the middle name &quot;Anna&quot; was<br/>
granted by a GM for &quot;special condition&quot; since my character plays a part in some<br/>
of the GM runed event in CT.<br/>
<br/>
Just run a /who Sabella all or /who enchanter 50 all to locate me, but I&#39;m not<br/>
playing much in CT lately. Only log in when the bastard GMs need me to talk cock<br/>
or twinker me, dragon slaying or duelings. Nowadays, spent the bulk of my time in<br/>
Inno with my level 34 Cleric Fesse Estasis(alright, start your power leveling<br/>
complains now!)<br/>
<br/>
Come over to Inno or Prexus lah. CT has a very low porpulation of S&#39;porean. Seen<br/>
only 2 so far, and have already forgotten their names.<br/>

&gt; What is your name in game? Sabella? Anna? Or Estasis? I look for you<br/>
&gt; everytime I log on and cannot see you playing leh. BTW, the guild in Innoruk<br/>
&gt; active anot? I got a low (very low) level Druid in Innoruk. If guild active<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll consider switching server, if not active one I stay in CT play liao.<br/>
&gt; BTW, any other Singaporeans in CT? I know there&#39;s another Troll/Ogre by the<br/>
&gt; name of Ungaroth. Met him once, but that time don&#39;t know he is a<br/>
&gt; Singaporean. Got any other anot?<br/>
