<div id="ygrps-yiv-495789910">Errrr At level 16, you can only buy the Air pet(or is it water.......)<br/>
pet. At 20, you can only buy the water pet and have to research the<br/>
rest. At 24, all you pet spells must be researched.<br/>
<br/>
Researching means you have to hunt around for the items needed then<br/>
combine then to create the spell, and like all skills, it can fail.<br/>
Also, spell components spawn quite rarely.<br/>
<br/>
So that are the hidden spells.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing they recently did was to give Magician pets the ability<br/>
to cast spells, which is still under going fixing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Magicians are one of the more porpular classes in EQ, why the<br/>
heck would Verant make them super strong and leave the poor<br/>
enchanters/rogues to nothing?<br/>

&gt; that Varent has more surprises fer Magician than what we have seen....<br/>
&gt; i suppose some &#39;hidden&#39; spells... or some boost fer em at some<br/>
&gt; stages... but then... thast a paper fer mages... so i suppose they<br/>
&gt; wanted to encourage more folks to take up as i believe there r only a<br/>
&gt; small community playing em... ALSO, i believe.. necros, enchanters, or<br/>
&gt; wizard should have that kinda stuff as well... its just a different<br/>
&gt; quest... or just somewhere u have to go... or something u have to<br/>
&gt; do... BUT nevertheless... that has somewhat encouraged me to take up<br/>
&gt; the mage... instead of sticking with the necro... since u guys r all<br/>
&gt; soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo &#39;holy&#39;... i guess it will take ages b4<br/>
&gt; my necro can venture with u guys... so a mage might be a better<br/>
&gt; choice... YES! a High Elf Mage :) any comments on<br/>
&gt; that? cheers,Fred--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
