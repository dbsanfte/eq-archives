<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975094490">I heard about that too, some other PC said it was anti-camping code. So while hunting at the bandits camp now, we sit far back from the camp so that it will give more bronze. Not sure if its true, but no harm trying though.<br/>

    Secondly,hard to xplain this..heh..here goes<br/>
    U see,when u camp for an item,it always seems to take years to spawn but when u are not expecting it or just going there to give one try and see if the special mob is spawned,it ALWAYS seemed to have the item but when u plan plan then ready for 24hrs camp,its always not there...This is just what I observed..is there some sort of camping code that verant had set up?<br/>
