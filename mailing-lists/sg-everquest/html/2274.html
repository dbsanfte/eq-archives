  <br/>
  hi all,<br/>
  check out this i copied from the necro board... wahahah ...damn funny...<br/>
  Welcome to Real Life!<br/>
  You have entered the bedroom.<br/>
  /time<br/>
  It is 06:30AM, August 31,1999.<br/>
  It begins to rain.<br/>
  (alarm clock is sounding)<br/>
  You can&#39;t reach that from here.<br/>
  /attack<br/>
  Your target is too far away, get closer!<br/>
  You punch an alarm clock for 12 points of damage.<br/>
  You have slain an alarm clock!<br/>
  you are encumbered.<br/>
  (kicks off sheets)<br/>
  (makes way to bathroom)<br/>
  A chair hits your toe for 44 points of damage.<br/>
  You are stunned.<br/>
  /attack<br/>
  You cannot attack while stunned.<br/>
  You throw a chair into the hall.<br/>
  A chair died.<br/>
  (makes way to kitchen)<br/>
  (opens fridge and sees leftover turkey)<br/>
  /con<br/>
  It is futile to consider the dead...<br/>
  (smells bad)<br/>
  You may not loot this corpse at this time.<br/>
  You are hungry.<br/>
  You are thirsty.<br/>
  (forgets breakfast, begins to iron shirt)<br/>
  You are burned.<br/>
  An iron burns you for 3 points of damage.<br/>
  (irons shirt, then realizes it doesnt match pants)<br/>
  You may not equip this item.<br/>
  These items did not combine in these quantities to produce anything.<br/>
  (you leave for work)<br/>
  ZONING...PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
  You are slammed by an intense gust of wind.<br/>
  (you finally arrive late to work)<br/>
  /con<br/>
  A co-worker regards you dubiously, looks like a reasonably safe opponent.<br/>
  /con<br/>
  A boss scowls at you ready to attack. What would you like your tombstone to say.<br/>
  A boss says &quot;Why are you always late?&quot;<br/>
  /tell boss &quot;Why are you always an ass?&quot;<br/>
  (target boss)<br/>
  /gesture<br/>
  You make a rude gesture at a boss.<br/>
  A boss says &quot;I&#39;ll teach you to interfere with me!&quot;<br/>
  A boss says &quot;You&#39;re fired!&quot;<br/>
  Your faction standing with Friends, Family, Coworkers just got worse.<br/>
  You lose experience. You have lost a level! You are now level 19.<br/>
  LOADING. PLEASE WAIT... <br/>
<br/>
  cheers,<br/>
<br/>
  Fred<br/>
