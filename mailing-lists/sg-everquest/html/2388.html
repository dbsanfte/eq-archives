&gt;<br/>
&gt; As you all know by now, alot of quest artifacts are now NODROP,<br/>
&gt; and that includes the Koalindl Fish Corpse that is so crucial to the<br/>
&gt; Glowing Stein quest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So the sequence goes like this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fish corpse NODROP (plus some other items) -----&gt; Bartender&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Compendium NODROP in Freeport.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bartender&#39;s Compendium NODROP ------&gt; Glowing Stein in Oggok<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As you can see, the chain of items is NODROP all the way. This<br/>
&gt; makes it alot trickier, since the person who eventually goes to<br/>
&gt; Oggok (most likely an enchanter or someone with good faction with<br/>
&gt; ogres) MUST be the one to loot the fish for it&#39;s corpse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only safe way around this is to again use the mule character<br/>
&gt; tactic, but this time, the person actually doing the quest must be<br/>
&gt; there, ready to pounce and loot the fish corpse. The corpse will be<br/>
&gt; lootable solely by the person who gets the kill/xp, for the first 2<br/>
&gt; minutes, after which it becomes free-looting. So all you have to do<br/>
&gt; is wait for 2 minutes... This method has been confirmed through<br/>
&gt; testing by me, Sereph and Trifrost. Just watch out for other players<br/>
&gt; waiting for such an oppurtunity as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; An alternative method, which has not been tested, and could have<br/>
&gt; more potential risk, is to group with the mule character who kills<br/>
&gt; the fish, but stay far far away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Theoretically, because you do not personally initiate combat with<br/>
&gt; the fish, the guards/clerics/paladins should not KOS you, and you<br/>
&gt; should not get faction hits. But you should still be able to loot the<br/>
&gt; corpse since you are in the same group as the killer, so no need to<br/>
&gt; wait for 2 minutes. This method not tested yet...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s all for now I guess...<br/>
