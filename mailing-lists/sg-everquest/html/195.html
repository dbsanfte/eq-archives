<div id="ygrps-yiv-925097644">It&#39;s best to solo and hunt near to guard at lvl 1-5.  Once u reached lvl 6, <br/>
u can start to group with others to hunt for more powerful monsters (coz <br/>
those monsters u initially hunt will no longer give u good XP).  In order <br/>
to survive tougher monsters, best u got 2 tanks, 1 healer with u in a <br/>
group. Spell casters r optional (sad to say it) coz they only add 1/4 of <br/>
the total firepower in a group. Spell casters are much more useful at lvl 8 <br/>
and above as they start to cast much more powerful spells (much more power <br/>
becoz we use to have dam 15 spells up to lvl 7, once lvl 8, we can blast <br/>
45max per spells).  That&#39;s why when I&#39;m lvl 7 and below, I&#39;ve a very hard <br/>
time to get (or beg?) some group to let me in.  Even at lvl 8-11, we still <br/>
need a group with at least a tank and a healer.  No doubt we can help in <br/>
wiping monsters in a much faster rate, we still cannot solo or team with <br/>
other spell casters only.  After all, once our mana gone, we r as weak as <br/>
babies ;(<br/>
<br/>
Having a lvl 8 and above spell casters is good coz they increase the speed <br/>
for the team in wiping monsters (which mean the rate of earning  XP).  At <br/>
high lvl, no other class can kill as many monsters and as fast we we can. <br/>
H/w, spell casters always have a moment when we are weak - when we sit down <br/>
and mediate for mana.  At this time, our mana is low, and our view is <br/>
blocked by spell book.  This is the time we need tanks to protect us.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I like very much abt EQ is that it really emphasise alot on team <br/>
work.  W/o spell casters, tanks, thou can kill alot of monsters, but not at <br/>
a fast rate as with a spell casters in the group.  W/o tank, spell casters <br/>
will soon die due to lack of &#39;blockage&#39; and mana.  Best group I&#39;ve come <br/>
across is:<br/>
- 2 tanks (warrior/paladin/ranger)<br/>
- 2 melee healers (cleric/druid)<br/>
- 2 spell caster (wiz, magi, enchanter)<br/>
<br/>
Other than Leshrec, anyone else play at G.Faydark?  Best near Felwithe.<br/>
