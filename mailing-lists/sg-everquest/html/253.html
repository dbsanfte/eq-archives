<b>Subject:</b> Gaining lvl in group hunting, my 2´┐¢ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460035306">Even thou&#39; EQ allow bigger lvl gap in group for high lvl players, I <br/>
personally still find it better to stick close to 2 or less for lvl 10 & <br/>
below group.  I was grouping with Eldor (lvl 12) and Yiyang (lvl 14~15) <br/>
over the weekend, and I&#39;m lvl 9.  No doubt I got the gaining XP msg, but as <br/>
a whole my xp gain very slow.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand I solo last night fighting only rattlesnake (blue/green <br/>
to me), my xp gain faster.  This shows that no doubt grouping allows u to <br/>
hunt more powerful monsters, but it&#39;s more advisable to hunt with someone <br/>
close to you lvl.  Yiyang and I also try a trick he mentioned previously - <br/>
ie we group and fight a monster, b4 the monster dies, he quit from group <br/>
and let me get the xp.  Np doubt I will get the xp but I think it&#39;s still <br/>
lesser from my solo hunt last night.  I think this trick dones&#39;t work very <br/>
well, but I must thank Yiyang for his time training me and let me getting <br/>
the loot ;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve decided to delete Zilred (enchanter tonight) and concentrate on my <br/>
wiz.  Can someone help me to transfer items from Zilred to Ziltus tonight? <br/>
 Both are now at Freeport. Actually Zilred got nothing much except few <br/>
cloth and a staff, but I really need $$$ badly to buy scrolls.  Lvl 9 now <br/>
but my lvl 3 spells are not even half-filled, sigh.<br/>
<br/>
For those lvl 8-9 players (lvl 8 tank and lvl 9 mages), the desert behind <br/>
inn 2 of east commonland is quite a nice place to hunt solo.  U still have <br/>
to con the skeleton and rattlesnake b4 u fight them, thou&#39; so far most r <br/>
blue to me.  When fighting rattlesnake, make sure you life never drop below <br/>
2.5 bubbles coz if it poisons u b4 it die, the poison will take around 1 <br/>
bubble (for a weak wiz like me) b4 it cure by itself.  The snake skin can <br/>
be found quite easily and cost 1 gp each.  Occasionally u can also find <br/>
puma there, which is less dangerous than rattlesnake.  H/w, the spot is <br/>
pretty close to a mummy lair, u gotta be careful when hunting there coz <br/>
sometime mummy will come out and it&#39;s agro.  I got killed 3 times last <br/>
night by mummy while fighting snake/skeletonm, but the place is pretty <br/>
close to freeport gate so running there is not a problem.  Most of the time <br/>
if u r alert, you shld be able to run back to the inn and let the guard <br/>
protect u (not when u are stunned by mummy, like in my case).  As wiz has <br/>
very low HP and AC, I have to mediate after every 1-2 battle.  Also note <br/>
that graffin visit inn 2 quite often (as compared with inn 4 which I hunted <br/>
earlier).  If u wanna see guard died, stay there for 10~15 min and u will <br/>
get to see the big fight between graffin and guard, hehe, of coz guard <br/>
always got killed lor ;)  Due to the danger outside inn, it&#39;s safer to <br/>
maediate INSIDE inn.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing, try not to attack asp even thou it&#39;s con blue to u.  This <br/>
CB snake is damn poisonous as compare to rattlesnake.  Once poisoned, it <br/>
will drain up to 2.5 bubbles HP.  And remember this (&%&$^%#@# Arrowmage, I <br/>
think he is a lvl 20~30 char.  I was poisoned last night by an asp and <br/>
managed to run back to inn but my HP keep dropping very fast.  I keep <br/>
asking him to heal me and he simply bo chap.  He stand and see my HP keep <br/>
dropping steady.  Lucky the poison cure by itself when I left 5 HP!  He <br/>
then ask &quot;help of what huh?&quot;, damn KNN CB.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if you meet a lvl 15 lady wood elf druid at freeport <br/>
gate, name Arsafil, greet her nicely.  She is a very helpful Japanese <br/>
player who have help me several times.  She always give food/drink to me, <br/>
not 5 or 10 each but 20~30 each!  She will also bind/SoW/armor/invis u for <br/>
free if u ask her, one of the nicest helpful players I met in EQ.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Any lvl 8~10 players wanna group hunting in EC?<br/>
<br/>
Ziltus.</div>
