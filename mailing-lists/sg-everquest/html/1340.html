<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501066995">Okay, about credit cards. I will not be entering your credit card<br/>
number. If you are willing to help, I&#39;ll send you my The Station user<br/>
name and password.<br/>
<br/>
All you have to do is to edit my account info,  by filling in the credit<br/>
card number and your house address.<br/>
<br/>
The info will be sent to Sony and no matter what i do, I can&#39;t check the<br/>
number oif the credit card. If you don&#39;t believe, try to edit your own<br/>
account. It won&#39;t show you the number.<br/>
<br/>
And now on Guk.<br/>
<br/>
I have a rough plan up now *search around and pull out an A0 size paper<br/>
covered with tiny words*<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see.... First off, I need to know the agility(modified and<br/>
unmodified) of the following tanks. This is to determind who be primary<br/>
tank and who be the secondary one<br/>
<br/>
Garren<br/>
Yiyang<br/>
Aaleku<br/>
Yutaka<br/>
Kenven/Kellindel<br/>
Sunblade<br/>
<br/>
Next, int value of these nukers, so that I can plan what time you guys<br/>
should nuke (remember guk has a high spawn rate. Nuking on site is too<br/>
mana ineffective)<br/>
<br/>
Ziltus<br/>
Leshrec<br/>
Nicademous<br/>
Zanderion<br/>
Kalandra<br/>
<br/>
Wis base casters don&#39;t need to report. See your face knows how much mana<br/>
you have already.<br/>
<br/>
Each group there, will have to assign someone to be the &quot;kamikaze<br/>
piolet&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Function of this guy? If a big train is started, this guy will be<br/>
responsible of taunting the WHOLE train, and die, while the rest<br/>
gate/run out.<br/>
<br/>
For the 20+ group, I&#39;ll volunteer for this since I get a incredible 50%<br/>
exp bonus while in a full group and my area effect DOT songs can taunt<br/>
like no tomorrow. For the other 2, decide who gets to die among<br/>
yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Now on supplies. The 2 magician and 3(2 if Neriss go MIA) wis base<br/>
casters will be required to provide enought supplies to last the whole<br/>
gang. Nicademous, Kenven and Kellendil can help them out by going into<br/>
Grobb and I and Sunblade can forage a bit to help out.<br/>
<br/>
Spell casters, please remember to get 100 each of your spell components.<br/>
200+ for pet reagents to be KS.<br/>
<br/>
No alpha loot will be in place. Instead, auto split will be turn on, and<br/>
1 person of each group will be delicated to looting everything. Please<br/>
report whatever you get to all 3 groups. We will decide by vote who<br/>
requires the item the most and hand it to him/her first.<br/>
<br/>
This event will be a 2 day, 3 night event. We will make our way to guk<br/>
on Saturday night and fight from Saturday night to National day. When TV<br/>
showing fire works, those present will atempt to choing the frogloc<br/>
paladin if we gather enough force, and no one is camping the goon.<br/>
<br/>
For this act, I have to do some calculation during that time to see if<br/>
we can take it on.<br/>
<br/>
If this works out, next spot will be Cazic Thule or Najera. Will take<br/>
out the whole plan after I get my ideas together.<br/>

&gt; nice guy/gal (heh) who helps ppl out and all that...i&#39;m willing to<br/>
&gt; help you here. However, i do first want to know how i can help you<br/>
&gt; with my credit card. You have to enter the number right?After all,<br/>
&gt; much as i think you&#39;re a nice guy, money is still money and credit<br/>
&gt; card numbers are dangerousto pass around =) I&#39;m sure everyone can<br/>
