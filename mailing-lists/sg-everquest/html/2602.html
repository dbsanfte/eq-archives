<div id="ygrps-yiv-78338277">Err, I was thinking of quiting also, but didnt expect u to quit earlier <br/>
than me.  EQ has turn out to be such a zombie-camping-training game that <br/>
eliminated most of the fun provided by the multi-race/class char <br/>
development concept.<br/>
<br/>
To tell the truth, even after I stop playing EQ, I didn&#39;t login UO every <br/>
night.  But every time I login, there are quite a lot of stuffs I can do, <br/>
other than camping/hunting.  Both UO and EQ are not as attractive as b4, <br/>
but it&#39;s sad that say EQ has more &#39;push&#39; factor than UO.  I feel more sick <br/>
when thinking of logging into EQ than UO ;)<br/>

p/s: Garren shld have sold ya acct in eBay instead of just quit.   Who <br/>
know, with ya chars, you can earn some money to buy some new PC stuffs, <br/>
hehe.<br/>

&gt; &gt;         Everquest was, had been and enjoyable game at the beginning but<br/>
&gt; due<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the way that the game is designed it reminds me more of Evercamp,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Everbitch etc etc. It has become a torture to enter the &quot;game&quot; each day<br/>
&gt; now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This incident has at least freed me from Evercrack as some would say it<br/>
&gt; is.<br/>
&gt; &gt; So farewell my fellow guildmates. And may your time in Everquest be as<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; first day, with new and exciting adventures each day.<br/>
