hahahahah.  Just like the disease in EQ, it will cure by itself.  EQ <br/>
spining is still not as bad as those REAL 1st person 3D arcade game.  Go <br/>
try Tribes and u will know wat I mean, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
I personally max out all my 6 out of my 7 magery skills in town everytime I <br/>
gain a lvl - ie mediating, chanelling, evoke, divine, alter and adjure. <br/>
 The only one left out is conjure coz wiz dun get scolls of this skill <br/>
until later stage.  I also try to max out my melee skills whenever <br/>
possible, but when I reach lvl 13, melee skill is no longer useful.  If I <br/>
try to fight and cast, I will get disturbed pretty often and hp also <br/>
reduced fast.  I used root & nuke whenever possible.  H/w, I met a lvl 18 <br/>
wiz last week, he ofter his help in using melee when I hunt derv cutthroat, <br/>
saying that he still get very lttile xp in killing those derv but his main <br/>
concern is to rise his melee skill.  Seem that ya melee skill will rise <br/>
even if u fight with something green to u, as long as u still gain xp from <br/>
killing it (but u dun have to kill it to gain skill).  Maybe at later stage <br/>
when it&#39;s impractical to use ya melee for hunting, u can go ard helping <br/>
lower lvl players to hunt and at the same time train ya melee?<br/>
<br/>
As for trading skill, I recommend brewing.  It only take an initial <br/>
investment of 5-8pp and can max out in 2 hrs or so.  Even at my lvl I still <br/>
find the profit quite attractive.  I can only earn around 10pp a night <br/>
hunting at my lvl (4 hrs average) but brewing give me that profit (or more) <br/>
in a hr time with max skill.  Maybe u may wanna max out this skill when u <br/>
earn enough pp at lvl 4 instead of buying scroll 1st.  Afterall, once u get <br/>
the max brewing skill, u can easily earn back the money required to buy all <br/>
ya scrolls ;)<br/>
<br/>
Wait, Nicademous?  I think I saw that name somewhere b4, or something <br/>
similar?  Where r u located now?<br/>
