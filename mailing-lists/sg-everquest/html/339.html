<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391005951">Most of the time pple are nice enuff to bind or SoW for free, and donation <br/>
is optional.  If anyone ask for a fee, ask them go fly kites, unless u at <br/>
wulu wulu place where u can&#39;t find anyone to help u ;)<br/>
<br/>
I died twice on a row yesterday at west common, and there is a Druid with <br/>
name Morxxxxx SoW twice at west gate. When I get back my corpse and gate <br/>
back to west gate, I pay him some money.  Leshrec can bind liao at lvl 15. <br/>
