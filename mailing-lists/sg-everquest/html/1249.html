<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032219026">For those who wait for me to lead u to FP last night, very pai seh.  My <br/>
friend Woodbridge start a new wood-elf ranger char and I was busy helping <br/>
him.  I also need to help Flyingfox to get a dagger b4 I can get back to <br/>
FP.  FYI the other Hong Kong members from the guild, including Ling (lvl 21 <br/>
wiz) and Deadflower (lvl 16 Bard), will be joining us.  Hopefully with <br/>
Garren&#39;s help, we can quickly loot at least 2 daggers (for FF n Ling) b4 we <br/>
move back to FP.  Btw FF drop lvl when he died few times in Unrest last <br/>
night, back to lvl 19.  We need to power gain xp when we go back to HH. <br/>
 Most probably this weekends (esp the night), u will see 3 nukers (Ling, FF <br/>
and me) blasting day and night there.  ;)<br/>
