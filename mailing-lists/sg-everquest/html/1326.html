<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738553711">Getting tired of Qui, only the few that group with us are active, others<br/>
all tiam tiam never participate one and a hell lot of people in in are<br/>
low level. At most we keep close contacts with them and help them when<br/>
they need help.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;  Greetings one and all.    Recently, there has been many additions to<br/>
&gt; the Singapapore Everquest scene and with these additions, the player<br/>
&gt; base in Singapore is considerably larger than before. Although most of<br/>
&gt; us are in the Qui H`oom Dai guild, I feel we should set up our own<br/>
&gt; guild. This is for several reasons. Firstly, it would let us<br/>
&gt; communicate easier with each other and have a sense of belonging.<br/>
&gt; Although Qui H`oom Dai contains quite a lot of Singapore players,<br/>
&gt; nothing beats having our own guild since we would not be strangers to<br/>
&gt; each other. Secondly, we have seen members in our present guild who<br/>
&gt; does things which are not of our principles. IE steal killing and<br/>
&gt; being too verbose. If we have our own guild, we could maintain a sense<br/>
&gt; of order in the guild and keep out the unwanted type of players. There<br/>
&gt; are of course other reasons but these I feel are the major ones. Of<br/>
&gt; course, I have nothing against Qui H`oom Dai guild or its leader, in<br/>
&gt; fact I say the guild is wholely very friendly and helpful. Although<br/>
&gt; this issue has been brought up before, I feel this is the time we<br/>
&gt; should take it into consideration since we are mostly of rather<br/>
&gt; average levels and should be able to take care of ourselves.<br/>
