<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hi guys,ive tried baking fer the last couple of days... every now n<br/>
&gt; then... working on my baking skills... only from yesterday nite (or<br/>
&gt; rather today since its 7am now hehee) i discovered baking is cool! and<br/>
&gt; reasonably good money for starters. The only bad thing is getting the<br/>
&gt; skill up and it requires... Skill 5-20 Edible Goo - Fire Beetle Eye +<br/>
&gt; Rat EarSkill 20-35 Bat Wing Crunchies - Frosting + Bat WingSkill 35-82<br/>
&gt; Fish Fillet - Fish + Jug of SauceI have only managed to get to 82.<br/>
&gt; From skill 60 onwards, I start to make some money... perhaps enough to<br/>
&gt; cover the cost for the fish n sauce... i didnt take note of the<br/>
&gt; numbers as I was spending time trying to up my fishing skill as<br/>
&gt; well... so not sure bout that bit... when my fishing skill max out fer<br/>
&gt; my level... i started buying fish n sauce... n thast when i discover i<br/>
&gt; make some moeny... from what i see... this is as good as brewing... in<br/>
&gt; fact slightly better... bcos u only need 2 components...  below is the<br/>
&gt; breakdown (from neriak).1 fish sell for 3sp 1cp1 jug of sauce sell for<br/>
&gt; 1sp 3 cpTotal Cost = 4sp 4cp If successful, i make 2 fish fillet, each<br/>
&gt; sell for 4sp 8cp so 2 will make 9sp 6cp. Profit of 100% At close to 70<br/>
&gt; i get like 70% successful... so profit is pretty good... 80 as well...<br/>
&gt; but sometimes do get down on the luck n fail quite a few in a<br/>
&gt; row... another way to get those items to go to Freeport and ask<br/>
&gt; newbies to get those items... i tried to get most myself... so that<br/>
&gt; explains the long time taken... at the final stage... i auction for 20<br/>
&gt; batwings fer 5gp... tons of em will rush to get those wings fer u...<br/>
&gt; so it worked pretty fine...if u guys are bored of fighting stuff...<br/>
&gt; maybe u can give it a try and gain some useful skills... maybe just<br/>
&gt; enough to buy our spells... but IMHO thats enough... least till level<br/>
&gt; 20... :) thast all bout baking...NicademousA Dark Elf Necromancer that<br/>
&gt; stayed up all nite just to make some fish<br/>
&gt; fillets...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
