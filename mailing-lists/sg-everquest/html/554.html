<div id="ygrps-yiv-599751719">Aye, don&#39;t worry about stats too much though. I do kinda missed my Half Elf<br/>
for infrav vision. But with my more balanced Paladin I just heck care the<br/>
rest and he&#39;s gaining lvl quite fast too. and I have started my Wood Elf<br/>
Ranger too. I&#39;m not sure about Prexus. Will play there very little which I<br/>
must say. Too many friends and stuff at Inno to abandon.<br/>

&gt; Well, all of you give very good points. However, they all contradict each<br/>
&gt; others&#39;. Like LKW and Sereph, both are solid facts but they &quot;kick&quot; each<br/>
&gt; other. In the end, its each to his own. Why can&#39;t we just play a game for<br/>
&gt; fun sake? But of course, who doesn&#39;t want to get all the goodies and hit<br/>
&gt; Level 50 &lt;smiles&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; EG, Paldines was collecting dust because Gary found that Garren had better<br/>
&gt; strength to balance out his character in the long run.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, I just answered my question. Now I know why I play only a Monk.<br/>
Simple.<br/>
&gt; Kick and punch and trash the shit out of others. I heard Calofia &lt;40 Monk&gt;<br/>
&gt; was dishing out devastating damage. I wonder when its my turn....laterz.<br/>

&gt; &gt; There is no doubt a TSK can solo best in EQ.  They have the harm spells<br/>
&gt; &gt; which is as good as Paladin&#39;s healing ability (no saving throw or<br/>
&gt; failure),<br/>
&gt; &gt; yet they have the ability of regenerating HP ability.  I made a troll<br/>
&gt; &gt; shaman in Innoruuk for testing, at lvl 1 my first victim is a monster<br/>
&gt; which<br/>
&gt; &gt; is yellow to me.  And within the first 10 min I play, I gain a lvl.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Btw, all classes always complain that they are weaker than other<br/>
classes,<br/>
&gt; &gt; seem to be a norm, hehe.  I even read from the net how a lvl 40+ warrior<br/>
&gt; &gt; complained abt his char as compare to a shadowknight who is few lvl<br/>
below<br/>
&gt; &gt; him - coz in term of soloing, this warrior can&#39;t handle big monster like<br/>
&gt; &gt; that shadowknight.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; EQSS also have an article abt soloing - and they rank troll anything as<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; easiest soloing char, esp TSK, followed by wiz, shaman, dwarf cleric and<br/>
&gt; &gt; monk.  One thing abt monk, at lvl 35+ they will jump to 2nd in the list,<br/>
&gt; ie<br/>
&gt; &gt; the next best soloing class after Troll something, due to the new kick<br/>
ass<br/>
&gt; &gt; skills they achieve at higher level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
