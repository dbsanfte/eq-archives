<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793167400">Kindly be reminded that the WCR/RTS/JKS hunt is tonight (Friday) 11.00PM at <br/>
North Karana Guard Tower next to zone to South Karana.<br/>
<br/>
Pls get ya food/drink/spell reagents rdy.  No gating service will be <br/>
available once we reach Lake Rathetear (in order not to waste everybody&#39;s <br/>
time).  But we still welcome u to join us later if u cant make it at 11pm <br/>
and u know the way.  If not, pai seh la ;)<br/>
<br/>
For those who dunno the place, pls arrange with other kakis to bring u <br/>
there, or meet me at Felwithe gate at 10.45PM (take a boat from FP to GF at <br/>
10pm, u shld be able to reach GH by 10.45pm), I will open portal to NK <br/>
(left 1 bubb to lvl 29 and I will login 2 hrs b4 the hunt to lvl, all <br/>
useful lvl 29 scolls are waiting for me in my bank liao, hehe).<br/>
<br/>
If the response is good, everyone behave themselves, I will organise the <br/>
next trip to Crush Bone, charging for:<br/>
- Dragoon Dirk (wowowo)<br/>
- Dwarven Chain (better than bronze breastplate? since it give +8 sv to <br/>
all)<br/>
- Shining Bass Shield (ok, welcome to Ziltus Hill, hehe)<br/>
- Screaming Mace (huh, Fesse start to drip saliver?), ONLY IF time allows <br/>
AND we have more than enuff artifact for the quest ;)<br/>
<br/>
I hope the lvl 30 will also spend a night or so to participate in such <br/>
hunting (maybe we make Friday night an office LOOTING GATHERING?).  Thou we <br/>
dun gain anything from it, but at least it will be something different from <br/>
our routine hunting, gaining xp, kill kill kill only.  Most impt of all, <br/>
our own kakis can get together and play together.  Afterall, play game is <br/>
for the sake of having fun and knowing more ppls, hehe.<br/>
