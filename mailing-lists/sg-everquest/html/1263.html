<b>Subject:</b> Spell Research, Specialization & Trade Skills <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-106073634">1. How do I go about researching spells.  Do I really need to buy those <br/>
books, in the sense that the books are PART of the ingredients in <br/>
researching spells or they are just for info purpose?  If I can find the <br/>
info for the spell from internet I dun need those books right?<br/>
<br/>
2. How do I go abt DOING spell research.  Say for wiz I got the runes <br/>
required for a certain spell, how do I go abt &#39;mixing&#39; the runes?  Is there <br/>
any container I need to find like brewing barrel or forge, put the runes <br/>
inside and click &#39;COMBINE&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
3. I heard from Leshrec tat we can now put a point on all specialization of <br/>
magery skills, ie evoke, adjure, conjure, divin, alter.  That&#39;s what I&#39;ve <br/>
done.  However, out of 5 skills, my main concern is on evoke (afterall I&#39;m <br/>
a nuker mah).  How to I go abt &#39;specializing&#39; in evoke?<br/>
<br/>
4. I intend to go into tailoring skill once I max out my smith.  Can I know <br/>
other than tailoring skill tat can &#39;mix&#39; with smithing skill, is there any <br/>
other skills which can work along with smith skill?<br/>
<br/>
5. Is enchanter the only class that can made &#39;enchanted&#39; jewelry?  Say if I <br/>
train jewelry skills using non-enchanted metal (eg silver), can I rise the <br/>
jewelcraft skill?  So once I can make a certain jewelry with pretty high <br/>
successful rate, I can buy those &#39;enchanted&#39; metal from enchanters and make <br/>
&#39;enchanted&#39; jewelry myself?  OR I must make an enchanters char to make <br/>
&#39;enchanted&#39; jewelry?<br/>
<br/>
6. Anyone got any tips on trade skills like tailoring, jewelcrafting, etc? <br/>
 Particularly those &#39;throw-PP-into-drain-kinda power-training&quot;, hehe.<br/>
