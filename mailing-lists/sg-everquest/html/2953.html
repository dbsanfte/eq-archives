&gt; &gt; &gt; Ooi guys,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Long time no see ah.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to take this opportunity to invite you guys to my RL<br/>
&gt; wedding<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; dinner ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It has been a year since I played EQ but so far I have never meet<br/>
&gt; anyone of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you.  Unlike my UO kakis, whom we have meet many times having supper at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Geylang when server down at 2-3am, dinner at newton circle, movie at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; leisure gallery etc, our EQ gang seem more &quot;shy&quot; and &quot;quiet&quot;, hehe.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The time round I hope to take this opportunity to invite you guys to<br/>
&gt; attend<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my wedding dinner and at the same time gather and meet.  I got 1 table<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reserved for you guys, another table for my UO kakis.  I believe you<br/>
&gt; guys<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; may know some of them who are also playing other online games.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The date is 6th Sep 2000 (Wed, sorry for a weekday but it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; &quot;selected&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; date by parents, bo bian), venue is Orchard Parade Hotel Ballroom. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; banquet dishes will be prepared by Club Chinois, so we will have good<br/>
&gt; food,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; food drinks but sorry, no good women provided   ;P  Of coz most impt is<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gather and talk cock sing songs lah!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway we gotta settle the table guest list within this month (tolong<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; la, I&#39;ve been bothered by this wedding, house renovation, photo taking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; matters for 3-4 months liao, let me have some early preparation and<br/>
&gt; take a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; month rest before my BIG day, ok? Heh), appreciate if you guy can let<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; know if you are attending ASAP (by 31/7/00).  If you are coming (really<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hope so), pls include your full RL name, EQ char name (in case you<br/>
&gt; change<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; char and I dunno ya new char), as well as your mailing address in your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; e-mail reply.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I only invite close, local players, but if I missed out any, pls let me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; know.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks a million!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yours truly,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Kar Wai, aka Dark Flame<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; P/S: Due to the limited seats, I&#39;m unable to invite those newer<br/>
&gt; Singapore<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; EQ members/allies.  Only &quot;KAKIS&quot; got the privilege, hehe.  So if I<br/>
&gt; received<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; no reply by 31/7/00 (gotta give me sometime to print invitation cards<br/>
&gt; also,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; right?), I have to treat it as you DON&#39;T GIVE FACE (and dun even bother<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reply!?) and will ask Fesse to sleep with you then!!! ;P<br/>
