<b>Subject:</b> Re: Which server? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457971053">More than half shifted to new server I guess - Prexus server.  The rest <br/>
remain in Innoruuk server.<br/>
Btw, other than the first day the server is up, so far Prexus remain at the <br/>
top 3 LEAST players server everytime I login or logout.  This is especially <br/>
true around S&#39;pore time 7-8pm (always the least player server).  When I <br/>
logout between 12am & 2am, Prexus is again the top 3 least player server, <br/>
if not the least.<br/>
<br/>
Initially many pple try to create new create in Prexus but alot of them <br/>
left shortly coz of 2 main reasons:<br/>
1. This is not the race war server which everyone is looking forward to.<br/>
2. They can&#39;t bear to leave their old high lvl chars, friends and items ;)<br/>
<br/>
Depending on how u see it, I personally feel that my 2nd gnome wiz is <br/>
better created than my high elf wiz.  Of coz I can always create a gnome <br/>
wiz in the old Innoruuk server but I guess no harm trying a month or so in <br/>
the new server - esp now I got Eriz and Kell with me, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
If everything works out right, we will be meeting Leshrec (DEN) and other <br/>
guys in Prexus soon.  Hopefully we can settled down in the new server then <br/>
;)<br/>

p/s: While waiting for Eriz and Kell to join me in Ak-Anon, I fought 2 <br/>
fierce battles with 2 trains kobolds (both with at least 2 white) at the <br/>
the kobold camp, both siuation left with 3 & 5 HP respectively.  I start to <br/>
love my high AGI and DEX like crazy, hehe.<br/>
