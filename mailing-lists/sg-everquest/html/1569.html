<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661487">Agreed.  Let distribute those stuffs only can be used by those who are <br/>
physically involved in the hunt.  I&#39;m merely joking when I say I want those <br/>
non-wiz stuffs for sales.<br/>
<br/>
Another alternative it to use alpha loot, we sort out how we wanna exchange <br/>
later, coz when there is only 1 bard item with 2 bards ard, it&#39;s hard to <br/>
decide who to get it ;)  Anyway the magi can summon dimension bag, u can <br/>
keep it at weightless, so no problem in carrying loot.  Even for caster, <br/>
our reagents r only 0.1 stone each, carry 100 only weight 10 stones.  Using <br/>
dimension bag sure no problem.  But when it come to junk, throw it awat or <br/>
give to those who can carry and sell la.<br/>
<br/>
Perhap we shld find another day get those weightless containers ;)<br/>

p/s: If u LD, the dimension bags and the content will still be there when u <br/>
relogin, tested with myself few times.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>becos its obvious that we may (or even maynot) get one of those stuff and <br/>
everyone wants them. Judging from this, maybe i should just go n work on my <br/>
levels instead of getting items since everyone wants so many things... how <br/>
bout everyone just is able to list ONE item that he really really wants... <br/>
or several of lesser value... otherwise the trip is gonna turn out to be <br/>
more of a nitemare than benefit for us...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>unfair... bcos theres just too many folks queueing up for the stuff... <br/>
unless u want to bring ya 2nd or 3rd char along then thats another story. <br/>
thats wat i think... pls feedback...<br/>
