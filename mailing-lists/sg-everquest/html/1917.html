<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the guild should be about helping each other (esp when u really need it) <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and hunting<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; together at times...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, at &#39;times&#39;, but not &#39;ALL time&#39; ;)<br/>
Like I said, yes, shld help one another.  But u mentioned 1 SOS and all <br/>
have to drop wat they doing to come and help, isn&#39;t it too &#39;ground <br/>
shaking&#39;? ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if u wanna swap stuff... thats more of a favor rather than a<br/>
&gt; SOS... pls differentiate the 2 things! if u have 2 bloody chars... and 1 <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; given... THAST IS WHATS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER GUILD... if u think that<br/>
&gt; &gt; camping a stupid shield is more impt that this matter... then i give up <br/>
&gt; on this guild liaoz....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not the only one who think of dropping stuffs and let my other char <br/>
pick it, Les has done it before too when I wasn&#39;t online to help him last <br/>
time (initially we r the 1st 2 HE wiz and we dunno other kakis yet).  I&#39;m <br/>
using the swap item as an example, cool down man ;)  I&#39;m just trying to <br/>
point out that, to u, ya matter is the most impt, but to other, they will <br/>
to feel that way for their own matter.  Back to my illustration, if I&#39;ve <br/>
camp the shield for 5 hrs, and I know it will be dropped anytime in the <br/>
next hr, while someone need a help to retrieve his corpse, and this CAN be <br/>
done by other kakis online, I see no reason why ALL (including myself) have <br/>
to drop what they are doing and come to ya rescue.  Whether in RL or in EQ, <br/>
we do have to be &#39;efficient&#39; sometimes. ;)  Helping a member to get his <br/>
corpse is not something that required ALL other kakis to participate.  Just <br/>
like in UO, do u respond to all SOS icq? ;)<br/>
<br/>
Well if u still insist when there is a SOS msg, and expect ALL kakis online <br/>
to rush to him, then I will perosnally think that my 5hrs camping is more <br/>
important than saving that stupid corpse ;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also very flexible in such things, but general guidelines must still be <br/>
lay down.  Ah-hoc cases and individual members&#39; atttitude and playing style <br/>
must also be considered.  If you can name me any guild in EQ where ALL will <br/>
rush to any SOS msg send in guildsay, tell me, I also wanan join ;)<br/>
