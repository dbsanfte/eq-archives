Rules That Guys Wish Girls Knew┬à<br/>
<br/>
 (Please note...these are all numbered #1 ON<br/>
 PURPOSE!)<br/>
<br/>
     1. If you think you are fat, you probably are.<br/>
     Do not ask us. We refuse to answer.<br/>
<br/>
     1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You&#39;re a big<br/>
     girl. If it&#39;s up, put it down.<br/>
<br/>
     1. Sometimes, we are not thinking about you.<br/>
     Live with it.<br/>
<br/>
     1. Do not ask us what we are thinking about<br/>
     unless you are prepared to discuss such<br/>
     topics as military strategies, is P226 or the GLOC better,<br/>
     and is Sim Lim Square returning to selling pirated discs.<br/>
<br/>
     1. Sunday = sports. It&#39;s like the full moon or<br/>
     the changing of the tides. Let it be.<br/>
<br/>
     1. When we have to go somewhere,<br/>
     absolutely anything you wear is fine. Really.<br/>
<br/>
     1. Your ex-boyfriend is an idiot.<br/>
<br/>
     1. Most guys own three pairs of shoes ┬ù<br/>
     tops. What makes you think we&#39;d be any<br/>
     good at choosing which pair, out of thirty,<br/>
     would look good with your dress?<br/>
<br/>
     1. Foreign films (esp those French, Italian, etc)<br/>
    are best left to foreigners.<br/>
<br/>
     1. Anything we said six months ago is<br/>
     inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all<br/>
     comments become null and void after seven<br/>
     days.<br/>
<br/>
     1. If you won&#39;t dress like the Victoria&#39;s Secret<br/>
     girls, don&#39;t expect us to act like soap opera<br/>
     guys.<br/>
<br/>
     1. If something we said can be interpreted<br/>
     two ways, and one of the ways makes you<br/>
     sad or angry, we meant the other one.<br/>
<br/>
     1. Let us ogle. We are going to look anyway;<br/>
     it&#39;s genetic.<br/>
<br/>
     1. Whenever possible, please say whatever<br/>
     you have to say during commercials.<br/>
<br/>
     1. Women wearing Wonder bras and low-cut<br/>
     blouses lose their right to complain about<br/>
     having their boobs stared at. More women<br/>
     should wear Wonder bras and low-cut<br/>
     blouses. We like staring at boobs.<br/>
<br/>
     1. The relationship is never going to be like it<br/>
     was the first two months we were going out.<br/>
     Get over it. And quit whining to your<br/>
     girlfriends - like THEIR relationship is SO<br/>
     MUCH better.<br/>
<br/>
     1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like<br/>
     Windows default settings. Peach, for<br/>
     example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is<br/>
     also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.<br/>
<br/>
     1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do<br/>
     that.<br/>
<br/>
     1. If we ask what is wrong and you say<br/>
     &quot;nothing,&quot; we will act like nothing&#39;s wrong.<br/>
     We know you are lying, but it is just not<br/>
     worth the hassle.<br/>
