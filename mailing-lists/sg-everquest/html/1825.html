<b>Subject:</b> Any tips for Druid? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581728692">Any tips on power training a lvl 4 to 9 druid (already got full leather <br/>
armor, screaming mace, SBS, some stats jewelries and all lvl 1 to 9 scrolls <br/>
which I can buy from Kelethim druid guild)?<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has a lvl 5 plus minus char in GF, wanna group to take bandit <br/>
camp (which I think the loot/xp is more justifiable for the mob toughness <br/>
as compare to orc camp)?<br/>
<br/>
I will be playing this druid tonight, till latest tomorrow, when FF can <br/>
meet me to go back HH hunting.<br/>

p/s: Is it true that screaming mace effect only appear when the wearer is <br/>
at least lvl 10?</div>
