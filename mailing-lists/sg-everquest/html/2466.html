<b>Subject:</b> Need info for Rathyl room <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734348419">I got the skull key from Bonecracker, silver key from Derz and golden key <br/>
from najena, but none of them open the door to Rathly room (the underground <br/>
cell, need to go thru the 3 magi cells 1st).  Anyone know who drop Rathyl&#39;s <br/>
key? Simi lvl?  Rathyl drop hollowed bone bracers (sell 200-300pp) and <br/>
25/50% (?) wt-lost bag/pouch.  The room is always empty too.  Rathyl is a <br/>
SK which can revive after he got killed, ie need to kill him 2 times.<br/>
<br/>
Just another hunting spots for the lvl 30s ;)</div>
