<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394494625">Najena<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an &quot;old&quot; article i saved in my EQ folder of Dungeons.<br/>
I hope is still relevent, with all em&#39; patches and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Najena is a very popular dungeon for characters level 15-30 that is located<br/>
in the zone of lavastorm. To find Najena you can take a right upon entering<br/>
lavastorm and follow the mountains. You will see the<br/>
Najena ruins in the distance. Najena is a spooky dungeon filled with a green<br/>
fog throughout.<br/>
<br/>
The entrance area is not too easy you will find greater skeletons and ogre<br/>
guards that range in the 15ish level range. Deeper in you will find elements<br/>
and tentacle terrors. The first few rooms are the ones most<br/>
often occupied by characters level 15-20. There are two other areas in the<br/>
dungeon however for characters of higher levels. They must be visited in<br/>
order.<br/>
<br/>
The first area is a secret room that will be to the left down on of the<br/>
hallways. This room lies behind an illusionary wall that you can walk right<br/>
through. From this room you will see two passages. The door to the<br/>
left of here leads to some level 20ish skeletons. The passage downstairs<br/>
leads to the meat of this portion of the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
You will find many necromancers and ogre&#39;s down in this area. However the<br/>
prized opponents in this area are Bonecrusher, the Ogre Captain and the Ogre<br/>
Officer.<br/>
<br/>
Bonecrusher is in a room to the left near the bottom of the stairs. He is in<br/>
a room with 2 necromancers. Bonecrusher is a froglock ghoul who is level 24.<br/>
He is sought after for the magic items that he carries. This<br/>
includes flesh rings and barbed leather whips.<br/>
<br/>
To the right of the bottom of the stairs and down a corridor you will find<br/>
the captains room. The captain is a level 27ish mob who is quite deadly. He<br/>
is guarded by several ogres including an officer who is in the<br/>
level 24-25ish range. The captain carries a key to Rathyl&#39;s room as well as<br/>
the occasional ogre maul or large bronze platemail piece of armor.<br/>
<br/>
The keys you get from the monsters in this area will allow you to go to the<br/>
real juicy part of this dungeon: behind the Najena sign. If you continued<br/>
straight when entering the dungeon you would undoubtedly<br/>
have noticed a Najena sign with some magicians guarding the entrance. Behind<br/>
this sign lies the three major spellcasting NPC&#39;s in this zone: Rathyl,<br/>
Drelzna and Najena.<br/>
<br/>
These NPC&#39;s must be visited in that order. Each NPC has the key to the other<br/>
ones chamber as well as having a key out of their chamber(to hand out to<br/>
party members). The Drelzna and Najena keys are no<br/>
rent meaning that if you log out they will dissapear. None of these NPC&#39;s<br/>
spawn every time and there is an anti camp radius code implemented so that<br/>
you cannot simply camp by their lairs. This can be frustrating<br/>
at first but with a little practice you will be able to learn their<br/>
patterns.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to get into specifics here as something has to be left to<br/>
chance(and it would be hard to describe anyway) so i&#39;m just going to roughly<br/>
describe each NPC and an example of what you might find on<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Rathyl is a necromancer who is guarded by several magicians. He is a deadly<br/>
foe even after death as his reincarnation will appear and have to be<br/>
destroyed all over again! A typical item you might find from<br/>
Rathyl would be a traveller&#39;s backpack.<br/>
<br/>
Drelzna is guarded by 2 necromancers. Both the necromancers as well as<br/>
Drelzna can charm. This may be the toughest fight of them all perhaps even<br/>
tougher than Najena. One of Drelzna&#39;s prized possessions<br/>
is the journeyman boots.<br/>
<br/>
Najena is guarded by a couple of magicians. Najena is perhaps the rarest of<br/>
them all and is the most powerful alone. Drelzna may be a tougher kill but<br/>
this is only because of her guards. One of Najena&#39;s prized<br/>
possessions is the flowing black robe.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;May I know which mob carry the key to Jboot room?  Where can I find it?<br/>
&gt; What lvl is the mob carrying the key and does it has other guard mobs also<br/>
&gt;(what lvl if yes)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How abt the room tat drops Jboot?  What mobs and lvl inside?  I heard tat<br/>
&gt;room is tougher than Najena room (of coz Najena herself is still the<br/>
&gt;toughest mob in the dungeon) due to those necro guards which can charm<br/>
&gt;players.  What other artifacts can we find in the room?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All info welcome, thx.<br/>
