<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-382992813">Wah, ya necro abit goon leh, need 10pp to max out skill, hehehe.  Someone <br/>
just mentioned he max out using only 5pp+ with 75int.  Dun tell me u didnt <br/>
pump up ya int when u create ya char, or u will sure to suffer at high <br/>
lvls.<br/>
<br/>
For my brewing, I buy 160 sets of ingredients for my latest brewing, brew <br/>
until vomit.  I think I get ard 30pp during tat brewing, or maybe more, but <br/>
I&#39;m not gonna try to brew so much at one short again.  Btw I carry 7 <br/>
backpacks on me, the last slot is looting any containers during hunting.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking of picking up smithing, skill 25 now, but dunno what to make <br/>
or what to do to boost it further. ;(<br/>

the 5-7pp range... more like 10pp... but i was starting to make money by <br/>
the 9th or 10th pp... so now i have a reasonable amount :) after brewing it <br/>
fer awhile... but can be pretty boring brewing.... ok... just a few quick <br/>
questions... how many of each stuff do u guys buy usuaully when u go on <br/>
brewing fer 1 round? i have like 40 of each materials (ie.., hops, malt, <br/>
etc)... and filled up all my backups (yes! i bought 5 backups)... n start <br/>
brewing... any better method? or faster method? also.. i said b4 i m gonna <br/>
return the money... although sereph u said i can keep em... if u still want <br/>
em... do let me know... i will return em to ya...<br/>
