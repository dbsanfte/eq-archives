<div id="ygrps-yiv-148711515">BEFORE I ANSWER HIS QUESTION : Does any know where to get Shiseido hair<br/>
products? I&#39;ve been looking for the mousse for ^%*$*&$ time.<br/>
<br/>
Go to Innoruuk. Gary&lt;nick dunno&gt; and Alex&lt;YiYang&gt; can help you out. Even if<br/>
Alex, Gary etc is not on Innoruuk, I&#39;d say its real good due to its lag and<br/>
amount of people online during our norm hours.<br/>
<br/>
As for creating a character,<br/>
1)Its all based on your roleplaying?<br/>
2)Or do you just want to build a &quot;touch-me-and-die&quot; character?<br/>
<br/>
Ans for 2) : Try a Shadowknight Troll/Orge. I personally support the troll.<br/>
OR<br/>
             A magician who does only average but when he hits LvL 45 and<br/>
above...<br/>
             Wheepee! You can kick any PvPs arse in 3 bolts. But if you miss<br/>
one<br/>
             bolt and have no more mana then you are DEAD!<br/>
<br/>
My two cents,<br/>
