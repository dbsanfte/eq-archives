&gt; I share the same feeling as Leshrec.  On top of the reasons he brought up,<br/>
&gt; I think Wylven start to lose control of the guild, esp the members who go<br/>
&gt; around doing bad things with our guild abbrev.  No doubt Wylven is a very<br/>
&gt; nice and helpful player, he is also very soft-hearted and sometimes too<br/>
&gt; nice to members, even if certain members misbehave.<br/>

&gt; On the other hand, I wanna rise my concerns IF we were to form a new guild:<br/>
&gt; 1. What kinda guild is this gonna be?  A friend-friend kinda guild (like<br/>
&gt; our curren QHD and when it grows, problematic members may pop up), a<br/>
&gt; role-playing guild with certain policy and discipline (ie insist to follow<br/>
&gt; the path of good and honor, so that when pple look at our abbrev, they know<br/>
&gt; we are the good guys, this type of guild will require some formal<br/>
&gt; organisation structure).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>// Rping guild + friends help friends one. So far, we ALL are playing good<br/>
characters so Rping should not be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2. Will this guild going to be a Singaporean only, Asians only or<br/>
&gt; international guild?  If we were to open to other nations players, how can<br/>
&gt; we enforce discipline?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>// One word to solve discipline problem. PARANG. Just look at how Yiyang&#39;s wife<br/>
control him with a parang.<br/>
// If there&#39;s ever one, it will be international, but at all times, must have<br/>
80% SG ppl + core members. Much like how in Malaysia, companies must have a<br/>
certain ammount of Malay employees or ganna close down.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. Wylven&#39;s feeling, this is one of my most concern part - how would he<br/>
&gt; feel when we leave guild and form our own?  Will he think &quot;wah, last time<br/>
&gt; newbie I help u guys, u guys also find kakis to team in the guild, which in<br/>
&gt; turn helps alot in lvling, now all feather grow up liao, wanna fly away<br/>
&gt; ah?&quot;?  If we were to leave QHD and form a new guild, we must be very<br/>
&gt; careful to handle this part since most of us, if not all, still respect him<br/>
&gt; as a good and honorable friend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>// Yeah, this part a bit pai seh.... Remember how Aadryc purposely come down to<br/>
w-commons to help me fish out my corpse in &quot;Swimming Dragoon Lake&quot; But I don&#39;t<br/>
think they&#39;ll miss me(only me) since I always spam the guildsay channel with<br/>
low class toilet jokes every now and then.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4. Do we consider forming alliance with QHD?  In UO, one of my pioneer<br/>
&gt; members leave us and form his guild.  H/w we never take it to heart and in<br/>
&gt; the end we form a very close alliance - whenever TAA need help, tDw will be<br/>
&gt; ard, vice versa.  Until now, they are still our closest allies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>// Ally to them lah, but QHD super inactive leh, never plan activities one<br/>
(heck, the Befallen rush was me yelling to Wylven to use his autority to force<br/>
players down) so we can help them do what?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5. How abt those players who join QHD due to our recommendation.  Players<br/>
&gt; like Ling, Flyingfox, Deadflower, Satoru, Woodbridge etc will most probably<br/>
&gt; leave QHD and join us if I leave also.  Same for other local kakis who have<br/>
&gt; friends who will follow them to the new guild if we quit from QHD.  This<br/>
&gt; will further increase the number of players leaving QHD, at least 1/3 of<br/>
&gt; the guild, I guess.  How are we going to explain to Wylven?  I&#39;m worry he<br/>
&gt; feel very dishearted with so many members leaving at one time, and<br/>
&gt; indirectly, again, it reflect something wrong with his guild and tat&#39;s why<br/>
&gt; we are leaving to form our own guild.  We must be very cautious handling<br/>
&gt; this matter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

SG rules over Oasis. :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 6. How are we going to maintain members quality and guild reputation?  I<br/>
&gt; think to avoid misunderstanding in future (most importantly, not to end up<br/>
&gt; like wat is happening in QHD now), all new members shld be briefed abt our<br/>
&gt; guild policy and direction, what can or cannot be done when they are one of<br/>
&gt; us.  This is something I did when I accept my UO guild membership.  My UO<br/>
&gt; guild has a membership application form in our guild site to fill up some<br/>
&gt; queries to enable us better understand the candidate and if he/she is<br/>
&gt; accepted, I will send the person a standard letter stating the general<br/>
&gt; policy of the guild.  For those which I find them not suitable to join us<br/>
&gt; (eg those players who enjoy pking, looting), I will also reply them to let<br/>
&gt; them know why they are not accepted and they will still be considered IF<br/>
&gt; they promise to follow our discipline.<br/>

standard and match out moral code, we then let them in.<br/>

&gt; Red-Dawn once abt the local EQ site.  He agreed to look into it and shld<br/>
&gt; let us know very soon.  I think some local kakis also spoke to him on same<br/>
&gt; issue b4, so I think we won&#39;t have problem getting web space.  The only<br/>
&gt; problem I foresee is who is gonna maintain the guild site? ;)  I recommend<br/>
&gt; those pple who can play when they are working (one of my UO member is a IT<br/>
&gt; operation which company let him play UO to keep him awake when doing shift,<br/>

do it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Greetings one and all.<br/>
&gt; &gt;     Recently, there has been many additions to the Singapapore Everquest<br/>
&gt; scene and with these additions, the player base in Singapore is<br/>
&gt; considerably larger than before. Although most of us are in the Qui H`oom<br/>
&gt; Dai guild, I feel we should set up our own guild. This is for several<br/>
&gt; reasons. Firstly, it would let us communicate easier with each other and<br/>
&gt; have a sense of belonging. Although Qui H`oom Dai contains quite a lot of<br/>
&gt; Singapore players, nothing beats having our own guild since we would not be<br/>
&gt; strangers to each other. Secondly, we have seen members in our present<br/>
&gt; guild who does things which are not of our principles. IE steal killing and<br/>
&gt; being too verbose. If we have our own guild, we could maintain a sense of<br/>
&gt; order in the guild and keep out the unwanted type of players. There are of<br/>
&gt; course other reasons but these I feel are the major ones. Of course, I have<br/>
&gt; nothing against Qui H`oom Dai guild or its leader, in fact I say the guild<br/>
&gt; is wholely very friendly and helpful. Although this issue has been brought<br/>
&gt; up before, I feel this is the time we should take it into consideration<br/>
&gt; since we are mostly of rather average levels and should be able to take<br/>
&gt; care of ourselves.<br/>
