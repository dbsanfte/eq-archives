<b>Subject:</b> EQ Yeild Rule <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327510557">Hi guys,<br/>
<br/>
Before I leave EQ 6 mths ago, there was a hot debate on the Yield rule. <br/>
 Ie, if a high lvl player is hunting a mob for item (and give him no xp), a <br/>
low lvl player come in for xp, the high lvl guy have to leave the place. <br/>
 Is tat rule in now?<br/>
<br/>
I got a UO buddy (a she btw, REAL female) who happened to play in Innoruuk. <br/>
She is a one of my best buddies in UO, very trust-worthy, nice and mature <br/>
lady. Now I intend to help her to camp for dvinn dagger and dwarven chain <br/>
tunic (these 2 mobs spawn quite often right?), can I do so?  Coz CB tower <br/>
sure crowded with newbies.  If I walk in like a newbie (with all my stuffs <br/>
kept in bank), can they use the Yield rule to chase me out? ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thx.<br/>
<br/>
