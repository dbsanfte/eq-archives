<div id="ygrps-yiv-261927666">I think piercing is better for necros than 2hblunt. Several reasons for<br/>
this..<br/>
1. Certain necro spells like Vampiric embrace require you to hit your<br/>
opponent for it to take effect. Since piercing has lesser delay than blunt,<br/>
it should mean more chances of hiting.<br/>
2. The best 2hblunt, which i think is the staff of observers is NOT<br/>
wieldable by necros, only other caster types. I read this from a EQ<br/>
equipment guide, but it may be wrong, so please check it out first.<br/>
3. If possible, max out your piercing skills during the first few levels,<br/>
its much easier since from level 1-4, the pet is DAMN useless, a little more<br/>
powerful than a decaying skeleton. From level 4 onwards, the pet is a little<br/>
better, but once you get to level 6, either you must group with a warrior or<br/>
wizard, since your pet can only take 2-3 blows from the white and sometimes<br/>
blue stuff....<br/>
This is from my experience from playing a necro to level 8 so after that yer<br/>
on your own ) Good luck.<br/>

&gt;Come to freeport, I will provided u with full clothes armor & stave, plus<br/>
&gt;binding somemore ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh, as a DE, I suggest u train in 2H blunt weap (ie 2H stave), since u dun<br/>
&gt;need an extra hand to carry lantern and stuffs.  Also dun bother to spend<br/>
&gt;any points on ya magery skills, they are already available on ya personal<br/>
&gt;skill list.  Also dun spend any points on piercing (ie dagger) skill.  The<br/>
&gt;only time u need to spend ya skill points is when u get a worn great stave.<br/>
&gt; Spend just 1 point on 2H blunt and keep the rest for future.  I was conned<br/>
&gt;by the net stating that we need to spend a point in magery skills, which I<br/>
&gt;tested to prove it wrong using my gnome wiz.  We dun have to train in it,<br/>
&gt;just keep casting in town will do.  Most impt thing is once u start ya<br/>
&gt;char, train ya magery skills to lvl ceiling, u will automatically get<br/>
&gt;improvement on these skills.  Do the lvl ceiling training everytime u gain<br/>
&gt;a lvl.  For magery classes, our lvl ceiling is (lvl+1)X5.  Eg lvl 1 ceiling<br/>
&gt;is skill 10, lvl 2 is skill 15 etc.  For melee our lvl ceiling is<br/>
&gt;(lvl+1)X3.  During lvl 1-4, it doesnt matter if ya piercing skill is zero,<br/>
&gt;u can gain lvl easily - just endure until u can get a 2H stave and start<br/>
&gt;training it.  Once u reach lvl 4, spend another skill point on mediation.<br/>
&gt; The rest dun bother - keep the skill points until u wanna learn a trade<br/>
&gt;skills or special magery skill like research or specialization.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Remember Dragco from our UO allies TAA?  Tat chap get his lvl 11 wiz in<br/>
&gt;just a week in other server, so hard to pull him over to innoruuk now ;(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ziltus<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;p/s: Maybe I also start a DE char with u and test play it, provided I got<br/>
&gt;time ;)<br/>
