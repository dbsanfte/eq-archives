<div id="ygrps-yiv-300031778">I have not been playing for 3 days. I did notice the excitement we once had b4 is not there no more. partly the game is not as interesting anymore.<br/>
these r just thoughts. i didnt think them thru . just jot it down as it comes to mind. no spell checks too.<br/>
1) Lvling and lvling , nothing but just lvling.....sux. <br/>
2) questing is much more interesting(personal perference).i think with a small group is even better.<br/>
3) I dun mind NOT lvling sometimes. , I enjoy beening able to PL some of u guys at mobs. its fun in group of local kakis. no xp.. big deal :P<br/>
4) I have group with Galarion, Kailli, Avengeline and Kalli at lake. I hope to group again with them.But my nite game timely sux. long time ago...was with Leshrec , Zandaerion adn the gang.....<br/>
5) I make friends with other guild and indiviuals...enemies too.. lol. I get invits to some guild grouping at times.<br/>
6) Guild outing ,  i  suggest should be a quest or specific mob target, LOWER (blue) for most so it doent become  corpse retriveing excerise. Whats the point ? low blue? propbaly items got already? well. the point is we do things together. pass the stuff to lower level, sell them whatever.hell, start a guild war!. Just enjoy.<br/>
7) wanna hit 50th lvl? now at 35th.. hey . spend another 6 months lor. if not what to do?( see above)<br/>
8) i enjoy lvl 15th to 25th the most. why?<br/>
9) will all of us be around EQ 6 months from now? some. prob. 50%. maybe less<br/>
10) Im waiting for a cool new on-line game. pull some of u guys along. We need new refreshing STUFF!<br/>
11) one day...... Im nerfing EQ. and u know what?  im NOT patching it.<br/>
<br/>
BiBi  .,...<br/>
going out of his mind.....<br/>
<br/>
psss.. Sereph what the hell im going to  do with 600 bottles of beer in my bank ! ?? :P<br/>

  <br/>
  Hello all,<br/>
  <br/>
  I think it&#39;s time something is done about our guild. We either need more ppl or we need more guild events.<br/>
  Probably the former.Problem is Ziltus and Leshrec no longer play their wizards. Fesse is also semi retired. <br/>
  I already have problems finding ppl to group with as it has been last few weeks. Also we dont seem to have<br/>
  much of an enthusiasm. No offence but i think some things need fixing. Or maybe i&#39;m the only one feeling it hmm...<br/>
  <br/>
  Unlike a few guilds i&#39;ve come to know...we really haven&#39;t had much of a union as a guild. Lvls pobably play one<br/>
  part as it prevents effective guild outings. Other is we seem to have bad luck with any so far hehe.<br/>
  <br/>
  I&#39;d like and hope to see something good that can be done for us all...if not maybe one day i might just leave..<br/>
  no offence i like you guys but i need to be able to have some fun too..it&#39;s hardly fun anymore now for me.<br/>
  I&#39;ll still be on mailing list if i ever leave and i will still give my best at providing any info that no one might have<br/>
  or help if i ever can...<br/>
  <br/>
  Of course that&#39;s only if i leave (which is unlikely) but i&#39;d thought i just bring it up to you all to be fair...<br/>
  Thaks for your time<br/>
  <br/>
  Zanderion Stormseeker <br/>
  lvl 36 mage<br/>
  <br/>
  and yes double xp penalty for dying after every hell lvl...ARGH!<br/>
  just found that out when one whole bubble disappeared</div>
