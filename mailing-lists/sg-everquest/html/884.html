<div id="ygrps-yiv-445308202">Still remember the level 19 warrior. Damn fucked up. this is what he said when<br/>
Einan and I tried to practice a bit of combat skills.<br/>
<br/>
Warrior: That&#39;s very cheap of you to try and steal kills<br/>
Me: ???<br/>
Warrior: You tried to trade with me to prevent me from attacking the mob so<br/>
that your partner can attack it and steal the kill<br/>
Me: Hello, you know something called INSTRUMENT CHANGING? I was trying to equip<br/>
a bloody DRUM.<br/>
Me: And besides, how can a level 7 cleric and 10 BARD steal kills from a<br/>
warrior that&#39;s of higher level than us?<br/>
Warrior: Whatever, I could just take out my BBC and kill off everything(at this<br/>
point, I was starting to hear that damn Shania Twain song playing in my head.<br/>
That don&#39;t impress me much)<br/>
<br/>
Then this goon dashed off into fighting everything that spawn.<br/>
<br/>
2 fights later, HP drop to around 15% (for some reason, I always like to look<br/>
at the HP status of people who pissed me off)<br/>
<br/>
He finally went off and Ziltus, a female warrior, a shaman and us, continue our<br/>
hunt.<br/>

&gt; I suggest North Ro Derv Camp next to mountain for lvl 10-15.  I earned my<br/>
&gt; lvl 13, 14 and 15 there, still giving me so-so xp and good loot at lvl 15.<br/>
&gt;  I hunt with Ser/Einan.  They team and we take turn to kill.  Sometime the<br/>
&gt; place can be quite crowded and pple can just come in without any words and<br/>
&gt; start hunting themselves (ie act blur even they see we already there).  For<br/>
&gt; this type of pple wiz always got the best mean to teach them a lesson -<br/>
&gt; steal their kills when they hunt monsters ard 40% dam, hehe.  No joke, even<br/>
&gt; a lvl 19 warrior lost kill to me, hehehe.  I guess that&#39;s the best<br/>
&gt; &#39;ability&#39; a wiz pocess. ;)<br/>
&gt; Once I get lvl 16, I will go camp 2 since there is more thugs spawning<br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Above lvl 16 I dunno, still havent reach there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think Oasis hunting caimen and croc also not bad xp for lvl 10-15, but<br/>
&gt; the loot is pretty lousy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So far I&#39;m quite &#39;conservative&#39; in hunting - only been to BB, G Faydark,<br/>
&gt; CB, EC, WC, Ro and Oasis.  Places like Guk or L Faydark not counted coz I<br/>
&gt; go there kena killed very fast - not to mentioned any xp or loot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe it&#39;s time we go Ak&#39;Anon for some mino hunting?  Garren, Yiyang and<br/>
&gt; Leshrec can take mino knight/hero while the rest take mino slave, hehe.<br/>
&gt;  Alternatively is to go back CB hunt trainer (for small shinny shield) and<br/>
&gt; derv - always wanna go back CB hunt coz I died too many times there, can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; forget the damn place, haha.  If u like role-playing quest, I dun mind we<br/>
&gt; go back CB one day and do the quest for screaming mace.  I think that will<br/>
&gt; be the best item currently we can give to our SOWer Trifrost and healer<br/>
&gt; Einan (must get this healer lvl up fast).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tonight I will con&#39;t to brew for 1-2 hrs b4 going to Ro derv camp again.<br/>
&gt;  Ser & Ein, join me if interested ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ziltus<br/>
