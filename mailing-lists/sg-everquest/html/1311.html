Recently, there have been a spate of mergers, DBS & POSBANK, Sembawang<br/>
& STIC, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Rumours in the market have it that Lum Chang and Haw Par plan to merge - the<br/>
proposed new name for the company is, you have guessed it - Lum Par.<br/>
However, it is suspected that SES will object to this, since it would be<br/>
deemed not proper for lady brokers and remisiers to transact LP shares on<br/>
behalf of their male clients.  Morever, Lum Par name seems very crude and it<br/>
means scrotum in Hokkien.<br/>
<br/>
For e.g. The people : &quot; How much is Lum Par now?&quot;, &quot; I want to sell Lum Par at 60 cents.&quot;<br/>
The male broker : &quot; How much do you want to buy Lum Par?&quot;<br/>
The female broker : &quot; Lum Par, 60 cents, sold!&quot;<br/>
The newspaper : &quot; Good management lifts Lum Par.&quot;, &quot;Lum Par drops again.&quot;,<br/>
&quot;Lum Par suspended.&quot;, &quot;Plunging Lum Par needs Viagra&quot;, &quot;Lum Par is being<br/>
squeezed out as market leader.&quot;<br/>
The employees : &quot; We are Lum Par employees.&quot;<br/>
The interviewer : &quot; Mr. Tan, you have written in your resume that your last<br/>
company was ...er... Lum Par.  Did they treat you so badly that you have to<br/>
put in an abusive term for them?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Share buyer was heard doing a transaction with his remisier over the<br/>
handphone inside the MRT train.<br/>
Buyer : &quot; Hey, Mr . Tan buy for me Lum Par... Neng Liap (literally: buy for<br/>
me 2 lots of Lum Par shares)<br/>
Remisier: &quot; I can&#39;t hear you properly.  Please repeat your buy order louder.&quot;<br/>
Buyer (very loud):  &quot; Lum Par lah.... Neng Liap...OK?&quot;<br/>
All the commuters : Stunned, especially the ladies.<br/>

A woman called the Canon help desk with a problem with her printer. The<br/>
tech asked her if she was &quot;running it under Windows.&quot; The woman then<br/>
responded, &quot;No, my desk is next to the door. But that is a good point.<br/>
The man sitting in the cubicle next to me is under a window, and his is working fine.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Tech Support: &quot;OK Bob, let&#39;s press the control and escape keys at the<br/>
same time. That brings up a task list in the middle of the screen. Now<br/>
type the letter &#39;P&#39; to bring up the Program Manager.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Customer: &quot;I don&#39;t have a &#39;P&#39;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tech Support: &quot;On your keyboard, Bob.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Customer: &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tech Support: &quot;&#39;P&#39; on your keyboard, Bob.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Customer: &quot;I&#39;m not going to do that!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Overheard in a computer shop:<br/>
<br/>
Customer: &quot;I&#39;d like a mouse mat, please.&quot; Salesperson: &quot;Certainly sir,<br/>
we&#39;ve got a large variety.&quot; Customer: &quot;But will they be compatible with<br/>
my computer?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I once received a fax with a note on the bottom to fax the document back<br/>
to the sender when I was finished with it, because he needed to keep it.<br/>
<br/>
Customer: &quot;Can you copy the Internet for me on this diskette?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I work for a local ISP. Frequently we receive phone calls that start something like this:<br/>
<br/>
Customer: &quot;Hi. Is this the Internet?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some people pay for their online services with checks made payable to<br/>
&quot;The Internet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Customer: &quot;So that&#39;ll get me connected to the Internet, right?&quot; Tech Support: &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Customer: &quot;And that&#39;s the latest version of the Internet, right?&quot; Tech<br/>
Support: &quot;Uhh...uh...uh...yeah.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tech Support: &quot;All right...now double-click on the File Manager icon.&quot;<br/>
Customer: &quot;That&#39;s why I hate this Windows -- because of the icons -- I&#39;m<br/>
a Protestant, and I don&#39;t believe in icons.&quot; Tech Support: &quot;Well, that&#39;s<br/>
just an industry term sir. I don&#39;t believe it was meant to--&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Customer: &quot;I don&#39;t care about any &#39;Industry Terms&#39;. I don&#39;t believe in icons.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tech Support: &quot;Well...why don&#39;t you click on the &#39;little picture&#39; of a <br/>
file cabinet...is &#39;little picture&#39; OK?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Customer: [click]<br/>
<br/>
Customer: &quot;My computer crashed!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tech Support: &quot;It crashed?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Customer: &quot;Yeah, it won&#39;t let me play my game.&quot; Tech Support: &quot;All<br/>
right, hit Control-Alt-Delete to reboot.&quot; Customer: &quot;No, it didn&#39;t crash<br/>
-- it crashed.&quot; Tech Support: &quot;Huh?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Customer: &quot;I crashed my game. That&#39;s what I said before. I crashed my<br/>
spaceship and now it doesn&#39;t work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tech Support: &quot;Click on &#39;File,&#39; then &#39;New Game.&#39;&quot; Customer: [pause]<br/>
&quot;Wow! How&#39;d you learn how to do that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>

Here&#39;s what happened when you date ... <br/>
<br/>
Caucasian women<br/>
First date:      You get to kiss her goodnight<br/>
Second date:  You get to grope all over and make out<br/>
Third date:      You get to have sex in the missionary position<br/>
                         Then you promise to marry her but will probably abandon the idea.<br/>
<br/>
Japanese women<br/>
First date:      She&#39;s shy, so you don&#39;t get to kiss her at all<br/>
Second date:  She&#39;ll take a bath in front of you and let you smell her panties<br/>
Third date:      You get to have kinky sex with her. Then she will bid you sayonara<br/>
                         as that was her fling before getting married to a Japanese man<br/>
<br/>
Malay women<br/>
First date:       You get to touch that big breast of hers<br/>
Second date:   You get to home base with her<br/>
Third date:       You have to promise her that you are gonna get circumcised.<br/>
                          Then you will marry her and find out that you have to support her whole family.<br/>
                          The only consolation is that you get to repeat the procedure<br/>
                          three other times as allowed under Muslim law.<br/>
<br/>
Chinese women<br/>
First date:         You get to buy her an expensive dinner but nothing happened<br/>
Second date:    You buy her an even more expensive but nothing happened too<br/>
Third date:        You don&#39;t even get to the third date and you have already<br/>
                           realised nothing is going to happen.</div>
