<b>Subject:</b> Clarification on Stealing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-663641270">I&#39;m now based at HH, soloing.  Downtime is long but get all the xp. <br/>
 Actually if wiz wanna play punk we can rise lvl pretty fast, by stealing <br/>
(huh? Leshrec is rising lvl fast? well...errr..hehehehe).  So far what I <br/>
did is to attack the moment when the mob spawn, which normally draw the mob <br/>
to me and turn to a melee + casting battle.  This way is quite ok, but some <br/>
pple at Ro still call me a stealer.  They forget that my down time is so <br/>
long (normally used up at least 80% of my mana and 1-2 bubb of my HP).  For <br/>
this kinda pple I normally scold back or use the ignore command on them. <br/>
 Those wizs in HH really &quot;aim&#39; nicely and start nuking when the mob hp drop <br/>
by 30-40% (At one time I just sit next to them and observe how they hunt). <br/>
 Btw the time mob turn to them, the mob only left 10-20% HP.  If I were to <br/>
follow their style, I think I will lvl much faster, coz this method means <br/>
they just nuke 2 times (hurt more than 50%) and let others finish their <br/>
kill, and they got less down time and more loot.  H/w, this method also <br/>
spoil a wiz reputation and not very nice to do, so I choose the harder way. <br/>
 So for all the new comers out there, pls do not make noise if a wiz is <br/>
using his body to tank and got a kill just becoz he kill faster then u. <br/>
 Make him frustrated he may change his mind and start &quot;stealing&quot; from u, <br/>
hehe.  If u wish to take turns to kill, pls ask when u enter a camp.  Me <br/>
personally quite bo chap if those high lvl players just step in and start <br/>
hunting.  My opinion is - if they just step in and hunt, they are trying to <br/>
compete for kills, so no need to give way.  I ever come across a necro from <br/>
Higher Order of Arcane at lvl 16 (name is Malten), and he spam me for <br/>
stealing his kill, simply becoz I nuke and his pet attack same time.  Of <br/>
coz, my nuking is far more damaging than his little pet, draw the mob to me <br/>
and he spam all the way.  So irritating that I use the ignore command on <br/>
him, heheh.  Btw, one of the big stealers at HH now is Senear, the lvl 17 <br/>
wiz, also from Higher Order of Arcane.  He and another guildmate of his <br/>
were nuking whole day at HH yesterday.  They steal from groups of lvl <br/>
18-20+ melee fighters.  In the end the other groups all invite me to join <br/>
theirs becoz they can see I only nuke and dun steal, and my nuking plus <br/>
their melee can take back some kills.<br/>
<br/>
Last piece of advice, if u are camping at certain spot, and a wiz of lvl 16 <br/>
(below lvl 16 we still quite sux, hehe) and above is also camping there, <br/>
either ask for rotation or move elsewhere.  A wiz can steal from a melee <br/>
char of 8-10 lvl above him.  No joke.  Even if you are are in a full house <br/>
of melee chars of the same lvl as that wiz, the wiz can still steal, if he <br/>
wants.  So if the newcomers come across this kinda CB players, it&#39;s wiser <br/>
to move on to another camp, coz it&#39;s only waste of time to stay there (u <br/>
are helpnig him to kill only).<br/>
<br/>
Btw, even wiz can be quite guai lan at time, but IMHO the most seah-lan is <br/>
high lvl enchanter.  Not only they just hunt by charming mobs to kill <br/>
themselves (ie hunt without even using their hands, heh). Make them <br/>
frustrated they can train all the mobs on u, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
FYI, if u hunt around NRo, there is a PvP dwarf name Broughm who like to <br/>
train SG to non-PvP players, I bet this is the only way he can kill those <br/>
non-PvP players.  Kinda sick minded - kill for the fun of killing.  He <br/>
train cutts to me twice, one time almost kill me and 2nd time killed <br/>
himself, heh.<br/>
