<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095217281">I on guide assignment now. So that&#39;s another reason why I&#39;m MIA. Just<br/>
leave a note on ICQ if you need a group Zan. I log in these days to Inno<br/>
only base on request.<br/>
<br/>
About the guild, that&#39;s why I called a meeting on Saturday, too bad it<br/>
was heavily screwed up.......<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hello all, I think it&#39;s time something is done about our guild. We<br/>
&gt; either need more ppl or we need more guild events.Probably the<br/>
&gt; former.Problem is Ziltus and Leshrec no longer play their wizards.<br/>
&gt; Fesse is also semi retired.I already have problems finding ppl to<br/>
&gt; group with as it has been last few weeks. Also we dont seem to<br/>
&gt; havemuch of an enthusiasm. No offence but i think some things need<br/>
&gt; fixing. Or maybe i&#39;m the only one feeling it hmm... Unlike a few<br/>
&gt; guilds i&#39;ve come to know...we really haven&#39;t had much of a union as a<br/>
&gt; guild. Lvls pobably play onepart as it prevents effective guild<br/>
&gt; outings. Other is we seem to have bad luck with any so far hehe. I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; like and hope to see something good that can be done for us all...if<br/>
&gt; not maybe one day i might just leave..no offence i like you guys but i<br/>
&gt; need to be able to have some fun too..it&#39;s hardly fun anymore now for<br/>
&gt; me.I&#39;ll still be on mailing list if i ever leave and i will still give<br/>
&gt; my best at providing any info that no one might haveor help if i ever<br/>
&gt; can... Of course that&#39;s only if i leave (which is unlikely) but i&#39;d<br/>
&gt; thought i just bring it up to you all to be fair...Thaks for your<br/>
&gt; time Zanderion Stormseekerlvl 36 mage and yes double xp penalty for<br/>
&gt; dying after every hell lvl...ARGH!just found that out when one whole<br/>
&gt; bubble disappeared </span></blockquote></div>
