<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366008193">Hi, it&#39;s me again.  Guess 90% of the msg so far r from Wilson, Gary and me <br/>
;) Pai seh.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I haven&#39;t get EQ yet, but I&#39;m expecting alot from it, so can&#39;t <br/>
wait to find out more info abt the game, hope u guys dun mind ;)<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone share their experience in char creation, esp for newbies (hmm, <br/>
more for all-rounded chars with best &#39;advantages&#39; in the game):<br/>
- Which race?<br/>
- Which character?<br/>
- Which skills you pick in the begining, and what skills you intend to pick <br/>
up later?<br/>
- Stats?<br/>
<br/>
Even for those who is new to the game, let&#39;s set an open mind and discuss <br/>
what char u have made so far, what advantages/disadvantages you encountered <br/>
so far, etc etc ;)<br/>
