&gt;Thx to Garren and Tri for the blessings.  I might be cutting my gaming a<br/>
&gt;bit but dun worry I cut down too much.  My wife already know my style many<br/>
&gt;yrs ago and as long as I dun overplay, she won&#39;t nag at me, hehe.  Frankly<br/>
&gt;speaking, I really think we shld come out for a gathering every now and<br/>
&gt;then, like my UO kakis (some also in D2 and EQ).  Even it&#39;s just a coffee<br/>
&gt;talk-cock-sing-song session, it will help to bring us closer and understand<br/>
&gt;one another. </span></blockquote></div>
