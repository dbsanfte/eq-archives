<div id="ygrps-yiv-507113951">i dunno bout the rest of the mobs... but Drez gives key to all the room...<br/>
but not all one shot... just sometimes this key... sometimes another... but<br/>
she will give key to all rooms... i think when both necros con green to u<br/>
they wont be a problem liao... the main prob is just folks there camping<br/>
with u... if they are low... they will draw all the mobs.. n u end up<br/>
fighting everything...<br/>
i think camping alone is not good enough... should drez decides to multiple<br/>
harm touch... u r dead meat... unless u can kill her in one shot.... which u<br/>
cant... i have seen 2 level 34 wiz kill her in less than 5 seconds... they<br/>
were there with the help of a level 34 cleric also... since they do get<br/>
damaged by drez sometimes.. n each harm touch is like 300 dmg...<br/>

&gt; So can I say, must defeat the following mobs b4 getting keys to next room?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ogre captain carries key to Rathyl&#39;s room<br/>
&gt; Rathyl carries key to Drelzna&#39;s room<br/>
&gt; Drelzna carries key to Najena&#39;s room<br/>
&gt; Najena carries key to her own room (I confirmed this liao)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Btw, thou&#39; these keys are no rent, u can still use the item-bag-bank trick<br/>
&gt; to keep it in bank when u logout (also confirmed by me).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway I have no intention to camp for Jboot now until I reach lvl 34 (new<br/>
&gt; spells), which I think those guards guarding Drelzna shld con green to me<br/>
&gt; and won&#39;t help when I attack Drelzna, true?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Najena<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s an &quot;old&quot; article i saved in my EQ folder of Dungeons.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I hope is still relevent, with all em&#39; patches and stuff.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Najena is a very popular dungeon for characters level 15-30 that is<br/>
&gt; located<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the zone of lavastorm. To find Najena you can take a right upon<br/>
&gt; entering<br/>
&gt; &gt; lavastorm and follow the mountains. You will see the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Najena ruins in the distance. Najena is a spooky dungeon filled with a<br/>
&gt; green<br/>
&gt; &gt; fog throughout.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The entrance area is not too easy you will find greater skeletons and<br/>
&gt; ogre<br/>
&gt; &gt; guards that range in the 15ish level range. Deeper in you will find<br/>
&gt; elements<br/>
&gt; &gt; and tentacle terrors. The first few rooms are the ones most<br/>
&gt; &gt; often occupied by characters level 15-20. There are two other areas in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; dungeon however for characters of higher levels. They must be visited in<br/>
&gt; &gt; order.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The first area is a secret room that will be to the left down on of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; hallways. This room lies behind an illusionary wall that you can walk<br/>
&gt; right<br/>
&gt; &gt; through. From this room you will see two passages. The door to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; left of here leads to some level 20ish skeletons. The passage downstairs<br/>
&gt; &gt; leads to the meat of this portion of the dungeon.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You will find many necromancers and ogre&#39;s down in this area. However<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; prized opponents in this area are Bonecrusher, the Ogre Captain and the<br/>
&gt; Ogre<br/>
&gt; &gt; Officer.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bonecrusher is in a room to the left near the bottom of the stairs. He<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; a room with 2 necromancers. Bonecrusher is a froglock ghoul who is level<br/>
&gt; 24.<br/>
&gt; &gt; He is sought after for the magic items that he carries. This<br/>
&gt; &gt; includes flesh rings and barbed leather whips.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; To the right of the bottom of the stairs and down a corridor you will<br/>
&gt; find<br/>
&gt; &gt; the captains room. The captain is a level 27ish mob who is quite deadly.<br/>
&gt; He<br/>
&gt; &gt; is guarded by several ogres including an officer who is in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 24-25ish range. The captain carries a key to Rathyl&#39;s room as well<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; the occasional ogre maul or large bronze platemail piece of armor.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The keys you get from the monsters in this area will allow you to go to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; real juicy part of this dungeon: behind the Najena sign. If you<br/>
continued<br/>
&gt; &gt; straight when entering the dungeon you would undoubtedly<br/>
&gt; &gt; have noticed a Najena sign with some magicians guarding the entrance.<br/>
&gt; Behind<br/>
&gt; &gt; this sign lies the three major spellcasting NPC&#39;s in this zone: Rathyl,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Drelzna and Najena.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; These NPC&#39;s must be visited in that order. Each NPC has the key to the<br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; &gt; ones chamber as well as having a key out of their chamber(to hand out to<br/>
&gt; &gt; party members). The Drelzna and Najena keys are no<br/>
&gt; &gt; rent meaning that if you log out they will dissapear. None of these<br/>
NPC&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; spawn every time and there is an anti camp radius code implemented so<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; you cannot simply camp by their lairs. This can be frustrating<br/>
&gt; &gt; at first but with a little practice you will be able to learn their<br/>
&gt; &gt; patterns.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t want to get into specifics here as something has to be left to<br/>
&gt; &gt; chance(and it would be hard to describe anyway) so i&#39;m just going to<br/>
&gt; roughly<br/>
&gt; &gt; describe each NPC and an example of what you might find on<br/>
&gt; &gt; them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rathyl is a necromancer who is guarded by several magicians. He is a<br/>
&gt; deadly<br/>
&gt; &gt; foe even after death as his reincarnation will appear and have to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; destroyed all over again! A typical item you might find from<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rathyl would be a traveller&#39;s backpack.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Drelzna is guarded by 2 necromancers. Both the necromancers as well as<br/>
&gt; &gt; Drelzna can charm. This may be the toughest fight of them all perhaps<br/>
&gt; even<br/>
&gt; &gt; tougher than Najena. One of Drelzna&#39;s prized possessions<br/>
&gt; &gt; is the journeyman boots.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Najena is guarded by a couple of magicians. Najena is perhaps the rarest<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; them all and is the most powerful alone. Drelzna may be a tougher kill<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; this is only because of her guards. One of Najena&#39;s prized<br/>
&gt; &gt; possessions is the flowing black robe.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Enjoy<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; YY<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; btw. get a map.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;May I know which mob carry the key to Jboot room?  Where can I find it?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What lvl is the mob carrying the key and does it has other guard mobs<br/>
&gt; also<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;(what lvl if yes)?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;How abt the room tat drops Jboot?  What mobs and lvl inside?  I heard<br/>
&gt; tat<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;room is tougher than Najena room (of coz Najena herself is still the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;toughest mob in the dungeon) due to those necro guards which can charm<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;players.  What other artifacts can we find in the room?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;All info welcome, thx.<br/>
