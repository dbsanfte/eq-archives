<div id="ygrps-yiv-838855572">Actually I feel that locals playing together is pretty good enuf, not <br/>
necessary to form an official guild.  My UO guild started off with only 4-5 <br/>
locals, purely for the sake of helping one another, play together rather <br/>
than to form an formal guild.  I also can&#39;t remember since when more and <br/>
more players seek to join us ;)  Most importantly, no matter we role-play <br/>
as good or evil, dun &#39;seah shui&#39; S&#39;poreans&#39; faces, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is the existing players can post more info abt the game, <br/>
particularly the game play performance in each shard.  I bet most of the <br/>
local players are still in a stage of below lvl 20, and it&#39;s still not too <br/>
difficult for all to shift to the best shard to play in.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m now waiting for my copy of EQ, and sincerely appreciate all in-game <br/>
info posted by local players ;)  I personally look for a lag-free server <br/>
with good server down time close to our timezone, so that I dun have to <br/>
come back home from work just to wait for server to come up *grin*.<br/>

&gt; Greetings,<br/>
&gt; In one of my last posts, I mentioned that I would doubt a Singapore Guild<br/>
&gt; forming for at least the next 8 months cos...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A)You need at least 10 regular memebers that play frequently.<br/>
&gt; B)You need to upkeep the guild *IF* I am right ;-)<br/>
&gt; C)You have to have a reputation...<br/>
&gt; D)The guild must be organised I guess, not like UO where I go around <br/>

&gt; &gt; H/w, some of us are coming over to EQ (ie play both games, not migrate<br/>
&gt; &gt; totally), maybe as a new guild or using old guild name.  So far no<br/>
&gt; concrete<br/>
