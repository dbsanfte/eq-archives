&gt; Even thou&#39; EQ allow bigger lvl gap in group for high lvl players, I<br/>
&gt; personally still find it better to stick close to 2 or less for lvl 10 &<br/>
&gt; below group.  I was grouping with Eldor (lvl 12) and Yiyang (lvl 14~15)<br/>
&gt; over the weekend, and I&#39;m lvl 9.  No doubt I got the gaining XP msg, but<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; a whole my xp gain very slow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the other hand I solo last night fighting only rattlesnake (blue/green<br/>
&gt; to me), my xp gain faster.  This shows that no doubt grouping allows u to<br/>
&gt; hunt more powerful monsters, but it&#39;s more advisable to hunt with someone<br/>
&gt; close to you lvl.  Yiyang and I also try a trick he mentioned previously -<br/>
&gt; ie we group and fight a monster, b4 the monster dies, he quit from group<br/>
&gt; and let me get the xp.  Np doubt I will get the xp but I think it&#39;s still<br/>
&gt; lesser from my solo hunt last night.  I think this trick dones&#39;t work very<br/>
&gt; well, but I must thank Yiyang for his time training me and let me getting<br/>
&gt; the loot ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve decided to delete Zilred (enchanter tonight) and concentrate on my<br/>
&gt; wiz.  Can someone help me to transfer items from Zilred to Ziltus tonight?<br/>
&gt;  Both are now at Freeport. Actually Zilred got nothing much except few<br/>
&gt; cloth and a staff, but I really need $$$ badly to buy scrolls.  Lvl 9 now<br/>
&gt; but my lvl 3 spells are not even half-filled, sigh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those lvl 8-9 players (lvl 8 tank and lvl 9 mages), the desert behind<br/>
&gt; inn 2 of east commonland is quite a nice place to hunt solo.  U still have<br/>
&gt; to con the skeleton and rattlesnake b4 u fight them, thou&#39; so far most r<br/>
&gt; blue to me.  When fighting rattlesnake, make sure you life never drop<br/>
below<br/>
&gt; 2.5 bubbles coz if it poisons u b4 it die, the poison will take around 1<br/>
&gt; bubble (for a weak wiz like me) b4 it cure by itself.  The snake skin can<br/>
&gt; be found quite easily and cost 1 gp each.  Occasionally u can also find<br/>
&gt; puma there, which is less dangerous than rattlesnake.  H/w, the spot is<br/>
&gt; pretty close to a mummy lair, u gotta be careful when hunting there coz<br/>
&gt; sometime mummy will come out and it&#39;s agro.  I got killed 3 times last<br/>
&gt; night by mummy while fighting snake/skeletonm, but the place is pretty<br/>
&gt; close to freeport gate so running there is not a problem.  Most of the<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; if u r alert, you shld be able to run back to the inn and let the guard<br/>
&gt; protect u (not when u are stunned by mummy, like in my case).  As wiz has<br/>
&gt; very low HP and AC, I have to mediate after every 1-2 battle.  Also note<br/>
&gt; that graffin visit inn 2 quite often (as compared with inn 4 which I<br/>
hunted<br/>
&gt; earlier).  If u wanna see guard died, stay there for 10~15 min and u will<br/>
&gt; get to see the big fight between graffin and guard, hehe, of coz guard<br/>
&gt; always got killed lor ;)  Due to the danger outside inn, it&#39;s safer to<br/>
&gt; maediate INSIDE inn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One last thing, try not to attack asp even thou it&#39;s con blue to u.  This<br/>
&gt; CB snake is damn poisonous as compare to rattlesnake.  Once poisoned, it<br/>
&gt; will drain up to 2.5 bubbles HP.  And remember this (&%&$^%#@# Arrowmage,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; think he is a lvl 20~30 char.  I was poisoned last night by an asp and<br/>
&gt; managed to run back to inn but my HP keep dropping very fast.  I keep<br/>
&gt; asking him to heal me and he simply bo chap.  He stand and see my HP keep<br/>
&gt; dropping steady.  Lucky the poison cure by itself when I left 5 HP!  He<br/>
&gt; then ask &quot;help of what huh?&quot;, damn KNN CB.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the other hand, if you meet a lvl 15 lady wood elf druid at freeport<br/>
&gt; gate, name Arsafil, greet her nicely.  She is a very helpful Japanese<br/>
&gt; player who have help me several times.  She always give food/drink to me,<br/>
&gt; not 5 or 10 each but 20~30 each!  She will also bind/SoW/armor/invis u for<br/>
&gt; free if u ask her, one of the nicest helpful players I met in EQ.  ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any lvl 8~10 players wanna group hunting in EC?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ziltus.<br/>
