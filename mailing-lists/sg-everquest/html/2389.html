<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770764312">Err, for the fish, I go a way round it rather than to wait 2 min (thou&#39; I <br/>
got my fish after someone kill it for 2 min, hehe):<br/>
<br/>
1. Ask a kakis to create a mule, u team with kakis mule.<br/>
2. Kakis do and kill fish while u stay on land.<br/>
3. Once kakis kills fish, u jump in to loot (u can loot immediately since u <br/>
2 r grp&#39;d).<br/>
4. U will not get faction hit coz u did not involved in the fight and stay <br/>
a distant from the battle.<br/>
<br/>
Note than some pple say they got faction msg sometime even they didnt <br/>
involve in the fight, which is TRUE coz it happened to me b4.  The reason <br/>
behind is bcoz u r the PRIMARY target the mob intend to attack in the 1st <br/>
place and someone pull from u b4 it hit u.  In this case, you are consider <br/>
&#39;involved&#39; in the fight and get faction hit ;)<br/>
<br/>
Stein price is dropping, since it&#39;s still quite easy to do it (just like <br/>
FBR, seem like it&#39;s so common to see any tom, dick and harry caster owning <br/>
this 2).  I suggest all quickly lvl to 40 and go hunt ROO b4 the value drop <br/>
like FBR :)  At least it&#39;s a sure spawn, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; As you all know by now, alot of quest artifacts are now NODROP,<br/>
&gt; and that includes the Koalindl Fish Corpse that is so crucial to the<br/>
&gt; Glowing Stein quest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So the sequence goes like this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fish corpse NODROP (plus some other items) -----&gt; Bartender&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Compendium NODROP in Freeport.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bartender&#39;s Compendium NODROP ------&gt; Glowing Stein in Oggok<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As you can see, the chain of items is NODROP all the way. This<br/>
&gt; makes it alot trickier, since the person who eventually goes to<br/>
&gt; Oggok (most likely an enchanter or someone with good faction with<br/>
&gt; ogres) MUST be the one to loot the fish for it&#39;s corpse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only safe way around this is to again use the mule character<br/>
&gt; tactic, but this time, the person actually doing the quest must be<br/>
&gt; there, ready to pounce and loot the fish corpse. The corpse will be<br/>
&gt; lootable solely by the person who gets the kill/xp, for the first 2<br/>
&gt; minutes, after which it becomes free-looting. So all you have to do<br/>
&gt; is wait for 2 minutes... This method has been confirmed through<br/>
&gt; testing by me, Sereph and Trifrost. Just watch out for other players<br/>
&gt; waiting for such an oppurtunity as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; An alternative method, which has not been tested, and could have<br/>
&gt; more potential risk, is to group with the mule character who kills<br/>
&gt; the fish, but stay far far away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Theoretically, because you do not personally initiate combat with<br/>
&gt; the fish, the guards/clerics/paladins should not KOS you, and you<br/>
&gt; should not get faction hits. But you should still be able to loot the<br/>
&gt; corpse since you are in the same group as the killer, so no need to<br/>
&gt; wait for 2 minutes. This method not tested yet...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s all for now I guess...<br/>
