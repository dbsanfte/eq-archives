<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-611149013">I guess most of u know my stand on steal killin. I have been observing this<br/>
&quot;stealin&quot; trend . The bottom line is usually 2 things 1) lvling-xp  2) loot<br/>
items. Well, the others cool stuffs in EQ is often neglected. LOL  , some<br/>
does,nt even know whats &quot;life&quot; outside of Xp and loots.<br/>
<br/>
As more player lvl upwards., prime named mobs will be the main target of<br/>
&#39;desire&#39; . there  r only a handful of named mob with special items on then<br/>
as compared to a orc or Derv camp of 5-6 mobs. Stealin is gotta get  very<br/>
very bad. Its not goin to get any better.<br/>
<br/>
How we, an individual and as a Guild/Group distinguish ourselves is the<br/>
point here. I believe we should established ourselves as a dignified group<br/>
of people who  stands up against unethical thievery .<br/>
<br/>
Someone like Voyerbian has no place among us. Unless he repent of his ways.<br/>
The loud mouth type of people like &quot;Amii&quot;  is just  plain ol&#39; loud mouth. we<br/>
stake our stand and give this type of ppl hell. we tracked them down . train<br/>
mob to them(ethical?) and make their life hell if need be.<br/>
<br/>
ANy one of u spoken to Wylven besides Ziltus about Voy?  Qui H&#39;oom dai aint<br/>
too bad, with almost 60 members it gives us access to a bigger pool of ppl<br/>
to group . Wylven is not a bad guy too. BUT if it comes to the crunch im for<br/>
u guys to have our guild. U hav emy support......  and a contribution of<br/>
1pp.....<br/>

&gt;Hey guys, just to share an &#39;interesting&#39; thing I came across last night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;B4 I met Garren and the guys for Dragoon Dirk hunt, I went to trainer hill,<br/>
&gt;hoping to get an SBS for some quick buck.  I was invis all the way, as<br/>
&gt;usual hehe, and saw this lvl 15 magi from Higher Order of Arcane, Amii and<br/>
&gt;few other players.  So I ask her is there any killing order which I can<br/>
&gt;join, she said no, it&#39;s FFA.  Ok fine then, I love FFA, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Later when a trainer spawn, everyone rush in and this Amii also nuke with<br/>
&gt;her pet, one force shock from me killed the mob.  I looted the mob and<br/>
&gt;found nothing.  Then this Amii keep asking me what lvl and I refused to<br/>
&gt;tell her.  She then start to &#39;order&#39; me to take turns.  What is this man?<br/>
&gt; When things are good for her, she ask for FFA, when thing turns against<br/>
&gt;her she ask to take turn.  I didnt wanna refuse directly and keep saying<br/>
&gt;since she want FFA, it shalll be a FFA.  She then start shouting all over<br/>
&gt;and say I&#39;m a stealer who is not willing to take turns.  Later, Einan join<br/>
&gt;in the fun and managed to win the kill out of her, even he is actually 1<br/>
&gt;lvl below Amii, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This Amii is giving everyone lot of problem, and FF also told me she give<br/>
&gt;him hell lots of shit the night b4 when FF hunt at trainer hill.  Later she<br/>
&gt;even auction to offer 2pp for anyone who hurt Dvinn to almost death, train<br/>
&gt;it to her and zone off so that she can kill Dvinn for the loot and xp, LOL.<br/>
&gt; Knn I will pay her 3pp to do it for me man.  To think she wear gossmer<br/>
&gt;robe at lvl 15, I dunno how many kills/SBS she already got after camping<br/>
&gt;whole day in trainer hill ;).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I say, nuke the hell out of her, if anyone camp at CB, hahahahahaha!<br/>
