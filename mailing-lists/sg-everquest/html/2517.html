<div id="ygrps-yiv-53559433">Hi guys,<br/>
<br/>
Surprised to say I didnt miss EQ over the weekend when I didn&#39;t login ;) <br/>
 Instead I login UO to settle some housing issues.  UO will be implementing <br/>
a major item patch tomorrow, and I spend my weekend preparing for it.<br/>
<br/>
After this item patch, a skill management patch will come shortly, which <br/>
greatly enhance the role-playing element of UO.  With this skill patch, I <br/>
will do lots of macroing when I sleep at night, hehe, till I get all the <br/>
chars I want.<br/>
<br/>
With all these new patches, UO is becoming a much better game.  I must <br/>
admit I&#39;m kinda bored with camping, lvling, hack and slash in EQ....and I <br/>
think there is a lack of motivation for me to login EQ, even when I have <br/>
nothing to do at home (in the end spend time watching TV series, hehe).<br/>
<br/>
Just to inform all that I will not show my face in EQ often in the month of <br/>
Oct, mainly due to many things I need to settle with the new UO patches <br/>
(plus some guild matters too).  I hope EQ will still attract me after Oct, <br/>
or else I may consider selling away my acct, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Other than sorting my house items during the weekend, I didnt go for any <br/>
hunting in UO.  Meeting all my good old buddies already take up half of my <br/>
UO login time (sparred with some of them and still kill them, hehe).  There <br/>
is no arguement that UO has better role-playing element than EQ.  With the <br/>
coming patches which UO will be implement teaming, pvp etc policies like <br/>
EQ, I think more ex-UO players will be draw back from EQ to UO (provided <br/>
they still have an active acct like me, coz UO just conduct a char purge <br/>
last Fri, to delete all chars under acct not active for 3 months).<br/>
<br/>
If you guys wanna play UO, I&#39;m in the Baja shard ;)<br/>

p/s: This is not a quiting-EQ msg, dun get me wrong.  Just need to take a <br/>
break from the plain hack-&-slash &#39;routine&#39; work, hehe. ;)</div>
