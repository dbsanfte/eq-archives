&gt; Is Phenix a human melee player?  I remember teaming with a guy name similar<br/>
&gt; and he is the KNN CCB PCB HGK who loot everything whenever he got the<br/>
&gt; chance even thou we all agreed to do alpha loot b4 the hunt.  I think there<br/>
&gt; are always bastards and looters everywhere, whether in UO or EQ.  My style<br/>
&gt; is simple - steal kill from these bastards.  These few days I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; hunting solo in Ro Derv Camp, and there are always 1-3 groups who hunting<br/>
&gt; at the same camp.  As a weak wiz, I can easily used up my mana for every<br/>
&gt; cutt I killed.  Fine, so I will climb to the mountain and med, occasionally<br/>
&gt; stand up and see what are the other guys doing.   So far it&#39;s kinda normal<br/>
&gt; that other parties will get at least 1 kills b4 I come down from the<br/>
&gt; mountain with full mana, if not 2 kills per groups.  Yet many players still<br/>
&gt; got the cheek to attack my kill.  Simple right? It&#39;s so obvious to rotate<br/>
&gt; kills with just 2-3 groups, but there is forever cock-face who &#39;blur blur&#39;<br/>
&gt; rush ahead and attacking the cutt.  What I will just do is to wait, wait<br/>
&gt; till they hurt the monster by 30-40%, then I start to nuke and steal the<br/>
&gt; kill.  Hehe, this is something I like most about wiz - nuking - swift as<br/>
&gt; wind, hehe.  And most of the time they will learn to share after the lesson<br/>
&gt; - sometime it&#39;s kinda surprised to see how these players suddently turn so<br/>
&gt; &#39;alert&#39; and finally know whose&#39;s kill is the next spawn, LOL.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another occasion I was hunting with a ranger (both solo), a 3 men group<br/>
&gt; come and ask to take turn to kill.  Fine with me, no harm share abit.<br/>
&gt;  However, once the ranger and the group each take a kill, the group attack<br/>
&gt; the 3rd monsters when I was abt to root&nuke!  WTF??!  I heck care and<br/>
&gt; start nuking what is rightfully mine.  Within 10 sec the cutt is down and I<br/>
&gt; go and loot it.  Guess wat?  I receive a tell from a DE from the group<br/>
&gt; saying something like this &quot;WTF YOU IDIOT KILL STEALER, THAT KILL IS OUR!!<br/>
&gt;  YOU DICK HEAD!!&quot;  Pardon me WTF?  They just tool a kill and they shout at<br/>
&gt; me for stealing their kill? Hehe, so I start to quarrel with that guy and<br/>
&gt; realised that what he meant by &#39;sharing&#39; in the first place is to let<br/>
&gt; EVERYONE at the camp to take a kill!  That mean - if it&#39;s a 6 men team, I<br/>
&gt; will have to wait for them to kill 6 times b4 I get mine, hehe.  Kinda<br/>
&gt; shocked, but can anyone on the list enlighten me - is this the way EQ share<br/>
&gt; kills?  I myself so far join several groups but none practice this.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wrong but it really sound kinda funny to me ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt;     2 days ago, I was at Befallen hunting for a BBC (which I don&#39;t need,<br/>
&gt; &gt; just wanna get one to sell of cash, I&#39;m broke. Trust me, even when u<br/>
&gt; &gt; reach my lvl, u will still be struggling for $$$). The party consist of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Garren (ie me), Ironbuket, Iyenya, Senorn and Phenix. We were lucky that<br/>
&gt; &gt; the first Troll SK we killed had the BBC. That was the end of the good<br/>
&gt; &gt; part. Phenix then immediately stole the BBC and refuses to pass over the<br/>
&gt; &gt; BBC to me (funny thing was that they agreed to do alpha loot and my name<br/>
&gt; &gt; ended up as first. But I did said that the group can buy the BBC and<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll spilt the cash with the group). And when he (ie Phenix) tried to<br/>
&gt; &gt; run out of Befallen, he died. Okie, that would have been end of story.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Guy looted group BBC and died on his way out, and loses his stuff. But,<br/>
&gt; &gt; we&#39;re kind hearted enough to help him to get his stuff back. Then his<br/>
&gt; &gt; friend Senorn was given permission to loot his corpse. Okie, letting his<br/>
&gt; &gt; friend Senorn loot the Phenix is almost as good as losing the BBC. They<br/>
&gt; &gt; are friends. But, dued to some lag and wierd shit, Senorn dropped his<br/>
&gt; &gt; SBH, and lost the BBC too. Now, Iyenya picked up the SBH. Okie, so we<br/>
&gt; &gt; gotten the SBH instead of the BBC, well it&#39;s better than nothing. But,<br/>
&gt; &gt; we didn&#39;t sell it. We held on to it and see who claim to lose his SBH.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Both Phenix and Senorn claimed to have dropped the SBH and both claimed<br/>
&gt; &gt; that each other had the BBC. But, why did I choose to believe that<br/>
&gt; &gt; Phenix had stolen the BBC (the 2nd time and also con the SBH off Iyenya,<br/>
&gt; &gt; which is likely to belong to Senorn)? B&#39;cos when I went down to Oasis<br/>
&gt; &gt; and asked 1 day later, ppl beside him said that he&#39;s holding a BBC. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; started to taunt him (PRICK was about the kindest thing I said about<br/>
&gt; &gt; him) and challenged him to a duel which Phenix refused. One thing I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; saying is that I&#39;ll never ever want to be in a group with Phenix (who<br/>
&gt; &gt; stole the group BBC and stole/sold his friend Senorn SBH, which Senorn<br/>
&gt; &gt; (a warrior) had to sell off his armor to get another SBH). So if you<br/>
&gt; &gt; ever have to band with Phenix, think again.<br/>
