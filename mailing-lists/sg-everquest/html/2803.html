Upcoming Character Purge  The following was just posted to Common Issues <br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://support.uo.com/c_issue.html">http://support.uo.com/c_issue.html</a>&gt; on the UO.com website:  Upcoming <br/>
Character Purge  Please be advised that we will be deleting accounts that <br/>
have been inactive for 3 months or more (i.e.: accounts that have not paid <br/>
for service for 3 months or longer) next week, January 17 - 21.  Once an <br/>
account is deleted, it will no longer be possible to retrievecharacters or <br/>
items associated with the account. If you own an inactive account and wish <br/>
to return to the world of Ultima Online, this would be an ideal time to <br/>
visit &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ultima-registration.com">http://www.ultima-registration.com</a>&gt; to reactivate the account. We&#39;ll <br/>
be happy to have you back in the game.  Characters on active accounts will <br/>
not be affected by this purge.</div>
