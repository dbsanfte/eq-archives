<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-647051476">After playing my char to lvl 12 in the recent D2 stress test, here are my <br/>
findings:<br/>
1.	The game in stress test is easy, far too easy.  Even my newbie char can <br/>
clear all the dungeon with ease, solve both quests and kill all the bosses. <br/>
 I believe the retailed version will be much tougher.<br/>
2.	The game is far too easy, and this make teaming a redundant choice. <br/>
 Most of the players I&#39;ve teamed with so far (with the intention to enjoy <br/>
team work) end up with 2 outcomes:<br/>
There isn&#39;t enough xp/items/mobs/bosses to be shared among us.<br/>
Pker(s) reveal his true color in the hunting ground and the game turn to a <br/>
predator vs prey game.<br/>
<br/>
Now I do understand pvp is part of the game, like UO, period.  But I <br/>
believe players shld also be given the rights to decide if they wanna play <br/>
a pvp+ or pvp- games, like in EQ.  Unfortunately D2 do not support this <br/>
concept.  As a matter of fact, even UO now recognise the need and demand of <br/>
pvp- gameplay and that&#39;s why the recent huge patch has divide UO world into <br/>
2, a pvp+ world and a pvp- world.<br/>
<br/>
Since this concept is not implemented in D2, I guess we can still make it <br/>
comes true.  What I&#39;m suggesting now is to form an Singapore D2 <br/>
organization, (guild, clan, whatever you call it).  The objective is <br/>
simple:<br/>
<br/>
1.	For those who don&#39;t wanna play under the fear of been pk&#39;d, or enjoy <br/>
cooperative games, this organization will provide you with trust-worthy <br/>
companions which you can hunt safely under a cooperation mode.<br/>
2.	For those who enjoy pk, to ensure you dun get to pk our own pple, and <br/>
you can find some trust-worthy companions which will fight on ya side <br/>
(instead of group with one unknown player to pk others, and when only 2 of <br/>
you are left in the game, he turn his blade and stuck it into ya back?).<br/>
3.	For those who wanna enjoy both #1 and #2, we provide you will <br/>
trust-worthy companions for cooperative mode, either for mobs hunt or pk <br/>
hunt ;)<br/>
<br/>
As for the guildname, I&#39;m opened to suggestion, subject to one condition, <br/>
the name must be easily identified as a S&#39;pore guild so we won&#39;t end up <br/>
with a situation fighting our own pple ;)<br/>
<br/>
So anyone interested?<br/>
<br/>
P/S: This guild for Blizzard client/server b.net mode only (ie chars saved <br/>
in Blizzard server to avoid cheating) and it&#39;s not a hard-core guild (ie <br/>
not the die once die forever mode, I believe someone already set a <br/>
hard-core guild out there for those interested).</div>
