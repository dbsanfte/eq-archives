<b>Subject:</b> patchwork, studded and reinforced leather armour question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084962463">hi,<br/>
<br/>
been trying to practise my tailoring skillz.. i got a couple of questions<br/>
abt making armour, hope u guys can help.<br/>
<br/>
ruined pelt + pattern = patchwork armour<br/>
medium pelt + studs + pattern = studded armour<br/>
hi-quality pelt + file + pattern = reinforced armour<br/>
<br/>
the above is as far as i understand from the tailoring book. there is only 2<br/>
slots in the sewing kit so.patchwork is no problem but what about studded<br/>
and reinforced where 3 items are required? what is the sequence of making<br/>
them ?<br/>
<br/>
thanks !<br/>
