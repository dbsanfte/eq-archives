<b>Subject:</b> RE: Saving Private Sereph + Guk stuff(all must read the Guk part!!!) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-336342974"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Next, int value of these nukers, so that I can plan what time you guys<br/>
&gt; should nuke (remember guk has a high spawn rate. Nuking on site is too<br/>
&gt; mana ineffective)<br/>
&gt; Ziltus<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sigh, as I&#39;ve said many times, I regret putting 20 stats point on STR when <br/>
I create Ziltus, for f**k?  Knn I&#39;m not creating a labour worker ;(<br/>
Anyway, my buffed INT is 111.<br/>
Kellendil, what are the best INT stuffs u can make now?  I need them badly, <br/>
esp earrings (wtf I&#39;m wearing AGI earring?  I&#39;m not a sand bag, hehe).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Wis base casters don&#39;t need to report. See your face knows how much mana<br/>
&gt; you have already.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hahahahahaahahaha!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Function of this guy? If a big train is started, this guy will be<br/>
&gt; responsible of taunting the WHOLE train, and die, while the rest<br/>
&gt; gate/run out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Monk willl be the best candidate since they can feign death, plus they <br/>
carry very few items.  So cannot retrieve coprse also nmind, hahahahah ;-P<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For the 20+ group, I&#39;ll volunteer for this since I get a incredible 50%<br/>
&gt; exp bonus while in a full group and my area effect DOT songs can taunt<br/>
&gt; like no tomorrow. For the other 2, decide who gets to die among<br/>
&gt; yourself.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Huh?  Not 25% extra xp bonus meh?  50%?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now on supplies. The 2 magician and 3(2 if Neriss go MIA) wis base<br/>
&gt; casters will be required to provide enought supplies to last the whole<br/>
&gt; gang. Nicademous, Kenven and Kellendil can help them out by going into<br/>
&gt; Grobb and I and Sunblade can forage a bit to help out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually if possible, I would like to bring flyingfox (lvl 21 magi), <br/>
deadflower (lvl 19 bard) and Ling (lvl 24 wiz) along. They are my hunting <br/>
buddies for pretty long time and very trust-worthy.  Of coz, priority will <br/>
be given to locals 1st, just in case we have slots to put them in ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Spell casters, please remember to get 100 each of your spell components.<br/>
&gt; 200+ for pet reagents to be KS.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>100???  How long we going to stay there?  I buy 40 of my spell reagents <br/>
each time and can last for a week or so.  Wt and cost is one thing.  I&#39;m so <br/>
damn poor after buying the 5 lvl 24 teleport scrolls and in the end have to <br/>
borrow money from Ling to get the 5th scroll, where got cash to buy so many <br/>
cat eye agate? ;(<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; No alpha loot will be in place. Instead, auto split will be turn on, and<br/>
&gt; 1 person of each group will be delicated to looting everything. Please<br/>
&gt; report whatever you get to all 3 groups. We will decide by vote who<br/>
&gt; requires the item the most and hand it to him/her first.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sugestion: I&#39;m not sure how this single looter works, but sometime pple dun <br/>
bother to loot those rusty weaps and cheap stuffs.  It&#39;s also impractical <br/>
for the single looter to loot everything on sight.  Maybe looters just loot <br/>
those better stuffs and leave the cheapo stuffs like rusty for others to <br/>
free loot (poor wise like me even loot animal skin or bat wing leh). FYI, <br/>
even if auto split is turn on, auto split DO NOT split the coin evenly. <br/>
 The person who loot the coins will be much more than other individuals in <br/>
the group, not sure if this is a bug but 101% confirm.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This event will be a 2 day, 3 night event. We will make our way to guk<br/>
&gt; on Saturday night and fight from Saturday night to National day. When TV<br/>
&gt; showing fire works, those present will atempt to choing the frogloc<br/>
&gt; paladin if we gather enough force, and no one is camping the goon.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope I can join most of the time, Aug is a very heavy work load month for <br/>
me.  Maybe have to work on National Day ;(<br/>
<br/>
Ziltus, power training at Lake Rathetear for the coming Guk expedition.</div>
