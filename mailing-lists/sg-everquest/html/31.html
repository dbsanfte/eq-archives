<div id="ygrps-yiv-47753289">Hey thats great! Still at level 5 here. Don&#39;t powergame too much though, you<br/>
will harm your social life! I used to powergame Meridian 59 for max hps and<br/>
grandmaster in everything. Watched my studies and friends drown. &lt;pardon<br/>
ranting&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For the /loc, I&#39;d warn you its complicated. You will need an instrument to<br/>
measure your whereabouts, just like in UO. &lt;I can&#39;t garuntee this is the<br/>
right answer though, all that is in my head now is whats the diff between<br/>
leathery and waxy leafs&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For fast relieve, /ooc and get a Bard to help you retrieve. He can sing/play<br/>
this kinda song that will locate the body for you ;-)<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; I hit lvl 8 in 4 days of gaming but I&#39;m still lost in the game mecahnics<br/>
&gt; . For example, how do I macro the /loc command to the hotkey bank? How do<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; drag my corpse? How do I make use of the /lco command?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thx for helping! </span></blockquote></div>
