<div id="ygrps-yiv-889501036">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
    I think Najena is the easiest of the 3 Named NPC Spell Casters in<br/>
Najena. She does not have 2000-2500 hp, I think 3 to 4 Inferno Shocks can<br/>
kill her. (240 damage each) Usually 2 or 3 magicians will come along with<br/>
her and their pets too. Just get a full party of level 27+ to avoid those<br/>
irritatting ogre guards without having to invs/camo and it will be safe to<br/>
camp Najena. Beware of Rathyl Incarnate though, he is rather strong and<br/>
almost wiped out my party of level 27s.<br/>
    I dont think its Najena that HTs, more like Drelza (the necro with<br/>
Jboots) that HTs.<br/>
    FBR is almost sure drop on Najena.<br/>

&gt; If you want to fight Najena, you better get 2-3 nukers along. She got some<br/>
&gt; kakis guarding here, Necro or Mage and each of them have a pet.So makes a<br/>
&gt; grand total of abt. 5-7 MOBs in total. Plus, last I heard, she can cast<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; melee also, plus she can HarmTouch ppl. Sometimes she can do up to 4-7 HT<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; a round alone, but rare lar. Average is abt. 2-3. Want to kill her better<br/>
&gt; get some REAL serious firepower to kill her hor, HP wise is around<br/>
&gt; 2000-2500(estimate). Expect to lose a few ppl. in fighting her, her HT<br/>
kicks<br/>
&gt; some serious butt.<br/>
&gt; The Oracle in OOT is around 34-36. Don&#39;t think of soloing him, he got<br/>
&gt; someone protecting him one, abt. 30-31 level guy. Small fries I don&#39;t<br/>
know,<br/>
&gt; but I think a few level 20ish MOB around the oracle also.<br/>
&gt; FBR is a rare drop on Najena(I think) So hunting J.Boots that time also<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; hunt for FBR.<br/>
&gt; Staff of Observer? A rare spawn EvilEye in the King&#39;s room in RunnyEye has<br/>
&gt; it on him occasionally. He can charm, summon pet and get all his Goblins<br/>
&gt; kakis to help him kill you. Level around low 30s. Not sure, but don&#39;t<br/>
think<br/>
&gt; of soloing him.<br/>
&gt; This one is rumor, there is another way of getting StaffofObserver. Go to<br/>
&gt; Paw underwater room. Kill the HighShaman there and wait for the Drow Nixx<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; spawn. If you see the Drow wearing a staff, if may be StaffofObserver.<br/>
Just<br/>
&gt; rumor only hor, try if you have the time. DrowNixx is around 20-24 in<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; and he got some bitching Rune 2 or 3 protecting him. I tried to kill it at<br/>
&gt; 18 with 3 others. All end up Gating out :p<br/>
