<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036954649">1. Slime crystal staff, dropped by a slime element in the bigger slime pool <br/>
in Runnyeye.  Garren know what is the mob lvl?<br/>
<br/>
2. Ice crystal staff, found in Permafrost. Fesse pls provide info so we can <br/>
go see see look look when camping for runed circlet.<br/>
<br/>
3. The deceiver mask (cant remember exact name, turn u to DE).  Dropped by <br/>
lower guk assasin.  Anyone got map to the spot? Also how tough is the <br/>
assasin?<br/>
<br/>
4. Hidden water tunnel in Paw.  It spawns named mobs.  Mob lvl not high but <br/>
was thinking to go there see see look look when too bored in EQ.<br/>
<br/>
5. Polished bone bracer.  Dropped by what mob, where?<br/>
<br/>
6. Fesse pls advise me the reasonable price for the following jewelry:<br/>
- 7int/7str necklace<br/>
- 4int earring (a pair)<br/>
<br/>
7. Is there any INT bracers out there? Stats? Drop by who and where?<br/>
<br/>
Just a feedback, my max dam with less than 30 1HB skill using the staff of <br/>
writhing is 19 (melee) + 48 (chaotic effect), ie 67 dam per hit.  At such a <br/>
low 1HB skill, the chaotic effect appears like once every 5 fights.  I <br/>
still got 30 skill points with me (after dumping 90 skills points and <br/>
200+pp to rise my research skill from zero to 90 odd), wonder if I shld <br/>
throw them all into 1HB (since I seldom melee but the skill does help alot <br/>
when I try to kill mob for fractions).  Is there any skill a wiz shld look <br/>
into at mid-30?<br/>
