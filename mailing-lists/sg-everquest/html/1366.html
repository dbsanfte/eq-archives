<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203831600">Yesterday I got something wrong with my brain and started a new char, an<br/>
Erudin Necromancer named Arkana. Power play him from Saturday evening<br/>
until today morning....yup play until this morning 8am then stop(since I<br/>
today and tomorrow not working). Got him to nearly lv 7 liao.<br/>
I prefer to play him then other chars, so now debating whether to make<br/>
him my main char anot hahaha</div>
