&gt; (Press Release -  Singapore)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We ushered in the new year with parties and great<br/>
&gt; celebrations , many of us were on holiday and may<br/>
&gt; have even leveled up . With the aftermath of the new<br/>
&gt; year , and the assurance that our servers have not crashed<br/>
&gt; and all the user records were not deleted .....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2 servers have celebrated in cool fashion with creation of 2 sisters guilds .<br/>
&gt; After a much heated debated on the guild names...<br/>
&gt; (Actually we just spent 10-15mins<br/>
&gt;  everyone wanted to get back to EQ)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On Erollisi Marr we have ...<br/>
&gt; The &quot;Lions of Erollisi&quot;<br/>
&gt; (*Estimated 30+ members)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On Lanys T&#39;Vyl we have ...<br/>
&gt; The &quot;Lions of Lanys&quot;<br/>
&gt; (*Estimated 15+ members)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *Estimates based on number of known singaporeans<br/>
&gt;  based there .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Both guilds have agreed to work together to provide a solid<br/>
&gt; enviroment for EQ&#39;ers in Singapore . (Duh!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Happy New Year and Let the the Good Times Roll...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; WOOHOO !<br/>
&gt; Those of u still undecided whether or not<br/>
&gt; to start in a new server should give Lanys<br/>
&gt; a try . Its quite a good playing enviroment .<br/>
&gt; There are actually quite a large number of<br/>
&gt; newbies who just got the game for christmas<br/>
&gt; or never got beyond level 20 in their old servers...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Come on .... Guk is still EMPTY...<br/>
&gt; What are u waiting for ? =)<br/>
