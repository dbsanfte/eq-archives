<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847760770">The Guk hunt on last Fri night is not very sucessful.<br/>
<br/>
Initially we plan to get some FBRs but many of us died when travelling in <br/>
Nek.  In the end it became a corpse retrieving session, some of us even <br/>
died few times, ouch.<br/>
<br/>
After everypne get their corpses, we proceed to upper guk.  Loot is quite <br/>
ok, everyone get something I guess, mainly mesh (mostly given to YY, see he <br/>
laughting at the corner? hehe), woven & netted stuffs.<br/>
<br/>
However, come to the later part, we started to trigger trains, and pple <br/>
starts to die again.  Worst is Deadflower, who is binded in FP and died FEW <br/>
times in a row, running from FP to Guk.  He is the most unlucky person for <br/>
that night, coz he died so many times tat he dropped lvl, PLUS his SBS is <br/>
deleted coz when we loot his and AA&#39;s corpse, both got SBS (lore item).<br/>
<br/>
Due to the high number of casulties in Guk, we decided to go elsewhere for <br/>
hunting on Sat.  H/w, I&#39;m unable to join becoz I was busy helping <br/>
Deadflower to get back his lvl in Lake Rathetear and also camp for his SBS <br/>
(YES, got it after the 21th trainer I killed, better than last time, where <br/>
I need to kill 24 for AA&#39;s SBS).  Boy that will be the last time I camp for <br/>
dirk or SBS man, next time I gonna gate u guys to camp yaself liao. I feel <br/>
so pai seh when everybody leave the hill when I camp there (one nuke <br/>
already hurt trainer more than 50%, no horse run, hehe).  Some even renamed <br/>
the trainer hill after my name for that few hours - Ziltus Hill, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
As a last note, I think it&#39;s best to have at least lvl 20 (I mean everybody <br/>
in the group) b4 u start to chong Guk.<br/>
