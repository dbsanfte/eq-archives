<b>Subject:</b> URGENT!!!! Major change to Stein quest coming!!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-254253310">I have just read on EQ Enchanters that the Koalindl fish corpse is <br/>
now a NODROP item on the test servers!<br/>
<br/>
This means that anyone who wants to complete the quest MUST <br/>
take the major faction hits that come with killing the fish! Now that <br/>
it is NODROP, no more mule character to take faction hits then <br/>
transfer to your main character...<br/>
<br/>
A bit of back ground about the fish... when you kill it, Qeynos <br/>
Inhabitants, Barbarians, even RODCET NIFE himself, not just his <br/>
clerics, drop faction with you, and because the corpse doesn&#39;t <br/>
always load, this means that you might have to kill it several times, <br/>
and will quickly become KOS to these factions. (Maybe Rodcet will <br/>
throw down lightning bolt to strike thee down? *heh*)<br/>
<br/>
So, we had better start camping for that fucking fish with our group <br/>
of level 3 mules (fish is level 2 to 3) before they implement the <br/>
change on the actual servers! Don&#39;t care when you want to do the <br/>
quest, just fucking snatch as many fish corpse from under the <br/>
nose of Rodcet first!!!! That is the HARDEST part of the quest!!! We <br/>
better get our asses moving before the next patch comes along!!!! <br/>
KNN!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Unless, of course, you all dowan this 7/43 1H blunt wpn that gives <br/>
+10INT +5DEX... blah blah that is the Stein of Moggok...<br/>
<br/>
I suggest this... we all create throwaway characters in Qeynos, <br/>
level them up to 3 or so, and we group to smack fishes. It should <br/>
be fun too, imagine a horde of level 1 &quot;newbies&quot; swarming Qeynos <br/>
hunting grounds...<br/>
<br/>
This group must be well planned, however, with a proper mix of <br/>
classes to optimise our abilities... and if possible, make all human, <br/>
level up faster...<br/>
<br/>

Love is in the air...<br/>
Get me a gas mask, quick!!!<br/>
