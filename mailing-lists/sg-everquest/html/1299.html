<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328572182">Hehe, may I know how much does a bronze worth?  Banded is commonly sold at <br/>
1pp per AC, how abt bronze?  U mentioned abt silvered plate, is it better <br/>
than bronze?  U too late liao, the only bronze legging I got is sold to a <br/>
friend at 15pp, am I selling too cheap?  It&#39;s from a red gob at flag room, <br/>
one of the worst battle I fought there, with 5 or 6HP left after I killed <br/>
it with the help of another group.  My very first bronze, knn shld have <br/>
keep it as souvenir, hehe.<br/>
If I get more, I will reserve for u lor ;)<br/>
<br/>
The best loot I got from soloing is 2pp (the first and last pp loot I got <br/>
in PF so far) from a normal blue gob, but 95% only got 2-3gp and below.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Permafrost is quite a nice place for xp and loot (only refers to those<br/>
&gt; &gt; tougher gobs beyond the flag room).  I spend 5 hrs there last night<br/>
&gt; &gt; soloing, and half of the time I&#39;m the only soul in the zone.  If we can<br/>
&gt; &gt; find a full house of lvl 18-22 to camp there, I believe all will lvl <br/>
