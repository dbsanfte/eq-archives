- What&#39;s the sucessful rate when you start to train in this skill?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Berry low. Mines only 4 but raises &quot;quite&quot; fast.<br/>
<br/>
- At the begining stage, I believe I will fail many times.  May I know if I<br/>
fail, what&#39;s the implication?<br/>
&gt;&gt;You can&#39;t tell from the screen if you fail or succeed.<br/>
<br/>
- Does failure means heal less or the bandage is totally wasted and heal<br/>
nothing at all?<br/>
&gt;&gt;I believe less but if below skill pt of 20. I think its practically waste<br/>
of bandages.<br/>
<br/>
- So far I didnt anyhow use my practice point.  I think I have around<br/>
35points balance at lvl 8.  To minimise the cost of bandage, is it advisable<br/>
to throw them all into bind wound skill?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Nah but then you might, IF you have no other trade skills or hard to train<br/>
magic spells.<br/>
<br/>
- Can this bind wound skill heal other than self?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Yes! Good for saving lives! I saved mine and others saved mine.<br/>
<br/>
- What is the healing effect of this skill, does it have a delay time?<br/>
&gt;&gt;It heals up to 20hps. Delay time is quite short so you don&#39;t have to<br/>
worry. When you heal, it does the &quot;looting&quot; action.<br/>
<br/>
- How can one rise the skill fast?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Get a magician or some kind of mage class to conjure them for you. Do play<br/>
them though &lt;grins&gt; About the market price, I&#39;ve no idea cos I got mine<br/>
free.<br/>
<br/>
- Can wiz use this skill while fighting?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Once the healing target moves, you are interrupted so the answer is no.<br/>
<br/>
- What is the lvl ceiling of this skill for wiz?  3+3/lvl (like our melee<br/>
skill) or 5+5/lvl (like our magery skill)?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Pardon me but for this, I&#39;ve no idea.<br/>
