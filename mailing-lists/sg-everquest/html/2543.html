&gt; &gt; Time: 20 00 CST, 9th of October Saturday<br/>
&gt; &gt; Server: Innoruuk<br/>
&gt; &gt; Event: Guild meeting + farewell party for Trifrost<br/>
&gt; &gt; Meeting place: South Karana Plains, at the centaur village<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Note that ALL on Inno should attend. We would have a meeting to discuss<br/>
&gt; &gt; some of the crap we have never get to agree on (guild requirements, SOS<br/>
&gt; &gt; calls, member position blah blah blah).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Please don&#39;t give me the pathetic excuse of &quot;I want to level so I cannot<br/>
&gt; &gt; attend&quot; I take that as a clear sign of munchkinism, and I don&#39;t tolerate<br/>
&gt; &gt; that.<br/>
