<div id="ygrps-yiv-26542528">Hail! And welcome to the 2nd edition of<br/>
<br/>
---===Exploit of The Week===---<br/>
<br/>
This weeks exploit is brought to you by: Angry Shamans Across Norrath<br/>
(ASAN). Quit fucking nerfing our characters.<br/>
<br/>
Last week Angry Shamans brought you a way to trade no-drop items. We<br/>
hope some people were able to benefit from this. This week Shamans had<br/>
their Pets Nerfed. Our dogs were already ten levels below us (at<br/>
best), and were never in any way better than a warrior or monk of equal<br/>
level. Verant didn&#39;t bother to mention our pets in any update, just<br/>
Magician&#39;s and Necro&#39;s pets.<br/>
<br/>
This week&#39;s exploit is mostly for people on PvP servers, but can also<br/>
be handy for you carebears in a duel.<br/>
<br/>
Recently Verant made a patch which made it impossible for someone to<br/>
loot from Melee or Range slots when they are killed by a PC. I have<br/>
discovered a way around this.<br/>
<br/>
Alright, before you go on your killing spree tonight, fill up all your<br/>
general inventory slots, including backpacks. Something cheap will do<br/>
just fine (bait, milk, muffins) just make sure all inventory slots are<br/>
full. Now find a poor helpless warrior with a big, shiny weapon or<br/>
shield. Kill him. When looting his corpse RIGHT CLICK on his weapon.<br/>
You should get a message saying &quot;You have no more room and item falls<br/>
to the ground&quot;. Look down and his weapon will be sitting there, ready<br/>
for you to pick up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Heheh! And you melee classes thought pets were unfair ;)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!</div>
