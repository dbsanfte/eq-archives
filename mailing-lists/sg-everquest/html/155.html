<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; more.<br/>
&gt; I suggest you put the more &quot;common&quot; once under the &quot;1&quot; box, example Melee<br/>
&gt; Attack. Those like Run,Camp, put under &quot;2&quot; box.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Anyone train in sense direction?  Just a tip to share. I set hotkey 4, 5, 6 <br/>
to sense direction and link it to my keypad for movement (ie front, left, <br/>
right).  Like that everytime I move, I use the skill.  Now the skill reach <br/>
my lvl ceiling.  When I rise lvl, it&#39;s easier and faster for me to increase <br/>
it further till the new lvl ceiling.<br/>
<br/>
For those spell casters, the magery skill ceiling is 5+5/lvl.  If u are lvl <br/>
7, ya ceiling for all magery skills is 5+(7x5)=40.  Once u rise a lvl, stay <br/>
in town and keep casting & mediating until you reach lvl ceiling b4 u <br/>
venture out.  (Unlike UO casting in EQ doesnt require reagents, so keep <br/>
casting and mediating) This will help u, coz at higher lvl, magery skills <br/>
rise faster.  It&#39;s very time consuming to max all magery kills to lvl <br/>
ceiling everytime u gain a lvl, but at least do it for mediation, <br/>
chanelling and ya main magery skills.  For eg, I&#39;m a wiz, so I always max <br/>
out my evoke (offense) and adjure (defence) skills, not forgetting <br/>
mediation and chanelling.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, dun forget abt ya melee skills.  Thou ya melee sux, but u will sux <br/>
further if u dun train at all.  Ask the tankers in ya group to start the <br/>
attack, when monsters fight them, u move close and hit with ya melee weap <br/>
and at the same time keep casting ;)<br/>
