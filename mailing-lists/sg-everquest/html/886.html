&gt; Play, PLay, PLAy, PLAY AND PLAY until the motion sickness cured by itself,<br/>
&gt; hahahahah.  Just like the disease in EQ, it will cure by itself.  EQ<br/>
&gt; spining is still not as bad as those REAL 1st person 3D arcade game.  Go<br/>
&gt; try Tribes and u will know wat I mean, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I personally max out all my 6 out of my 7 magery skills in town everytime<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; gain a lvl - ie mediating, chanelling, evoke, divine, alter and adjure.<br/>
&gt;  The only one left out is conjure coz wiz dun get scolls of this skill<br/>
&gt; until later stage.  I also try to max out my melee skills whenever<br/>
&gt; possible, but when I reach lvl 13, melee skill is no longer useful.  If I<br/>
&gt; try to fight and cast, I will get disturbed pretty often and hp also<br/>
&gt; reduced fast.  I used root & nuke whenever possible.  H/w, I met a lvl 18<br/>
&gt; wiz last week, he ofter his help in using melee when I hunt derv<br/>
cutthroat,<br/>
&gt; saying that he still get very lttile xp in killing those derv but his main<br/>
&gt; concern is to rise his melee skill.  Seem that ya melee skill will rise<br/>
&gt; even if u fight with something green to u, as long as u still gain xp from<br/>
&gt; killing it (but u dun have to kill it to gain skill).  Maybe at later<br/>
stage<br/>
&gt; when it&#39;s impractical to use ya melee for hunting, u can go ard helping<br/>
&gt; lower lvl players to hunt and at the same time train ya melee?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for trading skill, I recommend brewing.  It only take an initial<br/>
&gt; investment of 5-8pp and can max out in 2 hrs or so.  Even at my lvl I<br/>
still<br/>
&gt; find the profit quite attractive.  I can only earn around 10pp a night<br/>
&gt; hunting at my lvl (4 hrs average) but brewing give me that profit (or<br/>
more)<br/>
&gt; in a hr time with max skill.  Maybe u may wanna max out this skill when u<br/>
&gt; earn enough pp at lvl 4 instead of buying scroll 1st.  Afterall, once u<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; the max brewing skill, u can easily earn back the money required to buy<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; ya scrolls ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wait, Nicademous?  I think I saw that name somewhere b4, or something<br/>
&gt; similar?  Where r u located now?<br/>
