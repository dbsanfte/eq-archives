<b>Subject:</b> some caster info, for those still playing... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-105037694">I got the following off the EQ Casters website... interesting thing <br/>
about DEX, INT and WIS with regards to fizzles and interrupts...<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
I spoke with GZ and got some intersting information:<br/>
<br/>
There is currently no plans for a 49 Wizard Fire Based DD Spell.<br/>
There is no new information on if or when 44 and 49 Magican <br/>
Summon Item spells will be implemented.<br/>
<br/>
Some clarification on some statistic issues though:<br/>
<br/>
The chance of specialisation kicking in for Wisdom based casters <br/>
is effected by Wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
The chance of specialisation kicking in for Intelligence based <br/>
casters is effected by intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Dexterity does not effect chances of recovering and successfully <br/>
casting.  It does effect however how often a special procs if you <br/>
have one on your weapon.<br/>
<br/>
The only skill which effects recovery for casting when interrupted is <br/>
Channelling.  No other skill or statistic effects this.<br/>
<br/>
If specialisation successfully rolls it will effect your chance of <br/>
fizzling and the amount of mana used.<br/>
<br/>
Higher Intelligence will reduce fizzles for Intelligence based casters.<br/>
<br/>
Higher Wisdom will reduce fizzles for Wisdom Based casters.<br/>
<br/>
Good alternatives for pure mages then are Agility to avoid being hit <br/>
in the first place or Stamina for extra hitpoints.<br/>
<br/>
