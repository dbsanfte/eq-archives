<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-712733594">Wah kow, wiz&#39;s only ability is to nuke, nuke and nuke, not only we nuke <br/>
with the heaviest dam as compared to other classes, but we can also nuke at <br/>
the fastest rate.  I think lvl 20 maybe another transitional period for us. <br/>
Force shock is the 1st massive dd spells we got, so I presume this range of <br/>
spells will improve further.  H/w, I still find it hard to believe magi got <br/>
TWO (not just 1) lvl 20 spells tat hit so close to our lvl 20&#39;s, plus the <br/>
fact that they can be casted faster and less resisted. Then with their pets <br/>
they can rule at the lvl 20-24 period liao.  H/w, I still have faith in wiz <br/>
when it come to higher lvls.<br/>
<br/>
Also, another reason I have chosen wiz is bcoz of our travelling spells. <br/>
 In UO I got runes to all city banks, all dungeon entrances and all major <br/>
hunting ground.  I hate to rely on others in order to reach certain places. <br/>
 Thou druid get solo gating spells faster than us, but we are the only ones <br/>
who can teleport to the alternate planes and new places when the game <br/>
expands further.<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, I guess ultimately wiz will still be one of the most <br/>
powerful classes in EQ.  Die die also must endure now, hehe.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I ever mentioned abt an articles I read on UOVault or UOSS abt soloing,<br/>
&gt; &gt;which the author ranking the race/class combo best for soloing in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;following order:<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Troll anything<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Wiz<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Shaman<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Dwarven Cleric<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Monk<br/>
&gt; &gt;He also mentioned monk, been the lowest in soloing order, will <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;become the easiest to solo above lvl 30.  Dunno if this is still true, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;I just hope wiz remains to be a possible choice for soloing at high lvl.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Last night there is a big stealing party at HH.  90% of the participants<br/>
&gt; &gt;are pure casters, and melee chars all have to stand aside, hehe.  Even<br/>
&gt; &gt;combining Ling (lvl 18 wiz), Fox (lvl 17 magi) and I, we only have a 50%<br/>
&gt; &gt;successful rate in getting a kill (well we are competing with lvl 20s<br/>
&gt; &gt;there).  Frankly speaking if thing con&#39;t to stay on like tat, I would<br/>
&gt; &gt;rather hunt at oasis orc camp, thou the loot is much more lousy and<br/>
&gt; &gt;inconvenient due to the wulu wulu location.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Come to think of it, I dun think TF is taking too long lvling his <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;coz he has MIA for quite a while.  If he find it too long, then he shld<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;house shifting - dun forget Les is also training his necro while I only<br/>
&gt; &gt;focusing on 1 char.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;No doubt a magi can solo well, coz he&#39;s like a provisional shop keeper <br/>
 </span></blockquote>with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;most of the stuffs avilable at his summoning.  H/w, I think we have to<br/>
&gt; &gt;consider 2 sides of soloing - roleplaying aspect and realplaying aspect.<br/>
&gt; &gt;As a magi, u can have all the supplies at a wave of ya hand, but when it<br/>
&gt; &gt;come to hunting and lvling, you still need somone to tank, someone to <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;for u.  A soloing magi will get no where at high lvl, coz wiz will steal<br/>
&gt; &gt;from u, tankers can last longer than u, and worse, half of ya XP goes to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>ya<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;pet!  So I will consider magi a very good choice for roleplaying but not<br/>
&gt; &gt;REALplaying.  I guess necro is a better choice for REALplaying, since <br/>

&gt; &gt;their pets.  But imagine like a place like HH pass, ya guarding pet only<br/>
&gt; &gt;provide a tank for those nukers - which they use ya pet to tank them <br/>

&gt; &gt;EQ is a group game, personally I dun think any of the char I mentioned<br/>
&gt; &gt;above is a good soloing choice.  At most they can only be a good <br/>
