<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125831329">Najera is usually spawn with 2-3 magicians or a higher lvl magician will take<br/>
her place when she goes shopping.<br/>
<br/>
She can harm touch meh? Never see her do it before. I just dizzying draught and<br/>
feedback her, melee a bit with my staff and sent her to heavens with 3 anarcy<br/>
shots(288 dmg each + interrupt spell casting) while her little friends standing<br/>
there sleeping. Think she might have been change since the last time I fough her<br/>
(2-3 months back)<br/>
<br/>
Oracle is definately high 30s, not mid 30s, cons dangerous blue to lvl<br/>
39(meaning should be lvl 35-38). He only has 1 kaki who yells a lot. Place<br/>
freaking empty most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Staff of observers for hell sake is NOT a DROPPED item(and on the same note,<br/>
Skull of J&#39;tendra does not combine with a RTS to produce a Staff of Writhing),<br/>
it is a QUEST REWARD. You need Borxx optic lense/retina for the quest.  Tired of<br/>
listening to rumors on staffs.<br/>
<br/>
The goon at paw drops RTS.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Borxx level has been raise during one of the last patch and spawns<br/>
mainly in mid 30s these days and is a MISS.<br/>

&gt; If you want to fight Najena, you better get 2-3 nukers along. She got some<br/>
&gt; kakis guarding here, Necro or Mage and each of them have a pet.So makes a<br/>
&gt; grand total of abt. 5-7 MOBs in total. Plus, last I heard, she can cast and<br/>
&gt; melee also, plus she can HarmTouch ppl. Sometimes she can do up to 4-7 HT in<br/>
&gt; a round alone, but rare lar. Average is abt. 2-3. Want to kill her better<br/>
&gt; get some REAL serious firepower to kill her hor, HP wise is around<br/>
&gt; 2000-2500(estimate). Expect to lose a few ppl. in fighting her, her HT kicks<br/>
&gt; some serious butt.<br/>
&gt; The Oracle in OOT is around 34-36. Don&#39;t think of soloing him, he got<br/>
&gt; someone protecting him one, abt. 30-31 level guy. Small fries I don&#39;t know,<br/>
&gt; but I think a few level 20ish MOB around the oracle also.<br/>
&gt; FBR is a rare drop on Najena(I think) So hunting J.Boots that time also can<br/>
&gt; hunt for FBR.<br/>
&gt; Staff of Observer? A rare spawn EvilEye in the King&#39;s room in RunnyEye has<br/>
&gt; it on him occasionally. He can charm, summon pet and get all his Goblins<br/>
&gt; kakis to help him kill you. Level around low 30s. Not sure, but don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; of soloing him.<br/>
&gt; This one is rumor, there is another way of getting StaffofObserver. Go to<br/>
&gt; Paw underwater room. Kill the HighShaman there and wait for the Drow Nixx to<br/>
&gt; spawn. If you see the Drow wearing a staff, if may be StaffofObserver. Just<br/>
&gt; rumor only hor, try if you have the time. DrowNixx is around 20-24 in level<br/>
&gt; and he got some bitching Rune 2 or 3 protecting him. I tried to kill it at<br/>
&gt; 18 with 3 others. All end up Gating out :p<br/>
