But come to think of it, I guess we can avoid such &#39;swayness&#39; most of the <br/>
time.  ;)<br/>

 If u lvl 1 and ask Garren to camp SOO for u, he where got so free, hehe.<br/>

reinstall and re-download all patches, took us almost an hr ;(  That&#39;s the <br/>
2nd gate spell I cast, I thought my gate so powerful that it crashed NK, <br/>
hehe.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then what is the objective for the hunt?  If we organised a camping event, <br/>
then camp lor.  Otherwise make it an adventuring event.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; aka monks, bards, rogues and warriors during a camp to look for spawn.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually not necessary always, coz we can invis ourselves and med.  If we <br/>
got for those fixed number mob, fixed spawning rate hunting spot, it&#39;s <br/>
always more than enuff time to get fully med and rest b4 the next spawn. <br/>
 This sentence dun apply to those dungeons or random spawn region.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt; Agree, but, the problem with us right now is that we are freaking<br/>
&gt; disorganise. Most of the times, we have rojak groups, with huge level<br/>
&gt; difference, due to lack of participation of other kakis.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tat&#39;s why I mentioned, categorise the hunting lvl.  If it&#39;s a lvl 30 mob, <br/>
just open it for the lvl 30 & above kakis.  If it&#39;s a lvl 10 hunt, open to <br/>
those lvl 10 and above (high lvl can join if they choose to help) and <br/>
invite 1 or 2 high lvl to help.<br/>
As for participation, I think our kakis are the active bunch in QHD. So far <br/>
we can get at least 1 full group for the events. ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt; Prepare your group gate at all times loh, tanks gonna die, GG first, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>think<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; later.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My gate spell cost 300 mana.  Wiz can be act as the last resort for <br/>
fleeing, just make sure<br/>
- No mob disturb me during the 10-15 second casting (yes, gate spell got <br/>
the longest casting time).<br/>
- I have enuff mana (in fact I advise all casters to at least reserve 1 <br/>
bubb mana for self gating out, and 2 bubb if u can cast party gate spell).<br/>
If wiz cannot gate out, it will be a &quot;I DIE U ALL DIE&quot; situation, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Another concern I have is the limited spell slots.<br/>
My 8 spell icons are:<br/>
- 1st nuke (120 dam, for finishing running mob)<br/>
- 2nd nuke (180 dam, for doing last kill if mob not running yet left ard 1 <br/>
bubb HP and save mana)<br/>
- 3rd nuke (260 dam, for normal hunting)<br/>
- Major shield (rise HP and AC)<br/>
- Shield<br/>
- Root<br/>
- Gate (last resort for myself)<br/>
<br/>
As u can see, all the above r essential for my survival and hunting.  If I <br/>
replace last slot with party gate, I can not longer gate myself out when <br/>
the party gate fail or low mana.  ;(<br/>
<br/>
So unless it&#39;s like the ROO tactics I mentioned, where wiz main task is tp <br/>
party gate once we kill and loot oracle, portal spell never shown on my <br/>
normal spell icon slots.<br/>
