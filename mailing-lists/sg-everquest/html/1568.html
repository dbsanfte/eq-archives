<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148792904">No doubt my current Wiz is of low INT amg all other casters, but he seem to <br/>
solo pretty well.  Normally I use root and nuke (with my most powerful <br/>
spell) tactics.  But when the mob resist my root for the 2nd time, I will <br/>
switch to melee and nuke (with my 2nd most powerful spell, 40% less dam, <br/>
40% less mana but cast much faster).  And surprisingly, I still managed to <br/>
survive in Lake Rathetear using these 2 method till now. ;)<br/>
<br/>
For those who are pondering between lvl 20 to 24 who cant still solo a <br/>
aviak guard now, I offer FOC Power-Leveling-Training sessions in Lake ;) <br/>
 I&#39;ve helped Deadflower and Flyingfox to lvl few times using this method, <br/>
and will be willing to help all others local kakis if u need my training <br/>
sessions.  Basically we will go to the 2-birds isle and try to spread the <br/>
spawning of the aviak guards one after another instead of both at the same <br/>
time.  The trainee will solo the bird, and I will monitor both HP.  Once <br/>
mob HP drop to below 50%, I will start nuking it to death. In this way, the <br/>
trainee can solo safely.  At lvl 26, some of the green chicks still give me <br/>
xp, and best of all, no faction hit.  Come to think of it, Lake loot in <br/>
term of money is not bad.  With one night hunting, I normally get ard <br/>
20pp-30pp (but also spend alot buying my leather skin reagent, 5gp plus per <br/>
cast, one night can spend 10-20pp), that&#39;s after I sell all the rusty and <br/>
bronze weaps.<br/>
<br/>
The only condition is that if there is any aviak guard con blue to me, I <br/>
will get it.  Reason is becoz 50% of the green chick no more giving me xp, <br/>
whereas they still con blue to the trainee.  Of coz sometime when blue bird <br/>
spawn 3 in a row and I&#39;m oom after the 2nd bird, trainee can get it. <br/>
 Trainee also get to hunt all those bird con green to me, which more than <br/>
50% of the time con blue to them (if u r below lvl 22, no bird will be con <br/>
green to u, hehe).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how long further can the Lake give my xp, esp when I reach lvl <br/>
27.  If birds still give me xp at lvl 27, I will stay there and offer <br/>
training sessions, if not I will go elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, during the training session, we dun hunt in group.  Instead we hunt <br/>
solo so tat trainee can get ALL the xp.  Based on my past experience, <br/>
killing 2 birds in a group of 2 will give less xp killing 1 bird by solo. <br/>
 I still believe in this principle.  For those magi/necro out there, we <br/>
have confirm with GM that pet is treated as one of ya team member even if u <br/>
are soloing.  Basically pet will eat the summoner&#39;s xp regardless if it <br/>
kill the mob or not.  They say mob only eat xp from other group members if <br/>
it kill the mob, this I&#39;m not sure but it definitely will eat the summoner <br/>
xp.  When I train FF, I will ask him to dismiss pet so tat he can get all <br/>
the xp.  EQ is quite balance - with pet u can hunt tougher mob with better <br/>
loot, but u will get less xp ;)<br/>
