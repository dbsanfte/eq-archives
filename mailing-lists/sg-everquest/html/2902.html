<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-687307406">When I play EQ for around 1 hr, my system HDD will start to load something, <br/>
and I dunno what&#39;s tat.  It always happened and when the loading starts, my <br/>
EQ screen will freeze bit by bit, and worse is that when such thing <br/>
happened, it will last for 1 min or so.  This problem has caused me died <br/>
few times for nothing (eg last night when kiting doggie outside Karnor <br/>
castle, with snare, the loading cause my char to stop several times when <br/>
running, in the end kena whacked to death by doggie, sigh).<br/>
<br/>
Is it something to do with any 3rd party s/w like SB Live problem or norton <br/>
anti-virus (I used to have NAV in my previous machine but dun have such <br/>
prob b4).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m running at AMD K7-700, 128MB ram, 3D Prophet DDR DVI with 32MB, 40GB <br/>
HDD, SB Live Player.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice?  Thx.<br/>
<br/>
p/s: Hmm, cleric rez above lvl 50 do not return 100% xp?</div>
