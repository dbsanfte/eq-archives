Ever though of setting a gang for S&#39;pore kakis?  I think with quite a few <br/>
of us in Innoruuk, it&#39;s time for us to setup a local gang.  This is not a <br/>
guild like UO, just an informal group for local players only.  Of coz we <br/>
still need a guild master to talk to game GM to setup a &#39;guild&#39; - I <br/>
recommend the oldest (or highest lvl) EQ players in S&#39;pore to hold the <br/>
position of &#39;guildmaster&#39;.  Again I must stress, this is just an informal <br/>
gang - no guild activities or structure, but just a recognition for local <br/>
players, and make it easy for other new local players to identify us.  Thus <br/>
we must think of a &#39;localized&#39; name, eg Clan Singapura, one look we know <br/>
it&#39;s a S&#39;pore gang liao.  Feasible?<br/>
