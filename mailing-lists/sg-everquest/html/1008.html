<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119875962">Guys,<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s very sad that wiz get to steal kills like that. I&#39;m a magi and<br/>
i&#39;ve yet to encounter it...<br/>
but i&#39;m not jealous or anything..but i think this really spoils a game when<br/>
ppl steal kills.<br/>
I never steal kill even when i&#39;m a sole caster around and can nuke. I mean<br/>
if everyone<br/>
could just be nicer...this game would be so much better. Then again..the<br/>
WORLD would be much<br/>
better...hehe...guess real life gets into everything *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
I just feel kinda demoralised at hearing such stuff about the game.<br/>
I&#39;m not very sure on this but can you guys clarify?<br/>
When you and others attack a mob..the one that gets last kill has what<br/>
rewards? Loot?<br/>
I thought that as long as you contribute significant (50%?) of dmg to<br/>
mob..you get exp too?<br/>
Maybe someone can explain this to me =)<br/>
<br/>
I got alot to find out man...played a few days till now..still blur on<br/>
several things.<br/>
<br/>
p.s. What is IMHO???? &quot;I Make Huge Oreos&quot;?? &quot;I aM a Horny Ogre&quot;??<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s very sad to see Trifrost changing sex, ops, I mean changing class,<br/>
&gt; hehe.  I&#39;ll missed all the good old days of having free SOWing ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From my personal experience, my hardest days as a wiz is between lvl 6-11.<br/>
&gt;  This is the time where our dd spell sux, our melee sux, we cant steal, we<br/>
&gt; cant block, we cant melee and has to live like a parasite begging everyone<br/>
&gt; to let us tag along, haha (loss count of how many times I spaming the zone<br/>
&gt; shouting for group and no one ever reply).  After lvl 12, we start to pick<br/>
&gt; up some face with the more &#39;presentable&#39; shock spell, and our market value<br/>
&gt; incease with lvl 16 lighing shock spell.  I heard at lvl 20, we will start<br/>
&gt; to get our very 1st mana efficient &#39;mass dd&#39; spell - force shiok, ops I<br/>
&gt; mean shock, hehe.  Maybe Leshrec can elaborate more on this. ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been teaming with a magi and a bard since lvl 8 - Flyingfox and<br/>
&gt; Deadflower.  DF&#39;s song has save our butts many times but he is now having<br/>
&gt; his hardest day finding a magical weap to attack mobs tat can only be<br/>
&gt; hurted by magic means.  His melee is also lossing out when comparing with<br/>
&gt; paladin/shadowknight/warriors.  For the past 2 night DF has died at least<br/>
2<br/>
&gt; times trying to tank in the group. Fox also start to face a hard time<br/>
&gt; losing kills to those wiz of similar lvl.   According to Sereph, magi will<br/>
&gt; have a hard time getting their summoning spells from lvl 16 onwards, necro<br/>
&gt; from lvl 20+ and wiz from lvl 30+ onwards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the other hand I feel I&#39;m playing at the peak of my wiz life so far,<br/>
coz<br/>
&gt; with the shieldskin, invis and root, I have no problem travelling and<br/>
&gt; fighting a mob white or sometime yellow to me.  Of coz, I still need a<br/>
&gt; group for long term survival, but I start to feel the joy of playing as a<br/>
&gt; wiz.  I remember the days I whine alot of been a weakling wiz during<br/>
newbie<br/>
&gt; time coz I&#39;ve so much problem in both soloing and grouping - very often<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; the first one who died in a group ;)  Now I feel I have to ability to solo<br/>
&gt; at times when I cant find a good team to join.  (Hopefully I dun have to<br/>
&gt; whine again at higher lvl, hehe).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I ever mentioned abt an articles I read on UOVault or UOSS abt soloing,<br/>
&gt; which the author ranking the race/class combo best for soloing in the<br/>
&gt; following order:<br/>
&gt; - Troll anything<br/>
&gt; - Wiz<br/>
&gt; - Shaman<br/>
&gt; - Dwarven Cleric<br/>
&gt; - Monk<br/>
&gt; He also mentioned monk, been the lowest in soloing order, will ultimately<br/>
&gt; become the easiest to solo above lvl 30.  Dunno if this is still true, but<br/>
&gt; I just hope wiz remains to be a possible choice for soloing at high lvl.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night there is a big stealing party at HH.  90% of the participants<br/>
&gt; are pure casters, and melee chars all have to stand aside, hehe.  Even<br/>
&gt; combining Ling (lvl 18 wiz), Fox (lvl 17 magi) and I, we only have a 50%<br/>
&gt; successful rate in getting a kill (well we are competing with lvl 20s<br/>
&gt; there).  Frankly speaking if thing con&#39;t to stay on like tat, I would<br/>
&gt; rather hunt at oasis orc camp, thou the loot is much more lousy and<br/>
&gt; inconvenient due to the wulu wulu location.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Come to think of it, I dun think TF is taking too long lvling his shaman,<br/>
&gt; coz he has MIA for quite a while.  If he find it too long, then he shld<br/>
&gt; compare me and Les - which I&#39;m at one time 6 to 7 lvl lag behind him coz<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; house shifting - dun forget Les is also training his necro while I only<br/>
&gt; focusing on 1 char.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No doubt a magi can solo well, coz he&#39;s like a provisional shop keeper<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; most of the stuffs avilable at his summoning.  H/w, I think we have to<br/>
&gt; consider 2 sides of soloing - roleplaying aspect and realplaying aspect.<br/>
&gt; As a magi, u can have all the supplies at a wave of ya hand, but when it<br/>
&gt; come to hunting and lvling, you still need somone to tank, someone to nuke<br/>
&gt; for u.  A soloing magi will get no where at high lvl, coz wiz will steal<br/>
&gt; from u, tankers can last longer than u, and worse, half of ya XP goes to<br/>
ya<br/>
&gt; pet!  So I will consider magi a very good choice for roleplaying but not<br/>
&gt; REALplaying.  I guess necro is a better choice for REALplaying, since they<br/>
&gt; can dot and drain hp (ie heal).  Magi is next to enchanter when coming to<br/>
&gt; &#39;group&#39; caster.  I&#39;ve nothing against it, but hope TF can consider the l/t<br/>
&gt; implication instead of just current situation.  Yes, the 1st lvl 8 I met<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; Prexus is a magi and a necro, who guard the Kobold camp whole day with<br/>
&gt; their pets.  But imagine like a place like HH pass, ya guarding pet only<br/>
&gt; provide a tank for those nukers - which they use ya pet to tank them while<br/>
&gt; they laughing behind, nuking and stealing ya kill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; EQ is a group game, personally I dun think any of the char I mentioned<br/>
&gt; above is a good soloing choice.  At most they can only be a good PART-TIME<br/>
&gt; soloer, where u can still do a bit soloing when you dun feel like teaming<br/>
&gt; with others sometime (err who knows?  some gals are in bad mood certain<br/>
&gt; time of the month, hehe).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At least we have a big pool of local kakis which we can rely and dependent<br/>
&gt; on, trusty worthy as well.  I used to vioce out the loot order when I join<br/>
&gt; other groups as a newbie, but now I prefer free loot coz I knew I can<br/>
trust<br/>
&gt; our own kakis to bahave themselves.  With all of us under the same guild,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; dun think we will encounter much problem getting a descent group using the<br/>
&gt; guildsay.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for the backward trick, it&#39;s not working for casters.  Once we lose a<br/>
&gt; lvl, we lose the mana, which reduce our casting ability.  Losing a lvl at<br/>
&gt; those critical lvl where we gain new spells will disable us to cast the<br/>
new<br/>
&gt; spells, even if I&#39;ve memo it (already try it, not on purpose but I always<br/>
&gt; seem to die the moment I gain the lvl to cast new spells, hehe).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agreed with YY abt sometime we tends to slow down abit when grouping.<br/>
&gt;  When I gain my last bubb of xp at lvl 18, I only need an hr, where I took<br/>
&gt; whole Sunday grouping with others to gain 4 bubb, and mind u, I&#39;m playing<br/>
&gt; the &#39;legal&#39; nuking for my last bubb of xp. The worse time-vs-xp rate is<br/>
&gt; when I team with DF (ok, just for elaborate purpose), I&#39;m basically nuking<br/>
&gt; 95% of the time while he stand nearby singing song.  I won&#39;t blame him coz<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s really very diifficult for him to assist in kill the mobs.  1st most<br/>
&gt; of the mobs are red to him, 2nd he dun have a good weap.  H/w, I still<br/>
&gt; enjoy sharing xp with him coz I enjoy his company.  Of coz I can simply<br/>
act<br/>
&gt; blur and solo, coz it dun really make much different for me, but DF has do<br/>
&gt; me a big favor during my newbie time and I really dun mind sharing my xp<br/>
&gt; with him.  I think this is the other element which we will come across<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; playing EQ - friendship.<br/>
&gt; DF ever to come all the way from Felwithe to escort me to get my corpse<br/>
&gt; from mino cave and lead me back to Felwithe during my 1st trip to<br/>
&gt; Steamfont.  He was killed at lesser Faydark when we meet with a train of<br/>
&gt; orcs half way thru the journey.  If u guys hunt with him often, u will<br/>
&gt; notice DF always LD at night, and given the fact that he almost logout<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; night and change him mind after getting my seek help msg, I will never<br/>
&gt; forget his kindness.  That&#39;s why until now I will try my very best to help<br/>
&gt; him, and hopefully contribute back to those who ever help me (Leshrec,<br/>
&gt; Garren, YY etc).  OPs, side track more than YY liao, pai seh, hahaha.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; YY, let organise a Paw/Permfrost trip tonight if HH is flooded with<br/>
&gt; stealers again? I&#39;m the first one who is more than willing to follow.<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been begging around for pple to bring me to Paw, heard too much of the<br/>
&gt; goodies there, yet fairly safe for group hunting.  I propose we form 2<br/>
&gt; groups there -the higher lvls protect and help the lower lvls to get some<br/>
&gt; descent equipments.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Someone train a damn SOWer pls, hahahahahahah ;-?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Today TriFrost just started a magician Char. He finds its takes too long<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Solo-Lvl at 16th for a Shaman. I dont blame him,casters will find it<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; &gt; diff to Solo when they get higer lvl. I have read that  monks too will<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; some diff. when monks reach 25th. it going to be tougher. Con&#39; msg<br/>
&gt; changes<br/>
&gt; &gt; again to 2 types of Green, 3-4 types of Blue msg.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; EQ being a Group game will &quot;force&quot; player to be group and team. An &quot;old&quot;<br/>
&gt; EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt; monk friend name  &quot;Chien&quot; whom started off the same time as me is now a<br/>
&gt; Lvl<br/>
&gt; &gt; 36th monk. He been trying to avoid being &quot;guilded&quot; into a Guild. But now<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; with the &quot;Apo Knights&quot; becos his regualr Kakis r in that Guild and I<br/>
&gt; noticed<br/>
&gt; &gt; a slowed down on his lvling , my guess is that so he could &quot;group&quot; with<br/>
&gt; his<br/>
&gt; &gt; buddies , partly also is get tougher to lvl as u go higer.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; the following parargrah is not about xp lvling is bout soloing and<br/>
&gt; enjoying<br/>
&gt; &gt; killin the nasties that u like to kill over and over again. 8-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; I had tried a &quot;back-ward&quot; lvling trick(original idea) to hit nasties<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; cons Green to me at 19th lvl but r Blue at 18th. I max out melee skills<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; 19th on the first bubble. Commited sucide and be killed 3-4 times and go<br/>
&gt; &gt; back to 18th. I killed the &quot;Blue&quot; nasties easy since my melee is max at<br/>
&gt; 19th<br/>
&gt; &gt; lvl. The purpose is obviously not for xp or lvls. It for easy money and<br/>
&gt; &gt; kills. Now i&#39;ve tried this on lvl 20th it didnt work too well since i<br/>
got<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; new skill, &quot;Eagle strike&quot; on this lvl. When i backward lvl. I &quot;Lost&quot;<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; new Skill, since  &quot;Eagle Strike&quot; is not avaible for lvl 19.Ok i have<br/>
side<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tracked. sorri.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions to overcome some of the Soloing problem?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Perhaps more informal expeditions and Gatherings need to be organise,<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; &gt; only for weekends but any other days. Need not be to new far away<br/>
places.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Some where need by with decent loot and decent xp. Whats imporatant  is<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; enjoyment.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ANy one for Paw or Permfrost?<br/>
