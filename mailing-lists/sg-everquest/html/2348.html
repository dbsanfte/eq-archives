<div id="ygrps-yiv-496873265">AC 8, 4 INT, 4 WIS, found in Permafrost peacher (lvl 25 mob).<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if we send a grp of lvl 30s to that room to camp for it, will we <br/>
kena mass killing like last time?<br/>
<br/>
I know a lvl 35 halfling tank camp there often at our time, and he sell <br/>
each in SK  for 300-400pp.  Of coz I dun mean to hunt it for money, but I <br/>
guess this artifact will be good for all casters & hybrids.<br/>
<br/>
If you guys are bored with hunting birdmans, chopping trees, you can join <br/>
my icey trip to permafrost for runed circlet, organised within this week.<br/>
<br/>
Only for lvl 30 and above, dun wanna invite train like last time.  Even in <br/>
Najena, where I can solo in Derz room, I also get killed by a massive train <br/>
after my grp invite a lvl 25 necro, KNN.  Kena killed for nothing. ;(<br/>
