heres my advice... yes i have seen other mages use better staff than RTS... but its much sort after by alot of mages as its not too difficult to camp fer... also... i believe there r many more magical stuff hidden... unkonwn... or will be introduce to the game at a later stage... DONT BUY THEM... persoally i think.. the most impt thing is ya char... build up the skills well... n u can be as good if u use rite strategies when in combat... BUT if someone decides to give u those stuff... then thats another story... hehehee :) *thanks again YY*...<br/>
<br/>
i believe with the sg community... we have a high chance of getting the items we need... esp when theres only 1 of your type... so if someone else have got someone u want... they will most likely give it (or loan it) to u.... am i rite guys? i think there r a couple of sites u can have a look at... they provide useful info... (email me for them if u want my EQ bookmarks)...<br/>

  Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
  OK...i really wanna hear some info if anyone&#39;s kind enough :)<br/>
<br/>
  1. Is the RTS the best 2HB weapon one can get?? Or are there more? sounds limited if it is... Any DMG stat?<br/>
<br/>
  2. Same again...FBR the best? or? Anyone can tell me the AC?<br/>
<br/>
  3. Hope someone can provide the prices for them...and location to buy? Or have to be bought from PCs? Loot??<br/>
<br/>
  4. Gossamer and Woven robes and stuff....how much should i be willing to pay for them? and which is better?<br/>
  Should i go ahead and get them?<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s it for now i guess =)<br/>
