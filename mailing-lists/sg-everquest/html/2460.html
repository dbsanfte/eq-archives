<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026882054">So does it mean once I get ROO, I can kill the npc liao? (wiz no need to go <br/>
OOT to buy scrolls right?).  Btw, anyone try swiming to OOT b4?  During <br/>
newbie time I once crash on boat and fall into OOT, swim to an isle and <br/>
gate back to GF.  I&#39;m thinking maybe now it&#39;s time I can swim to OOT, if I <br/>
happened to kill that npc too much, hehe.<br/>
I have not travel by boating since lvl 20 liao, hehe....<br/>
Btw wat&#39;s the lvl of that npc?  I heard it wont affect ya faction with <br/>
dwarf city, true?<br/>
U are a druid right?  Can teleport anywhere other then OOT (swim lor).<br/>
<br/>
Come to think it, Fes and I used to be so concern abt factions with good <br/>
npc, in the end we also killed until KOS by treants.  Compared with those <br/>
kakis who hunt whole day in HH pass, it&#39;s very hard to reject the <br/>
temptation to kill treants, hehe.<br/>
