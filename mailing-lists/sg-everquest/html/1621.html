<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237772974">Yeah,<br/>
<br/>
Just in case any of you don&#39;t know..the damned servers are down..and at 2220 hrs Verant Techs sent<br/>
a system wide msg stating that they are &quot;sorry&quot; but had underestimated the time needed...and yes<br/>
it would probably take another 3 hrs!!!! WTF??? I can only play from 10pm to 1am most days and that is<br/>
at BEST. I usually play less than that (excluding weekends) and it HAD to be down during those rare 3 hrs i can play..<br/>
GOD....<br/>
I&#39;m already starting to lag behind in levelling if u ask me...compared to those ppl with more time..&quot;damned Verant damned Verant&quot; (Chant after me!)<br/>
<br/>
ok..so anyway..wish you guys fun..i&#39;m probably gonna sleep soon if they don&#39;t come back on soon. Yeah i need sleep.<br/>
Work 11-12 hrs a day and it&#39;s not an office job type.<br/>
<br/>
Pissed Regards,<br/>
