<b>Subject:</b> RE: Abit bout the guild thing. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250464770">I&#39;m talking abt general case.  Like my RL friend who just start playing EQ. <br/>
 KNN I spend so much time giving his stuffs and helping him to go here and <br/>
there.  Everytime he got killed and cant find corpse, I gotta help him <br/>
refill equipment, hehe, until now he more or less settled with a Erudite <br/>
wiz ;)<br/>
<br/>
I think general case - help to seek corpse can be done by asking in the <br/>
zone, or any one in guild if they r available to do so.  But when it come <br/>
to problematic situation, there must be someone in the guild who is <br/>
&quot;idling&quot; ard and can offer help, esp when we play almost in the same time <br/>
frame.  Basically I just dun like to see pple abusing such aid.  And first <br/>
thing 1st, as in many EQ guidelines, it&#39;s better to explore a new place <br/>
with some kakis.  Dun suga suga explore some high lvl dungeon which u dun <br/>
even know if u can handle.  If u r not sure of the hunting spot, at least <br/>
asking in guidesay or in mailing list, or best, check the net.  With the <br/>
exisitng kakis, most are ard lvl 20, so shldnt have such problem.<br/>
<br/>
In ya case when u fall into Befallen&#39;s wall, it shld be ok to seek help <br/>
from guild.  Definitely someone will be there to help, but dun expect all <br/>
to stop everything they r doing to come, esp those who need to take boats <br/>
and run 10 zones to reach u ;)  If a newbie just suga suga go najena, <br/>
hoping to get some good loot by luck, and definitely he cant cope with the <br/>
mob, then good luck to him.  If someone in guild is available to save him, <br/>
good.  If not, I will let this newbie die and learn his lesson ;)<br/>
<br/>
We have to set a general guideline and view ah-hoc case by case.  If <br/>
everytime there is a SOS and all is expected to go rescue, this kinda guild <br/>
I also dun wanna join, since been a wiz who is expected to travel easier, <br/>
I&#39;m to &#39;expected&#39; to be the 1st one to turn up for the rescue ;)<br/>
<br/>
There is once a UO guild member&#39;s younger bro who play UO and always got <br/>
killed in the game, and start icqing all to save him.  So much so that in <br/>
the end there is one time where no one turn up to help him (not willing or <br/>
no one online) and he send a mass icq barking at everyone.  All I did is to <br/>
reply his icq, f**k him upside down and tell him if he dun apologize to all <br/>
and change his manner, I will ban him out of guild.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the day, it all depend if individual can think maturely.  If <br/>
any member cannot learn to be independent and too reliance on others, I <br/>
will give no face and f**k him upside. ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; thx for the nomination tho&#39; ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. As for banking and equipment, i propsed those 2 person, instead of<br/>
&gt; &gt; using their banks, get them to create a char just for the purpose of<br/>
&gt; &gt; banking. So it will be easier for them to keep track of money and stuff<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; those money is not to be abused. We can have a store of items and LOAN<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; to members in the guild (e.g., RTS and other stuff), when these members<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; capable of geting one, they will return it or pass it to another member<br/>
&gt; &gt; requiring it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Loaning items is abit difficult in EQ, due to:<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Not easy to meet to borrow and return stuffs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Loading a char in EQ can be quite time consuming, unlike UO.  So if <br/>
