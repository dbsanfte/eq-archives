<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328971702">Aye i agree with this point. Having a local name might sound wierd in such a game, like having singlish in compositions ) However, i think the name is not very important and no matter what name it is, its STILL a singapore guild and i think everyone would still support it wholeheartedly )<br/>

    Greetings!<br/>
    <br/>
    Well, The Order of Manticore is not bad. Clan Red Lions is not bad. Well, I know you people want recognition for Singapore but seriously. The guild name doesn&#39;t sound appealing hehehe!<br/>
    <br/>
    I am on Enteri&#39;s side, on choosing Fantasy titles. They sound nicer, well at least to me, and they also fit into the game better.<br/>
    <br/>
    And lastly, like one of you mentioned and I&#39;m sure all of you agree. THAT THIS guild is also open to foreigners. So why make those French, Americans join &quot;Lee Kwan Yew&quot;? They would surely feel better with xxx&lt;Ridgerunners&gt; or xxx&lt;ClintonRules&gt; instead of xxx&lt;SiBeiKiasu&gt;. I believe you people get my point.<br/>
    <br/>
    My 2 cents,<br/>
