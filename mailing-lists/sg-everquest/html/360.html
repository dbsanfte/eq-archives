&gt;LOL, me already there with a gnomish necromancer too, let make an evil dark<br/>
&gt;twins, hehe.  So coincident, we always select the same race and class,<br/>
&gt;great minds think alike?  LOL.  I guess I better change char liao this time<br/>
&gt;(thou I always fancy the Life Tap spells of necro), so that we can pair up<br/>
&gt;to hunt.  How abt a TSK?  More evil than u leh.  Hehe, since u wanna play<br/>
&gt;evil, play dark-evil necro lor, ;)  We can meet and tag team (tank and<br/>
&gt;caster) to destroy all light in Prexus server!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Regarding the XP thing, not sure if new EQ server gain xp faster, but it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;very true for UO new server.  In mature server it takes months to make a GM<br/>
&gt;smith but in new server it only take a week or two. I guess it&#39;s not a bad<br/>
&gt;time for us to try it out, esp our chars are all pretty young in Innoruuk.<br/>
&gt; No harm trying too, say spend few days to a week there.  Maybe we all gain<br/>
&gt;much higher lvl in new server as compare to few weeks play in Innoruuk ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think DE Necro and TSK will make a great EVIL team.  One more shaman<br/>
&gt;(healer/buffer)  will be nice for a evil party, whahahahahahah!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Btw Les, Gandalf is more for good char.  Not so suitable for evil char leh.<br/>

&gt;&gt; As you guys might have known, the new server Prexus is up already. Being<br/>
&gt;a wizard, I have always wanted to play the dark side and have always been<br/>
&gt;fascinated by the necromancer&#39;s array of spells. Therefore i have decided<br/>
&gt;to make a Gnomish Necromancer in the Prexus server and see how it goes.<br/>
&gt;Being a new server, less people would probably be there, and thus the<br/>
&gt;initial xp gain should be speedy enough. Anyone who is willing to switch<br/>
&gt;servers for a while to try out the class they always wanted, but not able<br/>
&gt;to bear to leave their main characters can always join me. )<br/>
&gt;&gt; My nick there would probably be Gandalf but if server does not allow it,<br/>
&gt;then Khadgar or Leshrac. Laters!<br/>
