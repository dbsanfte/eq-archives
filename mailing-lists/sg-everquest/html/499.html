<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647993132">Troll Shaman, depending on your diety choosen might even be KOS by Dark Elfs,<br/>
so be warn.<br/>
<br/>
DO NOT CHOOSE THE TROLL SHADOW KNIGHT. They are over powerful for the first 10<br/>
or so levels, but pass that, they are useless as hell. Heck, with their<br/>
intelligence, they have so little mana that they can&#39;t use their spells they<br/>
got until a few levels later. Plus, TSK is 80% KOS by Dark Elf too.<br/>

&gt; Anyone read the recent EQ review in CGW June issue?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It pointed out that EQ is more of a hack and slash RPG while UO has more<br/>
&gt; stuffs other than hack & slash.   Somehow I agree coz seem like I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; nothing much to do other than blasting monsters in EQ, hehe.   Dunno how<br/>
&gt; long can this &#39;blasting&#39; will last me in EQ ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Btw, I&#39;m having a hard time in Steamfont Mountain after my wiz achieve lvl<br/>
&gt; 5 via soloing, AGAIN.  As in Felwithe, I&#39;m having a hard time finding a<br/>
&gt; good team to gain XP to higher lvl. 90% of the team I mixed so far sux -<br/>
&gt; some members even disband and flee when a train of monsters killed our<br/>
&gt; tanks and rushed towards the casters, LOL. (Oh remember the name David,<br/>
&gt; this guy looted everything in group hunting and said &quot;who loot also nimnd&quot;,<br/>
&gt; hehe, and he is always the first one who disband and flee when danger arise<br/>
&gt; - his name disappear in group list not becoz he LD but I personally see him<br/>
&gt; running off, hehe).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone make a gnomish char?  Need a buddy badly there ;)  If not, I will<br/>
&gt; create a TSK or TSH (someone said we need more cleric/shaman chars in<br/>
&gt; Prexus guild?) and solo all the way - ie make the darkest evil char.  Kinda<br/>
&gt; sian finding pple to team with.  Been a lawful good char in UO, maybe it &#39;s<br/>
&gt; time to make a chaotic evil one in EQ, wahahahaha!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Btw, Leshrec, need to check with u.  Regarding ya DEN, do u intend to<br/>
&gt; role-play evil or intend to &quot;turn over a new leave&quot; (ie improve ya faction<br/>
&gt; with other races)?  Anyone ever think of building a high lvl EVIL char and<br/>
&gt; wipe off an npc town? hehehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
