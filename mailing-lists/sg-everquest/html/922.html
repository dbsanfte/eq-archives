<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742036241">Seem like this mailing list has gone very quiet since the school re-open, <br/>
or is it something wrong with it?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, anyone got any good guide on training smithing.  I always wonder <br/>
why they say smithing can make BIG money.  Does it need other skill like <br/>
tailoring to supplement it?<br/>
