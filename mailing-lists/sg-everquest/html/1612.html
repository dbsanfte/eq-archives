<b>Subject:</b> RE: Lvl 21 onwards <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604542952">U can now start to team or solo in Lake Rathetear.  That place is damn good for lvl 20-23 (team), lvl 24 to 26 (solo).  <br/>
Once lvl 27, less than half of the green chick will give u xp (and less than 1/3 of the aviak guards are blue to u).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done my training there, now I&#39;m going somewhere else for my lvl 29 ;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Any reccomendations on where to hunt for good xp at lvl 21?<br/>
&gt; I want creatures that con black/yellow at this lvl..<br/>
&gt; Griffenes in North Karanas are too tough to solo (did do a few in group of<br/>
&gt; 4) and the rest (beetles,griffawns,etc...)<br/>
&gt; mostly not good xp. Also anyone has an idea of how many lvls a mob has to be<br/>
&gt; above you to resist your spells?<br/>
&gt; I was getting totally resisted by one red conned griffene which was really<br/>
&gt; tough as even the lvl 22 tanks in our group<br/>
&gt; was doing much much less than his normal max dmg. And a lvl 18 ranger was<br/>
&gt; either getting riposted or only doing 1 dmg<br/>
&gt; max!<br/>
&gt; Hope to hear some comments/opinions!<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
