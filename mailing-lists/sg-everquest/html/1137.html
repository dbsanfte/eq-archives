<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641383299">Got Imporatnt, Serious , Life Threathening , Money essential  Question of<br/>
Brewing.<br/>
<br/>
I go to my monk guild. Check on trade skills. On the Left bar all the skills<br/>
avaible for me, On the right bar Skills I have my exiting skills and the<br/>
diff lvl i have attained.<br/>
<br/>
I did not find Brewing to be on the Left bar listing of Skills. .... on the<br/>
right bar Brewing is listed... so i presume i can practise on the<br/>
skill...but cant add Pratice points to it......  Right??<br/>
<br/>
I go brew mend for 20+ rounds alredi... nothing. just told me.. &quot;...donst<br/>
combine in the right quality or something..blah blah.&quot; so how?<br/>
<br/>
Does Eq restricts the amount of trade skill u can have at one time? I have<br/>
Smithing, Taloiring, felcthing and Brewing in on Right bar.</div>
