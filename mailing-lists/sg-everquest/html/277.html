 Last weekend, saturday. Leshrec, Trifrost and I was suposed to go to<br/>
Faydwek. I was looking forward to it. too bad the ship didnt come. it was<br/>
&quot;under repair&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Call a GM, my friend was given a free transportation from Freeport to<br/>
Qeynos. Wheew...surely saved him alot of travelling time. Haha, but make<br/>
sure to be really polite.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if any of u guys r keen on any of this expedition.<br/>
Hit Frogglocks, get woven and mesh and get out. I should think that Guk is<br/>
a whole day trip of 6 hrs(real Time), including hunting. Getting there is<br/>
pretty fast. about 15 mins(real time).<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;6 hours will get you very little. Not enough to go around. Trying to get<br/>
netted armour as loot is hard enough. I believe in just saving up and then<br/>
buy it from some merchant. BTW, Guk has a reputation for being an easy<br/>
dungeon near the first few areas. Then its hell...especially with the<br/>
trains. </span></blockquote></div>
