<b>Subject:</b> RE: How many of u guys at Tribunal? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968072858">Great minds think alike ;).  As in my previous mail, I dun mind sparing <br/>
10-20pp, which I believe can use to purchase quite a descent set of newbie <br/>
equipements tat can last u for the 1st 5-8 lvls at least.  I do that to my <br/>
wiz friend in Inno and he is still using those stuffs at lvl 12 ;)<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I also didnt power train my friend&#39;s wiz.  I tried once power train <br/>
his ranger char and buy him weap/armor.  In the end he dun have much EQ <br/>
experience (not experience &#39;points&#39;!) like those who started in scratch and <br/>
lost his corpse (lvl 7 or 8) after dying (cant locate his corpse) - waste <br/>
my money and time. After tat I ask him to think clearly what he wanan be <br/>
and he selected wiz.  I passed some pp to him, buying a set of clothes, and <br/>
some lvl 1 & 4 spells and I leave him to &quot;rot&quot;, heheh.  Now he is already <br/>
lvl 12 wiz, able to stand on his own.  Tat&#39;s why I never believe in power <br/>
twinking & baby-sitting others ;)  No doubts it&#39;s very shiok to wear ROO, <br/>
SOO, glowing stein etc at lvl 1 wiz, but ultimately u will also miss alot <br/>
of &quot;knowledge and wisdom (fun)&quot;, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Les and FF will be in a better position to explain an incident where we <br/>
meet a &#39;super-blur-fu*k&#39; power-twinked lvl 40 magi when we camp in Najena <br/>
for FBR, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Ziltus<br/>
<br/>
p/s: Part-time baby-sitting is still accepted by me.  If u training a <br/>
ranger, i guess our guild shld be able to help u out abit in lvling, since <br/>
now most of us can handle things well and we just need someone to track for <br/>
named mob ;)<br/>
<br/>
p/s: Most of us are playing good races, except Nica and Kenven.  If u start <br/>
evil race char and hang ard evil race region, we wont be able to help u too <br/>
often ;)<br/>

&gt; My idea of twinkering is like this. I give you 10 plat for you to buy a<br/>
&gt; rusty weap, and patchwork or clothe<br/>
