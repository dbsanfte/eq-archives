<div id="ygrps-yiv-418261989">dont think i will be able to do that since i can only play like once a<br/>
week... n thats it... nothin more... (main reason: ill be using my office pc<br/>
to play when no one else is around, least during weekend i have excuse to do<br/>
that). But ill try real hard to join u guys... i do believe that the<br/>
leveling is exponential... so i should be able to catch up with u guys<br/>
sooner or later....  :)<br/>
dont expect u guys to give me all the goodies... even showing me all the<br/>
spawn areas helps... or who to look fer... fer quest n stuff like that....<br/>
anyway... im doing as much reading up on various sites b4 i start... so i<br/>
dont spend too much time trying to figure out what is what....<br/>

&gt; Those people who are still under level 12 and are still not with me, try<br/>
&gt; to get to Kithicor Forest by today if you are playing an evil race or<br/>
&gt; Misty Thicket if you are playing a good race.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We will be entering Runny Eye Citidel for leveling up purposes and will<br/>
&gt; stay there till around level 15(that means, at least a week).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Still need a freaking Cleric......<br/>
