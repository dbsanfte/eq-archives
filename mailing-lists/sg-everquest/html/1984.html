1. I&#39;m starting up an ICQ active list. All go download the new ver. It<br/>
basically act as a RL msg board, and is intergrated intpo your contact list.<br/>
<br/>
2. You mail Red Dawn loh. My e-mail too cluttered liao<br/>
<br/>
3. General organisation, you and I do, BUT we only plan activities for across<br/>
the guild. Those who wishes to volunteer for the lvl event thingy, doi so now,<br/>
or I&#39;ll saboh you.<br/>

&gt; 1. Mailing list is good.  Maybe we can consider if msg board can do the job<br/>
&gt; better?  Esp a password protected one to prevent other retarded goons<br/>
&gt; anyhow jump in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. FF got web space, but it&#39;s his personal&#39;s.  I wonder what if we get<br/>
&gt; those free space from some webspace provider?  Singularity boss Red Dawn<br/>
&gt; also mentioned a EQ space reserved for us.  I guess we just need to get<br/>
&gt; from him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. Appoint one Events Officer for each 10-lvl categories.  At least one lvl<br/>
&gt; guild hunt per fortnight?  Eg Lvl 30-40 Event Officer to organise at least<br/>
&gt; 1 lvl 30-40 guild hunt once every 2 weeks.  He can also &#39;arrow&#39; another lvl<br/>
&gt; 30-40 kakis to do the organisation once a month (ie 2 events per month,<br/>
&gt; officer must organise one of the 2 events, the other he can assign other<br/>
&gt; lvl 30-40 kakis to organise).  Best is each one in the lvl category has a<br/>
&gt; chance to organise.  Everyone must contribute mah, right? ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. Kakis Heritage System<br/>
&gt; If any kakis found an artifact which he dun bother to sell or none of his<br/>
&gt; chars can use it, he can pass to another kakis who can use it.  Say Garren<br/>
&gt; found a Thug robe which he or his other chars can&#39;t use, and he dun bother<br/>
&gt; to sell.  In the end he gave to Ziltus.  Later when Ziltus got a Goss robe,<br/>
&gt; he is NOT supposed to sell the Thug robe for his own benefit.  Instead, he<br/>
&gt; pass it to FF.  Now FF got a FBR, he will then pass the Thug robe to the<br/>
&gt; next kakis who can use it.  This way we can practice kakis heritage system<br/>
&gt; which will benefit more kakis.<br/>
