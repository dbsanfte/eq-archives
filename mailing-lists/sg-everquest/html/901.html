<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625291990">Sorry every1 , i know tat this does not concern EQ anyway but i need to<br/>
know how much Telecom charge for phone usage per minute or 1 hrs??<br/>
<br/>
Just recently saw that Cyberway is offering unlimited access for $48 but<br/>
is non-tollfree.<br/>
Was interested in it but afraid tat the phone bill might burn a hole in<br/>
my pocket :)<br/>
On one hand the unlimited access will solved my problem of overclocking<br/>
my time limit in playing EQ but on the other hand the phone bill .......<br/>
<br/>
So hope all of u can give me the answer to my dilemma and thanks in<br/>
advance :)<br/>
