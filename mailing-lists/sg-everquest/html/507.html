Well, I know of a high level ranger. Hitting 30 I think. He kills Ebons to<br/>
Emeralds before. He didn&#39;t mention anything about faction. Or maybe he did<br/>
but I forgot.<br/>

&gt; I myself was hunting emerald drakes with a group of guys 2 weeks ago and<br/>
&gt; one of them is a wood-elf cleric or something like tat.  He refuse to<br/>
&gt; attack emerald drakes coz he got a faction msg after he kill one.  In the<br/>
&gt; end we went for goblin camps instead. </span></blockquote></div>
