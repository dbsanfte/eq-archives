<b>Subject:</b> Spell Caster Analysis - A deeper look into Wizard (TXT) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935259702">OK, at high lvl, wiz basically can only root, nuke, root, nuke again, root <br/>
again...We stand no chance meleeing with those high lvl monsters that one <br/>
hit can send us back to our makers, hehe.  Dun ask me why I enjoy it.  It&#39;s <br/>
the same principle for cleric - buff, heal, buff again, heal again...;)<br/>
<br/>
Since we can only root & nuke, basically melee skills is kinda useless to <br/>
us (unless we just hunt monsters much lower lvl then us for the sake of $$$ <br/>
but no XP), our market value thus based solely on our mana, which is again <br/>
solely dependent on INT.  Think in this way, having 10% INT, say will give <br/>
u 10% more mana for each lvl u gain, and this difference in gain is very <br/>
huge when u get to high lvl.  Thus having max INT is the dream of all spell <br/>
casters.<br/>
<br/>
H/w, on the other hand, having high mana is only useful if you dun frizzle <br/>
or get disturbed while casting.  For every failure to cast a spell, half <br/>
the mana (not too sure, but definitely there is a cap) will still be <br/>
consumed.  Thus having high DEX comes into the picture.  With high DEX, you <br/>
can cast faster (ie recover faster after u cast a spell b4 u can cast the <br/>
next one).  Not just that, high AGI is also important as it allow u to <br/>
avoid been hit by monsters, ie lesser chance to be disturbed while casting. <br/>
 Now thou I mentioned wiz sux big time in melee, there are still certain <br/>
time we have to help to &#39;tong&#39; for few seconds for our tanks to take a <br/>
break (like I sometime help to tank when my group paladin need a break to <br/>
use lay hand).  Thus having high AGI can &#39;lengthen&#39; ya duration for tanking <br/>
since u can last longer without been hit by monsters, or been hit less.  At <br/>
low lvl, AGI is actually quite important for ya survival coz many times u <br/>
will still have to depend on ya melee skills to help in a battle.<br/>
<br/>
Now, let us look at the races available for wiz (in this analysis I will <br/>
leave out STA, which is supposed to be a critical stats for wiz but I <br/>
really dun see its usefulness as compared to DEX & AGI at high lvl).  I&#39;m <br/>
also assuming creating a &#39;more&#39; all-rounded wiz (ie high AGI and DEX) than <br/>
a nuke-only wiz.<br/>
<br/>
1. Dark Elf<br/>
DEX 90, AGI 75, INT 107 = 272, bonus point 30.<br/>
I think there is a ceiling for INT for each race but I&#39;m not too sure abt <br/>
DE.  In order to make a 90 DEX and 90 AGI, I will then left 122 for INT, <br/>
making it total for 3 stats is 302.<br/>
Plus point - ultravision, hide	<br/>
Neg point - evil (but easiest to improve faction amg the 3 evil races, <br/>
unless u r a DEN).<br/>
On one hand this race got lesser INT then Erudite and Gnome, but looking in <br/>
deeper you will realise that this race got 2nd place in term of DAI <br/>
(Dex+Agi+Int) at 302.  It&#39;s also the only evil race available for wiz and <br/>
it give much role-play elements in this combo.  Comparing with DEN, DE wiz <br/>
will walk an easier path in gaining good faction with other races.  If you <br/>
wanna role-play an evil yet powerful (look cool too) wiz, this is the <br/>
number one choice.<br/>
<br/>
2. Erudite		<br/>
DEX 70, AGI 70, INT 115 = 255, bonus point 30.<br/>
Max INT u can have is 115+27=142 (dun ask me why, that&#39;s the max INT I can <br/>
get from my trial char).  The remaining 3 pts I put to DEX making it 73. <br/>
 So total of 3 stats = 285<br/>
Plus point - highest INT for all races<br/>
Neg point - No infravision<br/>
Everyone is talking about INT, and Erudite is alway been preceived to be <br/>
the most potential among all races to be a wiz.  But on a 2nd look, the DAI <br/>
only amount to 285, which put them #3 on the list, in par with high elf but <br/>
better than human.  The inability to look in the dark will also pose <br/>
problem in the early stage of ya game, esp b4 you get the Halo of Light <br/>
spell at lvl 12.  For those who used to have infravision char like me, this <br/>
handicap is unbearable!  With the newbie candle, I was whacked upside down <br/>
when I try to hunt in the night by 3-4 skeletons.  I have so much problem <br/>
finding my way back to my corpse and I just delete off my erudite wiz ;(<br/>
This race is very good if you have reliable companions who always hunt with <br/>
u and tank everything.  Only then you can show ya color with 142 INT, <br/>
without disturbance from monsters hit.  Once enaged in normal battle, you <br/>
will find yaself got hit very often and casting get disturbed regularly. <br/>
 If you intend to play as a normal wiz (ie soloing + grouping), this will <br/>
be a difficult race to play with.  H/w, once u reach high lvl where you <br/>
value lies only on nuking, it&#39;s very cool to have the largest mana pool on <br/>
you.  All you need is the endurance to last till that lvl, coz life is <br/>
gonna be VERY hard on you.  This is especially true in the begining stage, <br/>
as Erudin is an isolated isle with mainly spell caster classes.  Err, yes, <br/>
you are right, the land also produce paladin but who wanna be an Erudite <br/>
paladin? ;)<br/>
<br/>
3. Gnome<br/>
DEX 85, AGI 85, INT 108 = 278, bonus point 30.<br/>
Topping up my DEX & AGI to 90, I left 128 for INT, making it total of 308.<br/>
Plus point - infravision, tinkering, faction<br/>
Neg point - short, ugly, look dumb and weak<br/>
OK, I know this race is short, look dumb, look weak, and worst, his eye lvl <br/>
cannot even meet the breast of an half-elf ;(  But hey, looking into the <br/>
DAI this race is no doubt the most powerful &#39;potential&#39; archwizard!  No <br/>
doubt abt it.  With high INT, I can finish most of my foes so far b4 I used <br/>
up my mana.  With high DEX I cast fast and I seldom get disturbed due to my <br/>
high AGI.  Generally speaking, I stand a higher chance in surviving when <br/>
fighting opponents on par with me.<br/>
I personally feel that this race is the &#39;power&#39; race for most spell <br/>
casters, not just wiz.  The unqiue tinkering skill is also commonly <br/>
welcomed by most humaniod races (infravision goggles).<br/>
H/w, main problem with this race is the outlook.  If you wanna flirt with <br/>
female chars in this game, gnome is a no no for you.  I agreed with Leshrec <br/>
abt their dumb look, hehe.  Another advantage of gnome is its neutral <br/>
faction towards all other races (only dwarf and gnome enjoy such faction). <br/>
 They will not be KOS by any other races, thou they will be treated like <br/>
2nd class citizens in evil race communities.  This make them a fairly easy <br/>
to travel spell casters.<br/>
Sight is also a problem at times, since you eye lvl is low and will face <br/>
difficulty in sighting incoming monsters.<br/>
Conclusion.  If you wanna make a easy-to-play, easy-to-travel, potential <br/>
&quot;powerplay&#39; wiz, this is the race for you.<br/>
NB:  Gnome got the highest vital stats total (INT & DEX) AND DAI score for <br/>
necromancer among all races.  Thus making it the #1 choice for necromancer <br/>
if u dun mind the look, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
4. High Elf<br/>
DEX 85, AGI 70, INT 100 = 255, bonus point 30.<br/>
Making 90 DEX and 90 AGI leave me 105 for INT, ie total of 285.<br/>
Plus point - Infravision, CHA<br/>
Neg point - low STR<br/>
They have the same DAI as erudite, with advantage of infravision and <br/>
weakness of low STR (meaning you can&#39;t carry too many loot and have to go <br/>
town sell often).  On the other hand, they high CHA amg all wiz allow them <br/>
to buy low sell high.  Basically my gnome wiz buy his lvl 2 scrolls 1 gp <br/>
higher than my high elf wiz.  EQ is quite balance - u carry less, you sell <br/>
high and buy low, OR you carry more, you sell low and buy high ;)<br/>
At STR55, my advice is to throw in at least 5 bonus points on STR, and that <br/>
leave me only 25 points for my AGI and INT ;(  Note that this is the only <br/>
race that give both high INT and WIS.  Too bad EQ do not have kickass <br/>
hybrid classes like figher/cleric/mage, cleric/mage, fighter/thief/mage as <br/>
in  AD&D, otherwise its high DEX, INT and WIS shld make it the most <br/>
powerful char of all times.<br/>
Nevertheless, HE is a &#39;high social&#39; race.  If you wanna role-play as a <br/>
flirting around playboy, this is the race to go for. ;P<br/>
<br/>
5. Human<br/>
DEX 75, AGI 75, INT 85 = 235, bonus point 30.<br/>
Making 90 AGI and 90 DEX is totally impractical, which leave you with 85 <br/>
INT.  Can forget abt human wiz, unless you are only concern abt gaining lvl <br/>
faster than other races. Yet with this kinda sucking stats, you wont go far <br/>
even you are given the previldge of gaining xp faster.<br/>
Huh?  You still want my comments on human wiz? FORGET it, I&#39;ve NO COMMENT! <br/>
;-P<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, to answer ya stats qeries.<br/>
<br/>
Agility<br/>
This is your physical dexterity and is used to determine your defensive <br/>
abilities. The higher your agility, the less likely you are to be hit by <br/>
melee combat. This attribute is critical for rogues, who rely on deftness. <br/>
(Note, getting less hits from monsters means your casting will not be <br/>
disturbed so often)<br/>
Dexterity<br/>
This is your hand-eye coordination and is used in combat accuracy and <br/>
spell-casting capability. It is used in calculating your missile combat <br/>
skills and aids in determining what happens if you are interrupted when you <br/>
are hit while casting a spell. (Note, this mean how fast you can recover <br/>
and get rdy to cast the next spell after been hit, been disturbed or <br/>
encounter failure in casting, something like spell delay in UO)<br/>
Stamina<br/>
This is your health and constitution. It reflects your ability to perform <br/>
strenuous tasks without becoming exhausted. It is also used in calculating <br/>
your hit points.  (Note, I personally feel that, for high lvl wiz, having <br/>
high AGI is more important than having high STA - coz it&#39;ll be better to <br/>
have a higher percentage to avoid monsters&#39; hits than to take a 100 dam hit <br/>
with additional 25 HP gain due to STA).<br/>
<br/>
Hey Fred, did u read the 146 pages EQ guide which I send u?  I got that <br/>
from Game Guide , took me more than 2 hrs to copy/paste and complie it <br/>
nicely.  I even print out and bind it as a book for my own study and <br/>
refernce.  I do have another 100 over pages binded EQ reference, which I <br/>
have spend few days to print out char guides, char creation, spells <br/>
description etc, all abt char development from many EQ sites.  Too bad I <br/>
have problem copy/paste those articles into MS word (due to the boxes they <br/>
use), thus I gotta print online.  This book contains lots of tricks, tips <br/>
and player guides, but no way for me to email u ;(<br/>
<br/>
Anyyway, depending on individual playing style, you might not wanna put 90 <br/>
stats for DEX and AGI, and leave more bonus point for ya INT.  But for me, <br/>
I&#39;m very happy with the way things going so far.  In order to carry more <br/>
loot, I also throw 5 points to my STR, making it 65 and my INT 123 instead <br/>
of 128.  That&#39;s all I can share for spell casters.  U might wanna consider <br/>
all these points for your necromancer ;)<br/>
