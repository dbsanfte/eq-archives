<b>Subject:</b> RE: How many of u guys at Tribunal? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-853175641">We are hunting FBR tat day, not boot.  She was hunting there naked, and 1 <br/>
day later we heard from her friend auction in SK tat she is selling FBR. <br/>
 Seem like she hunt FBR for income, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, as for the tin pie, not sure if it&#39;s as bad as u mentioned, but I <br/>
heard u actually need to do something to make it rather than to buy it.  I <br/>
think the impact is not tat extreme.  Anway even for new servers, there is <br/>
still exploits which pple use to make tons and tons of money. Say by tat <br/>
time u got a lvl 40 char and u are not aware of the bug where others have <br/>
used it to make tons of pp, what u gonna do? ;)  Just like the gp dupe in <br/>
UO, everyone still live with it. Over time, houses will decay...players <br/>
quit...the economy will slowly go back to normal (macro-economics? hahaha).<br/>
<br/>
The nerfing of necro pet is just a rumor.  Dun take everythig in test <br/>
center as 100% confirmed.  Some they tested but decide not to implement <br/>
instead.  Anyway, I dun think necro need 3x longer casting time than wiz. <br/>
 I got some necro friends and when we hunt, I can see their spells hit the <br/>
mob almost the same time as us.  Talk abt disturbance, wiz can &#39;taunt&#39; <br/>
better than any tanks out there.  With my nuke, I always invite mob to <br/>
focus full attention on me, that why I bring at least 50 gems for <br/>
leatherskin everytime I hunt (5gp each).  When mob on me, it&#39;s more like I <br/>
get disturbed most amg all casters (dun believe, ask FF when we hunt in HH, <br/>
the mob desert him and his pet the moment I nuke it).<br/>
<br/>
DEX is not the only element to decide u get disturbed when casting.  At <br/>
high lvl, spec also play a part.  Many times I I got hit by mob but I see <br/>
msg tat I regain and con&#39;t casting.  I think for those caster with pets, u <br/>
shld let pet tank for the 1st 30% dam b4 u cast.  We wiz got no choice, no <br/>
pet to tank, so we have to nuke mob to hell b4 it kills us.<br/>
<br/>
As for lvl 31 wiz soloing 2 treants, I&#39;m the one who has done it last <br/>
night, b4 Fesse, Zan, FF and DF join me ;)  All I need it to cast leather <br/>
skin, ele shield on myself, and nuke a tree using 3 nukes (2x243, 1x187). <br/>
 After taking the 1st tree, my leatherskin is gone (but still 90% HP), then <br/>
I started nuking the 2nd.  I left 20% mana and 50% HP after killing the 2nd <br/>
(and boy, I got half bubb xp!).  I dun have any SoW or buff from other <br/>
players, just plain wiz buff and nuke ;)  One thing to highlight tat at DEX <br/>
83 only, I dun get disturbed often even when tree hit me using melee, maybe <br/>
due to my high evoke spec skill.  I also move ard when tree cast AE on me, <br/>
but I cast at the right time such tat I dun get disturbed by my own <br/>
movements.  I dunno why Maquis is so jiat-lat handling the treants (esp I <br/>
know he got Jboot), maybe becoz he only know how to steal kill and not <br/>
other wiz tactics.  See, that&#39;s why I say experiences and tactics counts ;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think my wiz stats is one of the worst ard, yet I&#39;m still <br/>
surviving.  I also whine sometime when I see other casters using they pets <br/>
to lvl, but deep inside I know if there is a server wipe, I will still go <br/>
back to wiz ;)  I hope u have found a right choice for youself. ;)<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1. EQ is all abt lvl. Quite true, unlike UO we got more things (eg GM<br/>

&gt; &gt; 5. I think both UO and EQ are equally good, coz they belongs to 2<br/>

&gt; solo<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2 trees, since we nuke faster than treants nuke us.  In train-proned<br/>
