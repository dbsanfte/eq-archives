<b>Subject:</b> Mana calculation <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-714052763">There is a mana calculation s/w in EQSS, pretty useful.  Thou&#39; it&#39;s a very <br/>
small file but it&#39;s not my habit to send attached files over mailing list <br/>
(scare kena whacked).  Those who are interested can d/l them.<br/>
<br/>
Btw now I really regret allocating 20 points on my STR, and the remaining <br/>
on STA and INT, sigh.<br/>
If I have an opportunity restart a char, I will still play a wiz, but for <br/>
race, I will either choose:<br/>
1. Human<br/>
Dump max point into INT, the rest to DEX.  Since all other stats are quite <br/>
balance, I will buy all INT jewelries to boost my INT further.  With no xp <br/>
penalty, shld be able to lvl quite fast.  The night vision problem can be <br/>
solved using lightglobe (lvl 1 spell) or light bank (lvl 16 spell).<br/>
OR<br/>
2. Erudite<br/>
Dump max point into INT, the rest to DEX.  Thou&#39; got more INT, but also got <br/>
10% xp penalty, kinda offset as compared to human.  Night vision thingy <br/>
applies.  This race is the best option for ultimate killer-nuker at lvl 50, <br/>
hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Of coz, if I dun mind the look and short sight, I can select gnome for <br/>
power play - best choice for solo caster in my opinion, due to the high <br/>
INT, DEX and AGI.<br/>
<br/>
Dark Elf is out of question since i dun really like to role-play as an evil <br/>
race, where in RL or in game, unless the power-play capability is worth <br/>
been a evil char ;)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, anyone ever think of playing in the race war server? Heheh OK OK, dun <br/>
throw parang first lah.  I&#39;m only asking, hehe.  Read quite a few articles <br/>
in the net on the coming race war server (eg analysing which group is more <br/>
or less powerful), sound pretty fun and have lot of role-play elements. <br/>
 One thing for sure, it&#39;s gonna be a VERY difficult server to survive <br/>
(since u will be KOS in many places), hehe.<br/>
