<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977563113">Hi LKW aka Ziltus!<br/>
<br/>
One question i really want answered: Does invisiblity really keep you unseen<br/>
to monsters?<br/>
Like if i don&#39;t attack them..they won&#39;t see me? And if i do attack while<br/>
invis..does it<br/>
give any bonus of any kind eg. AC ??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the tips!! I can&#39;t cope with trains of 3 centurions now...so i&#39;ll<br/>
keep away<br/>
like you said from CB...guess until lvl 10 loh =(<br/>
<br/>
Cya soon,<br/>

&gt; I also went thru ya stage, esp wiz lagi worse since we dun have pet to<br/>
tank<br/>
&gt; us and our lvl 4 spells sux when we fight with mb same lvl as us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe I can suggest u to buy all the impt scrolls for ya next lvl, keep in<br/>
&gt; bank and go FP for hunting.  I&#39;m now camping inside CB (ok, Crushbone, not<br/>
&gt; ch** by* hor), and will take a boat back to FP either late tonight or<br/>
&gt; tomorrow.  U can give me a tell if u dunno the way to port. I can bring u<br/>
&gt; there.  But I guess I can&#39;t bring u along to CB trainer hill coz all orc<br/>
&gt; cen will attack u on sight.  For Einan I also keep casting invis on him,<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; least he is not tat bad since he can tank quite well and his lvl higher<br/>
&gt; than yours, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If u prefer to stay in Faydark, u can try to go BB.  There is a place with<br/>
&gt; few stone blocks, and inside the stone blocks center is a npc merchant.<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;ve been training there since lvl 7 to 9.  The 4 skellies there spawn at<br/>
&gt; fixed place and will not run ard, so pretty safe for u to kill one by one.<br/>
&gt;  H/w, the skellies r also lvl 7-9, that mean I have to team with a tank b4<br/>
&gt; I go there.  For magi, maybe ya pet can help u solo.  Once u get above 9,<br/>
&gt; try the bandit camp between the highelf and woodelf city.  There r 3<br/>
&gt; bandits there which r non-agro, but if u attack one, all 3 will come to u.<br/>
&gt;  U can bring a tank there safer.  Once u get to lvl 10-11, u can try<br/>
harder<br/>
&gt; places like mino cave for mino slaves or BB chestboard for skeleton<br/>
&gt; king/bishop (as a group hor).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Personally I dun advised any caster below lvl 10 to go CB, coz the loot<br/>
&gt; doesnt justify the trains.  I myself start to go there since lvl 5, and<br/>
&gt; died until I lost count liao.   Unless u can solo a train of 3-4 orc cen<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; solo an orc leg, dun bother to go there.  Places like bandit camps or BB<br/>
&gt; skellies can give better loot, better xp and most impt, better SURVIAL ;)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; p/s: Already confirmed with GM that 2nd name must be one word, but can<br/>
&gt; separate using the &#39; sighn, like Ziltus de&#39;Guailan, not bad right?  Hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p/s2: Ple pray for me to get a SBS for both Einan, Trifrost and myself<br/>
&gt; tonight.  Heard from Garren now they implement the anti-camp thingy, so<br/>
&gt; very hard to camp for item. ;(<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi Again Everyone,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh yes...here comes that favourite newbie question....<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot; I&#39;m currently a Lvl 7 Magician. Any tips on where to go hunting around<br/>
&gt; this lvl?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I desperately need plats and exp! (think plats come first...). I have<br/>
&gt; only got about<br/>
&gt; &gt; 5 plats at lvl 7...this is pathetic right?? Have yet to even buy<br/>
&gt; armor/weapons...<br/>
&gt; &gt; so far all those i use were picked up...yeah..had to scavenge orcs and<br/>
&gt; pixies... =(<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course i&#39;m still on Fawdyer...think I&#39;ll be here awhile more...i even<br/>
&gt; got killed by<br/>
&gt; &gt; Giant Spiders/Zombies in Lesser Faydark. Think i really need a lvl 8<br/>
pet!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So back to main point...if you guys can make any recommendations...would<br/>
&gt; be much appreciated!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Preferably an area in Fawdyer first..then more later =)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; BTW, I know fishing probably doesn&#39;t even come close to trade skills at<br/>
&gt; making money...but is<br/>
&gt; &gt; it actually even worth trying for some cash? In Felwithe, one fish can<br/>
&gt; sell for about 4 silver plus..<br/>
&gt; &gt; so ten is 4 gp. 100 is 4 plats!! Siong man.... Unless got better fishing<br/>
&gt; ponds? Maybe got those with<br/>
&gt; &gt; stingray or shark? Then BBQ the stingray can charge more right?? *LOL*<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; One last thing...can we actually buy and sell stuff to different towns<br/>
&gt; and make $$$??<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope to hear from you guys,<br/>
