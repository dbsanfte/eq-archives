<div id="ygrps-yiv-964165718">hehe dun call me senior wizard lah, my elf looks younger than yours =P. As<br/>
for binding, it is actually target based but can only be used in group. This<br/>
is to prevent abuse of it, like u walk anywhere, and u feel like it u just<br/>
bind someone. So no need to ungroup to bind yourself, just target yourself<br/>
and bind. To bind group members, u have to target individually and bind, no<br/>
shortcut. And yes u can bind yourself anywhere u want, but not group<br/>
members. As for the shiny brass shield, you gotta camp there for at least<br/>
2-3 days to get one unless u damn lucky. I camp there and killed 10 trainers<br/>
and i only got some raw hide armor. Of course wizard there no problem cos<br/>
its so easy to steal kills )<br/>
Woven armor is best Mid level armor for wiz. Later there is gossimer and<br/>
damask armor which looks real cool, but woven will do for now. Its same AC<br/>
as Patchwork but MUCH lighter. As for the area which u get, must be at least<br/>
level 16+. If u wanna hunt in the swamp, have to be careful of troll guards<br/>
and named troll NPCs. Of course u can hunt in guk, but beware of trains<br/>
there. I went there today and got killed twice before i got a mesh leggings<br/>
and some other netted and woven stuff.<br/>
btw, crook seldom loads on LJ, maybe as rare as trainer i dunno, but trainer<br/>
can be done at level 12+, maybe con blue i&#39;m not sure. He hits for about 20<br/>
but usually theres someone tank so u just shoot at it.<br/>
Rabies is treated as a disease so a cure disease should do it, and it lasts<br/>
quite long. Can&#39;t remember how long 45 mins real time i think.<br/>
Btw, anyone interested to hunt in Najena, the dungeon in Lavestorm? We<br/>
should get together one day and go there. Xp quite good, and unlike the<br/>
other dungeons, its quite bright and airy ) Of course an expedition to guk<br/>
would be cool too.<br/>

&gt;Hehe, thx for the help for getting me a runed totem staff.  Actually I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;already saving money for that, just that meanwhile cant afford to pay it<br/>
&gt;yet.  If anyone come across pple selling this staffs below 25pp, pls give<br/>
&gt;for me.  I wil pay back ASAP ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Btw, is woven armor good?  How is the AC and wt compare to clothes?  Any<br/>
&gt;special features?  I heard abt some swampy area quite easy to get netted<br/>
&gt;armors which can be sold at fairly good price.  Can a group of 2-3 lvl<br/>
&gt;10-12 go that place?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, oh senior wiz, pls grant me knowledge abt binding.  If I&#39;m in a<br/>
&gt;group, and we come to a town, who shld I target on in order to bind ALL<br/>
&gt;group members to the town (or do I have to target one by one and cast<br/>
&gt;bind?).  Say later we went to desert cave entrance as a group and I wanna<br/>
&gt;bind ONLY myself at the entrance (anyway out town I can only bind myself<br/>
&gt;and not the group right?), targetting myself and cast bind will only bind<br/>
&gt;myself or will affect the rest of the members?  Or, do I have to quit from<br/>
&gt;group, bind myself there then re-join group?  Any tips for binding myself<br/>
&gt;near hunting ground - so that I dun have to run so far if I die, hehe.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Alamak I also using almost full cloth armor lah. Woven very ex when those<br/>
&gt;&gt; smelly trolls sell them and the only one i got was a mask which i bought<br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;&gt; 5pp from a wooden elf. As for the magical staff, u can try to get high<br/>
&gt;level<br/>
&gt;&gt; magicians to sell u a summon one. Most of them would do it for free, but<br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;&gt; prepared to pay a few gold for them. They are almost same stats as the<br/>
&gt;great<br/>
&gt;&gt; staff, but magical and nosave. I will try to get you the staff, and i<br/>
&gt;think<br/>
&gt;&gt; should be easier cos its pending lore and no one would want to get stuck<br/>
&gt;&gt; with them. bbc is Bone bladed claymore. Its quite sucky actually,<br/>
&gt;-agility i<br/>
&gt;&gt; think. Only good thing bout it its its damage cos its a 2hander.<br/>
