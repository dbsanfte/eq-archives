 </span></blockquote>Hehe, I reach lvl 3.5 last night.  Hopefully can reach lvl 4 tonight.  The <br/>
&quot;consider&quot; command is not true, I con a bear and it say fair chance.  When <br/>
I start to fight, my hp drop so fast!  Lucky someone leave an advice to die <br/>
at somewhere easy to find.  I always run back to some place I know well b4 <br/>
I die.  Me start going to east commonland at lvl 2 - coz bats/rats take too <br/>
long for me to rise lvl, so I decided to take a risk to go out.  Anyway, no <br/>
pain no gain, no gain no glory, hahaha ;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;Nope! But enchanting jewels are good ;-) Useful to boost stats.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, then maybe it will be a good source of income right?  Any other skills <br/>
to recommand for an adventuring enchanter? :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;Hahaha! This I am not sure! I&#39;ve never been to Freeport!<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I met Yiyang last night and he given me some clothing, so touched, I&#39;ve <br/>
been searchinig/hunting few days and not yet find a decent piece of pant <br/>
(hard to buy the right stuffs coz most of them r for other race or too <br/>
expensive for me).  Thx Yiyang ;)<br/>
