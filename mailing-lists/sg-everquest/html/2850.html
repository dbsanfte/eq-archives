<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032480614">Hello Everyone !<br/>
<br/>
I just suddently quit EQ in Early January...<br/>
No idea what the hell&#39;s been going on except<br/>
everyone i know probably is at 50ish now...<br/>
heheh kinda miss it sometimes... but after playing<br/>
too long it gets monotonous .... the theory of <br/>
&quot;camping&quot; a spot over and over to gain exp is <br/>
kinda boring after a while.... although there is the<br/>
counter argument that every fight is different ...<br/>
<br/>
Anyone care to &quot;pyscho&quot; me back to EQ ?<br/>
I believe my account is still active ...<br/>
