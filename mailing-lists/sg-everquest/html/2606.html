then Knowledge then finally lvl.<br/>

&gt; Err, I was thinking of quiting also, but didnt expect u to quit earlier<br/>
&gt; than me.  EQ has turn out to be such a zombie-camping-training game that<br/>
&gt; eliminated most of the fun provided by the multi-race/class char<br/>
&gt; development concept.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To tell the truth, even after I stop playing EQ, I didn&#39;t login UO every<br/>
&gt; night.  But every time I login, there are quite a lot of stuffs I can do,<br/>
&gt; other than camping/hunting.  Both UO and EQ are not as attractive as b4,<br/>
&gt; but it&#39;s sad that say EQ has more &#39;push&#39; factor than UO.  I feel more sick<br/>
&gt; when thinking of logging into EQ than UO ;)<br/>

&gt; p/s: Garren shld have sold ya acct in eBay instead of just quit.   Who<br/>
&gt; know, with ya chars, you can earn some money to buy some new PC stuffs,<br/>
&gt; hehe.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;         Dued to my failure at PoF which got alot of ppl into trouble<br/>
&gt; &gt; (which<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; involved dying and losing the major portion of their stuff) and with<br/>
&gt; &gt; little<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; else to do (except like camping for stuff, which I have gotten very<br/>
&gt; sick<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tired of), I have cancelled my account as from today, Oct 26th 1999.<br/>
&gt; Zand,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; please give out the items to the people as I have listed down with<br/>
you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Especially Weadaenye, whom I&#39;m guilty as hell to got her into a living<br/>
&gt; &gt; hell.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;         Please help me tell the follow people of my quiting and hope<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; see<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them again sometime on another game another time and Best wishes to<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Demitry, Wlyven, Anima and Nismo/Volk (they are brothers sharing the<br/>
&gt;  same<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; account).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;         Everquest was, had been and enjoyable game at the beginning<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; &gt; due<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the way that the game is designed it reminds me more of Evercamp,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Everbitch etc etc. It has become a torture to enter the &quot;game&quot; each<br/>
day<br/>
&gt; &gt; now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This incident has at least freed me from Evercrack as some would say<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; is.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So farewell my fellow guildmates. And may your time in Everquest be as<br/>
&gt; &gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; first day, with new and exciting adventures each day.<br/>
