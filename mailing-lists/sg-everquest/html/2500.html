The following update was made to the In Development section of the official <br/>
EverQuest site:<br/>
In Development<br/>
The world of EverQuest is constantly evolving and the ability to patch and <br/>
update the game is one of the greatest strengths a massively multiplayer <br/>
game has. The following is a description of issues and functionality that <br/>
have changed since beta, or will be changed in the future - this also <br/>
includes planned new features and/or changes to existing features.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that the following information takes precedence over <br/>
information that may be included in the EverQuest manual, strategy guide, <br/>
and other official documents previously released.<br/>
<br/>
Please also note that changes or additions are targeted to be implemented <br/>
short term unless otherwise indicated, however there is no commitment to a <br/>
specific date.<br/>
<br/>

Future Development<br/>
------------------<br/>
<br/>
Zones<br/>
<br/>
Three new areas, tentatively titled, Temple of Solusek Ro, The Hole and <br/>
Paineel, will be accessable via the Toxxullia Forest on Erudin. The zones <br/>
will be free of charge and available via an optional patch. More <br/>
information regarding these new zones will be made available as their <br/>
release date nears.<br/>
<br/>
- The Temple of Solusek Ro should be on-line and available to our <br/>
customers, free of charge, by mid-October. A release date for The Hole and <br/>
Paineel has not been set.<br/>
<br/>
------------------<br/>
<br/>
General Issues<br/>
<br/>
Though a majority of the EverQuest development team&#39;s time has been <br/>
dedicated to the enhancement of current game play related features, such as <br/>
dungeon and class tuning and balancing, item/weapon implementation, and <br/>
spell functionality, we have been able to work on the following.<br/>
<br/>
- We are working to make it possible for players to manually organize <br/>
spells within their spell book.<br/>
- Level 35+ characters meditating automatically when they sit down - <br/>
without the spell book being brought up.<br/>
- When a player or NPC speaks in a langauge other than &quot;Common Tongue&quot;, <br/>
denoting the langauge being spoken (if their skill in that langauge is high <br/>
enough) proceeding the text.<br/>
- The ability for the user to manually adjust their clipping plane (the <br/>
point at which the 3D geometry is drawn in) on the fly via an in-game <br/>
slider bar to not only enhance performance, but to also allow the clipping <br/>
plane to be moved out much further than it is currently set to.<br/>
- Approximately 20+ new character animations to be mated with the /text <br/>
socials which were recently added last week.<br/>
- Allowing the ability for guilds to be at war with multiple guilds.<br/>
- Functionality is being added to allow Enchanters to enchant items.<br/>
- The ability to send messages to everyone in a players Friend&#39;s List whom <br/>
are currently on-line.<br/>
- Adding the option for players to not allow looting before a guild war is <br/>
initiated.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Spells<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please note that Beta was used for testing spells. Some spells did not make <br/>
the final cut for release. This is what Beta was used for - testing the <br/>
viability of spells and their impact upon game balance.<br/>
<br/>
Unless noted below, all spells work with their intended effects.<br/>
<br/>
------------------<br/>
<br/>
Scheduled Changes<br/>
<br/>
Detect Magic: This spell will be replaced with a new spell sometime in the <br/>
near future. All players who have purchased this spell will have it <br/>
automatically updated into their spell books.<br/>
