<div id="ygrps-yiv-258667275">Browse through my temp directory and found 1634 messages related to the<br/>
mailing list, 300+ which belongs to me.......<br/>
<br/>
WTF, did I really type out roughly 20% of the messages in this list???<br/>
<br/>
Now onto the website thing, I need a damn space to jump this 1600+<br/>
e-mails too. Temp directory getting freaky bloated up.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I need a place to post up the damn character sheet I have leh, Red<br/>
Dawn KKK(Kong Kah Kiao, ie. died) already izzt?<br/>
<br/>
The location of some items I&#39;m starting to forget liao, so all the item<br/>
locate I mention that is not on any site, please jot in down, in case I<br/>
need to refer to it again (I now like 100 year old orc, memory damn<br/>
terok)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I also have 100 screen shots in 5 folders, also need a damn<br/>
place to put them up. Included is one of the many &quot;giant wisp&quot; shots I<br/>
have.<br/>
