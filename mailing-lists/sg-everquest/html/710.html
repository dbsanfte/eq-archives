<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030211114">I do think the necromancer is more interesting than a magician. Although they get lesser pets, their various spells make up for it. For instance, at high levels, the necros get to trade hp for mana, and in doing so get to become skeletons. They also have feign death as well as dot spells AND dd spell and at crucial times, they are able to heal others at the expense of themselves.Magicians on the other hand do damage mostly thru their dd spells. however, mags are very self sufficient having spells that make stuff for their use and others and the good thing bout mags are that they are not evil unless you choose a DE mag.<br/>

    i do agree that LKW have some good ideas on how to beat those creatures... but i dont think they somehow benefit the low levels... even if they managed to level up fast... it may not be good unless they can increase their skills as fast at the same time... otherwise i think they will have a hard time at the later stages... which is even worse...<br/>
    i think the best thing one can do to help out a newbie is to provide him/ her with some basic armor n perhaps a weapon... since those r the real difficult to obtain stuff... n maybe help em buy spells :) well... this is just my point of view and i aint in the game yet.... oh well.... comments r welcome... these r just what i thought from all those reading... n also... im kinda flickle minded about a Necromancer or a Mage... since theres no clear cut bout em... but i think the mage has too many pets... n they aint they great as compared to the Dark Elf Necromancer... well... see how lah... when the time comes... ill decide... or maybe ill try playing both... and will decide at some stage...<br/>
