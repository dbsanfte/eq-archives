<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068821271">U can&#39;t hotkey Mediation. U can only access it in ur spellbook anyway.<br/>
One thing about melee skill ofr wiz, forget it. U can&#39;t do much with it at<br/>
later level, though it&#39;s better than nothing. heheh. There is no total skill<br/>
cpa like in UO but there is a maximum skill u can get at a lvl depending on<br/>
the skill and the class/race of ur character. eg, a lvl 1 druid can heal<br/>
much better than my lvl 9 paladin.<br/>
<br/>
    The trade skills are not meant for beginner players. U gotta to have<br/>
lots of cash to play around with, though tailoring is good for beginning<br/>
players (as like in UO, go figures. heheh).<br/>

&gt; Yo,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since no one has made an wizard amg our kakis, I&#39;ve decided to make one 2<br/>
&gt; days ago.  Now my wiz is lvl 3.  So far I&#39;ve spend my practice points on<br/>
2H<br/>
&gt; blunt, chanelling, adjure, evoke and alter.  I still have 10 points with<br/>
&gt; me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any suggestion what other skills to train?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure how the skills thingy work, if there is a total skill cap for<br/>
&gt; your char.  I wish to learn some  $$$ skills which do not required much<br/>
$$$<br/>
&gt; (eg on buying material, initial investment and l/t investment), any<br/>
&gt; suggestion?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So far I didnt spend any practice points in melee skills.  I started off<br/>
&gt; with a dagger and when I earn enuff $$$ to buy worn great stave, I keep on<br/>
&gt; using it.  The skills rise when I hunt with the staves.  I would also like<br/>
&gt; to seek advice if it&#39;s worth to train unarmed melee skills for wiz (like<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; monk).  If there is a total skill cap, I will try to specialize in 1 or 2<br/>
&gt; melee skills.  If not skill cap, I dun mind training unarmed combat skill<br/>
&gt; since after the newbie period, I wouldn&#39;t resurrect with a dagger, right?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any recommendation what spells are good for wiz?  Also, is there any way<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; make medation a hotkey? (sorry for those who reply me on my previous<br/>
&gt; mediation query, I need to ask again coz I dunno what u mean)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Btw, my wiz is a high-elf, name is Ziltus, after his long-lost brother<br/>
&gt; Zilred (enchanter) ;)<br/>
