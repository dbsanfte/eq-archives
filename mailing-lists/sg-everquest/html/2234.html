<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hi,Recently i am pissed with verant nerfing my pet and DOT, so i<br/>
&gt; decided to play another char for the time being. i created a Dark Elf<br/>
&gt; Wizard (yes dark elf again) on The Tribunal Server and he is now level<br/>
&gt; 10 (only 1 day and 19 hours to play - hehe).  Somethings i really got<br/>
&gt; to say. The lower levels for wizard is hard and necro is much easy<br/>
&gt; during those levels since root get resisted alot and wizards heavily<br/>
&gt; rely on tanks for support. However, wizard down its target real fast<br/>
&gt; after level 8. Imagine i kill dw snakes and wisp at level 9-10 when my<br/>
&gt; necro cant do that until level 12 then i stand half a chance.Another<br/>
&gt; thing, with my dark elf wizard being agnostic, i start with dubious to<br/>
&gt; most good people (yes include freeport) and i was told that the<br/>
&gt; faction can be improved to a extend that i can trade in freeport n use<br/>
&gt; the bank (BUT i dont its impossible in fay since elves really hate<br/>
&gt; dark elves). Also, i spoken to a few, alot of high level folks<br/>
&gt; restarting in this server - couple of level 40-50s. So far the highest<br/>
&gt; i have seen is level 21 by today!Thast all for now, will keep u guys<br/>
&gt; updated. hehee.. FreedDark Elf Wizard in his 10th evil years (The<br/>
&gt; Tribunal)p/s : anyone want to join me when you are bored? main reason<br/>
&gt; im here bcos Innoruuk is all screwed and at least it wont for this for<br/>
&gt; quite some<br/>
&gt; time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
