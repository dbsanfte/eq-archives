<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905207725">When is the daily server down time for Innoruuk?<br/>
<br/>
How long will it down normally?<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I finally reach lvl 12 last night with lots of help from Leshrec (for <br/>
bringing my hunting and let me getting all the loot for my scrolls), Garren <br/>
(for making a great hunting team and sacrifice himself in luring monsters <br/>
and also giving up his loots), Kenven (for tanking me many times), Trifrost <br/>
(for most of the buff spells I get during hunting) and guys. Lvl 12 means a <br/>
big deal to me as it open my knowledge to one of the most important spells <br/>
for wizard - bind aff.  If anyone need bind in Freeport, pls feel free to <br/>
give me a tell.  Most probably I will stay around FP until I get to lvl 16 <br/>
which I need to buy need spells.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I&#39;ve bought shock of lighting, bind & halo of light spells. <br/>
 Leshrec can advise what other impt scrolls I shld buy?  I&#39;m also looking <br/>
for a runed totem stave.  I&#39;ve got 15pp in bank right now.  If you guys <br/>
know any friend who is willing to sell at 25pp and below, pls let me know <br/>
(Leshrec got his at 20pp, very good buy).  Tonight I will con&#39;t to group <br/>
our local kakis for more xp and money, hahahahahaahh! ;-?  Thx alot guys!<br/>
<br/>
