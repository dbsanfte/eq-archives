&gt;If any kakis found an artifact which he dun bother to sell or none of his <br/>
&gt;chars can use it, he can pass to another kakis who can use it.  Say Garren <br/>
&gt;found a Thug robe which he or his other chars can&#39;t use, and he dun bother <br/>
&gt;to sell.  In the end he gave to Ziltus.  Later when Ziltus got a Goss robe, <br/>
&gt;he is NOT supposed to sell the Thug robe for his own benefit.  Instead, he <br/>
&gt;pass it to FF.  Now FF got a FBR, he will then pass the Thug robe to the <br/>
&gt;next kakis who can use it.  This way we can practice kakis heritage system <br/>
&gt;which will benefit more kakis.<br/>
