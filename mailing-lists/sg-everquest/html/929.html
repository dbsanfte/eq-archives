<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937729328">Just to inform all kakis abt our SBS hunt in CB.<br/>
<br/>
After killing more than 15 trainers, we only managed to get one SBS on the <br/>
13th trainer.  The SBS is given to Einan, our only local kakis cleric.  Due <br/>
to time constraint, we are unable to hunt for more.  Furthermore, becoz of <br/>
the anti camp thingy that was implemented, the spawning of SBS are even <br/>
more rare.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless I will con&#39;t to look for more SBS for local kakis like <br/>
Trifrost, Sereph and other tanks once I go back Faydark.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight is Friday night, as per usual I will be training at NRo derv camp <br/>
next to mountain till morning.  All kakis who wish to join me are most <br/>
welcome to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Ziltus.</div>
