u guys as soon as i can get.  from then, i will not be doing anything (no <br/>
more camping since i wasted many fucking hours camping for the jboots and <br/>
no gain except for a dagger - better than nothing i guess since the dagger <br/>
is said to be more rare) BUT power leveling. I will get to level 30 asap or <br/>
even more and will not be stopping until i am happy with my level. It seems <br/>
to be that when u have the level, camping any shit will be easy and you <br/>
dont have to rely on anyones help.<br/>
<br/>
This is VERY true, once u got the lvl, u can start hunting for stuffs.  See <br/>
I&#39;m still wearing my lvl 16 armor mainly?  See I undergo the power training <br/>
in Lake Rathetear for the past weeks - I mixed so often with aviak guards <br/>
tat pple start calling me birdman, hehe.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; some stuff bout the guild charter.<br/>
&gt; 1. when a SOS (not to be abused) is being sent (e.g., such that a person <br/>
 </span></blockquote>died in a terrible spot and impossible to get back, then everyone is online <br/>
and is capable MUST BE there to help irregardless of what dman thing u r <br/>
doing).<br/>
<br/>
I hate to say this but i think the SOS WILL be abused.  No way to avoid. <br/>
 See too many abused case in UO and it will be the same in EQ (from the <br/>
newbies&#39; shouts every now and then).  I&#39;m totally against such SOS rescue <br/>
where everyone online has to help regardless what u r doing. Imagine I can <br/>
get up to 10 msg asking for party gate within 30 min I login (some even <br/>
tell me &quot;ah finally wait till u login&quot;, LOL), no way I gonna response to <br/>
every SOS msg.  One of the most hated msg I get from UO is some newbie <br/>
members SOS msg tat pop up on my screen every now and then.  This is esp <br/>
worse in EQ when traveling is time-consuming, even with teleport spell we <br/>
also need time to run and find the corpse.  In UO, once I noticed any <br/>
member abusing this aid, I will let other veteran members know so as to let <br/>
them stay in dungeon as a ghost or learn to walk back to town and get <br/>
resurrection ;)<br/>
<br/>
I personally proposed those within the zone offer their help if only they <br/>
can help (eg was buying, selling or solo random hunting).  Imagine if I <br/>
kill 24 orc trainer (5-6 hr waiting) in a row and I know SBS will spawn in <br/>
the next 2-3 spawn, I would think it will be better for the member to spend <br/>
5-30 min searching his corpse instead.  Sometime it is more practice and <br/>
effective to seek help from the zone rather than waiting for own member to <br/>
do it.  Eg 2 nights ago, I need someone to help in transferring stuffs from <br/>
Zil to my new char, I start with guildsay, no response.  I msg few kakis, <br/>
some no response, some response saying they r few zones away hunting, I <br/>
also didnt expect them to run all the way to help me, coz I think it&#39;s <br/>
kinda impractical for them to do so.  In the end when I was abt to find a <br/>
quiet place drop the item and login my new char to get it, I got msg from <br/>
FF who is coming to GF for some camping and offer his help.  I&#39;m not trying <br/>
to blame anyone but in such situation, I think it&#39;s perfectly alright to <br/>
solve the problem by myself, in the sense of efficiency and effectiveness. <br/>
 We all start as a newbie w/o helps, we learn thing the hard way.  As in <br/>
UO, every hunting trips as a newbie, I walk with my kakis from town to <br/>
dungeon, back to town b4 the last save.  When we all reach tank-mage stage <br/>
and we start helping newbie members to mark rune, to gate them here and <br/>
there.  So much so tat in the end they dun even know how to walk from <br/>
dungeon to town if they get killed as a lvl 8 caster and no member online <br/>
;)  Just to share my personal experience.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2. i also suggest someone to be in-charge of hunts and stuff (one of the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>officers, thats i propose Ziltus and one other person).<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, gotta turn down this job abt hunting and stuffs.  I dun mind doing <br/>
some recruiting job, PROVIDED I am available to do the recruiting, since <br/>
wiz has the advantage of travelling spells.  H/w, UO event organiser is <br/>
enuff for me.  During my time as a GM, I hold more events than the total <br/>
events organised by the rest of the guild.  Now for EQ, I dun mind doing <br/>
part-time, esp during this transition period when QHD dun have much <br/>
activities, but I guess I wont wanna be the official person in charge, heh, <br/>
thx for the nomination tho&#39; ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3. As for banking and equipment, i propsed those 2 person, instead of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>using their banks, get them to create a char just for the purpose of <br/>
banking. So it will be easier for them to keep track of money and stuff and <br/>
those money is not to be abused. We can have a store of items and LOAN them <br/>
to members in the guild (e.g., RTS and other stuff), when these members are <br/>
capable of geting one, they will return it or pass it to another member <br/>
requiring it.<br/>
<br/>
Loaning items is abit difficult in EQ, due to:<br/>
- Not easy to meet to borrow and return stuffs.<br/>
- Loading a char in EQ can be quite time consuming, unlike UO.  So if the <br/>
person in charge need to logout and relogin the storeman char, it will post <br/>
some kinda inconveniences for the player.  Due to the limited items slot in <br/>
EQ (unlike UO where only wt limit), it&#39;s not easy to keep stuffs too, esp <br/>
lore item like RTS, u can only keep 1 per char.  I think it will be more <br/>
effective for higher lvl to help lower lvl to get some cool items once in a <br/>
while, and provided the lower lvl can physically participate the hunting <br/>
(and not turning it to a corpse looting session).  Of coz, for those lower <br/>
lvl, dun expect to get something more than 5 lvls than u la.  If a lvl 1 <br/>
wanna get JBoot, I think even if u got a lvl 50 wiz with u, it&#39;s also <br/>
difficult for him to even bring u to see Najena.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; NOTE: i have a slightly crazy idea bout something. Instead of creating <br/>
 </span></blockquote>one guild, we will form 2 guilds. one for lower levels, one higher. All our <br/>
low level chars will form one and high level another. maybe level 1-20 one <br/>
guild, 20 upwards another (or maybe even make it level 30). This way, we <br/>
can recruit newbies and train them the way of our guild. if our guild is <br/>
active all the time and is nice to all of the folks, i dont believe there <br/>
is any reason for them to quit the guild. That will continue to point 4.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, pardon me, I dun see the need to create 2 guilds, since we dun have to <br/>
start a warfare sub-division like in UO for guild war (to protect those <br/>
non-war chars).  Actually it shld be alright to have all lvl in the guild. <br/>
 Plus the fact tat with our own kakis, we dun have to hide where we r <br/>
hunting.  As long as u got the lvl requirement for hunt, u are most welcome <br/>
to join us (which mean we must have strict recruitment to get only those <br/>
trust-worthy and loyal kakis la).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4. We will help lower levels folks to break spwan and stuff BUT it doesnt <br/>
 </span></blockquote>mean helping them to kill all the stuff and let them loot for many many <br/>
hours. Crap stuff like RTS i say it doesnt hurt to let most members have, <br/>
BUT if we are talking bout FBRs or more useful items as we gain more power, <br/>
then that we must state a certain level or unless they can get it <br/>
themselves (usually this is a few levels b4 they can get it themselves).<br/>
<br/>
Tat&#39;s why I organise the RTS hunt and limit the hunt to those above lvl 12 <br/>
 ;)  Problem is, in order to prevent camping, EQ is patched anti-camp. <br/>
 During the last trip, we camp for 2 hrs or so (?) and not even a RTS or <br/>
skull.  YY mentioned webclaw spaw at 10 min interval, which sound very <br/>
tempting for me to get it, hehe.  Kellendil also got a WCS liao, maybe u <br/>
can share with us how u got it (how u kill it, melee, nuke or wat), where <br/>
(which part of Lake)?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5. i have also by chance came to talk to the guildmaster of Disciples of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Discord. All members are red (PvP). So if any members decided to be funny  <br/>
 with the guild or spoil the reputation of the guild then they will be <br/>
hunted down for the rest of their fucking EQ lives That i believe is <br/>
somewhat good protection, but it requires members to be PvP and ourselves <br/>
to be also which is a bad thing or good thing. IF ANY MEMBERS CREATE <br/>
TROUBLE FOR THE GUILD, THEY ARE BANNED FROM THE GUILD. NOT REMOVED.so they <br/>
wont have their other chars pretend and join our guild again and get to <br/>
cheat the guild and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My stand is to remain non-PvP, even until I reach lvl 50 ;)  Personally I <br/>
dun really enjoy PvP all time, but some duels here and there shld be ok ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 6. we certainly dont want war with other guilds. if we dont steal kills <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and stuff i dont forsee a guildwar happening.<br/>
<br/>
Too many stealers in EQ, and so far I havent heard any war starts due to <br/>
kill stealing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 7. Make it unique, maybe someone that wants to be officer or elder or <br/>
 </span></blockquote>watever u call that, he must be highly nominated by 2/3 of the elder/ <br/>
officer council OR he can gain it by challenging one to a duel and WIN IT. <br/>
=) some pvp action. if the guild gets large enough, we can have some sort <br/>
of arena fights n stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, lvls or PvP capablity shldnt be the factor used to determine officer <br/>
post.  No use asking a lvl 50 wiz who win the duel for the position, go ard <br/>
making havoc and spoil guild reputation until we dismiss him - damange <br/>
already  done to our reputation.  Instead, leadership, commitment, loyalty <br/>
and contribution shld be looked into when determining the officer <br/>
candidates.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 8. ok i said enough, now bloody feedback for all i have said...<br/>
&gt; p/s: cant imagine i went on a camping trip and gain one level =) and also <br/>
 </span></blockquote>found some true friends and jerks...<br/>
<br/>
Just like tax and death in RL, you see friends and jerks everywhere in EQ <br/>
