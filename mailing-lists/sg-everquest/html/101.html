<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837819263"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Heh, actually other magery class r much better than enchanters when they <br/>
&gt; reach high lvl.  I think enchanter as not as powerful as their magic <br/>
&gt; counterparts but I dun care.  I might not even last to reach lvl 20 (due to <br/>
&gt; motion sickness), so meanwhile just RP someone I like ;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Y&#39;know, besides cleric, enchanters are one of the best classes to <br/>
help people... that&#39;s why I chose to be enchanter. It just seems to <br/>
fit the character profile I want to play...<br/>

mingle with the &quot;lower&quot; races because he&#39;s seen what pride and <br/>
racism can lead to...<br/>
