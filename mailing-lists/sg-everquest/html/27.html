<div id="ygrps-yiv-88015254">Kudos to you. You must be good at handling people. If you come over to<br/>
Innoruuk where Gary, YinYang and I are, might stick around with you<br/>
&lt;smiles&gt;. Regarding the info about the game, I&#39;d do another post.<br/>

&gt; Actually I feel that locals playing together is pretty good enuf, not<br/>
&gt; necessary to form an official guild.  My UO guild started off with only<br/>
4-5<br/>
&gt; locals, purely for the sake of helping one another, play together rather<br/>
&gt; than to form an formal guild.  I also can&#39;t remember since when more and<br/>
&gt; more players seek to join us ;)  Most importantly, no matter we role-play<br/>
&gt; as good or evil, dun &#39;seah shui&#39; S&#39;poreans&#39; faces, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My suggestion is the existing players can post more info abt the game,<br/>
&gt; particularly the game play performance in each shard.  I bet most of the<br/>
&gt; local players are still in a stage of below lvl 20, and it&#39;s still not too<br/>
&gt; difficult for all to shift to the best shard to play in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m now waiting for my copy of EQ, and sincerely appreciate all in-game<br/>
&gt; info posted by local players ;)  I personally look for a lag-free server<br/>
&gt; with good server down time close to our timezone, so that I dun have to<br/>
&gt; come back home from work just to wait for server to come up *grin*.<br/>
