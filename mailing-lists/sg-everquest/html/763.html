<b>Subject:</b> Killing Mili Guard in Freeport <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-637845699">I understand some players are killing the Mili guard in Freeport bank for <br/>
xp and stuff.  Can I know what&#39;s the implication after killing them?  When <br/>
does the impact start to appear - after killing 1, 5, 10 or more than 10 <br/>
guards?  Mili guard are weaker then the other guards.  If u become KOS, is <br/>
there any place u will have difficulty in entering, even when u are high <br/>
lvl like lvl 20?<br/>
