 Can rise fishing skill by merely fishing at pier?  How u know ya skill max<br/>
 out?  How can u make $ via fishing?  Do u really catch fishes and sell?<br/>
&gt;&gt;A pole costs 20 silver. Each fish sold is 2 silver. That makes it that you<br/>
have to sell 10 fishes to get back your cost price. You will be losing money<br/>
within the first 25 skill pt range. After that, I made 1 plat an hour. Small<br/>
money but nice talking to all those elf babes &lt;drools&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So far I cannot buy decent food/drink. I buy those grapes and wines and in<br/>
the<br/>
 end dunno how to consume them ;(<br/>
&gt;&gt;Leave those grapes and wines alone. If I am right, you cannot drink from<br/>
bottle, with exception of milk. Stick to Muffins and Milk! Best Value for<br/>
money! Also, those muffins weight only 0.1 wt! Super light!<br/>
<br/>
Now I just bought a old great stave.  Better than my dagger.  Can I max out<br/>
my 2H blunt skill by using the stave to hunt all time, w/o using up<br/>
 practising point on it?<br/>
&gt;&gt;From the 1pt to 20pt range of gaining skill is always damn slow.<br/>
Senseheading for example, I can sit down and watch friends and keep tabbing<br/>
on it but only increase to &lt;3&gt;! After 20, it will go up steady! Now to<br/>
answer your question, YES.<br/>
<br/>
When I rise a lvl, I use the points on some skills<br/>
 but yet it remain awkful, why?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Put only 1 practise point in every new skill you acquire.<br/>
<br/>
Now I use my skill points on those skills<br/>
 with the coin symbols - chanelling and alteration, is it ok?<br/>
&gt;&gt;When a coin symbol appears, that means your skill is at 20 or above and<br/>
you have to pay to train.<br/>
