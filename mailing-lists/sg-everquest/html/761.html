<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435998029">Come to freeport, I will provided u with full clothes armor & stave, plus <br/>
binding somemore ;)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, as a DE, I suggest u train in 2H blunt weap (ie 2H stave), since u dun <br/>
need an extra hand to carry lantern and stuffs.  Also dun bother to spend <br/>
any points on ya magery skills, they are already available on ya personal <br/>
skill list.  Also dun spend any points on piercing (ie dagger) skill.  The <br/>
only time u need to spend ya skill points is when u get a worn great stave. <br/>
 Spend just 1 point on 2H blunt and keep the rest for future.  I was conned <br/>
by the net stating that we need to spend a point in magery skills, which I <br/>
tested to prove it wrong using my gnome wiz.  We dun have to train in it, <br/>
just keep casting in town will do.  Most impt thing is once u start ya <br/>
char, train ya magery skills to lvl ceiling, u will automatically get <br/>
improvement on these skills.  Do the lvl ceiling training everytime u gain <br/>
a lvl.  For magery classes, our lvl ceiling is (lvl+1)X5.  Eg lvl 1 ceiling <br/>
is skill 10, lvl 2 is skill 15 etc.  For melee our lvl ceiling is <br/>
(lvl+1)X3.  During lvl 1-4, it doesnt matter if ya piercing skill is zero, <br/>
u can gain lvl easily - just endure until u can get a 2H stave and start <br/>
training it.  Once u reach lvl 4, spend another skill point on mediation. <br/>
 The rest dun bother - keep the skill points until u wanna learn a trade <br/>
skills or special magery skill like research or specialization.<br/>
<br/>
Remember Dragco from our UO allies TAA?  Tat chap get his lvl 11 wiz in <br/>
just a week in other server, so hard to pull him over to innoruuk now ;(<br/>

p/s: Maybe I also start a DE char with u and test play it, provided I got <br/>
time ;)<br/>
