Just an update of Sereph&#39;s Brewing Guide.<br/>
<br/>
1. 1 x Mend requires 1 hops, 1 malt (not barley), 1 yeast, 1 cask<br/>
2. ? x Short beer requires 1 barley, 1 hops, 1 malt, 1 cask<br/>
3. 3 x Short ale requires 1 barley, 1 hops, 1 flast of water, 1 cask<br/>
4. ? x Ogre Swill requires 1 froglok meat, 1 malt, 1 yeast, 1 cask<br/>
5. 5 x Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew requires 1 Yeast, 1 hops, 1 Barley, 1 Malt, <br/>
1 Cask<br/>
<br/>
All ingredients (1s7c) except froglok meat and cask can be found on the <br/>
female npc merchant near West FP zone to North FP.  Cask can be found <br/>
inside tavern (outside bank at North FP) at 3s5c.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestion is to buy at least 20-40 sets of ingredient before you start <br/>
making brews.  This will reduce the zoning time used up in buying <br/>
ingredients (West and North FP).  H/w, Sereph mentioned a brew barrel in <br/>
West FP, maybe that&#39;s better in reducing traveling time.  Purchasing time <br/>
can also be reduced if you have packpack on you, they are sold at the Monk <br/>
Guild at 6g4s<br/>
<br/>
Based on further experiment last night, seem like we can improve the <br/>
training by abit:<br/>
Skill 0-40:<br/>
Make mend. Buy 40 sets of ingredients.<br/>
DO NOT spend any skill points on brewing if it&#39;s already in your skill list <br/>
(under Persona Screen).  Just buy the ingredient and start making, your <br/>
skill will rise to 1.  Seem like for low skill lvl, you skill rise by one <br/>
everytime you make a mend, whether sucess or fail.<br/>
Skill 40-65<br/>
Make short ale, Buy 40 sets of ingredient<br/>
Skill 66-max<br/>
Make Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew.  Buy 80 sets of ingredients.<br/>
Max skill for me is 135 instead of Sereph&#39;s 138.  Seem like the cap is not <br/>
fixed between 135 and 138.  Maybe race and class play a part here.<br/>
<br/>
Once max, continue making Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew.  The profit may not be <br/>
attractive for high lvl players but it&#39;s definitely good money for low lvl <br/>
players, esp newbies.  The max initially investment of 10pp should be more <br/>
than enough to max out skill in 2-3 hrs.  I think rather than giving basic <br/>
stuffs to newbie kakis, teaching them this skill and contribute 5-8 pp for <br/>
their training shld be more than enough to get them to stand on their own <br/>
feet.<br/>
<br/>
Million thx to Sereph for sharing his precious trade skill power-training <br/>
info with us ;)<br/>
