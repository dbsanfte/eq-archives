<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-264534285">This quest spreads all over Norrath, so be prepared to do some traveling. A<br/>
Bartendor in Ogguk by the name of Clurg can be found in the Bar near the<br/>
bank. Clurg has lost his Bartenders Compendium. The Bartenders Compendium is<br/>
currently in the hands of a Bartender in East Freeport, by the name of<br/>
Gregor. (his bar is right next to the docks). Gregor is trying to make a<br/>
special drink of some kind that he has found in the Bartenders Compendium,<br/>
but he is missing the ingredients. The ingredients he needs are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
1) &quot;Kiola Nut&quot; from the island of Erollisi<br/>
2) &quot;Erud&#39;s Tonic&quot; from Erudian<br/>
3) &quot;Honey Jum&quot; from Rivervale<br/>
4) &quot;Koalindl Fish&quot; from the lake in the Temple of Life in Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
Return these items to Gregor in East Freeport and he will give you the<br/>
Bartender&#39;s Compendium. Take the Compendium to Clurg and he will give you<br/>
the Glowing Stein for your troubles. Now for the step by step process.<br/>
<br/>
1) Create a new character, preferably an erudian enchanter.. they have good<br/>
faction and get a pet right off the bat.<br/>
<br/>
2) Twink this guy with about 20pp.<br/>
<br/>
3) Have him purchase his first lvl pet spell, 10 tiny daggers, and a<br/>
backpack.<br/>
<br/>
4) Have him go to the Blue Hawk&#39;s Inn in Erudin and buy an Innoruk&#39;s Kiss of<br/>
Death (LORE ITEM) from Geord BlueHawk. Take the Kiss of Death to Sinnkin<br/>
Highbrow at the top of the Library in Erudin, and she will give you Erud&#39;s<br/>
Tonic.<br/>
<br/>
5) Take him back to the bank and put everything you own in there, except<br/>
your dagger your food and your tiny daggers... you don&#39;t want to carry<br/>
anything because you can die very easily during your travels and getting<br/>
your corpse back is a serious pain.<br/>
<br/>
6) Take the boat to Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
7) Get a bind just outside the front gates to Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
8) Head back into Qeynos and find the Temple of Life, in North Qeynos.. this<br/>
is the building that looks like a space ship hovering over a pond.<br/>
<br/>
9) Summon your pet and jump in the pond.<br/>
<br/>
10) There&#39;s lots of the Koalindl fish swimming around, so take one out.. if<br/>
you die.. no biggie, come back and try again.<br/>
<br/>
11) When you&#39;ve killed it, you&#39;ll take a HUGE faction hit.. so loot his<br/>
corpse and get a Koalindl fish (LORE ITEM).<br/>
<br/>
12) NOW RUN!! make a break for the Qeynos Gates.. The guards will most<br/>
likely kill you on your way.<br/>
<br/>
13) Well you probably died.. but hopefully you ran fast enough to get at<br/>
least a bit away from that pond.<br/>
<br/>
14) Go back and pick your corpse for the Koalindl fish, and the rest of your<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
15) Head back to the bank and drop EVERYTHING, you&#39;re in for a very long<br/>
trip. Unless you have a friendly wizard friend *wink wink* that can help you<br/>
at this point.<br/>
<br/>
16) Make your way to Rivervale.. The way I did this is I traveled from<br/>
Qeynos to Qeynos hills, to West Karanas, to North Karanas, to Beholder, to<br/>
Runnyeye, to Misty Thicket, to Rivervale.. to get through Runnyeye, just hug<br/>
the left wall and sprint like mad.. it should only take you 5 seconds to<br/>
reach the zone to Misty Thicket. From Misty Thicket to Rivervale, just hug<br/>
the right wall, be carefull not to get killed by the orcs.. there will be a<br/>
big wall in the middle of the zone with a gate in the center.. if you can<br/>
get to this gate, you just follow the path in front of you straight to the<br/>
hole on the East side of the zone.. that&#39;s Rivervale.<br/>
<br/>
17) When you get here, get a bind as soon as possible, and pick up about<br/>
7pp. If this wasn&#39;t your first time making this trip at such a low lvl, then<br/>
you understand why. If not then you will by this point.<br/>
<br/>
18) Go back out to Misty thicket and turn left, hugging the wall. You&#39;ll<br/>
come across a small hut, where a male and a female halfling are. The womans<br/>
name is Lil Honeybugger.. she&#39;ll tell you about a girl named Mintopp(sp?)<br/>
who has a honey jum recipe, but she needs Honeycomb to make it.<br/>
<br/>
19) Exit this little hut, and go North.. the North side of Misty thicket is<br/>
covered with Honey combs.. and you should be able to find some.. of course<br/>
your pretty low lvl at this time and it can be quite a pain.. so just<br/>
auction offering 1pp for 3 honeycombs.. that will get you a response real<br/>
fast.<br/>
<br/>
20) After you get the honeycombs head back to Rivervale. Take your<br/>
honeycombs to the Herb Jar.. (the herb jar is a store located right next to<br/>
the Fools gold, a circular bar right next to the bank.. the herb jar is not<br/>
labeled, so you have to look around a bit. The owner of the Herb jar is a<br/>
halfling woman by the name of Mintopp(sp?).<br/>
<br/>
21) Give the three Honeycombs and 5gp to Mintopp and she will give you the<br/>
Honey Jum.<br/>
<br/>
22) Go back to the bank and drop off your cash, and the Honey Jum, and<br/>
anything else you have on you.<br/>
<br/>
23) Exit Rivervale, don&#39;t go through the exit back to Misty Thicket, this<br/>
time find the exit to Kithikor Forest.<br/>
<br/>
24) Take Kithikor forest to West commons, to East Commons, to Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
25) Go to the bank and pick up some cash.. a couple plat will do it I think,<br/>
but bring what you have, because you have to take the boat next and you want<br/>
to do that only once.<br/>
<br/>
26) Go the boat doc&#39;s in East Freeport and catch the boat to Faydwer.. but<br/>
get off the boat on the first stop you make in Ocean of Tears. This is the<br/>
Island of Errolsi.<br/>
<br/>
27) Immediately in front of the docks is a group of huts. Go to the one that<br/>
is right in front of the docs and there should be a elven woman behind a<br/>
bar, she will sell you the Kiola nut.<br/>
<br/>
28) If your quick, you can buy the nut and still make it back to the boat<br/>
before it leaves.. if not wait for the boat to come back.<br/>
<br/>
29) Stay on the boat until you get back to Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
30) Go back to the bank and put all 4 items you&#39;ve obtained into your<br/>
backpack, and drop all your other stuff off.<br/>
<br/>
31) Here&#39;s where it gets difficult :-) If you like, you could take this<br/>
enchanter all the way to lvl 12 I believe, and do this part yourself.. but<br/>
since that would take forever, especially since you&#39;ll probably destroy him<br/>
when your done... don&#39;t bother.<br/>
<br/>
32) Find an Enchanter that you can trust.. now this Enchanter must have a<br/>
few things... he must be good, or have an illusion spell to look like he&#39;s<br/>
good.. he must have the Alliance spell, and he must be evil or have and<br/>
Illusion spell to look like he&#39;s evil. I had a Dark Elf do this who was lvl<br/>
16 or so and it worked just fine. Having a Good race do it would be a little<br/>
more difficult but it would work. But remember... You HAVE TO TRUST THIS<br/>
PERSON! He will be the one with your Glowing Stein in the end and you do<br/>
want him to give it to you.<br/>
<br/>
33) Now... Have this Enchanter meet your Erudite at the docks in Freeport..<br/>
if your Enchanter is evil, he can enter Freeport from North Ro and follow<br/>
the wall, go through the hidden entrance, hug the left wall until he sees<br/>
two people standing in the tunnel, go up the stairs (not through the door<br/>
where the people are standing) go through the door on the right, run up<br/>
those stairs to the top, go throught the hidden exit at the top of these<br/>
stairs, go around the barrels up another set of stairs, around the corner<br/>
and through the door.. from there he should be able to see the docks.<br/>
<br/>
34) Give your Enchanter friend the backpack with the goodies.<br/>
<br/>
35) The Enchanter should cast Illusion Human on himself (unless he is a good<br/>
race) and enter the bar where Gregor is, your Erudite should sit back and<br/>
wait.<br/>
<br/>
36) Inside, the Enchanter will see a ragtag group of warriors all decked out<br/>
in full plate.. if the Enchanter is evil, he needs to do this next step<br/>
correctly or those plate wearing guys will kick his arse.<br/>
<br/>
37) Have the Enchanter cast Alliance on the bartender.<br/>
<br/>
38) Then have him give the bartender all 4 of the item&#39;s you&#39;ve gained.<br/>
<br/>
39) The bartender will give him the Bartender&#39;s Compendium (LORE ITEM, NO<br/>
DROP) if it was done successfully... if he was evil and did it incorrectly,<br/>
then the plate people will run around the bar and mop the floor with him..<br/>
these plate guys are all VERY HIGH LVL! They con red to me at 34.. and I saw<br/>
a group of 40&#39;s getting run out of the bar when they tried to do this quest<br/>
wrong.<br/>
<br/>
40) OK, now you have the book.. Log off and destroy that Erudian, you<br/>
probably hate him by now, and get the character you want to have the stein.<br/>
<br/>
41) Have the Enchanter meet you in Feerott, trust me.. don&#39;t gate to Cazic<br/>
Thule for this part.. it&#39;s not a good idea.. instead you should walk, or if<br/>
your reading this ahead of time, both of you should bind yourselves near<br/>
Feerott ahead of time.<br/>
<br/>
42) Have the Enchanter enter, If your evil then you can go with him..<br/>
otherwise, wait for him to come back.<br/>
<br/>
43) Have the Enchanter go to the bar near the bank.. If he&#39;s a good<br/>
alignment then he should cast Illusion Dark Elf on himself... there he will<br/>
find Clurg.<br/>
<br/>
44) Have the Enchanter cast Alliance on Clurg and then give Clurg the<br/>
Bartender&#39;s Compendium.<br/>
<br/>
45) If done correctly he will receive your glowing stein (LORE ITEM) Now<br/>
convince the enchanter to give you the stein and it&#39;s all yours!<br/>

&gt; Since it&#39;s a throwaway char, I will make a human wiz (always wanna test<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; fast a human can lvl up).  Based on my gnome wiz and woodelf druid<br/>
&gt; experience, one can hit lvl 4 easily in one night training of 3-4hrs at<br/>
&gt; most.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So where are we having this newbies bashing?  How abt this coming Mon?<br/>
&gt;  Everyone make a human char in Qeynos and start hunting fishes?<br/>
&gt;  Hahahahahah ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Seem like we have lots of intereting activities, hehe.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have just read on EQ Enchanters that the Koalindl fish corpse is<br/>
&gt; &gt; now a NODROP item on the test servers!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This means that anyone who wants to complete the quest MUST<br/>
&gt; &gt; take the major faction hits that come with killing the fish! Now that<br/>
&gt; &gt; it is NODROP, no more mule character to take faction hits then<br/>
&gt; &gt; transfer to your main character...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A bit of back ground about the fish... when you kill it, Qeynos<br/>
&gt; &gt; Inhabitants, Barbarians, even RODCET NIFE himself, not just his<br/>
&gt; &gt; clerics, drop faction with you, and because the corpse doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; always load, this means that you might have to kill it several times,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and will quickly become KOS to these factions. (Maybe Rodcet will<br/>
&gt; &gt; throw down lightning bolt to strike thee down? *heh*)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, we had better start camping for that fucking fish with our group<br/>
&gt; &gt; of level 3 mules (fish is level 2 to 3) before they implement the<br/>
&gt; &gt; change on the actual servers! Don&#39;t care when you want to do the<br/>
&gt; &gt; quest, just fucking snatch as many fish corpse from under the<br/>
&gt; &gt; nose of Rodcet first!!!! That is the HARDEST part of the quest!!! We<br/>
&gt; &gt; better get our asses moving before the next patch comes along!!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; KNN!!!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unless, of course, you all dowan this 7/43 1H blunt wpn that gives<br/>
&gt; &gt; +10INT +5DEX... blah blah that is the Stein of Moggok...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I suggest this... we all create throwaway characters in Qeynos,<br/>
&gt; &gt; level them up to 3 or so, and we group to smack fishes. It should<br/>
&gt; &gt; be fun too, imagine a horde of level 1 &quot;newbies&quot; swarming Qeynos<br/>
&gt; &gt; hunting grounds...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This group must be well planned, however, with a proper mix of<br/>
&gt; &gt; classes to optimise our abilities... and if possible, make all human,<br/>
&gt; &gt; level up faster...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; --<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Love is in the air...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Get me a gas mask, quick!!!<br/>
