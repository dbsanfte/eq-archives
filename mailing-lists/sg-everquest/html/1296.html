<b>Subject:</b> My 2 cents in magery specialization & Report on Permafrost <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-462337238">I dump 1 point each on evoke, adjure, conjure, alter and divin.  Initially <br/>
I didnt specifically train them until I heard from some players tat the <br/>
benefits (faster casting time and less failure) only start come in when ya <br/>
skill reach 50.  So I spend one afternoon casting the lowest lvl evoke <br/>
spell on myself, med, cast, med, cast....until I reach 50 (very boring). <br/>
 Then I leave it alone.  Some players said once a particular skill reach <br/>
50, it means it will be your primary specialization, dunno how true it is <br/>
coz the other 4 spec con&#39;t to rise even my evoke is already above 50.  The <br/>
lvl ceiling still apply I guess. so probably I will spend another night <br/>
trying to max evoke spec out.<br/>
