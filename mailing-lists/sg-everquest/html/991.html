<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-872357139">My suggestions on buying spell. Usually, unless i have money to burn, I just<br/>
buy the required spells. For me its usually 3 spells per spell circle since<br/>
most of the other spells are useless. I only buy the rest of the spells when<br/>
I&#39;m a circle higher since I like to have a full spellbook ) I don&#39;t really<br/>
know about magicians since I never played one, but I think a DD spell and a<br/>
Water E summoning spell at each circle would be best if yer trying to<br/>
economise since u never know when a person is gonna sell a much needed armor<br/>
piece or weapon. Of course, maybe there are other spells a magician need,<br/>
but as I said I don&#39;t know. As for trade, once you get to about level 20, I<br/>
think its much more profitable to do dungeons such as Unrest. Each mob there<br/>
holds 1pp so in a group of 6, getting 20 pp is no problem within about 1-2<br/>
hours since lotsa mobs there.. Of course trade skills like blacksmithy<br/>
surely gonna be damn profitable in long run since can make a few hundred pp<br/>
in an hour, but thats gonna be a long time before you can start attempting<br/>
on it (heard cost price very high).<br/>

&gt;Hey Ziltus,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wah lau, don&#39;t make it sound like we&#39;re begging for money leh.<br/>
&gt;I know I complained i&#39;m broke but i didn&#39;t say I wanted you guys<br/>
&gt;to give me any :P Donations are always accepted lah of course<br/>
&gt;but the key thing, i believe, is that I don&#39;t go around hoping for them<br/>
&gt;or asking you guys for any.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s just that i spent 3 whole nights making 40+ pp from hunting? And i<br/>
&gt;spent<br/>
&gt;them all on my lvl8 spells which cost 3pp 9gp 8scp per spell.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m almost lvl 11 and i&#39;m just thinking at this rate...when i hit lvl 12<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;buy those  new spells at 5-6pp each...i need at least another 60pp?? Wah..<br/>
&gt;siong man<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I did hear of the brewing thing...just that when first heard of it...was<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;very<br/>
&gt;sure of the details...but i guess now i probably would try.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One more thing is that in my area where i&#39;ve been hunting of late...you get<br/>
&gt;better exp<br/>
&gt;but only shitty bones for loot. (Mummies, skeletons,chessboard Skel Pawns,<br/>
&gt;etc...)<br/>
&gt;So i had to choose between levelling and making money. I chose levelling<br/>
 </span></blockquote>cos<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;i want to hit lvl 12 faster...the bind affinity spell i thought can use to<br/>
&gt;make some money!<br/>
&gt;Alot of ppl are willing to pay 1pp at least for a bind somewhere. Best<br/>
&gt;man...if got 20 ppl<br/>
&gt;in one night...20pp liaoz...LOL Don&#39;t think so easy lah hehe Besides I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;only do that when<br/>
&gt;i&#39;m short on cash (which is most of the time). I prefer to do for free<br/>
&gt;actually. Nice guy here :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok that&#39;s it for me...off to work (late again hiaks)<br/>

&gt;&gt; Jus a thought.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Everyone start off been very poor, and even at lvl 18, I&#39;m still very<br/>
&gt;poor,<br/>
&gt;&gt; unlike our rich man Garren, hehe.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; We guys gotta learn to stand on our feet sometime.  I think brewing is a<br/>
&gt;&gt; very useful trade skill which can easily fulfill ya financial needs, just<br/>
&gt;&gt; that it&#39;s kinda boring and take times.  Nevertheless comparing with<br/>
&gt;&gt; hunting, brewing still give me better and faster return than hunting so<br/>
&gt;&gt; far.  If we can spend 1-3 hrs a day brewing, I dun see why the new chaps<br/>
&gt;&gt; cant do the same ;)  No doubt we try to help by sponsoring abit, but u<br/>
&gt;guys<br/>
&gt;&gt; have to help us to help yaself sometimes ;)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; One thing for sure, we the local kakis always keep items which we think<br/>
&gt;&gt; other kakis can used (eg I keep cutt ring for newbies, ring mails for<br/>
&gt;&gt; tanks, garren keep thu robe for me, les keep woven for me etc).  We will<br/>
&gt;&gt; try to help as and when we can, but one must understand the fact tat<br/>
&gt;&gt; utimately u r the one playing the game and handling ya own char, hehe.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; IMHO, brewing can make some quick buck.  At lvl 10 u shld be able to save<br/>
&gt;&gt; up to 10pp.  Of coz I know pple will use them to buy stuffs like<br/>
&gt;&gt; weap/armor/scrolls.  But just ponder - if u spend it on brewing, u can<br/>
&gt;earn<br/>
&gt;&gt; even more to buys stuffs, at the same time maxing ya skill.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; At lvl 18 now, I&#39;m still picking up bone chips, rusty weaps, animal<br/>
 </span></blockquote>skins,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; beetle eyes and even rat tooth (7cp) to sell.  FYI I&#39;m a wiz with the<br/>
&gt;&gt; weakest STR amg all races and I keep SIX bags on me to carry loot.  Many<br/>
&gt;&gt; times u see me walking between EC and WC while I&#39;m actually running with<br/>
&gt;&gt; 200% overload on me, haha.    If I can try so hard to save up money, I<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Ziltus.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; p/s:  Just FYI, the npc at tunnel buy at a lower price than FP npc, so I<br/>
&gt;&gt; die die gotta &#39;walk&#39; back to FP sell.  Now u see I earn all my money<br/>
