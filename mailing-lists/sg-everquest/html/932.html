<b>Subject:</b> Re: Trade Skills needed - Pls advice <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822459189">I had a skill points on Smithing and found that most of the items needed r<br/>
HEAVY for a monk to carry around.<br/>
I wanna try Jewellery but i think should be more effective for an Enchanter<br/>
than a monk.<br/>
<br/>
Im looking for a trade skill and considering Brewing and Pottery. Need some<br/>
advice and guildance.<br/>
<br/>
Have ead the posts on Brewing and here r some questions.<br/>
1) do u usaully sells the brew to NPC vendors ?<br/>
2) Whats the &quot;Carreer&quot; path for a Brewer? Can he make high lvl potions like<br/>
Gate potions or only alcoholics stuff.<br/>
3) Knowing that over consumption of &quot;Drinks&quot; will lower your INT, does<br/>
brewing lower INT too.<br/>
<br/>
Any recommendation would be appreciated<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Just an update of Sereph&#39;s Brewing Guide.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1. 1 x Mend requires 1 hops, 1 malt (not barley), 1 yeast, 1 cask<br/>
&gt;2. ? x Short beer requires 1 barley, 1 hops, 1 malt, 1 cask<br/>
&gt;3. 3 x Short ale requires 1 barley, 1 hops, 1 flast of water, 1 cask<br/>
&gt;4. ? x Ogre Swill requires 1 froglok meat, 1 malt, 1 yeast, 1 cask<br/>
&gt;5. 5 x Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew requires 1 Yeast, 1 hops, 1 Barley, 1 Malt,<br/>
&gt;1 Cask<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All ingredients (1s7c) except froglok meat and cask can be found on the<br/>
&gt;female npc merchant near West FP zone to North FP.  Cask can be found<br/>
&gt;inside tavern (outside bank at North FP) at 3s5c.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Suggestion is to buy at least 20-40 sets of ingredient before you start<br/>
&gt;making brews.  This will reduce the zoning time used up in buying<br/>
&gt;ingredients (West and North FP).  H/w, Sereph mentioned a brew barrel in<br/>
&gt;West FP, maybe that&#39;s better in reducing traveling time.  Purchasing time<br/>
&gt;can also be reduced if you have packpack on you, they are sold at the Monk<br/>
&gt;Guild at 6g4s<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Based on further experiment last night, seem like we can improve the<br/>
&gt;training by abit:<br/>
&gt;Skill 0-40:<br/>
&gt;Make mend. Buy 40 sets of ingredients.<br/>
&gt;DO NOT spend any skill points on brewing if it&#39;s already in your skill list<br/>
&gt;(under Persona Screen).  Just buy the ingredient and start making, your<br/>
&gt;skill will rise to 1.  Seem like for low skill lvl, you skill rise by one<br/>
&gt;everytime you make a mend, whether sucess or fail.<br/>
&gt;Skill 40-65<br/>
&gt;Make short ale, Buy 40 sets of ingredient<br/>
&gt;Skill 66-max<br/>
&gt;Make Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew.  Buy 80 sets of ingredients.<br/>
&gt;Max skill for me is 135 instead of Sereph&#39;s 138.  Seem like the cap is not<br/>
&gt;fixed between 135 and 138.  Maybe race and class play a part here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Once max, continue making Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew.  The profit may not be<br/>
&gt;attractive for high lvl players but it&#39;s definitely good money for low lvl<br/>
&gt;players, esp newbies.  The max initially investment of 10pp should be more<br/>
&gt;than enough to max out skill in 2-3 hrs.  I think rather than giving basic<br/>
&gt;stuffs to newbie kakis, teaching them this skill and contribute 5-8 pp for<br/>
&gt;their training shld be more than enough to get them to stand on their own<br/>
&gt;feet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Million thx to Sereph for sharing his precious trade skill power-training<br/>
&gt;info with us ;)<br/>

&gt;&gt; In 2 1/2 hours, I&#39;ve reach the maximum skill level (138, can&#39;t find the<br/>
&gt;&gt; recipe for harder drinks) and made around 20 plat<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s the steps I followed for those interested. All ingredients can be<br/>
&gt;&gt; found at West Freeport. The cask in found in inns or tarven. All the<br/>
&gt;&gt; stuff need to be place in a brew barrel. There&#39;s no need to buy that<br/>
&gt;&gt; lousy book, just buy the ingredients and the cask.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; 1. Make sure you have 5-7plat<br/>
&gt;&gt; 2. Dump 10 practice points into Brewing<br/>
&gt;&gt; 3. Make Mend till you reach 40 in brewing<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Mend requires:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; 1 Hops, 1 Barley, 1 Yeast and a Cask<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; You will make a lost at the time<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; 4. At 40, make Ale till you reach 65<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Ale requires:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; 1 Barley, 1 Malt, a flask of Water and a Cask<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Lost will be smaller<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; 5. At 65, make Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew till max<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew requires:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; 1 Yeast, 1 hops, 1 Barley, 1 Malt and A Cask<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; You will make a lost until 80, where you start break even from the sales<br/>
&gt;&gt; of your drinks to the bar. At 100, you will start to make money.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Will try out pottery tomorrow and tell you people the results I get.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Last of all, thanks Yiyang for that 5 plat donation which fund a large<br/>
&gt;&gt; part of this &quot;project&quot;<br/>
