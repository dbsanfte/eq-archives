<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336092908">Permafrost is quite a nice place for xp and loot (only refers to those <br/>
tougher gobs beyond the flag room).  I spend 5 hrs there last night <br/>
soloing, and half of the time I&#39;m the only soul in the zone.  If we can <br/>
find a full house of lvl 18-22 to camp there, I believe all will lvl pretty <br/>
fast.  The normal gob, thou mostly green to me, hit pretty hard.  I also <br/>
lost count how many times I zone last night, due to train, probably more <br/>
than 30 times ;)  The casters give pretty good loot and xp, and some even <br/>
drop bronze armors.  Initially we go there as a 3 wiz, 1 magi, 1 bard and 1 <br/>
shaman team.  Frankly speaking the fire power is pretty strong but down <br/>
time is long due to the fact that we have to tank alot and spend time <br/>
resting and med.  I believe if we can get 2 real-tanks, life will be much <br/>
easier.  The place got a good mixture of melee & caster mobs.  Tanks also <br/>
have problem soloing due to the caster mobs.  Last night a lvl 20 shaman <br/>
and a lvl 20 warrior come in as a group (the other is a lvl 17 wiz, solo), <br/>
they also kena bang out of zone due to those gob diviner, medi and priest. <br/>
 Those caster mobs&#39; HP is pretty low, can killed them normally within 2-3 <br/>
casts.  H/w, the tricky part is some of them heal VERY fast and hit VERY <br/>
hard (lighting shock ~ 120dam per cast).  If u dun waste them b4 they heal <br/>
themselves, u will find yaself in a very tough fight.  Tat&#39;s how the lvl 20 <br/>
warrior get killed at zone - he thought only 1 gob medi small fry and I was <br/>
monitoring the gob medi HP.  I see it drop below 50% 3-4 times and when it <br/>
heals, it go back to at least 75%.  In the end the warrior kena whacked <br/>
till death.  Another problem that u need a caster in the group is becoz <br/>
thos gob are very cunning mobs.  When u hit them to 10-20% hp, they sure <br/>
flee into the tunnel, and within 30-60 sec, u will see a train of 3-5 gobs <br/>
charging out ;)<br/>
<br/>
I spend 5 hrs there (until 4am) just to fill up one bubb.  Unless there is <br/>
kakis interested to camp there, I will go Lake to fight birdman tonight. <br/>
 PF is very wulu wulu (thanks to Sereph&#39;s recommendation), usually not more <br/>
than 10 (last night not even 5 during my 5 hrs stay) and it&#39;s really a <br/>
power lvling ground for those who can survive.  Sereph said he spend a <br/>
month there for his enchanter to gain from lvl 20 to 30, so must be good <br/>
lah.  If u guys wanna bash SG like what Sereph&#39;s enchanter is doing, come <br/>
join me, hehe.<br/>

p/s:  Unless u go beyond flag room and hunt, otherwise the loot is pretty <br/>
lousy for those gob outside enar zone.  I earn less than 10pp last night <br/>
for a 5 hrs hunt.  HH probably give much better loot but not as good xp for <br/>
the lvl 20s.</div>
