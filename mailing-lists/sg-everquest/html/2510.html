<div id="ygrps-yiv-100592601">Chaotic feedback does not only damage, but also has a taunt effect(normal taunt,<br/>
enchanter DD spell from sanity warp onwards has a mega taunt effect and is all or<br/>
nothing in terms of being resisted) with it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why mob will stick on you even though you don&#39;t do much direct damage to<br/>
it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Bolt takes longer to cast as least for my current lvl.  Funny is that IT<br/>
&gt; IS a guided<br/>
&gt; &gt; missile! ;)  Maybe it is lag, but last night, when Fesse and I were<br/>
&gt; kiting the qeynos<br/>
&gt; &gt; guard, I can hit the guard with my cinder bolt even he is behind me!  The<br/>
&gt; only thing u<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to make sure is that there is nothing blocking on the way.  With the<br/>
&gt; shock, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; mob should stand within your view else it will failed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Guided mean u can cast on a mob behind u wor.  I thot for bolt to be<br/>
&gt; effective, u must at least see the mob on ya screen (no need exactly<br/>
&gt; center)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have found something quite interesting here.  Just yesterday, I got the<br/>
&gt; staff of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Writhing when I was in HH.  Once I tried to melee the pickclaw, they will<br/>
&gt; come to me<br/>
&gt; &gt; instead of my partners.  This may either due to 1)  the - CHA effect that<br/>
&gt; makes u most<br/>
&gt; &gt; hated 2) u hit the mob too hard together with your staff and DD.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the chaotic effect goes off, it&#39;s 48dam, on top of ya melee dam.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; the total dam of ya 1st strike is more the tank&#39;s, tat&#39;s why it goes to u.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The real problem is most high lvl hunting place is dungeon where a magi<br/>
&gt; is not<br/>
&gt; &gt; welcomed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As long as u dun summon pet or summon but command ya pet properly, I guess<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s still good to have a magi ard to finish those fleeing mob.<br/>
