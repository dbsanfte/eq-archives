Ok... I&#39;m sure this is going to win me alot of fans out there (thats<br/>
sarcasim btw).<br/>
<br/>
Spirit of the Moon - Good guild.. never had a problem with them in all my<br/>
life online, even grouped with a few of them before the guild was formed,<br/>
and talked to a few members after the fact.  A guild that deserves respect.<br/>
<br/>
Divine Wind - Another good guild... never had a problem with.. well ok<br/>
there was that one time Enak tried to pass me a stale muffin, but I won&#39;t<br/>
bring that one up.  Grouped with a few of them now and then.. Enak being<br/>
the one who calls on me to bind him to places like HH.. only to say.. just<br/>
wanted ya here to group with.. heh.<br/>
<br/>
Society of the Inner Light - Grouped with about three of its members and<br/>
all I can say is.. good guys.  I haven&#39;t heard anything bad about them from<br/>
others nor do I think I will for a bit.  Definatly a bunch of people who<br/>
know how to stick together in a fight when need be.<br/>
<br/>
Apocolypse Knights - Well.. heh.. not much I can say.. only know one member<br/>
and he joined not too long ago, but they must be a good group after all...<br/>
they gave my friend (the recent joiner), a Glowing Crook Staff thingie.  So<br/>
they are good in my books.<br/>
<br/>
now for a couple of real winners... (the ones who will love me and be<br/>
undying fans of my appreciation and comments)<br/>
<br/>
Higher Order of the Arcane Arts - most of you know the history I have with<br/>
them, and I had heard that it had been dealt with, however I have had some<br/>
other bad experiences since then and of course exchanged words with some of<br/>
its members on those topics.  Definately not a winner in my book, but then<br/>
when you gather an all caster guild.. you just know yer asking for trouble<br/>
(ala Killstealer fest)<br/>
<br/>
House D&#39;Araignee - Only heard a few shouts from ppl near the Aviak city<br/>
about one member of this guild... Killstealing mobs from others.  Saw him<br/>
running around and cast a few times on a creature someone else was fighting<br/>
(near the end of the fights when the creature was almost dead).  So I can<br/>
only say they don&#39;t rank high in my books yet.<br/>
<br/>
Qui H&#39;oom Dai - to make a long story short.. any guild who lets in a runt<br/>
who sits in Oasis and floods the zone with NOOOOOOOO (as long as you can<br/>
type it) over and over and over again because his SoW ran out, then someone<br/>
accusing Enak of KS in HH (kinda funny.. 5 ppl hitting a mob while lonely<br/>
enak takes a few swings to increase his skill, absurd really) was annoying.<br/>
 Mostly due to the fact he kept calling him an Ass.  I will say one thing..<br/>
I did have a nice conversation with one of its members a while ago after I<br/>
asked what the name meant (Eye of the Tiger in Egyptian I think, very cool).<br/>
<br/>
That wraps up my dealings with Guilds that I&#39;ve seen.. or dealt with.  :)<br/>
This is one reason why I&#39;ve refused the few guilds who asked me to join so<br/>
far.  Not that I don&#39;t trust those who have, its that they don&#39;t know what<br/>
they are getting into when they ask me to join. :)</div>
