&gt; 5 gold. Man That guys is an angel, extremely friendly too. He too is a<br/>
&gt; monk of the 6th circle &lt;lvl 6 back then&gt;. How much money do you guys<br/>
&gt; make anyways? I can bank in only max 1 plat per hour but that affects<br/>
&gt; my EXP gain very much considering the meagre hours I<br/>
&gt; play... Wilson&lt;The Semi-Bruce Lee Fan&gt;&lt;The Ever Newbie&gt;<br/>
