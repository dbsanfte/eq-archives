&gt; 1. Slime crystal staff, dropped by a slime element in the bigger slime<br/>
pool<br/>
&gt; in Runnyeye.  Garren know what is the mob lvl?<br/>
<br/>
The slime crystal staff is not dropped by the slime elemental in Runnyeye.<br/>
The slime elemental in runnyeye drops the Beaded Slime Necklace +5 INT. The<br/>
slime crystal staff is found in Beholder on King Xorbb. Rare spawn on 1 of<br/>
the 2 evil eye spots in beholder.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. Ice crystal staff, found in Permafrost. Fesse pls provide info so we<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; go see see look look when camping for runed circlet.<br/>
<br/>
I bought it for 50pp in auction. Currently collecting all the different<br/>
elemental staffs. Found on ice goblin scryer in Perma. Low 20s i think.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. The deceiver mask (cant remember exact name, turn u to DE).  Dropped by<br/>
&gt; lower guk assasin.  Anyone got map to the spot? Also how tough is the<br/>
&gt; assasin?<br/>
<br/>
Guise of the deceiver. Go to the dead side in lguk. Swim to bedroom, take<br/>
the leftmost path and hug the right wall until you see the 2 froglok ghoul<br/>
walk straight and turn left at the end. You will see a ladder up. Up the<br/>
ladder is the assassin/supplier room. There will be 3 spawn spots. Middle<br/>
spot is supplier spot. Assassin is right spot. All the while you will need<br/>
invs to undead to make it there.<br/>
<br/>
*WARNING* Uniques can see through invis, just like the ghoul assassin, so<br/>
get ready to rush up the ladder and start beating the froglok ghouls.<br/>
Usually there will be 2 or 3 low lvl 30 froglok ghouls. The assassin is<br/>
about 35 and he can backstab for 80 X 2 and drops guise of the deceiver (brd<br/>
rog wearable +12 cha (?) +7 sv magic ac4) as common and serrated bone dirk,<br/>
rogues best weapon as rare. The supplier is also about 35 and drops some bag<br/>
(8 slots and reduces 75% (?) weight) as common and the thick banded belt (+1<br/>
5 str all/all weight 1.0(?)) as rare.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. Hidden water tunnel in Paw.  It spawns named mobs.  Mob lvl not high<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; was thinking to go there see see look look when too bored in EQ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Never went Paw before. Cant say anything sorry.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 5. Polished bone bracer.  Dropped by what mob, where?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Evil eye lords in Beholder. Rare drop (ac2 +3 wis +3 int) lords are about<br/>
level 23-24.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 6. Fesse pls advise me the reasonable price for the following jewelry:<br/>
&gt; - 7int/7str necklace<br/>
&gt; - 4int earring (a pair)<br/>
<br/>
Platinum sapphire necklace. Cost price is 105pp + 100pp = 205pp. Market<br/>
price can range anywhere from 600pp to 3000pp. 1200pp is a reasonable price<br/>
from the jeweler to ask from you.<br/>
<br/>
Golden sapphire earring. Cost price is 10.5pp + 100pp = 110.5pp. Ranges from<br/>
300pp to 1400pp. 600pp is a good price. 1000pp for 2 earrings.<br/>
<br/>
For the buyer, its always the cheaper the better. The best is to be a<br/>
jeweler yourself. Like me and just make yourself those items and forget<br/>
about the hassle of bargaining.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 7. Is there any INT bracers out there? Stats? Drop by who and where?<br/>
<br/>
Bracelet of woven grass. (+3 int +12hp) froglok scryer in upperguk. easy<br/>
kill. low 20s.<br/>
Golden chitin bracers (+5 int +5 agi) noxious spider rare drop in solusek B.<br/>
also drops the green silken drape (?) as common. level 42+<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Just a feedback, my max dam with less than 30 1HB skill using the staff of<br/>
&gt; writhing is 19 (melee) + 48 (chaotic effect), ie 67 dam per hit.  At such<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; low 1HB skill, the chaotic effect appears like once every 5 fights.  I<br/>
&gt; still got 30 skill points with me (after dumping 90 skills points and<br/>
&gt; 200+pp to rise my research skill from zero to 90 odd), wonder if I shld<br/>
&gt; throw them all into 1HB (since I seldom melee but the skill does help alot<br/>
&gt; when I try to kill mob for fractions).  Is there any skill a wiz shld look<br/>
&gt; into at mid-30?<br/>
<br/>
Dex + Skill in 1H blunt affects the chance of chaotic feedback from<br/>
appearing. I used a cracked staff since level 1 to level 29 and I use it<br/>
whenever im in a group and my skill in 1h blunt is now 100. Doesnt seem to<br/>
rise anymore. Anyway, for a wizard, its totally crap to use Staff of the<br/>
observers. Its a 2h blunt weapon (heavy like hell) that only gives +5 int.<br/>
You would be better off in a staff of the wheel (1h blunt and 1.0 weight) +<br/>
glowing stein combo = 20int and adds other stats too.<br/>
<br/>
Save all your skill points from level 1. Put 1 into those that need to be<br/>
started off and dont waste it on any others and just let time improve them.<br/>
Because at higher levels, these points will come in very handy. Max out<br/>
research to 175 and Spec: evoc to 200 which will need quite a lot of skill<br/>
points. Then at the end of the day (level 50), you will have plenty of<br/>
points to mold your character as you like. (ie. maybe you would like to max<br/>
out alteration for less fizzle evacs...)<br/>
