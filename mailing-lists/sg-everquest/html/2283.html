&gt; Najena<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s an &quot;old&quot; article i saved in my EQ folder of Dungeons.<br/>
&gt; I hope is still relevent, with all em&#39; patches and stuff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Najena is a very popular dungeon for characters level 15-30 that is<br/>
located<br/>
&gt; in the zone of lavastorm. To find Najena you can take a right upon<br/>
entering<br/>
&gt; lavastorm and follow the mountains. You will see the<br/>
&gt; Najena ruins in the distance. Najena is a spooky dungeon filled with a<br/>
green<br/>
&gt; fog throughout.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The entrance area is not too easy you will find greater skeletons and ogre<br/>
&gt; guards that range in the 15ish level range. Deeper in you will find<br/>
elements<br/>
&gt; and tentacle terrors. The first few rooms are the ones most<br/>
&gt; often occupied by characters level 15-20. There are two other areas in the<br/>
&gt; dungeon however for characters of higher levels. They must be visited in<br/>
&gt; order.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The first area is a secret room that will be to the left down on of the<br/>
&gt; hallways. This room lies behind an illusionary wall that you can walk<br/>
right<br/>
&gt; through. From this room you will see two passages. The door to the<br/>
&gt; left of here leads to some level 20ish skeletons. The passage downstairs<br/>
&gt; leads to the meat of this portion of the dungeon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You will find many necromancers and ogre&#39;s down in this area. However the<br/>
&gt; prized opponents in this area are Bonecrusher, the Ogre Captain and the<br/>
Ogre<br/>
&gt; Officer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bonecrusher is in a room to the left near the bottom of the stairs. He is<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; a room with 2 necromancers. Bonecrusher is a froglock ghoul who is level<br/>
24.<br/>
&gt; He is sought after for the magic items that he carries. This<br/>
&gt; includes flesh rings and barbed leather whips.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To the right of the bottom of the stairs and down a corridor you will find<br/>
&gt; the captains room. The captain is a level 27ish mob who is quite deadly.<br/>
He<br/>
&gt; is guarded by several ogres including an officer who is in the<br/>
&gt; level 24-25ish range. The captain carries a key to Rathyl&#39;s room as well<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; the occasional ogre maul or large bronze platemail piece of armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The keys you get from the monsters in this area will allow you to go to<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; real juicy part of this dungeon: behind the Najena sign. If you continued<br/>
&gt; straight when entering the dungeon you would undoubtedly<br/>
&gt; have noticed a Najena sign with some magicians guarding the entrance.<br/>
Behind<br/>
&gt; this sign lies the three major spellcasting NPC&#39;s in this zone: Rathyl,<br/>
&gt; Drelzna and Najena.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These NPC&#39;s must be visited in that order. Each NPC has the key to the<br/>
other<br/>
&gt; ones chamber as well as having a key out of their chamber(to hand out to<br/>
&gt; party members). The Drelzna and Najena keys are no<br/>
&gt; rent meaning that if you log out they will dissapear. None of these NPC&#39;s<br/>
&gt; spawn every time and there is an anti camp radius code implemented so that<br/>
&gt; you cannot simply camp by their lairs. This can be frustrating<br/>
&gt; at first but with a little practice you will be able to learn their<br/>
&gt; patterns.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want to get into specifics here as something has to be left to<br/>
&gt; chance(and it would be hard to describe anyway) so i&#39;m just going to<br/>
roughly<br/>
&gt; describe each NPC and an example of what you might find on<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Rathyl is a necromancer who is guarded by several magicians. He is a<br/>
deadly<br/>
&gt; foe even after death as his reincarnation will appear and have to be<br/>
&gt; destroyed all over again! A typical item you might find from<br/>
&gt; Rathyl would be a traveller&#39;s backpack.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Drelzna is guarded by 2 necromancers. Both the necromancers as well as<br/>
&gt; Drelzna can charm. This may be the toughest fight of them all perhaps even<br/>
&gt; tougher than Najena. One of Drelzna&#39;s prized possessions<br/>
&gt; is the journeyman boots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Najena is guarded by a couple of magicians. Najena is perhaps the rarest<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; them all and is the most powerful alone. Drelzna may be a tougher kill but<br/>
&gt; this is only because of her guards. One of Najena&#39;s prized<br/>
&gt; possessions is the flowing black robe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Enjoy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; YY<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; btw. get a map.<br/>

&gt; &gt;May I know which mob carry the key to Jboot room?  Where can I find it?<br/>
&gt; &gt; What lvl is the mob carrying the key and does it has other guard mobs<br/>
also<br/>
&gt; &gt;(what lvl if yes)?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;How abt the room tat drops Jboot?  What mobs and lvl inside?  I heard tat<br/>
&gt; &gt;room is tougher than Najena room (of coz Najena herself is still the<br/>
&gt; &gt;toughest mob in the dungeon) due to those necro guards which can charm<br/>
&gt; &gt;players.  What other artifacts can we find in the room?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;All info welcome, thx.<br/>
