<br/>

mention that theres no guild unity in QHD at all... since someone having<br/>
like 5 RTS dont even bother to give it to others and keep insiting on<br/>
money... as for lake rathetear... i guess when i have reached the level (20<br/>
if i am not wrong, pls correct)... u can show me the area and i can get that<br/>
myself... no worries on that one...<br/>
<br/>
i am now 1 bubbble away from level 18 and hope to get to level 20 or 21 over<br/>
the weekend... from then i will start to hunt aviaks... which i strongly<br/>
believe i can solo em until level 24-25... thast wat i heard... then the<br/>
treant hunting starts...<br/>
<br/>

have just began.... and pls refer to the follow passge for research<br/>
information...<br/>

Research for Good Alignment<br/>
This quest will make it easier for the good aligned researchers gain<br/>
experience in Research rather than wasting precious runes that would be of<br/>
value to create real spells. The quest begins (and ends, really) with<br/>
Mrysila of the Gypsy camp in North Karanas (Loc -672, -162). Hail her, she<br/>
will talk to you about the [Concordance of Research] and it&#39;s sister books<br/>
Runes and Research Volumes one and two. Then tell her you are [Interested]<br/>
in researching spells. If you bring her a lightstone, she will give you<br/>
whichever book she has more of at the moment. If you bring her a Greater<br/>
Lightstone, she will give you the Concordance of Research, which is the book<br/>
used to combine the items much like the Lexicon. To view the recipe books,<br/>
click on the appropriate book links here.<br/>
<br/>
Research for Evil Alignment<br/>
Within the Desert of South Ro (loc +100, +500. Straight South from the Oasis<br/>
of Marr zoneline), there is a camp with a female Teir&#39;Dal, named Smith<br/>
Tv&#39;ysa, selling research assistance items. In exchange for a Greater<br/>
Lightstone, you get a Concordance of Research Tome, which has spaces to<br/>
combine items much like the Lexicon. If you give her a few lightstones, she<br/>
will give you the Runes and Research Tomes Volumes one and two.<br/>

&gt; 1. You dun have to kill dvinn, u just have to wait for me to kill for u,<br/>
&gt; probably u can wait at CB entrance and I will call u in to loot once I got<br/>
&gt; one.  Find a time during weekend, I can teleport there pretty fast ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. I&#39;ve given u RTS right? Hehe, we all practice &#39;family pass down&#39;, no<br/>
&gt; worry, once we upgrade our stuffs, sure pass down.  Btw, if u can come to<br/>
&gt; Lake Rathetear, I can help u get a skull FOC. Again this is lore item, I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t loot anymore since I already got 1 on me.  I throw away quite alot<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; skulls and RTSs so far at gnoll camp, kinda wasted (can tell how happy<br/>
&gt; those lvl 12 to 20 who wander there for free stuffs, heh).  Too bad I dun<br/>
&gt; go Lake anymore coz the aviak guards no longer give me xp.  But when I go,<br/>
&gt; I will annouce in guildsay.  Meanwhile just go and find out how to go Lake<br/>
&gt; 1st, in case I give u a call, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3.  For all kakis between lvl 18 to 20, you can form a group of 3-6 pple<br/>
&gt; and hunt whole day in Lake Rathetear until lvl 26, or solo when u reach<br/>
lvl<br/>
&gt; 22 or so.  It&#39;s a pretty safe place to hunt as the are 1 bird, 2 birds and<br/>
&gt; 3 birds camps.  Depending how many pple in ya group, u jus go to the right<br/>
&gt; place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. I tried to hunt webclaw yesterday but he disappear once I root him (the<br/>
&gt; targeting just disappear after I see the rooted msg).  Anyone know where<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; spawn so that I can root and nuke him once he is out? How to lure him up<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; land if that is possible, since I get disturbed often in water with skill<br/>
&gt; 135 ;(.  Thx.<br/>
