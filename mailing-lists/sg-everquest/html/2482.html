&gt; KILL GARREN!!!  RIP HIM OFF!!!  ASK HIM PAY YOU 1,000PP AS COMPENSATION,<br/>
&gt; AND PAY ALL IN MAILING LIST 10,000PP EACH  ;P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway all caster kakis who hit lvl 35 hell lvl better camp for jboot now.<br/>
&gt;  It seem like only those higher than lvl 35 will get the quest note.  Those<br/>
&gt; at 35 (myself) will still get the boot.  Start camping around 6-7pm is a<br/>
&gt; good time, and give yaself up to next day noon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The reason we MUST get jboot is to lvl beyond hell lvl.  FYI I died 3 times<br/>
&gt; in a row with half bubb xp and still didnt drop lvl, as compared to drop<br/>
&gt; more than half bubb at lvl 34.  From this we can see that hell lvl is NOT a<br/>
&gt; rumor.  Gaining xp at hell lvl is really a pain in the ass, REAL pain!<br/>
&gt;  Solo kiting will become our best choice, which required u to have jboot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wiz w/o jboot can also kite using bond of force (I did it once last night,<br/>
&gt; forget to turn on my turbo speed, hehe), but if mob resist ya bond spell,<br/>
&gt; you can be 95% dead meat, unless u can zone out safely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually we can go for red mob (eg spectre) as a 2-3 men grp, but it still<br/>
&gt; required all to have jboots.  I know it&#39;s boring but trust me, it really<br/>
&gt; worth it.  Solo kiting a mob 3-4 lvl below u is MUCH safer and better xp<br/>
&gt; than hunting a white/black mob with a team of 2-3.  Grp kiting a red mob<br/>
&gt; will take some time to get hold of the coordination, but<br/>
&gt; I believe it pays.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No pain no gain, no gain no glory.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; p/s: I&#39;m forever banished from Qeynos region liao.  Now kill treants or<br/>
&gt; qeynos npc also no faction msg.  My faction already hit the &#39;beyond repair&quot;<br/>
&gt; stage, hehe.  Welcome to hell man!<br/>
