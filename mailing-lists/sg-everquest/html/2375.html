<b>Subject:</b> Re: Signing up PacNet <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740073409">What I am concern about is the stability of playing EQ. Using Cyberway, sometimes I will get 7 to 8 disconnections per hour. I don&#39;t care about browsing the net. The reason I want to switch to PacNet is because I heard someone (on the list) who is using PacNet has no disconnection problem in playing EQ. So I want to make sure that PacNet is real stable for EQ before I switch. Anyone else can confirm?<br/>
<br/>
Note: I am refering to 56K Analog Dial-up.<br/>

    Pacnet is no better than cyberway. In terms of packet loss..they may have less problems sometimes.<br/>
    But in terms of lag..they are the champions. Singnet and Cyberway win out in lag over Pacnet any day.<br/>
    Trust me i know i used both Cyberway and Pacnet unlimited a/cs before.<br/>

      I&#39;m going to terminate my Cyberway account to join PacNet. Can anyone confirm with me that PacNet will not give any connection problem on EQ (like Cyberway)? </span></blockquote></div>
