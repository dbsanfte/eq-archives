Subject: [sg-everquest] Solo farming<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Can someone tell me the min lvl for a wiz to solo the following dungeons:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Permafrost (up to King room)<br/>
You can solo the whole area up to King room at your level (40?) Preacher you<br/>
may have a bit of direct confrontation, same goes with king room and maybe<br/>
scryer. The rest should be np.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sol A (whole dungeon)<br/>
Sol A : All goblin spawns including efreeti,kindle and singe can be killed<br/>
at level 40 with a bit of skill and know where to stand to root/nuke etc. To<br/>
fight lava elemental, gabbie, captain bipnupple recommended 46 if not all<br/>
the gnomes will join and whack you. When fighting gabbie make sure your fire<br/>
resist is very high she nukes fast and pain so best to kill at level 50.<br/>
Same goes with lava elemental because it is a level 35-36 mob and very hard<br/>
to kite in his room.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sol B  (whole dungeon or max which area/wat lvl)<br/>
Perhaps the only thing a level 50 wizzie can solo in Sol B is the kobold<br/>
noble, even then it is still a very tough fight as he is a 37ish  enchanter.<br/>
And you probably have to clear all the surrounding mobs to solo pull him.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Unrest (whole dungeon or max which area/wat lvl)<br/>
You can solo whole unrest at 40 assuming you have wolfform, all spawns<br/>
except ghost of unrest is easy at that level. For ghost of unrest, you have<br/>
to be high level enough so that all the spawns surrounding ghost are green<br/>
then you can kite the ghost up to the garden. Assuming you have no wolfform,<br/>
knight is easy, barkeep you have to clear most spawns in his room, priest of<br/>
najena is easy, reclusive magi have to clear his room too and perhaps some<br/>
other spawns like the gnome that drops pugius are easy too<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Paw (whole dungeon or max which area/wat lvl)<br/>
Cant farm in paw imo, anyway not much to farm in paw except gnollhide tome<br/>
and robe of ishva and those are on lvl 40 mobs.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Befallen  (whole dungeon or max which area/wat lvl)<br/>
Whole dungeon should be np, befallen mobs work like as long as they are<br/>
green to you they wouldnt touch you as long as you dont sit/med.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Beholder Maze (whole dungeon or max which area/wat lvl)<br/>
Evil eyes range from lvl 18-25 so a level 30 wizard should be able to solo<br/>
them. Nothing much worthy of mention in this place.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Runnyeye  (whole dungeon or max which area/wat lvl)<br/>
Runnyeye = train city as the  elite goblins even though they are green will<br/>
agro you and the area is so small theres hardly a safe spot to pull your<br/>
rare spawns to. Assuming you can clear your path, king should be easy. Borxx<br/>
you will need at least 34 to solo while the goblin warlord is relatively<br/>
easy.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; WK Ogre Camp<br/>
Level 49 recommended. If not when you are forced to pull an ogre guard in<br/>
the initial splitting of spawns (have to pull it first), chief goonda will<br/>
join in and cause a lot of problems.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; SRo Sprectre Island<br/>
Sro not spectre island. Perhaps you talking about oasis. If you pull<br/>
spectres in oasis, all 3/4/5 depending on luck will come as they are very<br/>
close to each other. Same goes with the spectre island in OOT. So<br/>
recommended level is 49 when about 2/3 spectres are green to you and 1/3<br/>
blue.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; CT<br/>
CT is moderately hard but not impossible so you must learn wher to med/camp<br/>
etc Best to solo if all mobs are green to you, so about 46/7/8+.<br/>
<br/>
For stone golem (RV gauntlets) you can either clear all the gators in the<br/>
water in the stone golem area or invis and chiong in and water fight with<br/>
the stone golem. He is very strong therefore you will have a high chance of<br/>
dying against him so recommended lvl 49/50.<br/>
<br/>
Iron golem the one that drops RV helm spawns in 3rd floor of throne room.<br/>
Behind that area is a  passageway where 1 roamer walks by. Root nuke and<br/>
kill the roamer and start agro radius pulling (walk close to the mob just<br/>
enough to pull 1 and not all, hard to explain) the iron golem room (3<br/>
spawns). Beware there are many healers in CT, but ice cometting should kill<br/>
them fast.<br/>
<br/>
Tae Ew Diviner (RV bracer) and Templar (RV Leg) is easier. IF you are an<br/>
erudite wizard you will have a minor advantage here as gorillas do not agro<br/>
erudites and dwarfs. Diviner has 2 gorilla guards so if the 2 gorillas are<br/>
green and you are an erudite wizard you can solo pull templar. Diviner and<br/>
templar are  lower level so about level 44 can solo them. When you go into<br/>
throne, turn left and you will enter a small passageway with 2 spawns at 2<br/>
ends. Clear both spawns then walk to end of passageway, you should see the<br/>
diviner or his ph. Solo the diviner/ph then start strafing against the wall<br/>
so that you can see gorilla/templar then just nuke to pull.<br/>
<br/>
Archon (RV arms) I cant really comment but he is about level 33-35.<br/>
<br/>
Avatar of fear (RV BP) Level 49/50 needed. Camp at the very long passageway<br/>
leading to his green bubble. Clear roamers in passageway then 3 spawns on<br/>
the top pool of water. Go into bubble just nice to pull the Aof and quickly<br/>
run back into the door then start root/kite/nuke along the long passageway.<br/>
He is about level 37/38 so is dangerous. Once you clear aof you can continue<br/>
to clear Cazic Cenobite (RV boots) by just swimming down the bubble and<br/>
pulling him up to passageway and do the root/nuke.<br/>
<br/>
I missed out some spawns like clay golem etc, those should be easy (level<br/>
25-30 mobs)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Thx.<br/>

&gt; Ziltus<br/>

Kunark items are better than dragon items and dont need so many pple to kill<br/>
;)<br/>
