<div id="ygrps-yiv-599194130">I dunno, i do agree that Furor is somewhat overexaggerating. But if you look<br/>
at AO just prerelease, there were people complaining about the problems with<br/>
its fundamentals which were shot down by the fanbois then. This just appear<br/>
to me to be the same thing happening all over again.<br/>
<br/>
All i can say is, even if there are problems, even fundamental ones, they<br/>
can be fixed, but only within a certain time window (witness the AO 12.6<br/>
decable for a good example of exceeding that time window). Only time will<br/>
tell.<br/>
<br/>
And this list does seem very dead. Ziltus you should consider just closing<br/>
it down :D<br/>

&gt; Yes, similar post has been put up in DAOC Vault forum DAOC fans supporters<br/>
&gt; fighting back.  Anyway everyone know FOH is EQ&#39;s pet, I won&#39;t be surprised<br/>
&gt; if they can only see the bad stuffs.  Check the forum thread in SG-DAOC<br/>
&gt; forum, I put it up 1-2 days ago :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Their message board is a very interesting read of what Furor has to say<br/>
&gt; &gt; about DAoC. </span></blockquote></div>
