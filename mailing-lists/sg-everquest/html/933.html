<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184522130">Have always be wondering about the following.<br/>
<br/>
1) I have 12 skills points on Bind wound. My current lvl caps is 105.<br/>
Knowing that Bind wound will be effective if HP is 50% below. Let say I did<br/>
a Bind wound above 50% hp , a msg pops up and  tells me its not working and<br/>
i usedup a Bandage. The question is DID i contribute some factor to increase<br/>
the Bind wound skill or its just wasted.<br/>
<br/>
2) I have a new Skill. eg: Eagle Strike. I go to Monk Guild to put 1<br/>
practice point in it. Configure a hot key . Go to a zone and hunt Nasties,<br/>
Eg: orcs, Gnolls, Wiz, bears, etc,,(oops, not the wiz.. soorri, maybe<br/>
Paladin...hmm..maybe not. hehehe)<br/>
NOW, I con a nasties Orc for BLUE. I use eagle strike..It misses..Hit<br/>
again..1 hit.. hit again missies. THE question. DID the missed hits<br/>
contribute to any factor of Increase to the Eagle Strike skill overtime????<br/>
<br/>
3)Eagle Strike skill again. This time I con a Orc for Green. I use new Eagle<br/>
strike to hit it. It hits for 8 Damage...hit again 5 Damages. I keep killing<br/>
Greenies but skill doest seem to go up. Or does it??????. I know that KiIlin<br/>
Blue nasties up the skills ,what about greenies?<br/>
<br/>
4) Was at the oasis yesterday. A Sand Giant was chasing a guy. I was at the<br/>
1st pillar. The Guy ran toward me. THe SG follows behind. SG went INTO the<br/>
WATER!!!!. Hit the guy bad. he died. SG look at me !. I smile. Wave. Says<br/>
Hello! Bow, offer him Freddy as a Sacrifice and  it still  hits me for 48<br/>
damages. I did  a Feign Death. It stop hitting me. It hovers around my fake<br/>
corpse for a while b4 going away..whew..<br/>
NOW.. I looked around no SG . very the safe liao. Got up and went over to<br/>
near 2nd Pillar. Use a Shrikens to lure a DWC. I fight Crocs till its Almost<br/>
die. From the horizon I see a BIG Black Shadow coming towards me. i Con it.<br/>
Its a SG!.its far..np. looked at it again. It getting closer. I didnt see it<br/>
was chasing anyone. It came straight at ME!. I ran.It hits me. I feign<br/>
death. it goes away. i got up. After a while the SG appear from a Sand Dune.<br/>
I didnt see it  this time. It hits me bad. I feign death. Failed.. I died!<br/>
&^%$%$#%@.<br/>
QUESTION: SG Gunning me down! WHY???? it has a &quot;link&quot; on me since i Feign<br/>
death??? lotsa ppl saw it and says my FAction was low with SG. Ya sure. I<br/>
killed hundreds of SG alreadi. :P .Some says i Killed it Baby SG...hmm......<br/>
Maybe, becos of the Parang Sereph lompang to me, parang got some smelly<br/>
blood from last ritual Sereph did on Einan. I tellin u , Sereph is NOT<br/>
well.Trifrost, Garren , Leshrec  and Zitus should have a good talk with<br/>
her/him/it.<br/>
<br/>
Ok long questions. Give me good short answers please.<br/>
