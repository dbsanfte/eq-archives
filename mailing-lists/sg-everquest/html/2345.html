<div id="ygrps-yiv-981256165">Hi, Terence here. This is my second post so please pardon my sudden intrusion.<br/>
<br/>
Since the last update, I have been getting disconnected from the server 7 or 8 times in an hour. Verant says that it might be the Snet (I think it is an ISP in US) and its routers problem. Does our ISPs (SingNET, Pacific NET and Cyberway) use their routers? I am using Cyberway i.infinity plan btw.<br/>
<br/>
Any Cyberway subscribers having the same problem when playing EQ?</div>
