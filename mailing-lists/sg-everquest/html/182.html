<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847061946">Confession? nah....<br/>
<br/>
Why I choose to play a monk .<br/>
 I wannted a simply character without much fuss over spells inventories. I<br/>
like spell plays in RPG , but  i have only 2 hours a nite to play EQ. so a<br/>
&quot;quickie&quot; char would be ideal.<br/>
<br/>
I looked thru all the pros and cons of all the Chars types on EQ, Both evil<br/>
and the  good. I was very interested in the Cleric and Shadow Knight char.<br/>
You know , the special effects department. :) , Cleric is ALLWAYS in demand<br/>
for thier skills and the S.Knight kick ass.<br/>
<br/>
Well, i thought the monk is simple enuff. No need to memories spells, mana ,<br/>
weapons, etc.now i have to save money to buy armor . i dont need weapons<br/>
like swords and staff. but  still needs money. Currently , im about 30 pp in<br/>
the red  :-P<br/>
<br/>
Monks will be a really powerful after the 20 lvl , with 100 skill points in<br/>
the mend , a good dual wield and double punch. It goin to kick ass. For now,<br/>
the progress is slow but steady. I something look in envy of other char type<br/>
of the same lvl. hell, they do much more damages than a monk....for now.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts to get off my chest. What&#39;s yours?<br/>
