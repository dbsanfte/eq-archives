<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869972380">As you guys might have known, the new server Prexus is up already. Being a wizard, I have always wanted to play the dark side and have always been fascinated by the necromancer&#39;s array of spells. Therefore i have decided to make a Gnomish Necromancer in the Prexus server and see how it goes. Being a new server, less people would probably be there, and thus the initial xp gain should be speedy enough. Anyone who is willing to switch servers for a while to try out the class they always wanted, but not able to bear to leave their main characters can always join me. )<br/>
My nick there would probably be Gandalf but if server does not allow it, then Khadgar or Leshrac. Laters!<br/>
