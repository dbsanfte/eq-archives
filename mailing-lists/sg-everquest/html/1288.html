<div id="ygrps-yiv-746125499">So far spend 200pp to get my smithing to 95.  I thot at least can make some <br/>
easy banded liao, but spend my last few pp to make 2 banded gorgets <br/>
(easiest banded to make) yet both FAILED!  *(%%$#   Problem is, at skill <br/>
95, skewers no longer give me anymore skill, tat means I need to throw in <br/>
MORE money to start making banded stuffs to rise my skill!  So far I&#39;m <br/>
still making loss when I make banded gorget and sell back to npc, not to <br/>
considered the failure yet.  The cheapest banded also cost me close to 2pp <br/>
to make, sigh.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m broke again, and have been staying at lvl 20 for a week (due to <br/>
camping for dirk and smithing).  It will take me at least another week to <br/>
hard work b4 I can earn enuff money for the next round of smith training ;(<br/>

p/s: Met a barbarian shaman at bird island over weekend, his smithing is <br/>
104.  He told me he spend 300pp so far, and the reason for spending so much <br/>
more is due to his low INT.  For those who wanna take up smithing, better <br/>
create a new high INT char to do so instead of using the existing char (if <br/>
INT below 100), otherwise not only will u smith until vomit blood like me, <br/>
u will smith until u cry man! Heheh.<br/>
