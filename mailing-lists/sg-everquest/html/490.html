  To improve faction,there are 2 ways<br/>
  1.If possible,choose agnostic when choosing ya race...<br/>
  2.kill as many orcs as possible <br/>

    hi all,<br/>
    it seems that quite abit had happened over the pass weekend when i wasnt around...  the party got formed... n stuff like that... n ive readup abit on the few websites over the weekend... i think in general... the necromancer has spells that spread over a pretty wide range... from summoning... to direct damage... to healing... that no one spellcasting class can provide... however this is with the drawback of faction.... so i guess my first char in EQ will most likely be a Necromancer... but i havent decide to make a Erudite or Dark Elf Necro ... most likely Dark Elf... but i think i need to do more research on faction n stuff like that.... maybe some of u guys can help me out here... esp Leshrec...<br/>
    1. is it that bad that a Dark Elf Necro is KOS in other towns/cities?<br/>
    2. how difficult is to be able to better the faction so that one can enter those cities without KOS? n how can u do it?<br/>
    3. what about Eruite Necro? <br/>
<br/>
    Pls advice :) although i havent got my EQ here yet... but i would like to be fully prepared fer it b4 it comes... :) hopefully within this week... otherwise next... as i can only play during the weekend... BTW... count me in... in ya guild.... i should be in the same server as u guys... but i guess i will be progressing slowly... most likely i will be using SilverHand. :)<br/>
<br/>
    Also, not sure about Trade Skills... anyone has any advice fer Necros? Also, u think it will be better to have 1 trade skills on a char rather than 2? or does it matter? thats all i got fer now...<br/>
<br/>
    cheers,<br/>
    Fred<br/>
