<b>Subject:</b> RE: How many of u guys at Tribunal? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-974079761">Hmm, u mentioned that Inno economy is all screwed, can u elaborate abit <br/>
more?  *scratch head* ;)<br/>
<br/>
I feel tat every servers will ultimately grow &quot;mature&quot;, meaning more <br/>
twinked chars will show up as the time goes by.<br/>
The joy of playing online RPG like UO and EQ comes from the different <br/>
stages of char development in the game (newbie, intermediate, experienced, <br/>
veteran, god-like).  No doubts it&#39;s easier to train a char with somebody <br/>
twinking you, but you will lost the fun, the good, the bad, the sad, the <br/>
fear, the frustration, the joy etc...all the experiences u are supposed to <br/>
encounter when playing this game.<br/>
<br/>
For those twinked chars you come across, most of them has a high-lvl char <br/>
behind supporting.  This means that those players also spend their time <br/>
going thru&#39; the newbie stage.  If everything comes so easily, u will soon <br/>
lost interest in the game.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think quite number of those exisitng kakis can easily spare <br/>
10-20pp for a newbie kakis buying a descent set of newbie <br/>
weap/armor/stuffs.  I think with this &#39;twinking&#39;, it&#39;s already good enuff <br/>
to start off training ya char.  On the other hand, sometime it&#39;s best for <br/>
new-comers to spend a week or so, playing a brand new char w/o any <br/>
twinking, to get the feel of the game and decide if it is the class/race <br/>
that you are going for.  If every new comers come into server and suga suga <br/>
create new char, we help to twink abit, and delete char to re-create <br/>
another one and expect twinking again, then it&#39;s not tat fair to those <br/>
helping.  So it&#39;s always a 2-sided coins ;)<br/>
<br/>
Just like playing RTS game.  If u hack a saved game and play the game by <br/>
building only the more powerful units to rush ya opponents, u will never <br/>
learn the usefulness of other units.  For most of the solo campaign game, <br/>
normally there is 1 or 2 missions where the most powerful unit (which is <br/>
normally slowest) is no longer a useful element in completing the mission. <br/>
 At this stage, only those players who really play from scatch will be able <br/>
to tackle the problems and complete the mission safely.<br/>
<br/>
Some players reached lvl 50 first, some reach lvl 50 later.  Ultimately we <br/>
will all be lvl 50s.  Just ask yaself, what kinda lvl 50 u wanna be? ;) <br/>
 FYI there are some lvl 49 players in EQ who even lost their way in South <br/>
Karan, si-bek jiat-lat, hahahah ;P<br/>
<br/>
I myself is one of those few amg local kakis tat started a char in Prexus <br/>
when it&#39;s first up.  With my wiz experience in Inno, I make a really cool <br/>
wiz char in Prexus.  H/w, dun to the lack of kakis, I find training there <br/>
is very boring.  In the end I follow the rest back to Inno.  Now u may say, <br/>
it&#39;s not tat difficult to find grp members to hunt with, but I must comment <br/>
that it&#39;s VERY difficult to find TRUST-WORHTY kakis in the game.  Ask <br/>
veteran players like Sereph and Garren, their feeling when someone in the <br/>
grp looted the camped stuffs, disband and run off? ;)  At least in Inno, I <br/>
know who I can fight together...to death.  Until now I still remember the <br/>
newbie named David in Prexus, who disband from the team when we striked a <br/>
skelly train near Ak&#39;non dragon bone land.  When some of the team members <br/>
asked him why he disband after the battle, he said he was LD, while I <br/>
myself saw him running to guards with my own eyes ;)<br/>
<br/>
Ziltus<br/>
<br/>
p/s: I read form a EQ site that the numbers of casters armors discovered is <br/>
only less than 10% of all the casters armors in the game ;)  Just tat <br/>
casters sux in adventuring (we are better in camping) due to train and <br/>
random spawn, we dun discover as many casters stuffs like those tanks out <br/>
there.<br/>
