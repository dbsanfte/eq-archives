<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395291214">Got this from my UO guild msg board.  Nevertheless I will still proceed to <br/>
sell my secondary UO acct.  I guess I will keep my primary UO acct <br/>
&quot;slightly&quot; longer...hehe.  Once the lands open up, I must quickly built 2 <br/>
castles and sell them off later, wuahahahah ;P<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, can tell that UO is now learning from EQ, when itself already <br/>
possess much more role-play element than EQ....<br/>

The Next 6 months....possibly another expansion CD coming.<br/>
<br/>
Origin is incredibly excited to be able to announce to you the latest plans <br/>
for Ultima Online. Over the next 6 months, we will be expanding and <br/>
improving UO. As features become ready, they will be rolled out to the <br/>
existing playerbase in regularly scheduled updates.<br/>
We&#39;ve detailed an assortment of our plans below, and will be providing <br/>
extensive information on each as they are implemented over the next six <br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
Land Expansion<br/>
While the specific details of these lands are still being formalized, they <br/>
will undoubtedly bring new opportunities for housing and adventuring.<br/>
<br/>
Options for PvP<br/>
The addition of this land will allow us to geographically separate play <br/>
styles within UO, meaning we can create areas for engaging, adventuring <br/>
experiences without the element of player versus player combat. There will, <br/>
of course, still be plenty of room for player versus player combat. In <br/>
fact, PvP will be expanded and improved in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Party System<br/>
A party system is being designed to allow group adventuring. We plan to <br/>
allow you to easily share profits and resources with your party while <br/>
hunting.<br/>
<br/>
Improved Monster AI<br/>
We will be upgrading monsters with an improved AI to enable them to react <br/>
to players in new ways, in addition to making them more challenging to <br/>
defeat overall.<br/>
<br/>
Increased Veteran Player Volunteer Programs<br/>
We expect to have over 3,000 trained Counselors, Companions and Seers in <br/>
place by February 2000 to support and enhance the world of UO. Interesting <br/>
in joining us? Visit our Counselor Application area for details.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to these upgrades, we&#39;ve planned a variety of other smaller <br/>
improvements and systems for UO and will release details on these as they <br/>
are finalized.<br/>
<br/>
For your information, the following is the official corporate press <br/>

ORIGIN Announces Plans for Exciting New Features in Ultima Online<br/>
The richest, most compelling virtual world on the Internet is about to get <br/>
even better<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
AUSTIN, Texas, September, 22, 1999-ORIGIN Systems?, the creator of online <br/>
worlds, is taking its successful Ultima? Online (UO) franchise to new <br/>
heights. New features currently under development will dramatically improve <br/>
gameplay and increase service quality for the thousands of people worldwide <br/>
who live and play in UO&#39;s fantasy world. The ambitious development schedule <br/>
over the next six months will deliver constant feature upgrades to current <br/>
UO players and provide easier access for those just getting started.<br/>
<br/>
The feature upgrades under development will make Ultima Online a better <br/>
place to live. Additional land mass will provide more opportunity for <br/>
players to become home owners in UO. The additional land will also allow <br/>
for the geographical separation of play styles in UO-areas for improved <br/>
player versus player (PvP) combat and areas for compelling adventures <br/>
without the element of PvP. This will allow dedicated role-players, <br/>
beginners and peace-loving players an environment separate from the <br/>
sometime hostile world of the old Ultima Online.<br/>
<br/>
The future upgrades will make UO more fun to explore. A new party system <br/>
will provide players with a vehicle that facilitates group adventuring, <br/>
including group communication, movement, combat, resource sharing and <br/>
profit sharing. Improved monster AI will dramatically increase the <br/>
excitement of player vs. monster encounters.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the new additions will make it easier to get started in UO. New <br/>
training areas are being created in Ultima Online where thousands of <br/>
experienced UO players will help new players get their feet on the ground <br/>
and have fun. More than 3,400 trained volunteers are expected to be on <br/>
board by spring 2000, helping people enjoy the world of Ultima Online.<br/>
<br/>
The new features announcement comes as UO, celebrating its second <br/>
anniversary this month, enjoys unprecedented growth and popularity. <br/>
Currently UO has more than 134,000 active players, each one paying $9.95 a <br/>
month to participate. The global network infrastructure now exists on 17 <br/>
server sets located on three different continents. UO still attracts <br/>
thousands of new users each month. People are playing in every one of the <br/>
world&#39;s time zones and represent more than 50 countries. In recent months <br/>
Ultima Online has been featured in Fortune magazine, The New York Times <br/>
Magazine, the Boston Globe and on CNBC. And the UO web site, <br/>
http://www.uo.com, gets two million unique user sessions each month.<br/>
