<b>Subject:</b> Re: A very sad story (and one that made me very pissed  off) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-276595594">This happened to me too in Highhold. At the gnoll respawn, theres the famous<br/>
Polished Granite tomahawk which is VERY camped. As the guy was my friend, I<br/>
decided to help him get the tomahawk. We had a full group of six and when we<br/>
killed the named gnoll, a group member IMMEDIATELY looted the gnoll. Now, it<br/>
was very obvious that the gnoll was carrying a weapon, most likely the tommy<br/>
since he dosen&#39;t load anything else other then the shield, but that guy<br/>
played dumb and pretended he didn&#39;t understand english. As the group decided<br/>
on a alpha loot on the tommy, my friend was the first to get, but that dude<br/>
who stole the tommy just kept saying &quot;No axe, shield only&quot; And when my<br/>
friend asked for the shield since he should get the first loot, he said<br/>
&quot;Shield no with me. In bank&quot; But in the end he just ran away. To think we<br/>
had internal conflict as well as external conflict (A cleric named Kagana<br/>
kept bitching to my friend that she was bringing a druid which could help<br/>
her steal kill the gnoll. In the end when the gnoll spawned, they don&#39;t have<br/>
mana. lol.)<br/>
Anyways, I think we Singaporeans should group together OURSELF and only<br/>
trusted friends to do Equipment runs. Sucks to trust these assholes who<br/>
don&#39;t have any conscience at all.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Another occasion I was hunting with a ranger (both solo), a 3 men group<br/>

&gt;&gt; EVERYONE at the camp to take a kill!  That mean - if it&#39;s a 6 men team, I<br/>
&gt;&gt; will have to wait for them to kill 6 times b4 I get mine, hehe.  Kinda<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;     2 days ago, I was at Befallen hunting for a BBC (which I don&#39;t<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; just wanna get one to sell of cash, I&#39;m broke. Trust me, even when u<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; reach my lvl, u will still be struggling for $$$). The party consist of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Garren (ie me), Ironbuket, Iyenya, Senorn and Phenix. We were lucky<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; the first Troll SK we killed had the BBC. That was the end of the good<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; part. Phenix then immediately stole the BBC and refuses to pass over<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; BBC to me (funny thing was that they agreed to do alpha loot and my<br/>
 </span></blockquote>name<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; ended up as first. But I did said that the group can buy the BBC and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll spilt the cash with the group). And when he (ie Phenix) tried to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; run out of Befallen, he died. Okie, that would have been end of story.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Guy looted group BBC and died on his way out, and loses his stuff. But,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; we&#39;re kind hearted enough to help him to get his stuff back. Then his<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; friend Senorn was given permission to loot his corpse. Okie, letting<br/>
 </span></blockquote>his<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; friend Senorn loot the Phenix is almost as good as losing the BBC. They<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; are friends. But, dued to some lag and wierd shit, Senorn dropped his<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; SBH, and lost the BBC too. Now, Iyenya picked up the SBH. Okie, so we<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; gotten the SBH instead of the BBC, well it&#39;s better than nothing. But,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; we didn&#39;t sell it. We held on to it and see who claim to lose his SBH.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Both Phenix and Senorn claimed to have dropped the SBH and both claimed<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; that each other had the BBC. But, why did I choose to believe that<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Phenix had stolen the BBC (the 2nd time and also con the SBH off<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Iyenya,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; which is likely to belong to Senorn)? B&#39;cos when I went down to Oasis<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and asked 1 day later, ppl beside him said that he&#39;s holding a BBC. I<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; started to taunt him (PRICK was about the kindest thing I said about<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; him) and challenged him to a duel which Phenix refused. One thing I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; saying is that I&#39;ll never ever want to be in a group with Phenix (who<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; stole the group BBC and stole/sold his friend Senorn SBH, which Senorn<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; (a warrior) had to sell off his armor to get another SBH). So if you<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; ever have to band with Phenix, think again.<br/>
