<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048646780">1. Hmm, I think it&#39;s the other way round leh.  Bolt cast faster than shock, <br/>
but it&#39;s non-guided missle and normally slightly higher dam, LOS is also a <br/>
factor when targeting.  Let me check my bolt and shock casting time <br/>
tonight.<br/>
2. Alamak, every class also complain, hehe, grass-elsewhere-greener <br/>
syndrome I guess.  At least u magi nuke next to wiz, PLUS u got a pet to <br/>
tank for u..<br/>
3. I&#39;m talking abt the range lvl 34-38.  Magi dd inflict higher dam than <br/>
Wiz lah, no arguement on that.  FF&#39;s lvl 34 dd is more than 310, while my <br/>
lvl 34 dd is only 30X.  But even magi with a higher dd, I can easily draw <br/>
mob to me but not the other way round.  My death at lvl 35 with FF (lvl 34 <br/>
magi) and Zan (lvl 35 magi) prove it ;)<br/>
4. Magi is more of a supporting/nuking role in a grp, where wiz is pure <br/>
nuker.  There is no arguement magi is the 2nd best nuker after wiz.  And <br/>
with ya lvl 49 dd spell of 900dam, you guys are not 1/2 wiz coz our highest <br/>
dd spell is only 1200 (ie ya&#39;s is 75% of ours, not 50%), plus the fact u <br/>
guys can get tat spell easier and cast faster.<br/>
5. Overall speaking, other than dungeon, magi shld survive better than wiz, <br/>
if u play well.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I disagree Magi is lousy, and also disagreed tat magi w/o pet is 1/2 wiz<br/>
