Well, everytime before you hit the &quot;Generate Character&quot; button. They will<br/>
tell you the difficulty rate. For monk, its Moderate. For Barbarian, its<br/>
easy etc... Race will effect the rate for at least 30% in my opinion. I<br/>
believe Entreri is going to have a time of his life playing a baddy DarkElf<br/>
hahaha!<br/>
<br/>
Also, HighElves and other races such as Erudites don&#39;t speak the common<br/>
tongue. So you have to practise and learn their language to interact with<br/>
them, if not the following will happen. &lt;You being the human&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Human : Hello Mr Erudite with that super long forehead!<br/>
Erudite : Pfdhhaf, ahfdhrejuyj. jhjlsdsu ghrdth! &lt;nshht&gt;<br/>
Human : Huh?<br/>
<br/>
As for classes, Shaman is best all rounder mage. Magicians kick SERIOUS-ass<br/>
once they hit Level 48. 2 shots of their Ice Spell will kill any average<br/>
player. Not sure about the effects on monsters though. Monsters will last<br/>
longer than players, I THINK!<br/>
<br/>
As for skills, you can&#39;t choose them. They are there for you and for you<br/>
only. However, you won&#39;t be able to use the skill until certain levels. Lets<br/>
take monks for example cos they are the most simple to understand...<br/>
<br/>
Once you hit Level 5, you will have a new skill &quot;Round Kick&quot; added to your<br/>
list. It is only then, that you are able to use it. So before you reach<br/>
level 5, you are stuck with normal punch and kick. At Level 13, you will get<br/>
&quot;Tiger Claw&quot; So at Level 13, you will get an extra alternative for your<br/>
fighting style. Hence you can either choose to Kick, Punch, Round Kick or<br/>
Tiger Claw.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer sophisticated fights, not like Bruce Lee. But most people are like<br/>
Bruce Lee. Short swift death for enemies. So they will KEEP USING ONLY the<br/>
best special attacks like Flying Kick and Dragon Punch. I however will stick<br/>
to a few normal punches then let out one Flying Kick then few normal kicks<br/>
then a Tiger Claw etc. More variety in my fighting style...nicer for the<br/>
onlookers also ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for ranting,<br/>

&gt; Can anyone share their experience in char creation, esp for newbies (hmm,<br/>
&gt; more for all-rounded chars with best &#39;advantages&#39; in the game):<br/>
&gt; - Which race?<br/>
&gt; - Which character?<br/>
&gt; - Which skills you pick in the begining, and what skills you intend to<br/>
pick<br/>
&gt; up later?<br/>
&gt; - Stats? </span></blockquote></div>
