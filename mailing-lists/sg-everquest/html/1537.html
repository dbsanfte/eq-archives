<div id="ygrps-yiv-127446499">I&#39;m still wearing the stuffs I used to have at lvl 16, with the exception <br/>
of BI Medallion which I got from a &#39;rich man&#39; last night, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Basically all those which can be used by wiz I also want.  Those cannot be <br/>
used by me, but got extra, which I can sell, I also dun mind taking up, <br/>
hehe.  I need to max out my smithing skill ASAP, now at skill 105 I think, <br/>
which only allow me to make banded gorget and bracer with 80% sucessful <br/>
rate. Kinda discouraged to fail making boots as a master smith, sigh.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here&#39;s wat I want ;)<br/>
<br/>
Woven parts- W2<br/>
Crown of the Froglock Kings(Can attempt to try) - W2<br/>
Shimmering Orb - W2<br/>
Bracelet of Woven Grass - W2<br/>
Serpentine Bracer (another maybe) - W2<br/>
Elf Hide Gloves - S2/W2<br/>
Flowing Black Silk Sash (another maybe) - S2/W2<br/>
Embroidered Black Cape (another maybe) - W2<br/>
Adamantite stuff - W2<br/>
Collar of Undead Protection - W2<br/>
Gatorscale stuff - W2 (dunno if I can use, but heck care, grab 1st, hehe)<br/>
Sack that reduce 80% weight - W2<br/>
Guise of the Deceiver (Maybe........) - W2<br/>
Azure Sleeves (maybe) - W2<br/>
Mesh stuff - W2<br/>
