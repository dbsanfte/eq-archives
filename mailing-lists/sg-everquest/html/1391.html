<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445989502">From EQV:<br/>
Akesia, a Verant employee who appeared on the Quellious chat channel today <br/>
at 1:45 pm PST while the server was down, stated that there will be a quest <br/>
that will allow players to move characters from one server to another. When <br/>
asked to confirm this, she repeated &quot;Yes, it will be a quest.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I foresee it must be a damn difficult quest to switch server, maybe <br/>
with a group of full-house lvl 50s? ;)<br/>
