<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956551255">Hi ppl,<br/>
Singularity boss aka Reddawn,heh had agreed to have a special page for Everquest and since Singularity is currently going through a major revamp along with the special page mentioned,it will not be up too soon.However,this is how the page will work.<br/>
<br/>
The page could be updated by anyone through an online form which will directly added to the news section.This is a page specially dedicated to the Singaporean Everquest Community so I HOPE no spamming or unrelated stuff to be posted.<br/>
<br/>
All in all,I hope the Singaporean Community sprit will be bolstered by this page.Thanks and show all your support by posting all the juicy stuff you all want to let all the local players know.Since Sereph is the one who suggested the idea.I think he will be the main manager of the site,will see how it goes.<br/>
<br/>
