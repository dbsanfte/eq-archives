<div id="ygrps-yiv-61252835">I agreed with what Leshrec is saying. If the Wiz is in a group and he<br/>
managed to outblast and get the kill, then it&#39;s my group composition is wrong.<br/>
But if the friggy wiz is soloing, I screw him upside down if possible. like<br/>
leting him solo the named orc, heal the named orc etc (but I heard is that u<br/>
can&#39;t heal npc anymore), or train tons of orcs into him and tell the group to<br/>
zone out.<br/>

&gt; This is a rather long post. You have been warned =)<br/>
&gt; This is that I think of steal killing in Highhold. If a tank or warriors<br/>
&gt; starts attacking the mob, then I don&#39;t think its wrong to blast it, IF you<br/>
&gt; start blasting when hes just started on the mob. This is for a very simple<br/>
&gt; reason, if all the mob he attacks is gonna by his, he will get everything,<br/>
&gt; especially those in groups, where there are clerics in it. Since there is<br/>
&gt; practically no downtime. Anyways, if you start blasting it, the mob will run<br/>
&gt; over to you and attack you, so if anybody else starts shooting at it, they<br/>
&gt; are just helping you to get kill. I have seen orc fanatics that have spawned<br/>
&gt; and die in 1 sec after, becos 6-7 casters shoot at it at the same time.<br/>
&gt; Usually the player who does the most damage with one spell , usually the<br/>
&gt; magician or the wizard would get branded a stealer just because he is a<br/>
&gt; loner and has no group. Of course those assholes which are really out to<br/>
&gt; steal kill can be seen very obviously, like what ziltus has mentioned,<br/>
&gt; waiting for tank to do 20-30% damage before shooting. However, In my opinion<br/>
&gt; if i shoot a mob when you are just starting on it and I kill it after he<br/>
&gt; beats on me, although a tank type or some other caster shoots at it, I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really care if you brand me a kill stealer. If I spend 30% of my mana on a<br/>
&gt; mob instead of 80%, its not because I want to, but rather its because other<br/>
&gt; caster are trying to blast my mob, so that they can get kill and when they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t get it, they get pissed and call you names again. Thats why its very<br/>
&gt; important to get a group, since you have your own tankers tanking and you<br/>
&gt; nuking. As for named NPC, its FFA but when you do get the kill ppl will<br/>
&gt; curse and swear saying they waited 20 hrs for the named NPC. Well, If you<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t get the kill yourself, get a damn caster who can nuke for you. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sick of ppl whining cos they can&#39;t get kills especially when I shoot at the<br/>
&gt; named one and even when he comes to me, the other tanks from other groups<br/>
&gt; continue to beat at him and expect to get kill. I myself have always grouped<br/>
&gt; from level 16 to my current level, and there was only once when I tried to<br/>
&gt; do solo and do what other wizards did. I must admit xp came in very fast, at<br/>
&gt; a rate of 1 bubble per hr so I could level in a day. But the only group was<br/>
&gt; there got pissed and one guy even wanted to duel me, a level 21 ranger. Of<br/>
&gt; course I just ignored him and did almost 3 bubbles of xp that day. One funny<br/>
&gt; thing later was how his group ran and zone leaving him alone fighting 2 orc<br/>
&gt; scouts. Seeing he was about to lose, I became visible (I am invis when<br/>
&gt; medding) and he asked for help. Of course I helped him out, but he still<br/>
&gt; called me names later on. However that was the only time I soloed like that<br/>
&gt; and of course it was very lonely not to mention getting tells on &quot;Thats not<br/>
&gt; very nice. But I don&#39;t think you care anyways&quot; Well, hes right on I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; care. I once heard of a guy in Nektulos forest saying &quot;If I can train a<br/>
&gt; skeleton on you. Then its your problem&quot;. If that is one guy attitude, there<br/>
&gt; must be many others who have this type of attitude too.THat happened when I<br/>
&gt; was in Prexus server playing my necro. I myself have kenna like that, I sit<br/>
&gt; on floor medding and suddenly 2 skeletons jump on me. I was like level 6-7<br/>
&gt; and that meant instant death. Of course the skeletons were not spawned on me<br/>
&gt; but rather trained on me. Since many people have this type of attitude, I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t see why I must care what people say. This is what I think, if a player<br/>
&gt; steals your kills and asks for help later, by all means let him die since he<br/>
&gt; deserves it.<br/>
&gt;     As for reputation, high level wizards are often invited into groups more<br/>
&gt; often than not. Since you can&#39;t make EVERYONE your friend anyways, although<br/>
&gt; its always better to have more friends than enemies. I think most people<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t really care if you have an experience on stealing kill or not. This is<br/>
&gt; so because if you steal kill FROM them they won&#39;t like you. But if you steal<br/>
&gt; kill FOR them, they will all praise you and even want to group with you more<br/>
&gt; because they know who can get the xp and who can&#39;t. However on Loot stealing<br/>
&gt; I have seen ppl being shunt before because they loot a named NPC and run<br/>
&gt; off, ignoring their OWN group members. Loot stealing is absolutely lame, if<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t wanna share your loot, DON&#39;T GROUP and DON&#39;T whine if you can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get the kill. If you want to steal kill, go make a wizard or magician or<br/>
&gt; druid and see how hard it is to get your XP, especially at the lower levels.<br/>
&gt; I have seen a druid which purposely did 50% of damage and let tanks finish<br/>
&gt; it off, so that he could get the xp, and he was soloing. Another time at<br/>
&gt; gnolls, my friend received tells from another group on how he can&#39;t get the<br/>
&gt; kill on the named NPC because that guy had a druid friend which he claimed<br/>
&gt; could outblast him. So my friend ask me to help him get the kill and we did<br/>
&gt; get the named NPC. Of course this resulted in the other group being<br/>
&gt; extremely unhappy and cursed at us. However in the end we still got what we<br/>
&gt; wanted and the other group with nothing.<br/>
&gt;     Just my 2cents worth of opinions.<br/>
