<div id="ygrps-yiv-833851904">omg. Chipokoman (I remember the Southpark one. damn funny. The Japanese<br/>
always say &quot;Your penis is very big. It&#39;s the largest penis I&#39;ve ever<br/>
seen. Our penis are small. So we cannot do anything etc etc&quot;. Then all<br/>
the guys in Southpark have a very funny smile on their face).<br/>

&gt; 1. His aide is in a building you will meet later, but you need to catch 20<br/>
&gt; or more pokemons to get it. The aide is in a room where there are telescopes<br/>
&gt; (I think, can&#39;t remember)<br/>
&gt; 2. You have to find HM like cut to be able to use it and you must teach the<br/>
&gt; HM to a pokemon. Cut is on the captain of the ship.<br/>
&gt; 4.Carry 6 always, it doesn&#39;t hurt to carry those extra pokemons just in case<br/>
&gt; the pokemons faint or you need to counter another pokemon.<br/>
&gt; Water strong against Earth and Fire<br/>
&gt; Thunder strong against water and flying pokemons but weak against earth<br/>
&gt; Fire good against ice but weak against water<br/>
&gt; Earth good against physical attacks like scratch but weak against water<br/>
&gt; Still got some others but I can&#39;t remember, maybe try searching the web.<br/>
&gt; 5.If you complete finish liao, DON&#39;T use the megaball on anything less than<br/>
&gt; a mewtwo, since the megaball is 100% catch. Btw, the blue and red no<br/>
&gt; difference in terms of gameplay, except the different pokemons available and<br/>
&gt; the rarity of a certain pokemon in an area. The final dungeon also same,<br/>
&gt; except for the yellow version where the final dungeon is different.<br/>
