<div id="ygrps-yiv-917570485">I ever teamed with a lvl 22 wiz who did the same thing.  Later a low 20 <br/>
necro join the team and he invited a train of 2 TT, 1 necro, 5-6 ogre and <br/>
mob&#39;s pet (dunno how he did it).  All 5 players in the team kena killed and <br/>
I&#39;m the only one who managed to gate out with 1/2 bubb mana.<br/>
<br/>
Tat wiz later revive inside Derz room and it happened that Derz & her 2 <br/>
necro spawn at that time.  Guess what, he was killed 8 times on a row until <br/>
he pull out his modem line (he come back 2 hrs later and tell me).  He told <br/>
me he lost more than 3 bubb xp and drop a lvl.<br/>
<br/>
I think I better blind outside Najena zone.  The room is always crowded <br/>
with campers, so no way u can gate in and kill (and by the time u gate in, <br/>
pple may have beat Derz to half death liao) ;)<br/>

&gt; there is one thing though, since u wizard, u can bind yourself<br/>
&gt; inside the drelna room, so when it spawn u can immeidiatey tele<br/>
&gt; in without delay n get the kills first.<br/>
