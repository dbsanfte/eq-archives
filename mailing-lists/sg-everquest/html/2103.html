<b>Subject:</b> some little trick <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-514511290">dunno anyone know yet<br/>
but to all those who do not know<br/>
had some magician summon u a moonstone n put in ammo slot<br/>
will give u unlimit ultravision, problem is if u log off it go puff<br/>
here&#39;s the trick, Verent had fix such that when ever they found <br/>
that u went LD and log, it will not make your summon stuff puff<br/>
so when ever u want to log off , do not use camping or quit or exit<br/>
just go to one save zone n off the modem will do, this way<br/>
i get to had all the summon pouch which great for wieght reduce plus <br/>
moonstone that gave unlimit ultravision<br/>
the sword of the ruin and the dagger from high magicain is also pretty<br/>
cool if you r low level and cannot get some high level weapon<br/>
they r better then the combined.<br/>
