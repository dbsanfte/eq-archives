<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315937960">Cool, which part of Japan? I&#39;m only a 13th Monk. However you can stick with<br/>
me and Tavis Trueshot if you want. He sticks with me despite my level. But<br/>
he is going to play a druid now so that he won&#39;t be too high above me. Great<br/>
pal he is. Love him. and he laughs easy, even if he doesn&#39;t understand your<br/>
joke. Hehehe!<br/>
<br/>
Well, the only monks here are me and Yiyang. Why I love monks? 10 reasons I<br/>
guess.<br/>
<br/>
1)I don&#39;t have to worry about those cool looking weapons, armours etc. While<br/>
you people are reaching for those GhoulBane, Bloodforge, Rubicite etc. I<br/>
just need to /ooc &quot;Paying 12pp for Mesh Glove.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
2)After I die, I don&#39;t feel helpless without my arsenal. I fight almost just<br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
3)When you semi-mage guys are thinking &quot;To root or to nuke or ...&quot; I just<br/>
stand there and kick ass and toggle the view points to see if my partner is<br/>
in dire need for help.<br/>
<br/>
4)At higher levels, we &quot;decide&quot; with MOB dies first.<br/>
<br/>
5)Feign Death can be used to lure MOB without its partners coming along. At<br/>
most, you get a mini train.<br/>
<br/>
6)Our STA &quot;never&quot; drops even with continuous fights. While others holding<br/>
heavy weapons have to watch their yellow bar.<br/>
<br/>
7)We need mostly DEX and AGI booasters. Some come at high price like those<br/>
Plat Enchanted jewelries but hey, how many jewel slots have we? 5 I believe.<br/>
&lt;I know this point it closely related to PT 1 but I need to fill the space<br/>
;-)&gt;<br/>
<br/>
8)We smack 5 hits into you before you even lift your weapon.<br/>
Punch,Punch,Punch,Punch,Flying Kick. Oh boy, that hurts. Flying Kick goes<br/>
for 70hps minimum from what I hear.<br/>
<br/>
9)Chicks dig the flying kicks.<br/>
<br/>
10)I&#39;ll let Yiyang fill this. And if he doesn&#39;t ... we don&#39;t pick up &quot;loot&quot;<br/>
only cash. So we don&#39;t have to make runs to the stores.<br/>
<br/>
Wilson. Do call me Wilson. But in-game name&#39;s Yutaka. Take care!<br/>

&gt; i suppose its not easy to raise a char to high level... as i can imagine<br/>
&gt; levelling is exponential... :( in terms of difficulty... anyway... i will<br/>
&gt; concentrate on one char... fer now at least....<br/>
