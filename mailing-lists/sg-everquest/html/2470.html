Another great tactic for making gobs of money is to go to the ranger<br/>
camp in lesser faydark. There are about 8 rangers there that spawn every<br/>
5 minutes and are exactly level 25. These rangers drop 2 weapons that<br/>
can be sold for 15pp there with max cha. Best thing to do is have a dupe<br/>
character waiting there and fill all your inventory up and drop your<br/>
bags and relog and sell to the merchant conveniently placed right inside<br/>
the hut! ANY high level player around 40-44 can easily wipe out the<br/>
entire camp because there&#39;s a huge pathing bug there. Seems like lesser<br/>
faydark is split into several zones and if you run a few paces towards<br/>
the road near the camp the rangers wont follow. Run back toward the hut<br/>
wait a few and they run back at ya. I have personally seen level 49 pets<br/>
just walk in there and kill the whole camp with some help from the<br/>
player though, but for parties or weaker level soloer&#39;s using the<br/>
pathing exploit is great way to make money. Just saying the rangers are<br/>
only 25, have about 700 hp so if youre high one nuke/dot, harmony, lull,<br/>
etc. can easily destroy the camp. If you got a good strategy worked out<br/>
you can milk the camp real nice. Hope I contributed something. Keep up<br/>
the good work.<br/>
