<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278814925">I&#39;m organising a local kakis (NOT GUILD HUNT) casters hunt for the <br/>
following LORE artifacts:<br/>
- Water Crystal Staff (1HB)<br/>
- Runed Totem Staff (2HB)<br/>
- JK Skull (misc)<br/>
(NB: LORE means you can only have ONE in ya backpack AND bank, ie each char <br/>
can only have ONE, extra will be deleted by game)<br/>
<br/>
The looting priority is as follows:<br/>
1. Those who can USE the artifact(s) themselves AND are PHYSICALLY involved <br/>
in the hunting.<br/>
2. Those who are PHYSICALLY involved in the hunting AND hunt it for their <br/>
secondary char.<br/>
3. Those who are PHYSICALLY involved in the hunting AND hunt it for friend <br/>
or cash.<br/>
(NB: Since it&#39;s a lore item, you cannot ask someone who have the artifact <br/>
to loot on your behalf.  U can only ask someone to hunt on ya behalf <br/>
PROVIDED they dun need one, as in #3).<br/>
<br/>
The dangers:<br/>
1. JK Skull & RTS r dropped by the gnolls (high sha and emi) at the zone <br/>
entrance from SK to LR (during the day).  The gnolls, gnoll guards and <br/>
gnoll shamans lvl below 18 I think, but the shaman will heal the high sha <br/>
and emi (both ard lvl 20) when we fight, even thou they themselves are con <br/>
green to us and will not be involved in the fight.  I think those below 15, <br/>
when trying to walk thru the camp, will invite a train of 3+4+3=10 gnolls <br/>
on you! ;)<br/>
The camp will turn to undead ruins at night, where skeletons, greater <br/>
mummies (lvl 23-24) and dry bones (lvl 24-25) will haunt the place.  Again, <br/>
any one below lvl 20 and walk pass the camp may invite a train of undeads <br/>
;)<br/>
=&gt;Our plan is to camp near zone and the high lvls will help to kill the <br/>
mobs and ask those lower lvls to come in to loot.  Of coz, in this case, <br/>
priority will give to those who phyically involved in the fighting 1st ;)<br/>
<br/>
2. Water Crystal Staff<br/>
It&#39;s dropped by a OVERPOWERED lvl 24-26 aqua goblin called Webclaw.  Webbie <br/>
can found in serveral spots in LR.  Its magical hit VERY HARD and is VERY <br/>
AGRO in water, and thing get worse if we enagaed it in the water (we get <br/>
disturbed more often when casting, and swim slower, if we lose, chances is <br/>
that we will get killed and corpse sinks into the deep lake, then corpse <br/>
seeking and looting session will start).  After much investigation (I&#39;ve <br/>
been camping in LR from lvl 20 to 27), I will lead the team to the spawn <br/>
spot of Webbie, which is the tower isle (extreme end from zone, that mean <br/>
there is NO way to flee if we lose UNLESS we bind near zone, gate out and <br/>
zone).  The plan is to root Webbie (btw it also run VERY fast) the moment <br/>
it spawn before it run towards shore.  I&#39;ve tried rooting Web in water (I <br/>
know other spots it shows its face) but seem like a bug will make it <br/>
disappear the moment it is rooted in water (I won&#39;t advise to melee it in <br/>
water unless Garren is coming, coz it&#39;s not funny to search for ya corpse <br/>
in the deep blue lake).<br/>
There is 2 concerns regarding the danger for this hunt:<br/>
a. To get to the tower isle, you have to swim across the whole lake. <br/>
 Danger arise when u meet some giant fresh sharks (bigger size than orge) , <br/>
frogloks, aqua goblin, water snakes, or worse, Webclaw itself and Froglok <br/>
Prince (lvl 30 plus, very powerful, con red, and very very agro, out to <br/>
kill EVERYTHING in lake).  This problem can be overcome by taking a boat <br/>
from gnoll camp to tower isle (but take much longer).<br/>
b. The spawn spot for Webclaw, UNFORTUNATELY, is also the spawn spot of the <br/>
Froglok Prince (lvl 30 plus, very powerful and agro) and a deep sea goblin <br/>
pet (lvl 22 to 25 I think).  With FF and me, it&#39;s no big deal taking Web, <br/>
or even when the pet spawn at the same time.  H/w, SUAY SUAY, if the Prince <br/>
spawn during the fight or come to us, both of us will be the one to gate <br/>
first, since we will have NO fight versus the Prince ;(<br/>
<br/>
This hunting trip is NOT for anyone below 4th circle (even if we buff u to <br/>
full and guard u all time). Unlike the Guk hunt, it&#39;s VERY difficult to <br/>
find ya corpse if u died in lake, and chances is that u will lose ya stuffs <br/>
forever.  To prevent wasting more than half of the time finding/looting <br/>
corpses, this trip is STRICTLY for 4th & above circle chars (lvl 12 for <br/>
casters, not sure for others) only.  Frankly speaking I believe all kakis <br/>
got at least a 4th circle chars, whether primarily or secondary chars. <br/>
 Just dun bring ya newbie char along pls.<br/>
<br/>
LAST NOTE:  This is not a XP or $$$ hunting trip.  There will be no hunting <br/>
of aviak guards etc for xp and coins.  It&#39;s a very task-specific trip - get <br/>
the 3 artifacts for those who need them and get out of the place (I can <br/>
gate to Fay, Tox, NK by then).  Anyone who are impatient while waiting for <br/>
the spawn and turn to hunt others will bear their own risk soloing it (lvl <br/>
20 to 22), coz we will not waste time and mana helping anyone to gain xp <br/>
there.  Webclaw spawn and run very fast from tower to shore, maybe within 5 <br/>
seconds or so, we can&#39;t afford to miss it, given that it&#39;s a rare spawn.<br/>
<br/>
PREPARATION:  Everyone please get ready AT LEAST 40 foods, 40 drinks and 40 <br/>
of your spell reagients (if applicable). I&#39;m trying to make it a sharp and <br/>
sweet fruitful trip, so pls dun come to assembly area then asking for <br/>
food/drink etc.  FF can summon 20 bandages each for those who need (thx <br/>
FF!) but I dun wanna see him wasting time summoning food/drinks unless we <br/>
 really took so long to camp for the stuffs (40 food/drinks can last me 10 <br/>
hrs hunt I think).  FF and I can actually do all these by ourselves but we <br/>
have decided to help all others (esp casters) to get also, so pls do <br/>
everyone a favor by preparing yourself ;)<br/>
<br/>
BINDING:  All casters will bind once they zone into LR.  We then move on to <br/>
arena (which many lamers invis inside and KOS whoever that zone in, it&#39;s <br/>
the only binding zone in the region, sigh).  FF and I will go in to scout <br/>
the entrance to ensure it&#39;s cleared.  We will then take turn to invis <br/>
(guarding) and binding, asking the others to come in one by one.  Once all <br/>
binded, we then go back to gnoll camp and start the hunting.  NO arguement <br/>
on hunting at gnoll camp 1st then bind the non-casters, coz if anyone died, <br/>
they will have to run few zones back to LR and it&#39;s a total WASTE of time. <br/>
 Make it an effective and efficient hunt pls!!!<br/>
<br/>
HUNT PHASE ONE:  Below lvl 20 all sit at zone, above lvl 20s will move in <br/>
to hunt.  Once we got what we want, we continue to hunt and ask those at <br/>
zone come in to loot.<br/>
<br/>
HUNT PHASE TWO:  We will all move to tower isle.  Once there, all lvl 25 <br/>
and above will stay at the mid way of the Webclaw running path, all INVIS. <br/>
 We will root and nuke the mob once it spawn and run towards water.  The <br/>
rest will sit further away to see show and prepare to loot ;)  The lvl 25+ <br/>
will camp at a safe distant from the Prince spawn spot. If Prince spawn, <br/>
just stay invis and let it run to water.  When Web spawn, KILL IT!  If <br/>
Prince spawn when we fighting Webclaw, all GATE.  Those who cannot gate - <br/>
May God bless you ;)<br/>
<br/>
The hunt is scheduled on Friday night (14th August, S&#39;pore/HK time) <br/>
starting at 11pm (tentative plan is 3 hrs hunt), interested parties please <br/>
meet at the Guard Tower at North Karana (just before the zone to SK, at the <br/>
bridge).  Those who dunno the way, pls find someone to bring you there.  I <br/>
personally will be opening a portal from Felwithe Gate at 10.50pm to NK, <br/>
you can tag along my portal if you want ;)<br/>
