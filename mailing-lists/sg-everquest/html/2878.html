<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517830101">Thx brother preve..ops I mean brother BiBi for ya utmost support ;P<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I cant recruit them yet even with ya vote, else our GM will remove <br/>
me, hehehe.<br/>
<br/>
According our great leader, I need to get either of the followings to <br/>
recruit new members:<br/>
<br/>
1. 5 officers.<br/>
2. 2 officers + 5 members.<br/>
<br/>
Can I get some more support from our guys? ;)  Thx!<br/>
<br/>
To strengthen my stand, let me give a more detail description on both <br/>
players.<br/>
<br/>
Yura is well-known as a power-player in my UO guild, and she is one of my <br/>
UO members who established their chars fast yet w/o much assistance except <br/>
some advice and start-up fund.   She is also those hard-working type who is <br/>
willing to spend time in training her chars.<br/>
<br/>
Misty, on the other hand, is a born leader and know how to take care of <br/>
those newer members very much (should I say &quot;motherlike&quot;? hehe). She is <br/>
also very experience in RPG training and very independent.  She actually <br/>
has her RL son, a lvl 40ish monk, and her RL husband, lvl 46 shaman playing <br/>
in the same server.  I would like to get all of them in but due to the big <br/>
difference in timezone, I leave it to u guys to vote.  Of coz I would love <br/>
to get her in, but I also wanan ensure she can contributed and also enjoy <br/>
full benefit & fun if she were to join us.  She is also the first female <br/>
pioneer in my UO guild and work all the way to her vice-GM position.<br/>
<br/>
Talk abt contribution, I&#39;m very sure both of them will be a great asset to <br/>
our guild in time to come ;) So more support pls, thx thx!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve 2 UO friends who join us in EQ Innoruuk.  They are both my closest<br/>
&gt; &gt; buddies in UO Baja, and have gone thru&#39;s numerous live & death battles<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; me in my entire UO life.  Both of them are veteran online RPGers, so <br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; They are Mistaya (lvl 30? wood elf ranger) and Yura (lvl 9 high-elf<br/>
&gt; &gt; enchanter).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mistaya is playing in US time zone, so for those US players, if you are<br/>
&gt; &gt; training ya twink at ya timezone, do consider her as a team member.  ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yura is now staying in Australia, and is playing around S&#39;pore time <br/>
