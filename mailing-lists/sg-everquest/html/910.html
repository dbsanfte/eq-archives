<b>Subject:</b> Female chars in EQ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833215934">Sereph mentioned that he always plays only female chars in RPG.<br/>
Just wonder how many are like him er....her...uh...HIM.  (Subjective)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow...this really breaks my heart...all those babes might not be babes after all...<br/>
below that lacy leather armor lies a hairy chest?? <br/>
Guess I&#39;d better check if Ricecooker is actually male or female...LOL<br/>
<br/>
No offense Sereph...just that you crushed my hopes of finding some medievial virgins and such... *grin*<br/>

  FP far meh? level 6 more than enough to travel there. Just bank everything and sprint to BB and take the boot to FP. The whole journey is pretty much Mob free, my bard made it to FP at level 5-6 I think. <br/>
  And nope, I don&#39;t get on Kali much. My nick there is Garford anyway. I use Sereph ONLY for RPG games <br/>
<br/>
  [Useless fact of the day: I never ever played a male character in an RPG game(be it PnP ones or electronic ones), unless I have no choice in the gender and the 2 most used names are Sabella and Sereph in that order] <br/>
<br/>
  And hell no, I&#39;m not a castration fanatic. I only castrated Enteri as it took him so long to do a task for me and some people I dislike in not so real life. <br/>
<br/>
  Always remember this fact: Sereph is a female name. <br/>
<br/>
  Sereph, door to door parang saleswoman who won&#39;t take no for an answer. <br/>

       When the fish did we have rice cookers??? <br/>
      Since you&#39;re an S&#39;porean, you have already clear part 1 of our joining ritual. You must now make your way over to Freeport for your &quot;parang ceremony&quot; held by me then the trial period where we monitor you. Then we&#39;ll officially accept you as one of us. <br/>
<br/>
      Only when you travel to FP can we aid you and besides, everyone is around FP <br/>
<br/>
      Sereph, your expert in parangs and fast castrations. <br/>
