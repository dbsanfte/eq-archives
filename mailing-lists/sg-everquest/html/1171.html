<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2542881">The caster quest can be found from Halas Shaman guild(The person standing at<br/>
entrance to guild). The goblin caster can be found at igloo located along the<br/>
mountain near the big plain to Permafrost. For lvl 5 shaman , u ned at least 1<br/>
ppl to grp with u to survive, unless u chose to stand on surface and hunt the<br/>
weaker gnolls (Not so good since lots of ppl r doing the same thing and oni 3<br/>
or 4 gnoll spawn there) And be prepared to die a few times since there&#39;s<br/>
always train appearing and they loved to slice up lvl 5 shaman :)<br/>
<br/>
Basically once u reach lvl 5 , u ned to go BB to hunt . No choice here since<br/>
the monsters at everfrost con green when u reach lvl 5.<br/>
