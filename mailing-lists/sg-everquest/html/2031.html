<b>Subject:</b> Named Teant <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800601305">Last night I met this named npc in SK, con blue to me.  This npc drop the <br/>
Teant Stave which has Root effect.<br/>
<br/>
Been greedy and impatient, I start by root it and nuke all the way (b4 <br/>
others see it and start attacking it and when I get the kill call me Kill <br/>
Stealer...).  Normal teant will die after 500-600 dam nuking but this one, <br/>
after nuking for more than 800-1000 dam, is still alive!<br/>
<br/>
After I OOM, die die melee with it, and most tu-long is tat it killed me <br/>
with less than 3% HP!!!  KNN!!!<br/>
<br/>
Shld I be more patient and cast Leatherskin (give me 200HP), I would have <br/>
killed it instead it killed me, sigh.<br/>
<br/>
Been in SK so many times, this is the 1st time I meet this rare spawn.<br/>
<br/>
Just a lesson to share with all - be patient and plan, or we are just <br/>
wasting time looting our corpse.  And remember server down last night?  And <br/>
how big SK is?  I die ard 15 min b4 server down and lucky managed to get my <br/>
corpse back before server down (thanks to my sense direction and loc <br/>
skills), otherwise I cannot sleep ;P<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless I still lost half a bubb xp for this fatal mistake I made - <br/>
another 2 hrs hunting in HH.  The only good thing is tat, been so moody <br/>
after the death, I dun bother to wait for server to come up and play.  In <br/>
the end sleep at 11pm plus and wake up this morning FRESH AND ENERGETIC!!! <br/>
;))<br/>
<br/>
Tonight gonna power train my wiz to 30 b4 the hunts.  I will be in HH keep <br/>
warrior room early, probably b4 8pm, till morning ;)  Die die must lvl!!!!!<br/>

Still tu-long over the incident of letting the teant stave &#39;fly&#39; away from <br/>
his hands....</div>
