<div id="ygrps-yiv-678074648">I like the way u put the whole em&#39; thingy together.<br/>
SO ..when we start.<br/>
Hopefully not to big a crowd. and this time anyone disobey orders or ACT out<br/>
on thiers own will get CHOP !<br/>
<br/>
U have my support as usual. Pls do understand my on-line time limitation.<br/>
I should be able to help 1-2 ppl to lvl up on the Avaiks hunt after or b4<br/>
the expedition<br/>
<br/>
Webclaw spawn at the Avaik Guard Platform with the tower as u mentioned. He<br/>
cast AOE Shock spell. It cons blue to me when i was 23rd lvl and i Could&#39;nt<br/>
take him down, he&#39;s  highly overpowered with skin that absorbs 90 % of my<br/>
hits..  I have to feign death to live. Let me tank this shithead and u<br/>
casters can cast  and nuke him at a distant.<br/>
<br/>
Im currently at lake with Feese..aka Sereph and should be there r a while<br/>

&gt;&gt; I&#39;m organising a local kakis (NOT GUILD HUNT) casters hunt for the<br/>
&gt;&gt; following LORE artifacts:<br/>
&gt;&gt; - Water Crystal Staff (1HB)<br/>
&gt;&gt; - Runed Totem Staff (2HB)<br/>
&gt;&gt; - JK Skull (misc)<br/>
&gt;&gt; (NB: LORE means you can only have ONE in ya backpack AND bank, ie each<br/>
 </span></blockquote>char<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; can only have ONE, extra will be deleted by game)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The looting priority is as follows:<br/>
&gt;&gt; 1. Those who can USE the artifact(s) themselves AND are PHYSICALLY<br/>
 </span></blockquote>involved<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; in the hunting.<br/>
&gt;&gt; 2. Those who are PHYSICALLY involved in the hunting AND hunt it for their<br/>
&gt;&gt; secondary char.<br/>
&gt;&gt; 3. Those who are PHYSICALLY involved in the hunting AND hunt it for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>friend<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; or cash.<br/>
&gt;&gt; (NB: Since it&#39;s a lore item, you cannot ask someone who have the artifact<br/>
&gt;&gt; to loot on your behalf.  U can only ask someone to hunt on ya behalf<br/>
&gt;&gt; PROVIDED they dun need one, as in #3).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The dangers:<br/>
&gt;&gt; 1. JK Skull & RTS r dropped by the gnolls (high sha and emi) at the zone<br/>
&gt;&gt; entrance from SK to LR (during the day).  The gnolls, gnoll guards and<br/>
&gt;&gt; gnoll shamans lvl below 18 I think, but the shaman will heal the high sha<br/>
&gt;&gt; and emi (both ard lvl 20) when we fight, even thou they themselves are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>con<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; green to us and will not be involved in the fight.  I think those below<br/>
 </span></blockquote>15,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; when trying to walk thru the camp, will invite a train of 3+4+3=10 gnolls<br/>
&gt;&gt; on you! ;)<br/>
&gt;&gt; The camp will turn to undead ruins at night, where skeletons, greater<br/>
&gt;&gt; mummies (lvl 23-24) and dry bones (lvl 24-25) will haunt the place.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; any one below lvl 20 and walk pass the camp may invite a train of undeads<br/>
&gt;&gt; ;)<br/>
&gt;&gt; =&gt;Our plan is to camp near zone and the high lvls will help to kill the<br/>
&gt;&gt; mobs and ask those lower lvls to come in to loot.  Of coz, in this case,<br/>
&gt;&gt; priority will give to those who phyically involved in the fighting 1st ;)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; 2. Water Crystal Staff<br/>
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s dropped by a OVERPOWERED lvl 24-26 aqua goblin called Webclaw.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Webbie<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; can found in serveral spots in LR.  Its magical hit VERY HARD and is VERY<br/>
&gt;&gt; AGRO in water, and thing get worse if we enagaed it in the water (we get<br/>
&gt;&gt; disturbed more often when casting, and swim slower, if we lose, chances<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; that we will get killed and corpse sinks into the deep lake, then corpse<br/>
&gt;&gt; seeking and looting session will start).  After much investigation (I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;&gt; been camping in LR from lvl 20 to 27), I will lead the team to the spawn<br/>
&gt;&gt; spot of Webbie, which is the tower isle (extreme end from zone, that mean<br/>
&gt;&gt; there is NO way to flee if we lose UNLESS we bind near zone, gate out and<br/>
&gt;&gt; zone).  The plan is to root Webbie (btw it also run VERY fast) the moment<br/>
&gt;&gt; it spawn before it run towards shore.  I&#39;ve tried rooting Web in water (I<br/>
&gt;&gt; know other spots it shows its face) but seem like a bug will make it<br/>
&gt;&gt; disappear the moment it is rooted in water (I won&#39;t advise to melee it in<br/>
&gt;&gt; water unless Garren is coming, coz it&#39;s not funny to search for ya corpse<br/>
&gt;&gt; in the deep blue lake).<br/>
&gt;&gt; There is 2 concerns regarding the danger for this hunt:<br/>
&gt;&gt; a. To get to the tower isle, you have to swim across the whole lake.<br/>
&gt;&gt;  Danger arise when u meet some giant fresh sharks (bigger size than orge)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; frogloks, aqua goblin, water snakes, or worse, Webclaw itself and Froglok<br/>
&gt;&gt; Prince (lvl 30 plus, very powerful, con red, and very very agro, out to<br/>
&gt;&gt; kill EVERYTHING in lake).  This problem can be overcome by taking a boat<br/>
&gt;&gt; from gnoll camp to tower isle (but take much longer).<br/>
&gt;&gt; b. The spawn spot for Webclaw, UNFORTUNATELY, is also the spawn spot of<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; pet (lvl 22 to 25 I think).  With FF and me, it&#39;s no big deal taking Web,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; spawn during the fight or come to us, both of us will be the one to gate<br/>

 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; full and guard u all time). Unlike the Guk hunt, it&#39;s VERY difficult to<br/>
&gt;&gt; find ya corpse if u died in lake, and chances is that u will lose ya<br/>
 </span></blockquote>stuffs<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; forever.  To prevent wasting more than half of the time finding/looting<br/>
&gt;&gt; corpses, this trip is STRICTLY for 4th & above circle chars (lvl 12 for<br/>
&gt;&gt; casters, not sure for others) only.  Frankly speaking I believe all kakis<br/>
&gt;&gt; got at least a 4th circle chars, whether primarily or secondary chars.<br/>
&gt;&gt;  Just dun bring ya newbie char along pls.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; LAST NOTE:  This is not a XP or $$$ hunting trip.  There will be no<br/>

 </span></blockquote>(lvl<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; 20 to 22), coz we will not waste time and mana helping anyone to gain xp<br/>
&gt;&gt; there.  Webclaw spawn and run very fast from tower to shore, maybe within<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; seconds or so, we can&#39;t afford to miss it, given that it&#39;s a rare spawn.<br/>

&gt;&gt; PREPARATION:  Everyone please get ready AT LEAST 40 foods, 40 drinks and<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; sweet fruitful trip, so pls dun come to assembly area then asking for<br/>
&gt;&gt; food/drink etc.  FF can summon 20 bandages each for those who need (thx<br/>
&gt;&gt; FF!) but I dun wanna see him wasting time summoning food/drinks unless we<br/>
&gt;&gt;  really took so long to camp for the stuffs (40 food/drinks can last me<br/>
 </span></blockquote>10<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; hrs hunt I think).  FF and I can actually do all these by ourselves but<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; have decided to help all others (esp casters) to get also, so pls do<br/>
&gt;&gt; everyone a favor by preparing yourself ;)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; BINDING:  All casters will bind once they zone into LR.  We then move on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; arena (which many lamers invis inside and KOS whoever that zone in, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; the only binding zone in the region, sigh).  FF and I will go in to scout<br/>
&gt;&gt; the entrance to ensure it&#39;s cleared.  We will then take turn to invis<br/>
&gt;&gt; (guarding) and binding, asking the others to come in one by one.  Once<br/>
 </span></blockquote>all<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; binded, we then go back to gnoll camp and start the hunting.  NO<br/>
 </span></blockquote>arguement<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; on hunting at gnoll camp 1st then bind the non-casters, coz if anyone<br/>
 </span></blockquote>died,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; they will have to run few zones back to LR and it&#39;s a total WASTE of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>time.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;  Make it an effective and efficient hunt pls!!!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; HUNT PHASE ONE:  Below lvl 20 all sit at zone, above lvl 20s will move in<br/>
&gt;&gt; to hunt.  Once we got what we want, we continue to hunt and ask those at<br/>
&gt;&gt; zone come in to loot.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; HUNT PHASE TWO:  We will all move to tower isle.  Once there, all lvl 25<br/>
&gt;&gt; and above will stay at the mid way of the Webclaw running path, all<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;  We will root and nuke the mob once it spawn and run towards water.  The<br/>

 </span></blockquote>25+<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; will camp at a safe distant from the Prince spawn spot. If Prince spawn,<br/>
&gt;&gt; just stay invis and let it run to water.  When Web spawn, KILL IT!  If<br/>
&gt;&gt; Prince spawn when we fighting Webclaw, all GATE.  Those who cannot gate -<br/>
&gt;&gt; May God bless you ;)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
