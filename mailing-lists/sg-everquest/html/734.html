<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509809849">Err, I would said it&#39;s worst than CB.  It&#39;s a total failure to team a lvl <br/>
6, a lvl 12 and a lvl 19 - big &quot;generation&quot; gap.  I think we spend more <br/>
than 2-3 hrs in order to get everyone their stuffs back SAFETY at <br/>
commonland/freeport. LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Just imagine a weak wiz like me carrying more than double my STR allows me, <br/>
hehe.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I wont go that CB place until I get invisible spell a lvl 16.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight I&#39;m going to Befallen with 2 HK friends - a lvl 13 bard and a lvl <br/>
13 magi.  Any lvl 12-14 who wanna join us feel free to give me a tell when <br/>
u login.  Advice welcome.  Btw, which lvl is safe for us, considering those <br/>
undead train?<br/>

&gt; I declare the raid to be a total failure. We didn&#39;t get much of what we<br/>
&gt; want and in the end, Gary and I died while trying to get out of<br/>
&gt; Innothule swamp and LKW got lost. We resorted to all sort of funny ways<br/>
&gt; and manage to get our stuff back. (The whole process can be summarised<br/>
&gt; by 1 word, Cheebye)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I took some useless screenshots. Anyone interested, request from me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW, I still need to be power leveled. I got some equipment from Gary(my<br/>
&gt; character&#39;s rear is still bear........) but I still lack levels.<br/>
