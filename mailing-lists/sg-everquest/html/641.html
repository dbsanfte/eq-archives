<div id="ygrps-yiv-583315549">Alamak I also using almost full cloth armor lah. Woven very ex when those<br/>
smelly trolls sell them and the only one i got was a mask which i bought for<br/>
5pp from a wooden elf. As for the magical staff, u can try to get high level<br/>
magicians to sell u a summon one. Most of them would do it for free, but be<br/>
prepared to pay a few gold for them. They are almost same stats as the great<br/>
staff, but magical and nosave. I will try to get you the staff, and i think<br/>
should be easier cos its pending lore and no one would want to get stuck<br/>
with them. bbc is Bone bladed claymore. Its quite sucky actually, -agility i<br/>
think. Only good thing bout it its its damage cos its a 2hander.<br/>

&gt;spell, Lesrec right?).<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;wearing all clothes, no joke ;(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dunno now can I hunt in CB camp for Dvinn or not?  If k, maybe shld try<br/>

&gt;be helpfull..just 10-20pp for each guy back will be nice :PPP<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Anyway,Ive quite lost interest in seeting up a guild anymore ,just asking<br/>
&gt;around if anybody still REALLY want it,maybe we could come up with<br/>
&gt;something and we could ask someguy which is very xperience and highlv chr<br/>
&gt;to guild us...ahem..Garren is now lv17 and loads of stuff...hehe*chuckle*<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Anyway,I was thinking of either using<br/>
&gt;&gt; 1.Monk<br/>
&gt;&gt; 2.Drow wizard<br/>
&gt;&gt; 3.Half-elf Paladin<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Was thinking which class is currently the least used by Singaporeans so I<br/>
&gt;can use and which could solo the best so that I could ....ahem..catch up<br/>
&gt;with garren..hehe....<br/>
