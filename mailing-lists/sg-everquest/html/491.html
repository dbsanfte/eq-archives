<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-76193709">Anyone read the recent EQ review in CGW June issue?<br/>
<br/>
It pointed out that EQ is more of a hack and slash RPG while UO has more <br/>
stuffs other than hack & slash.   Somehow I agree coz seem like I&#39;ve <br/>
nothing much to do other than blasting monsters in EQ, hehe.   Dunno how <br/>
long can this &#39;blasting&#39; will last me in EQ ;)<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I&#39;m having a hard time in Steamfont Mountain after my wiz achieve lvl <br/>
5 via soloing, AGAIN.  As in Felwithe, I&#39;m having a hard time finding a <br/>
good team to gain XP to higher lvl. 90% of the team I mixed so far sux - <br/>
some members even disband and flee when a train of monsters killed our <br/>
tanks and rushed towards the casters, LOL. (Oh remember the name David, <br/>
this guy looted everything in group hunting and said &quot;who loot also nimnd&quot;, <br/>
hehe, and he is always the first one who disband and flee when danger arise <br/>
- his name disappear in group list not becoz he LD but I personally see him <br/>
running off, hehe).<br/>
<br/>
Anyone make a gnomish char?  Need a buddy badly there ;)  If not, I will <br/>
create a TSK or TSH (someone said we need more cleric/shaman chars in <br/>
Prexus guild?) and solo all the way - ie make the darkest evil char.  Kinda <br/>
sian finding pple to team with.  Been a lawful good char in UO, maybe it &#39;s <br/>
time to make a chaotic evil one in EQ, wahahahaha!<br/>
<br/>
Btw, Leshrec, need to check with u.  Regarding ya DEN, do u intend to <br/>
role-play evil or intend to &quot;turn over a new leave&quot; (ie improve ya faction <br/>
with other races)?  Anyone ever think of building a high lvl EVIL char and <br/>
wipe off an npc town? hehehe.<br/>
