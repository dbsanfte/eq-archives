<b>Subject:</b> PLay EQ and think UO <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900325568">When I play EQ, somehow it will always remind me of my UO experience. <br/>
 After playing UO for so long, all veteran players do recognise the fact <br/>
tat OPPORTUNITIES (so called bugs/exploits) are hard to come by and once it <br/>
arises, we will try our best to make full use of it (b4 it is FIXED). <br/>
 Nope, I&#39;m not referring to duping or hacking stats.  I&#39;m talking abt those <br/>
skills which used to be easy to max out initially but later made difficult <br/>
to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Right now we have 2 great guides on brewing and pottery, I think all better <br/>
treasure this oppporities and max them out.  Who know EQ may twist the 2 <br/>
skills later and make them as difficult to train as smithing and make them <br/>
one of the most profitable skills around?<br/>
<br/>
In ever-revoluting online games like EQ and UO, nothing is impossible.  No <br/>
matter how easy or difficult to trade as trade skill, I will always try to <br/>
master it when opportunity arises.  I thank Ebon for the great guide on <br/>
pottery, and I will try it on pretty soon.  The only problem I may <br/>
encounter is where to train pottery within Dfaydark zone?  I&#39;m bind to PF <br/>
and gate to GF for supplies/unloading.  This is the only place I can go.  I <br/>
know FP is a good places to train all skills but meantime I will have to <br/>
find means to do it in GF.  Any suggestion where to buy the raw materials & <br/>
stuffs?  Same for smithing.  I dun seem to find any npc smithing vendors in <br/>
Felwithe.  How abt the woodelf city?  Jeeze, dun tell me I gotta run all <br/>
the way to gnome or dwarf city man!<br/>
