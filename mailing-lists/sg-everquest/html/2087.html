<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320491132">We have achieved success! This quest is currently doable.<br/>
<br/>
The following are the components needed for the quest...<br/>
<br/>
Initial Stage Components:<br/>
<br/>
3 Honeycombs (from bixie corpses) and 5 gold TO GET Honey <br/>
Jum(LORE) in Rivervale.<br/>
<br/>
1 Innoruuk&#39;s Kiss of Death(LORE) bought in Erudin TO GET 1 <br/>
Erud&#39;s Tonic(LORE) in Erudin.<br/>
<br/>
2nd Stage components:<br/>
<br/>
Honey Jum(LORE) as above.<br/>
<br/>
Erud&#39;s Tonic(LORE) as above.<br/>
<br/>
Kiola Nut bought in Ocean of Tears, Sisterhood Island for 2 gold.<br/>
<br/>
Koalindl Fish(LORE) from Koalindl fish corpses. These fish can <br/>
only be found in Qeynos&#39; Temple of Life. Killing these fish to get <br/>
their corpses will cause faction to go down with Qeynos Guards, <br/>
Clerics of Life and the god Rodcet Nife himself. I have heard <br/>
rumours that fishing in the temple lake can sometimes drag up one <br/>
of these fishes, but a high skill is required. Whether this is true, <br/>
and exactly what &quot;high&quot; means, I do not know. Perhaps any <br/>
master fishers might like to try?<br/>
<br/>
3rd Stage Component:<br/>
<br/>
Barkeeps&#39; Compendium(LORE)(NODROP) from Gregor in East <br/>
Freeport, who wants the Honey Jum, Erud&#39;s Tonic, Kiola Nut and <br/>
Koalindl Fish for the book.<br/>
<br/>
After getting the book, this stage involves making a run to Oggok, <br/>
where there are LOTS of big, ugly (and very red) ogres, and giving <br/>
this book to Clurg the bartender there. He will then cough up a <br/>
Stein.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After much hunting by our scavenger team comprising Einan, <br/>
Leshrec and Ziltus, led by Sereph and myself, we managed to get <br/>
1st and 2nd stage components.<br/>
<br/>
Our FedEx operative Ziltus then pieced together all these pieces <br/>
and passed them to my Enchanter waiting in Freeport. I then <br/>
exchanged the four 3rd stage items to get the Barkeeps&#39; <br/>
Compendium(NODROP), ran to Oggok, where I &quot;became&quot; a Dark <br/>
Elf, waltzed in to see Clurg, cast Alliance to improve my faction, <br/>
and made the exchange. Then, I gated outta there faster than you <br/>
can say &quot;stinky ogre ass&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The only worry I have is this negative faction with Kazon <br/>
Stormhammer, the Dwarven King.<br/>
<br/>
So, all you kakis who want to get their hands on a Stein, better <br/>
start hunting those stage 1 and 2 components. (We&#39;ve got lots of <br/>
Kiola Nuts though...)<br/>
<br/>
It also seems a good source of income. I believe the Steins can <br/>
easily go for 400 plat a pop, probably more. Hey, Fedex Ziltus... <br/>
need some extra cash? *heh*<br/>

Get me a gas mask, quick!!!<br/>
