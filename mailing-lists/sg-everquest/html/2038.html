<b>Subject:</b> RE: URGENT!!!! Major change to Stein quest coming!!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-497215876">Since it&#39;s a throwaway char, I will make a human wiz (always wanna test how <br/>
fast a human can lvl up).  Based on my gnome wiz and woodelf druid <br/>
experience, one can hit lvl 4 easily in one night training of 3-4hrs at <br/>
most.<br/>
<br/>
So where are we having this newbies bashing?  How abt this coming Mon? <br/>
 Everyone make a human char in Qeynos and start hunting fishes? <br/>
 Hahahahahah ;)<br/>
<br/>
Seem like we have lots of intereting activities, hehe.<br/>

&gt; I have just read on EQ Enchanters that the Koalindl fish corpse is<br/>
&gt; now a NODROP item on the test servers!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This means that anyone who wants to complete the quest MUST<br/>
&gt; take the major faction hits that come with killing the fish! Now that<br/>
&gt; it is NODROP, no more mule character to take faction hits then<br/>
&gt; transfer to your main character...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A bit of back ground about the fish... when you kill it, Qeynos<br/>
&gt; Inhabitants, Barbarians, even RODCET NIFE himself, not just his<br/>
&gt; clerics, drop faction with you, and because the corpse doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; always load, this means that you might have to kill it several times,<br/>
&gt; and will quickly become KOS to these factions. (Maybe Rodcet will<br/>
&gt; throw down lightning bolt to strike thee down? *heh*)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, we had better start camping for that fucking fish with our group<br/>
&gt; of level 3 mules (fish is level 2 to 3) before they implement the<br/>
&gt; change on the actual servers! Don&#39;t care when you want to do the<br/>
&gt; quest, just fucking snatch as many fish corpse from under the<br/>
&gt; nose of Rodcet first!!!! That is the HARDEST part of the quest!!! We<br/>
&gt; better get our asses moving before the next patch comes along!!!!<br/>
&gt; KNN!!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unless, of course, you all dowan this 7/43 1H blunt wpn that gives<br/>
&gt; +10INT +5DEX... blah blah that is the Stein of Moggok...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I suggest this... we all create throwaway characters in Qeynos,<br/>
&gt; level them up to 3 or so, and we group to smack fishes. It should<br/>
&gt; be fun too, imagine a horde of level 1 &quot;newbies&quot; swarming Qeynos<br/>
&gt; hunting grounds...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This group must be well planned, however, with a proper mix of<br/>
&gt; classes to optimise our abilities... and if possible, make all human,<br/>
&gt; level up faster...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Love is in the air...<br/>
&gt; Get me a gas mask, quick!!!<br/>
