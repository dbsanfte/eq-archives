&gt; &gt; 3. The deceiver mask (cant remember exact name, turn u to &gt; <br/>
&gt; DE). Dropped by<br/>
&gt; &gt; lower guk assasin.  Anyone got map to the spot? Also how tough is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; assasin?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; about 35 and he can backstab for 80 X 2 and drops guise of the deceiver (brd<br/>
&gt; rog wearable +12 cha (?) +7 sv magic ac4) as common and serrated bone dirk,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I personally know of a L50 Human cleric on Innoruuk (Grifter) who <br/>
owns such a mask. When I did a who and saw him in the list <br/>
described as a Dark Elf, I asked him what was up.<br/>
<br/>
He told me he had a mask that would cast Illusion: Dark Elf when <br/>
activated. (The mechanism is the same as the fabled Journeyman <br/>
boots.) He may not have been wearing it, but he definitely could <br/>
use it.<br/>
