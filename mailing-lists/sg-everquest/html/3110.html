<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813673128">I&#39;m also innocent.  I just come back from a 2 week trips and this thing <br/>
happened out of nowhere.  No body wanan tell me what happened (I asked in <br/>
private many times, pple either tell me they dunno or just dun wanna talk <br/>
abt it), yet I kena screwed for nothing (damn u BB, soemore I&#39;m the 1st on <br/>
ya screw list, hehe).<br/>
<br/>
Whatever happened is over.  What Alex said is true, S&#39;pore is such a small <br/>
world, why fight amg ourselves.  That&#39;s the reason why I setup the <br/>
SG_Online_RPGers mailing list for our local kakis, hopefully we can share <br/>
MMORPG info and help one another in the game, and hopefully get as many <br/>
S&#39;porean as possible to join the same server whenever possible.  To <br/>
subscribe, pls send an empty mail to:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SG-Online-RPGers-subscribe@egroups.com">SG-Online-RPGers-subscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>
(Wowow, thx for the opportunity to advertise my list, muhahahahah!!!)  But <br/>
I&#39;m telling the truth?  When if all the S&#39;porean players join a server, we <br/>
are still a minority (just like s&#39;pore on earth, so small), we got more and <br/>
better target out there to fight, why fight mg ourselves???<br/>
<br/>
Anyway to be frank lah, I hope we dun forget why we setup the guild in the <br/>
1st place.  Ask yaself, are we closer or further from our initial <br/>
objective?  For me, my objective to form a guild is simple: to gather all <br/>
local kakis and help one another, to promote the reputation of S&#39;porean <br/>
players in the server.  Like in UO, there are certain very good <br/>
Korean/Japan players when the game first started, so when we talked abt <br/>
them, we know they are good.  Same here, I really hope that when pple talk <br/>
of S&#39;porean players one day, they think we are good and reputatable.<br/>
<br/>
There is no right or wrong in this arguement, since I dunno what is wrong <br/>
and why the damn thing started in the first place (KNN CCB KNS OCBC POSB <br/>
DBS CPF PCB etc to those who start this thing, get me screwed for nothing <br/>
and didnt tell me why, LOL).  Either we all forget abt it, let bygones be <br/>
begones, be good friends again (well, I&#39;m sure we will meet again in <br/>
Horizon) or let meet somewhere else in RL and settle everything once and <br/>
for all ;)  At least this is better than letting the whole Inno population <br/>
know that within a S&#39;porean founded grp, S&#39;poreans fight amg ourselves ;((<br/>
<br/>
SOMEONE TELL ME WTF IS HAPPENING???<br/>
<br/>
Zil.<br/>
<br/>
p/s: Also, where to read the k-po postings?  Which board? ;P<br/>
