<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367470904">Just to make some noise here: Need tips to kill PA in Kedge Keep with 1 <br/>
team:<br/>
<br/>
1. What is the best combo of this team, average lvl?<br/>
2. Is the eye pulling method a bannable offence (ie use eye spell to pull <br/>
PA to zone in).<br/>
3. Alternatively is to invis all the way to ledge, how siong is it to kill <br/>
the 4 SS, guardians and PA?<br/>
4. Anything to watch out when fighting PA and its kakis?<br/>
5. I thinking of parking a druid at KK zone in, with max 125 tracking <br/>
skill, I wonder if he can track PA from zone in or have to swim deeper to <br/>
track?  Is it true that all mobs in KK cannot see invis except guardians <br/>
and PA?  Is there any safe room near PA where I can invis a druid and park <br/>
there to check if PA is up?  If k, then it&#39;s better to track 1st then call <br/>
grp than the other way round.<br/>
<br/>
Thx.<br/>
<br/>
