<b>Subject:</b> Teleport bug for wiz ;) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590500030">From Dr Twister msg board:<br/>
<br/>
Within the last 4 patches, Verant has created a new bug involving <br/>
teleports. Apparently if you portal (Wiz or druid, not the normal &quot;Gate&quot; <br/>
spell) within the same zone you become trapped in the zone and unable to <br/>
zone out, unless you gate out or log. When you try to zone, it puts you in <br/>
the zones &quot;safe&quot; spot.<br/>
<br/>
Quick example to test this is in Greater Faydark cast Fay Gate or Fay <br/>
portal (the bug affects group members) and then try to zone into lesser <br/>
faydark.<br/>
<br/>
Obvously, there are some exploits connected to this problem in zones like <br/>
North Karana, where you can &quot;zone&quot; the mob and get teleported far away for <br/>
a free rest.</div>
