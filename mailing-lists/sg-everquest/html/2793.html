<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065767115">I&#39;m actually happy to see most EQ local players, if not all, are united <br/>
even across different servers.<br/>
<br/>
I heard a sad news last night from one of my UO local kakis.  Some S&#39;pore <br/>
players play in Hotuko (something like tat, a Japanese server but give <br/>
pretty good connection for most local players).  Few days back my kakis <br/>
found a house which is going to decay, so he stay there to place a house. <br/>
 Later some S&#39;pore players and Jap players come.  Those S&#39;pore players who <br/>
come, know my friend is also a local player, kill him so they can place a <br/>
house at the spot, and the Jap players laugh at them fighting amg their own <br/>
country man, sigh.<br/>
This news really upset me.  I dun understand why our own countrymen have to <br/>
fight amg ourselves and become others&#39; laughting stocks.<br/>
If anyone of you also play in UO, pls dun fight ya own countrymen unless <br/>
both are role-playing good and evil parties.  If other country players (eg <br/>
Jap, they are very unite) can unite even in a game, I dun see why we S&#39;p  <br/>
orean, can&#39;t do that.<br/>
