<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579698128">HELLO GUYS!!!<br/>
<br/>
First thing first, marriage life is SOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDD.  Now I <br/>
know why BB always stop gaming so early, coz there are so many things else <br/>
to do at the later part of the night, kkekekekekek ;P<br/>
<br/>
Anyway the honor is mine.  Thx a million to u guys from coming to my <br/>
wedding dinner.  I really enjoy myself very much during the dinner (and <br/>
after the dinner of coz, kekekeke ;P).  I&#39;m also pretty surprised to meet u <br/>
guys coz u guys dun &#39;fit&#39; into my imagination, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Eg Merns - handsome dark-tone model-like young man, I really can&#39;t imagine <br/>
this young man pulling train and cause so many deaths, muhahahhaha ;P. <br/>
 Massiah - KNN also handsome but more to playboy style.  Dunno whether if <br/>
he is telling me the truth when he say he dun really speak up much.  Perhap <br/>
his seducive face already do all the talking, hehe.  Anson, he looks too <br/>
young to have achieve so much in RL, in term of career.  Like a student but <br/>
already doing own business. KNN baby face woman pker, hehe.  Kellendil, i <br/>
think I didnt remember u wrongly, the one with sexy moustache?  I think you <br/>
must be always hanging at Mdm Wond seducing those young gals.  Gala - Wah <br/>
liao, look youngest ah!  Another woman seducer with baby face.  Leshrec - <br/>
no wonder once college open, never see ya face.   Got the height and look, <br/>
I think if ah qua come also kena attracted by u, kekek.  Last but not <br/>
least, our big brother BiBi - face of &#39;satistifed&#39; married man with <br/>
happiness all over his face - I guess I will follow his foot step very <br/>
soon, muhahahah ;P<br/>
<br/>
Thx to Garren and Tri for the blessings.  I might be cutting my gaming a <br/>
bit but dun worry I cut down too much.  My wife already know my style many <br/>
yrs ago and as long as I dun overplay, she won&#39;t nag at me, hehe.  Frankly <br/>
speaking, I really think we shld come out for a gathering every now and <br/>
then, like my UO kakis (some also in D2 and EQ).  Even it&#39;s just a coffee <br/>
talk-cock-sing-song session, it will help to bring us closer and understand <br/>
one another.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, thx a million to all u guys who have fork out your precious <br/>
time to attend my wedding dinner.  I hope very soon we will have an <br/>
opportunity to attend another kakis&#39;s wedding dinner ;)<br/>
<br/>
Ziltus (de married man)<br/>
<br/>
p/s: Zan, I&#39;m in office now.  Tonight I will help u clear NM act 3 & 4 so u <br/>
can join BB in hell ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just thought I&#39;d let everyone know that Ziltus has<br/>
&gt; &gt; been happily married<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; today to a pretty lady he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; now calls his wife! (officially at least)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It was a fun time for all of us who attended as we<br/>
&gt; &gt; finally got to put<br/>
&gt; &gt; faces<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to all the nicks we&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; calling each other by online. FYI...Galarion,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kellendil, Merns, Leshrec,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bibi, Massiah and myself (Zanderion)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; were there and in fact all of us except Bibi (who<br/>
&gt; &gt; was busy with wife) went<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for a drink at the nearby<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Starbucks after the dinner.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Recalling the good old times and just chatting<br/>
&gt; &gt; about gaming brought back<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; many good memories and funny<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; conversation. Pity Ziltus wasn&#39;t able to join us<br/>
&gt; &gt; much but i&#39;m sure he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; happily busy right now kekekeke!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh and we missed you too Fesse! Were hoping we<br/>
&gt; &gt; could see you and put a<br/>
&gt; &gt; face<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to that sexy Dark Elf butt i&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; been staring at soooo mucchhh!!!!! Oh well there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; always a next time!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, this is also a chance for those of you<br/>
&gt; &gt; who weren&#39;t there to give<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; him your congrats! :)<br/>
