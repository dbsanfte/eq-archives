maintain a list here:<br/>

Btw, we play in Asia server, channel &quot;Singapore&quot; (this channel is on most <br/>
of the time, many local players).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tested both USeast and USwest server, seem like it&#39;s not much better <br/>
than Asia.  Probably becoz there are many more players now than stress test <br/>
(but still have to blame that Korean server, down more than 1/2 of the <br/>
time).  Seem like the &#39;server down&#39; is becoz of our connection and not the <br/>
real server down.  Someone say if u cannot open a game, try to join a <br/>
Korean game then quit and create your own one will help.<br/>
<br/>
Btw Les and I in act 3 liao.  As I didn&#39;t find much goodies, I spend most <br/>
of my money buying swords and test out their dam.  My last buy is a great <br/>
helm, 22k which drain me dry up totally.  Btw, all my resis is zero, my <br/>
gears are mainly with fastest run/walk, fastest hit recovery, increase <br/>
chances getting magical items, life regeneration and attacker kena hit by <br/>
spikes kind, no resis type.  Maybe becoz of that I use TONS of potions, esp <br/>
healing potions.  For every big fights (I use ard 10 healing potions). <br/>
 Does resis really help?<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes, seem like it&#39;s more powerful using 1 fast/heavy dam weap than 2 <br/>
very fast/medium dam weap?  Also swords got more varity right?  My barb <br/>
only train in sword mastery...<br/>

p/s: Les, I just noticed the crystal sword only has 10 druability, no <br/>
wonder it breaks down so often.  But its dam is the highest I got so far.</div>
