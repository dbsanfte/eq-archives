<b>Subject:</b> RE: Change of name <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347915862">Not to discourage u but using this kinda non-fantasy name, it may be <br/>
changed by GM w/o ya knowledge, I read quite a few mails of such incidents <br/>
happening.  My RL friend, also kena name change by GM when he use a goon <br/>
name (something meaningless in RL, like those u select).  GM told him &quot;Very <br/>
creative name but not suitable, let me change it for you&quot;.  He is still <br/>
lucky tat GM tell him personally, but many others&#39; name kena change w/o <br/>
notice.  They just login and find themselves &#39;another person&#39; ;)  Those <br/>
pple who kena complaints alot - esp those who make a name for the trade <br/>
skill service they provide, their customers no longer recognise or able to <br/>
find him.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, GM didnt give my friend a choice when changing his name, he just give <br/>
him a msg, change his name (using the random name engine I guess) and <br/>
*poof*, gone! ;)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

p/s: FYI, Garren&#39;s 2nd name is Irongrip, but I myself see another tank in <br/>
Lake Rathetear call Irongrip, ONLY Irongrip (1st name).  I thot you cannot <br/>
select a 2nd name which other use it as a 1st name but seem like I&#39;m wrong. <br/>
 Anyway I have no intention to get a 2nd name now, I enjoy the secrective <br/>
indentity, esp when some lvl 20 casters behave yaya until they see my <br/>
spells, hahahaha ;)  For those who wanna get or gonna get a 2nd name, try <br/>
to create a dummy char using that name 1st, at least it&#39;s safer.  So now <br/>
there is 2 Irongrip in Innoruuk, I really dunno why these sex pervert like <br/>
to &quot;grip&#39; so much, hehe.<br/>
