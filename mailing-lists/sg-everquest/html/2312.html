&gt;<br/>
&gt;Reasons for them NOT being able to get a kill<br/>
&gt;1. They are stupid asses who prolly don&#39;t even know their way around<br/>
&gt;Norrath, and they prolly get their level from friends who twink and level<br/>
&gt;them. In other words, LOSERS<br/>
&gt;2. They are Dark Elves. Low Wisdom High Int in the end got mana to nuke but<br/>
&gt;get no kill cause they DUNNO how to nuke.<br/>
&gt;P.S. Guild is called Order of black STAFF so if you see them, don&#39;t bother<br/>
&gt;trying to share kills, just take everything =)<br/>

&gt;&gt;Venue - Treant Camp<br/>
&gt;&gt;Kakis Party - Ziltus (32 HE wiz), Leshrec (31 HE wiz), Zanderion (31 HE<br/>
&gt;&gt;magi)<br/>
&gt;&gt;Opposition Party - Nanxxxxx (40 DE wiz), Maar (31 DE wiz), Fatez (30 wiz)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;3 of us is chopping trees happily at camp, while this Fatez come over to<br/>
&gt;&gt;join.  Frankly speaking, at lvl 32 I dun get XP for some of the trees<br/>
&gt;&gt;chopped (2 persons I still get xp from ALL trees).  Thus, we told him we<br/>
&gt;&gt;are unable to accpet him.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Next round, Fatez start to nuke after we casted, and he get a kill.  Fine,<br/>
&gt;&gt;we said, if he capable of FFA, so shall it be (NOTE: We have no objection<br/>
&gt;&gt;against FFA, but we hate pple use us to tank for them to hunt for xp).  So<br/>
&gt;&gt;next round, we let him take both.  In the end, he almost died and we nuke<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;bit.  I even bandage him and explain to him why we cant let him joined.<br/>
&gt;&gt; This bastard say yes, and YET after he recover, he KS again! WTF?  In the<br/>
&gt;&gt;end, Les/Zan take front tree, I take back tree, he get nothing.  He then<br/>
&gt;&gt;started to curse and sweat me, no big deal, I see lots of cry babies like<br/>
&gt;&gt;him all the time, but really sux to see a wiz like him cry, LOL.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;After seeing no response from me, he threatened me to get his lvl 40 wiz<br/>
&gt;&gt;friends come.  No big deal, I told our guys, and Les said the most we<br/>
 </span></blockquote>leave<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;if that lvl 40 wiz get all kills lor.  Anyway Fatez also won&#39;t get any xp<br/>
&gt;&gt;teaming with lvl 40.  So we stayed and waited.  Asshole really called a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lvl<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;40 & a lvl 31 wiz, all 3 from same guild called Order of the Black &quot;Cocks&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;(ok it&#39;s not cocks, but they are so stupid tat we called them cocks).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;So...War of Century Nuking started!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Been a lvl 40 wiz, that DE is casting using the same spells we are using<br/>
&gt;&gt;(most powerful lvl 29 dd spells), but that spell dam rise with lvl.  By<br/>
&gt;&gt;right, he shld have won all the kills.  In the end, guess wat?  We got<br/>
 </span></blockquote>more<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;than 95% of the kills! LOL!  It&#39;s really no faces for a grp of 3 wiz (lvl<br/>
&gt;&gt;40, 31, 30) to lose kill to a grp of 2 wiz (lvl 32/31) /1 magi (lvl 31),<br/>
&gt;&gt;esp Zan is doing more like a traffice control in the camp (to kill<br/>
&gt;&gt;wandering animals to prevent them blocking our target).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;To me, it&#39;s just a very simple tricks that we are doing, but I&#39;m not going<br/>
&gt;&gt;to disclose here ;)  More like a common sense for nukers but the 3 DE wiz<br/>
&gt;&gt;dun seems to know it, which make us ponder how they get their lvl, esp the<br/>
&gt;&gt;lvl 40 wiz.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Funny thing is that after an hr or so, that lvl 40 wiz started to msg me,<br/>
&gt;&gt;saying he gave up and asking how we win kills (Les and me always cast b4<br/>
&gt;&gt;them).  Of coz I wont say lah, since that grp got no honor, heal them help<br/>
&gt;&gt;them still fight with us.  So we make up of 2 stupid reasons, which they<br/>
&gt;&gt;believe at least one of them:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;1. Our guild has pool resources of 1000k pp, and buy this artifact from<br/>
 </span></blockquote>GM.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; This artifact works like HT, and it allows us to get kills most of the<br/>
&gt;&gt;time. LOL.<br/>
&gt;&gt;2. When asked abt how we cast faster, I told him we got OC10 (I also dunno<br/>
&gt;&gt;what&#39;s tat, Zan taught me to sian), which is pipeline for internet, blah<br/>
&gt;&gt;blah blah, and we see mobs 1-2 secs b4 them, and that&#39;s why we won most of<br/>
&gt;&gt;the kills.  This they believed.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I&#39;m right - after I told them, 3 bastards still try to fight for kills,<br/>
&gt;&gt;LOL.  And of coz, they lost all.  In the end the lvl 40 & lvl 31 wiz left,<br/>
&gt;&gt;left that fu*ker Fatez, who still hang ard for 30 min or so, trying to get<br/>
&gt;&gt;a kill.  In the end we gloat and suan him alot, he so pissed that he said<br/>
&gt;&gt;he wanna beat us up in RL, LOL.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Never been my EQ life I feel so shiok wining a lvl 40 wiz, good work guys.<br/>
&gt;&gt;FYI, I&#39;m using only 56k and Les 28k/32k.  We all know Les got a slow<br/>
 </span></blockquote>system<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;yet he also cast b4 that grp, really solid!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Funny thing is that Les and me are not KSer, yet we can do it very well.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Shld we KS, I believe we will get better loot and higher lvls.  But alas,<br/>
&gt;&gt;KS is not our cup of tea ;)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The fact that it&#39;s a grp of HE (lower INT, lower LVL, less nukers) wons a<br/>
&gt;&gt;grp of DE (higher INT, higher LVL, more nukers) make the victory a special<br/>
&gt;&gt;one.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;LONG LIVE HIGH ELVES!!!<br/>
