<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494152025">Any faction hit for killing that hermit?  Does he got other kakis with him? <br/>
 He uses spell or melee?  How often is the dropping of FS weap?  Hehe I&#39;m <br/>
interest leh, can loot and gate back to GF to sell to those newbies (lots <br/>
of them, hehe).<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I dun understand why certain item are so damn exp in the game. Compare <br/>
FS and normal weap, the dam difference is not that great right?  Same for <br/>
netted armor and woven armor, the ac at most is plus 1 or 2 more only, <br/>
dunno why pple willing to pay so much for them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, heck care man, most impt is to sell the loot at good price, hehe.<br/>

&gt; something...<br/>
&gt; check out the hermit living in South Karana. He&#39;s dropped FS Long sword, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>FS<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Short sword,<br/>
&gt; FS 2 handed Sword before. They&#39;re expensive at npcs right if u try to buy<br/>
&gt; them? Was thinking of selling<br/>
&gt; them to PCs but i think those damned ppl nowadays all twinked..who even<br/>
&gt; wants them man? Unless<br/>
&gt; i  can find good low lvl chars to sell to in maybe more newbie<br/>
&gt; territory..i&#39;ll just sell to NPC loh..no choice.<br/>
&gt; Any ideas? Need cash as always...sigh... BTW..that hermit is lvl 20 FYI.<br/>
