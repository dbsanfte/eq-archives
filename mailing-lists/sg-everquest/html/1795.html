<b>Subject:</b> Re: SG kakis guild, MUST READ and MUST reply. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-89659960">Though I&#39;m not a SG but I supposed I&#39;m welcome to join? ;)  Anyway, here goes my 2 <br/>
cent :<br/>
<br/>
I will join the new guild with my new char Soraman who currently stuck in Halas for his <br/>
new life --&gt; Brothers of Trifrost<br/>
<br/>
I have a pretty funny idea(to me), can we have the same surname within the guild?  <br/>
Of course, in that case u have to be lvl 19- to join the guild.  However, I really think it is <br/>
a good idea.. :)<br/>
<br/>
As for the recruiting procedure, I think there should be at least 3 to 5 ppl in the guild <br/>
who say yes to get a new one join.<br/>
<br/>
Well... I dun care who is incharge.  The person should devote some of his/her time to <br/>
organize killing/auction event.  QHD is too inactive.  Sigh.....<br/>
<br/>
For the website, I have a personal website(around 20M) from my ISP that is <br/>
untouched.  If u want, I can offer it to u BUT i&#39;m not good at website design.<br/>

&gt;General opinion of our SG kakis, whose names shall be hidden, states<br/>
&gt;that we, want a SG kaki guild, by next week.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why? Shouldn&#39;t QHD be enough? Could be the question you are going to<br/>
&gt;throw at me later, and I&#39;ll answer them AGAIN.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;QHD has several lamers these days, and on top of that, it&#39;s hyper<br/>
&gt;inactive in activities. When was the last time, the guild got together<br/>
&gt;to do something? It acts more like a glorified shout channel. Also, when<br/>
&gt;we are planning kakis only activities and have to resort to guildsay to<br/>
&gt;communicate, random goons might join in, and ruin the experience for us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As a result, I propose that we get this thing together and prepare for<br/>
&gt;the guild formation by Wednesday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Basically, what I want you to do is answer this question:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Quit QHD and form a local kaki guild, yay or nay?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then these question if you say yay:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Who should be the goondu in charge?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Who should be the officals for recruiting?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The charter, who is willing to type it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Website, for the thousand time, anyone can get one ASAP?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Recruting guidlines, think, and give me your opinion.<br/>
