<b>Subject:</b> Ogre Shaman or Barby Warrior? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369237757">Hey there!<br/>
<br/>
My cousin plays a Barby Warrior and a Ogre Shaman. Level 9 I think.<br/>
<br/>
However, he doesn&#39;t know which one has a &quot;greater&quot; future. He plays only on Saturdays though. So he wants one whereby he can level to the 40s faster.<br/>
<br/>
I do know Ogres are more stupid than Barbies but I&#39;d still like a feedback?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</div>
