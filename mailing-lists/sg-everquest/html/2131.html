<b>Subject:</b> Argh... I lost the Dwarven Ringmail Tunic <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057890325">was transferring armor and stuff from Einan to Febon,<br/>
accidentally drop the tunic and i didnt notice.<br/>
<br/>
went off to do the transferring in private and couldnt find the tunic,<br/>
went back to bank and saw a lvl 8 warrior wearring one(he didnt<br/>
have one before), told me he bought it for 10 gp and when i told <br/>
him it might be mine , he said he bought it 4 days ago.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry , very sorry , will try to get one back as soon as possible.<br/>
