&gt;Finally I found some very good spots to hunt and lvling again, killing <br/>
&gt;guards.  No, not killing evil guards, their spawns sux like hell. <br/>
&gt; Wandering Nek forest one of the nights with FF, Fes and Feb, only whimpy <br/>
&gt;guards, no dragoons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Today I read tat at lvl 30-35, it&#39;s best to kill good guards, LOL.  See <br/>
&gt;those dwarf npc merchant in Buthcerblock? KILL THEM!  See the fisherman in <br/>
&gt;the port?  KILL THEM!!!  They dropped 2H axe tat can be sold for 22pp. <br/>
&gt; Pple just need to hunt 10 days and they get 10,000pp!  Talk abt faction, <br/>
&gt;who care?  Verant make it such that killing these npcs will not affect <br/>
&gt;faction of similar race npc in elsewhere (eg u kill dawrf at dock but wont <br/>
&gt;get KOS in dwarf city).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One of the main attractions tat EQ used to attract me is alighnment policy, <br/>
&gt;just like my good old D&D games.  Now the faction thingy is so broken that <br/>
&gt;we have to follow everyone to kill good races npc.  Sigh, at least killing <br/>
&gt;innocent npc in UO DOES give a REAL faction (so call karma and title hit) <br/>
&gt;hit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What? U insist not to follow the rest to kill good races npc?  Ah, then get <br/>
&gt;prepared to kena KS by those powerlvl gamers...Where else can casters solo <br/>
&gt;hunting and lvling?  Yes...those 1-3 mob camps...now ya choice widen with <br/>
&gt;solo guards hunting.  Yes, Verant think Yield Rule will fail (I&#39;m one of <br/>
&gt;those who say I WILL NOT YIELD!  BAN ME MF!!!)..so they make more guards <br/>
&gt;for all to kill/lvl.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What? Not enuff guards to kill?  Try gnome guards, EK guards, Qeynos guard <br/>
&gt;or even Halas guard if you dun wanan enter tat cold freezing city..hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe when Ziltus reach lvl 50, it&#39;s time to leave EQ... ;P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And no, after UO and EQ, I will TRY not to touch any long-term online RPG. <br/>
&gt; I guess I will only try those session RPG like Winternight (Baldur&#39;s Gate <br/>
&gt;interface, AD&D rules) and Diablo 2 (Diablo kick ass, I have faith in <br/>
&gt;Diablo 2).  Sometime I wonder, how to cope up with more than 1 online RPG <br/>
&gt;like UO and EQ? Sad to say when EQ server down these 2 weeks, I login UO <br/>
&gt;and find UO really DOES have more role-playing elements than EQ.  At least <br/>
&gt;when I dun feel like sticking my backside on the treant hill for 5 hrs in a <br/>
&gt;row, I dun have to do the same in UO.  I login my miner and mine some ores, <br/>
&gt;make some tinkering items (jeeze I havent make any of the cool new <br/>
&gt;tinkering stuffs since the patch) and branded weap (my craftman is GM smith <br/>
&gt;& tinker)...and I spend 20 min or so to make some furniture to redecorate <br/>
&gt;the rooms I used to trap polar bear for sparring (all deleted by GM, my <br/>
&gt;craftman also master lumberjack and carpenter)...boy I start to miss UO <br/>
&gt;after 4 mths of playing EQ, hehe....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Talk abt AC, I really very scare to go in...hehe.<br/>
