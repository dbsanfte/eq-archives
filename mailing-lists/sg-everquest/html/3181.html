<div id="ygrps-yiv-582595179">Btw, DAOC is having big patch almost everyday now.  Based on the feedback <br/>
on beta testers and test leaders, I can see that they are doing pretty well <br/>
so far.  Of coz after AO Launching Crisis, no one dare to say Mythics&#39;s <br/>
launching will be smoother.  Let pray hard that it won&#39;t be as bad as AO <br/>
(can&#39;t imagine anything worse liao, hehe).<br/>
<br/>
This list is not setup by me, how to close? :P  Come to sg-mmorpg forum to <br/>
talk lor. :)<br/>

&gt; All i can say is, even if there are problems, even fundamental ones, they<br/>
&gt; can be fixed, but only within a certain time window (witness the AO 12.6<br/>
&gt; decable for a good example of exceeding that time window). Only time will<br/>
