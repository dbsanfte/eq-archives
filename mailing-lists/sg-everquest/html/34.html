 As for the view, I usually use the first person view (al Quake). I don&#39;t<br/>
play Quake though. I would get motion sickness in 5mins. Anyway, I do use<br/>
the other view type, the top down view. There are bonus to hit and damage<br/>
if u attack from behind (at least that&#39;s what I heard from a player. And I<br/>
do find that I hit more often and damage higher sometimes).<br/>
<br/>
&gt;The good thing about using the ass-cam etc is so you can look behind you<br/>
and around to spot oncoming monsters &lt;gnolls are good are creeping from the<br/>
back and if I see Fippy/Garrax Darkpaw, I&#39;m gonna kick them real hard!&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
No idea on this one. I&#39;m a Monk. I&#39;m my weapon and armor itself.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;My sentiments exactly! Welcome Brother!<br/>

One hour in real life is like 1 whole day in EverQuest &lt;morning til night&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yeah, and I hate that. You can hardly see at nite if u&#39;re human or don&#39;t<br/>
have any lightsource with u.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;For those unlucky shumacks humans without infravision or the other &quot;talent&quot;<br/>
go buy a large lantern at 2gp++ to save banging your head in the walls when<br/>
walking. BTW, banging your head on the wall for 1 hour takes up 150<br/>
calories.<br/>
<br/>
Well, generating 3ds are quite space and memory consuming...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Never thought of that. Stupid me!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Marcoing is still present but MUCH MUCH SO MUCH MUCH SO MUCH more less<br/>
effective.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Aye, actually what marcoing?? That game u bascially use hotkeys to play<br/>
the game. And better brush up on the typing skills. U&#39;ll want to type very<br/>
fast in certain situation. Heheh.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Marcoing the continous pressing/meshing of the same button to train a<br/>
certain skill. Eg, I sit and keep pressing the Sense Heading keys while<br/>
watching Friends.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;If your Lawyer or your Boss is drowning, would you choose going to the<br/>
movies or to StarBucks? &lt;drafted&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; If Starwars in being screen then, it&#39;s Starwars!!!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Right on Dude!!! </span></blockquote></div>
