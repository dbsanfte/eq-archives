Err, we wizards wear only clothes.Armor mean nothing much to us, coz full<br/>
clothes armor only add less than 20ac to us.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Opps, forgot. But I *believe* at later stages hor, you can get much better<br/>
armour. I will try to assist you in finding out if I ever get the chance.<br/>
<br/>
The only true weap we got is our spells ;)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;I heard tanking was tough? Or do your use pets?<br/>
<br/>
So far I never asked any pple for armor/weap after I died - since they<br/>
 doesn&#39;t help much and I&#39;m prepare to die again in the course of retrieving<br/>
 my corpse, hehe, so dun waste others&#39; money ;)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Cool! Same pattern as you.<br/>
<br/>
H/w, I&#39;ve just shifted house last wekkend and now my house is in a mess -<br/>
Hopefully u guys dun increase lvl too much, so that I can<br/>
 still group with u guys, hahahahahahahah ;-?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Aiyo! Don&#39;t worry! We can still group no matter what ;-) but not for too<br/>
long if the gap is REAL big...<br/>
