  <br/>
  Greetings Guys!<br/>
  <br/>
  Found a rare spawn in East Karanas near the ramp. That named mob, I think his name is Yutaka. Its a Human Monk. Judging from me point of view, he is only around Level 13. He should be quite good for exp I guess. I believe he&#39;d spawn there on Friday near 9pm Singapore time.<br/>
  <br/>
  So you lower level guys wanna &quot;camp&quot; there? &lt;grins&gt;<br/>
  <br/>
  I&#39;ll need the protection from all those dark stalkers that pop out from no where...<br/>
  <br/>
  Safe Travels,<br/>
