<div id="ygrps-yiv-630901622">1. No need the books if you can find the recipies on the internet. But I<br/>
think its more fun to get the books and mastering the languages. This IS a<br/>
roleplaying game after all =)<br/>
2. You need a lexicon. Its like a container where you dump your stuff into<br/>
it and click on research. I bought mine from wiz guild in Felwithe but I<br/>
think FP mage guild sells it too. It was at 10pp when i bought it so FP<br/>
might be a little more.<br/>
3. To specialize in evocation, you need to keep casting evocation spells.<br/>
This is the IMPORTANT part, if your abjuration or some other spell schools<br/>
get to 50, The game will not warn you that yer gonna specialize in it. Once<br/>
its 51, Its considered as your specialize skill and the rest can&#39;t go above<br/>
50 already, so better keep an eye out for it especially if you wanna<br/>
specialize in evoc. btw, the specialize skill and the normal spell skill is<br/>
different skills alttogether. They will say something like &quot; You are better<br/>
at specialize:Evocation (78)!&quot; instead of just evocation.<br/>
Hope that helps =)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;1. How do I go about researching spells.  Do I really need to buy those<br/>
&gt;books, in the sense that the books are PART of the ingredients in<br/>
&gt;researching spells or they are just for info purpose?  If I can find the<br/>
&gt;info for the spell from internet I dun need those books right?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2. How do I go abt DOING spell research.  Say for wiz I got the runes<br/>
&gt;required for a certain spell, how do I go abt &#39;mixing&#39; the runes?  Is there<br/>
&gt;any container I need to find like brewing barrel or forge, put the runes<br/>
&gt;inside and click &#39;COMBINE&#39;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3. I heard from Leshrec tat we can now put a point on all specialization of<br/>
&gt;magery skills, ie evoke, adjure, conjure, divin, alter.  That&#39;s what I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;done.  However, out of 5 skills, my main concern is on evoke (afterall I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;a nuker mah).  How to I go abt &#39;specializing&#39; in evoke?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4. I intend to go into tailoring skill once I max out my smith.  Can I know<br/>
&gt;other than tailoring skill tat can &#39;mix&#39; with smithing skill, is there any<br/>
&gt;other skills which can work along with smith skill?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;5. Is enchanter the only class that can made &#39;enchanted&#39; jewelry?  Say if I<br/>
&gt;train jewelry skills using non-enchanted metal (eg silver), can I rise the<br/>
&gt;jewelcraft skill?  So once I can make a certain jewelry with pretty high<br/>
&gt;successful rate, I can buy those &#39;enchanted&#39; metal from enchanters and make<br/>
&gt;&#39;enchanted&#39; jewelry myself?  OR I must make an enchanters char to make<br/>
&gt;&#39;enchanted&#39; jewelry?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;6. Anyone got any tips on trade skills like tailoring, jewelcrafting, etc?<br/>
&gt; Particularly those &#39;throw-PP-into-drain-kinda power-training&quot;, hehe.<br/>
