<div id="ygrps-yiv-707054228">Last night Garren, Einan, Flyingfox, Deadflower and I went hunting for the <br/>
Dvinn dagger in CB.<br/>
<br/>
We managed to kill Dvinn few times but only found ONE Dragoon Dirk, with <br/>
the following &quot;price&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
- Garren died once.<br/>
- Ziltus died 3 times (one in water) and drop lvl.<br/>
- FF died 2-3 times and drop lvl.<br/>
- Einan died ?? times (lost count, hehe).<br/>
- DF died at least 2 times.<br/>
<br/>
Later FF and I managed to lvl back but one more death we will drop lvl <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Just to let everyone know, so far all the Dvinns we killed are lvl 20. <br/>
 H/w, he is very tough as a lvl 20 mob and can inflict 40 dam on Garren <br/>
(lvl 26 paladin), not to mentioned how he whack the casters <br/>
up-down-left-right.<br/>
<br/>
His dagger, Dragoon Dirk, is a piercing weap but u can arm it as a throwing <br/>
weap if you are using 2HB, it gives u extra Dex and some SV.  One thing to <br/>
take note, u MUST armed ya main weap AFTER arming the dagger, otherwise the <br/>
dagger will become ya default weap even if u put it as a throwing weap.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully we can get FF a dagger by tonight and we can all go back to HH to <br/>
camp for PGT with Leshrec (money money money, here we come!), heh.<br/>
