<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693737454">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I would like to thank all of you who have provided info/tips and much guidance on the game.<br/>
Thanks especially to Ziltus,Flyingfox for bringing me to FP and also to Sereph (and uh that Ae*** person..hehe..)for having<br/>
brought me to Oasis. It was a great place for me as i went up 2 levels from 14 to 16 pretty quickly there. Much thanks<br/>
Sereph for having helped me gain that last bubble to 16 hehe..as a yellow DW Caiman certainly helps with exp.<br/>
<br/>
I got killed twice by SGs so far...one spawned on me i think and another was trained by someone running past me. Hell..<br/>
almost got killed by a Spectre once too! Lucky i Gated while pet tanked it!<br/>
<br/>
On to spell research...i know it&#39;s gonna be tough road from now on having to research...but i think it&#39;s only<br/>
summoning spells right? (i hope!) I don&#39;t mean to be a smart aleck but i think lvl 16 and lvl20 pet spells can be bought<br/>
but beyond that..probably unlikely. Dunno about that though..Thanks though to FF and Sereph for having<br/>
informed me of the tough road ahead. At least i&#39;ll be mentally prepared..sigh..<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on practice points though? I&#39;ve saved up about 50 practice points..not sure what to use them for right now.<br/>
Thinking of keeping them for specialization? Hmm..any comments?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in Oasis for awhile..but i was wondering..which mobs there are good for looting? I need more money..i&#39;m down<br/>
to only 45 pp now!! Getting poor again. The orcs there any good? Only found one bronze weapon on them so far..but i&#39;ve been<br/>
perhaps abit cautious in my attacks as i&#39;m still soloing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks once again and Good Hunting!<br/>
