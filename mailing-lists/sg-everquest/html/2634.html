&gt; Funny.  How come these few days I keep getting &#39;out-dated&#39; and repeating mails from the list?  *scratched head*<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Dued to my failure at PoF which got alot of ppl into trouble (which<br/>
&gt; &gt; involved dying and losing the major portion of their stuff) and with little<br/>
&gt; &gt; else to do (except like camping for stuff, which I have gotten very sick and<br/>
&gt; &gt; tired of), I have cancelled my account as from today, Oct 26th 1999. Zand,<br/>
&gt; &gt; please give out the items to the people as I have listed down with you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Especially Weadaenye, whom I&#39;m guilty as hell to got her into a living hell.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Please help me tell the follow people of my quiting and hope to see<br/>
&gt; &gt; them again sometime on another game another time and Best wishes to them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Saintly, Valadine, Millie, Silph, Lunatictiara, Ader, Fost, Sparrow,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Demitry, Wlyven, Anima and Nismo/Volk (they are brothers sharing the same<br/>
&gt; &gt; account).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Everquest was, had been and enjoyable game at the beginning but due<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the way that the game is designed it reminds me more of Evercamp,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Everbitch etc etc. It has become a torture to enter the &quot;game&quot; each day now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This incident has at least freed me from Evercrack as some would say it is.<br/>
&gt; &gt; So farewell my fellow guildmates. And may your time in Everquest be as your<br/>
&gt; &gt; first day, with new and exciting adventures each day.<br/>
