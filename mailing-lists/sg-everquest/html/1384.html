<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053498008">My char is quite new as well since I gone crazy and made a new necro. Right<br/>
now he&#39;s a lv 7, and hoping to hit lv 8 by tonight(gonna stay up 24hrs<br/>
again), then I&#39;ll get my gather shadows invis spell and head to Freeport.<br/>
Maybe we both can group, since we&#39;re probably the lowest lv chars now :(<br/>
<br/>
P.S My PC has been on since Sunday 6pm now its Monday 8+pm heheeh Im glad<br/>
it havent burst yet gonna let it rest for one hr then play again :p<br/>

&gt;I cannot use Veteran in Innoruk, cos my Druid in Cazic already called <br/>
&gt;Veteran liao. I think I will name my char. Polar, last name Coordinates :) <br/>
&gt;If can I will stick to that, if cannot then I will be called Complex, last <br/>
&gt;name Number. Crazy right? I cannot think of any other liao. If you see <br/>
&gt;someone with math like name in the game you know it&#39;s me liao. Look for a <br/>
&gt;Halfling Druid.<br/>
