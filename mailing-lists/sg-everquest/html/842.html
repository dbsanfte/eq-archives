<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576123330">In 2 1/2 hours, I&#39;ve reach the maximum skill level (138, can&#39;t find the<br/>
recipe for harder drinks) and made around 20 plat<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the steps I followed for those interested. All ingredients can be<br/>
found at West Freeport. The cask in found in inns or tarven. All the<br/>
stuff need to be place in a brew barrel. There&#39;s no need to buy that<br/>
lousy book, just buy the ingredients and the cask.<br/>
<br/>
1. Make sure you have 5-7plat<br/>
2. Dump 10 practice points into Brewing<br/>
3. Make Mend till you reach 40 in brewing<br/>
<br/>
Mend requires:<br/>
<br/>
1 Hops, 1 Barley, 1 Yeast and a Cask<br/>
<br/>
You will make a lost at the time<br/>
<br/>
4. At 40, make Ale till you reach 65<br/>
<br/>
Ale requires:<br/>
<br/>
1 Barley, 1 Malt, a flask of Water and a Cask<br/>
<br/>
Lost will be smaller<br/>
<br/>
5. At 65, make Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew till max<br/>
<br/>
Ol &#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew requires:<br/>
<br/>
1 Yeast, 1 hops, 1 Barley, 1 Malt and A Cask<br/>
<br/>
You will make a lost until 80, where you start break even from the sales<br/>
of your drinks to the bar. At 100, you will start to make money.<br/>
<br/>
Will try out pottery tomorrow and tell you people the results I get.<br/>
<br/>
Last of all, thanks Yiyang for that 5 plat donation which fund a large<br/>
part of this &quot;project&quot;</div>
