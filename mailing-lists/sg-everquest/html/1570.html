<div id="ygrps-yiv-217755819">As far as i can remember from those necro boards, necros (cant remember<br/>
which level) can solo a 2 bird site all by himself... using the following<br/>
technique...<br/>
1. send pet to one...<br/>
2. cast DOT...<br/>
3. cast fear on another...<br/>
4. kill one as fast as possible...<br/>
5. then kill the other when it comes back...<br/>
<br/>
after level 20... necros get a spell call allure of death that allows us to<br/>
convert HP to mana and since our Siphon Life spells can damage n heal<br/>
ourselves... this technique somewat works - as i believe...<br/>
<br/>
have yet to try... n personally i think i will try a 1 bird and test out its<br/>
ability b4 i try the 2 bird site...<br/>

&gt; No doubt my current Wiz is of low INT amg all other casters, but he seem<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; solo pretty well.  Normally I use root and nuke (with my most powerful<br/>
&gt; spell) tactics.  But when the mob resist my root for the 2nd time, I will<br/>
&gt; switch to melee and nuke (with my 2nd most powerful spell, 40% less dam,<br/>
&gt; 40% less mana but cast much faster).  And surprisingly, I still managed to<br/>
&gt; survive in Lake Rathetear using these 2 method till now. ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those who are pondering between lvl 20 to 24 who cant still solo a<br/>
&gt; aviak guard now, I offer FOC Power-Leveling-Training sessions in Lake ;)<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;ve helped Deadflower and Flyingfox to lvl few times using this method,<br/>
&gt; and will be willing to help all others local kakis if u need my training<br/>
&gt; sessions.  Basically we will go to the 2-birds isle and try to spread the<br/>
&gt; spawning of the aviak guards one after another instead of both at the same<br/>
&gt; time.  The trainee will solo the bird, and I will monitor both HP.  Once<br/>
&gt; mob HP drop to below 50%, I will start nuking it to death. In this way,<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; trainee can solo safely.  At lvl 26, some of the green chicks still give<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; xp, and best of all, no faction hit.  Come to think of it, Lake loot in<br/>
&gt; term of money is not bad.  With one night hunting, I normally get ard<br/>
&gt; 20pp-30pp (but also spend alot buying my leather skin reagent, 5gp plus<br/>
per<br/>
&gt; cast, one night can spend 10-20pp), that&#39;s after I sell all the rusty and<br/>
&gt; bronze weaps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only condition is that if there is any aviak guard con blue to me, I<br/>
&gt; will get it.  Reason is becoz 50% of the green chick no more giving me xp,<br/>
&gt; whereas they still con blue to the trainee.  Of coz sometime when blue<br/>
bird<br/>
&gt; spawn 3 in a row and I&#39;m oom after the 2nd bird, trainee can get it.<br/>
&gt;  Trainee also get to hunt all those bird con green to me, which more than<br/>
&gt; 50% of the time con blue to them (if u r below lvl 22, no bird will be con<br/>
&gt; green to u, hehe).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure how long further can the Lake give my xp, esp when I reach<br/>
lvl<br/>
&gt; 27.  If birds still give me xp at lvl 27, I will stay there and offer<br/>
&gt; training sessions, if not I will go elsewhere.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Btw, during the training session, we dun hunt in group.  Instead we hunt<br/>
&gt; solo so tat trainee can get ALL the xp.  Based on my past experience,<br/>
&gt; killing 2 birds in a group of 2 will give less xp killing 1 bird by solo.<br/>
&gt;  I still believe in this principle.  For those magi/necro out there, we<br/>
&gt; have confirm with GM that pet is treated as one of ya team member even if<br/>
u<br/>
&gt; are soloing.  Basically pet will eat the summoner&#39;s xp regardless if it<br/>
&gt; kill the mob or not.  They say mob only eat xp from other group members if<br/>
&gt; it kill the mob, this I&#39;m not sure but it definitely will eat the summoner<br/>
&gt; xp.  When I train FF, I will ask him to dismiss pet so tat he can get all<br/>
&gt; the xp.  EQ is quite balance - with pet u can hunt tougher mob with better<br/>
&gt; loot, but u will get less xp ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;At lvl 26 with 2 bubb more to lvl 27, I really hate to restart, thou&#39; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;personally would LOVE to have a new dream char tat start with lvl 20<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;*grin*.  Imagine, it takes time to go thru the &#39;miserable&#39; stage of a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;newbie wiz, where no one wanna hunt with u and everyone steal from u -<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;are the worst life form in EQ, just like a PCB recruit in army, you are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;worse than chicken backside blah blah blah! Argh!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Furthermore I haven&#39;t find any good stuff for my Zil yet, where got<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;find good item to start my new wiz off? ;(<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;On the other hand, I&#39;m also very uncertain as too which race to choose<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;my new wiz.  Personally I hate to been KOS as a DE, hate to be so short<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;(ugly) and short-sighted as a gnome, hate to have night blindness as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;erudite (ok halo of light may help but my erudite wiz friend still half<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;blind at night, esp in place with fog), hate to be so weak (low STR of<br/>
&gt; 55)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;as a HE and hate to be a half-f**k wiz as a human (average stats plus<br/>
&gt; night<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;blindness).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Amg all, I love the DEX/AGI stats of gnome, the look and height of HE,<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;INT of Erudite, and the no xp penalty of human.  U tell me which to<br/>
&gt; choose<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;lor, hehe.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;If I were to start a new wiz in Innoruuk, anyone wanna hunt with me? ;)<br/>
