<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467440427">Just a note to all caster types out there. If you really want to gain xp fast at level 18+, you should try out Oasis and do it SOLO. At level 21, I managed to get about a bubble of xp per hour. Although the loot here is poor, there is not much steal killing going on around here (Perfect for those wizards who like to use their body as tanks *hint* *hint*) and if really in trouble, usually can make to zone before you die. The caimans and crocs also not very resistant to root spells and they are not very buff either (4-5 flame shocks to take out a Deepsea caiman) Remember, the key word is solo, if you wanna group, maybe max is 2, but best if solo. Hope this helps =)<br/>
