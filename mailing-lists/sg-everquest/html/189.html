&gt; Look at those LvL 20 and above Warriors,Rangers,Wizards standing in groups<br/>
&gt; in banded armour with well-balanced weapons. Impressive right? And they<br/>
keep<br/>
&gt; going : /shout You better get the hell outta there before train comes blah<br/>
&gt; blah blah &lt;big talk&gt;. I am powerful etc...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lets take a look after they die in the deep deep dungeons....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; XXX : Errr....couldst any spare me a rusty weapon? Perhaps even some<br/>
&gt; PatchWork?<br/>
&gt; They are almost useless without their armour and weapon, when they go to<br/>
&gt; retrieve their things in Dungeons etc. I doubt those LvL 20+ even get pass<br/>
&gt; those Elite/Guards Gnolls. That means 300PP worth of things gone?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lets take a look at the Monks now...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mr-I-Wear-Only-Cloth stands alone in the dungeon and dies. But he just<br/>
need<br/>
&gt; some food to get everything going right. The Monks can just fight their<br/>
way<br/>
&gt; through to where they died without worries and EASILY. Been there, done<br/>
&gt; that. And at the same time kick some ass while on their journey. Whereas<br/>
&gt; those other classes take big detours around monsters to avoid being killed<br/>
&gt; and trying to retrieve corpse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, enough of my biase remarks now.<br/>
