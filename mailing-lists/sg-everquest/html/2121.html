<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627462994">WCS Hunt<br/>
<br/>
YY, FF, Les, Fesse, Zan and me.  We started off at the 3 bird towers, then <br/>
to the tower isle - all no luck.  Then I brought all to the madman camp, <br/>
where I used to see Webclaw myself.   We reached there, see a shaman and <br/>
kill it.  After an hr or less, Web spawn and we kill it in water.<br/>
<br/>
Then after 3 hrs wait we dun see Web anymore.  Fes, Zan and YY left. <br/>
 Remaining 3 stayed and finally we got 2 more WCS ;)  The last one is very <br/>
tough, plus &quot;some&quot; pple was fooling ard and join in the fight with 50% HP <br/>
;)  Almost get me killed - gate out with 20HP (we have lvl 30 wiz, 30 magi <br/>
and 27 wiz)!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, some tips to share with those who wanna camp for the staff:<br/>
<br/>
1. Tank is quite useless as Webbie disappear itself the moment u MELEE or <br/>
ROOT it.  So only way to hurt it is to NUKE it.<br/>
<br/>
2. The real spawn spot is a underwater cave behind 3 birds tower.  I try to <br/>
explore there solo b4 but not enuff air to swim in.  I heard inside <br/>
sometime got deepwater goblin or gob shaman.  Anyway from there Web will <br/>
swim many places in lake and finally settle down playing in the water near <br/>
the madman camp dock (SW corner of the lake).<br/>
<br/>
3. Web AoE hit pretty hard.  Make sure u got all the sv magic buffs.  It <br/>
range from lvl 24 to 26, but is overpowered like Dvinn.<br/>
<br/>
4.  1 named Madman spawn every now and then, hit pretty hard. Les say con <br/>
red to him, dunno true or not ;)<br/>
<br/>
The staff got enchanter DoT spell effect - shallow breadth.  1HB, 5 dam. <br/>
 Most impt, it look quite cool ;)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.</div>
