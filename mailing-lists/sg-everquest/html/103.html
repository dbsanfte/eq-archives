<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130311602">Hey people!<br/>
<br/>
Well, I was lookin&#39; for some netted armour but to no avail. Heard those Froglocks in Guk have them? I&#39;ve only 15 plat in the bank. My hard earned savings playing in odd hours during the exams. &lt;sob sob&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I managed to get a netted tunic from Mikrin for only 5 gold. Man That guys is an angel, extremely friendly too. He too is a monk of the 6th circle &lt;lvl 6 back then&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
How much money do you guys make anyways? I can bank in only max 1 plat per hour but that affects my EXP gain very much considering the meagre hours I play...<br/>
