<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318151663">Alamak, surely we wanna play the game for fun sake. But discussion like the <br/>
previous msgs are also pretty fun and informative.  Frankly speaking high <br/>
elven wiz is my all time favourite in AD&D but too bad it eats dust when <br/>
coming to EQ.  Only thru&#39; this kinda discussion then we can bring in <br/>
different sources of opinion & knowledge and every one gain from it ;)  So <br/>
dun take the different views too hard, hehe.<br/>

&gt; Well, all of you give very good points. However, they all contradict each<br/>
&gt; others&#39;. Like LKW and Sereph, both are solid facts but they &quot;kick&quot; each<br/>
&gt; other. In the end, its each to his own. Why can&#39;t we just play a game for<br/>
&gt; fun sake? But of course, who doesn&#39;t want to get all the goodies and hit<br/>
&gt; Level 50 &lt;smiles&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; There is no doubt a TSK can solo best in EQ.  They have the harm spells<br/>
&gt; &gt; which is as good as Paladin&#39;s healing ability (no saving throw or<br/>
&gt; failure),<br/>
&gt; &gt; yet they have the ability of regenerating HP ability.  I made a troll<br/>
&gt; &gt; shaman in Innoruuk for testing, at lvl 1 my first victim is a monster<br/>
&gt; which<br/>
&gt; &gt; is yellow to me.  And within the first 10 min I play, I gain a lvl.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Btw, all classes always complain that they are weaker than other <br/>

&gt; &gt; EQSS also have an article abt soloing - and they rank troll anything as<br/>
