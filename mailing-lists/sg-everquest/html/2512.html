The following is posted by Angturil on Eq stratics board. I found<br/>
it<br/>
very helpful so paste it here. Thanks Angturil for this wonderful<br/>
post.<br/>

**********************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
The following are the tactics I use, and have worked for me till<br/>
50,<br/>
and now 30 (I have 2 wizards). I have also played a paladin to a<br/>
decent (38) level, and can see the other side of the equation. <br/>
1. Much as I like to melee, there is rarely a point above 20th<br/>
level<br/>
to do so. Below 20, a wizard with a good staff CAN contribute<br/>
greatly<br/>
in combat, and should , once mana runs out. It will help keep their<br/>
combat skills up, and those skills are critical in keeping you<br/>
alive<br/>
later. Above 20, melee only to finish off runners (in a controlled<br/>
environment), and to build skill with FM and an easy foe.<br/>
<br/>
2. This is CRITICAL and completely missed by 90% (random high<br/>
number)<br/>
of the wizards out there. DO NOT run, or backup from a mob, nor<br/>
face<br/>
away from it. Your defence will plummet, and so will your life. If<br/>
you<br/>
need a mob off you, do the following...<br/>
<br/>
Stop casting<br/>
Stop attacking<br/>
ask a tank to get it off you <br/>
<br/>
in open spaces, rooting the mob, and RUNNING forward through the<br/>
mob<br/>
will work best. NEVER backup, or run around, you will die. <br/>
<br/>
( Actually I found you can backup a little slowly. This will make<br/>
your<br/>
tank easy to pick the mob up. However, Never Never run --- Binbini)<br/>
<br/>
3. 2 bubbles of health, under attack, and you have to run? don&#39;t<br/>
bother. cast gate, you have a 50% chance of making it, running, you<br/>
have 0. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4. In open spaces, root is your friend. Use it as intened, to keep<br/>
mobs OUT of combat. Once rooted, DO NOT nuke the mob, let it stand<br/>
there till you&#39;re done with the others.<br/>
<br/>
( Just remember, once the mob breaks the root, you are his primary<br/>
target. But it can easily pulled off by a tank. --- Binbini)<br/>
<br/>
5. Use AOE&#39;s. they rock, and have low agro. Just make sure you have<br/>
more than one tank, and they keep things engaged. You can often do<br/>
1.5x more damage than is usually possible at your level. AOE&#39;s<br/>
become<br/>
very hard to use past 30 ( at least I have yet to figure out a way<br/>
to... working on it), but are very effective below 30th level.<br/>
<br/>
6. Tactics. If multiple mobs come, you and the tanks pick the<br/>
weakest<br/>
mob. You FULL burn the mob, tanking it as required. The key is<br/>
killing<br/>
1-2 mobs fast, relieving the pressure from your tanks and clerics.<br/>
This is CRITICAL. Once done, you med, and finish runners as needed.<br/>
While full burning the mob, DO NOT attack/assist in melee. It will<br/>
keep the mob from sticking to you. This works even with ice comet<br/>
and<br/>
other high damage spells. Multiple mobs are BAD for your group,<br/>
they<br/>
hit people in the back for MUCH more damage than if they were<br/>
engaged<br/>
in 1 to 1 melee. It&#39;s your job to kill them fast and make the fight<br/>
manageable. Root is another means to do this, but requires much<br/>
more<br/>
space and skill.<br/>
<br/>
7. Get an enchanter in your group, and keep it there  they control<br/>
the<br/>
battle, you burn the targets. you can win almost any fight with<br/>
them.<br/>
We&#39;ve killed 9-12 yellows with a 4 person group with an enchanter<br/>
in<br/>
one fight. and this is in the 30s.<br/>
<br/>
8. Use your shield skins religiously, they are one of your most<br/>
powerful spells. with them, you can tank for ages.<br/>
<br/>
( Yep, always keep the shieldskin up. If a mob beats you to 4<br/>
bubble<br/>
less and a tank taunts it off, backup and cast shieldskin again,<br/>
then<br/>
you have better chance to survive the next melee. -- Binbini)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t give up on your wizard. They are probably the 2nd most<br/>
powerful<br/>
class in the game (clerics being first). The trouble is, most<br/>
people<br/>
just don&#39;t know how to play one.<br/>
<br/>
If you ever see a wizard run around your group yelling &quot;get it off<br/>
me&quot;, asking for heals, saying OOM after one mob, do yourself a<br/>
favor<br/>
and find another member. <br/>
<br/>
A wizard should NEVER require heals in a fight or take a heal that<br/>
should go to a tank. Keep that in mind. You can tank, but you must<br/>
NEVER do so at the expense of heals to your tank members who are<br/>
much<br/>
better than you at it. Use your shieldskins instead of heals. pace<br/>
them out. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my advice for today, have fun.<br/>
