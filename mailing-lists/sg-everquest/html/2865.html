&gt; &gt; Can someone tell me the min lvl for a wiz to solo the following <br/>
 </span></blockquote>dungeons:<br/>

&gt; &gt; Permafrost (up to King room)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to kite in his room.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sol B  (whole dungeon or max which area/wat lvl)<br/>
&gt; Perhaps the only thing a level 50 wizzie can solo in Sol B is the kobold<br/>
&gt; noble, even then it is still a very tough fight as he is a 37ish <br/>
 </span></blockquote> enchanter.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And you probably have to clear all the surrounding mobs to solo pull him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unrest (whole dungeon or max which area/wat lvl)<br/>
&gt; You can solo whole unrest at 40 assuming you have wolfform, all spawns<br/>
&gt; except ghost of unrest is easy at that level. For ghost of unrest, you <br/>
 </span></blockquote>have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to be high level enough so that all the spawns surrounding ghost are <br/>
 </span></blockquote>green<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; najena is easy, reclusive magi have to clear his room too and perhaps <br/>
 </span></blockquote>some<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; other spawns like the gnome that drops pugius are easy too<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Paw (whole dungeon or max which area/wat lvl)<br/>
&gt; Cant farm in paw imo, anyway not much to farm in paw except gnollhide <br/>
 </span></blockquote>tome<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and robe of ishva and those are on lvl 40 mobs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Befallen  (whole dungeon or max which area/wat lvl)<br/>
&gt; Whole dungeon should be np, befallen mobs work like as long as they are<br/>
&gt; green to you they wouldnt touch you as long as you dont sit/med.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Beholder Maze (whole dungeon or max which area/wat lvl)<br/>
&gt; Evil eyes range from lvl 18-25 so a level 30 wizard should be able to <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Runnyeye  (whole dungeon or max which area/wat lvl)<br/>
&gt; Runnyeye = train city as the  elite goblins even though they are green <br/>
 </span></blockquote>will<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; agro you and the area is so small theres hardly a safe spot to pull your<br/>
&gt; rare spawns to. Assuming you can clear your path, king should be easy. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Borxx<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you will need at least 34 to solo while the goblin warlord is relatively<br/>
&gt; easy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; WK Ogre Camp<br/>
&gt; Level 49 recommended. If not when you are forced to pull an ogre guard in<br/>
&gt; the initial splitting of spawns (have to pull it first), chief goonda <br/>
 </span></blockquote>will<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; join in and cause a lot of problems.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; SRo Sprectre Island<br/>
&gt; Sro not spectre island. Perhaps you talking about oasis. If you pull<br/>
&gt; spectres in oasis, all 3/4/5 depending on luck will come as they are very<br/>
&gt; close to each other. Same goes with the spectre island in OOT. So<br/>
&gt; recommended level is 49 when about 2/3 spectres are green to you and 1/3<br/>
&gt; blue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; CT<br/>
&gt; CT is moderately hard but not impossible so you must learn wher to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>med/camp<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; etc Best to solo if all mobs are green to you, so about 46/7/8+.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For stone golem (RV gauntlets) you can either clear all the gators in the<br/>
&gt; water in the stone golem area or invis and chiong in and water fight with<br/>
&gt; the stone golem. He is very strong therefore you will have a high chance <br/>
 </span></blockquote>of<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Iron golem the one that drops RV helm spawns in 3rd floor of throne room.<br/>
&gt; Behind that area is a  passageway where 1 roamer walks by. Root nuke and<br/>
&gt; kill the roamer and start agro radius pulling (walk close to the mob just<br/>
&gt; enough to pull 1 and not all, hard to explain) the iron golem room (3<br/>
&gt; spawns). Beware there are many healers in CT, but ice cometting should <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tae Ew Diviner (RV bracer) and Templar (RV Leg) is easier. IF you are an<br/>
&gt; erudite wizard you will have a minor advantage here as gorillas do not <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Avatar of fear (RV BP) Level 49/50 needed. Camp at the very long <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I missed out some spawns like clay golem etc, those should be easy (level<br/>
