<div id="ygrps-yiv-796287759">Okay its much better than Tallon Zek!1600 players are currently on the VZ server which is pretty ok.However 229 players are in Nektulos Forest now and its really hard to get a kill but GM gukin has tuned the spawn rates by almost 50% so u guys better hop in soon.Ok back to VZ,BTW VZ will be our server coz Ive played on TZ too and its much worse and also the DarkElves are much better off coz their newbie area is a seprate zone...oh here comes a moss snake,over and out!<br/>
