<div id="ygrps-yiv-556656406">I also went thru ya stage, esp wiz lagi worse since we dun have pet to tank <br/>
us and our lvl 4 spells sux when we fight with mb same lvl as us.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I can suggest u to buy all the impt scrolls for ya next lvl, keep in <br/>
bank and go FP for hunting.  I&#39;m now camping inside CB (ok, Crushbone, not <br/>
ch** by* hor), and will take a boat back to FP either late tonight or <br/>
tomorrow.  U can give me a tell if u dunno the way to port. I can bring u <br/>
there.  But I guess I can&#39;t bring u along to CB trainer hill coz all orc <br/>
cen will attack u on sight.  For Einan I also keep casting invis on him, at <br/>
least he is not tat bad since he can tank quite well and his lvl higher <br/>
than yours, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
If u prefer to stay in Faydark, u can try to go BB.  There is a place with <br/>
few stone blocks, and inside the stone blocks center is a npc merchant. <br/>
 I&#39;ve been training there since lvl 7 to 9.  The 4 skellies there spawn at <br/>
fixed place and will not run ard, so pretty safe for u to kill one by one. <br/>
 H/w, the skellies r also lvl 7-9, that mean I have to team with a tank b4 <br/>
I go there.  For magi, maybe ya pet can help u solo.  Once u get above 9, <br/>
try the bandit camp between the highelf and woodelf city.  There r 3 <br/>
bandits there which r non-agro, but if u attack one, all 3 will come to u. <br/>
 U can bring a tank there safer.  Once u get to lvl 10-11, u can try harder <br/>
places like mino cave for mino slaves or BB chestboard for skeleton <br/>
king/bishop (as a group hor).<br/>
<br/>
Personally I dun advised any caster below lvl 10 to go CB, coz the loot <br/>
doesnt justify the trains.  I myself start to go there since lvl 5, and <br/>
died until I lost count liao.   Unless u can solo a train of 3-4 orc cen or <br/>
solo an orc leg, dun bother to go there.  Places like bandit camps or BB <br/>
skellies can give better loot, better xp and most impt, better SURVIAL ;)<br/>

<br/>
p/s: Already confirmed with GM that 2nd name must be one word, but can <br/>
separate using the &#39; sighn, like Ziltus de&#39;Guailan, not bad right?  Hehe.<br/>
<br/>
p/s2: Ple pray for me to get a SBS for both Einan, Trifrost and myself <br/>
tonight.  Heard from Garren now they implement the anti-camp thingy, so <br/>
very hard to camp for item. ;(<br/>
