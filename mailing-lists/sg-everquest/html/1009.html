<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776069496">Hi again,<br/>
<br/>
Where is the spell Dimensional Pocket?? I could not find it in Felwithe..i<br/>
heard it might be in the Gnome<br/>
city Ak&#39;Anon...anyone knows??<br/>
<br/>
Brewing maxes out in 2hrs? Guess i&#39;ll try very soon  then...is brewing alone<br/>
enough? Or am<br/>
i gonna have to do another trade skill later like Smithing?<br/>
I only have 4pp as of this msg hehe gonna have to get more first..rules out<br/>
chessboard i guess...<br/>
down there only bones! Argh....<br/>
<br/>
I heard about the FBR...but is it really worth paying like 200pp (what i<br/>
heard) for it?<br/>
What does it really offer besides coolness factor? How much dmg does RTS do<br/>
and<br/>
what&#39;s the delay? It&#39;s 2HB right? Alot of questions...hehe...sorry!<br/>
<br/>
Ahhh...i won&#39;t spend whole day brewing lah Ziltus...maybe just 4-6 hrs a<br/>
day? Hahahahahaha<br/>

&gt; Hehe no lah, just trying to suggest to u guys to throw in 5-8pp on brewing<br/>
&gt; 1st rather than spending on other stuffs.  The  princple is actually very<br/>
&gt; straigh forward - buy a chicken or 5 eggs 1st.  If u buy 5 eggs, u can<br/>
&gt; either eat them up (spend on items) or hatch them for chickens (buy<br/>
scrolls<br/>
&gt; and use them to hunt for money, but take longer time at ya lvl,  imagine<br/>
&gt; the time & money u need to spend to keep the chickens, hehe).<br/>
&gt;  Alternatively, u can buy a chicken (train ya brewing) and let it lay eggs<br/>
&gt; (money).  In the short run, spending money on eggs more shiok, in the med<br/>
&gt; run, spending on chicken is more practical.  In the long run, ultimately<br/>
&gt; both achieve the same result, hahaha.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nice chicken and egg theory huh, LOL ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just a comparison.  U spend 4 night hunting earning 40pp.  H/w, u can also<br/>
&gt; spend 5-8pp to max brewing to 135 in 2 hrs, and another 2 hrs to make<br/>
20pp.<br/>
&gt;  So first night u make 20pp plus max skill.  Just spend another 3 nights<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; 4 hrs u can get 140pp (MIN) in total easily, hehe.  At this rate u can<br/>
earn<br/>
&gt; a FBR in 1 week.  This remind me of my UO kakis Asmandi Dragon who used to<br/>
&gt; spend 1 whole week just chopping tree making wooden shields and sell to<br/>
npc<br/>
&gt; in order to buy his 2-storey house, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope this msg will motivate u guys to pick up brewing, it&#39;s really worth<br/>
&gt; spending time and effort.  Of coz, I dun expect u to brew for 4 whole day,<br/>
&gt; I myself brew 2 hrs also bu ta han liao.  With brewing skill, rather than<br/>
&gt; hunting desperately for $ (which can be a pain when u face a whole camp of<br/>
&gt; stealers or no one wanna team with u), u can actually spend 1 hr daily<br/>
&gt; brewing to give yaself some stable source of money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Leshrec got a good point on buying scrolls.  For the 1st 2 cycles, I try<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; buy all scrolls only to find out that I only used 2-3 at most.  In the end<br/>
&gt; I spend so much money on useless scrolls.  When I come to 3rd circle<br/>
&gt; spells, I seek Leshrec&#39;s advice on which scrolls to buy (since we both<br/>
wiz,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s nice to have someone ahead of u sometime to share with u his<br/>
&gt; experience, hehe).  Coming to 4th circle I more or less know wat kinda<br/>
&gt; spell is impt for wiz.  Lvl 5 there is more useful spells, so I buy more<br/>
&gt; scrolls.  With the help of my brewing, I already got all the wanted<br/>
scrolls<br/>
&gt; for my lvl 20 (all gate, dd and armor spells except instill which I heard<br/>
&gt; need research?), and still saving for my Gossmer Robe or FBR.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Btw, if u can, try to get the dimension bag scroll 1st. This is a VERY<br/>
&gt; useful spells for low str caster coz this summoned bag can carry stuffs at<br/>
&gt; weightless(?)!  The only thing u need to remember is to empty them b4 u<br/>
log<br/>
&gt; since they will disappear when u log.  At high lvl, u will loot stuffs<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; bronze weap and ring/rawhide armors which r pretty heavy.  So this bag<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; come in VERY handy.  U can even sell it to non-magi for some money if they<br/>
&gt; intend to camp at wulu wulu place w/o merchants & bank! Since magi can<br/>
&gt; summon bandage, u guys got the cheapest mean to train bind wound, which is<br/>
&gt; a very nice skills to have when soloing with a pet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One &#39;mis&#39;-concept abt binding is tat many casters take it as a source of<br/>
&gt; income, but frankly speaking I only take it as a utility spells.  I never<br/>
&gt; bother to offer bind for a fee unless I&#39;m in good mood or I&#39;m abt to log -<br/>
&gt; for free.  Of coz donation welcome.  So far I heard the max amt pple<br/>
&gt; willing to pay is 1pp, and so far I leave it to other to give me as a<br/>
&gt; donation - max 5gp so far, hehe.  The power of binding cannot be measure<br/>
&gt; via monetary term.  It&#39;s one of the most useful spells casters have, not<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; a trade but as the ability to adventure.  Comparing with the tank who cant<br/>
&gt; bind, we casters are so fortunate that we dun have to spend time running<br/>
&gt; all the way to our corpse.  U r right that lvl shld come first b4 money,<br/>
&gt; esp when u r below lvl 16.  Dun complain too much abt lousy loot.  We used<br/>
&gt; to hunt caimen and croc at oasis and the best loot on them is a piece of<br/>
&gt; meat tat we can sell for 7cp, hahaha.  Most of the pple dun even bother to<br/>
&gt; pick them up.  Only poor wiz like me go around picking the rubbish, hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m also picking up smithy slowly now, after spending 20 skill point on<br/>
it.<br/>
&gt;  H/w, when camping at HH I&#39;m now having problems buying sharpening stone.<br/>
&gt;  Anyone know where can I get that in HH?  Does HH got a bank?<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My suggestions on buying spell. Usually, unless i have money to burn, I<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; buy the required spells. For me its usually 3 spells per spell circle<br/>
&gt; since<br/>
&gt; &gt; most of the other spells are useless. I only buy the rest of the spells<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a circle higher since I like to have a full spellbook ) I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; &gt; know about magicians since I never played one, but I think a DD spell<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Water E summoning spell at each circle would be best if yer trying to<br/>
&gt; &gt; economise since u never know when a person is gonna sell a much needed<br/>
&gt; armor<br/>
&gt; &gt; piece or weapon. Of course, maybe there are other spells a magician<br/>
need,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but as I said I don&#39;t know. As for trade, once you get to about level<br/>
20,<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think its much more profitable to do dungeons such as Unrest. Each mob<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt; &gt; holds 1pp so in a group of 6, getting 20 pp is no problem within about<br/>
&gt; 1-2<br/>
&gt; &gt; hours since lotsa mobs there.. Of course trade skills like blacksmithy<br/>
&gt; &gt; surely gonna be damn profitable in long run since can make a few hundred<br/>
&gt; pp<br/>
&gt; &gt; in an hour, but thats gonna be a long time before you can start<br/>
&gt; attempting<br/>
&gt; &gt; on it (heard cost price very high).<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Hey Ziltus,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Wah lau, don&#39;t make it sound like we&#39;re begging for money leh.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I know I complained i&#39;m broke but i didn&#39;t say I wanted you guys<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;to give me any :P Donations are always accepted lah of course<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;but the key thing, i believe, is that I don&#39;t go around hoping for them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;or asking you guys for any.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;It&#39;s just that i spent 3 whole nights making 40+ pp from hunting? And i<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;spent<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;them all on my lvl8 spells which cost 3pp 9gp 8scp per spell.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m almost lvl 11 and i&#39;m just thinking at this rate...when i hit lvl<br/>
12<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;buy those  new spells at 5-6pp each...i need at least another 60pp??<br/>
&gt; Wah..<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;siong man<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I did hear of the brewing thing...just that when first heard of<br/>
it...was<br/>
&gt; &gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;very<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;sure of the details...but i guess now i probably would try.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;One more thing is that in my area where i&#39;ve been hunting of late...you<br/>
<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;better exp<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;but only shitty bones for loot. (Mummies, skeletons,chessboard Skel<br/>
&gt; Pawns,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;etc...)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;So i had to choose between levelling and making money. I chose<br/>
levelling<br/>
&gt; &gt; cos<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;i want to hit lvl 12 faster...the bind affinity spell i thought can use<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;make some money!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Alot of ppl are willing to pay 1pp at least for a bind somewhere. Best<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;man...if got 20 ppl<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;in one night...20pp liaoz...LOL Don&#39;t think so easy lah hehe Besides<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;only do that when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;i&#39;m short on cash (which is most of the time). I prefer to do for free<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;actually. Nice guy here :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Ok that&#39;s it for me...off to work (late again hiaks)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Zanderion  [lvl 10 magi] Innoruuk<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;p.s Thanks for the advice Ziltus!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Jus a thought.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Everyone start off been very poor, and even at lvl 18, I&#39;m still very<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;poor,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; unlike our rich man Garren, hehe.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; We guys gotta learn to stand on our feet sometime.  I think brewing<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; very useful trade skill which can easily fulfill ya financial needs,<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that it&#39;s kinda boring and take times.  Nevertheless comparing with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hunting, brewing still give me better and faster return than hunting<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; far.  If we can spend 1-3 hrs a day brewing, I dun see why the new<br/>
&gt; chaps<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cant do the same ;)  No doubt we try to help by sponsoring abit, but<br/>
u<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;guys<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; have to help us to help yaself sometimes ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; One thing for sure, we the local kakis always keep items which we<br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; other kakis can used (eg I keep cutt ring for newbies, ring mails for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tanks, garren keep thu robe for me, les keep woven for me etc).  We<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; try to help as and when we can, but one must understand the fact tat<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; utimately u r the one playing the game and handling ya own char,<br/>
hehe.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; IMHO, brewing can make some quick buck.  At lvl 10 u shld be able to<br/>
&gt; save<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; up to 10pp.  Of coz I know pple will use them to buy stuffs like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; weap/armor/scrolls.  But just ponder - if u spend it on brewing, u<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;earn<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; even more to buys stuffs, at the same time maxing ya skill.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; At lvl 18 now, I&#39;m still picking up bone chips, rusty weaps, animal<br/>
&gt; &gt; skins,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; beetle eyes and even rat tooth (7cp) to sell.  FYI I&#39;m a wiz with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; weakest STR amg all races and I keep SIX bags on me to carry loot.<br/>
&gt;  Many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; times u see me walking between EC and WC while I&#39;m actually running<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 200% overload on me, haha.    If I can try so hard to save up money,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; dun<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; see why others cant do it. ;P<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Ziltus.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; p/s:  Just FYI, the npc at tunnel buy at a lower price than FP npc,<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; die die gotta &#39;walk&#39; back to FP sell.  Now u see I earn all my money<br/>
&gt; &gt; using<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all my blood, sweat and tears, hehe ;)<br/>
