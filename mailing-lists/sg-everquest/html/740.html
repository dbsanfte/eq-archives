<div id="ygrps-yiv-238860501">I think woven &#39;Shows&#39; up on the character unlike cloth. Not sure about it<br/>
tho, save up for damask if yer don&#39;t like woven.<br/>
Highpass is mainly gnolls and orcs. Spawn there is good, and if yer the only<br/>
group there, xp moves quite fast too. But its mostly camped out and ya need<br/>
to be at least 15-16 levels since the orcs are around that level. Gnolls<br/>
tend to be lower level and lesser too so if yer can try there. As for loot,<br/>
the orcs give anywhere from silver to gold and sometimes rusty weapons and<br/>
ringmail armor. Named orc and gnoll will spawn occasionally who will<br/>
SOMETIMES load Shiny brass halberd and Polished granite tomahawk<br/>
respectively. They are about 20+ level i think but mostly, people will camp<br/>
there to steal kill them since the weapons fetch quite a good price on the<br/>
market.<br/>

&gt;Noticed that the higher lvl guys always visit highpass nowadays.  May I<br/>
&gt;know where is it?  What monsters (lvl?), loots can be found there?  Thx.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Until now, I still dun get it why armor like woven cost so much higher than<br/>
&gt;clothes if woven is just 1 AC more than clothe items?  No doubt they r<br/>
&gt;magical, but does the &#39;magical&#39; feature give extra protection other than<br/>
&gt;the 1 AC more?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m now looking for a nice pair of earrings, preferably something that can<br/>
&gt;boost my INT or AGI by at least 2.  Any advice?  Pricing?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
