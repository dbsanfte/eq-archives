Therefore<br/>\n&gt; i have decided to make a Gnomish Necromancer in the Prexus server and<br/>\n&gt; see how it goes. Being a new server, less people would probably be<br/>\n&gt; there, and thus the initial xp gain should be speedy enough. Anyone<br/>\n&gt; who is willing to switch servers for a while to try out the class they<br/>\n&gt; always wanted, but not able to bear to leave their main characters can<br/>\n&gt; always join me. )My nick there would probably be Gandalf but if server<br/>\n&gt; does not allow it, then Khadgar or Leshrac.
