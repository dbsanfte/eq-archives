Zand,<br/>\n&gt; please give out the items to the people as I have listed down with you.<br/>\n&gt; Especially Weadaenye, whom I&#39;m guilty as hell to got her into a living hell.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Please help me tell the follow people of my quiting and hope to see<br/>\n&gt; them again sometime on another game another time and Best wishes to them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Daedor, Aildiin, Iyenya, Ironbuket, Hoppy, Kitiarra, Stella,<br/>\n&gt; Saintly, Valadine, Millie, Silph, Lunatictiara, Ader, Fost, Sparrow,<br/>\n&gt; Demitry, Wlyven, Anima and Nismo/Volk (they are brothers sharing the same<br/>\n&gt; account).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Everquest was, had been and enjoyable game at the beginning but due<br/>\n&gt; to the way that the game is designed it reminds me more of Evercamp,<br/>\n&gt; Everbitch etc etc. It has become a torture to enter the &quot;game&quot; each day now.<br/>\n&gt; This incident has at least freed me from Evercrack as some would say it is.<br/>\n&gt; So farewell my fellow guildmates. And may your time in Everquest be as your<br/>\n&gt; first day, with new and exciting adventures each day.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Garren The Broken Paladin.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
