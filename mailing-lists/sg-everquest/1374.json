Truth is, the father of the person I shared an EQ account with wipe off ALL my characters in Cazic, including my dear lvl 39 enchanter, Sabella Estasis. <br/>\n  KNN, I went around and ask my kakis at the other establish servers (Fenin Fo, Veeshan etc...) and found out that I&#39;m one of the highest lvl enchanter in ALL of the freaking servers and she has to be killed. <br/>\n<br/>\n  LKW wrote: <br/>\n<br/>\n    From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n    Ya, Sereph USED to play in Cazic with his LVL 40 enchanter.  Happened that <br/>\n    one day he know all other locals play in Innoruuk.  He wanna join us so <br/>\n    much tat he make a non-returnable path - he deleted his LVL 40 enchanter <br/>\n    and create a band new gu niang bard to join us at Innoruuk, we are all so <br/>\n    touched and everyone help him to regain his lvl - by giving him stuffs, <br/>\n    power-training him etc.  Now he is lvl 20 bard who can start to kick asses <br/>\n    ard. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Hey why are you still in Cazic???  Delete ya lvl 18 magi and come to join <br/>\n    us at Innoruuk lah.  There is SO MUCH fun and benefits playing with all of <br/>\n    us: <br/>\n    - Free goodies.  We practice family &quot;pass-down&quot;.  When Garren get a thug <br/>\n    robe which he cannot used, he pass to me FOC!  When I get a goss robe, I <br/>\n    pass my thug robe to flyingfox.  Basically we pass all the goodies ard - <br/>\n    esp when we looted something which our char cant use.  So far I got <br/>\n    woven/das stuffs from Yiyang and Leshrec, Robes from Garren, JK Skill from <br/>\n    Sereph etc etc.  I also pass RTS, Skull etc ard. <br/>\n    - Easy teaming.  As compare to my japanese wiz friend, who is 3-4 lvl above <br/>\n    me b4 I join the local kakis teams, I lvl much more faster.  The 2nd time I <br/>\n    see my jap friend, I&#39;m already 4 lvl above him!  Now he also join us and <br/>\n    shortly after joining us, he boost his lvl from 14 to 20 in a very short <br/>\n    time.  PLUS the fact tat local kakis are are VERY UNITED and TRUST-WORTHY - <br/>\n    we will never leave u behind when it come to life-&-death situation, except <br/>\n    for YY, haha.  On top of that, you will never have problem getting hunting <br/>\n    party in server coz anytime you login, u see local kakis.  We play till as <br/>\n    late as 4am during weekdays, and till morning for weekends ;) <br/>\n    - We are all under the same guild.  Tat means it&#39;s very easy to get in <br/>\n    touch using the guildsay command.  Limited to 20 friends only?  NP man, use <br/>\n    guildsay and get everyone with ya fingers. <br/>\n    - So far we have all classes except SK, ranger and rogue.  For local kakis <br/>\n    we got 2 wiz, 1 magi, 1 enchant, 1 necro for casters. <br/>\n    - BEST OF ALL, you can borrow money from our rich man Garren.  He offer <br/>\n    interest free loan.  Sometime u can even confuse him (since he lent money <br/>\n    to so many pple) and no need to return, hahah. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Ziltus (Master Brewer, Excellent Smith, 6th circle Wiz). <br/>\n<br/>\n    On Sunday, 25 July, 1999 9:10 PM, Entreri [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a>] <br/>\n    wrote: <br/>\n    &gt; From: &quot;Entreri&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; Im not too sure who plays on Cazic Thule..sereph?hehe <br/>\n    &gt; However,most singaporeans reside on the Innoruuk Server.You might wanna <br/>\n    join <br/>\n    &gt; us here. <br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; Kenven <br/>\n    &gt; DarkElven Warrior of the 15th Circle <br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; Entreri <br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; Email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drizzt@...\">drizzt@...</a> <br/>\n    &gt; ICQ UIN: 2326860 <br/>\n    &gt; Previewer, Singularity Gaming Network <br/>\n    &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sg-gaming.net\">http://www.sg-gaming.net</a> <br/>\n    &gt; Your Single Source of Everything Gaming <br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; .plan at <br/>\n    &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=\">http://www.wplan.com/cgibin/directplan.cgi?name=Entreri&viewpass=</a> <br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; -----Original Message----- <br/>\n    &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polarcoordinates@...\">polarcoordinates@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polarcoordinates@...\">polarcoordinates@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n    &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt; <br/>\n    &gt; Date: Sunday, July 25, 1999 5:20 PM <br/>\n    &gt; Subject: [sg-everquest] Anyone playing on Cazic Thule? <br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polarcoordinates@...\">polarcoordinates@...</a> <br/>\n    &gt; &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; &gt;I am playing on Cazic, level 18 Mage.
