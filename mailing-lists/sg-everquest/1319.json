Although most of us are in the Qui H`oom Dai guild, I feel we should set up our own guild. This is for several reasons. Firstly, it would let us communicate easier with each other and have a sense of belonging. Although Qui H`oom Dai contains quite a lot of Singapore players, nothing beats having our own guild since we would not be strangers to each other. Secondly, we have seen members in our present guild who does things which are not of our principles. IE steal killing and being too verbose. If we have our own guild, we could maintain a sense of order in the guild and keep out the unwanted type of players. There are of course other reasons but these I feel are the major ones. Of course, I have nothing against Qui H`oom Dai guild or its leader, in fact I say the guild is wholely very friendly and helpful. Although this issue has been brought up before, I feel this is the time we should take it into consideration since we are mostly of rather average levels and should be able to take care of ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeshrec Kalesk&#39;Thor High Elven Wizard of the Seventh Circle</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
