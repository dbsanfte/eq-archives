Earth Ele cast a short duration stun spell. This is noticeable if you fight spell<br/>\ncasting mobs with your pet like treants. The stun part is often resisted.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Bolt as long as you have a clear line of vision before you cast the spell will chase<br/>\nthe mob around, even if it went behind you.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.

Hmm, I think it&#39;s the other way round leh.  Bolt cast faster than shock,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;but it&#39;s non-guided missle and normally slightly higher dam, LOS is also a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;factor when targeting.  Let me check my bolt and shock casting time<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tonight.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bolt takes longer to cast as least for my current lvl.  Funny is that IT IS a guided<br/>\n&gt; missile! ;)  Maybe it is lag, but last night, when Fesse and I were kiting the qeynos<br/>\n&gt; guard, I can hit the guard with my cinder bolt even he is behind me!  The only thing u<br/>\n&gt; have to make sure is that there is nothing blocking on the way.  With the shock, the<br/>\n&gt; mob should stand within your view else it will failed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2. Alamak, every class also complain, hehe, grass-elsewhere-greener<br/>\n&gt; &gt;syndrome I guess.  At least u magi nuke next to wiz, PLUS u got a pet to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tank for u..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think Verant has made a pretty balance class system here. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;3. I&#39;m talking abt the range lvl 34-38.  Magi dd inflict higher dam than<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Wiz lah, no arguement on that.  FF&#39;s lvl 34 dd is more than 310, while my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lvl 34 dd is only 30X.  But even magi with a higher dd, I can easily draw<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mob to me but not the other way round.  My death at lvl 35 with FF (lvl 34<br/>\n&gt; &gt;magi) and Zan (lvl 35 magi) prove it ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have found something quite interesting here.  Just yesterday, I got the staff of<br/>\n&gt; Writhing when I was in HH.  Once I tried to melee the pickclaw, they will come to me<br/>\n&gt; instead of my partners.  This may either due to 1)  the - CHA effect that makes u most<br/>\n&gt; hated 2) u hit the mob too hard together with your staff and DD.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;4. Magi is more of a supporting/nuking role in a grp, where wiz is pure<br/>\n&gt; &gt;nuker.  There is no arguement magi is the 2nd best nuker after wiz.  And<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with ya lvl 49 dd spell of 900dam, you guys are not 1/2 wiz coz our highest<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dd spell is only 1200 (ie ya&#39;s is 75% of ours, not 50%), plus the fact u<br/>\n&gt; &gt;guys can get tat spell easier and cast faster.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The real problem is most high lvl hunting place is dungeon where a magi is not<br/>\n&gt; welcomed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;5. Overall speaking, other than dungeon, magi shld survive better than wiz,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;if u play well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; See?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good Hunting,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FlyingFox Everest, Magician at his 35<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
