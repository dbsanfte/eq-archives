Never knew the Asians are so united.<br/>\nIn my years of online gaming, the Asians that I meet are selfish %^&*$%@^#$.<br/>\n&lt;grins&gt; Maybe that creates the negative image.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you know Dundee? Damocles? Jeff Boy? Canticle? Magnus? Those are great<br/>\nguys. I sure do look forward to meeting them in E&#39;ci.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the GMs and Tower deeds etc...doesn&#39;t everyone own one? &lt;grins&gt;<br/>\nSorry, my rastic humour is up again.

Together<br/>\n&gt; with TTW and DWN, we are always fighting for the #2 biggest.  #1 in Baja<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; Asia, which is made up of several HK/TW guilds.  tDw is one pure guild<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; started off as local guild (formed within 2 weeks after UO launched in<br/>\n&gt; S&#39;pore) and slowly expanded to the the biggest single international guild<br/>\n&gt; (includes members from US, HK, Japan, S. Korea, Taiwan, Austrialia, UK,<br/>\n&gt; etc).  TWW, I think, is also one guild by itself while DWN is form by<br/>\n&gt; several groups of players to make up the player-run town called Kingdom of<br/>\n&gt; Dawn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We are very well established in term of skills and resources (we have 20<br/>\n&gt; over guild buildings, including keep, tower, 2-Ss, big brick etc, at one<br/>\n&gt; time, but reduced after the house patch is in as we do not have so many<br/>\n&gt; mules to hold the buildings).  Other than GM mage/tank mages in the guild,<br/>\n&gt; we also have several GM smiths, GM bowyers, GM alchemists, GM scribes, GM<br/>\n&gt; bards (provokers), GM carpenters/tinkers etc.  We even have GM poisoner<br/>\n&gt; (assasin) and GM detective, hehe.  As as today, I still have a castle<br/>\ndeed,<br/>\n&gt; a keep deed and a tower deed reserved for future guild village in T2A, not<br/>\n&gt; to include other 2-S, big brick, big smithy house deeds ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We also own one of the most popular shops in Baja, The Asmandi (a big<br/>\nbrick<br/>\n&gt; house within west britain guard zone), which have more than 3000 visitors<br/>\n&gt; hits, selling only GM suberb stuffs at very reasonable price.  In the shop<br/>\n&gt; we have standard price list which all vendors owners must comply (imagine<br/>\n&gt; 600gp for full AR30 plate set, all reagents at 1gp above npc shop etc) to<br/>\n&gt; ensure the best quality stuffs sold as the most reasonable prices.  The<br/>\n&gt; shop is also well-known for it Charity Chest (a shop wreck metal chest<br/>\n&gt; locked-down in the shop), where players can leave their unwanted suffs so<br/>\n&gt; that newbies can find something useful from it.  Pls do not think that the<br/>\n&gt; chest is a trash bin, as newbies always find goodies inside, including<br/>\n&gt; magical weapons ;)  I myself can throw 20-30 magical stuffs inside in one<br/>\n&gt; shot.  The shop also provide free usage of training/thief dummies, forge,<br/>\n&gt; anvil etc open to all players.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you play around Baja server down time, often you will see a horde of<br/>\n&gt; black horsemen in Cov entrance, Britain X-road or Britain cemetry, esp<br/>\nCov,<br/>\n&gt; where we rules the place most of the time.  Our guild page is also the<br/>\n&gt; hosted in Singularity Game site.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just wanna introduce tDw to more locals players ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dark Flame<br/>\n&gt; The Dark Wardens Guild Master<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://reddawn.s-one.net.sg/uo/tdw/\">http://reddawn.s-one.net.sg/uo/tdw/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p/s: tDw is one of the most reputatable ANTIS guilds in Baja.  No noto<br/>\n&gt; hunting, looting, murdering, stealing is allowed in guild, offenders may<br/>\n&gt; even face severve punishment of guild KOS.  No tDws will hunt any grey<br/>\n&gt; players in the game, unless:<br/>\n&gt; - We know from past experiences that the grey chap is a baddy.<br/>\n&gt; - We see it with our own eyes that the grey chap has done something bad.<br/>\n&gt; When we said we are ANTIS, we role-played as one.  ;) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
