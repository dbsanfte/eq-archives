Gate spell DON&#39;T WORK! Wizard GG work though<br/>\n2. You should always have levitate on. There are Wraiths there that cast<br/>\nGravity Flux for 300dmg a pop, to your whole group if you are without<br/>\nlevitate<br/>\n3. Nearly everything in the plane can fear, so boast your magic resist<br/>\nup<br/>\n4. Many things here can Harm Touch too, and their HT is unresistable,<br/>\nunlike PC SK&#39;s HT.<br/>\n5. It rains blood there.<br/>\n6. There is only one zone barrier to get back, if you are not a Wiz, but<br/>\nthe barrier is guarded by CT.<br/>\n7. CT is fucked up huge. Around 1 and the half the height of an SG, and<br/>\nhas several pets(all con yellow to me)<br/>\n8. If possible, do not get hit. You&#39;ll get randomly teleported and might<br/>\ngo LD during this period (happen to 2 members of the 2nd group that was<br/>\nin CT this morning)<br/>\n9. Zone is VERY unstable. Was about to crash, but heng my group GG off.<br/>\nOther group, as sway as they were before, got killed when the zone get<br/>\nback by CT himself.<br/>\n10. If GM not online, don&#39;t think of going to CT, you need them to get<br/>\nyour corpse after the zone crash, else, it&#39;s impossible to get your<br/>\ncorpse.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
