How u know ya skill max<br/>\n out?  How can u make $ via fishing?  Do u really catch fishes and sell?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;A pole costs 20 silver. Each fish sold is 2 silver. That makes it that you<br/>\nhave to sell 10 fishes to get back your cost price. You will be losing money<br/>\nwithin the first 25 skill pt range. After that, I made 1 plat an hour. Small<br/>\nmoney but nice talking to all those elf babes &lt;drools&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I cannot buy decent food/drink. I buy those grapes and wines and in<br/>\nthe<br/>\n end dunno how to consume them ;(<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Leave those grapes and wines alone. If I am right, you cannot drink from<br/>\nbottle, with exception of milk. Stick to Muffins and Milk! Best Value for<br/>\nmoney! Also, those muffins weight only 0.1 wt! Super light!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I just bought a old great stave.  Better than my dagger.  Can I max out<br/>\nmy 2H blunt skill by using the stave to hunt all time, w/o using up<br/>\n practising point on it?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From the 1pt to 20pt range of gaining skill is always damn slow.<br/>\nSenseheading for example, I can sit down and watch friends and keep tabbing<br/>\non it but only increase to &lt;3&gt;! After 20, it will go up steady! Now to<br/>\nanswer your question, YES.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I rise a lvl, I use the points on some skills<br/>\n but yet it remain awkful, why?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Put only 1 practise point in every new skill you acquire.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I use my skill points on those skills<br/>\n with the coin symbols - chanelling and alteration, is it ok?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;When a coin symbol appears, that means your skill is at 20 or above and<br/>\nyou have to pay to train.<br/>\n<br/>\nWilson aka Yutaka </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
