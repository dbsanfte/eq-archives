My <br/>\nfriend Woodbridge start a new wood-elf ranger char and I was busy helping <br/>\nhim.  I also need to help Flyingfox to get a dagger b4 I can get back to <br/>\nFP.  FYI the other Hong Kong members from the guild, including Ling (lvl 21 <br/>\nwiz) and Deadflower (lvl 16 Bard), will be joining us.  Hopefully with <br/>\nGarren&#39;s help, we can quickly loot at least 2 daggers (for FF n Ling) b4 we <br/>\nmove back to FP.  Btw FF drop lvl when he died few times in Unrest last <br/>\nnight, back to lvl 19.  We need to power gain xp when we go back to HH. <br/>\n Most probably this weekends (esp the night), u will see 3 nukers (Ling, FF <br/>\nand me) blasting day and night there.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
