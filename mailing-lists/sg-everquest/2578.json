Now I got Magic in my team, he got 90 plus mech,<br/>\n&gt; use him to go around picking locks and looting stuffs, save alot of money.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for explosion, never use so far.  When selecting merc, I go for one with<br/>\n&gt; high markmanship, high stats. My char still stuck in STR, dunno what to<br/>\n&gt; train with to increase STR.  CGW say find something to hit, I try those<br/>\n&gt; sparring bags in Kingpin club but cannot use them.  Can teach? ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Thursday, 14 October, 1999 11:50 AM, Ebon Praetor<br/>\n&gt; [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kelc@...\">kelc@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Ebon Praetor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kelc@...\">kelc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From:                 LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject:              RE: [sg-everquest] Guild Matters<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey I forget how to climb to roof, can teach me?  During my 1st<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mission I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; did it once, coz one enemy on roof, but later forget how to go abt<br/>\n&gt; doing it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; again ;)  CGW Nov issue has some good tips on how to rise ya merc&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; stats<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and skills.  Worth take a look.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get your merc right up next to the wall... then click and drag up...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all the way. Only flat roofs can be climbed up onto. It&#39;s just like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; changing stance... for example, when changing stance from prone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to standing, you click on the merc and drag up, you will see 2 up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; arrows next to him, right? Drag somemore, and you will see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; another kind of &quot;ladder&quot; arrow if you are next to a roof.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; By the time the CGW article came out, I had pumped my merc&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; STR and AGI to +10 liao.... *heh* I regret one thing though... I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should have set explosives and mechanical to zero... *sigh*<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Love is in the air...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get me a gas mask, quick!!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cya,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Praetor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Praetor@...\">Praetor@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; ICQ 1767778<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
