After that, I happilly log out of CT, and went to<br/>\n&gt; Inno, to do a bit of the Stein quest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night, while I was hunting birdies with Kalandra in lake, using my<br/>\n&gt; cleric, I ganna GM warp to Qeynos Aquaducts(aka GM torture room) for<br/>\n&gt; questioning. During this time, I was totally LD, and Kalandra&#39;s HP was<br/>\n&gt; quite criticle when I got back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why did the damn GM teleport me for? Well, they think that the reason<br/>\n&gt; why my enchanter is leveling up so quicky is because I&#39;m either hacking<br/>\n&gt; their servers or exploiting bugs. I yell at them for several minutes,<br/>\n&gt; made some rude signs, and they agree to let me go, while they<br/>\n&gt; investigate the matter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This morning, log in to CT, play for a while, then another blasted GM,<br/>\n&gt; this time an a Verant admin, and he/she/it apologize for the treatment<br/>\n&gt; they did and will discuss some more, about my request, to keep this<br/>\n&gt; thing harsh harsh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pray that the request is done because..... my request was for a server<br/>\n&gt; teleport to Innoruuk :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sabella Anna Estasis, Enchanter of the 12th Rank.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PS: Ogre bouncers gives relative good XP if you can kill them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
