H/w, EQ does understand the<br/>\n&gt; popularity of anti-virus s/w and other commonly used utilities s/w like<br/>\n&gt; Norton safe guard - so these kinda s/w will not affect the loading of ya<br/>\n&gt; EQ.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for other s/w like MIE, ICQ etc, you can&#39;t run them together with EQ.<br/>\n&gt;  Even if you can, you can&#39;t switch between them and EQ since EQ will crash<br/>\n&gt; when u do so.  This is also a measure to prevent 3rd party EQ s/w to macro<br/>\n&gt; training or cheating I guess.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ziltus<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Saturday, June 26, 1999 10:39 PM, hans ng [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nahemah@...\">nahemah@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: hans ng &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nahemah@...\">nahemah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i cant seem to work eq while downloadin stuff newsgroups....have any of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; u tried havin someother program run in the background b4? i know my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; norton anti virus has started up by itself b4 while i m in eq with out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interuptin my game so while cant i DL stuff andplay?????<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
