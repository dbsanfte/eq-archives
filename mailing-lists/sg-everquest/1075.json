This test will last approximately one<br/>\n&gt; week. If you choose to play during this time, please understand that<br/>\n&gt; it will be under PvP - Teams rules and that you are subject to being<br/>\n&gt; player killed. If you are not confortable with this, we suggest<br/>\n&gt; playing on our live servers until we return to the test server to<br/>\n&gt; regular rules.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In addition to testing the PvP Teams code, we will also be testing the<br/>\n&gt; balance of the initial teams, the allowable PK level spread, etc.<br/>\n&gt; Please keep in mind that any or all of these rules are subject to<br/>\n&gt; change at any time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The teams are as follows:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Team 1<br/>\n&gt; High Elf<br/>\n&gt; Wood Elf<br/>\n&gt; Half-Elf<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Team 2<br/>\n&gt; Dwarf<br/>\n&gt; Gnome<br/>\n&gt; Halfling<br/>\n&gt; Team 3<br/>\n&gt; Human<br/>\n&gt; Barbarian<br/>\n&gt; Erudite<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Team 4<br/>\n&gt; Ogre<br/>\n&gt; Troll<br/>\n&gt; Dark Elf<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This means that any member of one team may be PK&#39;d by a member of any<br/>\n&gt; of the other 3 teams, but not my a member of their own team.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have increased the level limits for PvP to +/-8 levels as opposed<br/>\n&gt; to the +/-4 that exists in Rallos Zek (normal PvP server).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here is a short list of some other changes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PvP Faction Hits have been removed until we can implement an aggressor<br/>\n&gt; flag (IF we decide to).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If a character is killed by someone with his or her PK flag ON (+pvp),<br/>\n&gt; they will return from death with Zero Mana. This is to address the<br/>\n&gt; &#39;naked mage syndrome&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Warriors have been upgraded with more Hit Points, better innate<br/>\n&gt; magical resistance, and a chance to critical hit above and beyond<br/>\n&gt; normal critical hits in combat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pets can no longer open locked doors.
