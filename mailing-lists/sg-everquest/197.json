But I *believe* at later stages hor, you can get much better<br/>\narmour. I will try to assist you in finding out if I ever get the chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only true weap we got is our spells ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I heard tanking was tough? Or do your use pets?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I never asked any pple for armor/weap after I died - since they<br/>\n doesn&#39;t help much and I&#39;m prepare to die again in the course of retrieving<br/>\n my corpse, hehe, so dun waste others&#39; money ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Cool! Same pattern as you.<br/>\n<br/>\nH/w, I&#39;ve just shifted house last wekkend and now my house is in a mess -<br/>\nHopefully u guys dun increase lvl too much, so that I can<br/>\n still group with u guys, hahahahahahahah ;-?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Aiyo! Don&#39;t worry! We can still group no matter what ;-) but not for too<br/>\nlong if the gap is REAL big...<br/>\n<br/>\nWilson aka Yutaka </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
