Any tips on where to go hunting around this lvl?&quot;<br/>\nI desperately need plats and exp! (think plats come first...). I have only got about<br/>\n5 plats at lvl 7...this is pathetic right?? Have yet to even buy armor/weapons...<br/>\nso far all those i use were picked up...yeah..had to scavenge orcs and pixies... =(<br/>\nOf course i&#39;m still on Fawdyer...think I&#39;ll be here awhile more...i even got killed by <br/>\nGiant Spiders/Zombies in Lesser Faydark. Think i really need a lvl 8 pet!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo back to main point...if you guys can make any recommendations...would be much appreciated!<br/>\nPreferably an area in Fawdyer first..then more later =)<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I know fishing probably doesn&#39;t even come close to trade skills at making money...but is<br/>\nit actually even worth trying for some cash? In Felwithe, one fish can sell for about 4 silver plus..<br/>\nso ten is 4 gp. 100 is 4 plats!! Siong man.... Unless got better fishing ponds? Maybe got those with<br/>\nstingray or shark? Then BBQ the stingray can charge more right?? *LOL*<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing...can we actually buy and sell stuff to different towns and make $$$??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHope to hear from you guys,<br/>\nSynzzz aka Zanderion (EQ)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
