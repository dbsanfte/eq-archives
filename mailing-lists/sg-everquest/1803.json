Shouldn&#39;t QHD be enough? Could be the question you are going to<br/>\n&gt; throw at me later, and I&#39;ll answer them AGAIN.<br/>\n<br/>\nYES!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; QHD has several lamers these days, and on top of that, it&#39;s hyper<br/>\n&gt; inactive in activities. When was the last time, the guild got together<br/>\n&gt; to do something? It acts more like a glorified shout channel. Also, when<br/>\n&gt; we are planning kakis only activities and have to resort to guildsay to<br/>\n&gt; communicate, random goons might join in, and ruin the experience for us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As a result, I propose that we get this thing together and prepare for<br/>\n&gt; the guild formation by Wednesday.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Basically, what I want you to do is answer this question:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Quit QHD and form a local kaki guild, yay or nay?<br/>\n<br/>\nYAY!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then these question if you say yay:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Who should be the goondu in charge?<br/>\n<br/>\nANY GOON ALSO CAN AS LONG AS NOT ME!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Who should be the officals for recruiting?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nANY GOONS ALSO CAN... BUT NOT EVERYONE AND I THINK ITS GOOD TO TRY OUT THE<br/>\nPERSON HE JOIN&gt; ANY CHANCE OF RUIN THE GUILD NAME HES OUT. NOT CLEAN, HES<br/>\nOUT. TALK TOO MUCH, HES OUT.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The charter, who is willing to type it?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHOSE DAMN FREE ONES LOR. WHO ELSE GOT DFAMN HOLIDAYS TO PLAY?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Website, for the thousand time, anyone can get one ASAP?<br/>\n<br/>\nERR.. TOT WE HAD ONE WITH  SG  RITE?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Recruting guidlines, think, and give me your opinion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nSAY ALREADY<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Start a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\n&gt; For details on ONElist&#39;s NEW FRIENDS & FAMILY program, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
