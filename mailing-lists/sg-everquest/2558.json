I began the email with an intro explaining that I had copied it from a Mage board. <br/>\nI think the post I copied was the one by the high level mage that says GZ hates Magicians. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, here is his response. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  quote: <br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  As a young Arch-Mage I was traumatized by a rogue Air Elemental who for<br/>\n  some reason sung &quot;I am Henry the 5th, I am&quot; for fourteen hours without stop.<br/>\n  Because of this, I have hated Magicians for most of my career. <br/>\n  Seriously though, the reason that we toned down the really high level<br/>\n  pets is that they were doing excessive damage. As you can probably guess,<br/>\n  we don&#39;t like to tone things down - we get a lot of bad press, and I get a<br/>\n  ton of unhappy e-mail. I dislike both. Therefore, the only time we do nerf<br/>\n  things is if we feel they are broken enough to warrent the change. This was<br/>\n  something where we felt that we needed to make the change. <br/>\n<br/>\n  There are a few new things going in for Magicians this patch, and a few<br/>\n  for the next patch. These are aimed both at making the Magicians more fun<br/>\n  to play and helping them to find a place in a party. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Check the next few patches and see what you think. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Geoffrey C.
