He finds its takes too long to<br/>\nSolo-Lvl at 16th for a Shaman. I dont blame him,casters will find it more<br/>\ndiff to Solo when they get higer lvl. I have read that  monks too will have<br/>\nsome diff. when monks reach 25th. it going to be tougher. Con&#39; msg changes<br/>\nagain to 2 types of Green, 3-4 types of Blue msg.<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ being a Group game will &quot;force&quot; player to be group and team. An &quot;old&quot; EQ<br/>\nmonk friend name  &quot;Chien&quot; whom started off the same time as me is now a Lvl<br/>\n36th monk. He been trying to avoid being &quot;guilded&quot; into a Guild. But now is<br/>\nwith the &quot;Apo Knights&quot; becos his regualr Kakis r in that Guild and I noticed<br/>\na slowed down on his lvling , my guess is that so he could &quot;group&quot; with his<br/>\nbuddies , partly also is get tougher to lvl as u go higer.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe following parargrah is not about xp lvling is bout soloing and enjoying<br/>\nkillin the nasties that u like to kill over and over again. 8-)<br/>\nI had tried a &quot;back-ward&quot; lvling trick(original idea) to hit nasties that<br/>\ncons Green to me at 19th lvl but r Blue at 18th. I max out melee skills at<br/>\n19th on the first bubble. Commited sucide and be killed 3-4 times and go<br/>\nback to 18th. I killed the &quot;Blue&quot; nasties easy since my melee is max at 19th<br/>\nlvl. The purpose is obviously not for xp or lvls. It for easy money and<br/>\nkills. Now i&#39;ve tried this on lvl 20th it didnt work too well since i got a<br/>\nnew skill, &quot;Eagle strike&quot; on this lvl. When i backward lvl. I &quot;Lost&quot; that<br/>\nnew Skill, since  &quot;Eagle Strike&quot; is not avaible for lvl 19.Ok i have side<br/>\nTracked. sorri.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions to overcome some of the Soloing problem?<br/>\nPerhaps more informal expeditions and Gatherings need to be organise, not<br/>\nonly for weekends but any other days. Need not be to new far away places.<br/>\nSome where need by with decent loot and decent xp. Whats imporatant  is the<br/>\nenjoyment.<br/>\n<br/>\nANy one for Paw or Permfrost?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYiyang at FP</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
