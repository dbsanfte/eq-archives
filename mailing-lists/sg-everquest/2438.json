Average PL is 30%, and got freeze many times,<br/>\n&gt;from 5sec to 2 min (that&#39;s when I was killed in najena, by bonecracker).<br/>\n&gt; With this kinda connection, better dun hunt and do some maintenance<br/>\n&gt;instead, like selling stuffs, casting spells in town to rise casting skills<br/>\n&gt;or do some inventory spring cleaning ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now I gotta think twice b4 getting cyberway $48 unlimited plan.  The<br/>\n&gt;surfing also sux as compared to $ingnet.  Is cyberway abnormally laggy last<br/>\n&gt;night and just as per normal days?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ziltus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Tuesday, 21 September, 1999 8:24 PM, Tommy Fong<br/>\n&gt;[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tommyfong@...\">tommyfong@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Tommy Fong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tommyfong@...\">tommyfong@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; On Tue, 21 Sep 1999 18:16:23 +0800, Sereph wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Ganna drag there by FF around midnight yesterday to take a place in a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;group he was in there.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hmm...... I think it was u who ask me to accept u to my group? LOL......<br/>\n&gt; I think it is a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; good idea to quit hunting once U got bad PL or lag.
