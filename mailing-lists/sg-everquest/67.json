Feign<br/>\nDeath?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I save them, haven&#39;t touched any yet. You might want to save pts for Safe<br/>\nFall instead of Feign Death.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Any &quot;spare&quot; mesh armor u guy wanna sell? (to me)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I do want some if you have extra &lt;grins&gt; You must be a monk ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Whats the usual time U ppl play in EQ?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I clocked 7 hours on SAT, playing a barbarian and a human. Actaully, spent<br/>\nmost of the time talking about crap with people while fishing.<br/>\n<br/>\nEver noticed majority of us Singys are monks? Will be happy to have Entreri<br/>\nthe DarkElf with us. Still wonder who would play a female ogre...&lt;Yikes, the<br/>\nthought scares me...my lunch is comin&#39; up my throat&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Argh!
