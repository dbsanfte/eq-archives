Costs about 2pp a full suit so its darn cheap. Later in the game then slowly upgrade. I started off with PW too then slowly change to cloth &lt;monk&gt;. From cloth tunic to Snakeskin, from cap to Headband etc. You get my point right? But seriously, I&#39;d just save money for a combine weapon first. Then get a full suit of banded. Then a well-balanced long sword ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;Wilson aka Yutaka </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
