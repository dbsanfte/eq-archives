As in my previous mail, I dun mind sparing <br/>\n10-20pp, which I believe can use to purchase quite a descent set of newbie <br/>\nequipements tat can last u for the 1st 5-8 lvls at least.  I do that to my <br/>\nwiz friend in Inno and he is still using those stuffs at lvl 12 ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, I also didnt power train my friend&#39;s wiz.  I tried once power train <br/>\nhis ranger char and buy him weap/armor.  In the end he dun have much EQ <br/>\nexperience (not experience &#39;points&#39;!) like those who started in scratch and <br/>\nlost his corpse (lvl 7 or 8) after dying (cant locate his corpse) - waste <br/>\nmy money and time. After tat I ask him to think clearly what he wanan be <br/>\nand he selected wiz.  I passed some pp to him, buying a set of clothes, and <br/>\nsome lvl 1 & 4 spells and I leave him to &quot;rot&quot;, heheh.  Now he is already <br/>\nlvl 12 wiz, able to stand on his own.  Tat&#39;s why I never believe in power <br/>\ntwinking & baby-sitting others ;)  No doubts it&#39;s very shiok to wear ROO, <br/>\nSOO, glowing stein etc at lvl 1 wiz, but ultimately u will also miss alot <br/>\nof &quot;knowledge and wisdom (fun)&quot;, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nLes and FF will be in a better position to explain an incident where we <br/>\nmeet a &#39;super-blur-fu*k&#39; power-twinked lvl 40 magi when we camp in Najena <br/>\nfor FBR, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: Part-time baby-sitting is still accepted by me.  If u training a <br/>\nranger, i guess our guild shld be able to help u out abit in lvling, since <br/>\nnow most of us can handle things well and we just need someone to track for <br/>\nnamed mob ;)<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: Most of us are playing good races, except Nica and Kenven.  If u start <br/>\nevil race char and hang ard evil race region, we wont be able to help u too <br/>\noften ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Friday, 03 September, 1999 3:39 PM, Sereph [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Sereph &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garford@...\">garford@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My idea of twinkering is like this.
