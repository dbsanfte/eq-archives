Which shard <br/>\nu play?<br/>\n<br/>\nActually Asia has approached us for alliance b4, but problem is the guild <br/>\nexpands so fast that many noto hunters/pkers are also inside Asia now (some <br/>\nof them even fight with us before when they noto hunt).  It make us very <br/>\nuncomfortable allied with them, esp they asked for war-declared allies (ie <br/>\nboth side declare war, not for the sake of fighting but more for helping <br/>\none another when in need).  When we talked abt allies, we refer to those <br/>\nlong-term trust-worthy ones, like our more than a yr ally - TAA.  As <br/>\nallies, we share lots of our resources with them, eg providing free vendor <br/>\nshop for them, invitation them for most guild activities etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nProblem in UO is land is so scare that there is NO WAY to put anything <br/>\nbigger than a small house.  On the other hand, there r so many stuffs to <br/>\nstore in UO, haha.  I really look forward to see how EQ manage inventory. <br/>\n Any exisitng EQ players can share your experience?  How many items can u <br/>\ncarry in UO, how u keep &#39;stock&#39;, how to transfer stuffs amg chars of same <br/>\nacct etc? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, is Innoruuk the one Gary mentioned w/o any lag?  Maybe we shld set up a <br/>\nLocal EQ msg board  for all local players to get togather discussing the <br/>\ngame.  I dun mind setting up one as my UO site already shifted to <br/>\nSingularity ;)  Maybe 1st thing we need to discuss which server is the best <br/>\nand has more locals, then new comers at least know which way they shld go <br/>\n;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tuesday, April 27, 1999 6:48 PM, Wilson [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ritzbits@...\">ritzbits@...</a>] <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Wilson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ritzbits@...\">ritzbits@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kudos to you.
