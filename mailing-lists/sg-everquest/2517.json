UO will be implementing <br/>\na major item patch tomorrow, and I spend my weekend preparing for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter this item patch, a skill management patch will come shortly, which <br/>\ngreatly enhance the role-playing element of UO.  With this skill patch, I <br/>\nwill do lots of macroing when I sleep at night, hehe, till I get all the <br/>\nchars I want.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith all these new patches, UO is becoming a much better game.  I must <br/>\nadmit I&#39;m kinda bored with camping, lvling, hack and slash in EQ....and I <br/>\nthink there is a lack of motivation for me to login EQ, even when I have <br/>\nnothing to do at home (in the end spend time watching TV series, hehe).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to inform all that I will not show my face in EQ often in the month of <br/>\nOct, mainly due to many things I need to settle with the new UO patches <br/>\n(plus some guild matters too).  I hope EQ will still attract me after Oct, <br/>\nor else I may consider selling away my acct, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than sorting my house items during the weekend, I didnt go for any <br/>\nhunting in UO.  Meeting all my good old buddies already take up half of my <br/>\nUO login time (sparred with some of them and still kill them, hehe).  There <br/>\nis no arguement that UO has better role-playing element than EQ.  With the <br/>\ncoming patches which UO will be implement teaming, pvp etc policies like <br/>\nEQ, I think more ex-UO players will be draw back from EQ to UO (provided <br/>\nthey still have an active acct like me, coz UO just conduct a char purge <br/>\nlast Fri, to delete all chars under acct not active for 3 months).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you guys wanna play UO, I&#39;m in the Baja shard ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZiltus Planeswalker (aka Dark Flame in UO Baja shard)<br/>\n<br/>\np/s: This is not a quiting-EQ msg, dun get me wrong.  Just need to take a <br/>\nbreak from the plain hack-&-slash &#39;routine&#39; work, hehe. ;)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
