It was a great place for me as i went up 2 levels<br/>\n&gt; from 14 to 16 pretty quickly there. Much thanks<br/>\n&gt; Sereph for having helped me gain that last bubble to 16 hehe..as a<br/>\n&gt; yellow DW Caiman certainly helps with exp.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I got killed twice by SGs so far...one spawned on me i think and<br/>\n&gt; another was trained by someone running past me. Hell..<br/>\n&gt; almost got killed by a Spectre once too! Lucky i Gated while pet<br/>\n&gt; tanked it!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On to spell research...i know it&#39;s gonna be tough road from now on<br/>\n&gt; having to research...but i think it&#39;s only<br/>\n&gt; summoning spells right? (i hope!) I don&#39;t mean to be a smart aleck but<br/>\n&gt; i think lvl 16 and lvl20 pet spells can be bought<br/>\n&gt; but beyond that..probably unlikely. Dunno about that though..Thanks<br/>\n&gt; though to FF and Sereph for having<br/>\n&gt; informed me of the tough road ahead. At least i&#39;ll be mentally<br/>\n&gt; prepared..sigh..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any ideas on practice points though? I&#39;ve saved up about 50 practice<br/>\n&gt; points..not sure what to use them for right now.<br/>\n&gt; Thinking of keeping them for specialization? Hmm..any comments?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been in Oasis for awhile..but i was wondering..which mobs there<br/>\n&gt; are good for looting? I need more money..i&#39;m down<br/>\n&gt; to only 45 pp now!! Getting poor again. The orcs there any good? Only<br/>\n&gt; found one bronze weapon on them so far..but i&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; perhaps abit cautious in my attacks as i&#39;m still soloing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks once again and Good Hunting!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Zanderion (lvl 16 mage)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
