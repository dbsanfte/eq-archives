But good news tat GMs are aware that wiz are always finger-pointed<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; stealing.  It&#39;s unavoidable for wiz to nuke much faster than other races,<br/>\n&gt; but again nuking is different from stealing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I thank Garren for his support.  As a matter of fact, Sereph and I have<br/>\n&gt; launched a big complaint to Wylven.  Wylven is fully awared of it now, and<br/>\n&gt; Voy has admitted his mistake on stealing from his guild mates.  But<br/>\nfrankly<br/>\n&gt; speaking, my bigger concern is when he steal kills with our guild abbrev<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; his head.  I&#39;m confident that I won&#39;t lose kill to Voy, just that my whole<br/>\n&gt; group is meleeing the mob that day so I dun see the need to waste mana and<br/>\n&gt; Voy come in to steal.  I remember when I first meet Fiona, a lvl 12 wiz<br/>\n&gt; from Higher Order of Arcane and she help me to bind and retrieve my<br/>\ncorpse,<br/>\n&gt; I really think very high of her guild.  But nowadays I see Higher Order Of<br/>\n&gt; Arcane members stealing kills everywhere, I think they kinda sux.  I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; sure if u guys agree with me, but if Wylven only restricted Voy from<br/>\n&gt; stealing on others but not restricted Voy for been a &#39;well-reputatable&#39;<br/>\n&gt; stealer, I think I will quit from the guild.  Knn my UO guild is so<br/>\n&gt; well-known in Baja shard for been so honorable, my UO kakis will beat me<br/>\nup<br/>\n&gt; if they knew I join a stealer guild (which is as bad as looter/pking guild<br/>\n&gt; in UO).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From what I see, Wylven didnt clarify if he restricted Voy from plain<br/>\n&gt; stealing or just stealing from members.  Coz according to &#39;spy&#39;, Voy is<br/>\n&gt; stealing again this afternoon in HH.  Let see what our boss said b4 I make<br/>\n&gt; any decision.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ziltus, High Elf Wizard of the Sixth Circle<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p/s: Kakis like Garren shld know how sickening when his BCC is kena<br/>\nstolen,<br/>\n&gt; hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Sunday, 11 July, 1999 6:26 PM, Leshrec [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Leshrec&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leshrec@...\">leshrec@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hmm I don&#39;t understand why kill stealing will make a person kenna<br/>\nbanned.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well, its fustrating to players, yes but its in no way illegal. As for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; harrassment, if you find someone steal killing from you, just go to<br/>\n&gt; another<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spot. If that guy follows you EVERWHERE and steals ALL your kills then<br/>\n&gt; thats<br/>\n&gt; &gt; harrasment. Prolly that Lionessa knew the GM or something otherwise I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think GMs care much about this issue..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As of such, I don&#39;t think steal killing is right, but was just wondering<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about the ban stuff..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; btw, I&#39;m not passing through Oasis so soon, maybe in a week or two,<br/>\nafter<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; manage to get my black robe )<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &#39;* Singapore EQ Mailing List&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sg-everquest@onelist.com\">sg-everquest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Date: Monday, July 12, 1999 5:51 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [sg-everquest] Guild Stealer - Voyesbian<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: LKW &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leekw13@...\">leekw13@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Just to inform all kakis that we have a stealer from the guild, who<br/>\neven<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;steal from own guild mates.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;For those who went for the guild bash in Befallen last week, some may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;remember a lvl 9 DE wiz who went to lvl 3 of Bafallen at lvl 9.  Of<br/>\ncoz,<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;kena killed many times and Garren, Wylven and I were the last 3 who<br/>\n&gt; stayed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;with him to get most of his corpses.  At the end he still claimed he<br/>\n&gt; lost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;few pp, dvinn dagger etc which Wylven and Garren were kind enough to<br/>\n&gt; pass<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;some of their loot to him.  So that was my 1st encounter with this DE<br/>\n&gt; wiz<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;name Voyesbian.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Over the weekend, he was hunting at HH solo, and attacked some of our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;preys.  But he is too weak to steal from our group of lvl 18-20, and he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;mentioned he just wanna hit once to gain faction.  We have no objection<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;over this and we also try not to attack his prey.  He gain from lvl 9<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;lvl 13 within the weekend, which is pretty fast.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;H/w, last night while hunting at HH, I noticed he started to steal from<br/>\n&gt; our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;group.  He no longer nuke once or twice but nuke full force to get the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;kill.  FYI he is WAITING for the tanks in the group to hurt mob b4 he<br/>\n&gt; start<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to nuke.  I ask him why is he doing such thing to his own guildmate and<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;said he just need 1-3 more kills b4 he log.  The true fact is tat he is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;actually stay longer than that.  He is stealing at HH, and he steal<br/>\nfrom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;from another groups as well.  He steal so ofen that one players from<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;other guild, Lionessa, started to make noise.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I started to observe how this Voy hunt and at one time I was even<br/>\n&gt; accused<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;by Lionessa for stealing her kill, while it&#39;s actually Voy who did it<br/>\n&gt; (I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;just watching with OOM!).  I&#39;m kinda pissed to get such accuse.<br/>\nShortly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Lionessa page for a GM, and Voy log immediatelywhen GM Glim arrvived<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;(guilty I guess).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;When GM Glim arrive, I explained to him, and he understand the<br/>\nsituation<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;which wiz are always accused of stealing kills.  He also understand<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Voy who did the stealing and I&#39;m innocent.  GM Glim then went off<br/>\n&gt; shortly.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Later part of the hunt, this Lionessa come over and drop comments<br/>\nsaying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;she have make few stealers banned by GM since she played EQ for 4 mths.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; WTF?  My problem if she kill too slow?  I wanna stressed again that<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;casters in my groups NEVER steal kill, in the sense that we never wait<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;other teams to hurt the mobs for 30-40% HP b4 we start to nuke.<br/>\nMembers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;like Ling, Flyingfox, Satoru and myself hunt often but I&#39;m firm to say<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;gain xp with our hard work.  When there are groups of lvl 20s steal<br/>\nfrom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;us, we hardly make any noise but to hunt elsewhere, so I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; understand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;why cry babies like Lionessa make so much noise.  Anyway later Demitry<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;suggest to all group members to petition for players harrassment (since<br/>\n&gt; her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;words sounded SO threatening, hehe), and well, no GM come, haha.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;This is just a note to all local kakis to watch out for this member<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Voyesbian.  Not that we are not helpful but I caution all to think<br/>\ntwice<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;before helping this kinda players.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Our boss Wylven (who is unaware of this incident) made Voyesbian a<br/>\nguild<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;officer last weekend, and the thought of sharing an officer post with<br/>\n&gt; such<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;player make me sick.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Ziltus.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;p/s: U guys noticed we got more wiz in guild nowadays?  After me, Les,<br/>\n&gt; Sat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;(high elf) and Ling (erudite), the rest of the new wiz are all from DE.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hehe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist<br/>\nSponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Are you?
