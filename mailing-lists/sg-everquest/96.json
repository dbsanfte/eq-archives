I played paper<br/>\n AD&D since 1983, b4 Apple computer is even commonly available.  I played<br/>\n all the major RPG series like Might & Magic, Wizardry and Ultima series,<br/>\nall from volume one (some played with my Apple computer).  Actually I would<br/>\nconsider enchanter not someone powerful, but it&#39;s my dream to enchant<br/>\n items, esp weapons.  I know from a lvl 11 enchanter than EQ enchanter can<br/>\n only enchant jewelry and silver bar, but that is better than none.<br/>\nHopefully they can patch this class later and allow us to enchant weapons,<br/>\n hehe.  It&#39;s a dream but just imagine, the RP element behind an enchanter,<br/>\n hehe.  Actually my UO friends ask me to start as a human monk or troll<br/>\n shadow knight coz they r powerful & easier to train, but I really dun wanna<br/>\n see duplication of my chars everywhere ;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I remember you now! The Dark Wardens right?<br/>\n<br/>\n Heh, actually other magery class r much better than enchanters when they<br/>\n reach high lvl.  I think enchanter as not as powerful as their magic<br/>\ncounterparts but I dun care.  I might not even last to reach lvl 20 (due to<br/>\n motion sickness), so meanwhile just RP someone I like ;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Nice! I&#39;ve been thinking of stopping my Monk and play a Shaman. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
