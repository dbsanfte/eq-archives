Helping my RL friend to tat extend is personal<br/>\n&gt; decision, he been my games kakis since paper AD&D, hmm, tat&#39;s 16 yrs ago<br/>\n&gt; (know him since kid time, neighbour, classmates, collegue, kakis, hehe)?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, when there is serious SOS msg, I will be helping also. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; p/s: Same thing applies for me ;)  But generally speaking, if others not<br/>\n&gt; helpful, and when they seek SOS and I&#39;m free, I still dun mind helping.<br/>\n&gt;  Just not to the extend tat I (or whole guild) must stop wat they are doing<br/>\n&gt; and rush to the player.  With guildsay, it&#39;s not very difficult to see who<br/>\n&gt; is nearest and available to help ;)  The purpose of forming our own kakis<br/>\n&gt; is to help as and when we can.  Unlike QHD so many faces I never seen b4,<br/>\n&gt; if I can help, I help, if I&#39;m not free, I won&#39;t bother also.  But for own<br/>\n&gt; kakis guild, I presume is small group of pple we know in RL or EQ, and have<br/>\n&gt; trust with one another. Under this kinda situation, I&#39;m more willing to<br/>\n&gt; extend my help.  If really no one online when a kakis SOS msg is send out,<br/>\n&gt; I die die camp for 10 hrs liao will also rush to help.  That&#39;s all I have<br/>\n&gt; to say - all depending on situation ;)  One good thing abt this lengthy<br/>\n&gt; discussion is tat, by now I think all kakis know when to send a SOS msg<br/>\n&gt; liao instead of abusing it ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Thursday, 19 August, 1999 8:35 AM, Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy<br/>\n&gt; [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Cheng Shan Chieh, Freddy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sccheng@...\">sccheng@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; well... then i suggest u guys state the guild guidelines properly... then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; see how... becos i want a guild that whenever i need help (and i<br/>\n&gt; seriously<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mean it) i wanna get some serious help... like i said... its not gonna be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; abused... that kid thing is a fucked up story... but if serious help is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; required ... someone must be there to help... that my minimum<br/>\n&gt; &gt; requirement.... if u just wanna have a guild for exploring then whats the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; point? can always form group and explore what....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; no body ask u to help your RL friend to that extend what... its you who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wanna do that... i never say we MUST do that to all guild members... all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shoud learn how to survive... as a guild... we should also do stuff<br/>\n&gt; like...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; GIVE HIM A FISH, FEED HIM A DAY<br/>\n&gt; &gt; TEACH HIM TO FISH, FEED HIM FOR LIFE.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if u get what im trying to say... enough said...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nicademous<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The &#39;supposed&#39; to be evil Necromancer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; p/s: i never ever forget how i was saved by Garren when i needed help and<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he ever needs  any (which is unlikely now, hehe), i&#39;ll do all i can to<br/>\n&gt; help<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him out.... its just the same, if i needed help and no one fuck care bout<br/>\n&gt; &gt; helping me... then when im much higher level, u think i still wanna help<br/>\n&gt; out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thesame folks? guess not...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist members, don&#39;t miss out on the latest news at ONElist!<br/>\n&gt; Join our community member news update<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce</a> &quot;here&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Singapore Everquest Players List<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\n<br/>\nGary Qui Hong Loong<br/>\nTechnical Support Executive<br/>\nPacific Internet Technical Support Department .<br/>\nPacific Internet Limited.<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nPacific Surf : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pacific.net.sg\">http://www.pacific.net.sg</a><br/>\nTechnical Support Helpline : 1800-8723330<br/>\nCustomer Support Helpline : 1800-8725055<br/>\n89 Science Park Drive<br/>\n#04-09/12 The Rutherford <br/>\nSingapore 118261</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
