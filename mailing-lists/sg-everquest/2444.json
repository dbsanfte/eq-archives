Average PL is 30%, and got freeze many times,<br/>\n&gt; from 5sec to 2 min (that&#39;s when I was killed in najena, by bonecracker).<br/>\n&gt;  With this kinda connection, better dun hunt and do some maintenance<br/>\n&gt; instead, like selling stuffs, casting spells in town to rise casting skills<br/>\n&gt; or do some inventory spring cleaning ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now I gotta think twice b4 getting cyberway $48 unlimited plan.  The<br/>\n&gt; surfing also sux as compared to $ingnet.
