I say<br/>\n&gt; Good job.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For those of you out there that are thinking that Necro&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; are too powerful? Our spells take a full second more (At<br/>\n&gt; LEAST) to cast than all the other classes....that is one<br/>\n&gt; aspect that has not been explored.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Our pets are not as strong as a Magicians either.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When fighting a magician sends in the pet...and blasts away<br/>\n&gt; from behind.<br/>\n&gt; We Necro&#39;s must go in and take some hits....then use our<br/>\n&gt; drains to heal while the pet get demolished.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hate it when one player says...&quot;My class is too<br/>\n&gt; weak....look at that class....they are too strong.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you think so...play that class...make a educated<br/>\n&gt; decision.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I personally think that all the classes I have played have<br/>\n&gt; been VERY WELL balanced.<br/>\n&gt; The Enchanter has had a rough start and is still strugling,<br/>\n&gt; but that is a fault of Verant not having completed thier<br/>\n&gt; skills. (Ahem....you weren&#39;t the only ones...Rogue&#39;s too<br/>\n&gt; were givin the short end of the stick.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I personally LOVE an enchanter in my group...if you have<br/>\n&gt; ever grouped with one you know the joys of having your<br/>\n&gt; monster turned into a much weaker...much smaller...much<br/>\n&gt; slower version of itself.  Enchanters are NOT cannon<br/>\n&gt; mages...and they are not supposed to be.  They can Debuff<br/>\n&gt; and buff better than anyone.  So what if others get those<br/>\n&gt; spells at higher levels....If you group...they will gladly<br/>\n&gt; leave you your specialty so that they can cast MORE<br/>\n&gt; drains...and less of the others.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Enchanters CAN solo also...albiet not very well.<br/>\n&gt; They have thier pets now.<br/>\n&gt; Verant is working on them.<br/>\n&gt; Give them time.<br/>\n&gt; The Enchanter you make fun of now will come back to kick<br/>\n&gt; your arse in later levels.<br/>\n&gt; (Personal Experience)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry for this rant but it had to be said.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; See homepage for details.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This list is intended for the trade of Spell components for spell<br/>\nresearch.
