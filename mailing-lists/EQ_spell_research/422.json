Taking that away would not be a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also agree that the ability to research other classes spells would be most<br/>\nwelcome. Quite honestly I originally thought that was exactly how the skill<br/>\nworked. In essence, I saw it as another trade skill that would be unique to<br/>\nthe spell casting classes. Unfortunately that isn&#39;t really the case. It is a<br/>\ntrade skill only in the weakest sense. Unlike the Dwarven blacksmith who can<br/>\nfashion wears for Ogre and Wood Elf alike, we are bound to limit our<br/>\nknowledge to a specific realm; that of our specific class. Tis most<br/>\nunfortunate.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrev<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Xar &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rneelin@...\">rneelin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, May 24, 1999 7:29 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_spell_research] Cross Research<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Not a good idea at all in my opinion I have played in the past games that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>allowed cross<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;training and such between classes makes for a bad environment -<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;However allowing cross class research methinks is not a bad idea as I could<br/>\n </span></blockquote>research<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;spells for all those words and such I find and sell them to the class that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>can use it.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Xzar<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
