Be warned.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Kinda like the leftover Bardic instrument-making materials you see all over<br/>\n&gt;(pieces of bamboo, unfinished brass trumpets, etc.) it&#39;s a leftover from a<br/>\n&gt;bygone era.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I thought the pieces of bamboo were there for Gnomes to tinker into fishing<br/>\npoles?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a Bard who set out to learn every language in the game since day<br/>\none.   Now that I know he&#39;ll never be able to put them to any practical<br/>\nuse, I&#39;m probably still going with it as a role-playing thing.   If you<br/>\never bump into Satyric on Bristlebane, feel free to teach him a language.<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;ll be able to use it in a quest or something someday.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother nifty possible use for languages:  improving your faction with<br/>\nsomeone.   Going up to a merchant of another race and addressing them<br/>\nfluently in their own tongue should be worth something, shouldn&#39;t it?   Not<br/>\nthat it is yet, but it&#39;d be a fun suggestion for the non-magic races to get<br/>\nsome small use out of languages.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast thought:  I wonder if it&#39;s possible to teach languages over a Guild<br/>\nchannel?<br/>\n<br/>\nSatyric</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
