A regular day and time also helps if this event<br/>\nis to become an on-going, well-attended thing, just like a real-life weekly<br/>\nstreet market. If this gets off the ground, I think it would really help<br/>\nopen up the market both for spell components and for ready-made researched<br/>\nspells.<br/>\n<br/>\nDatalore<br/>\n<br/>\n===================================<br/>\nResearch Gathering <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to invite you all to a fair of sorts on the E&#39;ci server. It will<br/>\nbe held in the courtyard outside the Mage-type guilds in Freeport. The<br/>\nevent will begin at around Noon cst this Sunday, and will last until<br/>\neveryone leaves. At around 12:15 groups will form for those that want to<br/>\nraise their skill in the many languages of Norrath. I also hope to have<br/>\nsome vendors there selling items that a mage would be interested in.<br/>\nHopefully some of the vendors will be selling research components. Anyway,<br/>\nthis is going to be a very relaxed event: just a bunch of magic users<br/>\nsharing their knowledge of different languages, buying hard to get items,<br/>\ntrading stories of their adventures across Norrath. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope to see you all there, <br/>\nAlkrum the Atomic</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
