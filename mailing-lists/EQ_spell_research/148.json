Was playing a 3rd level wiz<br/>\nand accidently bought a magician spell. When i tried to scribe it I got the<br/>\nmessage &#39;This spell does not come available to you until level 32&#39; (or<br/>\nsomething close to that).<br/>\n<br/>\nI rechecked the spell stats and it was strictly Magician type. Recently i<br/>\ntried the same thing (Playing an Enchanter) and bought a 1st level wiz<br/>\nspell, but i did not recieve anything other than &#39;This spell cannot be used<br/>\nby your class&#39; .. so perhaps what i saw in beta has been ommited now. I<br/>\nthink the only way that different classes can use one another&#39;s spells is<br/>\nONLY if the same spell is available to different classes (Like Gate or<br/>\nInvisibility)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
