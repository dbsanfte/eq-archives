I have<br/>\npretty much decoded my 1st and 2nd book, but I haven&#39;t tried doing research<br/>\n(most of the stuff in my 1st and book I have already).  I have some<br/>\nquestions, so here is a small message I posted to my guildpage earlier<br/>\ntoday.  There is a really slight spoiler below for one of the magicians<br/>\nspells which I use as an example for a question I have :<br/>\n*<br/>\n*<br/>\n*<br/>\n*<br/>\n*<br/>\n*<br/>\n*<br/>\n*<br/>\n*<br/>\n*<br/>\n*<br/>\n*<br/>\n-----------<br/>\nOk....I keep asking around and I keep getting 15 different answers.  A GM<br/>\ntold me you don&#39;t need a blank parchment and quill in the container when<br/>\nyou combine.  Now do you need this in your inventory instead?  Someone I<br/>\nasked told me you need the parchment and quill in your inventory to make<br/>\nthe spell but I don&#39;t know who is right.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, what is really confusing is the fact that the magicians spells list<br/>\nother spells as part of their ingredient.  Perhaps you guys can tell me if<br/>\nyour books do this took.  See example :<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n     *********************<br/>\n     Summon Elemental Mist:<br/>\n     Lesser Summoning Air<br/>\n     Words of Duress<br/>\n     The Scent of Marr<br/>\n     *********************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt lists &quot;Lesser Summoning Air&quot; as one of the ingredients.  Some players<br/>\nhave posted to a list that I subscribed to a while back, saying you need to<br/>\ncombine the spell it lists as one of the ingredients.  However I asked a<br/>\nfew people that told me you just need to have the<br/>\nspell WRITTEN in your spellbook in order to create the next level version<br/>\nof it.  Is this true?  And is this the same with the necro/wiz/enchanter<br/>\nspells?<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFinally, if anyone wants another spoiler for the 3rd magicians book, you<br/>\ncan go to the URL here (hopefully it will still be up) :<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqvault.com/boards/mshop/messages/27001.shtml\">http://www.eqvault.com/boards/mshop/messages/27001.shtml</a><br/>\n<br/>\nZolthar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
