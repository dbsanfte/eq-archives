In other words, how would two average speakers of Old Erudian<br/>\n&gt; work their language skill up? Someone told me that we should group, spam<br/>\n&gt; each other, get two improves, then zone. Then repeat until you faint. Is<br/>\n&gt; this correct?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
