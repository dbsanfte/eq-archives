The thing/fact<br/>\nbout trading is that people rather destroy or sell to merchants than auction<br/>\nem of for 1pp.<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Martin Matthiesen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:matthiesenm@...\">matthiesenm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, July 20, 1999 7:31 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_spell_research] Looking for spellcomponents<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Martin Matthiesen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:matthiesenm@...\">matthiesenm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I play a level 29 Magician named Eldran on Cazic Thule. In order to do my<br/>\n&gt;research I was looking for components.  The problem I encountered was that<br/>\n&gt;the components needed are very rare which I think put Magicians at a<br/>\n&gt;disadvantage when it comes to research. In all my travels I have not come<br/>\n&gt;across a single spell component besides words. I think they should either<br/>\n&gt;increase the spawn rate for these items or, which would be even better, put<br/>\n&gt;a vendor, maybe a bit out of the way, into the game that sells these<br/>\n&gt;components. Another suggestion I believe that should be considered is to<br/>\n&gt;make the necro and mage words look different. I plan on starting a petition<br/>\n&gt;towards this end and would apprerciate any hints or suggestions towards<br/>\n&gt;this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;PS: If anybody can give me a hint where to find these components or has<br/>\n </span></blockquote>some<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;to sell that would also be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Eldran<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Get $20 off all MotherNature brand products!<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/mothernature1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/mothernature1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;This list is intended for the trade of Spell components for spell research.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please keep the emails on topic.
