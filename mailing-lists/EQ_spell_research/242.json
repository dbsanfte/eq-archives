Been finding and trading for the Pages of<br/>\nGrimiore.  I have my Old Eradin up to Average. and i have the book of<br/>\nAncient Restoration. I took 2 parts of page 26, a right side torn page, and<br/>\na left side torn page, both where page 26... I put them into the Restoration<br/>\nBook, hit combine and get a message something like &#39;These items do not<br/>\ncombine to make anything&#39; (or somesuch message) .. this leads me to believe<br/>\ni have done something wrong or i would have gotten a &#39;your skill is not good<br/>\nenough&#39; type of message.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of mine has had the same problem, and states that he has tried<br/>\ndifferent combinations of pages like both the same side of same page number,<br/>\netc ..<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone help me out by telling me the propper procedure? Thus far I have<br/>\nfound nothing in the game at all that would reveal how to use the Book of<br/>\nAncient Restoration, or how to combine the pages into full sheets. I am<br/>\nunder the impression that once the pages are combined and if the attempt<br/>\nsucceeds your skill I&#39;ll end  up with a spell scroll. Perhaps I&#39;m wrong in<br/>\nmy assumption? Any help would be appreciated.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
