I only counted about 25 or so spells in them.  All of them are in Old Erudian.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI know there has to be more, I have a rune right now that doesn&#39;t seem to go with any of the spells lists I&#39;ve been given.  Plus according to the book, On Languages, there are books writen in Combine, Dragon and Elder Dragon.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnyone know where to find these?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThanks,\r<br/>\nFastus\r<br/>\nLevel 21 Wizard\r<br/>\nThe Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
