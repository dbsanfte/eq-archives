That being<br/>\n&gt;the case, If we specialize in a certain area such as conjuration, will we<br/>\n&gt;get new spells such as summon food and water, etc.  If they decide to let<br/>\n </span></blockquote>us<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;have hybrid spells from other races, it seems to me like they should limit<br/>\n&gt;the spells the wizard gets depending on which area of specialization he is<br/>\n&gt;in.  If I wated to get SoW for example, I would have to train in the<br/>\n&gt;specialization spell trait that is used when SoW is cast (alteration,<br/>\n&gt;divination, etc.). This would allow us to get hybrid spells without making<br/>\n&gt;us too powerful, and allow the wizard player to be able to be a more well<br/>\n&gt;rounded profession rather than being so dependant on others to buff and<br/>\n&gt;group with.  I don&#39;t know about you, but there are times when I am playing<br/>\n&gt;and no one is online who wants to group with me.  This can be frustrating<br/>\n&gt;cause we are not good at melee.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just my two cents worth.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
