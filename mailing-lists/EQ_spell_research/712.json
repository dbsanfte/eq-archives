I was hoping someone<br/>\nwas able to help me. I&#39;ve researched real spells with no problem, so i&#39;m<br/>\nwondering why this is much harder. And I refuse to believe that it is<br/>\nbugged!<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically I add Bat Wings, Bone Chips, and Lapis Laluli (sp?) to the<br/>\nConcordance of Research and hit combine. It says these items do not combine.<br/>\nI have tried it with the quill and paper in my inventory (not that I needed<br/>\nthem with REAL research).<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there is a secret to this, I just don&#39;t know what it is. I&#39;d be much<br/>\nappreciative if someone was able to share it with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nTremor of Bristlebain</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
