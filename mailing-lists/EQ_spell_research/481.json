It&#39;s supposed to be researchable?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I asked about this spell earlier and as far as i can tell it has been<br/>\nremoved from the game, unless it HAS been moved into the research bin. If it<br/>\nhas I havent come across the page number yet, tho i&#39;ve still got some pages<br/>\nthat i cant research until i get the other half.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if your interested in an item that i believe was created from this<br/>\nspell, it is the egg shaped pumice sold by the herbalists in all major<br/>\ncities. When you look at it&#39;s stats it says Pillage and the effects of it<br/>\nare to remove all enchantments, buffs, and debuffs from someone. The item<br/>\ncosts 15 plat but can come in very handy. I purchased one and used it in<br/>\nHighpass with a group fighting the gnolls there. They tended to cast root on<br/>\nya then swarm over you. The Pillage stone would imediatly remove the root so<br/>\nyou could run. I saved the life of several party members with it. Although<br/>\ni&#39;ve never tried it, it&#39;s possible it might remove a charm effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has 5 charges on it, and rumor has it that after it is used up it will<br/>\nrecharge on it&#39;s own after 1 week of game time, however i never found that<br/>\nto be true. I didnt wait long enough i dont think to find out.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
