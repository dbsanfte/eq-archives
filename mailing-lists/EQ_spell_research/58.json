It is said that to read the<br/>\n&gt; text of these ancient spell casters you must learn Old Erudian for the<br/>\n&gt; forefathers of Erudians and Elder Tier Dal for the forefathers of<br/>\n&gt; todays Dark Elves.  I know that Tier Dal shows up as Dark Elvish when<br/>\n&gt; changing languages, I also learned in my travels that Elder Tier Dal<br/>\n&gt; shows up a Lizardman.  Using my higher inteligence I have concluded<br/>\n&gt; that Necromancers would probably find it very usefull to learn Elder<br/>\n&gt; Tier Dal as I would find it usefull to learn Old Erudian.  Now if<br/>\n&gt; anyone knows how I can learn Elder Dragon, the harsh complex language<br/>\n&gt; of magic itself please let me know.

I have hear that<br/>\nyou need be higher skill than the one you teach to raise skill levels in<br/>\nlanguage and it seems to at least improve the speed of learning the<br/>\nhigher skill the teacher has.
