I wouldn&#39;t see the point of<br/>\n&gt; building another mage type except &gt;Wizard if this were true.  That would<br/>\n&gt; kind of throw the balance of character classes off a bit.  Wizard&#39;s &gt;would<br/>\n&gt; be everywhere!  I could be wrong.....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Valacian - 22nd Level Erudite Wizard, Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Possibly a rumor, ... some basis on the rumor was my experience in Beta,<br/>\n&gt; however this does not seem to be the case now. Was playing a 3rd level wiz<br/>\n&gt; and accidently bought a magician spell. When i tried to scribe it I got<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; message &#39;This spell does not come available to you until level 32&#39; (or<br/>\n&gt; something close to that).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I rechecked the spell stats and it was strictly Magician type. Recently i<br/>\n&gt; tried the same thing (Playing an Enchanter) and bought a 1st level wiz<br/>\n&gt; spell, but i did not recieve anything other than &#39;This spell cannot be<br/>\nused<br/>\n&gt; by your class&#39; .. so perhaps what i saw in beta has been ommited now. I<br/>\n&gt; think the only way that different classes can use one another&#39;s spells is<br/>\n&gt; ONLY if the same spell is available to different classes (Like Gate or<br/>\n&gt; Invisibility)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know ONElist has over 300 Star Wars lists?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join one today!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This list is intended for the trade of Spell components for spell<br/>\nresearch.
