I think all caster should be penalized for resist exactly the same way. Why is it necros get a spell that can&#39;t be resisted? Just think its total BS.<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Fondain De&#39;Illusion &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Fondain@...\">Fondain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: Eq Spell Research &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Tuesday, May 18, 1999 7:04 PM<br/>\n    Subject: [EQ_spell_research] Lil bit from an Enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Just a lil point,<br/>\n        I have watched a group of lvl 16 necros kill sand giants.... Ok, thats fine, but here is what irks me. I realize that as an enchanter I am not expected to do the offense like wizards, magicians or even necros, Our prime directive is debuffing and buffing and we get some incredible spells. Here are my rants.<br/>\n            1. we don&#39;t get enought buff or debuff that only WE have. Why do other classes get beserker str? Thats unbeknownst to me.<br/>\n            2. Ok, i can understand perhaps them resisting our offensive dmg spells but how are we supposed to be a group debuffer if they resist all our spells? Even after using tashan or tashanii which also have a tendency to get resisted? Kinda makes us useless in that regard eh?<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Just a few things im kinda irked about...<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n    Fondain De&#39;Illusion, Master Enchanter of the Amber Knights, Tarew Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
