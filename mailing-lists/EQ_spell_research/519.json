We all new when we started a Wizard that we had the most powerful<br/>\noffensive spells in the game. We gave up the other benefits to gain that<br/>\none. I don&#39;t want some other class being able to learn my big damage spells<br/>\nany more than i think we should learn theirs. Keep in mind this would have<br/>\nto work both ways and if ye have an enchanter or Necro that can damage as<br/>\nmuch as a Wizard why have a Wizard at all??  You have to take the weakness<br/>\nwith the Strength. start another char to play when no one else is online on<br/>\nthat can solo easier.  I started a Monk and a troll Shaman to play when no<br/>\none is around to group with and have a blast with those guys. Lets keep<br/>\nclasses unique thats what makes it fun playing different classes is that you<br/>\nhave to play each one different.<br/>\n<br/>\njust my thoughts...<br/>\nQuindinar<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Justin K.

That<br/>\nbeing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the case, If we specialize in a certain area such as conjuration, will<br/>\nwe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get new spells such as summon food and water, etc.  If they decide to<br/>\nlet us<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have hybrid spells from other races, it seems to me like they should<br/>\nlimit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the spells the wizard gets depending on which area of specialization he<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in.  If I wated to get SoW for example, I would have to train in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; specialization spell trait that is used when SoW is cast (alteration,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; divination, etc.). This would allow us to get hybrid spells without<br/>\nmaking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us too powerful, and allow the wizard player to be able to be a more<br/>\nwell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rounded profession rather than being so dependant on others to buff and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group with.  I don&#39;t know about you, but there are times when I am<br/>\nplaying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and no one is online who wants to group with me.  This can be<br/>\nfrustrating<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cause we are not good at melee.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just my two cents worth.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
