Many of the posts so far have been flames or just plain wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy99 is a trojan horse program that appears to be a small fireworks<br/>\ndisplay when run.  If you don&#39;t download, save, and execute this program,<br/>\nthen your computer won&#39;t become infected.  Once infected, any time you send<br/>\nan email message, Happy99 creates a second email with itself as an<br/>\nattachement. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease don&#39;t flame the person who sent this, nor complain to his ISP.  In<br/>\nall likelyhood, he had no knowledge he was even sending this virus.  The<br/>\nvirus sends itself.  Just notify him he has a virus.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information on how to detect and remove this virus, see<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.e-marketing2000.com/happy99_virus_information.html\">http://www.e-marketing2000.com/happy99_virus_information.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know who hosts the above site, but the instruction are very straight<br/>\nforward.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharles Lembke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:c-lembke@...\">c-lembke@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
