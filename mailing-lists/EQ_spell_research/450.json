Kobold and elder Tier D al are the same. It s the same for Dark Elven and Tier D al.  They show up as two different names","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1121209743\">On the Subject of languages.   Kobold and elder Tier D&#39;al are the same.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s the same for Dark Elven and Tier D&#39;al.  They show up as two different <br/>\nnames depending on whether you are looking at the chat window or the skills <br/>\nlisting.  It also seems I am able to learn the basics of a new language each <br/>\nlevel I advance.  I have recently gotten Lizardman and Goblin from my <br/>\ntrainer.   My languages so far are :<br/>\n<br/>\nCommon, Elder Elvish, Elvish, Dwarven, Dark Elven/Tier D&#39;al, Erudin, Old <br/>\nErudin, Gnoll, Barbarian, Gnomish, Halfling, Dark Speech, Kobold/Elder Tier <br/>\nD&#39;al, Ogre, Troll, Goblin, and Lizard Man.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still looking for a high level monk to teach me the basics of Dragon.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of words.   I seem to find more words than anything else.  <br/>\nThis is good for me since I am a Necromancer.  I have found most of them on <br/>\nDW crocs and DW Caimans in Oasis.  I have also found words and Runes on <br/>\nLavacrawlers in Lavastorm.  There is no certain place where they are found, <br/>\nI think all upper level monsters drop them from time to time.  I have a <br/>\nDruid friend who has found words, runes, and grimoire pages on Griffawns and <br/>\nGriffennes in the Karanas.  I think I covered everything I wanted to.  If <br/>\nthere are any high level monks that know the basics of Dragon on <br/>\nBristlebain, or anyone else who knows it, give me a tell in-game if you do <br/>\nnot mind spamming me for a couple minutes to teach me the basice.  I will <br/>\ngladly trade knowledge of my languages with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDalthas<br/>\nDark Elf Necromancer<br/>\nCurrently lvl 17<br/>\nBristlebain<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
