That just means that people just miss seeing the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  first 8 messages. (Maybe you all have EVERY hit and miss<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  showing up on your message window and it is flying by.  I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  personally turn the others hits and misses off so that I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  don&#39;t get bothered by the messages.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have found it depends on the skill... and often depends if it is a brand<br/>\n&gt;new skill or not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;if I have a skill where &quot;you have learned the basics&quot; comes up...
