In the<br/>\npost GZ said the percentage would be upped by 300%. He detailed a few other<br/>\nthings about research and one of them being that research starts at Lev 16<br/>\nand hence only Lev 16+ monsters would drop components.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess there is a good chance this has changed, I must say I have killed<br/>\nthat little dwarf in Crushbone about 50 times and never got a component, but<br/>\nI don&#39;t doubt what you say, and your right he is Level 12-14.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nTremor of Bristlebain<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. This thread started as a whats a &#39;Summon Element Scroll&#39;. I have since<br/>\nfound out that quite a few people have found just this as a drop from MOB&#39;s.<br/>\nSome of them said where, and i&#39;ve sort of concluded that any MOB that drops<br/>\ncomponents could drop this scroll. I guess they are just damn rare!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
