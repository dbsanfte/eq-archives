The standard reply is &quot;Gee I don&#39;t know, i&#39;ll document it.  Good luck!&quot;    Therefore i can only assume that Verant has NO ONE actually verifying the text put into the game. I do NOT think it&#39;s a pet scroll since most of them are used only for other pets.   This was probbably a spell that was never put into the final, and since the Heatstone spell is able to be purchased, not many magicians have complained.  I&#39;d do a &quot;FEEDBACK&quot; to let them know.  I already have as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeraxes Glibilskym, Gnome Magician, Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJordan<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jordanis@...\">Jordanis@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy ICQ Number\t2878828</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
