I am only at level 7 right now,<br/>\nand I&#39;m about to play to 8.  So far, I&#39;ve put almost all of my points<br/>\ninto jewelmaking (that I could) and the rest into 2H crush, for when<br/>\nI get the runed totem staff.  I&#39;ve used fletching to supplement the<br/>\nincome that jewelmaking will take.  Once I hit 8 and get enchant silver,<br/>\nsince I can already make the first three items with silver without<br/>\nany failure (too easy for my skill class) methinks I can sell the <br/>\nmagic rings/bracers/necklace/etc for a few plat, then practice on the<br/>\nhigher level jewelery.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard that words can also be used with enchanters, does anyone<br/>\nhave information on this?  Plus, how are these items made?  From<br/>\nwhat I heard, the scraps/words/etc are placed into the main book that<br/>\nyour class gets, along with a quill and scroll (this is my guess),<br/>\ncombine, and if successful, a spell scroll like the ones bought in<br/>\nthe magic stores.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Aeronis, Karana, DEF NEC; Aari, Karana, ERU ENC (among others)<br/>\n<br/>\nDevlish wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Devlish&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dev@...\">dev@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As a novice you is about to hit research in one level, can someone tell me<br/>\n&gt; what form (runes, words, etc.) the components for Magicians are?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know that the Elemental Grimoir is our book for combining them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The same vendor who sells the grimoir in Neriak also sells some pages and<br/>\n&gt; books, which I assume are some of the initial &#39;recipes&#39; for the skill.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Devlish DE Magician </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
