My sons and I apologize to anyone who may have received<br/>\nthe happy99.exe worm from this account.  They were merely unwitting participants, having received it from someone<br/>\nelse.  Please check your C:WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM&#92; directory for a file named SKA.EXE or alternatively do a file search<br/>\nfor happy99.exe.  If these exist, then follow the directions below to get rid of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nRichard Kubin & Sons<br/>\n<br/>\nCristie:<br/>\n<br/>\nExcuse me.  I am not sure who you are, but you certainly do not possess many<br/>\nmanners, either Internet or otherwise.  This account belongs to me, but is used<br/>\nprimarily by my two sons, aged 12 and 14.  They are primarily using it for<br/>\nplaying games (Everquest mostly) as well as for game info and trading magic<br/>\ncards.  They had no idea that this computer was infected with the worm<br/>\nhappy99.exe.  After they read your first nasty email, they immediately told me-<br/>\nhaving scanned prior emails, I was able to deduce that one of them had received<br/>\nit on Mar.12 from some other unwitting soul and being a somewhat naive user, he<br/>\nhad opened it, thereby infecting this computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat any polite person would do upon receiving something like the happy99.exe<br/>\nworm in an email attachment would be to inform the sender of their infection.<br/>\nIt is obvious that you know very little about this type of problem (it is<br/>\ntechnically a worm, not a virus).  It took me about five minutes to find out<br/>\nabout this worm (doing a yahoo search) and another five minutes to get rid of<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the future, I would hope that you show a little more respect for your fellow<br/>\nusers and rather than making threats, help try to solve the problem.  Try to<br/>\nremember that some users are still somewhat young and naive when it comes to<br/>\ncomputer and internet use and we should try to help where we can.  I have made<br/>\nsure that my sons now understand more about internet security and the dangers<br/>\nof viruses etc.  A good rule of thumb is never to open any attachments unless<br/>\nyou are absolutely sure of the source.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following link provides information on what the happy99.exe worm is and how<br/>\nto get rid of it:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/happy99.worm.html\">http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/happy99.worm.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very straight forward and I include instructions here for your benefit:<br/>\n<br/>\nVirusName: Happy99.Worm<br/>\nAliases: Trojan.Happy99, I-Worm.Happy<br/>\nLikelihood: Common<br/>\nRegion Reported: World Wide<br/>\nCharacteristics:  Trojan Horse, Worm<br/>\nDescription:<br/>\n This is a worm program, NOT a virus. This program has reportedly been received<br/>\nthrough email<br/>\nspamming and USENET newsgroup posting. The file is usually named HAPPY99.EXE in<br/>\nthe email or article attachment. When being executed, the program also opens a<br/>\nwindow entitled &quot;Happy New Year 1999 !!&quot; showing a firework display to disguise<br/>\nits other actions. The program copies itself as SKA.EXE and extracts a DLL that<br/>\nit carries as SKA.DLL into WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM directory. It also modifies<br/>\nWSOCK32.DLL in WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM directory and copies the original WSOCK32.DLL<br/>\ninto WSOCK32.SKA. WSOCK32.DLL handles internet-connectivity in Windows 95 and<br/>\n98. The modification to WSOCK32.DLL allows the worm routine to be triggered<br/>\nwhen a connect or send activity is detected. When such online activity occurs,<br/>\nthe modified code loads the worm&#39;s SKA.DLL. This SKA.DLL creates a new email or<br/>\na new article with UUENCODED HAPPY99.EXE inserted into the email or article. It<br/>\nthen sends this email or posts this article. If WSOCK32.DLL is in use when the<br/>\nworm tries to modify it (i.e. a user is online), the worm adds a registry<br/>\nentry:<br/>\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&#92;Software&#92;Microsoft&#92;Windows&#92;CurrentVersion&#92;RunOnce=SKA.EXE<br/>\nThe registry entry loads the worm the next time Windows start.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemoving the worm manually:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.delete WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM&#92;SKA.EXE<br/>\n2.delete WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM&#92;SKA.DLL<br/>\n3. in WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM&#92; directory, rename WSOCK32.DLL to WSOCK32.BAK<br/>\n4. in WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM&#92; directory, rename WSOCK32.SKA to WSOCK32.DLL<br/>\n5.delete the downloaded file, usually named HAPPY99.EXE<br/>\n<br/>\nWindows prevents you to do step #3 and #4 above if the machine is still<br/>\nconnected to the Internet. The file &quot;windows&#92;system&#92;wsock32.dll&quot; is used<br/>\nwhenever the machine is connected to Internet (i.e. through dial-up or LAN<br/>\nconnection).<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nRichard Kubin<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCristie wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Cristie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cristie@...\">cristie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Who the HELL do you think you are sending virus executables out to people<br/>\n&gt; on a mailing list.
