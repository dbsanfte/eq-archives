You must be grouped with whom you are learning.<br/>\n&gt; 2. He/She must have greater skill than you.<br/>\n&gt; 3. You must talk in /gsay for it to increase your<br/>\n&gt; level.(Never raised my skill with /say /tell or /shout).<br/>\n&gt; 4. As for skills being allowed even after not meeting the<br/>\n&gt; creature. I think that certain ones can be learned just<br/>\n&gt; because of your level.  After I level up I am sure to visit<br/>\n&gt; my guildmaster and he has one or two languages for me to<br/>\n&gt; learn.  Otherwise I would know Sphinx, and Gryphon, and Hill<br/>\n&gt; giant allready...hehe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Star Wars fans are using ONElist to share the fun.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This list is intended for the trade of Spell components for spell research.
