You can understand it<br/>\nand speak it well.  Its just a stupid bug where the skill does not change<br/>\nits level indicator which is listed in your skills table.  So you have<br/>\nexcellent, but awful still shows.  Just need to zone...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow if I can only get to excellent....hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nZolthar<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 07:33 PM 5/10/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Rob Funk&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rfunk@...\">rfunk@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To get language increases I have had to log out then log back on.

Don&#39;t ask me why....it just<br/>\n&gt;&gt; happens that way for us all the time.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; \tBut it is true that in order to see how much you have risen<br/>\n&gt;&gt; in a language<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you need to zone for the skill list to change.  For example if you are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Awful in Troll and you get a Troll to spam you for 20 mins.  Your Troll<br/>\n&gt;&gt; skill will be listed as awful till you zone.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Zolthar </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
