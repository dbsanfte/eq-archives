Is the Doctrine of Wizardry written in Elder Elvish or<br/>\nTier&#39;Dal?   I&#39;ve heard there are four books yet you list 5 languages that<br/>\nyou know or are working on.  Are there more than four books?  I really wish<br/>\nyou were on my server. I&#39;d happily pay 5 plat to learn those languages.<br/>\nAlso, do wizards need ONLY runes?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone on the Karana server teach me other languages?  I&#39;ll pay/trade<br/>\nfor them... (I already know Old Erudian to excellent.  I also have several<br/>\nnon-rune reseach components I would gladly trade providing I dont need them<br/>\nmyself.)<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Ken Morris [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kmorris2@...\">kmorris2@...</a>]<br/>\n    Sent: Tuesday, May 11, 1999 12:31 PM<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a><br/>\n    Subject: [EQ_spell_research] Languages<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I am excellent in Dragon, Combine, Old Eurdian, Elder Elvish, and am<br/>\nworking on Elder Tier&#39;Dal today.  I will be happy to teach Dragon and<br/>\nCombine for 6 runes each.  The rest, I will teach for 3 runes or 5 plat<br/>\neach.  I am located on the Tarew Marr server.  I am firm on the Dragon and<br/>\nCombine btw.  I won&#39;t accept money but only runes for those languages.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Talarin Kal&#39;Amon, High Elven Wizard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
