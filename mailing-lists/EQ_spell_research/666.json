In order to do my<br/>\nresearch I was looking for components.  The problem I encountered was that<br/>\nthe components needed are very rare which I think put Magicians at a<br/>\ndisadvantage when it comes to research. In all my travels I have not come<br/>\nacross a single spell component besides words. I think they should either<br/>\nincrease the spawn rate for these items or, which would be even better, put<br/>\na vendor, maybe a bit out of the way, into the game that sells these<br/>\ncomponents. Another suggestion I believe that should be considered is to<br/>\nmake the necro and mage words look different. I plan on starting a petition<br/>\ntowards this end and would apprerciate any hints or suggestions towards<br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: If anybody can give me a hint where to find these components or has some<br/>\nto sell that would also be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nEldran</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
