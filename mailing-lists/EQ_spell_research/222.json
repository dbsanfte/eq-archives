I<br/>\nwas not attacking anything. But I think that Verant<br/>\nprogramming specific attacks on people&#39;s ability to learn is<br/>\nnot something they would do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were key words in my answer by the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI THINK.  I am not stating a fact as they may very well have<br/>\ndone just that, by programming skills not going up on<br/>\ncertain login&#39;s...even though I think that would hold no<br/>\nRolePlay value.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease people...don&#39;t take every answer as a personal<br/>\naffront.  Some of us here are not using English as thier<br/>\nprime language and their answer may be in the form they<br/>\nthink is not an attack.  I try to make my answers as<br/>\nnon-threatening as possible.  Maybe I am doing things wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if any of my answers have insulted any of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood day.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
