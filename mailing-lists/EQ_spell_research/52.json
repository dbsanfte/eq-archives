You do not need to train in a language to learn it, you can learn it by <br/>\nhearing somebody who is excellent in the language speak it. If you are ever <br/>\nriding the boat start up a language class and get all aboard who will <br/>\ncooperate to speak in their native tongues. After getting off my first boat <br/>\ntrip I could, barely, speak some Dwarf, and I am a Gnome and had never <br/>\ntrained in any langauge with my Guildmaster. Where we&#39;ll get to hear Dragon <br/>\nor Elder Dragon is beyond me, but I do know the Gypsies that sell Combine <br/>\nweapons are related to the historic Combine Empire, perhaps hanging out by <br/>\nGypsies and listening to them talk to people will give us Combine... just an <br/>\nidea for somebody to try out. From what I understand you can only learn a <br/>\nlanguage from hearing from somebody who is excellent in it, but I could be <br/>\nwrong about that, however I have not been able to get my two fellow <br/>\nEnchanters I travel with(my main character is a Gnome Enchanter)to learn any <br/>\nDwarf from speaking in it even though I learned it from hearing it spoken, <br/>\nalbeit from a native speaker who is excellent in Dwarf.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. As far as combining things in the books, do not put anything into the <br/>\nbooks other than what the recipe called for and do not use summoned <br/>\nwater/items in creating the spell or it won&#39;t work. Quills and Scrolls <br/>\napparently have no use that people can figure out, probably confusing <br/>\nremnants from the Beta just like the Age of Restoration book that was pulled <br/>\nafter the last patch due to it being useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck,<br/>\n<br/>\nqq<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
