That is what I am talking about, a limited crossover at very high<br/>\nlevels.  You would have to spend training points in the new area and be<br/>\nlimited to  a subset of spells, plus have to research them all.  I think it<br/>\nwould add an interesting element to the higher levels.  More of a hobby than<br/>\na real threat to the actual class whose spells you could learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Elidain<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:VorteksJRC@...\">VorteksJRC@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:VorteksJRC@...\">VorteksJRC@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, May 23, 1999 7:39 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_spell_research] Cross Research<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:VorteksJRC@...\">VorteksJRC@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tI think research and use of other classes spells is a good idea, as<br/>\n&gt; long as there is a penalty for doing so. It would be cool if you<br/>\n&gt; could learn<br/>\n&gt; others spells from half your level. I.E. a level 40 wizard could<br/>\n&gt; learn level<br/>\n&gt; 20 necro spells. Or if the spells were less effective. But &quot;jack of all<br/>\n&gt; trades&quot; mages would be very annoying. My strengths as a magician<br/>\n&gt; are the only<br/>\n&gt; advantage I have over the other mage classes. But still....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess what I&#39;m saying is cross research could be beneficial if<br/>\n&gt; implemented<br/>\n&gt; properly. But simply any-mage-can-learn-any-spell policies would be<br/>\n&gt; disasterous.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Vorteks the High Elf Magician<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
