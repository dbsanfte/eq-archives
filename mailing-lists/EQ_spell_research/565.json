It is verants way of heading letting us know<br/>\nthey dont like for the players to be able to easily see what creatures have<br/>\nloot. Players just watched the wisps and only attacked the ones that cast a<br/>\nlight source, thus being assured of loot, being either a greater or normal<br/>\nlightstone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe burned out stone is much like the summoned light source one of the<br/>\ncaster classes casts. It cant be traded, dropped, or sold. And it will<br/>\nvanish when you log. This keeps ALL wisp type creatures throwing a glowing<br/>\nlight around them so you are forced to hunt them all again and hope for<br/>\nluck.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
