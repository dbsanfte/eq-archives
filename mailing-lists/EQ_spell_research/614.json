If I ever see that magician again I will ask her about<br/>\nthe spell, but it seems like you do need a summon element scroll to make it.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jordan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jordanis@...\">jordanis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 21, 1999 7:29 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_spell_research] Digest Number 49<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Jordan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jordanis@...\">jordanis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: &quot;Ben Humphreys&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:benh@...\">benh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Summon Element Scroll<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The level 16 Magician Spell, Summon Heatstone requires a component called<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&#39;Summon Element Scroll&#39;, does anyone know what this is? I&#39;m thinking<br/>\nmaybe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it is any Summon Elemental (Pet) scroll.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Tremor of Bristlebain<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well Tremor, I&#39;ve ask that very same question to almost every magician on<br/>\nFennin Ro, including EVERY GM that i can get ahold of.  The standard reply<br/>\nis &quot;Gee I don&#39;t know, i&#39;ll document it.  Good luck!&quot;    Therefore i can only<br/>\nassume that Verant has NO ONE actually verifying the text put into the game.<br/>\nI do NOT think it&#39;s a pet scroll since most of them are used only for other<br/>\npets.   This was probbably a spell that was never put into the final, and<br/>\nsince the Heatstone spell is able to be purchased, not many magicians have<br/>\ncomplained.  I&#39;d do a &quot;FEEDBACK&quot; to let them know.  I already have as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Meraxes Glibilskym, Gnome Magician, Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jordan<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jordanis@...\">Jordanis@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My ICQ Number 2878828<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
