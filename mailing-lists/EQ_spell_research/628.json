Identify supposedly works to show lore for a particular item, it&#39;s just<br/>\nthat it has been said not very many items have lore to divulge.<br/>\n2.)  Sense Magic is pretty useless, and Verant has said they will be<br/>\nreplacing it with something in the future.  Anyone with the spell already in<br/>\ntheir spell books will automatically have it replaced with the new spell.<br/>\n3.)  Sense Summoned I have really never used so I&#39;ll take the word of those<br/>\nwho commented on using it.<br/>\n4.)  Flare I also have never used so I can&#39;t comment on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYlandril Feanaro &lt;Soulforge&gt;<br/>\nHigh Elf Wizard of the 7th Initiate<br/>\nMithaniel Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
