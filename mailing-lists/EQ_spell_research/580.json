Information pulled includes skill used (alteration, abjuration), targeting type (specific target, Area Effect), text shown, etc.  This would be considered a SPOILER to many people, so use it if you want.  Be advised that many spells that are listed are either not implemented or have been made unavailable, so just because it is LISTED does not mean that you can get it.  Examples are Winged Courier, Enchantment of Light, and Enchantment of Brilliance, all of which have been reportedly removed, but which are still listed in the data file.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnyway, here is the URL.
