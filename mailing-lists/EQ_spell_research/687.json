This one had &quot;Middle part of a rune&quot;.  This is also a lore<br/>\n&gt; item but is not listed as &quot;no drop&quot;, so the group gave this part to me<br/>\n&gt; also.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have also heard these pieces have been found in South Karanas.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now I am assuming there is also a &quot;Bottom part of a rune&quot;, but does<br/>\n&gt; anyone know what these are for?
