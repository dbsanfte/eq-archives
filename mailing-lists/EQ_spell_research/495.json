I have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1960691140\">This is a copy of the last week&#39;s worth of postings I have done to several <br/>\nsites on wizard research.  Wizards and others may find this info useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have researched a few spells, and wasted LOTS of runes trying to research <br/>\nothers. I have found many bugs along<br/>\nthe way, far too many to bug individually in the game, so I am posting them <br/>\non the web so other players can see,<br/>\nand I think Verant employees read most of the major sites too. First, I <br/>\nsuccessfully researched Project Lightning<br/>\nusing a rune of Periphery and a Rune of Fulgeration. Then I scribed it into <br/>\nmy spellbook. Then I used the same two<br/>\nrunes and tried again. &quot;These items do not combine in these quantities&quot; WTF? <br/>\nVery odd, since I did it once<br/>\nalready... So I tried again cause I thought I may have got the combo wrong <br/>\nfrom lack of sleep or something. Same<br/>\nmessage. I bugged it and waited till latest patch, then tried a third time. <br/>\nSame message... Oh well, at least I have<br/>\nthis nice useless spell in my book. I successfull did a few copies of Pillar <br/>\nof Fire, and about 3 copies of Identify,<br/>\nonly forgetting once that spells are LORE ITEMs and the new one disappears <br/>\nif you are still holding the first one...<br/>\nDoh!<br/>\nI tried to research Fire Spiral of Al&#39;Kabor with Nagafen and Al&#39;Kabor <br/>\nrunes... &quot;These items do not combine...&quot;<br/>\nWTF? Checked book, checked level... Yep, book says that, and I am level 20, <br/>\ntried again, runes gone again.<br/>\nTried many different combinations that gave me the &quot;these items...&quot; message, <br/>\nincluding:<br/>\n1. Periphery and<br/>\nProximity<br/>\n2. Periphery and Fulguration<br/>\n3. Al&#39;Kabor and Fulguration,<br/>\n4. Proximity and Fulguration.<br/>\nNone of these combined in usefull quantities... Ouch! my poor bank account <br/>\nis looking pretty bare...<br/>\nNext research bug... I am a Teir&#39;Dal and I started the game with Elder <br/>\nElvish at Average. There it has stayed. I am<br/>\nexcellent in every other language known to children of Order, and I know a <br/>\nsmattering of others. I have bugged this<br/>\nfour times so far, but still cannot read the second book properly. (Nimis <br/>\ntwiddles his thumbs)<br/>\nNext problem is with my research skill. How the hell does it go up? At level <br/>\n16 I trained 1 point, then message<br/>\nsays I have to train in field. Ok, all the runes I blew at level 16 didn&#39;t <br/>\nraise my skill a bloody point. At level 18, I went<br/>\nback to trainer, and trainer told me I could not put in any points, had to <br/>\nlearn in the field. What a jerk. At level 20 I<br/>\nplayed with more runes, and my skill went up almost 4 times in a row, to 20 <br/>\npoints. WAHOO!! Then I went back to<br/>\ntrainer, and she let me put in another 5 points as skill practice, before <br/>\ntelling me I need to go back to field. Anyone<br/>\nknow how this is supposed to work? Why the wierd combination? I can normally <br/>\nwork this stuff out on my own, but<br/>\nI dont see the pattern here.<br/>\nAnyone with solutions to my wiz research problems, please post. Thanks,<br/>\nNimis of The Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\nAdded a few days Later:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou start by putting one point into research at level 16, this gives you <br/>\nbase 16 skill. At level 20, my skill went up to<br/>\n25. I have read several other people that said they were able to gain a <br/>\npoint or two of skill at every level. There<br/>\nmust be something else I do not see...<br/>\nBesides, there are only a few more circles: 24, 29, 34, 39, 44, 49. Lets <br/>\nsee, that is 6. 255 minus current 25 is<br/>\n230. 230/6 is 38.33. Will I be able to raise my skill 38 points at level 24? <br/>\nUnlikely... What if the skill gain pattern is<br/>\ncumulative? Went up 10 points at 20, say 20 at 24, 30 at 29, 40 at 34, 50 at <br/>\n39, 60 at 44, and the last 55 at 49?<br/>\nThis sounds plausible... Any other high level wizards wat to add? Feel free <br/>\nto jump in at any time... Or the skill may<br/>\ncap at 100, and not go higher. Then if we did 10 at every circle we would be <br/>\nup to 85 by level 49. Hmm... also<br/>\nplausible, cap us there so that research still fails quite a bit... I could <br/>\nsee this happening, so no wizard becomes a<br/>\nmaster researcher and helps everyone on the server...<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s my thoughts on the subject today, anyone with knowledge feel <br/>\nfree to correct me. Please ;)<br/>\nNimis of The Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd even Later:<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, after two weeks of almost daily bug reports on the language cap, it <br/>\nhas been fixed, so I am now excellent in<br/>\nElder Elvish. Yehaa, woup de do... In other news, I reached level 21, and, <br/>\nwith my research skill at 25 received my first &quot;that<br/>\nitem is trivial for someone of your skill to make&quot; message when I tried to <br/>\ndo level 16 spells. Dammit!! I had<br/>\npurchased two backpacks full of the stupid runes too... Oh well, I guess now <br/>\nI only buy level 20+ runes... I raised<br/>\nmy skill in research by one point by doing a level 20 spell, then I went to <br/>\nmy master and bought another 4 points.<br/>\nSo far it seems as if I can buy 4 points at avery level, and these are on <br/>\ntop of any points I am able to get by raising<br/>\nskill in the field. I have been unable to find any enchanters that want to <br/>\ntrade runs for the backpack of pages I have,<br/>\nso I will be selling them soon if nobody wants them... most of my pages are <br/>\nthe tsarins level 16 and 20 spells, and<br/>\nI play on the Rathe... I want to trade for runes or sell them for 3pp each.<br/>\nMore news when i know more....<br/>\nNimis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
