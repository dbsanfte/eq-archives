After spending a ridiculoud amount of time and money searching<br/>\nfor the answer and experimenting with combinations that don&#39;t work, neither<br/>\nI nor any guild member have been able to figure out how to tailor a<br/>\nBackpack.  If I read into your message correctly, the tailored backpacks<br/>\nhave 10 slots instead of the standard 8?  That answers the long-asked<br/>\nquestion of why backpack patterns are more expensive than backpacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize this is a bit off-topic, but I have seen mention of handmade<br/>\nbackpacks NOWHERE else.  And no one else seems to have a clue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nchpicker</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
