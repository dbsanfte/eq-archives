Is it true that for Wizard spells only Runes are needed?  Or do the scraps of parchment offer any benefit?<br/>\n   <br/>\n      Also, on a side note,  what happened to specialization?  Cant seem to train in it at the Guild halls anymore.<br/>\n   <br/>\n      Thanks,<br/>\n      Arkaine Stormlord<br/>\n      Innoruuk Server </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
