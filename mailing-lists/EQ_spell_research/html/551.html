&gt; I have trained in specialization.  Being a wizard, I dumped most my<br/>
&gt; training<br/>
&gt; points into Evoke, though I put a point into all 5 to get the basics.  I<br/>
&gt; am<br/>
&gt; now 52 in Evoke and 24 or 25 in the other four skills.  I have also seen<br/>
&gt; Specialize: Evoke and Specialize: Abjure go up from use since training in<br/>
&gt; them.  As I recall, they were somewhere in the middle on the of the list<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; trainable skills.  I think it goes combat/usable skills, specialize<br/>
&gt; skills,<br/>
&gt; trade skills, language skills from top to bottom in the trainers list.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Well the patch update says that specialization is now in place, but I<br/>
&gt; still<br/>
&gt; &gt; cannot train in it at my guild.  I asked in game and several other<br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; &gt; also could not train in it.  Simply does not show up in the list.  Has<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone succesfully trained in this yet?<br/>
