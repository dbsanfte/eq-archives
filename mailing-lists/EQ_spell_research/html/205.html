&gt; Congratulations Robert!<br/>
&gt; As a budding Wizard, I am curious where you happened upon the runes necessary<br/>
&gt; to make Pillar of Fire? I&#39;ve been searching all over for them and as yet no<br/>
&gt; luck.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I found three on Scarecrows (but I killed a whole lotta scarecrows), two on<br/>
Snow Orc Shamans (sent a good number of those skywards too), and another (which<br/>
blows the intelligent creatures only theory) I bought from a Barbarian who had<br/>
just gotten it from a Wooly Mammouth his party had just killed. The couple<br/>
others I have I just bought by doing /auction Buying Runes alot. Most people<br/>
don&#39;t even know what they are and are glad to sell them. I&#39;ve been paying two<br/>
plat for them. So I think it is pretty random on higher lever critters.<br/>
