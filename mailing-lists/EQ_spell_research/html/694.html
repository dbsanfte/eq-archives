<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526761802">i am a warrior (recently gave my wiz a vacation) and i constantly auction<br/>
off words and runes and pages etc tec for usually 1-5 plat depending on how<br/>
rare ive seen em... most of the time i sell em for about 2 plat...<br/>
it just depends on how ard and where you look... mpostly these items will<br/>
com off of lev 16+ critters so keep killing them and if you fiond some that<br/>
give words and such keep killing them they should be on the same random<br/>
table as the runes...<br/>

Well, its actually not true.  I&#39;m a lvl28 Wiz on Bristel.  I have 2 trunk<br/>
full of words, LOTS of words, and destroyed countless words till date....all<br/>
I get are WORDS and occasional pages, but soooo rarely runes (which I need)!<br/>
I think either Verant is really trying to get people to trade for research<br/>
components or they got the &#39;spawn specifics&#39; screwed up.  The thing/fact<br/>
bout trading is that people rather destroy or sell to merchants than auction<br/>
em of for 1pp.<br/>

&gt;I play a level 29 Magician named Eldran on Cazic Thule. In order to do my<br/>
&gt;research I was looking for components.  The problem I encountered was that<br/>
&gt;the components needed are very rare which I think put Magicians at a<br/>
&gt;disadvantage when it comes to research. In all my travels I have not come<br/>
&gt;across a single spell component besides words. I think they should either<br/>
&gt;increase the spawn rate for these items or, which would be even better, put<br/>
&gt;a vendor, maybe a bit out of the way, into the game that sells these<br/>
&gt;components. Another suggestion I believe that should be considered is to<br/>
&gt;make the necro and mage words look different. I plan on starting a petition<br/>
&gt;towards this end and would apprerciate any hints or suggestions towards<br/>
&gt;this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;PS: If anybody can give me a hint where to find these components or has<br/>
 </span></blockquote>some<br/>
