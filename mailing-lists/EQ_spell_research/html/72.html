LVL 24 RESEARCH:<br/>
Here is the low down on what has been happening with me.  Also, thank<br/>
you<br/>
Vicki. :)<br/>
I found Gloves of Rallos Zek,<br/>
Flame of Vox ( qty 2 )<br/>
Words of Coersion ( qty 2 )<br/>
Words of Transendence (qty 2)<br/>
<br/>
1- My friend Arkaine (lvl 35 magician on fennin with me) successfully<br/>
made<br/>
a level 20 earth elemental.  So the methodology is there.  NO NEED FOR<br/>
PEN<br/>
AND PARCHMENT.  Just the three components listed in the book then<br/>
combine.<br/>
<br/>
2- Everfont is broke.  Level 20 water ele is broke.  Level 24 Earth ele<br/>
is<br/>
broke.  How do i know?  Well i no longer have Gloves of Rallos Zek and<br/>
now i<br/>
am down to 1 Words of Coersion.  Also I am down to 1 words of<br/>
transendence<br/>
becuase i tried to create level 24 earth ele and everfont only to get<br/>
the<br/>
message that these hard earned and extremely rare items do not go<br/>
together<br/>
to form jack squak.<br/>
<br/>
3- Arkaine was successful in creating level 20 earth, so the method on<br/>
how<br/>
to do it is real simple.  Put in the three components, click combine.<br/>
However it would not allow Arkaine to create level 20 water nor<br/>
everfont,<br/>
and it would not allow me to create everfont nor Level 24 earth.  I<br/>
talked<br/>
to the man who updates and maintains EQLizer which is at Gameznet.com<br/>
who is<br/>
in my guild and he talked to GZ less then a  week ago.  GZ told him that<br/>
all<br/>
research was implemented EXCEPT magician research.  I believe they<br/>
forgot to<br/>
implement ALL our research, just some of it.  If any of have luck, let<br/>
me<br/>
know.  Once again, YOU DO NOT NEED PEN AND PARCHMENT<br/>
<br/>
Peace Fellow Magi,<br/>

Most Of The Magicians Spells research Are broke ( Still mostly a beta<br/>
Character) Some work some don&#39;t .... As For the Rest I don&#39;t know  Never<br/>
bothered to research them on the Net or get information about them<br/>
anyone high enough level to research in the other classes never bothered<br/>
to post anything general that I have Found ..<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps..<br/>
