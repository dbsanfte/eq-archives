But as for the above...<br/>
<br/>
Your trainer should have some of the other languages now.  They appeared at <br/>
my trainer after I got research.  Train it up a few points (or a lot if you <br/>
saved points like I did) and then find a buddy.<br/>
<br/>
Spam your buddy in that language (you can put up to 5 lines of text in a <br/>
social) when s/he stops learning ... zone<br/>
<br/>
Then he spams you.  You will learn twice.  Zone...<br/>
<br/>
You spam him/her. S/he will learn twice.  zone...<br/>
<br/>
etc.  takes a while.  But it works :)<br/>
