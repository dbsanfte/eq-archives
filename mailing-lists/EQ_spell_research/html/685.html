&gt;  I nor any guild member have been able to figure out how to tailor a<br/>

&gt;  have 10 slots instead of the standard 8?  That answers the long-asked<br/>
&gt;  question of why backpack patterns are more expensive than backpacks.<br/>

High Quality Bearskin, Backpack patern, in a LARGE sewing kit.  You need a <br/>
skill of maybee 35 to do it with good success.  (I have someone with a 27 who <br/>
has made about 4 out of 10 pelts...)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck finding the HQ bearskins.  I have been looking for them for 3 weeks <br/>
with little luck.  Slaughtering no learning bears, young kodiaks and Kodiaks. <br/>
 got 1 in all that time.<br/>
