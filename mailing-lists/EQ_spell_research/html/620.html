&gt;the spell summon heatstone is in the game. I foget which server it was but I<br/>
&gt;saw a magician giving them away to anyone that wanted one in freeport on<br/>
&gt;saturday or sunday. If I ever see that magician again I will ask her about<br/>
&gt;the spell, but it seems like you do need a summon element scroll to make it.<br/>

	We know the spell is in the game, you can buy it at almost any vendor, however some of us would like to be able to increase our skills in research by RESEARCHING spells.  Just like smiths can practice on rusty weapons, etc... however this particular spell requires a component that NO ONE that i have talked to can find, namely a &quot;Summon Element Scroll&quot;    Because every spell for magicians requires 3 things, 1) A word, 2) an item, 3) a previous spell..  and this spell has 1) Words of the element 2) Bloodstone and 3) SUMMON ELEMENT SCROLL.  that #3 MUST be a spell... one that is NOT in the game. <br/>
	I personally think that few people have brought this to Verants attention since the spell is purchasable and MOST of the magicians i&#39;ve seen would rather buy their spells than go to the trouble of making them.<br/>

Also, anyone else notice that FLARE no longer works?  That makes what 4 spells that are completly usless to us??<br/>
	1) Identify<br/>
	2) Sense Magic<br/>
	3) Sense Summoned (practically usless in it&#39;s current form)<br/>
	4) Flare (since most recent patch)<br/>
<br/>
anyone find any other spells not working at all? or as intended?<br/>
