They are randomly found items.  You find them on magical, or magic using <br/>
creatures.  So you can&#39;t say &quot;go to Rathe, and kill Bob the evil mage&quot; You <br/>
have to say... &quot;Go to lavastorm, kill elementals.  I will trade items I can&#39;t <br/>
use for items you can&#39;t use&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So this mailing list was rally intended to be...<br/>

&quot;I have Rune of zapping, page 550000 of the grimoire.  I will trade for Word <br/>
of smiting, and word of suffering.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But it is nice to have the conversations about spell research it in general <br/>
also.<br/>
