&gt;Speaking of which...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was going to travel with some friends of higher level (L11 ranger, L15 monk, I&#39;m L8 enchanter) to <br/>
&gt;freeport in an effort to sell a few things (Silver Carnelian wedding rings anyone?) and try and get an <br/>
&gt;enchant silver spell.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was getting tired, and the monk and I were waiting around for the ranger to finish.  We decided to <br/>
&gt;spam eachother a few times with /g in an effort to learn languages.  It seems he had been practicing<br/>
&gt;a LOT.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I now have:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ogre<br/>
&gt;Halfling<br/>
&gt;Gnomish<br/>
&gt;Barbarian<br/>
&gt;Troll<br/>
&gt;Dark Speech (Elder Tier&#39;Dal?  That&#39;s what he said it is.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;in addition to the Erudin and Old Erudin that I already have.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I didn&#39;t have to zone, but I did logout/login to see the changes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Your language skills have increased.&quot;<br/>

&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; why do you have to zone when learning languages? i have never had to zone<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; when spamming and i learn just fine<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; It seems to help, and the information under &quot;skills&quot; doesn&#39;t update unless<br/>
&gt;&gt; you zone.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; We know that they still go up... I went from having nothing in halfing, to<br/>
&gt;&gt; almost excellent, and it wasn&#39;t in my skills list.  I zoned, and it<br/>
&gt;&gt; appeared.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; But, regardless... when two people that aren&#39;t &quot;excellent&quot; in a language are<br/>
&gt;&gt; trying to teach each other, it seems to help more (i.e. you seem to gain<br/>
&gt;&gt; more language levels more quickly) by zoning... as per what Sonoroud said.<br/>
