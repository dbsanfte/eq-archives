<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620722567">I have been saving my training points from the beginning.I have around 85 points to use. I can understand learning other languages from other races but what about Elder Ter&#39;Dal&lt;sp&gt;, Elder Giant, Orcish, Fairy, and quite a few other languages that aren&#39;t used buy one of the major races that you can talk to. I have heard the first Wizard book is in Old Erudian. If this is true I will put some of my points into it if no one knows how to learn it normally. As far as runes are concerned I believe most of them are random. I have got them off your average non-named NPCs. Some runes for some of the higher level spells need to be taken off a specific NPC from what variant has said about higher level spells.<br/>

Thanks<br/>
