<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098075572">Elidain, &quot;us&quot; refers to Wizards.  The class that has nothing.  Give me<br/>
an example of what we have over any class, and I will bash it into the<br/>
ground with another example that blows it away.  As to fizzles, etc...  We<br/>
are the slowest casters in the game.  I dueled a Necromancer that had the<br/>
same HP as I, and we agreed to do DD spells only, in which he did 160 damage<br/>
and I did 165.  The Necromancer won.  I have higher Magic resistance, but<br/>
his spells did full damage every time.  My spell did full damage once, and<br/>
it looked to be about 4 damage the second time.  Just so you know, we dueled<br/>
with NO BUFFS on.  The speed of his spell was too much, as he always was<br/>
ahead of my casts.  Anyways, I&#39;m out.  Someone try to tell me a reason<br/>
Wizards are better, and I will defend my statement that we suck.<br/>
