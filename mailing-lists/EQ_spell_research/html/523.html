<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682144051">Ok, not entirely on topic but does anyone know how you achieve<br/>
specialization once you hit 20th level?  I tried the trainer but nothing on<br/>
specialization even thought it was listed as a skill gained at 20th earlier<br/>
in the game.  Does it work?  Thanks.<br/>
