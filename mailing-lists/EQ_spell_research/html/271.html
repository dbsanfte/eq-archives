&gt; I am also going to write to a few folks on this matter.&gt; � There is always someone to mail to ... anyone else who received this should probably write to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:abuse@...">abuse@...</a>, I seriously doubt bellsouth is going to be happy about one of their users sending e-mail attachments containing viruses.� Its too damn bad.� I&#39;ve already mailed mine off to bellsouth.. who else will follow suit.� He will likely lose his internet account at least with this isp.<br/>
