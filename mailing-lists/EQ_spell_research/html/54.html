<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736647317">They do not need to be excellent in it, but you can only advance to their<br/>
level in the language.  If they speak at a skill level of 5, then that&#39;s all<br/>
you&#39;ll get out of it.  I believe a lot of mages are now doing a &quot;ladder<br/>
technique&quot;.  Basically one mage blows all his training points in Old Erudin,<br/>
then jabbers at the other mage till he reaches the same level, then THAT<br/>
mage uses all his training points in Old Erudin to increase it even more<br/>
then jabber back so now its like they&#39;ve both put twice their training<br/>
points in.  After that you&#39;ve got a marketable language that you can &quot;sell&quot;<br/>
for other languages.  Offer to jabber in Old Erudin for that High Elf while<br/>
he jabbers back in Elder Elvish while that Dwarf jabbers in Dwarven or<br/>
whatever.  I used to think it was quite horrid to have to spend points to<br/>
train in SO many languages, but now I realize that this is actually pretty<br/>
cool because they&#39;ve made languages hard to learn in a way.  You won&#39;t have<br/>
everyone under the sun knowing 14 languages, only those that dedicate a<br/>
large amount of time to it (and considering the real world, rightly so).<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hallo,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just some infobits to clarify some things,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. You do not need to train in a language to learn it, you <br/>
&gt; can learn it by <br/>
&gt; hearing somebody who is excellent in the language speak it. <br/>
&gt; If you are ever <br/>
&gt; riding the boat start up a language class and get all aboard who will <br/>
&gt; cooperate to speak in their native tongues. After getting off <br/>
&gt; my first boat <br/>
&gt; trip I could, barely, speak some Dwarf, and I am a Gnome and <br/>
&gt; had never <br/>
&gt; trained in any langauge with my Guildmaster. Where we&#39;ll get <br/>
&gt; to hear Dragon <br/>
&gt; or Elder Dragon is beyond me, but I do know the Gypsies that <br/>
&gt; sell Combine <br/>
&gt; weapons are related to the historic Combine Empire, perhaps <br/>
&gt; hanging out by <br/>
&gt; Gypsies and listening to them talk to people will give us <br/>
&gt; Combine... just an <br/>
&gt; idea for somebody to try out. From what I understand you can <br/>
&gt; only learn a <br/>
&gt; language from hearing from somebody who is excellent in it, <br/>
&gt; but I could be <br/>
&gt; wrong about that, however I have not been able to get my two fellow <br/>
&gt; Enchanters I travel with(my main character is a Gnome <br/>
&gt; Enchanter)to learn any <br/>
&gt; Dwarf from speaking in it even though I learned it from <br/>
&gt; hearing it spoken, <br/>
&gt; albeit from a native speaker who is excellent in Dwarf.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2. As far as combining things in the books, do not put <br/>
&gt; anything into the <br/>
&gt; books other than what the recipe called for and do not use summoned <br/>
&gt; water/items in creating the spell or it won&#39;t work. Quills <br/>
&gt; and Scrolls <br/>
&gt; apparently have no use that people can figure out, probably confusing <br/>
&gt; remnants from the Beta just like the Age of Restoration book <br/>
&gt; that was pulled <br/>
&gt; after the last patch due to it being useless.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good Luck,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
