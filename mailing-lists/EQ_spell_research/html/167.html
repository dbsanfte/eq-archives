<b>Subject:</b> Site for posting languages and spell recipes fro the list... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-525434529">Does anyone on this list have any plans to summarize or compile some of the<br/>
knowledge from this list? Of course, this would range from sharing info to<br/>
spoilers. It would include:<br/>
	- Compiled list of learnable languages (perhaps with class and race cues,<br/>
such as DE gets at Lvl 20)<br/>
	- List of which components go with which classes<br/>
	- Index of what language certain book, tomes, grimoires, etc. are written<br/>
in<br/>
	- And of course spell recipes by class<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not volunteering (smile), just wondeirng if anyone has plans to put up<br/>
pages with some of this stuff or write pages for existing sites like eqss or<br/>
eqv?<br/>
