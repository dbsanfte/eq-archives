<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248735765">Hi.  We were petitioning regarding a steal killer in the Gorge of King<br/>
Xorbb, and were told by a GM that it&#39;s not a violation to steal kills.<br/>
Training to intentionally try and kill is, but stealing no.<br/>

&gt;Speaking of steal killing in Oasis.  There was a wizard(I believe that was<br/>
&gt;his class) on Povar by the name of Yabin who is notorious for stealing<br/>
&gt;kills.  Several people reported his activities by way of /petition and a GM<br/>
&gt;answered all the complaints in a matter of minutes.  This wasn&#39;t one or two<br/>
&gt;kills but literally everything that moved that might give him experience.<br/>
&gt;He would cast twice at it and run off to find something else.  Those two<br/>
&gt;spells did more than half damage to the creature so eventually when it was<br/>
&gt;killed he got the experience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If someone is ruining your play experience like that person you can at<br/>

&gt;&gt; Enchanters aren&#39;t supposed to be good at DD. Enchanters are for INDIRECT<br/>
&gt;&gt; damage. You shouldn&#39;t expect to see incredible powers. As for necros<br/>

&gt;16-20&#39;s) in oasis last night .. You figure it out .. (Btw it was 3 tanks 1<br/>
