<div id="ygrps-yiv-825653790">I don&#39;t feel the topic of where to get research components should be as<br/>
large of a topic as it is.  When you near the levels (or are at the levels)<br/>
required for research, the enemies you fight for experience will carry these<br/>
items, it&#39;s as simple as that.</div>
