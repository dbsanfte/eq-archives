&gt; &gt;Any idea what Verant&#39;s position is on this?<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m pretty sure if a GM catches you fighting a monster without getting hit<br/>
&gt; (not being rooted of course) they will take appropiate action. This is<br/>
&gt; probably one of the reasons the flight spell was not implemented to true<br/>
&gt; flying.<br/>
&gt; This Boggles the mind for me, why would verant want to penalize you for intelligent use of spells? I mean why should you attack a monster when they can attack you back when all you have to do is fly. Many monster may still attack you flying or nay. Gnolls for example have boys often enough. That sort of pro monster trend Verant has is sort of puzzling.<br/>
