<div id="ygrps-yiv-92978044"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Anyone found Aviak Feathers yet?<br/>
&gt; We killed a whole bunch of Aviaks yesterday and got none.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You might want to try the Aviak Island in the Ocean of Tears. It&#39;s at<br/>
roughly 2300,4300 -- way off Stormbreaker&#39;s path, so you&#39;ll have to swim<br/>
there or take a canoe. The Aviaks there are tougher than what&#39;s in South<br/>
Karana, but should still very easy for a level 22 character like yourself, I<br/>
would think.</div>
