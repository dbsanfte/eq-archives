<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039965910">Ummm, may I make two points.<br/>
<br/>
One:	This is the Spell Research list - post your garbage somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
Two:	Until this message, I have not seen anyone flame another because of an opinion.  I believe Trev&#39;s note (albeit in the wrong message forum) to be a fair opinion.  He has not ridiculed or flamed anyone else.  In this case, I would see Vastad&#39;s comments on maturity level (grown man, etc) to reflect himself and not Trev.  I really don&#39;t see how an opinion about spells, etc, reflect ones maturity.  I will try not to lower myself to the level at which Vastad has so easily come down to and comment on his ridiculous post any further even though I wish I would...<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, if anyone knows if Vastad belongs to a guild, please let me know.  I&#39;ll be happy to forward his comment (which would reflect the guild if he were a member) to the guild leader.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m amazed you could get spells through on a Griffon or HG at that level. Both of these are level 30+ monsters. Accordingly I wouldn&#39;t think a level 18-20 group should be able to get one spell through. Certainly with my Wizard if it&#39;s more that a couple levels higher than me I don&#39;t even bother casting as it will get resisted fully.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unless I misread your post, I think it only prudent that Verant change this. There&#39;s no way a group of 18-20 lvl players, regardless of class, should be taking down monsters that are double their level. That&#39;s a tad extreme.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt;  Oh my god I think I&#39;m haveing a coniption (Must.... control.. Fist of ....DEATH!) Why on earth (or Norrath for that matter) would you support Verant makeing it even harder for people to advance and have fun. By saying something as innane and anal as that, you stifle team work and the desire and adventure to try something more. To be dareing & adventurious is that not what it&#39;s all about? People like you who condone such changes that FURTHER hamper the fun, ease, and playabilty for gamers should be forced to play Smurf warriors in Splitpaw or something. See, what retarted petty people like you forget is WE PAY VERANT&#39;S BILLS. and thus the game should be free of the kind of asinine restrictions that you would have further placed upon the game. Futher more, you say that it&#39;s unreasonable that a party of 18-20th level char take down a level 30 creature?!?!?! IDIOT!, If your a grown man (which I highly doubt) and 6 trained 12 yr olds come at you with sharpened Katanas (not to me!<br/>
 </span></blockquote>!<br/>
ntion SPELLS!) they would kill you even if you did have a sword you would be swarmed and KILLED, as would a lion or even bear sure 1 or 2 may die (as char commonly do in the aformentioned sitiuation. but the higher level tougher creature WOULD DIE!. So take your petty, anal, Triffling mentality, that would have us all struggleing even more for the modest exp we can already just barely gain, To Hell (or Lavastorm in a pinch) and DIE!<br/>
<br/>
We need not further restrictions but, benefits to make it more fun,<br/>
