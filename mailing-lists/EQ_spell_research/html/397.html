<div id="ygrps-yiv-671344133">Here is a question that i had seen asked before in other places, but never mentioned. It involves a Staff segment and a skull (sorry, i dont recall the name of the skull, and am told that there are 2 in the game that have been found so far). The skull is the one that adds 30 mana and + 5 to Magic Resistance (the numbers may not be exact, again sorry, but my memory sucks).<br/>
<br/>
I had heard rumors that there was a way to put the staff and skull together to form a staff much like that of the guy you find in most major cities who allows you to go PVP, but never heard if this was true or not, or if true, how it could be done. Some of the rumors I&#39;ve heard went from fantastic to unbeleivable (one i heard was that having that staff adds an additional 200 hp to you, but i find this very hard to believe).<br/>
<br/>
I have both the staff segment and the skull, so now i&#39;m interested in finding out if this is possible. Although some of the effects that i&#39;ve heard do appear far-fetched, i&#39;m hoping that it will at least be more effective than my current runed Totem Staff.</div>
