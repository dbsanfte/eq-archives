<div id="ygrps-yiv-464291464">Somewhat off-topic for research, but on-topic for languages.  Be warned.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Kinda like the leftover Bardic instrument-making materials you see all over<br/>
&gt;(pieces of bamboo, unfinished brass trumpets, etc.) it&#39;s a leftover from a<br/>
&gt;bygone era.<br/>

poles?<br/>

I have a Bard who set out to learn every language in the game since day<br/>
one.   Now that I know he&#39;ll never be able to put them to any practical<br/>
use, I&#39;m probably still going with it as a role-playing thing.   If you<br/>
ever bump into Satyric on Bristlebane, feel free to teach him a language.<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll be able to use it in a quest or something someday.<br/>
<br/>
Another nifty possible use for languages:  improving your faction with<br/>
someone.   Going up to a merchant of another race and addressing them<br/>
fluently in their own tongue should be worth something, shouldn&#39;t it?   Not<br/>
that it is yet, but it&#39;d be a fun suggestion for the non-magic races to get<br/>
some small use out of languages.<br/>
<br/>
Last thought:  I wonder if it&#39;s possible to teach languages over a Guild<br/>
channel?<br/>
