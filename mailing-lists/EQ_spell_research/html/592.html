<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010261244">Actually, I got the idea for this program from the EQ Spell Sniffer by<br/>
Wizkid.  However, it was incomplete, and didn&#39;t do everything I wanted it<br/>
to do.  So I decided to write my own.  I didn&#39;t even look at his source<br/>
code, I couldn&#39;t figure out what language it&#39;s in.  I wrote the whole thing<br/>
from scratch.  And you&#39;re right...it IS real simple for anyone who knows<br/>
programming.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I have added an alphabetical sort to the program, and when I get the<br/>
sort by class/level implemented I will post the new one.  Most people I<br/>
have talked to have said they like the program, so I will continue to work<br/>
on it.<br/>
