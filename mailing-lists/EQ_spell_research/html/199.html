<div id="ygrps-yiv-644228742">All we need for research is runes to combine right? Im a wizard.<br/>
after you hit the combine button, if you have the right stuff in the lexicon<br/>
you should see a scroll?<br/>
Just want to make sure    do you have to be at higher levels of research in<br/>
order to make certain spells  even though you have the components?<br/>
<br/>
Will it say you failed at it if your level is not high enough? If you fail<br/>
will your runes dissapear?<br/>
