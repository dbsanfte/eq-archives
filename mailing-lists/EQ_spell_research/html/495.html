<b>Subject:</b> Wiz Research Rant from Hell (long Message) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960691140">This is a copy of the last week&#39;s worth of postings I have done to several <br/>
sites on wizard research.  Wizards and others may find this info useful.<br/>
<br/>
I have researched a few spells, and wasted LOTS of runes trying to research <br/>
others. I have found many bugs along<br/>
the way, far too many to bug individually in the game, so I am posting them <br/>
on the web so other players can see,<br/>
and I think Verant employees read most of the major sites too. First, I <br/>
successfully researched Project Lightning<br/>
using a rune of Periphery and a Rune of Fulgeration. Then I scribed it into <br/>
my spellbook. Then I used the same two<br/>
runes and tried again. &quot;These items do not combine in these quantities&quot; WTF? <br/>
Very odd, since I did it once<br/>
already... So I tried again cause I thought I may have got the combo wrong <br/>
from lack of sleep or something. Same<br/>
message. I bugged it and waited till latest patch, then tried a third time. <br/>
Same message... Oh well, at least I have<br/>
this nice useless spell in my book. I successfull did a few copies of Pillar <br/>
of Fire, and about 3 copies of Identify,<br/>
only forgetting once that spells are LORE ITEMs and the new one disappears <br/>
if you are still holding the first one...<br/>
Doh!<br/>
I tried to research Fire Spiral of Al&#39;Kabor with Nagafen and Al&#39;Kabor <br/>
runes... &quot;These items do not combine...&quot;<br/>
WTF? Checked book, checked level... Yep, book says that, and I am level 20, <br/>
tried again, runes gone again.<br/>
Tried many different combinations that gave me the &quot;these items...&quot; message, <br/>
including:<br/>
1. Periphery and<br/>
Proximity<br/>
2. Periphery and Fulguration<br/>
3. Al&#39;Kabor and Fulguration,<br/>
4. Proximity and Fulguration.<br/>
None of these combined in usefull quantities... Ouch! my poor bank account <br/>
is looking pretty bare...<br/>
Next research bug... I am a Teir&#39;Dal and I started the game with Elder <br/>
Elvish at Average. There it has stayed. I am<br/>
excellent in every other language known to children of Order, and I know a <br/>
smattering of others. I have bugged this<br/>
four times so far, but still cannot read the second book properly. (Nimis <br/>
twiddles his thumbs)<br/>
Next problem is with my research skill. How the hell does it go up? At level <br/>
16 I trained 1 point, then message<br/>
says I have to train in field. Ok, all the runes I blew at level 16 didn&#39;t <br/>
raise my skill a bloody point. At level 18, I went<br/>
back to trainer, and trainer told me I could not put in any points, had to <br/>
learn in the field. What a jerk. At level 20 I<br/>
played with more runes, and my skill went up almost 4 times in a row, to 20 <br/>
points. WAHOO!! Then I went back to<br/>
trainer, and she let me put in another 5 points as skill practice, before <br/>
telling me I need to go back to field. Anyone<br/>
know how this is supposed to work? Why the wierd combination? I can normally <br/>
work this stuff out on my own, but<br/>
I dont see the pattern here.<br/>
Anyone with solutions to my wiz research problems, please post. Thanks,<br/>

You start by putting one point into research at level 16, this gives you <br/>
base 16 skill. At level 20, my skill went up to<br/>
25. I have read several other people that said they were able to gain a <br/>
point or two of skill at every level. There<br/>
must be something else I do not see...<br/>
Besides, there are only a few more circles: 24, 29, 34, 39, 44, 49. Lets <br/>
see, that is 6. 255 minus current 25 is<br/>
230. 230/6 is 38.33. Will I be able to raise my skill 38 points at level 24? <br/>
Unlikely... What if the skill gain pattern is<br/>
cumulative? Went up 10 points at 20, say 20 at 24, 30 at 29, 40 at 34, 50 at <br/>
39, 60 at 44, and the last 55 at 49?<br/>
This sounds plausible... Any other high level wizards wat to add? Feel free <br/>
to jump in at any time... Or the skill may<br/>
cap at 100, and not go higher. Then if we did 10 at every circle we would be <br/>
up to 85 by level 49. Hmm... also<br/>
plausible, cap us there so that research still fails quite a bit... I could <br/>
see this happening, so no wizard becomes a<br/>
master researcher and helps everyone on the server...<br/>
Well, that&#39;s my thoughts on the subject today, anyone with knowledge feel <br/>
free to correct me. Please ;)<br/>

Well, after two weeks of almost daily bug reports on the language cap, it <br/>
has been fixed, so I am now excellent in<br/>
Elder Elvish. Yehaa, woup de do... In other news, I reached level 21, and, <br/>
with my research skill at 25 received my first &quot;that<br/>
item is trivial for someone of your skill to make&quot; message when I tried to <br/>
do level 16 spells. Dammit!! I had<br/>
purchased two backpacks full of the stupid runes too... Oh well, I guess now <br/>
I only buy level 20+ runes... I raised<br/>
my skill in research by one point by doing a level 20 spell, then I went to <br/>
my master and bought another 4 points.<br/>
So far it seems as if I can buy 4 points at avery level, and these are on <br/>
top of any points I am able to get by raising<br/>
skill in the field. I have been unable to find any enchanters that want to <br/>
trade runs for the backpack of pages I have,<br/>
so I will be selling them soon if nobody wants them... most of my pages are <br/>
the tsarins level 16 and 20 spells, and<br/>
I play on the Rathe... I want to trade for runes or sell them for 3pp each.<br/>
More news when i know more....<br/>
