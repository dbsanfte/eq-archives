&gt; Most likely they were sold to that vendor by another PC who doesn&#39;t know or care about their value.  I have seen<br/>
&gt; them being sold by a lot of NPC&#39;s and its always at the bottom of their list of wares.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought the same thing at first, while yes the runes were towards the bottom, the words (about 7 total) were right<br/>
at the top all next to each other. So unless someone found an empty Merchant (I have seen them) and sold many words<br/>
back at one time, I would believe this is a real vendor, one more thing to think this way, as I mentioned before it<br/>
was an unmarked house but there was 2 vendors in it and one sold general goods. One more thing, they were all priced<br/>
between 2 and 3 platinum and thats with 60 charisma, the bad thing about Gnome Wizards.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I just recently joined this list but why searching for flecting<br/>
&gt; &gt; materials last night I found a Merchant in Freeport (North Freeport<br/>
&gt; &gt; Market Square) near the bank in a unmarked house selling a lot of words<br/>
&gt; &gt; and a couple ruins.<br/>
