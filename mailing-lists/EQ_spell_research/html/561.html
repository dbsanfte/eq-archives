 </span></blockquote>And what spell would this be?  If it is a DOT spell, it is resisted just as <br/>
much as your spells are (if not more).  And if you are saying it is the <br/>
Lifetap line, I believe you have gotten some mistakern information.  I am not <br/>
even sure where you got some of the information you have.  <br/>
<br/>
At 20, my tap spell does 67.  The same level wizard is doing 150.  Casting <br/>
the same spell FASTER... and the same amount of times I can cast the tap.  <br/>
Now yes, I get healed, and almost never do less than 67 (I have seen it do <br/>
less, but very rarely) but that is not as much damage as the wizzard spell.<br/>
<br/>
Please supply more concrete information with your mails.<br/>
