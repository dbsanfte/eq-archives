<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930422021">Hail;<br/>
Although I�ve done quite well by Innoruuk to eavesdrop on your conversations, I think I may have found a kinship of sorts with you all.  I am a Tier�dal Wizard in the Xegony Dimension and yes I have found this spell.  A brief description follows.<br/>
Cast Force <br/>
LVL 24 spell<br/>
AE spell centered around the caster<br/>
With my superior Intelligence for a Tier�dal, It deals a maximum of 90pts of dmg to all mobs around the caster.  <br/>
Mana cost is somewhere around 130 although I fear I payed little attention to this as I use this spell very infrequently.<br/>
Location, I know for a fact that the Beautiful Tier�dal woman in the Tower of Magic deep within Neriak sells this spell.  It can be found in the chamber of wizards, on the vendor who deals in higher lvl spells.<br/>
In closing I wish to invite all the inspiring Tier�dal wizards to use this information to their best;  Where you other races may choke on it for it is deffinately beyond your grasp.<br/>
Hail Innoruuk!<br/>
