&gt; Also, anyone else notice that FLARE no longer works?  That makes what 4<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1) Identify<br/>
&gt; 2) Sense Magic<br/>
&gt; 3) Sense Summoned (practically usless in it&#39;s current form)<br/>
&gt; 4) Flare (since most recent patch)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; anyone find any other spells not working at all? or as intended?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>1.)  Identify supposedly works to show lore for a particular item, it&#39;s just<br/>
that it has been said not very many items have lore to divulge.<br/>
2.)  Sense Magic is pretty useless, and Verant has said they will be<br/>
replacing it with something in the future.  Anyone with the spell already in<br/>
their spell books will automatically have it replaced with the new spell.<br/>
3.)  Sense Summoned I have really never used so I&#39;ll take the word of those<br/>
who commented on using it.<br/>
4.)  Flare I also have never used so I can&#39;t comment on it.<br/>
