<b>Subject:</b> Re: Levitate as an exploit... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-975093935"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;ve often wondered about such situations when using a levitate type spell.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not high enough level to use them as yet, but would this tactic be seen<br/>
as an exploit by Verant?<br/>
<br/>
No, they wouldn&#39;t because contrary to what someone else posted, once you<br/>
float down ( and it&#39;s a pretty rapid descent ), they can hit you. Height<br/>
makes no difference to mobs. Here&#39;s a first hand example. I was playing my<br/>
troll and between the entrance to GUK and South Ro there&#39;s a small tower.<br/>
Inside the tower there&#39;s a ladder that leads up to the battlements. Now, a<br/>
zombie on the TOP of the tower, was hitting me standing at the BOTTOM of the<br/>
tower in the entranceway. Seems to me this is about as unfair as being able<br/>
to walk through walls and take swipes at players sitting there medding<br/>
peacefully. : ) However, I can see the need for this.<br/>
<br/>
The other reason Verant couldn&#39;t claim that a &#39; Fly n&#39; Fry &#39; tactic was an<br/>
expoit would be because it&#39;s effectively the same as a root spell. They both<br/>
have durations. They both can wear off, so it&#39;s not a guaranteed thing. Of<br/>
course, this is all my opinion but I don&#39;t see it any other way.<br/>
