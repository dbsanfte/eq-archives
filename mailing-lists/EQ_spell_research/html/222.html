<div id="ygrps-yiv-167657548">Really...<br/>
<br/>
People here take things as too much of a personal assault.<br/>
<br/>
I was stating MY observations on skill increases Mike.  I<br/>
was not attacking anything. But I think that Verant<br/>
programming specific attacks on people&#39;s ability to learn is<br/>
not something they would do.<br/>
<br/>
There were key words in my answer by the way.<br/>
<br/>
I THINK.  I am not stating a fact as they may very well have<br/>
done just that, by programming skills not going up on<br/>
certain login&#39;s...even though I think that would hold no<br/>
RolePlay value.<br/>
<br/>
Please people...don&#39;t take every answer as a personal<br/>
affront.  Some of us here are not using English as thier<br/>
prime language and their answer may be in the form they<br/>
think is not an attack.  I try to make my answers as<br/>
non-threatening as possible.  Maybe I am doing things wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if any of my answers have insulted any of you.<br/>
<br/>
Good day.</div>
