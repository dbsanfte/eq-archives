<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-974378648">I have seen an erudite necro on fennin ro, Erusg, with one of these staffs.  <br/>
It is called the Writhing staff and I have no idea of the stats.  I also <br/>
understand it is being created using a bug and GM&#39;s are destroying them on <br/>
site.  The guy was very hush hush on where he got it.<br/>
