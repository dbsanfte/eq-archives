<div id="ygrps-yiv-968159622">I am also going to write to a few folks on this matter.  There is always <br/>
someone to mail to ... anyone else who received this should probably write <br/>
to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:abuse@...">abuse@...</a>, I seriously doubt bellsouth is going to be happy <br/>
about one of their users sending e-mail attachments containing <br/>
viruses.  Its too damn bad.  I&#39;ve already mailed mine off to bellsouth.. <br/>
who else will follow suit.  He will likely lose his internet account at <br/>
least with this isp.</div>
