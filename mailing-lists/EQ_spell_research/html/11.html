<div id="ygrps-yiv-789479523">Hello all<br/>
First I will intrduce myself<br/>
My name is Heden I am a lvl 15 mage from Erudin<br/>
hmmmm well that is about it  :)<br/>
<br/>
I have looked at a few of your emails and you <br/>
talk about different langs, first how do you tell <br/>
what lang your book is in.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have recently been the lucky one to find<br/>
a Rune of Proximity.  Why this is lucky, well I don&#39;t know<br/>
as I am not sure what class this rune is for.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for you help, and as I learn i will pass the <br/>
info on to you<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
