<div id="ygrps-yiv-923104868"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Enchanters aren&#39;t supposed to be good at DD. Enchanters are for INDIRECT<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage. You shouldn&#39;t expect to see incredible powers. As for necros being<br/>
&gt; &gt; stronger...that may be true. But remember, they pay there price for it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d say an Enchanter( level 20) Stole a LJ kill from my group ( all level 16-20&#39;s) in oasis last night .. You figure it out .. (Btw it was 3 tanks 1 mage 1 necro)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh. Enchanters have a kill steal trick which is quite<br/>
effective. I won&#39;t describe it, as I don&#39;t want to see<br/>
more enchanters doing it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that this person used this trick, but it<br/>
is a possibility.<br/>
