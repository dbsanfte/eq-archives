You&#39;re not the only one who has had problems with the practice quest.  As<br/>
off this moment the quest is completely broken and will not work, although<br/>
Verant has been slow acknowleging that fact. (especially since they made a<br/>
big deal about introducing it - hehe yet another trade skill that people<br/>
have wasted coutless sums of money only to find out that it&#39;s not working)<br/>
It should be fixed in the net patch if I&#39;m not mistaken.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Practice Research<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been trying the practice research with no success. I was hoping<br/>
&gt; someone<br/>
&gt; was able to help me. I&#39;ve researched real spells with no problem, so i&#39;m<br/>
&gt; wondering why this is much harder. And I refuse to believe that it is<br/>
&gt; bugged!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Basically I add Bat Wings, Bone Chips, and Lapis Laluli (sp?) to the<br/>
&gt; Concordance of Research and hit combine. It says these items do not<br/>
&gt; combine.<br/>
&gt; I have tried it with the quill and paper in my inventory (not that I<br/>
&gt; needed<br/>
&gt; them with REAL research).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know there is a secret to this, I just don&#39;t know what it is. I&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; much<br/>
&gt; appreciative if someone was able to share it with me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Regards,<br/>
