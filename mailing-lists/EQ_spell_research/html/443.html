<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132915347">I reside on the Xegony server and I have recently found a &quot;faded Velishoul&#39;s Tome Page&quot;, I&#39;ve never seen this item before, nor anything of it&#39;s kind, because it&#39;s stackable.  Everyone tells me that it is an enchanter&#39;s research item, but i don&#39;t honestly believe that because it can be stacked.  My question&#39;s are:<br/>
<br/>
1) is this an enchanter research item?<br/>
2) if not then what is it for?<br/>
3) is this item rare?<br/>
4) what would someone pay for this item?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you;<br/>
