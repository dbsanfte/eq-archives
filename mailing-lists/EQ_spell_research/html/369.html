<div id="ygrps-yiv-83987248">I agree 100%. I think all caster should be penalized for resist exactly the same way. Why is it necros get a spell that can&#39;t be resisted? Just think its total BS.<br/>

    <br/>
    Just a lil point,<br/>
        I have watched a group of lvl 16 necros kill sand giants.... Ok, thats fine, but here is what irks me. I realize that as an enchanter I am not expected to do the offense like wizards, magicians or even necros, Our prime directive is debuffing and buffing and we get some incredible spells. Here are my rants.<br/>
            1. we don&#39;t get enought buff or debuff that only WE have. Why do other classes get beserker str? Thats unbeknownst to me.<br/>
            2. Ok, i can understand perhaps them resisting our offensive dmg spells but how are we supposed to be a group debuffer if they resist all our spells? Even after using tashan or tashanii which also have a tendency to get resisted? Kinda makes us useless in that regard eh?<br/>
     <br/>
    Just a few things im kinda irked about...<br/>
