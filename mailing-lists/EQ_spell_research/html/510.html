<b>Subject:</b> Re: Research above Lev. 29 for wizards, odd Rune, want to buy a Crysknife <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-110520931">Well, I buy runes for 2 pp (and friends give them to me). I then make spells<br/>
that would cost me anywhere from 9 to 15 pp to buy. 4 pp for a 15 pp spell is a<br/>
bargin. I also sell spare spells at cost. <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of runes. I was given a Rune of Velious. Anyone know what it&#39;s used<br/>
for?<br/>

PS A friend is looking for a Crysknife, give me a tell if you have one for<br/>
sell. We killed Ghanex many times, but he was never kind enough to give us one.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok,  I&#39;ve spent a lot of time &quot;researching&quot; this whole research thing.  If<br/>
&gt;you look at the list of researchable spells on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mythiran.com/">http://www.mythiran.com/</a> and<br/>
&gt;compare this to the spell list at stratics you will find that the only two<br/>
&gt;spells that are research only are the two level 16 area affect spells Pillar<br/>
&gt;of Fire and Project Lightning.  Hardly worth the hundreds of plat players<br/>
&gt;are spending on runes.  The list at stratics only goes to lev. 29.  Do any<br/>
&gt;of you high level wizards know if research EVER becomes useful?  Also, are<br/>
&gt;the rumors true about secret spell books?  (other than the known 4)<br/>
