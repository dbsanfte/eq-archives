<div id="ygrps-yiv-346232717">I have some questions about some words if any of you know the answers.<br/>
<br/>
1.  I have about 7 words of Dominion but one of them won&#39;t stack with the<br/>
rest?  Is this bug from a word from before the stacking patch or is there<br/>
some other use for a non stacking word?<br/>
<br/>
2. I have Words of Pacification and Words of Derivation.  Can someone tell<br/>
me what spells these are for?  I looked all over a few sites that have<br/>
research info and couldn&#39;t find either of these words listed.<br/>
<br/>
3.  I have a Velishouls Tome Faded Page but it dosen&#39;t have a page number<br/>
associated with it.  I noticed on the lists that there are 2 versions of<br/>
Faded pages for Velishouls Tome.  One a page 16 and one a page 108.  Does<br/>
anyone know which version of the Faded page I have if it has no page number?<br/>
<br/>
4.  I have Words of the Sentient but there appear to be two different types<br/>
one says &quot;A.... the other B....   (I put dots in to signifify that I can&#39;t<br/>
remember the rest of the word.  But these A and B words are in parenthesies<br/>
after the name of the Page.  Any clue what each is for?  I know Words of<br/>
the Sentient are used for the Necro spell Restless Bones and Intensify<br/>
Death.  I assume one type is for each spell.  Can someone tell me which is<br/>
which?<br/>
<br/>
Its amazing the stuff you find when you start sorting all your junk in the<br/>
bank :)<br/>
