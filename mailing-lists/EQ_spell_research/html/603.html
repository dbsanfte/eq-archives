<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671611451">If you played on the PvP server you wouldn&#39;t have that problem. If<br/>
someone steals _A_ kill, even one, you&#39;ll most likely see the following text<br/>
shouted out: &quot;Do it again [insert name here] and you die.&quot; Usually people<br/>
heed that warning, others crawl out of the zone with their lives if they&#39;re<br/>
lucky.<br/>

Re: Cast Force<br/>
    Magicians have a similar spell, Flame Flux, that does the same amount of<br/>
damage. I did 270+ in 1 cast once, very nice. A good spell if you aren&#39;t<br/>
standing near others not in your group or you don&#39;t have pets.<br/>

Re: Rune of xxxxxxxxxx<br/>
    I give all my research items away, unless I&#39;m selling it to someone who<br/>
is way lower. I&#39;ve never seen research components sold in zone Cazic-Thule,<br/>
only given away. I have so many words that I don&#39;t have space, literally, to<br/>
keep anything that won&#39;t be useful to me. I&#39;ve never seen a spell that<br/>
couldn&#39;t be bought and I&#39;ve never researched anything because of that, so<br/>
research components are worthless (up to now at least).<br/>
