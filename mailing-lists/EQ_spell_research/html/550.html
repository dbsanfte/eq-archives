<b>Subject:</b> Re: Specialization.. is it working? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475287265">I have trained in specialization.  Being a wizard, I dumped most my training<br/>
points into Evoke, though I put a point into all 5 to get the basics.  I am<br/>
now 52 in Evoke and 24 or 25 in the other four skills.  I have also seen<br/>
Specialize: Evoke and Specialize: Abjure go up from use since training in<br/>
them.  As I recall, they were somewhere in the middle on the of the list of<br/>
trainable skills.  I think it goes combat/usable skills, specialize skills,<br/>
trade skills, language skills from top to bottom in the trainers list.<br/>
