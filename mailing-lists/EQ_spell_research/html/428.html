&gt; I too believe that we should be able to research ANY<br/>
&gt; spell....that would give us a reason to study ALL other<br/>
&gt; languages....(For those of us that don&#39;t want fully written<br/>
&gt; out instructions on what components are needed for what)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just recently saw an addition to the seller of spellbooks (we all know the merchants: Throwing dagger,<br/>
scroll, quill, wrist pouch, and books, of course).  There was a book called &quot;On Languages&quot; which explains<br/>
not exactly as to which books use which language, but moreso as to easier books use these languages,<br/>
later books use these languages, and most advanced books use this language.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know when this was added however.</div>
