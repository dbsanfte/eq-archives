<div id="ygrps-yiv-317575483">I would definitely /bug it.  It sounds like the language bug (Improvements invisible until you zone). By the way, did you try zoning instead of logging out?  It might work.<br/>

&gt; In case you&#39;re wondering...   It DID happen.  Logging back in seemed to affect the skill.  I have also heard that putting one skill point into it would knock it out of its stasis and allow it to continuously improve again.  I know that its not supposed to work that way...   but thats how it is.<br/>
