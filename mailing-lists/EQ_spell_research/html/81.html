There are spells listed under the actual spell you are researching.  Are<br/>
these COMPONENTS to go out and buy and place in there or are you just<br/>
supposed to have them WRITTEN into your spellbook in order to get the next<br/>
level of spell through research?<br/>

&gt;LVL 24 RESEARCH:<br/>
&gt;Here is the low down on what has been happening with me.  Also, thank<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;Vicki. :)<br/>
&gt;I found Gloves of Rallos Zek,<br/>
&gt;Flame of Vox ( qty 2 )<br/>
&gt;Words of Coersion ( qty 2 )<br/>
&gt;Words of Transendence (qty 2)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1- My friend Arkaine (lvl 35 magician on fennin with me) successfully<br/>
&gt;made<br/>
&gt;a level 20 earth elemental.  So the methodology is there.  NO NEED FOR<br/>
&gt;PEN<br/>
&gt;AND PARCHMENT.  Just the three components listed in the book then<br/>
&gt;combine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2- Everfont is broke.  Level 20 water ele is broke.  Level 24 Earth ele<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;broke.  How do i know?  Well i no longer have Gloves of Rallos Zek and<br/>
&gt;now i<br/>
&gt;am down to 1 Words of Coersion.  Also I am down to 1 words of<br/>
&gt;transendence<br/>
&gt;becuase i tried to create level 24 earth ele and everfont only to get<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;message that these hard earned and extremely rare items do not go<br/>
&gt;together<br/>
&gt;to form jack squak.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3- Arkaine was successful in creating level 20 earth, so the method on<br/>
&gt;how<br/>
&gt;to do it is real simple.  Put in the three components, click combine.<br/>
&gt;However it would not allow Arkaine to create level 20 water nor<br/>
&gt;everfont,<br/>
&gt;and it would not allow me to create everfont nor Level 24 earth.  I<br/>
&gt;talked<br/>
&gt;to the man who updates and maintains EQLizer which is at Gameznet.com<br/>
&gt;who is<br/>
&gt;in my guild and he talked to GZ less then a  week ago.  GZ told him that<br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt;research was implemented EXCEPT magician research.  I believe they<br/>
&gt;forgot to<br/>
&gt;implement ALL our research, just some of it.  If any of have luck, let<br/>
&gt;me<br/>
&gt;know.  Once again, YOU DO NOT NEED PEN AND PARCHMENT<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Most Of The Magicians Spells research Are broke ( Still mostly a beta<br/>
&gt;Character) Some work some don&#39;t .... As For the Rest I don&#39;t know  Never<br/>
&gt;bothered to research them on the Net or get information about them<br/>
&gt;anyone high enough level to research in the other classes never bothered<br/>
&gt;to post anything general that I have Found ..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope this helps..<br/>
