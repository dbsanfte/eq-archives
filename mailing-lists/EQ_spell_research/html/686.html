<b>Subject:</b> Part of a rune <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-736389177">Yesterday in Runnyeye my group managed to kill one of the evil eyes that<br/>
attacked.  I looted the body and found &quot;Top part of a rune&quot;.  The item<br/>
is a lore item which is also &quot;no drop&quot; (it can not be traded, dropped,<br/>
or sold).<br/>
<br/>
We continued fighting there the rest of the night and killed another<br/>
evil eye.  This one had &quot;Middle part of a rune&quot;.  This is also a lore<br/>
item but is not listed as &quot;no drop&quot;, so the group gave this part to me<br/>
also.<br/>
<br/>
I have also heard these pieces have been found in South Karanas.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am assuming there is also a &quot;Bottom part of a rune&quot;, but does<br/>
anyone know what these are for?  Is it a quest somewhere to assemble<br/>
this rune?  If so, what rune?<br/>
