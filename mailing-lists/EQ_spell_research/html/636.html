 </span></blockquote>Got the info in a post from GZ when all us magicians were complaining about<br/>
not having pets past level 20 because research items were too rare. In the<br/>
post GZ said the percentage would be upped by 300%. He detailed a few other<br/>
things about research and one of them being that research starts at Lev 16<br/>
and hence only Lev 16+ monsters would drop components.<br/>
<br/>
I guess there is a good chance this has changed, I must say I have killed<br/>
that little dwarf in Crushbone about 50 times and never got a component, but<br/>
I don&#39;t doubt what you say, and your right he is Level 12-14.<br/>

P.S. This thread started as a whats a &#39;Summon Element Scroll&#39;. I have since<br/>
found out that quite a few people have found just this as a drop from MOB&#39;s.<br/>
Some of them said where, and i&#39;ve sort of concluded that any MOB that drops<br/>
components could drop this scroll. I guess they are just damn rare!!</div>
