<div id="ygrps-yiv-529646143">Well, this changes throughout the levels...<br/>
At Lvl 1, your statement would not be true, without question 2 levels higher<br/>
would be Red...<br/>
As you move up the levels, the range increases.  I&#39;m sure someday we&#39;ll see<br/>
a nice chart on how the spread increases but for now just know that it does.<br/>
You can usually get a &#39;feel&#39; for it as you continue to con the same old<br/>
beasts as you are leveling.  I can&#39;t remember for sure, but I do remember<br/>
feeling that at Lvl 13, anything 3 levels above was Red.<br/>

The Yellow con does not mean 1 lvl higher. it can be a max of 4 lvl higher.<br/>
above 5 lvl higher is a red</div>
