<b>Subject:</b> Re: On Runed Totem Staffs <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-966326654">I personally have no idea if the skull and staff can currently be combined.<br/>
I like the idea.<br/>
<br/>
Based on pure semantics though, calling it a runed totem staff implies there<br/>
should be a totem on it. The skull being the totem makes sense to me. Though<br/>
in that case I think it would make more sense to have the staff be called<br/>
the sacred runed staff and the staff + skull be called the runed totem<br/>
staff.<br/>
<br/>
Just some musings.<br/>

&gt; No I have to disagree, ever seen the priest of discord <br/>
&gt; infront of the castle<br/>
&gt; in Rivervale. .. perfect example of how it looked.  In beta you could<br/>
&gt; combine them by clicking on the staff and then the skull and <br/>
&gt; it was that<br/>
&gt; easy. . .but they changed it.  Also the name of the staff when it is<br/>
&gt; combined is The Sacred Runed Staff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; That is a Myth.  You cannot combine a Runed Totem Staff and a <br/>
&gt; Skull.  The<br/>
&gt; skull can be placed in your 2nd hand if you are not using a <br/>
&gt; 2h weapon.  This<br/>
&gt; will increase your mana by 20 and SV by 3 I belive..<br/>
