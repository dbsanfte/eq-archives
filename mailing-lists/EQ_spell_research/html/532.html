&gt; &gt; Does anyone know what I can do with this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe that there is a quest in the Wizards guild in Freeport that uses<br/>
&gt; that book.  So I think it is a quest item.  (not 100% sure ... but I remember<br/>
&gt; a quest asking me to get a book from Lord (sombody).<br/>

<br/>
Lydl Mastat:  A wizard guildmaster at the top floor of the arcane science building wants to<br/>
teach an apprentice named Lydl Mastat a lesson.  You are supposed to find Lydl and kill him<br/>
and return whatever he has to this NPC.  He can sometimes be found outside the South Gate to<br/>
the newbie zone of East Freeport near a couple of cacti.  His is approximately level 5.<br/>
<br/>
I have the book to, but haven&#39;t been able to find out which guildmaster the quest originates from.  I guess he won&#39;t give me the quest because a) I&#39;m to high of a level or b) He won&#39;t give me the quest since I already have the book.  If anybody<br/>
knows the specific guild masters name I&#39;d appreciate it too.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
