&gt;Subject: Summon Element Scroll<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The level 16 Magician Spell, Summon Heatstone requires a component called<br/>
&gt;&#39;Summon Element Scroll&#39;, does anyone know what this is? I&#39;m thinking maybe<br/>
&gt;it is any Summon Elemental (Pet) scroll.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well Tremor, I&#39;ve ask that very same question to almost every magician on Fennin Ro, including EVERY GM that i can get ahold of.  The standard reply is &quot;Gee I don&#39;t know, i&#39;ll document it.  Good luck!&quot;    Therefore i can only assume that Verant has NO ONE actually verifying the text put into the game. I do NOT think it&#39;s a pet scroll since most of them are used only for other pets.   This was probbably a spell that was never put into the final, and since the Heatstone spell is able to be purchased, not many magicians have complained.  I&#39;d do a &quot;FEEDBACK&quot; to let them know.  I already have as well. <br/>
