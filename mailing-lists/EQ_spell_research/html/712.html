<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693968316">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying the practice research with no success. I was hoping someone<br/>
was able to help me. I&#39;ve researched real spells with no problem, so i&#39;m<br/>
wondering why this is much harder. And I refuse to believe that it is<br/>
bugged!<br/>
<br/>
Basically I add Bat Wings, Bone Chips, and Lapis Laluli (sp?) to the<br/>
Concordance of Research and hit combine. It says these items do not combine.<br/>
I have tried it with the quill and paper in my inventory (not that I needed<br/>
them with REAL research).<br/>
<br/>
I know there is a secret to this, I just don&#39;t know what it is. I&#39;d be much<br/>
appreciative if someone was able to share it with me.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
