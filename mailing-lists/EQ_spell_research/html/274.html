If this thread continues tomorrow I will change the list to moderated for a <br/>
while.  I don&#39;t like to do that, because I could only message check certain <br/>
times a day.<br/>
<br/>
An apology was sent on the list, it should be over with.<br/>
<br/>
I really do not want to be draconian about this... but enough is enough.  And <br/>
general advice for people...  please read all mails about a subject before <br/>
mailing your response, it helps keep the continuity.<br/>
