<div id="ygrps-yiv-765965834"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; Should this list be made moderated?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am voting ofcourse but i wanted to add this note. There is going to be<br/>
a lot of helpfull people leaving our list as soon as they are good with<br/>
reseach and languages. The reason is simple,one has only to look at the<br/>
emails we r getting from this list from people who do refuse to abide by<br/>
the rules.<br/>
<br/>
The end result is predictable, most of the knowledgeable people will<br/>
leave if they havent done so already,instead of hanging around helping<br/>
others. After all who wants to sort thu 60 spam emails,and if lucky<br/>
maybe find a couple related to research.<br/>
