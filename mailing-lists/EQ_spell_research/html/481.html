<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090587481"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Has Anyone heard anthing about a 8th level Enchanter spell called<br/>
&gt;Pillage? It&#39;s supposed to be researchable?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I asked about this spell earlier and as far as i can tell it has been<br/>
removed from the game, unless it HAS been moved into the research bin. If it<br/>
has I havent come across the page number yet, tho i&#39;ve still got some pages<br/>
that i cant research until i get the other half.<br/>
<br/>
However, if your interested in an item that i believe was created from this<br/>
spell, it is the egg shaped pumice sold by the herbalists in all major<br/>
cities. When you look at it&#39;s stats it says Pillage and the effects of it<br/>
are to remove all enchantments, buffs, and debuffs from someone. The item<br/>
costs 15 plat but can come in very handy. I purchased one and used it in<br/>
Highpass with a group fighting the gnolls there. They tended to cast root on<br/>
ya then swarm over you. The Pillage stone would imediatly remove the root so<br/>
you could run. I saved the life of several party members with it. Although<br/>
i&#39;ve never tried it, it&#39;s possible it might remove a charm effect.<br/>
<br/>
It has 5 charges on it, and rumor has it that after it is used up it will<br/>
recharge on it&#39;s own after 1 week of game time, however i never found that<br/>
to be true. I didnt wait long enough i dont think to find out.</div>
