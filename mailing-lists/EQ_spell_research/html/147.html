<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701184287">Ah..  I dont have problems anymore with mobs killing me.  I&#39;m just worried that I wont be able to use the Fanged Skull Stilletto later on, if I dont improve my skills now.  I&#39;ll take your advice though and keep piercing.  Thanks for giving it.<br/>
<br/>
Also..   oops. Sorry all.  I&#39;m on both lists.. and accidentally sent it to the wrong one.  =/<br/>

&gt; Your skill will improve with time.  I ran into this problem myself with 1H Blunt.  The best solution is to follow this procedure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Find a group<br/>
&gt; 2) Attack a mob (monster)<br/>
&gt; 3) wait until the tanks get a few hits in<br/>
&gt; 4) Place yourself BEHIND the mob<br/>
&gt; 5) Start swinging your fang<br/>
&gt; 6) When the mob is low enough on HP&#39;s, step behind the tanks and burn as usual<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only time this doesn&#39;t work is against semi intelligent mobs who have a natural distaste for casting classes.  You&#39;ll find this out when they turn around and attack you.  If this happens, just step back.  Getting behind the mob is important<br/>
&gt; because you get a &quot;chance to hit&quot; bonus, and this will raise your skill faster.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good Luck, and by the way, this question is a little bit off topic.  You may be better off posting it to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> (another very active mailling list)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I forgot to work on my piercing skills for about 4 levels...  then when I went back to using a Giant snake fang..  it wont increase my skill..    Do I have to put some practice points into it?  Or does it just take longer to get back to increasing?<br/>
