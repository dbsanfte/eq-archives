<div id="ygrps-yiv-390337238">The following announcement, about a proposed player meeting on E&#39;ci server<br/>
at noon Central today Sunday, to trade languages and hard-to-find spell<br/>
components, was posted by Alkrum the Atomic on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqvault.com/">http://www.eqvault.com/</a><br/>

I just thought it would be great if people from other servers copy Alkrum&#39;s<br/>
idea (I&#39;m sure Alkrum doesn&#39;t mind me saying this) and get these meetings<br/>
going on their own server. A regular day and time also helps if this event<br/>
is to become an on-going, well-attended thing, just like a real-life weekly<br/>
street market. If this gets off the ground, I think it would really help<br/>
open up the market both for spell components and for ready-made researched<br/>
spells.<br/>

===================================<br/>
Research Gathering <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to invite you all to a fair of sorts on the E&#39;ci server. It will<br/>
be held in the courtyard outside the Mage-type guilds in Freeport. The<br/>
event will begin at around Noon cst this Sunday, and will last until<br/>
everyone leaves. At around 12:15 groups will form for those that want to<br/>
raise their skill in the many languages of Norrath. I also hope to have<br/>
some vendors there selling items that a mage would be interested in.<br/>
Hopefully some of the vendors will be selling research components. Anyway,<br/>
this is going to be a very relaxed event: just a bunch of magic users<br/>
sharing their knowledge of different languages, buying hard to get items,<br/>
trading stories of their adventures across Norrath. <br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you all there, <br/>
Alkrum the Atomic</div>
