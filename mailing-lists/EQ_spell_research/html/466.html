<div id="ygrps-yiv-537868549">I played a monk for a bit during Beta and the guild master offered Dragon as <br/>
a language but it was at a mid to high level, 24ish I think.  I haven&#39;s <br/>
tried a monk during commercial so I do not know if it is still there but I <br/>
am assuming it is.<br/>
