&gt; &gt;I do wish they made them all stackable!  I have been on a long quest for<br/>
&gt; &gt;handmade backpacks because of that... need all 70 slots in my locker to<br/>
hold<br/>
&gt; &gt;words. (one slot for the book)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Where do you find handmade backpacks?  Or more to the point, how do you<br/>
&gt; MAKE them?  After spending a ridiculoud amount of time and money searching<br/>
&gt; for the answer and experimenting with combinations that don&#39;t work,<br/>
neither<br/>
&gt; I nor any guild member have been able to figure out how to tailor a<br/>
&gt; Backpack.  If I read into your message correctly, the tailored backpacks<br/>
&gt; have 10 slots instead of the standard 8?  That answers the long-asked<br/>
&gt; question of why backpack patterns are more expensive than backpacks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I realize this is a bit off-topic, but I have seen mention of handmade<br/>
&gt; backpacks NOWHERE else.  And no one else seems to have a clue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
