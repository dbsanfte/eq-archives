&gt;     Elidain, &quot;us&quot; refers to Wizards.  The class that has nothing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Then you were not useing the right spells.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  The Necromancer won.  I have higher Magic resistance, but<br/>
&gt; his spells did full damage every time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only spell we have that does full damage everytime is our Drain spell. SOP (Shock of Poison) is resisted all the time...I have hit treant after treant for only 3-36 points at a time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  My spell did full damage once, and<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Luck of the draw...I have had that happen too...live with it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Just so you know, we dueled<br/>
&gt; with NO BUFFS on.  The speed of his spell was too much, as he always was<br/>
&gt; ahead of my casts.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That just means he started casting before you.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Root at level what 8? Necromancer get a pet...but mobs tend to frenzy past our pet...We dont&#39; get root till 34.<br/>
<br/>
Damage that can do 1100? Sure maybe not till you get to the top of your class, but it is there.<br/>
<br/>
The most we can do I believe..(Same level) 400. Big difference.<br/>
<br/>
Travel?  I think this explains it all.....saves much time walking back to your corpse in S Karana because you forgot that you bound yourself in Najena the night before.<br/>
