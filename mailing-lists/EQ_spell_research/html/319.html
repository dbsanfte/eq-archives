<b>Subject:</b> Hidden gems for Magicians? (per Geoff Zatkin) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-389993806">Recently, Geoff Zatkin (Verant&#39;s boss of their magic system) has <br/>
posted a rant/rave about magicians, because so many people were complaining <br/>
to him that magicians get short changed.  He said in his analysis that there <br/>
were some really great hidden things that magicians can get but no one has <br/>
discovered yet.  He also said that once these secret goodies started being <br/>
discovered, they would be made available at vendors where anyone could get <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
	Has anyone any clue about these hidden, desirable things?<br/>
<br/>
	If you want to read Geoff&#39;s post on magicians, I think Stratics, <br/>
EQVault, and EQ&#39;lizer all have it.  It is very enlightening and useful for <br/>
anyone playing a magician or grouping with one.  [WARNING, &quot;I hate my class&quot; <br/>
whine follows]  Last night&#39;s patch mentioned just as briefly as possible that <br/>
&quot;magician&#39;s pets will no longer run away from combat&quot;, but I guess that <br/>
little bug didn&#39;t make it into Geoff&#39;s analysis that he wrote two or three <br/>
weeks ago.  I also think magicians are hurt worse than anyone else by <br/>
disconnections and crashes, which he didn&#39;t address.  But, still, tis a good <br/>
read and thoughtfully written.</div>
