<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-309393828"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Next, i tried my hand on 29th one time. Unfortunatly after putting the<br/>
&gt; correct runes(29th take 3 runes) and combining they did not combine to<br/>
&gt; produce anything . so i am assuming that 29th spells need a 4th<br/>
&gt; component, the book did not mention anything else so i am clueless as to<br/>
&gt; what else is needed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If anyone can shed some light as to wether something else is needed<br/>
&gt; after 29th , i would appreciate it.<br/>
&gt; Also i am quiet puzzled by runes wich do not appear in any of the 4<br/>
&gt; books. Guess there must be more books out there,maybe quest rewards?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>    I read you can&#39;t research spells until you are that level (can&#39;t get 24<br/>
spells till you are 24). That might be the problem there but your email<br/>
didn&#39;t state what level you are, so who knows.<br/>
<br/>
    Does anyone know when the next patch to fix the numerous magician<br/>
research spell bugs is supposed to be applied?<br/>
<br/>
    And please keep the messages on topic. Soon as I see someone whining<br/>
about viruses or their class, it&#39;s gets unread, unoticed, and deleted.<br/>
