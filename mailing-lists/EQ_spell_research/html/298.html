About the Research thing, i m trying to organise a meeting with a bunch of Dark Elfves Necros in order to learn all the language. For those who didnt understand of what i m talking about...we have four language research to know: Old Erudian, Elder Teir&#39;Dal aka Kobolt language; Dragon and Combine language. So what i m doing is quite simple: i gather 10 necros including me:<br/>
- necro1 is going to learn 10 points of Kobolt for example and learn this 10 points to the whoel group<br/>
-necro 2 who has already 10 points go to train 10 points in the guild and learn his knowledge to the group<br/>
- on an so on<br/>
-necro 10 who has 90 in kobolt language go to learn blah blah. Then after this long process everyone is knowing the kobolt language perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
Positive: You meet a lot of people that can become friends...plus they all from the same class so it can helps for further advices.<br/>
            You can translate the necro book for only 10 points training skill<br/>
<br/>
Negative: Hard to gather so many ppl =0<br/>
              Long process<br/>
<br/>
Cya all on Rathe Server<br/>
