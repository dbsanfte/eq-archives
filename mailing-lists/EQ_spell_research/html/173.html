<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1084410826">But saying that skills only show level+1 when you learn them<br/>
is misleading.  That was my point.<br/>
<br/>
If we do that here and are not correct...then others are<br/>
gonna say...&quot;What the heck is going on? I thought my<br/>
research should have said 17 not 2.&quot; I think that people<br/>
make &quot;Formulas&quot; way too fast.<br/>
<br/>
That can be a detriment to people here. Not all people take<br/>
things with a grain of salt.  I know that from trying to<br/>
charge 1-2 plat for bindings...They don&#39;t understand that I<br/>
really don&#39;t want to take the time to find them...cast the<br/>
spell...and meditate the mana back for a measly 4 gold...I<br/>
could kill one Orc warrior for 2 plat..and take less time.<br/>
<br/>
And before you people attack my comments....I am not flaming<br/>
anyone...just stating an opinion on these formulae&#39;s out<br/>
there...I have seen TOO many that are not correct.</div>
