know are all runes sold at same price or higer lv ones have also higer price? <br/>
<br/>
I have also buyed one rune of Soulsek Ro for cc. 3 plat<br/>
<br/>
Players also sell all runes for cc 1 to 3 plat moust for a 1 and half plat<br/>
did higer lv runes have higer price?<br/>
<br/>
Is a price for a Words and runes and pages similar? I have seen that<br/>
enchanter pages are nearly imposible to sell as enchanters are nowere to<br/>
find eheh. anyone knows what is percentual diference in number of<br/>
enchanters against number of orher classes in game ?<br/>
<br/>
For what i have seen it is that after lv 20 there is 3 necromancers, 3<br/>
wizards, 2 magicians on 1 enchanter eheheh <br/>
