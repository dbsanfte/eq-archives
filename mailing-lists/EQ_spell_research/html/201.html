<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692566717">I am posting this to both newsletters because I have seen this question pop up <br/>
on both.  The first issue I will discuss is Languages.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I have ever seen, I have never bot a skill raised from speaking the <br/>
native tounge to an NPC.  I have found that no matter what language I &#92;&#39;hail&#92;&#39; <br/>
them in they always respond in Common.  I think this because I understand <br/>
everything that they say, if it was a language that I am awful in wouldn&#92;&#39;t I<br/>
not <br/>
understand??  Also wouldn&#92;&#39;t this become an exploit?? Imaging all of us wizards <br/>
in the store by the bank in Felwithe, just saying &#92;&#39;Hail&#92;&#39; over and over again<br/>
in <br/>
say Elder Elvish, to get the NPC to spam us.  Would drive everyone nuts, and <br/>
probably crash the zone.  So I am unsure as to if listening to an NPC would <br/>
really work.  Also has anyone actually seen the &#92;&#39;your language skill increase&#92;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
after spaming the NPC and the whole zone for that matter.  I am very good at <br/>
languages and have in my time learned Old Erudian, Elder Elvish, Elvish, Tier <br/>
Dal, Barbarian, Halfling, Dwarvish, and Gnoll.  Never once have I got a increase<br/>
<br/>
from a NPC.  Please clarify this issue for me please, would love to learn more <br/>
and faster of course.<br/>
<br/>
Now there seems to be some questions here on the skills of melee.  I don&#92;&#39;t<br/>
claim <br/>
to know the calculations, but I know how to max them all.  I started with the <br/>
dagger of course, got it up to 22 or so, then got my hand to hand up to about 18<br/>
<br/>
for the heck of it.  I then got staffs, first a one handed that is up to about <br/>
25 or so, this was my travel, backup weapon which was lost when a skeleton took <br/>
a dislike to me in lesserfaydarke (was bound to qeynos) Now my main stay weapon <br/>
is a 2h staff.  I have that skill up to about 38 right now.  I got a giant snake<br/>
<br/>
fang the other day fighting in Paw.  Before that I had decided to increase my <br/>
piercing and had a summonded dagger.  It took well over 45min and aobut 300 <br/>
melee swings of the peircing weapon before I saw a single advancement, then it <br/>
flew up to 31 or so.  For ahwile I though maybe it was never going to raise but <br/>
my perseverance paid off and it did, so I am going to try and max my pierce, <br/>
find a 1h blunt and max that.  Then go back to my favorite 2h staff.  So all it <br/>
takes for you skills is patience.  Yes if you haven&#92;&#39;t used it in a great time<br/>
it <br/>
takes alot of use before you start to see skill in it again, kind of like skiing<br/>
<br/>
or biking, hehe.<br/>
