<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525422331">I think research and use of other classes spells is a good idea, as <br/>
long as there is a penalty for doing so. It would be cool if you could learn <br/>
others spells from half your level. I.E. a level 40 wizard could learn level <br/>
20 necro spells. Or if the spells were less effective. But &quot;jack of all <br/>
trades&quot; mages would be very annoying. My strengths as a magician are the only <br/>
advantage I have over the other mage classes. But still....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m saying is cross research could be beneficial if implemented <br/>
properly. But simply any-mage-can-learn-any-spell policies would be <br/>
disasterous.<br/>
