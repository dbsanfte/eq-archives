while being attacked.  It takes almost 3 combat rounds for that spell to <br/>
go...  so you would have to either be missed all 3 times (yeah right) or make <br/>
3 &quot;recoveries&quot; during that time (you are more likely to be struck by <br/>
lightning!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Again... I agree with the others ... enough &quot;I hate my class&quot; posts please!!!<br/>
