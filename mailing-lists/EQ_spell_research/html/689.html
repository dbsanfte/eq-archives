<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yesterday in Runnyeye my group managed to kill one of the evil eyes that<br/>
&gt;  attacked.  I looted the body and found &quot;Top part of a rune&quot;.  The item<br/>
&gt;  is a lore item which is also &quot;no drop&quot; (it can not be traded, dropped,<br/>
&gt;  or sold).<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  We continued fighting there the rest of the night and killed another<br/>
&gt;  evil eye.  This one had &quot;Middle part of a rune&quot;.  This is also a lore<br/>
&gt;  item but is not listed as &quot;no drop&quot;, so the group gave this part to me<br/>
&gt;  also.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I have also heard these pieces have been found in South Karanas.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Now I am assuming there is also a &quot;Bottom part of a rune&quot;, but does<br/>
&gt;  anyone know what these are for?  Is it a quest somewhere to assemble<br/>
&gt;  this rune?  If so, what rune?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is a a quest for some warrior only armor (with VERY high AC...  The <br/>
Crafted breastplate is AC 22)  The quest can be found in the Centaur Village <br/>
in South Karana.<br/>
