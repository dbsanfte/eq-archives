<b>Subject:</b> Your arguments <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-951614231">Your arguments are greatly flawed.  Which pure magic users can take on more <br/>
than one low level monster at once?  If you want to take on multiple low <br/>
level creatures at once it sounds to me like you want to be a warrior.  Also <br/>
6 necromancers vs one warrior is not fair.  Monster levels are diffrently <br/>
calculated.  For example a level 30 warrior cant take on a griffin by <br/>
himself.  Now on to more on topic matters:<br/>
<br/>
I had my Old Erudain skill level up to Excellent.  For some strange reason <br/>
it dropped back to Very Good???  /tell and regular say has been proven to <br/>
increase language skill.  Just be close to the person.  If there is anyone <br/>
on Faydwer and on the Karana server please contact me if you can teach me <br/>
Old Erudian to Excellent skill level again...  I am mostly on at Weekends <br/>
(includes Fridays).<br/>
