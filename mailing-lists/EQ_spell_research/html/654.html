<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029114998">Im interested in any runes wich are not on books, im looking for them so<br/>
that we can finaly find at last some of hiden spells, as a verant guys<br/>
declared somwere on board THERE is at last one spell for level wich is<br/>
without recipte in book !<br/>
<br/>
Until now i got one email that one person found a rune of snow! Also i have<br/>
a idea that ALL existing spells can be created thru research ( after lv 16)<br/>
anyone have sucesfuly researched any other spell wich is not receipe in<br/>
book, any of spells wich you can buy in shops? Also if you have ideas wich<br/>
components you think can combine in any existing spell lets try it! Maybe<br/>
there is hiden strenghts of int based casters what verant talk so much about!<br/>
