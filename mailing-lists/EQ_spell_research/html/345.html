&gt; I read on a Eq Info Site about the LvL 20 Flight Spell available to wizards.<br/>
&gt; Has anyone heard or seen this spell? If so give me details about it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Originally it was intended for wizards to fly. Yes fly,not levitate.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunatly it was very hard to implement and was very buggy,verant<br/>
just not been able to squash all the bugs associated with flight.<br/>
So it got warped to levitate.<br/>
Eq dev team just dragging their feet and havent bothered to change the<br/>
name of flight to what it actually has become: levitate.<br/>
<br/>
If u have the extra runes to burn it is researchable, or else u can buy<br/>
it from a druid spell merchant.<br/>
