<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018520199">According to eq.stratics.com Cast Force is indeed a direct damage spell with<br/>
2 second stun.  Now they  have been wrong in the past but I figured I would<br/>
add some fuel to the fire. =)<br/>
<br/>
I would really like to know what is the deal with this spells so I know if I<br/>
want to research it or not.  I have found most non-direct spells fairly<br/>
worthless unless you are going up against several green mobs.<br/>
<br/>
As for the insulting back talk part, we will see, I don&#39;t consider<br/>
contradicting someone as insulting especially if that person is right. =)<br/>

&gt; Cast Force<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is a magic based offensive spell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If in fact this is the spell you speak of then I beg you to<br/>
&gt; go out and attempt to cast it upon a single target from a<br/>
&gt; distance.. If infact I was at all incorrect in stating it was<br/>
&gt; an AE spell then the mistake was that it is a PB spell not an<br/>
&gt; AE spell and certainly not a DD spell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#8217;ll forgive your insulting back talk for the moment, as I<br/>
&gt; imagine you must be human and have little knowledge of this subject.<br/>
