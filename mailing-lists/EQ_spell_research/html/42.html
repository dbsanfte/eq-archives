<div id="ygrps-yiv-406163010">I decided to be an Erudite enchanter.  I am only at level 7 right now,<br/>
and I&#39;m about to play to 8.  So far, I&#39;ve put almost all of my points<br/>
into jewelmaking (that I could) and the rest into 2H crush, for when<br/>
I get the runed totem staff.  I&#39;ve used fletching to supplement the<br/>
income that jewelmaking will take.  Once I hit 8 and get enchant silver,<br/>
since I can already make the first three items with silver without<br/>
any failure (too easy for my skill class) methinks I can sell the <br/>
magic rings/bracers/necklace/etc for a few plat, then practice on the<br/>
higher level jewelery.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that words can also be used with enchanters, does anyone<br/>
have information on this?  Plus, how are these items made?  From<br/>
what I heard, the scraps/words/etc are placed into the main book that<br/>
your class gets, along with a quill and scroll (this is my guess),<br/>
combine, and if successful, a spell scroll like the ones bought in<br/>
the magic stores.<br/>

&gt; As a novice you is about to hit research in one level, can someone tell me<br/>
&gt; what form (runes, words, etc.) the components for Magicians are?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know that the Elemental Grimoir is our book for combining them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The same vendor who sells the grimoir in Neriak also sells some pages and<br/>
&gt; books, which I assume are some of the initial &#39;recipes&#39; for the skill.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; thanks,<br/>
