<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194057775">I have been fighting many many many places. I didn&#39;t get one research<br/>
component, the day I hit level 14 and started fighting things that were now<br/>
yellow con (previously red) I got a steady stream of research components. I<br/>
heard from Verant that they are NOT on mobs below level 16, only 16+.<br/>
