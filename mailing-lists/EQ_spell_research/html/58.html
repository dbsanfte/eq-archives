&gt; ancient times there was a split and a war between magic users, what<br/>
&gt; was to become the erudites with their wizardry and what was to become<br/>
&gt; the Dark Elves with there Necromancy.  It is said that to read the<br/>
&gt; text of these ancient spell casters you must learn Old Erudian for the<br/>
&gt; forefathers of Erudians and Elder Tier Dal for the forefathers of<br/>
&gt; todays Dark Elves.  I know that Tier Dal shows up as Dark Elvish when<br/>
&gt; changing languages, I also learned in my travels that Elder Tier Dal<br/>
&gt; shows up a Lizardman.  Using my higher inteligence I have concluded<br/>
&gt; that Necromancers would probably find it very usefull to learn Elder<br/>
&gt; Tier Dal as I would find it usefull to learn Old Erudian.  Now if<br/>
&gt; anyone knows how I can learn Elder Dragon, the harsh complex language<br/>
&gt; of magic itself please let me know.  I would very interested in<br/>
&gt; learning that language or Combine for that matter.<br/>

ye need meet a dragon to trigger the languae skill.. I have hear that<br/>
you need be higher skill than the one you teach to raise skill levels in<br/>
language and it seems to at least improve the speed of learning the<br/>
higher skill the teacher has. My Elder Erudian is now average ... so far<br/>
none I have met are higher and all are poor at the old dark elf and<br/>
lizardman ..<br/>
