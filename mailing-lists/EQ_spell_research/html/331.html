<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688854945">Uhh... settle down.  I appreciate the support but its a little<br/>
aggressive even for me.  Besides we&#39;re WAY off topic now anyway.<br/>
<br/>
	Basically, his arguement is that a group of necromancers can do<br/>
something no other group can do.  My arguement is that any group should be<br/>
able to do it, or there should be other penalties.  I certainly think 6<br/>
level 20 people should definitely give a level 40 mob a run for its money.<br/>
And i think if 6 wizards tried this they would probably die without tank<br/>
support (or find six warriors to stand there and die horribly).  I<br/>
definitely think that 6 magicians with pet support should give a griffin as<br/>
big a run for its money as 6 necromancers, but not so easily, magicians are<br/>
less frontline type of spellcasters and a lot more support and utility type.<br/>
<br/>
	What would I like to see?  I&#39;d like to see unique monsters be able<br/>
to do other things.  Why is the griffin bothering with our skeletons when it<br/>
should know who the REAL threat is five seconds into combat.  Or maybe it<br/>
knows its outgunned and calls out to its brother across the zone who now<br/>
hauls arse across the zone to trash us OOM spellcasters?<br/>
<br/>
	My arguement is necromancers aren&#39;t overpowered, we take a unique<br/>
place in Norrath as being quite powerful battle spellcasters with our own<br/>
bodyguards.  We also have to deal with the myriad of social problems that<br/>
being a necromancer comes with, and there are a LOT of those believe me, and<br/>
we have some serious deficiencies in other areas.  You won&#39;t see the six<br/>
necromancer group do NEARLY as well when hit by a train of elf skeletons and<br/>
necro theurgists, or by a group of Aviak guards.<br/>
<br/>
	Don&#39;t downgrade the necromancers, fix the problems with the other<br/>
classes and make the combat AI better and general combat better for such<br/>
high level monsters.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m amazed you could get spells through on a Griffon or HG <br/>
&gt; at that level. Both of these are level 30+ monsters. <br/>
&gt; Accordingly I wouldn&#39;t think a level 18-20 group should be <br/>
&gt; able to get one spell through. Certainly with my Wizard if <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s more that a couple levels higher than me I don&#39;t even <br/>
&gt; bother casting as it will get resisted fully.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Unless I misread your post, I think it only prudent that <br/>
&gt; Verant change this. There&#39;s no way a group of 18-20 lvl <br/>
&gt; players, regardless of class, should be taking down monsters <br/>
&gt; that are double their level. That&#39;s a tad extreme.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Trev<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Oh my god I think I&#39;m haveing a coniption (Must.... <br/>
&gt; control.. Fist of ....DEATH!) Why on earth (or Norrath for <br/>
&gt; that matter) would you support Verant makeing it even harder <br/>
&gt; for people to advance and have fun. By saying something as <br/>
&gt; innane and anal as that, you stifle team work and the desire <br/>
&gt; and adventure to try something more. To be dareing & <br/>
&gt; adventurious is that not what it&#39;s all about? People like you <br/>
&gt; who condone such changes that FURTHER hamper the fun, ease, <br/>
&gt; and playabilty for gamers should be forced to play Smurf <br/>
&gt; warriors in Splitpaw or something. See, what retarted petty <br/>
&gt; people like you forget is WE PAY VERANT&#39;S BILLS. and thus the <br/>
&gt; game should be free of the kind of asinine restrictions that <br/>
&gt; you would have further placed upon the game. Futher more, you <br/>
&gt; say that it&#39;s unreasonable that a party of 18-20th level char <br/>
&gt; take down a level 30 creature?!?!?! IDIOT!, If your a grown <br/>
&gt; man (which I highly doubt) and 6 trained 12 yr olds come at <br/>
&gt; you with sharpened Katanas (not to me!<br/>
&gt; ntion SPELLS!) they would kill you even if you did have a <br/>
&gt; sword you would be swarmed and KILLED, as would a lion or <br/>
&gt; even bear sure 1 or 2 may die (as char commonly do in the <br/>
&gt; aformentioned sitiuation. but the higher level tougher <br/>
&gt; creature WOULD DIE!. So take your petty, anal, Triffling <br/>
&gt; mentality, that would have us all struggleing even more for <br/>
&gt; the modest exp we can already just barely gain, To Hell (or <br/>
&gt; Lavastorm in a pinch) and DIE!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We need not further restrictions but, benefits to make it more fun,<br/>
