<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544931690">First Congradulations on our language ability. I also speak all race languages, Thieve&#39;s Cant, the 4 magical you know, and several MOB languages all to excellent. The Magical language you are missing is rumored to be Old/Elder Dragon, well if monks<br/>
got Dragon at 30 possibly they may get Old Dragon at 40. On my server, Innoruuk, the highest monk in 36 so I am only guess at level and class. One more thing I want to throw in to toot my own horn I can&#39;t read Ipsor&#39;s Enlightenment # whatever<br/>
because I did all this and I am a level 7 Gnome Wizard so I am a long way from research, also one quick question seems all races except Gnomes get stuck, Elder Elvish/OE at Very Good and Elder Teir&#39;dal/Combine at Good (doing zone trick), any<br/>
experience with this?<br/>

&gt; Ok does anyone know what language is required to read Ipsor&#39;s Enlightenment<br/>
&gt; IV (or maybe its V I forget but its the only other one sold in Freeport)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am now Excelent in 23 languages.  Among them are<br/>
&gt; Old Erudin, Elder Elvish, Kobold (Elder Teir&#39;Dal), Giant Toung (Combine<br/>
&gt; Toung), and Dragon.<br/>
&gt; Basically I am excelent in every language I have found so far.  All 23 but<br/>
&gt; I still cant read that book.  Do I need to work each language up to<br/>
&gt; &quot;Master&quot; or is there another Language out there that no one knows about yet?<br/>
