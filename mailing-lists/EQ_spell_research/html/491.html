<div id="ygrps-yiv-377192409">OK this may sound dumb, but i made my second character a wizard.  After<br/>
playing a Ranger so long, I decided the wizard would be alot of fun. And it<br/>
is, my problem whoever is that i know NOTHING about research.  I am 2<br/>
bubbles away from 16.  Can anyone please explain to me exactly what research<br/>
is.  What i need to do to be successful at it (if that makes any sense)  All<br/>
i know is that I need runes.  But what do i do with these runes after i get<br/>
them??  And all this talk of languages does that pertain to me?  I just have<br/>
a lot of questions and ANY help from my brothers here would be great!<br/>
Thanks in advance for the help!<br/>
