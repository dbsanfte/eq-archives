<div id="ygrps-yiv-124658599">Speaking of steal killing in Oasis.  There was a wizard(I believe that was<br/>
his class) on Povar by the name of Yabin who is notorious for stealing<br/>
kills.  Several people reported his activities by way of /petition and a GM<br/>
answered all the complaints in a matter of minutes.  This wasn&#39;t one or two<br/>
kills but literally everything that moved that might give him experience.<br/>
He would cast twice at it and run off to find something else.  Those two<br/>
spells did more than half damage to the creature so eventually when it was<br/>
killed he got the experience.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is ruining your play experience like that person you can at least<br/>
help the GMs be aware of the problem by /petition ing and making a<br/>
complaint.<br/>

&gt; Enchanters aren&#39;t supposed to be good at DD. Enchanters are for INDIRECT<br/>
&gt; damage. You shouldn&#39;t expect to see incredible powers. As for necros being<br/>
&gt; stronger...that may be true. But remember, they pay there price for it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d say an Enchanter( level 20) Stole a LJ kill from my group ( all level<br/>
16-20&#39;s) in oasis last night .. You figure it out .. (Btw it was 3 tanks 1<br/>
mage 1 necro)<br/>
