<div id="ygrps-yiv-688554424">Ok, so there are no good sites to go to for some beginners tips.  Are there<br/>
any items in the game that explain how to do this?  I am a level 16 wizard,<br/>
so I need to start thinking about this..  As a blacksmith, there are two<br/>
books that explain what components you need.  Is there such a book for<br/>
wizards/casters?  Thx<br/>
