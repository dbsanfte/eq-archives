<div id="ygrps-yiv-580337410">Nice to meet you Lent.  Unfortunately there are very very few emails that<br/>
come through this list, these days.  Probably since all the research spells<br/>
have been discovered.  Formulas can be found at a number of web sites.<br/>
Probably the premier wizard web site would be: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.graffe.com/">http://www.graffe.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions feel free to ask, though I am not sure how many<br/>
people still subscribe to this list.<br/>
