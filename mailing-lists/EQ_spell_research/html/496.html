<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174953441">Well for starters the first book is in Old Erudian and the second book is in Elder Teir&#39;Dial which is trained under the lang Kobold at your guild. Once you train Kobold once you will get a message that you have learned the basics of Elder<br/>
Tier&#39;Dial.  Also if you buy the book of languages in Aka&#39;non it explains which languages are used for research.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is a copy of the last week&#39;s worth of postings I have done to several<br/>
&gt; sites on wizard research.  Wizards and others may find this info useful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have researched a few spells, and wasted LOTS of runes trying to research<br/>
&gt; others. I have found many bugs along<br/>
&gt; the way, far too many to bug individually in the game, so I am posting them<br/>
&gt; on the web so other players can see,<br/>
&gt; and I think Verant employees read most of the major sites too. First, I<br/>
&gt; successfully researched Project Lightning<br/>
&gt; using a rune of Periphery and a Rune of Fulgeration. Then I scribed it into<br/>
&gt; my spellbook. Then I used the same two<br/>
&gt; runes and tried again. &quot;These items do not combine in these quantities&quot; WTF?<br/>
&gt; Very odd, since I did it once<br/>
&gt; already... So I tried again cause I thought I may have got the combo wrong<br/>
&gt; from lack of sleep or something. Same<br/>
&gt; message. I bugged it and waited till latest patch, then tried a third time.<br/>
&gt; Same message... Oh well, at least I have<br/>
&gt; this nice useless spell in my book. I successfull did a few copies of Pillar<br/>
&gt; of Fire, and about 3 copies of Identify,<br/>
&gt; only forgetting once that spells are LORE ITEMs and the new one disappears<br/>
&gt; if you are still holding the first one...<br/>
&gt; Doh!<br/>
&gt; I tried to research Fire Spiral of Al&#39;Kabor with Nagafen and Al&#39;Kabor<br/>
&gt; runes... &quot;These items do not combine...&quot;<br/>
&gt; WTF? Checked book, checked level... Yep, book says that, and I am level 20,<br/>
&gt; tried again, runes gone again.<br/>
&gt; Tried many different combinations that gave me the &quot;these items...&quot; message,<br/>
&gt; including:<br/>
&gt; 1. Periphery and<br/>
&gt; Proximity<br/>
&gt; 2. Periphery and Fulguration<br/>
&gt; 3. Al&#39;Kabor and Fulguration,<br/>
&gt; 4. Proximity and Fulguration.<br/>
&gt; None of these combined in usefull quantities... Ouch! my poor bank account<br/>
&gt; is looking pretty bare...<br/>
&gt; Next research bug... I am a Teir&#39;Dal and I started the game with Elder<br/>
&gt; Elvish at Average. There it has stayed. I am<br/>
&gt; excellent in every other language known to children of Order, and I know a<br/>
&gt; smattering of others. I have bugged this<br/>
&gt; four times so far, but still cannot read the second book properly. (Nimis<br/>
&gt; twiddles his thumbs)<br/>
&gt; Next problem is with my research skill. How the hell does it go up? At level<br/>
&gt; 16 I trained 1 point, then message<br/>
&gt; says I have to train in field. Ok, all the runes I blew at level 16 didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; raise my skill a bloody point. At level 18, I went<br/>
&gt; back to trainer, and trainer told me I could not put in any points, had to<br/>
&gt; learn in the field. What a jerk. At level 20 I<br/>
&gt; played with more runes, and my skill went up almost 4 times in a row, to 20<br/>
&gt; points. WAHOO!! Then I went back to<br/>
&gt; trainer, and she let me put in another 5 points as skill practice, before<br/>
&gt; telling me I need to go back to field. Anyone<br/>
&gt; know how this is supposed to work? Why the wierd combination? I can normally<br/>
&gt; work this stuff out on my own, but<br/>
&gt; I dont see the pattern here.<br/>
&gt; Anyone with solutions to my wiz research problems, please post. Thanks,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; You start by putting one point into research at level 16, this gives you<br/>
&gt; base 16 skill. At level 20, my skill went up to<br/>
&gt; 25. I have read several other people that said they were able to gain a<br/>
&gt; point or two of skill at every level. There<br/>
&gt; must be something else I do not see...<br/>
&gt; Besides, there are only a few more circles: 24, 29, 34, 39, 44, 49. Lets<br/>
&gt; see, that is 6. 255 minus current 25 is<br/>
&gt; 230. 230/6 is 38.33. Will I be able to raise my skill 38 points at level 24?<br/>
&gt; Unlikely... What if the skill gain pattern is<br/>
&gt; cumulative? Went up 10 points at 20, say 20 at 24, 30 at 29, 40 at 34, 50 at<br/>
&gt; 39, 60 at 44, and the last 55 at 49?<br/>
&gt; This sounds plausible... Any other high level wizards wat to add? Feel free<br/>
&gt; to jump in at any time... Or the skill may<br/>
&gt; cap at 100, and not go higher. Then if we did 10 at every circle we would be<br/>
&gt; up to 85 by level 49. Hmm... also<br/>
&gt; plausible, cap us there so that research still fails quite a bit... I could<br/>
&gt; see this happening, so no wizard becomes a<br/>
&gt; master researcher and helps everyone on the server...<br/>
&gt; Well, that&#39;s my thoughts on the subject today, anyone with knowledge feel<br/>
&gt; free to correct me. Please ;)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, after two weeks of almost daily bug reports on the language cap, it<br/>
&gt; has been fixed, so I am now excellent in<br/>
&gt; Elder Elvish. Yehaa, woup de do... In other news, I reached level 21, and,<br/>
&gt; with my research skill at 25 received my first &quot;that<br/>
&gt; item is trivial for someone of your skill to make&quot; message when I tried to<br/>
&gt; do level 16 spells. Dammit!! I had<br/>
&gt; purchased two backpacks full of the stupid runes too... Oh well, I guess now<br/>
&gt; I only buy level 20+ runes... I raised<br/>
&gt; my skill in research by one point by doing a level 20 spell, then I went to<br/>
&gt; my master and bought another 4 points.<br/>
&gt; So far it seems as if I can buy 4 points at avery level, and these are on<br/>
&gt; top of any points I am able to get by raising<br/>
&gt; skill in the field. I have been unable to find any enchanters that want to<br/>
&gt; trade runs for the backpack of pages I have,<br/>
&gt; so I will be selling them soon if nobody wants them... most of my pages are<br/>
&gt; the tsarins level 16 and 20 spells, and<br/>
&gt; I play on the Rathe... I want to trade for runes or sell them for 3pp each.<br/>
&gt; More news when i know more....<br/>
