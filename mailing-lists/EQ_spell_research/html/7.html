<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518470867">I think the second question was covered well, so I&#39;ll give some input to the<br/>
first question.  I have found one word so far and that was on a named NPC<br/>
orc in Kithikor Forest.  He was about level 14 or 15.  There were two named<br/>
orcs there, and one had a word on him.<br/>
I am a wizard myself so I gave the word to my enchanter friend.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Has anyone discovered the secrets to the Enchanters research components.<br/>
Wizards have runes and necros have pages, but do enchanters have words??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If so, does anyone know of these words?  Has anyone found these and where<br/>
are they.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; #2.  How do languages work.  I have elder erudian, erudin and common, nut<br/>
how do you get started whith other languages.  I talk to the foreegners, but<br/>
I don&#39;t get the skill to show up on my skill list?  Please help<br/>
