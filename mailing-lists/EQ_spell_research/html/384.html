&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I recieved a faded writ called &quot;A Faded Salil&#39;s Writ&quot; I was<br/>
&gt;wondering what it is used for and who uses it.  Anyone know?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m given to understand that &quot;Identify Object&quot; spell may fix this, tho i<br/>
cant say thru personal experience. There is also a faded map that can be<br/>
found at the cat isle between qey and Eru .. but was told the map was part<br/>
of a quest. Perhaps i&#39;ll make a trip back there, get it, and see if Identify<br/>
does anything.<br/>
<br/>
It was mentioned earlier that runes where tough to find. So far the best<br/>
place I&#39;ve gone for lower levels to find these things soloing is the<br/>
scarecrows. However, there are only a few of them and if many people camp<br/>
the fields it&#39;s next to impossible to find them cause they dont loot runes,<br/>
words, and pages all that often. In my experience Words were most often<br/>
looted, followed by pages, and then runes, but with the rarity of finding<br/>
these, it&#39;s possible that my findings where just random and may not be<br/>
valid.<br/>
<br/>
And finaly a question was raised about which classes uses what. As far as i<br/>
can understand, Runes go to Wizards, Words go to Necro&#39;s, and pages go to<br/>
Enchanters. Someone please step forward and correct me if I&#39;m wrong.</div>
