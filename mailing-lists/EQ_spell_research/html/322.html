<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717423158">Read it and read all the rebuttals.  Basically I have no opinion<br/>
because I really have never played a Magician neither have I played a high<br/>
level character.<br/>
<br/>
	It REALLY looks like its no one class&#39;s problem.  Everyone is saying<br/>
&quot;Wizards suck after level 34&quot; or &quot;Mages suck after level 24&quot; or &quot;Losers suck<br/>
after level 1&quot;.  I don&#39;t see why people aren&#39;t seeing the REAL problem, and<br/>
that is that everybody SUCKS at higher levels.  Come on, we all know that<br/>
Verant had to push EQ out after a short Phase 4.  They dropped a lot of<br/>
stuff thinking they&#39;d have time to implement more high level stuff in<br/>
production because obviously nobody would be high level for a while.  They<br/>
were wrong.  Check out the latest update to EQ&#39;Lizer<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gameznet.com/eq/)">http://gameznet.com/eq/)</a> to see another suspicious trend in higher level<br/>
stuff.  Verant was unprepared at some people&#39;s... shall we say devotion<br/>
(alright alright, fanaticism) to winning and now WE are reaping what they<br/>
sowed (he he or SOWed).<br/>
<br/>
	I won&#39;t argue with someone jabbering about how their 34th level<br/>
wizard sucks compared to a 34th necromancer (a whole nother topic, but I<br/>
seriously don&#39;t think necros solo THAT much better than others, I think the<br/>
slight advantage is to offset that we will spend a lot of solitary life due<br/>
to the fact that we&#39;re often KOS in several parts of several cities, like<br/>
the fact that I will NEVER see Felwithe except during a raid when I&#39;m like<br/>
level 50) or how its time to quit when tou hit level 24 with your mage.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know, never played them, but I do know that EVERYONE seems to be<br/>
having problems.  Stuff isn&#39;t implemented yet, some things aren&#39;t complete.<br/>
higher level stuff doesn&#39;t seem balanced.  This doesn&#39;t point to poor class<br/>
balancing, it points to poor level balancing.  Sort of like Verant released<br/>
their product only when they had balanced everything after level 24 or<br/>
something, and hoped to have the time to balance during production.<br/>
<br/>
	I&#39;m just say take alook around, go read the Magic Shop board at the<br/>
EQVault (www.eqvault.com), and listen how everyone seems to be having a<br/>
problems (I eagerly await to have my beloved necromancer class be &quot;balanced&quot;<br/>
in the near future, though I&#39;m sure it would just be because nobody<br/>
complains about it).  I think when everyone is feedbacking or petitioning,<br/>
perhaps they shouldn&#39;t be complaining about their prospective class more<br/>
than complaining about the general nature of the game after level XX (20?<br/>
30?).<br/>

&gt; Subject: [EQ_spell_research] Hidden gems for Magicians? (per Geoff<br/>
&gt; Zatkin)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ShrrtStuff@...">ShrrtStuff@...</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Recently, Geoff Zatkin (Verant&#39;s boss of their magic <br/>
&gt; system) has <br/>
&gt; posted a rant/rave about magicians, because so many people <br/>
&gt; were complaining <br/>
&gt; to him that magicians get short changed.  He said in his <br/>
&gt; analysis that there <br/>
&gt; were some really great hidden things that magicians can get <br/>
&gt; but no one has <br/>
&gt; discovered yet.  He also said that once these secret goodies <br/>
&gt; started being <br/>
&gt; discovered, they would be made available at vendors where <br/>
&gt; anyone could get <br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Has anyone any clue about these hidden, desirable things?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	If you want to read Geoff&#39;s post on magicians, I think <br/>
&gt; Stratics, <br/>
&gt; EQVault, and EQ&#39;lizer all have it.  It is very enlightening <br/>
&gt; and useful for <br/>
&gt; anyone playing a magician or grouping with one.  [WARNING, &quot;I <br/>
&gt; hate my class&quot; <br/>
&gt; whine follows]  Last night&#39;s patch mentioned just as briefly <br/>
&gt; as possible that <br/>
&gt; &quot;magician&#39;s pets will no longer run away from combat&quot;, but I <br/>
&gt; guess that <br/>
&gt; little bug didn&#39;t make it into Geoff&#39;s analysis that he wrote <br/>
&gt; two or three <br/>
&gt; weeks ago.  I also think magicians are hurt worse than anyone else by <br/>
&gt; disconnections and crashes, which he didn&#39;t address.  But, <br/>
&gt; still, tis a good <br/>
&gt; read and thoughtfully written.<br/>
