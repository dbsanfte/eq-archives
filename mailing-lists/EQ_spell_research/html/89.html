<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374820993">Got an idea.<br/>
<br/>
Considering both of the people we know that have received Gnoll as a<br/>
language are rangers, perhaps rangers get to know &#39;creature&#39; languages,<br/>
being that their focus would be animals and animalesque creatures.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t doubt that eventually they may learn Orc as well.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is my experience in languages.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. You must be grouped with whom you are learning.<br/>
&gt; 2. He/She must have greater skill than you.<br/>
&gt; 3. You must talk in /gsay for it to increase your<br/>
&gt; level.(Never raised my skill with /say /tell or /shout).<br/>
&gt; 4. As for skills being allowed even after not meeting the<br/>
&gt; creature. I think that certain ones can be learned just<br/>
&gt; because of your level.  After I level up I am sure to visit<br/>
&gt; my guildmaster and he has one or two languages for me to<br/>
&gt; learn.  Otherwise I would know Sphinx, and Gryphon, and Hill<br/>
&gt; giant allready...hehe.<br/>
