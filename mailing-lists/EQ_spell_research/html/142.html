<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772645144">I don&#39;t see why you couldn&#39;t MAKE another spellcaster&#39;s spells, but<br/>
I see you NOT being able to use them.  This is what I was thinking for a<br/>
competent spellcaster tradeskill.  Yo spent platinum and practice points<br/>
learning how to research, then go out and buy all the books, tireless gather<br/>
runes and words and pages and then make spells for OTHER spellcasters at<br/>
something of a profit (really though researched spells would definitely be<br/>
worth more than their vended counterparts.  I could see 50 plat for a spell<br/>
whose other circle spells are sold for 22 plat easily, if not more.  I know<br/>
_I_ would pay at least that much to not have to deal with Research. ;)  <br/>

everywhere!  I could be wrong.....<br/>
