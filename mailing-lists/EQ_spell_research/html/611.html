<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310041875">Just a note on &quot;All those damn words all over.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Most of the words you see for sale are either common as bone<br/>
chips, or just plain magician words.<br/>
<br/>
Tyranny is a Magician Word.<br/>
<br/>
There are many other in fact NOONE on my sever has come<br/>
across many of the words I have been searching for although<br/>
I got a Word of Motion the other night.</div>
