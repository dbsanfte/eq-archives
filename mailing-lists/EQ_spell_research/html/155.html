<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661316502">ok i have yet to see someone ask so i will<br/>
after successfully performing research, i hear you get a scroll<br/>
that you can scribe in your spellbook, is this one of those &quot;sticky&quot;<br/>
items or can you actually trade them with others, also, are they based on <br/>
level, ex can you scribe all the scrolls that you research, or only those <br/>
that are your level or below?<br/>
