kind of throw the balance of character classes off a bit.  Wizard&#39;s &gt;would<br/>
be everywhere!  I could be wrong.....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Possibly a rumor, ... some basis on the rumor was my experience in Beta,<br/>
however this does not seem to be the case now. Was playing a 3rd level wiz<br/>
and accidently bought a magician spell. When i tried to scribe it I got the<br/>
message &#39;This spell does not come available to you until level 32&#39; (or<br/>
something close to that).<br/>
<br/>
I rechecked the spell stats and it was strictly Magician type. Recently i<br/>
tried the same thing (Playing an Enchanter) and bought a 1st level wiz<br/>
spell, but i did not recieve anything other than &#39;This spell cannot be used<br/>
by your class&#39; .. so perhaps what i saw in beta has been ommited now. I<br/>
think the only way that different classes can use one another&#39;s spells is<br/>
ONLY if the same spell is available to different classes (Like Gate or<br/>
Invisibility)</div>
