From what I understand on Specialization, it will let you cast the same <br/>
spells you have been casting with less mana and greater effects, and with <br/>
less downtime between spells.<br/>
<br/>
The only hybrid spells I could see being done through research would be <br/>
teleport spells.  This would be a great boon to us enchanters.  If we can <br/>
look like anything and go anywhere, we&#39;ll be extremely powerful travelwise.<br/>
