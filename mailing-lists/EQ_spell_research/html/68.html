&gt; Ok....I keep asking around and I keep getting 15 different answers.  A GM<br/>
&gt; told me you don&#39;t need a blank parchment and quill in the container when<br/>
&gt; you combine.  Now do you need this in your inventory instead?  Someone I<br/>
&gt; asked told me you need the parchment and quill in your inventory to make<br/>
&gt; the spell but I don&#39;t know who is right.<br/>

somewhere that the parchment needed to placed into your combining container<br/>
and the quill had to be in your hand.<br/>
<br/>
Please, do, let me know the outcome of this.  I have to gain experiences<br/>
through others as I am still only a Level 9 wizard.<br/>
