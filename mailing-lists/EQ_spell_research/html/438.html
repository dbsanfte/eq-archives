&gt; Crocs in Oasis seem to have many pages (enchanters).<br/>
&gt; Gargoyles seem to have many runes (wizards).<br/>
&gt; I have yet to find any creatures that drop many<br/>
&gt; words (magicians and necromancers).<br/>

So far I found 6 words, 1 rune, 0 pages off of Frogloks.  I believe all<br/>
of them have been of the shamans (Gaz and Ton Shamans) as well.</div>
