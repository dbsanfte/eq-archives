<div id="ygrps-yiv-261355289">Ok, BACK to the game now...<br/>
<br/>
First off, thanks to you guys I&#39;ve accomplished my first Research of a spell<br/>
and have successfully created a Levitate Spell. Thanks for all the info!<br/>
<br/>
Now, i&#39;ve come across another type of page and am curious on what to do with<br/>
it. Rather than being a part of a page like the Grimiore, this is a full<br/>
page Entitled Velishoul&#39;s Tombe Page 68.. Just like Tasarin&#39;s page it cannot<br/>
be read like normal documents.<br/>
<br/>
I got this page from a trade with another player for a rune I had found, so<br/>
I am unaware of it&#39;s source.<br/>
<br/>
Also, anyone notice an abundance of left sided portions of grimiore pages? I<br/>
rarely find the right side portion. Is it just my bad luck to always find<br/>
the left side (I have 8 of them), or is the right side the rarer side?</div>
