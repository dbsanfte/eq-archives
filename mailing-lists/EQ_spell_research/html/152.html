 Gsay is just polite... since you will be saying gibberish to most.  Every <br/>
time Verant has said how to learn languages, it has always been &quot;if you are <br/>
near somoene speeking another language you will pick it up&quot;  so close <br/>
proximity is the key.  And groups tend to stay together.<br/>
