<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510962089"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Crocs in Oasis seem to have many pages (enchanters).<br/>
&gt;Gargoyles seem to have many runes (wizards).<br/>
&gt;I have yet to find any creatures that drop many<br/>
&gt;words (magicians and necromancers).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m an enchanter and i can help you with this (and thank you for your info<br/>
on crocs)<br/>
<br/>
While hunting scarecrows in W Karanas I found an ABUNDANCE of words when i<br/>
looted a research item, the ratio seemed to be 5 words 2 pages 1 rune. But i<br/>
must warn you, you&#39;ll not find something dropped everytime, I killed ALOT of<br/>
scarcrows and found only 10 words (tyranny, imitation, spoken, and<br/>
materials).<br/>
<br/>
Also, try in HighHold pass (or anywhere for that matter) by checking the<br/>
vendors. Alot of players find these things, have no clue what to do with<br/>
them, so just sell them.</div>
