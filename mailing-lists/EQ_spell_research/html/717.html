<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810010256">Its broke.  Ya, plain and simple.  Verant made this big deal, you have<br/>
this &quot;quest&quot;  (IE kill something and give its remains to someone), get<br/>
your practice book.  Well, they checked that, but never (it seems)<br/>
tested if you could actually combine the items.  No matter what you do,<br/>
you wont get a practice rune.  I too had a hard time beliving that<br/>
Verant wouldn&#39;t have at least tried this ONCE to see, so I messaged a<br/>
gm.  After trying for days, I finally got a reply that yes, its broken. <br/>
I also saw a message to that affect on Graffe&#39;s web page.  *sigh*<br/>
