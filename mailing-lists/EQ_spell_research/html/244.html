<div id="ygrps-yiv-704492618">The Island of the Sisterhood of Erollisi has canoes, but on the other hand,<br/>
being at roughly 230, -9700, it&#39;s also pretty far from Aviak Isle. Some<br/>
other islands occasionally have boats as well, but they&#39;re also pretty far<br/>
from Aviak Isle (In fact, just about everything is far from everything in<br/>
the Ocean of Tears).<br/>
<br/>
Given that a canoe is probably not much faster than a Level 22 character<br/>
with maxed out Swimming, you might be better off just stroking it there. If<br/>
you really want to use a canoe, you get in one, right-click on it (You&#39;ll<br/>
get the message, &quot;You have the helm, captain&quot;) and use the movement keys to<br/>
navigate.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You might want to try the Aviak Island in the Ocean of Tears. It&#39;s at<br/>
&gt; &gt; roughly 2300,4300 -- way off Stormbreaker&#39;s path, so you&#39;ll have to swim<br/>
&gt; &gt; there or take a canoe. </span></blockquote></div>
