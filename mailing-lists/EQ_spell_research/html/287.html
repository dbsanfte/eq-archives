<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334016236">I have gone on the same quest.  A Paladin (npc)in Erudin asks you to go on quest to find the Teatamnet of Vanear. <br/>
An enchantress in Erudin talks to you about her brother Moodoro Findhorn.  How he had been slated for execution for selling the magical water of the vasty deep to a npc in Qeynos at Crow&#39;s Inn called Flynn. She wants you to find Flynn and Moodoro and get the water, then she will poison it and you return it to Flynn.  (haven&#39;t done this quest yet fully though, because I can&#39;t get Flynn to talk to me.)  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, sorry about the side tangent but,  You locate Moodoro in Qeynos.  When you ask him about the Testamnet of Vanear he will sell it to you for 2gp and change.  Thus far I have come as well and need to venture to High Hold in search of the holder of the 2 pages Ran the Librarian.  Seeing as how everyone and their dog talks about getting slaughtered when they go to High Hold, I don&#39;t think I will be finishing this quest for at least a couple more lvls.  <br/>
<br/>
Although, I am very interested to see how this Quest turns out, and if you can use the Testament for any other purpose than delivering it back to the Paladin in Erudin.  It would be great if it allowed you some new spells or something.<br/>
<br/>
I do think though, if you camp that the Testament will disappear from your inventory (correct me if I am wrong).<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else has more info on this topic I would be greatly thankful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

<br/>
  I have acquired a book called the Testament of Vanear as part of a quest.  It is<br/>
  missing two pages which a NPC named Ran (Librarian in High Hold) supposedly<br/>
  stole.  It appears that if these two pages are acquired and combined in the<br/>
  Testament that you will get a working copy of the Testament of Vanear.<br/>
<br/>
  I was wondering if this was a book for research, or it had another purpose.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks in advance.</div>
