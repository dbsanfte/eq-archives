 I was on kerra isle killing wisps and an erudite madman (wizard) was<br/>
 tromping about and conned yellow to me, and since I&#39;m level 13, he&#39;s level<br/>
 14.  After some help and a lay on hands from a friend, we killed him.  I<br/>
 totally didn&#39;t expect a component cause all I read about is only on 16+,<br/>
 but I got page 24 of Tarishn&#39;s Grimoire (dunno if I spelled that one right). <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that maybe the 16+ limitation means that the creature has to be able <br/>
to spawn at that level...this last weekend I got runes, words, etc. off of <br/>
14th and 15th level mobs as well as 16th...kodiaks and borer beetles...which <br/>
can both be 16th level, but I happened to get &#39;baby&#39; ones on that spawn...;P<br/>
