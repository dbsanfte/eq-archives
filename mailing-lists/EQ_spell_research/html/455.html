<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086190949">Shame we are on different servers, I would gladly improve your languages, but I have a question for you.....You mention Monk when refering to Dragon (Are they the ones who learn it?) Also anyone have any ideas what Gnoll, Lizardman, Froglok, and<br/>
Goblin (also heard there&#39;s Orc too) are for?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the Subject of languages.   Kobold and elder Tier D&#39;al are the same.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s the same for Dark Elven and Tier D&#39;al.  They show up as two different<br/>
&gt; names depending on whether you are looking at the chat window or the skills<br/>
&gt; listing.  It also seems I am able to learn the basics of a new language each<br/>
&gt; level I advance.  I have recently gotten Lizardman and Goblin from my<br/>
&gt; trainer.   My languages so far are :<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Common, Elder Elvish, Elvish, Dwarven, Dark Elven/Tier D&#39;al, Erudin, Old<br/>
&gt; Erudin, Gnoll, Barbarian, Gnomish, Halfling, Dark Speech, Kobold/Elder Tier<br/>
&gt; D&#39;al, Ogre, Troll, Goblin, and Lizard Man.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m still looking for a high level monk to teach me the basics of Dragon.<br/>
