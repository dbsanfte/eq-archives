&gt; &gt;   Not everybody wants to spend 20 years(REAL LIFE) on a game to advance <br/>
&gt;to lvl 30.High lvls are there to be concquered, not to ber stared and <br/>
&gt;drooled at (what lvl were you eventually in that MUD?And why arent you <br/>
&gt;still playing it?).Dont forget that there will be expansion which will <br/>
&gt;increase lvl limit..Anyways if you say that lvling is so easy, then may I <br/>
&gt;ask what lvl are you?And I dont get what Diablo hacking has to do whith <br/>
&gt;high lvls?You say that thoseDiablo cheats are the fastest lvlers is EQ?Man, <br/>
&gt;yer talking BS, most of those Diablo cheats played their chars only to lvl <br/>
&gt;20 and then started cheating.And the fact that 6 lvl 20 chars killed ONE <br/>
&gt;lvl high MOB is normal,why in hell we have parties.Anyways the necromances <br/>
&gt;arent that great, they may well do agaisnt few high lvl creatures, but when <br/>
&gt;necro gets attacked by swarm of low lvl creatures, hes fucked up.And the <br/>
&gt;fact that you wont get much exp or loot from killing those SGs.<br/>
&gt;	As You can see I&#39;m not the only one who has issues with Verant&#39;s style<br/>
&gt;of &quot;Game Balance&quot; That hack it down make em weaker and weaker type<br/>
&gt;mentality. Verant is so hypocritical in doing this that&#39;s it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;insulting. Why shouldn&#39;t we be upset, why shouldn&#39;t we expect more,<br/>
&gt;fight for more, or at least what they claimed they would provide?<br/>
&gt;	As for sitting around on 7th level for six months reminds me of our<br/>
&gt;neighbors young boy who happens to have Down Syndrome.. No knocking the<br/>
&gt;kid he has a big heart, but he also has been trying to learn<br/>
&gt;multiplication for the last 3 years!. Who the hell wants to stay on one<br/>
&gt;cheesy level for more than 20hrs? think about it 20hrs is playing every<br/>
&gt;night four 4 hours? now if you don&#39;t have a family or a life of some<br/>
&gt;sort you may have the time to just vegge out on 8th or ninth level for a<br/>
&gt;year. I however do not, I want to eventualy see everything EQ has to<br/>
&gt;offer I would like to play all of the classes to 50th level. Think about<br/>
&gt;it at the &quot;Todd&quot;(the kid next door)like pace your talking about<br/>
&gt;advancing it would take you 7 YEARS! of continuous play to attain 50th<br/>
&gt;level, with the time involved doing that you could have attained a<br/>
&gt;Master&#39;s Degree. Not to mention a staggering 100 Years to play all of<br/>
&gt;the classes to 50th. Come on people who wants to sit in front of their<br/>
&gt;PC and constantly be struggling and never having enough? Not me, not me.<br/>
&gt;Besides if you want to be weak and modest don&#39;t play to gain exp. play<br/>
&gt;to role play. Heck or Play some good O&#39;l D&D around the Dinner table<br/>
&gt;with friends. But don&#39;t complain about how easy it is to have fun and<br/>
&gt;advance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Vastad,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;PS,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll leave it at that. I apologize & I am aware that this is not the<br/>
&gt;proper place for this, I just saw the comment and it made me go there.<br/>
&gt;Sorry but that&#39;s just how I feel & I KNOW I&#39;m not alone... EQ is a big<br/>
&gt;game with many servers, mabey have different types of servers. Like a<br/>
&gt;&quot;Todd&quot; server for those people that have the next 20 years free to play.<br/>
&gt;And a fun server with quicker advancement better skills and less<br/>
&gt;&quot;cheased&quot; down spells. I think we can all get along.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have one thing to say.  You&#39;re a dumbass.  If you can&#39;t get to level 9 <br/>
from 8 in 20 hours you&#39;re a friggin moron.  My magician got from level 1-25 <br/>
in exactly 10 days of playing<br/>
