<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045881347">Actually you are quite incorrect.  You use LifeDrains.  I think<br/>
there&#39;s also a reason why they aren&#39;t resisted at all too, but for the life<br/>
of me I can&#39;t remember the reason.  Necromancer DoT spells get resisted an<br/>
absurd amount by higher level monsters just like any other spellcasters<br/>
spells.  What that group did was sic all their pets on the Sand Giants while<br/>
using Dark Pact and Allure of Death, then sat there and LifeDrained it.  The<br/>
Sand Giant couldn&#39;t get through the pile of skeleton pets fast enough.<br/>
<br/>
	One of our guildmembers and several other 20+ level necromancers<br/>
repeated the tactic on a griffin on the Karana Server last night.  One died<br/>
but they killed the griffin, so it isn&#39;t so simple.  I believe a couple of<br/>
the sand giant party died as well.  Its not boring at all because of the<br/>
danger involved, especially coordinating the effect.  They repeated the<br/>
tactic again on an HG and half the team died due to poor coordination (and<br/>
probably the higher level of the monster and it may have gotten several<br/>
lucky hits in too or something, too many variables) and they were forced to<br/>
FEIGN or run.<br/>
<br/>
	Cheap?  I don&#39;t think so.  Are you saying six level 20 characters<br/>
couldn&#39;t take down a level 40 character?  Is that why I&#39;m level 18 and I can<br/>
still get killed by four or five gnoll GUARDS if my pet is only occupying<br/>
one of them?  Then of course there&#39;s the one to two bubble loss of XP from<br/>
being killed by a monster MANY levels below you.  If you want to complain<br/>
about something, talk about the XP penalties of dying to a blue or green<br/>
creature.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I jsut hope his guy isnt an EQ player...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I fail to see why you would hope he isn&#39;t an EQ player. Not <br/>
&gt; too many people<br/>
&gt; will sign up to this list and not play EQ anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;N.B: a necro jsut let me known that a group of 6 bnecros <br/>
&gt; including her<br/>
&gt; killed a &gt;Sand Giant in Oasis. 2 Levels 17, 1 Level 18 and 3 levels<br/>
&gt; 20...Amazing huh? heh &gt;NEcros are really powerfull. i dont <br/>
&gt; have any doubt<br/>
&gt; anymore =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Necros can do this because it is a cheap tactic using DOT spells. Not<br/>
&gt; amazing, just the fact that your spells aren&#39;t resisted. All <br/>
&gt; of my necro<br/>
&gt; friends, higher than those you mentioned, don&#39;t do this <br/>
&gt; because it&#39;s cheap,<br/>
&gt; boring (it takes forever to kill a level 30+ monster at low <br/>
&gt; level), and they<br/>
&gt; know they really aren&#39;t getting the kill so it&#39;s no <br/>
&gt; satisfaction for them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     I read today that you can&#39;t get level 24+ Magician pets <br/>
&gt; until they fix<br/>
&gt; it. The fix will be either the research involved in getting <br/>
&gt; these pets, or<br/>
&gt; adding shops that will just sell them. I&#39;d imagine they would <br/>
&gt; add shops<br/>
&gt; since the 24 pets are documented in spell lists not as &quot;Mist <br/>
&gt; Elemental&quot; and<br/>
&gt; what not, but who knows. I have spent 3 levels in South <br/>
&gt; Karana trying to get<br/>
&gt; aviak feathers, so it&#39;s safe to say your chances of getting <br/>
&gt; them there are<br/>
&gt; slim. I also read about a vendor in a locked hut and a <br/>
&gt; Minotaur vendor in<br/>
&gt; south karana, supposedly mage releated. Does anyone know about this?<br/>
