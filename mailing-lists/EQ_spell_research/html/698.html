<div id="ygrps-yiv-609235448">I also have had no luck.  I tried everything you did, as well as, I thought<br/>
maybe you create both runes at once.  There are 6 slots and each rune<br/>
requires 3 items.  I thought the quill and parchement might be used with the<br/>
completed runes.  So I put the Lapis Lazuli, Bat Wing, Bone Chips,<br/>
Turquoise, Fire Beetle Eye, and Rusty Long Sword all in at once.  Guess<br/>
what, these items do not combine in these quantities.  I petitioned and the<br/>
guide said they had no idea about it and upgraded it to a developer.  So we<br/>
shall see.<br/>

&gt; Has anyone successfully attempted the new practice research implemented<br/>
&gt; in yesterdays patch? I did the minor quests, recived the recepie book<br/>
&gt; and the new book to combine items. So I thought I&#39;d try the simplest<br/>
&gt; runes before using the rarer components in the harder runes.<br/>
&gt; Tried Rune 1: Lapiz Lazuli, Bat Wing, Bone Chip. Items fail to combine<br/>
&gt; in these quantities.<br/>
&gt; Ah, it mentioned needing a quill and parchment in the book. I buy both<br/>
&gt; at guild, and try the same. Items fail to combine in these quantities.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I try the next: Turquoise, Fire Beetle Eye, and a Rusty slashing<br/>
&gt; weapon. Same fail. Added quill and parchment, still same failure. Tried<br/>
&gt; many different slashing weapons. All fail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So is it buggy, and did Verant really add this whole new piece to<br/>
&gt; research without testing it in the slightest, even to attempt to make<br/>
&gt; one item? I have trouble believing even Verant would do that...so am I<br/>
&gt; missing something obvious? Would be interested to hear what kind of<br/>
&gt; success others have had with this new addition.<br/>
