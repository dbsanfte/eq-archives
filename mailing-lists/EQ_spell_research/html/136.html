<div id="ygrps-yiv-347072705">I e-mailed the fellow over at Stratics who did the magician spells list.<br/>
He told me he recieved the spell lists from Verant.  He also said that it&#39;s<br/>
possible that this spell is a GUIDE ONLY spell which Verant included in the<br/>
list they sent him.  Who knows....I have yet to hear anyone find it.<br/>
	My question is why would anyone need it if we have heatstone and<br/>
coldstone?  What other sight is there to get?<br/>
