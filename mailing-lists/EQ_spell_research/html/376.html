<div id="ygrps-yiv-671917958">Well, pretty simple. I want to know how to do it. I&#39;ve reached 19th lvl and<br/>
have basically ignored the research aspect of our class, because:<br/>
<br/>
1. I&#39;ve managed to get 1 rune, and I didn&#39;t find it, I was given it as a<br/>
friend. People say they are random, but after sitting in Oasis for 3 levels<br/>
and killing every single dw croc, dw caiman, crocodiles, caimans and Lockjaw<br/>
(twice), I have as yet to find even 1 rune. These things THAT rare? I have<br/>
also never seen a vendor selling them.<br/>
<br/>
2. I&#39;ve looked all over Queynos for the doctrine of Wizardry and never found<br/>
it. I have to take a trip to Erudin? That would be ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
3. I couldn&#39;t train in research past 1 pt. when I hit 16th, haven&#39;t trained<br/>
since then. Does this mean we have to spend numerous pieces of plat to<br/>
improve this skill?<br/>
<br/>
Could some kind soul please give me a walkthrough on how you&#39;ve researched<br/>
spells? Where and how you get runes?<br/>
