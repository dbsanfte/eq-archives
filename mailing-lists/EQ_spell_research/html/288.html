<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048633448"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; why do you have to zone when learning languages? i have never had to zone<br/>
&gt; when spamming and i learn just fine<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems to help, and the information under &quot;skills&quot; doesn&#39;t update unless<br/>
you zone.<br/>
<br/>
We know that they still go up... I went from having nothing in halfing, to<br/>
almost excellent, and it wasn&#39;t in my skills list.  I zoned, and it<br/>
appeared.<br/>
<br/>
But, regardless... when two people that aren&#39;t &quot;excellent&quot; in a language are<br/>
trying to teach each other, it seems to help more (i.e. you seem to gain<br/>
more language levels more quickly) by zoning... as per what Sonoroud said.<br/>
