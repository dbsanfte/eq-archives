<div id="ygrps-yiv-762959200">We need people like this in Everquest, since he is &#39;notorious&#39; already on<br/>
your server, why not let him remain that way? Cause when people see him on<br/>
/who, they will prob shout that this steal killer is on and try to group up<br/>
in an effort to stop this, which if you look in alternate perspective, kinda<br/>
produces a quest.  A kinda &#39;quest&#39; to stop steal killers might prove much<br/>
more interesting for many players rather than take up an EQ quest, which to<br/>
some is most boring. So with a steal killer&#39;s reputation building up, guess<br/>
who would be the top on PKs list when the PK seasons begin? Heehee<br/>

&gt;Speaking of steal killing in Oasis.  There was a wizard(I believe that was<br/>
&gt;his class) on Povar by the name of Yabin who is notorious for stealing<br/>
&gt;kills.  Several people reported his activities by way of /petition and a GM<br/>
&gt;answered all the complaints in a matter of minutes.  This wasn&#39;t one or two<br/>
&gt;kills but literally everything that moved that might give him experience.<br/>
&gt;He would cast twice at it and run off to find something else.  Those two<br/>
&gt;spells did more than half damage to the creature so eventually when it was<br/>
&gt;killed he got the experience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If someone is ruining your play experience like that person you can at<br/>

&gt;&gt; Enchanters aren&#39;t supposed to be good at DD. Enchanters are for INDIRECT<br/>

&gt;I&#39;d say an Enchanter( level 20) Stole a LJ kill from my group ( all level<br/>
&gt;16-20&#39;s) in oasis last night .. You figure it out .. (Btw it was 3 tanks 1<br/>
