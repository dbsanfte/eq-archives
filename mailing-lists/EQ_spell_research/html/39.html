In the book On Languages it states on the first page that in the ancient<br/>
times there was a split and a war between magic users, what was to become<br/>
the erudites with their wizardry and what was to become the Dark Elves<br/>
with there Necromancy.&nbsp; It is said that to read the text of these<br/>
ancient spell casters you must learn Old Erudian for the forefathers of<br/>
Erudians and Elder Tier Dal for the forefathers of todays Dark Elves.&nbsp;<br/>
I know that Tier Dal shows up as Dark Elvish when changing languages, I<br/>
also learned in my travels that Elder Tier Dal shows up a Lizardman.&nbsp;<br/>
Using my higher inteligence I have concluded that Necromancers would probably<br/>
find it very usefull to learn Elder Tier Dal as I would find it usefull<br/>
to learn Old Erudian.&nbsp; Now if anyone knows how I can learn Elder Dragon,<br/>
the harsh complex language of magic itself please let me know.&nbsp; I<br/>
would very interested in learning that language or Combine for that matter.<br/>
&lt;p&gt;May our paths cross<br/>
