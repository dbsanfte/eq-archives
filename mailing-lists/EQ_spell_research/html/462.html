<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015064261">I hear that when Specialization come in that we will be able to cast the<br/>
spell using less mana depending on what we are specializing in. That being<br/>
the case, If we specialize in a certain area such as conjuration, will we<br/>
get new spells such as summon food and water, etc.  If they decide to let us<br/>
have hybrid spells from other races, it seems to me like they should limit<br/>
the spells the wizard gets depending on which area of specialization he is<br/>
in.  If I wated to get SoW for example, I would have to train in the<br/>
specialization spell trait that is used when SoW is cast (alteration,<br/>
divination, etc.). This would allow us to get hybrid spells without making<br/>
us too powerful, and allow the wizard player to be able to be a more well<br/>
rounded profession rather than being so dependant on others to buff and<br/>
group with.  I don&#39;t know about you, but there are times when I am playing<br/>
and no one is online who wants to group with me.  This can be frustrating<br/>
cause we are not good at melee.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents worth.</div>
