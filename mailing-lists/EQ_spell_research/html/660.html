<b>Subject:</b> Necros use runes right? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-976017734">Just made level 16 with my necromancer, Flarfian and am interested in<br/>
researching Banshee Aura.  Checking the neat site:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mythiran.com/">http://www.mythiran.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
and viewing this file:<br/>

I see the following text:<br/>
This is the COMPLETE list of research spells and ingredients for necros.<br/>
This list is courtesy of Azrael. Thanks Az. It is supposed to be a complete<br/>
list and all ingredients listed are Words. Also, the Az had a few comments<br/>
and disclaimers to add:<br/>
<br/>
I was under the impression that necros use Runes for their research<br/>
components but this page specifies all the components will be Words.  Then<br/>
down below in the Banshee Aura spell it lists Derivation and Eradication.<br/>
Is this correct?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in going through the motions of learning the languages to<br/>
read the recipe books but want to at least know I&#39;m on the right path before<br/>
wasting components.<br/>
<br/>
PS  I&#39;m on the Povar server and would be interested in buying either of the<br/>
components needs or a finished scroll  8)  Also, I would be happy to grab<br/>
any of the enchant metal scrolls from Neriak if there are enchanters who<br/>
can&#39;t get in there.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
