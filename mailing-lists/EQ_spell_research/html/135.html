<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812175127">As far as I can determine, The Wizard&#39;s Canon, Doctrine of Wizardry, and Ispor&#39;s Enlightenment III are written in Old Eurdin.  Ispor&#39;s Enlightenment IV however is in Elder Tier&#39;Dal.  As for the books written in Elder Elvish, Combine, and Dragon, those are quest books that can&#39;t be bought from the merchants, but rather found through quests  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, so far as I&#39;ve been able to determine, Wizards only use Runes for their research.<br/>

  I know the Wizard&#39;s Canon (I guess some are calling this the first book...) is Old Erudian.  Is the Doctrine of Wizardry written in Elder Elvish or Tier&#39;Dal?   I&#39;ve heard there are four books yet you list 5 languages that you know or are working on.  Are there more than four books?  I really wish you were on my server. I&#39;d happily pay 5 plat to learn those languages.  Also, do wizards need ONLY runes?  <br/>
   <br/>
  Can anyone on the Karana server teach me other languages?  I&#39;ll pay/trade for them... (I already know Old Erudian to excellent.  I also have several non-rune reseach components I would gladly trade providing I dont need them myself.) </span></blockquote></div>
