<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942066829">Only good as a light source. It is verants way of heading letting us know<br/>
they dont like for the players to be able to easily see what creatures have<br/>
loot. Players just watched the wisps and only attacked the ones that cast a<br/>
light source, thus being assured of loot, being either a greater or normal<br/>
lightstone.<br/>
<br/>
The burned out stone is much like the summoned light source one of the<br/>
caster classes casts. It cant be traded, dropped, or sold. And it will<br/>
vanish when you log. This keeps ALL wisp type creatures throwing a glowing<br/>
light around them so you are forced to hunt them all again and hope for<br/>
luck.</div>
