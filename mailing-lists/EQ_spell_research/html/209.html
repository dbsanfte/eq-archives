Now that our minds are clear, here is what I have noticed.<br/>
If you find it displeasing, please choose to ignore it.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that skill increases (as well as many things)<br/>
are very &quot;streaky&quot;. I rarely have a skill increase one<br/>
point and then not increase again for a long time. I usually<br/>
get my skill increases in bunches of 3 or 4, actually.<br/>
On the flip side of this, the times between these &quot;good&quot;<br/>
streaks are marked with very long times of &quot;bad&quot; streaks.<br/>
<br/>
I would tend to agree to the theory that you had a<br/>
particularly unlucky &quot;streak&quot; before you logged out<br/>
and then logged back in. But that&#39;s just me.<br/>
Then again, maybe Verant programmed in a good day / bad day<br/>
routine that determined how good a day you would have when<br/>
you log in. I find the thought rather amusing, but ...</div>
