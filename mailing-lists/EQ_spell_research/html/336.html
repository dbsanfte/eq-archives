<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887394453">This was totaly uncalled for, and it is you who does not have the forsight<br/>
of what makes a good game. I think DOOM, or Street Fighter would better fit<br/>
your needs.<br/>
<br/>
I am in agreement that if level 16 players can get together to take out<br/>
griffons or Giants, AND that group of  players where all of one class then<br/>
this is where Verant needs to open it&#39;s eyes and make changes.<br/>
<br/>
Your anology of kids with swords against a man is rather poor. I think a<br/>
better anology would be to take your same 6 kids and put them up against a<br/>
grizzly bear. See how long they last then. Put them up against true killing<br/>
machines such as fantasy Giants and Griffons, use real life Elephants,<br/>
Lions, etc and they wouldnt stand a chance.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, Verant is making poor choices right now in curtailing certain<br/>
aspects of the enchanter class cause they fear it is too powerful. In doing<br/>
so they enter an endless spiral where now other classes are the powerful one<br/>
and must be changed. They need to find a better way at ballancing the game<br/>
then chopping away at abilities because a certain spell is very helpful.<br/>
Where that the case then Druids should lose SOW, Magicians should lose thier<br/>
destructive spells, Warriors should start missing all the time, Rangers<br/>
getter lesser tracking, Clerics get pathetic healing... I mean cmon..no<br/>
other class is being chopped the way we are.<br/>
<br/>
And before anyone mentions this about being off topic, think again. The<br/>
changes going on right now in lessening the Enchanter class is far beyond<br/>
call. people are dropping this class like hot potatos. In time skills for<br/>
researching will be un-needed as no one will be playing this class, and/or<br/>
it will simply be removed from the character creation list. We are the<br/>
poorest solo class of the entire genere of classes. Pets that are levels<br/>
below us on the average, spells that fizzle, or are broken easily, no damage<br/>
spells to even come close to those who are lower level than us in other<br/>
classes. A total confustion in trying to explain to party member to not use<br/>
tactics that stun on whirled creatures or the stun will be broken.<br/>
<br/>
We have no in game books that i know of on HOW to research, wizards have<br/>
volumes to find. This class is being totaly ruined and people need to start<br/>
stepping forward and letting Verant know that this class is being destroyed.<br/>
And the answer is NOT to ask to be able to take a hill giant out at level<br/>
16, but to regain the whole definition of Enchanter back as a boon to a<br/>
group, not a drag on a group.<br/>
<br/>
We have the ability to enchant jewelry, but the costs are so high in making<br/>
something useful, that no player will pay it. We cant even enchant armor and<br/>
weapons LET ALONE make them as our very class desription describes. Our<br/>
buffs are lesser versions of just about every other race, and the duration<br/>
and cost of our anti-buff spells is a cheat on the very ability of the<br/>
Enchanter Class.<br/>
<br/>
Having FUN is simply not being able to go out and pound on anything in your<br/>
path. Having fun is solving a problem thru the use of skills at your<br/>
disposal. But at the moment, the skills at our disposal are being ruined<br/>
cause a few power-gamers reached the impossible 50th level before they where<br/>
suppose to. This has Verrant in chaos. So in their maddened state they<br/>
change what should have been left alone, and leave alone what should be<br/>
changed.<br/>
<br/>
Bah..i&#39;ve said enough. I just had to put my 2 coppers worth in towards this<br/>
message. There is enough ignorance going on in ballancing the game without<br/>
stuff like this helping to turn the game into one big slug fest.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;  Oh my god I think I&#39;m haveing a coniption (Must.... control.. Fist of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>....DEATH!) Why on earth (or Norrath for that matter) would you support<br/>
Verant makeing it even harder for people to advance and have fun. By saying<br/>
something as innane and anal as that, you stifle team work and the desire<br/>
and adventure to try something more. To be dareing & adventurious is that<br/>
not what it&#39;s all about? People like you who condone such changes that<br/>
FURTHER hamper the fun, ease, and playabilty for gamers should be forced to<br/>
play Smurf warriors in Splitpaw or something. See, what retarted petty<br/>
people like you forget is WE PAY VERANT&#39;S BILLS. and thus the game should be<br/>
free of the kind of asinine restrictions that you would have further placed<br/>
upon the game. Futher more, you say that it&#39;s unreasonable that a party of<br/>
18-20th level char take down a level 30 creature?!?!?! IDIOT!, If your a<br/>
grown man (which I highly doubt) and 6 trained 12 yr olds come at you with<br/>
sharpened Katanas (not to me!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;ntion SPELLS!) they would kill you even if you did have a sword you would<br/>
 </span></blockquote>be swarmed and KILLED, as would a lion or even bear sure 1 or 2 may die (as<br/>
char commonly do in the aformentioned sitiuation. but the higher level<br/>
tougher creature WOULD DIE!. So take your petty, anal, Triffling mentality,<br/>
that would have us all struggleing even more for the modest exp we can<br/>
already just barely gain, To Hell (or Lavastorm in a pinch) and DIE!<br/>
