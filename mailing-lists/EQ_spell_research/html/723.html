&gt; Subject: Unknown Words<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have some questions about some words if any of you know the answers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.  I have about 7 words of Dominion but one of them won&#39;t stack with<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; rest?  Is this bug from a word from before the stacking patch or is<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt; some other use for a non stacking word?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes this is a leftover bug from the stacking patch.  However, check to see<br/>
if the non-stacking word would sell for more at the vendor then the<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2. I have Words of Pacification and Words of Derivation.  Can someone<br/>
&gt; tell<br/>
&gt; me what spells these are for?  I looked all over a few sites that have<br/>
&gt; research info and couldn&#39;t find either of these words listed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Words of Pacification is a necro research word [ source:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mythiran.everquest.gamestats.com/">http://mythiran.everquest.gamestats.com/</a> ] I don&#39;t know about the<br/>
Derivation one though (I have it too).<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3.  I have a Velishouls Tome Faded Page but it dosen&#39;t have a page<br/>
&gt; number<br/>
&gt; associated with it.  I noticed on the lists that there are 2 versions of<br/>
&gt; Faded pages for Velishouls Tome.  One a page 16 and one a page 108. <br/>
&gt; Does<br/>
&gt; anyone know which version of the Faded page I have if it has no page<br/>
&gt; number?<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try casting identify on the page - perhaps that will help.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4.  I have Words of the Sentient but there appear to be two different<br/>
&gt; types<br/>
&gt; one says &quot;A.... the other B....   (I put dots in to signifify that I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; remember the rest of the word.  But these A and B words are in<br/>
&gt; parenthesies<br/>
&gt; after the name of the Page.  Any clue what each is for?  I know Words of<br/>
&gt; the Sentient are used for the Necro spell Restless Bones and Intensify<br/>
&gt; Death.  I assume one type is for each spell.  Can someone tell me which<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; which?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Restless Bones uses the Azia word and Intesify Death uses the B... word.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Its amazing the stuff you find when you start sorting all your junk in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; bank :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hehe - yes I know the feeling - I still have a lot of old lore items that<br/>
are now no-drop in the bank that I haven&#39;t removed since I don&#39;t want to<br/>
carry them around with me.<br/>
