&gt; I&#39;ve heard rumors that it&#39;s possible for a wizard, through research, to<br/>
&gt; learn spells that would otherwise be available only to other classes.  For<br/>
&gt; example, I am hoping this is the case with my Wizard, I want to learn SoW<br/>
&gt; desperately (don&#39;t we all?).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; SOE needs to do a better job of explaining research. ;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is no cross class learning of spells, unfortunatly.  A wizard can only<br/>
learn the spells of destruction... a necromancer.. only the spells of death<br/>
and decay... and so on.<br/>
<br/>
There are rumors, that there are spells that each of the mage classes get<br/>
that ARE the same.  But each must still research them differently to get<br/>
those spells.<br/>
