<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323024906">You can gain skill even without having someone higher than you.  You just<br/>
need TIME, and lots of it.  The trick is to spam, zone, spam, zone, spam,<br/>
zone.  You will get 1-2 increases per 3-4 zones.  It works and I can<br/>
confirm it since I now have a Below Average skill in Old Erudite raised<br/>
from Very Bad.<br/>

&gt;This is my experience in languages.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1. You must be grouped with whom you are learning.<br/>
&gt;2. He/She must have greater skill than you.<br/>
&gt;3. You must talk in /gsay for it to increase your<br/>
&gt;level.(Never raised my skill with /say /tell or /shout).<br/>
&gt;4. As for skills being allowed even after not meeting the<br/>
&gt;creature. I think that certain ones can be learned just<br/>
&gt;because of your level.  After I level up I am sure to visit<br/>
&gt;my guildmaster and he has one or two languages for me to<br/>
&gt;learn.  Otherwise I would know Sphinx, and Gryphon, and Hill<br/>
&gt;giant allready...hehe.<br/>
