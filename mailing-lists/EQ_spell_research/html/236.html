your spells?<br/>

&gt; Hallo,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just to clarify on two points be discussed here:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. You can only research spells of your class, this comes from GZ, the<br/>
arch<br/>
&gt; mage of magick in EQ, so you should accept it as the gospel in regards to<br/>
&gt; this question on research.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. When you put one point into research at level 16 you actually get 16<br/>
&gt; points, that is why you don&#39;t see a skill increase for 2-15 because you<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; already at 16. This only works on a skill you have a zero in, any skill<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; has a zero gets the # of points = to your current level, so if you get a<br/>
new<br/>
&gt; langague option that you have a zero skill in you will get an equal amount<br/>
&gt; of points equal to your current level, so it&#39;s best to wait to level 20 to<br/>
&gt; put your points into research/langauges you have zero skill in since<br/>
you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; get 20 points for your one points instead of 16.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have no idea if you can research a spell for your class and sell it to<br/>
&gt; another member of your class, would be nice to know as I plan to use<br/>
&gt; research as money making skill as I know many people see research as a<br/>
&gt; headache and would gladly pay a big surcharge so as to avoid learning four<br/>
&gt; different languages and searching high and low for components.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; qq<br/>
