&gt; Words of Tyranny<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a Magician Word, so all you necromancers can forget this one (Also THE most common) - To the seller...better off<br/>
selling it to the shops.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Words of Spirt<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This word is for Necromancers - But is also Common. (I pay 1pp for ANY word on my server but have no clue on yours.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Words of Sentinent<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This word is slightly less common, but by no means rare. Again 1pp.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 2x Wooden Totem<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These things are completely worthless...except that they sell for a plat to a vendor...hehe<br/>
Unfortunatly +5 mana is really not very good...better off getting a Skull of Jhen&#39;Tra.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I noticed that one of the &quot;words&quot; isn&#39;t stackalble, so I assumed it was rare.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is not the case...just another case of Verant saying &quot;Oops&quot;. Many of the Words are unstackable...you will see this in<br/>
the future. (Why all the rocks stack, but not all the pieces of paper is beyond my logic.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But average price would be nice to hear about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again I pay no more than 1 plat for words.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
