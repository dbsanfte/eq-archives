&gt;  As for mages and necro words looking different, I agree it&#39;s a bit<br/>
&gt;  confusing. I *think* (but am not sure at all) that mage words are<br/>
&gt;  stackable and necro words aren&#39;t. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope.  As A necro I can tell you there are both stackable and non-stackable <br/>
for necros.  (not sure why this is...) so that is not the key.  It is just a <br/>
matter of figuring it out.  And maybe there is even some crossover (maybe <br/>
words of Dominion... the most common word I have found.  I have 14 of them, <br/>
glad they stack!)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Either that or they forgot to make some<br/>
&gt;  words stackable and those I checked matched that rule.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do wish they made them all stackable!  I have been on a long quest for <br/>
handmade backpacks because of that... need all 70 slots in my locker to hold <br/>
words. (one slot for the book)<br/>
