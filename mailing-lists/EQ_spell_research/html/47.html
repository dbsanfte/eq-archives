&gt; I used to think this was the case too, but my ranger friend has<br/>

&gt; practice into it.  Beats me how it happened.  I bet it will take a lot<br/>

Barbarian up to excellent without spending a single practice point in them<br/>
(actually, those languages aren&#39;t available at my guild). The first skill<br/>
point is not that long to obtain, not longer than the others really, I<br/>
think it&#39;s a waste of practice to actually train in languages, except if<br/>
you can&#39;t find anybody who speaks the language.</div>
