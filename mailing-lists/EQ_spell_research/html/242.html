<div id="ygrps-yiv-166968809">Ok..what did I do wrong?<br/>
<br/>
I am 17th Level Enchanter. Been finding and trading for the Pages of<br/>
Grimiore.  I have my Old Eradin up to Average. and i have the book of<br/>
Ancient Restoration. I took 2 parts of page 26, a right side torn page, and<br/>
a left side torn page, both where page 26... I put them into the Restoration<br/>
Book, hit combine and get a message something like &#39;These items do not<br/>
combine to make anything&#39; (or somesuch message) .. this leads me to believe<br/>
i have done something wrong or i would have gotten a &#39;your skill is not good<br/>
enough&#39; type of message.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine has had the same problem, and states that he has tried<br/>
different combinations of pages like both the same side of same page number,<br/>
etc ..<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone help me out by telling me the propper procedure? Thus far I have<br/>
found nothing in the game at all that would reveal how to use the Book of<br/>
Ancient Restoration, or how to combine the pages into full sheets. I am<br/>
under the impression that once the pages are combined and if the attempt<br/>
succeeds your skill I&#39;ll end  up with a spell scroll. Perhaps I&#39;m wrong in<br/>
my assumption? Any help would be appreciated.</div>
