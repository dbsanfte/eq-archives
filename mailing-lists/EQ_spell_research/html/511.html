 </span></blockquote>According to a message that was posted on the Magicians ONElist, relayed by<br/>
the Guy that does the spells for EQ. (sorry I forgot his name).  There are<br/>
spells that can not be bought for all classes.  Whos to say that they are<br/>
listed in those books.  He did say that once the mysterious spells were<br/>
discovered by  many others they may eventually become sold on vendors.  He<br/>
also said that they did some pretty nice things.  I am assuming that it<br/>
works this way for all classes and not just magicians.<br/>
