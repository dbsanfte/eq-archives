<br/>
What we have found is that it is easy to get both people up to the same level <br/>
in a language, no matter what the level is.<br/>
<br/>
Then... one person will learn two steps in a language (or both one... it <br/>
seems to be a bit random, though it tends to be more common that one person <br/>
will learn two)<br/>
<br/>
Then you zone, and the other person will learn two, etc... on and on.  So it <br/>
is slow when both people are low on the skill... but it does happen :)<br/>
