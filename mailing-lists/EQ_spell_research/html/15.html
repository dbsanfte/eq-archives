<div id="ygrps-yiv-95418927">Hey there, folks..<br/>
<br/>
Looking for some info..  I was fighting a creature and pulled off a scroll looking object called Words of Quivering -- all classes and races, no way to read or scribe it.  The vendors would buy it for several plats, I think it may be a research component, any ideas?<br/>
