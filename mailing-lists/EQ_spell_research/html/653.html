<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027318719">First of all, this is starting to get a BIT off topic.  Other than that I<br/>
will answer your question.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I searched through the game files for any info on the equipment in<br/>
the game and couldn&#39;t find any at all.  I will try again sometime soon, but<br/>
it didn&#39;t look very promising.  As for decoding the layout of the zones, it<br/>
is my believe that the actual structure of the zones is downloaded to your<br/>
computer as you zone, and only the graphics and physics model are actually<br/>
stored locally.<br/>
