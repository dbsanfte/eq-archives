<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-354128996">There have been many more posts after I said I would stop posting on this <br/>
subject.  Do not think I am ignoring any of you, or that your posts aren&#39;t <br/>
getting to one list ... they are, I just needed to end that thread, it was <br/>
starting to get to the point it was not civil.<br/>
<br/>
To all you young wizards who might have been scared away from your class, do <br/>
not take the one man&#39;s opinion on them, make your own opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I will not tell you it is easy, you have the lowest health in the game, and <br/>
no pet ... which makes life difficult (I don&#39;t think it is possible to get an <br/>
&quot;easy&quot; rating as a wizard)  But in a group... you are the prime finisher of <br/>
monsters.<br/>
<br/>
The many posts I have gotten say that other people have not had as bad an <br/>
experience as the previous poster.  Many of them are doing more damage than <br/>
him, and not being resisted as often as he says (except on reds!), and <br/>
casting faster than him.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the many posts on this.<br/>
<br/>
