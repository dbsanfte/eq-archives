<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-693203270">A high level aquaintence insisted I buy a rare research item from him,<br/>
so I bought Ice of Velious for 31 plat. Anyone know what it&#39;s for? I also<br/>
was given Eye of Serlious (something like that) and have no idea what it&#39;s<br/>
for. Both of the items became stackable after the patch so I assume they are<br/>
research items.<br/>
<br/>
    Has anyone found a good use for learning different languages? With most<br/>
of the books being translated online, it seems the only reason to learn a<br/>
different language is for when you get a rare research formula book, if they<br/>
exist.<br/>
