&gt; You might want to try the Aviak Island in the Ocean of Tears. It&#39;s at<br/>
&gt; roughly 2300,4300 -- way off Stormbreaker&#39;s path, so you&#39;ll have to swim<br/>
&gt; there or take a canoe. The Aviaks there are tougher than what&#39;s in South<br/>
&gt; Karana, but should still very easy for a level 22 character like yourself, I<br/>
&gt; would think.<br/>

talons (look like chicken feet).<br/>
<br/>
And the aviaks there are actually NOT tougher than<br/>
the ones in South Karana. The toughest aviak<br/>
on the island is much weaker than the tougher<br/>
aviak in South Karana.</div>
