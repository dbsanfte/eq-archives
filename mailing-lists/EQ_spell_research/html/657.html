<div id="ygrps-yiv-606828512">has anyone else noticed the extra wizard portals lying around?  i&#39;ve<br/>
been just stumbling upon them left and right.  one of my orignal<br/>
complaints about the wizard class is that we&#39;re outmatched by druid&#39;s<br/>
teleportation spells...but i&#39;ve seen portal points in south ro and south<br/>
karana..i&#39;d imagine that there&#39;s one in nearly every area just waiting<br/>
to be discovered via questing or perhaps experimentation with runes.  i<br/>
personally am considering getting some extra cash together and visiting<br/>
the vendor in sro that gives out scrolls for 5pp.  sure i may not get<br/>
anything, but i figure that i at least have a chance at getting<br/>
something useful.  would be neat to get a &quot;portal: sro&quot; or some such.<br/>
