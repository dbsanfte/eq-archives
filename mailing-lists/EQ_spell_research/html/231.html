<div id="ygrps-yiv-566818732">Aviaks and Centaurs can be found in South Karana. Someone told me that a<br/>
GM told them you could NOT put the staff and skull together. Just a tip for<br/>
people who don&#39;t know about this skull, do NOT us a 2H Blunt weapon<br/>
throughout the game. I had 67 in 2H blunt when I got my skull, and I had to<br/>
switch to piercing (which is now 14, blah). Anyone found Aviak Feathers yet?<br/>
We killed a whole bunch of Aviaks yesterday and got none.<br/>

    Also, please try to keep the messages on topic. If you just have to send<br/>
a &quot;my opinion is cooler than yours&quot; email, make it personal.<br/>
