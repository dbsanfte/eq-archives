<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580942135">Hello Lord Ryal.  My name is Flarfian a level 16 (soon to be 17) dark elf<br/>
necromancer.  I would be a higher level but I am interested in other<br/>
characters as well and so have a few medium level characters.  I enjoy<br/>
helping people out but am finding it harder to get my friends to play the<br/>
same times as me so I&#39;m having difficulty getting a good group together.<br/>
Sure, I&#39;ve found nice strangers but a good team I can count on would be<br/>
nice.<br/>
 <br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Shawn A.<br/>
 <br/>
Flarfian, level 16 dark elf necromancer<br/>
Darmok, level 15 troll shaman<br/>
Bertt, level 12 barbarian warrior<br/>
Azara, level 8 high elf enchanter (with 40+ skill in jewelcraft)<br/>
Sentinall, level 9 dark elf wizard<br/>
Lalali, level 9 human bard<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Additionally I got my wife to play (hehe this is a smart thing to do) and<br/>
she is a level 16 rogue.<br/>
