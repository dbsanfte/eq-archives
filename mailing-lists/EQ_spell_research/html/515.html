<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715313176">I too noticed that the Rune of Velious seemed to be an<br/>
odd rune, that was not used in any spell creation.<br/>
Many of us have been aware the Fire Spiral of Al&#39;Kabor<br/>
requires 2 runes, Nagafen and Al&#39;Kabor, and that this<br/>
spell is bugged with research, and fails to combine.<br/>
Well, I decided to take a chance, and combined the<br/>
Al&#39;Kabor with Velious. Bingo, I&#39;m now the proud owner<br/>
of the Fire Spiral of Al&#39;Kabor spell. :)<br/>
<br/>
I also had Energy Storm fail last night, didn&#39;t<br/>
combine properly. I used the last of the runes needed,<br/>
or I would have tried switching Velious into that mix<br/>
too.<br/>
