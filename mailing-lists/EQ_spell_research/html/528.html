<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035823728">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on the Karana server and I&#39;m having a very hard time find these two<br/>
runes<br/>
Rune of Presence and Rune of Disassociation. I need those two runes to make<br/>
the spell Cast Force. I was able to find one rune in the dwarf city someone<br/>
sold it to a store keep it seems. But I could&#39;nt find the other finally a<br/>
friend bought one from a guy in unrest. I tried to combine the spells and I<br/>
failed. So if someone out there can help me get these runes and perhaps tell<br/>
me what level you need to be to combine I would be most happy. I know of<br/>
another wizard that tried it at a skill level of 30 and failed also. At this<br/>
point I&#39;m kinda looking to buy the spell from someone if they can make it<br/>
for me. Thanks for your time.</div>
