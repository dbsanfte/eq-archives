<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340403010">The Handmade backpack is created by combining a backpack patern and a High<br/>
Quality Bear SKIN, not a plet.  You can find the paterns at the first inn<br/>
in north ro comming from freeport.  For the skins that you need.  Your<br/>
going to have to kill ALOT of bears, and I mean ALOT.  I follow the ONEList<br/>
for tailors as well.  Generally finding one High Quality Bear SKIN in a<br/>
full day of killing bears is doing pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
At a Tailoring skill of 30, you can expect to succede about 1 in 5.  At a<br/>
skill of 60 you should get success about 50% of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so off topic I just wanted to get it answerd and gone.  If<br/>
you have more specific questions please direct them to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EQ_Tailors@onelist.com">EQ_Tailors@onelist.com</a><br/>
