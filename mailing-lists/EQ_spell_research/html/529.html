<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982170635">A found an NPC wondering around outside of Freeport&#39;s south gate. He had a <br/>
title, Lord. And although I can&#39;t remember exactly what his name was, I know <br/>
he had only a first name any it started with an &quot;L&quot;. He didn&#39;t respond to my <br/>
hails, and I considered him to be an easy kill. So I killed him. As loot, I <br/>
got a &quot;Locked Book&quot;. I had another player cast Identify on it, and it turns <br/>
out to be his spell book. Does anyone know what I can do with this? Is it a <br/>
research book? How can I unlock it? Please help.<br/>
