&gt; 3. I couldn&#39;t train in research past 1 pt. when I hit 16th, haven&#39;t trained<br/>
&gt; since then. Does this mean we have to spend numerous pieces of plat to<br/>
&gt; improve this skill?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I too trained my first point at 16 and was refused further training at each new level at 19 I had the runes to<br/>
&gt; fashion 2 spells ( 1 rune given 3 runes found - 2 in Lake Rathe ) I attempted first to make pillar of fire and<br/>
&gt; blew my runes being told I did not have the skill to combine them - I spoke with a local wizard he suggested<br/>
&gt; just bad luck - I put my next two runes into my lexicon hit combine - poof congratulations you have become<br/>
&gt; better at resarch and have created something new - skill rose to 17 in one successfull attempt - further<br/>
&gt; discussions with the wizard aforementioned reveals after succesfully making many runes his skill is up to 19 so<br/>
&gt; dont expect that large increase to happen more than once - scribing project lightning a now happy wiz knows it<br/>
&gt; works and can be done.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would not spend any money training the skill further unless you rather spend to train and reduce the risk of<br/>
blowing up your runes - personally I am saving a few for specialization skill which as yet methinks<br/>
unimplemented.<br/>
