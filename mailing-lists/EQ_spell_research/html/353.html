Why on earth (or Norrath for that matter) would you support Verant makeing it even harder for people to advance and have fun. By saying something as innane and anal as that, you stifle team work and the desire and adventure to try something more. To be dareing & adventurious is that not what it&#39;s all about?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First off, settle down. You do yourself and your argument a disservice getting all bent out of shape simply because you disagree with my view on the issue. I have nothing against team work and trying something more. I do prefer there to be limits on that however.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of your post I won&#39;t even bother responding to. A bit too much verbal vomiting, that I have no desire to wade through. In short, it offers nothing to the discussion and thus only need be ignored.<br/>
