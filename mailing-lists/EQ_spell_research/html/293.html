&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, you can camp with the Testament.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have also have yet to travel to Highpass.  However, I have seen an NPC in<br/>
&gt; surefall (at the entrance) with the first name Ran.  I will be traveling to<br/>
&gt; Highpass soon (16th level Wizard) and will keep you up dated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is probably only a quest, and not research related.. i am sorry if it<br/>
&gt; is not and have clogged your mailboxes. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have gone on the same quest.  A Paladin (npc)in Erudin asks you to go on<br/>
&gt; quest to find the Teatamnet of Vanear.<br/>
&gt; &gt; An enchantress in Erudin talks to you about her brother Moodoro Findhorn.<br/>
&gt; How he had been slated for execution for selling the magical water of the<br/>
&gt; vasty deep to a npc in Qeynos at Crow&#39;s Inn called Flynn. She wants you to<br/>
&gt; find Flynn and Moodoro and get the water, then she will poison it and you<br/>
&gt; return it to Flynn.  (haven&#39;t done this quest yet fully though, because I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t get Flynn to talk to me.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyhow, sorry about the side tangent but,  You locate Moodoro in Qeynos.<br/>
&gt; When you ask him about the Testamnet of Vanear he will sell it to you for<br/>
&gt; 2gp and change.  Thus far I have come as well and need to venture to High<br/>
&gt; Hold in search of the holder of the 2 pages Ran the Librarian.  Seeing as<br/>
&gt; how everyone and their dog talks about getting slaughtered when they go to<br/>
&gt; High Hold, I don&#39;t think I will be finishing this quest for at least a<br/>
&gt; couple more lvls.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Although, I am very interested to see how this Quest turns out, and if you<br/>
&gt; can use the Testament for any other purpose than delivering it back to the<br/>
&gt; Paladin in Erudin.  It would be great if it allowed you some new spells or<br/>
&gt; something.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I do think though, if you camp that the Testament will disappear from your<br/>
&gt; inventory (correct me if I am wrong).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If anyone else has more info on this topic I would be greatly thankful.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I have acquired a book called the Testament of Vanear as part of a<br/>
&gt; quest.  It is<br/>
&gt; &gt;   missing two pages which a NPC named Ran (Librarian in High Hold)<br/>
&gt; supposedly<br/>
&gt; &gt;   stole.  It appears that if these two pages are acquired and combined in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Testament that you will get a working copy of the Testament of Vanear.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I was wondering if this was a book for research, or it had another<br/>
&gt; purpose.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Thanks in advance.<br/>
