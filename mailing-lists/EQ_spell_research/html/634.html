&gt;Also, anyone else notice that FLARE no longer works?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Looking at the spell Flare using the Spell program I wrote, I noticed that<br/>
it no longer has a target type.  So you can&#39;t target the spell.  My guess<br/>
is that Verant just screwed it up.  I will email them about it, if we want<br/>
to get their attention, we could all do it.  It looks to me like it would<br/>
be a VERY easy fix, assuming the server doesn&#39;t have to be modified as<br/>
well.  It is a single byte in the file that needs to be changed.<br/>

Whooo hooo. FINALLY someone else who even acknowledges that it&#39;s broken ;)   The typical response i get from people is... Flare? why even bother, it&#39;s a useless spell.... well personally i LIKE that spell (handy for leading friends to you in large outdoor zones)   Not to mention that 4th of July is coming up.. where would we all be without a little fireworks :) <br/>
