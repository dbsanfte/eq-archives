<b>Subject:</b> Item placement in research tomes <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-558760938">I am curious since someone mentioned earlier that the position<br/>
of items in the tomes has an effect on wheather the research is<br/>
successful<br/>
or not, is this information true? Can someone confirm this? (I&#39;ll be<br/>
careful with exact placement inside the research tomes anyway but I am<br/>
still curious) If this is true and you have to place the items in the<br/>
order they are listed from the recipes inside the research tome for the<br/>
spell to be correctly created, what is the slot ordering? I would assume<br/>
<br/>
(based on the way inventory slots work that it is something like:<br/>
  1  3<br/>
  2  4<br/>
Would be a great help if somone could help me out here, and save me<br/>
blowing a my supplys for my first research attempt (just made 16 as a<br/>
magician).<br/>
