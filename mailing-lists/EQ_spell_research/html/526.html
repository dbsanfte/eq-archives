&gt; Ok, not entirely on topic but does anyone know how you achieve<br/>
&gt; specialization once you hit 20th level?  I tried the trainer but nothing on<br/>
&gt; specialization even thought it was listed as a skill gained at 20th earlier<br/>
&gt; in the game.  Does it work?  Thanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; specialization has been removed from the game and MAY never be implemented due<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to game ballance issues so I am told by a GM - not the word MAY never is no a definate not going to happen. I have heard rumours in the coming weeks it may be reintroduced. It was never fully implemented and never worked when it was an option to<br/>
train in it yeilded no results.<br/>
