<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827615224"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Ok, not entirely on topic but does anyone know how you achieve<br/>
&gt; specialization once you hit 20th level?  I tried the trainer but nothing on<br/>
&gt; specialization even thought it was listed as a skill gained at 20th earlier<br/>
&gt; in the game.  Does it work?  Thanks.<br/>
