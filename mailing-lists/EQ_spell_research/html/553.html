<div id="ygrps-yiv-995527332">On top of not being altogether displeased with the class - it is rated moderate to difficult<br/>
btw to play a wiz we do get the most potential damage from casting and I have killed in duels players 2 levels up on me - enstill does not seem to me to be any better than root<br/>
however force shock is better direct damage than the level 24 ice shock spell but force shock requires a recovery period as ice does not that is the advantage also ice uses less<br/>
mana - also does a little less damage - and so far seems to me as my levels rise that spells<br/>
get resisted less and less - at 24 now force shock is resisted much less than it used to be<br/>
and root has become resonably reliable - enstill still seems to use too much mana for its<br/>
reliability imho.<br/>
<br/>
Also as a former fellow wizard mentioned aside from being the most magically damaging<br/>
class &lt; potentially we get travel as druids do but to the best of my knowledge we are the<br/>
only ones who can alter planes with a spell -- &gt;<br/>
<br/>
Research topics - cant seem to locate some cruicial runes for level 20 and 24 area effects<br/>
if any one has any to spare or would care to sell me the spells search me out.<br/>
