&gt; And I have done it with four languages that way, about one complete cycle, you teach on one side, zone, I teach, zone back takes a little over 3 mins and we only go up 2 points, you throw in interuptions, etc. and the fact some people take 50 seconds<br/>
&gt; to zone then you get 4 hours, we dont all have cable modems you know.<br/>
&gt; Not everyone zones in 15 seconds, ok.<br/>
