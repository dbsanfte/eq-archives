<div id="ygrps-yiv-253347089">Yes, plans are in the works for this very purpose, and more. The details are <br/>
being worked on now, but a &quot;guild&quot; or group of sorts will be soon forming on <br/>
Fennin, then branching out from there eventually. It has a very similar <br/>
premise to the Conclave of Wizardry from the Dragonlance series of novels. <br/>
(Not very original, but a very good premise nonetheless, amazing it is not <br/>
already in existence.) If you aren&#39;t familiar with the idea, it is basically <br/>
a gathering of all mages, bound together for the persuit of knowledge and <br/>
the sake of magic. Those who join the Conclave can be of any race and mage <br/>
class, (and currently in a guild). In fact, it is essential that all are <br/>
represented. The original idea was not to go official, to just create a <br/>
group for the sharing of knowledge (i.e. languages, research components <br/>
etc.), but going &quot;official&quot; may be in future plans. A web site is in the <br/>
works, all we need now are interested people, willing to join and/or <br/>
contribute their knowledge to the Conclave. (The Conclave is a working <br/>
title, which may or may not stick.) If anyone is interested, please mail me <br/>
personally at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bwgogol@...">bwgogol@...</a>. Any input and new ideas are gladly <br/>
welcomed.<br/>

Subject: [EQ_spell_research] Site for posting languages and spell recipes <br/>
fro the list...<br/>

<br/>
Does anyone on this list have any plans to summarize or compile some of the<br/>
knowledge from this list? Of course, this would range from sharing info to<br/>
spoilers. It would include:<br/>
	- Compiled list of learnable languages (perhaps with class and race cues,<br/>
such as DE gets at Lvl 20)<br/>
	- List of which components go with which classes<br/>
	- Index of what language certain book, tomes, grimoires, etc. are written<br/>
in<br/>
	- And of course spell recipes by class<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not volunteering (smile), just wondeirng if anyone has plans to put up<br/>
pages with some of this stuff or write pages for existing sites like eqss or<br/>
eqv?<br/>

spellcasting guild)<br/>
