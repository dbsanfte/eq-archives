<b>Subject:</b> Looking for spellcomponents <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-628892537">I play a level 29 Magician named Eldran on Cazic Thule. In order to do my<br/>
research I was looking for components.  The problem I encountered was that<br/>
the components needed are very rare which I think put Magicians at a<br/>
disadvantage when it comes to research. In all my travels I have not come<br/>
across a single spell component besides words. I think they should either<br/>
increase the spawn rate for these items or, which would be even better, put<br/>
a vendor, maybe a bit out of the way, into the game that sells these<br/>
components. Another suggestion I believe that should be considered is to<br/>
make the necro and mage words look different. I plan on starting a petition<br/>
towards this end and would apprerciate any hints or suggestions towards<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
PS: If anybody can give me a hint where to find these components or has some<br/>
to sell that would also be greatly appreciated.<br/>
