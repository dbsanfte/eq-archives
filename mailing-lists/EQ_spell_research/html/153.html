<div id="ygrps-yiv-602655660">This is correct they started fixing this in P4!  you can Right click onthe<br/>
spell and it will say &quot;Cannot use&quot; in the stats. then you look ar the<br/>
classes and LO! only enchanters can use it(yes I&#39;m a wizard...) however i<br/>
have heard that you will be able to create spels for other classes.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a tip from one of the level 27 wizards in my guild..just put 1 point<br/>
into research at each level over 16...then at level 20 if you wish..you can<br/>
spcialize in research..after that he gets a bit vauge...<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;m going to assume this is just a rumor.  I wouldn&#39;t see the point of<br/>
&gt; building another mage type except &gt;Wizard if this were true.  That would<br/>
&gt; kind of throw the balance of character classes off a bit.  Wizard&#39;s &gt;would<br/>
&gt; be everywhere!  I could be wrong.....<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Possibly a rumor, ... some basis on the rumor was my experience in Beta,<br/>
&gt; however this does not seem to be the case now. Was playing a 3rd level wiz<br/>
&gt; and accidently bought a magician spell. When i tried to scribe it I got<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; message &#39;This spell does not come available to you until level 32&#39; (or<br/>
&gt; something close to that).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I rechecked the spell stats and it was strictly Magician type. Recently i<br/>
&gt; tried the same thing (Playing an Enchanter) and bought a 1st level wiz<br/>
&gt; spell, but i did not recieve anything other than &#39;This spell cannot be<br/>
used<br/>
&gt; by your class&#39; .. so perhaps what i saw in beta has been ommited now. I<br/>
&gt; think the only way that different classes can use one another&#39;s spells is<br/>
&gt; ONLY if the same spell is available to different classes (Like Gate or<br/>
&gt; Invisibility)<br/>
