<b>Subject:</b> Re: Lil bit from an Enchanter <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083897212">I agree, there seem to be too few buff/debuff spells available for me right <br/>
now (L8).  It becomes a slight pain when I&#39;m fighting in BB, and sometimes <br/>
I&#39;ll barely make it alive out of a scuffle with a blue scrawny gnoll / <br/>
gnoll / patrolling gnoll.  I&#39;ve got all cloth armor, 2H worn great staff <br/>
that has about 120 attack, i&#39;m 135AC with my buffs, 145 HP with buffs.  The <br/>
problem with the &#39;pets&#39; I can understand, but being able to cast a L4 pet <br/>
inbetween enemy attacks, get the pet to taunt the attacker and have three <br/>
or four hits to high tail to a zone is an advantage.<br/>
<br/>
After playing my enchanter for a while, I&#39;ve come to the following <br/>
conclusion about enchanters:<br/>
<br/>
1) Difficult class to advance, especially solo.<br/>
2) Best in a group, sticking to the back.<br/>
3) Underappreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Only after I mentioned that I could do a combination of see invis / invis <br/>
did the group appreciate me a bit more (especially after large trains of <br/>
elite gnoll guards / gnoll commanders in BB).<br/>
<br/>
My stats are (If I remember correctly):<br/>
<br/>
STR 	60<br/>
CON	70<br/>
AGI 	70<br/>
DEX 	75<br/>
WIS 	83<br/>
INT 	122<br/>
CHA 	100<br/>
<br/>
So far I&#39;ve kept my skills to the following for monetary purposes (and, <br/>
come to find out, this has been a really good strategy):<br/>
<br/>
45 in Fletching (highest for L8)<br/>
31 in Jewelmaking<br/>
<br/>
Jewelmaking I would highly recommend to an enchanter, especially Dark Elf <br/>
(since the Enchant: Silver spell is in Neriak and, from what I&#39;ve heard, no <br/>
where else; if I&#39;m wrong, PLEASE tell me!).  Once the Dark Elf Enchanter <br/>
has the illusion spells, along with invisibility, there&#39;s no place that <br/>
character can&#39;t go (more or less).<br/>

not expected to do the offense like wizards, magicians or even necros, Our <br/>
prime directive is debuffing and buffing and we get some incredible spells. <br/>
Here are my rants.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;         2. Ok, i can understand perhaps them resisting our offensive dmg <br/>
 </span></blockquote>spells but how are we supposed to be a group debuffer if they resist all <br/>
our spells? Even after using tashan or tashanii which also have a tendency <br/>
to get resisted? Kinda makes us useless in that regard eh?<br/>
