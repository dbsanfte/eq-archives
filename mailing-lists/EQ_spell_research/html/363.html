&gt; This reply was NOT necessary...you are a jerk and should be removed from<br/>
&gt; this list...this is about spell research not flaming someone.  If you would<br/>
&gt; have actually read this post you you garner exactly what hes saying...the<br/>
&gt; spells should not have been able to go unresisted.  Have you ever played<br/>
&gt; dungeons and dragons?  What would happen if you had a group of 10 mid level<br/>
&gt; (15-20) characters and they went and fought the arch-magi lich from hell?<br/>
&gt; Well they would most likely run from the fear...die to the cold and get<br/>
&gt; eatin alive by his spells...sheesh get a life.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok on to the spell research:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My roommate just made 17th level and has failed his first few researches<br/>
&gt; (this cost some plat!)  Is there a list of runes a wizard can combine or<br/>
&gt; possibily a list of what spells to create?  Thanks!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m amazed you could get spells through on a Griffon or HG at that<br/>
&gt; &gt;level. Both of these are level 30+ monsters. Accordingly I wouldn&#39;t think a<br/>
&gt; &gt;level 18-20 group should be able to get one spell through. Certainly with<br/>
&gt; &gt;my Wizard if it&#39;s more that a couple levels higher than me I don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; &gt;bother casting as it will get resisted fully.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Unless I misread your post, I think it only prudent that Verant change<br/>
&gt; &gt;this. There&#39;s no way a group of 18-20 lvl players, regardless of class,<br/>
&gt; &gt;should be taking down monsters that are double their level. That&#39;s a tad<br/>
&gt; &gt;extreme.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;  Oh my god I think I&#39;m haveing a coniption (Must.... control.. Fist of<br/>
&gt; &gt;....DEATH!) Why on earth (or Norrath for that matter) would you support<br/>
&gt; &gt;Verant makeing it even harder for people to advance and have fun. By saying<br/>
&gt; &gt;something as innane and anal as that, you stifle team work and the desire<br/>
&gt; &gt;and adventure to try something more. To be dareing & adventurious is that<br/>
&gt; &gt;not what it&#39;s all about? People like you who condone such changes that<br/>
&gt; &gt;FURTHER hamper the fun, ease, and playabilty for gamers should be forced to<br/>
&gt; &gt;play Smurf warriors in Splitpaw or something. See, what retarted petty<br/>
&gt; &gt;people like you forget is WE PAY VERANT&#39;S BILLS. and thus the game should<br/>
&gt; &gt;be free of the kind of asinine restrictions that you would have further<br/>
&gt; &gt;placed upon the game. Futher more, you say that it&#39;s unreasonable that a<br/>
&gt; &gt;party of 18-20th level char take down a level 30 creature?!?!?! IDIOT!, If<br/>
&gt; &gt;your a grown man (which I highly doubt) and 6 trained 12 yr olds come at<br/>
&gt; &gt;you with sharpened Katanas (not to me!<br/>
&gt; &gt;ntion SPELLS!) they would kill you even if you did have a sword you would<br/>
&gt; &gt;be swarmed and KILLED, as would a lion or even bear sure 1 or 2 may die (as<br/>
&gt; &gt;char commonly do in the aformentioned sitiuation. but the higher level<br/>
&gt; &gt;tougher creature WOULD DIE!. So take your petty, anal, Triffling mentality,<br/>
&gt; &gt;that would have us all struggleing even more for the modest exp we can<br/>
&gt; &gt;already just barely gain, To Hell (or Lavastorm in a pinch) and DIE!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;We need not further restrictions but, benefits to make it more fun,<br/>
