<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899690921">I agree that crossing of spells from one class to another is a terrible<br/>
idea. We all new when we started a Wizard that we had the most powerful<br/>
offensive spells in the game. We gave up the other benefits to gain that<br/>
one. I don&#39;t want some other class being able to learn my big damage spells<br/>
any more than i think we should learn theirs. Keep in mind this would have<br/>
to work both ways and if ye have an enchanter or Necro that can damage as<br/>
much as a Wizard why have a Wizard at all??  You have to take the weakness<br/>
with the Strength. start another char to play when no one else is online on<br/>
that can solo easier.  I started a Monk and a troll Shaman to play when no<br/>
one is around to group with and have a blast with those guys. Lets keep<br/>
classes unique thats what makes it fun playing different classes is that you<br/>
have to play each one different.<br/>
<br/>
just my thoughts...<br/>

&gt; &gt; I hear that when Specialization come in that we will be able to cast the<br/>
&gt; &gt; spell using less mana depending on what we are specializing in. That<br/>
being<br/>
&gt; &gt; the case, If we specialize in a certain area such as conjuration, will<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; &gt; get new spells such as summon food and water, etc.  If they decide to<br/>
let us<br/>
&gt; &gt; have hybrid spells from other races, it seems to me like they should<br/>
limit<br/>
&gt; &gt; the spells the wizard gets depending on which area of specialization he<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt; in.  If I wated to get SoW for example, I would have to train in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; specialization spell trait that is used when SoW is cast (alteration,<br/>
&gt; &gt; divination, etc.). This would allow us to get hybrid spells without<br/>
making<br/>
&gt; &gt; us too powerful, and allow the wizard player to be able to be a more<br/>
well<br/>
&gt; &gt; rounded profession rather than being so dependant on others to buff and<br/>
&gt; &gt; group with.  I don&#39;t know about you, but there are times when I am<br/>
playing<br/>
&gt; &gt; and no one is online who wants to group with me.  This can be<br/>
frustrating<br/>
&gt; &gt; cause we are not good at melee.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just my two cents worth.<br/>
