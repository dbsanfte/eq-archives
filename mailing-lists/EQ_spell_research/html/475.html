<div id="ygrps-yiv-704685830">Ok does anyone know what language is required to read Ipsor&#39;s Enlightenment<br/>
IV (or maybe its V I forget but its the only other one sold in Freeport)<br/>
<br/>
I am now Excelent in 23 languages.  Among them are<br/>
Old Erudin, Elder Elvish, Kobold (Elder Teir&#39;Dal), Giant Toung (Combine<br/>
Toung), and Dragon.<br/>
Basically I am excelent in every language I have found so far.  All 23 but<br/>
I still cant read that book.  Do I need to work each language up to<br/>
&quot;Master&quot; or is there another Language out there that no one knows about yet?<br/>
<br/>
Long Live the Brotherhood,<br/>
