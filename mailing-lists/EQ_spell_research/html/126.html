<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296622696">Would it be too much to ask that people not post<br/>
messages to this list using anything other than<br/>
plain text? This is a pretty standard request on<br/>
all the mailing lists that I have seen, and it<br/>
certainly shouldn&#39;t be too difficult for anyone<br/>
to do so. Typically, there is an option on the<br/>
toolbar with the message, or else you can set<br/>
it in the options menu of your email client.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for this is that not everyone uses<br/>
a GUI email client, and hence messages that are<br/>
sent in via attachments (which some email clients<br/>
do when sending html emails) end up being a bit<br/>
tedious to navigate through.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for reading<br/>
