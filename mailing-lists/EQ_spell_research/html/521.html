<b>Subject:</b> Intensify Death. (question with a spoiler) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-822127032">I attempted to research Intensify Death last night twice.<br/>
<br/>
The recipe book says Word of Refuge, sentient, absorption.<br/>
<br/>
When I hit combine.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;These items do not combine in these quantities to produce<br/>
anything.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now before you say &quot;Did you put in only one of them, or you<br/>
have the right ones?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I tried it twice, and triple checked the items.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you about to say You need a pen and<br/>
parchment...you don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know where this spell is sold, or where the heck to<br/>
get a hold of a GM that knows anything?</div>
