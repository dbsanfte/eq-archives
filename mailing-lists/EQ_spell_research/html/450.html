<b>Subject:</b> Re: Kobold Vs Tier&#39;Dal <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121209743">On the Subject of languages.   Kobold and elder Tier D&#39;al are the same.  <br/>
It&#39;s the same for Dark Elven and Tier D&#39;al.  They show up as two different <br/>
names depending on whether you are looking at the chat window or the skills <br/>
listing.  It also seems I am able to learn the basics of a new language each <br/>
level I advance.  I have recently gotten Lizardman and Goblin from my <br/>
trainer.   My languages so far are :<br/>
<br/>
Common, Elder Elvish, Elvish, Dwarven, Dark Elven/Tier D&#39;al, Erudin, Old <br/>
Erudin, Gnoll, Barbarian, Gnomish, Halfling, Dark Speech, Kobold/Elder Tier <br/>
D&#39;al, Ogre, Troll, Goblin, and Lizard Man.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still looking for a high level monk to teach me the basics of Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
On the subject of words.   I seem to find more words than anything else.  <br/>
This is good for me since I am a Necromancer.  I have found most of them on <br/>
DW crocs and DW Caimans in Oasis.  I have also found words and Runes on <br/>
Lavacrawlers in Lavastorm.  There is no certain place where they are found, <br/>
I think all upper level monsters drop them from time to time.  I have a <br/>
Druid friend who has found words, runes, and grimoire pages on Griffawns and <br/>
Griffennes in the Karanas.  I think I covered everything I wanted to.  If <br/>
there are any high level monks that know the basics of Dragon on <br/>
Bristlebain, or anyone else who knows it, give me a tell in-game if you do <br/>
not mind spamming me for a couple minutes to teach me the basice.  I will <br/>
gladly trade knowledge of my languages with you.<br/>
