&gt; I have looked in all the research books and this spell is<br/>
&gt; not present.<br/>
<br/>

Also on the Xegony server would be glad to work on languages with anyone interested.<br/>
It seems at level 16 I put 1 point into research and have been unable to train any further in it any attempt at<br/>
rune combination fails due to skill - now level 19 and wondering how folks got skill up enough to combine runes<br/>
for a spell. My Old Erudian is only up to average but I have blown a tone of points on it and have met no one<br/>
with a higher skill so far - changing zones with a buddy seemed to work but only for an additional 6 pts or so<br/>
even after many rezonings the skill would no longer rise.<br/>
