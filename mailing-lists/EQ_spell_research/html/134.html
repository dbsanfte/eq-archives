<b>Subject:</b> E&#39;ci server want to learn languages <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600662663">Hail and well met all.  I&#39;m a level 18 Necromancer of the E&#39;ci server<br/>
interested in learning a bunch of languages.  Mostly old erudian but<br/>
anything is welcome.  I have a couple pages of Tasarin&#39;s Grimoire to trade<br/>
but smithing has taken all my other spare money.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps many of us could gather in the Tunnel of Ro or somewhere everyone<br/>
can be and practice languages for a while.</div>
