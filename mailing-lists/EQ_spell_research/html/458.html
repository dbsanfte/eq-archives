<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120725050"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; On the subject of words.   I seem to find more words than anything else.<br/>
&gt; This is good for me since I am a Necromancer.  I have found most of them on<br/>
&gt; DW crocs and DW Caimans in Oasis.  I have also found words and Runes on<br/>
&gt; Lavacrawlers in Lavastorm.  There is no certain place where they are found,<br/>
&gt; I think all upper level monsters drop them from time to time.  I have a<br/>
&gt; Druid friend who has found words, runes, and grimoire pages on Griffawns and<br/>
&gt; Griffennes in the Karanas.  I think I covered everything I wanted to.  If<br/>
&gt; there are any high level monks that know the basics of Dragon on<br/>
&gt; Bristlebain, or anyone else who knows it, give me a tell in-game if you do<br/>
&gt; not mind spamming me for a couple minutes to teach me the basice.  I will<br/>
&gt; gladly trade knowledge of my languages with you.<br/>
