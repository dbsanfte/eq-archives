<div id="ygrps-yiv-440843476"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Ok, so there are no good sites to go to for some beginners tips.  Are there<br/>
&gt;any items in the game that explain how to do this?  I am a level 16 wizard,<br/>
&gt;so I need to start thinking about this..  As a blacksmith, there are two<br/>
&gt;books that explain what components you need.  Is there such a book for<br/>
&gt;wizards/casters?  Thx<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, there are research books. I am also of 16th level, but i am enchanter.<br/>
There are two kinds of books, information books, and component books. In my<br/>
class example, the first book for enchanters is &#39;An end of an age&#39; or some<br/>
such name and it really tells you nothing exept to keep an eye out for works<br/>
done by long forgotten enchanters, and even lists a few names (I do not<br/>
beleive this to be a spoiler, because enchanters will still have to purchase<br/>
the book to find out some of the names listed in the book).<br/>
<br/>
The other types of books open up to allow you to add spell components to<br/>
them, like the books &#39;The Book of Ancient Resoration&#39; or &#39;Endless Tomb of<br/>
Enchantments&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Various spell components can be found on different kinds of creatures thru<br/>
out the realm. At this time i have not found any of these components myself,<br/>
but have been in groups where people have been fortunate enough to find<br/>
them. They seem to be pages of script or something, many requiring dead<br/>
languages to read.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the creatures that i&#39;ve been told to seek out for the components are<br/>
Gorge Hounds, Deep Water Crocks, and Gouls. I have killed many gorge hounds,<br/>
but have yet to find anything on those, and have only fought a small amount<br/>
of gouls and no DW crocks.<br/>
<br/>
Admitedly my information is small, but it is a start. Hope it helps you.</div>
