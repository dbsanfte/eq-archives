<div id="ygrps-yiv-376133770">I am not by any means defending the originator of this virus. That being<br/>
said, the happy virus is a virus that automatically attaches itself to all<br/>
outgoing email messages if you are infected. Furthermore, unless the<br/>
infected person sends an email to himself, he has no idea that it is being<br/>
sent. It is possible that the poster was not even aware that he sent that<br/>
attachment, though the fact that there was no text in the email may indicate<br/>
otherwise. But, if he has the address of this list in his address book, it<br/>
may be an automated mailing and he may not even be aware that it was sent. I<br/>
have sent him an email to notify him in case this was not intended. Just<br/>
thought some clarification would be good before we have the FBI arresting<br/>
this guy on 1st degree murder charges.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you execute the attachment, you are in no danger of becoming<br/>
infected. If you have already executed it, simply download a copy of Mcafee<br/>
for free and it will clean it out for you. www.mcafee.com<br/>
For those are interested, I have attached details of the virus below from<br/>
the Mcafee web site.<br/>

****************************<br/>
The worm infects a system via email delivery and arrives as an attachment<br/>
called Happy99.EXE. It is sent unknowingly by a user. When the program is<br/>
run it deploys its payload displaying fireworks on the users monitor.<br/>
<br/>
Note: At this time no destructive payload has been discovered.<br/>
<br/>
When the Happy.EXE is run it copies itself to Windows&#92;System folder under<br/>
the name SKA.EXE. It then extracts, from within itself, a DLL called SKA.DLL<br/>
into the Windows&#92;System folder if one does not already exist.<br/>
<br/>
Note: Though the SKA.EXE file file is a copy of the original it does not run<br/>
as the Happy.EXE files does, so it does not copy itself again, nor does it<br/>
display the fireworks on the users monitor.<br/>
<br/>
The worm then checks for the existence of WSOCK32.SKA in the Windows&#92;System<br/>
folder, if it does not exist and a the file WSOCK32.DLL does exist, it<br/>
copies the WSOCK32.DLL to WSOCK32.SKA.<br/>
<br/>
The worm then creates the registry entry -<br/>
<br/>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&#92;SOFTWARE&#92;Microsoft&#92;Windows&#92;CurrentVersion&#92;RunOnce&#92;Ska.exe<br/>
=&quot;Ska.exe&quot;<br/>
<br/>
- which will execute SKA.EXE the next time the system is restarted. When<br/>
this happens the worm patches WSOCK32.DLL and adds hooks to the exported<br/>
functions EnumProtocolsW and WSAAsyncGetProtocolByName.<br/>
<br/>
The patched code calls two exported functions in SKA.DLL called mail and<br/>
news, these functions allow the worm to attach itself to SMTP e-mail and<br/>
also to any postings to newsgroups the user makes.<br/>

&gt; Who the HELL do you think you are sending virus executables out to people<br/>
&gt; on a mailing list.  I have written to your isp about this matter and I am<br/>
&gt; certain they will take action on it.  Spreading viruses is a felony. You<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t deserve to have an internet account with any isp in my humble<br/>
opinion.<br/>
