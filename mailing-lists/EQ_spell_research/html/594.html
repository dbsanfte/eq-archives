<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002823907">i believe that the kill steal trick she&#39;s referring to is the enchanter<br/>
mesmerizing a creature, and then nuking, and getting the kill as if the<br/>
original assailants had zoned it.  i have a friend that just started an<br/>
enchanter, and was talking about helping twink it, and he mentioned that<br/>
tactic.  LJ is level 25, however, and i&#39;m not sure if mesmerize would<br/>
work on it..nor do i know if memory blur or another hate list erase<br/>
spell would do the same thing.  anyhow, don&#39;t play an enchanter, so i<br/>
could be wrong.<br/>
