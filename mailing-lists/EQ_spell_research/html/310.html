<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366808667"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Only after I mentioned that I could do a combination of see invis / invis<br/>
&gt;did the group appreciate me a bit more (especially after large trains of<br/>
&gt;elite gnoll guards / gnoll commanders in BB).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When you get whirl till you hurl you will be MUCH appreciated hehe<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Jewelmaking I would highly recommend to an enchanter, especially Dark Elf<br/>
&gt;(since the Enchant: Silver spell is in Neriak and, from what I&#39;ve heard, no<br/>
&gt;where else; if I&#39;m wrong, PLEASE tell me!).  Once the Dark Elf Enchanter<br/>
&gt;has the illusion spells, along with invisibility, there&#39;s no place that<br/>
&gt;character can&#39;t go (more or less).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A little warning here...DONT join groups of people who want to kill off the<br/>
Dark Elf Guards for the exp and bronze weapons. You will be KOS (Killed on<br/>
Sight) regardless of what illusion you have on. If you have ANY plans of<br/>
jewelry making, then dont do it. Sure you can pay someone to go get it, but<br/>
i&#39;d rather i did it myself to save me the trouble of finding someone willing<br/>
to do it, someone who is honest if they want you to give them the money (i<br/>
gave the money to one person and never heard from them again), and plus<br/>
would just like to be able to quickly get in, get it, and get out.<br/>
<br/>
I thought that i could kill like 5 or 6 guards and still be safe...nope.<br/>
Made myself look like a Dark Elf to go in and get Enchant Electrum, killed<br/>
soon as i hit the bridge with the guards. do yourself a favor and dont kill<br/>
the DE guards.</div>
