<b>Subject:</b> Practice Research Bugged? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-391694877">Has anyone successfully attempted the new practice research implemented<br/>
in yesterdays patch? I did the minor quests, recived the recepie book<br/>
and the new book to combine items. So I thought I&#39;d try the simplest<br/>
runes before using the rarer components in the harder runes.<br/>
Tried Rune 1: Lapiz Lazuli, Bat Wing, Bone Chip. Items fail to combine<br/>
in these quantities.<br/>
Ah, it mentioned needing a quill and parchment in the book. I buy both<br/>
at guild, and try the same. Items fail to combine in these quantities.<br/>
<br/>
So I try the next: Turquoise, Fire Beetle Eye, and a Rusty slashing<br/>
weapon. Same fail. Added quill and parchment, still same failure. Tried<br/>
many different slashing weapons. All fail.<br/>
<br/>
So is it buggy, and did Verant really add this whole new piece to<br/>
research without testing it in the slightest, even to attempt to make<br/>
one item? I have trouble believing even Verant would do that...so am I<br/>
missing something obvious? Would be interested to hear what kind of<br/>
success others have had with this new addition.<br/>
