<div id="ygrps-yiv-540252058">At 27th the best DD spell you can cast does 165 damage!?  I do 173 at level<br/>
21 with Force Shock, do wizards not get a direct damage spell at 24?  As for<br/>
dueling I never got into EQ to duel so I am not too worried about that.  I<br/>
know that when myself and one wizard friend get together in a free for all<br/>
area like the orc area in Highpass Hold we get more than our fair share of<br/>
the kills regardless of who is there necros, wizards, whoever.<br/>
<br/>
One huge advantage, we get travel and group travel only druids get similar<br/>
spells as I recall.  I love being able to hit Erudin to get spells at a<br/>
reasonable cost and sell for top prices and then bounce back to Faydwer or<br/>
wherever, that is an enormous power.<br/>

&gt;     Elidain, &quot;us&quot; refers to Wizards.  The class that has<br/>
&gt; nothing.  Give me<br/>
&gt; an example of what we have over any class, and I will bash it into the<br/>
&gt; ground with another example that blows it away.  As to<br/>
&gt; fizzles, etc...  We<br/>
&gt; are the slowest casters in the game.  I dueled a Necromancer<br/>
&gt; that had the<br/>
&gt; same HP as I, and we agreed to do DD spells only, in which he<br/>
&gt; did 160 damage<br/>
&gt; and I did 165.  The Necromancer won.  I have higher Magic<br/>
&gt; resistance, but<br/>
&gt; his spells did full damage every time.  My spell did full<br/>
&gt; damage once, and<br/>
&gt; it looked to be about 4 damage the second time.  Just so you<br/>
&gt; know, we dueled<br/>
&gt; with NO BUFFS on.  The speed of his spell was too much, as he<br/>
&gt; always was<br/>
&gt; ahead of my casts.  Anyways, I&#39;m out.  Someone try to tell me a reason<br/>
&gt; Wizards are better, and I will defend my statement that we suck.<br/>
