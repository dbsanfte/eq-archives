&gt;  Very important in learning other languages.  You must be grouped with the<br/>
&gt;  person that is speaking the language you want to know. =)<br/>

It is also polite to do it in gsay so that you do not disturb others with <br/>
your gibberish (because that is what it will be at the beginning)<br/>
<br/>
And also be carefull.  If you speak too fast ... some people will be forced <br/>
to leave the world (I.E. they will be punted)  it will take practice to find <br/>
a pace that is fast... while also not too fast.  And it depends on each <br/>
person.  The person I normally play with can take text as fast as I can send <br/>
it.  While I will punt if it is given to me more than 10 lines a second.<br/>
