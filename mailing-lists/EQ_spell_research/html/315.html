&gt;Subject: Lil bit from an Enchanter<br/>
&gt;Just a lil point, <br/>
&gt;I have watched a group of lvl 16 necros kill sand giants.... Ok, thats<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fine, but here is what irks me. I realize that as an enchanter I am not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;expected to do the offense like wizards, magicians or even necros, Our<br/>
 </span></blockquote>prime directive is debuffing and buffing and we get some incredible<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;spells. Here are my rants. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am a 20th level enchanter and I solo all the time,  I simply use my pet<br/>
and whirl the creatures with no problem.  I have been soloing since level<br/>
8th.  Granted level 15th and 19th were hard with only a 12th and 16th level<br/>
pet, but I made it.  I do believe that groups will appreciate you more once<br/>
you get the whirl till you hurl spell.  I have people swear to me that they<br/>
would rather fight with a enchanter vs wizard anyday due to the fact that<br/>
they can whirl and have a pet.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;1. we don&#39;t get enought buff or debuff that only WE have. Why do other<br/>
 </span></blockquote>classes get beserker str? Thats unbeknownst to me. <br/>
<br/>
You are incorrect Ber. Str is available to enchanters as a 20th level<br/>
research spell.  I confirmed this with a 30th level enchanter.  (I came<br/>
across a spell list that had the spell and couldn&#39;t find it anywhere, I<br/>
then decided to ask the 30th level enchanter if they had it, they did, they<br/>
researched it).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2. Ok, i can understand perhaps them resisting our offensive dmg spells<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but how are we supposed to be a group debuffer if they resist all &gt;our<br/>
spells? Even after using tashan or tashanii which also have a tendency to<br/>
get resisted? Kinda makes us useless in that regard eh?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I honestly believe all mage classes have this problem of monsters resisting<br/>
spells.  I was fighting a DW Croc yesterday at full health and full mana.<br/>
I almost died.  I lost my pet (20th level) and had 3 resisted sanity warped<br/>
spells (92 points of damage currently) and 5 resisted whirl till you hurl.<br/>
I had to rely on a kind necro for the help to kill it in the end.  BTW the<br/>
DW Croc was blue to me, I rarely ever cast a tashen spell.  I find that I&#39;m<br/>
just as sucessful with it as without it.<br/>
<br/>
Do not sell yourself short.  Enchanters are amoung one of the most powerful<br/>
classes out there, on the otherhand also one of the most difficult to play.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 coppers worth for you.<br/>
<br/>
To all out there, this might of been a tad bit off topic. But I did mention<br/>
the research part about bersker Str.  8)  <br/>
<br/>
Safe journey to all and Good Luck.<br/>
