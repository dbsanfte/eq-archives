<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370546619">Yes, you can camp with the Testament.<br/>
<br/>
I have also have yet to travel to Highpass.  However, I have seen an NPC in<br/>
surefall (at the entrance) with the first name Ran.  I will be traveling to<br/>
Highpass soon (16th level Wizard) and will keep you up dated.<br/>
<br/>
This is probably only a quest, and not research related.. i am sorry if it<br/>
is not and have clogged your mailboxes. :)<br/>

&gt; I have gone on the same quest.  A Paladin (npc)in Erudin asks you to go on<br/>
quest to find the Teatamnet of Vanear.<br/>
&gt; An enchantress in Erudin talks to you about her brother Moodoro Findhorn.<br/>
How he had been slated for execution for selling the magical water of the<br/>
vasty deep to a npc in Qeynos at Crow&#39;s Inn called Flynn. She wants you to<br/>
find Flynn and Moodoro and get the water, then she will poison it and you<br/>
return it to Flynn.  (haven&#39;t done this quest yet fully though, because I<br/>
can&#39;t get Flynn to talk to me.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyhow, sorry about the side tangent but,  You locate Moodoro in Qeynos.<br/>
When you ask him about the Testamnet of Vanear he will sell it to you for<br/>
2gp and change.  Thus far I have come as well and need to venture to High<br/>
Hold in search of the holder of the 2 pages Ran the Librarian.  Seeing as<br/>
how everyone and their dog talks about getting slaughtered when they go to<br/>
High Hold, I don&#39;t think I will be finishing this quest for at least a<br/>
couple more lvls.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Although, I am very interested to see how this Quest turns out, and if you<br/>
can use the Testament for any other purpose than delivering it back to the<br/>
Paladin in Erudin.  It would be great if it allowed you some new spells or<br/>
something.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do think though, if you camp that the Testament will disappear from your<br/>
inventory (correct me if I am wrong).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If anyone else has more info on this topic I would be greatly thankful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I have acquired a book called the Testament of Vanear as part of a<br/>
quest.  It is<br/>
&gt;   missing two pages which a NPC named Ran (Librarian in High Hold)<br/>
supposedly<br/>
&gt;   stole.  It appears that if these two pages are acquired and combined in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt;   Testament that you will get a working copy of the Testament of Vanear.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I was wondering if this was a book for research, or it had another<br/>
purpose.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Thanks in advance.<br/>
