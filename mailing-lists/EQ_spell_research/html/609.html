<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-929340440"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Is a price for a Words and runes and pages similar? I have seen that<br/>
&gt; enchanter pages are nearly imposible to sell as enchanters are nowere to<br/>
&gt; find eheh. anyone knows what is percentual diference in number of<br/>
&gt; enchanters against number of orher classes in game ?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ack, I&#39;ve been hoping to find a page ANYWHERE (granted we&#39;re probably on<br/>
different servers, I&#39;m on Veeshan) and no one seems to have them, or i get<br/>
&#39;oh sorry, i just sold the one i found to a vendor&#39; ..<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I do manage to find a page or find someone who has one and is<br/>
wanting to sell it, it&#39;s ALWAYS pages 23, 24, 26, or 30 of the grimiore. I<br/>
havent even seen a page from velishoul&#39;s since I was level 16 and found a<br/>
few myself. And everytime I&#39;m in a group AND if someone happens to find a<br/>
page on a loot, then they always have some friend that they give them too.<br/>
<br/>
So far I&#39;ve gotten the spells from 23, 24, 26, 30, and 312. I have parts to<br/>
390 and 375, but cant find other stuff. Getting a little annoyed that i cant<br/>
find pages but i see those damn Words all over .. I&#39;m currently level 22 and<br/>
would like to have the spells for level 24 (my next spell level) on hand, or<br/>
in the very least find somthing interesting to try and reasearch.</div>
