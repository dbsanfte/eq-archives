imo. Definitely the first step down the slippery slope towards the tank mage<br/>

keep it that way.<br/>

&gt;I hear that when Specialization come in that we will be able to cast the<br/>
&gt;spell using less mana depending on what we are specializing in. That being<br/>
&gt;the case, If we specialize in a certain area such as conjuration, will we<br/>
&gt;get new spells such as summon food and water, etc.  If they decide to let<br/>

&gt;the spells the wizard gets depending on which area of specialization he is<br/>
&gt;in.  If I wated to get SoW for example, I would have to train in the<br/>
&gt;specialization spell trait that is used when SoW is cast (alteration,<br/>
&gt;divination, etc.). This would allow us to get hybrid spells without making<br/>
&gt;us too powerful, and allow the wizard player to be able to be a more well<br/>
&gt;rounded profession rather than being so dependant on others to buff and<br/>
&gt;group with.  I don&#39;t know about you, but there are times when I am playing<br/>
&gt;and no one is online who wants to group with me.  This can be frustrating<br/>
&gt;cause we are not good at melee.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just my two cents worth.<br/>
