<div id="ygrps-yiv-975018363"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I do wish they made them all stackable!  I have been on a long quest for <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Where do you find handmade backpacks?  Or more to the point, how do you<br/>
MAKE them?  After spending a ridiculoud amount of time and money searching<br/>
for the answer and experimenting with combinations that don&#39;t work, neither<br/>
I nor any guild member have been able to figure out how to tailor a<br/>
Backpack.  If I read into your message correctly, the tailored backpacks<br/>
have 10 slots instead of the standard 8?  That answers the long-asked<br/>
question of why backpack patterns are more expensive than backpacks.<br/>
<br/>
I realize this is a bit off-topic, but I have seen mention of handmade<br/>
backpacks NOWHERE else.  And no one else seems to have a clue.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
