<b>Subject:</b> Language learning...everything I know from hours of experimenting <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-412229599">Ok, I spent several hours one night experimenting with language learning.  Here are the results.<br/>
<br/>
It IS possible to spend ONE POINT in a language for ONE PERSON, and teach each other to Excellent.  I have done it.<br/>
<br/>
First off, languages are only teachable in Group Say.  No other communication will work.<br/>
<br/>
Second, you can teach someone to one point ABOVE your current skill.  Ex. if you are at 15 with your skill, you can get other people up to 16 by spamming them.<br/>
<br/>
Third, and the most annoying, is that this will not take effect until you either zone or log out.  <br/>
<br/>
So, here was the cycle we went through to get Elder Elvish from awful to excellent in about an hour.<br/>
<br/>
We both turned group say OFF in chat filters.  You don&#39;t need to SEE the spam to get the language points from it.<br/>
<br/>
The person who is higher spams the person lower with a macro, using groupsay and the language to be learned.  When the lower person gains 2 points (ie is now one point above the teacher), he zones, and the teacher follows.  Switch roles, and repeat.  It took about an hour to get from Awful to Excellent using this method, once we had the rhythm down.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Excellent is rated from skill 91 to 100, so just because you are at Excellent doesn&#39;t mean you are maxed.  Keep going until someone only gains one point and stops.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, it is not possible to go above 100 skill in any language.  Now, this is only by spamming, so it MAY be possible to be taught at your guild hall.  If you want to blow the 12 plat on it to go up another point, that is....<br/>
