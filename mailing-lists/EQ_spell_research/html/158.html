&gt; I forgot to work on my piercing skills for about 4 levels...  then when I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>went back to using a Giant snake fang..  it wont increase my skill..    Do I<br/>
have to put some practice points into it?  Or does it just take longer to<br/>
get back to increasing?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>With the way the skill system works... It should be easier for you to<br/>
increase your skill now as the skill cap has increased from what it was four<br/>
levels ago.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as skills get higher, it takes longer for them to increase (within<br/>
reason.. sometimes you&#39;ll see nothing, then it&#39;ll jump up 3 points in 3<br/>
swings).  I would just continue to use piercing normally.  It will go up.<br/>
