<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242609114">Your skill will improve with time.  I ran into this problem myself with 1H Blunt.  The best solution is to follow this procedure.<br/>
<br/>
1) Find a group<br/>
2) Attack a mob (monster)<br/>
3) wait until the tanks get a few hits in<br/>
4) Place yourself BEHIND the mob<br/>
5) Start swinging your fang<br/>
6) When the mob is low enough on HP&#39;s, step behind the tanks and burn as usual<br/>
<br/>
The only time this doesn&#39;t work is against semi intelligent mobs who have a natural distaste for casting classes.  You&#39;ll find this out when they turn around and attack you.  If this happens, just step back.  Getting behind the mob is important<br/>
because you get a &quot;chance to hit&quot; bonus, and this will raise your skill faster.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck, and by the way, this question is a little bit off topic.  You may be better off posting it to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> (another very active mailling list)<br/>

&gt; I forgot to work on my piercing skills for about 4 levels...  then when I went back to using a Giant snake fang..  it wont increase my skill..    Do I have to put some practice points into it?  Or does it just take longer to get back to increasing?<br/>
