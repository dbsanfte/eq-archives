<div id="ygrps-yiv-643343937">Friend of mine is a L17 ranger on Fennin.  He says that he has found<br/>
words from scarecrows.  He also says that he&#39;s usually hunted in <br/>
BlackBurrow, and lo and behold, he went to his guildmaster, looked<br/>
at what he could train in, and he has the Gnoll language skill (?)<br/>
<br/>
I played a troll at one point, was in a group, and we used the /g<br/>
command extensively.  Lo and behold it said, &quot;You have become<br/>
better at Troll!&quot; or something to the sort.<br/>
<br/>
I assume partying with an erudite or going to erudin would help<br/>
start the fundamentals of the language.<br/>
