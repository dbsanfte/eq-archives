<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613367134">Quick note, I have climbed up on barns in the Karanas to avoid Grizzly&#39;s<br/>
etc. and not been hit.  Even meditated and cast a few more spells to finish<br/>
it off.<br/>
<br/>
To stay on research what is the tome you need to actually combine the items<br/>
together?  Is it the lexicon?  Thanks!<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve often wondered about such situations when using a levitate<br/>
&gt; type spell.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not high enough level to use them as yet, but would this<br/>
&gt; tactic be seen<br/>
&gt; as an exploit by Verant?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No, they wouldn&#39;t because contrary to what someone else posted, once you<br/>
&gt; float down ( and it&#39;s a pretty rapid descent ), they can hit you. Height<br/>
&gt; makes no difference to mobs. Here&#39;s a first hand example. I was playing my<br/>
&gt; troll and between the entrance to GUK and South Ro there&#39;s a small tower.<br/>
&gt; Inside the tower there&#39;s a ladder that leads up to the battlements. Now, a<br/>
&gt; zombie on the TOP of the tower, was hitting me standing at the<br/>
&gt; BOTTOM of the<br/>
&gt; tower in the entranceway. Seems to me this is about as unfair as<br/>
&gt; being able<br/>
&gt; to walk through walls and take swipes at players sitting there medding<br/>
&gt; peacefully. : ) However, I can see the need for this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other reason Verant couldn&#39;t claim that a &#39; Fly n&#39; Fry &#39; tactic was an<br/>
&gt; expoit would be because it&#39;s effectively the same as a root<br/>
&gt; spell. They both<br/>
&gt; have durations. They both can wear off, so it&#39;s not a guaranteed thing. Of<br/>
&gt; course, this is all my opinion but I don&#39;t see it any other way.<br/>
