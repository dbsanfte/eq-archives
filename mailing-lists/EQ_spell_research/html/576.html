Cast Force<br/>
<br/>
This is a magic based offensive spell.<br/>
<br/>
If in fact this is the spell you speak of then I beg you to go out and attempt to cast it upon a single target from a distance.. If infact I was at all incorrect in stating it was an AE spell then the mistake was that it is a PB spell not an AE spell and certainly not a DD spell.<br/>
<br/>
I�ll forgive your insulting back talk for the moment, as I imagine you must be human and have little knowledge of this subject.<br/>
