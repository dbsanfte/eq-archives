<div id="ygrps-yiv-293239569">Did you stop to think that there may be some NEW Internet users included in <br/>
this mailing list that haven&#39;t actually been well versed on viruses <br/>
yet?  There are a lot of new people..thousands daily.  I don&#39;t see that <br/>
everyone is taught in advance of the things that could come from opening <br/>
.exe files they get in e-mail.  It looks innocuous enough when they get <br/>
it.  Lots of new people end up with infected systems from things happening <br/>
just like this.<br/>
Personally, I am well versed and I know what to do and what not to do to <br/>
assure that I don&#39;t have something on my system I don&#39;t want, BUT, there <br/>
are many new people who aren&#39;t.  The anger is directed towards what can <br/>
happen to users who are not educated to these things rather than the folks <br/>
who already know what&#39;s up with attachments.<br/>
The person who sent that out is also a 15 year old boy.  I checked his <br/>
profile and unless he is fibbing (doubtful or he woulda said he is older <br/>
:)  ) then he is about 10th grade in high school.<br/>

&gt;O.K. people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You have nothing to fear from viruses in E-Mail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you don&#39;t download attachments then you are fine...A<br/>
&gt;virus CANNOT be sent by E-Mail.  Only by attachments.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You can even open the E-Mail without fear...just DO NOT open<br/>
&gt;the attachment.<br/>
