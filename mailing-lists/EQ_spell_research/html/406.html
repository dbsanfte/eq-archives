<div id="ygrps-yiv-616769408">The spells say level 61 because they had no other way to keep the hybrid<br/>
class&#39;s from buying the spells.  If there were no hybrid class&#39;s spells<br/>
would say unusable to whatever class......I had an SK buy a Necro spell<br/>
and it said the same thing......thats just Verants way of saying you<br/>
can&#39;t use this.<br/>
<br/>
Druid&#39;s can do spells research...Shaman, Rangers, SK&#39;s, and Paladins I<br/>
don&#39;t believe can.<br/>
<br/>
Spells I hope won&#39;t cross over.  As someone said before....there would<br/>
be no point in having the different class&#39;s if you could learn any spell<br/>
you wanted from any class&#39;s spell list.  I picked my class cause I liked<br/>
what it had to offer.  Obviously other class&#39;s have spells I want....but<br/>
thats part of the sacarafice.<br/>
