<div id="ygrps-yiv-349989431">I went to the Trainer for Wizards last night and found nothing that had to<br/>
do with specializing in anything.  Is it implemented yet?<br/>
	I successfully made the Enstill spell at level 20, and failed at level 19.<br/>
Also, Enstill seems to just take longer to cast, and supposedly holds them<br/>
longer.  Doesn&#39;t seem to work any better than Root, if anything worse(lack<br/>
of use I hope).<br/>

What class does &quot;us&quot; refer to?  How do you get specialization is it back in<br/>
at the trainer?  Also what effect does specialization have on casting?  Mana<br/>
cost?  Speed?  Resistance?  Fizzles?  Research success?<br/>
<br/>
I am so full of questions today. =)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I tried to research Enstill yesterday and it said I lacked the skill to<br/>
fashion an item. =(  My research is maxed for my level, any ideas as to what<br/>
level one would get the ability to pull that one off easily?  I need Enstill<br/>
the creatures now just laugh at my root spell.<br/>

&gt; Well guys, looks like we finally got Specialization, now<br/>
&gt; Necromancers get to<br/>
&gt; cast even faster than us! </span></blockquote></div>
