<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746454409">Being a 36th level wizard, getting any of the items is really not that hard.<br/>
That said that I tried to make 5 different combinations from the practice<br/>
runes to the magi runes and NONE of them worked.  All I got was the message<br/>
that these items do not combine.  I reported every one of these bugs.  I<br/>
have tried with and without the quill and parchment.<br/>
<br/>
As a person who did not save all of their points for research, I could use<br/>
the practice runes to max out my research skill and I think that the way<br/>
that they created is fair and creative.  However, it makes me angry that<br/>
they aparently did not test this at all.  (Monday afternoon my wizard could<br/>
not even use the Concordance of Research).<br/>
