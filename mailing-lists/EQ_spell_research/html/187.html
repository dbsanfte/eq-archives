<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513600364">I have heard lots of people getting runes in lavastorm as of late .. <br/>
especially off the ele&#39;s there.. unfortunately when it comes my turn to <br/>
loot...I seem to come up empty handed :)  Go figure.  My previous post <br/>
wasn&#39;t meant to just direct to east commons.. I should have followed up <br/>
with extra information that it wasn&#39;t just wisps or that particular <br/>
area...that was before runes and other research components were made more <br/>
readily available.  It was a surprise to me to get that.<br/>

&gt;There is no &quot;specific&quot; monster to look for them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They are randomly found items.  You find them on magical, or magic using<br/>
&gt;creatures.  So you can&#39;t say &quot;go to Rathe, and kill Bob the evil mage&quot; You<br/>
&gt;have to say... &quot;Go to lavastorm, kill elementals.  I will trade items I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;use for items you can&#39;t use&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So this mailing list was rally intended to be...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I have Rune of zapping, page 550000 of the grimoire.  I will trade for Word<br/>
&gt;of smiting, and word of suffering.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But it is nice to have the conversations about spell research it in general<br/>
&gt;also.<br/>
