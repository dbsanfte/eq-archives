&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have found that Frogloks drop words more often than runes or pages.<br/>
&gt; So far I found 6 words, 1 rune, 0 pages off of Frogloks.  I <br/>
&gt; believe all<br/>
&gt; of them have been of the shamans (Gaz and Ton Shamans) as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since words are for both necromancers and magicians you may have found<br/>
<br/>
3 magi, 3 necro, 1 wiz, 0 enchanter items. This is still within the bounds<br/>
of random chance.<br/>
<br/>
Though I have to admit that when fighting the cat people I found slightly<br/>
about 2X the number of words as runes + pages.<br/>
