<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844614920">Ok First off I just wanted to tank you all for your prompt responses.<br/>
However I have moved back to one of my original questions.<br/>
<br/>
According to the Mythiran Tower and to EQCasters:<br/>
Banshee Arua uses Words of Divination and Words of Eradication<br/>
I am still left with wondering what Words of Derivation are used for....?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info about the Words of Pacification.  Now the only question<br/>
is do I sell them or hang on to them in hopes that they will put the 24th<br/>
level Charm spell back in the game.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up selling that non stacking words of  Dominion.  It was annoying<br/>
me and sold for the same as the Stacking words of Dominion.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll pop off an identify spell on the faded page when I am in game next.<br/>
If that dosen&#39;t work I&#39;ll just give it to one of the enchanters in my guild<br/>
and let them worry abou it.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Again thanks for the help.<br/>
