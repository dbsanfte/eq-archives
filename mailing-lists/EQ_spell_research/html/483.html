<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025172746">Fear not my brother! I find that the best groups are wizard heavy.  I<br/>
adventured last night with a group that had 4 wizards (20th, 17th(me), 16th,<br/>
and 16th) 1 monk(15th), and 1 paladin(16th).   We were hunting orcs in<br/>
highpass hold.  Hardly anyone got hurt because the targets were dead before<br/>
they could do any real damage.  We were hunting things that were at least<br/>
blue to the 20th level person and everyone was being effective.  I did get<br/>
resisted a few times by some of the higher level mobs but nothing too crazy<br/>
and no one ever came close to dying.  Plus we all got a bunch of experience<br/>
even the 15th level guy who made 16th.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I found half a page of a Grimoire and 1 words from the orcs there.  I<br/>
also bought a rune from the Paladin in our group who looted it.  I think<br/>
they were alocytes and medics  and scouts we got them from.<br/>
