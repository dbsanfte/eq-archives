<b>Subject:</b> languages on Xegony <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-814318106">I am a Dark elven wizard residing on the Xegony world.  I am in need of the services of a teacher.  I need to learn the languages of the Elder erudians as well as the Elder Elves (ironic? i think so!).  please message me if ye be the one to provide these services. I have very few runes to give in exchange, but would be happier to pay in Platinum.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you;<br/>
