&gt; How did you get your skill up from 1 to 47 as since level 16 to 19 I have not been allowed to train more than one<br/>
&gt; point in the ability ?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most ( all? ) skills associated with lvls do not start at 1, many will<br/>
give u a certain number of skill points depending on your lvl.<br/>
In certain cases it makes sense to not train a skill as soon as u attain<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
But that is not what applies to me. i too only could put 1 training<br/>
point to start with, just that with more levels u r allowed to put more<br/>
points in.I started researching very late.Mainly i didnt want to waist<br/>
time with it ,till absolutely necessary.<br/>
