<div id="ygrps-yiv-546701733">I don&#39;t think its as bad as you make it out to be.  First off, yeah<br/>
I think LifeDrain being totally unresisted might be a bug, but really you<br/>
have to look at its usefullness.  Its one of the most mana inefficent spells<br/>
we have.  Everything else gets resisted as ususal.  Basically it was us<br/>
using our fearless skeleton pets to occupy it long enough for us to cast a<br/>
MASS of LifeDrains on it.  It works fairly well on Griffins (level 28-32 I<br/>
believe) and about 60% of the time we could take a Hill Giant (level 38-42<br/>
or so).<br/>
<br/>
	Second of all, I don&#39;t see why it doesn&#39;t work both ways.  At level<br/>
18 if 6 gnoll guards (level 10 or so) attacked me I&#39;d get floored, maybe it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t happen to a warrior, but conversely if a level 20 Warrior was<br/>
occupied with 6 necro pets fighting off six acolytes he&#39;d probably die.<br/>
<br/>
	I know its the not the same moving from PC to NPC, because we KNOW<br/>
how to group up and use tactics while the AI is very poor at this.  There<br/>
are differences, but I think I would see as we all get higher of level, the<br/>
&quot;resistance&quot; area should broaden, meaning that we can cast better on higher<br/>
level monsters and lower level still can still affect us.<br/>
<br/>
	Is it buggy?  Probably to an extent.  Or maybe its everyone else&#39;s<br/>
spells are buggy because they get resisted too much?  Maybe Verant couldn&#39;t<br/>
make the AI do back to the PCs what the PCs could do to the AI?  Sheesh, who<br/>
knows?  I think that probably LifeDrain should take a resistance hit but I<br/>
don&#39;t think any direct damage spell should truly be resisted, but should<br/>
just lose strength.<br/>

PS - And don&#39;t think killing a griffin is great experience.  Splitting it up<br/>
six ways with similar level necros gave me less than an eighth of a bubble<br/>
of XP, which means all the time we spent waiting, fighting, then medding or<br/>
collecting corpses (dont&#39; forget griffs and HGs are 24 hours spawns, so<br/>
after you kill the two wandering around you have to wait an hour and a half)<br/>
I could&#39;ve gained a level fighting crocs. ;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m amazed you could get spells through on a Griffon or HG at that level.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both of these are level 30+ monsters. Accordingly I wouldn&#39;t think a level<br/>
18-20 group should be able to get one spell through. Certainly with my<br/>
Wizard if it&#39;s more that a couple levels higher than me I don&#39;t even bother<br/>
casting as it will get resisted fully.<br/>

&gt; Unless I misread your post, I think it only prudent that Verant change<br/>

should be taking down monsters that are double their level. That&#39;s a tad<br/>
extreme.<br/>

&gt; 	&gt; &gt;Just a lil point, <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; &gt;I have watched a group of lvl 16 necros kill sand giants.... <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; Ok, thats<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; fine, but here is what irks me. I realize that as an <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; enchanter I am not<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; &gt;expected to do the offense like wizards, magicians or even <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; necros, Our<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; prime directive is debuffing and buffing and we get some<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	&gt; &gt;spells. Here are my rants. <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; I am a 20th level enchanter and I solo all the time,  I <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; simply use my pet<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; and whirl the creatures with no problem.  I have been soloing <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; since level<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; 8th.  Granted level 15th and 19th were hard with only a 12th <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; and 16th level<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; pet, but I made it.  I do believe that groups will appreciate <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; you more once<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; you get the whirl till you hurl spell.  I have people swear <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; to me that they<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; would rather fight with a enchanter vs wizard anyday due to <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; the fact that<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; they can whirl and have a pet.<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; &gt;1. we don&#39;t get enought buff or debuff that only WE have. <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; Why do other<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; classes get beserker str? Thats unbeknownst to me. <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; You are incorrect Ber. Str is available to enchanters as a 20th<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	&gt; research spell.  I confirmed this with a 30th level <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; enchanter.  (I came<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; across a spell list that had the spell and couldn&#39;t find it <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; anywhere, I&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; then decided to ask the 30th level enchanter if they had it, <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; they did, they<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; researched it).<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; &gt;2. Ok, i can understand perhaps them resisting our offensive <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; dmg spells<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; but how are we supposed to be a group debuffer if they resist all<br/>
&gt;our<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; spells? Even after using tashan or tashanii which also have a <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; tendency to<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; get resisted? Kinda makes us useless in that regard eh?<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; &gt;Just a few things im kinda irked about...<br/>

&gt; 	&gt; I honestly believe all mage classes have this problem of <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; monsters resisting<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; spells.  I was fighting a DW Croc yesterday at full health <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; and full mana.<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; I almost died.  I lost my pet (20th level) and had 3 resisted <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; sanity warped<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; spells (92 points of damage currently) and 5 resisted whirl <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; till you hurl.<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; I had to rely on a kind necro for the help to kill it in the <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; end.  BTW the<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; DW Croc was blue to me, I rarely ever cast a tashen spell.  I <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; find that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; just as sucessful with it as without it.<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; Do not sell yourself short.  Enchanters are amoung one of the <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; most powerful<br/>
&gt; 	&gt; classes out there, on the otherhand also one of the most <br/>
&gt; 	&gt; difficult to play.<br/>

&gt; 	&gt; Just my 2 coppers worth for you.<br/>
