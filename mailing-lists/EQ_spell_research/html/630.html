&lt;&lt;I have been fighting many many many places. I didn&#39;t get one research <br/>
component, the day I hit level 14 and started fighting things that were now <br/>
yellow con (previously red) I got a steady stream of research components. I <br/>
heard from Verant that they are NOT on mobs below level 16, only 16+.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Who from Verant stated this? I have received a research component from Rondo <br/>
Dunfire in Crushbone, who is nowhere near 16. Well, maybe 12-14... maybe <br/>
that is a unique experience though.<br/>
