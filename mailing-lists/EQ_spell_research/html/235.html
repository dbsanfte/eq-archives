<div id="ygrps-yiv-581452744">Hallo,<br/>
<br/>
Just to clarify on two points be discussed here:<br/>
<br/>
1. You can only research spells of your class, this comes from GZ, the arch <br/>
mage of magick in EQ, so you should accept it as the gospel in regards to <br/>
this question on research.<br/>
<br/>
2. When you put one point into research at level 16 you actually get 16 <br/>
points, that is why you don&#39;t see a skill increase for 2-15 because you are <br/>
already at 16. This only works on a skill you have a zero in, any skill that <br/>
has a zero gets the # of points = to your current level, so if you get a new <br/>
langague option that you have a zero skill in you will get an equal amount <br/>
of points equal to your current level, so it&#39;s best to wait to level 20 to <br/>
put your points into research/langauges you have zero skill in since you&#39;ll <br/>
get 20 points for your one points instead of 16.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea if you can research a spell for your class and sell it to <br/>
another member of your class, would be nice to know as I plan to use <br/>
research as money making skill as I know many people see research as a <br/>
headache and would gladly pay a big surcharge so as to avoid learning four <br/>
different languages and searching high and low for components.<br/>
