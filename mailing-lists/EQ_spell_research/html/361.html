&gt; As a necromancer I have to say that people think we have so<br/>
&gt; much power....you should try playing one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Though our Drain spells do not get resisted....They are not<br/>
&gt; the killer spells you believe them to be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When fighting a mob I have at 20th level 2 whole buffs only<br/>
&gt; one of them adds hp&#39;s....a whole whopping 30.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My level 20 drain spell does 65 damage and transfers that to<br/>
&gt; me Not much when a Mob is hittting you for 44 a pop, and<br/>
&gt; usually multiple hits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now to hear that full groups of high level Necro&#39;s have<br/>
&gt; acheived the task of destroying a Griffon, or a Giant? I say<br/>
&gt; Good job.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those of you out there that are thinking that Necro&#39;s<br/>
&gt; are too powerful? Our spells take a full second more (At<br/>
&gt; LEAST) to cast than all the other classes....that is one<br/>
&gt; aspect that has not been explored.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our pets are not as strong as a Magicians either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When fighting a magician sends in the pet...and blasts away<br/>
&gt; from behind.<br/>
&gt; We Necro&#39;s must go in and take some hits....then use our<br/>
&gt; drains to heal while the pet get demolished.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hate it when one player says...&quot;My class is too<br/>
&gt; weak....look at that class....they are too strong.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you think so...play that class...make a educated<br/>
&gt; decision.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I personally think that all the classes I have played have<br/>
&gt; been VERY WELL balanced.<br/>
&gt; The Enchanter has had a rough start and is still strugling,<br/>
&gt; but that is a fault of Verant not having completed thier<br/>
&gt; skills. (Ahem....you weren&#39;t the only ones...Rogue&#39;s too<br/>
&gt; were givin the short end of the stick.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I personally LOVE an enchanter in my group...if you have<br/>
&gt; ever grouped with one you know the joys of having your<br/>
&gt; monster turned into a much weaker...much smaller...much<br/>
&gt; slower version of itself.  Enchanters are NOT cannon<br/>
&gt; mages...and they are not supposed to be.  They can Debuff<br/>
&gt; and buff better than anyone.  So what if others get those<br/>
&gt; spells at higher levels....If you group...they will gladly<br/>
&gt; leave you your specialty so that they can cast MORE<br/>
&gt; drains...and less of the others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Enchanters CAN solo also...albiet not very well.<br/>
&gt; They have thier pets now.<br/>
&gt; Verant is working on them.<br/>
&gt; Give them time.<br/>
&gt; The Enchanter you make fun of now will come back to kick<br/>
&gt; your arse in later levels.<br/>
&gt; (Personal Experience)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry for this rant but it had to be said.<br/>
