&gt; knowledge from this list? Of course, this would range from sharing info to<br/>
&gt; spoilers. It would include:<br/>
&gt;         - Compiled list of learnable languages (perhaps with class and race cues,<br/>
&gt; such as DE gets at Lvl 20)<br/>
&gt;         - List of which components go with which classes<br/>
&gt;         - Index of what language certain book, tomes, grimoires, etc. are written<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt;         - And of course spell recipes by class<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not volunteering (smile), just wondeirng if anyone has plans to put up<br/>
&gt; pages with some of this stuff or write pages for existing sites like eqss or<br/>
&gt; eqv?<br/>
