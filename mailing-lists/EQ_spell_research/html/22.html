<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249501882">Specialization has been pulled for re-coding, I beleive.  As it was broke in the first place, it isn&#39;t a loss.  Once they re-implement it, it should be working fine.<br/>

  Subject: [EQ_spell_research] Wizard Spell Components<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Greetings fellow students of the Art.<br/>
   <br/>
      I a 21st level wizard who wants to delve into research headlong.  Is it true that for Wizard spells only Runes are needed?  Or do the scraps of parchment offer any benefit?<br/>
   <br/>
      Also, on a side note,  what happened to specialization?  Cant seem to train in it at the Guild halls anymore.<br/>
   <br/>
      Thanks,<br/>
