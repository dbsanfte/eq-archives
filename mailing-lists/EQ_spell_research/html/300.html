will sign up to this list and not play EQ anyway.<br/>

anymore =)<br/>

Necros can do this because it is a cheap tactic using DOT spells. Not<br/>
amazing, just the fact that your spells aren&#39;t resisted. All of my necro<br/>
friends, higher than those you mentioned, don&#39;t do this because it&#39;s cheap,<br/>
boring (it takes forever to kill a level 30+ monster at low level), and they<br/>
know they really aren&#39;t getting the kill so it&#39;s no satisfaction for them.<br/>
<br/>
    I read today that you can&#39;t get level 24+ Magician pets until they fix<br/>
it. The fix will be either the research involved in getting these pets, or<br/>
adding shops that will just sell them. I&#39;d imagine they would add shops<br/>
since the 24 pets are documented in spell lists not as &quot;Mist Elemental&quot; and<br/>
what not, but who knows. I have spent 3 levels in South Karana trying to get<br/>
aviak feathers, so it&#39;s safe to say your chances of getting them there are<br/>
slim. I also read about a vendor in a locked hut and a Minotaur vendor in<br/>
south karana, supposedly mage releated. Does anyone know about this?</div>
