<div id="ygrps-yiv-638345974">This is NOT true.<br/>
<br/>
Necromancers get thier first evocation spell at level 8.<br/>
(Ward Undead)<br/>
They see thier first skill increase. &quot;You have become better<br/>
at evocation (1).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They do not have to wait till the skill gets to 9 before<br/>
seeing it. That just means that people just miss seeing the<br/>
first 8 messages. (Maybe you all have EVERY hit and miss<br/>
showing up on your message window and it is flying by.  I<br/>
personally turn the others hits and misses off so that I<br/>
don&#39;t get bothered by the messages.)</div>
