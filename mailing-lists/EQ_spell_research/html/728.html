&gt; Ok First off I just wanted to tank you all for your prompt responses.<br/>
&gt; However I have moved back to one of my original questions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are welcome.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; According to the Mythiran Tower and to EQCasters:<br/>
&gt; Banshee Arua uses Words of Divination and Words of Eradication<br/>
&gt; I am still left with wondering what Words of Derivation are used for....?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They have never updated the research sections, and Banshee aura uses Eradication and Derivation.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Thanks for the info about the Words of Pacification.  Now the only question<br/>
&gt; is do I sell them or hang on to them in hopes that they will put the 24th<br/>
&gt; level Charm spell back in the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sell them, they have removed the spell, and will only replace it with a new one (If they ever get around to it.)<br/>

&gt; I ended up selling that non stacking words of  Dominion.  It was annoying<br/>
&gt; me and sold for the same as the Stacking words of Dominion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll pop off an identify spell on the faded page when I am in game next.<br/>
&gt; If that dosen&#39;t work I&#39;ll just give it to one of the enchanters in my guild<br/>
&gt; and let them worry abou it.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Identify will say nothing about it :)<br/>
Just give it to an Enchanter, they use the faded pages by putting them in thier research book seperatly, and hitting combine, and they will get a torn page with a number.<br/>
