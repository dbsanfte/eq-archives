<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418083668">I think you misunderstood what I meant, I always see the language increases when with characters in a group.  I was talking about language increase from NPC characters like merchants, guild trainers, etc.  When you talk to them and they give quest responses I don&#39;t think you can increase lang skills that way.  I will continue this discussion further on the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> newsletter if you want,<br/>
for it is way off topic for this newsletter :)<br/>

&gt; Yes, I have seen the &quot;Your language has increased.&quot;  At the time I was a level 5 troll<br/>
&gt; warrior, and had been in a group for a while.  After /g&#39;ing a while, it told me that<br/>
&gt; I have gotten better at Troll.  I don&#39;t know why, and I don&#39;t know how.  But it<br/>
&gt; happened twice (got better twice).<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am posting this to both newsletters because I have seen this question pop up<br/>
&gt; &gt; on both.  The first issue I will discuss is Languages.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As far as I have ever seen, I have never bot a skill raised from speaking the<br/>
&gt; &gt; native tounge to an NPC.  I have found that no matter what language I &#92;&#39;hail&#92;&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt; them in they always respond in Common.  I think this because I understand<br/>
&gt; &gt; everything that they say, if it was a language that I am awful in wouldn&#92;&#39;t I<br/>
&gt; &gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand??  Also wouldn&#92;&#39;t this become an exploit?? Imaging all of us wizards<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the store by the bank in Felwithe, just saying &#92;&#39;Hail&#92;&#39; over and over again<br/>
&gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; say Elder Elvish, to get the NPC to spam us.  Would drive everyone nuts, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; probably crash the zone.  So I am unsure as to if listening to an NPC would<br/>
&gt; &gt; really work.  Also has anyone actually seen the &#92;&#39;your language skill increase&#92;&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; after spaming the NPC and the whole zone for that matter.  I am very good at<br/>
&gt; &gt; languages and have in my time learned Old Erudian, Elder Elvish, Elvish, Tier<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dal, Barbarian, Halfling, Dwarvish, and Gnoll.  Never once have I got a increase<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; from a NPC.  Please clarify this issue for me please, would love to learn more<br/>
&gt; &gt; and faster of course.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now there seems to be some questions here on the skills of melee.  I don&#92;&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; claim<br/>
&gt; &gt; to know the calculations, but I know how to max them all.  I started with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; dagger of course, got it up to 22 or so, then got my hand to hand up to about 18<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the heck of it.  I then got staffs, first a one handed that is up to about<br/>
&gt; &gt; 25 or so, this was my travel, backup weapon which was lost when a skeleton took<br/>
&gt; &gt; a dislike to me in lesserfaydarke (was bound to qeynos) Now my main stay weapon<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a 2h staff.  I have that skill up to about 38 right now.  I got a giant snake<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; fang the other day fighting in Paw.  Before that I had decided to increase my<br/>
&gt; &gt; piercing and had a summonded dagger.  It took well over 45min and aobut 300<br/>
&gt; &gt; melee swings of the peircing weapon before I saw a single advancement, then it<br/>
&gt; &gt; flew up to 31 or so.  For ahwile I though maybe it was never going to raise but<br/>
&gt; &gt; my perseverance paid off and it did, so I am going to try and max my pierce,<br/>
&gt; &gt; find a 1h blunt and max that.  Then go back to my favorite 2h staff.  So all it<br/>
&gt; &gt; takes for you skills is patience.  Yes if you haven&#92;&#39;t used it in a great time<br/>
&gt; &gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; takes alot of use before you start to see skill in it again, kind of like skiing<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; or biking, hehe.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Really...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People here take things as too much of a personal assault.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was stating MY observations on skill increases Mike.  I<br/>
&gt; was not attacking anything. But I think that Verant<br/>
&gt; programming specific attacks on people&#39;s ability to learn is<br/>
&gt; not something they would do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There were key words in my answer by the way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I THINK.  I am not stating a fact as they may very well have<br/>
&gt; done just that, by programming skills not going up on<br/>
&gt; certain login&#39;s...even though I think that would hold no<br/>
&gt; RolePlay value.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please people...don&#39;t take every answer as a personal<br/>
&gt; affront.  Some of us here are not using English as thier<br/>
&gt; prime language and their answer may be in the form they<br/>
&gt; think is not an attack.  I try to make my answers as<br/>
&gt; non-threatening as possible.  Maybe I am doing things wrong.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry if any of my answers have insulted any of you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good day.<br/>
