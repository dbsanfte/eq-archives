<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139436088">Ok.  For everyone who was having problems getting that neglected skill to increase..   I&#39;m a level 16 wiz  ..my two hand blunt is maxed, but I havent used piercing for a LONG time.  I have been trying to build it up.. with no luck.   Well..  last night.. I was hitting things for about 2 hours..  no luck.  I had to log for about 10 min.  When I came back..  my second kill..  I got a message..   &quot;You&#39;re piercing skills have increased! (3)&quot;  I was shocked.  So I fought for another 30 min or so..  got it up to about 14.  Had to log for a bit.  When I came back.  It wouldn&#39;t move again.  So, I logged out, then back in real quick.  Yep.  That did it, it went straight to 25 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you just have to log out and back in a few times to get it to move again?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Necromancers get thier first evocation spell at level 8.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  (Ward Undead)<br/>
&gt; &gt;  They see thier first skill increase. &quot;You have become better<br/>
&gt; &gt;  at evocation (1).&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;  They do not have to wait till the skill gets to 9 before<br/>
&gt; &gt;  seeing it. That just means that people just miss seeing the<br/>
&gt; &gt;  first 8 messages. (Maybe you all have EVERY hit and miss<br/>
&gt; &gt;  showing up on your message window and it is flying by.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt;  personally turn the others hits and misses off so that I<br/>
&gt; &gt;  don&#39;t get bothered by the messages.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have found it depends on the skill... and often depends if it is a brand <br/>
&gt; new skill or not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; if I have a skill where &quot;you have learned the basics&quot; comes up... I will see <br/>
&gt; NOTHING until it advances to my level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; An example... I have seen this as a cleric and a pure caster.  With <br/>
&gt; meditate... watching VERY closely for it... as I mage I see nothing until it <br/>
&gt; I see &quot;you have learned meditate (5)&quot; as a Cleric I see nothing until &quot;you <br/>
&gt; have learned meditate (9)&quot;  or whatever the phrasing is.  I DON&#39;T see <br/>
&gt; anything until it passes the level I got the skill at.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; as a Fighter I have seen this for skills such as bash...  No messages until I <br/>
&gt; get it to 10. (fighters get bash at 9)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; now all casters have the &quot;basics&quot; at all casting skills at 0&#39;th level :)  (or <br/>
&gt; at the start) so you see the first one.<br/>
