<div id="ygrps-yiv-807733410">Its a good thing you&#39;re here to tell us all exactly how Verant programmed EQ.  ...its also good to know that there is no way possible that it could&#39;ve been a bug.  I&#39;d hate to thing that all the little bugs in the game right now, were all real.  I&#39;m sure now that they are all made up and that Verant would not program the game to have bugs in it.  Thank you so much for your well thought out response.<br/>
<br/>
In case you&#39;re wondering...   It DID happen.  Logging back in seemed to affect the skill.  I have also heard that putting one skill point into it would knock it out of its stasis and allow it to continuously improve again.  I know that its not supposed to work that way...   but thats how it is.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; That cannot be the case.  Why would Verant program the game<br/>
&gt; to check each time you log on to say...hmmm...I think THIS<br/>
&gt; person&#39;s skill will not go up today.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think you just had a string of bad skill checks.<br/>
