<b>Subject:</b> Specialization.. is it working? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592446807">Well the patch update says that specialization is now in place, but I still<br/>
cannot train in it at my guild.  I asked in game and several other people<br/>
also could not train in it.  Simply does not show up in the list.  Has<br/>
anyone succesfully trained in this yet?</div>
