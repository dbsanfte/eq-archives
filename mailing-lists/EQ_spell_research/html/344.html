<div id="ygrps-yiv-933236591">This reply was NOT necessary...you are a jerk and should be removed from <br/>
this list...this is about spell research not flaming someone.  If you would <br/>
have actually read this post you you garner exactly what hes saying...the <br/>
spells should not have been able to go unresisted.  Have you ever played <br/>
dungeons and dragons?  What would happen if you had a group of 10 mid level <br/>
(15-20) characters and they went and fought the arch-magi lich from hell?  <br/>
Well they would most likely run from the fear...die to the cold and get <br/>
eatin alive by his spells...sheesh get a life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok on to the spell research:<br/>
<br/>
My roommate just made 17th level and has failed his first few researches <br/>
(this cost some plat!)  Is there a list of runes a wizard can combine or <br/>
possibily a list of what spells to create?  Thanks!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m amazed you could get spells through on a Griffon or HG at that <br/>
&gt;level. Both of these are level 30+ monsters. Accordingly I wouldn&#39;t think a <br/>
&gt;level 18-20 group should be able to get one spell through. Certainly with <br/>
&gt;my Wizard if it&#39;s more that a couple levels higher than me I don&#39;t even <br/>
&gt;bother casting as it will get resisted fully.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unless I misread your post, I think it only prudent that Verant change <br/>
&gt;this. There&#39;s no way a group of 18-20 lvl players, regardless of class, <br/>
&gt;should be taking down monsters that are double their level. That&#39;s a tad <br/>
&gt;extreme.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Oh my god I think I&#39;m haveing a coniption (Must.... control.. Fist of <br/>
&gt;....DEATH!) Why on earth (or Norrath for that matter) would you support <br/>
&gt;Verant makeing it even harder for people to advance and have fun. By saying <br/>
&gt;something as innane and anal as that, you stifle team work and the desire <br/>
&gt;and adventure to try something more. To be dareing & adventurious is that <br/>
&gt;not what it&#39;s all about? People like you who condone such changes that <br/>
&gt;FURTHER hamper the fun, ease, and playabilty for gamers should be forced to <br/>
&gt;play Smurf warriors in Splitpaw or something. See, what retarted petty <br/>
&gt;people like you forget is WE PAY VERANT&#39;S BILLS. and thus the game should <br/>
&gt;be free of the kind of asinine restrictions that you would have further <br/>
&gt;placed upon the game. Futher more, you say that it&#39;s unreasonable that a <br/>
&gt;party of 18-20th level char take down a level 30 creature?!?!?! IDIOT!, If <br/>
&gt;your a grown man (which I highly doubt) and 6 trained 12 yr olds come at <br/>
&gt;you with sharpened Katanas (not to me!<br/>
&gt;ntion SPELLS!) they would kill you even if you did have a sword you would <br/>
&gt;be swarmed and KILLED, as would a lion or even bear sure 1 or 2 may die (as <br/>
&gt;char commonly do in the aformentioned sitiuation. but the higher level <br/>
&gt;tougher creature WOULD DIE!. So take your petty, anal, Triffling mentality, <br/>
&gt;that would have us all struggleing even more for the modest exp we can <br/>
&gt;already just barely gain, To Hell (or Lavastorm in a pinch) and DIE!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We need not further restrictions but, benefits to make it more fun,<br/>
