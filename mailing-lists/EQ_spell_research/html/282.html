&gt; Once you reach lvl 29, I believe your guildmaster will have it available to<br/>
&gt; learn, before that, you just need to find someone who&#39;s already learned it<br/>
&gt; and hope they will teach it to you.  It will probably be quite expensive to<br/>
&gt; learn though, usually a trade in runes is required.  That&#39;s how I learned<br/>
&gt; and that&#39;s my price for teaching ;)  I&#39;m on the Tarew Marr server, if you<br/>
&gt; are also on the same server, give me a tell ;)<br/>
