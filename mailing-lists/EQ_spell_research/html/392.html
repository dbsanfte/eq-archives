 </span></blockquote>Hehe Levitate eh try finding high ground like a mountain or high zone wall cast levitate and walk out onto nothing 100 ft or more off the ground look down find a target and cast an<br/>
offensive spell at it - though it seems about 30 ft you still get hit even though they are well below your floating feet.... have not found levitate too usefull though I did use the<br/>
overhead casting on things below and floated out to the aviak island instead of swimming or taking a boat - you also can move yourself down with levitate by looking down and hitting<br/>
the arrow key for forward movment unfortunately you cannot go up in the same manner - you will always drop a bit it seems from the height of your starting point as you travel until<br/>
you resume your just over the ground levitation height again.<br/>

Xzar - looking forward to finding the runes for true flight ability</div>
