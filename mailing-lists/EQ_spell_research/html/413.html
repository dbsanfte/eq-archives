                                                   Staff of Writhing<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
         The staff of writhing is one of the various skull staff&#39;s in the game(which look similar to the staff<br/>
that the Priest of Discord is equipping). This particular staff is a 1 handed blunt weapon and can be equipped by<br/>
Necromancers, Enchanters, Wizards, Magicians and Bards. It has a damage of 9, a delay of 33 and has the effect of<br/>
chaotic feedback(which does 48 points of damage when successful).<br/>

Found on EQ-Lizer.<br/>

&gt; I saw a level 40 gnome necro with the staff. It is called a Staff of<br/>
&gt; Writhing. He said he got it from killing the Priest of Discord.<br/>
