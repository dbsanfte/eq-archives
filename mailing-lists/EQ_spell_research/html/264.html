I am copying you on a message I have sent to &quot;cristie&quot;.  My sons and I apologize to anyone who may have received<br/>
the happy99.exe worm from this account.  They were merely unwitting participants, having received it from someone<br/>
else.  Please check your C:WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM&#92; directory for a file named SKA.EXE or alternatively do a file search<br/>
for happy99.exe.  If these exist, then follow the directions below to get rid of it.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>

Excuse me.  I am not sure who you are, but you certainly do not possess many<br/>
manners, either Internet or otherwise.  This account belongs to me, but is used<br/>
primarily by my two sons, aged 12 and 14.  They are primarily using it for<br/>
playing games (Everquest mostly) as well as for game info and trading magic<br/>
cards.  They had no idea that this computer was infected with the worm<br/>
happy99.exe.  After they read your first nasty email, they immediately told me-<br/>
having scanned prior emails, I was able to deduce that one of them had received<br/>
it on Mar.12 from some other unwitting soul and being a somewhat naive user, he<br/>
had opened it, thereby infecting this computer.<br/>
<br/>
What any polite person would do upon receiving something like the happy99.exe<br/>
worm in an email attachment would be to inform the sender of their infection.<br/>
It is obvious that you know very little about this type of problem (it is<br/>
technically a worm, not a virus).  It took me about five minutes to find out<br/>
about this worm (doing a yahoo search) and another five minutes to get rid of<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, I would hope that you show a little more respect for your fellow<br/>
users and rather than making threats, help try to solve the problem.  Try to<br/>
remember that some users are still somewhat young and naive when it comes to<br/>
computer and internet use and we should try to help where we can.  I have made<br/>
sure that my sons now understand more about internet security and the dangers<br/>
of viruses etc.  A good rule of thumb is never to open any attachments unless<br/>
you are absolutely sure of the source.<br/>
<br/>
The following link provides information on what the happy99.exe worm is and how<br/>
to get rid of it:<br/>

<br/>
It is very straight forward and I include instructions here for your benefit:<br/>
<br/>
VirusName: Happy99.Worm<br/>
Aliases: Trojan.Happy99, I-Worm.Happy<br/>
Likelihood: Common<br/>
Region Reported: World Wide<br/>
Characteristics:  Trojan Horse, Worm<br/>
Description:<br/>
 This is a worm program, NOT a virus. This program has reportedly been received<br/>
through email<br/>
spamming and USENET newsgroup posting. The file is usually named HAPPY99.EXE in<br/>
the email or article attachment. When being executed, the program also opens a<br/>
window entitled &quot;Happy New Year 1999 !!&quot; showing a firework display to disguise<br/>
its other actions. The program copies itself as SKA.EXE and extracts a DLL that<br/>
it carries as SKA.DLL into WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM directory. It also modifies<br/>
WSOCK32.DLL in WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM directory and copies the original WSOCK32.DLL<br/>
into WSOCK32.SKA. WSOCK32.DLL handles internet-connectivity in Windows 95 and<br/>
98. The modification to WSOCK32.DLL allows the worm routine to be triggered<br/>
when a connect or send activity is detected. When such online activity occurs,<br/>
the modified code loads the worm&#39;s SKA.DLL. This SKA.DLL creates a new email or<br/>
a new article with UUENCODED HAPPY99.EXE inserted into the email or article. It<br/>
then sends this email or posts this article. If WSOCK32.DLL is in use when the<br/>
worm tries to modify it (i.e. a user is online), the worm adds a registry<br/>
entry:<br/>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&#92;Software&#92;Microsoft&#92;Windows&#92;CurrentVersion&#92;RunOnce=SKA.EXE<br/>
The registry entry loads the worm the next time Windows start.<br/>
<br/>
Removing the worm manually:<br/>
<br/>
1.delete WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM&#92;SKA.EXE<br/>
2.delete WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM&#92;SKA.DLL<br/>
3. in WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM&#92; directory, rename WSOCK32.DLL to WSOCK32.BAK<br/>
4. in WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM&#92; directory, rename WSOCK32.SKA to WSOCK32.DLL<br/>
5.delete the downloaded file, usually named HAPPY99.EXE<br/>
<br/>
Windows prevents you to do step #3 and #4 above if the machine is still<br/>
connected to the Internet. The file &quot;windows&#92;system&#92;wsock32.dll&quot; is used<br/>
whenever the machine is connected to Internet (i.e. through dial-up or LAN<br/>
connection).<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Who the HELL do you think you are sending virus executables out to people<br/>
&gt; on a mailing list.  I have written to your isp about this matter and I am<br/>
&gt; certain they will take action on it.  Spreading viruses is a felony. You<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t deserve to have an internet account with any isp in my humble opinion.<br/>
