<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304442551">So far I&#39;ve bought all of the wizard series of research books and translated them.  I only counted about 25 or so spells in them.  All of them are in Old Erudian.<br/>
<br/>
I know there has to be more, I have a rune right now that doesn&#39;t seem to go with any of the spells lists I&#39;ve been given.  Plus according to the book, On Languages, there are books writen in Combine, Dragon and Elder Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know where to find these?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
