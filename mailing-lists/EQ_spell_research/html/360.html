<div id="ygrps-yiv-360308752">Sorry guys, I realized a lil late that I had sent that email to the eq_research list instead of the eq_magic_users list. I am suscribed to them both. I know of beserker str and if i remember it was tasarins pg 26 that made it. or 24... one is i believe mesmerization one and the other beserker str. And for the resists. Ask to a necro if they get resisted? And the amount that a wizard gets resisted is a LOT less then an enchanter. Anyhow, once again a apologize to posting this here. <br/>
