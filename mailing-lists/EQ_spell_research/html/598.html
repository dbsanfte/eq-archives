<b>Subject:</b> Re: Kill Stealers (was -Wizards being resisted) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-478745108">Well, I was going to stay out of this discussion about kill stealing, but<br/>
thought I would relay a little story of what happened to me.<br/>
<br/>
I had returned to Faydwer at 18th level after having not been there<br/>
for over 8 levels.  I decided to go into Crushbone and check out all<br/>
the high level orcs who used to train and cause me to zone at earlier<br/>
levels (The Prophet, Warlord, Emporer Crush, D&#39;Vinn, etc.).<br/>
As it was getting late, I ran to zone to leave, and a large group of<br/>
people there were attacking D&#39;Vinn (large being 8 to 10 people on<br/>
him).  I wanted to /con D&#39;Vinn, so I gave a small 38 point blast to an<br/>
orc pawn in the way, and I did /con on D&#39;Vinn, he was yellow.  I then<br/>
proceded to zone, without attacking D&#39;Vinn.<br/>
<br/>
After zoning, I received multiple tells from people berating me for stealing<br/>
D&#39;Vinn.  Shouts then came in the Greater Faydark zone on how I had<br/>
been kill stealing.  I tried to explain to people giving me tells that it was<br/>
not me and I even had them scroll back in the text window and look,<br/>
but at that point the damage was done.  The next day I was in Unrest<br/>
and again received a shout saying I was a kill stealer.  I explained to the<br/>
person that it was not me, and they finally did shout an apology.<br/>
<br/>
The moral of the story is, if you are going to shout about people being<br/>
kill stealers, please witness the kill steal first hand and do not believe what<br/>
everyone tells you.  I found out later that someone who was attacking<br/>
him (probably the one who actually killed him), said I was the one who<br/>
killed him and that I had looted the body.  Everyone there believed him<br/>
and no one spoke up about it being wrong (someone had to have seen<br/>
who actually did it).<br/>
<br/>
                                                Just something to think about,<br/>
<br/>
                                                                Soren<br/>
                                                                20th Level Wizard<br/>
                                                                The Rathe Server<br/>

&gt; We need people like this in Everquest, since he is &#39;notorious&#39; already on<br/>
&gt; your server, why not let him remain that way? Cause when people see him on<br/>
&gt; /who, they will prob shout that this steal killer is on and try to group up<br/>
&gt; in an effort to stop this, which if you look in alternate perspective, kinda<br/>
&gt; produces a quest.  A kinda &#39;quest&#39; to stop steal killers might prove much<br/>
&gt; more interesting for many players rather than take up an EQ quest, which to<br/>
&gt; some is most boring. So with a steal killer&#39;s reputation building up, guess<br/>
&gt; who would be the top on PKs list when the PK seasons begin? Heehee<br/>
