<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136703289">Hallo,<br/>
<br/>
Just some infobits to clarify some things,<br/>
<br/>
1. You do not need to train in a language to learn it, you can learn it by <br/>
hearing somebody who is excellent in the language speak it. If you are ever <br/>
riding the boat start up a language class and get all aboard who will <br/>
cooperate to speak in their native tongues. After getting off my first boat <br/>
trip I could, barely, speak some Dwarf, and I am a Gnome and had never <br/>
trained in any langauge with my Guildmaster. Where we&#39;ll get to hear Dragon <br/>
or Elder Dragon is beyond me, but I do know the Gypsies that sell Combine <br/>
weapons are related to the historic Combine Empire, perhaps hanging out by <br/>
Gypsies and listening to them talk to people will give us Combine... just an <br/>
idea for somebody to try out. From what I understand you can only learn a <br/>
language from hearing from somebody who is excellent in it, but I could be <br/>
wrong about that, however I have not been able to get my two fellow <br/>
Enchanters I travel with(my main character is a Gnome Enchanter)to learn any <br/>
Dwarf from speaking in it even though I learned it from hearing it spoken, <br/>
albeit from a native speaker who is excellent in Dwarf.<br/>
<br/>
2. As far as combining things in the books, do not put anything into the <br/>
books other than what the recipe called for and do not use summoned <br/>
water/items in creating the spell or it won&#39;t work. Quills and Scrolls <br/>
apparently have no use that people can figure out, probably confusing <br/>
remnants from the Beta just like the Age of Restoration book that was pulled <br/>
after the last patch due to it being useless.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>
<br/>
